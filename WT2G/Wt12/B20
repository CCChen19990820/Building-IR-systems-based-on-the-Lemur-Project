CHARLES MITCHELL<br>
<br>
When James Tilton, Washington's first surveyor-general left the Atlantic for the Pacific, a mulatto boy named Charley, born in slavery, was given him by a relative in Talbot County, Maryland. After living in the Tilton family at Olympia for five or six years, and attaining his growth and almost his majority, Charley was approached by colored men, told of the pleasure of freedom at Victoria, and induced to try to make his escape.<br>
<br>
The colored steward, on the steamer <B>Eliza Anderson</B> stowed him away one September day, just before the boat started from the southern end of her route. About the time the steamer got to Seattle, Charley was found by Captain Fleming. To prevent his escape Captain Fleming had Charley locked in a spare room.<br>
<br>
At Victoria, the colored men were waiting on the wharf, and when they learned from the steward of the situation two of them made affidavit that a "...negro boy, a fugitive slave, who had made frequent attempts to escape and secure his freedom, was on board the steam <B>Eliza Anderson</B>, detained there against his will."<br>
<br>
On the strength of this Henry P.P. Crease, an attorney, made application to  Chief Justice Cameron for a writ of habeas corpus. Captain Fleming resisted the law for a time, but was finally obliged to release Charley from confinement, the boy walking ashore with his new found friends.<br>
<br>
Fleming filed a written protest, and demanded the return of Charley that he might be "...taken back to his master..." describing him as a "negro boy named Charley, the property of James  Tilton, of Olympia, Washington Territory, who ran away from his master, etc.<br>
<br>
Governor McGill, on the boat at the time also protested, alleging that the whole proceeding was illegal and in violation of international law. General Tilton claimed that he did not regard Charley as a slave but as an orphan under his control until of legal age; and further that his services were of no pecuniary value and his escape was a matter of indifference.<br>
<br>
This was the only case of negro slavery, or of anything resembling such slavery in the history of the Territory or State.<br>

<br>
An problem facing the slave holder in the Pacific Northwest was the region's close proximity to foreign possessions such as British Canada or Mexico which before 1848 included present day California and Nevada.<br>
<br>
An incident involving a young slave, Charles Mitchell, illustrates this point. Charles was owned by Major James Tilton, of Olympia, Washington Territory's surveyor general. On September 29, 1860, Mitchell stowed away on the <B>Eliza Anderson, </B> an American steamer bound for Victoria, British Columbia. After the steamer was under way, he was discovered by ship's officers and locked in a cabin to await the ship's return to Olympia.<br>
<br>
<B>The Eliza Anderson</B> docked at Victoria with the fugitive slave still a prisoner, when Black residents of the Canadian city learned of his plight and through the local sheriff secured his release from the vessel.<br>
<br>
When a hearing took place in Victoria to determine Mitchell's status, the chief justice of the British Colony granted the slave freedom on the grounds that a person aboard a foreign vessel in a British port was subject to the laws of Great Britain.<br>
<br>
Tilton protested to the American Secretary of State but no action was taken.<br>

Another version of the same story written from a more "legal" point of view was published in the <B>British Columbia Historical Quarterly</B> for October, 1942. Written by Robie L. Reid and entitled "How One Slave Became Free," <B>British Columbia Historical Quarterly</B> VI (October, 1942), p. 251-256.<br>
<br>
Mr. Reid concluded his article by writing:<br>
<br>
"After reading the whole proceedings in the matter one wonders if Captain (John R.) Fleming was really anxious to return Charles to his owner. He was a man of some education and standing, otherwise he would not have occupied the position he did. He was in touch with a lawyer and a good one, George Pearkes, as is shown by his
protest.<br>
<br>
"And yet he thought his case good enough for him to appear on the trial and act as Counsel for himself. It almost seems as if he were more anxious to save his face with his Olympia friends than to carry Charles back to that town in triumph."<br>
<br>
Mr. Reid in writing his article contacted an attorney, Mr. G.L. Murray of Vancouver, who responded by letter, G.L. Murray to R.L. Reid, September 14, 1942.<br>
<br>
"(1) At one place Wheaton's International Law, a recognized American authority suggests that the view that there is any right to liberate a slave from a foreign ship in British waters cannot be supported.<br>
<br>
(2) Yet in certain cases it has been done, although cases cited on this point do not state whether it was by way of Habeas Corpus or otherwise.<br>
<br>
(3) It is submitted that Wheaton's view is wrong because foreign ships in British ports are subject to British law, and hence must be subject to British civil remedies.<br>
<br>
(4) A close reading of the decided cases cited by Wheaton clearly leads to the conclusion that once a ship is subject to British jurisdiction by virtue of its being in a British port, it makes no difference what the legal status of a slave may be by reason of any law or enactment of the home State of the foreign ship."<br>

CHARLEY<br>
<br>
Ronald Carey, "How the mail went through...over, around New York to Oregon Territory...via Panama," <B>Sea Chest XI (</B> June, 1978), p. 125-127.<br>
<br>
At Olympia the mail for the lower Sound was placed aboard the steamer <B>Eliza Anderson</B> then operated on the Puget Sound Mail route by Captain John R. Fleming.  Captain Daniel T. Bradford was the other large stockholder in the vessel, and James Scranton had the mail contract.  The new system got under way in November and before mid winter rains came it was a great success....<br>
<br>
Captain Fleming was meticulous in the exchange of newspapers at each port of call and the vessel called at Victoria each week, anyway. Perhaps he would have continued to carry the mail as an accommodation, had it not been for an incident that occurred in Victoria the previous September.<br>
<br>
At that time a large colony of free Negroes resided n Victoria, and on September 25, 1860 the sheriff at Victoria was advised that a fugitive slate was being held captive aboard the <B>Eliza Anderson</B>. Armed with a writ of habeas corpus, the sheriff went aboard the <B>Anderson</B> and found the person he sought, a youth named Charley locked in the lamp room.<br>
<br>
The boarding angered Captain Fleming, who looked upon the invasion of his steamer as an international incident, even thought she was tied to a Victoria wharf at the time.  All he knew of Charley was that he was a minor, and he belonged to the household of James Tilton, the first Surveyor General of
Washington Territory. Charley had stowed away on the <B>Anderson</B> and Captain  Fleming felt it his duty to return the boy to Olympia.<br>
<br>
Actually Charley was the child of a slave girl who had belonged to Tilton's aunt in Maryland.  The boy's father was a white man, an oysterman on Chesapeake Bay. When Charley was only two years old his mother had contracted cholera, and on her death bed, at a time when she was most miserable she had said, "Missie, take care of Charley..."<br>
<br>
This had been done and the care of the boy finally fell to the older daughter of the aunt. Then, in 1853, James Tilton was appointed by the President to survey the new Territory of Washington, so that settlers could locate their claims. This was to be a free state, so Charley was turned over to tilton, with the understanding that he would be brought up in such a way that he could support himself when grown.<br>
<br>
Tilton took the responsibility seriously and was determined that Charley should learn a trade. One trade that  Tilton though particularly desirable was that of steward on a vessel such as the <B>Eliza Anderson.</B> Charley was sent to school at Fort Steilacoom and later at Olympia, but the training was of a vocational nature and Charley did not find much stimulation in the trades. As a result of his trips on the <B>Eliza Anderson</B> he had met the free negroes of Victoria and he finally stowed away on the vessel in order to join them. Before he got to Victoria, however, Captain Fleming discovered him, and locked him in the lamp locker.<br>
<br>
When the boy was taken off the vessel in Victoria, Captain Fleming charged that boarding a United States mail steamer was a violation of international law. At a hearing the next day, before the Chief Justice of Vancouver Island, Captain Fleming appeared for the defense. He said the case would probably be brought before the United States government, so he would make no statement except to enter a protest against the taking of the boy from his custody.  The protest was recorded, but the judge found Captain Fleming in violation of British law, his arrest of Charley illegal.<br>
<br>
When he returned to Olympia, moreover, Captain Fleming was surprised to learn that the Tiltons did not want Charley back. they said that they had been trying to fulfill a responsibility to the boy's mother. Now that he, himself had relieved them of that responsibility, they would like to leave things as they were.<br>
<br>
Chagrined, Captain Fleming remarked to an Olympia reporter that it was one of the rare cases in which kidnapping or stealing was acceptable to both the stealer and the stealee.<br>

FUGITIVE SLAVE CASE.<br>
<br>
"Fugitive slave case," <B>Pioneer and Democrat.</B> September 28, 1860.<br>
<br>
The people of Victoria, especially the black element and their sympathizers, haive been greatly exhilerated at the escape of a boy from this side, who it appears was by some negroes, who<br>
knew nothing of the facts, a slave  of  Gen.  Tilton,   Surveyor-General of this Territory.<br>
<br>
Not deeming it necessary to go  into a lengthy detail of the causes which led to the escape of the boy Charley, we will endeavor in as brief a manner as possible, to present the circumstances and influences by which the boy was surrounded, and the arguments used to wean his affections from those who have been to him a father and mother rather than master or mistress, as stated in the affidavit of the Victoria blacks, at whose instance the warrant <B>to search the Anderson</B> wao issued by Chief Justice Cammon.<br>
<br>
For the last two or three years a number of black ingrates about here, who have lost not only that respect of our citizens which was due to them as <B>niggers</B>, but were the despised of people of their own color, have been assidious in their attentions to Charley, and constant in their endeavors to bring about a rapture between the boy and his benefactors, by holding out enticements to him of so flattering a nature as might well be supposed could not be resisted by a boy of his age.<br>
<br>
The delightful prospect held out to his of profitable employment, when once he should become his own master; the feasibility of becoming a "free boy, by running away frcm his master and making his escape to Victoria, and his degendered condition while a "slave," all tended to inflame his mind, but, until the arrival of a fleshy looking darky here week before last from Victoria, were insufficient to alienate his affections from his former benefactor and dashing appearance of this decided Charley, and on Monday morning last he concluded to rush to freedom.<br>
<br>
For this purpose he was taken away by the aforesaid darky.......being temporarily employed as a worker on the Anderson, and <B>his</B> presence....... was not discovered until the steamer arrived at Steilacoom or Seattle.<br>
<br>
While the vessel as undergoing a search for a Being questioned by Capt.  Fleming as to where and how he came to be there Charley revealed all, and was set to work to pay his passage, as well as
to learn him a lesson in smuggling himself on a vessel without the knowledge or command of the officers.<br>
<br>
Nothing more was thought of him until the Captain's attention was directed to the boys possible intention if meating his escape by the Excellency Gov.  McGill, who happened to be on board with his family, which latter gentleman had received an intnuation of Charley's purpose through his little son, and it was then, and when within four miles of Victoria that he was placed in close confinement by the officers the boat, with a view of returning him to his owner.<br>
<br>
Within half an hour after arriving at this port of universal equality, a rabble of "Philantropic free blacks" and "English humanitarians" had assembled to set a head boy frre. Great was the rejoicing but short was the triumph.  Capt.  Flemming who had anticipated nothing of this sort of rescue, happening to be absent, the Anderson was in charge of her first sailer, a gentleman in no way well-disposed to the free-blacks of Victoria.<br>
<br>
With a few .... ... and many maledictions upon their heads, "philantropists and humanitarians" were sent scampering up the wharf.  The promise to "break open their heads if the attempt was made to break open the vessel's state rooms," which had been threatened by some of the mob, appeared to have some effect upon the arder of the crowd, and the "breaking doors" was not attempted.<br>
<br>
By, this time the Captain had returned. Prior, however, in his arrival aboard, a negro employed aboard as cook, the dandy negro steward of whom we have before made mention, and a Victoria negro named Jerome, (if we are not mistaken in the name,) had joined in an affidavit wherein the swore "that a negro boy, a fugitive slave who had made frequent attempts to escape and secure his freedom was then on board the Anderson, detained there against his will."<br>
<br>
Upon this: H.P. P. Crease Esq. says the Colonist, "immediately waited upon Chief Justic Cameron and applied for a writ of habeus corpus, which his lordship granted, and made returnable at 10 o'clock this morning.  The writ was handed to sheriff Naylor, and that officer, accompanied by Sert.  Carey, of the police force, went on board the Anderson, and demanded the alleged fugitive.<br>
<br>
The officers in charge of the boat stated that Capt Fleming being on shore, they did not feel justified in taking any steps in the matter.  Captain  Flemming soon made his appearance,, however, and declined delivering the fugitive-up until he had consulted an Acting Governor McGill, of Washington Territory, who is in town.<br>
<br>
The sheriff then requested that the room in which the slave was confined might be pointed out, which was done, and Sergeant Carey
left to guard the door."<br>
<br>
Thus far the Colonist is correct; but it is decidedly in error in saying that "Capt.  Flemming and Gov.  McGill subsequently consulted authorities, and arriving at the conclusion that the slave could not be held, consented to deliver him up; and at 4 o'clock, Sheriff Naylor again visited the steamer, and securing the prisoner, took him to jail."<br>
<br>
On the contrary, not only Capt.  Fleming but Gov.  McGill protested from first to last against the legality of the proceedings or the detention of the boy, but denounced the whole affair, from begiming to end, as a violation of international law, and as an insult to the flag which should have secured respect not only for the vessel, but for the property and passengers on board.<br>
<br>
He denies the right of a British court of justice annuling any engagement which is legal by our laws.  He denies its right of annuling the relationship existing beyween guardian and ward, such as existed between General Tilton and the negro boy Charley who is a minor; and he very much question the propriety of issuing a writ of habes corpus upon so frivolous testimony as was produced before Justice Cameron.<br>
<br>
The witnesses before him testify that "the boy is a slave of Gen.  Tilton." The truth is, he is not and never was.  The witnesses swear "Charley was made frequent attempts to escape." The facts are, he is welcome to any additional liberty he may be supposed to be at present invested with, and it is hoped he will stay away.<br>
<br>
But it is not true that he has never before made such attempt.  It is his first, though his opportunities for effecting his escape have been innumerable.  And, lastly, the Governor protests against search being instituted upon American vessels engaged in the merchant serrices between here and Victoria, under the pretence of asserting whether they are engaged in the slave trade, <B>under</B> <B>any circumstances</B>.<br>
<br>
It is only owing to the absence of a proper naval force that his conduct on that occassion as warranted the British journals in <B>proclaiming</B> our Governor's assent the recent outrage.  Had there been a United States vessel of war there the time, the affair would not have so terminated.  But, under the circumstances, we had to succumb to superior force.<br>
<br>
Before leaving Victoria Capt.  Fleming filed the following protest against the action of Chief Justice Cameron which he requested be filed with the proceedings in the case.  As the wlole affair will be submitted at once for the consideration of our goverrment, we defer further comment, only wondering what the next act of British aggression may be to which our citizens must
quietly submit, and what the next insult our government will be submissively pocket.<br>

KONAPEE.<br>
<br>
Clinton A. Snowden, "The Story of Konapee," <B>History of Washington. The Rise and Progress of An American State.</B> New York: The Century Company, 1909. Volume I, p.  434-38.<br>
<br>
"The scene of the third appearance of white men mentioned by Mr. Smith, but probably the first in order of time, was about two miles south of the mouth of the Columbia.  This bears upon the face of the Indian narrative, the evidence of being the very first coming of the white men remembered by the Oregon Indians.  According to some of the accounts the ship was sighted during an afternoon in strawberry time, and watched with superstitious interest, the Clatsops thinking it possible, that this was a reappearance of Tallapus.<br>
<br>
During the night, however, whether or not that be an imaginative introduction, tlie ship came ashore, and in the morning a woman living on the weather side of the plains, was startled by the appearance of a person, in garb singular to her, and with a long beard flowing down upon his breast.  The wreck was lying in the breakers, and two men were on the beach, having built a fire there among the driftwood, and were roasting pop corn; and they made signs to her for water.<br>
<br>
She was much startled by their appearance, and went to the village for help, wailing out as she went, 'I have found people who are men, and who yet are bears.' The Clatsops going together to the place were astonished at the sight ot the white men, and even more so at the food they were cooking-the corn popping in the coals being, down to the present day, one of the most exciting episodes of the narrative.<br>
<br>
It is said, too, that the chief was not fully satisfied that these were really men, until he had carefully examined their hands, and found they agreed perfectly with his own.<br>
<br>
' From the manner of the coming of these castaways,' says Mr. Smith, 'the Clatsops and Chinooks named all white persons, without respect to nationality, TIo-hon-nipts, that is, "Of those who drifted ashore." This would indicate, beyond all doubt, that this was the first seen of the white men by Indians.'<br>
<br>
"The two whites were claimed as slaves, and after the ship, which at low tide could be reached from the land, was ransacked and looted, it was discovered that one of the men was able to make knives from the iron, and the ship was then burned to obtain the iron.  The name of the iron worker, as rendered by the Indians, was Konapee.<br>
<br>
He and his companion were at first compelled to labor incessantly,
but in the course of time were held in high favor and given their liberty.  Being allowed to select a site, Konapee came around to the Columbia River side of the peninsula and built a house of his own.  This place was called by the Indians Konapee long after his departure, and, indeed, down to the times of the white settlements, or later.<br>
<br>
Among other articles brought by Konapee were a number of Chinese cash, which were kept among the Indians, and called 'Konapee's money.' By some it has been supposed the vessel wrecked here was a Japanese or Chinese junk, drifting across the ocean and lost.  But this supposition is unnecessary, as the Spaniards had early established trading relations with the Phillippines and Chinese ports, and a vessel returning would be almost certain to have an abundance of Chinese cash.<br>
<br>
On the other hand a Japanese or Chinese junk would not have men with beards, nor by any possibility have Indian corn, and a ship from Mexico might easily have a supply left over.<br>
<br>
" Bearing out still further the idea that this was a Spanish ship is the reference by Gabriel Franchere, in 1811, to meeting an old man at the Cascades, whose name was Soto, and the son of a Spaniard, who was one of four wrecked at the mouth of the Columbia.<br>
While the number is not the same, the Indians stating two, and Soto 
stating four, the other circumstances are so alike <B>that </B>it is more 
<B>than </B>probable that the father of Soto was Konapee. Konapee later 
at<B>tempted, </B>and is also said by the Indians, to reach the land of 
the sunrise, and going from the mouth of <B>the </B>Columbia to the 
Cascades and marrying there <B>an </B>Indian woman.  A daughter of 
Konapee, or Soto, is also <B>mentioned </B>by Mr. Smith, she being an old 
woman in about 1830, <B>when </B>seen by Mr. Smith's mother.  Calculating 
<B>the </B>age of Soto at about eighty, that given by Franchere in <B>1811 </B>it would appear that Konapee was drifted upon the coast of Oregon in about the year 1725, or about a century after the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock.<br>
<br>
"It would thus seem quite certain that the Columbia was first seen 
by Spaniards, <B>but </B>it was not discovered-that is, the fact of this event was never made known to the civilized world, and no benefit to civilization resulted.  However, while Konapee, who may have been a man of intelligence, and whose life on the lordly Columbia may have been one of the great romances of the world, as it certainly could not have been otherwise had he understood that he was actually in possession of the greatest geographical secret of 
the age, was destined to spend his days with the savages, never <B>to</B> return to his native land, we can trace very important results from his accidental landing at the Columbia.<br>
<br>
From him the Clatsops and Chinooks, and probably many other tribes learned the fact that there were white men, and the knowledge 
seemed to be pretty generally spread that on the <B>salt</B> water to the west there were men with beards sailing ships.

The impression gained of Konapee in regard to white men was <B>one </B>of 
dignity, and generally favorable.  Most of all, through <B>him </B>they learned the use of iron-one of the great inventions of the world's history, which introduced to the Oregon Indians a new industrial age.<br>
<br>
One of the very noticeable facts mentioned by Cook in his 
observations of <B>the </B>Indians along the coast was <B>that </B>they showed no surprise at the sight of iron implements or weapons.  He was some-
what puzzled to account for their acquaintance with this metal.<br>
<br>
It was perhaps Konapee first of all who introduced iron among the people of the Pacific northwest coast.<br>
<br>
"The effect of this upon the disposition and the progress of the 
Columbia River Indians might have <B>been </B>very marked, The desire for iron would lead to a desire to see more of the white men's ships, and to consider the white men as friends.  They would naturally learn from Konapee that the whites would trade them iron for any valuables, such as food or clothing.<br>
<br>

They would also <B>form </B>a very respectful opinion of the white men, as persons of unusual power, and gradually gain the idea that it was 
not only humane but wise to <B>treat</B> any that came among them with great circumspection.  Whether or not this disposition dated 
entirely from Konapee at all <B>events, </B>we find it preminently marked in this tribe.<br>
<br>

All <B>the </B>whites ever visiting the Columbia, except on one or two occasions, and then for special reasons, were treated with perfect friendliness and consideration, and the one article inquired for was iron.  The love of beads and blankets and looking glasses and other trinkets was fostered later.<br>
<br>

"The <B>immediate </B>effect of Konapee's residence and work among the Clatsops may have been considerable to increase the power of that tribe. We find that the father of Kobaiway, the latter being chief at the time of Lewis and Clark's visit, became one of the greatest of the chiefs of the coast country, having sufficient wealth to support twenty wives, and to thus form alliances with many different tribes.<br>
<br>
As each wife had a number of slaves, and as the Clatsop chief must keep an efficient guard for his numerous household, it appears that his own personal family was very large.  Quite a portion of his wealth may have been derived froni the skill of his artisans who shaped iron into knives, which probably sold for fabulous prices among the interior tribes."<br>
<br>
These legends as to the coming of the white man among these Indians, at an unknown date prior to those visits of which we have authentic record, doubtless have some basis of truth.  Of the
beeswax ship there can be but little doubt; it was almost certainly the ship that was sent to supply the Franciscan missionaries in California, but which never reached them.<br>
<br>
Konapee may well have been a passenger on, or a member of the crew of, one of the numerous galleons that were lost on the way froni the Philippines, after Urdaneta had shown the Spaniards how to make the return journey from those islands, by first sailing north out of the region of ihe trade winds.<br>
<br>
It is quite conceivable that many of them were driven much farther than those in command of them intended to go, by violent storms, and it would be strange if some of them did not reach the coast of Oregon.  But whether these chance visitors brought to the coast Indians the iron brass and copper which the earliest known navi-
gators iound in their possession, who shall say ?<br>

THE SAINT NICHOLAS<br>
<br>
Brig.<br>
<br>
Edwin Van Syckle, "The loss of the Saint Nicholas," <B>The River Pioneers.</B> Seattle: Pacific Search Press, 1982, p. 19-24. (excerpts).<br>
<br>
On September 28, 1808, the Saint Nicholas, reportedly a "fine little brig acquired from the Yankees," sailed from New Archangel for an exploration and fur-trading expedition along what is now the coast of Washington.  She was under command of Nikolai Bulagin, a Russian naval officer.<br>
<br>
With him was his eighteen-year old wife, attractive and venturesome Anna Petrovna Bulagina, who was to have the distinction of being the first white woman to set foot on the West Coast.<br>
<br>
Aboard the Saint Nicholas were twenty people-seventeen men, four of them Aleuts, and three women, two of them Aleuts.  Timofei Tarakanov, the supercargo, had been with the garrison building the first fort at Sitka and was one of the few survivors of the Tlingit attack.  He had been captured and taken to a Tlingit village, and had been the last man rescued by Captains Ebbets and Barber.<br>
<br>
About the time the Saint Nicholas left New Archangel, so did another vessel of the Russian-American Company, the Kadiak (Kodiak) under Ivan A. Kouskov.  She was scheduled to put into Grays Harbor for a rendezvous with the Saint Nicholas, take aboard Timofei Tarakanov, and then proceed to probe the coast just north of California.<br>
<br>
The  Russian-American  Company,   organized   in   1799   by   Czar Paul, with Alexander Baranof as leader, was under heavy pressure to cast southward.  From the time the survivors of Vitus Bering's second and tragic expedition had returned in 1741 to Kamchatka with furs, to the establishment of the first Russian settlement of Bering's "Great Land" in 1784 at Three Saints on Kodiak Island, and the move of the Russian capital at the close of the eighteenth century to New Archangel, the Czar's people had exhausted the natural resources of the Aleutians.  They had to seek elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Baranof, although a capable leader, was also a tragedy maker.  In the Aleutians he made slaves of the more peaceful Aleuts, but when he attempted the same thing with the Tlingits-a more warlike people-he met resistance.  The Tlingits in 1802 overran Sitka and massacred the garrison, forcing the Russians to rebuild a short
distance away.  This virtually denied Russian trade<br>
in Tlingit territory.<br>
<br>
Even more dangerous to Russian ambitions was the encroachment of American and English traders upon what the Russians claimed as their exclusive trading territory.  The Spaniards were already established at Nootka on the west coast of Vancouver Island.  The task of the Kodiak was to search out a California trading site to neutralize the inroads of Spain.<br>
<br>
So it was that the Saint Nicholas sailed from New Archangel that September day in 1808.  She sighted Cape Flattery at the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca on October 10, but became bedeviled by calms and light winds, working northward along the coast of Vancouver Island.  There the ship's officers mapped the shore, while Bulagin tried to trade beads, cloth, and iron for sea otter pelts, deer, and fish.<br>
<br>
The Indians, however, would trade sea otter skins only for cloth like that in the jackets of the Russian sailors, or firearms, which the Russians would not sell.<br>
<br>
After working as far north as Clayoquot Sound, the Saint Nicholas sailed south to the vicinity of Destruction Island to begin surveying the shore in latitude 47 degrees 33  north.  She had hardly begun her survey when the wind fell calm and the heavy Pacific ground swell swept her inshore, dangerously near the rocky coast, a short distance south of the mouth of the Quillayute River.  Captain Bulagin put out his anchors, but the cables chafed and parted.  The ship was thrown upon the rocky beach by a stiff on-shore wind.  She struck at high water to become a total wreck in latitude 47"56' north on November 1, 1808.<br>
<br>
The crew reached shore without losing a man.  Some arms, ammunition, tents, sails, provisions, and other goods were saved.  While they were salvaging what materials they could, the Quileute Indians stood around on the beach watching and stealing small articles when the opportunity afforded.  The Indians finally attacked the Russians with stones and spears, but faded into the underbrush when the Russians opened fire with muskets, killing two natives.<br>
<br>
Knowing the Russian ship Kodiak was to follow them south for a meeting at Grays Harbor, the survivors of the wrecked Saint Nicholas decided to attempt a journey down the coast on foot.  Accordingly, after throwing the ship's cannon and other equipment into the sea, the crew, taking their arms, ammunition, and<br>
small amount of food started  along the shore over a path pointed<br>
out to them by the Indians.
<br>
After three days of stumbling along the rocky beach detouring around promontories through almost impenetrable masses of wind-matted salal, salmonberry, and dwarf spruce, and harassed by the natives, the crew reached a river (the Hoh) too deep to ford.  On the shore was an Indian settlement of bark "shalashes" or huts.<br>
<br>
The Russians hired some of the natives to take them across in canoes.  The Indians selected two canoes, into one of which nine Russians were loaded, while into the other canoe went Anna Petrovna, wife of the captain, an Aleut native of Kodiak Island, and a young Russian.<br>
<br>
In the middle of the river the Indians pulled a plug from the bottom of the larger canoe, then jumped overboard to swim ashore.  Indians on the opposite shore attacked the canoe with spears and arrows, wounding several of the Russians, one, a man named Sovasnikof, so severely he soon died.  The canoe drifted back toward the bank from which the party had embarked.<br>
<br>
The smaller canoe was landed close to the bark huts, where Anna Petrovna, the Aleut, and the Russian boy were made prisoners.  The Russians from the larger canoe fired on the Indians with such arms as had not gotten wet in the river, killing two natives and wounding several.<br>
<br>
After the encounter the Russians withdrew to  a  small  hill  to<br>
make camp, fearful of their lives, for there were some 200 Indians opposing them.  Bulagin was overcome by the loss of his wife.  Adding to their misery, rain fell incessantly, all the muskets and ammunition were wet, provisions were exhausted, and stomachs growled with hunger.  The men searched for woods fungi, plant roots, and anything else that might serve as food.  They even ate pieces of their leather boots.<br>
<br>
In despair, Bulagin resigned leadership to Tarakanov.  On November 14, two weeks after the wreck of the Saint Nicholas, Tarakanov-also in desperation-decided to descend upon the village and fight the Indians.  The Russians found the Indians had departed.  From the huts they took as much dried salmon as they could carry and returned to the camp.<br>
<br>
A day or so later, attempting to find a route toward the mountains, Tarakanov, a hunter named Ovchinnikov, and an<br>
Aleut were ambushed by the Indians, the Aleut and Ovchinnikov being wounded by arrows.<br>
<br>
The three, however, were able to fight off the attack and return to camp.  They now gave up the idea of meeting the Kodiak on Grays
Harbor, determining instead to make their way into the mountains for a winter camp.  Hampered by the rain and dense forest, the party made way slowly, but the few Indians they met proved friendly and offered salmon for beads and other trifles.<br>
<br>
After several days of exhausting travel, the Russians were overtaken by a native from the village at the river mouth.  He came with a proposal for the ransom of Anna Petrovna, to which Bulagin readily acceded, offering virtually all the remaining property the party possessed.  But the Indians demanded four muskets in addition to the offering.<br>
<br>
This the Russians refused, whereupon Bulagin asked to see his wife.  The interview was granted.  Following an emotional meeting, Bulagin begged for her return, but the Indians would not abandon their demand for the muskets and took Anna Petrovna away.<br>
After fighting their way upriver over gravel bars and through dense woods for a few more days, the Russians built a makeshift fortified camp with a log house and sentry boxes.<br>
<br>
During the winter they also built a boat, with which on February 8, 1809, they went downriver under the guidance of an old Indian.  At the mouth of the Hoh they camped opposite the Indian village.<br>
<br>
A large number of Indians gathered around the Russians, who as a precaution captured two Indian women and a young man and held them as hostages for the release of Anna Petrovna and the others.  After a few days more natives appeared, bringing Anna Petrovna.  However, she refused to leave the Indians when the exchange was demanded.<br>
<br>
She said she had been well treated and that if she rejoined the Russians she would be compelled to wander through the forest half starved with but faint hope of rescue.  Bulagin became so enraged at her refusal to return that he threatened to shoot her, but later went away dejected and grieving.<br>
<br>
Tarakanov, hearing Anna Petrovna's story and Teaming that the other Russian captives had also been well treated, proposed to surrender to the Indians, hoping for rescue by some European ship along the coast.  Four other Russians joined him.  The rest attempted to cross to Destruction Island, but their boat was destroyed on the rocks with all the provisions lost.  The men barely escaped with their lives, only to be captured by the Indians.<br>
<br>
Tarakanov, who had surrendered himself to the Indians, was taken by a chief named Utramaka to his home near Cape Flattery, called by the Indians "Koonistchat." Bulagin was claimed by Utramaka, but was finally exchanged to the chief who held Anna Petrovna.  As was often the custom with Coast tribes, the prisoners were exchanged
from hand to hand among the Indians.<br>
<br>
Anna Petrovna died in August 1809; her Indian master at the time threw her body into the forest, as was the Indian custom.  Bulagin, hearing of her fate, sickened and died of consumption the following February.<br>
<br>
Tarakanov was well treated by the natives, largely because of his resourcefulness, his knowledge of tools, and his capability to amuse the Indians, even to constructing and flying a kite.  In September 1810 the Indians, with Tarakanov, went eastward along the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but during the winter suffered severely for want of food.  On May 6, 1811, a brig came to anchor near the Indian camp.<br>
<br>
Tarakanov and his Indian master went on board, where they learned the vessel was the American Lydia under command of a Captain Brown, who soon set about ransoming the Indians' prisoners.<br>
Among the prisoners brought aboard was an Englishman, John Williams, who was ransomed for five measures of cloth, a locksmith's saw, two steel knives,. a looking glass, five packages of powder, and five bags of shot.<br>
<br>
The Indians accepted the same ransom for each of the Russians except for Bolotof and Kurmachof, for whom higher ransom was demanded.  Refused, the Indians took them away.  Captain Brown then seized a chief who came aboard, and held him hostage for delivery of the remaining Russian captives.  All were brought within a few days.<br>
<br>
Thirteen captives were successfully ransomed; seven had died in captivity, while one Aleut was later ransomed on the Columbia River by the American ship Mercury.  One Russian named Philip Kotilnikof had been traded away so far he could not be found.  The Lydia sailed May 10, 1811, from the Strait to Sitka, arriving June 8, 1811.<br>
<br>
There is no record of the Kodiak's calling on Grays Harbor, whether because of a change of plans, or because her master Kouskov had learned of the Saint Nicholas disaster and reasoned that it would be useless to attempt the rendezvous.<br>

ST. NICHOLAS.<br>

Lucile McDonald, "The wreck of the St. Nicholas," <B>The Sea Chest.</B> XXVI (March, 1993), p. 132-135.<br>
<br>
The Northwest Coast encouraged fur traders of other nations to increase their activities, but their visits to Washington were limited to Tatoosh Island and the mouth of the Columbia.  The first vessel to winter in The latter place was the brig PHOENIX of Bengal.  Captain Moore, not satisfied with the cargo he had secured in the 1794 season, remained over until early the following May in the river mouth.<br>
<br>
Both the JENNY and the 110-ton RUBY returned, the former in 1794 and the latter in 1795.  Before leaving, some of the RUBY's crew planted a vegetable garden on a small island, expecting to come back and profit from a supply of fresh food.  This was the initial horticultural venture on the Columbia, only the planting at Neah Bay preceding it in Washington State.<br>
<br>
The island cleared by Captain Charles Bishop's men and called by them "Tree Island,- has since been eroded.  His log mentioned the sowing of peas, beans, potatoes, radishes, mustard, cresses and "sallery seeds." When he returned in the fall few traces remained of the garden, and he concluded birds might have eaten some of the seeds.<br>
<br>
Departing on January 23, he wrote in his log: When weighed anchor, came in sight of the bar on which sea raged in large white sheet waves with fearful violence, extending quite from side to side without the least appearance of a channel.  It was too late to recede.  We were in the strong ebb tide with the wind right out.<br>
<br>
Everything was well lashed on deck and secured from being washed overboard and every man was at his station with a good rope in his hand for the like purpose ... the sea was tremendous beyond description and so fast and so fierce did it role [sic] that before one had passed another would insult the ship, several breaking over us half way up the masts.  Nothing remained but to hold fast ... in a quarter of an hour we had passed the worst of it and in a short time got into smoother water.<br>
<br>
Indians watched from the cape and Bishop noted: As soon as we were safe, guns were fired as a farewell salute to them.<br>
<br>
Other traders came into Baker's Bay.  A member of the crew of an American ship wintering there left his name carved on a tree near the water:<br>
<br>
H.  Thompson,ship  Guatimozin of Boston, February 20, 1804.<br>
<br>
Lewis and Clark's overland expedition arrived at the mouth of the Columbia in November, 1805, and made the first land map of Cape
Disappointment and its environs, including North Head.<br>
<br>
Despite these visitors, the Washington coast remained almost unknown territory.  There may have been good reasons for sailing vessels to stay well away from it.  La Perouse wrote in 1786 when he passed southbound with the French frigates BOUSSOLE and ASTROLABE:<br>
<br>
The currents on this part of the coast are extremely violent; we fell in with eddies which did not suffer the ship to obey her helm with a three[sic] knot gale five leagues from land.<br>
<br>
The first recorded shipwreck on the Washington shore was a Russian trading ship from Sitka.  This does not mean she was the initial vessel to meet her fate on the coast.  Prior to the coming of white men there are indications of wrecked oriental junks.  Occasionally mysterious large clay jars and jugs for food storage have been uncovered near Long Beach and Copalis.<br>
<br>
Apparently, as long-sunken craft disintegrated, they released primitive containers that held rice, wine, preserved fruits and pickled conserves.  Archaeologists placed some as being at least 200 years old, but pieces of metal found in diggings at Ozette and used as tools 500 years ago are believed to have come from vessels that drifted eastward across the Pacific to final destruction on the inhospitable shore.<br>
<br>
As late as 1834 a Japanese junk [sic] went down off Cape Flattery.  Makah Indians picked up three of the sailors who survived and turned them over to a British ship.<br>
<br>
The wreck of the ST.  NICHOLAS on November 1, 1808, south of the Quillayute River long remained a mystery.  Legendary tales about the vessel and an unknown white woman among her survivors were circulated by Indians, who gained the impression that it was a Spanish craft.<br>
<br>
They knew she had come ashore about four miles south of the river on the long point of Pinnacle Rocks, but it was not until 1916 that C.L. Andrews, Washington historian, discovered the key to the vessel's identity in the territorial library in Juneau, Alaska.<br>
<br>
Timothy Tarakanof, supercargo, related the story of the voyage in a manuscript preserved in the archives of the Russian American Co. at Sitka.  The ST. NICHOLAS departed from that place (then known as New Archangel) on September 8,1808, and traded for sea otter skins along the coast of Vancouver Island in October, then moved over toward Destruction Island, where she was becalmed and carried by swells among the reefs.<br>
<br>
A southeast gale arising, the ship was thrown on the beach, striking at high tide on November 1, at Pinnacle Rocks near the mouth of the Quillayute River.
The crew reached shore safely, managing also to bring arms, ammunition, tents, sails, provisions, and other goods from the wreck, but while they still were salvaging materials Indians attacked with stones and spears.  Russian musket fire drove them away and two Indians were killed.<br>
<br>
Prior to leaving Sitka, the ST.  NICHOLAS had arranged a rendezvous with another Russian craft, the KODIAK, at Grays Harbor, so the crew set out by land for this place.  They threw the ship's cannon into the sea, packed food for the journey and proceeded on foot along the difficult shore.<br>
<br>
Quillayutes they met showed them a route through the forest to Grays Harbor and after three frightening days during which they were harassed by Indians, they reached the Hoh River, which was too deep to ford.  At a bark hut camp on the bank they hired men to ferry them in two canoes.  Nine were crammed into one canoe while Anna, the captain's wife, a Kodiak native, an Aleut and a young Russian were in the other.  Midway across the stream the Indians pulled a plug in the bottom of the larger canoe, leaped overboard and swam ashore while fellow tribesmen showered spears and arrows on the whites.<br>
<br>
The larger canoe drifted toward shore and the Russians landed, some of them wounded.  Meanwhile Anna and her companions in the smaller canoe were made prisoners.  The Russians fired several muskets which were still dry, killing two Indians and wounding another.  One Russian was injured fatally in the skirmish.<br>
<br>
The men of the ST.  NICHOLAS retired to a small hill and camped for the night in mortal fear, knowing that at least 200 Indians opposed them.  Captain Nikolas Bulagin was frantic with worry about his wife.<br>
<br>
As the days passed and they still were in this beleaguered spot, Olympic Peninsula rain drenched them continuously.  Their muskets could not be kept dry and their provisions were exhausted.  The hungry men searched for mushrooms, roots and fungi and gnawed the soles of their shoes and the sea-lion-skin throats used in making their waterproof kamlinkas (shirts).<br>
<br>
Bulagin resigned leadership in favor of Tarakanof, who on November 14 led a desperate attack on the river huts.  They found the Indians gone, but the raid netted a supply of food in the form of dried salmon.<br>
<br>
Shortly afterward, Tarakanof, with two companions, scouted toward the Olympic range for another escape route, but he was ambushed and his two followers were wounded.  On their return to camp, they decided to give up the plan for reaching Grays Harbor and agreed to build a winter camp on a lake they had heard of in the mountains near the headwaters of the river.
Enroute to this place they encountered friendly Indians, who exchanged salmon for trifles.  Several days later a Quillayute emissary met them, bringing a proposal that the Russians ransom Anna.  Bulagin offered virtually all the remaining property for his wife, but the natives demanded four muskets in addition, which the Russians could not spare.<br>
<br>
Bulagin then asked to see his wife and the interview was granted.  The captain begged her to return, but as the ransom was not reduced, the savages took her away with them.<br>
<br>
The Russians struggled on a few more days, then built a square log house with comer sentry boxes.  Here they spent the winter, occupying themselves with building a boat on which they returned down river.  At the mouth of the Hoh they stopped on the opposite side from where Anna had been captured and resumed negotiations for her freedom, first taking the precaution of picking up two Indian girls and a youth for hostages.  At length, the tribesmen produced Anna, but the account said:<br>
<br>
When the exchange was demanded, Anna refused to leave, saying she was well-treated and well-fed.<br>
<br>
Bulagin first was furious at her refusal to return and threatened to shoot her, but afterward went away dejected with grief.<br>
<br>
Having seen that the other group had not been ill-treated by the Indians, Tarakanof proposed surrendering to them, trusting that a European ship ultimately would come to the rescue.  He and four others gave themselves up, while the remainder attempted to reach Destruction Island.  Their boat went on the rocks, they lost their provisions and were captured.<br>
<br>
A chief named Utramaka took Tarakanof to his winter home near Cape Flattery.  Bulagin went with another master, but the prisoners appear to have been exchanged several times.<br>
<br>
Anna died in August, 1809, and her owner threw her body into the forest, to the grief of the Russians.  Her husband, hearing her fate, pined away of tuberculosis in February.<br>
<br>
Tarakanof exercised his ingenuity to keep in good standing, and among the favors granted him was a hut of his own.  He constructed and flew a kite which caused the Indians to believe the Russians could reach the sky.<br>
<br>
In September, 1810, the remaining Russians went east up the Strait of Juan de Fuca, putting in an extremely cold and hungry winter.  The following year the American brig LYDIA anchored near, and Tarakanof, boarding her, arranged to be ransomed.  Captain Brown
paid five measures of cloth, a locksmith's saw, two steel knives, one mirror, five packages of powder and five bags of shot for each of the men except two for whom the Indians demanded greater pay.<br>
<br>
When this was refused the two were taken away by the Indians.  A third Russian already had been removed by them to Destruction Island.  In order to force the natives' hand, Brown seized a chief and held him until the three remaining captives were brought in.<br>
<br>
Of the crew of the ST.  NICHOLAS, 13 were ransomed and returned to Sitka in June, 1811, seven died in captivity and one Aleut later was ransomed on the Columbia River by another American vessel, the MERCURY.  One Russian, Philip Kotlinikof, remained with the Indians, having been taken so far away he could not be found.<br>

WRECK OF THE ST.  NICHOLAS<br>
<br>
James A. Gibbs, "Wreck of the St. Nicholas," <B>Shipwrecks Off Juan de Fuca.</B> Portland: Binfords and Mort, Publishers, 1968. p. 2-13.<br>
<br>
One of the earliest recorded shipwrecks on Pacific Northwest shores was that of the Russian brig St.Nicholas, gored by rocks south of Juan de Fuca in 1808.  The castaways were traded among the Indian tribes and many ended up among the Makahs who inhabited the lands around Cape Flattery.  Among the survivors was Anna Petrovna, the first white woman to set foot on the Northwest Coast.<br>
<br>
She was an attractive, adventure-loving lady and the wife of Captain Nikolai Bulygin, master of the St. Nicholas just how she managed to become part of this Russian expedition organized at New Archangel (Sitka), in the fall of that fatal year, was never fully determined but her persuasive ways with Russian nobility and her husband's insistence that his bride he allowed to go along evidently secured for her a berth as a passenger.  Had not Bulygin been held in such high respect as a naval officer, his request would probably have been refused.<br>
<br>
For eighteen-year-old Anna, however, it was to he the highlight of her young life; at least she thought so at the beginning of the voyage.  Bulygin was deeply in love with his young bride; nor did he doubt for her safety as he had great confidence in himself as a navigator despite the little-known shores for which the expedition was destined.<br>
<br>
The purpose of the voyage was to locate a site for a fort in the
Columbia River area.  With relatively few men, the Russians had within a few decades settled Alaska and planned colonization as far south as California and also in Hawaii.  In short, they were challenging the Spanish power in the Pacific.<br>
<br>
While Bulygin was in charge of the voyage, Timothy (Timofei) Tarakanov was given chief responsibility for the land part of the expedition, and he also served as the ship's supercargo.  He was one of Baranof's most trusted men, an experienced soldier who had been with the garrison of the initial fort constructed at New Archangel, capital of Russian America in 1799.<br>
<br>
Tarakanov had miraculously escaped death in the revenge-inspired uprising of the Tlingits in 1802.  He had been taken captive and made to witness the death by torture of two of his comrades.  He would have suffered a similar fate had he not been rescued by Captain Henry Barber of the British ship Unicorn, assisted by an American, Captain John Ebbets.<br>
<br>
Tarakanov, the genuine Russian frontiersman, had learned the language of the Tlingits and studied their ways, at the same time becoming a good friend of the Aleuts, who often took him on their fishing voyages.<br>
<br>
Bulygin's expedition left New Archangel at about the same time that Ivan Kuskov and his men in the ship Kodiak set out to survey a location for a fort in Northern California.  The two parties were later to rendezvous at Grays Harbor.  The St. Nicholas carried a complement of twenty persons, seventeen men including four Aleuts, plus three women, Anna Petrovna and two Aleut squaws.  The Aleuts were taken along because of their ability to converse and trade with the natives along the Northwest Coast.<br>
<br>
Captain Bulygin was supplied with copies of Captain George Vancouver's charts and his command was a fine here 200-ton, Yankee-built sailer.  He anticipated a routine expedition, dis-
counting any thoughts of trouble along the way.<br>
<br>
As the St. Nicholas took to the open sea, the first anchorages were made in little coves indenting the Queen Charlotte Islands, where the Aleuts proved invaluable in s@g up trade with the natives.  The officers made brief land explorations and crude<br>
charts of each area they visited.<br>
<br>
The St. Nicholas fired her gun when in sight of native totem Poles at the small settlements along the way.  Before she could drop her hook, the natives would come out by the score in their graceful canoes, eager to trade otter skins which would more than pay the cost of the expedition.  The crew were on shares and their craftiness and cunning in trading could assure a profitable voyage.<br>
<br>
The voyage continued on down the west coast of Vancouver Island, the weather holding good most of the way.  Tarakanov, who was wise
in the ways of the natives, would only allow three aboard at a time as he was aware of their sometimes hostile reputation.<br>
<br>
As the brig approached the latitudes of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the favorable weather suddenly came to a Halt.  Gales began blowing out of the South, making irascible seas that hampered the progress of the craft.  Under shortened sail the vessel tacked off the strait entrance, unable to get inside.<br>
<br>
When the wind finally subsided, a great gray mantle of fog draped itself across the deceptive entrance and Bulygin wisely stood offshore, setting a southerly course.<br>
<br>
One night in late October, the St. Nicholas reached latitude 170 56' north, in the vicinity of Destruction Island.  There was a dead calm and the canvas hung limp.  While the crew was engaged in sounding, the officers sketched the shoreline and surrounding landmarks.  The current was strong and the shore pockmarked with hidden rocks.<br>
<br>
So engrossed were all bands in their duties that little attention was paid to a southeast gale in the making.  The traditional calm before the storm had deceived them and almost before they knew it, the St. Nicholas was in trouble.  Though Bulygin ordered more canvas, contrary winds were against him.  The vessel would not respond but was swept ever closer to destruction-carried northward like a piece of drift in a swift river.<br>
<br>
In an effort to halt the shoreward drift, Bulygin ordered all three anchors dropped.  The men, in desperation, were quick to<br>
respond, but despite the dragging of the hooks, the vessel was drawn as though by a magnet.  The strain caused one of the hal-
yards to snap, and some of the sails were blown to ribbons.  The anchor cables, snagged on sharp rocks just under the surface, held for a brief moment and then snapped.<br>
<br>
Throughout  the  black  night  the  vessel  was  flung  against   one barrier after another, twisting and heaving like an unarmed animal to escape a relentless pursuer.  It was so dark that none of the pitiful band could see two feet in front of them.  The sea, the beach, the trees, and the lofty mountains, all had become invisible, and the feeble oil lamps aboard the vessel had flickered into nothingness.  The panic-stricken complement awaited the end.<br>
<br>
Miraculously the ship weathered the night and when the sickly dawn of November I finally broke over the jagged Olympics, the vessel, with her holds full of water, was impaled on a rocky crag jutting out from the mainland, a little south of the mouth of the Quillayute River.<br>
<br>
Bulygin knew that, in 1787, between their present location and the
Hob River, a boat crew from the East India ship imperial Eagle, while seeking fresh water, was massacred by the natives.  Bulygin was concerned for his own wife and party.  After surveying his ship's punctured hull and the tangled mass of wreckage on her decks, he ordered his comrades to abandon ship and set up camp on the beach.<br>
<br>
The seas had calmed and the survivors managed to struggle through the surf while a pelting rain added to their miseries.  Later they removed what they could from the wreck.  That night they slept, exhausted, among the salvaged goods that lay on the beach.<br>
<br>
The following morning Tarakanov and Bulygin discussed their chances of survival.  Both were hopeful that they could traVerse the seventy miles between their location and Grays Harbor for an eventual rendezvous with Kuskov.  Guns were issued and feeble shelters assembled.  All hands had been warned of the danger of hostile natives and a sharp lookout was maintained day and<br>
night Bulygin and his beloved Anna stayed close together and, despite the misery, the young Russian girl remained undaunted.<br>
<br>
Now ashore, Tarakanov's role became more prominent.<br>
<br>
He was a hunter, a carpenter, and a metal worker, and was wise in the ways of the natives; furthermore he had the utmost respect of the Aleuts.  He had studied available notes on coastal exploration and was aware of John Meares' report of July 1788, telling of the location of a stockaded Indian village near the vicinity where they had been cast ashore.<br>
<br>
It was referred to as the village of Queenhithe and was situated on a high, perpendicular rock joined by a narrow and impregnable causeway-leading to a great forest, a natural barrier against the enemy.<br>
<br>
Indeed it was not long before the Russian sentries reported seeing half-naked, bare footed natives curiously staring at their en-
campment.<br>
<br>
Tarakanov, seeing that the savages carried spears but no guns, endeavored to converse with them.  They were Quillayute Indians, more primitive than the Tlingits, but they spoke a language not too far divorced from the northern Indians, permitting partial understanding.  Among them was a chief who insisted his men were only curious, not hostile.  Momentarily the barriers were let down, and at a sign from the Indian chief, many ascended from the forests.<br>
<br>
They invaded the camp, curiously eyeing the people from the sea and especially the golden-haired, blue-eyed Anna Petrovna.  To them she was like a goddess from another world; they wanted to touch her strange, fair hair much to the annoyance of Bulygin.<br>
<br>
The natives greedily pawed over the salvaged goods.  Tarakanov had
warned his men against providing them, but when they began dragging some of the goods into the forest, tempers flared and some of the Russians struck the invaders.  Suddenly mayhem broke out, and the outnumbered Russians found themselves amid a bail of flying spears and stones.<br>
<br>
Tarakanov was knocked to the ground, and Bulygin was bleeding.  Guns were fired, killing three natives outright; others fled to the tall timber.<br>
<br>
Fearing for his wife, early the next morning Bulygin insisted that the party begin their seventy-mile trek to Grays Harbor as soon as possible.  The injured were patched up and for the rear guard, others continued the remainder of that day, while some salvage items which could he taken with them on foot.  The St. Nicholas was beyond repair and the only hope of survival was by land-and a rendezvous in December with Kuskov.<br>
<br>
The following day every man was issued two muskets and a pistol, while slings were made in which to carry gunpowder.  Both men and women were clothed in the warmest skins and parkas available for the long journey.  Each of the women was also given food and supplies to carry.  One of the last acts before abandoning camp was to destroy everything from the wreck that the Indians might use as a weapon against them.<br>
<br>
Even as the procession moved southward along the beach, an angry powwow was being held at the nearby village.  The Indians were pledging revenge for their murdered brothers, but despite their anger they had not forgotten the golden-haired Anna.  Already they were discussing the terms of the fancy price she would bring as a slave.<br>
<br>
When they arrived on the beach in large numbers natives fanned out about stalking the southward trek of the Russians.  They kept their distance but occasionally would harass the band with a stone or a spear.  Bulygin and his comrades were in constant fear of an all-out attack but burdened as they were did not fire.  They kept away from the forest and lived, ate, and slept on the beach until, in the midst of a driving rain on November 7, they reached the Hoh River-an impasse.<br>
<br>
They would have to have boats to ford the swollen stream.  The wise natives had taken this into consideration at their council and here they would have their revenge.  The natives on the opposite side of the river had already been alerted.  Tarakanov was unaware that among the some two hundred Indians on both sides of the river were several members of the band who had visited their camp.<br>
<br>
He caped across the river and the natives responded by bringing two canoes over to him.  It would take several trips to get the entire party 'and their gear across the river.  Both Bulygin and
Tarakanov-on whom Bulygin was becoming increasingly dependent decided they would cross over last.<br>
<br>
Anna and the two Aleut women, along with a young Russian student, Fillip Kotelnikov, went over in a small canoe with a single Indian paddler.  Nine men with two Indian paddlers followed in the larger craft, their muskets loaded and ready to protect the women when they reached the opposite shore.<br>
<br>
In midstream the Indians pulled plugs from the bottom of the larger canoe and leaped overboard, leaving the men virtually helpless.  Once again a volley of spears and arrows whizzed over, around, and into the Russians, who tried in vain to paddle against the rising water.  Their muskets and powder were soaked and they could not fire back at their attackers.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the Indians rushed into the stream and seized the women and ushered them off into the forest as treasured prizes.<br>
<br>
Suddenly there was a terrible scream from the sinking canoe as one of the Russians was bit in the groin with a spear.  The others too were wounded but leaped from the boat and struggled to the river bank from which they had come.  Cursing, the Russians picked up the dry muskets and fired, bringing down two natives on the opposite bank of the river.<br>
<br>
Their badly wounded comrade, pulled from the water, soon died in terrible pain.  Bulygin seemed to go to pieces-they had his wife captive and the men were helpless to act.  Most of their supplies and armament were gone.<br>
<br>
Hastily the Russians collected what guns they could and prepared for the next encounter with the savages.  Meanwhile the Indians had gone upriver and crossed back over, intending to massacre the intruders.  All the while rain fell in torrents.<br>
<br>
Soon the natives approached, two of them with guns, and the battle resumed.  The Russians fought with vengeance, making every shot count.  Presently the savages retreated and there was a temporary lull in the battle.  The Russians used the break to seek shelter in the forest; most of them were suffering from injuries.<br>
<br>
Along the way one of their number, writhing in pain from an arrowhead in his stomach, begged to he left behind to die.  So Khariton Sobachnikov was abandoned at his own request and his friends hurried deeper into the forest for protection and food.  Despite their wounds they struggled on, farther and farther away from the sea.<br>
<br>
They became exhausted, desperate, and famished. A faithful dog that had remained with them became an evening meal.<br>
<br>
Finally another of their number joined Sobachnikov in death.  By the time they had reached the high country in the shadow of the
Olympics, Bulygin had asked Tarakanov to head the party.  Tarakanov got the word in writing and the men voted to go along with the plan.  The rendezvous with Kuskov could not now he made, and the men resigned themselves to a winter of hardship on the upper Hob River.<br>
<br>
As they neared their intended encampment they met two Indians who, claiming friendship, offered to sell them whale blubber.  They also asked what ransom would he paid for the white lady.  Bulygin over joyed, offered everything they possessed including their guns and the epaulets on his tattered uniform.  But first he would have to see Anna.  Then they would decide.<br>
<br>
A meeting place was arranged.  Anna was brought upriver and the Russian party went downriver, but the rendezvous was on opposite banks.  Amid mutual tears Bulygin and his wife talked back and forth across the stream.  She assured him that she was unharmed and had been treated well.  Bulygin begged his comrades to give the Indians what they wanted that he might get his wife back, but they knew if they surrendered their guns they had no chance of survival.<br>
<br>
Bulygin begged, but the wiser Tarakanov would do was to offer the demanding chiefs one damaged rifle, whereas they wanted four.  Dissatisfied, they took Anna away, and the Russians went back upriver for long, hard weeks of survival in the mountain foothills.<br>
<br>
It was not until ten months later that they abandoned their isolated home.  In February 1809, they came back downriver, this time in a crude river boat they had constructed at their campsite.  They planned to cross the Quillayute River bar and go out to Destruction Island to keep a vigil for a passing ship, or take their chances in going to the Columbia River.<br>
<br>
The building of the boat had helped Bulygin come out of his despondency, and Tarakanov gave him command on the downriver trip Bulygin supported the plan to get back to civilization until they got near the river mouth; then his burning desire to find his wife changed his mind.<br>
<br>
The men, however, did not want to risk another battle with the savages.  Bulygin finally prevailed and mapped a plan for cap@g two natives and holding them for ransom until Anna was returned. (One report claimed that two native women were captured, another, a man and a woman.) The father of one of these natives was of considerable importance in the tribe and begged for a few days' time in which to produce the white woman.  He said she had been traded to a chief of the Makahs at Cape Flattery.<br>
<br>
The Russians agreed, setting up a breastwork on a side hill with
their captives.  There they impatiently waited.  Finally, on the eighth day, they were informed that a party of Makahs were a mile downstream awaiting a parley.  There were fifteen of them including tribal chief Utramaka.  Anna was with them.<br>
<br>
Tarakanov was to he spokesman, while the excited Bulygin remained at the breastwork. The chief was dressed in European clothes with a fur cap which he had acquired from a shipwreck, or through trading with fur buyers.<br>
<br>
Tarakanov was startled to see that Anna was as beautiful as ever.  She appeared in good health, was well dressed, and was wearing moccasins.  Her golden hair was neatly groomed and she appeared in excellent spirits-undoubtedly the favorite wife of the chief.  She informed Tarakanov that she had no intention of relinquishing her role for one of suffering and privation.<br>
<br>
Instead she pleaded with Tarakanov to tell her husband and the others to give themselves up to the Makahs; she said they would he treated kindly as she had been and that ships would eventually come to the Cape Flattery area to ransom them.<br>
<br>
Tarakanov returned to the breastwork to inform Bulygin.  On hearing the report, Bulygin fell to his knees sobbing.  He begged Tarakanov to speak again with Anna.  But Anna remained <B>firm; </B>she no longer feared death nor the threats of her husband. Again Tarakanov returned to his camp to impart the final word<br>
to Bulygin, who, now in despair, began sobbing afresh and would not he consoled.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Tarakanov had considered Anna's advice and decided that it might he the only way to survive. In the discussion that followed, some of the men sided with Tarakanov but others elected to continue on with the boat.  Each man was allowed to make his own decision, and the favored report is that Bulygin finally sided in with Tarakanov.  The two groups separated peacefully, each wishing the other God's help.<br>
<br>
On the following day the Indian captives were returned and the Makah chief assured Tarakanov that his men, if they surrendered, would he treated as Anna had said.  After Tarakanov and his followers had departed with the Makahs, the others launched their boat and made a run across the river bar toward Destruction Island.  A strong wind prevailed and en route the boat was carried on the rocks and capsized.<br>
<br>
The men were thrown into the vortex and all their provisions lost.  Pursuing Indian canoes plucked them from the water and took them captive.  This time there was no escape and all the remaining Rus-
sians w ere now in the hands of the natives.  The Quillayutes sold one Russian and an Aleut to Indians on the Columbia River and the others to Makahs.<br>
<br>
Tarakanov was taken to a village near Cape Flattery called
Koonistchat and Bulygin was delivered to a village at Ozette.  At first all the captives were well treated but the fickle Indians<br>
soon tired of their charges and began trading them about from one tribe to another.<br>
<br>
Only Anna and Tarakanov remained with their original owners.  The latter had become indispensable because of his skill in making tools, knives, and toys; he even invented a signal for warning the tribe of battle.  Meanwhile months passed and no ships came.<br>
<br>
Then, one sad day, Anna was traded to another and became the property of a cruel and demanding chief.  Her dignity and spirit finally broke, and she is believed to have committed suicide.  The chief to whom she belonged had her body dragged into the forest and left there without burial.<br>
<br>
When the tragic news reached Bulygin, he had lost his will to live and in February of the following year, in poor health, he too died; but not Tarakanov.  He never gave up hope and with the knowledge that the season was near when the ships sailing from New Archangel would he passing off the entrance to the strait, he devised a crude kite and told the natives that he was sending messages to the great white father.  They were so impressed that some thought he should he a chief; his kite could even top the fog banks.<br>
<br>
Finally in May of 1810, the Boston brig Lydia, skippered by Captain J. Brown, entered the strait and anchored off Neah Bay Tarakanov managed to get aboard, only to meet his comrade  Afanasi<br>
Valgusov, one of his old shipmates who had been ransomed from a tribe on the Columbia.  Valgusov told Tarakanov that one of the Aleuts from the St. Nicholas had also been rescued earlier by Captain George Ayers of the Mercury.<br>
<br>
For each captive of the Russian ship, the master of the Lydia offered the Indian chiefs five blankets, twelve yards of cloth, a saw, a mirror, two knives, live bags of powder, and five of shot.  Within a few days, gaunt survivors straggled in.<br>
<br>
Some of the chiefs tried to hold out for more ransom but the captain put an end to this practice by seizing one of their number and putting him in irons.  In short order the original agreement was adhered to and most of the survivors were freed.  There was great rejoicing at New Archangel on their return.<br>
<br>
Of the original twenty who sailed aboard the St. Nicholas under Captain Bulygin, all but seven survived-each with his own tale to tell of fear and sufferings in a raw wilderness among savage natives.<br>

Indians Loved The Black Explorer York<br>
by Dorothy McWilliams<br>
<br>
In the autumn of 1805 a small party of explorers reached the Pacific Ocean by land. Their journey had begun at St. Louis, Mo., and ended at the mouth of the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest. Of all the glorious adventures told of western heroes, no story is more exciting than that of the Lewis and Clark expedition. The "Corps of Discovery," as the group was called, consisted of two leaders, Captains Meriwether Lewis and William<br>
Clark; three sergeants; 23 soldiers; two French interpreters; a woman and her baby; and a Negro, the bondservant of Capt. Clark. The leaders and Sacajawea, the Indian woman, have been remembered in stories and by statues, but it was the intensely black Negro, York, who was the most popular and best remembered by the Indians.<br>
<br>
Although all members of the expedition were liked, none was so royally welcomed by the tribes as York. In a time when many Indians had never before seen a white man, a black man was still more of an oddity. York was young, large and handsome. He was a smiling; understanding, and pleasant person. His popularity was, in part, due to his pigmentation. With moistened fingers, the Indians rubbed his skin, wondering if he was not painted. They yanked his hair to see if it was really his own. Some of the bolder Indians asked him if he had really been born black. But even though he arrived as an oddity, York departed each village as a friend.<br>
<br>
Several times, both Lewis and Clark used the Indians' natural curiosity about a black man to gain help. When the expedition needed horses from the Shoshone tribe, Lewis was able to interest them in a trade only by telling the chief he would be shown a blackskinned man. As it turned out, Sacajawea was the chief's sister, so the trade was easily completed.<br>
<br>
There was more than York's color that made him so successful with the Indians. He, alone, could understand that the patterns by which the Indians lived had great importance to them. He could help the leaders see that Indian ways ought not be trespassed upon by "foreigners" who were just passing through their lands. York had the ability to settle any problems with Indians quickly and quietly by treating them as equals, no more - no less.<br>
<br>
Some historians have called the Lewis and Clark Expedition "The Dancing Explorers" and "The Road Show". It is true that singing and dancing were popular, both with the explorers and the Indians.<br>
<br>
A violin was packed even when food, medicine and guns had to be left behind.<br>

When the camp fiddler struck up a merry tune, York's dancing never failed to please. Once, however, when he performed for the Teton Sioux, York became so carried away by their applause that he, started dancing on his hands. This action made the usually tolerant Capt. Clark frown sternly.<br>
<br>
As a wilderness explorer, York was without flaw. He was an excellent shot, one of the strongest when it came to pulling or carrying, and, so the men wrote, by far the best cook in the outfit. He was often chosen to accompany the leaders when a small group explored a new river. He was with Clark and four others when the Willamette River in Oregon was first explored.<br>
<br>
There is no indication that York suffered any abuse from other members of the party. Each member depended on the others for safety and survival. At times the captains turned the party into a committee-of-the-whole when everyone's opinion was heard. York and  Sacajawea had their say then and were included in the voting, the same as any other member. A replacement for Sgt. Charles Floyd, who died of an apparent ruptured appendix, was elected in this way.<br>
<br>
Not much is known of what happened in later years to some of the expedition members. About York we know even less. This is because writers in the early 1800s had little interest in the accomplishments of a black man. All that is known for sure is that, of all the men among the "Elkskin Trailblazers", York was the only one not rewarded in some way by the U.S.<br>
<br>
In recent times research has been done to try to learn more about York, which is the only name we have for Clark's slave. What has been found may not be fact, but evidence indicates that shortly after Capt. Clark married Julia Hancock, York was given his freedom. The captain is supposed to have bought wagons and mules and set York up in the freight business, hauling goods between Nashville, Tenn., and Richmond, Va. It seems that after a few years, the former slave left the business.<br>
<br>
Some writers say York rejoined Capt. Clark and died in Missouri. Other writers say that rumors brought back to the settlements along the Missouri River told of a black man "having the time of his life" as chief of a Comanche tribe which roamed the Great Plains.<br>
<br>
No matter how the first black visitor to Washington ended his days, the indians here and all along his route affectionately remembered the "Great White Father's" black ambassador, York.<br>

A CAPTAIN USUALLY GOT HIS CREW IN PORT TOWNSEND<br>
<br>
(Lucile McDonald, "A captain usually got his crew in Port Townsend's uninhibited past," <B>Seattle Times.</B> September 9, 1962.)<br>
<br>
A long with its recent efforts at civic rejuvenation, the city of Port Townsend has become shanghai conscious. Not only have road signs advertised that the nefarious traffic once flourished on the water front, but a new book, "Shanghaiing Days," by a San Francisco author, Richard H. Dillon, cites facts and names from Port Townsend's uninhibited past.<br>
<br>
Dillon's source largely was in files of the Coast Seamen's Journal in the 1890s. Several residents of the city still recall incidents of which the author speaks and records in the Jefferson County Court House add the stamp of veracity to the stories.<br>
<br>
A plant in the county surveyor's office shows the waterfront of 1871, with its several wharves extending into the harbor and lodging houses and bars built on the approaches, supported on pilings.<br>
<br>
Some of the brick buildings on the main street had rear exist a little above high tide level on the beach to facilitate moving of cargo rowed ashore from sailing vessels or towed in on scows. If these doors were used for less conventional business, such as the hustling away of stupefied sailors, it was not surprising.<br>
<br>
The practice of shanghaiing was regarded as essential to the manning of ships in a day when going to sea was one of the least pleasant ways of earning a living.<br>
<br>
John Lewis, 77, who was in the shipping business from his youth, lives within sight of the roadstead where vessels used to drop ballast and await crews.  His father, Wyndham Lewis, arrived in Port Townsend in 1888 and became partner in a shipping agency with
Oscar Klocker, Norwegian born vice consul for Great  Britain.<br>
<br>
Klocker is on Dillon's list of those with a hand in the shanghaiing business. Lewis says that Klocker's activities included making deals with his father's business competitors and this reached a point where the partnership had to be broken up.  Wyndham Lewis bought out Klocker's interest.<br>
<br>
The connection, however, gave young Jack Lewis an insight into many aspects of manning ships. Seamen reported at a long counter in the firm's office upstairs in the C.C. Bailey Building to have ship's articles read to them, so that they understood where they were bound and what pay they were to receive.<br>
<br>
"At least ten per cent in those days, went on board without the reading of any articles, " Lewis said. "Sometimes men who did go through the formality were forced into it. Boarding runners carried blackjacks and I would see them on the stairs beating men on the head. We tried to bar the runners from coming up to our office.<br>
<br>
"We lived in the white house below my present home and I remember men arriving at all hours of the night to tell  Father they did not want to go to sea. If he learned they had been shanghaied in Tacoma  or some other port, sometimes he would help them get away to a ranch near Chimacum from which they could find the way home on foot.<br>
<br>
"Many boats from the Upper Sound anchored here until their crews were filled up. Klocker would get out, which he was not supposed to do, and sign on men brought down by other boats. They'd be enticed off one ship with promises only to be shifted to another bark."<br>
<br>
Master practitioners in the shanghai art were Maxwell Levy and Ed Sims, also listed in the Dillon book. One old resident believes they arrived in Port Townsend about 1885 expressly to engage in the boarding house business for the purpose of supplying ships.<br>
<br>
Max kept close watch on the establishment while Ed had other fish to fry. Their boarding house was on the waterfront in a brick building on directly across from the City Hall.<br>
<br>
"I once used that building," related Lockhart. "The water came to the back end of it and a dock went out behind. They didn't need any tunnels to carry men out there. A door went from the basement to the beach, but it was easier to take fellows out to the dock.<br>
<br>
"There were no engines in the small boats that went to the ships. The boarding houses had strong young fellows to pull the oars. They could come and go quietly enough."<br>
<br>
Harry Cotten says early in the morning after his arrival in town in 1903 he saw shanghaiing done in plain daylight. Two men were dragging a third to a boat on the beach. Cotton asked if he were dead and was told, "No, Knockout drops."
"Isn't shanghaiing against the law?" he asked.<br>
<br>
He received a profane answer to the effect that there was no low in this country.<br>
<br>
Cotton appealed to a police man a block away. "He took a big chaw from his tobacco and told me it was none of my business.  Acquaintances to whom I reported this encounter warned me, ' You'd better pay attention to what he said.'<br>
<br>
"There were twenty-seven sailing ships in the bay that day and they were buying sailors."<br>
<br>
Lockhart recalled that runners usually were careful not to pick up town boys in the shanghai net. "But if fellows got a little wild and went to the wrong part of town, sometimes they disappeared and next thing the family would receive a letter from Australia."<br>
<br>
The tale is told of a certain resident who could not resist a drink. One day he went up Water Street on an errand and did not return home for a year. It became a habit with him and for about fifteen more years in the 18802 and 1890s whenever he did get back to Port Townsend, sooner or later he would wake up again on a ship off Cape Flattery.<br>
<br>
Lewis remembers when seventeen saloons were on the harbor side alone of Water Street. Large sections of blocks on the 1891 map were labeled "female houses." The approximately 350 women available to entertain the seafaring element often acted as bait for the unwary. Mariners would leave the parlor houses, cribs, dance halls and saloons with pockets picked, reeling from knockout drops in a drink. The Port Townsend Salmon Club and Cotton's shipyard occupy a waterfront area where Tom Saunders had a dance hall which contributed liberally to the supply  of shanghaied men.<br>
<br>
The Pacific Bar on Union Wharf also was reputed skilled in dispensing deep-sleep liquor. It was a simple matter for a whitehall boat to wait underneath a trap door in the wharf behind the bar for men to be dropped down and taken to the ships.<br>
<br>
Lewis spoke of a man named Gunderson, boarding house runner for Sims and Levy. With him usually was Chilean Pete.<br>
<br>
"One night with binoculars from my house I saw them going up the chains of a British ship lying at the ballast ground and a few minutes later they were coming off the ship," Lewis related. " The captain had given the mate his revolver and told him to go after the boarding house runners, who were promising the crew double money to desert. If the men left the ship that way they sacrificed the pay due them.<br>
<br>
"I heard bang, bang, and went down to see what was going on. The boarding house had stairs leading to the water and when I got there the lower steps were covered with blood and hair. Max Levy was
there and he wanted me to run and get Dr. House and tell him Chilean Pete was shot through the head. Gunderson was shot through the shoulder. Captain Jones had taken strong means to get his crew back out of their hands.<br>
<br>
"My father had fifty-five company contracts to load  ships on Puget Sound and Klocker held his consular job because of the shipping agency.<br>
<br>
"One, when Dad had gone on a trip to England, where he was born, and Klocker was away, I was left in charge. The fellows wee ready to take advantage of me on account of my age, 18 or 19, and  hat is when I learned a lot about Klocker's activities and many other things.<br>
<br>
"At 2 o'clock one morning Max Levy called on the telephone to say he wanted me. There was a mutiny on the British ship <B>Clan MacKenzie.</B> He sent a horse drawn cab to fetch me. I put on a derby hat and tried to look dignified as an acting consul. Max had his whitehall boat and rowers ready to take me out to the ship.<br>
<br>
"A towboat was lying alongside of her waiting to take the ship beyond Cape Flattery, but it was not moving until the mutiny was settled.<br>
<br>
"I climbed the Jacob's ladder and saw sailors walking around on the deck. The captain was locked in his room and the mate was tied in the forecastle.<br>
<br>
"Max announced that the British vice consul had arrived. I went in the cabin and said I'd talk to one man at a time. When the first one came in I asked what was the trouble and reminded him he had signed the articles before me.<br>
<br>
"The big fellow said, " I don't remember getting aboard this ship and here I am going to Durban, South Africa. I need some clothes, too."<br>
<br>
"I told him he had been listed with the boarding house master's association which required an advance out of seamen's pay to furnish clothing.<br>
<br>
"Let's see what you've got!" I said. " He brought his bag and dumped it on the floor. It contained a woman's corset, old women's shoes and other rubbish enough to fill the bag. That was what he had been supplied by the boarding house masters.<br>
<br>
"I told the fellow he was right to object and turned to the next poor devil. He'd been given an old blanket, mismatched shoes, and old hats in his bag. We went down the line of twenty-six men, none of them properly outfitted.<br>
<br>
"When I saw this, I told Max, 'This ship is not going to sail until these fellows are outfitted properly.' They were taken ashore
though it was Sunday morning, and Al Newman, manager of the Red Front Clothing Company, which outfitted for the masters association, and his clerk were called. I stayed until the men were given everything they wanted and warned Maxie not to let it happen again. However it did... many times.<br>
<br>
"The boarding house masters' association was paid ninety dollars for each man it supplied and received twenty dollars advance for outfitting them. There was a temptation to keep all the money they could."<br>
<br>
Lewis, who was in the revenue cutter service in 1906 and 1907 said there was no incentive to conceal shanghaiing activities by any devise as elaborate as a tunnel.<br>
<br>
"Everything was above board. If you shanghaied or brought in opium, that was considered part of your business. I've seen a bunch of men escorted down Front Street with a lodging house fellow to help hold them up.<br>
<br>
"Runners were mighty careful never to shanghai an Indian or the'd have had the federal government after them.<br>
<br>
"I saw one tremendous, awful fight after a big fellow from Butte had been liquored in Seattle, and woke up on board a ship bound for Hong Kong. He appealed to me to get him off, but when I couldn't do anything for him he said he'd get even. Two years later he got off the steamer <B>Alice Gertrude</B> in Port Townsend and went into Patsy Lennon's Pacific Bar and I saw him looking for Sims and Levy.<br>
<br>
Each of them was accompanied by a runner and when the fellow found them, the four pounced on him. I asked the chief of police to interfere in the fight, but he wouldn't. He was said to be getting a rake-off from the shanghai business."<br>
<br>
Shanghaiing thrived when Port Townsend streets were dirt and plank roads. As the town grew, concrete sidewalks replaced wooden ones on stilts. They were shored with concrete walls for support and the space underneath resembled tunnels, with hatches opening from the sidewalks for unloading freight into basements.  That they were useful for shanghaiing is doubted by elder citizens, who say there was no need for concealment under ground.<br>
<br>
Jail records in the sheriff's office from 1891 to 1906 contain long lists of incarcerations for stabbing, robbery, smuggling, assault with a deadly weapon, ship desertion, murder, and insubordination aboard ship.<br>
<br>
Citizens in that rowdy period regarded the port so infested with undesirable characters they wondered why they should object if drugs were slipped in the drinks and the sinners were sent to repent on the open seas.<br>
<br>
Too often the real story was different and it was an unwary
sailor's hard luck to be ashore in Port Townsend in the unsavory years when it was a crimp's paradise.<br>

<br>
Max Levy was a merchant. Although ostensibly a clothier, his real commodity was the flesh beneath the fabric.  With partner Ed Sims, Levy owned a seamen's boarding house, a place where sailors could stay between voyages, where their needs would be met.  They were given a bed, food, and even pocket money for tobacco and liquor.  All on the cuff.<br>
<br>
When the bill came due, as it always did, it was "on the tide.  " When a ship needed a crew, its master would contact Levy or one of the other "crimps" that worked Port Townsend's waterfront.  For a fee of thirty dollars per head, plus up to three months advance on each sailor's wages, Levy would fill the ship's complement with the indebted bodies from his hotel.<br>
<br>
Those who balked were met by Levy's "runners," specialists whose job it was to render sailors compliant.  The ship then sailed out on the next tide.  When business was slow, Levy worked the other side of the fence, running crews off ships so that the master would be forced to buy another.  He once took three complete crews off the ship America before it was able to clear the harbor.  Until the practice was banned after the turn of the century, operations like Levy's were routine, an accepted part of life in every major seaport.<br>
<br>
What was also routine, but considerably less legitimate, was shanghaiing.  When not enough men were available through legal means to fill out a ship's crew, Levy or his competitors Tom Saunders and Limey Dirk would dispatch their runners to the brothels, called cribs, and bars that bordered the waterfront.<br>
<br>
The next morning a fcw hapless farmhands and loggers would probably catch their first view of Cape Flattery's west face.  Their victims were carefully picked: Professional sailors were always the first choice, soldiers next, local residents and Indians were almost always avoided.  The method might be as subtle as a few free drinks or as vulgar as back-alley sapping.<br>
<br>
In recent years, a popular misconception evolved that shanghai victims were carried to the beach and a waiting dory by way of a
series of underground passages.  The shanghai tunnels, as they were called, were said to have been built expressly for the trade.  In reality they were no more than vaulted sidewalks, added to facilitate access to the basements of the downtown buildings.  As 
romantic as the notion is, <B>it </B>scems unlikely that more than incidental use was made of them.  Generally, there was no need for such contrivances.  The greased palm has always been less capital 
intensive than underground  construction, and it involves far less organization.<br>
<br>
By most accounts, shanghaiing usually took place in one of the seventeen saloons or dozen brothels that lined the waterfront.  Most of them had direct water access through their back entrances.  A few, built on docks, had trapdoors for the disposal of garbage.  Through them an unconscious man could easily bc lowered to a waiting skiff.<br>
<br>
The sailors did not always take the abuse and manipulation lying down.  A particularly nasty operation was being run by Limey Dirk at the Pacific Bar on Union Wharf, Dirk was a notorious bully and shanghaier, besides which his food was bad.  The Sailors' Union of the Pacific organized a boycott and, when that was not enough, followed it with a campaign of stone throwing.<br>
<br>
Every night, under cover of darkness, the sailors would gather near the brothels across the street from Limey's and lob rocks through his windows.  Each night Dirk would charge outside, a pistol in cach hand, shooting at anything that moved.  Fortunately, he was a lousy shot and did not hit anyone.  After several days of this guerrilla war, one of the stones hit Dirk on the head, knocking him unconscious.  The sailors thought they had killed him, but the next day he was back at work.<br>

Stewart Holbrook, "Those bodies on the Flying Prince," <B>Wildmen, wobblies and whistle punks.</B> Corvallis: Oregon State University Press, 1992, p. 185-189.<br>
<br>
The time was late in 1893.  The Flying Prince, a big sailing ship of British register, was in Portland harbor, loaded to the gunnals with Douglas fir lumber, and ready to sail except for one thing; her crew, the captain figured, was short twenty-two men.  He put the matter up to Bunco Kelly.  Times were hard, he said, but he promised Kelly $30 a head for any men he could put aboard, before
morning daylight.<br>
<br>
Bunco made the usual rounds, starting at Liverpool Liz' place, going on to Erikson's saloon, then to Mary Cook's.  Next he started for the South End of the waterfront.  It was an evil night.  The driving rain beat down upon the squat, rather sinister figure as it moved along Front Street.<br>
<br>
Just before he reached Morrison Street, where stood the Snug Harbor saloon, he noticed an open trap door in the sidewalk. (Portland neither had nor has alleys such as most cities have; deliveries of merchandise and such things are often made through trap doors in the sidewalks, that lead to cellars.)<br>
<br>
Now, doors such as this should not be left open at night.  And besides, Bunco Kelly was no man to pass up an open door without investigation.  Moreover, a peculiar odor emanated from this particular trap door.  It welled up out of the the blackness beneath, pungent, powerful, strange.<br>
<br>
Bunco Kelly, whose knowledge of chemicals was limited to the ingredients of Kelly's Comforters, a knock-out mixture he had used with great success, thought he had smelled something like this aroma before, but for the life of him he couldn't say where.  He sniffed carefully.  He did not like the smell, but he was a curious man.  He prepared to descend into the dark.<br>
<br>
"In those days," Bunco Kelly later told Spider Johnson, who in turn told me, "in those days, I always carried a small dark lantern under my coat.  I got it out and lighted, and threw a beam below.  I couldn't see nothing but the little ladder disappearing into the darkness." Bunco was game, however, and he went slowly down into what he described as the damnedest reek he ever hoped to suffer.<br>
<br>
He saw at once that the room was not wholly in darkness.  A candle spluttered on a keg, and the scene its dim light revealed to Bunco Kelly was one he never forgot.  "My hair," he related to Spider Johnson, "was pretty thin, but the few hairs I had stood up and pushed my cap into the air."<br>
<br>
On the floor near the ladder lay a man.  He was alive but not in the best of health.  He was gasping, and every little while made as if to clutch at his throat.  "What's the matter?" Bunco asked him.  The man seemed to hear.  He lifted his head a bit, tried to say something, but couldn't.<br>
<br>
Bunco now let his dark lantern play around the room.  Propped against one of many barrels were three men doubtless corpses,
Bunco surmised.  Their mouths were open, and so were their eyes, but they were not seeing anything.  Lying or dropping in odd postures all over the place were other men.  Kelly counted 24 all told.<br>
<br>
Going from one to another, placing his hand on their brows and listening, he came to the conclusion, hurriedly, that at least a third of them still lived.  Still, he could not be sure, for he thought that as he watched one of the men gave a deep heave and died.<br>
<br>
"I was pretty startled at first," Kelly admitted later in something of a conservative statement.  But he got his nerve back quickly.  He turned his attention to one of the barrels, from the bung of which a liquid was dripping.  He caught some of it in his hand.  It was very cold.  He sniffed it and it rocked him back on his heels.<br>
<br>
In fact, the sniff nearly floored him.  He quickly went up the ladder to the street.  The air soon cleared his dizziness, and his usually quick mind, "By God!" he remarked to nobody in particular, as the true significance of the business struck him, "them stiffs has been drinking undertaker's dope."<br>
<br>
It was true enough, too.  Johnson & Sons' Undertaking Parlors were just next door to the Snug Harbor saloon.  These men had broken into what they thought was the saloon's cellar, which happened to be the cellar of Johnson & Sons.  The embalming fluid had proved too stout even for men accustomed to the vilest booze.<br>
<br>
Without stopping to draw a moral from the sardonic tragedy, or even to notify the police, Bunco went into sudden and efficient action.  He closed the big trap door, lest some watchman find it open, and then tore for the North End of town as fast as his short legs could carry him against wind and rain.  He went directly to<br>
<br>
The Mariners' Rest, as he chose to call the old warehouse he had converted into a boarding place for sailors.  From here he sent a boy on the dead run to fetch a cab.  He roused four or five old friends, bar-flies whom he permitted to sleep in his place, and bade them gird their loins.  "No sleep in the house tonight boys," he said.<br>
<br>
Back came the boy with a cab.  Kelly and his crew piled into it and sped away over the cobblestones, stopping at the Fashion Livery & Feed Stable, where Bunco asked for five more cabs to hurry to Front and Morrison Streets.<br>
<br>
It was now well after midnight.  The storm was increasing, which
pleased Kelly; there was not likely to be so much as a cop on the street.  The rain had turned to sleet that stung, for the wind was rising steadily.  It was just the right kind of night for the apex in the professional career of Bunco Kelly.<br>
<br>
Dark lantern in hand, Kelly led his crew down the ladder, advising them to breathe as little as possible.  The stench at first stopped a couple of the helpers, but Kelly threatened to toss them out of his boarding house if they didn't perform like men.  "Briskly, now, lads, briskly," Kelly commanded.  "We'll lift these boys up the ladder and put them into the cabs."<br>
<br>
It was hard work, and it went all too slowly until Kelly<br>
suddenly became generous, "Five dollars in gold to each of you," he told his aides, "as soon as these sailors are aboard ship." The promise proved a fine stimulant.  Heaving with a will, the Kelly men passed the dead and dying up the ladder, and into the waiting cabs.  Up came Kelly.<br>
<br>
He didn't even stop to close the trap but leaped into the first cab.  "Drive," he told the hackman, "as fast as you can to Ainsworth dock." And away went a procession that would have pleased Ambrose Bierce, and E. A. Poe no more than it did Joseph Kelly-sparks from hooves of wheels lighting the night, the dead rolling against the living, the wind howling across the harbor, and the hulk of the Flying Prince, looming darker than the night, standing there at dock, awaiting twenty-two able sea-men.<br>
<br>
By half-past one fourteen corpses and ten men who were very ill had been stowed away snugly in the Flying Prince's forecastle, bound out for China.<br>
<br>
Bunco Kelly had to explain to the skipper, which he did plausibly, how he had come by his men in one batch; and to argue with the skipper that he had asked for 24, not 22, sailors.  The captain was so well pleased to leave with a full crew he did not argue.  "I never saw so many men drunk at one time," he remarked, but he counted out $30 each for two dozen men.<br>
<br>
"Yes, sir," agreed Kelly genially, "they are godawful drunk, and getting them so cost me a pretty penny." Putting the cash into his pocket he bade the skipper farewell.  "And don't forget, sir," he said, "Bunco Kelly is a man who always keeps his promises."<br>
<br>
At dawn the Flying Prince cast off and headed down the Columbia for the open sea.  Long before noon the first mate made the hideous discovery in the forecastle.  The ship put in at Astoria, where the corpses were removed.  Astoria newspapermen soon had the story on the wires.
The sensation following the discovery of the dead men made a great rumpus in Portland.  Preachers remonstrated that the city was in a moral decay.  They attacked the politicians and the police. <B>There </B>was the<B> </B>usual police shake up, with a few cops being moved here and there, and the chief ordered strict regulation of sailors' boarding houses.  Kelly, Sullivan and other Portland crimps were merely questioned about the load of corpses.  Nobody was charged with murder or anything else.<br>

<br>
Despite the increased success of Andrew Furuseth and the Sailors' Union in gaining recognition for seamen of the American merchant fleet and in reducing the power of the boardinghouse keepers and crimps, there was still much discontent among seafaring men in 1903, as evidenced by the following direct quotation from the Coast Seamen's Journal <B>of </B>April 15 of that year:<br>
<br>
"DOINGS  IN  TOWNSEND"<br>
<br>
"On Sunday, 28 March, there was another good time in Townsend.  The British ship RAJAH shipped a crew from the 'prominent business men,' Sims and Levy.  After the men had signed they were called in to 'square up.' None had been longer in the place than two days, so they at least expected to get some clothing.  In answer to their query on this score, they were punched and kicked and otherwise misused, for daring to presume that they should get any part of the money they each had to work and brave the dangers of their calling for.  It was a sight to see these men going into the boat to go aboard, bleeding and nearly smashed to a jelly.  There is a common supposition among people living in the Northern States that the slaves were abused sometimes by inhuman drivers; yet the fact goes un -noticed that there are people living within the town limits and called 'prominent business men' who abuse other human beings, to wit, deepwater sailors, worse than ever a slave was treated, even to such an extent as to cause people who have seen the treatment these human beings receive  to say that it is impossible to treat them worse.  This country has a society for the preventionof cruelty to animals. I only wish the sailor came under that head,sothat he might get some redress.<br>

<br>
A story indicative of the type of men engaged in the trade of crimping is told by a classmate of a runners son at Fort Townsend High School.  Upon one occasion when the firm for which he worked was short one body for delivery to an outgoing vessel of such ill repute that all experienced seamen shunned her like the plague, the runner, Charles Gunderson,  went to the school and took his son from class on some pretext, delivering him to the shipmaster to fill out the quota.<br>
<br>
In later years Gunderson shanghaied a cripple with only one arm, who had a steel hook in lieu of the missing hand.  Surviving the voyage, the one armed man returned to Port Townsend, his steel hook sharpened to a razor edge, and proceeded to so maim Gunderson that he spent the rest of his life as a semi-invalid.<br>

SHANGAIING<br>
<br>
Denise M. Alborn, "Crimping and Shanghaiing on the Columbia River," <B>The Oregon Historical Quarterly.</B> LXIII(Fall, 1992), p. 263-288.<br>
<br>
Shanghaiing! The curse of these streets it was.  The tunnels swallowed us up like whales.  It took us months to get our sea<br>
legs and years to get back home to find that blasted no-good crimp that got us into this God-forsaken mess.  We swore that when we hit town the dock along Burnside-we'd find him."'<br>
<br>
For at least three decades, beginning in the 1870s, a profitable and quasi-legal racket run by men called "crimps" governed the Portland and Astoria waterfronts.  Crimps rubbed elbows with politicians and important society people; they gave the Columbia
River a vile reputation on an international scale; and they left behind dramatic legends of sailors shanghaied and brutalized.<br>
<br>
A close study of these legends reveals considerable factual evidence of such notorious waterfront pracfices.  And trough as evidence we can begin to understand how the duration and extent of the crimps' power rested on a combination of local and national circumstances, supply and demand, and the prolonged decline of the age of sail.<br>
<br>
The word crimp originated as a British slang term for "agent," but camc to refer specifically to the middlemen who provided sailors to man vessels.  Merchant-marine crimping matured as a counterpart to the British naval impressment and eventually spread to ports around the world.  As the crimps and their recruiting tactics grew morc ruthless, the word gained derogatory implications.<br>
<br>
At best, crimps were opportinists parasitically feeding off the poorly regulated system of seamen's employment, turning maritime wage conventions and desertion laws to their advantage; at worst, they were cutthroat shanghaiers, supplying kidnapped landsmen in lieu of skilled sailors when labor was in short supply.<br>
<br>
The verb shanghai ("to put aboard a ship by force"), according to various authorities as well as common sense, derives from a frequent destination of the ships so manned (the "coast-wise," or domestic, trade never suffcrcd from the shortage of seamen chronic to the deep-sea trade). U.S. law defined shanghaiing as the employment of any sailor who had not signed ship's articles or who had signed unwillingly or unsoberly.<br>
<br>
Contemporaries often applied the terms "crimp," "shanghaier," and sailors boarding house keeper" interchangeably, as many crimps owned boarding houses.  These establishments extended credit to seamen and, in return, reserved the prerogative of "shipping them"-that is, arranging their next berth.<br>
<br>
"If it had not been for the boarding-house, who is going to take care of these people and feed them?" asked a Tacoma keeper at the Merchant Marine Commission hearings.  "They would be on the streets; they would be in jail.  I have no way of getting any money out of them except taking the risk of shipping them"- and then collecting their debtor's wages in advance to cover costs, as well as a finder's fee from the captain (called  blood money by critics).<br>
<br>
Many contemporaries, however, accused the crimps of collecting from the sailors for imagined debts.  "Thcre is no doubt that much of the advance money of $25 a sailor is pretty near all profit to the boardinghouse proprictors," a Norwegian consul told the press; he knew of sailors who had to pay the advance even though "they never spent a day at the boarding house.<br>

In the 1890s two months wages constituted the maximum legal advance.  Alfred Clark, shanghaied from a riverboat party onto a squarerigger in 1891, later recalled exactly how the crimps exploited this law.  A Portland crimp signed him on as an able-bodied seaman, or A.B. (experienced), and took sixty dollars, the two-month advance.<br>
<br>
When it became apparent that Clark had never been to sea before, his employment status changed to ordinary seaman, or o.s., at half the salary: four months at fifteen dollars per month, all of which had gone to the crimp on shore.  The unfortunate Clark docked at Lc Havre, France, with no salary coming to him.<br>
<br>
This account highlights several of the reasons why early seamen's union activists viewed the problem of crimping abuses as a labor-law issue.  For exaniple, maritime law required no proof of a seaman's A.B. status upon employment; nonrelations were permitted to harnest advanced wage allotments and although a law of 1872 decreed that sailors should sign ship's articles <B>in </B>front of an official, inadequate provision was made for enforcement.<br>
<br>
Other statutes left seamen vulnerable to creditors, allowing captains to issue shore leave without pay, to withhold pay for a period after discharge, and to revoke the wages of deserters.  A contemporary assessment maintained that the strapped crewmen, in ports of call turned to creditors "who preyed upon his necessities and who went to great measures to induce desertion in order to have a dependent debtor and another hand to sea to the next ship."<br>
<br>
The problem of desertion was inextricably tied to that of crimping in the contemporary mind.  Union rhetoric maintained that if seamen gained the right to terminate their contracts at any port and collect wages due, they could lodge where they liked, ship when they liked, and the crimps' source of revenue would dry up.<br>
<br>
Failing to change the convention of the round-trip contract, reformers succeeded around the turn of the century in passing laws that forbade unauthorized persons from boarding vessels and enticing men ashore.<br>
<br>
The crux of the matter of desertion, as explained by a British consul in Portland, lay in "the unknown disposition of the sailor, on arrival in port, after months of repression and discomfort," to be eager for shore; to run into excesses, a much-to-be-deplored, yet by no means unnatural propensity."<br>
<br>
The official went on to say that most deserters break even in the long run: "Sympathy is wasted on the larger proportion of men who desert, as by their practice of leaving at every port and reshipping with an advance they forfeit practically nothing." But, the consul urged, the protection of law should bc extended to "the really honest sailor," who, by combined efforts of the captain and crimp, "Is made so uncomfortable on board that he is quite ready
to desert.<br>
<br>
It became almost a waterfront maxim that the captains of ships cooperated with the crimps for their own gain.  A handbill printed by the Portland Chamber of Commerce in 1898 raged that<br>
instead of deserting, all these seamen, with few exceptions, were enticed, decoyed, or by threats and infimidations forced from their vessels by a syndicate of crimps ... and this too often with the knowledge and consent and even the connivance of captains and owners, who adopt these dishonorable means of voiding contracts usually made for three years, and thus profit by the forfeiture of the entire wages of the seamen.<br>
<br>
Norwegian Consul Endre M. Cederbergh charged that the captains profited morc directly, collecting a payoff of $5.00 to  $7.50 for each man they bought from the crimps with the shipowner's money.  "That the captains receive this rebate is no secret," he claimed.<br>
<br>
The skippers themselves, of course, told a different story.  They maintaincd that vast sums of moncy went toward bribing the men off the ships, and while captains tried to stem the tide, Portland was a lawless place that gave them no assistance.  A Captain Morcau informed the chamber of commerce that the crimps promiscd his men thirty-five dollars apiece to desert; only two did so.<br>
<br>
Captains Blair and Toush tried to hire men independently of the crimps, but the latter brooked no such opposition: Men were lured away from the ships; and the crimps warned that unless the independent sailors were fired and replaced by their own men, the whole crew would go, even "If it cost $100 per man to take them."<br>
<br>
Both captains complied, but Toush's crew still got an offer of ten dollars each to leave; they all apparently resisted."'<br>
<br>
Visiting ships could not afford the time and trouble to prosecute for such violations, an often-overlooked fact that rendered existing laws completely ineffectual. Captains, therefore, expected the ports to police themselves, and complained of Portland's failure to do so.<br>
<br>
Whether they had taken bribes or not, deserting seamen did not have the same right simply to quit a job that other men had, according to admiralty law.  In 1897 four men deserted from the bark Arago at Astoria and, when charged with their crime, pleaded that the thirteenth ammendment protected them from involuntary servitude.<br>
<br>
The Arago case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that the sailor's contract was an exceptional one and involved the surrender of certain liberties accorded to others.  In return, sea-men became essentiafly wards of the court, which made decisions for them and supposedly protected them: "Seamen are treated by Congress, as well as by the Parliament of Great
Britain, as deficient in that full and intelligent responsibility for their acts which is accredited to ordinary adults.""<br>
<br>
The law did not change until 1915, when all seamen gained the right to break contract undcr certain conditions, and to strike, subject to a judge's interpretation of whether the acts were war-
ranted or mutinous.<br>
<br>
While unions placed crimping and shanghaiing in the context of labor management and civil rights, others saw it as a social issue.  One of the various reform lobbies of the time put blame for the abuses squarely on public and legal opinion, whose "logical" outcome, they argued, was the manner in which crimps and sea captains misused sailors.<br>
<br>
A man resorting to the ships "loses social caste by going to sea, loses the respect of the people with whom he has been associated"; this downward mobility demoralized the work force and kept its numbers short, thus crippling the industry."<br>
<br>
Charities adopted this cause and addressed themselves to the mariner's moral and social welfare, offering an alternative to waterfront accommodation amd entertainment.  The Seaman's Friend Society, chapter in Portland sponsored a boarding house kept a library there, hired a minister, and formed a commission to study the abuse of seamen and to facilitate legal action against abuse.<br>
<br>
Mostly the Seamen's Friend Society hoped to save the "weak and shiftless" mariner, "tossed by every wave of influence," from the "baleful" sailor boarding house:<br>
<br>
It is said as partial excuse for not helping him that the sailor is ... his own worst enemy-which to a great extent is deplorably true ... and hence the imperative necessity for Seamcn's Homes and<br>
Bethels where the worthy seaman may find a home and hospitality.<br>
<br>
The rhetoric of the Seamen's Friend Society at times bore striking resemblance to the language of the Supreme Court's paternal rulings on the seafaring trade as expressed in the Arago decision.<br>
<br>
Thus crimping generated a number of different responses -moral, legal, social, and economic-depending on the perspective of the observer.  Perhaps one of the strongest barriers to the emancipation of seamen was a societal attitude - a fear of @s transient male population - as voiced by one man-on-the-street when asked about crimps stealing advanced wages: "I do not carc how much they take away from [the sailor], as he is only a beast, anyway.""<br>
<br>
In 1898 a Portland Chamber of Commerce report credited one James Turk with the introduction of crimping practices to the Oregon coast about twenty-five years earlier." This British-born
ex-sailor and Mexican War veteran arrived in Portland in the 1870s, opening a large hotel in North Portland and a sailors boarding house on Couch Street between First and Second.<br>
<br>
He also purchased some of the best property in Astoria, where he dabbled in politics and public affairs, even running for mayor once."'<br>
<br>
Besides fathering the Oregon crimping trade, Turk fathered two sons.  One of them, Frank, followed in James Turk's footsteps and operated a sailors boarding house in Astoria.  Frank Turk tried to expand his business westward, moving to Honolulu in 1899, where, in the Astoria Daily Budget's words, the sea captains did not "take kindly to the idea of having Pacific Coast methods of shipping seamen introduced" The authorities pressed charges against the younger Turk for aiding and abetting desertion, and for illegally boarding vessels."<br>
<br>
Frank Turk returned to Astoria to ply his trade, apparently unharried by such legalities.<br>
<br>
James Turk is remembered, among other things, for shanghaiing his other son (whose name, however, is not remembered), as a disciplinary measure for drinking and womanizing.  An account of this rather unusual punishment claims that Turk collected blood money from the skipper for his son, and that the young man returned from sea several months later cured of his delinquency, eventually to become a successful businessman <B>in </B>California.<br>
<br>
The Portland Chamber of Commerce report waxed eloquent on the misdeeds of the elder Turk: "The inhumanity and cruelty of James Turk toward seamen has never been denied by men who knew him-, and the spirit of their progenitor has largely animated his successors in the business, even to the present day. <B>"</B><br>
<br>
Over thirty years later, however, one of those who knew him -an old Portlander named Spider Johnson -told the Oregonian that Turk was a "square-shooter," as no one was ever robbed in his place (though, Johnson admitted, Turk "got a pretty bad reputation" and "may have" shanghaied a few drunk sailors).<br>
<br>
At the same time, Johnson confirmed part of the chamber's report: "This Jim Turk ... was one of the original shanghai boys here."<br>
<br>
Spider Johnson's reminiscences described a busy Portland water-
front- a "forest of masts" from ships docked on the river and an elaborate red-light district both ashore and floating on saloon scows.  "Sailor runners" went about recruiting less-experienced or inexperienced sailors for the boarding houses:<br>
<br>
"Thc genuine A.B.s and skilled mariners never stopped at the sailor's boarding houses unless they wanted to take ship again
right away.  They knew better." But farmers, loggers, or men who had sailed just once or twice before were fair game for the runners' promises of good employment and accommodations on credit.<br>
<br>
"I know one ship that went out of Portland which had two real seamen and around forty plowboys from the midwest.  I know of another ship ... which had a bull-teamster signed on as bos'n," Johnson recalled."<br>
<br>
"Yes, I know there was a lot of bad stuff went on, and a lot of guys were shanghaied, but a lot of them needed it." Instead of just hanging around "waiting for someone to buy them another drink," the sailors benefited from the months of forced sobriety and came back in good physical condition, with money coming to them, according to Johnson.<br>
<br>
"That was not such a bad break." He also told of a man dying of consumption who was cured by a sea vovage after being shanghaied out of Portland.<br>
<br>
Blood money, Johnson said, usually  ranged between twenty-five and fifty dollars, but went as high as one hundred dollars per man.  "Knockout drops " used on occasion and a certain local druggist ... kept his store going from that trade, but for the most part it was hard liquor or cash that shanghaied a man."<br>
<br>
Johnson admitted to signing on a few, men himself, as well as to stuffing ballot boxes in support of the crimps political designs.<br>
<br>
Another feature  of  Portland's waterfront and also figuring  prominently in area folklore-was the network of "shanghai tunnels" running under city streets to the never.  Underground passages opened into saloons and other businesses in the north end and terminated near the present-day Burnside Bridge.<br>
<br>
While mundane uses may have included access to waterlines and cargo loading, some claim that human "cargo" trafficked the tunnels as well.<br>
<br>
Following leads from rumors and local folk memories, historian Mike Jones excavated such tunnels in the 1970s- In these brick-lined passageways that may originally havc been constructed for drainage or flood control, Jones found evidence of human use: intriguing artifacts such as pin bottles, a turn-of-the-century shoe, part of a peg leg, bullets, meat hooks, and, most intriguing of all a man-sized cage.<br>
<br>
Jones identified certain tunnels as escape routes for Chinese gambling and opium dens; he became convinced that others, leading from establishments such as the elaborate Erickson's Hotel on Third and Burnside, provided convenient routes for the <B>crimps.<br>
<br>
</B>Of the known crimps operating in the milieu described by Spider
Johnson and disinterred by Mike Jones, James Turk was perhaps the first, but he was not the most famous.<br>
<br>
A colorful character named Joseph "Bunco" Kelly gained more notoriety than the rest, attracting tall stories that have since been recounted in virtually every magazine and newspaper review of Oregon shanghaiing printed this century.<br>
<br>
According to one of these tales, Kelly earned his nickname "Bunco" in 1885, when he stole a six-and-a-half-foot wooden Indian from the front of Wildman's Cigar Store (at First and Glisan in Portland), wrapped it in a tarpaulin, and sold it as a drunk seaman to a ship for fifty dollars.  After Norwegian fishermen supposedly netted the Indian near Astoria, it eventually returned to Wildman's, where it was chained to the pavement.<br>
<br>
Other exploits credited to Kelly include the shanghaiing of prostitutes (whom he dressed as men) and the defrauding of the bark Rosecranna in 1888, from which he collected $465 for a crew he never delivered.  But the most fantastic story involves the mass shanghaiing of twenty-four dead men.  As the story goes, Kelly happened on a group of dead and dying inebriates in the cellar of Johnson & Sons Undertakers.<br>
<br>
They had broken into what they thought was the cellar of the Snug Harbor Saloon, which stood next door (at Second and Morrison), and mistakenly drank formaldehyde thinking that the wooden kegs held beer.  Kelly, after rounding up help, sold the corpses for $720 to the Flying Prince, which was in the harbor awaiting a crew.<br>
<br>
Originally from Liverpool, Joseph Kelly came to Astoria as a sailor in 1874 at the age of thirty-six.  He eventually opened a boardinghouse at Northwest Third and Davis in Portland, after crimping on the streets for a time.  Besides fraud, he became famous for Keily's Knock-Out Drops, served in drinks.<br>
<br>
Of more interest, perhaps, than the wild stories told about him are Kelly's diaries, written in prison.  Kelly remarked of Astoria, perhaps too innocently, that he found it something inhuman to see the way them sailors were treated.... New Orleans was never in it with the Columbia River crimps.  No wonder we have got the worst reputation of any nation on earth.  Wherever you go, in any part of the world, you are asked by seafaring men, captains, mates and sailors, the first question is: "Did you come from Astoria, the pirate city by the sea?"<br>
<br>
Writing as if from the standpoint of a righteous observer rather than a participant, Kelly described the Oregon crimping busincss: The "boss crimpers" approached newly arrived vessels armed with iron hooks and a rope ladder, like the old-time pirates.  They would throw the ladder aboard and climb over the ship's side with their dosed whiskey and commence giving it out to the sailors.<br>
<br>
When the poor sailor takes one drink, he belongs body and soul to
the crimp.... Sometimes the ship captains allied themselves with the crimps in ordcr to confiscate the sailor's pay."<br>
<br>
The Noddleburn case of 1890 offers a more credible example of Kelly's crimping methods than the anecdote of the shanghaied corpses.  An Idaho logger named Armstrong jumped overboard from the Noddleburn while she lay at anchor in Portland and went to the authoritics to implicate Kelly for shanghaiing.<br>
<br>
Armstrong charged that Kelly had promised him light work at good pay; furthermore, he had personally signed no ship's articles.  But Kelly was taken without a warrant and the case had to be dropped.<br>
<br>
Kelly maintained that competing Portland crimps fabricated the Noddleburn incident because he refused to join their monopoly and raise the local price of blood money.<br>
<br>
Again iiii8g Kelly cried foul when he was tried and convictcd for the murder of George Sayres.  Kelly later wrote: "It is said that I killed him while trying to shanghai the old man.  I am <B>innocent.<br>
</B>On the night of the murder Kelly and another crimp Larry<br>
Sullivan went to jail for fighting. Despite this alibi and his continued not guilty plea the police produced an alleged confession.<br>
<br>
Kelly is quoted as saying:<br>
<br>
"I am being tried not as the person who killed poor old George Sayres.  I am being tried for all the crimes ever committed in the North End.  I am on trial because I am operating a successful sailor's boarding house, the finest on this coast.  I am being tried because I have no influence with the city's politicians.  It is all a frame-up, gentlemen."<br>
<br>
Apparently Bunco Kelly's defense did not fall on deaf ears, for in 1907 Governor George Earle Chamberlain granted him a full pardon in response to a petition that had been circulating for some time.  Kelly returned to Astoria, advising others to give up crimping, become men and go to work because there is a curse on the sailor business.  Beware and take warning, for time flies, and become good citizens."<br>
<br>
The men that Kelly accused of engineering his defence certainly had the wherewithal to do so.  Larry Sullivan, brothers Jack and Peter Grant, and Richard McCarron worked together as a powerful coalition during the 1890s and into the early twentieth century. (Other occasional partners included Billy Smith, Jim and Harry White, and John Betts.)<br>
<br>
As Kelly hinted in his testimony, this coalition had political clout, as evidenced in court decisions, law enforcement (or lack thereof), and even state legislation.  A historian of Portland later enlogized Sullivan as "king of the boardinghouse operators.<br>

Larry Sullivan came to Astoria in the early 1880s, while in his twenties, and made a name for himself as an amateur boxer.  In the 1890s he opened a boarding house at Second and Glisan in Portland he also operated gambling clubs and became a "ward boss" for local elections.  Although he accrued a long police record of minor convictions and dropped charges, Sullivan and his cronies often successfully manipulated the law to stall ships and to punish uncooperative captains, sailors, or rival crimps.<br>
<br>
For instance, once when Richard McCarron came to blows with Astoria crimp Paddy Lynch for encroaching on the coalition's territory, police arrested Lynch for assault and battery but let McCarron go free.  And in 1895, when representatives of the Portland Seamen's Friend Society began laying groundwork for a Seamen's Institute that would house and ship sailors at reasonable rates, the organizers also found themselves facing charges of assalt and battery, trespassing, threatening to kill Sullivan, and using profane and vulgar language.<br>
<br>
Like Kelly had earlier, defendants Matthew Dee and J. P. Christiansen of the Seamen's Friend Society insisted that the affair was a frame-up.  The Oregonian sarcastically remarked that Sullivan's "esthetic mind was rudely shocked by the use of such language as he imputes to Dee.<br>
<br>
"Time and again I have seen poor seamen arrested on trumped-up<br>
charges, simply because they refuse to do what the boarding house masters demand," complained British Consul James Laidlaw.  Captains hiring independently also faced such sanctions, he added, mentioning one who had been charged with kidnapping and another with libel, "on the flimsy pretext of breach of contract."<br>
<br>
Other libel suits brought by crimps <B>in</B>cluded one by Jack Grant against Norwegian Consul Cederbergh, who had claimed that Grant overcharged for sailors, and another by Jim Turk against a party who had accused him of shanghaiing.  Both suits failed,<br>
however.<br>
<br>
Before 1889 transients were subject to debtor's prison in Oregon, and this provided yet another legal tool for the crimps.  E. Quackcnbush of the Seamen's Friend Society described how boarding house keepers "of the Jim Turk stripe" had "fattened upon the sailors" using debtor's prisons.<br>
<br>
For instance: a sailor would contract 50 cents or one dollar actual indebtedness in a saloon, he would finally ship, would be taken from the ship either here or at Astoria upon a claim in the Justice Court of anywhere from $30 to $60, all of which except the onc dollar or less was fraudulent.<br>
<br>
When once on shore he would be discharged, the sailor pirates
running him in and finally shipping him for a second profit, with prospect of a rearrest upon a similarly trumped-up charge, that a third profit might be realized from reshipment."<br>
<br>
Such a chain of events may be the basis for one diarist's assertion that men were shanghaiied out of Astoria jail cells.<br>
<br>
"The boarding-house masters here have a big pull.  It is believed here that they can do anything that they at the courts," came the report on Portland printed in a London journal. In keeping with this claim, Bunfco Kelly's autobiogrpahy tells of a Finn whom Larry Sullivan tried to shanghai out of a dance hall, but having given him too much dope the crimp could not wake the seaman. So Sullivan poured coal oil into his boots and set fire to them. He burnt the sailor's feet pretty near off. The case went to the grand jury but Sullivan paid a thousand dollars to clear his name, according to Kelly. The sailor died a short while later.<br>
<br>
Another of Sullivan's clients lived to tell his own tale: Alfred Clark, just off the farm at the age of twenty-one came to Portland in 1891 and accepted an invitation from a pleasant sort of fellow to the boarding house owned by Sullivan and Billy Smith. From there he joined a riverboat party, featuring food, drink, women and dancing and a three piece orchestra which reveled its way down river to Astoria and docked.<br>
<br>
The festivities continued ashore but not before the ten guests signed a "passenger list" ostensibly to assure their return trip. In Astoria someone offered a of the square-rigger T.F. Oaks, and everyone went aboard -only to be threatened at gunpoint and clapped in irons.  The captain explained to Clark and the others that they had each signed legal ship's articlcs (the passenger list) and thereby agreed to sail to Le Havre.<br>
<br>
Clark's story attests to the general spirit of collaboration in crime along the Columbia River.  Starting out from Sullivan's boardinghouse in Portland, the men were shanghaied out of Astoria; many crimps operated out of both towns rather than one or the othcr, a fact that renders the frequent comparisons between the two towns rather meaningless.  Then Vice-Consul Laidlaw wrote:<br>
<br>
In his report for 1890, my colleague at Astoria makes the statement that the crimps infesting that port had changed to Portland.... The facts are that nearly all the sailors boarding houses have been and are located at Astoria-, that, with one or rwo exceptions, aH the most notorious crimps resided there.<br>
<br>
He went on to say that Portland's higher desertion rate was the result of  Astoria crimps tagging along up river and then hustling the sailors back to the coast.<br>
<br>
Certainly the family ties of Jack and Peter Grant constituted one of the greatest factors in this river wide cooperation. While their
mother, Bridget Grant, owned one of the most successful boardinghouses <B>in </B>Astoria, their brother Nace (short for Ignatius) held influential civic posts ranging from grange master and volunteer hose-team chief to sheriff and chief of police.  Nace Grant resigned from public life in 1918 when he was charged with graft in his capacity as chief of police.<br>
<br>
Bridget and Peter Grant (senior) owned boarding houses on the East Coast and in San Francisco before settling in Astoria in 1876.  The elder Peter drowned soon after, and Bridget single handedly raised her eight children and ran the sailors boarding house at 614 Commercial Street.<br>
<br>
Given to hosting society-page functions, after she died Bridget Grant was remembered fondly by the newspapers as a "pioneer resident." But while she lived, those who knew her from a business standpoint deplored  her as "queen of the boarding-master's fraternity."<br>
<br>
Legend has it that she cleared land on her farm with the help of shanghaied men, detained on the wilderness property, until a ship requircd them.  A captain complained that she builied him out of $150 in 1887 by collecting the debt of some sailors the captain had picked up in Portland, even though these men had never seen Bridget Grant.<br>
<br>
When the captain refused to pay she let them go; but the sheriff later boarded his ship to collect for Mrs. Grant, and the captain had to comply or lose the men to debtor's prison <B>.<br>
<br>
</B>Indeed,  it  seems  that  at  times  Astoria  law  enforcement  cooperated wth the crimps by policy.  When Robert M. Stuart of the Seamen's Friend Society asked the assistance of a police officer in case of a dockside scuffle with crimps, the chief of police later notified Stuart that his men were instructed not to interfere with the boardinghouse keepers.<br>
<br>
"I told him to go to Hades, that I would never ask help from them again," Stuart wrote."<br>
<br>
Bridget Grant retired in 1906, by which time competition-and profit had dropped off sharply for her and for her sons.  Jim Turk died in 1895, and Bunco Keily was in the state penitentiary until 1907, when he emerged a reformed man; Richard McCarron went to California at some point.  Crimping in Portland dwindled to a few individuals: Sullivan, the Grant brothers, and BiHv Smith and his partners Jim and Harry White.<br>
<br>
In 1904- the papers announced Sullivan's impending retirement from the boarding house, taking with him "not a single dollar.  There are no assets, no invested capital, nothing to sell." Sullivan and Petcr Grant went to Nevada as miners in 1905, leaving the shrinking boardinghouse business with Jack Grant; the Whites, who had fought for a foothold against the Grant-Sullivan monopoly, agreed on a
merger at that time.<br>
<br>
In 1916 or 1917 Sullivan reappcared in Orcgon, got in trouble for bootlegging in Clackamas County, and wound up laboring for a Pordand shipbuilder.  "Larry Sullivan Has Joined the Army of Hard Working Men," touted a headline.  "The soft hand that once slid the two-spot from a faro case now wraps its grimy fingers around beams in a local shipyard." A year later, in 1918, Sullivan died of natural causes at the age of fifty-five.<br>
<br>
Larry, Sullivan's oft-quoted boast to a visiting consul that he was "the law in Portland" certainly had some substance, though at this remove it is difficult to gauge the extent of his and other crimps' influence, or to provc allegations made bv contemporaries."<br>
<br>
Sullivan's extensive political involvement surely gave him contacts in high places.  Just before and after his death, the newsmen tallied up Sullivan's carcer: "Destinies of More Than One Politician Swayed by Boarding House Man," was the subhead for an article that called Sullivan a powerful political factor in the state," a denizen of the Joseph Simon faction of the Republican party, "a daring and picturesque fighter in the political arena," and a ward boss; "during the height of his career in the sailor boarding house busincss he was active in all of the election contests and the side he was on usually came out victorious."<br>
<br>
Another paper stated more vaguely that "his political activitics <B>in </B>Portland were numerous and varied."<br>
<br>
Both newspaper stories recalled and election in which Sullivan brandished a shotgun at police who arrived to investigate the polling booth located at his boardinghouse.  When the polling was safely over, police arrested Sullivan, but, as usual, "no serious charge was filed against him." A later account of that election asserted that an entire crew from a Dutch ship had voted: "I think they got two dollars apiece; not one of them could read or speak English. <B>"</B><br>
<br>
Sullivan also made his connections useful in the harbor master's office.  After they had posted Robert M. Stuart at the mouth of the Columbia to collect the complaints of sea captains, Seamen's Friend Society officials insisted they had no recourse in Portland against Sullivan's extortionate fees (fifty-five dollars per sailor, by one report) because the harbor master cc stood in" with the crimps.<br>
<br>
Some of the captains interviewed asserted that the Seamen's Friend Society itself answered to the cnrimps.  Sullivan, the captains said, had shown them a dispatch, written by Stuart and intended for the society's president E. Quackenbush.- Sullivan apparently displayed the intercepted dispatch as proof of his complete control of the port.<br>

After collecting many accusations against the harbor master, Quack-
enbush wrote to the mayor-elect, George Williams, alleging "without reservation" that "not more than 15% of the nearly $12,000 which the city has paid out" to the Harbor Office went toward administering the ofrice's duties; "In other words, the law has not been enforced 15% of the time, nor with 15% of honest intention that it should be enforced.  Over $10,000 has simply been squandered.<br>
<br>
This attention to financial considerations typified the battle against crimping and related graft in Portland.  A chamber of commerce address to the Legislative Assembly of 1899 appealed to the state's wallet first, estimating the 1898 earnings of Columbia River crimps at $51,000; next, the address invoked civic pride; and finally, near the bottom of the page, it cited humanity and sympathy for sailors as "a further ground" for action."<br>
<br>
Perhaps in an effort to draw a wider scopc of concern, the chamber and other interested parties insisted that Orcgon's grain growers lost out in the long run:<br>
<br>
Who pays for this? Not the shipowner, for he can eventually recoup himself through the higher freight.  Not the merchant, who  predi-
cates his buying price on the freight he has to pay, but the produc-
er-the farmer who gets just so much less for his produce.<br>
<br>
Various estimates of the amount fleeced from honest farmers (in addition to the chamber's estimate) appeared in the news from time to time.  Norweigan Consul Cederbergh calculated in 1908 that the individual sailors boardinghouse keeper made $25,000 tO  $30,000 per year, "equal to the earnings of many big businesses."<br>
<br>
When Jack Grant retorted that he and his three partners netted less than $10,000 together, Cederbergh published statistics backing his claim.  In 1911 the president of the state legislature reckoned Grant's annual take at the slightly more modest figure of $20,000."<br>
<br>
Besides soliciting support against crimps with dollars-and-cents ap-
peals, the media dished out blame for the problem.  "It has always been inexplicable why abuses so flagrant and a business so devoid of honor and equity should be countenanced by the business men of a community, and be defended by the press," railed the Oregonian in reference to Astoria:<br>
<br>
"It seemed as if the whole community were willing to endorse this heinous outrage for the sake of the few thousands of dollars that were put in circulation by it." The article came to the pragmatic conclusion that ultimately the defeat of crimps would generate revenue for Astoria by attracting more tonnage to the port (a prediction that became a stock phrase for consuls, though in reference to Portland).<br>
<br>
One of these fiscal arguments were in the interest of new legislation, but for years the more powerful crimps found ways to
manipulate or avoid the resulting laws.  The Astoria City Council neglccted until 1891 to appoint a harbor master, as required by the 1889 state law, and Portland's appointee proved to be a paper tiger.<br>
<br>
A 1903 bill established a state commission to license and monitor the sailors boarding houses; Grant and Sullivan's house immediately obtained the sole license in Portland, for the commission favored a citywide monopoly-as explained when Billy Smith and Harry White were turned down.  The latter sued, and the state supreme court ruled against the monopoly policy; but thereupon the two houses agreed to merge, and a de facto monopoly continued.<br>
<br>
Even down river the 1903 law effectively cut competition.  A boarding house called the "Sailor's Home" closed, insisting that "the new law was formed in the interest of certain Portland people" and citing restrictions and fees that drove smaller operations out of business. Later, Consul Cederbergh stated the same in stronger terms, calling the 1903 bill "the Larry Sullivan Law" and saying that it "was placed upon the statute books through the influence of the notorious boarding house master, Larry  Sullivan and his gang of crimps."<br>
<br>
The first challenge to the authorized crimps came in 1908, when the employment firm of Wisschusen & Jones opened expressly to hire seamen out for the modest fee of ten dollars each.  When Jack Grant, who had taken Sullivan's place as leader of the firm, raised an uproar, the city council revoked Wisschusen & Jones's business twice by special ordinance on the grounds that they had not gone through the boarding house commission.<br>
<br>
However, Mayor Harry Lane vetoed the ordinance, ruling that any employment agency had the right to handle the seafaring as well as any other occupation.  "Sailors must be slaves no more," he expounded.  "Portland has the unenviable reputation of being the only large port in the world where this unfair employment system is allowed.<br>
<br>
In the throes of this dispute, Wisschuscn bitterly declared to the newspapers that "ship owners are as anxious as anyone else to skin the poor sailor"; and that Portlanders, too, seemed content with the crimps' extortions."' Indeed, when the consulates began agitating for legislative action in 1909 the Oregonian twice urged that they "leave well enough alone," calling the new bill "more pernicious than any yet introduced" because it intended "to repeal the law which prohibits crimping."<br>
<br>
That "professional jawsmith" Andrew Furuseth, of seamen's union fame, even came to Salem to support the reform.<br>
<br>
But at the legislative session, House Representative John McCue stalled the bill and prevented its passage, according to Senate
President Ben Selling.  He later charged that McCue worked for Jack Grant; that in 1909 he stole the sailors bill, produced it from his pocket after the assembly adjourned, and waved it in the air yelling, "What are you going to do about it?"<br>
<br>
Another sailors bill was on the docket in 1911 again with McCue <B>in</B> opposition.  The Oregon Journal echoed Selling's suspicions that McCue worked for Grant, and added that "whoever his employer, he <B>is </B>apparently earning his salary.  No lobbyist ... could possibly compete with him.<br>
<br>
This time, however, Grant and McCue's faction could not depend on the community's inertia.  National circumstances intervened and lent urgency to the clean-up of Portland: "Commercial Bodies Want Port Made as Popular as Possible before Panama Canal Is Completed," ran a headline." The new law attempted to divorce completely the employment of sailors from the boarding of them; it imposed heavy fines for charging more than ten dollars per sailor, tightened the shipping commissioner's control, and took steps to ensure that the commissioner had no investment at stake with the shipping business.<br>
<br>
Although Consul James Laidlaw's obituary <B>in </B>1913 hailed him as "the man who wiped out [the] shanghai evil," one must wonder how thor-
oughly he did so: Jack Grant, as head of the Oregon State Shipping Board, still had the shipping business firm in hand when he cued in 1921, and Captain McDonald of the Moshula later confessed that as late as 1927 or 1928 he got a crew through a Portland "man of evil repute" called Shanghai White (perhaps one of the brothers who worked with Billy Smith).<br>
<br>
Frank Earl Hammond of Portland told the Oregonian in 1978 that he was a latter-day shanghai victim as well.  When he got back (perhaps in the late 1920s), "things were different.  Progress was a-coming and those tunnels were destroyed.  Things were so different that even the shanghaiers were out of business.  A few years later they even tore down the waterfront.  I guess I was one of the last to get shanghaied out of Portland.<br>
<br>
Crimping settled on the banks of the Columbia River through the ef-
forts of a few individuals, most of them ex-seamen, all of them familiar with the business from other ports.  San Francisco, New York, Baltimore, New Orleans, and Tacoma, as well as some Canadian and European ports, share a common history of crimping and shanghaiing.  Elsewhere, as in Oregon, crimping consisted of payoffs, politics, organized crime, union bashing, shanghaiing, and, more generally, exploitation.<br>
<br>
And not by coincidence, crimping began to wane all over the country early in this century for on top of local measures opposing crimps
there were larger forces at work.<br>
<br>
"I don't know when or where Bunco died," Spider Johnson told a reporter, but whenever he died, Bunco Kelly died in his time.  Steam was coming in, and that is what killed shanghaiing. When steam came in, it knocked out close to fifty percent of the men needed to man a ship.  When you cut off half a crew, this technological unemployment means something.  That's what steam did."<br>
<br>
Besides halving the crew, the increased efficiency of steam shipping sharply reduced the total number of vessels needed in the industry.  A steamship carried up to twice the freight of a square-rigger and made the voyage in less time.<br>
<br>
This minor industrial revolution arrived late in the United States compared to other countries; American ship owners, clinging to the glory of the clipper era and its leftover vessels, did not spend money modernizing the fleet until foreign competition and foreign wars provided the motivation.<br>
<br>
Not to belittle the significance of state and national legislation or the efforts of millions, it is undeniable that the pace of waterfront reforms closely matched the steamship's progress.  As Spider Johnson said, "There were a lot of what they call crusades against shanghaiing in Portland, and they had some effect, but the steamship is what killed shanghaiing.<br>

SHANGHAIIING FOR THE WHALERS.<br>
<br>
Simeon Oliver with Alden Hatch, "Shanghaiiing for the Whalers," <B>Son of the Smoky Sea.</B> New York: Julian Messner, Inc, 1941, p. 106-121.<br>
<br>
Kutan is the next island eastward of Unalaska.  The Whaling Station, where I worked that spring of <B>1</B>922 was on the bay about a mile by water from Akutan village.  It was a busy place at that time of the year.  About one hundred men were employed there and three ships hunted the whales we processed.<br>
<br>
They brought in from seven to ten of the great seagoing mammals daily, and sometimes, when we ran behind, there would be as many as thirty whales lying anchored off the float.  Sperms, sulphur-bottoms, finbacks and humpbacks, they were all grist to our mill.<br>
<br>
We would hook a heavy chain around the tail of one of these monsters; eighty to ninety feet long they ran, weighing
approximately a ton to the foot.  The hoisting engine would be started and slowly the great hulk would slide up the inclined float out of the water.<br>
<br>
When it was securely fastened on the platform we'd attack it with heavy cutting tools.  One man cut into the head, where a great reservoir of hundreds of gallons of free oil lay ready to be barreled.  Others cut through the four-foot layer of blubber, loosening one end of it.<br>
<br>
Then the chain was securely hooked into the tough fat; the hoisting engine was started again and the long, thick slice of dirty white blubber was peeled cleanly off and hauled away to the trying kettles.  Every bit of the carcass was utilized.  The parts which yielded no oil or bone were ground up for fertilizer.<br>
<br>
One of the most valuable parts was the baleen, the sieve of wiry teeth which fills the mouth of a whale.  Through it the water rushes as the great beast cruises slowly along the feeding grounds, and it strains out all but the tiny, cellular creatures which nourish these monsters. His baleen is the stuff of which whalebone for women's corsets is made.<br>
<br>
No sooner was one whale cut up than another was hauled out.  The place hummed with industry and smelled to high heaven.  I tell you we were a tired crew at the end of the long day's work.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless we usually seemed to have energy enough left for a walk over the hills or a trip across the bay <B>to </B>the tiny village of Akutan.  In this little settlement of perhaps seventy-five people <B>there </B>was a dance hall, and in it we would spend harmlessly gay evenings.<br>
<br>
Sometimes in our bunkhouse we would put on a dance ourselves.  Since most of the workers were Norwegians, the music usually consisted of Scandinavian waltzes and polkas, played by a fiddle and accordion.  How the rough boards shivered under the crash of heavy boots, tripping to the fast measures! How the rafters rang when we burst into song.<br>
<br>
The whaling ships, which fought through the roaring seas to bring in the raw material to our factory, were trim little vessels no more than a hundred feet in length.  They were driven by powerful steam engines and could buck the wildest storms, the fastest tides.  A single mast bore a crow@s-nest in which the lookout always perched, swaying dizzily abovc the towering seas.<br>
<br>
At the bow was <B>a </B>harpoon gun manned by an expert gunner, who with dcliberate aim and mechanical precision, performed the task, which used to be done by the hardy lanceman standing up in the plunging bow of a whaleboat under the very shadow of his fearsome prey.<br>
<br>
A crew of ten manned these little ships; and, though they had an
easier life than the whalers of an earlicr day, they had need to be hardy men.  Their quarters were cramped and their work long and arduous.  They must sleep when and where they could, and ever be ready for the kill.<br>
<br>
The toughest part of them had to be their stomachs, for the little ships bounced and gyrated through the waves in a way to make a destroyer seem like a rocking-horse, and the food on them, prepared in a tiny galley with the stove at any angle including the perpendicular, was terrible.  Black coffee by the gallon was the mainstay of life.<br>
<br>
At that it was luxury compared to the ships of even a decade before.  When I was a small boy, the famous whalers of the time would all put in at Unalaska as they followed their prey to the northward when the arctic ice began to drift.  Karluk, Herman and Belvedere, the Beluga and the Fearless commanded by such men as Captains Fred Tilton and Ted Petersen; and the famous Captain Bob Bartlett.<br>
<br>
Splendid names those old ships bore, and fine seamen commanded them; but living conditions aboard were indescribable.<br>
So bad were they that few men would voluntarily sign aboard a whaler and most of the crews were shanghaied from the San Francisco <B>waterfront.  </B>The would be a month from port when they reached the Aleutians, and the pressed crews would be raving to escape.<br>
<br>
To prevent any such attempt the ships would anchor five miles or more from shore and send picked men in their whaleboats to secure essential supplies.  But even this precaution did not always discourage the frantic crew.<br>
<br>
I remember one occasion on which a posse of armed sailors from a whaler came on shore to report several members of their crew missing.  They searched the village and all the surrounding country, but could find no one.  The ship remained at anchor for a week; and all that time the manhunt went on.  In the end she was obliged to sail away short handed.<br>
<br>
It is cold in Unalaska in April.  A man could hardly expect to survive more than a few minutes in the freezing waters of the Bering Sea.  Nevertheless these men had dived overboard and swum the long miles into Dutch Harbor.  There, in a cave in the cliffs on a deserted stretch of beach, they had lain while the posse passed them by.<br>
<br>
They could not go to the village for food lest they be taken.  They dared not light a fire, for the smoke would be seen.  Their sufferings must have been fearful and yet, such was their horror of being taken back to their ship, that they endured all, while gradually, as the long week dragged on, the splendid strength which had enabled them to survive that five mile swim through Arctic seas, ebbed away.<br>
<br>
Months later a native found their bodies huddled in the cave.

KELLY, THE KING OF THE SMUGGLERS<br>
<br>
(Lucile McDonald, "Kelly, the King of the Smugglers, Guemes, Sinclair Islands were headquarters of notorious operator in years long past." <B>Seattle Times.</B> March 29, 1959.).<br>
<br>
The waters of Bellingham Channel between Guemes and Sinclair Islands were once the haunt of the Puget Sound country's most storied smuggler, Lawrence Kelly.<br>
<br>
Tales told about Kelly are more numerous than the known facts. Historians have touched on him vaguely. He is said to have served once in the British armed services and to have ben a sailor on a vessel which called at New Orleans at the outbreak of the Civil War. There he enlisted in the Louisiana Tigers and fought for the Confederacy.<br>
<br>
Kelly arrived in Seattle about 1872 and sometime between that year and 1878 established himself on the southwest point of Guemes Island which today bears his name. He married Lizzie Kotz in 1877.<br>
<br>
Kelly's cabin was in the woods, which only in the past year have been stripped from the point. His bluff commanded a far reaching view of Rosario Strait and of Guemes and Bellingham Channels. This was a definite asset in his chosen profession.<br>
<br>
One historical researcher says of Kelly, "He maintained his part time family life in the cabin on the point and established another base on  Sinclair Inlet."<br>
<br>
Smuggling goods from Vancouver Island to Washington afforded profits tempting to island boat owners. The illicit trade had been going on since the late 1850s. It took a big spurt when Chinese laborers were imported to build railroads and work in the mines.<br>
<br>
With the influx of Chinese came the trade in opium, a product in which Kelly specialized, though he was not above earning an illegal dollar carrying Chinese passengers, Chinese wine or any other profitable commodity.<br>
<br>
A yarn is told about Square Bay, on the northeast corner of Guemes Island. An old resident said he saw Kelly's sloop anchored in the small harbor. The two men chatted a while, then Kelly shouted, " Come out John, he's o.k.," whereupon the tall grass erupted Chinese. There seemed to have been one hiding behind every bush around the bay.<br>
<br>
The first official mention of Kelly in the United States Customs files for the Puget Sound District was December 21, 1882, when his sloop was seized at LaConner with forty cases of red and white Chinese wine on board. he was fined one hundred sixty dollars.
A newspaper that week related:<br>
<br>
"For some months past a systematic course of smuggling has been going on between British Columbia and points in this district. Collector Bush has been indefatigable in attempting to ferret out the guilty parties and on Sunday night last Special Officer Thomas Caine captured a sloop valued at $250 and $400 worth of Chinese wine at LaConner."<br>
<br>
Kelly was in the sloop at the time of his capture but the loss did not discourage him. Records show that on July 8, 1883 he paid another fine of $390 and on the following November 17, $20.00.<br>
<br>
The profits in Kelly's illicit wares were so high that he took great risks. He managed to keep away from the law until Mary 16, 1886 when his Whitehall boat, sail and oars were seized at Tacoma with 567 tins of prepared opium on board. This was equivalent to 364 pounds of the drug.  His craft bore no name, the inspector reported. Newspapers commented that Kelly was "...an old time offender."<br>
<br>
Kelly was bound over to District Court for trial and his bail was set at three thousand dollars. A boatman named Main and a witness named Willis also were required to post bond. Kelly was fined one hundred dollars on July 31.<br>
<br>
The officers continued to watch the king of the smugglers. A February 1, 1889 telegram from a customs officer in Bellingham reported, "Kelly left Bellingham Bay today with stuff for his island"<br>
<br>
However, it was not until March l3, 1891 that Kelly met his real downfall. Special Agent Charles J. Mulkey saw Kelly in the smoking car of a train en route from Tacoma to Portland, a large new russet-colored valise carefully parked at his feet. When Mulkey inquired as to its contents, Kelly answered, "Clothing."<br>
<br>
Mulkey was suspicious and opened the bag. In it he found 65 cans of unstamped opium worth about $450.<br>
<br>
Kelly declared angrily and profanely that no revenue officer ever would take him, but Mulkey was firm and transferred him to a north bound train at Castle Rock. Mulkey took along as witness the man who occupied the seat with Kelly.<br>
<br>
Kelly, taken before the United States commissioner in Tacoma, the same day insisted the bag was not his. He had left his grip on the seat when he went to the wash room he said and on his return he had found that it had been replaced by another.<br>
<br>
"Kelly is an old steam boat man formerly employed on the steamer <B>North Pacific</B>," said a contemporary newspaper account of the case.<br>
<br>
"For several years he had made his home on Cottonwood (Sinclair)
Island near Anacortes. He lately fitted out a new sloop for his cruises. It has no name and is said to be fast and in front of the tiller is a small shelf where Kelly keeps an arsenal of revolvers and pistols.<br>
<br>
"About two months ago, Canadian authorities arrested Kelly at Victoria and fined him $300 for leaving the harbor without clearing. A few years ago he was tried in Tacoma, convicted of<br>
smuggling and served a term in the penitentiary."<br>
<br>
Kelly's bond was set at a thousand dollars.<br>
<br>
Customs officers descended on Kelly's hide out at Sinclair Island two days later and seized the sloop <B>Alert</B>. They charged Kelly with smuggling and entering and leaving foreign ports without proper formalities, alleging he had gone to Victoria without clearing and returned about January 30 to New Whatcom.<br>
<br>
Although the officers could not prove it, they believed Kelly had smuggled in 1880 cans of opium. He went to Victoria again March 4, the officers said, and returned four days later with a large quantity of the drug.<br>
<br>
The <B>Alert</B> was sold at a marshal's sale for $3,221.83. There is no record of how those charges against Kelly were disposed of.<br>
<br>
Sometime before 1906 Kelly was arrested in Seattle and again served a term.<br>
<br>
Fred Splitstone's history of Orcas Island says that in May, 1909, Kelly pleased guilty to another smuggling charge and was sentenced to a year at the McNeil Island penitentiary. On his release he found that going straight meant hard times. He got in touch with the Daughters of the Confederacy and was admitted to a Confederate Soldiers home in Louisiana where he died.<br>
<br>
So ended the 25 year career of one of the most notorious smugglers on the Pacific Coast.<br>
<br>
(Lucile McDonald, "Kelly, King of the Smugglers," <B>Seattle Times.</B> March 29, 1959.).<br>
<br>
TRACKING THE SMUGGLERS<br>
<br>
(Lucile McDonald," Old records tell how Puget Sound customs men went about tracking the smugglers," <B>Seattle Times.</B> July 27, 1952.).<br>
<br>
Smugglers of opium and Chinese furnished exciting activity for the Puget Sound customs officers for twenty years or more. Details of how smugglers were trapped or more often, got away, are revealed in a mass of records recently transferred here from Port Townsend and now being catalogued in the Collector of Customs' office in the Federal building.
By the time headquarters of the customs district moved to Seattle on Jul 1, 1913, Chinese no longer were so much in the news. The Exclusion Act of 1882, designed to suspend importation of Oriental laborers for a ten year period, spurred the smugglers. Until then, coolies had been brought in freely to supply cheap labor for canneries, hop yards, mines and public works. As many as 15,000 were employed in the construction of the Northern Pacific Railroad.<br>
<br>
After the ban was put on the Chinese, Puget Sound was the hole in the fence through which they entered. They continued to arrive in British Columbia from Hong Kong in groups of one to seven hundred on English vessels docking every three weeks. Canada gave them ninety days in which to leave the country.<br>
<br>
The United states had been advertised to the Chinese as the promised land. some years prior to passage of the law this country had done considerable recruiting of Oriental labor. When the door was suddenly closed against the Orientals, they continued to take a chance on getting through.<br>
<br>
No penalty was attached to any Chinese making the attempt and when caught he did not have to pay his expenses back to his starting place. Some  tried so often their faces were familiar to the customs men, who at that time also constituted the immigration service.<br>
<br>
In 1880 statistics showed 3,186 Chinese legally living in Washington. When smuggling commenced the general scheme ws to channel newly arrived Oriental to places where they could be lost among their brethren already in the country.<br>
<br>
Small sailing vessels, ostensibly fishing boats used to lie at anchor at a buoy off the Indian reservation at the entrance to Victor Harbor. Chinese would be taken out to them and transported to a hiding place at James or Sidney Islands. When enough were gathered to make a run advisable, all were picked up from their camp and the sloop made for Dungeness or some place near Port Townsend, arriving after dark and departing in the night.<br>
<br>
The Chinese were instructed how to proceed from the beach to a place of security among their countrymen in a nearby town.<br>
<br>
An opium cargo was a little more difficult because it would not walk to its final destination but had to be carried there by some person.<br>
<br>
A refinery of crude opium existed in Victoria, where the poppy gum was boiled, skimmed and prepared for smoking. It could be imported by paying duty, but evading the tariff by smuggling was more profitable. Another devise was to sweat off the stamps and apply them to cans on which the import tax had not been paid.<br>
<br>
A feature of the illicit traffic was adulteration. A purchaser of smuggled drugs could not squeal. Some revealing entries form the
customs house seizure books read like this:<br>
<br>
"June 2, 1894. New Whatcom--200 cans supposed to contain opium upon examination found to contain a substance resembling tar."<br>
<br>
March 27, 1892--found at Howard and Bryant's wharf, Seattle-five-
tael tins of prepared opium. With them 318 five tael tins containing molasses and flour."<br>
<br>
"June 11, 1892 at Seattle. Four five-tael tins of opium and 349 tins of molasses."<br>
<br>
In July, 1885, more than one hundred twenty pounds of opium were confiscated on Puget Sound. Today the "revenuer" do not pick up that quantity in years. The next month 880 tins or 40 pounds of the narcotic comprised a single haul taken from a sloop at Discovery Bay. The offender, who was apprehended, had among his equipment a revolver, two different types of spy glasses, a call whistle and a bottle of strychnine.<br>
<br>
However, smugglers seldom were caught. The seizure book is filled with entries marked "owner unknown." this was the  case with four trunks containing 1,300 tins found in the Northern Pacific station at Spokane and turned over to the Port Townsend collection.<br>
<br>
Instead of being destroyed, the drug was sold at auction, and the lot brought more than $7,000 a fantastically low sum in terms of present values.<br>
<br>
The seizure book shows frequent losses through cans being thrown overboard or floated ashore. Written in memos are such line as "20 five-tael tins containing salt water mixed with opium and molasses," --double adulteration--and "shipment damaged and leaking water badly."<br>
<br>
The hundreds of reports have a certain sameness. If you put them all together the details fall into a pattern.  Everybody knew about smuggling. The light keeper at Dungeness could see Chinese arriving and being taken ashore in canoes. He saw schooners which always departed by 3:00 o'clock in the morning. When seized, the craft invariably had a fishing net usually rotten and worthless.<br>
<br>
The Orientals landed on the beach. Maybe there was a Chinese garden nearby where the personnel changed frequently. Some nights the dogs at Chimacum set up a mysterious barking. That mean Chinese on the run, trying to reach Port Discovery or some place where friends would push them along.<br>
<br>
Bound books contain telegrams via the Puget Sound Telegraph Company, hand written bearing messages like these:<br>
<br>
"Victoria--Boat leaving tonight for Port Discovery Bay Charley Cook's landing at hotel 400 pounds opium. Probably reach there tomorrow night. Hanson."
"Whatcom--Kelly,(doubtless, Lawrence Kelly of Sinclair Island, most famous smuggler on the Sound in the 1880s) left Bellingham Bay today with stuff for his island. Also another sloop went down the Sound with stuff. W. Wheeler."<br>
<br>
"Victoria--Small sloop about three ton register with white stripes on rail left here 12 o'clock last night for Whatcom l00 pounds on board two men."<br>
<br>
There was money in the business. The Chinese were mostly agriculturists in their homeland. They paid from fifty to one hundred dollars to make the crossing from Victoria and there were plenty of boatmen ready to take the risk. The opium went along with them on the same trip.<br>
<br>
So profitable was smuggling that officials were not above dipping into it, to the scandal of the service. A letter from an agent in Victoria telling of the Canadian Pacific steamer <B>Albany</B> in November 1888 landing a consignment of 6,618 pounds of opium in British Columbia includes this astonishing sidelight on the trade:<br>
<br>
"Singularly enough," the informant wrote, " the well known evangelist Moody appears to be a factor in the suppression of opium smuggling indirectly at least, as h is conversion of Chet Terry, late holding an important position in the custom house in Port Townsend, but who had been in refuge over here form some months, and the restitution by the ex inspector to the United States government of some six thousand dollars through the hand of Moody would prove, I may say, that I know this to be true."<br>

Gordon R. Newell," Smuggling Once Big Business in Tacoma.Huge Ring Smashed By Ledger's Expose," <B>Tacoma Sunday Ledger-News Tribune.</B> November 21, 1954.<br>
<br>
When the Alaska steamer <B>Portland</B> entered Puget Sound on July 17, 1897 she carried a fabulous cargo that was to bring fame to herself and prosperity to the Pacific Northwest. Her cargo, of course, was the legendary "ton of gold" that sparked the Klondyke stampede; the Alaska gold rush. To this day the <B>Portland</B> has maintained her place in western shipping annals as the Alaskan treasure ship.<br>
<br>
Not so well known is the old ship's even earlier history; a history of smuggling, graft and corruption that rocked the nation. Under another name, the famous <B>Portland</B> carried on one of the greatest smuggling operations ever engineered, operating for a ring that included government customs officers, political and financial leaders and even a special agent of the United States Secret
Service. So powerful was the gang of smugglers that its members seemed beyond the reach of the law. . . until a reporter from <B>The Tacoma Ledger</B> stepped into the picture. His one-man crusade smashed the mighty criminal syndicate in a ruin of prison sentences and lost fortunes.<br>
<br>
The <B>Portland</B> was built at Bath, Maine, in 1885, serving as an Atlantic coastal liner for several years under the name Haytian Republic. She retained that name when in the early 1890s she was transferred to the Pacific Coast, operating between San Francisco, Portland and Tacoma for a firm known as Merchants Steamship Company. The firms legitimate shipping activities were largely a front for the smuggling of opium and alien Chinese from Canada into the United States.<br>
<br>
Money In Chinese<br>
<br>
At that time it was perfectly legal to import opium, providing the duty of $12 a pound were paid, but by evading this payment smugglers could make vast profits on the drug. Sums ranging from $100 to $150 a head were being paid for the delivery of "contraband" Chinese from Canada to the United States. The Haytian Republic, along with the Michigan and Wilmington of the same firm, were the carriers of this lucrative freight.<br>
<br>
Small boats, met the incoming liners in the Straits of Juan de Fuca; coolies and dope were quickly and efficiently transferred. Tacoma, the line's Puget Sound terminus, was the distribution point for the incoming cargoes. It was common knowledge that most of the trains leaving Tacoma carried from 10 to 100 pounds of undeclared opium for the firm's southern outlets; that Chinese by the hundreds were being moved out of town by night.<br>
<br>
Everyone seemed to know about it, but no one did anything about it; no one except Nelson A. Bennett, who was then owner and publisher of <B>The Tacoma Ledger.<br>
</B><br>
Bennett called in assistant editor and special writer Stephen W. De Lacy. De Lacy was just back from covering the 1893 session of the legislature at Olympia, where he had done an outstanding job. Bennett felt he was just the man for another important assignment. The conference ended in a well simulated quarrel, and De Lacy stamped out of the publisher's office, loudly announcing that he was "through working for The Ledger."<br>
<br>
From then on he was on his own, picking up his pay and expenses through a bank rather than at the newspaper office. His special assignment was known only to himself and Bennett.<br>
<br>
Begins at Victoria<br>
<br>
Going first to Victoria, where he felt most of the illegal shipments originated, De Lacy conferred with an old newspaper friend, Martin Egan at the office of the Victoria Times. Egan, who
later became a noted Associated Press war correspondent in the Russo-Japanese war, agreed to help him.<br>
<br>
Working together, the two newsmen made several interesting discoveries, among them the fact that a special secret service agent, assigned to break up the smuggling ring, appeared to be one of its leading members. Almost all the customs personnel were either in the deal or going around with their eyes shut. The one exception was an inspector named Coblentz, who met De Lacy secretly, confirmed what was going on, and agreed to keep him supplied with information. But even Coblentz, an honest cop, was afraid to openly testify against the powerful combine.<br>
<br>
Things were stalemated when De Lacy got his big break. The smuggling steamers Michigan and Wilmington were wrecked. The Wilmington losing a valuable shipment of both Chinese immigrants and opium. The syndicate refused to make good the costs of the lost shipment, and a Victoria wholesaler was left holding the bag to the tune of some $15,000, a sizable loss in the 1890s.<br>
<br>
Canadian newsman Egan saw his opportunity. He convinced the unhappy Canadian exporter that De Lacy was a United States government agent who could probably get back at least a part of his lost fortune for him if he cooperated in exposing the syndicate.<br>
<br>
Exporter Tells All<br>
<br>
The Canadian jumped at the bait. When De Lacy denied having any connection with the government, the smuggler merely attributed it to the natural reticence of an authentic secret service operative. He was thoroughly disgusted with smuggling as a profession, desired to clear his conscience, and he wouldn't take no for an answer.<br>
<br>
Trying not to show his elation, De Lacy saw the case breaking Wide open. The Canadian furnished him with a stack of letters, telegrams and receipts from the smuggling syndicate, along with a copy of the key by which all of them could be deciphered.<br>
<br>
It was all the proof he needed. Special officers were dispatched from Washington, D.C., and when the Haytian Republic next entered port she was searched by inspectors who didn't have their eyes shut. Five hundred ounces of opium were found behind the canned foods stacked on the galley shelves.<br>
<br>
Then the coded papers unearthed by De Lacy were published in The Ledger with the key by which they could be translated from the language of legitimate business to the parlance of thieves. Ledger readers had a wonderful time working out the smugglers; code for themselves, the greatest scoops in West Coast journalistic history, and the criminal syndicate was finished.<br>
<br>
Some Fled Country<br>
<br>
The crooked secret service agent got a year in prison and a $5,000
fine, as did a number of ex-customs agents. Others arrested included the U.S. collector of customs at Portland, along with 11 of his staff, the president of the Merchants' Steamship Company, and many of its stockholders. Others, tipped off in advance, boarded Orient-bound ships before warrants could be served on them. Nearly all of those arrested were convicted and sent to prison, while the U.S. Customs Service underwent the greatest shake-up in its history.<br>
<br>
Ironically, the honest cop, Coblentz, met as tragic a fate as any of the guilty. Appointed warden of the state prison at Walla Walla, he committed suicide when minor irregularities were found in the prison accounts - a man who had turned down dishonest thousands becoming the victim of petty graft. The newsman, De Lacy, was appointed United States deputy collector of customs at Tacoma, a position which he held for many years.<br>
<br>
And the old Haytian Republic, seized and sold at auction by the government, became the famed Alaskan liner <B>Portland</B>, bringing a ton of gold and a whole new era to the Puget Sound country. Years later her amazing past almost forgotten; she was carrying ore between Alaska and the Tacoma smelter until her final stranding at the Kalalla River mouth in 1910. So ended the adventurous career of a ship that proved again the truth of the ancient adage:<br>
<br>
Truth is stranger than fiction!<br>

The customs officers had known that opium was being smuggled
through Tacoma and December 11, 1889, they searched the steamer Olympia, just arrived from Victoria.  They found no contraband, but officers detailed to watch saw three row boats passing close to the steamer the next day at daylight.

<br>

The smugglers had <B>130 </B>pounds of opium.

A few days before this, John Sullivan, runner for the Hotel Grandolfo, was standing on the railroad wharf shortly after the steamer Hassalo bad departed when be saw several brown paper-covered packages floating in the water.  Sullivan fished them out.  They consisted of seven packages connected with a cord, each containing twenty five-metal cans of opium.  Deputy Collector Hayden estimated its value at $1,050 and one-fourth of this amount later was paid to Sullivan.<br>

R.H. Calkins, "Days of Puget Sound Smugglers," <B>High Tide.</B> Seattle: Marine Digest, 1952, p. 24-27.<br>
<br>
Bizarre attempts to smuggle opium, Chinese and wool into the United States and how Puget Sound virtually was made narcotic proof by two government officers more than 45 years ago, make up one of the most colorful stories in Pacific Northwest shipping.<br>
<br>
Rear Adm.  W. H. Munter, United States Coast Guard, retired, and Roy L. Ballanger, retired assistant collector of customs in the Washington District, had stellar roles in the successful effort to halt the daring operations of smugglers on Puget Sound.<br>
<br>
It was on May 13, 1905, that the government carried into execution long-studied plans to break up the smuggling of wool from Canada to Puget Sound, which was assuming major proportions.<br>
<br>
Wool was 22c a pound higher in the United States than in Canada and successful smugglers reaped a big profit.<br>
<br>
     
Customs Inspectors Ballanger and F. C. Dean left Port Townsend in an open boat and cruised along the San Juan Islands in the guise of seal hunters.  Dean had been a seal hunter before joining the customs service and knew the captains of the boats in this industry of other days.  Ballanger also was valuable to the govemment as he was reared on a farm, knew wool, and could shear a sheep.<br>
<br>
The two inspectors drifted -in their boat off Port Townsend until after dark and then headed for Canada.<br>
<br>
The boat had two pair of oars and carried a sail, and although<br>
the  progress  was  slow,  she  was  able  to  reach  Sydney,  Vancouver Island.<br>
<br>
Visiting all of the islands in the vicinity of Sydney and several sheep ranches, the inspectors told the farmers they were on a vaca-
tion, seeing the country and doing a little sealing In a short time, they had visited aR of the ranches suspected of being operated by wool smugglers.<br>
<br>
Their pockets were full of skewers-wooden pins used in securing meat to form-and while the ranchers, who were shearing sheep, were not looking, the inspectors placed them in the fleece.<br>
<br>
Ballanger and Dean became acquainted with a man by the name of Burke.  They found him loading wool at South Pender Island and followed him.  He crossed over to Orcas Island of the San Juans at night.  There they found a large quantity of wool in a barn.  It contained the skewers they had placed in the fleece.  The inspectors called Munter and he went to Oreas Island in the little Coast Guard cutter Arcata. (She was decommissioned in 1936, and is now only a memory on the waterfront.)<br>
<br>
The Arcata loaded the huge sacks of wool, which measured about seven feet in length and three feet in diameter.  There was so much wool on the deck of the Arcata that it reached almost to the smokestack.  The wool was landed in Port Townsend, where it was sold at govemment auction.<br>
<br>
Burke was arrested and tried in Seattle on a charge of smuggling, but the judge ruled he was not really seen crossing the border with the wool and he was released because of insufficient evidence.<br>
<br>
These were the days of "Pig Iron" Kelly and Larry Kelly, notorious opium smugglers, when it was lawful to import the drug if the duty of $12 a pound was paid.
There was an opium plant in Victoria, known as the Ly Yuen factory and one in Vancouver, known as the Ty Yuen factory.  Crude opium from India and China was cooked and made into round chunks as big as a bowling ball.  The opium, the gum and the sap of the poppy, was put into a copper pan over a charcoal fire.  As it cooked, it was stirred and skinnned by the Chinese.<br>
<br>
A big traffic in opium developed.  Firemen on ships had pockets in the back of their vests in which they carried the opium.  They wore large box-hanging coats to conceal the drug and carried between ten and twelve cans.  The smugglers, obtaining the opium in British Columbia, made about $5 a pound by avoiding the duty.<br>
<br>
Then came the embargo against opium and the drug reached the coast on ships from the Orient.  The Coast Guard began trailing vessels arriving from China and India as they came up the Sound, and when they shifted from dock to dock, to prevent opium smugglers from tossing the drug overboard to confederates.  Men also were placed in rowboats under the docks.<br>
<br>
Smugglers of Chinese did not stop at anything if they believed they were trapped.  They threw the Chinese overboard when they saw a Coast Guard cutter approaching.  Those who got through were<br>
landed on a lonely beach and walked until the boat operator met a confederate.<br>
<br>
Smugglers usually received from $100 to $500 a head for the<br>
successful delivery of Chinese in the United States.<br>
<br>
Puget Sound now is virtually narcotic-proof, wool-smuggling is just a story of other days, and the smuggling of Chinese seldom is attempted.<br>
<br>
Retiring from the Coast Guard, Admiral Munter "dropped anchor" here and now makes his home in Seattle.  As an active member of the Propeller Club, he keeps in close touch with maritime affairs and his many friends in the shipping industry.<br>
<br>
Admiral Munter came to Seattle in 1938 from Washington, D. C., where he was chairman of the Coast Guard's permanent board, which formulates Coast Guard policy.<br>
<br>
During his long tour of duty, Admiral Munter served 24 years in ships of the old Revenue Cutter Service and the Coast Guard.  He
was a lieutenant in the cutter Grant on Puget Sound during the winter of 1902 and 1903, made cruises in the cutter Manning to Bering Sea and Honolulu, and in 1925, visited Seattle as a member of a Coast Guard board.  He retired April 1, 1944 after nearly 45 years of Coast Guard service.<br>
<br>
Ballanger retired May 31, 1946 after 45 years in the United States Customs Service.  He died April 24, 1950.<br>

<br>
LARRY KELLY.<br>
<br>
The career of one of the Northwest's most notorious opium smugglers was ended is recalled by a revolver deposited with the Washington State historical society yesterday by Fred E. King of Puyallup.  The gun is a 32 caliber Smith & Wesson made to shoot rifle bullets.<br>
<br>
It was taken from Larry Kelly, for 32 years a successful smuggler, when he was caught by King and his associate, Fred C. Dean, July 18, 1908. He was captured near Anderson island as he was on the way to Olympia with a sloop load of opium for the peddlers who made their headquarters there.<br>
<br>
Said to have had powerful connections which reached even to the higher-ups at Washington, Kelly had for more than a quarter of a century been a thorn in the flesh of the Northwest federal men.  He got by when nobody else could but he came to grief when he failed to recognize a revenue launch which King and camouflaged as a fish boat.<br>
<br>
King, who was stationed at Tacoma, had been detailed by Collector C.W. Ide to look out for Pete Nelson and his partner, small fry smugglers, when he had a hunch that he was on Kelly's trail.  He reported to headquarters and Dean, then connected with the Port Townsend office, was sent to help him run down the clues.<br>
<br>
FIND CONNECTIONS IN OLYMPIA<br>
<br>
King had discovered that Kelly was dealing through a Chinese store at Olympia, running the opium from Victoria in a small sloop.  From
an ambush on Anderson island he watched Kelly's boat come and go and when he was sure of the schedule, sent to headquarters for a launch.<br>
<br>
At that time nearly every resident on the islands had a gas boat with a license number painted on the bow and usually had a log or timber picked up on the Sound towing behind.  When King's launch was left for him at McNeills island it was one of the regulation boats with a "watermelon" top and customs service written all over it.<br>
<br>
The first thing he did was to take the launch to the other side of the island, paint a number on the bow with charcoal, take off the top, and hitch a boom log on behind.  That little strategy turned the trick.<br>
<br>
King and Dean waited a few days longer and one morning saw Kelly's sloop headed down Sound. He had slipped by them and was going back to Victoria for another load.  King figured that he would be back in 10 days and made his plans accordingly.<br>
<br>
KELLY SAILS INTO THE ARMS OF THE LAW.<br>
<br>
Sure enough, 10 days later the federal men saw Kelly's sloop coming through the Narrows and started out to intercept him.  He paid no attention to the launch with a couple of ranchers chugging diagonally toward his course from Anderson island until it was too late.<br>
<br>
Like all the big crooks, Kelly knew when he was beaten and submitted to arrest.  When he turned his gun over he told King he hoded he might have it for his own because it was a "good one."<br>
<br>
Caught with the boat load of opium, it wasn't long before Kelly was serving a twoyear term on McNeil island.<br>
<br>
Because he was a model prisoner, Kelly was able to cut a few months from his term and had been out only a short time when he was back at the old aame.  A little while after a border patrol found him asleep near a campfire with 10 pounds of opium.<br>
<br>
That brought him a year's sentence and for a time after he was released he dropped out of sight.  One day a man was reported apparently very ill in a miserable shack on the beach near Port Townsend and a customs launch was sent to bring him in.  It was Kelly.  The customs men took him to the marine hospital at Port Townsend where de died a few days later, broke and friendless.<br>

<br>
The men with whom he had associated and assisted to make large profits from the illicit opium traffic, and the crooked officials and other grafters who had chiseled into his earnings, all deserted him when they found he could no longer keep out of the law's clutches.<br>
<br>
Of course, nobody having official connection would be expected to verify it, but there is plenty of evidence "off the record" to indicate that Kelly and others of his kind did not operate without sanction from some of those high in authority in Washington.<br>
<br>
It also is not going beyond the bounds of probability to say that certain Northwest business men who held their heads rather high profited from the activities of Kelly and other smugglers.<br>
<br>
In fact, Kelly's first arrest, when he was operating in Oregon, ijas due to an official with whom he had to split.  It seems that Kelly was due to meet this official at a certain time but in some way they missed connections.  The official assumed that Kelly had double-crossed him and turned him in.  A little while later the tables were turned and the official was behind the bars.<br>
<br>
Larry Kelly came to the end which is sooner or later reached by all who think they can beat the law, including the grafters who profit from ill gotten gains.  You just can't beat the game.<br>
<br>
King, retired, lives at Puyallup.  Dean is still in the service and is connected with the Seattle office.<br>

SMUGGLING<br>
<br>
Lucile S. McDonald, "A place for smugglers," <B>Making History, the people who shaped the San Juan Islands.</B> Friday Harbor: Harbor Press, 1990 p. 99-103.<br>
<br>
Smuggler's Row, a little bay on the east side of Henry Island, was named for the contrabandists who long ago ran in there for shelter after crossing Haro Strait with cargoes of opium, Chinese or wool.  I suppose it is the place where Deputy Customs Inspector O.H. Culver boarded Jim Kelly's boat Success in May 1889 and found the smuggler asleep, his small son on watch.<br>
<br>
"He came up with a revolver.  I was not prepared for a fight with an armed desperado such as Kelly had every appearance of being,"
Culver reported.<br>
<br>
The inspector uncovered no suspicious evidence; he had no choice but to bid farewell to Kelly.  Some officer better prepared would catch up with the smuggler sooner or later.<br>
<br>
The Kelly name is famed in the San Juans, but Lawrence Kelly, not Jim, was the real celebrity.  Tales told about Larry are more numerous than known facts.  Though his name is a byword, I found the two unrelated Kellys often confused and the written records were lean.  With good reason Larry courted little publicity.  His livelihood required anonyn-dty and seclusion.<br>
<br>
Lawrence Kelly was born in 1845, but records it was in Ohio or Ireland.  The federal census-taker never caught up with him.<br>
<br>
Larry Kelly was said to have begun his career on the coast of Maine smuggling mostly bonded whiskey.  When things became uncomfortable forhim he moved to Alaska and operated there until his profession again became difficult.  He is said to have been a sailor on a vessel which called at New Orleans at the outbreak of the Civil War.  There he enlisted in the Louisiana Tigers and fought for the Confederacy.  He told his children he had been a drummer.<br>
<br>
Kelly arrived in Seattle about 1872 and sometime between that year and 1878 established himself onthesouthwestpoint of Guemeslsland, which today bears his name.  He married Lizzie Kotz in 1877 when she was 16 and he was 32.  They had nine children in quick succession.<br>
<br>
Kelly's cabin was in the woods back of a bluff commanding a far-
reaching view of Rosario Straitand Guemes and Bellingham Channels.  This was a definite asset in his chosen profession.  Hehadalater base on Sinclair Island, half of which he purchased in March 1886.<br>
<br>
A few months afterward he deeded the property to Lizzie, to safeguard it from confiscation in case he had any brushes with the law.<br>
<br>
Smuggling from Vancouver Island to the Washington coast had been going on almost from the beginning of settlement of the San Juans.  The hidden coves and winding waterways, which afforded refuge for deserters from British naval vessels, were similarly encouraging for concealing staple purchases from Victoria.<br>
<br>
Customs authorities complained of "the great and increasing evil" among settlers, some of whom were storekeepers living with Indian women, whom they sent by canoe across Haro Strait for goods.  The
women returned at night with three to five tons of merchandise, landing them in places the revenue men could not reach.  So easy was it to hide contraband in the islands, the Roche Harbor inspector complained in 1897<br>
<br>
"Smugglers waltz up to the customs house in ballast, having left their stuff within easy reach in little harbors.  " After clearing with the officer, they went back and retrieved the hidden goods and continued merrily on their way.  Ordinary wool was a cargo which tempted reputable citizens.  Right after the shearing season inspectors watched for crossings to Henry, Spieden and Stuart Islands with Canadian fleece, which some ranchers took a chance on mixing with their own.<br>
<br>
Smuggler Larry Kelly dealt in more dangerous cargoes -- Oriental laborers, opium and Chinese wine.  It required anotherbrand of daring toengageinhisline.  Hewasthemosthuntedmaninsmugglingcircles in the Puget Sound country for more than two decades.<br>
<br>
The Chinese exclusion act of 1882 made smuggling Orientals a profitable business if one could get by with it.  Chinese in British Columbia willingly paid $100 or more to be put ashore inside the promised land of the Pacific Northwest, where they slipped away to build railroads and work in mines.<br>
<br>
To checkmate the smugglers, an immigration inspector, John M. Izett, was sent to Friday Harbor in May 1882.  In August 1883 the port of entry was changed to Roche Harbor.  Izett, besides his other duties, went out in a skiff and watched the entrance to San Juan Channel early in the morning and late in the evening.  It was a futile and lonely job because he lacked an adequate boat.<br>
<br>
With the influx of Chinese there was a demand for opium and wines the laborers had known in their own country- Kelly, specializing in all three items, was a clever fox, with a hundred hiding places.  One sympathizes with poor Izett, in his rowboat, when he received notification in October 1882 that Kelly had left Victoria in his sloop, with 20 cases of wine.  "Do what you can to take him," were Izett's instructions.  He hadn't a Chinaman's chance.<br>
<br>
The popular belief prevails that Kelly and others of his ilk, if stopped by the revenue service cutters, threw their cargo, live or packages, overboard.  This seems to have been largely a myth.  Official records made no such accusations, nor even hinted at them.  But Chinese evidently wereput ashorebysmugglers on barren rocks, such as Goose Island in San Juan Channel, when a cutter was in pursuit.<br>
<br>
A picnic party camped at Davis Bay on the south side of Lopez
Island in 1885 reported seeing an Oriental brou- ght in, weak and ill, from a barren islet called Deadman Island.  "He seemed to have been abandoned," said the narrator.  "That same day a boat load of his countrymen from the Flowery Kingdom came gliding in, occupying a smart clinker-built boat propelled by white oarsmen.  It soon appeared that a smuggler of Chinese had brought his cargo out of sight ... he pretended to have rescued them from a perilous position."<br>
<br>
A yarn is told about Square Bay on the northeast corner of Guemes Island.    Anold resident saw Kelly's sloop anchored in the small harbor.  The two men chatted a while, then Kelly shouted, "Come out, John, he's O.K., " whereupon the tall grass erupted Chinese.  One seemed to have been hiding behind every bush around the bay.<br>
<br>
The law first caught up with Kelly on December 21,1882, when his sloop was seized at LaConner with 40 cases of red and white Chinese wine on board.  He was fined $160.  Kelly was in the sloop at the time of its capture, but the loss did not discourage him.  On July 3,1883, he paid another fine of $390 and on the following November 17, $20.<br>
<br>
Then in January 1884, customs inspector John M. Izett received a typical communication from the collector of customs, saying: "An English sloop took on board at Cadboro Bay 130 pounds of opium and mostlikely will cross to StuartandWaldron Islands and transfer it to an American sloop.  We think it goes to Whatcom.  The opium is in tin boxes of 15 pounds each.<br>
<br>
A Chinaman at Cadboro Bay appears to be in on the transaction and may accompany the vessel to make the delivery. (Larry) Kelly is at his old trade, running opium and wine.  He had over 80 cases a short time ago.  He has a long black sloop, narrow, with a small house forward. Some time she is in a rowboat.  He says no custom<br>
<br>
house man can take him."<br>
<br>
Kelly managed to remain out of the clutches of the officers until May 16, 1886, when his Whitehall boat, sail and oars were seized at Tacoma.  He had on board 567 tins of prepared opium, equivalent to 364 pounds of drugs.  They cost him another $100 fine, but the profits in these illicit wares were high.<br>
<br>
Officers continued to watch the smuggler king.A February l,1889, telegram from Bellingham reported, "Kelly left Bellingham today with stuff for his island." By then he was a resident of Sinclair, where he bought the homestead of Thomas P. Hogin and became a member of the island school board, as he had several children.<br>

Things went well with him the next two years, but in March l891 he came up against the real thing in enforcement.  Special Agent Charles  Mulkey saw the smuggler riding in the smoking car of a train en route from Tacoma to Portland, a large new russet-colored leather valise carefully parked at his feet.<br>
<br>
When Mulkey inquired as to its contents Kelly answered, "Clothing." Mulkey was suspicious and opened the bag.  In it he found 65 cans of opium, worth about $450.<br>
<br>
Kelly declared angrily and profanely that no revenue officer was going to take him, but Mulkey was firm and transferred Larry to a north bound train at Castle Rock.  Mulkey took along as witness the man who occupied the seat with Kelly.  When Kelly was arraigned the same day, he declared the bag was not his.  He said he had left his grip on the seat when he went to the washroom and on his return found it had been replaced by another.<br>
<br>
A newspaper account of the case stated Kelly had recently fitted out a new sloop for his cruises.  It had no name, was very fast, and its owner kept an arsenal of revolvers and pistols on a small shelf near the tiller.  "About two months ago," it added, "Canadian authorities offested Kelly at Victoria and fined him $300 for leaving the harbor without clearing.  A few years ago he was tried in Tacoma, convicted of smuggling and served a term in the penitentiary."<br>
<br>
Kelly's bond was set at $1,000, but the customs men were not through with him.  Two days later they descended on his hideout at Sinclairlsland and seized the sloop which was sold at a marshal's sale, after his trial, for $3,221.<br>
<br>
The smuggler's luck was running out.  His wife sold portions of his island in 1894 and 1896 and after that he owned no property.  Smug-
gling of Chinese diminished, the British Columbia authorities having tightened their surveillance.<br>
<br>
Lizzie Kelly quit living with her errant spouse in March 1898 and, to support herbrood, was keeping house for a man in Anacortes whose wife was hospitalized.  One day Kelly got drunk and, anned with a<br>
revolver, paid a call on LIzzie, announcing he was about to kill her.  She fled to a neighbor and the town marshal went looking for Kelly, who returned next day, rattled the door and announced he was still out for blood.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Kelly filed a complaint, charging assault with a dangerous weapon and declared Larry had "shown a willful, malignant and abandoned heart."<br>

The case was dismissed by the superior court the following January and Kelly was not heard of again until the customs men received word he was making trips out of Victoria.  It was 1902 before he was picked up in Portland and sent to the county jail for having $800 worth of opium in his possession.<br>
<br>
In January 1905 he was caught in Tacoma with 120 cans of the drug aboard a sloop.  That brought him another term in federal prison.<br>
Kelly learned no lessons from incarceration.  In May 1909 he pleaded guilty to another smuggling charge and once more spent a year at the McNeil Island prison.  It was said that in attempting to escape when taken into custody he jumped off a train and was badly injured.<br>
<br>
On his release he drifted away.  Old and broken, he got in touch with the Daughters of the Confederacy and was admitted to a Confederate soldiers' home in Louisiana, where he died.<br>
<br>
Larry Kelly outlived all of the region's most daring and successful smugglers.  The man so often confused with him, Jim or "Red" Kelly, dropped dead of heart failure at a salmon trap on October 1, 1908.  He, too, served a ten-n at McNeil Island after customs officers lay in wait for him at Kanaka Bay and watched him unload five Chinese.<br>

SMUGGLERS AND OTHER GENTLEMEN<br>
<br>
David Richardson, "Smugglers and other gentlemen," <B>Pig War Islands.</B> Eastsound: Orcas Publishing Company, 1971, p. 256-276.<br>
<br>
Thus was the stage set for the golden age of smuggling on Puget Sound, and once again the San Juan Islands -due to their strategic location practically astride the border - found themselves in the center of that stage, playing host to chief actors like Jim "Pig-Iron" Kelly and Larry "Smuggler" Kelly, Bill "Old Man" Jamieson, and Henry Ferguson, better known as "the Flying Dutchman."<br>
<br>
The two Kellys were often confused in newspaper stories, and still are in the legends they left behind.  They were not related, and differed markedly in the way they plied their craft.  Larry was known up and down the Sound as "king" of the smuggling fraternity, apparently because he was heard of the most - the reason being that he got caught so often! Nevertheless, his fame remains such that
whenever the roster of Puget Sound contrabandistas is called, it is his name which generally heads the list.<br>
<br>
Lawrence Kelly was born about 1839, of Irish parents, probably in that country or in England.  As a youth he served a hitch in the British army, later became a deep-water sailor.  After seeing a good deal of the world he chanced to put in at New Orleans just as the Civil War was erupting.<br>
<br>
Kelly left his ship and joined a Confederate outfit, the "Louisiana Tigers," with which he fought up to the moment of Lee's surrender on April 9, 1865.  He then left the South, reputedly vowing he would "never earn an honest living under the stars and stripes," and returned to the sea.<br>
<br>
Later the same year Kelly arrived on the inland waters of the Pacific Northwest aboard the vessel Young America.  Almost immediately he was attempting his first smuggling caper, sneaking a batch of Canadian silks across to the Washington mainland.<br>
<br>
He was promptly caught, and the offense cost him $500 - but without dissuading him from his new-found vocation.<br>
<br>
A decade or so later found Kelly living on the southwestern bulge of Guemes Island, across from Anacortes, with his wife, an Indian woman named Lizzie Kotz.  There he supported himself and his tawny bride with profits gleaned by hauling a miscellany of contraband items from place to place on the Sound.<br>
<br>
Those being the days of scant interference from the undermanned revenue service, Kelly used an ordinary fishing sloop in his work, not even bothering to change the bright red paint job which charac-
terized it - and made it quite visible from a great distance away.<br>
<br>
On those rare occasions when he was spotted by the customs men, he was generally able to outrun his pursuers, or elude them among the Sound's numberless bays and channels, all of which he had come to know like a familiar book.  If all else failed, the outlaw goods were dumped overboard at the last moment, for without them, there could be no conviction.<br>
<br>
Kelly always stuck to sail in his work and has been called the most skillful small-boat handler on Puget Sound.  A crony recalled how the smuggler king would grease his craft with pot black and tallow to cut its resistance in the water.<br>
<br>
Those were the days of the revenue cutter Oliver Wolcott, a
lumbering old tub with a top speed of four knots.  Given any wind at all, Kelly's sloop could sail faster than the Wolcott could steam, and could navigate in passages too narrow, or water too shallow, for the government vessel to follow.<br>
<br>
Eventually, determined revenue officers fitted out one of the Wolcott's small boats with sail, and laid for Kelly.  A witness to the encounter which followed left this account of what happened:<br>
<br>
"The revenue boat was pretty smart before the wind and there was a smart wind and a freshening sea up in the San Juans.  Kelly came bowling down the channel at a great clip.  The revenue boat shot out from the little bay where they were watching for [him].<br>
<br>
"He was pretty close up on the revenue hiding place when the little boat shot out but it never teased him.  He put his helm hard over and swung up into the wind.  He just turned tail like a scared jack rabbit and the way that little sloop of his went flying back toward the north was a sight to see.<br>
<br>
"Kelly had a boat that would sail into the eye of the wind or just as close to it as anything afloat will sail and he knew how to handle her.  She buried her nose in the seas at times till you couldn't see anything but white smother, but she made better weather of it than the revenue boat.  Gradually Kelly drew away and the revenue men sailed back into port, sore all over."<br>
<br>
Kelly's come-uppance came at last one cold, foggy December night in 1882.<br>
<br>
Deputy Customs Inspector Thomas Caine teamed one of the smuggler-king's tricks was to sneak his boat along the shoals of Swinomish Slough, near LaConner, in the early morning.  So Caine staked himself out in the slough and waited quietly.  But the wily Irishman must have suspected something, for as he approached the place where Caine was stationed he slipped overboard into shallow water and began pushing the light boat ahead of him, as soundlessly as possible.<br>
<br>
Caine heard some faint splashing sounds and suddenly the smuggler's craft loomed out of the fog almost in front of him.  The inspector pulled a large service revolver, pointed it and shouted, "I've got you, Kelly!"<br>
<br>
"All right," said the king of smugglers.  "Put up your iron.  I'm your prisoner."<br>
<br>
Kelly's cargo this trip was $400 worth of illegal Chinese wine.  
Worse still, he had a Chinaman aboard, contrary to the months old Exclusion Act.  Fortunately for him, the man was able to convince a judge that he was not a coolie, but a merchant doing business in Portland. Kelly got off with a $150 fine.<br>
<br>
To avoid being classed as laborers many Chinese attached themselves to small businesses, some of which counted their owning "partners" in the dozens was a pittance to Kelly, who was doing so well that a few years later he bought up a 360-acre spread on Sinclair Island, also known as Cottonwood, on the eastem edge of the San Juans.<br>
<br>
The property (prudently placed in wife Lizzie's name) comprised a third of the island, where Kelly - in spite of his profession, ff not actually because of it -was considered a citizen of great uprightness and was even elected to the school board.<br>
<br>
Kelly's place was on the northwest shore of Cottonwood, where he had a commanding view of the Strait of Georgia, and Canada beyond, which helped him keep tabs on the customs vessels.  He was now specializing in the importing of opium, and his usual practice was to haul the drug in relays.<br>
<br>
After purchasing it at one of fourteen licensed refineries in Victoria, he would head for Cottonwood and bury the stuff somewhere along the beach or on his farm.  When the time seemed right he dug up one or more of the caches and headed for Port Townsend, a favorite destination, or Seattle, or elsewhere, and disposed of the drug to an agent for the standard $12-a-pound fee.<br>
<br>
Years later, when he had fallen on hard times, residents of Cottonwood used to see him poking about there, hoping to find in some old hiding place a forgotten packet that could be converted into a few needed dollars.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the customs service was becoming decidedly more aggressive in their war on contrabanders.  Gradually, with more manpower and faster boats on the Sound, Kelly and his confreres found themselves being overhauled and searched more and more frequently.<br>
<br>
Of course, they responded by becoming foxier.  Larry Kelly took to tying his opium in a weighted sack and trailing it, submerged, on a line fastened to a ring-bolt under the hull of his boat.  Ultimately inspectors caught onto this stunt, and routinely "keel-hauled" suspected smuggling craft.  Or, if pursued too closely by the revenue cutter, Kelly would sometimes anchor his cargo to a float and return for it when the coast had cleared.<br>
<br>
The cynical mishandling of human contraband became rather
prevalent, with the smuggler-king getting his share of the blame, though there is some doubt whether Larry Kelly went in much for that end of the business.<br>
<br>
Once a band of Chinese were put off "temporarily" on a lonesome rock in San Juan Channel when the revenue boat was bearing down, but the man who collected their fares never came back for them.  They were discovered days later by Reverend T. J. Weekes, emaciated and barely subsiding on clams on a reef which has been called "China Rock" ever since.<br>
<br>
The broad-shouldered Englishman [found by customs agents after they had missed Kelly] was actually Jim "Old Man" Jamieson, another adherent of the Sound's close-knit smuggling fraternity. Jamieson had shipped on square-riggers before he joined the club, and rivaled Larry Kelly in his boat handling ability.  But Jamieson was shrewder, and certainly more audacious, reputedly disdaining to land his Chinese passengers at some hidden, exurban rendezvous: it is said he sailed right into Seattle and discharged his human cargo at Schwabacher's dock, like the other freighters.<br>
<br>
Jamieson always painted his boat green, to blend with the coastline if seen from a distance.  But customs men on the Grant spotted it one bright, chilly February day, just as the Englishman set his course from Victoria to San Juan Island.  He had crossed the boundary line before he discovered the Grant was steaming toward him for all it was worth.<br>
<br>
Jamieson had a near-record load of opium on board and didn't care to get caught with it.  Swinging about smartly he gave the Grant a good race back to Canadian waters, but seeing he wasn't quite going to make it, he began dumping the evidence overboard.  It took fifteen minutes of frantic deep-sixing to dispose of the whole shipment, worth something like $20,000.<br>
<br>
When  Grant came alongside almost as the last tael of opium hit the drink but the relieved and sweating Jamieson was able to get off one of the few great one-liners in the annals of contrabanding: "It's all right, Cap," he shouted up at the Grant's wheelhouse; "I don't need a tow."<br>
<br>
Wool was another dutiable commodity often brought into the country without benefit of a customhouse clearance.  Dean of this branch of the smuggling biz was a diminutive, gray-bearded Shaw Island man named Alfred Burke.<br>
<br>
Burke had a long, slender rowboat stained a dull black color; and during each year's shearing season he would quietly ride the changing tide across Haro Strait to the Gulf Islands - appearing, then, at one sheep ranch after another, offering to trade chickens, tobacco or cash for fleeces.  In his long black coat and slouch hat he became a familiar figure to Canadian islanders, one of whom recalled that he rowed standing up, without feathering his oars,
for fear the sun would reflect from the wet blades.<br>
<br>
Burke easily disposed of the wool to San Juan county ranchers who mixed it with their own output, shipping it to mainland markets at a fine profit: wool was selling for some twenty-two cents a pound more in the States than in Canada then.  The arrangement was thus lucrative to all concerned, except the U.S. Treasury, whose officials became suspicious when they compared the huge figures for wool output in the San Juans with the modest number of sheep.  They knew no flocks in the world could be half so productive!<br>
<br>
The government moved in 1905 to break up what they believed to bc a full-fledged ring of wool smugglers.  On May 13, Inspectors Dean (capturer of Larry Kelly off McNeil Island) and Roy Ballinger left Port Townsend in an open boat, disguised as seal hunters.  Their act was convincing.  Dean had made his living as a sealer before entering government service.  While Ballinger, who had lived in the San Juans (he married a pretty Roche Harbor school-ma'am) had a ranching background and knew wool.<br>
<br>
Under sail and with two pairs of oars, Ballinger and Dean crossed during the darkness to the Canadian islands and began systematic visits to all the sheep ranches they could find.<br>
<br>
"We had our pockets full of skewers, wooden pins used in securing meat in form when roasting," Ballinger recalled years later.  "And when the ranchers, who were shearing sheep, were not looking, we placed them in the fleece.  We would stand around while the men were at work, telling them we were on vacation, seeing the country and doing a little sealing with our boat."<br>
<br>
The inspectors spent a couple of weeks at this, traveling back and forth between the Gulf Islands and the San Juans, where they camped Indian-fashion on the beaches.  Ultimately their rounds brought them to a South Pender Island ranch where their visit chanced to coincide with that of the short, somber-coated fellow from Shaw Island, Alfred Burke.  Ballinger and Dean came upon him as he was loading wool he had bought into his lead colored dory, struck up a conversation, and had their suspicions aroused.<br>
<br>
Toward evening Burke put out into the Strait with his furtive-
appearing craft.  The two inspectors followed at a discreet dis-
tance and as the dory disappeared into the darkness they concluded its destination was Orcas Island.  Ballinger and Dean headed for Orcas too, poked around there and at length located half a ton of skewer-marked wool in a warehouse belonging to the storekeeper, W. E. Sutherland.<br>
<br>

Burke was arrested at his Blind Bay home, tried for smuggling and acquitted on grounds the inspectors hadn't actually seen him cross the border with the contraband.  But the government's efforts were not wasted: the wool was confiscated and sold at auction in Port Townsend so that from Uncle Sam's point of view this particular crime paid - and handsomely.<br>
<br>
Sutherland was not the only merchant in the Islands to benefit from the enterprise of smugglers.  A West Sound pioneer recalled that 0. H. Smaby's store in that community never sold sugar except in bulk - because the sacks all had Canadian labels on them.  Smaby's source for the sugar, and perhaps other commodities, was probably Victor McConnell, son of a pioneer family.<br>
<br>
McConnell's dad having died in a shipwreck off Vancouver Island, Victor lived with his blind, respected mother and five brothers and sisters on the island which bears his family's name, until discovery of his extra-mural activities led them to request that he find another domicile.<br>
<br>
McConnell is said never to have crossed the border empty: hauled everything from apples to shoes to the Canadian side, in exchange for the sugar and other staples "imported" on the return trip.<br>
Somewhat surprisingly, one of the more popular cargoes when Canada-bound was playing-cards - an item made cheaper IYY Yankee mass-production methods in the States than in the land of the maple leaf.<br>
<br>
The activities of men Eke Burke and McConnell, and even the two Kellys, were largely looked on with something between tolerance and admiration by San Juan Islands people, who certainly had nothing to fear personally from any of these entrepreneurs.  But it was another story with Henry Ferguson, the fast-hitting pirate-smuggler-thief whose wide-ranging exploits earned him the nickname, "The Flying Dutchman."<br>
<br>
Ferguson had once been a member of Butch Cassidy's notorious "Hole in the Wall" gang of Wyoming badmen.<br>
<br>
When vigilantes and the U.S. Cavalry finally made things too hot for them there, Ferguson changed his name to Wagner and lit out for the Pacific Northwest.  He arrived in the late 'nineties and promptly embarked on a career of highway and high sea robbery which terrorized island and seacoast dwellers from Vancouver Island to Olympia.<br>
<br>
Ferguson's trademark was the stolen boat.  He used a succession of them, reworking and repainting each one so speedily it would be unrecognizable overnight.  In such craft he sped from place to place on the Sound, smuggling opium and Chinamen, stealing from
fish traps and logging booms, looting stores and warehouses, sometimes commandeering whole cargoes from small Sound freighters.<br>
<br>
Ferguson's home was in his hat, but he had several hide-outs, including a cabin in the San,juans where he hid his money and received mysterious light signals from the Canadian side.  Another retreat was on little Skagit Island, just in the maw of narrow Deception Pass between Fidalgo and Whidbey Islands.<br>
<br>
It was here that sheriff's officers finally cornered him in October, 1901, and captured him after a prolonged shoot-out.  He was prosecuted for a warehouse burglary committed at Stanwood the year before.  So for the next several years his hat had stripes on it, and his home was the State penitentiary at Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
Skagit Island proved to be the stamping ground of Benjamin Ure, once a wealthy Anacortes landowner whose holdings were lost in a real estate panic.  Sheriff Luther Weedin discovered Ure had also been in the customs service at one time, but before that he was a notorious smuggler of fire-water into Camp Pickett during the joint occupation.<br>
<br>
Now he made a business of sheltering criminals Eke Ferguson, making his secluded island available as a way-point for stolen and smuggled goods, and a gathering place for the scum of Puget Sound generally.<br>
<br>
Weedin put Ure out of business but an indulgent parole board returned Ferguson to society after he served a portion of his fourteen-year sentence, and the "Dutchman" promptly picked up his old career with new vigor.<br>
<br>
But Ferguson made the mistake of robbing several post offices, including one at Langley, Washington, for which he was indicted in absentia by a Grand jury.  United States Attorney Elmer Todd got a special appropriation to finance a Sound-wide search for Ferguson, but the effort failed.  Contemptuously, the "Dutchman" again entered the same Langley post office in 1912 and stole not only the government's cash, but the safe that contained it.<br>
<br>
Another costly expedition over Puget Sound waters was authorized but Ferguson remained at large.<br>
<br>
Finally in March 1913, Ferguson and an accomplice were surprised by Canadian constables in the act of robbing a store on Vancouver Island.  One of the officers was killed in the wild shooting affray which followed, but when the dust settled the "Dutchman" was on the floor with two pairs of manacles about his wrists.<br>

A Canadian court tried Ferguson - alias Wagner - for murder and sentenced him to death.<br>
<br>
Ferguson, who had sworn he would never be hanged for his crimes, tried to make good his vow by beating his brains out against the walls of his cell; but alert guards restrained him and on August 28, 1913, after drinking a cup of coffee, he walked unaided to the jail-yard scaffold and paid the penalty for which he had so long been marked.<br>
<br>
"Old Man" Jamieson was another who died violently, stopping a slug from a Treasury agent's pistol in a midnight confrontation near Seattle's Alki Point.<br>
<br>
Jim Kelly, too, was in action almost to his last breath.  In September 1908 Friday Harbor's deputy collector, 0. H. Culver,<br>
spotted "Pig-Iron" crossing from Victoria in a small boat and alerted customs officials, who again missed catching him with the goods on board.<br>
<br>
But Kelly's continuing habit of flashing large sums of money about convinced them that the 60-year-old smuggler had not yet retired from his chosen trade and for the next few weeks they kept a particularly close watch on him.  Thus a customs man may even have been present at supper time on the first day of October when Kelly sat down to table on board a pile driver at a fish trap near Seattle.  After eating this hearty meal Kelly got up, stretched himself and fell over dead.<br>
<br>
His passing, attributed to heart failure, occasioned a telegram from Puget Sound officials to Washington, in which interlinear sighs of relief not un-mixed with a certain note of admiration and regret, sounded clearly through the jargon of formal text.<br>
<br>
Thus ended the prolonged battle between determined government inspectors and the last of the best of the Puget Sound smuggling fraternity.<br>
<br>
But it was only a battle.  The war would flare anew a generation later.  For the ill-starred Volstead Act would plunge the nation into an era of speakeasies, bathtub gin, rum-running and hijacking, in which all the exploits of Puget Sound's smugglers would be as nothing compared to the intrepidity of their spiritual successors.<br>

David Richardson, "The Noble Disaster," <B>Pig War Islands.</B> Eastsound: Orcas Publishing Company, 1971, p. 308-325.<br>
<br>
No one can say that prohibition  was rammed down the throats of the American public.  Landslide local-option votes had spread a patchwork of legal sobriety across the land long before Mr. Volstead put pen to paper on the subject.<br>
<br>
The Eighteenth Amendment was ratified in all states but two, many of the legislatures - Washington's included - voting unanimously in favor.  Such was the overwhenning popular support for what Herbert Clark Hoover caged in his enthusiasm "a great social and economic experiment, noble in motive and far reaching in purpose."<br>
<br>
But local option was one thing; border-to-border abstinence was another.  Many a man who once voted to drive the saloon out of his home bailiwick., secure in the secret knowledge that he himself could slip away and bend his elbow in the other fellow's town when the span was on him, found the universality of the new statute intolerable.<br>
<br>
In such a circumstance he indulged himself to bend the law, ever so slightly, thereby giving secure employment to those who could cheerfully shatter it to bits.<br>
<br>
A goodly share of the shattering took place in the waters of western Washington and British Columbia wherc the San Juans,<br>
as in the bad old days of Chinese and opium smuggling, found themselves center-stage again.  In the Pacific Northwest, "just off the boat" generally meant one's booze had been newly spirited across the salt chuck border in a fast night-time dash through the archipelago's twisty channels.<br>
<br>
Rum-running into Washington State was big business even before national prohibition.  It was relatively safe, then, for the Coast Guard was still trying to patrol Puget Sound and the Straits with the same old, tired boats in which the revenue service had chased the likes of "Pig-Iron" Kelly and Henry Wagner.<br>
<br>
Still there were occasional captures.  The Journal ran a Iocal-
boy-makes-good item once in 1917 when the Scout, whose commander then was the son of a prominent Lopez farmer, overhauled a launch in which 750 bottles of choice liquors were found concealed.  A year later the tables were turned as the Arcata seized $6ooo worth of Scotch and Canadian whiskeys from a boat whose master turned out to be a Friday Harbor merchant, Sam Bugge.<br>

Bugge had represented San Juan County in the State Legislature in an earlier decade, which indicates the stature of some of the men being lured by the profits offered in this fast-burgeoning industry.<br>
<br>
Passage of the Eighteenth Amendment created a vastly increased market, ensuring even greater profits for everyone in the business.  A bottle of the "real thing," costing a mere fifty cents or so in hundred-case lots in Victoria, fetched perhaps $2.25 on delivery to an intrepid American smuggler, the loading taking place at night in some lonesome, prearranged rendezvous.<br>
<br>
The "rummy" paid in cash, of course, then made his bee-line -
without benefit of running lights - for the U.S. side.  There he might dispose of his liquid cargo to a shifty-looking gentleman driving a fast late-model car, and collect maybe $7 the copy.<br>
<br>
Ultimately this same four-bit booze would be dispensed by your<br>
friendly neighborhood bootlegger or hotel "bottle man" for something closer to twelve bucks.<br>
<br>
Apparently no one in government foresaw the enormous enforcement job national prohibition would entail in the Pacific Northwest, which is remarkable considering the vastness of the bootlegging industry engendered by Washington State dehydration alone.  But those carly lessons went unlearned in high places, and it was several years before the pleas of the enforcers for more muscle could be responded to.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, seizures by the thinlyspread Coast Guard, for example, occurred largely through accident.  Once the venerable tugboat-like cutter Arcata, having anchored off Marrowstone Point in a fog, discovered herself lying a few yards away from a rummy which had heaved to for the same reason.  Arcata's skipper made that seizure (twenty-four cases and the rum vessel itself) with the cutter's longboat.<br>
<br>
On another occasion the harbor cutter Guard confiscated $6,ooo worth of liquor from a speedboat at Afinor Ladge, the deserted shoal east of Smith Island.  The Coast Guard version of the capture has the rummies "stealthly" carrying their contraband across the beach at the time, but the Friday Harbor Journal's contemporary report says the rum-runners had been shipwrecked for two days and were so glad to be rescued they couldn't have cared less about losing their booze. The journal also pointed out it was the Coast Guard's first capture in nine months.<br>
<br>
Eventually, of course, Coast Guard forces were beefed up not only by new 75-fOOt "six-bitters" but through conversion of somc of the confiscated ex-rummy vessels into government patrol boats.  'nese
craft were speedy and carxied business-like armaments, thus driving somc of the smaller fry from the game; while the big fcuows responded with greater speed and cunning, some going so far as to equip their low-lying craft with armor plate.<br>
<br>
One of the major operators, a Tacoma brewer whose manufacture of legal "near beer" constituted an ironically appropriate front, invested in a fleet of twin-engined craft that could make nearly forty knots, outrunning just about anything afloat.<br>
<br>
But the rummies depended on stealth as well as speed.  Often times this meant a cautious exchange of recognition signals before the midnight rendezvous with the Canadian supply boat, at some secluded covc in the Gulf Islands, where a hundred or more<br>
cases of hard liquor were loaded aboard. (Actually the almost universal container was the homely gunny-sack, either the stan-
dard-size bag holding an even dozen bottles or a smaller version in which six were sewn end-to-end, sausage-like, the original six-
pack.<br>
<br>
The gunny-sacks were easier to handle and in case the evidence needed to be ditched hurriedly the sacking would not disintegrate in water.<br>
<br>
Across the way, a confederate on the north shore of one of the San Juans would be scanning the murk for Coast Guard vessels.  Seeing none, hc would flash the "all clear" upon which the rummy poured the coal to twin Van Blerck or Liberty engines and in a matter of minutes the illegal merchandise would be beached near the look-outs feet.<br>
<br>
The empty rum boat would be on its way again in a moment while the partner loaded the contraband into a waiting automobile and departed at top speed for the southern shore, where another fast boat waited to relay it to the mainland.  Islanders learned to ignore those noctural autos speeding hell-bent through the gloom, and warned their children to keep away from the windows if they awoke to hear them roaring by in the night.<br>
<br>
Most of the operators maintained hiding places where their goods could be quickly cached in case of pursuit, and a good deal of ingenuity was displayed in selecting them.  One of the more successful caches was on D'Arcy Island on the Canadian side;<br>
<br>
D'Arcy being a leper colony site in those days, no one risked coming around to investigate!<br>
<br>
Another imaginative cache was at Obstruction Pass on Orcas Island where an enterprising fellow constructed a very special kind of outhouse.  Half of the two-holer was conventional, but the other
half concealed the entrance to a short tunnel where the "merchandise" was hidden.  Very effective, providing one didn't forget which half was which.<br>
<br>
When pursued too hotly, it was sometimes necessary to deepsix the evidence and take one's chances of recovering it later.  Such was the case one dark night off the southwestern Orcas shore when a party of rummies hastily tossed their burlap wrapped cargo into shallow water, moments before being overhauled by the persistent guarders of the coast.<br>
<br>
The pursuers did not observe the dumping operation; but a watchful Orcas Islander did, and when the boatmen returned to retrieve their bottled goods, every bag of it had disappeared.  <B>The </B>rum-runners hunted for days, to no avail; but they were looking in the wrong Place.  They should have been searching the local Deer Harbor speakeasy, where quarts of the finest were on sale with new labels warning customers to destroy the bottles after use, so the rummies couldn't trace them.<br>
<br>
In the Islands, the local speakeasy was usually to be found in the nearest village store.  For reasons that are apparent, hard liquor was easy enough to come by.  But there was trafficking in imported beer, the profits being so much greater with spirits, so most of what was sold was of local manufacture.<br>
<br>
But there were also .... all over the place, and one of them was immortalized in a song parody known to islanders throughout the county:<br>
"We'll build a sweet little still<br>
In old Argyle mill<br>
And let the rest of the world come buy."<br>
<br>
The Argyle mill had no still, the miller having abandoned his obsolescent profession to become a highly-respected officer of the local bank, but the rhyme was too fetching to spoil over such a trifling detail.<br>
<br>
It is of course no secret that some of the very authorities charged with detecting Volstead Act violations were themselves among the violators.  Others, though not actively engaged in the booze traffic, were sometimes willing to look the other way for a consideration.<br>
<br>
One Orcas man used to tell of bringing his small fishing boat alongside an apparently disabled craft he thought needed help.  Tle islander was wearing an old Navy jacket and was mistaken by the skipper - who proved to be a rummy - for a Coast Guardsman.<br>
<br>
"Well, help yourself and let me go," said the rum-runner matter-of-factly, whereupon the Orcas man assumed what he hoped
was an official look, threw a gunny-sack full of Canada's best over his shoulder and departed with all the haste he could manage.<br>
<br>
Figuring ways to con a few free sacks of hooch from the runners -who were in no condition to complain to the law over their losses - was one of the sports that made the 'twenties roar.  Loyal Larson, who spent the bulk of his four score and four years carrying the mail in the San Juans, used to tell of one such episode.<br>
<br>
The plotters learned that a certain liquor carrier was using a deserted stretch of beach on San Juan Island for his "drop" and did not bother actually caching the bottles unless a warning shot, fired by a sentinel on a distant vantage point, warned of approaching danger.<br>
<br>
Posing as customers, the hooch-thieves were able to overpower the sentinel.  They themselves fired the alarm signal and watched patiently as the rum-runner crew scurried to convey the goods into the cache.  Then the rummies hurriedly abandoned the<br>
scene, leaving the enterprising thieves'to collect a considerable haul of free booze.<br>
<br>
The polite term for such activities is hijacking, and anyone who was on the inside of the business in those halcyon days win assure you that the hijacker presented a far greater danger to the rum-trade practitioners than all the law enforcement agencies put together.  It was as much on account of the liquor pirates, if not more so, that the  crews resorted to ever faster boats, thicker armor plate, and more potent weapons for thenisclves as the prohibition years advanced.<br>
<br>
A typical hijack operation occurred one blustery Wednesday in November 1922.  A rum-runner calling himself Harry Talbot, from Los Angeles, cleared Vancouver in the Schooner Daisy with $50,000 worth of liquor supposedly bound for Estenada, Mcxico. Talbot's true destination was some quiet island meeting with an American boat - a rendezvous he did not keep for while  negotiating narrow Active Pass between Mayne and Galiano Islands, he was suddenly overhauled by a faster craft, the crew of which relieved him at gunpoint of his entire cargo.<br>
<br>
Talbot was forced roughly from the Daisy into the hijack boat, which turned and headed for American waters at high speed.  After a good deal of brutal treatment Talbot was given his choice of being thrown overboard, or put ashore on one <B>of </B>the U.S. islands.  It was not a difficult choice to make, and before long he was found scrambling up the rocks to the Turn Point light station on
Stuart Island.  Islanders conveyed him to San Juan, whence he made his way back to Vancouver, battered, boatless, and bereft of his booze, but glad to be wearing most of his original skin.<br>
<br>
Canadian waters, was witness to more than one drama of the sort.  It was on September <B>17, </B>1924, that Chris Waters, keeper of the Turn Point light, noticed a small craft drifting northward up Haro Strait on the morning tide.  Waters figured the boat's engine had broken down and kept an eye on it.  Several hours later the vessel was within a quarter of a mile of Stuart, and still drifting.  Waters decided to row over and lend a hand.<br>
<br>
No one answered the lightkeeper's hail as he came alongside.  Clambering over the rail he made a quick search of the craft and found it deserted.  The anchor chain was down, but the anchor seemingly not grounded.<br>
<br>
Waters returned to Stuart, left the lighthouse in charge of an assistant and went off to get Eric Erickson at Provost.  Erickson had a gas boat, in which the pair overtook the derelict and towed her in.  On closer inspection they found the anchor was not dragging, but gone, the chain having been severed.<br>
<br>
That's not all they found.  Brownish stains on the deck and hatch cover looked suspiciously like blood, while a pencil-size hole in the foc's'le door could only have been made by a bullet.  Going below they found more stains-bunks and bulkheads were splashed with them - and on an opened Adventure Magazine lay a man's cap half filled with the still sticky, reddish-brown goo.  It was enough to make the islanders' own blood drop a degree <B>or </B>two in temperature.<br>
<br>
Papers and furniture scattered over the deck added to the evidence a mortal fight had taken place, no doubt between hijackers and their rum-boat victims.<br>
<br>
Waters notified the Coast Guard, which sent a cutter to take charge of the vessel, the fish-packer Beryl-G, owned by William Gillis of Vancouver.  Gillis and his son, William Jr., were supposedly using the craft to haul cannery supplies.  Both men were missing nor was either to be seen ever again.<br>
<br>
Because of the Canadian registry, provincial police were invited into the case along with U.S. authorities.  The ill-starred<br>
craft ultimately was towed by the Arcata to Friday Harbor where it remained tied up at the customs dock below Spring Street for several weeks.  As the county fair was in progress, the much-publicized vessel became the grisly object of considerable interest, vying with the pickled pears and out-sized cabbages for
<br>
fair-goers' attention.<br>
<br>
First, of course, the boat had been combed for clues.  The most promising item found was a camera containing a partially exposed roll of fihn.  Police had the pictures developed and one of them showed in close-up detail a low, squarish boat, its boiling wake curving away from the photographer.  A bit of the Gillis boat's rigging showed too, proving that the pictured vessel had just left the Beryl-G's side.<br>
<br>
B. C. sleuths identified the pictured vessel as one of the 40-knot speedsters of the Tacoma "near beer" man, Pete Marinoff.  An inspector contacted Marinoff and found him cooperative: he was as anxious as they to see the hijackers put permanently out of business.<br>
<br>
The Tacoman disclosed that Gillis' job was to ferry liquor from the supply ship Comet, standing off Vancouver Island in international waters, to various Gulf Islands rendezvous points where Marinoff's crews took over.  The last pickup from Gillis had been made on the 15th, two days before the blood-stained Beryl-G was found adrift.<br>
<br>
Marinoff also ticked off the names of underworld figures he judged capable of hijacking and murder.  Among them was tall 39-year-old Owen B. "Cannonball" Baker, an ex-McNeil Island irunate.  Baker and an unknown companion had relieved Marinoff before of booze as well as cash money in a Seattle holdup.<br>
<br>
From a Canadian-born laundry worker and sometime rummy, the provincial detective wrung the names of several disreputables who had been pirating liquor in the Gulf Islands area.  One of them was "Cannonball" Baker.  Another was Baker's sidekick, also a McNeil Island alumnus, named Harry Sowash.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in Victoria, police were questioning an immigrant fisherman who had commissioned an Oak Bay boatworks to alter the appearance of his fishing boat - just two days after the Gillis hijacking.  The man also had been heard to mutter that he "needed a good lawyer." And a Victoria customs official recaged that a few days before the Gillis had disappeared, he had run into the fisherman - whom he knew personally - in the company of an American introduced to him as Owen Baker.<br>
<br>
Other evidence was amassed implicating the fisherman, who soon chose to unburden himself of a bizarre and complicated tale of deceit, piracy, and murder.<br>

Baker's rather clean-cut appearance inclined him toward the impersonation of law enforcement officers - a technique he had used more than once to pry free booze from hard-working rummies.  But most of his jobs had been small ones, netting mere peanuts.  Finally he had hit on a scheme to make some real money.<br>
<br>
Assuming the identity of a U.S. official, Baker arranged to meet a visiting B.C- police officer in a Seattle apartment.  Claiming he wanted the information in connection with Volstead Act enforcement, Baker asked the Canadian to supply him with whatever data the Provincial Police had regarding the location of liquor caches on the B.C. side of the border.  Poker-faced, the officer obliged with a list of probable locations.<br>
<br>
Baker then gathered some rum-row associates together, chartered a gas boat called the Dolphin, and headed for Vancouver Island.<br>
At Victoria they contacted the immigrant fisherman, whom they hired to accompany them in his vessel, the Denman-II.  They told him their mission was to get actual motion picture film footage of American rum boats in action, at the behest of a Hollywood company which was paying handsomely to use it in a movie.<br>
<br>
Intimating the operation had the blessing of the provincial police, Baker let the Denman's owner observe him enter the<br>
Victoria police station and emerge again clutching a list of places to be investigated.<br>
<br>
The two vessels began visiting these locations, the Dolphin's crew searching each one for hidden booze, but coming up empty handed every time: the savvy Canadian official had fed Baker nothing but misinformation.<br>
<br>
Sowash and Baker, frustrated by the turn of events, now abandoned subtleties for direct action.  In the course of their peregrinations they had several times observed the Beryl-G at anchor.  They decided to knock over the Gillis boat.<br>
<br>
The Denman was chosen for the job.  About <B>10  </B>p.m. on September 15th Baker, Sowash, and a companion named Charlie Morris instructed their fisherman dupe to take them to the east side of Sidney Island, opposite Stuart.  Arriving about midnight they moored near the place where Gillis had been seen earlier, working over his engine.<br>
<br>
Baker and Morris had blue suits on and Morris was wearing a gold-trimmed, official-looking cap.  Baker pulled guns and a pair of handcuffs from a satchel and the two, together with Sowash, got into a skiff and rowed quietly into the night.  The perplexed
fisherman was ordered to bring up the Denman on a flashlight signal.<br>
<br>
A quarter hour passed when sounds of shooting reached the Denman, and moments later a light flashed.  Before the Denman's agitated skipper could decide what to do next, the skiff - with Baker in it - came alongside.  Baker leveled a pistol and ordered the fisherman to "Go ahead!"<br>
<br>
As the fishboat approached the Beryl-G Morris could be seen walking young Gillis at gunpoint across the deck and into the forward cabin.  "We had to shoot the old man a little in the arm," Morris called across to the Denman.  Actually, William Gillis was below, his lifeless body oozing blood into his cap and overflowing onto the magazine he had been reading.<br>
<br>
Baker and Morris transferred the Beryl-G's liquor to the other<br>
vessel while the two craft, lashed side-by-side, headed cast toward little Halibut Island.  There the Gillis boat was anchored and Sowash ordered the younger victim topside.  As he stepped out on deck Sowash struck him a savage blow over the head from behind.  "The cold-blooded murderers!" exclaimed Morris, aloud, as young Gillis crumpled.<br>
<br>
Baker and Sowash shook hands over the boy's silent form and went below to get the older man's body.  The two victims were then handcuffed together and - as a precaution against their bodies floating to the surface -both were ripped open with a butcher knife.  The two killers attached the Beryl-G's anchor to them and dumped father and son overside.<br>
<br>
Brandishing the dripping butcher knife before the eyes of the terrified fisherman, Baker ordered him to takc the Denman to nearby islands where the liquor was cached, then on to Anacortes.  There the hijackers debarked - after a final threat to "Plug" the panic-white fisherman if he ever talked.<br>
<br>
The Denman's skipper headed for the San Juans where he spent a day thinking things over and trying to get a grip on himself.  Opting to keep quiet about the whole affair, he returned to Victoria and saw about getting his boat's appearance altered.<br>
<br>
When the fisherman's tale was told, police rounded up Charlie Morris easily enough, but Sowash and Baker had vanished.  Rewards were offered and a gigantic man-hunt spread across North America.<br>

Locally, authorities spent a month and a day fruitlessly dragging the salt chuck for the Gillis bodies, but swift tides and voracious sea creatures had removed every trace.<br>
<br>
Baker was tracked to the New York waterfront by Seattle detectives who captured him on December 27, 1924.  A month later New Orleans police recognized Sowash, who was netted by chance dozing a routine roundup of transients.<br>
<br>
Sowash, Baker and Morris were tried in Canada and convicted of capital murder.  Morris appealed and got his sentence commuted to life imprisonment, but the others paid society with<br>
their lives.  It is said that Baker's last words, directed to the hangman, were "Step on it, Buddy.  Let's get on with it."<br>
<br>
While police on both sides of the border were relentless in their persecution of outlaws like Sowash and Baker, attitudes toward "legitimate" liquor runners ranged downward from reluctant enforcement through tolerance to actual participation.  For years, the undisputed king of Puget Sound bootleggers was baby-faced Captain Roy Olmstead, boy wonder of the Scattlc Police Department, whose far-flung operation rivaled-in size and organization-that of any Capone or Dutch Schultz.<br>
<br>
But unlike those gangsters, whose hallmarks were the murdered mobster and blinded customer, Olmstead ran an honest shop.  You could always buy a bottle from an Olmstead man and be sure the contents were neither watered, nor would they dissolve the enamel from your teeth.<br>
<br>
Nor would Roy Olmstead permit his associates to resort to gunplay even to "pack a rod." His success at eluding both hijackers and the law depended on careful planning, secrecy, and top-notch operators.<br>
<br>
One of Olmstead's lieutenants, reputedly the most successful rum-runner on Puget Sound, was a short, heavy-set San Juan County man named Prosper Graignic.  Graignic's dad was a French sailor who jumped ship at Victoria in the 1870's, married a native girl and settled down on Waldron Island's North Bay.  The large family they reared there grew up, it would seem, with sea water instead of blood in their veins.  One of Prospers brothers is said to have sailed the family sloop to Victoria and back at the age of seven.<br>
<br>
Another, though deaf, earned his way as a fisherman; his knowledge of local tides and currents is described by island people as "uncanny." Even the girls in the family learned, early on, to be as much at home afloat as on dry land.<br>

Prosper's entry into the rum trade was not auspicious.  Acquiring a 45-foot gas "yacht," the M-846, he had her cabin enlarged and installed twin 300-horse Sterling marine engines.  Leaving Seattle's Lakc Union about noon of a junc day he headed north for Discovery Island, near Victoria; four or five truckloads of hooch were to be boated there from Vancouver and divvied up between Graignic and several othcr operators.<br>
<br>
Arriving at that destination during the night, Graignic and his crewman-companion retired to their bunks for some shut-eye.  But early the next morning Chief Coristable John James Otway Wilkie of the Provincial Police discovered the M-846 illegally moored in Canadian waters, arrested the pair, and turned them over to immigration authorities.<br>
<br>
Graignic was obliged to pay a $400 fine for entering Canada at other than a designated port.<br>
<br>
Upon paying the fine, Graignic's B.C. lawyer approached immigration officers and openly asked them how a U.S. vessel could visit Canada and secure a load of liquor "without getting into trouble." He had thus already violated rule number one, for the Canadians promptly reported the conversation to American authorities.<br>
<br>
Returning to Discovery Island, Graignic found his boat adrift and had to hire a launch to chase it.  When the M-846 was recovered, eight miles away near Hein Bank light, the Waldron Islander headed home empty and entered the United States legally, according to the book - at Port Townsend.  But officials at that port, who knew exactly what he had been up to, seized the vessel on grounds it was "being used in foreign trade."<br>
<br>
Graignic paid another $500 fine to get his boat out of hock.<br>
But Prosper Graignic survived the novice stage of his career and in the long run his knowledge of local waters and unerring skill at boat-handling enabled him to land load after load of burlap wrapped Canadian spirits on the American side, virtually at will, thus contributing heavily to the estimated two hundred cases a day being delivered to Olmstead in Seattle.<br>
<br>
Graignic's forte was the ability to navigate in weather neither<br>
the Coast Guard nor Sound pirates would dare face.  Time after time when vicious southeasters tumed the Straits to boiling foam and monster waves drove every other skipper on the Sound to anchor in the lee of the nearest island, Prosper would pile sack on sack of booze into the Baby Bottleman, the Elsie -named by Olmstead for his wife - or some other craft and head unchalIcnged for the U.S. side.  And he always got there. (Except for the day in 1924 when the high-performance engines of the Elsie caught fire, burning the
<br>
boat to the water, and Graignic barely escaped with his life.)<br>
<br>
For the rare occasion when Graignic was about to be overhauled he had a slick device for getting rid of the evidence in a hurry.  Sacks were tied together at intervals on a line passing over rollers to the stern of the boat.  Cutting one line would cause the rope to pay out and the whole load to be dumped.<br>
<br>
If his pursuers didn't look sharp, they would never see it happen.  And by picking shallow water to dump in, Graignic could always come back later and retrieve every sack.<br>
<br>
Of course the truth about Captain Olmstead's extracurricular activities was bound to come out-it was Seattle's worst-kept secret anyhow-but even his dismissal from the force simply enabled the pleasant-mannered ex-cop to devote himself more fully to his private endeavors.<br>
<br>
And his vast connections within all levels of officialdom weren't hurting him, either.  The stacks of money just grew and grew in the old clothes hamper he carelessly called "the bank."<br>
<br>
Some of this money he invested in Seattle's pioneer radio broad-
casting station, KTCL, partly for fun and partly as a hedge against the future.  There is an undying legend in the Puget Sound country that Olmstead used the station to transmit, in the guise of bedtime stories for children, intelligence information about the movements of Coast Guard vessels; but there is no proof that this was ever done.<br>
<br>
Actually, there was no need to, for Olmstead conversed quite openly with his employes by telephone, safe in the knowledge that wire-tap evidence had been outlawed in Washington State.<br>
<br>
Federal authorities tapped his phone anyway, but even this was used to Olmstead's advantage.  Calling an employe from home he would give detailed instructions for a booze pickup.  "I got you the first time, Roy," the fellow would say breezily.  Then Olmstead could go to a pay phone, call back and give a different set of instructions.<br>
<br>
Prohibition agents spent many a wet night at some phony rendezvous, while the actual hand-over of liquor took place far, far away.<br>
<br>
Desperate for a conviction, prohibition agencies built a case on conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act, rather than actual violation of it, and got Olmstead and ninety members of his organization indicted in November I924.  Graignic was to be among the defendants at what the Seattle papers were calling the biggest
liquor trial in U.S. history.<br>
<br>
"Whispering wires" evidence, though technically illegal, was by various devices introduced at the classic trial, which drew as observers awed law professors from the nearby University of Washington.  Ohnstead was convicted, sold his radio station to pay the lawyers, and did time on McNeil Island before receiving a pardon from President Franklin Roosevelt.<br>
<br>
The wiretap aspects of the case led to its review by the U.S. Supreme Court, and to a landmark decision holding such evidence is not barred by the Constitution's fourth ammendment.<br>
<br>
Prosper Graignic, like many another of those indicted with Olnistead, jumped bail and fled to Canada, where Graignic had a brother working in a Sooke, B.C. cannery.<br>
<br>
A few weeks after the historic trial Olmstead, who had put up the collateral for Graignic's forfeited bail bond, himself participated in a two-nation scheme to net his former associate.  Driving to Vancouver, B.C., Olmstead and Deputy U.S. Marshal A. B. McDonald boarded the steamer Princess Victoria, Seattle-bound via the British Columbia capital.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Canadian immigration officers obligingly arrested Graignic for improper entry ordered him deported, and placed him on board the Princess boat when it arrived in Victoria.<br>
<br>
Deputy Marshal McDonald remained in seclusion while Olmstead hunted up his ex-associatc and the pair occupied a stateroom together until 6 o'clock the next morning, when the steamer was in American waters off Port Townsend.  At this point McDonald burst into the cabin, placed Graignic under arrest, and had him up before a Seattle judge later the same day.<br>
<br>
Graignic promoted $7,500 for bail and went to plying his accustomed trade until the last weeks of 1927, when the law's arm finally got him into a courtroom to face a file of damning evidence.  The Waldron Islander drew three years and a day on that grim little island south of Tacoma.  He served half of the sentence, was paroled, and lived a thoroughly circumspect exist-
ence thereafter.<br>
<br>
Between the determined prosecution by Prohibition forces of organizations like Olmstead's, and vastly multiplied patrol activ-
ities by the Coast Guard, the torrent of booze flowing through Washington's inland sea had by the close of 1924 slowed to a persistent but puny trickle.  "Puget Sound is drying up" reported the Friday Harbor Journal, quoting "the booze men themselves.." While according to the Bellingham American, as many as twenty@
relentless Coast Guard crews now guarded Puget Sound waters against the transcursions of foreign spirits.<br>
<br>
Those rummies who persisted in the game were obliged to resort to elaborate new tactics, such as the false-compartmented boat.  But even so, sharp-eyed Coast Guard crews often found them out.  One such vessel, the Alice, was spotted off Upright Head, Lopez Island, in 1926.  J. L. Gunderson, in command of the CG picket boat 2354, thought it odd that the 50-foot Alice was floating so low in the water, with no cargo apparent on her deck.<br>
<br>
He whistled her down for an inspection, which turned up no evidence of liquor - or any other explanation for the sparsity of freeboard.<br>
<br>
Smug faces on Alice's crew turnd to dismay when the determined Coast Guard officer drove the suspect vessel up on the beach for a thorough look-see.  At length the hiding place was uncovered: 22-foot-long, narrow compartments had been built into each side of the hull below the waterline, just wide enough to receive the liquid cargos one sack at a time.  The sacks were attached by ropes to an iron ring at the opening, to facilitate their removal at journey's end, the whole apparatus being concealed during the trip by a board nailed over the opening.<br>
<br>
Gunderson's men seized 115 cases of ilicit potables and Alice herself, an ex-Navy motor-sailer, was confiscated and pressed into the anti-booze service.<br>
<br>
Such were the dying gasps of the rum trade through San Juan waters, as elsewhere.  But the prohibition experiment too was terminal: mounting public revulsion over the mood of gangsterism, official corruption and grass-roots scofflawry rampant in a turbulent and agonized society spoke death to the Great Test, the efficacy - if not the nobility - of which was by then almost universally in question.<br>
<br>
Then the Wall Street humpty-dumply toppled and as the minions of financial empire scrambled vainly to reassemble the debris, the bread-line crowd howled for the right, at least, to its liquid solace.<br>
<br>
In 1932 Franklin Roosevelt, besides declaring against the face of fear, pledged an axe to the Act of Mr. Volstead; but Congress beat him to it by pulling the budgetary teeth of the Coast Guard and other enforcement agencies.  Prohibition was dead, the cadaver to be buxicd the following year upon ratification of the Constitution's twenty first amending.<br>
<br>
In the San Juans as across the nation, the demise of the Noble Experiment was feted with many a high-held toast, and usually to
the self-delusory tune of Tin Pan Alley's latest: "Happy Days Are Here Again!"<br>

<br>
To be sure the Island of San Juan has always been reckoned as a choice place for sheep raising and smuggling.<br>
<br>
As a matter of fact, in 1906 a farmer named M.A. Ward boasted that he gleaned 21 1/2 pounds of wool from one sheep.  Noted in the Islander of June 9th that year, two farmers with spreads near Kanaka Bay claimed they averaged over 150 pounds of wool per sheep.<br>
<br>
The Customs Inspector expressed grave doubts about that crop-since wool smuggling was rampant on the west coast of the Island-and most sheep do well to grow seven to 10 pounds of wool annually.  But, with no evidence to take to the sheriff, he had to accept the word of the apparently reputable landowners.<br>
<br>
In her diary Winnie Lightheart wrote of an inspector telling her father that he had discovered a large cache of wool near the family barn.  Mr. Lightheart remembered that a fellow Islander, whom he "didn't particularly like," had a fast boat and sometimes off-loaded wool on the shore near the Lightheart property.  She wrote:<br>
<br>
the man . . . had to make a quick job of getting the wool off his boat and our place was the closest.  He was likely being pursued by the Revenue boats.  In those days money was hard to come by on the farms and this particular farmer owned a fast sailing sloop so he bought wool on the Canadian side and brought it across to be sold later with his own wool.  He had a lot of sheep.  My father felt apparently he should protect him as he was a fellow farmer trying hard to earn a living.<br>
<br>
Winnie "pressed the feelings of a number of upstanding citizens.  Smuggling was regarded only as a "somewhat" questionable cottage industry.<br>

Americans living close to the 49th parallel found it hard to believe that unlicensed commerce betw@n them and their Canadian neighbors represented any threat to the country's economic well-being.  Besides, duty-free rum was one of the staples of an Island homeowner, and the British were good customers of the San Juan farmers.<br>
<br>
During the Civil War years of 1861-65, liquor, blankets and wool were the principal "imported" cargo of many fast boats that darted in and out of the coves of the west side of the Island.<br>
<br>
When Chinese workers were imported to help with building railroads on the West Coast, opium became a lucrative commodity.  It could still be brought into the country legally, but the duties were extremely high in order to limit its use.<br>
<br>
In the 1880's laws were passed to restrict the immigration of Chinese because they were a cheap source of labor that threatened white working men.  The law was countered by the creation of a marine "Underground Railway.  " The going price for putting an illegal Chinese on shore in the U.S. was about $100-a princely sum.<br>
<br>
Orientals were carried on board sewed up in potato sacks, hidden in the dangerous shaft-alleys of steamers or in the anchor chain lockers.  Often the "Celestials" were put ashore on uninhabited islands, such as Sucia, or on barren rocks, awaiting a chance to sail by small boat to the mainland.  There are tales about unscrupulous smugglers throwing illegal Chinese overboard when Revenue boats appeared.<br>
<br>
San Juan Island's first minister, the Rev.  T. J. Weekes rescued some Chinese who had been abandoned on a rock in San Juan Channel in the 1880s.  They had been dumped there by smugglers when a "revenue cutter" bore down on their boat.<br>
<br>
The unfortunate Chinese were found by the parson some days later, "emaciated and barely subsiding on clams on a reef which has been called 'China Rock' ever since," according to historian Bryce Wood.<br>
<br>
it would be impossible to estimate the number of Chinese who died of exposure or drowned in these forays.<br>
<br>
The saga of the wily and often-dangerous outlaws who plied the inland waters of Washington and British Columbia, can be drawn around several colorful characters.  There were two men named Kelly: jim "Pig Iron" Kelly and Larry -Smuggler" Kelly who marauded at about the same time, although there is no record they ever met.  Two others were William "Old Man" Jamieson and Henry "Flying Dutchmm" Ferguson.
Lawrence Kelly was an ex-Confederate Army soldier who went to sea.  Arrested for the first time in Puget Sound for trying to smuggle Canadian silk, he was fined $500.<br>
<br>
In the 1880's, he and his Indian wife set up a center of operations on Guemes Island, near Anacortes.  He had a fast red fishing boat and he could be nonchalant about the law because the only Revenue boat in the area was the stodgy old tub, oliver Wokott with a top speed of 5 knots.  Even though he was often spotted, he usually outran his pursuers. if he avoided failed, - he dumped his cargo overboard and thus prosecution fined $150.<br>
<br>
He was caught in  1882 with a load of contraband wine, although his staple commodity was opium.  Lawrence Kelly was reportedly the smugglers who stranded the Chinese on a windswept rock in San Juan Channel.  Unable to swim ashore, they nearly starved to death until the Rev.  T. J. Weekes plucked them from the rock nearly a week later.<br>
<br>
Kelly was sent to jail or fined heavily many times, but he always returned doggedly to his lifess work when he was free.  He finally retired in 191 I when he was 70 and went back to his native Louisiana.<br>
<br>
The other Kelly, "Pig Iron," began his  career  selling  Liquor illegally to natives in Alaska.  He arrived in the Northwest in the late 1880s and earned his nickname by stealing most unusual items: iron ingots.<br>
<br>
He had friends on both Vancouver Island and San Juan Island, since whenever he came to the area he dried a full cargo of illegal liquor to share with his buddies.  Officials hunting for him were frustrated by his frierios' warning and hiding him from the law.<br>
<br>
His luck finally ran out in 1902 when he was intercepted carrying a half dozen Chinese in a long-boat.  He went to prison for a year.<br>
<br>
It was common knowledge in the San Juans that "Pig Iron" continued his activities, but thqe is no record of his arrest after the 1902 incident.<br>
<br>
Alfred Burke was one of the smugglers who made it possible for San Juan Island sheep-men to sell 150 pounds of wool for each animal
in their flocks.  It was nearly 10 years before he was caught after almost a decade of smuggling by a couple of clever inspectors.  Fred Dean and Roy Ballinger made it a personal quest to trap the elusive Mr. Burke.<br>
<br>
They knew he bought his wool from a number of farmers in the B.C. Gulf Islands, so they went "on vacation" to those islands and traced him.  They caught up with him on South Pender Island.  Claiming to be just "tourists" they watched a farmer shear sheep as Burke stood by.  They had with them a number of small wooden pegs which they had made.  When they had a chance, the inspectors pushed the pegs into the bales of wool.<br>
<br>
The Customs men traced Burke to a warehouse on Orcas Island owned by W. E. Sutherland.  When they inspected nearly half a ton of wool, they found their pegs and arrested Burke.<br>
<br>
Burke was tried for smuggling but got off on the technicality that the Inspectors did not see him actually cross the boundary line.<br>
<br>
The ingenuity of smugglers was unbounded.  A story in the Seattle Post Intelligencer in 1903 told about a group of Indians who joined the trade.  They picked up Chinese in the British Columbia waters and put them in canoes.<br>
<br>
On the way to the U.S. the  Chinese were bundled into women's clothing and disguised as squaws.  When the canoes landed in the States, the Chinese went ashore and mingled with squaws until they had a chance to change back to their own clothing.  The price for this masquerade was from $50 to $150 each.<br>
<br>
Agents from the Revenue service said although they thought the operation was managed by white men, some old hands who knew Indians well believed they did not accept help from whites-they were perfectly capable of devising the scheme by themselves.<br>
<br>
Although Chinese illegal immigrants usually came thmugh British Columbia where the laws were more tolerant, returning them was not easy.  The British required detailed expense vouchers for each returned Chinese.  The paperwork was lengthy, the repayment from the British uncertain.  Adding to the difficulty, the Canadians refused to accept the Chinese unless the U.S. paid a $50 per capita tax for them.<br>
<br>
It is little wonder that the U.S. government was less than enthusiastic about the efforts of the Revenue Service to halt the illegal importations.<br>

<br>
The way things were going, we all knew that Prohibition was coming to an end.  We didn't know exactly when it would be over at first, but we knew that it couldn't last much longer.<br>
<br>
I continued to run out the west coast to pick up my liquor from the Chief Skugaid.  With the larger boat I was now hauling for up to five different customers each trip.  On the way down into Puget Sound I might make one stop on the south side of Edmonds, one just north of Seattle, and a third one about fifteen miles the other side of Seattle.  Then on the way back out I might make two deliveries on the other side of the Sound.<br>
<br>
If I was lucky and the weather was good and all of the pickups were right there to get their loads as soon as I arrived, I would be back home in Telegraph Bay by four or five o'clock in the morning.  That, of course, was if everything went just right, which it didn't often do.<br>
<br>
The fourth and last time that I had to stay over on the American side all day was with the Revuocnav.  I was bringing a load in from the outside when it started blowing from the southeast.  Joe Fleming was crewing for me on that trip.  In no time flat we were facing right into a terrific wind.  The wind hit gale force when we were still out around Port Renfrew.<br>
<br>
It didn't let up at all.  We bucked into that blow all the way down the Strait.  For most of the trip you could hardly see the boat, there was so much water on the deck.  The waves were steep and short and every one of them was coming aboard.  We had to slow down to deal with it.<br>
<br>
In those conditions I knew that we didn't have time to go all the way down to Seattle and be clear before daylight, so I started thinking about some place to hide during the daylight hours of the next day.<br>
<br>
Normally I would have headed for a small channel between two islands on the east side of the Discovery Group.  It offered a perfect spot to tie up that was wen protected from the wind and seas.  There was a sheer rock watt on one of those islands that I
could get right next to on any level of the tide.  I could tie right up to the rocks, put a old tire between the boat and the cliff face and ride the tide up and down in comfort with no worries at an.<br>
<br>
The problem was that at this time the Imperator had been particularly active, patrolling the waters at the southern tip of Vancouver Island regularly.  I decided that it would be safer to spend the day on the American side of the border.<br>
<br>
We fought our way past Discovery and bucked across Haro Strait to San Juan Island.  On the southeast tip of the island, just around the corner from Cattle Point, there was a tiny cove that offered good protection from the weather.  The bay was only about a hundred feet wide and two hundred deep.  There was a piling in the middle of the bay and we tied up to that and sat there for the rest of the night and all the next day.<br>
<br>
As it happened the farm above the cove had been homesteaded by Joe Fleming's father and his half-brother was still working the land.  When it got light, Joe went up to the farm to visit his relatives and make new arrangements for the delivery of the load the following night.  I stayed on the boat.<br>
<br>
I felt pretty safe being out in the San Juans the way we were - the chances of a Coast Guard patrol being out there were slim - but I didn't like to leave the boat when it had a load on.  The day passed uneventfully.  The storm blew itself -out and we had no problem making the delivery the next night.<br>
<br>
I kept on hauling liquor right up to the end of Prohibition.  I made my last run on the night of April 2, 1933 - I delivered two hundred and fifty cases down to Seattle.  Prohibition ended on April 4, 1933.<br>
<br>
It's so long ago now that it is difficult to recall the way I felt<br>
when the whole thing came to an end.  I'm sure I looked onthe repeal of the Volstead Act with a good deal of sadness.  After all, it put me out of work.  Prohibition had provided me with a very good income, an interesting lifestyle and a good deal of adventure and excitement.  I can't say I was happy to see it end.<br>
<br>
But it didn't end overnight, and we all knew that it had to eiw sometime.  When I look back on it, it is much easier to remember the good points than the bad, the thrills and satisfactio@s than the disappointments.  All in all the era of Prohibition in the United States was very good to me.<br>
<br>
As I've said all along, I couldn't help but think of myself as a pretty lucky guy.  I had twelve years of doing something that I
really enjoyed.  And I was always well paid for it.  Sure, it was illegal as far as the Americans were concerned, but that never bothered me too much.  I couldn't see where I was doing anything terribly wrong.<br>
<br>
When it came right down to it, I never actually bought or sold any liquor; all I did was haul it.  I think that history has shown that the Prohibition laws were made to be broken.  But I'm not making excuses.  At the time I knew exactly what I was doing.  I knew I was breaking the law.  I knew the risks I was taking.  And I knew the penalties I would face if I got caught.  I guess that was why the pay was so good.<br>
<br>
During the time that I was rumrunning I had four or five different people come to me - all from the American side and ask me to run dope for them.  They made offers as high as $25,000 dollars to take a suitcase full of dope and land it on the other side.  I turned them all down flat.  I wanted nothing to do with that.  I didn't see it as the same business at all.<br>
<br>
But I think as much as anything else - the money and the excitement and all - I enjoyed the challenge of the whole game that was involved in the rumrunning.  The challenge of not getting caught.<br>
<br>
In looking back on it, I'd have to say that that challenge of staying out of reach of the authorities meant as much to me as anything else.  I certainly wasn't in the business just for the money.  I could have made a lot more money than I did, if that was my prime motivation.  I could have paid my crews a lot less than I did, that's for sure.  I never did change my practice of equal shares all around.<br>
<br>
It was always one-third for my crewman, one-third for me and one-third for the boat.  If I took two crew with me, then the split was in quarters.  And many times I took a second man along even though I did not really need him.  And I always did more of the work than any of my crew.  No, I sure wasn't in the rum trade just for the money.<br>
<br>
I thoroughly enjoyed my life during the Prohibition years.  I loved working on and around the water.  I took a lot of pride in my work, even if it was against the law.  During my years of rumrunning I made over four hundred runs; I delivered to ten different buyers, and made landings in thirty-six different locations along the coastline of Washington State.<br>
<br>
I never missed a spot where I was told to make a delivery; yet I never had any instruction in navigation.  Usually I would be shown a new dropoff site simply by someone pointing it out on a map.  
They might say, "Right about here in this bay." And I would go in there in the dark, flash a light toward the shore and nearly always get an answering flash right away.  Looking back on it now, it seems hard to believe that I never had more trouble than I did, making all of those deliveries at night, often in bad weather.  Most of the places I delivered to I have never even seen in the daylight, even to this day!<br>
<br>
I like to think I was lucky.  I had to be to stay out of trouble the way I did.  There weren't too many who did.  But the thing was I also felt that I made my own luck.  I was always careful.  I never took any unnecessary risks.  And I always made sure that I had the best equipment available.  I spent an awful lot of money making sure that I always had a boat that could outrun the opposition easily.<br>
<br>
I was always confident that I could do what I set out to do.  I never really felt that I was taking anY unnecessary risks at all - It didn't always seem that way when the bullets were flying, of course, but you couldn't prepare for everything!<br>
<br>
And looking back on it now, I realize that what I was doing was not at all bad for the Canadian economy at the time.  If you consider an average of about one hundred and fifty cases per trip, I freighted at least sixty thousand cases of liquor across to the United States.  That would have amounted to over four minion dollars of revenue that I brought into Canada.  And that was no small sum in the Thirties!<br>
<br>
The worst of it all was that, when Prohibition ended, I found myself with a very specialized boat, one that was far too expensive to operate for ordinary travel.  There weren't a lot of people around interested in buying the gas to fill those two six hundred gallon tanks and feed those eight hundred sixty horsepower engines! Nobody could afford it! It didn't take long for me to decide that I couldn't afford to keep the Revuocnav.<br>
<br>
There was just no way to use that boat to make it pay for itself.<br>
In fact, there was really no market for the boat as it was.  I finally decided to sell the engines separately.  And even at that I had to practically give them away.  I sold one to a mining company up north somewhere for $900.<br>
<br>
They wanted it to operate an electric generator for their camp.  That Packard would be able to light a lot of bulbs for them!<br>
I sold the Revuocnav to a group of millionaires that had a lodge up in Princess Louisa Inlet at the head of Jervis Inlet.  I think I got about $1500 for the boat.<br>
<br>
When I finished the rumrunning, I had maybe $10,000 dollars in the
bank.  That was a fair amount in 1933, but it didn't make me rich.  I could have made a lot more if I had been a better businessman, but that wasn't my way.  I put a lot of money back into boats and engines.  I spent something like $75,000 on my various boats.  In those days that was a lot of money.  But maybe that was what kept me out of jail!<br>
<br>
And I did build what was considered a fairly nice house at the time.  We lived well and travelled in good circumstances for quite a number of years.  I really enjoyed many of the people that I met in the rum trade.  Captain Charlie Hudson and Carl Melby were fine people and there were plenty of others as well.<br>
<br>
After Prohibition, of course, I had to find another line of work entirely.  I went logging for awhile, first north of Victoria near Ladysmith, and then out on the west coast of Vancouver Island up in Nitinat Lake.  I never got too far away from the water.<br>
<br>
Eventually I ended up making my living as a commercial fisherman out of Bamfield on the west coast of the island.  I bought my first boat, the Eljo from Joe Fleming.  Later I went over to Vancouver and bought a thirty-four foot fishboat.  I used that boat, the Margaret N, right up until the time I retired in 1969.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed the twenty-five years of fishing out of Bamfield up in Barkley Sound.  It wasn't as exciting as the rumrunning, but I was still my own boss, and it was good, healthy work.  And the funny thing was I never had a problem with seasickness when I was fishing.<br>
<br>
My fishboat was round-bottomed and, even though I went through plenty of terrible storms out on the open Pacific, I was never bothered by seasickness.  But everytime that I had gone out in the open in a V-bottomed boat I had been sick.  I was almost seventy-five years old when I finally retired.  I felt I could have fished for another eight or ten years, but my second wife was not in very good health at the time, and I thought it would be better for her to be in Victoria, closer to a good doctor and the hospital.<br>
<br>
Looking back on my life, I realize that I was indeed a very lucky person to have lived during such an unrestricted period in our history.  Although my childhood was hard, I was blessed with a strong body and a good mind which made it possible for me to overcome most of the difficult situations that I encountered.  For the most part I enjoyed my work, no matter what it was.<br>
<br>
My life wasn't without its hardships.  I was pretty hard hit when my little Johnny died very suddenly when I was working up in the Nitinat shortly after Prohibition ended.  And my first marriage was not very successful, and it ended not too long after our son died.
But I was lucky enough to meet a terrific woman later in my life, and we had twenty-seven wonderful years of marriage.  My second wife died of a blood disease at the age of seventy-seven.<br>
<br>
And now, having been retired for over seventeen years, I think it's safe to say that the twelve years of rumrunning were the most exciting years of my life.  I was young and eager, and I really enjoyed the thrills and adventure of that period.  And I've often thought back to the time I was in Seattle buying the engine for my first boat, when the fortune teller predicnd that I would be very successful in the "adventure" I was going into.  I guess I'd have to say he made a believer out of me!<br>

SMUGGLING AND BOOTLEGGING.<br>
<br>
Norman Clark, "A booze baron's flamboyant reign," <B>Seattle Magazine.</B> I (September, 1964) p. 14-18<br>
<br>
At two o'clock on the morning of March 22, 1920, a gang of Seattle rumrunners was unloading a tugboat on the beach of Brown's Bay, just north of Edmonds.  Suddenly lights, shouts and gunfire interrupted their work.  Prohibition agents, who had waited for days in the woods, were crouching behind a roadblock and firing wildly at the boat and the bootleggers.<br>
<br>
The gang's leader leaped into a car and went roaring through the brush around the barrier, but the agents were able to identify him before he escaped.  Behind him on the beach he left the largest shipment of liquor ever seized in the Northwest.<br>
<br>
The gang's leader turned out to be, of all things, a Seattle police lieutenant.  His name was Roy Olmstead-and his subsequent arrest failed to deter him from pursuing a notorious career during Prohibition times which remarkably contrasts with the peaceable, redemptive life that he leads today<br>
<br>
During the twenties, newspapers hailed Olmstead as though he were a latter-day Robin Hood.  They called him "the booze baron," "king of the rumrunners" and even "the good bootlegger [who] served a
social purpose." These sobriquets suggest why Olmstead was one of the popular heroes of the day; he grossed over $200,000 a month for several years as chief of an intricate rui-nrunning empire, and he scrupulously safeguarded the integrity of his products by refusing to adulterate the liquor that he brought from Canada.<br>
<br>
The wealth and respectability that Olmstead earned by dodging Federal law reflect not only the loose political texture of that period but also the moral cynicism that prevailed during the whole dry decade.<br>
<br>
Eventually, Olmstead's exploits were to take on even broader significance.<br>
<br>
After his downfall as a rumrunner, the case of Olmstead v. the United States moved through three levels of the Federal judiciary and spotlighted a distinctly modern problem-wire tapping by law enforcement agents.<br>
<br>
However, only the most farsighted prophet would have predicted that Olmstead's career would take these curious-and sensational-turns.  At the age of 20, he had been outspokenly moralistic.  Disgusted by the labor unrest that beset the Seattle shipyards where he had been working, Olmstead upped and joined the Police Department.<br>
<br>
This was in 1906, and his superiors promptly pegged him as keen, responsive and highly competent.  From then until 1920, Olmstead rose quickly through the ranks, and, as the city trebled in population, he had a unique vantage point for watching it grow.<br>
<br>
Olmsted was a sergeant by 1910 and he gained his lieutenancy in 1916 which was the year when, after a statewide vote. Washington began its own ill-fated experiment with prohibition.<br>
<br>
Bootlegging and rumrunning be both popular and profitable and Olmstead noted the increasingly vicious competition between two rival gangs. One was headed by Jack Marquett, a former policeman who was a chum of Olmstead's, and the other by two brothers, Logan and Fred Billingsley, whose younger brother, Sherman, later opened a New York speakeasy that became today's Stork Club.<br>
<br>
Rivalry between the two gangs led to a shooting war which left its dead and wounded on Seattle's streets.  The war, in turn, exposed the weaknesses of both groups and helped police break them up.In all this, theorganization structures, the international connections, the futile competition, they were valuable insights for Roy Olmstead.<br>

The eclipse of Marquett and the Billingsleys left the Northwest's rumrunning trade in total disarray. Then in January, 1920, the National Prohibition Act, usually called the Volstead Act made the Treasury Department responsible for enforcing the constitutional provisions against the manufacture, sale, or transporation of alcoholic beverages.<br>
<br>
The appointment of Federal   prohibition agents sharply increased the risks of entrepreneurship, but the rewards for success went up too.  This was especially so for a leade@ho had administrative talent and who knew the business in its full scope-from the wet<br>
gunny sacks in the bottoms of speedboats through the garages in back alleys to the offices of law enforcers.<br>
<br>
Olmstead was 34 years old in 1920 the youngest lieutenant in the Seattle Police Department.  He was considered such a paragon of efficiency and virtue that when, in court, he recommended probation for certain offenders, judges often followed his advice.<br>
I n due course, he came to realize that his influence with judges was worth money, and Olmstead began striking bargains that brought him tidy profits.<br>
<br>
Then, in keeping with his character and the times, he sought high-risk investment that would turn these profits into a burgeoning bonanza.  Rumrunning was an irrestible choice.<br>
It was that choice which had led him to the beach near Edmonds where prohibition agents intercepted an Olmstead haul and spotted him making his getaway.  He was arrested at home the same afternoon.  From then on, the "baby lieutenant" with the "brilliant career," as Seattle's newspapers called him, was a sought-after celebrity.<br>
<br>
Olmstead pleaded guilty to violating the Volstead Act and was fined $500.  Immediately dismissed from the police force, he was now able to devote all his time and energy to the liquor business.<br>
Olmstead had gained enough experience in rumrunning to form an accurate estimate of its potential.  He quickly found I I investors who would stake $ 1,000 each.  He retained an attorney and hired a staff of boatsmen, navigators, loaders, dispatchers, bookkeepers and salesmen (including some former Canadian policemen), then he began a shrewd and vigorous economic war against his competitors in the Pacific Northwest.<br>
<br>
To evade the export duty of $20 per case that Canada was charging for all liquor signed for the U.S., Olmstead had his ships cleared for Mexico.  After each had been loaded in Vancouver, B.C., with from 2,000 to 4,000 cases they rendezvoused at D'Arcy Island, a lonely spot of forest in Haro Strait northeast of Victoria that was well out of the main steamer lane.<br>
<br>
There, the cargo was secretly unloaded to await transportation by
small, swift boats to U. S. ports on Puget Sound.  Because other rumrunners paid the Canadian duty without protest, this ruse helped Olmstead undersell them by a wide margin.<br>
<br>
His tactics caused confusion and chaos among his competitors.  Many quit the business, some turned in bitterness to piracy, and others joined Olmstead.  Thus his empire mushroomed into what the New York Times called "one of the most gigantic rumrunning conspiracies in the country."<br>
<br>
By 1924 his organization was functioning so smoothly that Olmstead went almost entirely into wholesaling.  This brought him still greater profits, and he took his place in Seattle's grand society.  He bought a spacious colonial residence in the Mount Baker district.  He became president and owner of the American Radio Telephone Company, the very first local broadcasting station that later became KFOX and is now KOMO.<br>
<br>
His select private customers for illicit liquor included William E. Boeing and the exclusive Arctic Club.  Among leading Seattleites, it became a mark of distinction to remark casually, "As Roy Olmstead was telling me today. . . "<br>
<br>
In large measure, Olmstead's prestige stemmed from his audacity, which touched everything he did with cheerful excitement.  He sometimes brought his boats to the docks in downtown Seattle, where the cargo was unloaded in broad daylight into trucks marked "Meat" and "Fresh Fish"-and Olmstead would shake with laughter as, once again, he eluded the law.<br>
<br>
Even more than this, his unique code of ethics endeared him to thirsty citizens.  People could trust his merchandise.  He never allowed his men to bear arms, and he sternly lectured them that no amount of money was worth a human life.  For most Seattleites, it was simply impossible to regard Olmstead as an authentic criminal.<br>
<br>
The city police were a hazard to other rumrunners, but not to Olmstead, who could find a friend by telephoning any police station at any hour.  According to wire-tap evidence that was later in-
troduced in court, this was precisely how Olmstead operated.<br>
"Roy phoned the police station," testified one Federal agent.  "M. came to the phone and said, 'Hello, Roy, what's on your mind?'Roy said, 'One of your fellows picked up one of my boys.' M. replied, 'Who is it?' Roy replied that it was B. 'I don't give a damn what they do [said Olmstead] but I want to know before he is booked.' M. replied, 'I'll take care of it for you, Roy.' "<br>
<br>
To meet the hazards presented by Federal agents, Olmstead depended on his own wit and daring, plus what he regarded as the mediocre
personnel in the office of the Prohibition Administration.  One wire tapper, himself a member of that staff, was to repeat Olmstead's judgment: "Those sons of bitches are too slow to catch cold."<br>
<br>
They had indeed been slow in the beginning, but by 1924 political pressure forced them to greater vigilance.  Commanding the agents was William Whitney, who, as legal advisor in Seattle for Lhe Prohibition Administration, had active charge here, and he began chartering high-speed boats to pursue rumrunners.  The nighttime sport became a grim and unrelenting contest which, for Olmstead, vastly increased his overhead.<br>
<br>
At about this time, he was approached   by   Richard   Fryant,   a  free lance wire tapper who had six years experience in industrial espionage as a tapper for the New York Telephone Company.  According to Olmstead, Fryant showed him a transcript of conversations which had been conducted on Olmstead's office telephone over a period of several weeks.<br>
<br>
The transcript was for sale, Olmstead later alleged, for $10,000.  Olmstead claimed to have replied that he knew something about the rules of evidence, that such a transcript could never be used in court against him, that wire tapping was against state law and that Fryant could go to hell.<br>
<br>
Olmstead had the telephone company remove the tap-it was found in the ladies' room of the Henry Building, down the hall from his office-but he knew there would be others.  His caution, though, was only minimal.  Still trusting his estimate of the rules of evidence, he suppressed only those calls that might lead Whitney and his men to a productive raid.<br>
<br>
The tap even had advantages.  Some of Olmstead's most jubilant moments came when he telephoned false directions to his men about the landing of boats.  Then he sauntered casually to the street, where he used a public phone to give correct directions, confident that Whitney would spend the night on a lonely beach clutching a heavy revolver and (he hoped) shivering in the rain.  One night Olmstead's men left a lighted yellow lantern on Whitney's car as a jeering symbol of their ridicule.<br>
<br>
However, in October, 1924, Whitney had a valuable windfall when Canadian officials seized Olmstead's boat, the Eva B., on a customs charge.  Aboard were a three-man crew and a cargo of 784 cases.  Olmstead's hirelings talked, and as Whitney sifted the evidence, he kept two agents constantly manning the phone tap.<br>
<br>
In November, Whitney led a raid on Olmstead's home and arrested Olm-
stead, his wife Elsie and 15 guests who were entertaining themselves
by reading children's bedtime stories over Olmstead's radio station.  Whitney was jubilant, for he was convinced that he had enough evidence for a grand jury.  The next night, he and his superior, Roy Olmstead had left them to contemplate, lit it and ran it up the flagpole that topped their office.<br>
<br>
Olmstead and his attorney, Jerry Finch, cried loudly that their civil liberties had been violated, but, on January 19, 1925, a Federal grand jury indicted Olmstead and 90 other defendants for conspiring to violate the Volstead Act, and this set in motion what promised to be the biggest trial yet held under the Eighteenth Amendment.<br>
<br>
Olmstead's reaction to the indictment and to the publicity that ensued was characteristically direct: he posted bail, then went back to his office, tightened up his table of organization, placed orders in Canada for more liquor, and set his boats and trucks in motion again.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, some of his co-defendants panicked.  A few fled in haste to Canada.  Others went to Whitney and pleaded guilty, agreeing to testify for the government in return for promises of leniency.  A dozen more banded together and hired George Vanderveer, the famed "counsel of the damned," who began to prepare the acid rhetoric which would make a national issue of wire tapping by Federal agents.<br>
<br>
In January, 1926, the trial opened in Seattle before Judge Jeremiah Neterer.  Prosecuting the case was Thomas P. Revelle, a former Methodist minister who was U.S. District Attorney here.  Among the parade of government witnesses were Canadian officials, Olmstead employees, William Boeing and the steward of the Arctic Club.<br>
Then, to bind together all the defendants and to prove-as Revelle charged in his opening statement-that Olmstead was Seattle's unofficial police chief, Whitney and other agents took the stand to tell what they had heard over Olmstead's tapped telephone.  Transcripts of those conversations were never offered in evidence, although govemment witnesses were allowed frequent looks at "the book" to "refresh their memories."<br>
<br>
Vanderveer howled indignantly because the court refused to let him examine "the book." He cited a Washington State statute adopted in 1 909 which made wire tapping illegal.  Law, insisted Vanderveer, cannot sanction a violation of law as a means of obtaining evidence. (A double irony was involved: not only had a Federal law encouraged disrespect for law itself but so had the methods that the government used to enforce it.)<br>
<br>
Olmstead watched and listened as his fate unwound, confident that a higher court would uphold Vanderveer.  He was also impressed with
the deep irony which escaped the attention of those less intimate with the details than he.<br>
<br>
Olmstead roared with laughter as some of the phony phone calls-the products of his own humor-were brought in evidence against him, and he <B>griii</B>ned good-naturedly at the U. S. Attorney's young assistant, whom he had supplied-and was continuing to supplywith top-notch Canadian whiskey.<br>
<br>
The conclusion, though, was never really in doubt.  On March 9, 1926, Judge Neterer fined Roy Olmstead $8,000-he had been convicted with 22 co-defendants-and sentenced him to four years at hard labor in a Federal penitentiary.<br>
<br>
In March, 1927, after the Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reverse the verdict, Olmstead began serving his term at McNeil Island.  Ten months later, he was released on bail as the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review his case-specifically, "whether the use of evidence of private telephone conversations . . . intercepted by means of wire tapping, is in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments."<br>
<br>
The case was heard in February, 1928.  In a five-to-four decision, the Court ruled against Olmstead.  The majority opinion was written by Chief Justice William Howard Taft, but far better remembered is the ringing dissent by Judge Louis Brandeis.<br>
<br>
"Every unjustifiable intrusion by the Government upon the privacy of the individual, whatever the means employed, must be deemed in violation of the Fourth Amendment," wrote Brandeis.  "If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for the law ... it invites anarchy . . . Against that pernicious doctrine this Court should resolutely set its face."<br>
<br>
Public opinion supported Brandeis, but this was small comfort to Olmstead, who was remanded to McNeil Island amid a swirl of controversy.  The decision against him by the Taft majority, complained the New York Times, 'made universal snooping possible."<br>
While Olmstead languished at McNeil, an enormous change was taking place in the world outside.  Faith in the Eighteenth Amendment was rapidly dissipating as attention shifted to the Great Depression.<br>
Olmstead's exemplary conduct behind bars won him release after serving 35 months of his four-year sentence.<br>
<br>
By now, the dry forces were in full retreat, and a bill before the State Legislature would soon repeal all state prohibition laws. (Another bill, introduced by State Senator Ed Benn, would make wire tapping a far more serious crime than it had been in the days when Olmstead was convicted.)
But the greatest change for Roy Olmstead was a personal one.  After having ,,pent many months in the prison library, he saw Seattle in 1931 with the eyes of one profoundly impressed with the grandeur of spiritual and civic law.  Turning away from all offers of wealth -from a night club, from a liquor distributor-he chose to dedicate himself to the principles of the Church of Christ, Scientist.<br>
<br>
Soon the U.S. repealed the Eighteenth Amendment altogether.  In 1933, Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, president of Columbia University and a leading Republican critic of prohibition, spoke analytically about the dry decade.  Among the "moving influences" which hastened repeal he listed bootlegging, corruption of officials and, not least, the Supreme Court's decision in the Olmstead case-a decision which, said Butler brought "revulsion and revolt."<br>
<br>
On Christmas Day, 1935, Roy Olmstead received an impressive document.  "Whereas it has been made to appear to me that . . . Roy Olmstead, since his release from imprisonment, has been conducting himself in a law-abiding manner, and that he is unable to pay his fine and costs: Now, therefore, be it known that I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States . . . do hereby grant the said Roy Olmstead a full and unconditional pardon . . . "<br>
<br>
Not long afterward Olmstead, then 49, began crossing Puget Sound again to preach Christian Science to the prisoners.  They frequently asked if he was really Roy Olmstead, "King of the rumrunners," and he had a stock reply.  "No," he told them firmly, "not any more,. The old Olmstead is dead.":<br>

The preceeding article tells how the skullduggery he committed during Prohibition landed Roy Olmstead in jail.  He has been out now for 30 years, leading a life that is startlingly different from his old one.  Seated in his comfortably furnished apartment on Capitol Hill, Olmstead eagerly tells all comers about his metamorphosis, which began while he was serving time on McNeil Island.<br>
<br>

Says Olmstead, who is a big, cheerful, square-faced teetotaler of 78: "I started asking myself questions like, 'When did you break the law?' The answer was, 'All day long.' Then a little voice asked, 'How long did this go on?' and I answered, 'Till they locked me up.' The voice asked whether I liked it here.  I said, 'I don't.  This is my last trip.'<br>
<br>
"Then I got to thinking and I wondered one day how evil got into man.  I didn't believe in God, but rather that every man makes his own heaven and his own hell, and that didn't seem to explain much."<br>
So Olmstead, seeking further light, holed up in the prison library.  First he read all the books there about psychology, but, says Olmstead, "They didn't have the answer." Then he read all the works he could find by a half-dozen vaunted philosophers, and, he recalls, "They didn't have the answer either."<br>
<br>
He had pursued his search for a year or so when, at last, a celimate handed him a copy of Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures, by Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science.<br>
That book, which, according to Olmstead, propounds the concept that "man rules the universe through spiritual law," made such a tremendous impression on him that he gaily told himself, "This gal's got it, Jack."<br>
<br>
As Olmstead speaks of his conversion, the words tumble out in profusion:<br>
<br>
"I had to learn to live my life over in order to be more useful instead of trying to regulate people.  I knew the law.  I saw temptation ... easy money.  I began to see that tainted money was counterfeit."<br>
<br>
When he was released from prison, Olmstead turned down several "good deals" that would have brought him new wealth - among them, the legitimate importing of alcoholic beverages.  The reason he gave was simple: "I said 1 didn't need the money."<br>
<br>
In truth, however, Olmstead, who had once handied money by the fistful, was broke.  He took whatever jobs he could find, working off and on as a peddler and a construction laborer, then for several years as a real estate agent.  All the while, Olmstead was pursuing his studies of Christian Science.<br>
<br>
"People came to me for help," he says.  "I would pray for them, and they would be healed."<br>
<br>
One day, toward the end of 1948, a friend urged him to go into
business as a Christian Science practitioner.  After giving the proposal careful thought, Olmstead agreed to do so.<br>
<br>
Many of those who now seek him out have had trouble with the law, and Olmstead feels uniquely suited to give them help.  Among his regular duties are weekly trips to the Seattle jail, where he talks with prisoners in a language they can readily comprehend.<br>
<br>
His mission, says Olmstead, is to help the inmates understand, both emotionally and spiritually, why they got there.  "When they realize this," he adds, "they never go back."<br>
<br>
Despite his age, Olmstead spends three days a week in a downtown office and maintains another office in his apartment.  When his phone rings, as it repeatedly does, he answers it with a courteous "Good morning," "Good Afternoon" or "Good Evening" - never just "Hello." The advice he gives is offered with the comforting assurance that, somehow, Olmstead knows exactly what he's talking about.<br>
<br>
"You getting those cracked places straightened out?" he asked one caller.  "Just keep trying," he told another, "and I'll be by to see you in the morning."<br>
<br>
For those who, as did the younger Roy Olmstead, stray not only inches but miles from the law, Olmstead urges special consideration.  "They need compassion," he insists.  "Just because a man makes a mistake, why should we condemn him?"<br>
<br>
In the 20's, Olmstead made plenty of mistakes, but today, the last thing he needs or asks for is compassion for himself.  Olmstead has such a storehouse of it that he is prescribing it-much the same way that he once bootlegged booze, wholesale.<br>

<br>
The gravelly crunch of footsteps on a dark, lonely beach, an occasional flicker from a flashlight, a muffled voice carried on the wind.  In the morning, no evidence would remain of the hasty transfer of precious liquid cargo from boat to powerful roadster. 
But another load of booze had been safely delivered to its Peninsula destination.<br>
<br>
On January 16, 1920, responding to more than 30 years of lobbying against the evils of "John Barleycorn" by Carrie Nation, suffragettes, and churches, the Volstead Act propelled the country into a moralistically driven experiment in abstinence from alcohol.  While plenty of people hailed Prohibition as a triumph of good over evil, still others saw it as an opportunity to turn a tidy profit.<br>
<br>
Because the restrictions of Prohibition didn't extend across the border to Canada, easy money could be made ferrying spirits to thirsty Yanks.  A case of whiskey that cost $20 in Canada was routinely sold for  $200 on the American market.  Located a mere 20 miles across the Strait of Juan de Fuca from Victoria, British Columbia, the Olympic Peninsula was a convenient target for the adventuresome rogues who came to be known as "rumrunners."<br>
<br>
Of course, their stock in trade consisted of much more than rum; all manner of alcoholic beverages, from imported whiskeys and rare brandies to the finest champagne, were deposited on Peninsula shores.<br>
<br>
In the beginning, folks of all sorts tried their hands at the new game.  But stray acts of hijacking, including a murder-not to mention high-speed U.S. Coast Guard "revenuer" armed with one-pound guns soon weeded out the fainthearted.  British Columbian whole-
salers grew to monopolize the booze brokerage from Victoria and Vancouver, completely legally under Canadian law.<br>
<br>
They contracted with reliable carriers to tote the goods.  Some simply cruised to the U.S.-Canadian border and transferred their loads to American receivers; others, more daring, delivered directly onto U.S. soil.<br>
<br>
Among the most successful was Johnny Schnarr.  Born in Chehalis, Schnarr spent much time on the B.C. coast as a young man.<br>
<br>
Realizing the potential profits, he had taken on rumrunning as a full time occupation by 1921.  Schnarr was a natural mechanic who had an eye for fast boats.  With no formal training, he could carve a model, take it to a shipyard, and produce a boat that was hard to beat.<br>
<br>
Schnarr's boats were typically sleek-long, low, narrow, and painted an inconspicuous dark gray-and each could hold up to 250 cases of liquor, stowed on deck for easy off-loading.<br>
<br>
Besides other inland water ports, Schnarr made semi-regular deliveries for Consolidated Exporters out of Victoria to at least nine drop-off sites along the northern coast of the Peninsula,
earning $11 per case.  Like his fellow rumrunners, he averaged four or five trips per month in the fall, winter, and spring, when dark nights and stormy weather provided the best cover from patrolling revenuer.<br>
<br>
Early in his career, Schnarr headed out to deliver a load at a small bay about a mile east of Port Angeles.  By the time he approached the designated rendezvous point in his boat, Moonbeam a sudden gale was whipping the waves up to 20 feet.  Not caring to brave the ele-
ments twice in one night, he agreed to the suggestion of his contact, Barney Sampson, that they lay over at the government wharf in Port Angeles.<br>
<br>
Only after the Moonbeam was safely tied to the dock did the harbor master mention that the 85-foot Coast Guard cutter Arcata was berthed on the other side.  While the hospitable wharfinger thoroughly enjoyed his role in putting one over on the Coasties, an anxious Schnarr snuck back out of the harbor before dawn, as soon as the wind abated.<br>
<br>
While on board the Miss Victoria II, during a delivery to liquor lord Carl Melby on Dungeness Spit, Schnarr ran into a different kind of problem.  Though the weather was fair with only a light swell running, the tide change caused huge breakers to form near the sandy shallows.  Responding to the usual flashlight signal, two shorts and two longs, Schnarr's assistant, Griffith, piled a load of hooch into the flat-bottomed skiff and headed toward land.<br>
<br>
Near shore a wave caught him, overturning the boat and tossing him ashore unconscious.  Griffith was revived, every bottle was recovered unbroken, and Schnarr and Griffith eventually climbed back aboard the Miss Victoria-but not before another rogue wave once again sent them bow-over-stern.<br>
<br>
However lucrative, waterborne deliveries comprised only half of the rumrunners' business.  To realize the greatest profits, contraband liquor had to be transferred from drop-off points to metropolitan markets.  Shoreside authorities' physical and mental mettle was put to the test as they chased moonshiners by day and rumrunners by night.<br>
<br>
Jefferson County Sheriff Phil Chase was well known in the area as the "scourge of the Volstead violators." Relentless in his pursuit of offenders, Chase rounded up operators of stills with capacities ranging from one pint to 100 gallons.  The stills themselves were donated to the Women's Christian Temperance Union so they could receive the proceeds from the recycled copper.<br>
<br>
The enterprising sheriff also made headway against the land-based
rumrunning operations of Port Angeles, Dungeness, and Blyn by setting up roadblocks near Port Discovery, where a sharp turn in the road offered natural cover to the police.<br>
<br>
Despite tip-offs by locals, including an alert network of phone operators, one successful blockade snared three high-powered cars and 50 cases of liquor valued at $3,000.<br>
<br>
The unfortunate auto rumrunner Arlie Seifort met his match when he was pulled over near Mount Walker while driving a truck belonging to W. J. Wallace of Des Moines.  At first, the officers weren't at all interested in his cargo of potatoes. It was only when Seifort jumped from the running board, falling 200 feet from the bridge embankment into the Quilcene River canyon, that they because suspicious.<br>
<br>
Fifteen cases of Johnny Walker Red were discovered hidden under the pile of spuds, and Seifort was apprehended the next morning as he climbed back up the bank.<br>
<br>
In local newspaper stories, which were all but buried amidst the excitement over the proposed <B>Olympic </B>Loop Highway, Sheriff Chase complained about the public's apathetic attitude toward his crusade.  Even while recounting his successes reporters tended to write in a joking manner about the <B>rum</B>runners' escapades, and the local citizenry seemed to entertain a good deal of sympathy for the scoundrels, often showing them hospitality and offering aid.<br>
<br>
Doris Hufford, who lived on Protection island, recalled a boat running aground there on its way back to Victoria after a booze run.  Though the "guests," as she referred to them, had guns and "binocular cases stuffed with wet money," they were courteous and helpful.  The grounded boat floated away, but was later located in Discovery Bay by Hufford's father and the culprits continued their escape over the border.<br>
<br>
When caught, transgressors of distilling and rumrunning were routinely fined $250 plus costs, with <B>am </B>occasional 30 to 60 days in jail for repeat offenders.  The confiscated liquor, however, may have been too tempting for some to pass <B>up.  </B><br>
<br>
After reports of the smashing of 40 cases of <B>fine </B>whiskey, beer, and champagne at the Port Townsend city dump rumors circulated about an "enormous, bold and ferocious ghost white rodent, without parallel in the history of ratdom."<br>
<br>
Nameless participants in the romance of rumrunning suffered even worse luck.  Boating at night without lights in the nastiest weather the strait could produce was dangerous at best.<br>
<br>
One stormy February night, <B>a </B>resident of Beckett Point on the east side of Discovery Bay, heard a crash.  The next morning, he found the wreck of a "neat little cabin cruiser" thought to be a rumrunner
abandoned on shore.  <B>On </B>another occasion, Captain Lonsdale of the Areata fired on a boat off Port Townsend, seriously injuring a crew member.<br>
<B><br>
In </B>1924, frustrated with the ineffectiveness of their older boats, the Coast Guard launched a new fleet of 75-foot rum chasers powered by 200 horsepower Sterling engines, these "hooch hounds" could achieve speeds of tip to 18 knots, posing a new threat to the rum trade.<br>
<br>
Though many of his competitors were forced out of business, Schnarr rose to the occasion replacing his old engines with 300 horse power airplane engines, bumping his speed up to 30 knots. Soon he was commissioning ever larger and faster boats.<br>
<br>
One December night in the late 1920s Schnarr set out to make a delivery halfway down Discovery Bay. But the revenuer had been tipped off and were waiting along the dark shore as he entered the enclosed harbor.  Luckily, Schnarr's excellent night vision was able to detect the phosperescence from the cutter's bow wave.<br>
<br>
Schnarr hit the throttle, split the boat around and tore through a volley of machine gun fire and tracer bullets, tearing past five more revenuer before hitting open water.  Later, he learned that ten cutters had been sent out and a $25,000 reward offered for the capture of his boat.<br>
<br>
With the onset of the Depression rum running slowed as demand diminished.  The few folks who could afford liquor at all began to switch to moonshine.  Meanwhile, anti-prohibition sentiment was gathering momentum; opponents cited overbearing government power and increased crime.  More importantly the ban had eliminated jobs and reduced tax revenues.<br>
<br>
During the presidential election of 1932, the Democratic party and its candidate, Franklin D.  Roosevelt, endorsed the repeal of prohibition.  <B>On </B>April 4, 1933, the country's most ambitious moral experiment came to an end.<br>
<br>
And the rumrunners? Most sold their highly specialized boats wherever they could and resumed normal lives. Even the often sought but never caught Schnarr was forced to piece out his last boat.<br>
<br>
After a spelling at logging, Schnarr fished commercially off the west coast of Vancouver Island, retiring at the age of 75. And down on the Olympic Peninsula, dark, stormy nights were once again peaceful.<br>

<br>
Two boys had been patching a derelict skiff for days, picking up remnants of oakum from the boat yard and stuffing them into the cracks and crevices that lined the old hull.  They were close to a launching but needed some pitch to top the seams.  They searched around the many piers that dotted Port Townsend's water front in the <B>1920S, </B>hoping to find some roofing tar hidden among the accumulated debris.<br>
<br>
At the end of the line, near UNION WHAPF, one of them found a large, tightly sealed can.  On prying it open, they discovered a dark sticky substance that appeared to be just right for the job.<br>
<br>
They carried their find to the old boat and built a fire.  Before long they were covering the dinghy with a hot goo.  There was a familiarity to the odor that drifted down the beach.  By time the old sailors had tracked it to its source, the boys were somewhere beyond incoherent.  They sat in a stupor contemplating their labor, a worthless rowboat caulked with five pounds of opium.<br>
<br>
October was unusually cold in 1979.  The cruising season was two months gone, and except for commerciai <B>traffic, few boats ventured </B>into the twisting channels that separate the San Juan Islands.  Of those that did, one was under special scrutiny.  Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) men had been watching a particular island for a long time.  They had expected the boat and knew why it had come.  It was dark when the agents went ashore.<br>
<br>
In the ensuing confusion, the boat managed to slip its moorings and escape, heading south.  It was fast and powerfull, a good match for the Coast Guard cutter that pursued it.  They followed by radar as it cleared Cattle Point and headed across the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  By the time they reached Point Wilson, it had vanished from their screens.<br>
<br>
The morning after the unsuccessful DEA raid, a Discovery Bay resident reported finding a large plastic bag full of tightly wrapped plant material.  Via citizens I                                                                                          band radio, word spread fast.<br>
<br>
When the Coast Guard cutter Point Bennett raced around the eastern end of the strait picking up bale after bale of "Thai stick," the shore near North Beach was being scoured by interested citizens and local police.<br>
<br>
A local gillnetter informed the Coast Guard by radio that he had picked up several kilos and would deliver them to Seattle.  In all,
more than two million dollars worth of marijuana was recovered, much of it still on the smugglers' boat, which was found abandoned off Whidbey Island.  The helpful fisherman never arrived in Seattle.  Twelve days later he put out a distress call.  He was found drifting <B>in</B> his boat south of Smith Island.  Due to lack of evidence, no charges were filed against him.<br>
<br>
When the DEA made its raid in 1979, the boys who had caulked their boat with opium were more than sixty years old, but over the years the game had changed very little.  Even the basic commodities remained the same.  Smuggling on the Olympic Peninsula began as soon as there was a border to cross.<br>
<br>
At first it was done with relative impunity.  In the early 1850s, the customs district headquarters were located in Olympia, a comfortable spot, but too far away from the action to be an effective deterrent.  When the port of entry was moved to Port Townsend, the level of risk increased slightly, but important contraband flowed like water through a sieve.<br>
<br>
Until Victor Smith took over customs duty <B>in 1861,</B> <B>" </B> smuggling was a truly democratic institution, practiced by each according to want.  Smith took the radical approach that even in territories laws were to be accorded a certain respect.<br>
<br>
His first act was to come down hard on the importation without taxation of Canadian whiskey.  By increasing the level of difficulty, hc also increased the degree of specialization necessary to overcome it.  By the cnd of the Civil War, smuggling was a well-established trade in the Northwest.<br>
<br>
With restrictions on <B>CHINESE </B>immigration and the inception of the Chinese Exclusion Acts, an element of grotesque cruelty was added to the scene.  Chinese, desperate to get into the country, would sign on with unscrupulous smugglers.  Herded on board ships like cattle, they were shackled on deck to an anchor chain.  If the ship were approached by a customs boat, the anchor would be cut loose, sending the evidence to the bottom of the strait.<br>
<br>
Like other outlaws of the time, a cult of personality surrounded the smugglers.  They were both reviled and revered as Robin Hoods.  While their deeds were often widely known or at least surmised, lack of sufficient evidence kept most from jail.  Those that were appre-
hended generally received light sentences.<br>
<br>
The most notorious, men like James Jamieson and Larry Kelly, were a continual topic in Puget Sound newspapers.  The blame for enery unsolved crime in the region would invariably find its way to their doorstep.  A few, like State Legislator Ed Sims, even managed to turn their notoriety to political advantage.<br>

Since the turn of the century, smuggling on Puget Sound has waxed and waned with the fashions of law and society, its profitability increasing in proportion to the measures used to halt it.<br>

O. S. Vanolinda, "Dope," <B>History of Vashon-Maury Islands.</B> Vashon,  Washington: The Vashon Island News Review, 1935, p. 84-87.<br>
<br>
Some thirteen years after the first settlement was made on Vashon, in the summer of 1891, to be exact, J. E. Mace bought a ten-acre tract of wild land In what was then known as the "Vermontville" settlement, now (1935)) the Glen Acres district.<br>
<br>
Thirteen years seems almost a life-time, perhaps, to a youngster of that age, but it wasn't really much time in those days when homes had to be carved and grubbed from the virgin forest, the popular tools being the axe and grub hoe and our islands were still something above ninety-eight per cent timber land.  In those days, too, everything which came to the farmer's meat-house was meat.  In other words, Vashon farmers made use of every available thing which came to hand and wasted little.<br>
<br>
Mace, at heart a pioneer, had few resources and almost every Sunday would see him combing the beach, where he picked up quantities of lumber and often other articles of which he could, and did, make use.<br>
<br>
Thus it happened that he was taking his usual stroll on the beach one fine Sunday morning in the early spring of 1895 and came upon a strong canvas sack which contained something very heavy.  He dragged it a little way up from the tide and carefully cut the strong cord with which it was tied-the sack would come in handy at "tater digging time," whatever its contents might be-and found a number of small tin cans, eighty of them when he counted them, they about one pound each and each very neatly and carefully wrapped in oiled paper, but with no label or mark of any nature to disclose what they might contain.<br>
<br>
He cut open the top of one of the cans with the large blade of his pocket knife and found it filled with a yellowish brown, pasty mass which had little odor and he was no wiser than when he had first found the sack.<br>
<br>
He carried the sack of cans up off the beach a short distance on the south side of Dilworth Point, hid it under a large log and, taking
the can he had opened, went up the hill to the home of a neighbor, John Hopkins and asked him if he knew what queer kind of putty it was.<br>
<br>
Hopkins was an Englishman, widely travelled and of education and experience.  He took one glance, at Mace's "Putty" and told him that it was opium.<br>
<br>
Mace knew that there "was a law," but he didn't know a thing as to its details.  He went back and carried the sack of dope up the hill and showed his find to Asa Start, an old friend and neighbor who lived directly across the road from his own place.  They buried the stuff on Start's place, making a rough map and marking the spot where it was hidden so that it could be easily found again.<br>
<br>
This map Mace gave to his wife, telling her to give it to anyone who might come around looking for the stuff-if such should happen and he took the next morning boat for Seattle to learn his rights and duties in regard to it.<br>
<br>
Two strangers had been for several days roaming over the island, ostensibly looking for a tract of land to suit them, but in talking with the farmers, invariably bringing the conversation around to the subject of smugglers and dope running.<br>
<br>
They put in an appearance at the Hopkins place on the very<br>
morning on which Mace left for Seattle and, after some small talk, asked Hopkins if he had ever heard of any dope showing up on the island.  He told them of Mace's find of the day previous.<br>
<br>
They lost no time in getting up to the Mace place and exchanged knowing glances when Mrs. Mace told them that Mr. Mace was "not at home." After considerable questioning they finally told her they were officers looking for opium, which was supposed to be in Mace's possession.<br>
<br>
She said she knew nothing whatever of it, but showed them the map which he had given her.  ' They wasted no more time in conver-
sation, but at once resurrected the dope and carted it off to Seattle.<br>
<br>
Returning- home that evening, Mace learned what had taken place, then back to Seattle the next morning to put in his claim at the Customs office, but it availed him nothing.  The man in charge told him that he had had no part in assisting them and furthermore, that both he and Start were under suspicion and the less they had to say the healthier it might be for them. Mace didn't even get his "tater sack" out of the transaction.<br>
<br>
So he returned to his grub-hoe and stumps, a little Poorer, but.
much-very much-wiser.  He conveyed the impression to his neighbors by the use of numerous lurid adjectives, not really naughty, You understand, as he was a good , but forcible, satisfying and to the point, that next time, if any, things would be decidedly different.<br>
<br>
History repeated itself so quickly in this instance that it might almost be said to have stuttered.  Three weeks after his first adventure in the suppression of the dope evil, M<ace was again devoting himself to the business and pleasure of combing scantlings  and other flotson and Jetson from the beach when he came upon another heavy canvas sack, identical with his first find.<br>
<br>
This time he carried it up into the timber and quickly and skillfully concealed it, doing it, as he said, " with one hand so that even his other hand didn't know what was going on," and he took counsel with no one.<br>
<br>
The following morning he disturbed the slumbers of his son, Ed, at an early hour with orders to row him down to Vashon Landing in time for him to catch the Iola/  Just Off the south side of Dilworth Point he had his son beach the boat where he carried aboard one heavy canvas sack, which might have contained clams, so far as the son knew, but it really was something vastly different from clams.<br>
<br>
On reaching Vashon Dock the sack was transferred to the little steamer, to Seattle and then up to the Customs Office, where he turned it in and made his claim for the reward allowed by law in such cases.<br>
<br>
Owing to the, to them, suspicious circumstances surrounding their very recent contact with Mace, the customs officers "put up an argument" and held the case up for several weeks but finally on a court order by Judge Hanford in June, 1895, Mace received one hundred and seventy-five dollars for turning in his "brown putty." It was reported at the time to have sold for $564.00.<br>
<br>
The federal officers, however, were far from satisfied as to Mace's exact status.  Months passed.  Ed Mace married, built the present home, put in a little saw mill and was working it one day when two men with guns and dogs stopped to talk with him.  They volunteered the information that they were hunting grouse and presently one of them asked what were the chances of borrowing Ed's cap, as his "hat was a damned nuisance, following the dogs through the brush.<br>
<br>
Ed let him have the cap and the men went into the woods to the north a distance of about half a mile to a trail which they thought was being used by smugglers. Here they gave the dogs the scent of Ed's cap and vainly endeavored to get them to lead them
back to the little sawmill.<br>
<br>
The dogs, no doubt, saved Ed a heap of trouble as it as later discovered that the men were government detectives and the dogs bloodhounds.<br>

SMUGGLING.<br>
<br>
B. H. Scribner, "A wine smuggler spills all," <B>Seattle Magazine.</B> V(November, 1968) p. 11-14.<br>
<br>
Three months ago, this magazine published a brief commentary about three physicians who had been convicted of smuggling wines into Washington State from California [Publisher's Page, August, 1968].  I am one of those physicians, and I am writing this article both to explain why I felt compelled to break Washington's liquor law and to suggest some ways in which that law might b@ changed.<br>
<br>
I first became interested in wines in 1957, when I was granted a year's sabbatical from my teaching position at the U. of W. During that year, my wife and I lived in London, and though neither of us had even a rudimentary knowledge of wine (color perception was our only means of differentiating between red wine and white), through a combination of dining in some of London's better restaurants and taking occasional side trips to France we soon discovered the exciting world of wine tasting.<br>
<br>
By the time we returned to Seattle, we had both developed such a strong liking for fine wines that I resolved to start collecting great vintages of one particular variety-namely, Bordeaux rouge, or claret, as it is called in England.<br>
<br>
Why red Bordeaux? First, because I happen to like the taste of the wine better than that of red Burgundies or any of the white wines.  More important, among "still" wines-that is, wines which have not been fortified with alcohol-Bordeaux is the one most suitable for collecting because aging in the bottle enhances its quality.  Most white wines should be drunk fairly soon after they are bottled, and even the best red Burgundies reach their peak of perfection within 5 to 10 years.  A truly great claret, in contrast, should not be opened for at least 20 years, and may be kept in the bottle for as long as four or five decades.<br>
<br>
In theory, at least, it is possible to enjoy great wines simply by purchasing a choice vintage whenever the mood strikes you. 
However, this practice is exorbitantly expensive, since the demand for a great wine always far exceeds the supply.  The result is that the price of the important vintages increases rapidly with the passage of time. (For example, a case of 1961 Lafite -
Rothschild purchased as soon as available in 1964 has now more than doubled in value.)<br>
<br>
In addition, on-the-spot purchase is usually impractical because of the very limited number of really good wine merchants with adequate cellar capacity for prolonged storage.  Besides, wine collecting makes wine drinking much more exciting.<br>
<br>
A truly great wine has a life of its own, perhaps not in a biological sense, but certainly in terms of processes that are going on all the time in the bottle: sedimentation, aging, the gradual improvement of flavor and bouquet.  Therefore, the enjoyment of vintage wines is enhanced by selecting them soon after they are bottled, letting them age in your own cellar and then, many years later, sharing them with a son-or even a grandson.<br>
<br>
Moreover, I enjoy the challenge of distinguishing a great wine from a lesser one by comparing the wines in my cellar to learn for myself whether all that is said about a given vintage is true.  These things require the maintenance of a sizable cellar.<br>
<br>
In Washington, I soon discovered, it is impossible to build up a good wine collection by buying through the state liquor<br>
stores,  simply because  these  stores  are  not set up to  handle fine wines. No  state  store  I have ever seen, for  example,   has  a wine cellar; instead, the wines usually are placed upright on a shelf .<br>
<br>
While this sort of treatment is not injurious to most alcoholic beverages, fine wines require considerably more care. When bottles of wine are stored upright, their corks dry out and allow air to enter, which creates the possibility of spoilage.  The same result can be produced if the room temperature fluctuates too far above or below the ideal level of 55 to 60 degrees. (Wines obtained by special order through the Liquor Control Board, I might point out, are shipped with the regular boxcar loads of other beverages-and they often sit on a siding under the hot sun for hours at a time.)<br>
<br>
Another obstacle to procuring good wines through the Liquor Board, I found, is that the Board has no means of learning what the good wines are.  It does not employ a single knowledgeable wine buyer, and even if it did, the Board lacks the direct purchasing connections necessary to obtain first-rate foreign wines.<br>
<br>
A customer wishing to buy, say, a fine Bordeaux must be able to
tell the Board which importer handles the wine he desires, and he must then pay the importer's regular retail price, plus the Board's markup of 76.64 per cent. (Incidentally, the local retail stores that handle good wines also have to buy through the Liquor Control Board.  Because they have liquor licenses, they do not pay as high a markup as individuals pay, but they still have to tell the Board what importer to buy from, they still have no control over methods of shipment, and quite often they are not permitted to order wines in the quantities they desire.)<br>
<br>
Perhaps the greatest handicap to procuring fine wines through the Liquor Board, though, is the well-known rule which prohibits their employees' offering the customer any advice at all.  This, of course, places a great burden upon the collector, who needs to be apprised of many details about the wines (the idiosyncrasies of the chateau, the characteristics of the "year") before making his selection-a service unthinkable to the Liquor Board.<br>
<br>
Small wonder, then, that I finally decided to bypass the Board completely and to build my wine collection from out-of-state sources.<br>
<br>
My first break came in 1959, when a famous restaurant in San Francisco went out of business.  A close friend of mine was in charge of the wine cellar there, and he agreed to sell me his entire Bordeaux collection at cost.  With this bounty as a nucleus, I gradually built up my collection by ordering wines through a San Francisco importer who, as a result of his yearly trips to France, was able to give me expert advice about which wines to buy.<br>
<br>
Because of the Washington liquor law, I could not have the wine shipped directly to Seattle, so whenever I drove down to San Francisco, I would load a few cases in the back of my station wagon and haul them back up the coast.<br>
<br>
In those days I did not think of this practice as "criminal." Though I knew I was breaking a law, I had been given to understand that in matters of this sort the law was winked at.  "As long as you don't sell the stuff," a member of the Liquor Board had told my attorney in 1962, "and as long as you're not out to beat the system by bringing in the stock items we handle, it's okay.  "<br>
<br>
I understood, of course, that this pronouncement was unofficial, but it was not until this past Spring that I discovered how " unofficial" it really was.  In early May while my wife and I were attending a medical conference in Atlantic City, N.J., Liquor Control Board officers who we learned with a search warrant entered my home through an unlocked door and Confiscated every bottle of wine they could find that was not normally stocked in the state liquor stores.  Each item they took was carefully noted
on an inventory sheet which they left conspicuously on my coffee table.<br>
<br>
When I got back from the East Coast and discovered what had happened, I couldn't believe it.  Even after I had called my attorney, it didn't sink in for hours that this was really serious-that I had actually committed a criminal offense, for which I could get sent to jail.<br>
<br>
The following day, though, I turned myself in at the county jail, where I was booked, photographed and finger printed (a procedure which I found degrading, to say the least), and on May 22, I appeared <B>in</B> court.  After being found guilty, I was given a six-month suspended sentence for "possession of illegal alcohol," and in addition, I was fined $250.<br>
<br>
After the criminal prosecution was over, my attorney and I started negotiations with the Liquor Control Board for return of my wine.  We indeed were lucky that there was any wine left to negotiate about, since the ,Board's usual practice is to destroy the loot immediately upon confiscation.  In my case, somehow they sensed that destroying my beautiful collection of claret would be like destroying a collection of fine stamps or paintings.<br>
<br>
The negotiations led to the opportunity to repurchase the collection by paying 76.64 per cent of the original retail purchase price.  Because of the immense cost, I bought back only as much as I could afford, and several of my wine-loving friends got together and purchased most of the remaining bottles.<br>
<br>
All things considered, the Liquor Control Board treated me quite well.  They had been forced to seize my wines oft a complaint from a spiteful informant, and I think they felt genuinely dismayed at having to prosecute me.  Even so, I still find it difficult to recall the experience with equanimity.  The fact remains that I was convicted of a gross misdemeanor, that I received a good deal of unfavorable publicity, and that, because my case concerned illegal alcohol, I now have " mug shots" and fingerprints on file with the F.B.I.<br>
<br>
These things resulted not from my having done anything which I consider morally wrong, but rather from my having broken a state law designed to protect Washington "wines" which, to my palate, are undrinkable.  In my opinion, this law should be changed, and I propose three ways to do it.<br>
<br>
My first suggestion-first because it would solve the problem for the wine connoisseur, and because it is the simplest-would be to modify the existing laws to exempt "still" wines from state control, just as beer is now exempted.  If this were done, anyone
who was interested could become a wine merchant. (Frederick & Nelson, for example, with its buying connections in Europe and else-here, could really go to town with its wine department.) Moreover, California wine merchants would be able to sell directly to Washington residents.<br>
<br>
To be sure, the wine would still have  to  be  taxed  at  a  fair  rate, just like everything else, but at  least  it  would be readily available here.<br>
<br>
Another reason to support this course of action is that removing still wines from Liquor Board control could (depending on how the out-of-state wine tax is structured) expose the Washington wine Producers to the beneficial effects of world competition.  Far from being ruinous to this local industry, such competition could lead to a vast improvement in the quality of Washington wines.<br>
<br>
It has been demonstrated conclusively that if proper production methods are used, it is possible to produce good wines from Washington-grown grapes-wines of such quality that they could compete with those from New York and California, as well as those from foreign countries, indeed, if the law were changed, Washington might well become as famous for its wines as it is for its apples and its airplanes.<br>
<br>
A second possibility-difficult for a state run operation but still feasible-would be for the Liquor Control Board itself to become a sophisticated wine merchant.  This would require hiring a knowledgeable person to run the wine division; having several well-stocked retail outlets with proper temperature-controlled cellars; setting up lines of communication to deal directly with shippers in Bordeaux, Burgundy, Germany and elsewhere; and permitting the wine store employees to recommend vintages.<br>
<br>
It would be a sweeping change, but if it could be worked out, the Liquor Control Board could probably compete quite well with private wine merchants-perhaps even in price.<br>
<br>
The third alternative would be to permit each wine lover to purchase his own wine openly, arrange for its shipment under proper conditions of temperature and storage and then pay the Liquor Control Board a 'air amount for the privilege of doing so.<br>
<br>
One simple way of doing this would be for the supplier automatically to send a copy of the invoice to the Washington Liquor Authorities, who would then bill the customer for the taxes due.<br>
<br>
Perhaps none of these alternatives is entirely acceptable, but certainly something has to be done. Now that collecting fine wine
is  clearly established as a criminal offense, it is obvious that most collectors simply will abandon this fascinating hobby because of the most unpleasant possibility that they could end up in jail.<br>
<br>
More important is the fact that the residents of the State of Washington are being denied the opportunity to explore the world of fine wines.<br>

"Cigale smuggling case continues in court," <B>Marine Digest.</B> LIX (November 8, 1980) p. 22.<br>
<br>
PORTLAND - The nearly three-year-old Cigale marijuana smuggling case came to life again last week when Tommy Tindale, 35, of Virginia, went on trial in U.S. District Court here on charges of conspiracy, importation and possession of illegal marijuana.<br>
Two other men, Thomas Gerald Marengo, 30, of Connecticut, and Richard Scacchetano, 30, of New York, pleaded guilty to the charges.<br>
<br>
Authorities are looking for eleven others, seven of whom are fugitives, to face similar charges.<br>
<br>
The Cigale is a 126-foot ex-yacht which landed on a lonesome beach near Bandon, OR, on Dec. 31, 1977, with 17,000 pounds of marijuana.<br>
Federal, state, county and Coast Guard agents were lying in wait and raided the landing party, capturing 17 men, of whom 12 were convicted and sent to prison.<br>
<br>
The ship was brought to Portland and ultimately sold at auction to Bert E. May, for $203,000.  May converted her for black cod fishing, but with a poor-paying season he now has the vessel up for sale at Metakatla, AK, to an Alaskan Indian corporation.<br>
<br>
Federal authorities said the last group of 14 men are still facing smuggling charges.  Seven are fugitives, two pleaded guilty, one will have a separate trial, and one is awaiting disposition on
other drug charges.  One man died in Massachusetts of an apparent overdose of drugs.<br>

SMUGGLING.<br>
<br>
Nicholas E. Davis, "Some notes on Puget Sound smuggling," a paper written for Professor Michael Allen, University of Washington, Tacoma, as an intern at the Tacoma Public Library, 1994.<br>
<br>
"After the Treaty of 1846 settled the issue of the Canadian American border it resulted in opportunities to move goods illegally between the two countries without paying duty.(Keve 64)" Thus started one of the most lucrative smuggling operations in North America: illegal trade in various goods between British Columbia and the state of Washington, usually by boat through the waters of Puget Sound. Profitable items to smuggle included rum, Canadian whiskey, British woolens, opium, and illegal aliens.<br>
<br>
The late 1800s saw a dramatic increase in the amount of smuggling between Vancouver Island and Washington state. "Smuggling goods from Vancouver to Washington afforded profits tempting to island boat owners.(McDonald Seattle Times 29 Mar 59)" The boat owners were hauling Chinese laborers who would later work building American railroads. The Chinese also sparked the smuggling of Opium, a product they consumed.<br>
<br>
Lawrence Kelly was one  smuggler in both Chinese laborers and opium. Kelly was able to establish himself as a successful smuggler and avoid customs officials until "May 16 1886 when his Whitehall boat, sail and oars were seized at Tacoma.(McDonald 29 Mar 59)" The cargo of Kelly's craft consisted of "567 tins of prepared opium or the equivalent of 364 pounds of opium.(McDonald 29 Mar 59)" This was not  the last time that Lawrence Kelly was caught and fined by the customs service.<br>
<br>
Kelly earned the nickname the "King of smugglers" from both his peers in the business and the local press. Kelly continued to smuggle until 1909  as his "25 year career as one of the most notorious smugglers on the Pacific Coast came to an end  he then retired to a Louisiana soldiers home where he died.(McDonald 29 Mar 59)".<br>
<br>
The individual smuggler, like Lawrence Kelly also competed with larger smuggling operations on Puget Sound. The smuggling syndicate that operated out of Tacoma  in July of 1897 included
"government customs officers, political and financial leaders and even a special agent of the Secret Service"(Newell 11/21).<br>
<br>
The syndicate in Tacoma smuggled opium and Chinese laborers from British Columbia on the ship "Haytian Republic(Newell)", which also loaded legitimate cargo along with the contraband. The smugglers  used the Haytian Republic as a mother ship for smaller vessels sailing into Canadian waters to pick up the opium and Chinese. This operation involved dozens more people and a larger numbers of boats than the traditional single boat operation more common in Puget Sound.<br>
<br>
The Tacoma smuggling ring came to an end in "1898 when special investigators arrived from Washington D.C. to look into reports of government involvement in illegal trade.(Newell)" The smuggling  ring was destroyed, its perpetrators sentenced to  prison, and investors  never received a return  on their investment in the smuggling trade. Several customs officials were also arrested or released from their posts for failing to stop the smuggling that was only lightly concealed from authorities.<br>
<br>
A far smaller smuggling operation that also involved federal assets, indirectly, was conducted by  Jimmie Jones on his mail carrying duties on Puget Sound. Jimmie Jones was responsible for carrying the "United States mail, weekly, between Olympia and Victoria and all intermediate ports.(Huggins 9 Dec 1900)" This was a smuggler's dream-- entering and leaving the various ports along Puget Sound carrying the mail and all the extra contraband you could carry on your vessel.<br>
<br>
In fact, Jimmie Jones was finally arrested for smuggling and for "disregarding revenue laws of the United States(Huggins 9 Dec 1900)." Yet Jimmie Jones never made it to trial--he took his boat the "Jenny Jones" and bypassed the Customs House at Port Townsend. "The Customs House representative, who was on board, made all manner of threats to turn back to Port Townsend.(Huggins 9 Dec 1900)" Jimmie Jones released the customs agent after  the Jenny Jones had cleared Port Townsend never to be arrested again for smuggling on Puget Sound.<br>
<br>
The smuggling trade continued on Puget Sound into the twentieth century, with a new focus on Canadian Whiskey. The Prohibition amendment passed Congress in 1919, calling for abstinence from liquor. Needless to say there was still a market for good liquor despite government action to make the nation "dry". "In 1916, after a statewide vote, Washington began its own ill-fated experiment with prohibition"(Clark 15).<br>
<br>
Yet, the smugglers continued to risk federal prosecution by running whiskey between wet Canada and the  dry United States. A Seattle police lieutenant, Roy Olmstead, became partners with the very people he was charged to arrest. Roy Olmstead was the ring
leader of group of Seattle bootleggers. "During the twenties, newspapers hailed Olmstead as the booze baron"(Clark 14) due to Olmstead's claim to deliver only pure Canadian liquor, not the watered down variety  many smuggling operations used to stretch profits.<br>
<br>
It was not until 1920 that Olmstead was arrested and fined 500 dollars for violating the "Volstead Act"(Clark 16) and was dismissed from the police force. After being dismissed from the Seattle Police force Olmstead was able "to devote all his time and energy to the liquor business"(Clark 16).<br>
<br>
The smuggling operation, run by Olmstead, continued to grow through the early twenties until his reputation was became one of a "modern day Robin Hood"(Clark 14). This popular label among the people of Seattle stemmed from Olmstead's "unique code of ethics"(Clark 16) that included the idea that no amount of money was worth a human life and that his men never carried firearms while smuggling. "For most Seattle dwellers, it was impossible to regard Olmstead as an authentic criminal"(Clark 16).<br>
<br>
Despite his dismissal from the police department, Olmstead, was able to use his connections to obtain information and ask for leniency for his employees caught smuggling. By 1924 Olmstead's luck ran out and he was again arrested for conspiracy and smuggling,  making national headlines. Federal agents obtained information on Olmstead through a series of wire taps. Olmstead knew the taps had been placed but was able to use "public phones to give directions and orders to his men"(Clark 17).<br>
<br>
Arrested on January 19, 1925 "Olmstead and his attorney cried loudly that their civil liberties had been violated"(Clark 17), due to the wire tapping. Olmstead was able to make bail and, despite  a lengthy court battle, "he placed an order to Canada for more liquor and set boats and trucks in motion again"(Clark 17). Thus, the legend continued that Olmstead would not let even the Federal government interfere with his booming business, however illegal the transactions.<br>
<br>
The court battle continued and ended in "March 1926 when Roy Olmstead was fined 8000 dollars and sentenced to four years at hard labor"(Clark 17). It was not until March of 1927 that Olmstead demanded the issue of the wire taps be reviewed by the courts as an invasion of privacy. "The United States Supreme Court agreed to review Olmstead's case and whether the use of evidence of private telephone conversations was unconstitutional"(Clark 17).<br>
<br>
The New York Times reported the case on page one when the Supreme Court ruled that evidence from wire taps could indeed be used in court. The New York Times complained that the Supreme Court's decision would "make universal snooping possible"(Lyon 1a). With
the courts decision came the end of another smuggling career with Olmstead serving his time at McNiel Island Federal Prison. The case served to illustrate the growing problems with prohibition and its enforcement.<br>
<br>
There was growing public opinion that prohibition should be repealed, however, that would take several more years. But, Roy Olmstead, a Seattle bootlegger was the first to seriously challenge the unpopular policy.<br>
<br>
The last smuggler I want to discuss in this paper was by no means the most well known, or the best. Howard Elmer Fisher was caught several times in Port Angeles for smuggling Canadian whiskey. Yet despite his shortcomings, he was the reason I wanted to research smuggling in Puget Sound because he was my great grandfather. I started my research in his hometown of Port Angeles Washington where on a clear day you can see across the Straits of Juan de Fuca to the source of Canadian whiskey, Vancouver Island.<br>
<br>
The records I found were enlightening to say the least. The first thing I found was that he had an uncle by the name Frank Fisher who was the Customs Officer for the port of Port Angeles. This was the same man responsible for ensuring ships had the proper registry and had paid the necessary fees for cargo. Thus I discovered an early conflict in the chosen profession of his nephew Howard Elmer Fisher, a bootlegger.<br>
<br>
I discovered two court records pertaining to Howard Elmer Fisher, both for bootlegging Canadian whiskey. The second violation states that Howard Fisher was fined 100 dollars,  which he paid promptly, and appeared in  court the following week. This court record was dated November 15 1926 and goes on to say that the defendant never made his court appearance and thus forfeited any chance of getting any of his money back. The Port Angeles Evening News reported, on November 18 1926,  that Howard Fisher forfeited his bail to the Clallum County sheriff by failing to appear in court.<br>
<br>
Howard Fisher smuggled rum for two years and at the same time  used the mail boat, which he worked aboard, to run the rum into Port Angeles past his uncle working the customs house and into town for dispensing. This caused considerable strain on family relations, according to his daughter(and my grandmother) Joanne Matson, she related the following story to me about one smuggling incident that "had been talked about while she was growing up."<br>
<br>
The Port Angeles public dock during the mid 1920s had an area set aside for seized contraband. In this particular case the items on the dock were barrels of Canadian whiskey. Howard Fisher took his small boat and rowed under the dock at high tide. Then he proceeded down the dock until he was directly under the barrels of seized whiskey.<br>

By using a hand drill he was able to tap the barrels and empty its illegal contents into his waiting barrels on the rowboat. According to my source, this was  successful several times until Howard Fisher started to make his own smuggling runs into Canadian waters for larger profits.<br>
<br>
The authorities finally caught up  with Howard Fisher. However  he never served time in jail, as he left Washington state with the merchant marine and took up residence in California. The bootlegger may have been forced out of Port Angeles by his own uncle, who would later be promoted, and who retired as the senior customs agent in Port Angeles.<br>
<br>
The smugglers profiled thus far all used maritime traffic as their mode of smuggling goods over the Canadian and United States border. I should  note that there was a large demand for smuggling "Prohibition Brew"(Fish 198) through the use of domestic stills. In the fall of 1929 one family member recalls "the Christmas the still blew up"(Palmer 25). Although the profits for such home distilleries were high, imprisonment and physical damage to the home were not unusual.<br>
<br>
The home brew usually consisted of various fruits mixed with sugar and yeast to create a "mash that should stand seven to eight days and then run the mixture through the still to condense into a high alcohol liquid"(Fish 198) that was then suitable for distribution through the smugglers various methods.<br>
<br>
Thus, the origin of the contraband sometimes varied but the smuggling conducted within the Puget Sound region fell to an individual or a group of individuals who  smuggled goods in hopes of making a profit without getting into trouble with the law. The line between the criminal and the enforcer of federal laws was not always clear with human greed muddying the proverbial water of justice.<br>
<br>
The Volstead Act was enacted to try and enforce a standard for moral conduct. The failure of prohibition placed the standard of morality  in the private realm and not that of the federal government. Only history can judge the impact the bootlegger had on the eventual failure of prohibition. The fact remains that the market for illegal  liquor was large enough to warrant the activity of the bootlegger which in itself is a symptom of societal morality.<br>

LAWRENCE KELLY<br>
<br>
Marge Davenport, "Irishman most famous smuggler, " <B>Afloat and Awash in the Old Northwest.</B> Tigard, Oregon: Paddlewheel Press, 1988, p. 129-131.<br>
<br>
For more than 20 years, Lawrence Kelly, a genial Irishman and the most famous smuggler in Northwest history, led officers a merry chase.<br>
<br>
Kelly, who made his home on Sinclair Island in the San Juans, was a skillful sailor.  He had one of the fastest sloops in the San Juans and he knew every channel and reef.<br>
<br>
It was reported that Kelly's operations ranged from Alaska to Hawaii, but he evidently enjoyed most the chases that he gave officials as he carried opium, liquor and Chinese from Canadian Ports through the maze of island and reefs to Puget Sound points.<br>
<br>
The San Juan islands are located ideally for smuggling.  They are between two countries where the prices of commodities often were much higher in one than the other, and where restrictions varied radically, and there was great inducement to evade customs and immigration officials.<br>
<br>
Probably the first real illegal activity in the San Juan hole-
in-the-wall came before Kelly got into business.  It was in wool when wool was cheap in Canada and comparatively high in the States.<br>
<br>
For all appearances, it was wool raised on San Juan Island, but if it was there must have been "supersheep" because one farmer shipped more than 30 tons of wool to Port Townsend in one year from his few head of sheep.  At the time, wool was bought on Vancouver Island at 10 or 12 cents a pound and sold in Port Townsend for 30 cents a pound.<br>
<br>
When the San Juan Islands were put under the American flag in 1872, the smuggling business picked up.  The contraband became opium and Chinese.  The profit margin also increased.<br>
<br>
Kelly, who was a veteran of the Civil War, came west about this time, married and settled on Sinclair Island in 1877.  Shortly thereafter, he went into the smuggling business, and for the next 20 years he made it a battle of wits with customs and immigration officials and the U.S. Coast Guard.<br>
<br>
At first, the custom authorities were rather pathetically equipped to catch smugglers.  They started out in rowboats, then they got a
steam-propelled boat that traveled about 4 miles per hour.  This was known to the smugglers as the "Black Pup." Later, when they obtained speedier boats, these often were lured onto reefs by the wily Kelly and wrecked.<br>
<br>
The standard fare for putting a Chinese on U.S. soil in the 1800's was $50.  There were lurid tales about smuggling that tell of Chinese being thrown overboard in weighted wool sacks to drown when the Coast Guard threatened, but Kelly always emphatically denied that he ever drowned any of his human contraband.  He did admit to some of his friends that if officials threatened he sometimes simply put back to Vancouver Island and landed the unlucky Chinese there, letting them believe they were now in the United States.  Not even a Chinese could tell the difference on a dark, rainy night.<br>
<br>
Because he knew the islands so well, and had many well disguised secret coves and hiding places, there were many stories that still persist about Kelly's escapades.  His friends said Kelly really enjoyed the excitement and the smuggling game and considered it a battle of wits.  Those who knew him well added that he took good care of his family, loved to have friends over and make clam chowder for them and enjoyed social gatherings.  To officials, though, he was a desperado and a terror.<br>
<br>
After chasing Kelly over the years and never catching him, the local officials finally admitted themselves defeated and asked for help.  A Treasury Department expert, famed for running down smugglers in the East, was dispatched, and Kelly finally was caught.  He pleaded guilty in May, 1909, and spent a year at the Federal Penitentiary on McNeil's Island.  When he was released he was about 60 years old and he said he would go straight the rest of his life.<br>
<br>
But he found the going tough.  He was admitted later to a Confederate Soldier's Home, where he died.<br>
<br>
Another famous San Juan smuggler was Victor McConnell, who had McConnell's Island named for him.  He, too, knew the local waters well.  McConnell's specialty was Chinese, and he had a fast boat.  When he finally gave up the smuggling business, he opened a filling station near Seattle.<br>
<br>
When prohibition was passed, other smuggling gave way to rum-running.  This was an even more hazardous occupation because, by then, the Coast Guard had faster boats that were well-armed.  The rum-runners had speedy boats, too, and they used all the islands in their games.  There were dozens of hiding places used for caches of liquor enroute to Seattle and other points.  Most rum-runners operated in connection with a big ring in Seattle that used meat and vegetable trucks for deliveries for years.<br>
<br>
Rum-running flourished until the repeal of prohibition.  Today, customs and immigration officials keep a tight check on boats moving between Canadian and American ports and occasionally there is a report of some smuggling activity, but the colorful days of
smuggling in Puget Sound along with those who were actors in the drama of contraband have passed.<br>

But he found the going tough.  He was admitted later to a Confederate Soldier's Home, where he died.<br>
<br>
Another famous San Juan smuggler was Victor McConnell, who had McConnell's Island named for him.  He, too, knew the local waters well.  McConnnell's speciality was Chinese, and he had a fast boat.  When he finally gave up the smuggling business, he opened a filling station near Seattle.<br>
<br>
When prohibition was passed, other smuggling gave way to rum-running.  This was an even more hazardous occupation because, by then, the Coast Guard had faster boats that were well-armed.  The rum-runners had speedy boats too, and they used all the islands in
their games.  There were dozens of hiding places used for caches of liquor enroute in Seattle and other points.  Most rum-runners operated in connection with a big ring in Seattle that used meat and vegetable trucks for deliveries for years.<br>
<br>
Rum-running flourished until the repeal of prohibition.  Today, customs and immigration officials keep a tight check on boats moving between Canadian and American ports and occasionally there is a report of some smuggling activity, but the colorful days of smug-
gling in Puget Sound along with those who were actors in the drama of contraband have passed.<br>

<br>
A remarkable feat of navigation, though one looked upon without enthusiasm by Canadian authorities, was accomplished in July with the arrival at Bella Bella, B. C. of a 60 foot Japanese sampan.  Eleven Japanese were put ashore by the captain, who immediately put to sea again.  The small fishing craft, with 27 men aboard, had come from Japan in 70 days, the only navigating equipment being an ancient compass, merely a needle balanced on an upright pivot, and a six - inch - square map of North America.<br>
<br>
The skipper told Bella Bella villagers that he was bound for Alaska and thence back to Japan "looking for herring." Eight of the sampan's passengers were picked up by immigration officials when they arrived at Vancouver by steamer, and held for deportation.<br>
<br>
They said they had paid the sampan skipper from $ 50 to $ 100 each to bring them across the Pacific and land them somewhere near Seattle.  The William Jolliffe was dispatched to search for the wayward sampan, but there is no record of its ever having been apprehended. Gordon Newell, Maritime Events of 1913, H.W.

Printing Company, 1958. p. 234-253.<br>
<br>
I had heard the tales of smugglers and knew that the father of my school friends, Larry and Will Flanigan, had been a Customs Officer and with passing of time I learned more and more of some of the interesting events.  I heard so much about "Cowboy Jake Terry" that he was a living legend, a sinister one which kept cropping up from time to time until that day I joined the crowd to view his body, stretched out in the showcase of Gillies Swanson.  Now that I have looked up the record of those days<br>
<br>
I've found many details which had us puzzled at the time.  Some of the officers have been friends of mine and so I have been able with good fortune to put their stories together, to check one against the other and the records, thus revealing dramatic scenes and the thread of the stories which occasioned so much local rumor and conjecture.<br>
<br>
The coming of the railroads brought passenger and freight traffic and the beginning of large scale smuggling operations.  There was good money in smuggling Oriental silks.  Some stores in Whatcom and Seattle found it convenient to stock up on silks at attractive prices and not to question the manner of importation.  The large numbers of Orientals brought into Canada to work on the railroads required a steady flow of Oriental foodstuffs and other supplies.  One of the items desperately required there and among the Orientals in our country was opium.<br>
<br>
In the states, by the Tariff Act of 1897, there was a duty of six dollars per pound on smoking opium.  Crude opium was admitted at one dollar per pound; the sulphates and alkaloids, which included morphine, were dutiable at one dollar per ounce.  In 1909 the 61st Congress raised the duties about fifty per cent, but also, in response to an awakening public interest, passed an act prohibiting importation for other than medical purposes.<br>
<br>
There were large sections in some of our shipping centers occupied by Orientals and called "Chinatown".  On the Pacific Coast, Vancouver, B. C., Seattle and San Francisco had the largest numbers.  The demand for opium was very strong.  The Orientals risked their lives to get it.  The degenerate white, who was crafty enough to outwit or outrun the few Customs men at our borders, found a Bonanza in opium smuggling.<br>
<br>
The smuggling in of Chinese nationals themselves was another source of revenue.  Sumas was in a position destined to be the scene of much smuggling activity.  We, who lived in town, heard many rumors but the long thread of the stories, buried, as they needed to tell in official discretion, only came out when one of the actors in the drama was caught or met his end.<br>
<br>
Now, the message of time makes possible the recounting of some of these interesting events.
Laurence J. Flanigan, always known locally as "Larry", was our first U. S. Customs officer, serving from 1891 to 1897.  He must have been making it pretty hot for some of the early smugglers.<br>
<br>
One day he boarded the train at Sumas and after checking passengers and baggage thoroughly on the way to Wickersham, he ordered the conductor to hold the train a few minutes while he checked the undercarriages.  He had received confidential information that a shipment of opium was aboard.  When he saw a package tucked in over the trucks he grasped it eagerly and ran to the freight shed.<br>
<br>
"Well, I've got the dope!" he confided breathlessly to the station agent as he cut and tore the many wrappings to get into the box.  It didn't lift or shake like five tael tins, the usual container for smoking opium.  Maybe it was gum opium and then again, maybe it was morphine.  As the wrapping fell aside, Larry's hands shook with excitement.  At last he got down to the shoe box, opened the lid and found ' - a box of horse manure.<br>
<br>
Larry turned the tables just a few months later.  "Cowboy" jake Terry had come to Sumas to operate early in the nineties.  For about fifteen years he was to pester Customs men, during the times when he was out of jail.  He was quite a slicker and always believed he could outsmart any man he could not intimidate or buy off.  He was a great teller of stories and made himself right at home in any company.<br>
<br>
Terry had been using an old logging road, back on Barker Hill to get his stuff across the line.  Sometimes he used trails east of town or the Telegraph Road.  Once across, he carried opium in suitcases or a blanket roll or had a confederate do it for him.<br>
<br>
Then he could board the train as a passenger at Clearbrook or Nooksack and thus outwit the Customs men.  For a number of years Larry Flanigan held down the office alone.  An additional man was added later and an Immigration Inspector detailed to work under the local Deputy Collector of Customs.<br>
<br>
One night Jake had a load and hung around the Customs House talking to Larry to get the lay of the land.  He confided that, since the trails were dry, he wouldn't mind taking the back road route so as not to embarrass Flanigan.<br>
<br>
"I'll be coming through after midnight and nobody will know the difference, Larry.  You might as well get a good sleep.  You could sure use a little sleep better than a slug of lead in your guts, couldn't you?"<br>
<br>
"Ye-ah.  I could use a little sleep, but about that other, sometimes lead flies both ways."<br>
<br>
In the evening Larry sauntered around town, spent a little time in
a card game at the "U.S.", then went down to the Mount Baker bar.  There he saw Schumacher and accepted his invitation to have a glass of beer.  When the barkeep was out of listening range, Larry spoke quietly.<br>
<br>
"Schu, I've got a job to do tonight and I'm going to have help.  I've got a right under the law, to deputize any citizen when I have reason to believe that a felony is going to be committed and I need assistance.  I'm deputizing you as a Customs Officers for tonight and I want you to meet me about fifty rods south of the roundhouse at one o'clock and be double dam sure nobody sees you getting there.<br>
<br>
Make a wide circle, bring your six shooter.  I don't want to be seen talking to you any more tonight.  See you fifty rods south, be sure!"<br>
<br>
Larry went home, fussed around a bit, blew out the light and instead of going to bed, went out the back door, trailing his shotgun.  He hit for the ferns back of his place, crouched and waited to see if he could spot the skulking form of Jake Terry coming around for the check-up. Jake didn't show in the next half hour so Larry took off, walking west of town, crossing the bridge by the mill, then back on the creekside trail.<br>
<br>
One o'clock found him in position on the track and Schumacher came puffing up from the road to the east.<br>
<br>
The two men planned their work together.  Larry was sure that Jake took him for a sucker and believed that he would take a trail.  Instead, Larry figured that Jake was going to come down the railroad track with a handcar, catching the law off balance.<br>
<br>
The officers "borrowed" a speeder from the roundhouse and then went far down the track to the first gentle curve and when<br>
out of sight of the straightaway they blocked the speeder and went back a short distance toward town and waited.<br>
<br>
Occasionally Larry went up on the tracks, dropped to his knees and put his ear to the steel rail.  In an hour or so he heard the first faint rumble.  It grew louder and louder and in a few minutes they could hear it while standing up.  Then the sound revealed that it was a heavy laden handcar grinding away on the rails as it rolled south.<br>
<br>
When the travelers were near enough to see by the cloudy night that there was an obstruction across the track, there arose a lot of sharp cackling of Chinese voices and the voice of Jake Terry.  "Shut up, you yellow bellied fools!"<br>
<br>
just then two men rose from the grade at the side, ran alongside the handcar, with shotgun and pistol trained on Terry.
"Hands up, you all! Federal officers! Jake Terry, you're under arrest," yelled Flanigan.  "As soon as the car stops I want you to step out in front.  Keep your hands up!"<br>
<br>
Flanigan must have done a first class job, for Jake Terry, often called "Terrible Terry", who had the reputation as a cold killer, didn't even get his gun in hand.  He was manacled as soon as the car stopped rolling.  His load of four Chinese were docile coolies who accepted the will of the gods fatalistically.  They cheerfully pumped the handcar back to town, towing the speeder after them.<br>
<br>
Schumacher got the marshal out of bed and the five culprits were locked up in the city jail.  After due process, Terry the wise guy, went to San Quentin for another jail stretch.<br>
<br>
About three years previous to this incident, another Jake Terry episode had occurred.  It took place near the towns of Sedro and Woolley, the two places later becoming the present town of Sedro-Woolley.<br>
<br>
The Bellingham Bay Express, on July 28, 1891, printed the following interesting account of the battle in the woods.<br>
<br>
"One Man Killed, Another Wounded.<br>
Deputy Sheriff Poor, of Seattle, Is the Dead Man.<br>
Cowboy Terry Is Not Expected to Live."<br>
<br>
"Sunday night, about eleven o'clock, a tragedy occurred about one and a half miles from Woolley . . . Sunday morning Inspector Beard, of Seattle, telegraphed Collector Reilly (New Whatcom) that a party of Chinamen had been smuggled across the border near Sumas and asked that an inspector be sent on from here to meet him in Sedro and help with the case."<br>
<br>
"Inspector Buchanan was accordingly ordered to the scene of action and lie and Beard went to work to locate the contraband Mongolians.  During the afternoon they located the road that was to be used and, after dark, went out there and sat down in the bushes to wait for the smugglers."<br>
<br>
"About eleven they heard a band of men coming and, as they came opposite, Beard stepped out in the road and found in front of him a band of about fifteen Chinamen, accompanied by either two or three white men."<br>
<br>
"To the command of 'halt' the white man in the lead replied that he was a Deputy United States Marshal and was taking the Chinamen to Seattle as prisoners.  He also displayed his badge as proof."<br>
<br>
"Beard considered this a ruse and ordered the man to throw up his hands.  Which one reached for his gun first is a disputed question, but one thing is sure, they both got them out and both fired, Beard's shot striking the supposed smuggler in the body and killing
him instantly."<br>
<br>
"About this time the other white man had got his gun into action, and Buchanan had also appeared on the scene and opened fire.  A shot from the second smuggler's gun whistled through Beard's hair scraping his scalp in a manner that was impressive, but a moment later the smuggler fell with a bullet in the groin, and the battle was over."<br>
<br>
"In the meantime the Chinese had . . . scattered in all directions and not one has been seen since."<br>
<br>
"The dead <B> man </B>and his wounded companion were taken to Woolley.  There it was shown that the dead man was Poor, a (deputy sheriff <B>and deputy </B>U. S. Marshal of Seattle, while the wounded man proved  to be Terry, who has had charge of the Kellytown townsite near that place.<br>
<br>
He was found to be dangerously wounded and the doctor says it is impossible for him to live.  His ante-mortem deposition was taken.  In it he stated that, hearing of the smuggling of the Chinamen, he had telegraphed Sheriff Woolery of King County, that if he had assistance he thought he could capture them.  In reply to this Woolery had sent on Poor and another man named Holden.<br>
<br>
The three of them had captured the Chinamen and were taking them to Woolley where they were to be put in a box car and taken under guard to Seattle."<br>
<br>
"Next morning . . . Holden was also arrested.  The coroner's jury returned a verdict of manslaughter against Buchanan and Beard, who were at once taken into custody."<br>
<br>
"Holden claims he came on ahead to make arrangements with the railroad officials for a car . . ." (He had witnesses to say he was drinking beer in a saloon at the time of the shooting.)<br>
<br>
"Sheriff Woolery was telegraphed and he came to Woolley last evening and at once went to view the dead man, though how he has expressed himself is not yet known."<br>
<br>
"The men must have had iron nerves as the shooting was started at such close quarters that their guns were almost touching each other, and the shot which killed Poor went right through his body and was found in the back of his coat."<br>
<br>
"People who afterward visited the scene of the shooting say that the fusillade must have been terrible . . . Later developments go to show that the shooting was not much of a mistake, but will be the means of breaking up a big smuggling combine."<br>
<br>
"Sheriff Woolery says that Poor had asked leave of absence, but he did not know where he was going.  Holden, who is an Inspector of
Customs, left Seattle without authority and Terry, the third man of the party, bears a reputation that is not altogether as savory as it might be.  He has served several times in jail, has been separated from his wife, whom he treated so badly that news of his approaching death caused her to smile, and he has been <B>more </B>or less mixed up in rascality all his life."<br>
<br>
"There is an air of mystery surrounding the whole affair Inspector Beard is a Seattle man, but was formerly a policeman at Blaine (border town), where he had worked with Inspector Buchanan.  Both are known as reliable men and good officers.<br>
<br>
Poor, the man who was killed, was known in Seattle, where he lived, as a whole-souled genial, honest man.  He was an enthusiastic member of Seattle Chapter No. 3, Royal Arch Masons, and belonged to the First Baptist Church.  He has been a prominent figure in Seattle society.<br>
<br>
For a time he was steward of the Olympian and was afterwards appointed Customs Inspector, but did not retain his position long.  Last year he started in the jewelry business and remained at that till Sheriff Woolery was elected, when he was appointed deputy."<br>
<br>
The Express on 'July 30, 1891, carried more news under the headline, "Both Men Go Free".<br>
<br>
"Beard and Buchanan Are Discharged From Custody.  The Evidence Shows They Acted in Good Faith."<br>
<br>
"Inspector Holden's Resignation Demanded in 24 Hours."<br>
<br>
"Woolley has attracted More Attention in the Last Few Days than any place in tlie Sound Country . . ."<br>
<br>
"The preliminary examination of Beard and Buchanan took place yesterday.  Both gave their evidence frankly and in straightforward manner.  Both swore that Beard had called upon the Chinamen and their escort to surrender three times, and the answer they got was three shots in quick succession.  Then all blazed away.  Beard fired his last shot before Poor fell.  He then rushed up to him and in stooping over to feel his face, rubbed off his false whiskers."<br>
<br>
"Terry testified that he had no revolver, and that the Inspector fired first, but his character is such that his evidence carried no weight with the court.  When Holden saw Beard after the shooting he had on a different hat from the one he wore when he came to Woolley and Beard claims that if his first hat can be found, it will have some mark on it to show that he was in the fight.<br>
<br>
Deputy Collector Alexander testified that Holden  had not acted under instructions, and another witness swore that Terry was a smuggler."<br>

"This is the evidence and after the attorney's got in their work, Justice J.Y. Terry said it was apparent to him that the defendants<br>
had acted in good faith.  He dismissed both.  As the last words were spoken by the justice, a loud shout of applause went up from the crowded hall and Beard and Buchanan were congratulated by everyone who could get near them."<br>
<br>
"Terry is lying between life and death, with no very pleasant prospect before him.  He will either die or go to jail as a smuggler."<br>
<br>
Collector Bradshaw, head of the Customs district, with headquarters in Port Townsend, had demanded the resignation of Holden when he came to Woolley to investigate.  Later, from his Port Townsend office, he demanded the resignation of Beard, also, on the ground that Beard was spying on the activities of another officer without notifying the Collector of his activities.  Deputy Collector Reilly, however, who sent help to Beard, on request, was the direct representative of the Collector in the Whatcom area.<br>
<br>
On the same day that the above news was released, the Express announced the appointment of Thomas Hopp, publisher of the Sumas Index, as a Customs Inspector.<br>
<br>
In 1897, S. P. Conner succeeded Flanigan and had as assistant, Inspector Stenger, who had to spend part of his time in Whatcom.  During this time Jake Terry was planning his future in San Quentin prison but there were plenty of others on the scene.  "Cap" Conner had a flair for getting into local politics and drew bitter criticism and perhaps a bit of "framing" from his opposition.<br>
<br>
He aired his resentment and made counter charges in a series of pamphlets which he called "Kum-tux I, II and III." At any rate, as a federal officer in politics, he was vulnerable and was succeeded by Deputy Collector Lockbaum in 1905.  At that time there were three major smuggling rings, known to be operating at Sumas, Blaine, and the salt water routes of the sound, from Canada.<br>
<br>
There were two officers rating Deputy Collector at Sumas in 1903 the U. S. Immigration Service began to function as a separate organization and they occupied the new Immigration Station, built at the boundary line west of the N.P. Depot.  Sumas was the designated Chinese Port of Entry.  With a force of thirteen men, one a Chinese interpreter, the new federal men were integrated into the community.<br>
<br>
Shortly after the opening of the station a band of about forty Hindoos were being led across the line, at night, on a trail back on Barker Hill.  At the bottom of the trail, where it joined the settlers' road on the south side, the Immigration men were waiting.  George Manning, the Immigration Guard, had his hands full that night.  The barred windows of the station framed interesting faces,
mostly oriental, Chinese, Hindoos, occasional Japanese and Russian, and sometimes for temporary safe keeping, the smugglers caught by the Customs men.<br>
<br>
The newspapers of the area found some choice items in the happenings at Sumas.  One of the most bizarre incidents which drew keen public curiosity at the time was a murder mystery which occurred right under the noses of the Immigration Officers, and in fact, within the Immigration Detention Station.<br>
<br>
Included among the detainees at the station had been one Chinese dignitary, named Li Wing Wah.  Li had a beautiful wife who was detained with him.  They occupied a room together.  She well might have been a Chinese princess or a scion of one of the most honored families in China.  She had a graciousness that aroused interest among all who saw her.  Her education     had been broad and she spoke excellent English.  Her tiny feet, incased in jeweled slippers, and her exquisitely embroidered and fitted silk garments added to her charm.<br>
<br>
To pass away the time while awaiting entry requirements,<br>
she made excellent translations of various Chinese letters and labels for the immigration people.  But for all her education and elegant bearing the word got out that she was, in reality, <B>only </B>a slave girl, having been acquired by the elder Li for his comfort and companionship, or possibly to be turned over to another merchant prince once he entered the United States.<br>
<br>
Imagine, if you can, the consternation that filled the Immigration Station and which gave oriental mystery headlines to the papers, when on a morning early in 1908 the morning check of the detainees disclosed the beautiful girl lying lifeless on the floor of the cell, her throat opened by a terrible slashing with a razor.<br>
<br>
The people of the county waited with consuming curiosity, and a degree of horror, for the story detailing the motive, and any possible defense by Li Wing Wah.<br>
<br>
On June 3, 1908, Li was found guilty of murder and condemned to death but he uttered no words to defend himself or explain away the mystery.  He "saved face" as much as he could by refusing to release whatever tale of anguish he might have had in his breast.  The story hung suspended, a thing of endless wondering, but the public learned no more.<br>
<br>
On one fine summer day Mrs. George Handley and daughter, Myrtle, hurried to get their housework done and then set off to go blackberry picking with Mrs. Albert Stell and Walter.  The little wild blackberries were prized highly and the picking provided enjoyable outings in mid summer.  On this occasion they walked out the road, east of Sumas River, to the vicinity of McClure's place, near the boundary line.
As they trudged along happily they were alarmed at seeing a group of men get up hastily from the fern beds along the bank of the stream.  Their fears mounted when they saw the pigtail queues of Orientals.  Some of the men ran for cover in the bush  others stood cynically.  There appeared to be about a dozen.  The berry pickers turned and ran back down the road for home.  Berry picking would have to await another day.<br>
<br>
Fred F. Strickling was an accountant who had lived in South Dakota.  He came to Seattle and took the Civil Service examination for the position of U. S. Customs Appraiser.  He had no thought of, or ambition to become an enforcement officer.  He made an enviable grade in the test, but instead of getting the appointment in Seattle, he was asked to go to Sumas for a "temporary assignment".<br>
<br>
There he found himself on a job where he was expected to put in a day of routine work and to spend many nights hiding on trails, looking for dangerous outlaws.  For a man of purely academic interests his role here was far from his choice.  When Deputy Collector Samuel P. Conner handed him a service pistol he considered turning back his badge.  Then he decided he would give it a try but he would leave his firearms at home.<br>
<br>
This worked all right, for a smuggler would not suspect that the officer had no firearm.  With no flash of weapon there was no provocation.  But he had some narrow squeezes.  Take the time Fred and Harry Blee were waiting on a dark night at the bridge at Clear brook.  The smuggler appeared in the early morning hours carrying a heavy suitcase.  As he walked across the bridge the officers stepped out.  Strickling said, "Stop, you are under arrest!"<br>
<br>
The fellow stepped back and coolly surveyed the situation.  "Under what authority?" he said cautiously while stalling.<br>
<br>
Strickling showed his badge, "U.  S. Customs," he said.  "We'll go over there on the porch of that store where there's a light and we'll open the suitcase for inspection."<br>
<br>
As they walked over, the smuggler became cooperative, anxious to talk and to open his baggage.  Before he got the straps off, Fred was convinced there was something wrong.  "No, fellow," he said,<br>
<br>
"I'll open that myself.  You stand over there by that officer."<br>
As the lid came open the first thing apparent was a loaded automatic pistol.  Under it he had forty-five pounds of opium.  Back at the detention station the prisoner became bitter.  He told Fred, "If I could have gotten that pistol, there would have been two funerals instead of me going to McNeil."<br>
<br>
On one quiet day Fred went out to check on a smuggler's trail a couple of miles east of town.  It led across a marshy place near the
border, where there was a footlog.  Fred walked the log and as he reached the far side he steadied himself by placing his hand on a tree trunk. just then there was a sharp thud by his fingers and lie heard the bark of a rifle behind him.  A high powered bullet had passed through the tree by the tips of his spread fingers.<br>
<br>
One aspect of the border which added to the enforcement difficulty was the way the boldest smugglers worked on the train men.  Some were bribed to keep quiet, others were fearful.  One railway mail clerk, a postal employs, was discovered to be actually abetting the activities of a notorious smuggler.<br>
<br>
While Conner was still in charge, in February of 1905, he had his men, Lockbaum and Strickling, with the support of Immigration Inspectors Pink and George Manning out, making a maximum effort to catch the persistent smuggler, Larry Kelley.<br>
<br>
Kelley shifted his operations along the border and, when running Chinese, used a power boat.  He was reputed to be one of the first runners who used the swift and boiling waters of Deception Pass.  He boasted that he had a system for getting rid of his human cargo in case he was overtaken by a Coast Guard cutter.  Some said that he carried them in weighted sacks, sewed up at the neck, ready to be rolled over the side.<br>
<br>
Kelley had been caught in 1887 while smuggling four thousand dollars worth of opium and at that time served two years in the penitentiary.<br>
<br>
Again in March of 1891 he had been captured on a train between Tacoma and Portland, by Treasury Agent C. J. Mulkey and Inspector C. B. Cox.  He had in his possession 65 five-tael tins of the finest Tai Yune opium.  The opium had been processed and packed by the manufacturer at Victoria, B. C., and was sold at Victoria for $8.00 per pound.<br>
<br>
He had used his four-ton sloop to transport the contraband to a point near Olympia, then he hiked overland and boarded the train at Tenino, but little did he expect to find that treasury men were already aboard.<br>
<br>
A short time previously he had been fined $200 by the Canadians for not properly clearing his vessel.  When the Canadians pointed out that the American officers were likely to catch him he ha(l made a remark which was the cause of many a wry smile along the border.<br>
<br>
"No - - - - - of a Customs House Officer will ever take me."<br>
<br>
On this dark February night the federal men were spotted at various points.  Strickling rode the engine from Sumas and kept out of sight at Nooksack.  However, from his spot of concealment, he was sure he saw an active man with heavy suitcases going toward the train when
it came to a stop.<br>
<br>
When they pulled out of the station Fred asked the engineer if any passengers came aboard.  "Oh, I think there was some old man, farm hand, no doubt." At Deming when the train started up again, Fred boarded the first coach and soon spotted the conductor.  "Yes, I think there was one at Nooksack.  Some old fellow.  I haven't been back there yet.  He's in one of the rear coaches."<br>
<br>
Strickling started to walk through as the train pulled out of the station.  He took it slowly as the train gained headway, then continued more briskly, checking every face and hiding place.  When he came to the last car he spotted Kelley and walked quickly to his seat.<br>
<br>
"Open up your baggage for inspection, Mr. Kelley," said Fred, showing his badge.  Kelly got up and tried to walk out in the aisle.  "I don't know as I have to," he said.<br>
<br>
"If you don't open it, I'll examine it, as unclaimed, and if you're wrong I'll hold it and you, too," said Fred.  He turned to get a good look at the two heavy suitcases, heard a shuffle behind him, then ran to catch the fleeing Kelley but failed to grasp him until he reached the platform and jumped.<br>
<br>
Strickling pulled the emergency cord and the train slowed down.  The conductor came puffing into the coach.  Fred had checked the suitcases and found them loaded with opium, one hundred twenty tins, his count later showed.  He ordered the conductor to stop the train and to back up to the point where the passenger jumped.<br>
<br>
As the train reached the spot the officer saw his man lying prone in the cinders.  He jumped off and finding that Kelley was unconscious, took the occasion to shackle his arms behind him and to remove from his pocket a .41 caliber Colt pistol.  He had no sooner done this than Kelley revived and looked around.<br>
<br>
Kelley was a sight.  He had hit on his feet, off balance, then bounced on his head so violently that his head and one shoulder plowed into the cinders.  The black, *egged bits of cinder had<br>
torn his face and shoulders and were imbedded in the flesh and under the skin.<br>
<br>
They got him back aboard the train.  Strickling deputized Harry Vanderhoof, the mill man, to assist him with the prisoner.  He ordered the conductor to back up to Deming.  The station agent phoned a local doctor who got out of bed and came down to pick out as much of the cinders as he could see and feel on the gory man, beneath the torn flesh.  He packed the head to stop the bleeding.<br>
<br>
The men took the next train back to Sumas, plus one notorious prisoner and one hundred twenty tins of refined opium.  Arrived at the home station, they locked Kelley up in the Immigration strong
room, by permission of Edsell, the Immigration Inspector in charge.  Then Strickling called Doctor Clark.  Clark dug more gravel and cinders out and Kelley pleaded for whiskey.<br>
<br>
Clark warned him that whiskey could easily kill him since he might have concussion.  If he drank whiskey it would be his own election and not prescribed.  Kelley wanted whiskey and he wanted something to eat.  Strickling looked piteously at the wretched creature and Kelley felt he had a friend.<br>
<br>
"Ye-ah, go ahead, officer.  Get me a bottle of whiskey and something to eat."<br>
<br>
Strickling knew there would be no question of recompense, for Kelley had in a wallet on his person at the time of search eight hundred fifty dollars in gold.<br>
<br>
Fred went across the line to the Huntingdon Hotel and then to the U. S. Saloon and soon came back with a roast duck and a bottle of whiskey.<br>
<br>
Lockbaum and Strickling called next day to take their prisoner down to Bellingham for arraignment before U. S. Commissioner H. B. Williams.  As George Manning, the Immigration Guard, opened the door, Lockbaum said, "How have they been treating you since you have been in custody, Kelley?"<br>
<br>
"Never was treated better in my life," he said.<br>
<br>
Occasional incidents broke the routine around the station.  Railroad men rarely gave any information but one day as Strickling walked through a baggage car the conductor came in, hesitated a moment at the side of the officer and murmured, "take a good look at that dog."<br>
<br>
A lady passenger had crossed the border on other occasions.  This time she brought with her a large shaggy haired dog.  He was tethered in the baggage car and he was scratching continually.  Fred took the leash and led him into the customs office where he and Lockbaum began the examination.<br>
<br>
The itching proved to come from some razor slits in the skin of the back of the dog.  Tucked beneath the skin was a shipment of large diamonds.<br>
<br>
On another occasion the conductor stopped in the coach aisle and curiously watched Fred taking out some screws from the side casing of a window.  "Well, officer, have you quit your usual job and are you now starting to work as a car repairman?"<br>
<br>
"Just wait a minute, conductor." When the casing came off there was revealed, in the double wall, forty neatly stacked tins of opium.<br>
Strickling the accountant, who had no yen for enforcement work, was a handy man to have around.  Being on temporary assignment, he could
<br>
be spared to go checking on rumors or he could be sent to a spot to stake out with instructions to come back when he had the answers.<br>
<br>
"Fred, I've got news for you," Lockbaum said one day.  "You know the reports we had about the trail crossing the border somewhere north and east of Mount Baker.  Well, now I've got a letter from the Collector,-says to send Strickling out, have him make a report on what's going on there.  You are to bring back prisoners if its a job one man can handle and if you catch them smuggling.  Otherwise, the Collector would like to know who is using the trail.  He says to send you during a quiet period at Sumas.  Well, this is as quiet as any, right now, anyway, so you might as well get camping gear together and prepare to stay a week, if necessary."<br>
<br>
Fred got his outfit together, hired a horse and set out early next morning.  Confidential reports indicated the trail was regularly used, crossed tlie boundary, running diagonally to the southeast from the origin southeast of Cultus Lake.<br>
<br>
Not too many trails led off the Mount Baker county road and Fred had a few landmarks to go by.  There was Church Mountain, which stuck up like a sore thumb, and there was Tommyhoy.  Having started early, noon found him on the trail.  As lie neared the boundary he tethered his horse and walked on along the side of the trail so as to conceal his footprints.<br>
<br>
The trail led on for several miles, with no indication as to its utility.  An occasional pony track revealed that it was used by pack horses, that was all.  In a spruce and hemlock shaded ravine he passed along a tumbling little stream.  Suddenly there was a different smell in the woods and he peered cautiously ahead with every step.<br>
<br>
Then he saw the roof of a cabin.  No doubt there would be a dog to sound warning.  Fred tested the wind direction and listened for any sound.  He saw no smoke.  By inching along he felt he would soon have the answer and he could still withdraw.<br>
<br>
Next to appear was a contraption in the creek and a long bed of freshly worked gravel. it was evidently a gold rocker, but what could it be doing on a smuggler's trail? Fred stood for many long minutes, waiting for a sound.  There was no dog, no horse, so not likely any sleeping men.  He went forward with great caution, finally stood inside the cabin.  There was no smell of moonshine mash, no evidence of imported goods.  It looked more like a blacksmith shop than anything else.  There was a small furnace which looked like it was used for reducing ore.<br>
<br>
Strickling looked on in amazement.  He looked back at the prospector's cradle in the creek.  If this was a gold mine, why the secrecy@ All was quiet in the timber.  The operators were apparently-on a trip to town.  He was in luck.
He went further inside and on a bench, near the furnace, he saw some kind of a mold.  It appeared to be a mint.  By looking closely he saw the clear imprint of a U. S. twenty dollar coin and a similar ten dollar.  He gather up some clay, made a clay model, found a tobacco tin, placed his model inside, packed it gently with moss and set off back up the trail.<br>
<br>
Strickling's foray in the hills resulted in a hurried conference of American and Canadian officials.  The Canadians raided the place and arrested two operators.  An investigation followed.  The facts uncovered were that they had been successfully counterfeiting American money and placing it in circulation in Vancouver, B. C., where the spurious character was not recognized.<br>
<br>
There it found its way to the banks, which in turn, exchanged the coins with American banks.  In the states some of the coins had been detected.  The only way they were found was by weight, the counterfeited coins being heavier.  On test it was found that the spurious coins contained more gold than the American minted currency, since there was lacking the usual quantity of alloy.<br>
<br>
After weeks of study as to whether the men were punishable under Canadian law, the case was lost track of by the Sumas officers.  There was more pressing business for them.  The cat came back.<br>
Deputy Collector Lockbaum reported to Collector Clarence W.  Ide at his headquarters in Port Townsend in October of 1905: "Sir: One "Cowboy" Terry has been making his headquarters here for a number of months past and I am convinced . . ."<br>
<br>
Again in the spring of 1906, he wrote: "Sir: I learn from good authority that 'Jake (Cowboy) Terry is again on the coast, having arrived at New Westminster junction yesterday."<br>
<br>
In the Bellingham Reveille of July 17, 1906, under the heading: "Taken With the Dope on Him", was the following story:<br>
<br>
"A tall, dignified appearing and well dressed man, with iron gray hair, a black beard and shifty gray eyes, who gives his name as Thomas Morton.... was arrested at Mount Vernon by Customs Inspector George Hubbard, after a search of his baggage revealed eighty pounds of opium, valued at $1000.00. . . . Jake Terry, as in all smuggling cases, is reported to be one of the agents on the Canadian side."<br>
<br>
In the summer and fall of 1906 Jake Terry found a special personal interest in Sumas.  There was a fight about a woman.  A lot of public indignation arose when he threw Gus Linday out of his own house.  Finally he was arrested by the sheriff, but he was out on bail promptly and then made his headquarters in the Huntingdon Hotel, just across the boundary line.<br>
<br>
After he forfeited his bail there was a warrant out for his arrest but he was safe in Canada and he could come over to fight Gus Linday or shoot up the town, then go back across and laugh at the uproar.<br>
Frank Myers, the town marshal, was really on the spot.  He probably
<br>
could have caught Jake if he had tried hard enough.  The town was divided on whether or not Myers should take a hand.<br>
<br>
Terry was a smuggler and it was really up to the Customs Officers to catch him again.  Besides, as Frank's friends pointed out, Frank's house was on Harrison and very close to the boundary line.  He had a good wife and four or five children.  If Jake Terry found that Myers was going to try to arrest him, the house would surely go up in smoke some windy night, while Terry was prowling around.<br>
<br>
It wasn't a simple thing to take Jake.  He seemed to get wind of any plans to cause his downfall.  Besides the chances were pretty high that somebody would be killed.  Frank Myers received a salary of fifty-five dollars per month and the government was offering no reward for the apprehension of this federal law violator.<br>
<br>
Father shook his head, sadly,  "I  don't  know,  I  don't  know."<br>

SMUGGLING.<br>
<br>
"Smuggled celestials, a big bogus certificate scheme unearthed," <B>The Tacoma Daily Ledger.</B> May 6, 1891.<br>
<br>
Bradshaw's Deputy Suspected of Complicity and Suspended Pending Investigation - A Port Townsend Lawyer in the Toils - Chinese as Witnesses.<br>
<br>
The "big ring," whose operations in smuggling both Chinamen and opium into this country have long puzzled the customs officials, and whose "bosses" are supposed to be prominent citizens of this state, is on the verge of being entirely exposed to judge from present appearances.<br>
<br>
It is well known that of late the ring has transferrd its principal attention to the smuggling of Chinese across the border, but in what manner was unknown.  Treasury Agent Mulkey assisted by Inspector Coblentz, has been at work on the matter, for some months and have, they think, located the missing link of testimony.<br>
<br>
It appears that certain parties in Port Townsend have been engaged in the wholesale trade of preparing bogus certificates for Chinamen to return on and and sending them across to British Columbia to the purchasers.  With the "rings" usual foresight, it secured some catspaws in the customs service.<br>

Charles B. Wood, Collector Bradshaw's chief deputy, is strongly suspected to winking at the passage of Chinamen on bogus certificates.  A private dispatch from Port Townsend last night announced that he had been suspended pending a full investigation of the fraud.<br>
<br>
John Trumbull, a lawyer in Port Townsend, is accused of being the chief manufacturer of the certificates, and the same dispatch announces that he has been arrested.  The matter was brought to a focus Monday by Messrs. Mulkey and Coblenz arresting Yee Long and Wong-Uny-Sung on the City of Seattle when she landed here.<br>
<br>
The "Ledger" became aware of the fact, but agreed not to mention the case Tuesday, as the officials said the ends of justice would be served by saying nothing for a day or two.  Both of the Chinamen had certificates suspected of being false, but it now looks as if Yee Long is all right.<br>
<br>
The two Chinamen were detained in a room in the Brooklyn house Monday and Tuesday awaiting orders from Mulkey, who with Coblentz went to Port Townsend immediately after the arrest.  Chief of Police Ellis, acting under a mistaken impression, attempted to put the Chinamen in the city jail, but as they are for the present United States prisoners, Inspector Kane in whose charge they are, would not allow him to do so.<br>
<br>
Lee Bing, a highly educated Chinese merchant from Portland, came over yesterday from that city to assist in securing the release of Yee Long, whose certificate he signed in Portland.  It is probable, however, the two Chinamen will be held as witnesses until to-day anyhow and perhaps later.  Messrs. Mulkey and Coblentz will arrive this morning and will dispose of the prisoners as they think best.<br>
<br>
The certificates prepred by Trumbull were offered for sale in Victoria for $30 to $90 each.  Trumbull was taken before United States Commissioner Swan at Port Townsend, yesterday morning, and examination was postponed until Monday next.  Trumbull was released on $200 bail.  Ah Tom, who was arrested for smuggling opium, is said to be an accessory to the smuggling of Chinese.<br>

SMUGGLING.<br>
<br>
Robert C. Nesbit, "Smuggling in Puget Sound," <B>He Built Seattle, a biography of Judge Thomas Burke.</B> Seattle: University of Washington, 1961, p. 168-69.<br>
<br>
The captain of the United States Revenue Marine Cutter, in his report to the governor in 1884, called attention to the difficulty
of enforcing the Chinese Restriction Acts:<br>
<br>
"On the matter of the needs of the Customs Service of the Territory I can only say that the force employed to carry on the work of 'Protecting the Revenue' in this Collection District is ridiculously small, in no place, are such facilities offered for violation of Law as on this frontier, and in no place is such a large extent of Territory guarded or supposed to be guarded by so few men.<br>
<br>
There have been in this District so many avenues open for the smuggler, that it was impossible to guard them all, and since the enforcement of the Chinese Restriction Act, is entrusted to the Customs Official, the smuggler has but little difficulty in pursuing his nefarious calling.<br>
<br>
Complaints are frequently made that the Restriction Act is not enforced by the Customs official, that Chinamen are crowding into the Territory, without hindrance etc-I ask your attention to some of the obstacles encountered by the Revenue officer, in this matter<br>
<br>
"First, there is nothing to deter the Chinaman, from making the attempt.  No penalty attaches to him, he even is not required to bear his own expense in returning to the port from whence he came, consequently he keeps trying until he succeeds.  Some of them have been detected, and sent back so often, that their faces are quite familiar to the Customs authorities.<br>
<br>
The facility with which white men escape the penalty for aiding the Chinese, encourages dozens of worthless characters to engage in the business.  If caught, unless actually engaged in stepping from the boat to the shore, which occupies but a moment of time, they are acquitted.  There are thousands of Chinamen just without the border, waiting for an opportunity to get in.<br>
<br>
Plenty of worthless characters are ready to assist them, and all passenger steamers ready to carry them, provided it can be done without risk.  The facilities offered for smuggling Chinamen as well as dutiable goods by way of the San Juan Archipelago, are well known.<br>
<br>
These islands are inhabited by farmers and sheep raisers and while a large majority are honest, industrious men, there is no lack of confederates to assist the smugglers in concealment until a favorable opportunity to complete his voyage.  Indeed some of them openly declare themselves smugglers, and defy the law.<br>
<br>
"The proper enforcement of the Chinese Restriction Act would alone require more men, than now constitute the entire force of the Customs Service in this district, yet with all this additional duty, and the increasing commerce of the District the Customs force, with possibly one or two additional men remains the same as before the Act went into affect.<br>
<br>
The Collector of the District has been greatly embarrassed in his
efforts to get additional help by the Treasury Agents who have visited the District from time to time.  Knowing that 'Economy' is an ever popular cry they affect to disbelieve the accounts of smuggling, and oppose any increase in the Service.<br>
<br>
The fact is well established that Chinamen, and large quantities of opium are being brought into the Territory in violation of Law and that it will continue until a large increase in the Customs force in the District." Captain C. L. Hooper to Gov.  Squire, October 15, 1884, Governors' Papers, Washington State Archives, Olympia.<br>

STAGE ROBBERS<br>
<br>
Arthur Amos Gray "Stage coach robbers and other citizens," <B>Men Who Built the West.</B> Caldwell,Idaho: Caxton Printers, Ltd, 1947, p. 195-201.<br>
<br>
With cattle rustling and horse stealing went the robbing of stages.  After the discovery of gold the miners usually sent their gold in stages to the nearest town where there was a bank or a large iron safe, kept in buildings having doors and windows that were covered with heavy iron shutters at night.<br>
<br>
At the mines gold was put into a strong box, bound with heavy iron bands and made secure by a big lock.  This box was carried under the driver's seat, or inside the stage under the back seat.  The box was often chained securely to the stage.  If the stage carried a large amount of gold, guards, who were heavily armed, went along.  One sat with the driver, and one rode inside with the passengers.<br>
<br>
Two kinds  of  stages  ran  in  the  West.  One  carried  chiefly<br>
passengers. It did not always have a strong box. The other was the fast express, and in it were usually carried large amounts of gold.  These stages ran on schedule, and the robbers usually knew just about where they were on the road.<br>
<br>
To stop the stages the robbers selected a narrow place in the road, or a place where there was a sharp turn.  At such places the drivers had to slow down, and the robbers then easily stopped the horses.  Also, where trees and bushes grew along the sides of the road, or where the stage passed by large high rocks, the robbers hid and quickly drew their guns before they could be seen.  Stage robberies nearly always occurred in some isolated place, far from town.<br>
<br>
One of the most noted stage robbers was Charles E. Boles.  He was known as "Black Bart," because he always signed his name that way when he left a note saying anything about a robbery that he had committed.  Alone he robbed twenty eight stages in six years, and he never carried a loaded pistol.  He was finally caught and sent to the penitentiary.  Upon his release from prison, it is said, he was employed at a good salary by the company whose stages he had held up for so many years, on condition that he would not rob any more stages.  Having a good job, "Black Bart" had no further desire to rob stages.<br>
<br>
One man rarely tried to rob a stage alone.  There were generally three and sometimes five or seven men in the group.  As the horses slowed down at a sharp turn or where the road was rough, usually two men, one on each side of the road, jumped out quickly in front
of the horses to stop them.  At the same time another man drew his pistol on the driver, while another "covered" the passengers.<br>
<br>
The driver was forced first to climb down from his seat.  He was then disarmed and made to stand with his face close to the side of the stage, with both hands held upright.<br>
<br>
Next came the passengers.  As they climbed out of the stage, they were lined up by the side of the road and compelled, at the point of a gun, to hold their hands high in the air.  Sometimes they were required to hold the long whip of the driver above their heads; and no one was allowed to drop his hands.<br>
<br>
As these people stood helpless in the road, one of the robbers passed along the line and turned every pocket inside out, letting everything drop to the ground.  While this was going on, another searched the inside of the stage for hidden money and for jewelry.<br>
<br>
And if a strong box were found, it was dumped out in the road.  Sometimes each person was forced to take off his shoes.  In these paper money was often hidden.  The linings of the garments were also frequently examined.<br>
<br>
When all the pockets had been emptied on the ground, the people were put back into the coach, and the driver mounted his seat.  He was then required to drive on slowly.  This was done to give the robbers plenty of time to get away.<br>
<br>
Quickly the robbers gathered up everything in sacks.  They broke open the strong box, if the stage carried one, jumped upon their horses, and rode away.  All this took place in a few minutes, unless the strong box was hard to break open.<br>
<br>
Each robber had a good horse.  It was sometimes several hours, or even a day, before the officers of the law heard of the robbery; and by that time the robbers were usually many miles away.  Then there were no telephones, and the sheriff did not know of the affair until the stage arrived.  It was often too late then to catch the robbers.<br>
<br>
Stage robberies occurred almost daily.  The owners of the stages did not know what to do.  It was believed that some of the drivers were members of the criminal gangs.  One man in Idaho was so sure this was true that he decided to drive his stage himself in order to see if he would be stopped.  He put a good six-shooter in each hip pocket, and placed a shotgun between his knees.
While crossing the mountains, some men jumped into the road and yelled, "Throw up your hands!" Instantly he dropped his lines, and just as he snatched up his shotgun, the robbers opened fire.  He never had a chance to shoot.  The robbers used a shotgun with heavy buckshot, and the driver's hands were shot almost completely from his wrists.  The mangled hands had to be cut off, and he was never able to work again.<br>
<br>
At another time  the  owner  of  several  stages,  Ben  Holla-<br>
day was robbed of everything he had, and the strong Express, was<br>
box was carried away.  A small safe, which contained  valuables and jewelry, was also taken.  In the belt which Holladay wore the robbers found several thousand dollars worth of gold dust; he also had some paper money, which he carried in his pockets.  No one was killed in this robbery.<br>
<br>
it was frequently reported that Indians held up stages.  They did sometimes.  But investigation often showed that the robbers were white men, dressed and painted as Indians.  They imitated the war whoop of the red men and used arrows to deceive the driver and passengers.  These men usually help up the express stages that carried few or no passengers.<br>
<br>
Many stage robberies took place when gold dust was being carried from Montana and Idaho.  One fatal robbery occurred near Pocatello, Idaho.  In the stage were seven passengers and they had about $50,000 in gold dust, which they had worked hard to get.  In a strong box was an equal amount of gold being transported by the company for other miners.<br>
<br>
As the stage passed through some thick brush, five men jumped out on each side of the road and began firing at the driver and the passengers.  All but two of them were instantly killed.  The robbers carried the strong box into the brush and broke it open.  The driver was then ordered to go on.<br>
<br>
One of the passengers, to escape, acted like the opossum.  He pretended to be dead, and while the robbers were opening the strong box, he rolled over the bank along a river and hid himself in the brush.<br>
<br>
The stage company hunted for these robbers for a long time.  All @ of them were finally caught.  The last man was located in Mexico City, and while he was running away from the officers, he was shot and killed.<br>
<br>
Near the place of this robbery another occurred not long afterward.  The stage carried $60,000 in gold.  Three passengers
were killed.  The robbers escaped with the gold and much jewelry taken from the passengers.  This gang was <B>headed by the </B>notorious Jim Locket. None of the robbers was ever captured, but it was proved that the driver of the stage had told the gang of the trip, because he was one of them.  However, he was caught, tried, and hanged some time after the affair.<br>
<br>
Year after year the robbers in the West became more numerous and more dangerous.  They drifted from one mining community to another, always going where things were new and where few or no officers of the law lived.<br>
<br>
As soon as the state governments were established, courts were set up and sheriffs were elected.  But even after this for many years the disregard for the law was very common in many places, and murder continued.  One county had forty-four murders in a little more than a year, and only one person was tried; and in one state more than five hundred persons were killed by outlaws in less than a year.<br>
<br>
At times the people became aroused and organized committees that helped to catch the most dangerous characters.  The capture of one man often led to the arrest of others.  This happened with an outlaw named George Ives.  He was captured on the plains, and a hundred people attended the trial.  A jury of twenty-four men was chosen to try Ives.<br>
<br>
He was found guilty, and the crowd was divided as to whether he should be hanged or sent out of the country.  Those wishing him to hang were in the majority, and so in a few minutes he was swinging in the air dead.  Before he was hanged, Ives confessed to other crimes and gave the names of several men who belonged to his gang.<br>
Among the names was that of Henry Plummer, who was then a sheriff in a county in Montana.  People said the accusation could not be true; but upon investigation Plummer was found to be the chief leader of a large criminal gang.<br>
<br>
This discovery greatly aroused all good citizens in Montana.  They organized committees and scoured the country to find these desperate bandits.  More than a thousand men assisted the officers of the law in hunting for them.<br>
<br>
Plummer was caught.  He had formerly been in the mines in California, and had lived in Montana only a short time.  He was found guilty and hanged.  In his pocket was found a list of names of eighty-five men who belonged to his gang. <B>Within three</B> months, from December, 1863, to March, 1864, some twenty cut-throats in the mining sections of Montana were hanged.
One of the men executed was Joseph Slade.  He had been a superintendent of the Pony Express Company at Julesburg, Colorado, a few years before.  He was a notorious character.  When only thirteen years old, he had killed a man in Illinois by throwing a stone at him, because the man was trying to stop a fight between two boys.  After this Joseph's father took him to Texas, where he became a cowboy and, later, a soldier in the Mexican War.<br>
<br>
During the time that he acted as superintendent for the Pony Express at Julesburg, Slade had many quarrels with the employees.  One of these was Jules Reni, commonly known as "Old Jules," after whom this town was 'named.  Jules shot Slade with a shotgun and then ran away into the mountains.  Slade went to the hospital in St. Louis to get the shot removed from his body, and, when he returned, he hunted everywhere for Jules, intent on killing him at first sight.<br>
<br>
One day they met, and Slade shot Old Jules, crippling him badly.  Then Slade tied him to a post and shot him to death.  Not satisfied, he cut off his ears, it was said, and kept them as souvenirs.<br>
<br>
Slade was a most dangerous man, especially when under the influence of liquor.  After he was discharged from the Pony Express Company for cheating the riders out of their pay and for other crimes, he went to Fort Bridger, Wyoming, and in 1863, to Montana.  He found work in Virginia City.<br>
<br>
Slade was a fine horseman.  He had a habit of galloping into a town, yelling at the top of his voice, and shooting into the air.  Riding his horse into a store or saloon, he threw articles on the floor, destroyed merchandise, and threatened to kill the owner.<br>
<br>
His chief sport was shooting bottles of liquor from the shelves in the saloon, or shooting out the lights in stores and along the streets.  It was said that at one time he tried to make his horse drink a bottle of wine.<br>
<br>
After one of Slade's shooting sprees, a sheriff went to arrest him.  He tore up the warrant which the sheriff gave him, and then said that he would shoot the sheriff and the judge if they tried again to arrest him.<br>
<br>
The people of Virginia City had heard what a bad man Slade was, and everybody was afraid of him.  It was reported that he had killed twenty-six men before he arrived in Montana.  The insults that Slade heaped upon everyone, and his robbing and shooting aroused all good citizens.  They organized six hundred men, and,
with the aid of the sheriff, arrested Slade.<br>
<br>
When Slade was arrested, he asked to see his wife, who was many miles away.  Learning of his arrest, she made a long, hard ride on horseback in an effort to save him, only to arrive too late.  While she was racing to Virginia City at lightning speed, Slade was hanged.<br>
<br>
Slade was like many another bad man of the Far West.  He was tall, strong, fearless, and an expert on a horse.  He was one of the most dreaded men in all the West during his time; he was a perfect shot.  But when sober he was courteous and agreeable; he dressed well and was polite in the presence of others, unless he was out to rob and kill.<br>
<br>
Throughout the entire West at different periods desperadoes committed many crimes.  Settlements were far apart, and the officers of the law had great difficulty in catching these bad men.  But when they did, little sympathy was shown, and many were hanged without a trial.  In Wyoming the following words were found pinned to the body of an outlaw who had been hanged:<br>
<br>
Process of law is a little slow,<br>
So this is the road you'll have to go<br>
Murderers and thieves, BEWARE!<br>
<br>
Such affairs as these show you that the Far West once was a country full of excitement and adventure.  But we must remember also that the majority of the people were civil, industrious citizens.  At the same time that these crimes were common, schools and colleges were started, and every small community had one or more churches.<br>
<br>
The teachers and the preachers were just as devoted and as faithful to their work as teachers and preachers anywhere else in the<br>
world.<br>
<br>
The ministers went into the wild cowboy towns and into the wicked mining camps and never flinched where there was danger.  They often preached while standing on barrels or boxes that were placed in the streets.<br>
<br>
They rode horseback miles and miles through the storm and zero weather in the mountains and on the plains.  When the snow was too deep for the horses to go through, these good men went on snowshoes to preach to the people and to bury the dead.  Their pay, as well as that of the teachers, was always a mere pittance.<br>

THE BOEING 1948 STRIKE.<br>
<br>
John McCann, "The 1948 Boeing Strike," <B>Blood in the water, a history of District Lodge 751 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.</B> Seattle: District Lodge 751, 1989. p. 105-108, 114-130.<br>
<br>
Informal talks between Union and the Boeing Airplane company began on January 29, 1947.  Formal negotiations started on March 16.11 In April of 1947, the Union accused the company of not negotiating in good faith, and filed a notice of intention to strike as required by the War Labor Disputes Act (Smith-Connally Act).<br>
<br>
The Act required a thirty day cooling off- period prior to a strike vote.  The Union offered to submit unresolved articles of the contract to impartial arbitration. The company demanded veto power over the choice of arbiters, and demanded that the entire contract be submitted to arbitration.  The Union refused.<br>
<br>
Both Union and company met with the United States Conciliation Servicel3, but talks stalemated on seniority, wages and hours.  On May 10, 1947, 751 called a general membership meeting, which authorized continued negotiation for two weeks, and called for a strike vote after the two-week period.  The membership met again on May 24, rejected the company's final offer and authorized a strike. 751 leadership informed the company and asked the IAM for strike sanction.<br>
<br>
Further negotiations took place between Union and company with the help of the Conciliation Service.  Harvey Brown, IAM President, came to Seattle in late June.  According to Hansen, Boeing President AHen "informed Brown that the basic trouble existing between the parties arose out of the fact that the (75 1) union officers were not 'labor statesmen.'<br>
<br>
His support for this statement was that 'the officers had made an attempt to sell the company's proposal to the membership.'<br>
<br>

The IAM refused to grant strike sanction to 751 on the grounds that:<br>
<br>
1) The differences between company and Union had not been submitted to arbitration as provided for in the 1946 contract.<br>
<br>
2) The 1946 agreement included a no-strike clause.<br>
<br>
3) The 1946 contract remained in force and effect until a new agreement has been reached by the two parties either through
negotiation or arbitration."<br>
<br>
The no-strike clause and the fact that the 1946 contract remained in effect until a new agreement was reached meant that the company 
could stall negotiations  indefinitely. 751 had agreed to the contract remaim in full force and effect until a new agreement Was signed.<br>
<br>
Hansen quotes District President Harold Gibson as saying that "this clause was inserted in the contract because during the interval between the expiration of the old contract and the signing of the new one, rival unionism reared its head.<br>
<br>
Apparently the AFL carpenters, plumbers, etc., were attempting to invade this industrial Structure. (The IAM had withdrawn from the AFL in 1945 due to the inability or unwillingness on the part of the AFL Executive Council to resolve jurisdictional disputes between the Carpenters and the IAM in the IAM's favor.) The "full force and effect" clause returned to haunt the District.<br>
<br>
Negotiations continued sporadically between June and December of 1947.  The company submitted a revised proposal tO 751 on january 6, 1948, and intensive negotiation followed.  On March 15, 1948, the Union again offered to submit unresolved articles to arbitration.  The company took the same position as before; it wanted veto power over choice of arbiters; it wanted to submit the entire contract to arbitration.  Again, the Union refused.<br>
<br>
Prelude lo the 1948 Strike<br>
<br>
In the meantime, the Taft-Hartley Act had been enacted into law on June 23, 1947, by a Republican Congress over President Truman's veto.  The passage of Taft-Hartley considerably complicated an already complex situation.  Among other provisions, provisions which in total prompted organized labor to label TaftHartley a slave labor law, the Act required a 60 day notice prior to a strike.16 Taft-Hartley also required union authorization elections prior to union shop agreement.<br>
<br>
The NLRB conducted an authorization election during the week of March 26, 1948.  "About - 12,800 employees voted in the election, and more than 12,000 voted to authorize Lodge 751 to negotiate a union shop agreement with the company."18 Negotiations continued, centering on the seniority question, wages and the date of retroactivity of increases, and the method of selection of an arbitration panel.<br>
<br>
Agreement staged on the date of retroactivity and the amount of the wage increase. (The Union wanted wage increases to be retroactive to January 1, 1947.  The company insisted upon the date of the beginning of formal negotiations - March 16, 1947.) On
April 13, 1947, the District Council established a deadline of April 16 for the reaching of a settlement regarding choice of arbiters.<br>
<br>
Following this deadline, the Union submitted another proposal to the company, providing for selection of arbiters and submission of wage demands to arbitration.  The company refused.<br>
<br>
On April 20,1948, the District Council m@with "some 350 shop committeemen" Present, and voted to strike on 12:30 AM of April 22, 1948.  The Union submitted a final proposal to the company on April 20.  The company refused the offer.<br>
<br>
The District Council met again on April 2l. According to Hansen,<br>
Grand Lodge Representative Cotton addressed this meeting and cautioned the members as to possible consequences of such strike action, reminding them of their weak strategic position, and informing them that the advice of the Grand Lodge was to stay on the job.  However, emotions were running high and he was booed 
from the platform.<br>
<br>
On April 22, 1948, the membership of District Lodge 751 struck, and remained on strike until September 13, 1948.<br>
<br>
"Let's forget about the Union. Let's concentrate on community, country, company and ourselves.  "<br>
<br>
Boeing President William Allen addressing a mass meeting of non-strikers and scabs during the 1948 strike.<br>
<br>
The strike came as no surprise to Boeing.  "As early as the summer of 1947, almost a year before the strike, Mr. Allen outlined to the supervisors the plan of action they should folloW.112 When the strike did come, Allen was prepared.  From the beginning, Allen and Boeing used tactics designed to isolate 751 leadership in the eyes of the membership and the community.<br>
<br>
Allen made adroit use of Taft-Hartley and Dave Beck of the Teamsters in his attempt to break the strike and the Aero Mechanics Union.  The following telegrams between Allen and Harvey Brown, IAM President, were the first salvo:<br>
<br>
April 22, 19484:48 P.M.<br>
<br>
To:    Harvey Brown, President<br>
International Association of Machinists From: Wilham M. Allen, President<br>
Boeing Airplane Company<br>
<br>
     At 12:30 A.M. today Local 751 of the Intemational Association of Machinists caused its members to strike at the Boeing Airplane Company's Plant in Seattle.  Our operations are being
picketed today.  Please advise by return wire if this action was sanctioned by the International Association of Machinists.<br>
<br>
Washington, D.C., April 23, 1948 11:10 A.M.<br>
<br>
To: William M. Allen From: Harvey Brown<br>
<br>
International Association of Machinists'Executive Council did not sanction strike at the Boeing Airplane Company's Plant in Seattle.<br>
<br>
April 23, 1948  10:50 P.M.<br>
<br>
To: Harvey Brown From: William M. Allen<br>
<br>
Appreciate your wire stating you did not sanction strike.  I wish to point out that no notices were given by Local 751 which would constitute compliance with Section 8D of the National Labor Relations Act; that individuals represented by Local 751 are engaging in a strike in violation of this section; that these individuals have therefore lost their status as employees of this Company; and as a consequence Local 751 does not at the present time constitute a collective bargaining agent under the National Labor Relations Act.<br>
<br>
In telegrams which followed, Brown and Allen agreed to a meeting between Boeing officials and a subcommittee of the IAM Executive Council in Seattle.  AJ.  Hayes, IAM General Vice-President, tells what happened next:<br>
<br>
I telephoned Mr. Allen of the Boeing Airplane Company at approximately 1:45 P.M. on Tuesday, April 27, 1948, for the purpose of arranging for the time and place for a conference to be held for the purpose of attempting to settle the strike of District #751 of the Intemational Association of Machinists at the Boeing Company Plant.<br>
<br>
I told Mr. Allen that there would be six persons in our group.  Mr. Allen immediately inquired as to the identity of the six.  I explained to Mr. Allen that our group was composed of Vice-Presidents Joseph McBreen, Roy M. Brown and myself; Grand Lodge Representatives Jack Bentley and Garry Cotton; and Harold Gibson, President of District #751.<br>
<br>
When I gave Mr. Allen this information, he immediately objected to meeting anyone other than the subcommittee of the Grand Lodge Executive Council (Vice-Presidents McBreen, Brown and Hayes)....
Mr. Allen stated further that he did not intend to meet with the subcommittee ... for the purpose of negotiating any provisions of an agreement and that he would not meet with any representatives of District #751 of the IAM.  He stated in substance that he intended to meet with the subcommittee of the Executive Council only for the purpose of discussing:<br>
<br>
1)     What the Grand Lodge of the IAM intended to do about those in District #751, IAM, who were responsible for violating the labor contract and the Taft-Hartley Act.<br>
<br>
2)     To explore the possibilities of establishing a bargaining agency on a basis which would give the Company definite assurance that there would be no further violations of an agreement or the Taft-Hartley Act.<br>
<br>
3)     To discuss matters related to damages incurred by the     Boeing Company as a result of the strike.<br>
<br>
I told Mr. Allen that the subcommittee did not come to Seattle to discuss his allegations with reference to violations of the Taft-Hartley Act, but that we came to Seattle in the hope that we could be helpful in resolving the issues which caused the strike.  I explained to Mr. Allen that ... it was not Mr. Brown's intention to send a committee to Seattle for the purpose of discussing the matters Mr. Allen had previously mentioned to me.<br>
<br>
During the discussion of this phase of the question, Mr. Allen said that he had no objection to our bringing our attomey to the conference but that he would not meet representatives of District #75 1. Since Mr. Allen did not deviate from his position, no con-
ference was held.<br>
<br>
Faced with Allen's refusal to bargain with District 751 leadership present, the IAM belatedly <B>granted</B> strike sanction on April 28, 1948.  By refusing to bargain with 75 1, but agreeing to meeting with the IAM subcommittee, Allen had attempted to create the appearance of division within the International.<br>
<br>
Clearly, Allen desired a union at Boeing more to the liking of management - a more pliable, reliable union - a union led, perhaps, by a "labor statesman.<br>
<br>
Allen found his "labor statesman" in Dave Beck, Vice President of the Intenational Brotherhood of Teamsters.  With the Aero Mechanics on strike, Beck moved in.  At first, he claimed only to be interested in exercising jurisdictional rights over about 5,000 warehouse workers, parts and transportation department employees.6 An Aviation Week article of 6/7/48 explains the situation well:
The (Boeing) company has insisted from the start that it can no longer rely on the Aero Mechanics' leadership and has hinted that it wished to deal with a new union, one with 'responsible' officials.<br>
<br>
Beck's rationale for the raid on the Aero Mechanics is explained in the same Aviation Week article:<br>
<br>
Several thousand men and women, who properly belong to our organization, are today out of employment because of a labor dispute with which this union has no connection whatsoever .... As a direct result of this dispute, a vast amount of work, upon which they have a right to depend in the future, has been transferred elsewhere and may never return to Seattle.<br>
<br>
Beck's statement contained two kernels of truth.  The AFL had granted the Teamsters jurisdiction over some workers at Boeing.  "On May 28, (Beck) announced in his union newspaper, the Washington Teamster, that the Teamsters would seek jurisdiction at Boeing on the grounds that it had been awarded them by the 1937 AFL convention.<br>
<br>
A Business Week article of 9 / 25 / 48 provides further explanation:<br>
<br>
Some years ago the AFL Executive Council awarded conditional jurisdiction at aircraft plants to the IAM, which was at the time affiliated with the AFL.  The object was to block CIO organizing drives in aircraft plants.  The Council stipulated that after plants were safely- organized, the Machinists must recognize jurisdiction of craft unions.<br>
<br>
The IAM didn't do so before leaving the AFL, and it's not likely to do so now that it's out of the Federation.<br>
<br>
Perlman notes that "Beck, it should be added, got at least a limited endorsement from the AFL executive council - but this was at a time when AFL President Green was trying to pressure the IAM to negotiate with the AFL."'(The IAM was out of the AFL at the time.) Beck's statement that vast amounts of work had been transferred out of Seattle perhaps never to return had some truth also.<br>
<br>
Aviation Week said on May 24, 1948, that Boeing "transferred several million dollars of work to Wichita and to subcontractors in Oregon and California. A much greater threat alluded to in Beck's<br>

statement were rumors circulating to the effect that  the Air Force intended to move all defense plants inland to place them out of range of Soviet bombers.  The Air Force did, in fact, have such a plan, which they formally announced in 1949.  But the Air Force later backed off, and the plan to move all Boeing production to
<br>
Wichita never materialized.<br>
<br>
It soon became clear, however, that Beck and the Teamsters intended to capture the entire membership of 751.  The fiction of asserting jurisdictional rights over a limited number of employees (rights which were disputed by the IAM) became apparent when Beck organized Aeronautical Workers and Warehousemen Helpers Union Local 45 1, and opened a hiring hall to recruit workers for Boeing.12 Moreover, Beck and Allen had a deal.  Samuel Bassett, an attorney on the Teamsters' staff during 1948, had this to say:<br>
<br>
I was requested to meet (at) ... the Washington Athletic Club with representatives of Boeing and a small committee appointed by Dave Beck.  At that time, I met Mr. Allen for the first time, and I was also introduced to Mr. Logan, who I believe was Boeing's labor relations manager.<br>
<br>
At that meeting a course of action for ending the strike was discussed.  Thereafter the Teamsters union sent organizers through the picket lines at the Boeing plant to solicit membership applications from employees who had returned to work and from new (workers) who had been recruited by the company.  The Teamsters union chartered a new local union designated as Aeronautical Workers, Warehousemen and Helpers Union Local 451, and this local established ari employment office and recruited employees to replace the strikers.<br>
<br>
(After the strike) ... and during the strike, on several occasions a committee from the Teamsters union, which I was requested to accompany, visited Boeing's labor relations office to discuss the recruiting and organizing efforts of the Teamsters union.<br>
<br>
.... I am sure that Mr. Allen will not deny that he came to Dave Beck's office and requested him to assist in breaking the strike of the Aero Mechanics' Union.<br>
<br>
Beck, with the collaboration of Allen and Boeing, recruited scabs through much of the period 751 was on strike.  Boeing actively recruited scabs in its own right through extensive newspaper and billboard advertising.  Company sponsored billboards read, "Boeing has a job to do; Boeing has a job for you.-14 According to Aviation Week of May 31, 1948,<br>
<br>
Boeing continued to advertise for workers willing to cross the picket lines and made it more tempting by granting a 15 cents an hour wage increase to all hourly employees.  Allen claims the increase makes Boeing personnel the best paid aircraft workers in the world.  At present the boost affects about 1000 workers, but
would apply to all Union members should they all decide to retum to their respective jobs.<br>
<br>
Excerpts from accounts of the time show a growing presence of non-751 workers in the Boeing plants.  This quote is from Aviation Week of June 7, 1948:<br>
<br>

<B>Any Person Crossing This Picket Line Is a Scab!</B><br>
<br>

<B>Don't Be a Boeing Scab</B><br>
<br>
Aero Mechanic Union members-over 14,000 strong-ore on strike against Baeog Air. plane Company to win a living wage and retain adequate working conditions.<br>
<br>
Picket lines are around all Boeing plants 24 hours each and every day.  Any person crossing this picket line. whether to work in a job formmy held by a Union man or to fO any pos@. is labeled as a scab and a sfnle-breakerl<br>
<br>
The Aero Mechan;cs Union is offiriafed with fhe huge International Assockwm of Ma. chinists-on infernational Union with members in every state in the United States.  HawaiL Canada and the Canal Zone.  These hundreds of thousands of members and the rest of a huge army of American Union people will remember forever the ident*y of scalm Amd here's the definition of a SCAB as found in Webster's Unabridged Dictionary:<br>
<br>
"A mean, dirty, peltry fellow; specifically in contempt, a workman who refuses to join in a strike, and one who continues at his work as usual; one who takes a striker's place . . .<br>
<br>

<B>No Real Man or Woman Ever Becomes a Scab</B><br>
<br>
The Teamsters, according to the rival Aero Mechanics, have 12 organizers working on Boeing employees and already have signed up about 200 employees normally represented by the Mechanics.<br>
<br>
The Teamsters have not been observing the picket lines at Boeing.  Neither have members of the engineers' union.  In addition, the back-to-work move is growing.  Total employment (author's note: includes all employees - not just hourly employees) last week was put at near 5000 and was increasing I 00 per day.<br>
<br>
On June 28, 1948, Aviation Week said, "Total hourly employees now is 3650, including 926 retumed strikers." By July, according to Hansen, "the Teamsters'campaign became a serious factor as housewives, 19-year olds, and rural residents moved into Boeing.1118 And by July 20, 1948, according to the New Republic,<br>

<br>

... <B>it </B>appeared that the company was succeeding.  Retuming strikers and new workers flocked into the plant, and Boeing claimed to be within 5000 of its needed workforce.<br>
<br>
But despite the pressure of company blandishments, Lodge 75 I's members are continuing an excellent job of holding out.  Less than 3000 of them have returned to work.<br>
<br>
Included in the Union's ranks are a large number of first-time unionists, school teachers and farmers who had flocked to Boeing during the war, and some 500 Negroes, who had worked on permits during the war and have been admitted only recently to IAM membership.  All of them are still marching on the picket line.<br>
<br>
By late July of 1948, it had become clear that District Lodge 751 could remain on strike no longer.  Boeing refused to bargain.  Boeing, in association with Beck and the Teamsters, was actively recruiting strikebreakers.  Given more time, Boeing would be able to replace striking Aero Mechanics with scabs.<br>
<br>
Too, the Taft-Hartley Act provided that only employees actually at work in the Boeing plants were eligible to vote in NLRB representation elections. By late July 751 leadership knew that the Union would be facing an NLRB representational election against the Teamsters.  An NLRB trial examiner's ruling of July 20 came just in time.  This ruling ordered Boeing to reinstate striking 751 members.<br>
<br>
A complex series of NLRB hearings and court cases took place during and after the strike.  The NLRB essentially supported 751's claim that Boeing was engaging in unfair labor practices due to refusal to bargain with 751.  The NLRB requested a District Court injunction requiring Boeing to bargain with the Union.<br>
<br>
In June of 1948, the District Court refused, citing the contract extension clause, the contract no-strike clause and the lack of 60-day strike notice as required by Taft-Hartley.  In addition, the Court held in its June, 1948, ruling that the company was "not required ... to bargain collectively with Lodge 751 or to recognize Lodge 751 as the collective bargaining representative of the presently striking employees of (the) ... Company.<br>
<br>
NLRB hearings continued.  An NLRB trial examiner found on July 20, 1948, that:<br>
<br>
1) The contract extension clause "could not contemplate perpetuity<br>
<br>
2) The Union had adequately complied with the 60-day notice provision.<br>
<br>
3) The Union "was and is the exclusive bargaining representative of
employees in the appropriate collective bargaining unit.<br>
<br>
4) The Boeing Company was engaging in unfair labor practices by refusal to bargain with the Union.  The NLRB trial examiner ordered Boeing "to cease and desist from refusing to bargain collectively with Lodge 751 " and to reinstate "all employees who went on strike on April 22, 1948, to their ... positions without prejudice.<br>
<br>
According to the New Republic,<br>
<br>
Lodge 751 immediately accepted Spencer's (the NLRB trial examiner) 
findings in full and applied to retum <B>its </B>members to work on the NLRB recommendations.  The company, committed to its new employees and involved with Beck's Teamsters, could do nothing but refuse.  On August 1, five days after Lodge 751's application, Boeing was liable to pay $172,000 daily in defaulted wages should the NLRB and the courts uphold Spencer's findings.<br>
<br>
But Bill Allen and Boeing seem willing to take the chance.  His determination to prove the strike illegal apparently unshaken, Allen announced he would cany the case all the way to the Supreme Court.<br>
<br>
Boeing held out in defiance of the NLRB trial examiner's ruling until September.  On September 13, 1948, the strike ended.  Aviation Week summarizes the reasons 751 returned to work:<br>
<br>
... the Aero Mechanics hurried back to work on September 13 after being out 140 days.  The new (Teamster) union was one reason for the return.  Others: IAM worry over cost of strike benefits, more than $2,000,000; defection of about one-third of AMUs (Aero Mechanics Union) original 14,000 members.<br>
<br>
The NLRB trial examiner handed down the reinstatement order on July 20, 1948.  Allen ignored it until September 13th.  ABen's reasons for agreeing to abide by the trial examiner's ruling include two possibilities: first, he may have counted on the NLRB or the courts overturning the ruling.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, however, Boeing incurred penalties of $172,000 per day; perhaps Allen and Boeing decided the stakes were getting too high.  Second, and the more likely reason: Business Week of 9/17/49 says, "The walkout ended only after high military officials intervened.-27 Seeing the Cold War heat up, the Armed Forces became deeply concemed with production delays of the B-50 Superfortress bomber, for which Boeing was the prime contractor.<br>
<br>
In any event, the longest strike in 75I's history ended.  It is more
accurate to say that the strike was broken.<br>
<br>
Boeing and Allen had little to lose by complying with the trial examiner's ruling, for when 751 members returned to work, they retumed without a contract and under the company's terms.  Four factors forced them back: Allen's refusal to bargain, the Teamster raid, the ability of Boeing and the Teamsters to recruit strikebreakers, and the TaftHartley Act.<br>
<br>
The New Republic, in an article of August 30, 1948, says, "Today some local leaders, sympathetic to the strike, feel that inexperienced Union leaders were unwise to act so abruptly.1128 Looking back with always-clear hindsight, this seems true, but the District was a democratic union, the membership did endorse the strike, the entire seniority system was at stake, and 751 did try to reach agreement.<br>
<br>
When 751 members retumed to work, they retumed without a contract, and hearings and litigation continued.  An NLRB ruling of November 22, 1948, upheld the decision of the trial examiner.  Boeing appealed the NLRB ruling to the courts.<br>
<br>
A ruling on May 31, 1949 by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia struck down the NLRB ruling, saying virtually the same thing as the previous District Court decision of June 1948:<br>
<br>
The strike was illegal, as the contract's no-strike clause had been violated.  The Union had not complied with Taft-Hartley.  The Union had lost the right to engage in collective bargaining on behalf of Boeing employees.<br>
<br>
On July 31, 1949, 751 petitioned the NLIP for a representation election to determine which union had the right to engage in collective bargaining with the company.  Tippett explains the situation:<br>
<br>
The strike had been over for almost eleven months when the Circuit Court's adverse decision came and the District's petition for an NLRB election was filed.  In the eleven months' interim, although the Aero Mechanics were working in the plant, they had no contract with the Company and no protection.<br>
<br>
They were mixed in with Teamsters members and with non-Union employees... It was this total group of Boeing workers that would be eligible to vote in the representative election.  They, as a whole, would determine the issue.  A majority of them had to vote for the Aero Mechanics in the coming election.  How to be assured of that majority was the major concem of the Aero Mechanics in July 1949, as they waited for the NLRB to process their petition.<br>

The NLRB set the election for November 1, 1949.  The ballot provided for a choice between District Lodge 751, the Teamsters" Local 451, and "no union" - as required by Taft-Hartley.  With the election date set, 751 mobilized, briefed and organized Union members, directed personal letter campaigns at all Boeing workers, made house calls on each worker, established a speakers bureau, held mass membership meetings and special Local and District meetings, and aimed extensive radio, billboard and newspaper advertisements at Boeing workers and the labor community.<br>

THE BOEING STRIKES OF 1965 AND 1977.<br>
<br>
John McCann, "The  Boeing Strikes of 1965 and 1977" <B>Blood in the water, a history of District Lodge 751 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.</B> Seattle: District Lodge 751,<br>
1989. p.<br>
<br>

But neither the 1965 nor the 1977 strikes were as <B>significant </B>in the history of District Lodge 751 as the 1948 strike, the representational battle with the Teamsters or the 1962 contract negotiations.  The very survival of the Union depended upon the outcome of those battles.<br>
<br>
By contrast, the 1965 and 1977 strikes focused on incremental change in collective bargaining agreements.<br>
<br>
Major issues in 1965 were Performance Analysis, union security and dependent medical coverage.  Since the strike took place under the IAM Boeing corporate agreement, all IAM members at Boeing struck nationwide.<br>
<br>
Two months of negotiations preceded the strike.  The strike itself lasted nineteen days.  The Union won minor modifications in union security provisions, and won review of the Performance Analysis system by a Union-company committee.<br>
<br>
According to Bill Walkama (Interview, 3 / 3 / 88), the Union made gains in dependent medical coverage.  The Union retained the right to strike over the Performance Analysis issue.  Performance Analysis negotiations continued through April 1966.  Performance Analysis was replaced by a system called "Seniority Ability Control."<br>
<br>
Seniority Ability Control was Performance Analysis under a different name, but according to the Aero Mechanic of 4/25/66, the IAM won improvements in seniority provisions, and in grievance and arbitration procedures.<br>
<br>
The 1977 strike lasted from October 4 to November 17.  This strike also took place under the IAM Boeing corporate agreement.  Major issues were wages, retirement, cost of living adjustments, and health and welfare benefits.  The most important issues were wages and cost of living adjustments.<br>
<br>
The company's proposal offered a 3% general increase on base wage rates, not increases based on the base rate plus folded-in COLA'S. (See Aero Mechanic, IO/ 13/77.)<br>

According to Bill Walkama (Interview, 3/3/88), the Union won "substantial improvements in the pension program and in some wage inequities and fringe and health and welfare benefits."<br>
<br>
The 1977 strike, according to Walkama was "a strong, stable strike.  It was well organized, well put together."<br>

TACOMA AND THE SEATTLE GENERAL STRIKE<br>
<br>
Edwin T. Short, "The Seattle General Strike in Tacoma, After Many Years," <B>The Tacoma Times.<br>
</B><br>
Rumors and rumblings of a general strike on the Pacific Coast to force a settlement of the longshore troubles recall the interesting but futile effort of 15 years ago to tie the Northwest into an industrial and economical hard knot because of a row between shipyard employes and employers.<br>
<br>
Tacoma had just a little taste of the general strike dose, but the movement here flivvered out in a few hours because of a split among Central Labor council delegates.  But over in Seattle, where the movement started, things were pretty well tied up.<br>
<br>
The strike lasted five days.  Then the wheels began to move and some of the boys went back to work without having gianed one advantage.  Some of thein never did go back.  All of them lost five days' pay and the organized labor movement in the Northwest was given a blow from which it never fully recovered!<br>
<br>
One of the interesting recollections of the five-day tieup was the reaction of members of organized labor to general strike conditons.  A strategy committee had agreed that a few bake shops,dairies and wholesale meat establishments would operate to prevent actual suffering but every other source of food supply was to be shut tight so that everybody would see and recognize the power of labor.  Strikers were to be fed at a commissary.  And that was the straw that broke the back of the general strike.<br>
<br>
It was about this time that we were hearing a great deal about how the Bolsheviks were feeding hungry Russians through the commissary system.  The theory sounded fine, and early in the morning of the first day of the general strike several thousand men and women were milling around the Labor Temple eager to sample a comissary breakfast.  The only hitch in the program was that the breakfast bell didn't ring.  Getting things in shipshape to feed a few thousand people right off the bat wasn't as simple as it seemed.<br>
<br>
In the middle of the morning the first bakery trucks backed up to the Labor Temple.  Volunteers carried the bread in armfuls<br>
like stovewood and piled it on the floor of the "dining hall." About noon kettles of stew arrived from a restaurant kitchen
<br>
operated under commissary direction.  Two hours later the doors were opened and the crowd rushed in.  Bowls of cold stew and chunks of bread were spread on tables made of boards laid on saw benches.  No spoons, knives or forks.  Anybody hungry enough to eat cold stew could dunk it with a chunk of bread.<br>
<br>
Maybe there wasn't a lot of growling! Metal trades workers who had been drawing $12 a day in the shipyards and living on the fat of the land wanted to know "wotinell" they thought they were anyway--hogs!<br>
<br>
After the first day's failure the order went out that the commissary would feed only those who did not have homes.  Heads of families were told that they would have to take care of themselves and eat at home.  The commissary, however, was not equal even to that.  Those who had been dreaming of a great commonwealth controlled by industry began to fear that perhaps their confidence had been misplaced.  If the workers couldn't handle a "simple" problem like feeding a few thousand persons, what would happen if they tried to operate great industrial plants?<br>
<br>
Ole Hanson, mayor of Seattle, now a California real estate promoter, claimed credit for "breaking" the general strike.  But it wasn't Ole.  The sloppy commissary took the glamour out of the tieup.  Sober reflection by thousands of workers who had been forced into the walkout against their better judgment and the increasing resentment of victims who had no part in the original quarrel, finished it.<br>
<br>
The effect of the general strike on the innocent bystanders was one of the influences which hurt organized labor in the Northwest.  Thousands pf Seattle residents who had championed the cause of organt4ed labor lost interest in the movement entirely when they were compelled to do without street cars, foodshops, and the other necessities and conveniences of which they had been deprived because of a quarrel in which they were not involved.<br>
<br>
This isn't an argument for or against the use of a general strike to enforce the demands of labor.  It is just a review of one general strike which flivvered and injured the prestige of organized labor in the Northwest.  There is no evidence to warrant the belief that another general strike would be any more helpful than was the one 15 years ago.<br>
<br>
On the contrary, sympathetic observance of the labor movement since the days of the Knights of Labor has created the belief that the general strike is the most ineffective weapon labor can
use to obtain its rights.<br>
<br>
The general strike affects too many innocent bystanders, and when the innocent bystander is hurt he wants to strike back at the immediate source of his injury!<br>

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++SEATTLE GENERAL STRIKE.<br>
<br>
Robert L. Friedheim, "The Seattle General Strike of 1919," <B>Pacific Northwest Quarterly.</B> LII (July, 1961) p. 81-98.<br>
<br>
At ten o;clock<B> </B>in the morning, February 6, 1919, the city of Seattle was ominously quiet.<br>
<br>
Sixty thousand organized workingmen had failed report to their jobs.  Buses and trolleys returned in their barns.  No smoke poured from  the chimneys of factories, workshops, and foundr<B>ies </B>in the ordinarily bustling industrial por<B>tions </B>of the city and its waterfront.<br>
<br>
On the virtually deserted downtown streets, only a few people moved quietly past closed stores and shops.  The store shelves had long since been emptied of food and fuel-and rifles and pistols.<br>
<br>
On that Thursday morning even the public schools of the Northwest's Queen City were closed.  Seattle lay paralyzed.  The first major general strike in American history had begun.<br>
<br>
The whole country anxiously awaited news of the events unfolding in Seattle.  The reports were carried by the wire services and in follow-up magazine articles branded the general strike a revolution. These reports helped to frighten the American middle class into believing that revolution stalked the land, and thus in part helped convince them of the necessity of the infamous Palmer raids of 1919 and 1920.<br>
<br>
The Seattle General Strike also produced a colorful new American
hero-the city's mayor Ole Hansen who, according to his own modest account of events in February, 1919, suppressed a revolution. The personal publicity garnered by Hanson because of the strike gave him delusions of grandeur; he proclaimed himself a candidate for<br>
Republican  nomination   for   the   presidency of the United States.<br>
<br>
The Seattle General Strike has at various  times been referred to as a Bolshevik type  of  revolution, planned and carried out by Soviet agents; a one-man revolution engineered by a local radical,<br>
Leon Green, business agent of an electrical workers' local union; an uprising by the Industrial Workers of the World attempted under cover of a strike of the unions in the American Federation of Labor;4 an insurrection led by James A. Duncan, secretary of the Seattle Central Labor Council, thumbing its nose at Samuel Gompers and the conservative leaders of the A.F. of L.,International craft unions; and, as labor itself alleged, merely a demonstration of sympathy by Seattle labor with their striking fellow workers in the shipyards."<br>
<br>
While all of these views contribute something toward understanding the causes and meaning of the strike, none contains more than partial and distorted truth.<br>
<br>
The effects of the Seattle General Strike on the country mark it as an event of major importance.  Because none of the previous investigations of the strike is adequate, a fresh look may be welcome.<br>
<br>
The causes of the general strike were numerous and complex.  For purposes of analysis, they can be discussed in three general categories: (1) general instability during this era throughout major portions of the world, felt both locally and nationally; (2) the organization, ideology, and mood of Seattle labor; and (3) the immediate cause-the Seattle shipyard strike, directed against yard owners and the Emergency Fleet Corporation, a wartime subsidiary of the United States government.<br>
<br>
In February, 1919, the fighting of World War 1, the greatest war yet experienced, had ceased less than three months earlier.  The losing powers were militarily defeated and socially and politi-
cally unstable.  Most of the victors had extended themselves to the limit in blood and treasure to achieve their victory, and many of their peoples were disillusioned and tired.<br>
<br>
Revolution and revolt occurred in the lands of both victor and vanquished.  In this unstable postwar world, men and govemments had to face the problem of reconverting their manpower, resources, industries, and farms to meet the needs of a goods starved world.<br>
<br>

Even more difficult than material conversion was the task of reorienting men's minds.  Both soldiers and civilians were said to have been brutalized by their participation in the war, and many social critics wondered whether traditional social and political patterns could ever be restored.  Attitudes of hatred, fear, anger, and frustration, often officially directed against internal dissenters and external enemies, were rife.<br>
<br>
This was an era of extraordinary and upsetting events.  The newspapers of the day carried inflammatory front-page stories on the Kapp Putsch in Berlin, the Hungarian revolution led by Bela Kun, a general strike in Buenos Aires, the Khaki election in Great Britain, the Spartakist uprisings in Germany and the dramatic deaths of its leaders Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, and the treaty-making at Versailles by the leaders of the victorious nations-Woodrow Wilson, Lloyd George, Clemenceau, and Orlando.<br>
<br>
These events, however, were overshadowed by an occurrence of even more lasting importancethe Bolshevik Revolution.  The March, 1917, revolution, which overthrew the Russian Czar, was acclaimed by most "democratic" peoples of the world.  Not so the Bolshevik Revolution of October, 1918.<br>
<br>
The October Revolution, and the civil war and Allied intervention that followed, split "democratic" opinion into two antagonistic camps-the left, defending the revolution as the beginning of paradise on earth; the right, attacking it as hell on earth.  The conflicting attitudes on what should be done about Russia strongly affected the political struggles of these groups within their own countries.<br>
<br>
The United States, while less affected than Europe by the turmoil of the era, was not entirely exempt from the mood of unres were a number of Negro lynchings in the South.<br>
<br>
The eighteenth or prohibition ammendment which soon became associated with with lawlessness, was adopted two months after the  Armistice.  Even nature seemed to conspire against stability: an influenza epidemic which had littered the land with dead was still taking numerous victims.<br>
<br>
Wartime hatreds against dissenters, aliens, slackers, "Huns," saboteurs, and other of radicals had not abated.  The press kept the "Hang the Kaiser" movement alive.  Repression and prosecution of dissenters continued. The Industrial Workers of the World, whose secret of opposition to America's participation in the "Capitalist War," were particularly hard hit.<br>
<br>
Jails throughout the West held many "class-war victims," as the Wobblies called them.  Just before the general strike in Seattle,
forty-six I.W.W.'s were put on trial in Sacramento for obstructing the war effort.  Sentiment for conviction ran high both in the press and in respectable society.<br>
<br>
Seattle had many of its own examples of intolerance to dissent.  Louise Olivereau, a typist for an I.W.W. local, received a ten-year prison. term for distributing anti-war leaflets and thus: violating the Espionage Act.  Although her actions were disavowed by the I.W.W., the prosecution alleged that her efforts were sponsored by that organization and paid for with German gold.  The jury needed only thirty minutes to reach its verdict.<br>
<br>
Two local Socialists, Hulet Wells, former president of the Seattle Central Labor Council, and Sam Sadler, agitated against the passage by Congress of the Conscription Law.  Although they desisted after it became law, nevertheless they were brought to trial.  The result was a hung jury.  The two were retried, convicted, and given a two-year prison sentence for "conspiring to prevent the execution of the joint resolution of Congress declaring war."<br>
<br>
lt was later alleged that Wells was tortured while serving his sentence at McNeil Island penitentiary."<br>
<br>
Repression of "undesirable elements" was handled not only by agents of the United States govunent, but also by officially sanctioned private patriotic  groups.     The American Protective League,   through  its active arm, the Minutemen, whose function was to     assist in  "suppression of anarchy, sedition, and sabotage," quickly infiltrated labor and radical organizations.  It became extremely busy in enforcing its brand of  patriotism.<br>
<br>
The local Middle Class was to some extent usually suspicious of the ideological position of Se<B>attle </B>labor.  Strange new organizations were being formed in their community.  A Workers, Soldiers, and Sailors Council, sponsored by the Seattle Metal Trades Council, was a prime ex.nple.  It appeared to be modeled after the olshevik soviet.  Some of its sponsors hoped it would serve the same revolutionary function as <B>its </B>archetype," but its principal purpose was to help in the adjustment of returning veterans to civilian life.<br>
<br>
Labor hoped by this effort to pre<B>vent </B>capital from organizing the veterans as a force  with  which  to  break  strikes  and   destroy  the closed shop. But labor's organization was rapadly infiltrated by Minutemen."<br>
<br>
Another event causing suspicion amonlr local conservative groups was the heavy involvement <B>of </B>the Seattle labor movement in sponsoring the Mooney Conference in Chicago.  This conference was
called to protest the imprisonment of Thomas Mooney, a San Francisco labor leader who had been convicted for the bombing of a Preparedness Day parade in 1916.  Although his death sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment, labor vehemently insisted upon his innocence and demanded complete exoneration.<br>
<br>
The Seattle movement was a hotbed of Mooney support.  In addition to being one of the three original sponsors of the conference, local labor sent an unusually large delegation, including most of its important leaders.  These men helped spearhead the decision of the conference to ask labor organizations throughout the country to call a general strike if Mooney was not given a <B>new</B> trial by July 4, 1919.<br>
<br>
Antagonism between left and right in Seattle was sharpened by that momentous event abroad -the Bolshevik Revolution.  The conservatives of the community, and especially the representatives of business, took more than ordinary measures to discredit the new regime in Russia.  The Daily Bulletin, a business newspaper, was particularly incensed, for example, over the "infamous decree issued by the Bolsheviks at Saratow which called for the socialization of women, the vilest document ever penned."<br>
<br>
Labor and the left generally were equally vehement, if not as colorful, in defense of the Bolshevik experiment.  Their enthusiasm led to two riots on Seattle streets.  The first stemmed from an open-air meeting sponsored by several labor organizations to protest American intervention in Siberia.<br>
<br>
The meeting was broken up by the police, military police, and Minutemen, who arrested thirteen men, most of whom were said to be enemy aliens.  All labor was bitterly Incensed over the actions of the authorities.  The second riot occurred at a meeting held to protest police handling of the first.  As could be exsected in a "free-speech fight," the I.W.W. played a prominent part.<br>
<br>
Five hundred participants listened to radical speeches and sang irreverent I-W-W. songs, while 5,000 spectators looked on.  When the 500 militants began to form up to march on the city jail, mounted police broke up the formation . Such was the mood of Seattle on the eve of the general strike.<br>
<br>
The Seattle Labor Movement while a component part of the A.F. of L., was conspicuous for its differences with Samuel Gompers' leadership on questions of ideology and organization.  Seattle labor felt that the parent body was not sufficiently militant in leading American laboring men to their rightful position in society, although their own concept of what that position should be was hazy.<br>
<br>
Seattle workers were bound by a feeling of solidarity and class
consciousness.  The jargon of class conflict was in constant use.  Many shades of leftist opinion flourished and were tolerated and protected.  Although the I.W.W. was a rival organization, the Wobblies were considered fellow workers, and, when they got into trouble, they were often defended by the Seattle A.F. of L. group.<br>
<br>
It is clear, however, that beyond being generally attracted to the left, the workingmen of Seattle were not doctrinaire; in fact, they were too eclectic.  Labor circles were in a constant ferment over leftist ideas, many of which conflicted with each other.  Seattle workers were unsophisticated in their understanding of im-
ported leftist ideologies.<br>
<br>
For example, although they were enthusiastic supporters of the Bolshevik Revolution, their acquaintance with Marxist and Leninist thought was only in attenuated form.  A pamphlet, published by the Rand School of Social Science in New York,. with detailed notes by Alexander Trachtenberg, explaining such esoteric terms as Bolshevik, Menshevik, the dialectic, and democratic centralism, was republished locally.  But the editor omitted the notes and added simple paragraph headings because she felt the terms explained by Trachtenberg were too complex for local readers.<br>
<br>
The most notable characteristic of Seattle labor's radicalism was the degree to which it wa@s tingibd with pragmatism.  The workinginen were willing to use any device that promised to show up "the interests"; results were the only criterion.  The A.F. of L. men of Seattle used politics, union and cooperative ownership of industry, and direct economic action as tactics.  This sharply differentiated them from the local I.W.W., which would not consider using the "capitalist" political system to promote the workingmen's cause.<br>
<br>
The cooperative movement was considered an important weapon by the Seattle A.F. of L. leaders.  Labor either held shares in or attempted to promote a food market, a laundry, a stevedoring firm, a union theater, and a motionpicture company.<br>
<br>
Seattle labor was distinctly regional in outlook.  The East was identified with the capitalist enemy, as were the conservative elements in the A.F. of L. which kept Samuel Gompers, also an eneniv, in power.  All factions of local A.F. of L. labor were proud of their strong organization.  They recognized it as having a distinct identity.<br>
<br>
No matter where they stood, from left to right on the political spectrum, Seattle workingmen believed that they had more in common with each other than with any other group, either local or national, outside the organization.  For example, F. A. Rust, well
known locally as a labor con servative and custodian of the Labor Temple, maintained that the only difference between Seattle labor conservatives and radicals was a difference in temperament-dictating the choice of different means to achieve a similar end.<br>
<br>
Seattle was also a stronghold for industrial unionism.  Few members could state at a meeting of a local labor group that they were completely happy with the craft structure of the A.F. of L. Most of them were convinced that, with the rise of modem industry employing many different crafts, separate labor organizations along craft lines were inadequate.  Only a minority, however, were willing to organize industrially if they had to disaffiliate with A.F. of L. to do it.<br>
<br>
Many of them wanted bo a new form of organization and a secure position within the A.F. of L. So instead of directly forming the "One Big Union" in each industry they found substitutes that would be adequate until they could "educate" the East to the necessity of a new form of organization.<br>
<br>
One policy was close control of labor locals in the area the Seattle Central Labor Council.  Another tight supervision of allied craft unions by trade councils such as the Metal Trades Council the Building Trades Council.  A third was attempt to negotiate contracts for various working in the same industry so that such contracts would expire simultaneously, thus preventing economic hardship for a nonstriking union man that refused to cross the picket lines of a striking union.<br>
<br>
Although Seattle labor worked together with remarkable unity, there were three distinct wings of labor opinion that they themselves recognized: they called them "conservatives," "radicals," and "progressives."<br>
<br>
The conservatives, while more liberal in outlook than labor conservatives elsewhere, were definitely to the right of the other groups.  They were, as the Wobblies put it, "pie card artists"; that is, they would rather organize and agitate for the full dinner pail than for the larger questions of economic and social justice.  While the I.W.W. judgment was extreme, it contained a germ of truth.  In the Seattle movement, the conservatives were less vocal on the floor of union meetings than were other groups, but they were well represented in official positions in local unions.<br>
<br>
The radicals, to be understood, must be divided into two factions.  Although they were frequently allied on specific issues, there were significant differences between the free-wheeling A.F. of L. radicals with no outside organizational ties and those I.W.W. men,
known as borers, who also held A.F. of L. cards.<br>
<br>
The non-I.W.W. radicals, such as Frank Turco of the Metal Trades Council, Phil Pearl of the Barbers, and Percy May of the Longshoremen, were in the forefront of every attempt to impose radical ideas on the Seattle A.F. of L. organization.<br>
<br>
Their opinions were solicited respectfully by members of organized labor.  But when a pet scheme of a Pearl or a Turco seemed to be leading Seattle  labor  into  difficulty   with   the   A.F. of L.<br>
international unions or with the public men would back down.  They long to push the organization to the internal split, nor were they willing to foment a revolution against public authority.<br>
<br>
Another identifying characteristic of these radicals was their refusal to conduct themselves as an organized faction.  They were a collection of individuals who, although they held similar views, frequently came down on different sides in a controversial issue.<br>
<br>
This was not true of I.W.W. borers.  Their purpose within A.F. of L. was to destroy it and to promote vague but emotional I.W.W. ideology of action and revolution.  They would seldom fundamentally from their I.W.W. brethren on the outside, nor would they desist from agitating, even though it might seem to be hurting the Seattle labor organization.<br>
<br>
Boring reached significant proportions in the shipyard unions.  Some of the labor spies claimed that Wobblies were numerous in Boilermakers Local 104 and the Hope Lodge of Machinists.  They were also said to be relatively strong in the Longshoremen's local.  While numerous I.W.W.'s were in A.F. of L. locals, too frequently the spies lumped independent radicals with borers.<br>
<br>
The I.W.W. borers alone, or in combination with the independent radicals, did not control these orpnnations, nor did they manipulate the general strike from behind the scenes.  Although they tried, the borers and independent radicals could not unseat the conservative and progressive officials who controlled the Boilermakers' and Machinists' unions.<br>
<br>
Concentrated as they were in the shipyard locals already on strike, borers could not directly control the many conservative craft unions which voted to hold a general strike.  The real importance of the I.W.W. two-card men was not their control of the general strike, but their suggesting it as a tactic initially.  Propaganda and agitation, not organization manipulation, were the forte of the I.W.W.<br>
<br>
The borers merely reinforced the effect of the open I.W.W.
organization.  In general, Wobbly propaganda can be credited with familiarizing the A.F. of L. men of Seattle with the concepts of industrial unionism and the general strike.<br>
<br>
The progressives were the controlling element in Seattle labor.  Led by James A. Duncan, secretary of the Central Labor Council, Harry Ault, editor of the Union Recard, and a host of secondary leaders, the progressives in both method and belief stood midway between the<br>
conservatives and the radicals.  Because they were trusted by both sides, they were effective in molding Seattle labor into a united organization.  They were far enough to the left to bring the radicals into the fold and sufficiently moderate not to alienate the conservatives.  They were tough, hardheaded, practical men.  In the main, it was they who gave the Seattle labor movement its reputation for flexibility and pragmatism.<br>
<br>
The progressives led Seattle labor by dominating the Central Labor Council.  Their method was called Duncanism, after the recognized leader of Seattle labor, James A. Duncan.  Through the Central Labor Council, Duncan and his supporters, rather than the officials of the international craft unions, firmly controlled the local Seattle unions.  The Council had so much centralized power that many of the A.F. of L. international union officials complained bitterly that their Seattle locals gave primary loyalty to the Central Labor Council.<br>
<br>
The habit of working together and the confidence that they could rely upon the assistance of other local unions in the area gave Seattle labor a sense of independence.  Duncanism was a substitute for industrial unionism.  Craft exclusiveness, which resulted in factional fights and jurisdictional disputes, was kept to a minimum.<br>
<br>
The Central Labor Council and strong unions would lend money, organizers, and time to weak unions even in other trades.  Seattle laboring men were co ncerned with keeping wages high and working conditions tolerable for all crafts and industries in order to present a united front to the local employers.  As Duncan explains it, he 'had his progressives reject Gompers' craft unionism and strong international union control not merely to prevent local A.F. of L. factions from fighting each other, but also to prevent inroads of the I.W.W. into organized labor.<br>
<br>
Because the I.W.W. was powerful in Seattle and because many members of the local A.F. of L.  would have objected had the Central Labor Council directly attacked so-called fellow workers, Duncan believed the best defense against the I.W.W. was the creation of a rival A.F. of L. organization-internally united, active, and fairly militant-which could hold the loyalty of its
members.", The need not to appear stodgy and conservative accounts in part for the frequency with which fire-breathing resolutions were approved by the Central Labor Council.<br>
<br>
The Council in reality, however, was less militant.  As the radicals later complained, strong resolutions could be passed, but support for them would not be forthcoming through the Council unless "Jimmy" Duncan approved.<br>
<br>
The strength and unity of the A.F. of L. organization in Seattle were bolstered by the support of a labor-owned daily newspaper, the Seattle Union Record.  Established in 1917, the Record gave labor a public voice and had  a devoted following among Seattle workingmen.  Harry Ault, the editor of the newspaper, cooperated with Duncan in promoting the unity of Seattle labor.  The feature editor of the Record was Anna Louise Strong, a young lady of ad-
vanced views and the daughter of a prominent local clergyman.  Of her we shall hear more later.<br>
<br>
The Seattle Shipbuilding Industry boomed during  the  First   World  War. Men   poured   in from  the  hinterlands-farms,   fields,   and  woods to take jobs building the ships needed in the war effort.  In Seattle and vicinity, approximately 35,000 men were employed by shipyards constructing both metal and wooden vessels and by allied industries.  By tacit agreement the ship-
building industry was operated on a closed-shop basis; the men were affiliated with locals under the jurisdiction of the Seattle Metal Trades Council.<br>
<br>
The rapidity of growth of the Seattle labor population caused acute competition for limited facilities.  The new working populace was not enamored of many conditions they found in Seattle-rent gouging, shortage of <B>living </B>space, and high prices.  On the other hand, the older residents were not happy over the newcomerc potential power to change the character of their city.  It was well known that many of the ship yard workers were radicals, that some were secret: I.W.W.'s who took out A.F. of L. cards to <B>get:</B> work, and that "all of them [were] impatient <B>of </B> tradition.<br>
<br>
Their beliefs, however, did not inter their efficiency.  In 1918 ninety-six ocean going vessels aggregating 535,200 dead-weight tons were constructed.  Speed records were  seventy-eight days were necessary to ready a metal, freighter for war <B>service.</B><br>
<br>
During the course of the war, shipyard disputes over wages, hours, or working conditions were not handled directly by unions and man.. agement.  In August, 1917, the Shipbuilding Labor Adjustment Board or Macy Board, named after its chairman, V. Everit Macy, was
created by agreement among the United States Emergency Fleet Corporation, the Navy Department and the international presidents of the shipyardi unions, to handle such matters.<br>
<br>
Because of war, the Seattle shipyard workers did not strike although they were extremely bitter over manner in which the Board handled the  question. But when the fighting stopped, no longer felt constrained by their no-strike pledge.<br>
<br>
Twice in 1917 the Macy Board authorized wage increases for West Coast shipyards in attempt to keep up with the rising cost of <B>living</B> The Seattle shipyard workers contended that the increases were both insufficient and unfair for three reasons.<br>
<br>
(1) Increases granted in 1917 based on wages paid for nongovernmental tract work in Seattle during 1916, when some the unions were well organized and satisfied conditions while other unions were poorly organized and dissatisfied.  Labor claimed that<br>
although the 1917 Macy awards increased wages to an average 60 cents per hour, in some cases they actually decreased the wages weak unions.  This disproportionate increase probably resulted from the fact that most of the weak unions had improved their wages over the, 1916 scale used by the Macy Board.<br>
<br>
(2) The wage scales laid down by the Board were viewed as the minimum wage when labor agreed abide by Board decisions.   They later hardened into maximum wages, as the Board sought use its wage-determining powers as a device to curb rival employers from luring skilled men with the promise of better wages.  Labor resented ,the fact that the government was preventing it from getting the best terms possible.<br>
<br>
(3) The Macy Board tried to standardize wages nationally.  Since wages had traditionally been higher in the Northwest than in the East, the Board, in making its award, granted Northwest labor a smaller wage increase than it gave workers in eastem shipyards.  Because prices <B>in </B>the Northwest also were higher, Seattle labor claimed that it had been discriminated against.  It was even rumored that Charles Piez, director of the Emergency Fleet Corporation, deliberately rigged the wage,scale against Seattle labor on orders from eastern capitalists, who feared the competition of efficient and well-paid Seattle labor.<br>
<br>
Piez was supposed to have been rewarded for his efforts with stock in the Hog Island shipyard in Philadelphia.<br>
<br>
After the Armistice, Seattle labor hoped it could get a reexamination of the Macy Board decisions.  The Seattle Metal Trades Council, which negotiated for all craft unions represented in the shipyards, sent its president, James A. Taylor, to Washington to appear in person before. the appeal board of the
Emergency Fleet Corporation.<br>
<br>
The appeal board deadlocked on the question of overruling the 'Macy award.  Taylor, however, thought that he had received verbal permission to negotiate directly with the Seattle shipyard managements on the condition that any wage increases granted would not be reflected in the price of the ships for which the government had contracted.  This permission was later withdrawn, although actually, contrary to Taylor's assumption, it had never been granted.<br>
<br>
In preparation for negotiating with the shipyard management, the Metal Trades Council authorized a strike vote in November, 1918.  A majority of the crafts concerned (as required by the A.F. of L. constitution for an industry-wide strike), as well as a majority of the total number of men involved, voted in favor of striking.<br>
<br>
The results were kept secret for over a month in the hope that the employers' ignorance would prevent them from agreeing among themselves on a united policy toward labor's demands.  Bert Swain, secretary of the Metal Trades Council, later admitted that this maneuver was a mistake.  It lent credence to the supposedly managementinspired rumors that the men did not know the issues upon which they were voting.<br>
<br>
On January 16, 1919, the Metal Trades Council began its negotiations with the yard rnanagements.  Labor demanded  $8.00 per day for mechanics, $7.00 for specialists,  $6.00 for helpers, and  $5.50 for manual laborers.  The managements of yards that constructed metal vessels offered the Metal Trades negotiators a wage increase to 861/2 cents per hour for skilled workers, but would not consider any increase for the unskilled.  The offer was rejected and the strike mandate put into effect, amid local press accolades for the skilled laborers, who generously would not abandon their less skilled brothers.<br>
<br>
Before the Metal Trades unions could strike or management make a revised offer, the United States government-in the person of Charles Piez-intervened to upset the collective bargaining process.  Piez sent a telegram to the employers' Metal Trades Association, which, because of an error by the messenger boy, was received instead by the workers' Metal Trades Council. The contents of the telegram infuriated labor Piez had threatened to cut off the employers' supply of steel if they acceded to labor's demands.<br>
<br>
The Metal Trades Council immediately denied Piez's right to intervene.  It stated that it was not bound by the Macy award because that award was illegal.  The agreement to set up and abide by the decisions of the Shipbuilding Labor Adjustment Board was entered into by the international craft presidents, the Metal Trades Council claimed, in contravention of the A.F. of L.
constitution, which specified that agreements made by international unions did not bind locals without their consent.<br>
<br>
Because of the war, the Council explained, the metal trades of Seattle had been willing to abide by the decisions of the Board, but after the Armistice a new situation was at hand, and they no longer felt bound.<br>
<br>
It has never been authoritatively determined what instigated Charles Piez to take a hand in the Seattle shipyard dispute.  Was it the eastern capitalists, as labor alleged? Or did Piez do so on his own misunderstanding of the nature of the struggle 3,000 miles away? There is also a third possibility.  It was well known that the open-shop movement had begun to wax strong in the Northwest.211 QUite possibly the shipyard owners requested Piez's assistance in order to have an excuse for not negotiating.<br>
<br>
This last possibility was uppermost in the minds of labor.  Fear that management had embarked on the first round of an open-shop struggle, backed by the power and authority of the United States government, was the main reason that even conservatives among Seattle labor were willing to go so far as to stage a general strike.<br>
<br>
Employer obstinacy, exacerbated by Piez's telegram, encouraged labor to believe that its demands would be met only through its power to halt production.  On January 21 the shipyards closed down completely.  Some 28,000 men'filed silently out of the gates.  There was no violence.  Because emotions ran high over labor's fear of the forces it believed it faced, the Metal Trades Council went to great lengths to control the strikers.  It banned any gatherings, demonstrations, or parades by its members.<br>
<br>
The conservative press of Seattle also took the strike calmly, even though it realized that the Emergency Fleet Corporation would be forced by its position on the strike to cancel local contracts.  The calm that greeted the strike unnerved labor, which expected more concern and immediate negotiation.  Instead, the employers refused to negotiate, and some of them left town to go on vacation.31, Behind the scenes, however, the employers were counterattacking.<br>
<br>
According to labor representatives, management began to spread rumors that the strike was not favored by the rank and file.  Foremen circulated petitions asking for a re-vote on the strike referendum.  The allegation that the Metal Trades Council had secretly rejected a compromise wage proposal offered by management was flatly denied by A. E. Miller of the Metal Trades Council.  Labor was also harassed by a police raid on the Cooperative Food
Products Association, which had extended the strikers credit after the Seattle Retail Grocers Association had refused them.<br>
<br>
When the police raided the Coop on the pretext of looking for illegal liquor, labor saw this as an obvious attempt to cripple the st power of the strikers<br>
<br>
On January 25 the situation was still in mate; management refused to negotiate, labor refused to return to work.  Henry local representative of the United States Department and Immigration Bureau, ofl mediate, but his efforts came to nought. however, realized that it had to scotch mors of nonsupport from the rank and fil( erm akers Local 104, the largest union shipyards, held a meeting which was atter 6,000 of its members.  With three rousing according to the Union Record, they vote continue the strike.<br>
<br>
Labor needed great "solidarity" to hold against the opposing forces.  Charles Piez entered the fray, indicating the implacable hostility of the United States government to any compromise over the terms of the Macy award.  He bombarded the shipyard owners with telegrams ordering them to stand fast.  He continued to show the unalterable opposition of the Emergency Fleet Corporation to the settlement of the shipyard strike on any but its own terms.<br>
<br>
Later, in a series of paid advertisements in Puget Sound newspapers, Piez urged the workers to retum to Tneir jobs, but he did not offer them any conc@ ns in exchange. Management complied with nis order to stand fast, but labor persisted in defying his plea to return to work.  The result was the use of a weapon virtually unknown in American labor history-the general strike.<br>
<br>
A proposal to call a general strike to enforce labor's demands was first made by A. E. Miller at the regular meeting of the Central Labor Council on January 22, 1919.  A resolution requesting that the local unions hold referendums on striking in sympathy with the shipyard workers was approved, with only one dissenting vote, . a wild, tumultuous meeting that could not be controlled by the presiding officers.  It was made so by the Wobblies, who packed the public galleries and enthusiastically applauded every radicai speech, and by the absence of most of the important leaders of the labor movement, who in Chicago for the Mooney Conference.<br>
<br>
The following evening, a mysterious show of support for a general strike began to form. At their regular Thursday night meetings, local unions voted to strike.  The unanimity sentiment and the rapidity of assent was astonishing.<br>
<br>
In the face of all expectations to contrary, this sentiment continued to grow at this early stage, however, the conservative local press could not conceive of labor resorting the use of a general strike.  The Seattle Times  editorially:
A general strike directed at WHAT? The Government of the United States? Bosh!<br>
<br>
Not 15% of Seattle laborites would consider such a proposition<br>
<br>
They were wrong--more and more locals quickly indicated approval of a general strike.<br>
<br>
On the strength of the strike sentiment, a initial meeting of union executives was held Frebray 27; the purpose was to canvass their unions on the advisability and practicability calling a general strike.  These officials were convened because they were not ordinarily deletes to the Central Labor Council, where the initial decision to put the general strike to a rank-and-file vote was made.<br>
<br>
The union execuives aligned themselves into three groups: (1) hose who wanted a general strike immediately; (2)  those who were willing to hold a general trike only after an evident open-shop move by employers; and (3) those who, because of their belief in the inviolability of contract, were unwilling to hold a general strike under present conditions.  Those who expressed outright anti:general-strike opinions were in the minority.<br>
<br>
But whether or not they approved the strike, the executives had no direct power to halt the referendum.  While each could attempt to exercise his personal influence over his local's vote, the executives as a group could merely set in motion machinery to handle a general strike if a majority of locals voted in favor of holding one.<br>
<br>
Thus they agreed that if by Sunday, February 2, a majority of the unions which had held referendums voted for a general strike, a mass meeting of unions favoring the strike should be convened to decide finally on holding a strike of all Seattle labor.<br>
<br>
Opponents of labor unwittingly helped assure labor's approval of a general strike.  Edwin Selvin, owner and publisher of the Business Chronicle, a weekly newspaper, and violent opponent of organized labor, began inserting a series of full-page paid advertisements in the three nonlabor-owned Seattle daily newspapers.<br>
<br>
In the first of these, Selvin proposed that all labor "agitators" be replaced on the job by returning veterans.  He advocated that employers tum Seattle, "the most labor tyrannized city in America," into a bastion of the open shop. Labor was convinced that the expected all-out effort to destroy organized unionism in
Seattle had begun.<br>
<br>
Night after night, as locals held their meetings, votes for a general strike continued to roll in.  Old and conservative craft unions such as the Cooks, House Painters, and Carpenters voted overwhelmingly for the strike.  When a majority of the 1,700-man Teamsters and Auto Truck Drivers Local 174 voted "yes," it was a virtual certainty that a general strike would be held.<br>
<br>
On January 28, at a meeting of the Central Labor Council, twenty-three locals reported that their members were willing to strike en masse.  While the debate on the floor was at times acri-
monious, it was handled better than in the previous Council meeting, because the leaders of the labor movement, having returned from the Mooney Conference, were once again attempting to resume control.40 But beyond restoring decorum, they were only partially successful.<br>
<br>
The essential question of whether to hold the strike was out of their hands-the matter had gone too far.  The radicals, who approved of the strike, could merely attempt to lead what had begun without them.  The conservatives opposed a general strike under any circumstances, but their influence corresponded closely to their limited numbers.<br>
<br>
While the progressives had neither ethical nor ideological compunctions about calling a general strike, most of them feared the consequences of the unrestricted use of so unusual a weapon.  Many of them believed that some type of nonviolent but dramatic demonstration was necessary to counter the growing anti-labor agitation of local capital.<br>
<br>
They did not fear a general strike if they, the progressives, Planned and controlled it, but a strike or demonstration led by any other group, they felt, would get out of hand.<br>
<br>
The progressives or Duncanites, the cement holding the union movement together, were presented with a dilemma.  For the first time they lost control of the movement; the rank and file seemed to have gone over to the radicals.<br>
<br>
It was beyond the power of the progressives to stop the agitation for the general strike; and without risking loss of respect among the majority of laboring men, they could not openly oppose it.  On the other hand, their lack of enthusiasm for the general strike prevented them from making a strong bid to regain their leadership of the labor movement in this moment of crisis.<br>
<br>
Instead, they merely attempted to act as informal advisers to the elected strike leaders to prevent them from doing anything rash.<br>
<br>
This split vastly complicated the problem of setting clear and
attainable goals for the strike.  The conservatives totally opposed the strike and were of no assistance in formulating its goals.  The ends sought by the progressives were rather negative-to show sympathy with the shipyard workers without allowing the strike to become uncontrollable and, therefore, a danger to the existence of the labor movement itself.<br>
<br>
The expectations of the radicals were grandiose.  For all their a itational propaganda about general strikes, the radicals did not understand their own tactic.<br>
<br>
The revolutionaries among them hoped would be the beginning of the revolution in America, but for turning strike into revolution they had neither program, strategy, nor men in the key leadership positions.<br>
<br>
After the workingmen laid down their tools, these leaders hoped that revolutionary spontaneity would finish the job.  Those radicals who had no love for the capitalist system, but who were not willing to shed blood to destroy it, wanted to use the new weapon to strike blindly at all enemies of labor.  They wanted the general strike to be directed against the corruption of capitalism, the perfidy of the government, the greediness of the ship. yard owners, and the machinations of employers who were trying to establish the open shop in Seattle.<br>
<br>
They also wanted to reward their friends. ln addition to assisting the shipyard workers in their strike, they wanted to interpose the grievances of non-shipyard unions into a general strike settlement.<br>
<br>
This move was spearheaded in a Central Labor Council meeting by the Longshoremen and the Barbers It was heatedly opposed by the Metal Trades Council representatives, who, although reputed to be radical, feared that the focus of the impending general strike would be shifted from the shipyard strike to matters irrelevant to them.  The progressives, led by Duncan, trying to prevent further complication of an already confusing situation, gave them support and helped line up a sufficient number uncommitted unions to defeat the resolution.<br>
<br>
This was only the first in a series of failures to define labor's terms for the settlement of the general strike.  Labor's inability to state why and for what it was striking was the major reason for the strike's subsequent collapse<br>
<br>
The crisis had been reached.  The local press finally recognized that agitation for a general strike would not evaporate and that Seattle might soon face a situation experienced by no other major
city in the United States.  New mediation schemes were hastily proposed to avert the strike.<br>
<br>
They were spoiled, however, when Henry White, the first mediator, was quoted by the Seattle Times as saying that the shipyard strike vote was not honest and that the gencral-strike vote probably was not either.  The labor-owned Union Record replied with a violent attack on White's integrity.  Although the following day White claimed that he had been incorrectly quoted, his usefulness was at an  end.  After this embarrassing incident, labor would put no credence in the claims of other would-be mediators.<br>
<br>
The uncommitted were becoming frightened and the committed more obdurate.  Edwin Selvin inserted a new paid advertisement in the major Seattle dailies which further inflamed local opinion.  The newspapers were convinced that a zeneral strike would bring disaster to the community.  The Seattle Times claimed that the city would be destitute in forty-eight hours, with babies and hospitals having to do without milk and bakeries without flour.  Outright starvation was predicted for Alaska.<br>
<br>
To prevent the feared consequences of a complete work stoppage, a new, hastily formed conciliation organization-the Industrial Relations Committee-began to negotiate with labor and with shipyard managements to settle the one concrete cause of the general strike-labor's demands in the shipyards.  Spokesmen for this group were the Rev.  Mark A. Matthews, Seattle's best-known clergyman, and James W. Spangler, president of the Seattle National Bank.<br>
<br>
The conciliatory efforts of the Industrial Relations Committee, however, were to no avail.  So many local unions had approved a strike vote that there was no question that the mass meetL ing sought by union executives for February 2 would be held.  The 300 delegates began their discussions early in the morning and did not<br>
finish until late that night.<br>
<br>
During the morning, credentials were accepted and a date set for the strike-February 6 at ten o'clock in the morning.  The afternoon and evening sessions were concerned with setting up machinery for running the strike.<br>
<br>
The group constituted itself the General Strike Committee and took from the Central Labor Council complete responsibility for the strike.  Because of its unwieldy size, the General Strike Committee could not handle directly all the dayto-day detail work.  Instead, it created an Executive Committee of fifteen members responsible to it, which would act in its behalf.  None of the fifteen was a local union official; only two were known as radicals.  
This Executive Committee, through its subcommittees, was primarily concerned with one of the most controversial aspects of the strike: the question of which individuals, trades, and institutions would be exempt from the effects of the strike.<br>
<br>
The members of the Executive Committee realized the difficulty of their assigned task.  Even before the meeting of the large General Strike Committee had been adjourned, the Executive Committee began its deliberations.  Before the general strike was over, its subcommittees had handled hundreds of requests for keeping es-
sential facilities operating: it had set up cafeterias to feed those who could not eat at home; it got fuel and laundry to hospitals, mail delivered, government cargo unloaded, milk stations set up in residential districts; it secured emergency transportation and fire protection.  In addition, it established a law-and-order subcommittee chaired by F. A. Rust.<br>
<br>
Rust advertised in the Union Record for volunteers among the war veterans in the labor movement to join the Labor War Veterans Guard.  This organization did an admirable job in preventing laboring men from getting out of hand.  They broke up crowds; they urged the workingmen to keep their tempers and continually admonished them to keep the peace so that there would be no excuse to use the army to repress the strike with force.<br>
<br>
The Executive Committee meeting of February 4 was of major significance to the history of the strike.  During the meeting James A. Duncan, Harry Ault, and Robert Heskcth, later a member of the City Council, tried to urge the committee to adopt a definite time limit for the strike.  They did not view the strike as the beginning of the revolution in America, but they realized that others might see it as such if there were no time limit.<br>
<br>
They did not care how long the strike lasted-twelve, twenty-four, forty-eight,seventy-two hours, or a week-so long as the s<br>
general public knew that thcre was a predetermined end.<br>
<br>
According to Duncan, the three did well in presenting their case before the committee during the afternoon.  However, they committed the tactical error of not asking for a vote before the supper recess.  This break allowed the radical opponents of the measure to rally their forces.  When the committee reconvened, Duncan, Ault, and Hesketh lost support of two key groups which had favored their position during the afternoon session-the Longshoremen and the Metal Trades Council representatives .<br>
<br>
The progressives tried to regain their position by further persuasion, but when the vote was taken late at night, the measure was defeated by a narrow margin.<br>
<br>
As the date  approached for all union men to walk off their jobs,
wide apprehension became evident in Seattle.  The newspapers, which had previously been only mildly unhappy about the shipyard strike and did not believe a general strike possible, began to get panicky and flatly characterized the strike as an attempt at revo-
lution.<br>
<br>
An incident which exposed their latent fears was the distribution on downtown streets of a radical leaflet, "Russia Did It," by Wobbly Walker C. Smith, which advocated the confiscation of means of production .<br>
<br>
Although the leaflet was disavowed by organized labor, it was widely believed to be part of the Strike Committee's official propaganda . The most extreme critic of labor's use of the general strike among the newspapers was the Seattle Star, once labor's friend.  The Star's anti-labor stand was an <B>im</B>portant factor in turning the public against the strikers.<br>
<br>
Opposition to the general strike more solid than newspaper rhetoric was forming rapidly.<br>
<br>
The Industrial Relations Committee, after its failure at conciliation, now became the Citizens Committee.  It switched from conciliating labor to opposing it, and soon became the most effec-
tive force in the community pressuring labor to end the strike.  Its representatives, Matthews and Spangler, now had the backing of thirty-six powerful civic, fraternal, and professional organiza-
tions, whose members were among the most influential men in the city.<br>
<br>
As if to justify all that newspapers, civic luminaries, and ordinary citizens feared about the strikers' motives, the Union Record on February 4 published what was to become the most famous document of the general strike-Anna Louise Strong's editorial "No One Knows<br>
Where."   This   editorial was seized upon  by opponents of   the   strike   as   proof   that    labor    meant to  confiscate private property and begin a revo-lution.<br>
<br>
It said, in part:<br>
<br>
We are undertaking the most tremendous move ever<br>
made by LABOR in this country, a move which will lead<br>
<br>
NO  ONE  <B>KNOWS  WHERE  .  .   .   LABOR   WILL   </B>FEED   THE<br>
PEOPLE . . . . <B>LABOR WILL CARE FOR THE </B>BABIES AND <B>THE</B><br>
SICK....... LABOR WILL PRESERVE ORDER. . . . A few hotheaded enthusiasts have complained that strikers only should be fed, and the general public left to endure severe discomfort.  Aside from the inhumanitarian char. acter of such suggestions, let us get this straight-NOT THE <B>WITHDRAWAL OF LABOR POWER, </B>BUT THE POWER OF THE <B>STRIKERS TO MANAGE WILL WIN THIS STRIKE....</B>
<br>
The closing down of the capitalistically controlled industries of Seattle, while the WORKERS ORGANIZE to feed the people, <B>to </B>care for the babies and the sick, to preserve order-this will move them, for this looks too much like the taking over of Power by the workers.<br>
<br>
Labor will not only <B>SHUT DOWN </B>the industries, but Labor <B>Will REOPEN, </B>under the management of the appropriate trades, such activities as are needed to preserve public health and public peace.  If the strike continues, Labor may feel led <B>to </B>avoid public suffering by reopening more and more activities. Under <B>ITS OWN MANAGEMENT.</B><br>
<br>
And that is why we say that we are starting on a road that leads-No ONE KNOWS WHERE!<br>
<br>
This was an artful document.  The mays, mights, and humanitarian sentiments expressed by Miss Strong were later important in saving hcr from a conviction for sedition.  More important, however, was the fact that this editorial was the  major   statement   in   justification   of   the   general strike.  Although it ran a full page, Miss Strong never mentioned what the goals of the strikers were, what their terms were, or against whom the strike was directed-shipyard owners, oven-shop advocates, all Northwest employers, the United States government?<br>
<br>
Did the editorial mean revolution? The real message of this con-
fusing editorial was the total confusion among tne strikers over their aims-no one did know where!<br>
<br>
But opponents of the strike believed that they knew where-straight to revolution, and they said so. ln its last edition before the strike, the Star ran an editorial (February 5) condemning the strike as a revolution.  The nonlabor population of Seattle was now thoroughly aroused.<br>
<br>
One other major event exacerbated community fears and made the charge of revolution wem tenable-the apparent determination of the strikers to shut down the municipally owned light plant.  Leon Green, business agent of Electrical Workers Local 77, stated that he intended to pull all union workers out of the City Light plant; no exemptions were to be made to provide power for hospitals, food-storage facilities, or street lights.  Green is reported to have said, "We shall place the city in such a position that the strike will last but a few short days."<br>
<br>

Understandably, this caused a wave of public revulsion over the methods supposedly adopted by the strikers.  Green and Mayor Ole Hanson had a running fight over this issue for several days.  Actually, Green was bluffing, for he did not have the power to close down the light plant.  His Local 77 was composed of outside linemen;' he had no jurisdiction over the organized laborers who worked inside the plant. But neither Mayor Hanson nor his superintendent of City Light, J. D. Ross, realized that Green was incapable of carrying out his threats.<br>
<br>
Ross organized a volunteer crew of Western Electric Company engineers to take over the operation of the plant if necessary.  Hanson then approached James A. Duncan in an attempt to persuade him to allow the lights to remain burning.  Duncan, although he was working closely with the Executive Committee, told Hanson that the regular labor leadership was not in charge of the strike and that only the Executive Committee of Fifteen had the power to grant his request.<br>
<br>
Hanson, known locally as an erratic down with a not overlarge amount of backbone, was in this instance under heavy pressure to insist that City Light supply most of its usual services' The electricians remained obdurate-an impasse had been reached.<br>
<br>
Late during the night before the strike, the Executive Committee made a major effort to resolve the question.  Both Hanson and the Electricians' representatives were invited to a hastily called committee meeting.  The Electricians, under pressure by subcommittees of the Executive Committee and the Metal Trades Council to modify their position, were willing to allow the City Light plant to operate-on the condition that an exemption committee sit in the plant to decide on each exemption individually.<br>
<br>
Hanson would not agree to this stipulation and walked out of the meeting, threatening to run the light plant with soldiers if he had to.  After further debate, the Executive Committee realized that it would have to override the objections of the Electricians.  A representative of the committee telephoned Hanson when he returned to City Hall to inform him that, with the face-saving exception of commercial service, the light plant could operate at full capacity.<br>
<br>
Ole Hanson, however, had other plans.  He had sworn in extra police.  He had "kept the phone hot" between his office and the Governor's, requesting the services of the National Guard.  But, Henry Suzzallo, president of the University Washington and wartime chairman of the State Council of Defense, and Vaughn Tanner, attorney general, who had informally taken the powers of ailing
Governor Ernest Lister, phoned Secretary of War Newton Baker for federal troops.<br>
<br>
Army trucks rumbled through le streets at dawn on February 6. Machine were set up at strategic points around the The opponents of labor's move into the own were ready.<br>
<br>
At the ten o'clock deadline  all union work ceased in Seattle.  Very little activity not specifically allowed by the Executive Committee was carried on.  Of the few vehicles on the street that morning, most displayed the sign "Exempt by order of the Strike Committee." An ominous quiet prevailed.  The normal police docket of 100 cases a day fell to thirty during the strike.  This was to be the mood of the general strike.<br>
<br>
The abnormal urban quiet helped breed <B>ru</B>mors.  It was said that strikers had dynamited the city water supply dam, that Ole Hanson had been assassinated, that private property had been confiscated, that buildings were being blown up, that the army had turned its guns on the strikers.  It was also reported that a number of well-to-do Seattle families had left the city as a precaution-<br>
ary measure.<br>
<br>
This  latter  move proved unnecessary, however; neither life  nor     property was in danger. There was  no  violence,     and    all   essential services remained in  operation.<br>
<br>
At first the strike machinery bogged down in a few spots, but it was not long before the initial mistakes were corrected.  No one starved, and children got their milk.  Considering that labor had to create ad hoc organizations to feed the city and maintain essential services, its strike machinery was astonishingly efficient.  Thirtyfive milk-dispensing stations were set up in the residential districts of the city; twenty-one cafeterias serving meals to strikers and nonstrikers alike were created.  Hospitals were provided with fresh linen, fuel, and services.<br>
<br>
At the outset of the strike, some local newspapers were able to publish abbreviated editions because the international officers of the printing trades forced the Seattle locals to remain on the<br>
job.  Their distribution systems were disrupted, however, and they were put into the position of having to give away copies at the plant doors.  The message in all editions was substantially the same: the general strike was an attempted revolution.<br>
<br>
On the first day of the strike, the large General Strike Committee assembled for the second time.  Its members expected to assume the responsibility for running the strike.  Again it was too large and unwieldy to make decisions effectively; it merely approved decisions already made by the Executive Committee and requested
that the fifteen members continue to take care of exemptions.<br>
<br>
The General Strike Committee could feel proud of the way its elected leaders had handled the strike, which had come off smoothly and completely.  For all the fulminations of the newspapers and the emergency preparations of Ole Hanson and the army, no active attempt had yet been made to break the strike.<br>
<br>
The first blow was to descend the next day, Friday, February 7. Hanson issued a proclamation published in a free edition of the Star and distributed by trucks mounting machine guns.  In it the mayor promised protection to all the people of Seattle.  He threatened all persons violating the law with summary punishment.  Sometime later, although the people of Seattle saw no evidence that the strike was collapsing, Hanson released a statement to the United Press claiming that he had suppressed a Bolshevik revolution.<br>
<br>
Hanson's great deeds were yet to be performed.  Rather than risk trouble by attempting to suppress the strike forcibly, Hanson ordered the labor leaders to call it off.  Over the telephone he boldly demanded that James A. Duncan end the strike by noon of that day, Friday.  Again, Duncan claimed he lacked authority to control the strike.  Hanson then requested that Duncan bring the Executive Committee to his office.<br>
<br>
Contrary to his boast that he refused "to treat with these revolutionists," Hanson offered in exchange for an end to the strike his personal pledge to go to Washington to plead the ship-
yard workers' case.  He threatened, however, that if they did not send the men back to work, he would call in the army.<br>
<br>
A labor delegation was informed by Major General John F. Morrison, commander of Federal troops in Seattle, that Hanson did not have the power to declare martial law.  Even so, Hanson's maneuvering had left the Executive Committee in a dilemma.  Although they realized they had to save face, they also knew the strike could not last indefinitely.<br>
<br>
If they ended the strike without gaining more concessions than Hanson was in a position to offer, they feared that internal dissension would disintegrate the labor movement.  On the other hand, if they did not end the strike on the unfavorable conditions offered, it might be repressed by force.<br>
<br>
The heart of the dilemma was that goals for the strike had never been defined.  The Executive Committee, therefore, did not have a set of concrete terms they knew would be acceptable to the rank and file.  Hoping to get a better offer than Hanson's, the committee began to dicker with Matthews and Spangler of the Citi-
zens Committee.  
These gentlemen felt they could not commit their organization without canvassing the opinions of its members.  The reply of the Citizens Committee, communicated by Matthews and Spangler to the Executive Committee that evening, was disastrous for labor.  They were informed that because the members of the Citizens Committee considered the strike a revolutionary attempt, it would not bargain on surrender terms.<br>
<br>
Hanson was no longer offering a compromise one moment and a threat the next.  He knew now which way to jump.  The most influential elements in the community were unalterably opposed to the strike; therefore, so would Ole Hanson be.  He sent a formal notice to the Strike Committee, delivered by his secretary, ordering it to call off the strike by eight o'clock the next morning, Saturday, February 8. If they did not comply, he would "take advantage of the protection offered this city by the national government.' '<br>
<br>
His timing proved excellent.  After two heady days of labor's demonstrated ability to halt the economic life of the city, many of the strikers began to lose their enthusiasm.  It was becoming evident that they had no tangible goals or conditions which, if met, could lead to a labor victory.  Moreover, their confusion over what they were striking for made it difficult to explain away the charge that the general strike was a revolution.<br>
<br>
The eight o'clock deadline passed, and the Executive Committee took no action to halt the strike.  Hanson's peremptory order forced the committee into a position where it now could not advocate ending the strike, even though co nservative and progressive clements had earlier backed just such a move.  Nevertheless, its resolve to continue the strike could not long remain unbroken.  The unity of the strikers had begun to weaken.<br>
<br>
Several streetcars had begun to run.  Some barbers and restaurant workers returned to their jobs.  The privately owned Puget Sound Traction, Light and Power Company plant was put back into full operation.<br>
<br>
Pressure on the strikers began to mount.  Police arrested Wobbly spokesman Walker C. Smith.  The international officers of many of the A.F. of L. unions insisted either in person or by telegram that their local officers order the men back to work.60 In order to stem the tide, the labor newspaper, the Union Record, which had shut down the first day of the strike, resumed publication on February 8.<br>
<br>
The Executive Committee realized that the break in labor's solid front would make continuation of the strike foolish.  On Saturday afternoon, February 8, it voted 13 to I to call a halt to the general strike at midnight.  The resolution was submitted to the General Strike Committee, but its members refused to pass it.<br>
     
A quiet Sunday helped splinter the resolve of many inactive strikers.  It was a day to think, a day when it was not necessary to resist calling off the strike because of pride.  On Monday morning the General Strike Committee rcconvened.  There were significant gaps in the ranks of the strikers-streetcar men, barbers, stereotypers, teamsters, newsboys, and billposters had returned to work.<br>
<br>
Representatives of other unions announced on the floor of the meeting that the general strike was causing hardship to some of their members.  The strike had disintegrated, and the General Strike Committee knew it.<br>
<br>
The Executive Committee again offered a strike-ending resolution; this time it was quickly accepted.  The resolution, however, attempted to defy those both inside and outside the labor movement who were pressing for an immediate end to the strike.  It specified that the strike was to end at noon on Tuesday, February I 1, and that all those local unions that had returned to work were to come out again so that all members of organized labor could return together.<br>
<br>
The response to the second strike call was less than wholehearted; the teamsters and newsboys responded to the call, but the barbers and streetcar men did not.  At noon on Tuesday it was all over.  As the Star put it, Seattle could go "Full Steam Ahead."<br>
<br>
For "Holy Ole" Hanson, the general strike was a good thing.  Soon after its termination, his office was flooded with congratulatory inessages from all over the country: he was a national hero.<br>
<br>
Ever the opportunist, he resigned his mayoralty in August, 1919, to go on a year-long country-wide lecture tour to tell the people how he beat the "reds." He netted $500 per lecture, $38,000 for the entire tour-a sum five times as large as his mayorally salary of $7,500.  The tour was part of a Hanson presidential boom, as were his book, Americanism versus Bolshevism, and several articles. But the Republicans did not nominate Hanson in 1920.  He returned to Seattle, sold his real-estate holdings, and retired to California.<br>
<br>
As a result of the strike, Seattle labor came upon difficult days.  The newspapers thundered editorially that organized labor must purge its ranks of radicals.  At first the Union Record replied that the labor movement did not need "Big Biz" to tell it how to run its affairs.  But in reality the general strike had destroyed the unity of labor.  It was no longer possible for the progressives to slow down the radicals or speed up the conservatives.  Factionalism broke out, each group vying for control of organized labor.  
Electrical Workers Local 77, its charter revoked by its international, disintegrated.  Boilermakers Local 104 was rent with dissension.  Bitter jurisdictional disputes broke out among various crafts.  And through it all the I.W.W. watched approvingly, hopeful that the A.F. of L. would destroy itself.  With no job control by the A.F. of L., the Wobblies believed they would now be able to organize the workingmen of Seattle.<br>
<br>
The spectical of each faction blaming the other for the strike's unhappy results disillusioned many of the participants.  One very disenchanted radical was Anna Louise StrongWith others of the Union Record staff, she was arrested for the "No One Knows Where" editorial- According to her autobiography, the sedition charge against them was dropped when local Democrats complained to their friends in Washington, D.C., that the arrests would shift Seattle's labor vote to the Farmer-labor party in 1920.<br>
<br>
Soon after, Miss Strong left Seattle for a trip to Russia to renew her faith in proletarian causes.  She was impressed with what she saw . Subsequently she became one of the most important apologists for the Communist cause writing <B>in </B>English.  Her eventual reward for turning out some dozen books and pamphlets lauding Communist achievements and for founding the first English-language newspaper in the Soviet Union was deportation from the "Socialist Motherland" for supposed acts of subversion and espionage. She lives today in Communist China.<br>
<br>
Leon Green also had legal difficulties.  After the strike, a warrant was issued for his arrest, but it was never served.  Said to be of Russian origin, Green, whose real name was reputed to be either Rikowsky or Butowsky, disappeared from the scene as mysteriously as he had appeared.  After February 9 he was never again seen in Seattle .<br>
<br>
The nonlaboring people of Seattle wanted to see someone punished for the general strike, but it was difficult to find a scapegoat.  Police raided the Socialist and I.W.W. halls and arrested thirty-eight Wobblies on suspicion of leading and instigating the general strike.<br>
<br>
It was alleged that leadership of the strike was criminal anarchy.  Prosecutor Fred C. Brown had no proof that the I.W.W. led the strike, however, and the original indictment was dropped.  Then he tried to claim that mere membership in the I.W.W. was illegal under the recently adopted Washington State Criminal Syndicalist Law.  The first Wobbly to be tried under the new indictment, James Bruce, was acquitted.  The remaining imprisoned Wobblies were released.<br>

In the long run, organized labor in Seattle paid heavily for its general strike.<br>
<br>
Immediately after the strike was ended, the Associated Industries of Seattle, a group devoted to fostering the open-shop plan, was formally organized.  Backed by the economic power of its corpora-
tion members, it flooded the labor movement with spies.  It threatened employers in Seattle with withdrawal of supplies if they signed closedshop contracts with unions.  It succeeded in breaking the closed shop of the building trades, tailors, and printers.<br>
<br>
After the strike, jobs were hard to find in Seattle.  The shipyards had closed down.  Although this was inevitable after the Armistice,the strike and Piez's cancellation of govemment contracts made the closure quick and sharp rather than gradual.<br>
<br>
David Rodger, general manager of Skinner and Eddy, hoped to reopen Skinner's No. 2 yard, for which he claimed he had $40 million in orders; but he said that Associaled Industries forced Skinner not to sell him the yard.70 This was the price labor paid for its general strike.<br>
<br>
Was the <B> </B>Seattle General Strike an attempt to overthrow the prevailing political and economic system?<br>
<br>
Was it a revolution? It is evident from the actions of the strikers that it was not.  But there is another important question yet to be answered.  Did a large number of strikers or a significant portion of their leaders intend to stage a revolution and at the last minute, seeing the power of the opposing forces, back down? i think not.  The overwhelming majority of the strikers wanted a vehicle through which they could "let off steam" and vent their fears ana frustrations.<br>
<br>
They could be urged on by I.W.W. propaganda from without and by I.W.W. borers and free-wheeling radicals from within, but they would not be led by them.  They elected an Executive Committee which was conspicuous for its moderation.  Although that committee did not always follow their advice, <B>it </B>was in close consultation with progressive leaders such as Duncan, Ault, and Hesketh throughout the strike.  But the Greens and the Strongs, although they were not at the locus of power, gave the general strike the reputation of a revolution.<br>
<br>
The Seattle General Strike was not a revolution, but it was a revolt-a revolt against everything and therefore a revolt against nothing.<br>
<br>
There were too many enemies to thrust out against for labor to be
able to define the goals of the strike.  This was not unusual; it is in fact typical of nonrevolutionary general strikes called because of the enthusiastic backing of thousands of men.  Only if the goals of nonrevolutionary general strikes are narrowly defined and if they are limited in duration', can they be successful. Without narrow goals understood by striker, opponent, and neutral observer, a strike will be treated as a revolution.<br>
<br>
No one element caused the Seattle General Strike.  It occurred only because there were a multiplicity of causes-I.W.W. propaganda giving Northwest workers name familiarity with thr concept of general strike, the class spirit and advanced opinions of Seattle workers, the einotional impact of the Bolshevik Revolution, gen-
eral world unrest, the obdurate position taken by the shipyard owners, the intervention of Charles Piez and the United States government, the fear of employer support for the growing open-shop movement, agitation of revolutionary and nonrevolutionary radicals among local labor, and the distinctive Seattle A.F. of L. organization led by James A. Duncan and his progresslves that insisted upon all Seattle workers pulling together and provided a vehicle for such unity.<br>
<br>
Separately, not even the dominant causes would have provoked the general strike; rather, <B>it </B>was the combination of extraordinary events and the condition of Seattle labor.<br>
<br>
Perhaps one element more important than any other, the one condition without which the strike could not have occurred, was the form into which the Duncanites had molded Seattle labor.  This strong organization which used the Central Labor Council to dominate local unions and enforced the habit of working together was, if not the powder which caused the explosion, the fuse without which the powder could not be ignited.<br>
<br>
Essentially, the Seattle General Strike . the story of an organization which for a short period was not dominated by its progressive leaders  and  temporarily  got   out   of   control.<br>
<br>
Without Duncan and his cohorts at the helm, the organization became the plaything of momentary passions.<br>
<br>
Paradoxically, the complexity of the causes of the strike, while a precondition for its very occurrence, also prevented the strike from having any chance of success.  When no goals could be stated, when no specific enemies against whom to direct the strike could be named, when no time limit could be set so that the middle  class would not take fright, each individual striker  was a spokesman for the movement as a whole.<br>

The inability of the official strike leaders to make policy was compounded by the variety of statements issued by rank-and-file strikers and unofficial spokesmen for various factions.  Each<br>
man was striking for what he thought important.  In the absence of stated goals and motivated readership, the Seattle General Strike was all things to all men.<br>

<br>
I was also active in the Seattle General Strike of 1919, which involved twenty-seven thousand shipyard workers in Seattle, another ten to fifteen thousand in Tacoma, and some more elsewhere.  The strike was called by the AFL unions, but behind that was the fact that thousands of Iwws had gone to Seattle to get work in the booming shipyards created by World War I.<br>
<br>
There was ideology.  The mood was favorable to action.  My own union was the most left union in the metal trades.  A lot of guys called for the emancipation of the working class.  My foreman was an old-line craftsman and he would interrupt, "Brothers, this union is not for the emancipation of the working class; it's for the emancipation of the machinists' "<br>
<br>
But the crowd paid little attention to that.  The city stopped working.  All the restaurants were closed except for the chains operated by the cooks and waiters unions.  The diet of beef stew, coffee, and pie was a little monotonous; but non-union men got it for thirty-five cents, union members for twenty-five cents, and if you had no money, the meals were free.<br>
<br>
The strike lasted five days.  You can't keep a general strike going for long.  But it was an extraordinary demonstration of solidarity.  Unions established their own municipal functions.  They had their own police.  The union patrolmen with armbands were on all the streets and kept order.<br>
<br>
The government brought in a lot of troops and machine guns but there was nothing for them to do.  One of the most dramatic movements for me was at the start of the strike.  The Seattle Times was an anti-union newspaper.  Its presses were on the street floor behind a long glass window.<br>
<br>
The time for the strike was ten a.m. A friend of mine and I were
looking through the glass, and at ten sharp, those presses rolled to a stop.  What a demonstration of power! Unions had their own daily paper in Seattle for seven or so years, until the mid-1920S.<br>

The Seattle General Strike<br>
<br>
Harvey O'Conner, "The Seattle General Strike," <B>Revolution in Seattle.</B> New York: The Monthly Review Press, 1964, p. 125-145.<br>
<br>
On Armistice Day, 1918, the lid blew off the Seattle labor movement.  Nearly two years of pent-up frustration were released in a storm of emotion.  In that respect Seattle was no different from the rest of the world.  Revolution was the order of the day in Central Europe; the Soviets were battling counter-
revolutionaries and Allied intervention; France and Italy were convulsed; in Britain reconstruction of society was the concern of the Labour Party.<br>
<br>
In the United States great strikes broke out in steel, focus of industrial feudalism, and in the coal mines and on the railroads.<br>
<br>
The same pattern was to be repeated after the Second World War.<br>
Foremost cause of the unrest which swept the country was the constantly soaring cost of living, up 50 percent in three years.  Wages in the basic industries had been held under governmental control but there were few countervailing controls on prices.<br>
<br>
Huge shipments of food and supplies were being sent to starving Europe and the shortages resulting in this country led enterprisers to charge all that the traffic would bear.  At the same time profits were soaring, too, and it was unbearable to thinking workers that the costs of the war should be piled on them while their employers never had it so good.<br>
<br>
In Seattle the high cost of living was an especially exasperating prod.  The Pacific Northwest had always been a high-price region, far off the beaten track of American commerce; costs of transport whether by ship or rail were padded by the extra profits extracted.  Even more than in other sections, the Pacific Northwest regarded itself as in a colonial position, exploited by the Eastern captains of industry.  
The abnormal price situation was exaggerated by the influx of thousands of workers, straining the city's housing and public facilities to the breaking point.  Landlords reaped a bonanza by heaping men and families into the scant housing available.<br>
<br>
Seattle was exceptional also because of the advanced organization of labor - with a total population of 250,000, there were some 60,000 members in unions, flanked as in few other communities by radical wings of the socialists and I.W.W. If a speedy reaction to the release of wartime controls on the right to strike were to be found anywhere in the country, it would logically be in Seattle.<br>
<br>
And that was the fact, proudly reported by Anna Louise Strong just back from the Mooney convention in Chicago.  In the Union Record she wrote that "Seattle is on the map. . . the place where big constructive ideas come from." She was proud that the Mooney meeting had had its genesis in Seattle.<br>
<br>
The 30,000 shipyard workers in the city had been bound by the national A.F. of L. agreement with the War Labor Board which exchanged union recognition for the right to strike in wartime.  While the Metal Trades Council held an overall agreement with the yards, neither that Council nor its 21 constituent unions had any final authority in wartime over the wage scales.<br>
<br>
That authority rested with the Shipbuilding Labor Adjustment Board, usually called the Macy Board, after its chairman, V. Everit Macy.  This had been formed by agreement among the U.S. Emergency Fleet Corporation in charge of shipbuilding, the Navy Department, and the international presidents of the unions involved.  The Seattle unions complained vehemently that the international unions, in violation of their own constitutions, had taken control over wages from the rank and file.<br>
<br>
The Macy Board twice authorized wage increases in 1917.  The unions better organized before the war won an average 60 cents a day rise; those representing mainly the unskilled and semi-skilled, much less.  The increase for some of around 121/2 percent contrasted with a rise in living costs during the period of 31 percent.<br>
<br>
The top wage for shipyard laborers was $4.16 a day, or a little under $100 a month.  The Board's scales were said to be the minimum but in practice they became the maximum and employers were discouraged from paying more.  The Board also tried to equalize wages nationally, which of course was detrimental to the Pacific Northwest, where both wages and prices were traditionally higher than on the East and Gulf coasts.<br>
<br>
Immediately after the Armistice, the Metal Trades Council demanded a general wage readjustment.  Its president, James A. Taylor, went to Washington to confer with Charles Piez, director of the
Emergency Fleet Corporation, and with the Macy Board.  When that Board's appeal committee split on the Seattle wage issue, Taylor returned to Seattle confident that he had permission to negotiate directly with the shipyards, provided that wage increases did not increase the price of shipping to the government.<br>
<br>
A strike vote, preliminary to negotiations, was authorized by the Metal Trades Council in November, 1918, and majorities were received in most unions.  On January 16, 1919, negotiations opened on demands for an $8 scale for mechanics, $7 for specialists, $6 for helpers, and 55.50 for laborers.<br>
<br>
The Council calculated that its wage demands would leave a profit of $200,000 on each ship, as against the existing $286,000 profit, based on an 8,800-ton ship costing $1,350,000 and sold to the government for $1,636,000.  The owners offered increases to the skilled trades but nothing for the unskilled.  The skilled trades joined with the mass of the workers in rejecting the splitting tactic.<br>
<br>
A Western Union messenger boy helped to precipitate the strike.  He bore a telegram addressed to the Metal Trades Association, the employers' body; by mistake he took it to the Metal Trades Council.  Its contents were explosive.  Director Piez of the Emergency Fleet Corporation had cut through any hope of further negotiation by informing the employers that they would get no more steel if they agreed to any wage increases.<br>
<br>
Did Piez act on his own initiative, or was it a double-play between him and the companies? Were the unions up against the government as well as the companies? The Metal Trades Council promptly repudiated the agreement, signed illegally, it claimed, by the chiefs of the national unions without consultation or agreement by the local unions.<br>
<br>
On January 16, 1919, the Council authorized a strike, to begin January 21.  On that day 30,000 men downed tools, augmented by 15,000 in nearby Tacoma.  The yards made no effort to reopen; the unions banned demonstrations, parades, or gatherings, and an unearthly quiet enveloped the yards.  To scotch rumors that many of the men were opposed to the strike, Local 104 of the Boilermakers, which comprised nearly half of all strikers, called a meeting to which 6,000 members responded.<br>
<br>
Dan McKillop, an official, denounced the shipowners who had taken the credit for the ships built by the workers.  "If they think they can build ships, let them go ahead and build them." As for the threat to build ships only in the East, "Well," said McKillop, "let them try it.  If they want to start a revolution, let 'em start it."<br>
<br>
To bring pressure on the strikers, the Retail Grocers Association
decreed that no credit would be extended.  The Cooperative Food Products Association, a cooperative formed by unions and the Grange, answered that food would be available to any striker.  Thereupon the "dry squad" raided the coop on a liquor warrant.  This was an excuse to go through the coop's correspondence and business files, which were confiscated in an effort to put it out of business.<br>
<br>
The stalemate was complete.  The men were adamant; many of the yard bosses had gone to California for a vacation; the government, far from being eager for a settlement, was bombarding the yards with messages to stand firm and resist labor's<br>
demands.<br>
<br>
The idea of a general strike swept the ranks of organized labor like a gale.  If labor was prepared to strike for Tom Mooney, certainly it could strike in support of the shipyard workers.  If the general strike was labor's ultimate weapon, certainly here and now was the time to use it, to break the impending coastwise assault on unionism.  Possibly there had never been a more dramatic meeting of the Central Labor Council than that which convened January 22, the floor jammed with delegates from some 110 local unions, and the gallery filled with unionists.<br>
<br>
Every reference to the general strike was cheered to the echo; the cautions of the conservatives that such a strike was in violation of many international union rules and of contracts with employers were hooted down.  It has been urged since that the absence of some 40 delegates retuming from the Mooney convention gave the "radicals" dominance in the Council's deliberations.<br>
<br>
But most of the Mooney delegates were from the very same shipyard unions that were calling for a general strike; if they were willing to go to Chicago to plan a national strike for Mooney, they would hardly have been reluctant to counsel a general strike in Seattle in support of their own fellow workers.  If anything, the conservative influence was stronger in the Council that night than usual because the delegates who went to Chicago represented the moderate and radical unions.  The conservatives weren't so concerned about Mooney as to travel 2,000 miles to agitate a general strike for him.<br>
<br>
The Council's vote that night to hold a referendum among all local unions on the issue of a general strike won the approval of all delegates but one.  Scholars, writing a generation later, refer to the "mysterious snowball" of assent that was registered on the very next night in eight local union meetings, whose galleries ff any were certainly not "packed" by Wobblies; "the unanimity of sentiment and the rapidity of assent were astonishing." Perhaps now it seems astonishing, but in Post-Armistice Seattle it was
natural and inevitable - this great emotional wave.<br>
<br>
By the weekend it was so obvious that the strike votes would carry in most of the locals that a special meeting was called for Monday, January 26.  There it was agreed that if the votes continued overwhelmingly in favor, another special meeting of union representatives should be called for Sunday, February 2, to decide on action.  The strike votes in the metal trades unions of course were favorable; most of their members were already on strike.  The crucial votes were in the old-established locals of the building, teaming, printing, and service trades.<br>
<br>
But the painters and carpenters and teamsters and cooks also voted "Yes."<br>
<br>
In this they had the unanimous if left-handed support of the business press, which was busy taunting the "radical" leaders of the Central Labor Council that the rank and file, being patriotic Americans, would not strike against the government.  Editorialized the Times: "A general strike directed at WHAT? The Government of the United States? Boshl Not 15 percent of Seattle laborites would consider such a proposition."<br>
<br>
But consider it they did, and with the greatest enthusiasm!' Edwin Selvin's Business Chronicle, spokesman for the open-shop interests which included most of industry and commerce, helped too.  Selvin began inserting lurid advertisements in the business dailies proposing that all radicals be arrested and deported or jailed, that "the most labor-tyrannized city in America" be converted pronto into a bastion of the open shop.<br>
<br>
"Here is <B>Seattle's solutlion</B> to its labor problem: As fast as men strike, replace them with returned soldiers." Even conservative unionists who doubted the wisdom of the general strike recoiled when confronted by such evidence from the implacable class enemy.<br>
<br>
On February 2 the special meeting of union representatives, <B>ihree </B>from each union, voted to set the strike date for Thursday, February 6. This group constituted itself the General Strike Committee and took over from the Central Labor Council complete authority for the strike.  This relieved the Council of direct responsibility for an action which was thoroughly disapproved of by its chartering body, the A.F. of L., and which could result possibly in the revocation of its charter.<br>
<br>
Already the international unions were sending in their officials to hold back local unions which had voted to strike.  An executive committee of 15 was chosen by the general committee to plan the details of the strike.
On the same day an industrial relations committee of businessmen, clergy, and unionists negotiating with the shipyard owners got a promise to raise laborers to $5 a day minimum, but with<br>
no raise for the skilled trades.  The Metal Trades Council spokesmen indicated that the offer could be discussed; but Piez was adamant.  Not a ton of steel would be furnished the shipyards if the Macy award were altered.<br>
<br>
Almost immediately the relevancy of Lenin's speech on management, which had aroused so much discussion among workers, became apparent.  If the strike were to be completely effective, the Ire of a city of 300,000 would grind to a sudden halt, with catastrophic consequences.  If essential services such as light and power, fire protection, hospitals, were to continue, it was up to the Committee of 15 to cope with the problem of civic "manage-
ment."<br>
<br>
Thousands of single workers ate in restaurants; were they to starve during the strike? How about milk for babies? And how was the strike to be policed? Certainly the unionists had little faith in the impartiality of the custodians of law and order.<br>
An even more crucial question came up at the Committee of 15 meeting on Tuesday, February 4. How long would the strike last?<br>
<br>
Was this a demonstration of sympathetic support for the shipyard unions, to be ended as soon as labor had shown where its heart was? Or should it continue until the shipyard owners and the government agreed to confer? The leaders of the Central Labor Council, including Secretary Duncan, Editor Ault, Robert B. Hesketh (a city councilman), and others urged that a time limit be fixed - whether of one day or one week was less important than fixing some terminal date.  But such was the wave of emotion that the proposal was defeated; the General Strike Committee was not yet ready to talk about ending a strike that had not even begun.<br>
<br>
As a matter of cold fact, just what were the aims of the strike? Most unionists saw it as a demonstration of sympathy, calculated <B>to </B>strengthen the arm of the shipyard unions.  Others felt that the first general strike in America would be so conclusive in its show of strength that the walls of Jericho would come tumbling down - not the walls of capitalism, but the walls of pitiless hostility to the earnest demands of the shipyard workers.  For the proposed strike slogan, "We have nothing to lose but our chains<br>
and   a   world   to   gain,"   the   Committee   substituted,<br>
<br>
"Together we win."<br>
<br>
As if to answer the question about aims of the strike, the Union Record on Tuesday, February 4, published the most famous editorial of its entire history - excerpts of which were read by millions across the country, who by now had their eyes riveted on what some
were already proclaiming to be a revolutionary situation.  The editorial, written by Anna Louise Strong and approved by Editor Ault and the Metal Trades Council, read, in part:<br>
<br>
ON THURSDAY AT 10 A.M.<br>
<br>
There will be many cheering, and there will be some who fear.<br>
<br>
Both these emotions are useful, but not too much of either.<br>
We are undertaking the most tremendous move ever made by LABOR in this country, a move which will lead -NO ONE KNOWS<br>
<br>
WHERE.<br>
<br>
We do not need hysteria.<br>
<br>
We need the iron march of labor.<br>
<br>
LABOR WILL FEED THE PEOPLE.<br>
Twelve great kitchens have been offered, and from them food will be distributed by the provision trades at low cost to all.<br>
<br>
LABOR WILL CARE FOR THE BABIES AND THE SICK.<br>
<br>
The milk-wagon drivers and the laundry drivers are arranging<br>
plans for supplying milk to babies, invalids and hospitals, and taking care of the cleaning of linen for hospitals.<br>
<br>
LABOR WILL PRESERVE ORDER.<br>
<br>
The strike committee is arranging for guards, and it is expected that the stopping of the cars will keep people at home.<br>
<br>
A few hot-headed enthusiasts have complained that strikers only should be fed, and the general public left to endure severe discomfort.  Aside from the inhumanitarian character of such suggestions, let them get this straight -<br>
<br>
NOT THE WITHDRAWAL OF LABOR  POWER,  BUT  THE  POWER  OF  THE<br>
STRIKERS TO MANAGE WILL WIN THIS STRIKE....<br>
<br>
The closing down of Seattle's industries, as a MERE SHUTDOWN, Will
not affect these eastern gentlemen much.  They could let the whole northwest go to pieces, as far as money alone is concerned.<br>
BUT, the closing down of the capitalistically controlled industries of Seattle, while the WORKERS ORGANIZE to feed the people, to care for the babies and the sick, to preserve order - THIS will move them, for this looks too much like the taking over Of POWER by the workers.<br>
<br>
Labor will not only sIiUT DOWN the industries, but Labor will REOPEN, under the management of the appropriate trades, such activities as are needed to preserve public health and public peace.  If the strike continues, Labor may feel led to avoid public suffering by reopening more and more activities,<br>
<br>
UNDER ITS OWN MANAGEMENT.<br>
<br>
And that is why we say that we are  starting  on  a  road  that  leads  -<br>
<br>
NO ONE KNOWS WHERE.<br>
<br>
It could be said that the editorial contained no clearcut answers to the questions about the purpose of the strike.  Or rather it might be more correct to say that people could draw their own answers, to please their own interpretation.  To most unionists the editorial stated plainly what was intended: that the city would be shut down but that essential services for life and security would continue.<br>
<br>
But others could read in ominous ideas that the workers, having shut down the industries, would reopen them on their own terms.  Most of all the phrase that "we are Starting on a road that leads - NO ONE KNOWS WHERE," created an alarm that Seattle labor was leading down the road to revolution.  But the sentence meant exactly what it said - this was the first use of the general strike weapon anywhere in America, and who could foretell the outcome?<br>
<br>
Undoubtedly, in Miss Strong's mind, there were the undertones of Lenin's speech on worker management but such notions were hardly in the heads of leaders of the Central Labor Council.  They were launched on a trade union trial of strength, and not a revolution.<br>
But there were people who did see the shipyard and the general strikes in revolutionary terms.  Since the death of the Daily Call, the socialists had been publishing the International Weekly.  The editors of this paper felt that the situation called for drastic action by labor.<br>
<br>
They weighed not only Lenin's speech on worker management but Lenin's previous actions in the seizure of power.  And so they called bluntly and sharply for a revolutionary solution - let the
shipyard workers take over the yards and operate them for the benefit of the workers.  This idea, expressed editorially in the International Weekly, was put into a leaflet.  Morris Pass, the artist, drew a cartoon showing a huge figure of Labor pushing a fat little capitalist into a coffin.<br>
<br>
Over this appeared the caption RUSSIA DID IT, a take-off on the slogan in the current Victory Bond drive, THE YANKS DID IT.<br>
<br>
Underneath appeared the editorial appealing to the shipyard workers.  While the leaflet's contents appealed to many strikers, no union endorsed its proposal.  Nevertheless the little socialist handbill was reproduced far and wide across the nation subse-
quently to give substance to the notion that the general strike was revolutionary in intent.<br>
<br>
A resolution offered by socialist unionists in the Central Labor Council February 5 echoed the sentiments of the leaflet.  If the strike is prolonged and the employers refuse to reach a settlement, the resolution advised, the strike committee should arrange to "take over the shipbuilding industry, eliminate the bosses, and operate it in the interests of the workers." The resolution was tabled.<br>
<br>
As the fateful day of Thursday, February 6, neared, tension mounted.  The more fearful among the upper classes departed for California to eseape the rigors of revolution.<br>
<br>
Those of such persuasion who remained at home laid in stocks of food, kerosene, and candles against the dreadful nights ahead.  Others cleaned their guns or acquired small arsenals the better to resist the hordes of Wobblies who presumably would roam the city, sacking, looting, and raping.  The gun stores saw a windfall in prospect.  Letters went out to selected lists such as<br>
this:<br>
<br>
Dear Fellow Kiwanian: Are you prepared? Not only to assist, if necessary, in controlling the despicable human element which has sprung up in our midst, but to defend, if necessary, the sanctity of your home and aid in protecting the property and wealth of the community? Although there has been a considerable scarcity of all firearms during recent months, we are fortunate in having in stock, at the present time, a very good assortment of revolvers, automatic pistols, rifles, shotguns and ammunition.<br>
<br>
Correspondents for Eastern newspapers and magazines began arriving to see for themselves how a revolution is conducted in the United States.  The local business dailies became shrill.<br>
<B><br>

UNDER WHICH FLAG? </B>asked the Star, in an editorial spread across the front page.  In answer to the Star, the Union Record said:<br>
<br>
Sane men there are, some, who believe that in the end all peaceful means to abolish the profit system will fail, and the age-long struggle between the suppressors and the oppressed will close with violence.  But no sane man believes that time is now.<br>
<br>
The Star pretends to believe that the unarmed and defenseless workers mean to capture City Hall and run up the Red Flag in spite of the fact that it knows that the workers know that there are thousands of soldiers at Camp Lewis and Fort Lawton.... No revolution of violence will be started during this strike, be the strike long or short.<br>
<br>
Said Selvin of the Business Chronicle in editorials which he ran as advertisements in the business dailies:<br>
<br>
Seattle today is overrun by red-flag agitators in the guise of "labor leaders.:' This is the attitude of the renegades the business men of this city have coddled, hesitated to "irritate," and subsidized in spreading their corroding propaganda by supporting with advertising the anarchistic Daily Union Record, without which the Bolsheviki would not now be in the saddle in Seattle.<br>
<br>
"So now we have the Seattle of today - once a proud city brought to the brink of industrial ruin; the Seattle that has come to be known throughout the length and breadth of the land as a hotbed of sedition, branded by the Department of justice as one of two cities that constitute the danger points of revolutionary Bolshevik propaganda.<br>
<br>
At the Labor Temple the Committee of 15 worked from early morning till midnight dealing with the problems of keeping the city a going concern during the shutdown.  A call went out to returned veterans, members of organized labor, to enlist in the Labor War Veterans Guard to maintain law and order during the strike, and 300 responded.  Exemptions were granted from the strike as local unions brought in their problems involving the health of the city.<br>
<br>
A sampling of the exemption requests and the decisions of the Committee of 15:<br>
<br>
King County commissioners ask for exemption of janitors to care for the City-County Building.  Not granted.<br>
<br>
Janitors ask for the Labor Temple.  Not granted.<br>
 Additional staff for the Cooperative Market to handle food for
<br>
strike kitchens.  Approved.<br>
<br>
Port of Seattle asks to be allowed to load a government vessel, pointing out that no private profit is involved and an emergency exists.  Granted.<br>
<br>
Garbage wagon drivers ask instructions.  May carry such garbage as tends to create an epidemic, but no ashes or papers.  Wagons to carry large signs: Exempt by Strike Committee.<br>
<br>
Retail drug clerks ask instructions.  Told that drug stores must be closed except for prescription service.<br>
<br>
To many citizens the most frightening aspect of the approaching tie-up was the threat by Leon Green, business agent of Electrical Workers Local 77, to shut down the City Light plant.  This would plunge the city into darkness, cut off the water supply to many parts, and affect many essential services.  As it turned out, the threat was an empty one; Local 77's membership was confined chiefly to linemen and did not include most of the operators within the light plant itself.  But either this was not realized at the time, or else the threat was blown up out of all reason for political purposes by the mayor of Seattle, Ole Hanson.  The spotlight shifted from the Labor Temple and the Committee of 15 to focus on the persons of Leon Green and Ole Hanson.<br>
<br>
Green was a newcomer in Seattle.  Handsome, dark-haired, voluble, dynamic, he was elected business agent because no other member cared to leave a steady job to take over that position.  He shared with Mayor Hanson one attribute - a love of limelight.  In an interview with the P-I he was quoted as saying: "We shall place the city in such a position [by shutting down City Light] that the strike will last but a feiv short days." Green's favorite phrase was, "We must use our Economic Power."<br>
<br>
Mayor Hanson was feeling his way toward the best political posture.  He was in and out of the Labor Temple, greeting officials there intimately as "Jimmy...... Harry," and "Jack," asking only, he Said, that essential light and water service be assured.  Meeting Hulet Wells, a member of the strike committee, in the corridor, to that socialist leader he expressed his admiration: "I don't care what they say about you - let the newspapers rave as they please - but no one can make me believe that you are not one of the finest of our citizens."<br>
<br>
A few months later he was saying that Wells should be kept in prison for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>
The Committee of 15 overruled Leon Green and informed Hanson that
City Light would operate.  But by then Hanson had dropped his air of familiarity with the Labor Temple; he had seen the vision, bathed in a national spotlight, of himself as the hero who smashed the Seattle "Revolution." He swore in extra police and summoned Governor Lister to rush in the National Guard.<br>
<br>
President Henry Suzzallo of the University of Washington, chairman of the State Council of Defense, beat him to the punch and demanded that Secretary of War Baker send in federal troops.  As was usual during strikes, students at the University, most of whom came from the middle and upper classes, were paid to act as guards in their ROTC uniforms "to help save the world from the Bolsheviki."<br>
<br>
Army trucks entered the city in the early morning hours of Thursday, February 6, from Camp Lewis, the Army's West Coast concentration center near Tacoma.  Machine gun nests were mounted at strategic points.  The United States Government was taking no chances with the Labor Temple.<br>
<br>
At 10:00 A.M. that Thursday the general strike began.  Street cars headed for the barns, trucks for the garages, transportation ceased.  Second Avenue, then the main thoroughfare, was silent and empty from the Washington Hotel down to Yesler Way.  At a few minutes before ten the pressmen at the Times and other papers began covering the presses with tarpaulins.  Silence reigned over the city.  Here and there small groups of unarmed men with armbands - the Labor Guards - patrolled the streets, with orders to disperse any gatherings of union men.  But there were no gatherings of any kind to disperse - public transportation was at a standstill and in any event unionists had been advised to stay at home for the duration.<br>
<br>
The peace that had descended was disturbed only by Mayor Ole Hanson.  From City Hall he thundered a proclamation on Friday, the second day of the strike:<br>
<br>
I hereby guarantee to all the people of Seattle absolute and com-
plete.protection. They should go about their daily work and busi-
ness in perfect security.  We have 1,500 policemen, 1,500 regular soldiers from Camp Lewis, and can and will secure, if necessary, every soldier in the Northwest to protect life, business and property.<br>
<br>
The time has come for the people of Seattle to show their Ameri-
canism.  Go about your daily duties without fear.  We will see to <B>it</B> that you have food, transportation, water, light, gas and all neces-<br>
sities.
<br>
The anarchists in this community shall not rule its affairs.<br>
All persons violating the laws will be dealt with summarily.<br>
<br>
The proclamation was all huff and puff.  People stayed home.  The New York Tribune's correspondent, sent out at some expense to cover a revolution, reported that "there was absolutely no problme."<br>
<br>
The normal Police docket of a hundred a day fell to about 30." Mayor Hanson had sworn in 600 extra police and deputized 2,400 more at a cost to the city of  $50,000.  But the commanding general of the U.S. troops brought into the city said he had never seen such a quiet and orderly city.  The Star managed to get out a bobtailed edition with the few printers working, distributed free from trucks manned by police with machine guns.<br>
<br>
It was headed, in red ink, <B>SEATTLE, UNITED STATES</B> <B>OF </B>AMERICA, across the top of the page.  It boasted that clubs, revolvers, rifles, carbines, automatics, and machine guns were being distributed among the fearful.  It reported that trucks, sandbagged and with machine guns able to sweep the streets, were lumbering up and down the main avenues of the city.  But there was nobody there to shoot down.  Rumors spread fast.<br>
<br>
The strikers had dynamited the city's water supply dam, Ole Hanson had been assassinated, buildings were being blown up and troops ivere engaged in bloody battles with strikers on downtown streets.  In all this Mayor Hanson was hardly a help.  To eager newspaper correspondents he was already proclaiming that he had quelled, almost single-handed, an attempted Bolshevik revolution.<br>
<br>
Newspapers in the East greedily gulped down such news, as the nation gaped with bated breath for the outcome of this killer-diller thriller.  Hanson telephoned Secretary Duncan to demand that the strike be ended forthwith.  Although he refused "to treat with these revolutionists" in statements he gave the wire services, he invited the Committee of 15 to City Hall and promised if the strike were ended that he personally would go to Washington to plead the shipyard workers' case.  If not, he would call out the army and declare martial law - a prerogative beyond his power.<br>
<br>
The P-I in a front page editorial thundered: "The issue is no longer in doubt; the leaders of the revolt are openly proclaiming that the shipyard strike is only a pretext; that it is a camouflage. <B>It </B>is not a strike; it is a delirium-born rebellion." The Star chimed'in: "A part of our community is, in fact, defying our government and is, in fact, contemplating changing that government, and not by American Methods.  This small part of our
city talks plainly of 'taking over things,' of 'resuming under our own management."'<br>
<br>
In the meantime the strike machinery was working a lot more fficiently than the most hopeful had expected.  Thirty-five milk stations were functioning in the residential sections; 21 cafe-
terias were serving meals for 25 cents apiece to union men, for 35 cents to others; hospitals were getting their linen and fuel.  A union card was the only credential for the 25-cent meal, and an I.W.W. card was as good as an A.F. of L.<br>
<br>
The Japanese Labor Association, comprising hotel and restaurant workers, struck in sympathy with the labor movement which had never recognized them nor even regarded them as a part of unionism.  The I.W.W. saw to it that the ginmills on the skid road were shut down (Washington had had official prohibition since 1916) and that I.W.W. members kept off the streets.<br>
<br>
The exhilaration from the marvellous display of solidarity experienced Thursday and Friday began by Saturday to give way to apprehension.  The purpose of the strike was to help the<br>
shipyard workers get an honorable settlement of their wage demands.  But nobody on the other side seemed inclined to negotiate anything.<br>
<br>
While Mayor Hanson's fulminations helped to keep up the backs of unionists, the ominous silence in Washington was dismaying.  It had been assumed that the general strike would shock officialdom into action and negotiation.  No one had questioned that the government would insist on a settlement of some kind.  It was assumed that ships were needed, and the government would come to terms.  But the war was over and while more shipping was needed to replace the tonnage sunk by German submarines, there was no longer any great urgency about it.<br>
<br>
The shipyards along the East and Gulf Coasts and in California continued operating.  The truth was that Seattle was expendable, despite its record-breaking speed in delivering ships.  For all Washington cared, the Seattle yards could remain closed; moreover it was desirable that the unions be taught a lesson...<br>
<br>
That the shipyards were expendable was apparent enough to the Citizens Committee, headed by a distinguished divine and an eminent banker.  The Committee of 15 was informed that because the strike was considered a revolutionary attempt, it would not bargain on surrender terms.  Call off the strike, and then, perhaps....<br>
From the Citizens Committee Mayor Hanson got his cue.<br>
<br>
Friday evening he ordered the Committee of 15 to end the strike Saturday morning, or else.  His "or else" was an empty threat but it had the effect of stiffening opposition among unionists to yielding to such pressure.
Far more effective were the threats of international union officials to revoke local union charters, particularly in the printing trades.  Small editions of the dailies began to appear.  On Saturday a few unions returned to work; that afternoon the Committee of 15 voted 13 to I to end the strike at midnight.  Although several more unions had voted the same day to return, the General Strike Committee, with final authority, voted to continue the strike by 76 to 45.<br>
<br>
In late afternoon it had seemed that the vote to end the strike was assured; but after a dinner recess several unions changed their position upon the urging of the metal trades and longshore unions.<br>
<br>
The General Strike Committee met again Monday morning and then adopted the motion to end the strike.  More unions had gone back to work, but others which had returned Saturday voted to resume the strike and bring it to an end with united ranks at noon Tuesday, February 11. The strike had lasted five working days.<br>
<br>
For the majority of Seattle unions, there was no sense of defeat as the strike ended.  They had demonstrated their solidarity- with their brothers in the yards, and the memory of the great days when labor had shown its strength glowed in their minds.  It was not until many years later, in a very different climate of opinion, that some of the leaders began apologizing for what could be excused as a momentary aberration by an otherwise solid body of citizenry.<br>
<br>
It became needful to rewrite history, to blame the general strike on "radicals" or "the I.W.W. element." Forgetful of the evident fact that the strike was voted by some 300 delegates chosen for the purpose from a hundred local unions, almost unanimously, and that none but these regular delegates and their Committee of 15 made the decisions, some have apologized for the great general strike of Seattle as merely an incident to be forgotten, glossed over, or explained away.<br>
<br>
The Central Labor Council resumed its normal position in the movement on Wednesday, February 12, the day after the strike ended.  Delegates reviewed the impressive achievements of the committees which had carried out the tasks assigned them in guarding against violence, in feeding the hungry, caring for the sick, and keeping essential services running.  Chairman Ben F.Nauman of the strike committee summed up: "We did something in this strike which has never been done before by the A.F. of L. We pulled off a general strike with craft unions, with ironclad contracts which had to be broken, and with a constitution that had to be ignored." There had been two mistakes, he said: the failure to decide on the duration of the strike at the beginning, and the failure to call it off Saturday night when it became evident that
the ranks were breaking.<br>
<br>
Absent from the Council meeting was the business agent for the Electrical Workers union, Leon Green.  He who had bluffed Mayor Ole Hanson on shutting down City Light and had provided most of the fireworks that spread the idea of a heartless attempt to crush the life out of a city, had left Seattle never to return.<br>
<br>
In 1923 a story in the Union Record reported that Green had been found guilty by the Chicago retail clerks' union, of which he was business agent, and by the United Hebrew Trades of accepting a $3,000 bribe from the Retail Merchants Association while negotiating a new contract.  He was expelled.<br>
<br>
From the general strike arose a Knight of Reaction in shining armor.  Ole Hanson, often referred to as "Holy Ole," became the nine-day darling of the nation's open shoppers.  Messages of congratulation showered upon him from New York, Washington, Chicago, and way points.  He did nothing to dispel the myth that single-handed he had slain the dragon of anarchy.<br>
<br>
Overcome by the adulation and feeling Seattle to be too narrow an arena for a man of his talents, he resigned the mayor's chair in August, 1919, for a year-long lecture tour on the theme of Americanism vs.  Bolshevism, which he elaborated into a book.  Always a man with an eye on the main chance, he left a job paying $7,500 to lecture at $500 an audience, or $38,000 for the entire tour.  He was even boomed for the presidency, but the "Massachusetts Ole Hanson," Calvin Coolidge, beat him to the draw by quelling the Boston police strike to become reaction's newest hero and Republican candidate for the vice-presidency.<br>
<br>
By 1920 Ole's message had been drowned out in the national anti-red hysteria which he had helped to whip up.  He returned to Seattle to dispose of his real estate interests and retire to southern California, the realtor's haven, pursued by ugly rumors about his part in the purchase by the city of the street car system from the Stone SC Webster interests.<br>
<br>
To a former police official, writing years later in the Seattle police magazine, "Hanson was the type of man who so frequently appears in Seattle's chronicles as a mayor.  He was energetic and picturesque, made rabblerousing speeches, but did not say anything and accomplished even less.  As a result of the way he conducted himself during the strike, he became a Chamber of Commerce hero everywhere but in Seattle."<br>
<br>
Seattleites read with some astonishment the lurid accounts of the izeneral strike which appeared in the nation's leading magazines.  To the Saturday Evening Post it was evident that "bolshevism has
put forth its supremest effort in America and has failed." There followed a curious tale, typical of that hysterical period.  "The I.W.W. themselves," said the Post "openly boast that the Russian revolution was planned in the office of a Seattle lawyer, counsel for the organization, during those three overheated days wherein Lenin and Trotsky tarried in the city's midst, en route to Russia; and that an American revolution was planned or at least discussed at the same time."<br>
<br>
The Post referred to "an especially illuminating little treatise in booklet form entitled Russia Did It, by an ambitious young Bolshevik author who, alas, now languishes behind prison bars in lieu of $10,000 bail.  Two and a half tons of this booklet alone were distributed.  Equity [the socialist-I.W.W. print shop] ran its presses frantically day and night." Alas, too, for the truth: it wasn't a booklet but a rather small leaflet; the "Bolshevik author" far from languishing in jail was working to help Armour's construct a huge agricultural irrigation project in the Sutter Basin of California; the leaflet was issued in a modest quantity of 20,000 amounting only to several pounds weight in all; and Equity  managed  to  get  its  work  done  in  one  eight-hour shift each day.<br>
<br>
World's Work, then a leading national magazine, was not to be outdone by the Post.  A full-page photo of Mayor Hanson was captioned:<br>
<br>
A citizen of Norwegian ancestry who, by a quick display of intelligent energy, crushed @n a few hours a Bolsfievist outbreak in the city of Seattle, over which he rules as mayor.  A conglomeration of aliens from Russia and Finland attempted to give American "Bolshevism" an example by establishing a Soviet -, in this Washington city, but Mayor Hanson, by the prompt announcement that the headquarters of the city government was the City Hall and that the first "reformer" to interfere with its. operations would be shot, immediately dissolved the "revolution " The aliens who started the disturbance have been deported to their European homes.<br>
<br>
Sunset, the Pacific Coast monthly, did not intend to lag behind its Eastern competitors: "Instead of crawling into the cyclone cellar, Seattle walked right up to the gate, a gun in either hand, to meet the Social Revolution."<br>
<br>
Closer to home, the Post-Intelligencer joined the chorus.  Proclaiming February 1 1 that "The Revolution is Over," the P-I editorialized:<br>
<br>
Whatever may have been the motives of the rank and file of the strikers, those who engineered the strike did so with the hallucination that the whole country would flame into revolution.  In fact, the idea of revolution was the sole idea with any logical foundation for the whole undertaking.... The revolution is at an
end.  The serpent head of Bolshevism has been crushed under the heels of an onward-marching citizenry led by a fearless mayor.<br>
<br>
To this the Union Record responded:<br>
<br>
If by revolution is meant violence, the killing or maiming of men, surely no group of workers dreamed of such action.  But if by revolution is meant that the Great Change is coming over the face of the world, which will transform our method of carrying on industry and will go deep into the very source of our lives, to bring joy and freedom in place of heaviness and fear -then we do believe in such a Great Change and that the General Strike was one of the definite steps toward it.... Some day when the workers have learned to manage, they will Begin Managing.<br>
<br>
Truth was, a revolutionary spark did exist in Seattle in February, 1919.  The strike leaders knew that as well as the government, and were mortally frightened.  For that reason unionists were ordered to remain at home and avoid any gatherings; the Union Record was ordered not to ublish; no incident was to be permitted that might flare into p provocation of the Army and the thousands of armed vigilantes.<br>
<br>
By the third day of the strike they realized that the Seattle labor movement stood all alone; the strike wave did not even spread down the coast to California nor was there any move across a nation falling under the spell of the anti-Red hysteria to give aid and comfort, even verbally, to the labor morements of Seattle and Tacoma.  Seattle, unfortunately, was all too unique in its militancy.<br>

</B><br>
How shall we remember the 1919 Seattle general strike? Shall we celebrate it as a triumphant assertion of working people's power? Or mourn it as a disaster heralding years of blacklist and open shop? Or dismiss it as the fantastic adventure of radicals rehearsing the revolution they sought? Beyond the conclusions of the General Strike Committee's official history let's see how the participants evaluated their strike and how it affected their lives.<br>

"The general strike put into our hands the organized life of the city all except the declared Anna Strong. *W did 60.,000 union men and women take over their city?<br>
<br>
Wartime Seattle threatened to burst at the seams, Population grew from 237,000 in 1910 to 315,312 ten years later.  From 1914 to 1919 the number of manufacturing employees increased more than threefold to over 40,000. Of these 35,000 worked in the shipbuilding industry.  Gigantic proportions defined wartime plants Seattle yards constructed 26.5 percent of all ships built for the Emergency Fleet Corporation.<br>
<br>
In November 1918 Seattle's Skinner and Eddy,, the largest yard in the nation had produced more ships than any other for the United States government. Paying above average wages, the yard lured thousands of experienced workers to Seattle and employed about 15,000 in 1918.<br>
<br>
Rent hogs gouged the newcomers and inflation devoured their paychecks.  Nationally from 1914 to 1920 the cost of Iiving rose 90 percent with food prices doubled.<br>
<br>
Many of the newcomers joined unions.  From 1915 to 1919 membership<br>
in the 130 local unions increased over fourfold, from 15, 000 to 65,000  while membership in the American Federation of Labor (AFL) nationally doubled.<br>
<br>
The unions spanned the ideological spectrum from the conservative Federal Employees local that opposed a general strike and denounced Bolsheviks, to avowed Socialists and syndicalists,, who called upon working people to take over the means of production and abolish capitalism.  The whole movement tilted to the left.<br>
<br>
James Duncan, secretary of the Central labor Council, led the reform bloc advocating industrial unionism in the AFL nationally.<br>
<br>
Hulet Wells, a Socialist, sent to prison for opposing the draft,, was a delegate to and former president of the council.  The movement boasted the only labor-owned daily newspaper in the country, the Union Record with a circulation of 50,000. On the fringe of the movement a vigorous socialist party contributed activists to the local unions and central council.<br>
<br>
Many members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) also carried cards in AFL unions, bringing with them a militant program of class struggle.  Both these organizations published weekly papers.<br>
<br>
The wartime labor shortage fostered working people's confidence in their power.  Goaded by the high cost of living hundreds of unionists gained wage increases in short strikes.  They included passenger car cleaners at the King Street Station in a four-day strike, milk wagon drivers after nine hours and coal packers and
laundry drivers atfer seven days.<br>
<br>
Packing house workers won raises and a shortened work day.  Besides defending their living standards with economic strikes against their own employers, Seattle unionists demonstrated their solidarity with the Timber Workers Union in a massive sympathetic strike.  In September 1917, 5,000 carpenters and caulkers struck rather than handle ten-hour lumber produced by scabs.<br>
<br>
Overnight, World War I created an enormous demand for ships to carry goods and soldiers to Europe, and an imperative need for a stable labor force to build those ships.  As in other essential war indutries the federal government intervened decisively  oganizing the Emergency Fleet Corporation in April 1917 to oversee construction of shipyards and vessels.<br>
<br>
Then representatives of the government and shipyard unions agreed to formation of the Shipbuilding labor Adjustment Board, composed of a representative of the Emergency Fleet Corporation, a represenative of shipyard labor and chaired by V. Everit Macy,, a New York bank director, appointed by President Woodrow Wilson to represent the public.<br>
<br>
Shipyard workers organized in craft unions bargained with their employers through local Metal Trades councils. Instead of individual craft agreements, the Metal Trades Council developed a blanket agreement covering all crafts.  The councils could bargain directly with all yards without government interference, but in large yards working on contracts for government-owned vessels the Emergency Fleet Corporation claimed the right to regulate wages.<br>
<br>
With the cost of living rising, in July 1917 the Seattle Metal Trades Council demanded $6.00 a day for skilled workers and comensurate increases for other classifications.  Some shipyards agreed; others refused pleading inability to bargain independently.<br>
<br>
Failing to get help frm the Macy Board, 12,,000 metal workers struck Seattle shipyards September 29.  The Macy Board hastened west to hold hearings and adjust wages. The men accepted mediation and returned to work October 23.<br>
<br>
After conductirg hearings up and down the coast in December 1917 the Macy Board set uniform wage scales.  For Seattle these rates resulted in some crafts received 60 cents a day more than they had requested and most of the basic shipyard trades  22 cents less than the rates in other yards and shops.<br>
<br>
Rather than reduce the journeyman rate 25 cents, the board allowed the Seattle yards to pay $5.50 a day, Patriotic sentiments kept angry shipyard workers on the job during 1918 while they appealed vainly for relief to protect their eroding standard of living.<br>
          
Based on continued rising prices the Seattle Metal Trades Council asked the Macy Board to allow wages ranging fron $8.00 a day for journeymen to $5.50 for laborers.  With Seattle yards over the Macy ceiling, Charles Piez director of the Emergency Fleet Corporation, promised James A. Taylor, president of the Seattle Metal Trades, that he would not interfere in direct negotiations with Seattle shipbuilders, with the understanding that the government would not reimburse the builders for wages in excess of Macy scales.<br>
<br>
The new Macy award, handed down November 8, gave journeymen $6.40 a day and laborers $4.64, amounting to wage cutting  according to the Union <B>Record</B>.  The rate for the unskilled probably 80 percent of the workers, was about $500 a year less than the minimum income required to sustain a family of four.  The next day the Pacific Coaal District Metal Trades Council rejected the award and appealed the decision.  The Armistice November 11 released the shipyard workers from their wartime no strike obligation.<br>
<br>
The 32,000 workers represented by the Seattle Metal Trades Council belonged to seventeen unions ranging from  the Boilemakers with 15,OOO members, the largest local union in the country, to unions with a few hundred members.<br>
<br>
Losing the appeal, the Metal trades unions took a strike vote and prepared to negotiate directly for the wages the Macy-Board had refused.  The strike vote carried decisively and negotiations produced no results.  Reneging on his promise not to interfere in negotiations, Piez threatened the shipbuilders with loss of their steel allotment if they agreed to union demands.<br>
<br>
On January 21, 1919, 32,000 workers struck the Seattle shipyards.<br>
<br>
That night the Metal Trades Council asked the Central labor Council to poll the affiliated unions for a general strike in support of the shipyard workers.  The delegates assented "with cheers for the solidarity of solidarity of labor and without a dissenting vote," Hulet Wells declared: "Seattle is one place where a universal strike can be pulled off with success, I am confident<br>
that the shipyard workers could win alone. . . . But if we win it with a universal strike., every union in the city will get the benefit of the victory.<br>
<br>
Some delegates wanted a mass strike in which each union "should list all its grievances and go out in a battle royal with all the employers,  no union to go back until every organization's troubles have been settled." But the majority favored a sympathetic strike.. believing that solidarity consisted in going down the line together for the metal trademnen and especially for the laborer and helper," 
Andy Mulligan of the Boilermakers wanted "a clean cut demonstration of the economic power of organized labor or call it off." Dismissing radical rhetoric, James Duncan summed up: "This is an issue that cannot easily be befogged. It is all right to talk about the revolutions but some of us are not revolutionists. . . . The issue is whether representatives of this government can treat their workers as scraps of paper.<br>
<br>
Seattle union people already knew about general strikes.  Their delegates had just returned from the Chicago congress to initiate a nationwide referendum for a series of general strikes to free Tom Mooney and Warren Billings from prison.<br>
<br>
The congress agreed to ballot on calling five-day general strikes in July.. September., and November, to culminate in an indefinite general strike if Mooney and Billings remained in jail.  Moreover IWW members, Wobblies, had been talking for years about the general strike to take over the means of production and abolish capitalism.<br>
<br>
Most local unions and councils endorsed the general strike enthusiastically and elected their three delegates to the General Strike Committee.  Many Seattle unionists., as well as labor generally believed that the war's end and return to "normalcy" signaled a massive open-shop drive to wipe out their unions and drive down their living standards.<br>
<br>
Therefore they  must unite all their strength to repen this combined attack of employers and government.  Defeat of the shipyard workers would break the Seattle union movement.  For their motto the strikers rejected the stirring sentiment of the <B>Communist Manifesto.</B>, "We have nothing to lose but our chains and a world to win." in favor of the slogan on patriotic postersp "Together We Win."<br>
<br>
War's end also brought demobilized soldiers and sailors needing jobs.  The Seattle Metal Trades Council sponsored organization of a Workers Soldiers and Sailors Council to assist the veterans and prevent their being used to break strikes.  Affiliated locals subscribed $15,000 to support the organization.<br>
<br>
Socialists became active in the council, "Local Soviet Declares for End of Capitalist Exploitation." their paper headlined.  The Russian word soviet meant council. Many Socialists., some of whom would soon leave the party to form the American Communist parties,, believed that the Bolshevik revolution and the Russian Soviets pointed the way to their goal.<br>
<br>
The preamble of the constitution declared: "The purpose of the Council of Workers, Soldiers and Sailors is to organize all members of the working class into one organization and train them in the principles of mass action in order that we may realize that
accumulation of energy, that concentration of force and continuity of resistance necessary to strike the final blow against capitalism."<br>
<br>
The General strike Committee numbering some 345 delegates, set about organizing the details of the strike.  They rejected the plea of James Duncan and others to hold the actual strike in abeyance as a threat to deter the shipyards from reopening with scabs.<br>
<br>
Nor would they set a limit on the duration.  The strike would begin on Thursday morning., February 6,  to last indefinitely.  The Metal Trades Council promised that if none of their members would return to work until all the other unions who participated in the general strike returned to their former positions.," and, accorcing to the Longshoremen's minutes, the General Strike Committee recommended "that there will be no settlement of the strike when called until all organizations return to work with at least as favorable conditions as those enjoyed previous to the strike."<br>
<br>
Many workers interpreted these statements as protect on against discrimination if they struck.<br>
<br>
Although the General Strike Committee planned carefully to provide<br>
for Seattle citizens and insure a peaceful strike, it said little about concrete demands, Instead before the strike. The Union Record carried an ambiguous editorial written by Anna Louise Strong, quoted "from coast to coast as a sign of revolutionary intention":<br>
<br>
"We are undertaking the most tremendous move ever made by LABOR in this country,, a move that will lead--NO ONE KNOWS WHERE!. . . NOT THE WITHDRAWAL OF LABOR BUT THE POWER OF THE STRIKERS TO MANAGE WILL WIN THIS STRIKE . . . . labor will not only SHUT DOWN the industries but labor <B>will</B> REOPEN., under the management of the appropriate trades . . . If the strike continues, labor may feel led to avoid public suffering by reopening more and more activities. . . . UNDER ITS OWN MANAGEMENT . And that is why we say that we are starting on a road that leads-NO ONE KNOWS WHERE!<br>
<br>
The capitalist press pounced on the editorial as Bolshevik propaganda.  The Socialists did, in fact,, call for the revolution in a leaflet written by Harvey O'Connor and distributed February 2 entitled., "Russia Did It":<br>
<br>
You have built the ships for our boss.  They did not build them for yourselves? Why not own and control, through your unions,, YOUR jobs and YOUR shipyards? Why not dictate yourselves the number of hours you should work.. the conditions under which you work, the pay you should receive for your labor?<br>
<br>
          
The Russians have shown you the way out.  What are you going to do about it? You are doomed to wage slavery till you die unless you wake up, realize that you and the boss have not one thing in common, that the employing class must be overthrown, and that you, the workers., must take over the control of your jobs, and through them the control over your lives instead of offering yourselves up to the masters as a sacrifice six days a week so that they may coin profits out of your sweat and toil.<br>
<br>
The strikers disclaimed the leaflet as unauthorized Wobbly propaganda.  But the Wobblies did not advocate revolution.  Instead, the "Strike Bulletin" of the IWW Shipbuilders Industrial Union declared February 1:<br>
<br>
Every union man knows that if the shipyard workers strike can be broken by the companies, every union in Seattle might as well go out of business because the companies will not rest now until they smash unionism or are thoroughly and decisively beaten by the organized workers.<br>
<br>
This is a clean cut issue between unionism and the open shop.  They may cry "I.W.W." "Bolsheviki influence." but the fact remaining and union men know it, that this is a fight to a finish, the outcome of which will demonstrate whether the workingman has a right for higher wages so he and his family can get the good things of life.<br>
<br>
On Thursday morning., February 6, some 28,000 working men and woman struck in sympathy with the shipyard workers,, many of them breaking union agreements to participate.  The General Strike Committee exempted federal employees and a few weak or essential unions.  Several refused to strike., notably the printing trades.<br>
<br>
The Socialist International Weekly headlined the next day: "CAPITALISM TOTTERS" Can 60,000 Workers Operate Industry Without Bosses?" The paper predicted that "here in Seattle peacefully and without violence, may transpire the revolutionary change in the management of industry from the present exploiters to the workers."<br>
<br>
"Now's the Day." the paper challenged.  "Choose you Must.  Either be whipped slave and eat out of the master's hand or be men,, free men among men."<br>
<br>
Mayor Ole Hanson,, the employers,, and the press unleashed a hysterical campaign against the strikers, demanding "unconditional surrender" from "these revolutionists."<br>
<br>
The "Official Central Labor Council Strike Bulletin" February 7 congratulated the strikers in their orderly conduct. Declaring Charles Piez "wholly responsible for local tie-up.." the bulletin
explained: "The purpose of the general strike is to, bring into action every local influence to the end that the right of local shipyard workers to negotiate directly with their employers may be established."<br>
<br>
The General Strike Committee rejected a resolution from its Executive Committee to terminate the strike at midnight Saturday.  The strike ended officially, on Tuesday,, February 11,, although many locals had already returned to work under pressure of their international or local officers or employers.<br>
<br>
The next night Ben Nauman, chair of the General Strike Committee,, delegate from the Stationary Engineers, and assistant city boiler inspector, reported to the Central labor Council: "-we did something in this strike which has never been done before by the A.F. of L. We pulled off a general strike with craft unions with ironclad contracts which had to be broken,, and with a constitution which had to be ignored."<br>
<br>
He pointed out two mistakes, failure to set a definite limit at the outset and failure to end the strike on Saturday night.  "But for all that he said., while the strike did not accomplish the immediate result for which it had been definitely called, it -was a tremendous success . It has shown the solidarity of labor and its power.<br>
<br>
Nauman condemned the radical  attempt to deflect the council from its rightful purpose,': "I don't believe that the Central labor Council should be used as a general clearing house for other propaganda.  The Central Labor Council has its own function to inform for the labor movement.  The boast of Bolshevism and the boast of revolution had no business to be thrust into this campaign., and I do not believe it has any business in the Central Labor Council.<br>
<br>
Employers and the press seized on <B>Nauman'</B> s statement.  "LABOR COUNCIL TO OUST RADICALS.," the Seattle Times headlined, and employers urged labor in a full-page ad: "Let's Clean House."<br>
<br>
The Shipyard laborers, Riggers and Fasteners replied to the employers with a resolution passed by the Metal Trades Council and introduced in the Central Labor Council February 19.  It proc@ed defiantly:<br>
<br>
We hasten to assure the draft-slacking publisher of the Star all the employers who hate labors and all those who love to lick their boots., that we know exactly what they mean by "reds.," we know exactly what they mean by "Bolsheviks," exactly what they mean by cleaning house; that organized labor in Seattle was never so proud of itself, that it appreciates the reds the more for the enemies they have made, that it has no intention of cleaning house to
please its opponents.. and that the general strike is permanently in the arsenal of labor's peaceful weapons.16<br>
<br>
After a furious debate the resolution went to committee.  The Produce Workers some of whose members had been locked out after the strike., answered February 26 with a resolution providing that Central Labor Council delegates must be 11100 per cent American Federation of Labor followers and in no way owing obligation to any other workers, organization.,,17 "Renew Efforts to Curb Radical Labor Element" the Times crowed, as this resolution also went to committee.<br>
<br>
The council debated both resolutions March 5. "When did the Chamber of Commerce ever take advice from organized labor?" demanded Roy Hays of the Longshoremen, "And why should we take advice from the Chamber of Commerce or other business interests?" Hulet Wells admitted ruefully during the debate: "Our recent general strike,,<br>
I think have convinced most of us that the general strike is never going to come into frequent or general use to obtain particular results.  In theory the general strike is effective, but in practice we are going to find it easier to whip the employers one group at a time rather than as a mass.  "<br>
<br>
The council voted down the Produce Workers resolution and passed the one defending the "reds." "House Cleaning Proves Failure.." the Times said.  After the meeting the Mailers Union withdrew its delegates, charging that the council was "dominated by I.W.W. and other radicals and that the union could not serve the council and the American Federation of Labor at the same time," 18<br>
<br>
Federal and local authorities arrested and harassed Socialists and Wobblies.  Although the unions did not endorse their programs, they defended the rights of the persecuted radicals.  In a Metal Trades Council meeting delegates charged that the Workers, Soldiers and sailors Council had fallen into the hands of wobblies and Bolsheviks. however,, a motion to recall the money subscribed for its support and return it to the locals that raised it died for want of a second,<br>
<br>
The Union Record defended the strike in an editorial "Concerning Revolution." Rejecting violence, the paper asserted: "But if by revolution is meant that a Great Change is coming over the face of the world which will transform our method of carrying on in industry, then we do believe in such a Great Change and that our General Strike was one very definite step towards it . . . .<br>
<br>
Someday., when the workers have learned to manage, they will BEGIN MANAGING." 19 The General Strike Committee's official history summed up: "The workers went back, most of them not feeling defeated., but feeling quite reasonably successful, glad they had struck., equally glad to call it off., and especially glad to think that their experience would now be of use to the entire
labor movement of the country as it makes its plans for the Mooney general strike. ,20<br>
<br>
Years later Anna Louise Strong described the strikers as "red in the ranks and yellow as leaders.," asking:<br>
<br>
Shall one blame the yellow leaders who sabotaged the strike and wished to end it? . . . But it is more to the point to ask why it happened that as soon as any worker was made a leader he wanted to end the strike. Workers in the ranks felt the thrill of massed power . . . But as soon as one of these workers was put on a responsible committee as he also wished to stop . . . For we lacked all intention of real battle; we expected to drift into power. 21<br>
<br>
After the strike ended the Metal Trades and Central labor councils could not keep their promises to protect the jobs of sympathetic strikers.  The Master Barbers demanded apologies before taking back their employees.  The Master Builders declared for the open hop.. then backed down.  City Light disciplined employees who struck by promoting scabs to their jobs., and the City denied all strikers their vacations and gave others additional layoffs.<br>
<br>
The union of City Light employees struck. Several employers discriminated against janitors and hotel maids who struck.  The Auto Drivers Union complained that Seattle Taxicab and Transfer Company hired nonunion drivers.  Bradner and Company blacklisted some members of the Butter, Egg and Produce Workers and the Charles G. Lilly Company locked out members of the Cereal and Flour Mill Workers.<br>
<br>
The Teamsters had trouble getting their members back to work at the gas company and Frye Packing Company.  The gas company locked out members of the Gas Fitters Union., reduced their wages.. and told them to tear up their union cards.  The Gas Workers Union, whose members manufactured the gas, had refused to strike; at this point they voted not to support the pipe fitters.  To force the company to take back the fitters the Metal Trades Council discussed and abandoned a plan to shut off the gas in industrial plants where union members worked.<br>
<br>
Puget Sound longshoremen had just signed an agreement with their employers in January', the first since their defeat in 1916.  Nevertheless., the Seattle local of 3,500 members voted to participate in the general strike.  Thereupon the 'Waterfront Employers notified them that if they struck the agreement would be terminated.<br>
<br>
Reassured by the Central Labor Councils promise of protection., they joined the strike anyway.  The day after the strike began, Seattle employers, including Frank Waterhouse of the waterfront employers., formed the Associated Industries.  This organization would spearhead the open-shop movement during the next decade. 
The longshoremen returned to work open shop selected by employers ":n accordance with their efficiency." 22<br>
<br>
They hung onto their work on the docks and battled with their employers for recognition.  Finally in August., the Pacific Coast District International Longshoremen's Association signed a closed-shop agreement for Puget Sound.. Columbia River, and British Columbia ports,, providing for wage increases.<br>
<br>
The shipyard workers remained on strike after the general strike ended.  When the Pacific Coast Metal Trades District Council met in Portland February 17, the delegates endorsed the ongoing strike in the Northwest and resolved to take a referendum vote for coastwide strike April 1. The Seattle shipbuilders announced they would resume operations on February 7 in a move the Metal Trades branded as open shop; ironworkers who returned would be considered strikebreakers.<br>
<br>
Charles Piez forbade the yards to open under those conditions and the strike dragged on.  The Seattle Metal Trades unions returned to work March 11, with the promise of a conference a week later in Washington., D.C., between shipbuilders, government officials,, and union representatives.<br>
<br>
Although the yards were supposed to take the men back "as they had come out, the <B>Union Record</B> reported "...that the men are being hand-picked by the foremen and that those who are known to be active unionists are not selected. The J.F. Duthie yard decreed that shop stewards would be discontinued and shop committees would not take up grievances on working time; the company barred business agents from the yard.<br>
<br>
Machinists found themselves locked out when a number of contract shops lengthened the work week from forty-four to forty-eight hours and reduced minimum lay from 90 to 80 cents an hour.<br>
<br>
The Washington conference refused to raise Pacific Coast shipyard wages; the old Macy scales would continue in effect until October 1. With the war ended., the goverrment and private shipowners no longer needed more vessels,, Pacific Coast Metal Trades unions voted down the April 1 strike proposal.<br>
<br>
Seattle employers gloated over their shipyard workers' rejection of the strike call.  The <B>Union Record</B> replied that "radicals" had not agitated for a strikes and "after a seven weeks" strike the wokers here were not financially ready for another test of strength.<br>
<br>
Members of the Stationary Engineers, Machinists, and Boilermakers
defeated attempts of their internationals to oust local radicals and reelected them to office.<br>
<br>
Groping for means to resist the employers' open-shop drive. radical Seattle unionists formed the Federated Unions in May.  The organization would assume "authority on economic and industrial questions.." leaving the Central Labor Council "a sort of semi-politics, clearing house for orators and debate.<br>
<br>
The preamble declared the object "to promote the general welfare, ensure greater solidarity,, establish a community of interest, and promulgate and affect greater unity in the labor movement.."The Federated Unions aimed to have all agreements expire simultaneously on April 30., to negotiate blanket agreements in all industries, and to establish the shop steward system.  With conservatives charging the plan a Wobbly maneuver, the self-styled attempt at unity and solidarity precipitated a divisive debate in the Central Labor Council.  By a vote of 100 to 45,, on May 28 the council condemned the Federated Unions as a dual organization, and it  disappeared.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the returns of the general strike ballot in May indicate in part union people's frame of mind.  Nationally, 128,142 members voted to strike., 3.27 percent of the AFL membership.  In Seattle 7,171 members voted "yes." 8.05 percent of the membership.  The Seattle Boilermakers voted for the strike 3,076 to 1,220.  The big Seattle Longshoremen's Union did not even return ballots.<br>
<br>
But in Seattle, in unions that voted on the question, a larger percentage voted against it than nationally.  The national "yes" vote carried by 83.13 percent of votes cast, the Seattle vote by 73 percent# and the Seattle Boiler-makers by 71.6 percert.  Apparently only a small minority,, both nationally and in Seattle, supported the Mooney general strike proposal.<br>
<br>
Late in the year Seattle employers defeated the unions in two major industries.  The Building Trades and Panting Trades struck the beginning of September for wage increases.  After months the internationals called off the strikes and the members returned to woik open shop.  In contrast to the 50.,OOO people who marched in the parade in 1918, Seattle unionists celebrated a subdued Labor Day in 1919 with a picnic.<br>
<br>
We come back to the question of how to remember the general strike: as a victory, a defeat,, or an adventure. Seattle union people proved that they could "pull a general strike"--that they had the power to shut down the city.  Subsequently pride compelled them to defend the action against employer criticism.  But they could not translate that power into economic pressure to gain concessions from employers.  
They could not muster the focused determination and <B>endurance </B>that <B>would force </B>an individual employer to capitulate in a primary economic strike. The victims of discrimination could not defend themselves, and the rest of the unions had no stomach <B>for more</B> pathetic strikes.<br>
<br>
The general strike did nothing <B>for the </B>embattled <B>shipyard workers.  </B>Predictably, neither the Metal <B>Trades or Central </B>Labor councils <B>could protect</B> the jobs <B>of </B>sympathetic strikers; <B>employers </B>blacklisted and discriminated with impunity.<br>
<br>
Months <B>of </B>acrimonious <B>and devisive debate </B>in <B>the </B>union movement succeeded the tremendous surge of solidarity that shut down <B>the city February </B>6, Even <B>as they </B>mobilized <B>for </B>the <B>general strike,, </B>union <B>people's </B>economic power diminished.<br>
<br>
With <B>the </B>war <B>ended, employers </B>planned to <B>return </B>to normalcy <B>by</B> cutting <B>wages and laying </B>off <B>workers.  Although the general </B>strike <B>did </B>not precipitate <B>the </B>open-shop <B>decade </B>that followed., it left the Seattle union movement with <B>weakened defenses </B>during <B>the bitter years </B>to <B>come.  </B><br>
<br>
In that rapidly chilling economic climate, prudent <B>resistance </B>might <B>have served</B> working people better than <B>the most fla</B>mboyant <B>challenge </B>that the union movement could hurl at the capitalist <B>lass.</B><br>

THE GENERAL STRIKE<br>
<br>
Rogert Sale, "The Seattle General Strike," <B>Seattle, past to present.</B> Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1976, p. 126-<br>
135.<br>
<br>
In the fall of 1918 Seattle and the country were hit hard by an influenza epidemic, and by rumors of many kinds.  As the first sizable American casualties were reported, so too came stories of "German atrocities." There were rumors of an impending armistice,
rumors that the United States might go to war with Russia after defeating Germany.<br>
<br>
As part of a propaganda effort there were rumors of labor uprisings in Germany, but it also was said that the "Bolshevik horde" were looming in England, France, Italy, China, the United States.  The war was almost over, the American presence in France had been decisive, but everywhere people seemed bitter and weary rather than buoyed or excited.<br>
<br>
There was wild cheering when the armistice news arrived in Seattle, but it brought no peace, or harmony.  The fight between the " good citizens" and the "reds" was not over; indeed, it had not truly been joined yet.  The labor unions, "red" and otherwise, saw that they needed to work immediately to consolidate some wartime gains.<br>
<br>
The war gave impetus to Wobblies in many unions to try to revolutionize the A.F. of L. craft union system into their One Big Union, and it also enabled many working-class people to begin to adopt the habits of the bourgeois.  The leaders of the Seattle Central Labor Council reflected both impulses.  They were home-owning and God-fearing people, sober and Prohibitionist.<br>
<br>
But while they were not Wobblies themselves, they were generally sympathetic to them, even though the Wobblies in Seattle tended to be close to what in the revolutionary efforts of the 1960s were student groups: young, ideal istic, transient, short-lived rather than longtime labor people.  Ault Duncan, and many Seattle labor people believed in industrial unionism and disagreed with the Wobblies only over how -it was to be achieved.<br>
<br>
Their hope and strength lay not in the national A.F. of L. but in a strong local organization that could bring together afl Seattle labor as a united front against any employer or group of employers.<br>
<br>
The great weakness of the unions, which they seemed only partly to realize at the time, was that most of their great horde of new members worked in the shipyards, and shipbuilding was almost en-
tirely a wartime activity.  Since most yards built steel-hulled ships, the Metal Trades Council was the labor power in the yards.<br>
<br>
Throughout the war there had been dickering between the shipbuilders, especially Skinner and Eddy, and the Metal Trades Council, and various govemmental boards.  In order to insure a steady labor supply, Skinner and Eddy was willing to pay very high wages, and when wages were consequently driven up in other yards, the government became alarmed.<br>
<br>
Charles Piez of the federal Emergency Fleet Corporation finally agreed to the inflated wages after the Metal Trades Council
guaranteed that there would be no further strikes in the shipyards in wartime.  The moment the war ended, the unions ry o get guarantees about peacetime wages. were free to strike to t t<br>
But at that point the govemment and the shipbuilders might welcome a strike as the best means of getting lots of suddenly unwanted<br>
workers off the payroll.<br>
<br>
The incident that set the conflict in motion began with a misde-
livered telegram.  Charles Piez sent a wire to the shipbuilders' employer groupithe Metal Trades Association, telling t@em that if they gave in to union demands, the government would cancel their steel allotment.<br>
<br>
But instead of going to the Metal Trades Association the telegram went to the Metal Trades Council, and so the unions learned that Piez had doublecrossed them by outwardly granting a <B>free hand</B> to negotiate after the armistice then threatening employers who negotiated. One version of the story says that the shipbuilders<br>
had the telegram misdelivered so that the unions would vent their anger on Piez and not on them.<br>
<br>
Another is that the smaller Seattle shipbuilders got Piez to send the telegram because they could not afford new contracts while Skinner and Eddy could.  Another is that Piez was frightened of the power of Seattle's unions.  Another claims that the shipbuilders had the telegram misdelivered to get the unions to break the govemment's hold on the shipbuilding industry.  Parts of all these explanations could well be true, and all are plausible under the circumstances.  In any event, the shipyards were struck on January 21, 1919, when about thirty-five thousand workers walked off the job.<br>
<br>
Thus far, with or without the misdelivered telegram, the story, of economic squeeze and labor unrest, seems a familiar one.  But some thing happened, not just in the Metal Trades Council, not just among those workers we associate with the left.  It was in its way so extraordinary that if we could understand it, we would understand a good deal about Seattle.<br>
<br>
At the beginning no one thought of a general strike, and no more than a few people had ever heard the phrase.  The idea at first was to strike in sympathy with the shipyard workers because a show of force and solidarity like that surely would be good and helpful.<br>
<br>
The more the workers became convinced that the government, or the shipbuilders, or the newspapers, or Mayor Ole Hanson, or all employers were out to crush the power of labor, the more the idea of a general strike seemed attractive.  Conversely, the more anyone tried to say just what would be gained by such a strike, the more confused and apprehensive many workers got.<br>

So, when David Skinner, who had been thought friendly to labor because of his high wages, wired Piez in Washington that the strike was the work of "radical leaders whose real desire is to disrupt the whole organization of society," he provided the workers with just the target they needed.<br>
<br>
When the local and national press insisted the rank and file did not want to strike, they too offered themselves as a target.lwhen the largest local union in the world, the Boilermakers' Local 104, voted unanimously in favor of the shipyard strike, h@ey gave great impetus to a union of all Seattle labor in a more genera s * . vo e was taken on January 26, and the next day union leaders met to sound out opinion and discovered that many unions, including some of the more conservative ones-the roofers, the cooks, the hotel maids-had already indicated sympathy with the idea of a general strike.<br>
<br>
Despite protests from some unions that any breach of an authorized contract violated the principles on which the unions were based, it was agreed that if a majority of the unions voted to have a general strike, then on February 2 a mass meeting would be held to decide what to do next.<br>
<br>
In The Seattle General Strike Robert Friedheim describes some of the ensuing events:<br>
<br>
Even before the committees could effectively organize themselves, five more Seattle unions reported their members had voted to strike: the structural iron workers, the newsboys, the engineers in the gas plant and the public schools, Carpenters' Local 1335, and Barbers' Local 195. . . . Night after night, as locals held their meetings, votes for a general strike continued to roll in.  Electrical Workers'Local 77, Milkman's Local 338, Leather Workers' Local 40, Hotel Maids' Local 528, and the jewelry workers' local all certified officially that their members were willing to strike.<br>
<br>
The names of these unions show that this was not in the usual sense a class matter.  Some of these unions had been in existence as long as the A.F. of L., and members of the skilled crafts and the small local service unions had no reason to ally themselves with large unions like the Boilermakers, to say nothing of the I.W.W. Of those reporting by January 29, only the gas workers and the federal employees were against the strike.<br>
<br>
Of course, all members of all unions were not in favor, but it is surprising that 99 out of 101 unions had majorities in favor.  By the time of the February 2 mass meeting the point to be discussed no longer was whether there would be a strike, but how it would take place.<br>
<br>
What had happened to produce this great show of sympathy and antagonism? Had there been a referendum on the war sometime in
1918, a considerable majority would have said they were for it, since not to be for the war was to be unpatriotic, disloyal, a traitor.  But there was, very obviously, a strong feeling against people in government and especially in industry who seemed to be reaping huge profits in money and power from the war.<br>
<br>
There is good evidence that in all the Allied countries, including the United States, many people fought and worked willingly in the war effort though they distrusted and even hated their leaders.<br>
<br>
The common people, emerging from the darkness of ages, were suspicious and fearful of people with money and power and, at this point, no moral legislation and no sudden access to the bourgeois class could allay those feelings, and no assurances offered by newspapers or governments or employers could either.  We know, furthermore, that what was happening in Seattle was not happening elsewhere, and from that we can draw at least two conclusions.<br>
<br>
First, working people in Seattle had not become completely settled or completely cynical and had retained some of the idealism, be it bourgeois or radical, on which so much of the westward expansion of the country had been based.  Second, moneyed people in Seattle had lost or had hidden whatever ide alism they had, so they seemed to the workers only to be the enemy.<br>
<br>
Anna Louise Strong's is the best account of the meetings of February 2 and after:<br>
<br>
The General Strike Committee, composed of more than three hundred delegates from one hundred and ten unions, met all day Sunday, February 2, 1919, They faced and disregarded the national officers of craft unions, who were telegraphing orders from the East.  They met the threats of the Seattle Health Department to jail drivers of garbage wagons if garbage was not removed, by agreeing to permit the collection of "wet garbage only" on special permit under the strikers' control.  They rejected as strike slogan the motto "We have nothing to lose but our chains and a whole world to win" in favor of "Together We Win." For they reasoned that they had a good deal to lose-jobs at good wages with which they were buying silk shirts, pianos, and homes.  They wanted solidarity but not class war.  Then so little did they realize the problems before them that they fixed the strike for the following Thursday at 10 A.m. and adjourned to meet on Thursday evening after the strike should have started, meantime referring any new problems that might arise to a rather hastily elected "Committee of Fifteen - "<br>
<br>
Strong's jibes at the lunchpail unions with their pianos and silk shirts perhaps shows a little too clearly that she had had such things and had rejected them.  It also shows that the strikers were neither transients nor radical nor rabble, and that she
shared the enthusiasm, however naive, of the others.<br>
<br>
She wrote in an editorial in the Union-Record two days before the strike: "We are undertaking the most tremendous move ever made by labor in this country, a move that will lead-No One Knows Where! We do not need hysteria! We need the iron march of labor!" She and many others saw that the strikers could stay united only if they did not try to say where they were heading:<br>
<br>
Later when I was arrested, this editorial was one of the counts against me.  Its very vagueness saved me.  "No one knows where"-the prosecution claimed this threatened anarchy.  The defense retorted that it merely admitted the fact that the future is unknown.  Neither gave the real essence of those words.  They appealed to the faith of the pioneer in inevitable progress; they stirred the passion of the march to the undiscovered West.  Yet they carefully avoided battle.<br>
<br>
Is the idea of a march to the undiscovered West in 1919 preposterous? Eight years later George Cotterill was still saying the northwest was "the world's outpost of outlook and opportunity, the place of vision and achievement." Thirty, forty, and fifty years after 1919 people still came west, many feeling and saying something very close to what Strong says here.<br>
<br>
The strike happened.  At 10:00 A.m. Thursday, February 6, the city stopped.  No work was done, except for the setting up of food lines, the delivery of drugs to hospitals and milk to babies, the maintenance of electric power-all at the direction of the Committee of Fifteen.  No one seems to have expected that the result would be the usual result of inactivity: silence.  Workers had been urged to stay home, and so they did.<br>
<br>
The streets were occupied only by children and dogs, and it was hard even for them to do much when everything else was silent.  There were squabbles about control of the City Light plant, and many outside the labor movement were nervous about what might happen next; but as an initial show of peaceful force, the strike was a total success.<br>
<br>
That was as far as anyone had planned.  Revolutionaries wanted working people to assume control of the city's manufacture, government, and services; more conservative people felt one show of strength was enough and quickly wanted to get back to work; most seemed simply unclear.  They may have thought the employers and the city officials would surrender, though no one planned what to do if they did.<br>
<br>
The Committee of Fifteen, with the power of the city in their hands, kept things running smoothly but made no plans, and the Union-Record was not full of ideas about the future.  So when the
other side moved, the strikers could do little beyond saying they<br>
would or would not cooperate.<br>
<br>
Anna Louise Strong's editorial gained wide national circulation and was widely interpreted as a revolutionary document, in which case the strike had to be broken.  Mayor Ole Hanson began to see himself as a patriotic strikebreaker.  The National Guard was called out, and Hanson said their presence began the stemming of the revolutionary tide.  He then said he would declare martial law.<br>
<br>
As the labor leaders told him, Hanson's moves were fraudulent, designed to interpret the situation falsely to the rest of the country, because the troops were not needed, martial law was not needed, and the number of arrests on February 6 and 7 was two-thirds the normal number.<br>
<br>
Hanson, though, felt he had to do something to indicate he was a real tiger, and so on Friday evening he sent this notice to the Committee of Fifteen: "I hereby notify you that unless the sympathy strike is called off by 8 o'clock tomorrow morning, February 8, 1919, I will take advantage of the protection offered this city by the national govemment and operate all the essential services."<br>
<br>
This may have gained Hanson the support of business people in Seattle and of Good Citizens elsewhere, but the strikers were not about to be forced into anything, and they refused.<br>
<br>
On Saturday afternoon the Committee of Fifteen gave the parent General Strike Committee a resolution denouncing Charles Piez and Ole Hanson, declaring the strike a success, and urging everyone back to work after midnight that night.  The leaders seemed inclined to support the resolution, but their rank and file opposed it, and the resolution was rejected that night.<br>
<br>
No one worked the following day, Sunday, and by Monday enough cracks had appeared in the solid front to convince the Committee of Fifteen that continuation of the strike could only lead to factions within the movement.  On that afternoon it urged everyone to walk off on Monday but to go back to work Tuesday noon.  Most of those working on Monday stayed on the job, and by Tuesday all but a few went back to work.  The strike was over.<br>
<br>
It was hard not to see the strike as a failure.  The men had gotten nothing, really, and Ole Hanson had gotten himself onto the lecture circuit as an expert on crushing red revolutions.  Strong offers this analysis:<br>
<br>
Shall one blame the yellow leaders who sabotaged the strike and wished to end it? Such a charge is easy to make-and true.  But it is more to the point to ask why it happened that as soon as any
worker was made a leader he wanted to end that strike.  A score of times in those five days I saw it happen.  Workers in the ranks felt the thrill of massed power which they trusted their leaders to carry to victory.<br>
<br>
But as soon as one of these workers was put on a responsible committee, he also wished to stop "before there is riot and blood." The strike could produce no leaders willing to keep it going.  All of us were red in the ranks and yellow as leaders.  For we lacked all intention of real battle; we expected to drift into power.<br>
<br>
We loved the emotion of a better world coming, but all of our leaders and not a few of the rank and file had much to lose in the old world.  The general strike put into our hands the organized life of the city-all except the guns.  We could last only until they started shooting; we were one gigantic bluff.  That expert in bluffing, Ole Hanson, saw this on the second day of the struggle.<br>
<br>
Strong's instincts surely are the right ones.  The strike didn't go on because the leaders did not know where to take it and began to fear the outcome.  Ole Hanson could prove that "Together We Win" and "No One Knows Where" were shams as political gestures simply by waiting the strikers out, bluffing on his part, and watching the strike collapse.<br>
<br>
It is important for us, however, not simply to see Strong's analysis as the last word or the slogans as political gestures.  When Strong says the workers were red in the ranks but yellow as leaders, she is only saying that people like Harry Ault and James Duncan did not feel in need of revolution.<br>
<br>
They had a stake in the labor movement, but they also had a stake in Seattle, which was their home as well as where they had come to power and had seen labor become stronger than anywhere else in the country.  That did not abate their rage against Ole Hanson or David Skinner or Charles Piez, but it had to shape their vision of what they had, what they might lose.<br>
<br>
Many of labor's best leaders had come to power under the unreal conditions of the war.  Harry Ault had in 1917 achieved his long-time dream of editing a labor daily mostly because the great increase in the labor force had inflated his circulation.  But the achievement of the dream itself had to make him cautious.  The war had produced villains for many workers in the form of their employers making huge profits, but it had also given the workers themselves power to fight.<br>
<br>
The more the worker won, the more he had to lose; the more that Seattle was his home, the more cautious he became when made a leader.  Nothing shows the way Seattle became simultaneously radical and bourgeois more clearly than the success and failure of the General Strike.<br>

For it was a success.  Compared to the outcries of the newspapers, the hysteria of many Good Citizens, and the opportunism of Ole<br>
Hanson, the strikers were wonderful: practical, decent, idealistic, scrupulously democratic, able for a moment at least to harmonize the huge energies of a great variety of people.<br>
<br>
In that moment the natural pettiness to which flesh is heir, the self-seeking that a fragmented craft union system builds into itself, the anger and disillusion that were exacerbated by the war were abrogated.  But it was a local success, and was short-lived because the very ingredients that went into making it happen in the first place contributed to its demise the moment it became clear that very few people wanted a revolution.<br>
<br>
Too many had too much to lose in the old Seattle, and they got into more than they had really bargained for. it was a show of hope and desire, not the first step in a revolution, and the conditions that had made the hope possible were already passing as they became articulated in the strike.<br>
<br>
So it was a failure too.  A year later, Lincoln Steffens came to Seattle, and Anna Louise Strong told him of all the disasters that had overtaken the strikers:<br>
<br>
Its been getting worse for months," I answered.  "The Central Labor Council meetings that used to have such fine speeches from workers all over the world have turned into nasty wrangles between carpenters and plumbers for control of little jobs.  I think it began when the shipyards closed and the metal trades workers began to leave.<br>
<br>
Those workers' enterprises of which we were so proud began to go to pieces.  And everyone who took part in them got blamed.  Now some of the members of our staff are attacking Harry Ault, our editor, most horribly; one of them said that if I didn't join the attack, they would 'rub my name in the dirt.' it was a man<br>
I used to like who threatened me."<br>
<br>
"So you are siding with Harry?" Steffens asked.<br>
<br>
"Well, no, I can't exactly side with Harry." Under the questions I began to analyze.  "I think it's terrible the way our paper is going.  We are beginning to be bossed by advertisers.  When the labor movement was united business firms had to advertise in our paper.  But now they come creeping up on us and make us soften our tone.<br>
<br>
"Harry is between the devil and the deep sea.  I think he's not bold enough; he ought to defy those advertisers even if we have to have a smaller paper.  But the paper is his child; he dreamed of it when he used to work as a small boy in a printing office and sleep on the table at night.  He gave his best years tO make this paper; I hate to see these upstarts call him traitor.  But I can't
agree with Harry either; he's begun to say the workers are ungrateful. one can't say that."<br>
<br>
Under circumstances as sad and crushing as that, Steffens told Strong, she had no choice but to leave, to go to Moscow.  Which she did, launched on a strange and grand career that would end with her being one of the few westerners to gain and keep the admiration of Mao Tse-tung.<br>
<br>
But for Harry Ault, and for thousands of others like him, leaving was not what they wanted.  Seattle was where they lived, where they had achieved at least a small measure of their dreams, where they had to stay and watch those dreams crumble.  Robert Friedheim in The Seattle General Strike concludes that "in the days ahead they were to learn that it was worse than a failure-it was a disaster."<br>
<br>
Clearly, for many, it was that.  But Friedheim implies that the strike might have been a different kind of success from the success it was, and that the subsequent fragmentation of the labor movement would not have happened had the strike never taken place.  The implications are false.  The war gave the radicals and the labor movement as a whole some rather unreal hopes, and it also gave many of them a home.<br>
<br>
Strong loved it when people coming in from outside made great speeches to the Central Labor Council.  But those making the speeches either went or stayed, and if they stayed, the less revolutionary they became, just as, when the wartime boom was over, the less powerful they became.  Both the radicals and the whole labor movement had to begin to find out all over again what their resources were, and had to live with the bitter knowledge that they were fewer than they had thought.<br>
<br>
For the opportunity, the real opportunity, had been mostly lost well before the end of the war, and the strike was really only a sign that some were able to respond to the resultant dangers bravely, if briefly.  There was talk in some of the newspapers near the end of the war about a postwar boom in shipbuilding, but that turned out to be overoptimistic.<br>
<br>
The coming of the war had delayed the arrival of the diminished and more rigid Seattle economy, but when the war was over, the trouble was rudely exposed for everyone to see.  Whatever might have happened after the strike, the fact of a general economic slump speeded up the time when the carpenters would quarrel with the plumbers for control of the little jobs, because Seattle was suffering from a national slump very much as Tacoma did from the 1893 panic, and it was in 1919 powerless, as Tacoma had been then.<br>
<br>
As for the radicals, many of them left.  Quite interestingly, those who stayed did not become restless again as their bitterness
increased, but they stayed as if to savor the taste of that bitterness.  Harvey O'Connor in Revolution in Seattle describes, though unfortunately not in great detail, the later lives of people who had been here during the heyday of Socialist and radical thought and work, who saw the strike, the collapse of labor, the rise of Dave Beck, and the coming of the New Deal, which they saw as a mere palliative.<br>
<br>
They neither left, like Anna Louise Strong, nor became assimilated into the bourgeois working class; over fifty years later, they could keep the old dream alive, hating the Boeing Company with the same passion as they hated Skinner or Weyerhaeuser or Stone and Webster in the old days.  How many there are is impossible to determine, though enough so that most long-time natives of Seattle know one or two or many.<br>
<br>
Whatever we write of the history of Seattle after this first crisis, we must try to account for the curious fact that so many who seem to hate it so much do not leave.<br>
<br>
In 1919 one famous man visited Seattle, and another who had not yet achieved his fame returned home to it after his wartime hitch in the navy.  The visitor was Woodrow Wilson making his whirlwind tour in an effort to gain support for the League of Nations, coming to Seattle shortly after his paralyzing stroke.  John Dos Passos fantasizes a small picture of the reception Wilson received:<br>
<br>
"...in Seattle the wobblies whose leaders were in I . ail, in Seattle the wobblies whose leaders had been lynched, who'd been shot down like dogs, in Seattle the wobblies lined four blocks and when Wilson passed, stood silent with their arms folded, staring at the great liberal as he was hurried past in his car, huddled in his overcoat, haggard with fatigue, one side of his face twitching.<br>
<br>
"The men in overalls, the workingstiffs let him pass in silence after all the other blocks of handclapping and patriotic cheers."<br>
<br>
Resolute, righteous, in some respects right, faces turned to the past, the Wobblies died, crushed as much by the ensuing peace as by the previous war.  That was one Seattle in 1919, a city that had lost more than the Wobblies ever realized.<br>
<br>
The other Seattle was the one seen by Dave Beck when he came home and observed what Wilson had seen: anarchy, idealism, disillusion.  Murray Morgan writes: "Beck thought the strike had been wrong, criminally wrong; it had been impetuous, it had been pointless; it brought disrepute to Labor and had won nothing.  He was disgusted with the idealists who had dreamed it up.<br>
<br>
He would no longer answer when the Wobblies greeted him as a'fellow worker.' " Resolute, righteous, in some respects right,
face turned to the future, Beck went back to driving truck, soliciting business for his boss, organizing the laundry teamsters.  That was another Seattle in 1919.  Its crisis past, it could not tolerate the Wobblies, and was ready for the ministrations of Dave Beck.<br>

THE SEATTLE GENERAL STRIKE.<br>
<br>
Murray C. Morgan, "The Seattle General Strike," <B>Skid Road, an informal portrait of Seattle.</B> New York: The Viking Press, 1960. p. 199-219.<br>
<br>
A general strike, by dictionary definition, is a strike in all industries of a locality or nation, generally in sympathy for a smaller group of workers.  Theoretically it brings about complete cessation of business.<br>
<br>
The first strike in the United States to meet that definition took place in Seattle.  It began at ten a.m. on Thursday, February 6, 1919 and lasted until February <B>11. </B>Sixty thousand workers went off their jobs, and they did bring about an almost complete cessation of business.<br>
<br>
When the strike ended no one was sure where it had led, but the effects were far-reaching.  The strike led the mayor of Seattle to dream of becoming President of the United States; it started a young Seattle woman, Anna Louise Strong, who had been a member of the school board, along a path that led her to Moscow-and back; it gave impetus to a series of Justice Department raids in which young J. Edgar Hoover first showed aptitude in rounding up radicals; it frightened millions of Americans into believing that revolution was just around the comer, and it cheered thousands with the same thought; it gave labor a sense of power and a sense of frustration; it disillusioned a young truck driver named Dave Beck.<br>
<br>
The general strike influenced the thinking of a generation in Seattle.  It framed the world in which they lived.<br>
<br>
The strike started in the shipyards.  Seattle's shipbuilding industry had expanded enormously during the war.  Though the fighting had ended, the war was not legally over and a Shipbuilding Adjustment Board-established by agreement among the United States Shipping Board, the Navy, and the presidents of the shipbuilding crafts-still supervised the shipyards.
Shortly after the German surrender, the Shipbuilding Adjustment Board announced a new, uniform, nationwide wage scale.  Western workers were outraged.  The cost of living was "slightly higher west of the Rockies" and previous agreements had allowed them higher wages than in Eastern yards.  They appealed to the board for a revised scale, and they asked the shipyard owners directly for higher wages and shorter hours.  They asked $8 a day for skilled workers, $5.50 for unskilled workers, and a 44-hour week.  Their demands were turned down.<br>
<br>
Feeling among the workers ran high, especially after they learned -through the delivery of a telegram, intended for the employers' Metal Trade Association, to the workers' Metal Trades Council that the employers were willing to raise wages but were threatened with cancellation of their government contracts and loss of steel priorities if they raised the scale without the board's permission.<br>
<br>
The Seattle Metal Trades Council called for a strike vote among its seventeen member unions.  The delegates from one of the unions voted against the strike; six unions voted for it but not by the majority required in their constitutions; ten approved without qualification.  So by a vote of <B>10 </B>to 7 the strike was approved.  On January 21, 35,000 workers walked out.<br>
<br>
The next day the Metal Trades Council asked the Seattle Central Labor Council to call its members out in sympathy.  The council put it up to the individual unions.  Most of the local union leaders were against the strike.  The national policy of the American Federation of Labor was against the use of the strike as a political protest.<br>
<br>
Many locals had good agreements which they would jeopardize if they went out, and the national headquarters of the unions were solidly opposed to "political adventuring." But many local labor leaders were in Chicago attending a rally for the release of Tom Mooney, and in their absence, the rank and file voted.  In union after union they voted for a strike.<br>
<br>
The carpenters, perhaps the most conservative of all unions, voted to strike.  So did the typographers.  So did the musicians and the longshoremen, the stage hands and the mill worker's, the hotel maids and the teamsters.  One after another, a hundred and ten unions voted to strike.  The Wobblies were not represented on the Central Labor Council, but they sent delegates to applaud the strike votes; the Japanese unions, kept off the council by racial restrictions, sent delegates to say they'd strike too.<br>
<br>
A general strike was approved overwhelmingly, but no one knew how to run one.  It was one thing to walk off the job at some plant and try to keep strike-breakers from walking in.  It was altogether different to stop the industrial life of a city Of 300,000- It had never been done in America.  No one was sure how
to go about it.<br>
<br>
A General Strike Committee was formed.  It was made up of three delegates from each striking union, plus three from the Central Labor Council.  The committee, with more than three hundred members, was too large to function.  Its first meeting, on Sunday, February <B>2., </B>lasted all day.  After sixteen hours of uninterrupted talk, the committee delegated power to an executive committee, known as the Committee of Fifteen, and adjourned until Thursday evening-the night after the strike was to start.<br>
<br>
The Committee of Fifteen became the center of power in Seattle.  It decided who would work after Thursday and who wouldn't.  Here is a list of typical requests received by the committee and recorded by the strike historian:<br>
<br>
King County Commissioners ask  for  janitors  for  City-County  Building. Refused.<br>
<br>
F. A. Rust asks for janitors for the Labor Temple.  Refused.<br>
Cooperative Market asks for janitors because of the food they handle for strike kitchens.  Granted.<br>
<br>
Teamsters Union asks permission to carry oil for Swedish hospital.  Approved.<br>
<br>
Retail Drug Clerks ask for instructions in view of medical needs of city.  Referred to public welfare committee which decides that certain prescription counters remain open, but the drugstores are not to sell any other merchandise.<br>
<br>
Telephone girls requested to stay on the job temporarily.<br>
<br>
Longshoremen ask permission to handle government mails, customs, and baggage.  Permit given for mails and customs but not for baggage.  Plumbers Union given permit to keep seven plumbers on duty for emergency calls.  Streetcar workers given permission to appoint six watchmen to safeguard car barns.<br>
<br>
C.R. Case, chief of street department, and backed by mayor, requests that street lighting be allowed "to check hooliganism and riots." Confused discussion over this due to the technical difficulty of separating light from power: City Light finally allowed to run.<br>
<br>
Robert Bridges, who was elected to presidency of the public port by votes of progressive workers, appeals on behalf of farm products in cold storage, saying, "The big companies store in private warehouses, getting power from Seattle Electric which your strike cannot touch.  Do not ruin the small farmers, who store in the public warehouses with power from City Light." This also influences retention of City Light in full operation.
There were hundreds of details for the Committee of Fifteen to arrange.  They made sure there would be milk for children and for the hospitals, that the hospitals could get laundry, that water pressure would be kept up.  They set up strike kitchens and arranged for food to be supplied; anyone could buy a meal, but strikers got cut rates.<br>
<br>
They set up an auxiliary police force of "labor guards" to help the city police.  All this they did with considerable foresight, but one thing they did not do: they did not state their aims.  They did not state them because they did not know them.  They were not sure how long the strike was to last, whether it was merely a gesture of solidarity with the shipyard workers, whether it was a move toward educating the workers in the problems of running a city, whether it was an attempt to touch off a nationwide general strike.<br>
<br>
No one knew whether the gun was loaded.<br>
<br>
But at ten a.m., Thursday, February 6, exactly on schedule, America's first general strike started.<br>
<br>
Mayor Ole Hanson was a friend of labor.  He said so himself, loud and often.  When the strike was first called he asked some of the labor leaders to lunch and over coffee he said, "Boys, I want my street lights and water supply and hospitals.  I don't care if you shut down all the rest of the city."<br>
<br>
He got his street lights and water supply and hospitals; he got many other services designed to prevent hardship, and he also got a chance to make a national name for himself.  As a friendly reporter once said of him, "There are really two Ole Hansons-the one who talks and the one who acts; as a talker he is often erratically radical, but his actions are always rational." That was correct.<br>
<br>
Holy Ole, as his foes called him, might look like a political whirling dervish as he spun from the Republicans to the Progressives to Wilson and back to the Republicans, but he kept his eye on the ball.  He had been in Seattle sixteen years when the general strike started, and by any standards he had done well for himself.<br>
<br>
Ole was a small man with red hair parted just a little left of center and a high voice that seemed tinged with hysteria when he made a public speech.  "He just seemed to be wound up too tight," a political associate of Hanson's said years later.  "I never heard anything like Old Ole until Hitler came along.  He'd get so worked up he'd be almost screaming.  He sure sounded sincere." He had great vitality and an ambition that almost tore him apart; if he ever doubted that he was on the way to political success he did not show his doubts.<br>

There is no question about his courage.<br>
<br>
Hanson was working in Butte, Montana, in 1900 when he injured his spine; doctors doubted that he would ever walk again.  But Ole's hero was Teddy Roosevelt, and Roosevelt had conquered illness by exercise.  Hanson bought an old covered wagon and rigged up a combination harness and sling, which he fastened to the rear ofthe wagon; it enabled him to walk behind the prairie schooner.  With his wife driving the wagon Hanson trudged along behind.  He walked the seven hundred miles from Butte to Seattle and reached the Sound country physically <B>fit.</B><br>
<br>
When Hanson and his family camped their first night on Beacon Hill and looked down on the lights of the Skid Road and the business district, Ole made his first political speech.  He later recalled telling the idlers who had gathered to inspect his covered wagon that he would be mayor of Seattle some day.  But first there was the problem of earning a living.  He bought a grocery on Beacon Hill, sold it "after learning that the grocer is the king of philanthropists," went into the insurance business and left it when a real estate man told him that no insurance agent in Seattle owned his own home.  The real-estate man owned his house, so Ole became a real-estate agent.<br>
<br>
As a dealer in property, Hanson never eclipsed the big holders but he did well enough to be able to turn his talents to politics.  He was a reformer and he found his first issue in race-track gambling.<br>
The Seattle race track had been getting a bad press.  An embezzler had gambled away a firm's funds there; a young man killed himself after losing his inheritance; the track was a hangout for gamblers and pimps and hoodlums.  Hanson picked the track as his private political issue, ran for the state legislature on a "Ban Race-track Gambling" platform, and won.  It was proof of Holy Ole's energy that as a freshman representative he was able to have his anti-racetrack bill the first one in the legislative hopper and the first major law to be passed.<br>
<br>
Hanson ran first as a Republican.  He worshiped Teddy Roosevelt and named his second son for him. (It was a Seattle joke that Hanson named his six boys after the men he most admired, in de-
clining order: Ole Hanson, Jr., Theodore Roosevelt Hanson, William Taft Hanson, Eugene Field Hanson-after the poet and columnist-Bob La Follette Hanson, Lloyd George Hanson.) He "moosed it"-his own expression-with Teddy, then swung to Wilson in <B>1916 </B>because "he kept us out of war."<br>
<br>
But once the United States declared war on the Central Powers, Hanson became a home-front belligerent.  In <B>1918 </B>he told the voters with a straight face that he was running for mayor as "a patriotic duty." Ole junior was old enough for the army but not healthy enough, and Hanson imagined he could hear his own parents saying, "Our country is at war.  Others are going to the front, but you can serve at home.  Do your duty."
The voters also did their duty as Hanson saw it.  They elected him mayor to succeed Hi Gill, and on the March day that Hanson was elected mayor, the first female member of Seattle's school board was recalled.  The issue was pacifism and radicalism.<br>
<br>
Even more than Hanson, Anna Louise Strong was a newcomer to Seattle.  A handsome woman in her early thirties, she was of pre-
Revolutionary stock on both sides of her family.  She had been graduated from Bryn Mawr and had taken graduate work at Oberlin and her Ph.D. at Chicago.  After a brief term as assistant editor of a Fundamentalist weekly and a period recovering from a nervous breakdown brought about by her love for a married man, she organized a venture known as the "Know Your City" Institute -a type of exhibition dedicated to telling Western newcomers about their communities.<br>
<br>
From that she moved to child-welfare exhibits in various cities, only to have more skillful promoters organize her out of a job.  She worked for a while with the United States Children's Bureau, then in <B>1916 </B>came to Seattle to make a home for her widowed father, a minister, who had moved west from Nebraska some years before.<br>
<br>
Actually she spent little time making a home.  She was a passion-
ate mountain climber and organized cooperative summer camps in the Cascades.  She led the first winter climb of Mount Hood.  She guided parties across the glaciers on Mount Rainier.  She quickly attracted the attention of Seattle, and less than a year after she came to town she was prevailed upon to run for the school board.<br>
<br>
She was a natural: the only woman candidate, the only<br>
candidate with a Ph.D., the only candidate to have published a book (she'd written a play, a novel, and a book of poems), the only candidate with practical experience in education.  Labor was for her-her father was a progressive; the Municipal League, which was then a liberal organization, and the Commercial Club, a lively group of small businessmen who had organized in opposition to the Chamber of Commerce, both endorsed her.  Women were for her, and she won easily.<br>
<br>
Once on the board, however, she found there was little she could do. Her concern was with the theory of education; board meetings took up such practical matters as plumbing fixtures.  She found her official duties "the most completely boring of my life." She was not bored long.<br>
<br>
The year of her election was the year of the Everett troubles.  The AFL Shingle weavers were on strike in Everett, thirty miles north of Seattle, and the IWW was supporting them.  Late in August the Everett police rounded up the Shingle weaver pickets, took them to a narrow trestle, and beat them up.  The next day there
was a riot in which the police routed the strikers.  The Wobblies decided to reinforce the Shingle weavers (who had not asked for their support) with a free-speech demonstration.<br>
<br>
It was a Wob political tactic to send so many soap boxers into towns that restricted free speech that the jails couldn't handle the crowd; but this time the demonstrators, forty-one of them, were arrested, taken to the city limits, and made to run a gantlet of deputies armed with clubs and slug-shots.  A week later the Wobblies tried again.<br>
<br>
They chartered two Seattle boats, the Verona and the Calista, and on Sunday, November 5, 1916 280 demonstrators sailed for Everett.  Pinkerton agents in Seattle wired that they were coming.  When the Verona tied up at the Everett dock, the sheriff and <B>200</B> deputies were waiting.  The sheriff asked the Wobs to point out their leaders.  They refused.<br>
<br>
Somebody started shooting.  Before the Verona cast off and moved away, five of the demonstrators and two of the vigilantes were dead, thirty-one demonstrators and nineteen vigilantes wounded.  When the two ships got back to Seattle, everyone on board was arrested .2 Seventy-four were charged with murder.<br>
<br>
On March 5, <B>1</B>917, the first of the defendants, Thomas Tracy, was put on trial for his life.  Anna Louise Strong covered the trial for the New York Post, and the testimony she heard changed her life.<br>
<br>
Years later she summarized her dispatches by saying, "The news was that at every stage the Everett police and private lumber guards took the initiative in beating and shooting workers for speaking in the streets.  The lumber guards on the dock had begun the shooting and continued firing as the Verona pulled away; yet none of them was arrested.  The men on trial for murder were not indi-
vidually shown to have even possessed a gun; it was enough that someone on their ship, a comrade or agent provocateur, had fired."<br>
<br>
Tracy was acquitted.  Judge Ronald dismissed the charges against the other seventy-three defendants.<br>
<br>
Anna Louise Strong came to have deep sympathy for the Wobblies as she listened to the trial.  She thought of them as "direct in-
heritors of the fighting pioneer," who were "engaged in the struggle of men once free and expecting freedom but now slowly, inexplicably, irretrievably enslaved . . . waging a stark, bloody fight for elementary human rights."<br>
<br>
Her growing partisanship for the tough "class warriors" of the Skid Road merged with another new cause that had come to dominate her thinking: pacifism.  The agitation for American entry into the war horrified her.  Her father was a religious pacifist; she shared his moral scruples about killing and to them added her economic conviction that war was merely a way of making the rich
richer and the poor dead.  She joined every group she heard of that opposed American participation.<br>
<br>
She fought conscription, believing it to be a device for forcing the poor to fight the battles of the rich.  When the United States finally did go in, she felt that the country she knew and loved was dead.  She ran away to the mountains.  There, after a summer of brooding nights and days of desperate climbing, she came across some copies of a small Socialist weekly, the Seattle Call.  Its anti-war sentiments were her sentiments.  She rushed back to Seattle and became a reporter for the paper.<br>
<br>
As a Socialist propagandist she worked herself to the point of exhaustion.  But the paper was small and almost no one noticed that the female member of the school board was preaching pacifism in a radical weekly.  It was not until Hulet Wells, a Socialist and the former president of the Central Labor Council, was put on trial for obstructing the war effort that Miss Strong's political position attracted citywide attention.<br>
<br>
Even then she might have avoided trouble had she been so minded.  The principle charge against Wells was that he had circulated an anti-conscription leaflet.  Professional witnesses appeared against him to swear it was paid for by German gold.  Miss Strong went to the defense attorney, George Vanderveer, an able man who had abandoned a lucrative private practice to defend left-wing causes.<br>
<br>
She told him that as secretary of the group that had originally sponsored the leaflet she could name the prominent Seattle people who had subscribed to its sentiments and who had contributed funds for its publication.  To do this would make her many enemies among the people who had changed their views; it would also expose her as an ally of the far Left.  But her testimony would be valuable because she was "the best known of the respectable women in town."<br>
<br>
Vanderveer realized how much she had to lose.  "Young lady," he told her, "my advice to you personally is that you need a guardian to keep you out of this.  But my statement as an attorney for the defense is that you offer us our best chance of winning." She testified.  The best the defense could get was a hung jury.  Wells was tried again and convicted.  A recall petition was started against Anna Louise Strong.<br>
<br>
It languished at first but gained impetus when she sat beside an anarchist friend, Louise Olivereau, during her trial on the charge that she had sent anti-war leaflets to soldiers.  Miss Olivereau, a clerk-typist for the Wobblies, refused to defend herself.  She was convicted and the school-board member stood convicted of being her friend.<br>

The recall petitions quickly got enough signatures to put her name on the March ballot. Supporting the recall were most of the middle-class groups that had originally backed her: the Parent-Teachers' Association, the University Women's Club, the Municipal League.<br>
<br>
Opposing it was a new alignment in Seattle politics, an alliance of organized labor as represented by the Central Labor Council, the depressed population of the Skid Road as represented by the Wobblies, and a sprinkling of maverick intellectuals.  This alliance, the clearest political grouping along class lines since the heyday of Mary Kenworthy, was not enough to defeat the recall; but the "viper in the bosom of the school board" was scotched by a slim 2000-vote margin out of a total of 80,000.<br>
<br>
She was soon out of another job.  A mob raided the shop where the Call was printed and broke up the press.  The paper suspended publication, but its place was taken by the Union Record, a daily, supported cooperatively by a group of unions.<br>
<br>
Anna Louise Strong became an editor for the new paper.  In January <B>1919 </B>she went with the Central Labor Council delegation to cover the Chicago labor rally on behalf of Tom Mooney, and she shared the surprise of the Seattle delegates when they learned by telegram that the general strike was called.  She hurried back to Seattle to work for its success.<br>
<br>
Like almost everyone who supported the strike, she didn't know what it was intended to accomplish.  Two days before the strike she wrote an editorial in the Union Record saying so.  It became the most quoted editorial in Seattle's newspaper history:<br>
<br>
THURSDAY AT 10 A.M.<br>
<br>
There will be many cheering, and there will be some who fear.  Both these emotions are useful, but not too much of either.  We are undertaking the most tremendous move ever made by Labor in this country, a move which will lead<br>
<br>
NO ONE KNOWS WHERE<br>
<br>
LABOR WILL FEED THE PEOPLE<br>
<br>
Twelve great kitchens have been offered, and from them food will be distributed by the provision trades at low cost to all.<br>
<br>
LABOR WILL CARE FOR THE BABIES AND THE SICK<br>
<br>
The milk-wagon drivers and the laundry drivers are arranging plans for supplying milk to the babies, invalids, and hospitals, and
taking care of the cleaning of linen for hospitals.<br>
<br>
LABOR WILL PRESERVE ORDER<br>
<br>
The strike committee is arranging for guards and it is expected that the stopping of the cars will keep people at home.<br>
.  .  .<br>
A few hot-headed enthusiasts have complained that strikers only should be fed, and the general public left to endure severe discomfort.  Aside from the inhumanitarian character of such suggestions, let them get this straight:<br>
<br>
NOT THE WITHDRAWAL OF LABOR POWER, BUT THE POWER OF THE WORKERS TO MANAGE WILL WIN THIS STRIKE.<br>
<br>
.  .  .<br>
<br>
The closing down of Seattle's industries, as a mere shutdown, will not affect the great Eastern combinations of capitalists much.  They could let the whole Northwest go to pieces as far as money alone is concerned.<br>
<br>
But, the closing down of the capitalistically controlled industries of Seattle, while the workers organize to feed the people, to care for the babies and the sick, to preserve order-this will move them, for this looks too much like the taking over of power by the workers.<br>
<br>
Labor will not only shut down the industries, but Labor will reopen, under the management of the appropriate trades, such activities as are needed to preserve public health and  public  peace.  if  the  strike continues, Labor may feel led to avoid public suffering by reopening more and more activities,<br>
<br>
UNDER ITS OWN MANAGEMENT<br>
<br>
And this is why we say we are starting on a road that leads-<br>
<br>
NO ONE KNOWS WHERE!<br>
<br>
At ten o'clock Thursday morning whistles sounded in the mills and on the ships at the docks.  With that signal the industrial activity of the city came to a halt.  Streetcar service stopped.  Schools let out.  Banks locked their doors.  Restaurants shut down.<br>
<br>
The movies closed.  Presses and linotypes went silent and lead cooled in the pots.  Clerks left the groceries, the dry goods stores, the markets.  Elevator boys shut the gates of their lifts.  Maids stopped making the hotel beds.  From Georgetown to Ballard things quieted down.
That was the greatest surprise of all-the quiet.  The whines of the saws, the clatter of streetcars and trucks, the honk of taxi horns, the creak of the winches, the shouts of newsboys, the pecking of typewriters, the rattle of elevator chains-all were silenced.  People suddenly heard the chirp of sparrows and the moaning of the doves that nested in downtown buildings.  It was so quiet, a striker remarked, you could hear the grass grow; it was so quiet that people were unnerved.<br>
<br>
Many people had expected riot, even revolution.  The night before the strike Mayor Hanson sat in his bedroom in his new fourteen-room house and worked on "plans for defense, including securing cartridges, shot guns and machine guns, and drawing a map showing the places where men were to be stationed, and massing our forces at what I considered strategic points." At dawn that morning a convoy of trucks had rumbled in from Camp Lewis with fifteen hundred soldiers aboard; they were stationed at the armory, alert for trouble.  There was no trouble.<br>
<br>
After the ten o'clock whistle sounded merchants and lawyers and tradesmen and workers stood anxiously in front of their shops<br>
and offices, waiting for what was to come.  The minutes stretched into hours and nothing happened.  A hearse rolled slowly down the street, carrying a placard which read, "Exempted by the Strike Committee." An occasional laundry wagon or private car appeared, and there was a clatter of hoofs on the red-brick streets as a few farsighted commuters rode home on horseback.<br>
<br>
Heavily armed policemen stood at the street corners, passing jokes with people they knew.  Labor guards, wearing arm bands but vested with no real authority, patrolled the industrial district; whenever a crowd gathered, they asked the members to "break it up, fellows" or mentioned that it was a fine day to be home planting potatoes.  Late in the afternoon the streets were almost deserted.<br>
<br>
In the quiet rumors spread.  There were no papers and, of course, no radio.  One rumor was as believable as the next.  The word spread that Mayor Hanson had been assassinated, that the Army was driving the strikers back to work at the points of bayonets, that the strike was spreading across the country, that the workers had announced the confiscation of private property, that the power company's dam had been dynamited, that the Central Labor Temple had been dynamited, that on the far side of town the water supply had been cut and firebugs were at work, that the water system had been poisoned, that homes on the outskirts were being pillaged, that the strike leaders had been shot, that the strike leaders had set up a soviet.  As night fell the police station switchboard was flooded with calls from women pleading for protection.<br>
<br>
The night passed without incident and the second day started as quietly as the first.  But there was a difference: the fear of the
unknown was past.  This was a situation, a thing within bounds; it could be understood and managed.<br>
<br>
Probably the first man to understand the implications of the orderly first day was Ole Hanson; he must have seen that there wasn't going to be violence, that the strikers did not intend to seize property.  He must have understood something the strikers had not even admitted to themselves: that the general strike was not a means to an end but an end in itself.<br>
<br>
There was nothing concrete the strikers could achieve.  The ship-
yard operators could out wait them; the strike might show sympathy but it would not win raises for the men in the shipyards.  Nothing else could be done without violence, and the labor leaders had no stomach for bloodshed; even if they had wanted to seize the factories, they had no arms.  All the strikers could do, sooner or later, was go back to work.<br>
<br>
In a way Hanson smashed the strike.  He smashed it every day for four days in stories he gave to the local United Press bureau, which in turn gave them nationwide play.  He exorcised the strike as "a treasonable Bolshevist uprising," and when the strike died a non-violent death after five days, he went into business as the Savior of Seattle, the Suppressor of Red Rebellion.<br>
<br>
His actual contribution to the end of the strike was a "Proclama-
tion to the People of Seattle" and an "Ultimatum to the Executive Strike Committee." The proclamation, written on the second day of the strike, said:<br>
<br>
By virtue of the authority vested in me as mayor, I hereby guarantee to all the people of Seattle absolute and complete protection.  They should go about their daily work and business in perfect security.  We have fifteen hundred policemen, fifteen hundred regular soldiers from Camp Lewis, and can and will secure, ff necessary, every soldier in the Northwest to protect life, business and property.<br>
<br>
The time has come for every person in Seattle to show his Americanism.  Go about your daily duties without fear.  We will see to it that you have food, transportation, water, light, gas and all necessities.  The anarchists in this community shall not rule its affairs.  All persons violating the laws will be dealt with summarily.<br>
<br>
<B>OLE HANSON, </B>Mayor<br>
<br>
The ultimatum was a warning to the strikers that if the strike was not called off at once the mayor would "operate all essential industries." Hanson sent his secretary to the Labor Temple to read aloud the ultimatum and the proclamation.<br>
<br>
During the recitation, Hanson declared, "the faces of the very men
who had been loudest in egging on the workers turned pale, for they knew we were prepared to go the full limit in defeating their nefarious and un American aims." The strikers' version is that they thought Hanson's ultimatum was just another publicity puff from a blow-hard politician.<br>
<br>
Either way, the strike was in trouble.<br>
<br>
Its very success worked against it: the town was so quiet, there was so little activity, that the strikers lost their feeling of unity.  There was nothing doing.  There were no martyrs.  No pickets had been beaten up.  Nobody had been arrested.  It was hard to stay angry.  In the absence of specific strike aims the men soon wearied of the Iron March of Labor to "No One Knew Where." They had shown they could shut the town down tight.  Now they wanted to get back to work and draw some pay.<br>
<br>
The international officials of the unions wanted them back on the job too.  Men from national headquarters began arriving the day the strike started; every train brought more; they all agreed that the strike was a mistake, that it jeopardized contracts that had been hard to get.  On the third day, the Committee of Fifteen, by a vote of 13 to 1 <B> </B>recommended to the General Strike Committee that the strike be called off.  The parent group voted down the recommendation, but the backbone of the strike was broken.  The strikers learned of the dissension in the ranks of their leaders.<br>
<br>
On the fourth day a number of unions failed to answer the roll call at the Labor Temple; their members were back on the job.  Streetcars were running; beds were being made; presses were rolling.  Hastily the General Strike Committee drafted a request to all the workers that they should form ranks again for one final day; after that everyone would go back to work.<br>
<br>
Some unions agreed, others stayed on the job.  The strike petered out.  On Wednesday, February 12, Lincoln's Birthday, the first general strike in America was over. Ole Hanson celebrated his victory at a desk heaped with flowers, telegrams, and photographer's proofs.<br>
<br>
The flowers and telegrams had come from all over the United States.  The proofs were from Seattle.  Ole had gone out the day before and had the photographs taken.  Now he was trying to pick out the best two.  It was a serious business.  He was going to have a hundred prints made of each and send them to newspapers all over the country so that everyone could see the man who had put down the traitorous bolshevist rebellion and saved America.<br>
<br>
A reporter for a national magazine found him studying the pictures.  Ole was frankly delighted about the publicity he was getting.  "I guess you've got to grab it when it comes along," he
said.  "I'm a great man.  I win.  In six months I lose and it's all over -till the next time.  I thought I had a mighty good labor record in the Legislature but Labor fought me when I ran for mayor.  I told 'em that in six months they'd say I was the best mayor they ever had, and sure enough they came around and made me an honorary member of their biggest union, and gave me a membership card engraved on silver.<br>
<br>
"Now they're giving me hell again.  But that's just the regular thing in public life if you're doing anything.  Every six months you have a different crowd of followers.  This particular time it's about ninety-five per cent.  But that doesn't fool me. I'm taking whatever fame there is in it for me right now."<br>
<br>
There was plenty of fame.  Four national magazines wrote him up. He was on every front page for two or three days.  Finally he was asked to go on a lecture tour, an offer that was too good to turn down-all that money, all those audiences, and the Republican nominating convention only a year away.<br>
<br>
Ole resigned as mayor of Seattle and toured the country, explaining how the "loathsome monster of anarchy had roamed the streets of my fair city" and how he had saved the day.  He wrote a book about it too, Americanism versus Bolshevism, and it went on sale a few months before the presidential nominations were made.  The Republicans chose Harding.  Hanson returned to Seattle, sold his property, and moved to California.<br>
<br>
Anna Louise Strong was assigned by the Central Labor Council<br>
to write a history of the strike.  She was at her desk in her father's house one afternoon not long after the men had gone back to work when the telephone rang.  Harry Ault, the editor of the Union Record, was calling.  "A deputy is here in the office to arrest us," he said.  "You'd better hurry down and get it over."<br>
<br>
She took a taxi to the Labor Temple, where a deputy handed her an indictment charging her with sedition.  The charge was based on her editorials in the Union Record, especially the "No One Knows Where" editorial.  She signed the receipt for the indictment and went to the district attorney's office to wait while the Boiler-
makers Union rushed to the bank to get her bail.<br>
<br>
The arrest of the Record editors, Labor charged, was primarily a political move.  Ole Hanson was propagandizing against the na-
tional administration, charging it with softness toward anarchists.  "We have had enough of weakness, conciliation, and pandering," Ole thundered.  "We must run the United States of America primarily for the United States of America.  America First!"<br>
<br>
There was a crack-down on the strike leaders.  But politics cuts
both ways.  A local Democrat hurried back to Washington to explain in anguish, "My God, those folks are backed by forty thousand votes, the votes that changed to Roosevelt and then to Wilson.  Do you want to lose them all to the Farmer-Labor Party?" The case against the editors was quietly dropped.<br>
<br>
It had not been a strong case at best.  Of ll the editorials "in-
citing to anarchy" that the Record had printed, Miss Strong's were the best known.  Ole Hanson had quoted her "No One Knows Where" editorial time and again, always implying that the phrase "No One Knows Where" really meant "Straight to Moscow."<br>
<br>
Against the background of a city on strike, with the workers actually feeding and policing the people, Hanson's interpretation had emotional conviction, but in a courtroom the editorial had a different sound.  It advocated nothing.  It was unconsciously or unconscionably clever in the way it avoided threats.<br>
<br>
It said, "This looks too much like the taking of power," but it did not say that the workers would take power or should take power.  It said, "Labor may feel led to manage more activities," but the word was "may" not "would" or "should." The defense could argue that the editorial meant exactly what it said, that it was a frank admission that the leaders of the strike could not read the future.<br>
<br>
Actually the editorial meant more than that.  It had caught the real mood of the general strike, the mood of confident hope, the belief that if only the workers were united, if only they could close down the town, everything would work out for the best.  It was this confident hope that led them to confuse the means with the end, the strike with the goal to be achieved.  They were sure that if all the unions went on simultaneous strike, a better world would be born.  Miss Strong's editorial was an incantation of affirmation, chanted before the image of the general strike.<br>
<br>
When she returned to her task of writing the story of the strike, Miss Strong and her assistants on the history committee tried to analyze what had gone wrong so that the "workers of the world may learn from our mistakes as well as from our successes." They decided that they should have stated their objectives more clearly, but they still could not agree what their objective should have been.<br>
<br>
Reaction set in.  Labor candidates for the city council lost in the 1919 municipal election.  The Seattle shipyards were the first to be closed in the postwar slow-down; times were hard, and many of the most militant-the single men who had no stake in the com-
munity-roamed away to greener pastures.  Those who remained kept looking back to the strike and blaming one another for what had
gone wrong.<br>
<br>
In 1920 Labor nominated a candidate for mayor-Jimmy Duncan, president of the Central Labor Council, a tough, irascible radical who several times cast the lone dissenting vote against Sam Gompers at national AFL elections.  Duncan's candidacy was a defense of the general strike.  He was defeated by a Republican lawyer, Hugh M. Caldwell, 50,875 to 33,777.<br>
<br>
The militant left was discouraged; the conservatives sighed with rehef.  "Seattle is safe against the dictatorship of the proletariat," a commentator wrote.  "No man and no group of men can dictate to this town."<br>
<br>
Not long after the election Lincoln Steffens, a leader among the muckraking reporters, came to town on a lecture tour.  After his formal talk Miss Strong took him to Blanc's-a basement cafe popular with Seattle radicals and bohemians-for dinner and "the real story."<br>
<br>
At first she asked him questions about Russia, for he was just back from Moscow, but Steffens was one of the world's great reporters and soon he was asking the questions.  He wanted to know about Seattle and the general strike.<br>
<br>
"All the old comradeship is torn to pieces," she told him.  "All the old friends are calling each other traitors."<br>
<br>
"When did it start?" asked Steffens.<br>
<br>
"It's been getting worse for months," she said.  "The Central Labor Council meetings that used to have such fine speeches from workers all over the world have turned into nasty wrangles between carpenters and plumbers for control of little jobs.  I think it began when the shipyards closed and the metal trades workers began to leave.<br>
<br>
"These workers' enterprises we were so proud of began to go to pieces.  And everybody who took part in them got blamed.  Now some of the members of our staff are attacking Harry Ault, our editor, most horribly.  One of them told me that if I didn't join the attack they would rub my name in the dirt.  That from a man I used to like."<br>
<br>
She went on with the tale of bitterness that grows from defeat.  Steffens told her that she would have to choose sides; she would have to go with one group or the other, with those who felt the fault lay with not going far enough or with those who felt the fault lay with having gone too fast.<br>
<br>
"I can understand both sides somewhat," she protested.  "I <B>must</B> help them get together.  They were such good comrades before, and we all went ahead so rapidly.  They must be good comrades again."
"Never," the bearded reporter exclaimed.  "Never.  The gulf will grow wider.  It is growing all over the world." He talked of what it had been like in Moscow where, it seemed, the issues,were clearer.<br>
<br>
"Oh, I'd give anything if I could go there," she said.<br>
<br>
"Why don't you then?" said Steffens.<br>
<br>
She did.  Twenty-nine years later, when the friends in Moscow turned against her and expelled her as a turncoat and a spy, she returned to Seattle.  Her home town had changed.  It was a middle class town now, a town of high wages and white collars, a pros-
perous town dominated by a fat, bland, tough labor leader named Dave Beck, who as a young truck driver had learned better than anyone else the lesson of the general strike.<br>

LONGSHORMEN'S 1886 STRIKE.<br>
<br>
Ronald E. Magden and A. D. Martinson, "The Longshoreman's strike of 1886," <B>The Working Waterfront.</B> Tacoma: ILWU Local 23, 1982. p. v-vi.<br>
<br>
It was a clear March day in 1886 and Mt.  Rainier, glistening white with winter snow, loomed high over the small port of Thcoma.  Rolling hills, thick-grown with tall Douglas fir, surrounded the port.  The future of the trees was foretold in sawmill smoke and lumber stacks on flat wharves dotting the shoreline of Commence-
ment Bay.<br>
<br>
Tall masted sailing ships and steamschooners rocked softly against the wharves.  White-plumed locomotives chugged busily along tracks skirting planked pilings.  Horse-drawn carts meandered slowly along dirt roads leading south to New Town and north to Old Town, where the sawmills were located.<br>
<br>
The Old Town docks were strangely quiet that Thursday, March 25, 1886.  On a normal day, men would have been at work counting boards and stacking the exact number of each size in separate piles.  These, stacks would then be dragged by horses to skids set at the stern of the ships.  Other longshoremen would have been hauling lumber up skids to the ship hatches.<br>
<br>
There the men would have been carrying each board piece-by-piece to the forward hold and stacking the lumber into tiers.  But the docks were deserted the longshoremen were on strike!<br>
<br>
When work stopped at the Tacoma Mill Company wharf on March 22, 1886, the first indication of trouble reached City Hall in a message from the dock employers to Mayor R. Jacob Weisbach. The owners reported,<br>
<br>
"A mob in charge of our wharf will not allow our men to work.  Can you give us protection? "<br>
<br>
Weisbach sent a message to the Old Town deputy marshal asking for a report.  The marshal reported that an Indian had tried to continue working at the standard 30cts an hour rate, but was stopped by the strikers.  All is quiet now, concluded the deputy's report.<br>
<br>
Realizing the strikers'determination, the stevedoring firm dispatched the steamer Biz to Seattle to hire strikebreakers.  Strikers responded by sending telegrams to every port on Puget Sound telling other longshoremen to stay away from  Tacoma.<br>
<br>
On Thursday, March 25, the Tacoma Daily Ledger reported:<br>
<br>
... Messrs.  C  Renck  J  Mtson  and  M.   Doulton,   the   committee representing the strikers said, in an interview with a Ledger reporter, that the first of the trouble commenced last week when Captain Libby, Senior, spoke to one of the men working on the wharf, who was smoking, and told him if he did not take his pipe out of his mouth that he must put on his coat and leave off work.<br>
<br>
The employee at once complied and ceased work.  Subsequently        the longshoremen held a meeting and decided to strike for an        increase of 10cts an hour<br>
<br>
In answer to a question the committee said that, although the present rate of w@ is $18 a wek the average pay of the men all the year round is $9, the time for which they are employed not aver@ng three days a week.  The number of men who actually struck on Monday morning was forn and some fifty others who were waiting for employment immediately joined and declined to work unless at the advance rate .<br>
<br>
The striking longshoremen held out for five days.  No strike-
breakers appeared, and no one tried to work.  No foreign ships loaded lumber or sailed from the Tacoma Mill Company wharf.  The strikers held mass meetings and swore that they would form their own stevedoring company to handle the contract currently held by DeLion and Company of Port lbwnsend.  Sensing the urgency of the situation, J. B. Libby, the local DeLion representative, called in Captain R. W DeLion to negotiate with the strikers.<br>
<br>
At the same time DeLion was meeting with disgruntled workers, strikers were joining the new Stevedores, Longshoremen and Rig-
gers' Union of Puget Sound as quickly as they could get membership cards.<br>
<br>
Thus, DeLion had little choice but to grant wage increases if he wanted his lumber put on the ships.  At noon, March 26, 1886, the men went back to work, richer by ten cents an hour, and members of their own union.  It was an auspicious beginning to the long and eventful history of workers on Tacoma's waterfront.<br>

LONGSHORMEN'S 1916 STRIKE.<br>
<br>
Ronald E. Magden and A. D. Martinson, "The Longshoreman's strike of 1916," <B>The Working Waterfront.</B> Tacoma: ILWU Local 23, 1982. p. 32-36.<br>
<br>
Ronad E .Magden and A. D. Martinson, "The Longshoreman's strike of 1916," <B>The Working Waterfront.</B> Tacoma: ILWU Local 23, 1892. p. 32-
36.<br>
<br>
When the ILA District 38 Convention met in Seattle on May 1, 1916, delegates expressed unanimous dissatisfaction with the status of negotiations with employers on the closed shop, coastwide standard wages and practices, and the Vancouver lockout.  Delegates pointed out that shipping and stevedore company profits were escalating because of the European war and the opening of the Panama Canal to commercial traffic during August 1915.<br>
<br>
The men did not understand why they, too, should not participate in the good economic times.  A majority of the delegates voted to strike on June 1, giving the employers only a 30-day notice, though most of the negotiated contracts called for a 60-day notice.  Paddy Morris described the situation:<br>
<br>
We pleaded with them (the delegates), but it was of no avail. Then, when we found that they were bound to call the strike for the first ofjune, violating the agreement, I said to them: 'If you are determined to do that, don't give the employers any notice; if you are going to break it, break it right and strike from the floor of this convention.<br>
<br>
The convention did not heed Paddy Morris' advice.  Delegates voted to strike on June 1, 1916, if the employers did not accept a coastwide closed shop and increase wages to 55cts an hour and  $1 an hour for overtime for general cargo, 60cts and $1 for lumber handlers, and 40cts and 60cts for warehousemen, all based on a ninehour working day An effort was made to enlist the support of the Sailors' Union of the Pacific, but the sailors turned the longshoremen down flat.<br>
<br>
Thus, after years of fruitless negotiations with employers, 43 West Coast ILA locals were determined to hang the hook and strike together.  Unlike regional strikes in previous eras, this time 12,500 longshoremen prepared to strike from Bellingham to San Diego.  Included were 1, 100 in Tacoma, 2,000 in Seattle, 2,000 in Portland, 4,600 in San Francisco and 1,200 in San Pedro.  Also joining with the large ILA locals were smaller unions such as Bellingham, Grays Harbor, Willapa Bay, Astoria, Coos Bay, Eureka, and San Diego.<br>
<br>

As expected, most employers refused the Pacific Coast long-
shoremen's demands.  Therefore, the strike started at 6 a.m. on June 1, 1916, at aR West Coast ports.  U.S. Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson appealed to the men to return to work and allow the Department of Labor to mediate.  Wilson also urged employers to refrain from using strikebreakers pending the outcome of a mediation conference.<br>
<br>
On June 7, meetings began at San Francisco between the ILA District Executive Board and the Executive Committee of the Waterfront Employers' Union, with Federal Mediator Henry White also participating.  After intensive negotiations, a truce was agreed to at 2 a.m. June 9, whereby longshoremen agreed to resume work immediately at the scale of wages and improved working conditions submitted by the ILA to employers on May 1, 1916.<br>
<br>
The strikers returned to work on June 9 at San Francisco and other ports on the West Coast.  The strike seemed to be settled in favor of the ILA longshoremen.  Then on June 16, 1916, an Oakland ILA longshoreman, Lewis A. Morey was shot and killed by a scab lumber handler, and two aays later Thomas Olsen, another ILA man, was shot in the back and died immediately.<br>
<br>
On June 20 the ILA Executive Board called upon the employers to live up to the terms of the agreement by discharging and dispersing all strikebreakers in their employ by June 21, 1916, at 5 p. m., or the strike would resume.  The employers disputed that the June 9 agreement called for the discharge of so-called strike breakers and listed incidents they believed violated the truce.<br>
<br>
True to their word, the San Francisco Riggers and Stevedores Union struck again on June 2 1, and the next morning the remaining ILA locals on the West Coast also walked out.  Picket lines were posted by the unions, and the employers responded by hiring scabs to replace ILA men.<br>
<br>
Sporadic violence erupted in San Francisco, Seattle, and Tacoma as imported scabs began to work vessels. Within   a   month,   though,   West   Coast   trade   was   in   shambles.<br>
<br>
Loaded ships, as many as  fifty  in  the  Puget  Sound  area,  were  still  at anchor in the bays, and on the docks goods were piled helter-skelter.  The Mediation and Conciliation Service of the Department of Labor tried to get the two sides together again, but without success.<br>
<br>
By June 26, 1916, there were nine ships waiting to be unloaded in Commencement Bay and tons of cargo 6n the docks ready to be stowed aboard the ships.  The Tacoma Employers' Association decided it was time to call on the community for support.  Their spokesman
announced to the Tacoma Daily Ledger:<br>
<br>
     We hereby call upon all of the business men and others inter-
ested in the enterprise of this community to join us in a solemn pledge that from this day on the open shop shall prevail in this community even if it be necessary to close all of our manufacturing industries, our lumber mills, flouring mills and shipping interests.<br>
<br>
For more than a month past we have offered to accede to             almost every demand made by the longshoremen who have tied up      and are destroying the industry of this country in open             violation of their agreement.  They not only refuse to carry      out their agreement, but they persist in blocking the               industries of this country and are demanding wages and              conditions that such industries cannot pay and live."<br>
<br>
Violence on the Tacoma Waterfront<br>
<br>
The following day June 27, about 250 Thcoma strikers stormed the Sperry dock where the Grace liner Santa Cruz was scheduled to be loaded by strikebreakers.  The strikers, scabs, and armed guards exchanged about 50 gunshots with each other.  Johnny Now, a twenty-four year old member of Tacoma Local 38-3, was seriously wounded in the melee.<br>
<br>
He later recalled the incident, I was fighting with two strikebreakers when I saw this fellow with a gun aimed at me. He looked at me for several moments and then pulled the trigger I never saw him again.<br>
<br>
The fight on the Santa Cruz was over before regular police arrived.  Three armed guards were arrested for carrying concealed weapons, and police also disarmed both strikers and scabs.  After conferring with the Tacoma ILA Strike Com@ttee, Governor Ernest Lister refused to call out the state militia, declaring that the local police were adequate to maintain order.<br>
<br>
Though the union disclaimed responsibility for the Santa Cruz incident, Sperry Mills and the Grace Line were granted injunctions prohibiting picketing around their piers.<br>
<br>
Despite the injunction, beatings of Tacoma longshoremen and strikebreakers continued as the two sides fought each other on the docks.  On July 12 James Costello, a member of the strike commit-
tee, was knifed when he tried to persuade two men not to scab at the Northern Pacific and Milwaukee railroad docks.<br>
<br>
The railroad companies immediately obtained court injunctions restraining the union from picketing or interfering with their
employees.  The Milwaukee then imported 100 blacks from the East and the South to work cargo on and off ships.<br>
<br>
On July 15 strikers gathered at Eleventh and Pacific, where Alexander Laidlaw, a striker, was mortally wounded by a Milwaukee guard who fired into the crowd of longshoremen.  Grand jurors later decided Laidlaw was killed by a stray bullet fired in self-defense.  Thousands marched in Laidlaw's funeral procession, and several unions declared a half-day of mourning for the slain longshoreman.<br>
<br>
Two days after the Milwaukee dock killing, another striker, Sam James, was severely wounded and a strikebreaker, Rangval Lienann, was killed when strikers attacked scabs going to the Milwaukee piers.  Commissioner of Public Safety Francis Pettit and Sheriff Robert Longmire notified the union that no further picketing would be permitted and no crowds allowed to congregate on the docks.<br>
<br>
Govnor Teats presided at a mass meeting of 1,500 strike sympathizers at Wright Park the next day.  Teats described the situation as greed versus humanity .<br>
<br>
At the same time violence erupted on the Tacoma waterfront, federal mediators brought together waterfront employers and rep-
resentatives of the San Francisco Riggers and Stevedores Union.  On July 13, 1916, the Bay City local accepted the owners' proposal.  The ILA District Negotiating Committee agreed to submit the latest employer offer to all ILA locals for a membership vote.<br>
<br>
The new management proposal did not include a coastwide closed shop nor standard wages and working conditions.  Moreover, employers stipulated in their offer that wages and working conditions in effect on May 31, 1916, must prevail while a joint employer-longshoremen committee worked out a new agreement.  Though San Francisco, Portland, Astoria, Eureka, and San Diego voted in favor of management's latest offer, there was not a single vote of acceptance cast in Seattle or Tacoma.<br>
<br>
Altogether 1604 Seattleites and 759 Tacomans unanimously rejected the employers' proposal.  On July 19, 1916, San Francisco longshoremen returned to work, while both Seattle and Tacoma reiterated their decision to reject the compromise and continue the strike.  The decision of the San Franciscans angered the Puget Sound longshoremen, who claimed they had been sold out.<br>
<br>
Tom Green, retired Rothschild foreman, recalled his father's account of the strike:<br>
<br>
     We got sold out by San Francisco in that 1 916 strike.  See, they were out on strike for about three or three-and-a-half
months and then they put together some kind ofagreement and they voted on it, but they voted it down for some reason-I can't tell you-so they went back out on strike again and they were out for another month-and-a-half or so. Then, lo and behold, what did their brothers down in San Francisco do but agree to go back to work.  We were left holding the sack here.<br>
<br>
At this point in the strike, wages and working conditions were not the crucial issue.  It was the closed shop which Puget Sound employers were determined to avoid, and which the men were firmly intent upon achieving.  With 600 scabs working on the Thcoma docks, 0. C. Nelson, manager of the Employers' Association announced on July 22, The employers are entirely satisfied with the results they are now obtaining and in no event will ever concede the closed shop.  Nelson added, If the longshoremen who went out wish to return to work they will do so under the old scale.  There will be no medi-
ation, no settlement and no recognition of the union.<br>
<br>
The strike resumed and feelings once again reached the boiling point.  The lumber companies seized the initiative and declared their docks open shop.  The lumber owners then formed Puget Sound Stevedoring, which began hiring non-union workers.  The other stevedoring contractors, including International Stevedoring, the successor of McCabe and Hamilton, also agreed not to use union men.  Only Rothschild chose not to join the open-shop companies.<br>
<br>
Rothschild's refusal stiffed the wrath of other stevedoring companies and mill owners, but Rothschild held to its position of hiring union men throughout the remainder of the strike.  Whatever Rothschild's reasons for continuing as a union shop, its action saved the lumber handlers of Old Town from total destruction as a union.  Rothschild formally agreed to the union's demand of a closed shop during July 1916, and the lumber handlers returned to work Rothschild's ships.<br>
<br>
In New Town, however, International Stevedoring was successful in busting the union.  Strikebreakers and new men appeared on the docks to replace union workers, and the union could do nothing about the situation.  For an practical purposes the strike was over and the employers had won a major victory.<br>
<br>
Emergence of "Fink Halls"<br>
<br>
The 1916 strike was a crushing defeat for longshoremen.  Working together, stevedoring firms and sawmill owners busted the union from Seattle to San Diego.  All ILA locals, except for Old Town, lost control of jobs on the docks.  In every port the employers gloated over their victory and then mounted a well-organized campaign to drive what was left of the unions into total oblivion.<br>
<br>
The bosses almost succeeded.  West Coast steamship companies, general cargo stevedores, and sawmill owners adopted and rigorously
maintained a non-union hiring pohcy The general cargo industry established employer-owned and managed hiring halls, which came to be known as fink halls.<br>
<br>
Officially known as the Waterfront Employers' Hiring Hall, the Tacoma fink hall was housed in a building near the corner of Eleventh Street and "A." Except for Rothschild, WEU included afl companies involved in the shipping industry and their strength was based not only on the number of members, but also on their ability to maintain a united front toward waterfront workers.<br>
<br>
One of the first actions of WEU after the strike was to hire Harvey Wells, a man experienced in breaking strikes by lumber workers, to administer the fink hall.  A derby hat and a sawed-off shotgun were Wells' badges of office.<br>
<br>
Since Wells did not know who were ILA men and who were not, a dispatch card with a special code punched into the card was given each man seeking work.  The card listed the man's name and address, and in numbered squares around the edges of the card punches indicated:,(l) Whether the longshoreman was a member of the union; (2) If he had participated in the 1916 strike; or (3) Whether he had been a strikebreaker.  When a man came into the hiring hall looking for work or reported to a foreman on a dock, he was required to show this card.<br>
<br>
The rustling card became a bitter reminder to longshoremen of their defeat.<br>
<br>
The employers' policy forbade hiring more than 50% union men at one time.  The WEU denied that this was discrimination.  Tom Green remembered his father's story of the 1916 Tacoma fink hall well:<br>
<br>
The strikebreakers lined up on one side of the hall ... union men lined up on the other side and they took two for one, two strikebreakers'gangs, one union gang.  But these men, they were great union men and they very soon convinced the employer that the strikebreaker was the wrong kind of labor Theyjust went out and busted their tails and outworked them.  They kind of fiddled<br>
along and fiddled along and these strikebreakers kept leaving, going elsewhere.<br>
<br>
There was an awful lot of pressure comes on a strikebreaker once a strike is over One that stays, nobody ever forgets him, he@ not adopted into the clan.  So ultimately they got to the point that [it] got to be a two for one advantage-two union for one scab going.<br>
<br>
Many longshoremen simply left the docks after 1916.  Some, like Johnny Now and Paddy Morris, were blacklisted by the employers.  Now
assumed a new name and went to work on the Seattle docks where he hoped to work without being recognized by the WEU Morris went to work in the shipyards.  The majority of the union longshoremen who left the Tacoma docks followed Morris to the shipyards or joined the US.  Army.<br>

LONGSHOREMAN'S STRIKE OF 1934.<br>
<br>
Ronald E. Magden and A.D. Martinson, "The Great Maritime Strike of 1934." <B>The Working Waterfront.</B> Tacoma: ILWU Local 23, 1982. Chapter Six pages 105-108.<br>
<br>
President Franklin D. Roosevelt believed our nation had a ren-
dezvous with destiny, that is, the American people would survive the Great Depression and achieve unparalleled economic and social well-being.  In some ways American labor gained a measure of FDR's dream during the 1930's.  After a century of unending struggles for the right of their unions to exist, the New Deal assisted American workers at a time when the national labor movement was declining precipitantly in membership.<br>
<br>
During June 1933, Congress enacted the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) to combat the economic depression by shortening hours of labor, increasing wages, and eliminating unfair trade practices.  The Act also created the National Recovery Administration (NRA) to work with industry and labor to increase employment.  Section 7-A of NIRA provided workers the choice of their own representatives to bargain collectively with employers.<br>
<br>
On the Pacific Coast, where company unions had dominated industrial relations since the early 1920's, the effect of the federal legislation was to open a new era in employer-employee relations.'<br>
A notable exception to the Pacific Coast labor situation was Tacoma, where ILA Locals 38-3 and 38-30 were the only major closed shop longshore unions on the West Coast.<br>
<br>
These locals were respected by both the ILA international office and other Pacific Coast longshoremen for their efficiency and strong leadership.  During 1934 Paddy Morris was Pacific Coast ILA Organizer, and Jack Bjorklund was District Secretary.  Morris and Bjorklund had spent years trying to organize the West Coast, but until 1929 their organizing drive stumbled along with little progress.<br>
<br>
Then worker militancy asserted itself.  ILA locals were chartered in Everett and Grays Harbor in 1929.  Portland was next in 1931 and Seattle in 1932.  When San Francisco, key to the coast, was organized during the fall of 1933, longshoremen were ready to move.  By March 1934, forty-four ILA locals held charters in the Pacific Coast District, and longshoremen were once again solidly unionized from San Diego, California, to Juneau, Alaska.<br>
<br>
As the Pacific Coast ILA reconstituted itself, district members
became involved in developing another important provision of NIRA, Section 7-B.  This clause asked industries to voluntarily prepare codes of operation which would stimulate economic recovery and at the same time recognize the needs of working people.  From<br>
July 2 trough 5, 1933, a special session of the Pacific Coast District ILA met in Seattle to review a tentative code prepared by Tacoma.<br>
<br>
The 56 delegates added or eliminated as they saw fit the various clauses or conditions affecting practically every line of work on the waterfront.  The delegates then sent the tentative code with their revisions to the various locals for their acceptance, modification or rejection.  The code referendum was overwhelmingly approved by the members .<br>
<br>
Pacific Coast District ILA officers, including jack Bjorklund and Paddy Morris, went to Washington, D.C. with the membership's recommendations for inclusion in the Section B shipping code.  When they arrived in the nation's capital city the ILA men discovered that maritime employers already had prepared their version of the code and refused to meet with longshore representatives concerning a joint proposal.  Attempts by the NRA bureaucracy to bring the shipping companies to the conference table to discuss the shipping code with the union men were futile.<br>
<br>
The shock of the employers' attitude at the code hearings added to the fighting mood of ILA delegates to the Pacific Coast District Convention when they met in San Francisco from February 25 to March 6, 1934.  The convention immediately named a negotiating committee to meet with the employers' team, led by Thomas G. Plant, chairman of the San Francisco Water Front Employers.<br>
<br>
Chairman Plant kept delaying the meeting with the longshoremen until Paddy Morris, Acting Chairman of the Convention, became so upset with the oillying and dallying that he stepped down from the podium to advise the delegates:<br>
<br>
I want to say that this convention should do this: they should instruct that [negotiating committee] to thresh out the full question at issue with them [the employers]definitely antipositively on Monday antigive them an ultimatum that unless they agree to meet with us as a district, that there will be no more meetings with them as local employers.  And if they refuse to do that on Monday, you can then decide Goddamned quick whatyou want to do.  And then you can go back to your Local with something material and substantial.  Ifyou don't do that, you won't have any Locals, I am afiaid . 3<br>
<br>
This convention listened to Paddy Morris.  The delegates instructed the convention negotiating committee to demand: Recognize the ILA District as the official collective bargaining agent or the convention will take a strike vote.  When Jack Bjorklund,
negotiating team chairman, reported back to the convention that the employers were willing to talk about wages and working conditions, but not on the closed shop situation, the following resolution was proposed:<br>
<br>
Whereas, We have given March 7th as a dead line for our employers to comply with our demands, and whereas<br>
We have instructed our committee that in the event our employers do not comply with our demands on said date, that within ten days they shall proceed to take a strike vote, and whereas<br>
President Ryan has requested us to take no drastic action until the 22nd of March on which date we have been informed the Code will be signed, and whereas<br>
He further requests us to forward our strike vote to him to use same in our behalf<br>
Therefore, be it Resolved, that we instruct our Committee that in the event our employers do not comply with our demand by March 7, that they immediately take a strike vote of all Pacific Coast Locals, and<br>
Be it further Resolved, that said strike vote be forwarded to our International President, to use in our behalf, and<br>
Be it further Resolved, that we inform the International President that if our demands are not met by our employers on March 22ndastrikewillbecalledinallPacificCoastportsat6a.m.on March 23rd.'<br>
<br>
The resolution passed by a resounding voice vote of AYE and the convention adjourned.  Up and down the West Coast, a referendum vote by the rank and file to strike carried by a huge majority, with only Anacortes voting against striking.  As March 23 approached and there was no progress in negotiations, President Franklin D. Roosevelt requested the ILA Pacific Coast District Executive Board to delay the start of the strike.<br>
<br>
Roosevelt promised to appoint a fact-finding commission to investigate the controversy and recommend a solution.  The ILA Board complied with the President's request and waited.  But the President's mediation panel could not find a workable compromise, and on May 9, 1934, 12,500 West Coast longshoremen went on strike.  Moreover, this time longshoremen were supported by the seamen, engineers, masters, mates and pilots and other marine unions.<br>
<br>
The maritime workers tied up their vessels when they reached port and struck as soon as meetings were convened to approve the strike.  As coequal, but separate strikers, the seagoing men demanded higher wages, three instead of two watches, and employer recognition of their respective unions.  Thus, the first industry-wide strike in shipping history began.<br>
<br>
It was to be a memorable strike that eventually involved nearly 35,000 workers and lasted 83 days.<br>

Immediately union spokesmen went to the press to explain their position to the general public.  In Tacoma a committee was formed to carry out that task for the duration of the strike.  Named the Tacoma Longshore Press Committee, it was led by Robert Hardin, Paddy Morris, Ernest Tanner and Tiny Thronson.  Hoping to gain public support for their cause, this union committee sent the following letter to local newspapers and radio stations:<br>
<br>
All we're asking for is a fair shake and if we get that we will be satisfied.  We also wish to impress on the minds of the public that we don't like strikes, but we are forced to fight for what we believe are ourjust dues.  We were informed there was to be a code under the National Recovery Act for the shipping industry and that our work would be covered ... The promised code was not forthcoming and there is still none today.  A code, however, was given the shipowners and that gave them the edge over us right off the bat.<br>
<br>
Then it was proposed by Dr B(oris) Stearns of the US. Department of Labor that the government supervise and operate the hiring of all longshoremen, and the elimination of our local booking offlces in all ports. 7hat was turned down at a convention of Northwest longshoremen held at Portland last winter In December, however, we were given 10 cents an hour raise in basic pay, making 85 cents.  We were receiving 90 cents prior to 1931.<br>
<br>
Then we were again assured that in the near future the promised code would be signed and the employers would be forced to meet us.  On February 25, we held a convention in San Francisco and elected a committee of seven to meet San Francisco employers and shipowners. 7hey refused to recognize our committee as representing the ILA.<br>
<br>
It was then that we, through our international president, issued the ultimatum setting March 23 as the time of the strike ... There was ... a telegram from President Roosevelt, who proposed he would find an impartial board.  We complied with the President@ request and the board was appointed and met with our executive board.  The shipowners refused to take part in the conference at first, but were later persuaded by the President@ board.  They refused point blank to give us any consideration in regard to hours and wages, thus breaking the agreement they made with our organization and the Presidents board.<br>
<br>
We feel that Tacoma Waterfront Employers will agree to our claim that through our work Tacoma has had far more efficiency and far fewer accidents in the loading of ships than at any other<br>
<br>
port on the Coast.<br>
<br>
Tacoma LL.A. Statement Issued Thursday, Noon May 9,1934<br>
<br>
Similar statements to newspapers and radio stations were made in all ports as the strike began.  Recognition that public opinion was
important indicated a growing sophistication by longshoremen in their struggles to beat the employers.  No longer did longshoremen simply believe their cause was just and that the public would somehow understand their point of view.<br>
<br>
The men now understood that it was necessary to explain repeatedly to the people the circumstances causing the strike and what the goals of the workers were.  The general tenor of all longshore publicity during the twelve-week strike stressed that the stoppage was a struggle by workers to achieve job security through the closed shop and union hiring  halls.<br>
<br>
The West Coast maritime strike became front-page news nationally, and most editors and publishers sided with employers.  Their editorials and feature articles repeated management's position that the strike was a Communist plot and longshoremen were being duped by radicals.  The subject of Communist control of the ILA was brought up by the employers as early as the meeting between the convention negotiating committee and the waterfront owners before the strike.  ILA District Secretary Bjorklund told the<br>
bosses then,<br>
<br>
... at Tacoma, these men in question [Communists] were hired by the employers and when trouble broke out they tried to lay the responsibility on us ... It was specifically stated in our Consti-
tution that any man who belonged to a dual organization should be expelled from our organization.  So they didn't get away with that.  I finally told them that I had been jumped on from hell and back again by the employers and the communists, and that, personally, I was fed up on it.'<br>
<br>
The greatest national attention was directed toward the strike in San Francisco.  The Bay City was not only the headquarters of the largest ILA local, but also of other maritime unions and most of the shipowners.  All maritime crafts became deeply involved in strike activities.  There were daily parades on the Embarcadero to draw attention to the cause, and more importantly the joint Marine Strike Committee maintained a full complement of pickets at all San Francisco docks to keep out strikebreakers.  Fully aware of the importance of San Francisco as the major testing ground, the ship-
ping industry braced itself for another fight to the finish.<br>
<br>
The Tacoma Longshoremen's "Flying Squad"<br>
<br>
In the Pacific Northwest, strike activity took place mainly in Seattle, Portland and Everett, where police, armed guards, scabs and longshoremen fought sporadically on the docks and in nearby streets.  Tacoma escaped most of the violence because Commencement Bay employers made few efforts to import scabs and force the docks open.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the reason for the reluctance of the employers to break the
picket lines was the formation of a special unit of Tacoma longshoremen called the Flying Squad.  When the 1934 strike was only three days old, the Flying Squad participated in scab-clearing on the Seattle docks.<br>
<br>
Altogether 600 Tacoma and 200 Everett longshoremen stormed the Seattle waterfront from Nelson Dock to the Bell Street Terminal driving scabs away from employer piers.  Led by Henry Brown, Victor Olson, Fred Sellers and George Soule, the Tacoma Flying Squad spent much time in Seattle and other Washington State ports strengthening the ranks of their coworkers whenever employers threatened to open a port with scabs.<br>
<br>
Although organized as an official union activity, even the Tacoma Strike Committee did not always know what the Squad was doing.  Secrecy was considered essential to success, and staying out of jail.<br>
<br>
Evidently, much planning had taken place by Tacoma longshoremen before the strike began.  On March 30, 1934, Tacoma Locals 38-30 and 38-3 amalgamated into ILA Local 38-97, thereby ending the long-standing rivalry between lumber handlers and general cargo longshoremen.  The merger of the two Tacoma locals clearly meant a united front toward employers.  Moreover, the everbusy Paddy Morris was the Tacoma Central Labor Council President in 1934, and on the day the strike began the council passed a motion that if troops are used to break the Longshoremens strike, the Council will call a general strike.<br>
<br>
Washington State Governor Clarence Martin reacted to the Tacoma Central Labor Council announcement by calling a conference on May 16, 1934, which included the shipping employers, the ILA, the Council, State Federation of Labor, and the Teamsters.  The meeting turned out to be a failure because employers urged the Governor to use the National Guard to open Washington ports.<br>
<br>
The union representatives told Martin to keep his hands off or there would be a general strike from Bellingham to Portland, Oregon.  After the meeting, Martin announced that he hoped the men would go back to work under a truce, pending the outcome of federal mediation efforts in San Francisco.  Puget Sound longshoremen refused to consider his suggestion of a truce and continued to picket the docks.'<br>
<br>
In the midst of the first hectic month, ILA President Joseph P. Ryan invited himself to the West Coast to settle the strike.  On May 28, 1934, Ryan, en route to San Francisco, stopped in Tacoma and Seattle where he complimented the men for their magnificent fight.   Pressured by the federal government mediation service, employers negotiated with Ryan and ILA Pacific Coast District representatives.<br>

A proposed agreement on May 28, 1934, recognized the ILA, but failed to provide for a coastwide agreement, or the union hiring hall.  The longshoremen rejected the proposal decisively when it was sent to the locals for ratification.  In fact, the Ryan proposal outraged the Tacoma local.  A spokesman for 38-97 told the Tacoma Daily Ledger:<br>
<br>
We are right back where we started from.  Hours, wages and working conditions we have stated our willingness to arbitrate, but the hiring hall is the vital issue. 7here can be no compromise with dishonor ...<br>
<br>
When 95 percent of the longshoremen on the Pacific Coast voted to go on strike, the issue of hiring halls and methods of dispatching the men was the paramount question. 7he proposition submitted back to us by the employers is not an offer It is an insult to the intelligence of the members.<br>
<br>
There can be but one answer and that is absolutely no.'<br>
<br>
Undaunted, Ryan entered negotiations again with the employers on June 16, but this time with the assistance of Dave Beck, president of the Seattle Teamsters, and Mike Casey, Beck's counterpart in San Francisco.  Both Beck and Casey thought the maritime strike had lasted too long and the strikers should take what they could get from the employers.<br>
<br>
Ryan emerged from his meeting with the employers with another settlement very similar to his May 28 agreement, but with a Beck and Casey guarantee binding Teamster unions to cross picket lines if any longshoremen failed to return to work under the provisions of the new settlement.'<br>
<br>
Ryan then called upon the San Francisco local to ratify the agreement, but the Golden Gate City strikers turned him down.  He immediately flew to Portland, Oregon, and met with the longshore-<br>
men there.  The men listened quietly and then shouted down his proposal.  Ryan traveled to Tacoma, where he met with the joint Northwest Strike Committee.  The ILA President plead@d with the committee to ratify his second settlement.<br>
<br>
The strike committee listened politely, but like San Francisco and Portland strikers, the Northwesterners voted Ryan down without a single vote in favor.  Walter Freer, chairman of the joint Northwest Strike Committee and also President of the Tacoma ILA local, reported to the press, No body of men can be expected to agree to self-destruction.<br>
<br>
When the Teamsters failed to carry out their threat to cross longshore picket lines, and President Ryan declared he was taking a back seat in any further negotiations, the initiative passed to the Pacific Coast District ILA negotiating team of Cliff Thurston
from Portland, Paddy Morris and jack Bjorklund of Tacoma, and William J Lewis of San Francisco.  At the same time a membership referendum instructed the new team to add to the original demands of ILA recognition, closed shops and union hiring halls, a new proviso that employers must also reach satisfactory settlement with other maritime unions.  The employers emphatically rejected the latest ILA Pacific Coast District proposal.<br>
<br>
Historically, longshore and maritime strikers were organized in coastwide unions that determined basic strike policy and repre-
sented their members in dealing with the government and employers.  However, it was understood that the membership of each union had the final say on proposals to and from the employers.  In the day-today contest with the employers over all aspects of the 1934 strike, the striking maritime workers were united in joint strike committees in each port.  The joint Northwest Strike Committee was composed of representatives of the striking unions in Puget Sound, other Washington ports and Portland.<br>
<br>
As the strike continued, Seattle employers and newspapers agitated the public about the plight of starving Alaskans.  The joint Northwest Strike Committee decided to release vessels to alleviate the distress.  The ILA signed the Alaska Agreement with shipowners on June 8, providing for the closed shop, union hiring hall, the six-hour day and retroactive wages to be arbitrated.  The employers also agreed to demands from the seagoing unions, and the vessels were loaded and sent to Alaska from Seattle.<br>
<br>
Coinciding with the second round of negotiations between Ryan and the shipowners, the Mayor of Seattle, Charles L. Smith, and a newly formed Tacoma Citizen's Emergency Committee announced on June 15, 1934, a coordinated effort to open their ports by force, if necessary.  Mayor Smith proclaimed an emergency and took over personal control of the police force.  Then Smith announced he would guarantee police protection to anyone loading or discharging cargo in the Queen City<br>
<br>
In Tacoma, the Chairman of the Citizen's Emergency Committee, John Prins, told the Daily Ledger on the same day, June 15, that we are prepared to open the port and afford our languishing industrial and business life some relief Three days later, on June 18, the Citizen's Emergency Committee followed up their first statement with an open letter to waterfront workers:<br>
<br>
A MESSAGE TO THE 5000 WORKERS IN TACOMA WHO HAVE BEEN THROWN OUT OF WORK BY THE LONGSHOREMEN'S STRIKE THE PORT OF TACOMA WILL OPEN<br>
<br>
This is a definite promise by the Tacoma Citizens Emergency
Committee.  You, who are eager to work, and have had the oppor-
tunity to work until interrupted by this strike, will have the opportunity again-the Port of Tacoma WILL OPEN.<br>
<br>
Business was beginning to pick up in Tacoma.  Mills and factories were re-opening.  Thousands had been called back to their jobs.  Then this strike.  Factories, unable to receive raw materials and unable to deliver finished products, were compelled to close down.<br>
<br>
600 TACOMA LONGSHOREMEN HAVE NO RIGHT NOR WILL THEY BE PERMITTED TO DICTATE THE FUTURE TO 106, 000 PEOPLE"<br>
<br>
While the Citizen's Emergency Committee was securing Tacoma City Council approval for assigning additional police officers to patrol the docks, Mayor Smith tried to reopen a Seattle pier on June 2 1. The result was a pitched battle at Smith Cove between strikers, scabs, police and armed guards.  The police used tear gas and night sticks, and kept Smith Cove open.<br>
<br>
The joint Northwest Strike Committee retaliated by suspending their special agreement exempting Alaska shipowners from the closure of the port.  As a spokesman for the Strike Committee related to the 
press, the <B>Alaska </B>deal was based on an agreement that the Mayor and the city would assume a neutral attitude.  Alaska Governor John W Troy quickly wired the joint Northwest Strike Committee to please cooperate, but the committee referred the Governor's request to the Seattle Mayor and the employers."<br>
<br>
On June 22, the Tacoma Citizen's Emergency Committee decided to reopen the Port of Tacoma.  A Tacoma policeman, who was sympathetic toward the strikers, alerted longshoremen that a Greyhound bus filled with scabs was coming from Seattle to Tacoma around 5 a.m. At that early hour the bus pulled up in front of the ILA hall at 14th and Pacific and the strikebreakers transferred to waiting trucks.  Longshoremen at the hall did not challenge the scabs.<br>
<br>
But down at the Milwaukee dock the Flying Squad and 400 Tacoma strikers were waiting for the strikebreakers.  Retired longshoreman Victor Olson remembers that the Flying Squad nailed shut the dock gates so that scabs could not pass through to the piers.  Olson also recalled that there was a parley beside the trucks between Tacoma longshoremen, the Seattle scabs, and the local police.  The law officers disarmed the scabs of their pistols, blackjacks, tear gas cannisters and baseball bats.<br>
<br>
The strikebreakers then climbed aboard the trucks and went back to Seattle.  Many years later Olson declared, I'd do it again.  I believe in the right to fight for my job.<br>
<br>
As strike activity eased in Tacoma, the situation became more tense in Seattle.  General strike talk similar to 1919 surfaced as
Seattle strikers, aided by Tacoma's Flying Squad, continued to battle police and strikebreakers on the Queen City's waterfront.<br>
<br>
The Seattle longshoremen sent a request to the Seattle Central Labor Council asking for a work stoppage by all union labor in the city.  Tacoma, Longview, and Portland Central Labor Councils already had expressed their willingness to call a sympathy strike if National Guard troops were sent to the docks.  However, in the Seattle Central Labor Council, the Teamsters successfully blocked a vote by the delegates to support longshoremen and marine workers, and general strike discussions died out.<br>
<br>
While turmoil continued on the Seattle docks, the Tacoma Citizen's Emergency Committee tried to open the Port of Tacoma again.  Chairman John Prins negotiated on June 25 a special agreement with port authorities to supply a berth for scab ships.  But Prins' understanding with the Port Commissioners was short-lived when, quite mysteriously, the Port reneged on its promise.  At the same time union pickets disappeared from the Port of Tacoma piers.<br>
<br>
This action followed a closed-door meeting between the Port COmMiS-
sioners and the joint Northwest Strike Committee.  Though cha-
grined, the Citizen's Emergency Committee claimed credit for the Port-longshore truce once it became public knowledge.  Despite renewed attempts by Prins to reopen the port, there was no movement of ships into or out of the harbor.<br>
<br>
On the same day the Emergency Committee's agreement with the Port of Tacoma failed, federal mediator Charles A. Reynolds told longshoremen and Alaska employers that a new agreement covering supplies for the Northern Territory must be reached soon or government troops would load chartered ships.  Other public officials, as well as the newspapers, decried the longshore embargo of food and medicine for the Alaskans, and by July 3, public opin-
ion was turning against the strikers.<br>
<br>
On July 5, 1934, the joint Northwest Strike Committee agreed to load Alaskan ships in Tacoma under the terms of the first Alaska agreement.  It was also understood that no effort would be made by employers to open Commencement Bay by force.<br>
<br>
Concerned that its business would be lost to government-chartered ships, the Alaska Steamship Company acceded to the joint Northwest Strike Committee's demands.  The Tacoma Port Commission then authorized use of its docks.  On July 6 the first four Alaska steamers arrived at the Tacoma piers with union crews.<br>
<br>
As a result of the joint Northwest Strike Committee's victory over Alaska shipowners, longshoremen from Pacific Northwest ports traveled to Tacoma, where they were dispatched from the union hall
to work the ships.  Half of the wages was paid directly to the men, one-fourth was sent to their local strike committee, and another fourth went to the joint Northwest Strike Committee.  The committee sent $2,000 to the San Pedro strikers, $300 to San Francisco, and various amounts to other California locals.<br>
<br>
The joint Northwest Strike Committee also set aside  $1,500 to organize a coastwide maritime federation that would make permanent the solidarity of the longshoremen with the seagoing unions.  Throughout the long strike, discussions took place between the ILA and the Masters, Mates and Pilots; Marine Engineerly, Sailors; Cooks and Stewards; Marine Firemen, and Radio Telegraphers about establishing a united organization for greater strength.  By the end of the strike there was universal support for the idea of a federation among all maritime unions.<br>
<B><br>

The End of the 1934 Strike</B><br>
<br>
The lifting of the Alaska shipping embargo ended the Tacoma Citizen's Emergency Committee's campaign to force ihe Port of Tacoma open.  The committee announced that the Seattle Waterfront Employers' Union would protect Tacoma's interest in the dispute with the longshoremen and the maritime workers.  In turn, the WEU sent a representative to participate in hearings with the newly constituted National Longshoremen's Board (NLB) in San Francisco.<br>
<br>
Labor legislation passed by Congress during June 1934 empowered the President to establish boards of investigation and arbitration in labor disputes.  The NLB was the first created by Roosevelt under the new federal law.  On June 26, President Roosevelt appointed<br>
Archbishop Edward Hanna of San Francisco, Assistant Secretary of Labor Edward F McGrady, and San Francisco attorney Oscar K. Cushing to the NLB to bring the contesting sides together and settle the strike.<br>
<br>
But by this time the positions of both the employers and the strikers had hardened to granite.  At the NLB hearings longshoremen insisted on the union hiring hall, increased wages and better working conditions, as well as recognition of the marine unions.  As expected, the employers adamantly rejected the longshore and marine unions' demands.<br>
<br>
With the failure of the first effort by the NLB, the San Francisco employer group now determined to open the Embarcadero even if it took every available police officer in San Francisco.  On July 3 employers' trucks rolled out of Pier 38 behind eight police patrol cars.  Police Captain Thomas M. Hoertkorn, waving a revolver at pickets, yelled, The port is open!<br>

The strikers surged forward and threw bricks, cobblestones and railroad spikes at the trucks.  The police answered with night sticks, tear gas and bullets.  The pickets retreated and merged with the crowd.  July 4 was quiet, but on July 5, known as Bloody Thursday, one striker and a sympathizer were killed downtown and a mammoth confrontation took place on Rincon Hill.  Here the strikers fought with bricks and stones, and the police hurled tear gas and used night sticks on strikers.  Finally the battle was over and the police had won."<br>
<br>
Within hours of the Rincon Hill battle, national guardsmen took positions along the San Francisco waterfront.  The Golden Gate City was particularly tense on July 9 as thousands of longshoremen, other union men and women, and their sympathizers walked silently down Market Street in the funeral procession for the two men who had been killed.  The long, solemn march awed many who saw it.  The employer history of the strike credits this funeral procession with turning the tide of public opinion in favor of the strikers.<br>
<br>
In response to affirmative votes by affiliated unions, the San Francisco Labor Council declared a general strike on July 15, 1934.  It was a peaceful and effective strike that lasted three days.  Though most of the California newspapers editorialized that the general strike was led by Communists, the general populace<br>
remained sympathetic to the strikers.<br>
<br>
On the second day of the general strike, the San Francisco Labor Council debated a resolution calling for arbitration of all out-
standing issues between longshoremen and marine workers on the one side and employers on the other.  Harry Bridges, Chairman of the San Francisco joint Marine Strike Committee, asked that the hiring hall issue not be included in the arbitration package.  However, the Council voted 207 to 180 in favor of arbitrating all issues.  On the next day, July 18, the National Longshoremen's Board reacted to the labor council's resolution by offering its services as arbitrator.<br>
<br>
The labor council then went a step further and declared on July 19 that the general strike would end, upon acceptance by the shipowners and employers of the striking maritime workers, of the terms<br>
of the President of the Longshoremens Board."<br>
<br>
On July 20 the leaders of the waterfront employers and newspaper publishers held a private meeting in a San Francisco suburb.  After the meeting, newspapers carried featured stories announcing that the employers would accept arbitration if the ILA also submitted all differences to the NLB.<br>
<br>
Shipowners also agreed to elections on all vessels and to accept union recognition if a majority of the seamen voted for the union. 
Thus, on Saturday evening, July 21, every ILA local on the Pacific Coast voted on whether to submit their differences with the employers to the NLB.  The rank and file voted in favor of arbitration 6504 to 1525 and went back to work the next week.<br>
<br>
During October 1934, the National Longshoremen's Board announced its decision in the form of an Award.  The NLB sought to effect a compromise on the most important issue, the hiring hall.<br>
<br>
The hiring of all longshoremen shall be through halls maintained and e dispatcher shall be operated jointly, declared the Board, but<br>
selected by the International Longshoremens Association.  While on the surface this section of the Award appeared to be a compromise, in reality longshoremen had won a major victory.  The dispatcher was the key to hiring, as owners and the ILA had learned from the 1917 NAC ruling.  The government then had taken over the hiring halls and appointed union men as dispatchers with the end result that unions controlled who was sent to work on the docks."<br>
<br>
The NLB also created a joint Labor Relations Committee of three employers and the same number of longshoremen to operate each hall.  This committee was also required to maintain a list of registered longshoremen who would receive preferential employment over casuals.  Grievances by either workers or employers were also resolved by the Labor Relations Committee.  Additional ILA gains included wage increases to 95cts an hour straight time and $1.40 for overtime, a shorter week of thirty hours, and a sixhour day.<br>
<br>
The longshoremen's allies in the 1934 strike also made significant gains.  The marine union elections resulted in recognition and collective bargaining rights for the unions on most coastwise and offshore shipping lines.  However, the unions were defeated in elections held on the tanker fleet.  The men working for the oil companies voted to stay members of company unions.<br>
<br>
Overall, the 1934 strike was a major victory for the marine and longshore unions.  Not only had they won most of their demands, but the men had also gained a sense of power and solidarity during the strike that carried their unions to further victories in future negotiations.<br>
<br>
Employers did not come away from the NLB Award emptyhanded.<br>
<br>
Shipowners and dock managers gained the power to introduce labor saving devices and to institute such methods of discharging and loading cargo as they considered best for the conduct of their businesses.  This was the first major Pacific Coast settlement that included a provision concerning mechanization.  It was to be an increasingly important issue between longshoremen and owners as new machines began to replace men on the docks and in the ships' holds.",
As far as Tacoma was concerned, Local 38-97 was exempted from the joint hiring hall provision mandated by the NLB Award.  The Tacomans kept their hall under full union control with their own dispatcher, thereby maintaining a pace-setting standard for the rest of the ILA.<br>
<br>
The 1934 victory over the employers marked the apex of Tacoma influence in the affairs of Pacific Coast longshoremen.  The work of jack Bjorklund and Paddy Morris in organizing and consolidating the ILA membership into a bastion of labor strength unknown in previous eras had taken fifteen years.  But signs of change within the ILA were on the horizon.  Ambitious men like Harry Bridges were emerging on the waterfront.<br>
<br>
Supported by the large San Francisco local and Communists, Bridges soon sought to wrest control of the ILA Pacific Coast District from the established leadership.  It was to be a power struggle with immense consequences, especially for the Tacoma local.<br>

1934 Longshore Strike<br>
<br>
Jerry Lembcke, and William M. Tattam, "The 1934 Longshore Strike," <B>One Union in Wood, a political history of the International Woodworkers of America.</B> New York: Harcourt, 1984 p. 28-30.<br>
<br>
Until 1934, a longshoreman's job security was tied to the paternalism of the work-crew foreman; whisky, money and other assorted favors guaranteed jobs.  Men milled about outside company offices at early morning shape-ups until a signal from the boss indicated that they had been selected for the day's stevedoring.<br>
<br>
Then, in May, 1934, the jurisdiction of the company unions which were maintained by the West Coast shippers was challenged by the International Longshoremen's Association, An.  The Waterfront Employers'Association of San Francisco refused the iLA's demands for union recognition, a dollar an hour wage, a thirty-hour week and a unioncontrolled hiring hall.<br>
<br>
Led by Harry Bridges in San Francisco, longshoremen retaliated by shutting down the waterfronts from San Diego to Seattle and pressing for a coast-wide working agreement.<br>
<br>

From May 9 to July 31, 1934, docks along the Pacific Northwest were controlled by the striking longshoremen.  Normal shipments of lumber and agricultural products were curtailed, and sawmills were forced to close when lumber could no tonger be shipped by water.  By June, with no end in sight, 17,000 lumber workers were laid off and payrolls were slashed almost in half.<br>
<br>
However, members of the National Lumber Workers Union solicited funds for the longshoremen and spoke in favor of the strike; as a result, lumber and sawmill workers supported the strike and did not scab despite their own desperate straits.  Even the big mills at Longview, Washington ground to a halt when for four days, beginning June 19, 1934, sawmill workers there went out on strike in sympathy with the longshoremen .<br>
<br>
On July 3, San Francisco businessmen announced that their trucks and drivers would move through the picket lines to the piers along the Embarcadero and remove the goods stranded there since the strike began.  Longshoremen attacked the trucks with bricks, and police retaliated with clubs, tear gas and gunfire.<br>
<br>
Two days later, on Bloody Thursday, the Battle of Rincon Hill left two longshoremen shot to death by the police, thirty wounded and forty-three more either clubbed, gassed or stoned.  Four days later, 15,000 longshoremen and sympathizers marched up Market Street behind a flat-bed truck carrying the coffins of the slain longshoremenUnion sympathies were now cemented, and on July 16 a three-day general strike began in San Francisco .<br>
<br>
Anti-radical hysteria engendered by the general strike spread quickly.  West Coast police departments sided unequivocally with the shippers and invested themselves with the kind of patriotic fervor reminiscent of the Palmer Raids of the early 1920s.  On the first day of the San Francisco general strike, Portland police searched freight trains arriving from the south in an attempt to head off a feared invasion by "flying squadrons" of communist agitators; 130 men, mostly hoboes and migrant workers, were taken into custody.<br>
<br>
Two reputed labor agitators, who supposedly planned to "radicalize" the local longshore strike by promoting a general strike, were also found on the train.<br>
<br>
When local shipping companies demanded protection in order to continue loading ships along Portland's strike-bound waterfront, Oregon Governor Julius Meier ordered 1,000 National Guardsmen to mobilize immediately.  Fortunately, the troops remained camped on the outskirts of the city after the Central Labor Council threatened to call an immediate general strike if the Guardsmen moved to the waterfront .<br>

Between July 16 and 21, 1934, even though the San Francisco general strike had ended and the ILA had agreed to arbitration, the Portland police continued their searches and seizures.  Private residences, Communist Party headquarters, and the Marine Workers Industrial Union hall were raided.  Union records and Communist literature were seized and taken to the police station.<br>
<br>
Three men were arrested for advocating criminal syndication, and thirty-two others were taken in for violations of the Oregon Criminal Syndication Act of 1919. All of those arrested were closely associated with the Communist Party and had worked with the Unemployed Councils to keep the unemployed from crossing the longshoremen's picket lines .<br>
<br>
Dirk DeJonge, once the Communist Party's candidate for Mayor of Portland, was tried and sentenced on November 21, 1934 to seven years in prison.  The charges brought against him included advocating violence during the longshore strike, being in possession of Communist Party literature, and conducting and attending Communist Party meetings.<br>
<br>
After the Oregon Supreme Court upheld the conviction and Dirk DeJonge had spent nine months in the Oregon State penitentiary, the United States Supreme Court, on January 4, 1937, unanimously decided that the lower courts had erred in convicting him.  The Court held "that the Oregon state law as applied to the particular charge as defined by the state court is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment".<br>
<br>
The results of the 1934 longshore strike did not pass unnoticed by loggers and sawmill workers.  The joint control of hiring halls with employers, the thirty-hour work week, wage increases and exclusive bargaining rights won by the longshoremen constituted notable union victories.<br>
<br>
More importantly, however, the organization of the longshoremen meant that woodworkers had a strong ally for their own union activities.  The two groups of workers were closely linked through family and occupational associations, while the Communist Party tied together the activists in both unions.  If the woodworkers struck, it seemed a virtual certainty that the longshoremen would support them.<br>

LONGSHOREMANS STRIKE OF 1934.<br>
<br>
Gordon Newell, "The Longshoreman's Strike of 1934," <B>H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest.</B> Seattle: Superior
Publishing Company, 1966, p. 428.<br>
<br>
In June [1934] Mayor John Dore, an avowed friend of labor, retired as mayor of Seattle, and was replaced by Charles L. Smith a more conservative type.  Perhaps recalling the nationwid; publicity which had accrued to Mayor Ole Hanson when he claimed to have broken the Seattle general strike of 1919, Mayor Smith prepared a compromise agreement which he submitted to the unions on a "take it or leave it" basis.<br>
<br>
When the strikers decided to leave it he issued a proclamation that, as of June 21, Seattle was an open port, a move which had been successfully made at Los Angeles, with the result that former Puget Sound, Columbia River and San Francisco cargo was moving from that port, as well as from those of British Columbia.<br>
<br>
The Seattle police chief soon afterward tendered his resignation and Mayor Smith took personal charge of the police.  On June 21 a force of 250 policemen broke the picket line at the Smith Cove piers, mounted patrolmen leading the attack with swinging clubs.  Non-union crews immediately began discharging cargo from the Donaldson Iiine European freighter Modavia and the Everett of the Tacoma Oriental Steamship Co. The unions immediately repicketed the Alaska vessels and the I. L. A. asked other Seattle unions to join a general strike in protest, a plan which was foiled by the refusal of Dave Beck, Northwest head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, to cooperate.<br>
<br>
Pickets displaced from Smith Cove transferred their activities to the employers' non - uwon hiring halls at the Smith Tower and Alaska Building, taking forthright measures to discourage prospective strikebreakers from entering.  Within a week the unions agreed to permit Alaska sailings to be resumed, but only from Tacoma, and only upon the understanding that no effort would be made by governmental officials there to reopen the port to general shipping.<br>
<br>
Violence was fast reaching its peak.  At San Francisco a pitched battle between police, strikers and sympathizers resulted in 34 persons being shot, two fatally, and about 40 others gassed or badly beaten.  Shots were fired by Portland police when 500 strikers attacked a locomotive attempting to move tank cars from the Union and Shell Oil Co. plants.  A number of strikers were beaten by police clubs, a number of policemen seriously injured by rocks and bricks.<br>
<br>
By mid July, vessels were still handling cargo at Smith Cove under heavy police guard, although picketers skirmished continually with guards, sometimes evading them and succeeding in beating up non-union longshoremen, ship's officers, or others observed violating the line.  Steve Watson, one of the ,'special deputies" of the Citizens' Emergency Committee of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, was shot and killed in mob violence at 3rd and Seneca, in the heart of "uptown" Seattle.
At this point the major issue remaining was the question of whether longshore hiring halls should be controlled entirely by the union or operated jointly by labor and manage ment.  President Roosevelt appointed an arbitration board to settle this issue and departed on a three-month vacation.  It was finally agreed that the s@e would be called off, pending arbitration of the remaining issues.  All unions returned to work on August 1 but immediately walked out again on behalf of the maritime unions.<br>
<br>
The truce agreement pro vided that all men employed after May 16 who had not previously followed the sea should be dismissed, but that men on the ships as of May 16 who had previously been employed at sea could be retained.  The marine unions demanded that all personnel who had remained on the ships during the strike should be discharged.<br>
<br>
The unionws,  after the brief walkout agreed that they had misinterpreted the agreement and work was resumed the following morning.<br>
<br>
The position of the longshoremen's unions was strengthened in the 1934 strikes by their recognition, for the first time, as bargaining agents under the National Recovery Act (NRA).  The maritime unions were not particularly effective during the 1934 strike, but as a result of the longshoremen's success (and NRA) they quickly became powerful in their own right.<br>
<br>
The 84 -day period of economic stagnation and violence had ended, but its scars were a long time healing.  The bitter ness of the .1934 strike was repeated during the next few years in a period of labor unrest such as has never been recorded in the history of the Pacific Northwest, before or since.<br>
<br>
Foreign steamship operators were foreed to route their vessels and cargoes via British Columbia ports during the long tie-up of American ports and some of them, having transferred their major Northwest functions north of the border, retained them there.  Indicative of the tremendous advantage enjoyed by Canada during the strike is the lumber shipment barometer.<br>
<br>
A total of only 2,748,920,847 feet was shipped from all Northwest ports.  Washington exports total ed only 1,294,942,925 feet, a figure which Grays Harbor alone had approached during the boom years, and a decline of over a quarter of a billion feet over the depression figures of 1933.<br>
<br>
Oregon shipments dropped to 594,513,208 feet, but British Columbia, a negligible factor in predepression <B>fig</B>ures, showed almost a 30% gain in 1934 over 1933, reaching a total of 859,464,714 feet, approaching the Washington figure and far exceeding that of Oregon.  This was a trend which was to continue to the present time.<br>

THE LUMBER STRIKE OF 1912.<br>
<br>
Vernon H. Jensen, "The IWW Lumber Strike of 1912," <B>Lumber and L</B><B>abor.</B> New York: Farrar and Rinehart, Inc, 1945, p. 121.<br>
<br>
A notable I.W.W. strike occurred at Grays H arbor, Washington, in 
<B>9,2.18 </B>it had its beginning at Hoquiam, on March I4, and spread rapidly to Aberdeen and Raymond, after the operators had rejected a demand for higher wages.<br>
<br>
Ten days later, the Aberdeen Trades Council, affiliated with the A.F- of L., refused to endorse the strike.  On March 27 a "citizens' committee" was established to find a way of settling the strike.  Those who were impatient insisted upon immediate action, and vigilantes were organized "to put down the strike by intimidation and force."<br>
<br>
The I.W.W. headquarters were raided, the leaders were arrested, and as many of the men as could be rounded up were forced to leave Aberdeen, being "escorted" from the city by vigilantes.<br>
<br>

At Hoquiam, at the same time, <B>150 </B>strikers were loaded into boxcars for deportation.  But, with the mayor opposing the act, the railway company refused to move the cars, and the men were released.<br>
<br>
At Raymond 460 deputies were sworn in and about 150  Greek and Finnish workers were shipped out of town.  After this the vigilantes followed a program of systematic deportations throughout the area.<br>
<br>
This, however, did not break the strike.  It continued, with the men demanding increased wages, reinstatement of all men, and a preferential union shop.  The citizens' committee proposed that the with strike be settled on the basis of a minimum wage of $2.25 a day, preference for American labor and exclusion of all I.W.W. members.<br>
<br>
This was accepted by the operators, and, because crews were secured, the strike was lost in spite of the fact that the I.W.W. attempted to have it spread to all lumber workers in western Washington.<br>
<br>
Although mid-April found the I.W.W. still holding officially to its demands, the  strike, was called off on May 7.<br>
<br>

During <B>1912 </B>and 19I3 unionism was at a low ebb in the lumber industry on the West Coast.  In the first year the I.W.W. locals were consolidated into the National Union of Forest and Lumber Workers which was already on the decline. At the national<br>
September, I9I3, only 640 I.W.W. lumber workers were reported as 
members, and during <B>I9I3 </B>and 19I4 the consolidated organization
<br>
went to pieces.  Only a few scattered locals with tiny memberships remained.<br>

THE GREAT LUMBER STRIKE OF 1935.<br>
<br>
Vernon H. Jensen, "The great strike of 1935," <B>Lumber and Labor.</B> New York: Farrar and Rinehart, Ind, 1945, p. 164-185.<br>
<br>
The great strike of 1935 is the outstanding landmark in the history of industrial relations in the lumber industry.  The vigorous, militant tactics of the unionists and the strong counter activities of the employers were characteristic of the industry.  The absence of a unified, effectively directed approach on either side was as much an industry characteristic as it was a consequence of newness in organization.  Divisions and schisms in the ranks of the opposing sides were common.<br>
<br>
The 1935 strike was no less spectacular than that of 1917. When the 1935 strike was over, however, unionism was definitely established in the industry.  The dispute provides an essential key to many of the subsequent developments in industrial relations in lumbering.<br>
<br>
Strike talk was prevalent in the camps and mills in Washington and Oregon early in I935.  Several local job strikes had occurred throughout I934 and some A.F. of L. locals had assisted the long-
shoremen in their famous coastwise strike of that year, creating a close liaison between them.  There were struggles over the right to organize and it was obvious that unions were growing.  But no strong coordinated leadership had developed.<br>
<br>
On March 23, I935, a convention of the Northwest Council of Sawmill and Timber Workers Unions met in Aberdeen.  The Executive Board of the A.F. of L. had just previously given jurisdiction over the workers in the lumber industry to the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and joiners of America.<br>
<br>
Surprisingly, the Sawmill and Timber Workers Union delegates, without any pronounced ob'ection, approved the action and accepted the leadership of A. W. Muir, executive board member of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and joiners of America, who had been sent out to take charge of the lumber industry unions.<br>
<br>
At the same time, Fred Lumm, president of the Vernonia local, was made president of the Northwest Council of Sawmill and Timber Workers Unions, Norman Lange, president of the Tacomd local, was made vice-president, and Edgar Hall, Westport, Oregon, was made secretary.<br>
<br>
Demands were drawn up in the form of a uniform working agreement to be presented to the industry, with May 6 set as the date for a strike unless they were met.  The prepoped working agreement asked that the union be the sole collective bargaining agency in each plant or camp; that the hours of labor be six per day and thirty
per week; that there be overtime and holiday pay provisions; that no strikes or lockouts occur during the life of the agreement until all mediation and conciliation had failed; that a system of modified seniority be established; that vacations with pay according to the length of service be introduced; that a base wage of 75 cents per hour and proportionate increases to higher classifications be set; and that thirty days' written notice of desire to terminate the agreement be given.'<br>
<br>
In mid-April, notice of the long-looked-for strike was made public.  An Associated Press dispatch from Olympia announced that formal demands had been served on six Olympia lumber and plywood com-
panies.  At this time the forthcoming strike also was revealed in Portland by Charles Hope, regional director for the National Labor Relations Board.<br>
<br>
He declared that all attempts to put a damper on the general strike movement had failed.  The 4L complained that "part of the Northwest press unwittingly played into the hands of the lumber unionizers . . . by giving prominence to a threatened strike in logging camps and sawmills." Certainly, the publicity made groups which were hesitant about striking alone anxious to go along with the crowd, and unprecedented requests came from the men in the woods to be enrolled in the unions.<br>
<br>
Workers were organized and ready to move at any time, in the direction of either negotiation or strike.<br>
<br>
At the same time, high 4L officials announced the results of a two weeks' survey, daiming that "go per cent of the men did not want to strike," and emphasized that such a move would produce nothing but hatred and suffering for the employer, employee, and the public.  This was the usual 4L cry, but to the worker only a strike seemed likely to bring results.<br>
<br>
Most operators were not willing to negotiate.  They asserted that they were not able to meet the union demands and would close and stay closed.  Although the employers were worried over the absorption of the Sawmill and Timber Workers Unions by the Carpenters, most of them were for "riding the storm out" by playing a waiting game because of the meager resources of the strikers.  Obviously, this was a better tactic than resistance through use of strikebreakers, which always creates excitement.<br>
<br>
But the assistance-obtained from the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and the support of the Carpenters, Longshoremen, and other labor groups gave the workers unsuspected power to engage in a prolonged struggle.<br>
<br>
In the midst of the strike threats and countercharges that the men
did not want to strike, the Longview local balloted to determine the wishes of the men.  This vote reprmnted one of the largest organized groups.  Longview, moreover, formerly had been an important center of 4L activity.<br>
<br>
The vote was overwhelmingly fot the strike, provided the demands were not met by May 6. The union then submitted its proposed uniform working agreement to the management of both Long-Bell and Weyerhaeuser companies, promising that if actual negonations were started sufficient time would be given to complete them before an actual walkout would be precipitated.  Locals throughout the Douglas fir region placed similar demands in the hands of employers.<br>
<br>
Preparations for negotiations were going on in a businesslike man-
ner in many localities, but some men were restless and unwill" to<br>
wait until May 6. The first actual break came at Vernonia, where there had been a two weeks' stoppage the year before.  The Vernonia 
loggers of the Clark-Wilson Company voted to strike on April <B>ig, 
</B>declaring that fifty union men had been replaced by non-union men.<br>
<br>
Some declared that the early action was designed to prevent the timber already cut in the woods from being moved.  Also playing a part in hastening developments was the existence of an old Wobbly 'tradition of direct, vigorous action among these men.  This was the case elsewhere in the lower Columbia River area, where the men also would not hold back.  A week later a second early walkout occurred at Bellingham when 1,000 men left their jobs because of alleged discharge of union men.<br>
<br>
Things began to move fast as both sides sparred for advantage.  Hopes of inducing the opposing factions to get together dimmed as the West Coast Lumbermen's Association announced that it would resist the ruling of the National Labor Relations Board, in the case involving the Long-Bell and Weyerhaeuser companies at Longview, that the majority labor group, as determined in elections, should represent all the workers for collective bargaining.<br>
<br>
"At no time and under no circumstances will the west coast lumber industry submit to rulings based upon the principle involving denial of representation of any minority groups of employees in collective bargaining." In general, the operators sought to diminish the power that the board might bring to bear in establishing peace.<br>
<br>
A. W. Muir, Carpenter appointed leader and spokesman for the lumber industry workers, attempted to make capital of the attitude expressed by the operators toward the board by saying, "This calls for an amendment and it is this: We'H take any board.  We want to negotiate."<br>

Although Muir was playing for public support, it is also true that he really did desire a speedy settlement.  Muir branded the Vernonia and Bellingham incidents as lockouts on the ground that the companies had brought in non-union men and then discharged union men without cause.<br>
<br>
Muir was using all the strategy at his command.  He knew full well the task of holding in check such a large group of disreen" union men who were, for the most part, undisciplined.  There is reason to believe that he did not want the Strike at all, but the men were determined and he was bound not to turn back without securing material concessions such as wage increases or direct union recognition.<br>
<br>
On April 23, E. S. Marsh, United States labor conciliator, was ordered by H. L. Kerwin, director of the Conciliation Service for the Department of Labor, to survey the situation and endeavor to secure meetings between employer and worker representatives.  Marsh went to work immediately and met important lumber operators and Muir.  The latter was asked to prevent walkouts, such as had occurred at Vernonia and Bellingham, until an attempt was made to reach an agreement.<br>
<br>
The Long-Bell and Weyerhaeuser companies at Longview seemed to offer a key to the whole situation, because they were willing to negotiate and were large enough to wield considerable influence in the industry.  Muir felt that if an agreement could be reached with these two large companies the rest of the industry would probably be forced to follow suit, and, therefore, he worked hard on this possibility.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, other camps and mills were being closed by local action ahead of the date set for the strike.  On May 3 there were out on strike 2,000 mill workers and 1,500 logging camp workers in Washington and 1,775 mill workers and 850 logging camp workers in Oregon."<br>
<br>
On May 6, when the strike got under way in earnest, hopes for peace were not entirely gone.  The large mills at Longview were running, with negotiations in progress.  So, too, were the large McCormick mills at St. Helens, Port Gamble, and Port Ludlow, and the same was true at Aberdeen where a number of mills continued to operate.  By the close of May 6 an estimated io,ooo men were on strike.<br>
<br>
Of 20,000 working, half were on the job only because negotiations were in progress.  Elsewhere pickets took their posts and the strike got under way without disorder.  But negotiations at Aberdeen were broken off, and on May 7 between 4,000 and 5,000 additional workers did not report for work.<br>

This pushed the total out on strike to i5,ooo, slightly less than 50 per cent of the men then employed in the lumber industry in the Douglas fir belt.  Numerous small mills, especially in southern Oregon, were not closed.<br>
<br>
Commissioner Marsh attempted to get the disputing parties to use the conciliation service of the United States Department of Labor, but failed in large part because of employer unwillingness.  The West Coast Lumbermen's Association explained publicly that "the<br>
industry is not organized to deal with its workers as a whole."<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, the West Coast Lumbermen's Association could have performed a valuable service if it had been able, or willing, to act for the industry.  Prolongation of the strike was caused by the fact that the employers were so poorly organized for labor negotiations.  Operators who were amenable to negotiation were afraid to make independent settlements because of fear of being out of line with the ultimate industry settlement.<br>
<br>
The Oregon Emergency Relief Administration announced that workmen on strike would be eligible, on the basis of a federal ruling, to benefits if they were destitute.  A similar rule applied in Washington.  This was bitterly resented by many lumbermen.  C. C. Crow, publisher of Crou,s Pacific Coast Lumber Digest, who represented the most rabid anti-union thought in the industry, declared:<br>
<br>
This makes it clear that Roosevelt intends to finance the A. F. of L. in its fight to force the lumber industry into a closed shop. . . .<br>
Lumber manufacturers are determined that they will not submit to 
this communistic move.... A prominent lumber man is supposed <B>to 
</B>have said, "It is bad enough to have to fight an organization like the A. F. of L. but when you have your own government assisting in putting a strangle hold on you the problem is a serious one."<br>
<br>
Commissioner Marsh succeeded in getting some, but not all, Portland operators to convene in a peace parley on MaY 7. The general feeling manifested was that the great impediment to settlement was the "closed-shop" issue, alongside of which the wage issue paled into insignificance.<br>
<br>
On that question the operators would not give ground.  The next day Seattle felt the strike when ten out of twelve mills went down.  Then the first Willamette Valley mill closed as the strike con-
tinued to spread.  However, the Willamette Vaney was scarcely further touched.<br>
<br>
On May 9 the negotiations at Longview between Muir and the representatives of the managements of the Long-Bell and Weyer-
haeuser companies resulted in an agreement, subject to ratification by the men in secret ballot.  The next day, however, goo employees of the Weyerhaeuser mill at Longview struck before casting their
votes and without authorization of the mill workers' strike committee.<br>
<br>
This action was due partly to restlessness and partly to rumors- But the most important thing in causing the strike was the advance disclosure of the terms of the agreement by loggers who had voted on it the night before." Incidentally, the Communists took credit for the workers' coming out before the sawmill vote was taken- The Communists, after having stirred slightly in the industry for a number of years, were actually caught unprepared for the swift movement of organization which had taken place.<br>
<br>
They had missed an opportunity to influence the convention at Aberdeen at which the Carpenters took control over the lumber industry workers.  Subsequently, at their own conference in Tacoma on April I7, they voted to disband their dual National Lumber Workers Union in favor of "boring from within."<br>
<br>
Belatedly, they were trying to gain control of the workers.  At Portland, the night before the strike broke at Longview, labor leaders had employed strong-arm methods to prevent the convening of 
a <B>Communist </B>meeting, and to keep "radical influences" from affecting the strike.<br>
<br>
The strength of the Communists at this time, however, should not be overemphasized.  The key to the truth in the situation at Longview was a genuine dislike for Muir's leadership, particularly among the rank-and-file loggers who did not relish an outsider directing them.<br>
<br>
When the proposed agreement-intended by Muir as a model for further statement was revealed to the loggers, providing for a base wage Of 50 cents an hour, a forty-hour week, recognition of the union but not the "closed shop," and time and one-half for overtime, it was rejected by a vote of nine to one.<br>
<br>
The loggers, accusing Muir of having sold them out, informed the sawmill workers, who struck and afterward rejected the proposed agreement eight to one.<br>
<br>
The Long-Bell and Weyerhaeuser companies made a second offer for Longview plants and logging camps of an additional 5 cents an hour increase in all brackets, with recognition of the union as the agency for collective bargaitling for its members only.  This offer was voted on by secret ballot with approximately.2,100 men participating.<br>
<br>
It was rejected two to one.  The companies and union representatives conferred again on May I2 in another effort to find ground for settlement, but failed and broke off negotiations. 13 No effort was made by the managements to operate either of the closed plants.<br>


By May <B>i2, </B>it was estimated that go per cent of all operations in the Douglas fir region were at a standstill.  Negotiations still were in progress with the McCormick Lumber Company, which had been working in close harmony with the Long-Bell and Weyerhaeuser companies at Longview.<br>
<br>
These three companies advocated compromising with the union and were able to hold their own in a discussion with the representatives of the balance of the industry at Tacoma on the '4th.<br>
<br>
On the 16th the McCormick Lumber Company and the local unions of St. Helens, Oregon, Port Gamble and Port Ludlow, Washington, with the aid of E. P. Marsh, United States labor conciliator, reached an agreement similar to the one that was rejected at Longview.  The local unions were recognized for collective bargaining.  Complaints were to be adjusted through standing committees elected at each plant.<br>
<br>
The company was allowed preference in hiring unemployed men from other of its own camps and mills, rather than hiring new men.  Seniority rights were recognized, although the company retained the right to hire and discharge after giving an acceptable reason.  The forty-hour week and 50 cents an hour were agreed to.<br>
<br>
In accordance with the union laws, the agreement had to be sub-
mitted to the Northwest Council for ratification.  This was done on the i8th.  Then it was submitted to the workers at the plants and camps for secret ballot.<br>
<br>
On the eigth the employees at Port Ludlow and Port Gamble voted overwhelmingly for the agreement, but at St. Helens mass picketing by outside men closed the Plant before the vote was taken.  The insurgents then endeavored, without success, to persuade the men at Port Ludlow and Port Gamble to repudiate their vote and leave the 
<B>job.</B><br>
<br>
Twice within ten days Muir's leadership had been seriously challenged Because of the compromise in the proposed agreement at Longview, he was placed under fire and a widespread split in the union ranks occurred.  Muir accused Norman Lange president of the<br>
Tacoma local and vice-president of the Northwest council,   with   having caused rejection of the Longview agreement.<br>
<br>
In  his struggle with Muir, Lange was supported by the vote of 1,600 members of his local.  Muit was again challenged by the insurgents when they succeeded in closing the McCormick mill at St. Helens.  A showdown between Muir and the insurgents over control of union policy was imminent with the assembling of the Northwest Council in Longvicw.<br>
<br>
Before this took place, Muir used his "authority" to remove Lange from office in the Council.  This embarrassed the Tacoma local,

which had voted <B>to </B>support Lange.  The local either had to repudiate its president or face expulsion from the Brotherhood.<br>
Whether Muir had authority to remove-Lange from office was bitterly questioned in the Northwest Council convention.<br>
<br>
The factional dispute occupied most of the first two days' meetings.  When Muir appeared at the convention and emphasized the authority of the Brotherhood to expel individuals or locals, and the Brotherhood's power to withhold assistance, the Council acted to replace Lange.<br>
<br>
Along with this, the Council reduced its wage demand from 75 tO 50 cents as the minimum and accepted the eight-hour day and forty-hour week, although it continued to insist on recognition of the union and time and one-half for overtime.  Union recognition, however, did not entail the closed shop.<br>
<br>
The conservative group thus controlled the Council, but because the insurgents dominated in a number of localities, the interunion fight was not so easily settled.  Muir supporters vigorously 
condemned the leaders of the insurgent group and associated them<B>in 
</B>many cases falsely-with Communists.<br>
<br>
While, the union was being torn internally, various groups were endeavoring to break the strike.  A critical situation developed when worried farmers threatened to use vigilante tactics if they were denied ample shipping crates for their ripening berry crop.<br>
<br>
Sheriff J. W. Connell of Washington County, Oregon, and Governor Martin of Oregon to protect individuals who both threatened to take action to protect individuals who  would go to work in the mills.  Actually, the trouble was out difficulty through conferences with farm leaders arranged by Ben Osborne, secretary of the Oregon State Federation of Labor, and the delivery of crates was permitted."'<br>
<br>
Governor Martin of Oregon was again anxious to intervene when the first violence in the strike occurred at Forest Grove on May 23, after the Stimson Mill was reopened in defiance of the strikers.  Pickets had been sent from Portland to reinforce the local union men, and when a state patrolman was treated roughly the pickets<br>
were driven with tear gas from the roadway leading to the mill.<br>
<br>
The pickets were in an ugly mood and a nasty situation was avoided by the timely arrival of C. H. Gram, state labor commissioner.  The latter conferred with Bert Hall, leader of the pickets, and informed him of the impending arrival of troops.  The union men acquiesced when Gram pleaded with them to stay out of the roadway.<br>
<br>
In view of the immediate establishment of order, General G. A. White of the Oregon National Guard, who had been sent to the scene by the governor, advised against the calling of troops."'
Governor Martin of Oregon ordered the State Board of Conciliation to investigate the lumber tie-up.  Both employers and union leaders who were subpoenaed did not want the board to exercise its mediation services.<br>
<br>
The chairman, 0. M. Plummer, and the labor representative of the board, W. E. Kimsey, submitted a majority report to the governor in which they explained their inability to get the parties either to conciliate or to arbitrate the dispute, 'adding that without an extended investigation of the industry it was impossible to pass judgment on the wage question.  In a minority report, C. M. Ryan, employer representative on the board, emphatically declared that the employers were in no position to pay wage advances.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, on May 22 the 4L board of directors, after three days of proposals and counterproposals, decided to increase wages.  Even though employer members of the board were at first reluctant to grant wage increases, the employee representatives made it plain that the only way to defeat the men on strike was through higher pay.",<br>
<br>
The possibility of federal intervention was always present.  The governor of Washington, however, did not want a federal mediation board appointed at this time.  Nor, mot-cover, did Muir, who was confident that within a few days other large operators would follow the precedent of the McCormick Lumber Company and make agreements with the union.  Employers were also almost unanimously opposed to a federal board because they feared its personnel would likely be unsympathetic to the economic problems of the industry and because it might jockey them into arbitration, which they did not want at all.<br>
<br>
The operators seemed convinced that such a board would act in accordance with popular sentiment instead of being "Sternly prac-
tical." These considerations account for the absence of federal intervention in the early period of the strike.<br>
<br>
Many operators were anxious to operate their plants provided adequate police protection could be assured.  Informal conferences had been held by operators and, in, spite of the 4L decision to increase wages, a semiorganized resistance to wage increases or union recognition in "any form" was built up.  The situation was complex enough to support the view that "the greatest menace to safe and quick settlement," as the Everett Neus declared in an editorial, lay in "the activities of intemperate radicals among the mill operators as well as among the timber workers."<br>
<br>
On May 27 the Supreme Court invalidated the NIRA and helped
make a confused situation still more confused.  The action of the court encouraged the operators, while the workers felt weakened.  Partly as a result of the NIRA decision and immediately following it, Muir, on May 28, consulted with state labor officials as to the best means of ending the Longview strike.  It was decided that a ballot was inadvisable because of the lack of either experience or discipline among the strikers and that the situation called for stern action by Muir.<br>
<br>
At a long conference with the Longview operators, at which Marsh, Lumm, and a conference committee composed of twenty-five employees of the two companies were present, the managements of the Long-Bell and Weyerhaeuser companies informed Muir and the group that they still stood behind their wage offer but were convinced that the local union was neither strong nor disciplined enough to warrant immediate contractual relations.<br>
<br>
They let Muir know that they were willing to deal with the union provided the membership could follow the laws and policies of the Brotherhood.  Some of the employee representatives wcre ready to break off negotiations with the companies, but capitulated when Muir faced them with the alternative of being dropped by the Brotherhood if they did not accept the offer.<br>
<br>
The upshot was that on the night of May 28, at a union meeting attended by about a thousand men, a practically unanimous vote favored the agreement which provided a minimum wage of 5o cents per hour, the cighthour day with a forty-hour week, and time and one-half for overtime.  It is significant that a similar offer had been rejected less than two weeks earlier.<br>
<br>
The acceptance of the agreement at Longview did not necessarily presage any movement toward general cessation of the strike, and there was evidence that the industry generally would ignore the Longview settlement.<br>
<br>
Invalidation of the NIRA encouraged most operators to play a waiting game until the union cracked.  This position, however, played into the hands of left-wing leaders at a time when it would have been relatively easy to establish a more or less uniform industry-wide settlement with the more conservative unionist .<br>
<br>
The hand of the militant unionists was strengthened and dissension in the union was increased.  Now that governm . ent support of collective bargaining seemed to have been laid aside, it was easy to convince many of the workers that more militant, direct action was necessary.<br>
<br>
Moreover, the drastic compromise reductions in their original demands, as accepted at Longview, permitted the radicals to charge Muir and his supporters with a sell-out.<br>
<br>

Left-wing influences, became more vocal and assumed a more open<br>
and active role in the strike.  The Communists officially announced their claim to leadership.  This was an exaggeration, but they were actually assuming a far more important role than ever before.  Pre-
casely how strong the Communists were, it is impossible to tell.  In Everett, one of the centers of "radicalism," it was the opinion of the usually well-informed editor of the News that less than two per cent of all the 3,000 strikers were CommunistS.<br>
<br>
Other centers of Communist strength were Olympia and Grays Harbor.  Wherever possible  the Communists did everything they could to discredit the A.F. of L. leadership.  There is reason to conclude that they were more concerned with keeping the dispute alive than in securing a reasonable settlement.<br>
<br>
Muir, also opposed by non-Communists who rejected his setdement, issued peremptory orders to the locals in various areas to re-
organize the strike committees to conform with the Brotherhood policy or to suffer expulsion.  The struggle between the intraunion groups grew more intense each day.  Violence flared up when, on June 3, Lumm and E. S. Hall, officers of the Northwest Council, were beaten by an unknown body of men who threatened the same treatment to Muir and other union officials.<br>
<br>
On June 5 a "rump" convention comprised of representatives of the insurgeat group in the unions at Aberdeen, Hoquiam, Shelton, and Olympia met in Aberdeen for the purpose of wresting control of the strike policy from Muir.  The four hundred delegates present voted to renew the original strike demands and formed the Northwest joint Strike Committee.<br>
<br>
They also adopted a resolution urging the removal of Muir as spokesman and sent it to Bill Hutcheson, president of the Carpenters, and William Green, president of the A.F. of L. Muir lost no time in declaring the meeting unauthorized by the union because it had -been called at the instigation of "Communists and other radical groups."<br>
<br>
An insurgent group at Longview, by massing a huge throng of pickets, succeeded in preventing employees from going to work and reclosed the mills on June 6. The action of the Grays Harbor locals at Aberdeen had been accepted by the Longview insurgents, and they appointed new strike committees to supersede the Muir leadership, deciding at the same time to stand on their original demands.24<br>
<br>
While these events were transpiring, the 4L was trying to gain control of the situation at Everett and Tacoma by advocating a secret ballot to determine the desires of the workers.  The Sawmill and Timber Workers Union refused to participate and at Everett ordere@ the workers to turn in any ballot they might receive to
union headquarters.<br>
<br>
Even the Everett employers were lukewarm, holding that they were waiting to meet with the unionists as soon as the "radicals" were ousted . At Tacoma, where the 4L had earlier been very strong, the local group took the initiative in sending out a letter with a postal card ballot to get an opinion on the question of returning to work on the basis of the 4L wage increase.<br>
<br>

The ballots were sent to <B>1,752</B> workers certified to be on the May 3 employment lists of the nine Tacoma sawmill, plywood, and door plants.  The ballots had been addressed to a special post-office box, the key of which was in the hands of postal authorities undl the committee, composed of Mayor Smitely, the Reverend E. M. Hegge, and the Reverend Sidney James, took the ballots out on June 4 to 
count them.  Of the 1,752 ballots mailed out, 1,068, or <B>61 </B>per cent, were returned.<br>
<br>
Of these, four were rejected and 925, or 87 per cent, favored ending the strike in accordance with the terms specified.  Although widely heralded as a seven-to-one verdict for return to work, this 
actually represented the desires of only <B>52 </B>per cent of those who 
had been employed on MaY 3, a majority Of 98 <B>Out </B>Of 1,752 workers.  Union officials claimed the balloting was not fair-that men who had not been on the payroll for eight years received ballots-whereas the employers insisted that the payroll lists were correct.<br>
<br>
On the basis of this vote, preparations for opening the mills were begun.  Police Commissioner Frank Callender and Sheriff jack Bjork-
lund were asked point-blank if they would give the plants protection.  CaUender told the employer-employee committee that over 4oo men would be required to police the mills, as compared with the I25 suggested.  He frankly admitted that it was beyond the capacity of the public safety department to furnish more than a small fraction of the men needed.<br>
<br>
The appeal was then carried to the sheriff, a former secretary of the Longshoremen's Union, who replied, "I'll give what protection I can, but you start operations and see what happens.  I haven't enough men to meet such demands." E. C. Griggs, II, spokesman for the committee, asked, "Will you or will you not then take the next step and see the governor?" Bjorklund replied, "No, you see him."<br>
<br>
The sheriff was not inclined to promise what he could not give.  Exhorting the operators to recognize the principle of collective bargaining and deal with all the men, he accused them of "going pretty strong ... when you ask me to prostitute my principles." Callender, who had accompanied the committee, explained: "I told these gendemen . . . if they opened the mills other unions would go out.  I am satisfied if the Mills  open  up  under  guard  we  will  have  a  general tie-up.<br>
<br>

In spite of this, the operators went ahead with plans to open the mills.  As both Governor Martin of Washington and Governor Martin of Oregon guaranteed state protection to men who retumed to work, the strike situation became more tense almost everywhere.280n June. io state police ordered pickets to keep clear of the White Star Lumber Company mill at Whites, Washington, and the pickets disbanded.<br>
<br>
On the next day state police removed all but two pickets at the Coates Lumber Company mill in Tillamook, Oregon.  A more spectacular development was the forced eviction of pickets at Bridal Veil and at Forest Grove, Oregon.<br>
<br>
A truck driver of the Bridal Veil Lumber Company was stopped by a group of men, was pummeled, and his truck sent over a fifteenfoot embankment.  As a consequence, Sheriff Pratt ordered all picketing stopped at the mill, claiming that the pickets "broke their word and failed to picket peacefully." The S.T.W.U. challenged the order of the sheriff, being determined to maintain "the legal right to picket," and claimed that the "beat-up gang" was not from the striking sawmill union workers.<br>
<br>
Pickets were arrested as fast as they came onto the line.  By the evening of June I2 the jail was full and 175 men who had assembled from Portland to help picket were either loaded onto buses or marched down the highway to the outskirts of Pordand, where they were told to "keep going" and their arrests were "terminated."<br>
<br>
The union officials made an attempt to obtain an injunction the next day, but Circuit judge Crawford refused to grant the request, although he did call for a hearing.  B. A. Green, attorney for the union, charged that the governor's office might have had an interest in the attack on the driver because of a desire on the part of the state executive to put an end to picketing in the lumber strike.<br>
<br>
The union insisted that the pickets had always conducted themselves in a peaceful manner.  Deputy District Attorney Frank Sever contended, however, that there was no lawful picketing because there was no dispute between the company and its employees.  The unionists accused the state patrolmen of mistreating them and beating some of the pickets.<br>
<br>
To substantiate their charges, the president of the Portland local, W. F. Wedel, offered his back as an exhibit to the court, and Judge Crawford announced, for the benefit of the court reporter who included it in the record, that he could count six red stripes and several dots on the man's back.  Wedel said that the dots were made when deputy sheriffs and state  police  poked  him  in  the  back  with  the  ends  of their sticks.<br>
<br>
The strikers lost their injunction plea because the judge felt that
the sheriff had used reasonable discretion.  The judge explained that labor should not suffer for the action of but "it must suffer for them if its own legitimate activities cannot be carried on without creating a hazard to persons and property generally." He ad happened, said that, although labor was not responsible for what h<br>
it had "furnished the occasion out of which arose the fear of violence and disorder and its unquestioned right to picket lawfully must yield temporarily to the paramount right of community peace."<br>
<br>
The sheriff  then agreed to permit picketing again after one week<br>
While the Bridal Veil pickets were being dispersed, a hundred or more pickets were driven away from the Stimson mill at Forest Grove on June 13 by state police.  The state police were met by a barrage of rocks which injured a small number, and only a few pickets were<br>
arrcsted.<br>
<br>
Violence also occurred at Bellingham, Washington, when a group of strong-arm men from Seattle challenged the picket lines and, after engaging in a fight, were incarcerated in the county jail.  The arrested men included the head of a strikebreaking agency and four associates, who implicated the management of the leading Bellingham lumber company which, while denying responsibility, agreed to proceed with negotiations with the workers.<br>
<br>
On June I4 negotiations were opened with the Bloedell-Donovan Company, the third largest producer in the region, with Pat Keily, of the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries, and Commissioner Marsh acting as intermediaries.  At a mass meeting a proposed agreement, recognizing the local of the S.T.W.U. as the collective bargaining agency, was presented to the employees who voted decisively in favor of it.  Subsequently the mill opened."<br>
<br>
At other places mills were resuming work or preparing to open.  A former 4L plant, along with two other lower Columbia River operations, signed union agreements.  It was becoming evident that the conservative clement among the workers was gaining control at certain places.  Even at Longview there was much dissatisfaction with the failure of the insurgent leaders to open negotiations on the original demands.<br>
<br>
At some places preparations for opening without granting recognition were being made.  On June 18 the Portland sawmill com-
panies advertised that all positions were open to applicants.  But in view of the longshoremen's refusal to handle lumber, the operators were not very optimistic.<br>
<br>
Although the employers claimed that over a thousand men responded and employers were given assurance by the police that no more than eight pickets would be present at any one plant, they did not attempt to operate the mills.  At Tacoma all but three mills were 
opened on June <B>2i </B>as state police and deputy sheriffs gave 
protection.  Seattle mills opened without agreements on June <B>22.-"</B><br>

Mass picketing at Tacoma resulted in the arrival of the National Guard on June 23.  The governor asserted that Mayor Smitely had informed him that local authorities were unable to cope with the situation and that Tacoma and Seattle operators had requested him to send troopS.32 The Tacoma Central Labor Council, denying that Mayor Smitely had appealed to the governor, protested on the ground that the troops caused disorder where none had occurred before.  A delegation of union leaders from Seattle and Tacoma could not per-
suade the governor to withdraw the soldiers.<br>
<br>
On their first day in Tacoma the state troops went into action to move the pickets back.  At seven o'clock in the morning about seventy-five soldiers, carrying rifles with fixed bayonets, were taken by a circuitous route to the east end of the Eleventh Street bridge, the principal point at which pickets had assembled to discourage returning night shift workers.<br>
<br>
A crowd of two or three hundred was there.  Without preliminaries, the soldiers methodically began "walking" the crowd back.  The strikers took their time, but the troops were not in a hurry.  When the crowd had been cleared from the bridge, the men stood in the street and jecred at the soldiers and were answered by the occasional use of gas.  Beyond this no further effort was made to disperse the people.<br>
<br>
At a general union meeting at which every local in the city was represented-it was decided not to call a general strike, but the Longshoremen's Union voted not to work so long as armed troops.remained in the city.  The next day General Pennington arrived with more troops and immediately issued an order prohibiting picketing so long as the National Guard was in charge of the situation.<br>
<br>
No more than three persons were permitted to congregate at any one place.  Soldiers even entered stores and ordered people who were looking out the windows to make their purchases and leave.  There had been no formal declaration of martial law, but citizens were restrained in their liberty of action and there were arrests without charges.  The Tacoma Times editorially declared that those arrested "have been denied counsel, refused bail and prohibited from notifying family or friends of their predicament.... CiVil liberties have been flouted.  Right of trial, of knowledge of accusers, of information about charges has been scorned.  The right of peaceful picketing has been thrust aside." "<br>
<br>
Mayor Smitely, with the City Council concurring offered mediation. The workers accepted, but the operators spurned the offer<br>
officials on the grounds that city officials had previously confessed themselves incapable of offering protection to the men who wished to return to work.<br>
<br>
They declared that any meeting would only complicate the situation and that the matter was already in the best hands-those of
the governor."<br>
<br>
On June 26, Governor Martin stated over the radio that the<br>
troops would not be withdrawn from Tacoma until industrial peace had been established.  "I insist," the governor also declared, "on respect for collective bargaining,, for peaceful picketing, for the right to strike, even for the privilege to quit . . . and I don't admire nor support that employer who would take advantage of the situation to beat to demand respect for down wages . . . but also I shall continue the right to work."<br>
<br>
He then indicated that he was going to give the same protection to other communities, provided a majority of the employers and workers presented sworn petitions showing they had satisfactory wage and hour agreements.<br>
<br>
The Seattle branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, which subsequently investigated, reported that "no justification has existed at any time for the extreme measures taken by the Governor of the State in assigning state patrolmen and national guardsmen to Tacoma ... not a single arrest has been made by either city or county police authorities in connection with the strike activities . . . neither city nor county police authorities requested the use of troops." .<br>
<br>
The attempts to open the sawmills in various Places created a tense situation because only a few of the operators had entered into agree ments.  Violence had occurred where mills had opened without the sanction of unionists, and additional violence seemed certain inasmuch as preparations were being made to open other mills.  The insurgents were still strong, and unionists everywhere were hostile toward the attempt to break the strike and disgruntled over the use of the militia.<br>
<br>
The fact that the longshoremen, who were sympathetic to the in-
surgents, were refusing to work wherever troops were on the ground, which, incidentally, was a threat to Pacific Coast maritime peace, made the situation more critical.  Because of thes conditions, Secretary Labor Frances Perkins, on June 26, at the request of th<br>
Conciliation  Service,  appointed  a  Federal   Mediation   Board  composed of Superior Judge Roscoe R. Smith of Seattle, Judson Shorett, Seattle attorney, and the Reverend Father George F. Thompson, Church of the Madeline, Portland.<br>
<br>
An immediate protest was made by lumber operators on the ground that "there is no occasion for a mediation board-there is nothing to mediate." In a telegram the operators dedared that "the appointment of a mediation board win only prolong the trouble, postponing the return of the men to the mens, because naturally they will hesitate to go back pending the long process of mediation."<br>

F. H. Ransom, president of the Eastern and Westem Lumber Company in Portland, placed the blame for the dispute upon outside interests.  If the lumbermen and their employees, who have always been able to adjust their differences in the past, could be left alone, everyone 
could soon be back to work and happy."<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the struggle between the union factions continued.  Muir was endeavoring to break the hold of the insurgents at various places.  To the men at Longview he sent a sharp letter, announcing that new locals were being set up separately for employees for the Weyerhaeuser and Long-Bell plants and commanding the men to go back 
to work.  On July <B>1 </B>the mills at Longview began operations with only 700 men, and the National Guard was ordered to be in readiness to move in if violence occurred.<br>
<br>
The biggest obstacle to complete settlement here was the intraunion fight.  The Central Labor Council had sided with the anti-Muir faction, and Muir consequently requested the A.F. of L. to revoke its charter.  The situation was so tense that it was practically impossible for the Federal Mediation Board to intervene.  The Central Labor Council, accordingly, sent a telegram to Secretary Perkins asking for the appointment of a special investigator.<br>
<br>
This was not done because it was apparent that the difficulty was intraunion and had to be dealt with by trade union officials and not the government.<br>
<br>
In order to bring recalcitrant bodies into line, C. C. Young, general representative of the A.F. of L., addressed a letter to all Central Labor Councils to the effect that aid given to the Northwest joint Strike Committee was in violation of Article XI of the A.F. of L. constitution; that those bodies giving aid were subject to revocation of their charters; that the Brotherhood of Carpenters had full jurisdiction; and that an attack upon the strike leadership was an attack on the Brotherhood.<br>
<br>
Young then called upon all central bodies who were not conforming "to immediately expel the local unions which have been su pended or expelled from the Brotherhood of Carpenters and repudiate the so-called 'Northwest joint Strike Committee."' William Green<br>
took action to clear the Longview situation by informing Secretary Dyer of the Kelso (Longview) Central Labor Council that the charter of Local 2504, S.T.W.U., the original local, had been officially revoked.<br>
<br>
He also promised Muir that he would take further action if it was necessary-"" This paved the way for a gradual resumption of com-
plete operations, and by the end of July the Weyerhaeuser and Long-
Bell mills in Longview were operating with a force Of 3,700 men.<br>
<br>
The same day that the Longview mills reopened, an attempt to<br>
open the mills at Aberdeen was  frustrated by an enormous  picket 
<br>
line of almost 2,000 men.  A clash with the police occurred when It 
was discovered <B>that </B>a gravel thoroughfare near one of the mills had been strewn with roofing nails.  Under penalty of immediate ejection if they refused, pickets were forced to gather them up.<br>
<br>
But when another handfull was thrown from the crowd, the street was cleared of workers by the use of gas.  The Federal Mediation Board had, in the meantime, established friendly contacts with some Aberdeen operators and was making a little progress.  It was handicapped, however, by the noncooperative attitude of the leading employers.<br>
<br>
There was continued disorder, and on July 7 National Guardsmen were sent to Grays Harbor for strike guard duty.  The governor claimed that the mayors the sheriff of Grays Harbor County of Aberdeen and Hoquiam and had asked for them.  The area was not placed under martial law, but guardsmen were stationed around the mills to permit the return of such men as wished to work.<br>
<br>
Several thousand people-mill workers, wives, children, and sympathizers-marched from Aberdeen to Hoquiam and back to show their unity and to demonstrate against th6 opening of the migs and the presence of the troops.  Aberdeen was the stronghold of the Northwest joint Strike Committee and workers stood out solidly against the 6ack-to-work movement, with the result that the situation remained deadlocked for a time.<br>
<br>
While troops were in Aberdeen, the insurgent storm center tended to veer toward Everett, where extremists on both sides continued to make mediation difficult.  Everett, at this time, was the only place where operations were not resumed.  The intraunion struggle there one mill was intense.  The insurgents were strong.  An attempt to open one mill on July 5 was met with mass picketing which gave rise to the use of gas by state and city police.<br>
<br>
The operators were convinced that "radical" groups controlled the union to the extent that union recog nition in any form was impossible.  They continued to exert pressure on the governor to send troops.  However, the Weyerhaeuser Company) employing nearly half of the total workers in the Everett area, stated<br>
that it would not join in a request for troops or attempt operation 
under military rule<br>
<br>
To get rid of the insurgent leadership, Muir was considering rcvo-
cation of the Everett charter and installation of separate locals at the plants of each of the six companies as the only way to bring about a peaceful settlement.  On July 13 the Everett Sawmill Workers Union repudiated the Northwest Joint Strike Committee in a secret ballot by a vote Of 328 to 272-but there was a normal working force of 2,000-and the Brotherhood of Carpenters issued six plant charters.<br>
<br>
The situation was further complicated when four mills immediately
opened without granting union recognition.  The, insurgents tried to stop the back-to-work movement.  Open-air demonstrations and a march on city hall were started, but the marchers were routed by riot clubs and gas bombs in the hands of state patrolmen.  In the evening an insurgent crowd Of 2,500 people stormed the Labor Temple and prevented the newly formed conservative unions from meeting.<br>
<br>
The situation was acute because the presence and aggressive action of the state patrolmen had changed public opinion to favor the insurgent group.  Considerable responsibility for the turmoil must rest on the employers who refused to give time for the newly organized conservative unions to begin negotiations and insisted on opening under armed protection.<br>
<br>
The situation at Tacoma had continued tense with intermittent acts 
of violence and disorder.  Finally, on July <B>11, </B>the Tacoma city commissioners wired the Federal Mediation Board and the U.S. De-
partment of Conciliation requesting intervention.<br>
<br>
Before anything could be done, an outbreak occurred which was the direct aftermath of the breaking up of an attempted parade of the strikers and strike sympathizers who had been dispersed by guardsmen the night before.  Strikers had been in an ugly mood all day and shortly before four o'clock in the afternoon trouble started.<br>
<br>
A large crowd assembled at the federal building and started marching around and around at the intersection of Eleventh and A streets.  The leader of each squad carried an American flag.<br>
<br>
The people marched only on the crossings, believing that this relieved them of the necessity of having a parade permit.  Although traffic was blocked, the city police made no attempt to disperse them.  The troops made no attempt to interfere but maintaiqed a line of men with fixed bayonets all the way across the bridge.  Around four-thirty, when lumber workers began returning across the bridge from the mills, the marchers began jeering at the workers.<br>
<br>
A few gas bombs were released at intervals, but no determined effort was made to clear the crowd away until about five o'clock when the troopsdecided to clear the square immediately adjacent to the bridge.  A number of heads were cracked as resistance to the guardsmen developed.  One man, who attempted to disarm a guardsman, was carried away in an ambulance.<br>
<br>
The tactics of the guardsmen did not prove successful because the wind was blowing down Eleventh Street toward the bridge and the gas rollcd back toward the troops, only a few of whom were wearing gas masks.  Exploded gas grenades were picked up and hurled or kicked back among the guardsmen.  As the use of gas grenades failed, a military truck was used to expel gas from its exhaust pipe, but the
truck caught fire and burned. When the fighting finally ceased, the crowd disappeared.<br>
<br>
Following this incident, the Federal Mediation Board began to work in Tacoma.  While there were numerous sporadic acts of violence, workers there voted early in August by secret ballot-1,291 to 97-to accept the employers' offer of an agreement which provided for wa ge increases in all classifications, union recognition, and return of all strikers within thirty days.<br>
<br>
During the latter part of July the strike definitely was on the wane at all points, except Aberdeen.  The workers at Olympia voted by ballot to accept an agreement recognizing plant committees, wage increases, and return of all strikers.  At the same time, the Stimson Lumber Company of Seattle resumed operations under union sanction, as did four Portland mills where agreements had been reached.""<br>
<br>
Following the Tacoma settlement, the Federal Mediation Board began work at Aberdeen.  Muir had revoked the Aberdeen charter and created a new local, when he was Relatively free of trouble at other places, but the insurgent influence remained strong.<br>
<br>
The newly chartered union could claim only 400 members, while the union whose charter had been revoked claimed 3,700- Practically all 
<B>tke </B>operators had agreed in writing to recognize the union authorized by Muir, and so the main obstacle to settlement of the strike revolved around the inter-union struggle.<br>
<br>
The Muir group asserted that there would be a swing to the regularly chartered union if the workers who wanted to join it were assured adequate protection.  But this was not wholly true.  The National Guard in Aberdeen was fair, and the situation was handied better there than elsewhere.  The workers were standing behind the original local.<br>
<br>
The deadlock was pried open a little when the old and the new local met in Aberdeen late in July to consider transfer of membership to the latter.  This was arranged, and with less than a third of its<br>
claimed membership voting, the old local decided to accept the jurisdiction of the new local.  The bitter intraunion fight then subsided, and negotiations with the operators were begun.<br>
No sooner had negotiations got under way at Aberdeen than complications developed.<br>
<br>
The Bay City Lumber Company, operating under an agreement with the Muir local, had been picketed by members of the outlaw union, with
the result that the longshoremen refused to load ships tied up at the mill docks.  Following the vote to merge the two locals, both factions agreed to remove the pickets at the Bay City mill and declared an armistice, pending final negotiations.  Longshoremen thus were allowed to load the ship.<br>
<br>

Then on July <B>29 </B>a large crowd, including Communist sympathizers, assembled at the plant entrance.  Following a parley with the mill manager, the sawmill workers withdrew their objections to loading the ship, but the longshoremen officials then took upon themselves the task of dictating to the manager what sawmill workers he should retain and let go. The negotiations at Aberdeen centered on this plant, and the unwarranted interference of the longshoremen promptly upset them.  The Washington state labor officials and the Federal Mediation Board worked hard in the face of serious obstacles to clear this situation.<br>
<br>
Communists, working under cover, contributed to the obstructionist tactics of radical sawmill workers and longshoremen.  The employers were unwilling to meet the wage situation constructively.  Moreover, the operators wanted assurance that there would be no further interruption from the longshoremen before'they agreed to reopen.<br>
<br>
Finally, on August 14 a settlement was reached.  The new local was recognized for collective bargaining purposes, but the operators reserved the right to negotiate with any individual, committee, or committees of our employees for collective bargaining purposes for the employees whom they represent."<br>
<br>
Any change in base pay or hours, however, was to apply to all employees.  The eight-hour day and forty-hour week with a base rate of 50 cents per hour were accepted.  The original demands drawn up in Aberdeen were cut down to the Longview agreement negotiated by Muir, over which the strike mainly had been prolonged.  The terms were accepted out of necessity.<br>
<br>
While the strike was over, peace had not been achieved.  During the ensuing months, minor skirmishes with employers broke out sporad-
icaHy.  Within the unions dissension and unrest still continued.  The memory of internal union conflict which marked the strike could not be easily crased.<br>
<br>

For a number of seasons the strike of <B>1935 </B>has unusual significance<br>
in the history of labor in the lumber industry.  The rapid, genuine response to the call to organize and the almost complete support of the strike were surprising.  The workers gained unionization, although unity was damaged and they failed to get a standard agreement.  For the latter the operators were largely responsible. 
<br>
If the majority of the employers in the industry had had the foresight to go along with the carly Longview settlement, standardization might almost have been achieved at a stroke, and the painful weeks of continuation of the strike could have been avoided.<br>
<br>
By holding out against any settlement with the union the employers opened the way for left-wing elements to enter the industry labor scene.  The militant opposition of most employers and the resort to state police and the militia, in some cases, in opening the mills was also shortsighted and contributed greatly to ill will in the industry.<br>
<br>
The intense dislike of outside leadership among the workers contributed to insurgency, but the problem of tions were established.  The course of events, and the bitterness which leadership could have been solved peaceably in time, once stable reladeveloped, seriously jeopardized worker unity for many years, and gave an unhappy direction to labor-employer relations in the industry.<br>

<br>
In July, 1933, at Enumclaw, Washington, the AF of L's Northwest Council of Sawmill and Timber Workers was established with headquarters for the Puget Sound District Council in Seattle, the Grays-Willapa Harbor District Council headquartered in Aberdeen, and the Columbia River District Council centered in Portland.<br>
<br>
These three bodies formed the basis for the union's organizing efforts amidst the lumber workers. This union was the early beneficiary of Section 7a of Franklin Roosevelt's National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), which guaranteed workers the right to bargain collectively with their employers through representatives (unions) of their choice.<br>
<br>
The NIRA also provided guidance and regulation for the industry itself, which had been plagued for years by operators who had been
overly zealous in liquidating their assets - the trees - even though felling too much timber frequently led directly to falling prices.<br>
<br>
As a remedy, the New Deal set up the National Recovery Administration (NRA) Lumber Code which set wage rates that varied from twenty-three cents per hour in the southern states to forty-three and one-half cents an hour for northwest lumber workers.  With minor exceptions, eighteen was the minimum legal age set for employment, and forty hours was set as the standard work 
<B>week.</B><br>
<br>
In application, the NRA Lumber Code was a dismal failure.  The lumber business was highly competitive, with thousands of camps and mills tucked away up river valleys beyond the reach of the NRA.<br>
<br>
The product prices, production requirements, and labor provisions of the Code were either not enforced or disregarded by operators.  Numerous violations were allowed to go unchallenged by the NRA.50 Even before the Supreme Court declared the NIRA unconstitutional in the Schechter Case (April 1935), the lumber industry had all but abandoned the Code, thereby becoming the nation's first major industry to junk Roosevelt's federal regulations.<br>
<br>
But although the Code collapsed, the NmA's brief existence nevertheless served to clarify the positions of the unions on the left and the right of the political spectrum.  Lumber workers were dissuaded from supporting the Communist Party's National Lumber Workers Union by the apparent respectability" of the An's Sawmill and Timber Workers Union.<br>
<br>
The Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen (4-L), that faithful relic of the Wobblybusting days of World War 1, was recognized as the labor administrator of the Lumber Code by the employer's Western Pine Association and the West Coast's Lumbermen's Association, even though it represented less than ten percent of the Northwest's lumber workers.  The 4-L changed its name to the Employees Industrial Union in an attempt to legitimize itself under the NMA, but by the early 1940s it had passed from the scene.<br>
<br>
While employers did not take Section 7a of the NIRA seriously, ten thousand Northwest lumber workers showed that they did by demanding admittance to the Sawmill and Timber Workers Union.<br>
<br>
The AFL Executive Board was caught by surprise. Since its 1934 convention, the AFL'S United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners (UBCj), Which claimed jurisdiction over lumber workers, had deliberately ignored them, because they did not want to admit unskilled workmen into the ranks of skilled craftsmen.  But in the 1930s " ... their din became too deafening to ignore,"14 so the
UBCJ established a so-called federal union to receive the lumber workers.<br>
<br>
Under this arrangement, the lumber workers' federal union was to be absorbed as soon as collective bargaining was established.  In the meantime, the AFL executive council retained the right to set policy and decide the ultimate fate of the hastily created union.  By this strategy of chartering federal unions and tying them to the UBCJ, the AFL avoided any permanent solutions to the problem of 
mass industrial unionization.<br>
<br>
At their March 1935 convention in Aberdeen, Washington, the Sawmill and Timber Workers Union was officially placed under the jurisdiction of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners.  By then, the Northwest's mills and logging camps were seething with discontent.<br>
<br>
During 1933 and 1934 lumber workers in that area had failed to receive any substantial wage or hour benefits by joining the union, and no major strikes had been called in the industry.  Meanwhile, continued wage reductions and disillusionment with the benefits of the NIRA Lumber Code were stimulating strike demands.<br>
<br>
A.W. "Abe" Muir, an executive board member of the United Brother-
hood of Carpenters and Joiners, was sent west to assume control of the Sawmill and Timber Workers Union.  Muir, who knew next to nothing about the rough-and-tumble world of logging and sawmilling, wanted to avoid a strike at all costs.  The lumber workers, however, wanted better wages and conditions, no matter what the price, and almost immediately the union prepared demands for a new working agreement.<br>
<br>
The principal provisions of their proposed new contract called for union recognition, a six-hour day five-day week, overtime and holiday pay, seniority rights and a minimum wage of seventy-five cents an hour." For the mid-1930s it was a significant proposal.<br>
The employers insisted that they could not meet the new demands because of the unfavorable economic conditions in the lumber industry and they maneuvered to "wait out" the fledgling union.<br>
<br>
They claimed they were unable to meet even the NRA Lumber Code which had previously established a forty-two and a half cent per hour wage and a forty hour work week for the lumber industry.<br>
<br>
The workers, nevertheless, firmly believed that the industry could pay more, and they set May 6, 1935 as the day they would strike if the new contract had not been accepted by the employers.  Weeks before the deadline, as negotiations began to break down, lumber workers began leaving the woods and mills.  By May 9, the left wing paper, Voice of Action, estimated that 30,000 workers were on strike.  An estimated fifty percent of the lumber workers employed
in the<br>
<br>
Douglas fir region of the Pacific Northwest eventually stopped work.<br>
Although it was the largest the Northwest had ever witnessed, the strike was never totally solid.  In general, the lines of support followed the Northwest's historical patterns of radical versus conservative unionism.  The strike was weakest in conservative Portland where the locals were quick to back Muir's attempts to settle with the employers.  The large Long-Bell and Weyerhaeuser local just down the river from Portland at Longview, Washington was one of the last to go out.<br>
<br>
However, left-wing support was also weakened when the iww declared itself "neutral" after Communist leaders accused Muir of trying to sell out the strike; in the eyes of the rww, the disciplined approach that the Communists took to union and political work was indistinguishable from the AFL's bureaucratic approach.  The leaflets which the iww issued to publicize its stand called the fight against Muir "an internal struggle within the corrupt AFL."<br>
<br>
At the local level, the strike brought to the surface the divergent interests of workers divided by skill level and political orientation, and it became the pivotal event that linked these divisions among lumber workers with the later factional struggles within the IWA.<br>
<br>
This continuity can be seen in the example of the Raymond, Washington local.  Raymond is just south of Aberdeen on Grays-Willapa Harbor in southwest Washington in the transition zone between the lumber industry's conservative Oregon region and the radical regions in northern Washington and British Columbia.  Thus, the area had been a crossroads for radical and conservative union tendencies for over twenty years.<br>
<br>
In 1911 and 1912, the rww had led immigrant Greek, Austrian and Finnish workers in major strike actions against local lumber operators.  But the owners loaded the foreign-born workers aboard ships and trains of 1912 and replaced them with men of family.  By the end of World War 1, the government-sponsored Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen (4-L) had established itself as firmly as the lww had. 58 During the 1920s the complex social conditions of the Raymond area sustained the influences of both iww radicalism and 4-L conservatism without causing friction in the community.<br>
<br>
This situation changed after the AFL chartered a federal labor union local at Raymond on April 5, 1933.  The workers had sought the local as a response to the Weyerhaeuser company's installation of a new management system at the plant.  The system, called the Bedaux system, was named for Charles Bedaux, a controversial figure best known for his industrial systems of time and motion studies. 
The system installed at Weyerhaeuser was a productivity plan that "permitted more direct central management intervention in the direction, evaluation, and incentive of labor<br>
<br>
The leadership of the new local was dominated by the semi-skilled planer graders whose control over working conditions was most threatened by the Bedaux plan.  But when the workers gathered for a mass grievance meeting on September 5, 1934, the leadership declined to put a strike vote before the body.<br>
<br>
It opted instead for a petition campaign directed at the company's head office and at government agencies.  According to historian Jeremy Egolf, "the conciliatory conclusion of the petition suggested the isolated and economically weak position of the Raymond mill workers, but also was indicative of the liberal social and political alliances of the [union's] leadership, which included ties with supervisory personnel for the purpose of fighting the Bedaux methods."<br>
<br>
This "less radical wing of the leadership," according to Egolf, "was composed primarily of semi-skilled workers and upwardly mobile straw bosses for whom Bedaux controls and speedup represented a regression to work patterns associated with a lower, less skilled status in the work hierarchy.1160 The leadership of the anti-Bedaux struggle remained predominantly in the hands of this conservative faction but they were opposed by a group that favored mobilizing the rank and file for strike action.  The only successful actions against the new system were a few brief strikes led by this faction in the winter and spring of 1935.<br>
<br>
In the spring of 1935, the anti-Bedaux struggle at Raymond was sub-
sumed with other local struggles in the general lumber strike.  The political trajectories of factions and individual leaders also became tributaries of the larger events.  Some of the more conciliatory anti-Bedaux activists were promoted in the company or joined the emerging anti-Communist faction within the union.  Some, like D.C. King, would become leaders of the antiCommunist bloc in 
the <B>NVA<br>
<br>

</B>Others, like Clifford Kight, who had been active in the unemployed movement in the early 1930s and who later led a successful anti-Bedaux strike in South Bend, Washington, either joined or worked closely with the Communist Party.61 Several of these individuals would be associated with the Communist bloc of the nvA 
<B>a </B>few years later.<br>
<br>

"Building <B>a </B>union in opposition to the Bedaux system enjoyed a broad base of support," concluded Egolf, but this solidarity broke down when the struggle came up against the limits to reform which
established labormanagement relations could yield.  Those who were among the most militant about restoring control over their jobs became reactionary when they had to confront the broader ideological and political questions about the transformation of capitalism.  Said Egolf:<br>
<br>
... the expressed goals of the anti-Communist wing of the workers' leadership at Raymond were congruent with their individually ascendant positions within the local working class and their close personal and political ties with local small business and centrist elements in the Democratic machine.  The liberals' ideas... were consonant with the ... conservative elements' efforts to drive Communists and their allies from authoritative positions in the IWA during the late 1930s and 1940s.<br>
<br>
Two political traditions converged within the leadership of the antiBedaux forces.  The priority placed on controlling the work process on the shop floor was an unmistakable legacy from iww policy.  However, the preference for a petition campaign rather than strike tactics was more in keeping with the social democratic traditions of the AFL and the 4-L.<br>
<br>
This merging of anarchs-syndicalist objectives and social democratic tactics was contradictory in most respects, yet both had shared a political base among the native born workers of this area.  Moreover, both traditions carried with them a vehement disdain for communism and it was this common cause that bound them together.<br>
<br>
In the Spring of l1935, however, the fight against communism was still nascent.  More immediate was the dissatisfaction with Abe Muir's conduct of   In the Spring of 1935, however, the fight against communism was still the strike.  It was apparent to everyone that Muir was unwilling to lead a strike to uphold the original demands of the union.  The more conservative strike leaders such as those in Raymond and Portland were willing to go along with his stand but the Communists were not, and it was they who took control of the strike and set it on a course that would lead to a break with the AFL.<br>
<br>

<B>The Northwest Joint Strike Committee</B><br>
<br>
Abe Muir hoped to negotiate a uniform working agreement with the major Longview lumber operators that could be applied to the entire lumber industry in the Northwest,63 but on May 10, about nine hundred Long-Bell and Weyerhaeuser Lumber Company employees in Longview walked out of a union meeting before a vote could be taken to ratify an agreement Muir had negotiated with company representatives.<br>
<br>
On May 13, the same loggers and sawmill workers voted nine to one to reject the May 10 proposal of fifty cents an hour, a forty-hour week, time-and-one-half for overtime and union recognition with no closed shop.  Militant unionists soon referred to this proposal as
the "sell-out" or "Muir Compromise."<br>
<br>
The Longview negotiations served only to confirm dissatisfaction with Muir.  Since May 3, the Voice ofaction had been demanding his resignation and the formation of a Joint Strike Committee to establish rank-and-file control of the strike.  At Aberdeen on June 5, 240 insurgent anti-Muir delegates from the Sawmill and Timber Workers Union and the dormant National Lumber Workers Union met to wrest control of the strike from the Carpenters' executive.  They rejected Muir's Longview settlement and formed their own Northwest Joint Strike Committee to open new negotiations with the lumber operators.<br>
<br>
Forty locals were affiliated with the Joint Strike Committee by July I.<br>
<br>
On June 9, the Aberdeen boom workers had voted to support the Committee; sawmill workers there voted 970 to 57 on June 23 to continue on strike; three days later lumber workers in Portland unanimously voted to,stay out for a guarantee of collective bargaining.  By 1,500 to 3, Everett, Washington lumber workers rejected a back to work offer on July I 1; only 51 out of 1, 157 workers wanted to accept Muir's proposal at Tacoma on July 28; two days later, the same workers refused to even reconsider the proposal.<br>
<br>
On August 1, Raymond, Washington lumber workers voted nearly two to one to reject Muir's plans.  The votes clearly belied the media's picture of the strike as the work of a handful of radicals in the Northwest Joint Strike Committee. Communist lumber workers did, however, participate in the Joint Strike Committee.<br>
<br>
On March 16, 1935, the Trade Union Unity League was dissolved and the Communist Party once again adopted the policy of "boring from within" Communist labor organizers were no longer committed to establishing "dual unions" such as the National Lumber Workers Union, which tended to be sectarian and isolated from the mass of lumber workers.<br>
<br>
They were now free to organize within existing AFL unions.  As early as February 23, 1935, the Voice of Action carried a statement from the Northwest District Communist Party that urged party members to join the AFL and promote concrete demands such as fights against wage cuts, rising pay for rising prices, a reduction in hours without reduction in pay, elimination of the speedup, real social insurance and unemployment relief.<br>
<br>
On April 15, 1935, the Communist-led National Lumber Workers Union officially disbanded.<br>

During a conference at Tacoma the union's leaders proposed that the entire membership join the AFL'S Sawmill and Timber Workers Union ". . . and make the AFL more militant despite the AFL admin-
istration." Shortly thereafter, James Murphy, former president of the National Lumber Workers Union and an active member of the Communist Party, joined the Northwest Joint Strike Committee and began exercising considerable influence in its deliberations.<br>
<br>
Communists brought years of organizing experience into the movement.  Karly Larsen, a Danish immigrant working at Lyman Timber Company, had joined the rww at thirteen and had been organizing among the local unemployed since 1930.  In one action Larsen and others had led a hunger march of seven thousand to the state capital in Olympia; in another, they led a raid on an Anacortes grocery store and redistributed food to the unemployed.  Shortly after the strike, Larsen was elected to the District Executive Board of the AFL'S Sawmill and Timber Workers Union."<br>
<br>
The tactics of the communists and left-wingers in the Strike Committee were similar to those employed during the 1934 Longshore Strike.<br>
<br>
They placed Party members on the picket lines whenever possible and distributed leaflets to persuade union members to support the Committee and the original demands.  Almost every night and on weekends Committee members met to discuss strategy and establish the evening's "roving committee."<br>
<br>
These special groups within the larger Joint Strike Committee were charged with the responsibility of bolstering picket line discipline and preventing a back-to-work movement.  Under cover of night, carloads of men moved into mill towns from Portland to Aberdeen and north to Everett.  With few mimeograph machines and little access to radio, it was imperative that the roving strikers meet with other rank and filers to combat Muir's steady "compromise" propaganda .<br>
<br>
The decision of the National Lumber Workers Union to disband and "bore from within" the AFL had marked results as the Northwest Joint Strike Committee and its activist "roving committees" pushed lumber workers to the left and toward industrial unionism.<br>
<br>
Whenever prior contact with Unemployed Councils or with "Muir's compromise" failed to move a logger to support the strike, the roving committees advocated other methods.<br>
<br>
At a logging camp in Oregon's North Coast Range a rigging slinger who had been wavering in his decision to join the Strike Committee was spied up a spar tree that had a hornets' nest propitiously nestled at its base.  Chunks of bark heaved from a safe distance by fellow loggers soon shattered the nest, and the confused hornets
quickly attacked the rigger.  After repeated confrontations with the hornets, the reluctant logger agreed to sign up: "I'll join your union if you'll only let me down .<br>
<br>
But Muir was a different matter.  When he realized that confrontation with the Strike Committee threatened the future of the Sawmill and Timber Workers Union, he countered the lumber workers' solidarity by expelling those union leaders who opposed his "compromise" settlement.<br>
<br>
Those lumber workers who still rejected his leadership, he punished by revoking their local union chart ' ers and summarily placing them in separate locals under his jurisdiction.  At the same time, many small locals, as well as larger units in Bellingham and Port Ludlow, Washington, and Coos Bay, Oregon, remained loyal to him.  The powerful and conservative locals in Portland were also his consistent supporters .<br>
<br>
The lumber operators also joined with Muir and the Carpenters' officials to denounce the Communists and left-wingers who encouraged workers to hold out for the original strike demands.<br>
<br>
At the early negotiations with the Long-Bell and Weyerhaeuser lumber companies, Abe Muir cautioned the employers that a "flying squadron of Reds" was coming up from Portland to picket the mills.  The AFL'S Oregon Labor Press had previously warned mill operators to " - . deal with the regularly organized AFL union in the industry" or face the possibility of "dealing with Communists in the future.""<br>
<br>
Muir's plan was simple: he expected the lumber workers to accept his strike settlement when given the alternative of dealing with a Communist dominated Strike Committee.<br>
<br>
The lumber operators hoped to prevent a successful conclusion to the strike by identifying all the activists in the Committee with the Communist Party.  To the dismay of both Muir and the lumber companies, the strategy failed to work; the majority of lumber workers refused to desert the Strike Committee, and they disregarded the accusation that it was completely Communist-led.<br>
<br>
They contended that the Committee had been formed to ". . free the membership [of the union] from [Abe Muir's] dictatorship." But while the Committee wanted Muir removed immediately, it had no desire at that time to withdraw the lumber workers from the AFL and form a new, Communist-led union.<br>
<br>

The striking lumber workers got help from the Unemployed Councils and from President Roosevelt's Federal Emergency Relief Administration which granted relief benefits to lumber workers on strike.<br>
<br>
Since the International Longshoremen's Association had a debt to 
repay from the 1934 longshore strike, the <B>ILA's </B>members refused to load lumber produced by members of the Muir faction.  One well-known Communist longshoreman, Harry Pitcher, took leave from the iLA to organize for the Northwest Joint Strike Committee.  He advised loggers and mill workers to adopt the militancy and unified stance that had enabled the longshor@men to win.  Many of the most militant loggers' locals along the Northwest waterfront were in close communication with the longshoremen.<br>
<br>
But employers could also marshal support.  Assessments were levied to obtain the funds necessary to defeat the strike.  In Seattle, the "Committee of Five Hundred," which the Strike Committee believed was really a front for the Chamber of Commerce, placed full-page ads in the newspapers.<br>
<br>
According to this "Committee," the disagreement was all the work of a few burly, radical loggers who recklessly continued the strike even though it meant ruination for the industry.  Daily news bulletins went out to Northwest lumber operators from the Portland office of Crow's Pacific Coast Lumber Digest, the industry's West Coast publication.<br>
<br>
The editor's predictions of a quick failure for the strike helped solidify the resistance of the employers.  In May, 1935, he announced an "...inevitable collapse of the strike. . .," on May 21: ". . . each day brings added reports of an increasing number of employees "pressing a desire to be back to work on the old basis" (emphasis added); May 25: ". . . strike leaders are not admitting that they are whipped." And on June 15: the strike is well on its way out.<br>
<B><br>
<br>

State and Employer Violence</B><br>
<br>
The demand for containers to ship the Northwest's fruit and vegetable harvest increased the pressure to end the strike by late June.  Lumber to fill the orders was either not being produced or being boycotted on the docks by longshoremen who refused to handle "hot cargo."<br>
<br>
The first use of violence by the employers and the police came in Humboldt County, California. Northern California mill owners who blamed the strike on outside agitators had responded by hiring a private militia to help local police; they had laid in a supply
of tear gas and enthusiastically recruited strikebreakers.<br>
<br>
On June 21, 1935, Eureka, California police and gunmen hired by the mill owners opened fire on unarmed pickets assembled at the entrance to the Holmes-Eureka mill.  Three men, all Finns, were killed.  Scores more, suffering from gunshot wounds and exposure to tear gas, were taken to the hospital.  Others, fearing arrest, were carried home to be treated by family and friends.  For days afterward, lumber workers who supported the strike were arrested and jailed on assault charges for strike activities.<br>
<br>
On June 26 trouble began nearer to the strike's centre of strength when Washington Governor Clarence Martin promised either State Police or National Guard protection to all employers who wished to reopen their mills.  His radio address was laden with stereotypes gleaned from the employers'propaganda and from the headlines of Seattle's large dailies.<br>
<br>
Strikebreakers were depicted as "workers," union men as "agitators." According to the Governor, the majority of lumber workers wished to return to work, but they were intimidated by a few radicals.  Strikers and their sympathizers would no longer be allowed to terrorize workers who otherwise would have returned to work long ago.<br>
<br>
Soon, the inevitable confrontations and fights between striking pickets and "scabs" began.  The Strike Committee contended that police and guardsmen precipitated the violence when they sheltered those who were trying to break the picket lines.  Pickets beat "scabs"; strikebreakers beat pickets.<br>
<br>
It depended upon who had the upper hand at the entrance to the mills and logging camps. At Longview, Washington state police fired tear gas to scatter the pickets.  When the strikers obtained an injunction to halt the intervention, the state police paid little attention to the court.<br>
<br>
In Aberdeen and Hoquiam, Washington on July 7, National Guard troops and State Police reinforced local police who had already clashed several times with the two thousand pickets who were blocking the employers' attempt to open the mills.<br>
<br>
The next day, six to ten thousand demonstrators marched through the "Twin Cities" to protest  Governor Martin's use of troops and police to provide protection for the strikebreakers.  Rumors circulated that a general strike would be called if the soldiers were not withdrawn.  But M@ was steadfast; the mills would be reopened for those who wished to work.  He continued to profess that the strike was mostly the work of Communists.<br>
<br>

In Tacoma, the strikers clashed repeatedly with guardsmen who protected the movement of scabs to and from the mills.<br>
<br>
They had received orders to prohibit picketing, and to prevent pedestrians from assembling in the industrial part of the city.  On June 12, seven thousand union men and strike sympathizers marched peacefully in a large circle at the downtown intersection of Eleventh and "A" Streets, their leaders carrying American flags.  Although the marchers used the crosswalks, traffic was blocked.<br>
<br>
The site of the march had been chosen because it was adjacent to the Eleventh Street bridge which connected the city centre with the industrial section of Tacoma, the same bridge that the strikebreakers had to pass over every day on the way home from work.  Ready for trouble, police stood by and guardsmen with fixed bayonets established a line across the bridge.<br>
<br>
Taunts and jeers greeted the strikebreakers as they came down the bridge.  Women and children joined in the booing and helped pelt the guardsmen with rocks and sticks.  The troops lobbed tear gas bombs into the crowds, but just as quickly, the wind blew the smoke back into their own faces.  Other tear gas cannisters were picked up by the marchers and hurled back amid the guardsmen, only some of whom had appropriate gas masks.<br>
<br>
The police then called in heavier equipment.  A military vehicle which expelled tear gas through its exhaust pipe was sent into the crowd but its driver was pulled from the cab and attacked before the overturned truck caught fire and burned in the middle of Eleventh Street.  After that, the troops abandoned the bridge and the last significant battle between lumber workers and guardsmen was over.  The demonstrators soon dispersed but arrests followed.<br>
<br>
While State Police and guardsmen confronted strikers on the outside, Abe Muir was busy on the inside, sowing intraunion dissension.  In Aberdeen and Everett, previously tested strikebreaking tactics were again applied.  Muir revoked charters of locals that continued to support the Northwest Joint Strike Committee and granted new charters under leadership from outside the Committee.  Undercut by both Muir and Martin, the Committee appeared to have lost the strike.<br>
<br>
In Portland, meanwhile, the Northwest Joint Strike Committee and Communist activists had made little progress.  Party members who were actively involved with the Committee occasionally came down to Portland to encourage the sawmill workers to support the strike, but President William Wedal and Secretary Frank Johnson of the Portland Sawmill and Timber Workers local both supported Abe Muir.  
Johnson vowed that local sawmill workers were standing ". . . one hundred percent behind the American Federation of Labor boys."" The mill owners refused to recognize the Strike Committee and preferred instead to negotiate with Muir's more conservative representatives.<br>
<br>
Since they numbered less than 300 of the 2,500 local members, the Strike Committee in Portland could therefore not press for a settlement based on their original demands.<br>
<br>
The inability of either the strikers or the employers to win an outright victory opened the way for federal mediation.  Franklin Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor, Frances Perkins, appointed a three-member Federal Labor Mediation Board late in June.  The compromises inherent in the process were acceptable to the lumber workers, but not to Governor Martin and the employers." Why should lumber companies submit to arbitration, they asked, when the strike was bound to fail?<br>
<br>
They were, moreover, suspicious of a labor board appointed by a Democratic president's Department of Labor.  But their rejection of the Board was couched in terms calculated to place the onus on the Northwest Joint Strike Committee for the continuation of the dispute: "It is no longer a question between employers and employees, but between the constituted authorities and a lawless element.",'<br>
<br>
By late July, 1935, the strike had, for all practical purposes, collapsed even though employers continued to exaggerate the numbers of workers willing to return to work.<br>
<br>
The lumber operators implemented Muir's agreement: lumber workers should be willing to work for fifty cents an hour minimum for a standard forty hours per week.  Mills in Seattle, Bellingham, Aberdeen, Portland, Longview and Olympia were soon working under these terms.<br>
<br>
Instead of a "closed shop" and strict union recognition, em-
ployers agreed to acknowledge committees of union members authorized to bargain over safety and working conditions in the camps and MillS.14 Disagreements and scattered clashes continued, especially where lumber operators failed to rehire former radical unionists, but militant locals were not above calling a "quickie" strike to insure that a  strike activist was reemployed.<br>
<br>
On August 5, Tacoma lumber workers finally voted 1,391 to 97 to accept the settlement, but Grays Harbor militants held firm and State Police continued to confront the pickets there.  Then on August 13, Governor Martin appointed Washington National Guard Brigadier General Carlos Pennington to act as "mediator."<br>
<br>
In less than one week, the strike in the harbor towns of Aberdeen
and Hoquiam was over; by then, most lumber workers throughout the Northwest were back in the mills or on their way to the logging camps.  Operations were once again at "full-bell."<br>

REPORT OF COLONEL JOSEPH GREENE<br>
ON LABOR TROUBLES IN KING COUNTY<br>
<br>
HEADQUARTERS FIRST REGIMENT INFANTRY, FIRST<br>
BRIGADE, NATIONAL GUARD OF WASHINGTON<br>
<br>
Seattle, 23 January 1892<br>
<br>
TO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR ELISHA P. FERRY, COMMANDER IN CHIEF, N.G.W., OLYMPIA<br>
<br>
Sir:  I have the honor to submit the following report of the movements of the  several companies of the First Regiment, National Guard of Washington, in service during the mining troubles in King County in the months of June and July, 1891. Delay in making this report was caused:<br>
<br>
FIRST:  By the refusal until recently of the commander-in-chief to recognize these companies as being in the service of the State.<br>
<br>
SECOND:  The death of Colonel J.C. Haines, who commanded the troops at that time.<br>
<br>
On the 24th day of June, 1891, there was a large body of armed men riotously assembled at Gilman, in King County, and threatened to destroy the buildings and machinery connected with the operation of the coal mines there.  The sheriff of the county being absent, the manager of the mine applied to the deputy sheriff for a sufficient force to protect it from injury and destruction, but the deputy declined to act in the absence of the sheriff.<br>
<br>
The manager requested Colonel Haines to order out troops from his regiment for that purpose.  This he refused to do.  The manager then requested Colonel Haines whether, if the sheriff should call upon him for troops, to act as a posse comitatus, he would furnish them.  Colonel Haines declined to act without orders from you, but at the request of the manager of the mine sent you the following telegram:<br>
<br>
SEATTLE, 24 June 1891<br>
<br>
GOVERNOR E.P. FERRY, OLYMPIA HOTEL:<br>
<br>
I AM INFORMED THAT A RIOT HAS OCCURRED AT GILMAN, AND THE DESTRUCTION OF MINE PROPERTY IS THREATENED NOW BY ARMED MEN.  THE SHERIFF IS AT WALLA WALLA.  HIS DEPUTY HERE DECLINES TO ACT FOR WANT OF AUTHORITY.  THE OWNERS OF THE MINE HAVE APPEALED TO ME FOR PROTECTION.  I HAVE REFUSED UNTIL PROPERLY ORDERED.  IF THE SHERIFF
REQUESTS ME TO SEND TROOPS TO USE AS A POSSE, CAN I DO IT WITHOUT ORDERS FROM YOU? SEE SECTION 860 OF THE CODE, AND ELA vs SMITH, 5 Gray, 121.  I AM INFORMED THAT THE SITUATION IS CRITICAL, AND THAT LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY ARE LIKELY UNLESS PROMPT ACTION IS TAKEN.<br>
<br>
COLONEL J.C. HAINES<br>
<br>
"And received in reply the following:"<br>
<br>
OLYMPIA, 25 June 1891<br>
<br>
COLONEL J.C. HAINES, COMMANDING FIRST REGIMENT, N.G.W., SEATTLE<br>
<br>
IF ANY OFFICER MENTIONED IN SECTION 860 OF THE CODE OF WASHINGTON CALLS FOR AN ARMED FORCE TO SUPPRESS A RIOT, OR TO ENFORCE THE EXECUTION OF THE LAWS AT GILMAN, IN KING COUNTY, YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY REPAIR TO THAT PLACE WITH ONE OR MORE COMPANIES OF N.G.W., AS YOU MAY DEEM ADVISABLE, AND RENDER SUCH AID TO THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES AS MAY BE NECESSARY.<br>
<br>
ELISHA P. FERRY, GOVERNOR<br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
<br>
On the evening, the 27th day of June, 1891, a riot occurred at the town of Franklin, in King County which resulted in a battle between the striking miners and the negroes who had been brought in to take their places, and in which two men were killed and several wounded.  The deputy at that point was unable to quell the riot, or disperse the mob, and the conflict ceased only, on account of the approach of darkness, and it was evidently their intention to resume the conflict on the following day.<br>
<br>
The deputy sheriff telegraphed Colonel Haines, at Seattle, requesting him to order immediately to Franklin one or more companies of his regiment to assist the civil authorities in preserving the peace.  This telegram was received by Colonel Haines at about half-past ten in the evening, of 28 June.  He immediately issued the following order:<br>
<br>
HEADQUARTERS, FIRST REGIMENT INFANTRY, N.G.W.,<br>
SPECIAL ORDER NO. 12     Seattle, 28 June 1891<br>
<br>
1.  Captain Green, commanding B company, of this regiment, and Captain Allen, commanding D company, will proceed immediately to Franklin, having companies in heavy marching order, with forty rounds of ammunition per man.<br>
<br>
2.  Transportation will be furnished.<br>
<br>
3.  Commissary J.A. Hatfield will furnish subsistence.
4.  The surgeon of the regiment will accompany the command and report immediately at these headquarters.<br>
<br>
BY ORDER OF COLONEL J.C. HAINES<br>
<br>
OFFICIAL:  CHARLES ESPLIN, JR., FIRST LIEUTENANT AND ADJUTANT<br>
<br>
"HE SENT YOU THE FOLLOWING TELEGRAM:"<br>
<br>
SEATTLE, 28 June 1891<br>
<br>
ELISHA P. FERRY<br>
<br>
I have received a request from a deputy sheriff to send a company of the National Guard to Franklin immediately, he expecting a riot at any moment, Several persons have been shot.  I have ordered a company there and will accompany them.  I have no specified orders from you except for Gilman.  If my action is not approved, wire me at Franklin.<br>
<br>
J.C. HAINES<br>
<br>
"No reply was received to the above message."<br>
<br>
The members of these companies were scattered throughout the city, and it was only by the exercise of the utmost diligence that they were assembled at the armory before midnight.  As soon as a sufficient number of these companies were assembled to constitute one company available for duty, he proceeded with them at once to Franklin, arriving there at daybreak.  The arrival and presence of the troops at Franklin, prevented any further outbreak at that point, it being necessary, however, to keep a force there until 15 July.<br>
<br>
On 30 June, the threatened riot at Gilman occurred, and the sheriff after endeavoring in vain to quell it, requested Colonel Haines to send two companies of his regiment to that place, for the purpose of assisting the civil authorities in preserving peace, maintaining order and preventing the destruction of life and property.  This he immediately did, transferring Company D from Franklin, and ordering Company E of Seattle to that point. They arrived at Gilman on the morning of July 1st, and reported to the sheriff's deputy and remained on duty until the 13th of July, preventing by their presence any further riotous demonstrations.<br>
<br>
At the towns of Franklin, New Castle, Black Diamond and Gilman, in King County there are large and valuable coal mines, the operation of which constitutes one of the principal industries of the state; strikes had occurred at these points and work in<br>
consequence was suspended.  The miners refused to work, except on their own terms, and refused to allow any one else to work them at all, while the owners of the mines would not accept the terms insisted upon by the miners, and were endeavoring at Franklin, Newcastle and Gilman to work the mines with other laborers.  The
<br>
miners in order to prevent the operation of the mines, except on their own terms, organized military companies at these places, and armed them with rifles and shotguns, and supplied them with ammunition.  These companies were daily drilled and paraded under arms, and were used as a constant menace for the purpose of preventing the operation of the mines in any way, except upon the terms insisted upon by the miners.  In consequence of the employment of these methods by the miners the owners of the coal mines at Gilman and Black Diamond were unable to work their mines at all, and at New Castle and Franklin were able to work them only by the maintenance of a large body of armed men, employed and paid by them.  These military organizations, which were entirely unauthorized by law, were a constant menace to the public peace, and caused great terror and alarm among the people in those towns who were not sympathizers with the striking miners, and on 2 July 1891, Colonel Haines received the following telegram from you:<br>
<br>
OLYMPIA, 2 July 1891<br>
<br>
COL. J.C. HAINES, FRANKLIN:<br>
<br>
THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES SHOULD DISARM ALL UNAUTHORIZED ARMED BODIES AT FRANKLIN, GILMAN AND ELSEWHERE IN KING COUNTY WHERE THERE IS DANGER OF A RIOT OR BREACH OF THE PEACE.  YOU WILL RENDER ALL NECESSARY ASSISTANCE TO THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES IN THAT DIRECTION. AFTER DISARMAMENT THE SHERIFF AND DEPUTIES WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO PRESERVE THE PEACE, AND THE PRESENCE OF THE MILITIA WILL NO LONGER BE REQUIRED.  A REQUEST FOR VOLUNTARY DISARMAMENT BY ALL THE PARTIES SHOULD BE MADE BEFORE ACTIVE MEASURES ARE TAKEN.<br>
<br>
ELISHA P. FERRY, GOVERNOR<br>
<br>
"He, not deeming the force at his disposal sufficient to carry out your orders, in reply sent you the following telegram:<br>
<br>
GILMAN, 2 July 1891<br>
<br>
HON. ELISHA P. FERRY:<br>
<br>

<br>
The sheriff of the county, for the purpose of carrying out your order contained in your first telegram, on 2 July, requested Colonel Haines to send a company to New Castle, one to Black Diamond and one to Franklin; there being but one company at the latter place, company D having been transferred to Gilman.<br>
<br>
On 2 July Colonel Haines accordingly telegraphed Captain Fife, commanding company C at Tacoma, as follows, sending also a copy of the same message to Capt. Shank, commanding company G (also Tacoma):<br>

<br>
In compliance with your instructions contained in your telegram of 2 July, to render assistance to the civil authorities in disarming all unauthorized armed bodies in King County, Colonel Haines issued a circular letter to the owners of the mines at Franklin, Black Diamond, New Castle and Gilman, of which the following is a copy:<br>
<br>
Seattle, 4 July 1891<br>
<br>
TO THE OREGON IMPROVEMENT COMPANY, FRANKLIN:<br>
<br>
As the officer in immediate command of the state troops now in the field, I am instructed by the sheriff of this county to notify you that there is a force of state troops now stationed at Gilman
sufficient to protect the property of your company located there, and to insure the safety of your employees.  I am assured by the Governor and the Brigadier General, commanding this Brigade, that such force will be maintained until the civil authorities are able to afford the same protection now given by the military arm of the state.  I therefore request you to remove from Gilman on or before twelve o'clock noon of the 6th day of July, 1891, all guards and armed men stationed or maintained at that place by you or under your authority, on the ground that it is prejudicial to good order that while the responsibility is cast upon the civil authorities and the National Guard, their duties be shared by any body of men not acting under authority of the law.<br>
<br>
Very respectfully yours.<br>
J.C. HAINES, COL, 1ST REGT, NGW<br>
<br>
Colonel Haines also issued the following order:<br>
<br>
HEADQUARTERS, FIRST REGIMENT INFANTRY, NGW<br>
SPECIAL ORDER NO. 17     Seattle, 6 July 1891<br>
<br>
1.  Inasmuch as the owners of the coal mines at the several stations of the troops of this command now in the field have been requested at twelve o'clock noon on the 6th day of July, 1891,to remove from their property all guardsman and armed men now maintained by them or under their authority, and inasmuch as it is probable that this request will be complied with, and inasmuch as this request has been made upon the ground that the force of the state troops now at such points as is sufficient to insure the safety of the property and persons at such mines, the post com-
manders at Franklin, Black Diamond, New Castle and Gilman, will obey carefully the following instructions:<br>
<br>
FIRST:  They will keep in mind the elementary maxim that the military is always subordinate to the civil power of the state.<br>
<br>
SECOND:  They will never act unless it be in self defense except upon the request or with the approval of the sheriff or deputy sheriff stationed at the posts at which such post commander may be, but will always act promptly upon receiving a request to do so from such authority.<br>
<br>
THIRD:  They will dispose their guards in such a manner as to afford protection to the property, lives and liberty of all persons within the limit of their post, and will to the extent of their ability preserve peace and good order at all times within such limits; they will allow no interference by violence, intimidation or manifestations of force of persons lawfully employed either upon their own property or the property of their employers.<br>
<br>
FOURTH:  In the use of the National Guard for the protection of property, post commanders must remember that the troops under their command are not to take the place of private watchmen such as are ordinarily employed for the protection of property from fire or
other injury incident to the ordinary condition of affairs, but that any persons within the limits of their post has the right to maintain such watchmen in the usual and ordinary manner.<br>
<br>
These instructions, however, must not be construed so as to allow the employment or maintenance of any body of armed men, or to allow the carrying or display of arms or the use of the same in such manner as to create public disturbance or tend to a breach of the peace.<br>
<br>
2.  In case of any doubt in their minds as to the question of their authority or powers, or any uncertainty as to the meaning and import of these instructions, they will communicate by telegraph to the commanding officer of the regiment.<br>
<br>
BY ORDER OF COLONEL HAINES:<br>
<br>
OFFICIAL:  Chas. Esplin, Jr., First Lieut. and Adjutant.<br>
<br>
*       *       *       *       *       *       *       *<br>
<br>
Captain Fife was directed to send ten men and a sergeant from Black Diamond to New Castle to strengthen the force at that point.<br>
<br>
On this date Captain Fife reported that the Black Diamond miners had met and consented to disband and turn over their arms to the sheriff.  Later he wired that the miners' committee had reported to him that they could not get any satisfaction from their men until they ascertained that the Oregon Improvement Company has turned over all their arms first.  On the same day Captain J. Green, commanding the company at Franklin, wired that the Oregon Improvement Company had turned in thirty eight carbines, sixteen revolvers and five rifle; strikers and citizens twenty-eight guns and rifles.<br>
<br>
On 10 July, everything being quite at Black Diamond, and in order to relieve companies D and E from duty at Gilman, Colonel Haines issued the following order transferring company C from Black Diamond to that point, the same order also relieving company B from duty at Franklin:<br>

Haines, whose whole mind was set upon the solving of the difficulties as presented, and who in the critical moments showed that rare judgment which characterized him at all times during his life, and which in these troubles on several occasions prevented loss of life and property."<br>

FRANKLIN MINE STRIKE<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the nearby Gilman mine moved against the Knights of Labor. About the beginning of 1891, Superintendent Park began transferring certain miners, including Knights of Labor activists, to two particular pits. Then, claiming over production, he closed down the two pits, idling one hundred men. Parker refused to allow the two hundred working miners in the other four pits to divide the work with the idle miners, and he blacklisted twenty-five men so they could not get work anywhere in the state.<br>
<br>
At this point, early in March, 1891, the miners struck. The Knights charged the layoffs and blacklist were to break the union. The company brought in Sullivan guards and evicted the striking miners living on company property.<br>
<br>
Ventilation in the other Oregon Improvement Company mines at Franklin was so bad by the summer of 1890 that the mine inspector threatened to close down the operations. Accordingly, in September, the Company stopped all mining except preparatory work for opening new shafts, throwing two hundred miners out of work. A few miners went to work at Black Diamond, but most stayed at Franklin expecting to go back to work when the new slopes were ready.<br>
<br>
On May 11, 1891, the Western Central Labor Union received word that Superintendent Corey had shipped six hundred fifty blacks from Saint Louis to work at Franklin.<br>
<br>
The blacks arrived May 17, 1891, armed with Spencer carbines and revolvers and accompanied by one hundred Sullivan guards armed with
Winchesters. They went into camp close to the mouth of the main slope and erected a barbed wire fence around the mine. The Guards established a deadline and prevented white miners from communicating with the imported blacks.<br>
<br>
The white miners wee offered work if they would give up their Knights assembly and sign iron clad contracts foreswearing the union. They were locked out when the refused and the blacks worked the mine.  The few white miners who deserted the union and scabbed were despised by their former associates.<br>
<br>
In a letter May 21, 1891, the state president of the sheriff's association, Pierce County Sheriff James H. Price protested the illegal presence of Sullivan guards at Franklin. The Tacoma Trades Council condemned the mine owners for "introducing Pinkerton thugs and government of the state in allowing them to do so." (Tacoma Trades Council Minutes, May 21, 1891).<br>
<br>
The <B>Ledger</B> defended the owners, declaring the frequency of strikes<br>
<br>
"...has done more than any one thing to bring about the present depression, and made employment hard to get at any price. It has kept new enterprises from starting and old ones from growing, and has thus lessened the demand for labor. It has made all business dependent on labor so uncertain that men of means engage in it reluctantly and much prefer something less remunerative which is accompanied by less uncertainty. (<B>Ledger</B> May 21, 1891).<br>
<br>
The Western Central Labor Union of Seattle sponsored a drive for a miners' relief fund. May 25, 1891, Charles Seymour, master workman of the Knights of Labor Stevedores' Assembly, presided at a fund-
raiser in Old Town, addressed by E.J. McConnell and Mr. Nagle of Seattle.<br>
<br>
Sheriff Price was called upon to speak:<br>
<br>
"You all know how I feel about the labor question. As chief peace officer of this county, I will say that I see no reason for alarm, nor for the placing of armed guards at the mines. There was no occasion, to my mind for the importation of a crowd of men, coming in to over ride the power invested in the chief peace officer, the Sheriff of King County.<br>
<br>
"I do not say this with any ill feeling to our corporations, who are developing our resources, but I am decidedly opposed to an indiscriminate collection of men assuming the duties of duly appointed officers. If forty strikes should occur there is no need to call in an armed mob." (<B>Ledger</B>, May 27, 1891.).<br>
<br>
County Commissioner Joseph Jahns, who had worked with Mc Connell for years in the Knights of Labor, told the audience that "...a few years ago coal miners were obliged to buy their supplies from the company they worked for, to work long hours and to board at the company's boarding houses. Now by the action of the Knights of
Labor these restrictions to the miner's liberty are removed." (<B>Ledger</B>, May 27, 1891.).<br>
<br>
He "...denounced the action of the Oregon Company in importing Negro minters," and "...concluded by saying that in this case, as in others, the workingmen should stand together to see that the miners secured their rights."<br>
<br>
The meeting pledged about one hundred dollars for relief. The same night a mass meeting sponsored by the Carpenters Union on the eight hour question also subscribed money for relief.  The Carpenters donated directly to the locked out miners, and the Typographical Union gave one hundred dollars, the proceeds from its ball. Pierce County unions raised about one third of the relief fund.<br>
<br>
On realizing their position, some of the blacks signified their willingness to leave the area if they had transportation. A communication from E.J. McConnell was presented at the Tacoma Trades Council meeting held May 28, 1891:<br>
<br>
"...asking endorsement for a bearer to the Conductors and Brakemen's Unions.... Laid over as not looking O.K.... Colored men returned with regular credentials from the W.C. L.U.... Voted to endorse credentials recommending men to assist all Union men in all honorable ways..." (Trades Council Minutes, May 28, 1891).<br>
<br>
The blacks with credentials from the Western Central Labor Union were union miners helping the strikers by convincing black scabs to quit and getting them away from the mines. Their purpose in talking to the conductors and brakemen's unions may have been to persuade train crews to let departing blacks ride the freights unmolested.<br>
<br>
The Bricklayers donated twenty-five dollars to the black miners from Seattle. Twelve to fifteen blacks were deserting the Franklin mine each day and making their way to Tacoma. There the police ran them out of town.<br>
<br>
On June 4, 1891, a group of miners, their wives, and the Western Central Labor Union filed a suit in equity in King County  Superior Court against the Oregon Improvement Company and M.G. Sullivan, in command of the Franklin Armed Guards. The  plaintiffs sought to disarm the guards, charging them with interfering with miners' access to their homes by harassment and intimidation.<br>
<br>
The company was literally surrounding their homes with fences and sheds. One young guard accidently killed another guard while illustrating the proper way to draw a gun.<br>
<br>
The <B>News</B> condemned the guards:<br>
<br>
"The presence of armed detectives at Franklin has already caused the wife of one of the white miners to lose her mind. Whole families are prisoners and are not allowed to pass the sentries without given the password, while many other indignities are
practiced by the imported "guardians of the peace."<br>
<br>
"It is to be hoped that the effort being made to have them disarmed and dispersed will succeed."<br>
<br>
The continued harassment forced the miners and their families out of their homes. They built about a hundred rough cabins in a wooded canyon off company property. The June days passed with the locked out miners camped in the woods. By this time the Newcastle miners were also on strike against the Oregon Improvement Company.<br>
<br>
At 3:00 a.m. on Sunday, June 28, 1891, a trained picked up eighty black miners and ten guards at Franklin, bound for the Newcastle Mine.  Two hours later the scabs were delivered to Newcastle, to join sixty whites working in the mine.  The train picked up additional black scabs in Seattle and headed for Franklin Sunday evening.<br>
<br>
Approaching Franklin, the guards, most of them drunk, began firing their revolvers from the train. The scab miners heard the gun shots, thought they were being attacked, and boiled out of their camp to the edge of the canyon. They emptied their weapons in the direction of the cabins, as terror stricken women and children fled into the woods. The barrage from and estimated five hundred scabs and guards lasted half an hour. The miners did not return the fire.  A woman inside her cabin as shot in the breast.<br>
<br>
Thomas Morris, a locked out Franklin miner, and Edward J. Williams, a Black Diamond Miner, were walking along a trail near Franklin when the gun fire erupted. Superintendent Park B. Robinson grabbed his gun and shot them as the unarmed men begged for their lives. Morris died immediately but Williams lived long enough to make a statement of the facts.<br>
<br>
A gun was found under the body of Morris. After investigating the evidence W.A. Ryan, <B>Tacoma News</B> reporter, concluded that the company or the sheriff had planted the gun to substantiate Robinson's story that he had shot in self defense.  One scab was wounded during the disorder.<br>
<br>
Blacks blamed the union miners. Two companies of the State Militia wee hastily called up, arrived at Franklin about midnight.<br>
<br>
The miners buried their dead in the Black Diamond Cemetery on June 30, 1891. The Franklin miners' band and a large delegation of men, women, and children accompanied the bodies on a flatcar. At Black Diamond they were met by four hundred and forty men and women.<br>
<br>
After the service only one women and twenty-five men returned to the canyon camp at Franklin. The Black Diamond Miners were equally frightened. After blacks were reported in the vicinity, the miners and their families spent the night in the town hall, fearful of attack.<br>

Terror continued in the canyon at Franklin. Ryan estimated there were about thirty rifles and two hundred rounds of ammunition in the camp. The miners organized a home guard of twenty men to protect their families. The mine boss's wife appeared in camp on June 30th with the story that the blacks planned to attack the camp after the men left for the funeral, sack and burn the cabins and kill the women and children.<br>
<br>
Again the women and children fled to the woods. On their return to camp the next day, another rumor circulated that the blacks would attack that night. Two hundred fifty men, women, and children returned to the woods, leaving a group of men to guard the camp, including Master Workman J.W. Bailey of the local Knights of Labor assembly.<br>
<br>
<B>The Tacoma News</B> reported Ryan spent the night with the only family remaining in camp. In the woods during the night a woman gave birth to a baby who died immediately.<br>
<br>
The <B>News</B> reporter concluded that the "...whole thing was deliberately pre-arranged..." to scare the union miners. Colonel Haines, attorney for the Oregon Improvement Company, had called up the militia illegally without the required request of the King County sheriff. The mine owners promised each militia company five hundred dollars, in addition to their regular pay from the state.<br>
<br>
King County deputy sheriffs arrested three black and three white Sullivan guards for shooting from the train Sunday night and precipitating the riot. The <B>News</B> editorialized on "Outraged Miners":<br>
<br>
The "boys in blue," are, therefore, being used as hired Hessians under the command of a hired corporation lawyer. The militia of the state is being used by a Republican politician as an adjunct to the Pinkerton detectives who are responsible for the murders of Sunday night.<br>
<br>
Two companies of the militia were ordered to Gilman on July 2, 1891, although there was no disturbance. About fifty more scabs arrived to work the mines, Colonel Haines claimed thirty guns for the strikers were sent to Gilman, the train station master put it at three. Haines charged the strikers had a hundred and twenty-five guns, a strike leader said sixty at the most, normal for a community where many people hunted.<br>
<br>
Although many militiamen sympathized with the strikers the <B>News</B> reporter feared that Haines might precipitate trouble so he could pose as a warrior.<br>
<br>
On July 2, Governor Elisha P. Ferry ordered the militia to "disarm all unauthorized armed bodies in Franklin, Gilman or elsewhere in King County, where there is danger of a riot or breach of the peace."
The miners responded that they wold willingly surrender their guns if scabs and Sullivans were also required to disarm. Franklin union miners were giving up and leaving the area. The remaining sixty met in the Knights of Labor hall on July 6,and ratified an agreement providing that the Sullivan guards would be disarmed, that scab miners would be disarmed except as needed for company watchmen,and that the Home Guard or Citizen's Company (Union Miners) would turn over their arms to Captain Green of the militia, to be returned when the King County sheriff directed.<br>
<br>
The pact was signed by the captain of the Home  Guard, and two committee members. Black Diamond miners, meeting in the opera house, reached a similar agreement, signed by three committee members. Newcastle miners voted not to give up their guns.<br>
<br>
In spite of their collective decision, Franklin and Black Diamond miners refused to surrender their rifles, fearing that scabs were secreting their arms. .They were skeptical of the Oregon Improvement Company claims that scabs and guards were disarmed. Two explosions at Newcastle were charged to striking mines, one damaging a scab's cabin slightly and the other a vacant house.<br>
<br>
Over a month after the equity suit against the Sullivan guards were filed, the complaint was dismissed on July 7, because the guards had already disarmed. Six militia companies were on duty by July 10 at four mines. Soldiers escorted scabs to and from the Newcastle mine.  Captain Green estimated the cost to the state for Company D at Franklin for the first ten days at ten thousand dollars and Captain Fife claimed fifteen thousand dollars would cover expenses of Tacoma company B at Gilman. Enlisted men received a dollar and a half a day and officers three dollars a day and three dollars for their horses.<br>
<br>
In an elaborate resolution, probably drafted in Seattle, the black scabs at Franklin blamed the union miners entirely for the June 28th violence and affirmed their confidence in Colonel Haines, Superintendent Corey, and King County Sheriff Woolery.<br>
<br>
L.E. Rader, editor of the <B>Montesano Democrat</B> charged that the Oregon Improvement Company planned to have two thousand blacks at work by October so they could establish state residence and vote in the November, 1892, elected for candidates friendly to mine owners.<br>
<br>
Pierce County miners feared a similar attempt to replace them with imported black scabs. In response to rumors early in July of a threatened strike at South Prairie, Sheriff Price warned that he would arrest every armed guard who was not a commissioned peace officer.<br>
<br>
When Superintendent Corey and his bodyguard when to Wilkeson on July 23rd, one hotel refused them admittance, and the other agreed to let them stay one night only.  Learning of their arrival, one hundred miners surrounded the hotel. The proprietor evicted Corey and his guard to walked to South Prairie.
By the end of July the strikes were finally broken. Many union miners left the area, and the rest returned to work open shop on the mine owner's terms.<br>

TROOP B. NATIONAL GUARD OF WASHINGTON<br>
<br>
General James M. Ashton, <B>Historical Sketch of Troop B.</B> June 1910.<br>
(excerpts).<br>
<br>
While the troop performed faithful and very arduous services during the great fires at Seattle and Spokane and during the Debs Strike, its sternest and most severe active duty was in 1891.  On July 4th of that year Troop B was ordered into the field to aid in suppressing the King County mining riots. These disturbances had become serious and the civil authorities were unable to cope with the situation.<br>
<br>
Employes and employers alike were suffering from violence at the hands of self constituted armed forces. In this connection a quotation from the adjutant general's report of 1891-92 made to Governor Ferry reads:<br>
<br>
"A number of men lost their lives in an effort to protect their property and discharge their duty as citizens, and others were wounded in endeavoring to defend their rights and maintain the supremacy of the law."<br>
<br>
And a further quotation from the same report is as follows:<br>
<br>
"The troops engaged in this service were companies, B, D and E of Seattle; C and G of Tacoma and Troop B of the first cavalry battalion..."<br>
<br>
In connection with these disturbances, the adjutant-general on September 1, 1892, again reported as follows:<br>
<br>
"No state troops have ever rendered more valuable services than those of the State of Washington in the King county mining riots. Every officer and man performed his whole duty; and, as on former occasions, were not found wanting in any particular."<br>
<br>
The other disturbances referred to were chiefly the Chinese Riots in 1886 and 1887 and in the early 1880s all of which were remembered and participated in by ...members of the troop.<br>
<br>
(This next section consists of descriptions accompanying photographs of Troop B during the disturbance.).
"...the troop...stationed at Issaquah, near Gilman, in King County, where the outbreaks were numerous and intense by reason of armed Pinkerton detectives having been unwisely thrown against the striking miners. Before the close of the campaign Troop B. disarmed every detective, and every striker and everyone else at Issaquah who was bearing arms without legal authority. This went far toward the restoration of peace, and it absolutely stopped any further destruction of life or property..."<br>
<br>
Members of Troop B are "... resting after patrol duty which they and other detachments of the troop at Coal creek, New Castle and Franklin were constantly performing, covering fifty miles of country, with great hardships to the horses as well as the men and constantly exposed to danger and attack from three warring factions.<br>
<br>
"This ws the situation until these factions commenced to acquire confidence in the militia. The strikers soon discovered that we were arresting and disarming those whom they were attacking, and that in turn we demanded that they must maintain the peace. Results were that the first and definite meeting for the restoration of order occurred in the tent of the captain of the troop on the eleventh day of the campaign.<br>
<br>
"The grievances there discussed were reported through regular channels to Governor Ferry, with recommendations for their settlement. On the fourteenth day peace and good order were restored and we returned to our homes.<br>
<br>
"Fort McDonald, manned by so called dectives, caused much intimidation and resentment when the militia arrived. Inside of forty-eight hours after the infantry took up a position at Gilman, on one side of this fort, and the troop on the other side, a surrender was had with but slight bloodshed resulting from rocks rolled  upon us and some random shots. A large number of arms and ammunition were buried for temporary safety at the headquarters of the troop.<br>
<br>
"Corporal  Bryer and two other members of the troop were seriously injured during these disturbances and Corporal Bryer, who is yet living, should be pensioned or otherwise assisted by the legislature."<br>

Newcastle is a semirural suburb of Seattle, and scme of its abandoned coal mines today serve as a "solid waste disposal site."
All that remains of Franklin, 30 miles southeast of Seattle, is scattered pieces of rusted mining equipment.  Yet in the late 19th century, Newcastle and Franklin were not only active coal-mining towns, but also the locations of violent conflict between Washington coal operators and the reform-labor organization the Knights of Labor.<br>
<br>
This strike was made more bitter by the employment of black mine workers, a common practice in the mining industry and one that con-
tributed significantly to the defeat of the Knights in western Washington.'<br>
<br>
The intense conflict between the coal operators and the mine workers had its roots in a series of related issues.  Mining itself was dirty, dangerous work in which men risked their lives daily in murky darkness sometimes a thousand feet below the earth's surface.  Poor ventilation, explosive gas, floods, and caveins were all part of the job, but such conditions did not unite company and workers in common cause, particularly since the workers often believed that the company sacrificed their safety for reduced costs.<br>
<br>
Another disadvantage for mine workers was the tremendous power the operators had over them.  Most Washington mining communities were company towns.  As an individual a worker was completely dominated by the overwhelming presence of the company.  After his 10-hour shift in the pits, a man went home to his company house or the company boardinghouse, ate food from the company store, and later drank in the company saloon where he complained to his fellow workers about high prices, rapidly accumulating debts, and the "truck system" (wages paid in store credit rather than cash).<br>
<br>
If he worked for the Oregon Improvement Company (OIC)-the leading independent operator and owner of the mines at Newcastle and Franklin-and wanted to go to Seattle, he traveled on the company railroad, the Columbia & Puget Sound.<br>
<br>
In Washington the nature of the mining industry itself also contributed to poor relations between workers and operators.<br>
<br>
Although coal played an important role in Washington's economic development in the 1880s, mining remained a highrisk and often unprofitable business.  Mining the isolated, complex beds was unusually expensive, and domestic and foreign competition for the market in Sail Francisco was stiff.<br>
<br>
Compared with nearby Vancouver Island coal and with British and Australian coal, the Washington product was mediocre.  High risks and potentially low profits made costs a keen concern of the operators.  The one cost over which they had direct control was labor, and they were not willing to share that control with workers.  Unions were to be resisted because thev increased costs
with demands for higher wages and improved working conditions, and because thev interfered with a company's right to conduct its business as it saw fit.<br>
<br>
Discontentment over their living and working conditions made mine workers receptive to the idea of organizing.  When Knights of Labor 
organizers appeared at Newcastle <B>in </B>1881, they had little trouble establishing a local assembly (or lodge as it was often called in 
Washington).  Bv 1885 the Knights were active at Franklin, <B>and </B>by 1888, largely at the initiative of the local workers, the Knights 
were represented <B>in </B>virtually all the major mining towns in western Washington.<br>
<br>
Not surprisingly the Knights were anathema to the operators.  The concerns of Knights of Labor lodges went beyond narrow economics and reflected the broad needs of their communities.  At Newcastle and Franklin the organization was the only countervailing force to the dominating OIC.  In regard to work, the Knights wanted more than higher wages: they demanded some say in the hiring and firing of employees, distribution of work assignments, and mine safety.<br>
<br>
Outside the pits they wanted some control over company housing and the operation of the company store.  At Newcastle they even demanded that the saloon be converted to a reading room, presumably to be stocked with Knights literature.  To the OIC all of these demands were a clear infringement on its right to conduct its affairs without interference from employees.<br>
<br>
Seeking to unite all workers, the Knights espoused heterogeneous political and social reform.  But in Washington the initial success of the organization was a result of its leadership in the violent anti-Chinese movement that swept across the economically depressed Pacific Northwest in late 1885 and early 1886.<br>
<br>
Though the importation of Chinese labor was prohibited by the Chinese Restriction Act of 1882, John L. Howard, OIC general manager in San Francisco, considered the smuggling of Chinese from British Columbia a "laudable business." The OIC could hire Chinese for half the wages it paid white workers.<br>
<br>
Most coal operators employed cheap Chinese labor, and in response the white mine workers became the "shock troops" of the anti-Chinese movement in Washington.  In 1885 they appeared to win a major victory.  With strikes, very effective boycotts, physical attacks on the Chinese, and widespread public support, mine workers forced the operators to fire their Chinese employees.<br>
<br>
The mine workers'victory, however, was a hollow one since it depended upon fostering divisions between different groups of workers.  The whites regarded the Chinese with fear and hatred: fear for their own economic security, and hatred of the Chinese as people and as willing tools of the operators.  No attempt was made to understand what the whites and Chinese had in common as workers. 
Moreover, after the expulsion of the Chiiiese, the OIC and other operators adamantly resisted any further demands of the Knights.<br>
<br>
Having reluctantly fired the Chinese employees at Franklin and New-
castle, Howard informed the head office in New York that the OIC would not submit again to "the dictation of a lot of demagogues and scum" his vivid description of the Knights.<br>
<br>
The Knights and the OIC remained antagonists.  Ttie company said it would offer decent conditions and a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.  The employee, as an individual, could accept or reject the offer, nothing more.  No combination or union could speak for the workers because the company recognized such groups only as beneficial societies that entertained their members and paid for their funeral expenses.<br>
<br>
To force the Knights into line the OIC used spies , lockouts, wage cuts, blacklists, and armed guards; it even covertly supported a competing union.  To the OIC's direct action the Knights        responded with strikes, boycotts, demands for recognition, and occasionally violence.  In 1886 and again in 1888-89, work at the OIC mines was disrupted for months because of disputes between the company and the Knights.<br>
<br>
Labor relations in Washington's coal industry changed significantly in 1888.  In August the Northern Pacific Coal Company, a subsidiary of the Northern Pacific Railroad, imported over 400 blacks from the Midwest to break a strike in its mines at Roslyn, 60 miles east of Seattle.  With cheap black labor the company broke the strike-and the local assembly of the Knights.  The company retained its black employees, and union labor remained a moot issue at Roslyn untit the turn of the century.<br>
<br>
In September 1888, in response to the events at Roslyn, John Howard advised the OIC office in New York to consider<br>
the employment of blacks: It would take such a new element as negroes, with whom the whites would not assimilate, to prevent anv further combinations.  The experience of the mine owners on this Coast with regard to imported white labor is that it is simply a temporary relief, and that as soon as the new element has become inoculated with the ideas of the old, (and it does not take very long to do that in this country), history repeats itself with the mine owner.<br>
<br>
After the bitter strike of 1889 the OIC officers began to debate seriously the possible use of blacks in the mines.  But they could not agree on when to bring in the blacks, nor could they decide if the company should do the hiring or use the services of a labor contractor.<br>

Uncertainty prevailed at Franklin and Newcastle until November 1890 when the OIC, saddled with $240,000 in suits and attachments, went into receivership.  With the reorganization of the company in 1891, the local officers were determined to solve their labor problems once and for all.  Charles J. Smith, general manager in Seattle, urged the new OIC executives in New York to install nonwhite labor in the mines.<br>
<br>
Widespread popular opinion prohibited the use of Chinese, so Smith recommended that the OIC bring in Negroes from the Midwest and South.  With black workers the mines would be operated more economically: blacks would accept lower wages than their white counterparts, and, Smith argued, racial animosity would keep the workers divided and eliminate the effectiveness of efforts to organize labor.<br>
<br>
Bv the spring of 1891 the OIC executives were still withholding their approval of using blacks in the mines.  Noting the reluctance in New York, T. B. Corey, OIC superintendent of mines in Seattle, implemented another plan.  He attempted to force the Newcastle miners (Franklin was closed for repairs) to sign an "Ironclad Contract" that reduced wages and set tough production quotas.<br>
<br>
Further, the contract forbade a miner to stop work, join in any "strike" or combination for the purpose of obtaining or causing the company to pay their miners an advance Of wages, or pay beyond what is specified in this contract. nor will he in any way aid, abet or countenance any "strike," combination or scheme for any purpose whatever.... And if the said second partv shall violate any of the provisions of this contract in this regard at any time, he shall therebvforfeit all claimsfor coal previousiv mined and not paid for."<br>
<br>
On March 30, 1891, the Newcastle miners unanimously rejected the contract.  The state executive board of the Knights in Seattle claimed the contract would result in the "virtual surrendering by the employes of their individuality to the company," and would create a system of bondage equal [to] if not worse than chattel slavery."<br>
<br>
The OIC withdrew the contract, and Corey appeared to have re-
signed.  Actually, he had not.  With the rejection of the contract by the Newcastle miners, OIC officers in New York finally gave their approval to use blacks in the mines, and Corey was sent to Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri to recruit black workers.<br>
<br>
In Saint Louis he distributed a handbill that read: "Wanted for the New Coal Mines in the New State of Washington! ... 500 colored coal miners and laborers for inside and outside work. ... Good wages will be paid above men.  Steady work for three years. 
No strike or trouble of any kind.  The finest country on earth."<br>
<br>
Corey had no difficulty hiring the needed workers, and on May 13, 1891, over 500 blacks, including 50 women and children, left Saint Paul, Minnesota, bound for Franklin.  The front page of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer carried a large headline on Sunday, May 17-"THE BLACK TRAIN"-and bold type reading, "Oregon Improvement Company Colonizing Its Mining Camps With Non Union Labor."<br>
<br>
Very early that morning the blacks arrived at Franklin under the protection of guards-damned "Pinkertons" by the white strikers-from Portland's Thiel Detective Agency, which had been helpful to the OIC in previous disputes.  Anticipating trouble, the guards immediately strung a barbed wire fence around the mine buildings and living quarters.<br>
<br>
Franklin's main street became a "deadline," and no unauthorized whites were permitted within the fenced compound.  The school playground, a common meeting area, was also fenced off, and 100 white and 50 black guards enforced the peace.  The next day the Franklin mines opened with all black workers, though eventually the OIC intended to have a mixed labor force at both Newcastle and Franklin.<br>
<br>
Technically, the blacks were not strikebreakers because the OIC had discharged practically all of its Franklin emplovees six months earlier when it closed the mine for repairs.  But such distinctions meant little to the white mine workers.<br>
<br>
The response of white workers to the blacks was varied.  A group of people " representing all classes of labor" met at Wilkeson in Pierce Couiitv and resolved: "That we will no longer submit to the introduction of the negro race amongst us, and that we cannot and will not recognize the negro as worthy of association with us; neither will we submit to association with them in any manner whatsoever."<br>
<br>
The mine workers at Newcastle took more direct action: they went on strike.  Almost immediately, svmpathy strikes were called at Black Diamond and Cedar Mountain.  For other reasons Gilman (now Issaquah) was already on strike, which left Franklin as the only operating mine in King County.<br>
<br>
News of the countywide strike pleased C. J. Smith, who was "working a combination with the mine owners so that none of the miners will be taken back again except on contract, and when such contracts are made all the disturbing and agitating elements will be eliminated from all the mines."<br>
<br>
Suddenly the stakes of the conflict had been raised dramatically.  Other operators had joined with the OIC, and the mine workers were gathering support for a direct confrontation.  Each side had
reached the limit of its understanding and tolerance, and each was determined to settle matters.  Caught somewhere between were the blacks at Franklin.<br>
<br>
In Seattle the executive board of the Knights quickly realized the seriousness of the situation.  To withstand the pressure of the operators, the mine workers needed wide-ranging labor support.  Hence, on May 18-the dav after the blacks arrived-the Knights arranged a meeting with the Western Central Labor Union (WCLU), a council that had originally united trade unions and Knights assemblies.<br>
<br>
The political, militant Knights had dominated the WCLU in its early period, but only that winter the had been expelled over a jurisdictional dispute by the increasingly powerful but more conservative trade unions.<br>
<br>
Considering the competition between them, the two labor groups displayed remarkable cooperation.  Thev established a joint strike committee, the purpose of which was to raise relief money for the strikers and to speak with the blacks to "see if thev could not be induced to return whence they came." No one sug-
gested that the blacks be asked to join with the white mine workers.  Although at this point the mine workers' anger was directed primarily at the OIC, the most the whites were willing to offer the blacks was the opportunity to leave unharassed as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
Organized labor formally asked C. J. Smith for permission to speak with the black workers, but he refused the request.  The Franklin deadline was meant to keep the blacks in as well as the whites out.<br>
<br>
In order to bolster morale and dramatize their cause, the Knights and the WCLU organized a huge fund-raising picnic and demonstration at Franklin on May 24, one week after the arrival of the blacks.  Over 900 people attended, including rep-
resentatives from all the surrounding mining camps.<br>
<br>
An outdoor band entertained, and local labor leaders gave rousing speeches, most of which were directed at the black workers who watched the festivities on the other side of the deadline.  The speakers urged the blacks to leave and cease defending corporate tyranny.  Two Seattle Knights, neither of whom was a mine worker, even offered to help organize the blacks.<br>
<br>
Their sentiments, however, were not expressed in the resolution passed at the end of the day.<br>
<br>
"We the miners and mine laborers of King and Pierce Counties in

the state of Washington.. do protest against the <B>in</B>human <B>action 
</B>of the Oregon Improvement Company in importing cheap colored labor to take the place of honest white labor." Hostility to the blacks had been temporarily repressed while the strikers concentrated on their employers, but the hostility was not far below the surface.<br>
<br>
The striking mine workers saw the black " strikebreakers" as naive corporate pawns collected from the slums of America.  But they also assumed that once the blacks learned how mining labor relations were conducted, they would realize how they were being used by the company and leave.  These were mistaken assumptions.<br>
<br>
Who were these black workers? Contrary to white belief, most were not urban slum dwellers ignorant of mining labor disputes.  Granted, about 100 were from Saint Louis, and these men were probably unfamiliar with the mining industry.  Yet another 100 came from Braidwood, Illinois, where T. B. Corey had broken a strike in 1877 with the use of black labor.<br>
<br>
Corey claimed that many of the blacks from Braidwood were "my old men." At least another 100 blacks were experienced mine workers from Moberly, Missouri.  The rest came from small towns in the South and Midwest.  One of "Corey's men" from Braidwood stated that of the 500 blacks who came to Franklin, at least 300 were experienced mine workers.<br>
<br>
For the most part then, the blacks at Franklin were familiar with the actions of white operators and workers.  Many of the blacks knew each other and had worked together before.  They had their leaders, their aid societies, and a collective experience.  Some of the blacks even brought their wives and children; they intended to be at Franklin for some time, perhaps permanently.  In short, the blacks knew why they were there, and they planned to stay.<br>
<br>
It is true that Corey lied to the blacks when he told them there was no trouble at the mines.  But by June 1 only about 75 of the blacks had broken their contract with the OIC and decided to leave.  A number of those who departed felt cheated, having believed that no labor disputes existed at Franklin, Many who left simply did not want to be involved in any trouble; one anonymous miner said, "I don't know much about who is right.  Perhaps they are both right, but they've all got guns and a dead nigger gets awfully cold.  "<br>
<br>
Once the blacks were at Franklin it was not easy for them to leave.  Most were quite poor, and they were in debt to the OIC for their train fare west.  Moreover, the OIC guards watched the
blacks carefully to prevent escape.  It appears, however, that 
most who did leave were those who had no previous <B>mining 
</B>experience.  The experienced black mine workers knew why they were there, and the vast majority of them chose to remain.<br>
<br>
Why were the blacks willing to remain at Franklin? Part of the reason was economic self-interest.  They were trying to earn a living, support their families, and live a respectable life in a society that did its best to perpetuate their former status as slaves.  Their opportunities were limited, and they had to take advantage of those that were available.<br>
<br>
Charles H. Johnson, a vocal black miner, clearly understood his lot when he wrote the editor of the PI "We are aware that prejudice is against us here; but where can we go? It is against us everywhere.... Let them call us scabs if they want to.  We have concluded that half a loaf is better than none.  "<br>
<br>
The black mine workers also received encouragement from the leaders of Seattle's tiny black community.  With the blessing of the OIC, the Reverend Hesekiah C. Rice established the Committee of Colored Citizens to aid the blaC'Ks ai Franklin.  Rice appealed to racial pride to inspire the black workers:<br>
<br>
The only way we [blacks] con get employment as workingmen in the North is to go in a great crowd to a place and take possession of it as we have done here.  But we don't want to drive the white men out [of] here.  We are willing to work side by side with them, but we claim our rights as American citizens to go where we please and work at ony trade we please.<br>
<br>
The Reverend L. S. Blakeney made an even more pointed appeal:<br>
<br>
The Oregon Improvement company is your friend.. stay with them and thev will stay with you.  You all understood that you were to Pay back the money advanced as fare and as honorable men I counsel you to remain and work out the debt.... Let one colored man do no unworthy action and his whole race is blamed -for it."'<br>
<br>
The conservative black minister proved to be quite influential.  On May 24, while the band entertained the whites at their picnic, the black workers held a meeting.  After listening first to the whites and then to Rice and his fellow committee members, they agreed that<br>
<br>
we came here to stay, and will use all lawful means to accomplish said end.  In coming tO Franklin we have exercised the right of every American citizen.... [W]e expect to enjoy all the rights and immunities guaranteed to all true patriotic American citizens. and as such we deem it our right and privilege to
remain not only in Franklin but in any other locality within the jurisdiction of the United States.<br>
<br>
The black workers at Franklin were not ignorant tools of the OIC.  For reasons of economic self-interest and racial pride they chose to remain and ally themselves with the OIC against the white strikers.  They were not so different from black mine workers in other areas of the country.<br>
<br>
Richard L. Davis, a black Virginian who mined coal in Ohio and in later years served on the United Mine Workers board, aptly described the awkward position in which blacks found themselves:<br>
<br>
Now, if there is anything that I do despise it is a blackleg [strikebreaker], but in places in this country that they will not allow the negro to work simply because of his black skin, then I sav boldly that he is not a blackleg in taking your places.  He is only doing his plain duty in taking chances with the world.  We ask no one to give us anything.  All we want is the chance to work and I we assure you we want just as much wages as the whites.<br>
<br>

<B>In </B>terms of worker solidarity one might question the wisdom of such beliefs, but the key point about the blacks at Franklin is that they made rational decisions within the framework of limited options that were available to them.<br>
<br>
In the end labor solidarity had little meaning for the whites either.  The demonstration of May 24 was the peak of resistance to the OIC.  The negative response of the black workers was both a practical and a psychological setback for the white strikers.  Racial animosity skyrocketed, and labor groups began to quarrel among themselves.  The Knights and the WCLU renewed their squabbles over jurisdiction.<br>
<br>
The WCLU told the Knights that it would coordinate all strike action or withdraw its support.  It wanted all workers, except those at Franklin and Newcastle, to return to work because they had no justifiable dispute with their employers; it believed that public support could be gained from the workers' show of good faith toward their employers.  The Knights balked at this idea, arguing that all mine workers had to stand together against the operators and against the blacks.<br>
<br>
In order to make their intentions clear, a group of mine workers met at Cedar Mountain on June 13 and declared "that we, the miners and mine laborers of King county, hereby agree to let the coal companies of the county to have their choice of either employing all white miners or all colored men, and we will not return to work unless all white miners are employed.<br>
<br>
The next day a reporter found Corey writing "Approved.  T. B.
Corey, superintendent of mines, Oregon Improvement Company" on the union notices ordering all strikers away from the mines.  Asked why he was in such a puckish mood, Corey replied that labor was playing into the operators' hands.<br>
<br>
The demand by the strikers for all black or all white miners "made the issue one of race between the white and colored miners, and not one of wages or conditions of work between the coal companies and their emploves.,, Corey's analysis was correct.  The mine workers vented their hostility on the blacks, and their attacks on the company became less strident.<br>
<br>
The coal operators were left in the enviable position of watching various groups of workersblack mine workers, white mine workers,   trade unionists-quarreling among themselves.  Worker resistance to the operators had quickly fragmented.<br>
<br>
Toward the end of June the strikers started to drift back to the mines.  On June 28 the OIC began transferring black workers from Franklin to Newcastle, which resulted in violence.  A small scuffle at Franklin between black miners and striking whites flared into a shoot-out in which over 1,000 rounds were exchanged.  When the smoke cleared, two people were dead and four seriously injured.<br>
<br>
Governor Elisha Ferry acceded to the deputy sheriff's call for the National Guard; for nearly a month the militia enforced a tense peace at the mining camps, while more and more strikers gave up and either returned to work or left the state.<br>
<br>
Though the mines remained quiet, there was no cooperation between blacks and whites.  On Independence Day a member of a "committee of citizens" in support of labor said of the blacks: "You take 500, or 600 niggers, put firearms in their hands and they will not only menace the peace, but [also] the purity of the mothers and daughters." The P-I soberly reported that "race animosity has reached such a point that the negroes regard any white man as an enemy until they know him, and negroes traveling on the road who have nothing to do with the quarrel have had to prove their identity to escape abuse."<br>
<br>
Despite such hostility C. J. Smith announced the end of the strike in late July.  In all the mining towns the returning strikers were forced to sign Ironclad Contracts, which reduced wages and forbade them to strike or join any combination."<br>
<br>
Resistance to the operators dragged on through 1891.  On September 5 the mine workers met at Cedar Mountain and voted to stay out.  Though still quarreling with the Knights, the WCLU helped to organize a boycott of "scab" coal, continued to raise money for the strikers, and even sent a representative to the Tacoma Trades Council to explain the situation and ask for assistance.<br>

But by November it was obvious that the mines were operating very smoothly without the strikers, and the boycott was a failure.  The operators had indeed won.<br>
<br>
Though the Knights in eastern Washington remained very active in reform politics until 1900, the mining assemblies in western Washington were fatally wounded in the strike of 1891, and the@ succumbed in the panic of 1893.  In that year many former Knights joined the new Western Federation of Miners (WFM) in Montana.  As individuals the refugee Knights were welcome at the organizational meeting of the WFM, but the last struggling assemblies were not invited to attend because they had agreed to wage scales that were too low.<br>
<br>
In 1894 labor strife again rocked the Pacific Northwest, but the coal mines, except for a very brief strike at Roslyn, remained quiet.  The OIC, in fact all the operators, continued to reap the benefits of the previous victory, and C. J. Smith proudly exclaimed, " our force is the only bulwark against a general Miners['] strike in Washington." Not until 1901 did another coal-mining union appear in Washington.<br>
<br>
Under the auspices of the OIC, Washington coal operators managed to suppress union activity for a decade, but the OIC itself enjoyed such benefits for only a few years.  On October 4, 1895, the com-
pany went into receivership for the second and final time.  Smith, who was appointed receiver, tried without success to save the company.  The OIC was not able to reorganize, and it ceased to exist when it was purchased by the Pacific Coast Company in 1896.<br>
<br>
The demise of the OIC and the collapse of the Knights of Labor in western Washington had little direct significance outside the state; even within Washington the economic concerns of most people<br>
were tied to the lumber industry, not coal mining.  But the defeat of the Knights has important implications, for it was symptomatic of serious problems within organized labor.<br>
<br>
In the national mining industry using blacks as low-paid regular employees and as strikebreakers was a tradition among operators.  Completion of the transcontinental railroads and development of a truly national transportation system after the Civil War aided emoloyers in restructuring their local work force with "aliens" to make it more efficient or docile.<br>
<br>
In the early 1870s imported black workers broke strikes in Illinois, Indiana , and Ohio.  In late 1874 Ohio coal operators brought several hundred blacks from the South when a strike was called by the Hocking Valley Miners'National Association (MNA).  Under the protection of armed guards the blacks broke the strike in a few weeks, and the MNA, one of the earliest "national" mining
unions, collapsed.<br>
<br>
As race relations deteriorated in the latter part of the century, employers often hired blacks and mixed them with different ethnic groups to fragment the labor force.  During the 1880s and 1890s this was a common practice in Pennsylvania, where thousands of East Europeans worked under contract in the mines.  Successful mixing of blacks, Hungarians, Italians, and white Americans kept the workers divided and quarreling among themselves.  Racial and ethnic animosity superseded any notions of class consciousness.<br>
<br>
West of the Mississippi blacks were almost unknown prior to 1900.  In Washington at the turn of the century, for example, they constituted less than 1 percent of the population.  Yet their pres-
ence, even the possibility of their presence, elicited much hostility from white residents.  Despised as a race, blacks were feared because they raised the threats of economic competition and miscegenation.<br>
<br>
Consequently, in the developing labor movement after the Civil War, there was little interracial cooperation.  Even the Knights, who embraced the ideal of organizing all workers, made little attempt to organize the few blacks in the West because white workers refused to have anything to do with them.  Prejudice overwhelmed anv notions of labor solidarity.<br>
<br>
In the OIC mines the Knights of Labor played into the hands of the employers.  Although they spoke of the common bonds that united all workers, Knights too often practiced the virulent racism so common in the United States.  Using a mixed labor force, the OIC was able to fragment the workers and thwart organized labor.<br>
<br>
One could argue that the Knights were shortsighted, but they merely reflected the dominant values of their culture.  More important, they were not debating race relations; they were defending their jobs and homes in a highly irregular industry.  To them the blacks were not fellow workers but tools of corporations bent on lowering wages and eliminating unions.  Ironically, the presence of the blacks did briefly unify the white workers, but the foundation of that unity-racial animosity-helped bring about their defeat.<br>

STRIKE OF 1891.<br>
<br>
"Miners are furious," <B>The Daily Ledger.</B> May 17, 1891.<br>
<br>
Miners Are Furious<br>
Corey's Black Recruits Intended for Franklin<br>
Serious Trouble Expected<br>
A Large Force of Pinkertons and United States Marshalls<br>
at the Scene Special to the Ledger<br>
<br>
SEATTLE, May 16.--At 1 o'clock this morning 400 negro miners with their families, making in all 600, will step off a Northern Pacific train at Stone siding, a station without a single house, about two miles this side of Palmer.<br>
<br>
They will be immediately marched across a mountain trail into the mining camp of Franklin, where they will be put in possession of houses and tents owned by the Oregon Improvement company, and will be guarded by Pinkertons, who will keep the white miners off if they attempt violence.<br>
<br>
These negroes were recruited at Hannibal, Mo., by T.B. Corey, superintendent of the mines, and have been brought here secretly to take the places of white miners with whom the company has had a great deal of trouble.  About six weeks ago Superintendent Corey attempted to force an obnoxious contract on the miners employed in the mines, and a strike was the result.<br>
<br>
The company then withdrew the contract and Corey resigned, ostensibly for the purpose of going east to take a railroad position.  He was very unpopular with the miners, and they rejoiced over his resignation, which they considered a removal forced on the company by their strike.  A new superintendent named Williams was appointed and the men returned to work on the old terms.<br>
<br>
About two weeks ago, dispatches from H.... stated that Corey was there securing laborers, and distrust was aroused, but their fears were afterwards allayed by the announcement that Corey had taken the position of superintendent on a Georgia road.  While the miners were thus secure, Corey was getting his negro gang together in Missouri.<br>
<br>
He took them quietly to St. Paul where they were put on a special train and rushed through. This morning the Ledger and Seattle papers received a dispatch from Helena saying 600 colored people had passed through for Seattle mines.  Then the excitement became intense in labor circles.  Delegations were rushed to every mining camp in King County to warn the miners.  As soon as the news reached Newcastle, the miners there went out, refusing to work
longer for the company.<br>
<br>
The Knights of Labor held a meeting tonight, but refused to disclose what was done.  No one appeared to know where the negroes were taken until late tonight, when it was made known that Franklin was their objective point.  As matters now stand every mine of the company is closed down.<br>
<br>
At Franklin there is intense excitement and very bitter feeling.  An effort is being made by conservative men to hold the hotheads back, but it is thought that there will be serious trouble.  Committees will first endeavor to persuade the negroes to refuse to go to work, and if they fail they may in desperation take most desperate measures.<br>
<br>
Manager C.J. Smith, when seen tonight, said that the Oregon Improvement company had determined to rid themselves of the necessity of having to submit to every caprice of the labor unions, that the negroes would be put to work in the mines and would be protected there if it took more guards than there are miners to do so.<br>
<br>
Detective C. M. Sullivan now has a large force of Pinkertons at Palmer and will march them to Franklin with the negroes.  Deputy sheriffs and United States marshalls are also said to be there.<br>

Corey and Recruits Arrive at Franklin Mines<br>
Not a White Man in Sight<br>
Greeted Only by Women With Derisive Shouts-<br>
Dead Line Established<br>
Special to the Ledger<br>
<br>
SEATTLE, May 17, - A special to the "Post-Intelligencer" from Franklin says:  Daylight had just spread from the mountains over the country when the special train bearing the negro army rolled into the depot at Palmer.  It was 2:50 o'clock and the town was asleep.<br>
<br>
Even the four guards at the depot had fallen into a doze, but the thunder of the train soon awakened them, and they started up and hurried to board the cars.  Every platform was guarded by stalwart men from Sullivan's agency, with Winchester rifles over their shoulders and cartridge belts around their waists, and all
strangers were strictly excluded.<br>
<br>
There were ten tourist sleepers, a baggage car and caboose.  Black heads, with every variety of covering known to America, peeped out of the windows, with a sprinkling of women and pickaninnies whose bead-like eyes gazed curiously on the strange scene.<br>
<br>
Superintendent Corey was one of the first to jump off, and he seemed exultant that his long and laborious task was so nearly ended.  He was met at the station by Superintendent Bush, who had come to Enumclaw with a force of seventy-five guards, under command of Sullivan himself.<br>
<br>
The train only remained here five minutes and then went on to the siding at the stone quarry, two and one-half miles below, where it was side-tracked.  Then the army which Corey had recruited poured out of the cars to see the far country to which it had come.<br>
<br>
It is composed of 675 negroes, including about forty women and children.  The men are nearly all young, sturdy fellows, and there is a good sprinkling of well-grown boys.  They were served with a substantial breakfast on the cars.  Then came the distribution of guns and cartridges, and every negro was clamoring for a gun.<br>
<br>
The guards were all armed with good Winchesters, but the negroes had to be content with old-fashioned carbines of antebellum days.  They took them gladly, however, and many were the exclamations which they gave vent to as to their intentions to any one who should assail them, and references to "white trash"  were frequent.<br>
<br>
Many of the men had arms of their own, for bright, new revolvers stuck out of their pockets, and some had handsome rifles or shotguns.  After over an hour's delay in preparing for the start the men were formed in line on the road, the white guards in the van and the motley array of negroes strung out behind in a long ragged line.<br>
<br>
At last the order was given to march, and the procession started at a swinging pace into the woods, every man carrying his gun over his shoulder, the few who had none keeping close in the rear of the guards.  The scene was an unaccustomed one to the negroes, who were only familiar with the prairies of Illinois and Kansas, the rolling plains of the Missouri or the everglades of the south.<br>
<br>
They knew they were coming into a town where the population was bitterly hostile to them, and they imagined that Indians would be lurking in the brush to pick them off.  The forest possessed for them all the imaginary terrors of the unknown, and they peered nervously into the recesses of the matted brush in search of a skulking enemy.<br>
<br>
One old negro said, with an attempt at a laugh:  "Where's dem Injuns!"  They were reassured by their guards, and as they went
along an saw no rifle pointed at them, and no eyes glaring at them from among the branches, their fears were finally dispelled.  No sound broke the stillness except their own voices and footfalls and the distant roar of the Green river dashing through its rocky chasm.<br>
<br>
Mr. Corey had been firing their expectations with remarks on the beauties of the land, the fine fishing and hunting to be had and all the other pleasures they would enjoy, and as they came in sight of their destined home he exclaimed, pointing to the steep slope before them:  "Boys, there's the happy land" and the foremost gazed for a moment at the scene in silent joy at having finally come into view of the far distant home.<br>
<br>
The word went down the line:  "That's the happy land!" and all paused to look upon it.  It was only one end of Franklin that they saw, and as they descended the hill, making one sharp turn after another, it was revealed to them by degrees, the whole mountain side unfolding before them like a panorama.<br>
<br>
As they turned the second bend in the road from the hill top, a report of a rifle shot sounded from the valley, and was taken as a signal to the miners that the invaders were in sight;  but when the procession reached the cluster of houses not a person was visible, and then the party finally arrived at the company's stores, they had only been accosted by a few women, who derisively called out:  "Look at Corey's black slaves!"  They were at once installed in tents and the company's houses and provided with provisions.<br>
<br>
A dead line has been drawn along both sides of the county road so that the people are not allowed to step more than eight feet off it.  The children have been debarred from using the play ground, for a fence has been built up to the school house door, and the scholars only have an alley six feet wide through which to pass to the school house.  At a meeting of citizens this evening on the flats, called by the music of the brass band, about 200 to 225 persons were present, thirty of forty being negroes.<br>
<br>
It is said by those who conducted the meeting that all the negroes present stated that they had been brought here under false pretenses and intended to leave in the morning without accepting aid from the white men.  Eight of the party who came all of the way by rail with the women and children were said to have deserted at Black River Junction.<br>
<br>
Resolutions were passed denouncing the action of Corey in bringing the negroes under an armed guard and appealing to Governor Ferry to enforce the provision of the constitution which forbids the assembling of bodies of armed men.  Sheriff Woolery was appealed to come up and see that the law was enforced in regard to the employment of guards.<br>
<br>
Mr. McAlpine said, "Some of the guards have been in the town six weeks watching the actions of the miners and trying to learn their
proceedings.  They were recognized among the body which marched into town this morning.  I wish you would state that the two saloons in town were closed by request of the citizens the moment the negroes arrived.<br>
<br>
"Some of the negroes tell me that they were told when they were hired that there were only three houses in the town and that the mine was a new one, but that they needed guns because there were Italians in the camp and Indians in the woods."<br>
<br>
A special to the "Post-Intelligencer" from Franklin, at 1 a.m. says:  Everything is quiet.  Guards are patrolling the deadline but nearly all the white miners have gone to their homes.  They do not make any threats and are using endeavors to proselyte the colored men, some of whom have already deserted the company, although the majority stand firm.<br>

<br>
Special to the Ledger,  Seattle, May 19 - A special to the "Post-
Intelligencer," from the Franklin mines, says that everything is quiet there , although the dead line guarded by Pinkertons is still maintained.  The white miners are showing signs of yielding.<br>
<br>
Several families left town today, selling their shanties, which were built on the company's property, to the company, which puts negroes in possession at once.<br>
<br>
An increased force of negroes was put to work this morning and more will be put in tomorrow.  A party of white miners went to the house of J.L. Fry, the white engineer, of the hoisting engine who refused to quit work and  assailed his wife verbally, so that she had to have refuge with her husband in the engine house.<br>
<br>
At Newcastle, the other camp of the Oregon Improvement company, feeling runs very high because few men have stayed at work at the pumps and engines.  Between twenty and thirty shots were fired at a special at 9:30 last night while it was making the run from Coal
creek to Newcastle, a distance of two miles.  Sheriff Woolrey and Deputy McDonald were on the engine and several bullets whistled past their faces but no one was hit.<br>

SEATTLE POST INTELLIGENCER STRIKE OF 1936.<br>
<br>
William E. Ames and Roger A. Simpson, <B>Unionism or Hearst. The Seattle Post Intelligencer Strike of 1936.</B> Seattle: Pacific Northwest Labor History Association, 1978. p. xv-xviii.<br>
<br>

<B>INTRODUCTION</B><br>
<br>
The often-turbulent labor history of the state of Washington has been treated in a very large number of books and articles, as well as many theses and dissertations.  These have been made possible by the collection of manuscripts and ephemera, as well as the development of oral history projects, particularly at the University of Washington.<br>
<br>
A very useful guide to these writings - and to much more as well is 
Jonathan Dembo, <B>An Historical Bibliography of Washington</B> <B>State Labor 
and Laboring Classes </B>(Seattle, 1978).  Dembo's study was supported by grants from the Washington State Labor Council and the Pacific Northwest Labor History Association.<br>
<br>
I think it is fair to say that few of these works are definitive, due at least as much to the uneven quality (and "coverage") of the sources as to any inherent limitations in the authors.  But, in history, what is definitive, anyhow? Those who engage in this sort of work are well aware that they are often pioneers, collecting as they go along, and this they find rewarding in itself.<br>
<br>
The Pacific Northwest Labor History Association, whose annual spring meetings provide an important forum for papers, panels and reminiscences, now enters the publishing field.  It does so with a lively and colorful book on the Seattle Post-Intelligencer strike of 1936, Unionism or Hearst.<br>
<br>
The authors are faculty members of the School of Communications of the University of Washington, where they are identified with the continuing scholarship in journahsm history.  They and their students have done much to enlighten all of us interested in Pacific Northwest history.<br>
<br>
You will not read far in this book until you discover that it is labor-oriented.  This may or may not bother you, but there is not much that you, or the authors, can do about it.  BRI Ames and Roger Simpson are sympathetic with the aspirations of the new American Newspaper Guild drd most of their documentation comes from the labor side.<br>
<br>
They have repeatedly sought, without success, to get access to the employer records.  The William Randolph Hearst Collection, still being assembled at the Bancroft Library of the University of California in Berkeley, is not yet arranged, let alone available for
research.<br>
<br>
So read this book for what it is - a valuable account, from the labor side, of one of the great organizational struggles of the 1930s.  You will, incidentally, discover that it is enlightening about a major episode in the career of that most fascinating of Pacific Northwest labor leaders, Dave Beck.<br>
<br>
I welcome the publication of Unionism or Hearst as the first of what we hope will be a long series of monographs to be published by PNLHA.<br>

PREFACE<br>
<br>
Seattle in the mid-1930s was a restless city.  It felt sharply the grip of the nationwide depression which many thought might bring the great American experiment in democracy to an end.  Chaotic economic conditions left millions unemployed and millions more with tenuous holds on their jobs.  Nearly all who were employed had seen their pay checks cut severely, and employees daffy faced the possibility of losing their jobs.<br>
<br>
Such threats proved a boon to labor organizing.  Under the administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt there seemed little doubt that the legality of labor unions and the right of collective bargaining would be settled.<br>
<br>
Business watched the rise of labor with alarm and stoutly resisted such new legislation as the National Industrial Recovery Act and the National Labor Relations Act, both of which helped secure the position of the unions.  The near collapse of the American economy in the early 1930s left both labor and management insecure and fearful of the future.<br>
<br>
The revolution through which the economy passed helped to widen the breach which separated management and labor, even though it aided greatly in defining the role each would play in the future development of the nation.<br>
<br>
The worker revolution in the Soviet Union had provided management with an alarming portent of what could happen in the United States.  The instability of the American economy in the 1930s did much to accent the fears.  Throughout the country trade unionism was on the rise.  Millions signed union cards, hoping for some measure of
security in both jobs and wages.  Many workers, who in the 1920s had considered unionism radical, now were finding the movement acceptable.<br>
<br>
Radicals within the labor movement were labeling William Green and his crafts-union alliance, the American Federation of Labor, backward in philosophy and out of step with the modern trends.  Some argued4hat labor, in order to be effective, could not confine itself to narrow crafts and expect to use the strike as an effective weapon.<br>
<br>
John L. Lewis argued for union organization along industrywide lines, and in the eyes of the business world this posed the most serious labor threat.  To many Americans, Lewis's Committee for Industrial Organization was somehow assmilated with communism, and many even thought the "C" in the initials stood for the Marxian philosophy.<br>
<br>
Advocates of new, philosophies active within the labor movement were widening their membership base.  Whitecollar workers, who only a few years before would have been unwelcome in the labor movement, now were organizing and becoming recognized as having common interests with the blue-collar elements.  College-educated workers were finding they shared interests with those who had fought their ways upward in the ranks of labor.  To many of the radicals within the labor movement, the eventual triumph of the working<br>
man was not far away.<br>
<br>
The Seattle labor scene, always a turbulent one, boldly illustrated these conflicts.  Stan dominant on the Seattle scene was the Central Labor Council.  The Council moved from the center of labor radicalism following World War I to a conservative position dominated by the crafts unions.<br>
<br>
At the hub of the conservative element was the powerful Teamsters Union, presided over by a former laundry truck driver who had strongarmed his way to the most powerful position in Seattle labor.  No move was made by the Central Labor Council without the support of Dave Beck and his Teamsters Union.<br>
<br>
But Seattle was not without its radical element, centered largely along the waterfront where Harry Bridges's Longshoremen were posed as a threat to the complete dominance of Beck and his Teamsters.<br>
<br>
These two elements symbolized the rising ferment within the entire labor movement, which in 1935 saw ten industrial unions break with their crafts' counterparts in the AFL to form the Committee for Industrial Organization.  Both Teamster and Longshore strikes had been long and turbulent, and in the mid-thirties both continued to wage a battle to dominate the warehouse union and to control the
link between water and land transportation.<br>
<br>
This intralabor fight was used effectively by anti-union forces to demonstrate the violence which was fostered by anions and to point up the revolutionary nature of labor's fight for dominance.  To many businessmen, the rise of labor posed a threat to the entire business function of the country.<br>
<br>
The threat in Seattle seemed more serious to some citizens who had lived through the turbulent days following World War I. Seattle was a center for the militant unionism of the Industrial Workers of the World (Wobblies), the scene of the first city-wide general strike, and had been strongly affected by the two so-called massacres near Seattle involving the Wobblies - at Everett and at Centralia.<br>
<br>
All these conditions made large elements of society fearful of the rising power of labor, and many felt that labor unions were unamerican and tied to foreign ideologies.  The Franklin Roosevelt administration which had helped win labor a firm place within society was damned by much of the business world.  Newspaper publishers had balked at such supposed threats of labor, communism, socialism, and the federal government.<br>
<br>
None of the publishers had been more active in red-baiting and witch-hunting than William Randolph Hearst, probably the most famous American newspaper figure of the time and owner of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.  Hearst's anti-labor, anti-Roosevelt tirades had won him the scorn of much of the labor movement, as well as the vast majority of the nation's voters who favored the Roosevelt New Deal.<br>
<br>
Within this Seattle setting, the attempt of fewer than thirty-five newspaper employees to organize and secure recognition for a chapter of the American Newspaper Guild would bring all these forces together in a three-and-one half month struggle which was to have nationwide importance.<br>
<br>
Such a foolhardy effort should have won only martyrdom for its organizers, but forces working within the labor scene on both the national and Seattle levels, the personal ambitions of a Seattle labor leader, and the ineptness of business management gave the fledgling American Newspaper Guild its first major victory against Hearst.<br>
<br>
It was a victory against the most outspoken critic of the Guild.  Only two months before the strike, national Guild officers were certain Hearst never would recognize the Guild until he faced a nationwide strike on all his papers.  This would take years to organize.  Yet the pitifully weak Seattle chapter accomplished the task fewer than seven gonths after its organization.
That it was a victory that paled by comparison with later Guild battles in the United States and Canada does not detract from its roles at that time in inspiring newspaper employees, spurring growth in the Gund and fostering whitecollar militancy. . The Guild victory in Seattle was the first agreement with Hearst that directly recognized the union.<br>
<br>
While the Seattle strike was in progress, a Guild strike against Hearst's Wisconsin News in Milwaukee had been settled, but without ihe essential acknowledgment of the Guild.  Seattle and Milwaukee, however, were only the first battles in a long war with Hearst, a bitter fight that erupted in b loody dimensions in a 508-day strike that ended on Hearst's two Chicago newspapers in 1940.<br>
<br>
The Post-Intelligencer strike also is important for the opportunity it afforded Dave Beck, boss of the Teamsters Union in the West, to assume even greater power within the region and over Seattle's newspapers.  While the Guild gained recognition, Beck gained a pinnacle of power which was to go unchallenged for twenty years - a power which made it unhealthy for the newspapers to speak out against his dominance.<br>
<br>
It was a strange union of Beck and the Newspaper Guild in 1936.  Without Beck's support the strike never would have been called and certainly never would have been a success.  Yet for only a few days after the opening of the strike was there a feeling of cooperation between the Guild and Beck.  Then each pursued quite different objectives.<br>
<br>
This book is a history of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer strike of 1936.  In that strike, the Guild, born in Washington, D.C., in 1933, came of age in Seattle in 1936.  Beck and Hearst each shaped that outcome.<br>

THE SEATTLE STAR STRIKE OF 1937.<br>
<br>
William E. Ames and Roger A. Simpson, "The Seattle Star Strike," <B>Unionism or Hearst.</B> Seattle: Pacific Northwest Labor Association, 1978 p. 144-148.<br>
<br>
The Guild's move from the AFL to the insurgent CIO was responsible for the Seattle unit finding itself in its second major strike within a year, when a picket line was thrown around the Seattle Star on July 3, 1937.<br>
<br>
The resentment growing out of the AFL executive committee's attempt to force settlement of the Post-Intelligencer strike had caused bitterness toward AFL unions on the part of the Guild, and the following June, Heywood Broun led his union into the more radical CIO.  There were other sound reasons for the move, for now the Guild was placed on an industrial rather than the crafts basis which had characterized the AFL.<br>
<br>
As members of the CIO, the Guild's members found themselves more isolated than ever in Seattle.  They had to face not only the anti-union men, but also the united force of all labor which stayed within the AFL.<br>
<br>
The Longshoremen provided the one important source of strength for the Guild, but arrayed against them was the impressive strength commanded by their former ally, Dave Beck and his Teamsters.  Within days after the 1937 Guild convention had voted to join the CIO and
broaden the bae of its membership, Beck moved to counter the new potential strength of the Guild and to block out new recruiting areas for himself.<br>
<br>
The Star strike was a messy situation for the Guild, for as a national Guild representative termed it, this strike has just about every bad feature it is possible to imagine.<br>
<br>
Where the dominant factor about the closing of the PostIntelligencer was the unity of the labor front, the very essence of the strike against the Star was the division which had taken place in labor.<br>
<br>
These two factions much more than labor and management brought the picket line around the Seattle Star.  Whereas Beck and his Teamsters had been important components of the line around the Post-IntelU-
gencer, now they were the reason for the picket line.<br>
<br>
The act which triggered the strike took place on July 2 when Star management called a meeting of nineteen district circulation managers and introduced a Teamster spokesman, Lew Shaw.  Shaw generally was regarded as one of Dave Beck's boys and was suspected by many of being responsible for the harrassment of some of the rank and file of the newsboys' unions which attempted to operate in Seattle during the spring of 1937.<br>
<br>
As the meeting opened, Shaw told the managers present that they would have to join the Teamsters union.  All were members of the Newspaper Guild.  These circulation managers did no delivery work themselves, but they did have employees working under them who used delivery vehicles.  Shaw cited a 1911 executive couneff order of the AFL which granted the Teamsters jurisdiction over circulation employees.<br>
<br>
The Star circulation managers refused to change their labor affiliation.  The Star management faced the problem of getting their newspapers delivered.  As a result of the circulation managers' vote, the Teamsters employed in delivery walked off the job, and the nineteen Guild circulation workers were asked if they could guarantee delivery.<br>
<br>
Knowing what the reaction of the Teamsters would be to any such invasion of the truck drivers' responsibilities, the, Guildsmen replied they could not.  The Teamsters then were asked the same question and, of course, replied that they could guarantee delivery.  Forthwith the Gufldsmen were fired and replaced by members of the Teamsters union, and the second major Guild strike in Seattle was under way.<br>
<br>
This strike, which lasted from July 3, 1937, until February 5, 1938,
was the longest Guild strike to that time and brought none of the fruits of victory which had accompanied the Post-Intelligencer strike.  A strong picket line which closed the Star was broken completely a few days later when Mayor John Dore ordered the police to break the picket line, guaranteed safe passage to the Star employees, and the newspaper was published without a missed edition.<br>
<br>
Although many Guild participants in the Star strike were the veterans who a year before had fought with such enthusiasm against Hearst, now these Gufldsmen seemed to have lost something.  During the important opening days of the Post-Intelligencer strike, this desperate group of men and women was convinced they had sealed their doom as far as ever being employed on a newspaper again was concerned.<br>
<br>
They had had little to lose by the strike, and their main aim was not necessary to help the American Newspaper Guild but to hurt Hearst.  This they had succeeded in doing.  They had won the strike, and the effort had won national acclaim as a great boost to the American Newspaper Guild.<br>
<br>
But, in a way, it was a hollow victory.  It had taken months to have Lynch reinstated on the newspaper, and Armstrong had died before the reinstatement.  At times, the Guild was powerless to help its martyrs, and some wondered what the strike had been all about.<br>
<br>
Certainly it had not won any great position for the Guild as far as the Post-Intelligencer was concerned.  In addition to those who were discouraged, more were just simply tired.  Cliffe Erickson, Dick Seller, Fritzi Swanstrom, Lynch, and others continued to devote much of their extra time to the Guild.<br>
<br>
The debris from the strike was plentiful, and the financial situation was particularly vexing.  The nearly $3,000 in back debts which remained from the Post Intelligencer strike was a great detriment to those who attempted to mount the Guild effort against the Star.  There were stories by Forrest Williams, Erickson, and others that the creditors of the PostIntelligencer strike planned to sue the individualsinvolved.<br>
<br>
Despite this, the Guild members were dediated and probably in no city in the United States did the orpnization receive a greater payment of loyalty than in Seattle during the years 1936 and 1937.  But the enthusiasm which characterized the strike in 1936 was quite different a year later.  Naive enthusiasm can be given to a cause only once.  The Guild members had learned.<br>
<br>
The leader of the strike apin was Dick Seller, and for seven months he led the battle as the National Labor Relations Board and the
courts determined jurisdiction over the circulation managers.  The Guild battled to cut into the circulation and the advertising of the Star, and in a very real sense this action eventually killed the newspaper, for it never was fully able to recover from the advertising and circulation losses which the strike caused.<br>
<br>
The strike ended practically where it had begun, with both the Teamsters and the Guild represented in the circulation department.  The Guild took satisfaction in proving that it could stop Dave Beck from inhinging on its organizing province.<br>
<br>
There was something admirable, however, about the Newspaper Guild which within eighteen months had, with various degrees of success, conducted two major strikes aping newspapers in Seattle.  One it had won with the united strength of the city's labor unions, and one it had carried on against much of the strength of the city's labor and particularly Dave Beck.<br>

<br>
"Mr. Smith was a man for an emergency and when in the autumn of 1873, Jay Cooke failed and the contractors of the road from Kalama to Tacoma were unable to pay the men, and it was necessary to meet the requirements of Congress to complete the road to Tacoma before the close of the year, the railroad company put the work of completion into his hands.<br>
<br>
"Sixteen miles of road remained unfinished, and this it was necessary to construct within a few weeks. A force of three hundred men wee encamped under arms at the end of the road, refusing to work until paid, and threatening to fire on anyone else who should attempt to work on the road.<br>
<br>
"But Mr. Smith went out with other gentlemen and aided in inducing the men to resume work without a collision, the road was completed within the time required. It was large through his efforts that the railroad company was induced to build the road up the Puyallup Valley to the Wilkeson coal mines in 1887.<br>

When, in the autumn of 1873, Jay Cook failed, and the contractors on the road from Kalama to Tacoma were unable to pay the men, and it was necessary to meet the requirements of Congress to complete the road to Tacoma before the close of the year, the railroad company, through the individual efforts of Captain Ainsworth, put the work into his hands.<br>
<br>
Sixteen miles of road remained unfinished;  and it was necessary to construct them within a few weeks. A force of three hundred men were encamped under arms at the end of the work refusing to work until paid, and threatening to fire on anyone else who should attempt to work on the road.<br>
<br>
Mr. Smith went out with others to the men and was principally instrumental in inducing the men to return to work.  Under his direction, the railroad was completed within the time required by the charter.  The authority for that important work was contained
in a letter from Captain Ainsworth of a few lines, and which was a veritable carte blanche as to mode of work.<br>

RAILROAD STRIKE OF 1922.<br>
<br>
Leonard Painter, "The Big Strike of 1922," <B>Through fifty years with the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen of America.</B> Kansas City, Missouri: Brotherhood of Railway Carmen, 1941, p. 158-172.<br>
<br>
Brotherhood leaders and officials of other railway labor Organizations were in a difficult position in this momentous year of 1921.  Comparatively little space has been given the war years in this history; under federal control the Brotherhood made many gains for its membership, wide employment kept everyone at work and there were few threats of any sort to bettering conditions.<br>
<br>
Now the situation had reversed itself.  The abnormally high cost of living had made increased wages insufficient ... and now the wage reduction of July 1, 1921 and other losses including a second wage reduction threatened to return the railway worker to worse conditions than existed before the war.<br>
<br>
Brotherhood leadership had hoped to hold fast to standards of wages, hours and working conditions as stipulated in the National Agreement, in a belief that somewhat decreased living costs would result in that agreement providing fair remuneration . But the first wage reduction was followed by a decision on August 11, 1921, dealing with overtime, eliminating time-and-one-half for Sunday and holiday work and modifying other sections of the overtime agreements.<br>
<br>
The effect of this decision was electrifying.  To the Brotherhood membership it was a piecemeal decision on one part of the National Agreement indicating what was to come as other decisions were handed down.  Moreover, these actions in Washington were<br>
directly responsible for an increasingly hostile attitude toward workers on the part of railroad management, particularly local subordinates, who appeared to adopt a manner of treatment calculated to stir the workers to drastic action.<br>
<br>
The executive council of the Railway Employees' Department caged several divisional executive boards into conference . . . at the same time urging every precaution against unauthorized suspensions of work,. which would have Placed the workers in a defenseless position with practically all the rules yet to be decided by the Labor Board.<br>
<br>
At the joint conference the action of the Labor Board was condemned and the conferees declared against any other than a complete decision on Ar rules.  Six representatives from each organization were authorized to tour the country and urge members at federated meetings in all important centers to adhere strictly to the policies adopted.
Another serious and widespread development was the farming out on contract of railroad repair work "for the double purpose," said General President Ryan, "of increasing the profits of the outside companies in which they (the railroads) were financially interested, and of forcing labor to submit to their open-shop program."<br>
<br>
When the Railway Employees' Department presented the matter of contract work to the Labor Board and urged a speedy decision, even the chairman of the board declared this was the most important matter before the Board, and added: "If the conduct of the carriers in those cases is lawful, the ground is cut from under the Labor Board and the vitals are cut out of the Transportation Act."<br>
<br>
Under the contract system piecework had been restored in some<br>
of the shops in spite of employe protests.  It was, as the General President later pointed out, a pathetic situation that long ex-
perienced employees were turned out of railroad employment en-
tirely and given over to contractors, losing all of their seniority rights and pass privileges for themselves and families . . . a reversion on the part of railroad management to practices of the long-ago past!<br>
<br>
Although one of the last acts of Director General McAdoo had been to forbid piecework except by the majority wish of organizations of employees, this work-method was not to disappear from railroad practices.  The railroads appealed to the Labor Board for permission to reinstate the piecework system, but the Board denied them that right except where labor organizations preferred it.  After the strike, the piecework system was revived.<br>
<br>
These serious situations confronted the June, 1922, convention of the Railway Employees' Department convention in Chicago, where the prevailing opinion was that prompt and drastic action must be taken to halt the Labor Board in its surrender of long fought-for railway labor rights.  As a result, the submission of three strike ballots was authorized, (1) dealing with the rules (2) dealing with piecework and contract work; and (3) the recent further reduction of wages by 7 and 9 cents per hour.  The ballots were ordered returnable by July 1, and again the various memberships were cautioned against any impulsive action prior to an authorized strike.<br>
<br>
At the time of submission of the ballots, General President Ryan addressed the Brotherhood membership with an appeal to support the Railway Employees Department's request for funds to be used as strike benefits for certain classes of workers not participating
otherwise in authorized benefits ... and this Brotherhood raised $15,000 for that purpose.  In another appeal to the membership, the General President urged that every member vote his own convictions, and that the final vote represent the biggest possible majority opinion.<br>
<br>
Before July 1, when the balloting was to be completed, the executive council of the Railway Employees' Department made a final effort to prevent the strike.  The council addressed a letter to the chairman of the Association of Railway Executives Placing the responsibility for developments squarely on that association by pointing out that although the Transportation Act provided machinery for negotiation and adjustment of disputes, the carriers had refused to employ it from the outset.<br>
<br>
The letter pointed to other indications that railway management had ruthlessly ignored means of adjustment.<br>
<br>
"There is, however," the letter concluded, "one benefit which may come to the carriers and their employees, and to the general public, from the fact that there are national spokesmen of the conflicting interests who might be able to halt a nationwide strike in the railway service, if the withdrawal of men from employment<br>
railway executives sincerely desire to avoid this consequence of their previous course of action.<br>
<br>
For this reason, in behalf of and by the authority of the executive Council of the Railway Employees' Department, I am informing you and through you informing the responsible heads of the various railway systems in the United States, and also the Pullman Company, most of which are represented in the Association of Railway Executives, that unless an immediate arrangement can be made (to adjust the three points in dispute) a sanction of withdrawal from employment on July 1, 1922, as voted by the employees, wig be unavoidable."<br>
<br>
The tenor of the reply from the railway executives was not unexpected.  After presenting the case of railway management and declaring that wage demands of the labor organizations would put an unjust burden on the public, the reply waxed eloquent in this conclusion: "If the just authority of the <B>Government</B> is to be successfully defied and the Government is to be rendered helpless to protect its citizens in their peaceful and lawful pursuits, if patriotic and loyal obedience to Government authority is to be denied, the act and the responsibility must be yours.<br>
<br>
It shall not be ours.  If you strike it will be against an order of a <B>Government</B> tribunal-it will be a strike against the Government of the United States."<br>
<br>
The Association of Railway Executives now turned patriots for the moment and unmindful of the "unpatriotic" and frequent violation of
Labor Board decisions by ninety member railroads ... thus closed the door on any conciliation or adjustment efforts.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the flood of strike ballots was rolling in!<br>
<br>
It should be recorded here that the organized railway workers had reached such a stage of impatience in the dispute with the railroads and the Labor Board, some factions felt that the cautious moves of the executive council of the Railway Employee' Department were signs of surrender . . . and a distrust of the council stood in the way of a strike, and would never permit a strike to be called.<br>
<br>
It is very apparent, from the viewpoint of today, that the council was wisely and patiently cautious ... for the good name and integrity of railway workers generally.<br>
<br>
However, the suspicion reached a point that some lodges had returned the packages of ballots unopened and unvoted with the comment that balloting was useless in the face of that "attitude" of the executive council.  Because of these things, the ballots were tabulated by a committee appointed from the memberships.<br>
<br>
The result was a vote almost unanimous in favor of the strike ... 97 per cent favorable, to be exact.  And the three issues involved in the strike again should be recorded: First, the establishment of unjust wages by decisions of the Labor Board; second, the establishment of unjust working conditions through amendments by the Labor Board of certain rules of the National Agreement; third, the contracting out of shops and work by a large number of railroads as a means of evading the application of the law to their properties.<br>
<br>
In an attempt to halt the strike the United States Labor Board on June 29 cited labor organizations and railroads to appear at a hearing in Chicago the next day, directing that the status quo be maintained until the hearing was completed.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, on the same day-June 29, 1922-this telegram went to every local union affiliated with the organizations: "In compliance with the strike vote, all shop crafts employed below the rank of general foreman are hereby granted sanction to suspend work 10:00 a. m. July I on all railroads and Pullman shops in the United States.  Notify all outside points.  Wire number responding and number remaining at work."<br>
<br>
The executive council of the Railway Employees' Department refused to appear at the hearing of the Labor Board, filing a communication that stressed the need of labor executives remaining 99 on the job" to counsel the men in a peaceful strike.  It denied the right of the Labor Board to intervene, saying "a compulsory limitation upon the
right to control one's own labor is not within the power of the Government, because this right is a natural right and is protected by the thirteenth amendment of the Constitution."<br>
<br>
The communication asserted that "there is no more important concern than to safeguard the freedom of labor upon which alone can enduring prosperity be based."<br>
<br>
At 10 o'clock the morning of July 1, 1922, history records the greatest stoppage of work ever occurring at one time in the history of American organized labor.  It was from 95 to 100 per cent effective.  All over the land the shop crafts laid down their tools.  The great strike of 1922 was on.<br>
<br>
It was almost at that moment, strange to say, that what has now come to be known as the infamous company-union setup was introduced and sanctioned by the Labor Board to make the strike ineffective.  All the forces against labor were augmented by government itself in the ruthless strangulation of labor that was attempted in the weeks to follow.<br>
<br>
The first move of the Labor Board was a resolution authorizing railroad companies to organize the strikebreakers.  Such company organizations of classes of workers, the board said "...will be desirable, if not a practical necessity." Company associations sprang up in a hurry on a great many of the railroads most of which required the applicant for work to sign an agreement which prevented him from joining any other labor organization except on penalty of being discharged.<br>
<br>
The transportation brotherhoods and orders signed a complaint to the Labor Board, and the American Federation of Labor passed a resolution not only condemning the Board's action and declaring the Board 69 unworthy of public trust," but added: "The American Federation of Labor win take all appropriate Steps to obtain from the congress which created the Labor Board such legislation or declarations of public policy as may check this unamerican effort to destroy the freedom of labor to organize to bargain collectively and to act in concert for the general welfare."<br>
<br>
There was no doubt that railroad operations were seriously crippled by the strike, in spite of frenzied effort to recruit strikebreakers with few questions asked as to qualification-and the assistance of the Labor Board in these efforts.<br>
<br>
Let there be no doubt that labor's opposition was united! State and federal officers and the courts were called on to intimidate and coerce the men on strike.  In many places the militia was caned out without warrant.  Federal injunctions were issued in almost every
federal court district in the land.<br>
<br>
Thousands of striking shopmen were arrested following these injunctions; in nearly every instance where trials were not before juries, the men were convicted and sentenced to fines and prison terms.  In one instance, the counsel for employees was threatened with contempt proceedings if trial by jury were demanded!<br>
<br>
The President of the United States ... President Harding ... issued a proclamation forbidding interference with interstate trans-
portation and the carrying of the mail, which drew a letter from the executive council of the Railway Employees' Department to the chief executive pointing out that the railroads and not the workers had violated the Labor Board decisions ... that railway management had refused all possibilities of adjustment . . . and the labor organizations stood ready to cooperate in such ail effort at any time.<br>
<br>
The executive council met with the President July 28, and later the same day the President conferred with the chairman of the Association of Railway Executives.  Out of those conferences the President conveyed to each side the terms for uniting preliminary to calling off the strike.  But, as pointed out to the President by the executive council after a conference with the policy committee of ninety men, the terms required surrender on the part of labor on the very points over which the strike had been called.<br>
<br>
However, to show their fairness, the shop craft leaders declared magnanimously that "we accept reluctantly, but commit ourselves to carry out the terms of settlement in utmost good faith."<br>
<br>
Their reluctant acceptance was of no use.  The railroad executives rejected the proposal, largely over the one point that all employees would be returned to their former jobs with full seniority rights.  Said the executives: "The striking former employees cannot be given preference to employees at present in the service without doing violence to every principle of right and justice involved<br>
in this matter and without the grossest breach of faith On the part of the railroads to men at present in their service.<br>
<br>
A second attempt by the President to adjust the differences was rejected by both sides. In this attempt, the President asked the labor organizations to resume work and leave the matter of<br>
seniority to a decision of the Labor Board ... the chairman of which already had expressed his opinion that the railroads were right in their viewpoint of seniority!<br>
<br>
It  must  be  recorded  that  among  those  who  attempted 
mediation efforts were executives of railroads not affected by the strike...executives who conferred with government officials and with executives of railroads involved in the strike in attempt to find a solution.<br>
<br>
Those railroad executives did everything in their power to affect mediation of some sort.  Also, following the rejection of the Presidents second proposal, the chief executives of railroad labor organizations not on strike asked the President to use his offices to bring about a settlement on the basis of his first proposal.<br>
<br>
It is noteworthy that  the  leaders  of  the  striking  organizations showed every desire to settle the dispute fairly and it is equally obvious that railroad management was being  ruthlessly stand-pat to break the ranks of organized labor.<br>
<br>
DAUGHERTY AND HIS INJUNCTION<br>
<br>
Unfortunately shop organizations could not have chosen a more inappropriate time to strike than this Post-war period when reactionary forces were in charge of all branches of the government.  A period a decade before had been called the "Age of Property" . . . but it had been the mere shadow of Such an age, compared with the audacious exhibition of government fighting labor in behalf of the entrenched interests.<br>
<br>
Harry M. Daugherty was the next spokesman for the railroads<br>
and he wielded a vicious injunction in this government attempt to break the strike.  It was an injunction without parallel, going so far as to enjoin the officers of the striking organizations from using organization funds and from communicating with members of their organizations "in aid of or to permit or encourage the doing any of the matters or things here in before restrained and enjoined."<br>
<br>
That the effect of the injunction was demoralizing is not to be questioned, for without doing anything unlawful the officers and leaders were subject to arrest.<br>
<br>
Daugherty ... and this act was before he was driven in disgrace from the office of attorney general for what was considered the worst case of corruption in the government's history ... slipped into Chicago September 1, 1922, without any notice of his intentions, and applied for the injunction before Federal Judge James H.     Wilkerson.  His bill of complaint was largely an appeal for the open shop, saying he would use the "power within his control to prevent labor unions of the country from destroying the open shop." The bill pledged all the power- of the government to the railroads.<br>
<br>
With very slight modifications from the bill, the federal judge granted a temporary restraining order.
The injunction had a devastating effect on the strikers.  It brought home to the railway labor organizations the fact that against them were arrayed every power of the financial world, every power of government, every power of capitalistic reactionaries.  Hundreds of men were in prison.<br>
<br>
"Litigation of a stupendous magnitude immediately confronted the organizations," declared General President Ryan.  "It was necessary to employ innumerable lawyers in all sections of the country.  The burden of expense was tremendous and practically beyond the ability of the organizations to meet; all of which, no <B>doubt</B> was the aim of the attorney general.  The result of our ex<B>perience</B> cannot soon be forgotten."<br>
<br>
That matter of litigation cost entered even into defense plans against a permanent injunction, and the leaders of the striking the organizations were compelled to direct their attorneys to with draw from any further defense, saying: "It is useless for the men who labor to match purses with the railroads and the government."<br>
In spite of that withdrawal, government attorneys went into a lengthy trial, the permanent injunction was granted . . . and the of<br>
defendants presented a bill $13,356.70 for court costs! After Daugherty had been removed from  office because of corruption,<br>
the Department of Justice reduced those costs to  $3,421.25 aid the bill was paid.<br>
<br>
Other litigation was piling up, such as a San Francisco suit against the craft organizations in which default judgment was given the railroad for more than 9 million dollars! And there even were suits by such individuals as a foreman who claimed he had had to abandon his employment as a result of the strike, and sued t@ recover $100,000 damages!<br>
<br>
With  every  force   of   management   and   government   against   them with   necessary    expenditures    draining    every    organization treasury almost to the vanishing point ... the plight of the strikers was serious.<br>
<br>
THE BALTIMORE AGREEMENT<br>
<br>
The leaders   of   the   railway   labor   organizations   had   continued their efforts toward settlement, and as late as August 25 had held one of a series of conferences with the Association of Railway Executives.<br>
<br>
It was apparent that the executives disagreed among themselves.<br>
<br>
One so-called "hard boiled" group was headed by Atterbury and Loree, the former and his Pennsylvania Railroad being one of the prime movers for many years in the company-union policy.  They were not agreeable to any kind of a settlement acceptable to the men.  But
Daniel Willard and S. Davies Warfield were leaders of another group that favored some sort of conciliation.<br>
<br>
Willard and Warfield and A. H. Smith, president of the New<br>
York Central Lines, met with representatives of the shop crafts in Baltimore and an agreement was reached, and early in September the strike was settled on the B. & O., the Milwaukee, the Chicago & Northwestern, the Seaboard, the New York Central, the Southern, the Mobile & Ohio and the Carolina, Clinchfield & Ohio.<br>
<br>
The terms of the agreement included restoration of as many men as possible, at prevailing wages, to the same jobs and at the same points as of june 30, and set up a <B>commission</B> composed of six representatives of management and six representatives of labor to pass on disputes arising out of this settlement.<br>
<br>
The executive council of the Railway Employees' Department, and officers of the latter, gave long consideration to the matter of agreement, and against much criticism approved it because of the general situation of increasing hardship, vanishing finances and the futility of hoping for a national agreement of any sort.  Rather, it was believed wiser to make this agreement in the hope that other railroads would join the movement immediately.<br>
<br>
A few of them did . some railroads were several months in adopting it ... and even after two and one-half years the Pennsylvania and Long Island Lines strikes still continued.<br>
<br>
In the weeks that followed, the railroads signing the agreement did not live up to the seniority rule . . . which also remained un-
settled at the time of the 1925 convention.<br>
<br>
The strike had had scarring effects on the participating organi-
zations, including this Brotherhood.  It had opened up the channel for the formation of company unions, which were to be a labor stumbling block for many years to come.  It caused loss of life, and suffering among those who were sent to prison under autocratic power.<br>
<br>
And it caused a breach in the membership, largely among those recent "joiners" who never had been disciplined to the serious and far-reaching purposes of the Brotherhood ... and who now were enemies to organization within the ranks of the Brotherhood.  The strike and its ending created several such major problems that put this organization face to face with the vital need of "beating back" to its previous standing and prestige.<br>

<br>
FOUNDING OF THE TYPOGRAPHICAL UNION.<br>
<br>
Randolph Radebaugh, "Founding of the typographical union," <B>The Tacoma News Tribune.</B> September 9, 1922. Number twenty-one in a series.<br>
<br>
City Editor Had Reputation Brought From East<br>
As Scrapper; Later Wrote Valuable Manual<br>
Used Today as Reference<br>
<br>
This is the 21st of a series of articles written for The News<br>
Tribune by R. F. Radebaugh, veteran editor of the Ledger, which he<br>
founded in 1881. In this article Mr. Radebaugh tells of the early<br>
newspaper making in Tacoma and of the incident which preceeded the<br>
last signature written by President Garfield before he was fatally<br>
shot.<br>
<br>
(NOTE: The first part of this article describes the people in<br>
a picture that can be found on page 5 of the September 9, 1922<br>
issue of the Tacoma News Tribune.)<br>
<br>
The above half tone represents very nearly all of the employees<br>
of the Tacoma Daily Ledger, posing at the front of the brick Ledger<br>
building on the west side of C Street (now called Broadway), erected four years before. The photograph was made in 1887--35 years ago, and includes all of the employees at that time except l A. Maulsby, foreman of the composing room; one reporter, and the boys who delivered the papers.<br>
<br>
The men stood in front of the business office, on and near the<br>
north end of the narrow platform which was built of consequence of<br>
cutting the street down to the grade established by the city, about<br>
three feet below the first floor of the building.<br>
<br>
The platform remained until the Ledger office was moved to 10th Street, in 1892, when it was torn away, a new floor laid on a level with the sidewalk, and two storerooms substituted for the old offices.<br>
<br>
In the lower room, from left to right are--C. H. Bell, printer;<br>
Ceorge Boothroyd; Phil Rummel, printer; Frank W. Beach, pressman; --- Jones, printer; Clarence Barton's little daughter; Fred Baker, now makeup on the San Francisco Examiner; ---McGrath, printer; Ed. Moabus, printer; Edward Herriff, printer. In the upper row, left to right, are: Chris Holz, errand boy; ---Toy, printer; Walter Whitney; E. M. Beach, job foreman, now in San Francisco; William Watson, printer; R. P. Milne, printer; Clarence Barton; E. L. Gruener; Morton Ramsdell; ---Porter, printer; Ed Lamb, printer; C. R. Wyland, printer; George Arkley, bookkeeper; Will Sutherland, city circulator.<br>

There are about a dozen printers tiring their legs and bodies<br>
by standing before the case, picking and setting type as through<br>
hundreds of years agone--for Mergenthaler had not yet arrived on his feet--and, when the little stick was filled, dumping and resuming the snail's pace for other and still other similar, small grabs; thus continuing the night of immense tedium until the paper was "up" to be followed the morrow by the equally tedious operation of 'throwing in, or distributing, ... the same type in the cases, preparatory to the next issue.<br>
<br>
When mere reminiscence of it seems wearisome there is hardly room for wonder that the practice turned so many to strong drink.<br>
<br>
Organized in 1883<br>
<br>
The local typographical union was about four years old when the<br>
picture was taken, a published announcement of the organization,<br>
recording the date as of September 30, 1883, about three weeks after the driving of the last spike on the Northern Pacific. The last spike event ushered in numerous and important changes in Tacoma and throughout the territory, and this was one of them. Through rail traffic with the East was deemed to have warranted all manner of developments and expansions.<br>
<br>
After promising appropriate remarks concerning "The Art of Arts<br>
Preservative," customary on such occasions, announcement stated that "the members of the typographical art in New Tacoma being of sufficient number to warrant the formation of a union, and being fully cognizant of the benefits to be derived therefrom, resolved to take the necessary steps toward the formation of such an organization, and, accordingly, as prearranged, the members of the craft in this city, to the number of 15, met in the composing room of the Ledger office on the last Sunday (September 30), at 2 o'clock p.m. with that object in view.<br>
<br>
The purpose and object of the meeting were stated to those present, after which Mr. D. A. Maulsby, foreman of the Ledger composing room, as temporary chairman, called the meeting to order.<br>
<br>
"All present then signed the roll and the names were as follows:<br>
D. A. Maulsby, S. H. Condon, W. A. Berry, Frank Baldauf, Marshall Fell Jr., Oliver Waller, S. H. Herin, George G. Ashbaugh, Hugh Glenn, M. D. McCaslin, E. L. Gruener, George Anderson, E. M. Beach, T. W. Beach, T. D. Powell.<br>
<br>
"The following officers were then chosen: President, S. H. Herin;<br>
vice president, W. A. Berry; recording and corresponding secretary, T. D. Powell; financial secretary and treasurer, Marshall Fell Jr.; sergeant- at-arms, S. H. Condon; board of directors, W. A. Berry, E. L. Gruener and D. A. Maulsby.<br>
<br>
The name adopted for the organization is the 'Tacoma Typographical Union.' Application will at once be made for a charter from the
International Typographical Union, at Washington, D. C., and the local union will meet at the call of the directors."<br>

<br>
WILKESON STRIKE OF 1919.<br>
<br>
Nancy Irene Hall, "The Wilkeson Strike of 1919," <B>Carbon River Coal Country.<br>
</B><br>
The miners at Wilkeson joined the ranks and the mines shut down on October 31, 1919.  The men wanted a 14% raise in wage and other working conditions changed.  In December, the mines were still shut down.  Two of the main operators in the Carbon River area threated to open the mines on an open-shop basis.<br>
<br>
Besides the strike, on October the 28, 1919, state wide enforcement of the 'bone-dry law' went into effect.  It was up to the Department of Internal Revenue to see that the law was carried out.  Immediately they descended upon Wilkeson and arrested two local men and hauled them off to jail with a stiff fine and the threat of imprisonment.<br>
<br>
Such were the conditions the men coming home from the war faced, when they arrived home to Wilkeson.  It was a changed place, and it would never be the same from that day on. The 'boom' was over.<br>

<br>
Nancy Irene Hall, "The Wilkeson Miners Strike of 1921," <B>Carbon River Coal Country.<br>
<br>
</B><br>
The men had gone back to mining and managed to reach an agreement with the mine owners.  Suddenly the mine companies notified the men, that they were going to roll back the price of coal and the wages of the men to the rate which was in effect before the strike of October 31, 1919, The contract the men were working under was not due to expire until 1922.  When the news came the miner's Union became enraged.<br>
<br>
On March 15th, in 1921, the cut in wages and prices went into effect.  The cuts ran: skilled coal digger's cut from $10.00 per day down to $8.50, semi-skilled coal-diggers from $8.25 to $5.29, common underground labor from $7.55 to $5.20 and common above ground labor from $7.00 to $4.65.<br>
<br>
The miners struck.  On March 31st, the miners walked out on strike.  The Companies gave the men a deadline.  If they did not go back to work they were to leave the Company owned homes.  The Union officials stood firm and the men were not even allowed to vote, to see if the majority of the miners would accept the new rates.  This was a period of tremendous strife.  The Union men were forced to leave the Company owned homes.  Some went to South Prairie and Union Hill was established.<br>
<br>
The miners put up tents on the hill and tried to wait out the strike.  They were sure an agreement would be reached and soon they could return to Wilkeson and the mines.  Others left the area, as they could not afford to wait out the strike.<br>
<br>
The Companies retaliated against the striking miners, and they opened the mines under the open-shop method.  They brought other men into the 'Up-town' section and reopened the mines.  Ad's were put in all the local newspapers soliciting men to come to work at the mines, under the new rates.<br>
<br>
The people, who lived 'Down-town' were luckier in some respects.  They owned or rented their homes and the Company could only take their jobs away and not their very homes in which they lived.  "Up-town' and 'Down-town' became hated enemies.  Each day at a certain time of the day all the people from 'Down-town' would walk to the mine areas and curse the new miners, who were at work.  The Company stood pat and so did the miner's Union.  There was not a chance of reaching                                          any agreement.<br>
<br>
The strike lasted, almost two and one-half years. The men were starved out.  They lost their Union.<br>

<B>GADBAW, WILLIAM J.</B>  (First on Tacoma News Tribune list).<br>
<br>
William J. Gadbaw, 36, of Olympia was believed to have leaped from the bridge. His car was found abandoned on the span about 2:00 p.m., Tuesday. Oldtimers in the city recalling that the bodies of very few persons who have been lost in the cold waters of the Narrows have ever been found expressed doubt that further search would be of value.<br>
<br>
If Gadbaw leaped from the span, his is the first known suicide on the bridge since it was opened October, 1950. The bridge floor is 213 feet from the water at the spot where Gadbaw is believed to have jumped. (Tacoma News Tribune March 14, 1952).<br>

<br>
The body was found floating one hundred fifty feet south of the center span. The body was buoyed by air pockets in the shirt and slacks he had on. (Tacoma News Tribune June 18, 1953).<br>

The swirling waters of the Tacoma Narrows claimed another victim Friday when a woman identified as Mrs. Gertrude L. Stevens leaped to her death from the center of the bridge.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Stevens left her coat on the bridge railing and her  purse on the sidewalk. In the purse she left a note to her family in explanation of her action.  Mrs. Stevens is the eighth person who has leaped from the span since its completion. (Tacoma News Tribune October 22, 1954).<br>

A 37 year old woman plunged to her death from the Tacoma Narrows Bridge about 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Three witnesses told police they were dirving toward Tacoma when they noticed a parked unattended car near the west pier of the bridge. Then they said they saw Mrs. Myers standing on the south bridge rail, hanging on to the supporting cables.  She pushed herself away from the cables and fell two hundred feet below to the water as she was approached.  The body was picked up at Point Evans. (Tacoma News Tribune June 16, 1956).<br>

<B>STARNES, CHARLES C</B><br>
<br>
"NP wire chief dies in leap from Span," <B>Tacoma News Tribune.</B> November 10, 1956<br>
<br>
Ignoring the plea "For God's sake, man, don't jump," the wire
chief for the Northern Pacific Railway yesterday plunged to his death from the west end of the Narrows Bridge.<br>
<br>
Charles C. Starnes, 68, of 3606 South Thompson Avenue, apparently was killed instantly when he struck the base of a concrete pier 200 feet below the Gig Harbor end of the span.<br>
<br>
Starnes, employed by Northern Pacific for fifty years, had been on a leave of absence since September 4, because of illness.<br>
<br>
Sgt. Mark Hamilton, Washington Toll Bridge Authority, tried to talk Starnes out of leaping after he saw the veteran railroad employe leave his automobile on the bridge and walk to the railing.<br>
<br>
"He acted as if he didn't hear a word I said," Hamilton told investigating officers.<br>
<br>
A note to Starnes' wife, Helen, was found in the car. In it Starnes said he "couldn't stand" his illness any longer. There was a list of persons to be notified of his death and a quit claim deed turning his property over to Mrs. Starnes, dated November 1.<br>
<br>

<B>BACKER, ELWIN.</B>     (Number 17 on the Tacoma News Tribune list) 
("NP Official dies in leap into Narrows," <B>Tacoma News Tribune.</B> August 17, 1966.).<br>
<br>
A sixty-six year old Tacoma railroad official plunged to his death Wednesday morning from the Narrows Bridge.<br>
<br>
The apparent suicide victim was identified as Elwin Backer, of 1212 North K Street, district claims agent for the Northern Pacific Railway.<br>
<br>
His body was recovered from the Narrows just north of the bridge a short time later.<br>
<br>
There were at least two eye-witnesses to the jump<br>
<br>
Bill Kepler, a Tacoma auto salesman who lives in Bremerton said he was crossing the bridge at 8:20 a.m. when he saw a car stop and a well dressed man get out and head for the railing.<br>
<br>
"I hollered at him: "Stop! Don't do it, Think it over!" Kepler said. "He had one foot up on the railing, looked back at me for a moment then just kept going. He went over head first.<br>
<br>
"He had kind of a wild look in his eye."<br>
<br>
Another motorist  C.A. Peterson of 1306 Mountain View Avenue, watched Backer jump and then called authorities from one of the newly installed emergency telephones on the bridge.<br>
<br>
The Coast Guard was alterted but the body was recovered by Ervin Runolfson of the Sixth Avneue Boathouse, using a small boat. He took the body to the boathouse for inspection by Cornor Larry Amundson. The body was naken to the Gaffney Funeral Home.<br>
<br>
No note was found in the Backer car, which was driven off the bridge by Officer Glen Alexander, police said. Then wife, Mrs. Elizabeth Backer, an employe in the office of the Tacoma Public Schools, said her husband had been morose and apparently on the verge of a nervous collapse but that he had not indicated that he contemplated suicide.<br>
<br>
The leap was the 17th known Narrows Bridge suicide and the first in more than two years.<br>

The body of a twenty-year old Gig Harbor man was discovered on the north side of the west pier of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge by a passing fisherman about noon Monday.<br>
<br>
David Kenney, 21, of Gig Harbor, apparently jumped off the bridge sometime Monday morning, according to police reports. A Sheriff's Department official said Kennedy was "despondent over a female."<br>
<br>
Pierce County Sheriff's District 13 office at noon recieved a call concerning the body and dispatched an officer to the bridge.  Sgt. Bill Seewer said a vehicle registered to Kennedy was found parked near an underpass at the west end of the bridge.<br>
<br>
Kennedy's body was recovered by the Sheriff's Department marine unit from Day Island. A Tacoma fire boat also responded to transport the man's body to the Day Island marina, where a coroner was waiting.<br>

Traffic in the Tacoma bound lanes of State Route 16 was delayed slightly during the noon hour as police responded to the bridge. However, authorities said use of the Tacoma fire boat helped prevent major traffic problems which often occur when police or medical personnel must respond to an incident on the bridge.<br>

<br>
While would-be rescuers tried to get a broken elevator on the Narrows Bridge to work a twenty-six year old Tacoma man spent nearly three hours atop the bridge's eastern tower before jumping to his death Saturday afternoon.<br>
<br>
Tacoma firefighters and state troopers climbed the tower to reach the man but he jumped shortly before 2:00 p.m. when the first would-be rescuer reached the top of the tower said a dispatcher with the Tacoma Fire Department.<br>
<br>
A nearby boater pulled the body from the Narrows Tacoma police said. The Pierce County Medical Examiner's Office identified the dead man as Vanc Gabriel.<br>
<br>
During most of his time on the tower, Gabriel was lying down and could not be seen from the ground. At times, he stood up and looked over the tower's railing at the traffic below.<br>
<br>
Authorities at the bridge said he apparently reached the tower's top by climbing a diagonal support that links the bridge deck with the top of the tower.<br>
<br>
The rescue attempt was delayed while firefighters and Tacoma Police tried unsuccessfully to use an elevator to reach the top of the tower.<br>
<br>
The elevator had been broken for a week said Dennis Ulmer, bridge maintenance supervisor with the Department of Transportation.<br>
<br>
He said he hopes to have the elevator fixed within a week when a
custom made part is expected to be ready.<br>
<br>
The State Patrol did not close the bridge during the drama, but traffic was delayed at times as motorists slowed to watch rescuers on the bridge deck.<br>

EATON, DENNIS.<br>

Anthony K. Albert, "Tacoma Narrows Bridge reopened following
man's suicide jump," <B>The Tacoma News Tribune.</B> January 7, 1997.<br>
<br>
A man died Monday morning after jumping from a five hundred foot high tower on the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.<br>
<br>
But Dennis Eaton never hit the chilly waters of Puget Sound. A stiff, cold breeze blew the 36 year old Bonney Lake man back over the bridge. He landed on the roadway 300 feet below the top of the west tower Tacoma police said.<br>
<br>
The Pierce County medical examiner's office will perform an autopsy today on Eaton, medical investigator Bob Bishop said. The Tacoma police are investigating the incident said Sergeant Mike Taylor.<br>
<br>
A motorist called 911 operators shortly before 9:00 a.m. to report seeing a man walking up the catwalk toward the tower.<br>
<br>
Tacoma police and the Washington State Patrol troopers shut down the entire bridge at 9:00 a.m. Eaton was on the south side of the tower facing Steilacoom when he jumped at about 9:15 a.m.<br>
<br>
"We didn't get an opportunity to negotiate with him," Taylor said.<br>
<br>
The officer watched Eaton fall back through the cables onto the roadway less than twenty feet from where Taylor was standing.<br>
<br>
The strong winds carried one of Eaton's shoes about 2,000 feet north of the bridge before it landed in the water.<br>
<br>
Shortly after Eaton jumped troopers opened one eastbound lane, allowing traffic to trickle over the bridge toward Tacoma. Blankets covered Eaton's body; emergency vehicles shielded it from curious passers by.<br>
<br>
All four lanes were reopened by 10:30 a.m.<br>

Elgin V. Kuykendall "Pomeroy Tong Killing," <B>History of Garfield County.</B> Fairfield: Ye Galleon Press, 1984, 79-81.<br>
<br>
I was Prosecuting Attorney for Garfield County during the years 1899 and 1900.  At that time county officials held office for two years instead of four as now provided by law.  On March 5, 1900, as I was busy in my office I was informed by Deputy Sheriff Sam Russell that strange happenings had taken place in the upper end of town and that it was suspected that a Chinaman had been killed.<br>
<br>
We proceeded to a board shack in which Wah Hop, a Chinese gardener, made his home.  This shanty was located on a tract of land then owned by Charles Ward and later conveyed to Raymond Gentry.  Willie Mon, a Chinese friend of Wah Hop, had gone to this shack the day before and had remained overnight.<br>
<br>
On the morning in question, which I remember as being rather raw and cold, Roscoe Ward was working not far from Wah Hop's house.  When Hop Wing, the Chinaman who was killed, came by and asked Roscoe if there were any Chinamen at Wah Hop's place, Roscoe informed him that he did not know.  Hop Wing then went to the house, approached the door on the opposite side from Roscoe, and knocked rather loudly.<br>
<br>
A few moments after Roscoe heard several shots fired in rapid succession.  He went to the cabin to see what had happened, but was refused admittance.  About that time Fred Matthies came by on horseback and Roscoe told him what had taken place.  Fred and Roscoe then went to the house, but all was silent, and there was no response to their rapping.<br>
<br>
They then threatened to knock the door down unless it was opened.  They were then admitted and they demanded to know what had become of Hop Wing.  The two Chinamen told them he had called, but had gone away but would be back within an hour.  When questioned about the shooting they said they had been shooting chickens.  Upon searching the cabin carefully, and taking possession of the firearms and other weapons - of which there were a number -they finally found Wah Hop's body in a back room, covered with gunny sacks, upon which was a tub and other articles.<br>
<br>
The dead man was doubled up like a jack-knife.  His head was bloody and there were indications of skull fracture.  They left the body where they had found it, placing the sacks over it until the officers could be called.  They took the two Chinamen outside where they were guarded by Roscoe, until Mr. Matthies got in touch with the Sherfffs Office.<br>
<br>
Wah Hop was scrupulously honest and had a good reputation, and had for several years operated a commercial garden on the land where
the cabin was located.  He was a familiar figure about town in those days as he went about delivering vegetables, and we were surprised that he should be involved in a crime of violence.<br>
<br>
Willie Mon admitted the killing after the body was found, but stated that he owed money to Wah Hop, who threatened to kill him unless he paid immediately, and that the slaying was in self-defense.  When Mr. Russell and I arrived Mr. Matthies lifted up the sacks disclosing, to our amazement, Hop Wing.<br>
<br>
Though Hop Wing was small, it did not seem possible that a human being could be concealed by such an insignifcant covering, but he was folded up with his chin at his knees, and occupied an incredibly limited space.  Sheriff Russell immediately placed Wah Hop and Willie Mon under arrest.  Neither exhibited the slightest emotion, either fear or surprise.<br>
<br>
We held an inquest and found a number of bullet holes in the body and a large number of wounds apparently made by some pointed instrument.  We found a sharpened iron rod about half an inch in diameter, which we assumed was responsible for the large number of punctures found in the body.<br>
<br>
Sheriff Russell searched the cabin further for any papers or effects belonging to Wah Hop which ought to be preserved.  In a cigar box with other papers we found his registration certificate issued by the Government under the Chinese Exclusion Act.  This law required all Chinese within our borders to register, and each was furnished with a certificate containing a photograph of the registrant, and stating that he or she was a resident of the United States prior to the taking effect of the exclusion act.<br>
<br>
Any Chinese national found in this country after the act took effect, who was unable to produce such a certificate was deported, hence such documents were valued highly by the holders.  In Chinese pawn shops they were accepted as security for loans running into hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars.  I remember that Mr. Russell and I commented on the fact that the picture on Wah Hop's certificate was an excellent lieness.<br>
<br>
I noticed however that the name appearing in the certificate was not Wah Hop.  I questioned him regarding this and he explained that the name in the certificate was his true name, while the name Wah Hop was his trade name, which he retained after purchasing the garden because his predecessor did business under that name.  The significance of these matter will appear later in this narrative.<br>
<br>
Mr. Samuel G. Cosgrove, who later became Governor of the State, and who was practicing law here at that time was employed to conduct the. defense by a Chinese organization of which the accused were members.<br>
<br>
     
On the day following the killing - March 6 - 1900, a preliminary hearing was held before John Thompson, justice of the Peace, the witnesses who testified at this hearing were Roscoe Ward, Fred Matthies, S.S. Russell, W.R. Williamson and W. E. Allen.  Our jail facilties at that time were inadequate and Willie Mon and Wah Hop were sent to Walla Walla, as was our custom then, our country paying for keeping and boarding the prisoners.<br>
<br>
The trial of the defendants began May 22, 1900, before M. M. Godman, Superior judge.  The Chinamen interposed a plea of not guilty, contending that the killing was justified on the grounds of self-defense and there was some evidence tending to support their position.  It appeared that bad blood had existed for some time between Willie Mon, one of the defendants, and Hop Wing, who was killed.<br>
<br>
There was some testimony to the effect that Hop Wing had a bad reputation for peace and quietude, and was regarded as rather violent and quarrelsome, and at some time previous to the homicide had been searching for Willie Mon and making threats against him.  Willie Mon testified, as I  recall it, that he was afraid of Hop Wing and had sought refuge in Wah Hop's cabin to escape his vengeance, but that Hop Wing had found out his place of concealment and had come to the shack to kill him, as he believed.<br>
<br>
However, it did not appear that Hop Wing carried any weapon when he came to Wah Hop's house, and as there was a conflict of testimony, the jury evidently believed that the killing was unjustified and retumed a verdict of murder in the second degree, and the two Chinamen were sentenced to ten years in the penitentiary at Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
The weapons found in the shack was ordered turned over to Mr. Cosgrove, attorney for the defendants.  This pistol used in the killing had been purchased by Willie Mon a few days before the homicide, from Darby & Mowry's Hardware Store.  Mr. Cosgrove later gave the gun to Fred Matthies.<br>
<br>
A number of mysterious things occurred in relation to this crime and the trial.  Several days before the case was tried, a prominent Chinese merchant who was then in business at Yakimaa appeared at my office and asked me whether I believed I could secure a conviction of the defendants.  I told him that I doubted if a jury would convict them of murder in the first degree, but believed it likely they would be found guilty of the lesser crime of murder in the second degree, because of a possible showing that the deceased was the aggressor.<br>
<br>
He then inquired what the penalty would be for second degree murder.  I informed him that they would be sentenced to the penitentiary but would not be hanged.  He expressed his entire satisfaction and explained that imprisonment was more severe punishment to a Chinaman than hanging.  
Chinamen of the old order regarded human life lightly, including their own.  It was evident that he was anxious to see the defendants convicted.  I asked him if he had any particular interest in the matter and he explained that he was a cousin of the dead Chinaman.  Knowing the looseness with which the Chinese use that term, "cousin" I questioned him further.  I gathered from his statements that he and Hop Wing belonged to the same "tong" and that Willie Mon belonged to another tong.<br>
<br>
Just what a tong is or what it means in Chinese life is difficult to fathom, and I doubt if any white man has ever penetrated the intricacies and mysteries of these Oriental clans or organizations, or has understood the dark forces back of the feuds ascribed to them.  They appear to be secret, oath-bound associations, the members of which would die rather than reveal the purposes for which they are bound together.<br>
<br>
I asked him if he knew Hop Wing's reputation for peace and quietude, explaining that the reputation of the deceased in that regard in a murder trial might be of some importance where a plea of self defense was entered.  He never answered but after a moment's reflection he shook hands and left.  I thought no more about it until after the trial when he came to my office and said, "You sabbe Sam Lee? He say Hop Wing heap good man, no fight," and chuckled gleefully.<br>
<br>
The inference was that he had influenced Sam Lee, a Laundry Chinaman, shortly after the homicide and he had given me substantially the same answer that he gave on the witness stand.<br>
<br>
I doubt if the Yakima merchant had influenced his testimony.  He may have been posing as a shrewd manipulator.  But after the trial Sam Lee appeared terrified and left Pomeroy.  He was a reluctant witness and seemed anxious to keep out of the case.<br>
<br>
About ten days before the case was called, a polished, educated Chinaman by the name of Gam Sing Quah, appeared in Pomeroy as a Christian Missionary, and preached one or two excellent sermons in the churches here.  He had a pleasing personality and spoke English fluently, in fact, was a graduate of one of our leading colleges.<br>
<br>
He remained in Pomeroy for no apparent reason.  He talked with me on several occasions but never mentioned the Chinese murder case.  I had been in correspondence with a Chinese interpreter at Walla Walla, known as Shu Fly, and contemplated securing him for this trial, as Chinese witnesses sometimes feign ignorance of English to evade embarrassing answers.<br>
<br>
Before I had arranged for the services of Shu Fly, someone-whom, I do not now recall suggested that Gam Sing Quah would make an
excellent interpreter.  I have always believed that this party was prompted by Brother Quah.  The result was that Rev.  Quah was engaged as interpreter.<br>
<br>
I have often wondered whether his rather strange appearance in Pomeroy just before the trial was a mere coincidence, or the work of some tong, whose devious ways are too deep for white folk to fathom.  I am inclined to believe that often-quoted statement of Bret Harte in one of his poems:<br>
<br>
For ways that are dark and tricks that are vain,<br>
The heathen Chinese is peculiar.<br>
<br>
My curiosity was further aroused when the tong or organization that employed Mr. Cosgrove to defend, suggested to Mr. Cosgrove that Shu Fly would be preferable as interpreter.  As I had already employed Mr. Quah, I suggested to Mr. Cosgrove that he have Shu Fly present to check the accuracy of Mr. Quah's interpretation, which was done.<br>
<br>
However, I can say, to the credit of Mr. Quah. that he was a good interpreter, and he was not detected in any attempt to mislead or misinterpret any witwess.  On several occasions he would discuss in Chinese with Shy Fly, the proper answer to be given for the record, and when the exact words were agreed upon, Mr. Quah would announce them.<br>
<br>
After Wah Hop and Willie Mon had served several years of their sentence, Mr. Cosgrove sought to have them paroled.  They had conducted themselves as model prisoners and had an excellent institutional record.  I joined in the request for parole.  They had already served about eight years of the ten years' sentence.<br>
<br>
My sympathy was more for Wah Hop, however, than for Willie Mon, because I always felt that Wah Hop was in a measure a victim of circumstances.  His friend Willie Mon had come to his house, and with true Chinese loyalty to a guest he had helped his friend dispose of an enemy.<br>
<br>
As soon as it was known that the Chinamen were to be released, the U.S. Department of Immigration sought to deport them as undesirable aliens.  Mr. Cosgrove then began a search for their registration certificates.  In the meantime, Sam Russell, who had taken Wah Hop's certificate to his office, had died and the great fire of 1900 had destroyed the old wooden courthouse and these papers with it.<br>
<br>
I was apparently the only living witness who could testify concerning the certificate and its destruction by fire.  I was summoned as a witness at the deportation hearing in the Federal Courtroom at Walla Walla.  I had wondered how I would be received by Wah Hop and Willie in view of the fact that I had prosecuted them.  
As I entered the courtroom they arose and shook hands with me and smiled pleasantly.  I testified to the facts regarding Wah Hop's certificate.  Willie Mon testified that he had pawned his certificate in Portland and had never redeemed it.  I am satisfied that he had made no effort to secure his certificate and wanted a free trip back to China.<br>
<br>
Judge Whitson, who was then Federal judge, announced that he was satisfied that Wah Hop had been issued a registration certificate and gave him three months to secure a copy from the archives at Washington.  Willie Mon, who was in ill health, was ordered deported, and seemed delighted at the thought of going home to sleep with the bones of his fathers.<br>
<br>
I heard that Wah Hop died before a copy of his certificate was secured.  Shu Fly told me that the Chinese consulate would make no serious effort to secure a copy for an ordinary Coolie, and that it was a difficult task to find the original among thousands having similar names and features.  My efforts to aid Wah Hop proved vain.<br>

TWO SCORE KILLED IN STREET CAR WRECK<br>
<br>
("Two score killed in street car wreck, frightful plunge over a high bridge sends a happy Fourth of July crowd into eternity and saddens many homes," <B>Tacoma Daily Ledger.</B> July 5, 1900.).<br>
<br>
Nearly a hundred persons, passengers on a car bound for this city were plunged down a gulch at 26th and C streets shortly after 8:00 o'clock yesterday morning. Those who were standing on the platforms dropped off only to be crushed and wounded by the heavy body of the coach while others inside were killed or maimed before they knew what had happened.<br>
<br>
The car jumped the track and was smashed into kindling wood in the bottom of the chasm over a hundred feet below. The dead will number more than two score, for there are many of the injured who will never recover and who are expected to die at any moment and there are at least sixty of the passengers of the car now in the various hospitals or under the care of their own physicians.<br>
<br>
Death Interfered<br>
<br>
It was one of the most appalling accidents that has ever occurred in the Northwest, and it came at a time when people, residents of the nearby towns, South Tacoma, Lake View, Parkland, Hullhurst, Lake Park and other places, coming to Tacoma full of joy and patriotism to spend the Fourth of July.<br>
<br>
Their journey was nearly at an end when death interfered, and claimed them as his own in a most frightful manner. He gave no quarter. Neither man, woman nor child was spared.<br>
<br>
Crushed and mangled the unfortunates were dragged from beneath the wreck of the car and tender hands ministered to them until
conveyances could be had to carry them to hospitals and to the homes of their friends. The dead were laid on the gras, but there were few in the crowds of spectators and rescuers who gathered at the scene at that time who knew who were dead and living.<br>
<br>
Such a spectacle of battered mutilated humanity has scarcely ever been seen. A former member of the First Washington Volunteers, who has played a part in many battlefields in the Philippines said he never witnessed such a sight before.<br>
<br>
Spectacle of carnage.<br>
<br>
It was a spectacle of carnage such as is scarcely ever observed in war for car wheels and trucks and heavy timbers make more horrible wounds that bullets and shells. And the agonizing cries of the wounded and the ding as they lay on one side of the gulch and in the bottom or where held down under the heavy timbers that once formed a part of the wrecked car, could be heard for blocks away.<br>
<br>
There was help at hand a few moments after the accident occurred. Citizens, post men firemen, guardsmen, ex-volunteer and women and children aided. The sides of the gulch are steep in fact so steep that a goat would scarcely be able to descend them, but the cries of the wounded made men forget for they plunged downward without regard to their own safety.<br>
<br>
Ropes were quickly procured and the victims of the wreck were drawn carefully to the top of the gulch and their wounds attended to as fast as it was possible for the physicians to work. Every doctor in the city was called on for his advise. The Fanny Paddock and St. Joseph's hospitals were soon crowded with patients who but a few moments before wee in the enjoyment of their health.<br>
<br>
Hacks, express wagons, and all sorts of conveyances were pressed into service, but there was another vehicle that was in use too. It was the wagon of the dead. It came to take away the last evidence of the destruction caused by the wreck. It made journey after journey and it was always full. Boys and girls, and men and women were its freight. The morgues of the various undertaking rooms were scarcely large enough to hold all.<br>
<br>
Searching for Friends.<br>
<br>
And then when the dead had been sorted from the living, and the last one had been removed from the wreck, excited men and women and children besieged the morgues searching for missing friends. Some wee successful in their sad quest, and others who wee not successful turned away with every evidence of joy on their faces.<br>
<br>
Thousands of people visited the bridge where they accident occurred during the day. They watched the men at work clearing
away the debris of the car, and looked curiously at the red stains ont he grass and the tattered pieces of clothing that hung from the bushes.<br>
<br>
They glanced too, at two women who wandered about all day, one with a babe in her arms, and the other leading a small boy by the hand. The charges of these women were foundlings of the wreck. Nobody had come to claim them.<br>
<br>
Perhaps their mother and their father as well were dead. But they have found friends, and if nobody asks for them, their foster mothers will probably see that they do not want. Then there is a little girl of four and a girl babe at the Fanny Paddock Hospital. They seemed to e deserted but it is probably that some relatives will look after them.<br>
<br>
The Fated Car<br>
<br>
The car, which carried its human freight into the deep ravine instead of to the city was No. 116. It left South Tacoma at 8 o'clock in charge of F.L. Boehm, motorman, and J. D. Calhoun, conductor. The car which is one of the big box-like affairs was crowded to the doors and every inch of space on the platforms was taken. Men hung on to the railings and were glad to be able to get a ride to the city, for like those inside they were anxious to arrive early so as not to miss any of the independence day exercises.<br>
<br>
The car ran merrily along, the passengers chatting with each other, for they were nearly all acquainted and everything was pleasant until it reach the apex of the hill just beyond Tacoma Avenue. From this point the stories differ. One is that the motorman, after starting down the hill, turned on his current instead of shutting it off and when the car had gained such a momentum as to threaten to get away from him he turned off the current, but it was then too late, for the car was going at lightning speed and there was nothing to bring it to a standstill for the incline is steep.<br>
<br>
Passengers on the front platform, who saw the sharp curve on the bridge as it leaves Delinn Street, endeavored to jump. Several of them succeeded in reaching the ground in safety, but others were as badly injured as they might have been had they remained on the car to the bottom of the chasm.<br>
<br>
Another story is that the motorman lost control of the car when it left the hill and was unable to bring it under control again.But whatever the story the car went over the bridge and there is sorrow in over one hundred families in this city and in the neighboring towns.<br>
<br>
The curve which leads to the bridge comes from the southwest. Besides being partly on a hill it is very sharp as it touches the bridge.  On either side of the tracks on the bridge are guards a
foot high which were placed in position for the purpose of preventing a car from jumping off the bridge. These guards are of heavy timber topped with railroad iron.<br>
<br>
The guard on the right side of the track looking north was not even marked after the wreck yesterday. The can had evidently jumped over it. A  young man who was thrown from the front platform just before the bridge was reached said he believe that the rapidity of the descent of the coach caused it to leap over this obstruction and plunge over the side of the bridge.<br>
<br>
Another spectator said he believed that the car struck the guard and toppled over but there are no marks on the guard to show that it came in contact with anything. Then there are deep ridges worn in the wooden ties on the other side of the guard which plainly show that the car wheels passed over them.<br>
<br>
It is possible and probably that the can did turn over in its descent. Nearly all those who were killed were injured about the head and all the occupants of the coach must have been jammed in one mass at the bottom of the car when it struck the bottom of the gulch, and only released when it feel to pieces.<br>
<br>
Horrifying Spectacle.<br>
<br>
The scene five minutes after the accident occurred was one that would make the stoutest heart break down. Strewn from the bridge for a distance of about one hundred yards up the hill toward Tacoma Avenue were a score of people, writhing in agony, while in the gulch lay the wreck of a car, its framework scattered on the sides of the declivity and dead and dying and wounded lying all about.<br>
<br>
The shrieks of the injured were heartrending. the beautiful green of the grass was stained here and there a deep crimson the life blood of the passengers on the doomed car.<br>
<br>
The crash of the car as it plunged from the bridge to the bottom of the gulch over one hundred feet below could be heard for several blocks. Thee was a creaking of timbers and a rasping of wheelers and then a terrible thud as the car struck the bottom.<br>
<br>
Residents of the vicinity rushed to the scene from every direction and soon willing hands were at work on the steep sides of the gulch endeavoring to rescue the wounded. the car had been smashed into pieces and those who escaped were indeed fortunate.  For a half an hour after the accident occurred a diligent search was made for any person who had escaped without injury but none could be found. It is very probably that every one in the car was more or less injured.<br>
<br>
Help at Hand<br>
<br>
The first comers on the scene were so paralyzed by the scene that
for a time they were helpless. Then somebody turned in a call for an ambulance. When the ambulance arrived, those in charge of it quickly took in the situation and a call was sent to the fire department for help.<br>
<br>
Several engines and a hook and ladder truck responded and the fireman ran down the sides of the gulch recklessly and aided those who were there before them to draw out the injured and dead from under the wreckage.<br>
<br>
Torn and bruised men, women and children were carried to the street above. Some died as they were being placed in hacks to take them to the hospital. Others pleaded for their fathers or mothers or for their children. The sward was red with their blood.<br>
<br>
Little girls who a few moments before had been all decked out in their finery, little boys, their brothers in many cases, lay dead on the grass. Men and women with wide open, staring eyes lay with faces upturned, never to breathe again while horrible gashes on their persons told how they had come to their end.<br>
<br>
Tearful Parents.<br>
<br>
Here a mother, pale and tearful, cried for her children as kind hands endeavored to place her in a cab; there a child sat dazed and moaning and all about lay the dead.<br>
<br>
W.A. Wering stood with a happy smile on his blood stained face, holding in his arms his almost infant daughter, while two other daughters stood beside him. The girls had been in the wreck, and had escaped with some wounds, but none of a serious character. Mr. Wering praised God fervently for his children's fortunate escape.<br>
<br>
George Bott, proprietor of the Monogram saloon, was injured about the head and lower limbs. He told all he knew of the accident as he lay in the ambulance.   He said that he left his home on the car line at about 8 o'clock and managed to get on the rear platform. The car was crowded. He believed there were more than one hundred on board. They were mostly excursionists coming to Tacoma to view the Fourth of July parade. There were a few workmen and other passengers in the car. Women and children occupied about half the seats.<br>
<br>
Dashed Through the Bridge<br>
<br>
When the car reached Tacoma Avenue it seemed to gain speed. In a short time it was going down the hill with frightful rapidly. The men on the rear platform seemed to realize their danger for several of them dropped off. Then there was a rush to leave the car. Mr. Bott jumped just before it reached the bridge and fell on his side in the road. He lay there until he was helped to the ambulance. He thought at least twenty jumped before he left the
car.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Lee had five children with her on the car. She was badly injured and when she was carried out of the wreck she discovered her son, Lyman. He was also injured. She could not find the others and then her condition was such that she was gently compelled to enter a cab and go to the hospital. She sat on the seat with her boy in her arms.<br>
<br>
Her Children Killed.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Moser of South Tacoma, had three children with her when she entered the car. One, Herman, was saved and the other two were killed. The woman was too crazed with grief to give their names or ages. She was taken to the hospital.<br>
<br>
Joseph Longerman, his daughter, Berdene and his son Roy were all injured.<br>
<br>
("Two score killed in street car wreck, frightful plunge over a high bridge sends a happy Fourth of July crowd into eternity and saddens many homes," <B>Tacoma Daily Ledger.</B> July 5, 1900.).<br>
<br>
LIST OF THE INJURED SWELLS<br>
<br>
("List of the injured swells the total number of victims to over one hundred, thrilling stories of survivors," <B>Tacoma Daily Ledger.</B> July 5, 1900.).<br>
<br>
The girl declined to go until she saw her father and brother in a hack.  Little wounded children, separated from their parents, who were perhaps dead, were tenderly cared for by women and men living int he neighborhood. Many turned their eyes away as the victims were drawn from beneath the timbers of the car which had pinned them to the ground.<br>
<br>
Kind hearted people placed handkerchiefs over the faces of the dead until the undertaker's wagon came down loaded with coffins.  Then when the last body was carried away and the wounded were all being cared for at the hospitals or by physicians elsewhere the work of removing the wreck was begun.<br>
<br>
Passenger Told To Hold On<br>
<br>
The car ws one of the Tacoma Railway and Power Company's cars, leaving South Tacoma t 8:00 a.m. with Motorman F.L. Boehm and Conductor J. D. Calhoun.<br>
<br>
O.G. Brollar, a passenger, was on the front platform and escaped with a broken arm and a dislocated shoulder. He says there were about seventy-five or eighty passengers from Edison, Lake Park, Parkland and Lakeview.  Coming down the hill the car gained speed
rapidly and some passengers proposed to jump but were told to stay on and the speed was slacked a little.<br>
<br>
Then it against suddenly gained frightful headway, apparently being beyond control, and before the frightened passengers had hardly time to realize the situation the car went over the bank with a frightful crash and the victims were buried beneath the wreck.<br>
<br>
Working to Save Life.<br>
<br>
The car lay on the side of the hill, over one hundred feet from the track above and twenty or thirty feet from the bottom. Scores of men worked with an almost super human strength to raise the pieces of wreck and to lift out the bodies of the dead and dying. Boards from the car and pieces of cloth or carpet furnished a few stretchers which were used to carry away the dead and injured.<br>
<br>
The ascent from the bottom to the top of the hill was so steep that men could not climb it without the aid of ropes yet in some manner that the workers could not describe now, they staggered up the include with the bodies of the dead and in some cases with the living in their arms. From the top men rushed down to assist them and the bodies wherever possible were carried to the top and laid out in the tall wet grass.<br>
<br>
On both sides of the road lay the dead in groups. friends too busy then at the work of rescue to look for the dead or attempt identification. Tenderly the faces were covered with clothing and the dead lay there awaiting the coming of the wagons which would carry them to the morgues.<br>
<br>
Morgue at Pumping Station.<br>
<br>
Down in the gulch runs a stream of water, a foot deep in some places and five or six feet in width. About three hundred feet above the bridge is the city pump station. Here and there fallen logs furnished a natural bridge across the small stream and  boards have been laid to furnish other crossings.<br>
<br>
To use the pumping station as a temporary morgue and hospital seemed best. Scores of physicians every one in the city would could be summoned at once were working at the scene of the accident and a corps was sent to the pumping station to take charge.<br>
<br>
Fireman, policemen, and volunteers carried the dead and dying to the temporary morgue. Women, men and children, for the most part, bore up with heroic fortitude or were screaming with the awful pain of internal injuries and broken bones.<br>
<br>
It was a frightful trip to contemplate and a terrible one to endure. Rescuers could not do more but the rough and broken gulch bottom, the lack of supplies it was impossible to furnish more
carrying the victims a hard and difficult task.<br>
<br>
Men tried to be tender as they picked up bruised and maimed. Four lifted carefully at broken and bruised arms, legs, and bodies, careful always to support every part of the body that appeared to be injured, but the journey was one that made comfort impossible.<br>
<br>
The rescuers could not walk on the narrow bridges across the gulch and at every few steps someone was plunging into the icy waters, then struggling up to carry the injured to a resting place. The rescuers forgot the water and overlooked the frail bridges.<br>
<br>
They plunged into the stream, crossing it three and four times to reach the pumping station, or wading its length because the bottom was more level and it seemed merciful to give the injured the benefit, though the rescuers were suffering.<br>
<br>
Up to the pumping station the great engine and pump room was quickly cleared of all furniture and everything that interfered with the physicians. In the office on the floor of the engine room, between the mighty pumps that were forcing water into the city reservoir and stand pipes, in the furnace room, and outside on the bare cold ground the injured were tenderly laid.<br>
<br>
Nurses Give Aid<br>
<br>
Nurses from the Fanny Paddock hospital, priests from nearby Catholic Churches, physicians and volunteers made the injured easy. Wherever possible their injuries were dressed or the injured were temporarily relieved for the ride to the hospitals. The dangerous cases received more extended attention, one or two physicians devoting their entire attention to those whom it appeared could only be saved by prompt attention.<br>
<br>
Now and then a victim would throw back his head, a "gurgle" would come from his throat and another victim had been added to the growing list of the dead. Out in the grass near the running stream, almost in the water itself, the row of dead at the temporary morgue were laid.<br>
<br>
Women seemed to predominate here, but there were men in the roy who had passed beyond the aid of the medical staff.<br>
<br>
Taken to Hospitals<br>
<br>
A wagon road comes down the steep grade back of the pumping station. Down this road dashed hose wagons, the city ambulance, patrol wagon, express wagons, and carriages. Into these conveyances the injured were placed for the ride to the hospitals. It was in many instances a case of life or death to get patients where medical treatment could be given and wagons and carriages dashed up the hill with loads heavier than it had
ever been intended by their builders they should carry.<br>
<br>
The city ambulance, constructed for one patient carried three; the patrol wagon carried a man on a stretcher and a volunteer sat on a seat holding a severely injured man on the seat opposite.<br>
<br>
The victims of the disaster rode off quietly. There was little moaning or crying among the injured. Many were still unconscious while others bore the pain with a look of resignation on their faces that indicated they were prepared for any contingency.<br>
<br>
A young girl with a terrible injury drove away with a smile on her face and a small boy only asked to be turned on his face so he could bear the pain of internal injuries more comfortably. A man suggested he could probably ride easier on his side, but did not complain of the legs that hung limp, indicating they were broken at the ankles and the two broken arms hanging by his side.<br>
<br>
Last Body Taken Out<br>
<br>
The last of the injured had been sent to the hospital before 9:00 o'clock, just a few minutes after the rescuers had taken the last body from the wreck. This was the body of G. McMillin who was found well forward and half the car had to be moved before he could be reached.<br>
<br>
Then the removal of the dead began. The bodies were loaded into express wagons, carriages form the morgues and in some cases placed in wooden boxes and laid aside for another load of the express wagons. One express wagon moved to the morgue with nine bodies as its share of the load of death.<br>
<br>
Out of the wreckage came some who could help themselves, but these were few. O.M. Park escaped with only a slight bruise to his leg and a small baby and a four year old by were picked up badly frightened but not severely injured.<br>
<br>
Strange Baby Found<br>
<br>
A baby apparently six or eight months old was found suffering from bruises about the head. It had been discovered lying under a broken seat in the wrecked car. A blow on the head of not much force had shattered the little one's senses and it was picked up tenderly and carried to the top of the hill. The babe was handed to Mrs. Dick, who lives at 2413 1/2 Pacific Avenue.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Dick carried the little one in her arms for a short time and then delivered it to her sister, Mrs. Simmons who lives at the same places. Mrs. Simmons tried to summon a physician but none could be reached. They were all too busy at the hospitals. For a time she tried to care for the babe herself but later she sent it to the Fanny Paddock Hospital. Mrs. Dick accompanying the infant.<br>
<br>
No one knows the name of the little child. During all the time it
remained with the two women it showed no sign of returning consciousness. Only once did it open its eyes and then they were immediately closed again. No means of identification were found.<br>
<br>
Three Year Old Boy Uninjured<br>
<br>
A little three year old boy was rescued. He had miraculously escaped injury and a tailer, whose name was not known to the rescuing party handed the boy a dollar and turned him over to Mrs. E.C. Austin who lives at twenty-sixth and C Streets. Mrs. Austin took the lad home but he could not give his name.<br>
<br>
As nearly as it could be understood he is a Neeman, but his stories of himself differ. The boy is about three years of age, light complexioned, wears a white blouse with a navy blue coat. The coat is lined with red and the lad wore a red tie. His broad-
brimmed straw hat had a red band. His trousers, stockings and shoes were black.<br>
<br>
The boy may belong to one of the injured. Down among the group of injured and dying with a dead girl lying by her side, H. L. Hansen saw a women, looking about in a dazed manner and inquiring for her boy.  He had been seated on her lap at the time of the accident and she stated she heard her son call "Mamma" just as the car took its awful plunge. Then darkness came and when she had revived her boy was gone. The woman was carried away and Mr. Hansen lost track of her.<br>
<br>
Saw the Accident<br>
<br>
A seven year old son of John Deal stood on the banks of the gulch when the car leaped from the bridge. He had been playing near the scene and saw the car coming down the hill. He stood as if petrified while the car came sweeping down the street and followed its flight over the guard rail and into the gulch with staring eyes. The lad tells an interesting story of the disaster.<br>
<br>
He says the motorman was vainly trying to check the speed of the car as it came down the hill. "A man up on top," he explains, was trying to bring the car to a standstill. Then the car reached the fateful curve, men leaped from the platforms or were  hurled into the air to fall into the gulch beneath.<br>
<br>
The lad says the car seemed to give a bound, spring over the twelve inch timber at the side of the track, and after turning over twice struck with a terrific crash at the bottom of the gulch. Shrieks of the victims as the car made the plunge startled him and he sped away from the scene.<br>
<br>
All the eye witnesses claim the car turned over and this is the theory of the street car company. Mrs dick and her husband were standing at their window on Pacific Avenue as the car came down the hill and saw it leap into the gulch. They state the can
turned over before it struck the ground. Then came the cries of the victims and they hurried away to give all the relief possible.<br>
<br>
Had a Narrow Escape<br>
<br>
A passenger who escaped injury by almost a miracle is Frank Halverson, of Parkland. He was thrown from the front platform of the car just before it reached the bridge and was slightly bruised about the face.<br>
<br>
He boarded the car at Edison junction. At that time it was crowded to the doors. The front and rear platforms were crowded and he managed to find a place on the front steps. When the brow of the hill south of the bridge ws reached Halverson says the motorman turned on the current and then seemed to lose control of the car.<br>
<br>
It began to gain speed and several men attempted to jump off. Two men, however, prevented them from doing so and the car swung along at a frightful speed.  When Tacoma avenue was reached the speed ws terrific. As the car passed the water tank Halverson felt it give a sudden jerk and the next instant he was pitched from the car head foremost. He landed on his hands and knees and when he realized what had happened his head was buried in some berry bushes.<br>
<br>
The car continued on its wild journey. Halverson saw a man jump off just before the bridge was reached and strike a log and then roll over. Others followed him from the car.At the bridge the car seemed to pause a moment while those on the front platform dropped to the gulch below and then the front wheels feel on the unfortunates and the car broke in two and followed into the gulch. The other half of it rolled off the bridge almost instantly afterward.<br>
<br>
Halverson shut his eyes when he spoke of the scene of horror  that he saw afterward. He said it caused him to feel faint.<br>
<br>
Motorman did his duty.<br>
<br>
D.H. Seacon, of San Francisco, was on the ill fated car. He had just come up to Tacoma to renew acquaintance with some of the members of the old First Washingtons whom he had known in Manila, where he was a member of Company H. First Montana.<br>
<br>
He had been on a visit to Mrs. G.W. Flemming, and was accompanying her and her children to Tacoma to see the parade. He was on the rear platform and jumped off before the car struck the bridge and escaped unhurt.<br>
<br>
"I heard the motorman try his current three times," he said, "and
then I heard the fuse blow out. The car was running at a frightful rate of speed and I realized that the man at the brake had lost control.  I have heard since the accident that the motorman was drunk, but I do not believe it, and you can say for me that I think he did everything a mortal man could do to stop his car. The fuse blew out and that is all there is to it.<br>
<br>
Heroism of a woman<br>
<br>
"I served six years in the regular army and spent over a y ear in the Philippines, but I never witnessed such a bloody sight as I saw in that gulch after the car went over. I was for several years on the wrecking train on the Southern Pacific in California and in all my experience I never saw a more total wreck. As ssn as I could pull myself together I hurried to the wreck.<br>
<br>
" I suppose I must have been somewhat stunned by the fall I got, as all I remember about it is that I worked as hard as I could pulling men, women, and children from under the debris. As long as I live I will never forget the splendid heroism of a dark little woman who was one of the first on the scene. She worked hard and directed the efforts of the men in the coolest manner imaginable. I would like to learn her name, so that I could tell her what I think of her."<br>
<br>
Mr. Seacon says he is going back to San Francisco today, as his visit has been soiled and he is half sick from the gruesome sights he saw in the gulch.<br>
<br>
Leaped for Life.<br>
<br>
John Wedemeyer, superintendent of the Tacoma cemetery was fortunate enough to escape serious injury. He leaped from the car just before it reached the bridge and although he is painfully injured he is thankful to have escaped so easily. He boarded the car at Edison and secured a place on the front platform near the motorman<br>
<br>
The latter he did not know, although he is a patron of the road. Mr. Wedemeyer said that there had been so many changes in the employees of the road recently that he had grown timid and was always watchful.<br>
<br>
When the car near the bridge yesterday morning  he saw that the motorman had lost control of it and he urged the men on the steps to leap. Two of them followed his advise and then he jumped himself. Before this the conductor rang the bell violently to stop and the motorman endeavored to obey the summons, but was unable to control the car, and it dashed off the bridge while Mr. Wedemeyer lay on the ground.<br>
<br>
Bridge is Closed<br>

After the disaster the bridge was immediately closed to all traffic by Chief of Police William Fackler and special policemen were stationed at each end to enforce the chief's orders. Later in the morning City Attorney W.P. Reynolds made an inspection of the bridge and found one of the bents had been injured. He instructed the chief of police to keep the bridge closed until the city engineer could make an investigation.<br>
<br>
City Engineer Taylor was out of the City yesterday and Owen Wood, the Tacoma Railway and Power Company's engineer, made an inspection of the bridge and track. He declared the structure was safe. Officials of he railway company and officers of the city went over the track and found none of the rails had been injured. The railway company then made application to have the bridge reopened.<br>
<br>
Mayor Louis D. Campbell, Councilman Holgate and General Manager Mitchell of the railway company made an inspection of the bridge yesterday afternoon. The party went direct to the injured portion of the structure and stood on a beam carefully examining the broken support. A voice from above order them away. No attention ws paid and then a rock was hurled dangerously near the party and again a command was given to move.<br>
<br>
Would arrest the Mayor<br>
<br>
Mayor Campbell looked in the direction of the voice and again turned to examine the wreck. Then J. W. Kendall moved out into sight and warned the party if it did not move immediately he would arrest them all and "...he did not care who they were."<br>
<br>
Mayor Campbell ordered Kendall not to interfere and then he cam down. He explained when he learned the identity of the party that Sheriff Mills, on behalf of the coroner, had taken charge of the wreck and placed Kendall and a man named Nellis in charge.<br>
<br>
Two cars were sent across the bridge and it did not appear to show any signs of weakness. the broken support was a part of the old wagon road bridge and had no connection with the street car company's bridge. Arvid Rydstromws sent down to examine the supports and upon his recommendation Mayor Campbell permitted the street car company to use the bridge.<br>
<br>
Coroner in Charge<br>
<br>
Coroner Hoska will remain in control of the bridge and the wreckage until the inquest is held. A coroner's jury will be summoned this morning. The jury will view the bodies and may adjourn until a later day before hearing the testimony of witnesses. The bodies will be delivered to relatives for burial as soon as the jury has seen them.<br>
<br>
The coroner's jury will make a thorough investigation into the accident and attempt to fix the responsibility definitely.  The
coroner is determined to learn the cause of the disaster and it may be some investigation will be made into the safety of the bridge and the track at that point.<br>
<br>
Mayor Louis D. Campbell will called the attention of the council to the accident tonight  and it is probable he will suggest a committee be appointed to make an investigation. The authority of the city is limited. The council may investigate and learn if the speed requirements of the city ordinances were observed and if the tract and bridge are in good and safe condition.<br>
<br>
As soon as City Engineer Taylor returns to the city he will be instructed to make an investigation of the roadbed and the bridge to determine whether the track is safe and cars should be permitted to operate on the line.<br>
<br>
Pathetic Scenes<br>
<br>
The scenes at the hospitals and morgues were pathetic at all times and there were times when it seemed as though the spectators' hearts would break with those of relatives and friends. Mothers swooned at the morgue in front of the bodies of their sons or daughters, wives broke into tears and men wept without restraint as they gazed upon the distorted and mangled features of friends or relatives.<br>
<br>
Children that were left fatherless, parents who were bereft of their children, friends who had waited for acquaintances to come to the city, relatives who were drawn to the morgue by a premonition that evil had befallen those they had dearest, sobbed out their grief that was only expressed by staring eyes, ears that heard not a sound that was made about them,voices that spoke without understanding and a general appearance of numbness that could not be shaken off.<br>
<br>
It was the most pitiful of all griefs, for there is a relief in tears while the harder sorrow cannot be alleviated.<br>
<br>
At the hospitals it was a long wait for tidings from within. The operating room door kept hidden the secret that anxious friends and relatives would know. There were loved ones there whose lives hung by the slender thread that might be snapped at any time.<br>
<br>
Over their beds bent nurses struggling to keep the life blood flowing while outside friends waited with a dull feeling of dread until the silent watchers should give them word. Many were too seriously injured to be seen and it was only occasionally that word of their condition could be had.<br>
<br>
Searching anxiously at the hospitals first, then at the morgues and later at the homes of residents near the scene, where many who had expected friends on the car. they could not find a trace of the ones they sought and their position was even more painful
than those who had found the ones they were seeking. It was a long strain, too, for on a day like yesterday, it was a hard matter to locate another.<br>
<br>
Scene at St. Josephs<br>
<br>
The scene at St. Joseph Hospital as the loads of injured were brought up from the wreck was a pitiable one. Mingled with the moans and groans of the injured were the cries of relatives and friends trying to locate loved ones. Drs. McKone, Case, Libby, Parks and Rummel, with white aprons on and sleeves rolled to the elbow worked hastily by systematically, separating the seriously injured from those who had escaped more fortunately. The severe cases wee hurried to the operating room and the busy attendants carrying the wounded on stretchers formed a seemingly never ending procession.<br>
<br>
As fast as the wounds were dressed the  patients were carried to the wards and then the work of the nurses began. Their work was done silently and well. They brought order out of chaos, stilled the cries of the wounded, and with deft fingers ministered to their wants. A sister visited the different wards and soon had a complete list of the injured giving the name, residence and occupation, when it could be obtained.<br>
<br>
The sister in the children's ward is especially adapted for that work. In a short half hour after the wounds of the children had been dressed she had them in such good humor that several of them wee sitting up in bed propped up by pillows.  In the afternoon thoughtful women brought great bunches of roses, and these were distributed among the children.<br>
<br>
Working at Fannie Paddock<br>
<br>
The scene at the Fannie Paddock hospital, where forty of the wounded were taken was the same as at the other hospital. The attendants took hold the work with trained minds and soon had all the wounded in bed and as comfortable as possible.  Dr. McCutcheon is on Coney Island, but Mrs. McCutcheon took personal charge of affairs and the doctor himself could not have done the work better. She directed the corps of willing assistants in quick sharp commands and then wounded were handled expeditiously and well.<br>
<br>
Late in the afternoon Mrs. McCutcheon received a telegram from the doctor from Coney Island, expressing his horror at the terrible calamity and regretting that he could not be at home to assist.  Dr. H. Allan, surgeon for the Northern Pacific, had charge of the wounded, and he was able assisted in dressing the wounds by Drs. Wagner, Coleman, Armstrong, Shaver, Harrison and Misner.<br>
<br>
Druggist Cole ws of immense assistance to the newspaper men and friends of the patients to call at the hospital. In a remarkably
short time he had a complete list of all the wounded in the hospital with a brief description of their injuries and after the first rush of attending the injured was over, he assisted materially in assigning them to the different wards. The nurses all worked hard and kept at it all night long.<br>
<br>
Cried for her baby<br>
<br>
Mrs. Louis Dinger was the object of much attention from her friends and neighbors as she lay on her cot at the St. Joseph Hospital, almost unconscious from several broken ribs, a sprained ankle and a bruised hip. The dead body of her husband ws taken out of the bloody gulch. Her sister, Miss Effie Roberts lies just across the aisle, suffering from severe injuries.<br>
<br>
When the car went down Mrs. Dinger had her six months old baby on her lap and after the wreck the rescuers found the two bodies far apart. Mrs. Dinger was taken to the St. Joseph Hospital while the baby was taken to the Fannie Paddock as during the hurry of the rescue work there was no means of knowing to whom the baby belonged.<br>
<br>
All yesterday afternoon Mrs. Dinger tossed and moaned on her bed of pain, but her one thought seemed to be of her baby. She called out constantly for it and stretched  out her arms yearningly.  The soft spoken nurses had their hearts touched by the piteous pleading of a mother for her baby and did everything they could to relieve her mind.<br>
<br>
A kind hearted neighbor from Lakeview, where the Dingers live, told the stricken widow that her husband was killed, but she seemed too stunned from her own injuries and her anxiety to clasp her baby in her arms once more to realize the full significance of it. She did not mention the name of her husband once, while she called for her baby a hundred times.<br>
<br>
Mr. Dinger was engineer at the Lake Park rolling mills and left an insurance policy of a thousand dollars. Mrs. Dinger's parents in Oregon were telegraphed for.<br>
<br>
Wanted Firecrackers<br>
<br>
Little Willie Campbell, aged five years, was stunned when he arrived in the Hospital but after the nurses had washed up his bruises and he had a few hours sleep, he could not understand why he should stay in bed longer. He astonished the quiet nurse at the door by bounding out into the hall and wanting to know when he was to have "...the bunch of fire crackers."<br>
<br>
The little fellow knew that he had started out to celebrate the Fourth of July and could see no reason for further delaying it. The wreck of the car and the cries of the wounded and the blood bespattered bodies lying around had passed completely from his youthful mind.
The sister took the little fellow in her lap and answered his many questions with marvelous patience. Presently friends  came and took the little fellow home.<br>
<br>
Richard Sanburg died at the St. Joseph hospital about noon. He was unconscious when brought in, but revived presently and called constantly for Robert Rigney.  It was learned that the man worked for Mr. Rigney at Lkewview and in his partially delirious state he seemed to think that if Mr. Rigney would only come he would be able to do something to relieve his intense suffering.<br>
<br>
He talked almost up to the last breath and his last words were "Send for Robert Rigney." He bore up bravely under what must ha e been intense pain from horrible internal injuries.<br>
<br>
Got the Conductor's Cap.<br>
<br>
J.F. Calahan and seven year old son were on the rear of the car with the conductor who was killed when the car went over. The boy escaped with slight injuries an d in the rush at the St. Joseph's Hospital when carriage after carriage dashed up with its load of maimed and bruised bodies, Mr. Calahan was stored away in the basement. It was not until afternoon that room could be found for him. He lost his hat in the wreck and came to the hospital wearing the cap of the conductor.<br>
<br>
Birdena Lingerman and Tena Schweirow and sister left the St. Joseph hospital during the afternoon and went to the home of friends. A brother of Miss Lingerman was killed in the wreck and her father is badly injured. The wife and mother arrived during the afternoon and sat beside her husband. Although she clasped the body of his dead boy in his arms on the lawn in front of the hospital Mr. Lingerman did not seem to realize the fact as he talked to his wife. His one inquiry was to know "What has happened?"<br>
<br>
Artigis Pistolesi, a young Itanlan had his face crushed to a pulp and he seemed to have suffered terrible internal injuries. He cried like a baby while being carried into the St. Joseph Hospital and his cries could be heard all over the building.<br>
<br>
While the nurse was absent from the room for a moment he fairly writhed from his bed and the blood spouted out of his mouth, making a large dark spot on the carpet. He would have fallen on his face had not the nurse caught him. He lapsed into unconsciousness during the afternoon and it was only when some of his friends arrived that his name could be learned. He called for his mother, speaking Italian. It could not be learned where he lived.<br>
<br>
Eastern Men Hurt.<br>
<br>
John Lyberg, whose home is in Minneapolis, F.T. Startzell, who lives in Washington D.C. and Francis O'Hara, all young machinists
in the car shops were standing together on the rear platform when the car went down. Lyberg was taken to the St. Joseph Hospital and his two friends were taken to the Fanny Paddock. Lyberg said he realized that the car was running away, but that he could not reach the stops to jump off. His first intimation of the real danger, however, came when he saw the bridge looming up before him, and then came the leap through the air and when he woke up he was in the hospital with his head bandaged.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Charles O. Lee and two children, a boy and a girl are at the Fannie Paddock. Mrs. Lee lives in South Tacoma and her husband is a traveling man. She was bringing her five children in to see the parade. None of them sustained serious injuries though all are bruised and cut somewhat.<br>
<br>
Richard, seven years old, was killed outright and Lyman, his twin brother, and his sister are at the Fanny Paddock. Roscoe, another brother, was taken to the St. Joseph but was not hurt much. The baby, a year old, is missing, but is said to be with a family in the Sixth Addition. Mr. Lee was in Medford, Oregon, last night on his way home, and he telephoned his brother, H.M.Lee that he would reach Tacoma tonight.<br>
<br>
Fleming Children Are Found<br>
<br>
The two Fleming children have been found. The little girls, Deil and Berje were missing after the wreck until late last evening when they were found at home, where some of the neighbors had taken them. They are now at the home of their uncle at 733 C Street and are doing nicely. They have several slight bruises, but nothing of a serious nature. They were on the rear platform when the car went over, and none of them fell off the bridge.<br>
<br>
Miss Lizzie Patterson daughter of ex-Councilman Patterson, of South Tacoma and Miss Ethel Withers were together in the car when it went over the bridge. Miss Patterson was uninjured save for a few scratches and the result of shock and was driven home in a carriage. Miss Withers did not escape so fortunately as she is at the Fanny Paddock hospital with several cuts about the head and face.<br>
<br>
A Pathetic Incident.<br>
<br>
One of the most pathetic incidents of the disaster was witnessed at the entrance of St. Joseph Hospital when a carriage was driven up containing J.B. Lingerman of South Tacoma, and his son, aged about sixteen. The father was able to walk when he alighted form the carriage, but the boy was  dead. He had passed away on the way to the hospital but the father did not know it.<br>
<br>
When the dead lad was removed from the carriage and laid out on the green lawn near the entrance the father fell upon him and had to be almost literally torn away from his son so strong was his
embrace of the dead boy.<br>
<br>
Even then he did not realize that the boy was dead and talked in a dazed sort of way about his boy and asked repeatedly whether he did not have his daughter with him. The dead boy is Roy Lingerman. Together with their father, Roy and his sister Burdoena, left South Tacoma on the fated car. The father is seriously injured but will likely recover. He is injured internally and his left eye is badly damaged.<br>
<br>
The young girl left the hospital late in the afternoon. The body of the dead boy together with that of the boy aged about fourteen who ws unknown at the hospital was removed at noon to Mellinger's undertaking rooms.<br>
<br>
At the Morgue<br>
<br>
The scene at the morgue was a pitiful one. Bodies were brought in bruised and managed almost beyond recognition. It seemed as though the doomed passengers had been hurled forward to fall with a terrible force on their heads. Skulls cracked like egg shells and the bruises and cuts about the faces and heads of the victims left little of the original likeness to many.<br>
<br>
Blood stained and crushed the faced presented a most ghastly sight. Clothing was reeking in blood and many of the victims had broken arms and legs in addition to other injuries. All, apparently, were injured internally as well, though as a rule death was undoubtedly caused by bruise on the head.<br>
<br>
One unknown man lies on a slab at Hoska's. His head is bruised and crushed beyond recognition. Half of the skull has been torn away by a fearful force and on the body especially the legs are bruises and cuts that show the victim must have been buried deep in the wreck and to have been struck by a force that crushed life out instantly.  He probably never knew what had occurred.<br>
<br>
May be an iron molder<br>
<br>
The man may be an iron molder. His hands indicate that he worked at some such trade. What is left of his clothing betokens the laboring man, though the clothes he wore are torn to shreds. Fife and York have been suggested as his name, but no one is positive he knows the man. Only a car ticket or two were found in his pockets and the attendants at the morgue were compelled to cover up the form and county him as the  "unknown dead."<br>
<br>
An arm, cut off almost as clean as though it had been done with a surgeon's knife, was picked up by one of the rescuers and placed with one of the bodies which were sent to Hoska's. It was evidently the arm of a young boy, but it belonged to none of the bodies at the undertaking parlors.<br>

A large amount of clothing found near the wrecked car was sent to the undertaking houses. Some of the clothing belonged to those who had been killed but a part was the property of injured persons sent to the hospital. This led to some confusion as friends and relatives called to inquire for loved ones and finding the clothing were led to believe the ones sought were dead.<br>
<br>
Waiting for tidings.<br>
<br>
Almost from the time reports began to come of the accident people gathered in front of the undertaking houses to await returns. The crowd in front of the coroner's office was densest. Men, women and children waited eagerly for the bodies to arrive. Many were drawn by curiosity,but there were scores who had friends on the car and who were anxious to know their fate.<br>
<br>
Even after the bodies had arrived it was some time before the doors could be thrown open and the crowd admitted. It was a sickening task to prepare the bodies of the dead for the inspection of friends and for their identification. Many had not even as much as a scrap of paper to show their name or residence and these had to be restored to their life-like condition and the bruises concealed as much as possible to enable identification.<br>
<br>
The crowd outside the doors waited persistently. Until nearly two o'clock scarcely one moved away and when the doors were opened to admit a few at a time the crowd pushed and jostled forward to enter.<br>
<br>
Those who were believed to be able to identify some of the dead were admitted first where ever possible and practically all the victims had been identified by 5:00 o'clock.<br>
<br>
Many women faint<br>
<br>
The strain was too much for many relatives, especially the women. Several women swooned and had to be attended by the morgue employees. Others wept almost hysterically before the rigid forms of friends and relatives while the men were affected just as deeply. Some of the women attempted to stop in front of the dead lying on the slabs and now and then an attempt was made to embrace the form of a loved one. The employees of the undertaking rooms interfered mercifully and assisted those so affected from the room.<br>
<br>
Curiosity drew many of the crowd. These gazed with interest on the forms of the dead and passed on hurriedly. Others did not wait to look at all the bodies but turned away when the horrible effects of the accident came home to them and hastened from the room.<br>

Was An Accident.<br>
<br>
Street railway officials claim the disaster was the result of an accident and one entirely unforeseen and impossible to have prevented. An officer of the road stated last night that the company recovered the register and this showed sixty-six fares<br>
The number of children on the car is not, of course, included and the commuters state their tickets are never rung on the register. Estimated on the basis of the dead and injured it is believed about one hundred passengers were on the car, and this is the number the street car officials estimate.<br>
<br>
The street railway company as soon as the disaster was known directed the hospitals to prepare to receive all the injured. Every physician the company could secure was sent to the scene and since then the hospitals and physicians have been directed to treat the injured at the expense of the company.<br>
<br>
General Superintendent F.L. Dame gave an explanation of the disaster yesterday. He said:<br>
<br>
"The car was in charge of Motorman Braehm and Conductor Calhoun. Mr. Braehm is an experienced man and was selected for the South Tacoma run on account of his experience. He was for nine years an employee of a Cincinnati electric line and thoroughly competent. Conductor Calhoun had been working for the company about two months.<br>
<br>
"I posted an order at the street car barn last night (Tuesday) instructing all street car employees not to attempt to keep on schedule time on the Fourth. They were told to pay the utmost attention to the safety of passengers and to be especially careful about teams and pedestrians who might be on the tracks. This applied to all lines as well as the South Tacoma system.<br>
<br>
Car in Good Order.<br>
<br>
"The car was in perfect condition. Braehm was at the car barn Tuesday night working on the car. He took out the old sand and put in new; tested his brakes and the current. The brakes did not fail, for an examination shows they were not broken. I understand the motorman tested his sand at the top of the hill.<br>
<br>
"Just how the car got beyond the motorman's control is not known. The rail was bad, and it may have started to slip. There was just enough mist and rain to make the rails slippery, and the sand may not have been sufficient to hold the car. It certainly got a start and the brakes would not hold it.<br>
<br>
"The current was reversed as a last resort. There was not much chance of its holding, as it is apt to burn out as soon as the first notch is reached. That is probably what it did, but the
only chance of stopping the car was to turn on a reversed current.<br>
<br>
Speed Was Terrific.<br>
<br>
"The car must have come down at a terrific rate of speed for it leaped the track clear over the guard rail. The curve is an unusually high one, and under ordinary circumstances, there would not have been any danger. The guard rail and timber did not stop the car; in fact a stone wall would have been of no use.<br>
<br>
"The brakes on the car were found half set. Little can be told from this, however, as the fall would have dislocated the brakes. It is probable they were set on as hard as possible. The trucks and motor were not destroyed but the rest of the car is ruined.<br>
<br>
"The accident is a most terrible and deplorable one, but it is one that could not have been foreseen and is purely the result of causes over which we had no control."<br>
<br>
There was a strong feeling against the railway company manifest on the streets and wherever men congregated last night. Threats against officers of the company were made in some quarters and the sheriff's office and police took immediate steps to quell the impending disturbance. Sheriff Mills last night issued the following warning:<br>
<br>
"The authorities are preparing to make a thorough investigation of the wreck at the C Street bridge and the causes that led up to it. In the meantime both Coroner Hoska and myself would advise the public to await the results of a fair investigation and not to attempt any inflammatory demonstration which would injure rather than aid the cause of justice.<br>
<br>
A.U. Mills,<br>
Sheriff of Pierce County."<br>
<br>
Accidents on the grade<br>
<br>
The Delin street grade has been fated for accidents. Twice during the days the old motor line ran to Oakes addition lives were lost by accidents on the street and since the electric line was built there has been one other accident beside that of yesterday.<br>
<br>
This was during the time the line was under the management of the Tacoma Traction Company. A car jumped the track at the C Street curve but did not gove over the bridge.<br>
<br>
It was on this grade that two motor cors collided with force about ten years ago and half a dozen men were maimed and at least one death occurred. It was on Sunday and both trains were heavily loaded with pleasure parties, either bound to or returning from Wapato Lake. The list of injured was confined to those on the
platforms.<br>
<br>
A steam motor leaped over the bank and into the gulch during the time the steam road was operated. A worman lost her life in this accident.<br>

<br>
EIGHT MORE OF THE VICTIMS OF THE WRECK MAY DIE<br>
<br>
(Eight more of the victims of the wreck may die at the hospitals. No hope of their recovery is entertained by nurses and physicians," <B>Tacoma Daily Ledger.</B> July 6, 1900.).<br>
<br>
At a meeting of the City Council last night councilman Jones, of the Sixth Ward, introduced a resolution extending condolence to families bereaved by the plunging of the street car over the bridge and callling attention to the fact that the street railway company overloads its cars and runs them too fast.<br>
<br>
The resolution was adopoted unanimously, but not until nearly every member of the council had something to say on the subject. Some of the members condemned the company outright and made the charge that incompetent men were employed, while others counseled withholding blame until the corner's jury has investigated the facts and renders a verdict. The resolution as originally introduced reads as follows:<br>
<br>
"Whereas, a most horrible accident carrying death and disaster to many of our people occurred, on the morning of July 4 at the 26th Street bridge on the Edison line of the Tacoma Railway and Power Company, and<br>
<br>
"Whereas, said accident occurred when the car of said company was running beyond all reasonable speed; and<br>
<br>
"Whereas, said accident occurred when said Tacoma Railway and Power company was carrying passengers on a car loaded beyond all reasonable limit; and<br>
<br>
"Whereas, said Tacoma Railway and Power Company has persisted in running cars upon its lines in this city bgeyond all reasonable speed; and<br>
<br>
"Whereas, there is no state commission whose duty it is to supervice the competency of street car employes of our state; therefore be it<br>
<br>
"Resolved that the city council do hereby pass resolutions of sympathy and condolence to the bereaved families and the afflicted ones; and be it further<br>

"Resolved that the city council, with a vew toward the prevention of a recurrence of such a deploable accident, do hereby take such measures as we deem wise and fitting by instructin gthe city attorney to immediatley prepare an ordinance controlling and reglating the street car traffice in our city; that he be instructed to draft said ordinance so that the speed of cars be brought within the limit of safety; that the overloading of cars beyond the seating capacity of each car be forbidden and that the placing of incompetent and unskilled men in charge of the cars either as condutor or as motorman be condemned and forbidden as a menace to the safety of the public; and be it further<br>
<br>
"Resolved that we do hereby memorialize the legislature of the State of Washington  at its first session hereafter to pass a law ordering the forming of a commission to examine into the fitness and capabilities of street railway conductors and motormen, so that only competent and skilled men be permitted to have charge of street cars."<br>
<br>
Curve is always dangerous<br>
<br>
Hewitt said he hoped it would be possible to compel the company to change the right of way of the line at that point as with a heavy grade and a sharp curve  on the high bridge, it would always be dangerous no matter how competent the employes are. He made the statement that but one man has been discharged from the line in the past year and a half, and that the motorman on the wrecked car was a man of much experience in Cincinnati and other cities.<br>
<br>
"How many new men have there been on your line?" he asked Mr. Jones. Jones--The change them so often that I cannot keep track of them.<br>
<br>
Many incompetent men<br>
<br>
Boardman--Perhaps Mr. Jones is like I am. The incompetent men on the street car lines of the city are so many that it is impossible to keep track of them. Every day there are incompetent men on the Old Town line. Only the other day a passenger on one of the Old Town cars asked to be let off at Tacoma Avenue and the conductor asked the passenger to tell him when the car reached Tacoma Avenue as he did not  know the streets.<br>
<br>
Dueval called attention to the terrific rate of speed the Old Town and Sixth avenue cars attain running down C street, and said a dozen teams had been run into in the past year. It was useless, he said, to speak to Superintendent Dame about cars running fast, as the superintendent had an unpleasant habit of asking objectors what they know about speed.<br>
<br>
Roice also spoke of the number of new and incompetent men now employed by the street car company.<br>

President Smith though Hewitt's suggestion to change the line in order to do away with the curve was the only sensible solution of the problem, and that the ordinance now in force regulating the speed of street cars in enough; all that it needs is enforcement.<br>
<br>
Man at motor was new<br>
<br>
Jones--I have been told by employes of the company that the morotman on the wrecked car never came down that hiill in h is life before, and that he turned on the current right at the top of the hill.<br>
<br>
Roberts--On account of it being a holiday, Wednesday, the service on the Edison line ws doubled and men from other lines in the city were used on the line in order to handle the crowds.<br>
<br>
Boardman--The second clause of Mr. Jones' resolution states that the car was running beyond all reasonable speed and that is something none of us know anything about. So I offer the following as a substitute for that section:<br>
<br>
"Whereas, public opinion condemns the present location of the car line on the side hill  where the accident occurred yesterday; therefore be it<br>
<br>
"Resolved, That the city attorney be directed to examine the franchise of the company and also the laws of the state and see if there is any way that the present location can be condemned as dangerous to life, and said location of the line be ordered changed."<br>
<br>
Day counseled going slow in the matter, as the action of the council might prejudice the cornor's jury now investigating the case.<br>
<br>
Inquest on Monday.<br>
<br>
The inquest over the bodies of the victims of Wednesday's street car wreck will be held in Judge Kean's court room at l:00 o'clock Monday afternoon. About twenty-five witnesses will be called by the coroner and examined by the jurty.<br>
<br>
Everyone who saw the accident, several of those on the car and experts who have examined the track and position of the wreck since will testify. The sheriff and coroner are now summoning witnesses.<br>
<br>
The coroner's jury is: F.T. Olds, flour manufactuers; Peter Irving, capitalist; J.H. Babbitt, clerk; John R. Turner, manager for Fawcett Wagon Company; Charles H. Plass, grocer; Charles D. Atkins, South Tacoma. The jury was summoned to meet at 10 o'clock yesterday morning.<br>
<br>
There were thirty-seven bodies at the undertkaing rooms when the
jury was empaneled and these were viewed. As soon as the bodies had been viewed the coroner released them to their relatives or friends.<br>
<br>
Coroner holds the wreck<br>
<br>
The jury went from the morgue to the scene of the street car accident. An inspection was made of the bridge and then the six men dropped over the bluff and went down to the wrecked car as it lay near the bottom of the gluch. A careful inspection was made of both the ruined car and the broken bridge supports. The jury finally decided to order the wreck to remain as it was until after the inquest.<br>
<br>
The coroner is still in charge of both the bridge and wreck. Deputy sheriffs are on duty there and acting under his instructions will permit no one to go near the scene. It is intended the wreck shall not be disturbed until the jury has reached some conclusion in the matter.<br>
<br>
Blackman holds an inspection<br>
<br>
State Railiway, Mill and Factory Inspector William Blackman also made an inspection of the wreck and tracks yesterday. He went over the grade on Delin Street examining the track from the top of the hill, investigated the curve on the bridge and then looked over the wrecked street car. He paid particular attention to the condition of the rails and the wheels of the car. speaking last night of the result of his investigation, he severely condemned the roadbed at that point.<br>
<br>
"I do not think the curve is wide enough for such a grade," he said." The city council that granted a franchise to the street car company should never have permitted it to lay its tracks in such a manner. Of course the franchise was granted years ago and the present council has nothing to do with the matter, but the old body should have exercised more caution.<br>
<br>
"I found the inside of the outer rail was much worn. The wheelers of the car as the curve is passed do not roll around but rather bump over the curve and on such a rail the danger of their jumping the track is much greater. New rails should have been put in before the track became so worn.<br>
<br>
"An examination of the trucks shows that two new wheels had recently been put on the car. It cannot be told definitely from the position of the car, but I believe these were on the rear truck as the car was approaching the city.  The flanges on what wee probably the front truck wheels were badly worn. New wheels were needed.<br>
<br>
"The car must have been running at a very high rate of speed when it left the track. It is not clear from an examination of the
track just how the car when over the bridge. Tehre are not marks on the high guard rail to show it had struck there and there are few marks of the car on the bridge itself. It probably struck the rail at the curve and leaped over, turning completely over in the fall.<br>
<br>
"At such sharp curves as that at the end of the bridge railroad companies all over the country place an open switch leading to a sidetrack running up  a steep grade. In case of a runaway the open swith sends the train onto the sidetrack and it runs up the grade and its speed is exhausted. Accidents are few under such circumstances.<br>
<br>
""The street railroad company should have one of those witches at the bridge. The open swith would run on Delin street down the bicycle path and the car wold come to a stop either on the switch or runn off onto Pacific avenue. If there is a possibility of building a steep grade this would be better.   This would compel every car bound toward the city to stop at the curve and throw the switch and would result in reducing the danger to a minimum.<br>
<br>
"I do not know how an easier grade down the side of the gulch could be found, but I did not examine the street carefully."<br>
<br>
Sorrow at the homes.<br>
<br>
At South Tacoma, Lakeview, Parkland and Lake Park, where practically all the victims of the disaster lived, a feeling of desolation and an air of gret grief was apparent.  Lake Park suffered the heaviest for nearly all the residents of that suburb who were on the car were either instantly killed or died later of their injuries.<br>
<br>
The entire suburb was grief-stricken, and those w<br>
ho did not lose friends or relatives on the car spent the day consoling the griefg stricken friends and relatives of the victims. Some of the best known residents of Lake Park and Parkland were killed in the wreck, and it was an especially hard blow for those two suburbs to bear. Lakeview shared in the loss but not so heavily.<br>
<br>
South Tacoma appeared to be bewildered yesterday by the great shock, Eleven of those killed in the wreck had been employes of the car shops, while at the hospitals another man lay hovering between life and death, and thirteen  more were suffered from injuries. In other families children or wives had either been killed or had been severely injured.<br>
<br>
Mourning for the dead<br>
<br>
The suburb was in mourning for its dead. Flags hung at half mast and at the car shops employes were continually asking for information regarding the welfare of men they had worked with for years. Not many married men had been killed, but the death list
included some of the most popular railroad men in South Tacoma.<br>
<br>
The predominance of single men was marked. There were many married men from South Tacoma on the car, but they were fortunte enough to escape with lighter injuries. The single men, chidlren and girls seemed fated to lose their lives.<br>
<br>
The railroad men are caring for their dead and are offering every attention to the living who are lying at the hospitals. Master Mechanic H.H.Warner searched all over the city yesterday, among the hopsitals and at the undertaking parlors, to locte the men from the car shops and all railroad men who had been injured or killed.<br>
<br>
A careful list was prepared which showed the following railroad men had been killed:<br>
<br>
Car Shop's List.<br>
<br>
Robert Steele, rivet heater<br>
E.E. Bray, boiler maker<br>
G. McMillin, machine hand.<br>
C.W. Woodruff, bulldozer man.<br>
A.T. Silfberg, driller<br>
Gorton Newton, car repairer<br>
W.L. Williams, car repairer<br>
C.D. Davis, machinist's helper<br>
Roger Lingerman, employee of the depot agent.<br>
G. Vanderschelden, blacksmith<br>
G.H. Gaul, store helper.<br>
<br>
At the hospitals were these railroad men:<br>
J.B. Lingerman, foreman of the store laborers.<br>
J.J. Jaeger, blacksmith's helper<br>
F.T. Startzel, machinist.<br>
Frank O'Hara, machinist.<br>
Alfred Anderson, car builder<br>
Anton Hanson, blacksmith's helper<br>
Ole Friberg, carpenter.<br>
M.M.Hosking, fireman<br>
Samuel Mathews, car repairer's helper<br>
J.A. Lyberg, machiist.<br>
G.A. Swanson, car repairer<br>
Otto Johnson, machine hand.<br>
O.M. Parks, superintendent's clerk.<br>
H.L. Weir, night operator.<br>
<br>
The railroad men will care for these men. They are all entitled to the sick and death benefits which are provided by the men and unless objection is made by the relatives he dead men will be buried by their fellow employes.  Both Mr. Watner and General Foreman Gilman will watch the men at the hospital carefully to furnish them any needed assistants and the company surgeons have
been instructed to attend them.<br>
<br>
Two More Are Dead<br>
<br>
Bray, one of the dead railroad men, died about 2 o'clock yestereday afternoon at the Fanny Paddock Hospital. His death had been prematurely announced the day before.  The attending physicians had given up all hope of saving his life, but they continued the fight against big odds in the hope of saving him.<br>
<br>
Mrs.Emma Flemming also died at the Fannie Paddock hospital during the day. She had been one of the most seriously injured of the victims and her death had been expected momentarily ever since the accident. Her death swelled the total number of deat to thirty-nine.<br>
<br>
While their mother lay dying at the Fanny Paddock hospital two of the Flemming children were at the St. Joseph's Hospital under the care of the nurses there. Little Dot Flemming, whose left arm is broke, and whose head had been severely bruised, lay on her bed of pain without uttering a word of protest or complaining of her conditiion. Her brother lay in a ward below her. Both children were ignorant of their mother's death.<br>
<br>
Visitors are Kept Out<br>
<br>
Visitors are not permitted to see the victims of the wreck  at either of the hospitals. The conditionof many of them is so precarious that nay interference would seriously impair their chances of recovery. Several of them are believed to be beyond human aid, but the nurses and physicians are working hard to save life.<br>
<br>
Five were able to go home yesterday. One of these was fron the Fanny Paddock hospital and the other two from the St. Joseph's. Little Goldie and Bernice Hoffman were taken to the home of friends. Their father and mtoehr lie side by side at the St. Joseph's Hospital, the mother painfully bruised and suffering equally as much over the condition of her husband.<br>
<br>
The condition of Mr. Hoffman is serious, but he will recover. Neither father nor mother can be removed at prsent, but the faces of both sufferers lighted up with joy when they learned yesterday that their children were able to go to the home of friends. The two little girls bade a fond goodbye to their parents last night.<br>
<br>
Leave the Hospital<br>
<br>
Herman Moser and Oscar Brottem have not yet recovered, but both were able to leave the hospital and they were taken away. Young Moser has a broken leg and Brottem's sholder was dislocated. The injuries of both are expected to be healed within a short time.<br>
<br>
Russell Hays was discharged from the Fanny Paddock hospital. His
injuries were principally bruises, more painful than serious, and he was able to return to his home yesterday.<br>
<br>
H.L. Wier is at the Fanny Paddock hospital in precarious condition. A consultation of physicians was held on his case yesterday morning and Drs. Hamilton Allen, the Northern Pacific's local surgeon, and T.F. Smith, the street railway company's surgeon, operated on him. He was sent back to his ward after undegoing the operation and some hopes of his recovery are entertained.<br>
<br>
More will die.<br>
<br>
At the St. Joseph's hosptial several deaths are expected though the hospital has thus far been unusally successful in its cases. But few have died from their injuries and the most serious cases are doing well. A number of volunteer nurses including representatives from the Red Cross are assisting the sisters.<br>
<br>
An unknown man is still unconscious at the hospital. He is injured seriously about the head and his chances of recovery are slim. Earl Hoskins has not yet recovered consciousness. His injuries are to the head and his condition is alarming.<br>
<br>
Little or no hope is felt for five patients in the female wards. Their condition is so alarming that the nurses are compelled to be with them constantly, and it is regarded as only a question of a few hours before they will have succumbed to their injuries<br>
<br>
Three on one family killed<br>
<br>
Mrs. Louis Dinger may pull through. Several bones are broke, but the critical stage has passed ans she is gathering strength. By her side lies little Vida Dinger, scarcely injured, but her mother finds her presence a gret comfort and she is permitted to remain in the hospital. In another room lies the little 10 months<br>
babe the mother was calling for the day before. The babe is severely injured and for twenty-hours has been beyond the aid of medical skill. Severe bruises about the head made it certain that the little one will die, but the nurses have worked faithfully to restore life to the little frame.<br>
<br>
From Wednesday night to Thursday afternoon the babe was continually going into convulsions, but though it seemed it would die at any minute, it hung tenaciously to life. The mother was told of the baby's condition and has become reconciled.<br>
<br>
When the baby dies three out of a family of five will have been killed by the accident and a fourth member, the mother is severely injured. Only the daughter Vida escaped without serious injury. Dorothy and Louis Dinger are now at the morgue.<br>
<br>
                          She cannot recover
Sophie Storasli cannot recover. Her skull is crushed and her face is swollen to an unusual degree. A nurse is constantly at her side, but the girl has only recovered cinsciousness for a few moments since the accident. She has spoke a few words and then lapsed again into unconsciousness.<br>
<br>
Mrs. M. G. Swanson's skull is crushed and no hope of her recovery is entertained. She has been unconscious ever since the wreck and it is doubtful whether she will ever be able to speak.  Her death may occur at any time. A piece of bone was removed by the surgeons from her brain.<br>
<br>
Paulina Christenden has spoken a few words in her native tongue, and though they could not be understood, it is believed they were not connected and did not indicate that she has returned to consciousness. She is very restless and her condition is most serious. Her recovery is questionable and at first the physicians held out no hope.<br>
<br>
There is little hope of the recovery of Hilda Glano, a nine year old girl at St. Joseph's Hospital. Her right leg is broke, two serious cuts wee made on the left leg and her head is bruised and crushed and internal injuries are shown by the child's restless complaints of injuries about her body.<br>
<br>
It was learned yesterday that three sisters had been taken from the wreck direct to theirhome in South Tacoma. They are Veda, Mary and Gladys Waring. Miss Veda Waring is a fourteen year old girl. She was bruised severely about the face and has a cut on her leg.<br>
<br>
Twelve year old Mary Waring sprained her wrist severely and has severe face and head injuries. Gladys, a younger sister, is more seriously hurt. Her right arm is broken, the left shoulder severely sprained and she has many bruises. All three will recover.<br>
<br>
John and Walter Ristuet of Brookdale were slightly injured. They are brothers, 17 and 10 respecitvely and are now stopped with Mrs. Louis Anderson, 424 North Fifth Street.<br>
<br>
The othere patients at the Fannie Paddock and St. Joseph's Hospitals are all reported to be on the road to rapid recovery. It is now practically cdrtain the death list will reach forty-
five or more. Nine have already died since being taken to the hospitals. Two of these died yesterday and the others did ot live long after being taken from the wreck.<br>
<br>
Unknown Man Identified<br>
<br>
The body of the unknown man which has been lying at Hoska's awaiting identification for twenty-four hours was identified yesterday as that of G.H. Gaul, a Steilacoom boy, aged sixteen, who has been working at the car shops.
His aged mother came to the morgue yesterday morning asking for her son. None of the coroner's assistants knew whether the boy was there or not. He was certainly not among the identified. The mother was taken to the mangled fram lying in the rear and after the face had been bidden she ws permitted to look at the clothes. she recognized the form immediately and fell on her knees sobbing her grief.<br>
<br>
While the body of William Nelsen was lying at the morgue awaiting burial word came from Lake Park that a relaive of his had died there and the two will probably be buried at the same time.<br>
<br>
Scenes at the Morgue<br>
<br>
The same affecting scenes of Wednesday were reenacted at the morgue yesterday and the crowd of curious visitors increased. In order to allow his assistants to work and prepare the bodies for removal, Coroner Hoska was compelled to refuse admittance to a large number and is probably no  one will be permitted to see the bodies today. Coroner Hoska in person remonstrated yesterday with curiosity seekers and asked them not to insist on passing inside.<br>
<br>
He asked them to compare the feelings of breaved relatives with those they would entertain under similar circumstances, and not to visit the morgue. He was unable to turn the tide.<br>
<br>
Between today and Sunday the funerals of practically all the victims of the wreck will be held. The number of funerals to be held will make almost an unending procession from the city to the cemeteries. Some of the bodies are to be sent out of the city for interment, but most of them will be laid away in nearby cemeteries....<br>
<br>
Wanted to give something<br>
<br>
A little girl and her mother were passing a relief barrel in front of a downtown cigar store last night. In her left hadn the girl tighly grasped a ten cent piece and with the other she held to her mother's dress, not to lose her in the crowd. The barrel on the sidewalk attraced the girl's attention and she whispered.<br>
<br>
"Mamma, what is that barrel, for?"<br>
<br>
"Its for the little children who have lost their mammas," she answered softly.<br>
<br>
"The little girl hesitaged a moment and then released he rhold on her mother's dress. Confidently she stepped foreward and reaching the barrel's edge, pulled herself up on her tip toes and reached over the top. Her left hand opened and the dime, reserved for firecrackers, dropped into the pile of coin below. " I guess I'll give them my firecracker money," she said.<br>
<br>
There was a peculiar feeling among the bystandings and then,
moved by a common impulse, all stepped forward and dropped something into the barrel. The firecracker money had earned for the bereaved families greater interest than was ever paid before.<br>
<br>
All classes are contributing to the relief funds, and doing it gladly and willingly. Women and children are touched by the mute appealof the big barrels and the stores of hte lost ones who had families to support and are contributing their mites. Men pass the barrels quietly slip a coin into them and pass on without stopping.<br>
<br>
Now and then pennies are found which tell the story of someone who did not have anything more, but offered what he or she could.<br>
<br>
The game of baseball held yesterday for the relief of the sufferers only netted twenty five dollars. The attendance was surprisingly small and the Tacoma players immediately resolved to add something to it. Each man in the team volunteered to give one dollar and nine more dollars were added to the total. As a esult the relief fund was enriched a total of thirty five dollars from the game.<br>
<br>

Two more victims are added<br>
<br>
(Two more victims are added, death record of the street car tragedy, seven of the injured are still unconscious at the hospitals and little hope of their recovery is entertained, more money needed," <B>Tacoma Daily Ledger,</B> July 7, 1900).<br>
<br>
The death list of the C Street car disaster has reached forty-
one. The six month old babe of Louis Dinger and wife died at the St. Joseph's Hospital at 4:45 o'clock yesterday afternoon and now lies at the morgue besides the bodies of its sister and father.<br>
<br>
Earl Hoskins died at 6:00 p.m.<br>
<br>
Five more victims are still lying unconscious at the St. Joseph's Hospital another is gradually returning to conscioiusness at the Fanny Paddock and still antoher has not regained his consciousness at the same hospital.  These constitute the list of those who may die at any time.<br>
<br>
Ever since the wreck the Dinger baby has been lying either unconscious or so badly dazed that it could give little sign of life. It could not be aroused at any time from a semi-comatose condition and the nurses and physicians had given up all hope of saving the infant. The vitality of the baby was wonderful.<br>
<br>
The blow on the head was one sufficient to have killed many adults and it seemed as though death wold have been almost instantaneous, but almost ot he last the child's pulse beats were
as strong as those of many of the nurses themselves.<br>
<br>
Mother is Reconciled.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Dinger lies in an adjoining room dangerously injured. She was told yesterday of the child's desperate condition and made several anxious inquiries regarding the possibility of its recovery. Then she sated quietly, "If the child's brain will be affected ifit should recover, I would rather see it die than live to become an imbecile. I think that would be better for the baby."<br>
<br>
Mrs. Dinger had become reconciled to the thought of her baby's death, but the nurses decided it would not be best to tell her of it last night.<br>
<br>
This makes the third member of the fmaily who has died as a result of the diaster, Louis and Dorothy Dinger, father and daughter, were killed almost instantly. Mrs.  Dinger was seriously injured, a number of bones being broken. A daughter is with her mother at the hospital slightly injured. The funerals of the three members of the family will be held Sunday and the bodies sent to Parkland for burial.<br>
<br>
Operating on the victims<br>
<br>
The unknown man at the St. Joseph's Hospital has been recognized as James Gemell, a Frenchman aged thirty, who lived at Steilacoom. He is still unconscious and little hope of his recovery is entertained. The hosptial corps of physicians will conduct an operation on him today and my be able to save his life.<br>
<br>
He is suffering from a concussion of the brain and his left side is gradually becoming paralyzed. The operation to be performed will be to open the skull over the motor centers on the right side and remove a clot of blood which has formed there. The operation will be a most delicate one. Gemell at present is very restless.<br>
<br>
An operation was performed yesterday by Dr. Libby, assisted by Drs. Case, Brown, and Keho, on Earl Hoskin who had lain at the St. Joseph Hospital in an unconscious condition ever since the diaster. His skul had been fractured and the bone was lifted where it had been pressed down. An incision was made into the exudative matter and the secretion let out. He ssmed tohave stood the operation well, but died before night.<br>
<br>
Condition of Lyberg<br>
<br>
J.A. Lyberg, is coming through the shock of his operation well but his condition is desperate. His injuries were internal and the opeation was natually a delicate one. He has a fracutre of one of his ribs and is in an emphysematus condition. Lyberg is
still unconscious. Dr. Case conducted the operation on Mr. Lyberg and he states that his recover is doubtful.<br>
<br>
Two of the women who are in a dangerous condition were trepanned y esterday by Drs. Brown and Case. They are Mrs. C.M. Swanson and Sophie Storaasli. Both are unconscious. Paulina Christenden in the same ward, is also unconscious and showing little sign of improvement. She has spoken a word or two in her native tongue, but no other sign of consciousness has been given. sophie Storaasli has spoken a few times but Mrs. Swanson has given no sign of life.<br>
<br>
Regains Consciousness<br>
<br>
Hilda Glasso who has been expected to die has regained consciousness for a few moments at a time and is apparently improved somewhat. At present she is unconscious and her condition is critical. A sister was discharged from the hospital yesterday. J. B. Lingerman, who lost a son in the wreck was also discharged  from St. Joseph's Hospital yesterday. Edith Swanson, whose mother is so dangerously injured was able yesterday to walk about some and may leave the hsopital in a few days. Her  brother, Swan Swanson, was discharged yesterday from the Fanny Paddock hospital. O.M. Parks left the same institution.<br>
<br>
Mrs.  Sulter who is at the St. Joseph's Hosptial suffering from brokenribs and ankle is improving rapidly.<br>
<br>
Otto Johnson, who had been at the Fanny Paddock hosptial unconscious since the wreck, is showing signs of returning consciousness. His injuries were all on the head. Robert Hannah, a boy who has a broken arm and leg is still delrious.His condition is serious. H.L. Wier is reported to be improving.<br>
<br>
Danger of Blood Poisoning<br>
<br>
There is danger of blood poisoning setting in with some of the patients. Lyman Lee is the only one who has shown any such symptoms as yet, but the hospital authorities say the time has not yet arrived for such symptoms to appear with most of the patients. Young Lee's face is badly swollen and serious complications may arise. This is being guarded against by the hosptial authorities.<br>
<br>
Other patients at the hosptial are reported to be improving rapidly. The less seriously injured at the Fanny Paddock, who are in the larger wards, were able yesterday to move about a little or to sit up and take nourishment. Several of them may be discharged within a few days. Some of the patients at the St. Joseph Hospital where most of the serious cases are located, were able yesterday to move about.<br>
<br>
Four More Funerals.<br>

Arrangements were made yesterday for four more funerals. The funeral service over the body of Mrs. Emma Flemming will be held at 9:30 o'clock Sunday morning at Hoska's. A.L. Healy's body will be taken to the school house at Lake View where his funeral will be held at l0:30 o'clock Sunday morning. The funeral of Richard Lee will be held at ll o'clock Sunday morning from the Methodist Church at South Tacoma, and at 4:30 o'cloc, p.m. on the same day the funeal of Lottie Suiter will be held from the Methodist Church at the same place.<br>
<br>
The funeral of J. D. Calhoun, the dead conductor on the ill fated car No. 116 was held from Roberts and Green's last night. The Masons had charge of the funeral and the rites according to their ritual were performed. Mrs. Calhoun started East last night with the body of her husband.<br>
<br>
Flowers for the Dead<br>
<br>
John Simon found yesterday that a large number of the dead had received no flowers andhe returned to his home immediately gathered a large number and took them to the morgue. Each casket was covered with beautiful roses and other flowers.<br>
<br>
A meeting was held in Mayor Campbell's office yesterday morning of the committee which he appointed to take charge of the fund raised for the relief of the street car disaster sufferers. May Cmapbell was immediately elected chairman of the relief committee with O.W. Barlow,of South Tacoma, secretary. Mr. Barlow is preparing a complete list of all those who are left helpless as a result of the disaster.<br>
<br>
The committee yesterday disbursed six hundred dollars. This money was shown to be needed immediately and it was ordered sent to the sufferers. As soon  as reports come to the committe of the need of the funds money will be forwarded. Meetings are to be held daily at the mayor's office to attend to relief measures.<br>
<br>
Funds are Needed.<br>
<br>
Mayor Campbell spoke yesterday in positive terms of the need of larger donations and prompt attention to the wants of the suffers. "The list of those who are left helpless as a result of the disaster is a long one," he said. "The people must respond to it at once and respond generously. We will need three times the amount we have secured at present and there shold be no hesitancy in subscribing.<br>
<br>
"Many of the victims of the disaster were the sole support of large families and now that they are gone there is no one left to provide for them. The committee has already disbursed six hundred dollars and will wnat more  money immediately for more cases. Those in the hosptials will not be able to return to th eir work for some time and in the meantime something must be done for the support of those who were dependent upon them."
Inquire for Relatives<br>
<br>
Anxious meassages of inquiry from other towns came in eysterday to the police and the newspapers. the list of the dead left many in doubt whether their own relatives wee in the wreck, and they telegraphed immediately for information. Similar initials were responsible for some of the inquiries, but in some cases it was a case of undue anxiety.<br>
<br>
Flags in the city yesterday hung at half mast and they will remain so until after the funerals of the victims have been held. The funerals which are to be held today are:<br>
<br>
A.T. Silfberg, 2 p.m. from 5411 Birmingham Avenue.<br>

Officers of the National Guard met yeterday and passed the following resolution:<br>
<br>
Resolved that we desire to express our prfound sympahty to the
families of those killed and injured in the terrible street car accient of July 4th.<br>
<br>
Theory of the Wreck<br>
<br>
A theory, new to the public, has been advanced by street car men and former employes to explain the disaster. It is a complicated theory, involving the study of physics, but one that street car men agree they have learned from practives,  and is absolutely correct. Yet it is one the general public or rather that portion which has heard it, has been skeptical over.<br>
<br>
It is stated by street car men that the brakes must be loosened when going around curves. If set tight the brakes hold the trucks rigid and there is not enough flexibility to permit the truck to turn and follow the curve. To go into a curve with the brakes set hard is to court disaster, motormen claim. The car is almost certain to jump the track.<br>
<br>
Brakes Set Hard<br>
<br>
In line with this theory it is argued that the motorman probably had his brakes set hard when he hit the curve. The car, as a result, went straight ahead, the wheels refusing to follow the curve. Either that result, they claim, or broken chains would certainly follow.<br>
<br>
If the brakes had been released just as the car was to hit the curve the old street car men claim it would have remained on the track or in all events might not go off the bridge. It is acknowledged, though, that this might have been done and in spite of the precaution the car went over.<br>
<br>
Another instance is cited in support of this theory. A car on the street railway jumped the track at a curve, and was smashed. It had been running at a high rate of speed but was not in danger. An old street car man was on the car and after the accident he accused the motorman of going into the curve with his brakes set hard.  He finally acknowledged he had done so.<br>
<br>
Whether the theory is good or no, stret car men believe in it and insit experiences has taught them that it will hold.<br>
<br>
J.A. Lyberg is coming through the shock of his operation well, but his condition is desperate. His injuries were internal and the operation was natually a delicate one. He has a fracture of one of his ribs and is in an emphysematus condition. Lyberg is still unconscious. Dr. Case conducted the operation and he states that his recovery is doubtful.<br>
<br>
Two of the women who are in dangerous condition were trepanned yesterday by Drs. Brown and Case. They are Mrs. G.M. Swanson and Sophie Storassli. Both are still unconscious. Paulina Christensen
in the same ward is also unconscious and showing little sign of improvement. She has spoken a word or two in her native tongue, but no other sign of consciousness has been given. Sophie Storassli has spoken a few times, but Mrs. Swanson has given no sign of life.<br>
<br>
Hilda Glasso, who has been expected to die, has regained consciousness for a few moments at a time and is apparently improved somewhat. At present she is unconscious and her condition is critical. A sister was discharged from the hospital yesterday.J.H. Lingerman, who lost a son in the wreck was also discharged from the St. Joseph's hospital yesterday.<br>
<br>
Edith Swanson, whose mother is so dangeroulsy injured was able yesterday to walk some and may lave the hospital in a few days. Her brother Swan Swanson was discharged yesterday from the Fanny Paddock hosptial. G.M. Parks also left he same institution.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Sutter, who is at the St. Joseph's Hosital suffered from broken ribs and ankle, is improving rapidly.<br>
<br>
Otto Johnson, who has been at the Fanny Paddock Hospital, unconscious since the wreck is showing signs of returning consciousness. His injuries were all on the head. Robert Hannah, a boy who has a broken arm and leg is still delirious. His condition is serious. H.L. Weir is reorted to be improving somewhat.<br>
<br>
There is danger of blood poisoning setting in with some of the patients. Lyman Lee is the only one who has shown any such symptoms as yet, but the hospital authorities say the time has not yet arrived for such symptoms to appear with most of the patients.<br>
<br>
Young Lee's face is badly swollen and serious complications may arise. This is being guarded against by hospital authorities.<br>
<br>
Other patients at the hospital are reported improving rapidly. The less seriously injured at the Fanny Paddock who are in the larger wards wee able yesterday to move about a little or to sit up and take nourishment. Several of them may be discharged within a few days. Some of the patients at the St. Joseph's hospital where most of the serious cases are located were able yesterday to move about.<br>

"Witnesses tell of the wreck," <B>Tacoma Daily Ledger.</B> July 12, 1900.<br>
<br>
The car which brought sorrow and death to the people of this city on July 4 was running at the rate of twenty-five miles an hour
when it made the plunge over the bridge. The motorman testified to this yesterday as he lay on his bed of pain in the Fannie Paddock Hospital. Others said the car was going at a much higher rate of speed.<br>
<br>
There was some dispute as to whether the car capsized when it passed over the tracks and dropped off the bridge. Some of the witnesses said it turned over and others were of the opinion that it dropped down front platform foremost.<br>
<br>
There was one thing developed by the inquest and that is that the motorman, F.L. Boehm was a comparatively new man on the road. His testimony given yesterday was very important. He had made a few trips on the line and had been under the impression on the night before the accident that he would take out another car. He tinkered with the other car and when morning came was told to take out the coach which carried so many to death. It was the largest car he had ever handled, although he had several yars experience as a motorman in Cincinnati.<br>
<br>
Boehm answerd all the questions put to him by Deputy County Attorney McMurray and the members of the coroner's jury without hesitation. He grew faint before the inquiry ended, but he made a very good witness. The testimony of George C. Bott was also taken at the hospital. His story was very similar to the one told by hm to a reporter of <B>The Ledger</B> on the morning of the wreck.<br>
<br>
The Inquest Opens.<br>
<br>
The inquest was called for l:30 o'clock yesterday in Judge Kean's courtroom. There was a large number of spectators present when Coroner Hoska rapped for order. Witnesses pf tje accodmt were few. jwpever. amd at 3"00 o'clock it was necessary to adjourn to the hospital to take the testimony of the motorman and Mr. Bott.<br>
<br>
F.A. Olds, a member of the jury was unable to be preent on account of the death of his father, F.T.Olds. The insquest was carried on with the following five persons:<br>
<br>
Peter Irving, Charles Plass, Charles Adkins, J.H. Babbitt, and F. A Turner. All of these gentlemen are well known residents of the city.<br>
<br>
Deputy Prosecuting Attorney McMurray and Major Bates repreenting the people. B.S. Grosscup and Charles S. Fogg were preent, but did not take any part in the proceeding. Superintendent Dame of the  Railroad company was also present. William Blackman, state labor and factory inspector asked a number of questions and aided the attorneys of the people.<br>
<br>
Saw the Wreck<br>
<br>
Charles Hersay of 4576 South L Street was called to the stand after Coroner Hoska opened the inquest. He said he boarded an
outgoing car on the morning of the accident and was held at the switch at 26th Street to wait for the incoming car to pass. It was a little after 8:00 o'clock and he began to worry over the delay.He asked the motorman on his car if the other car was not a little late.<br>
<br>
The motorman said that it was, and shortly afterward the car came in sight.  It jumped the track after passing the water tank, ran along one side and then left the bridge. Witness rushed over to the side of the bridge, saw the dead and the maimed in the gulch and then hurried to the laundry at 26th Street and Pacific Avenue and endeavored to telephone the police.  He could not get the station and told Central what had happened.<br>
<br>
When he returned to the street the fire engines were racing to the scene. He saw Georg Bott lying on the edge of the gulch and saw a number of injured lying on the ground below.  Witness could not remember whether the bell of the wrecked car was ringing or not, but he thought the car was running at the rate of about forty miles an hour. He saw a number of boys jump off the platform of the car before it left the bridge. One of the boys told him afterward that his arm was borken and he remarked that he was lucky to be alive.<br>
<br>
Was Aboard the Car<br>
<br>
The next witness, Samuel G. Mathers, had escaped from the doomed car with his life, but he was badly bruised. His head was bandaged and there were bandages on his right hand and wrist. He boarded the wrecked car at South Tacoma. He was then employed in the Northern Pacific Shops. When he entered the cr there were between eighty and one hundred people on board. The aisles of the car were crowded.<br>
<br>
The wintess aid he lost consciousness almost as soon as it left the track. He did not remember anything afterward until he found his wounds bandaged.<br>
<br>
The next witness, John Wedemeyer, said he was on the front plantform and jumped just as the car started down the hill. He did not hear the motorman ask for help with the brakes.<br>
<br>
David Dowden was at Tacoma Avenue anxious to take the car, but it passed without stopping.It was crowded to the platforms and he remarked at the time, that it was going too fast. He saw it go over the bridge.<br>
<br>
Loren L. Thorpe, who was called to the stand said he was employed at the Northern Pacific Shops. He boarded the car at South Tacoma. It was well filled then and more people got on as it neared the city. He jumped when near the bridge. Just before this he saw Mr. Wedemeyer jump. There were about fifteen people on the frong platform at the time.<br>

Witness said that it had been raining, but the tracks were not wet. He thought of his wife just befor e he jumped for she had arranged to come to town on another car. He was only slightly injured.<br>
<br>
The next witness was J.W. Roberts, an undertaker. He testified to having cared for a number of bodies taken from the wreck. He told of the funerals and of the identification of the deceased.<br>
<br>
C.C. Mellinger, another undertaker, testified to burying a number of the dead from the wreck.He gave the names of the victims and said they had been identified by their friends.<br>
<br>
Deputy Coroner Coombs followed. He gave the names of the dead who had been taken to Hoska's undertaking rooms and told of their identification and burial.<br>
<br>
An adjournment was taken to the Fannie Paddock hospital for the purpose of taking testimony of Motorman F.L. Boehm and George C. Bott. The jurors were escorted to the hospital by Sheriff Mills and Coroner Hoska, and the attorneys followed.<br>
<br>
The testimony of Mr. Bott was taken first. He said he had been in the habit of walking to business in this city, but the doomed car had reached him at 52nd Street and he boarded it. All went well until 33rd Street as reached. There a stop was made for a boy. The car was so crowded at the time that the little fellow could not get on.  Mr. Bott advised him to get on the cow catcher and he did. After the accident Mr. Bott saw him. He had escaped with a broken arm.<br>
<br>
Men Begin to Jump<br>
<br>
Not long after leaving Tacoma Avenue the motorman lost control of the car. Men began to jump off the platforms and the witness jumped when close to the bridge. As he lay on the ground the car turned almost on its side and seemed to be running on its right wheels.  When Mr. Bott jumped he landed on his feet and turned two or three somersaults before he came to a stop.<br>
<br>
He was on the rear platform next to the conductor when the car began its terrible race down the hill. He heard the bell ringing but could not say who was pulling the rope. At that time there were as many people aboard the car as could possibly be carried. He and other passengers conversed about the motorman having lsot control of the car. Mr. McMurray asked the witness how fast the car was running then, and he answered, "About as fast as I ever traveled."<br>
<br>
Mr.  Bott had known the conductor a few weeks, but he had not seen the motorman at all. He was of the opinion that the latter had turned on the current at the top of the hill and then had turned it off and reversed it. He was sure that the motorman had
endeavored to stop the car.<br>
<br>
The Motorman's Story<br>
<br>
F.L. Boehm, the motorman whose cot is almost opposite the one occupied by Mr. Bott was visited. He is rapidly improving and is resting very comfortably, considering his injuries. He was subjected to a very severe examiniation.<br>
<br>
Mr. McMurray, Mr. Blackman, Mr. Grosscup and members of the jury took turns questioning him. He said that on the morning of July 4 he left South Tacoma ten minutes late. A large number of people got on the car at tht place and more had boarded it at Spanaway and the Puyallup junctions. At 34th Street the witness inspected the car brakes and found them to be in good working order.<br>
<br>
A slight mist began falling as the car started down the hill on the other side of the bridge. The car began to slide and Boehm put on the brakes, but the car continued to slide. He used the sand box and reversed the current but the car was beyond his control.<br>
<br>
Several passenge who stood on the platform with him started to jump  off, but he told them to remain in their palces, because he thought he could bring the car to a stop at Tacoma Avenue.However, it ran away from him and left the track just before the curve was reached. Then it capsized over the bridge. Before it made its mad race down the hill the fuse blew out.<br>
<br>
Witness has been in the employ of the Company since June 8. He cme to this city from Cincinnati. He was employed on electric motor cars in that city and since he cme here he has been over the company's South Tacoma line about thirty times. He thought there were about eighty people on the car the day of the wreck.<br>
<br>
Altogether he has had about three years' experience as a motorman. He was employed on the Westwood line in Cincinnati and he thought the grades were just as steep there as they ar h ere.He had never had an accident before, but he admitted that he had never taken out a car as heavy as the one that was wrecked. The brakes of the car were in good condition, but he had not examined the wheels.<br>
<br>
Sand Was Working<br>
<br>
Boehm insisted that he had plenty of sand; it worked well when he used it and seemed to check the speed of the car. It did not, however, prevent the wheels from sliding.<br>
<br>
"How much time did the company allow you to break in?" asked Mr. McMurray.<br>

"Just two days," the witness replied, but he added that he had been over the line nearly thirty times before he was given a run. Mr. Moon and Mr. Neff, experienced men took him over the road. "What did  you do on the day before the accident?" asked Mr. Hoska.<br>
<br>
"I worked in the car barn," the witness and answered.<br>
<br>
He continued that he worked on car 115, thinking that he would be given charge of it the next day. Another man was giventhis car and was ordered to take out No. 116.<br>
<br>
Warned to go slow<br>
<br>
In answer to a question by Mr. Blackman, witness said there were no stop or slow down signs on the track. He had been warned that the curve near the birdge was dangerous and to go around it slowly. He thought just before the wreck occurred the car was traveling at the rate of twenty-five miles per hour.<br>
<br>
Boehm said he thought he could have stopped the cr had it been empty. The rear brake was not set, but he lost the current after leaving Tacoma Avenue.<br>
<br>
This closed his examiniation and he sank back on his pllow exhausted. Several of the jurors shook hands with him and then an adjournment was taken until 10:00 o'clock this morning in Judge Kean's court. At least two score more of witnesses are to be examined and it is probable that the inquest will last several days.<br>

Herbert Hunt, "Street Cars," <B>History of Tacoma.</B> p.11-12<br>
<br>
April 23. 1889, the city council had adopted ordinance No. 237 giving to Henry Villard, Paul Schulze, J. H. Cummings and others a franchise for cable railways.  May 4 the council had vacated certain portions of Cliff Avenue at the foot of Thirteenth Street and donated it to Villard and his associates for power house pur-
poses.<br>
<br>
Later in the year the Tacoma Railway & Motor Company acquired the franchises and other properties of the Villard Company but the cable railways up the hill did not materialize.  Citizens, seeing the bill districts were being retarded in development, protested,
and W. H. Fife presented a petition asking that the cableline franchise be revoked.<br>
<br>
Fife and his fellow signatories said that while they did not desire to enter the railroad business, rather than see the development of the  hill district  farther retarded, they would bind themselves to build cable lines if the council would clear  the way and give them a franchise.  A few days later the council passed an ordinance in which the company was permitted to build either electric or cable lines to K Street, within six months.<br>
<br>
It was on April 22, 1890, that the first car was run on the Point Defiance line, completed shortly before that time by Allen C. Mason and associates.  Promptly at 2.30 P. <B>M., </B>Supt.  George Balch rang the bell on the new motor and Engineer Nelson Bedell turned on the steam.  At the foot of North First Street the motor encountered grease on the rails which caused some trouble.  At I Street a stop was made for a tank of water and about two miles further on wood for fuel was taken on board.<br>
<br>
The smelter was reached a few minutes before 4 o'clock.  The return trip was made in forty minutes and the next morning regular hourly service to Burlingame's Saw Mill near the smelter was established.<br>
<br>
By the middle of July, Superintendent Cummings, of the Tacoma Railway & Motor Company had completed plans for the cable road on Thirteenth Street and had let contracts.  The A. B. Todd Company, of Tacoma, was making the cast iron cable yokes.  The cars were to be equipped for operation on both cable and electric lines and would be switched to the latter at K Street from which point they would go to Nineteenth and out that street to a point to be decided upon later.<br>
<br>
New and larger engines and dynamos bad been ordered, and the company expected to put about three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in improvements.<br>
<br>
In August the company began building the Tacoma Avenue line.  Tacoma Avenue had great expectations.  It was the first street to undertake paving of a more substantial character than planking.  The Bituminous Rock Company had 100 men and thirty teams at work between Ninth and Fifteenth streets.  On a base of concrete the company was laying about two inches of bituminous rock.  The contract price was $52,000.<br>
<br>
Fifteen minutes before noon on June 29, Frank 0. Meeker drove the last spike in the narrow gauge Tacoma & Puyallup Railroad.  The exercises were held about three miles this side of Puyallup.<br>

FOURTH OF JULY WRECK.<br>
<br>
Herbert Hunt, "Fourth of July Street Car Disaster," <B>History of Tacoma.</B> Chicago: S.J. Clarke Publishing Company, 1916, II, p. 209-211.<br>
<br>
One of the Northwest's most disastrous street car accidents occurred on the morning of July 4, 1900, at the south end of the bridge that at that time spanned the gulch at Twenty-sixth and South C streets.<br>
<br>
Car No. 116, heavily loaded with people bound for the celebration in Tacoma ran away down the DeLin Street hill, jumped the track at the curve and plunged over the bridge and was crushed upon the logs 100 feet below.  Forty-three persons were killed and many injured.<br>
<br>
The car, in charge of Motorman F. L. Bohem and Conductor J. D. Calhoun, left South Tacoma shortly after 8 o'clock.  Soon every inch of space was occupied and passengers were clinging to the outside railings.  Shortly after leaving the top of the hill the motorman realized that the car was beyond control.  Brakes were tightly set, sand was used and the current was reversed, but without decreasing the speed of the car.<br>
<br>
Passengers jumped to the ground and the track for 300 feet was bordered with the injured.  At the bridge the car cleared the twelve-inch guard rail and plunged into the gulch.  The crash was beard for blocks.  Dead, dying and injured men, women and children, splintered wood and twisted iron were piled together in the bottom of the gulch whose steep sides made the work of rescue very difficult.  Veterans of the Philippine war, then in Tacoma for their first reunion, rendered valuable assistance.<br>
<br>
Mayor Campbell re-fused to take part in the holiday exercises and turned his attention to relief measures.  Subscription lists were started and about three thousand dollars was given.  Sheriff Mills, under instructions from Coroner Hoska, took charge of the wreck and placed deputies on guard.<br>
<br>
For months citizens had protested against the dilapidated cars.  The council had passed an ordinance regulating the speed, but the ordinance had not been enforced.  After the accident the council met and heard resolutions condemning the company for discharging old employees <B>and </B>putting new men in their places; for overloading the cars and for exceeding the speed limit.<br>
<br>
Action on the resolution was deferred <B>pending </B>the findings of the coroner's jury a few days later.  The jury, composed of Peter Irving, Charles Plass, Charles Atkins, J. H. Babbitt and F. A. Turner, spent three days in investigating and brought in one of
the most severe arraignments of a street car company ever returned.<br>
<br>
Motorman Bohem, then recovering from his injuries, testified that he had had three years' experience in Cincinnati, but that he had never had charge of a car over the DeLin Street grade until the morning of the accident.  Among the many witnesses were street railway experts from other cities who examined the tracks, which they found to be badly worn, and the flanges of some of the car wheels were thin and weak.  The track had been in use for ten years and was in bad condition.<br>
<br>
The jury found the accident due to the carelessness of Motor<B>man </B>Bohem and asserted that the "Tacoma Railway & Power Company was grossly and criminally careless and negligent in permitting said Motorman F. L. Bohem to go out on said car <B>116</B> over said dangerous grade without any previous effort to ascertain his efficiency."<br>
<br>
The company was "grossly and criminally careless in maintaining said. dangerous grade without installing any safety appliances and was also careless and lax in the maintenance of its track and equipment."<br>
<br>
The thirty-seven killed outright were Lois Drake, Annie Glasso, Lottie Suitor, Dorothy <B>Dinger, </B>Louis Dinger, Charles Moser, Albert Moser, Richard Lee, Mrs. Grossman, G. Bertoli, Ole Larson, Ole Ranseen, James Benston, Charles Davis, William <B>J. </B>Williams, John Paulis, William Nieson, Robert Steele, G. H. Gaul, Rev.  Herbert Gregory, Griffith Vanderhelden, A. L. Healy, G. M'Mullin, Mr. and Mrs. John J. Shanger-who had they lived a few days longer would have celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary; they were buried in the same grave.<br>
<br>
W.      H. Davis, Joseph McCann, Leroy Lingerman, Gordon Newton, Richard Sonberg, G. H. Brown,,William Hastings, Mrs. George Elliot, Conductor J. D. Calhoun, Mrs. Campbell, C. W. Woodruff and A. T. Silberg.  Edward Bray, Mrs. Emma Flamming, Floyd M. Dinger, Earl Hoskins, J. Gimel and Hilda Glasso died after being removed from the wreckage.<br>
<br>
The DeLin Street grade and the dangerous curve had been the cause of other accidents.  The first of these occurred about ten years before when two motor cars loaded with men collided, killing one man and injuring a dozen others.  Two cars of green wood hauled by a dummy engine with Nelson Bedell in charge, ran away and went over the bridge.  Other accidents had resulted in the death of two women.<br>
<br>
Damage suits arising from the wreck cost the company more than one hundred thousand dollars.  The piled-up suits almost led to the appointment of a receiver for the company.  It finally set
aside a sum exceeding one hundred thousand dollars and informed the lawyers for the injured that they could take that sum and distribute it, and that a greater demand would bring about a receivership.  The lawyers accepted the offer.<br>

<br>
Popular belief in UFO's is unquestionably growing.  A recent Gallup poll found that fully 46 per cent of the American people are true believers.  Not long ago, a group of distinguished scientists told Congress so many inexplicable sightings have occurred that it is indeed possible for the earth to be under the scrutiny of extraterrestrial creatures.<br>
<br>
Here in the Pacific Northwest, the camp of true believers is large and vocal, and at no time is their faith more pronounced than when they take up the national sport of convention-going-as happened in the state of Washington again this summer.<br>
<br>
EATONVILLE.<br>
<br>
Major Wayne S. Aho, president of the New Age Foundation, Inc., has been trying to save the world from itself ever since 1957-the year, says Aho, when flying saucer-men first warned him of impending earthly doom.  "I was attending a UFO convention in the Yucca Valley in California," soys the major, whose title is a vestige of his years with Army Intelligence during World War Two.<br>
<br>
"One evening I went for a walk in the desert, and when I was about two miles from the convention site, an egg-shaped craft with a pulsating orange color came gliding over the horizon and stopped directly in front of me.  Then, since saucers are visible only when they are moving, it disappeared, but I could sense that it was still there and that the beings inside were picking up my thought waves.<br>
<br>
"After a while," continues Aho, a potbellied, middle-aged man who speaks in the self-confident tones of a pope delivering an encyclical: "the saucer-men began talking to me via mental telepathy.  'Your civilization,' they said, 'is on the edge of a precipice, and only the spiritually motivated people can guide it through the critical days ahead.'<br>
<br>
The saucer-men went on to explain that they have come here to save us from blowing ourselves up with nuclear bombs, and ever since that day, I have devoted myself to the study of flying saucer activity."<br>
<br>
For this purpose, Aho and others formed the New Age Foundation and began holding annual Northwest UFO conventions.  The one being held this year in Eatonville-the headquarters of Aho's organization-is the seventh.<br>
<br>
The two-day convention is just now getting under way but it is already evident that this is not going to be a Cecil B. DeMille production.  For one thing, the setting is a mold-covered old
building on the edge of Eatonville, which is one of those sad little two-cafe lumbering towns which have seen better days, though not much better.<br>
<br>
The 50-yard-long building is so decayed that only the moss seems to be holding it together, but a 10-yard section on one end has been patched up to serve as headquarters of the New Age Foundation.  Inside are a couple of bare rooms with sleeping bags scattered around the floor, a big kitchen with huge, old-fashioned gas stoves, and a meeting room furnished with folding chairs and sagging living room furniture that even St. Vincent de Paul's would likely reject.<br>
<br>
As they wander around talking to each other, the flying saucer enthusiasts look about as enthusiastic as people in the waiting line at the state employment bureau.<br>
<br>
Maybe 75 conventioneers are here-most of them over 50 years old and dressed in the kind of mail-order clothes that retired people wear around the house.  About a half dozen children in their early teens are sitting sullenly on the crumbling front porch, obviously not at anticipating the imminent landing of a UFO.<br>
<br>
Major Aho is also on the porch, standing behind a table where flying saucer literature is displayed for sale.  His tie is askew, and the three shirt buttons closest to his navel are undone.<br>
<br>
Just after 11 a.m., Aho announces that the convention is about to start, and the people file obediently into the sweltering sitting room.  The major takes a position behind a cluttered table loaded with more literature and boasting a small plaster model of a flying saucer.  Through one of the windows looms nearby Mount Rainier, -here the whole crazy flying saucer thing began.<br>
<br>
It was June 24, 1947, when a Boise businessman named Kenneth Arnold was flying his private plane over the Cascades.  Just as he passed Mount Rainier, he suddenly spotted nine circular objects flying in single-file formation.  Arnold timed the disks between two points on the ground and concluded that they were traveling at 1,200 miles an hour.<br>
<br>
When he landed at Pendleton, Oregon, Arnold told a reporter that the disks were about the size of a DC-4 and that they "flew like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water."<br>
<br>
The Arnold incident would probably have attracted little attention had it not occurred at a time when no major news was breaking and editors all over the country were aching for a grabber.  During such periods, newspapermen begin reporting the bizarre, and stories about talking dogs or singing goldfish are likely to land on the front page.  
Thus, the flying saucer story was picked up by the wire services and splashed over papers across the land-and almost immediately, more china was flying through the air than Jiggs and Maggie ever dreamed of.  In every part of the U.S., citizens reported UFO sightings, the newspapers printed them, and the public ate it up.<br>
<br>
Althoughh Arnold is generally given the credit for "discovering" flying saucers, his was by no means the first sighting.  Indeed, some people claim that visitors from outer space have been landing on our planet since far before the dawn of history.  For example, Tschi Pen Lao of the University of Peking has discovered a primitive drawing that may date from 45,000 B.C.<br>
<br>
The drawing shows a row of saucer-like craft bearing strange looking animals peering down at a group of similar animals on the ground below.  The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans also reported sighting UFO'S, some with creatures aboard, and their descriptions are strikingly like those of modern-day observers.  In fact, records exist of more than 300 sightings of UFO's prior to the 20th century, and more than 100 sightings between 1900 and the time of the Arnold incident.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the most remarkable 20th ceniury UFO was the one seen at Fatima, the famous village north of Lisbon where, in 1917, three young girls reported visitations by the Virgin Mary.  On October 13 of that year, 70,000 people gathered in a field near Fatima in expectation of another miracle, and in due course their expectations were rewarded.<br>
<br>
Roman Catholics, of course, regard the events of that day as the work of God, but any UFO expert can tell you that the last "miracle" at Fatima was nothing more than a giant flying saucer.<br>
<br>
Professor Almeida Garret, a scientist at Coimbra University, in Portugal, described the miracle this way:<br>
<br>
"It was raining hard, and the rain trickled down everyone's clothes.  Suddenly, the sun shone through the dense cloud which covered it: everybody looked in its direction.  It looked like a disc, of a very definite color.  It was not dazzling.  I don't think that it could be compared to a dull silver disc, as someone said later in Fatima.  No. It rather possessed a clear, changing brightness, which one could compare to a pearl.<br>
<br>
"It looked like a polished wheel .... It rotated with increasing speed.  Suddenly, the crowd began crying with anguish.  The sun, revolving all the tune, began failing towards the earth, reddish and bloody, threatening to crush everybody beneath its fiery weight."<br>
<br>
     
Unfortunately for flying saucer buffs, no cameramen were present to record this momentous event, and the world is still waiting for conclusive evidence that extraterrestrial beings are taking an interest in the muddled affairs of the human race.  Although dozens of pictures of UFO's exist, they are either too fuzzy for positive identification, or they are patently fake.<br>
<br>
Because of this, the scientific world has tended to maintain a prim and rather pained silence on the subject: many scientists, indeed, say the whole thing is a passing fad, soon to be as extinct as flag-pole sitting.<br>
<br>
Yet it has been 21 years since the Arnold incident, and reports of saucer sightings continue to pour in.  At last count, more than five million Americans claimed to have seen UFO'S.  As a result, the general public is increasingly being converted to the cause; the Gallup poll, for example, found that only 19 per cent are confirmed non-believers (the remainder are, in Gallup's standard terminology, "undecided").<br>
<br>
Indeed, of all the Northwest products-including thee 707 none has become so popular as the flying saucer.  This large saucer following, of course, includes a number of quite ordinary and respectable people.<br>
<br>
The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, with headquarters in Washington, D.C., claims a membership of 11,000, a number of whom are reputable scientists.  But for sheer dedication to the flying saucer cause, few can match the members of Major Aho's New Age Foundation<br>
<br>
As the meeting begins, Aho addresses the audience on the need for government support.  "I've written a letter to Governor Evans asking that Washington State lead the way in investigating UFO's," Aho tells the conventioneers, who are shifting sweatily and  uncomfortably in the stuffy room.<br>
<br>
"The only man in state government who receives UFO reports is the director for the Department of Civil Defense.  All these reports are sent out of state to private groups or to the committee of Dr.  Edward U. Condon at the University of Colorado, which is studying UFO phenomena under a federal grant.  No evaluation of these reports is being made by any local university, college, individual or private group.<br>
<br>
And as for the reports that go to the Air Force-well, we know that the Air Force has been trying for years to hide from the public the fact that we are being visited by beings from other planets."<br>
<br>
Resentment of the Air Force, for two decades the chief official investigator of UFO'S, is one of the most characteristic<br>
attitudes of flying saucer buffs.  This is partly because the Air
<br>
Force has given such low priority to the task.  Only a couple of full-time people are charged with conducting the investigations, and very little scientific help is called in from the outside.<br>
<br>
The Air Force contends that there is nothing so far to indicate that UFO's come from outer space or that they constitute a menace to the nation.  Of the 11,003 sightings investigated by the end of 1966, the Air Force has found, explanations for all but 659.  Among the objects mistaken for saucers, it has said, are meteors, stars, planets, airplanes, balloons, missiles, rockets, reflectons, flares, fireworks, mirages, search lights, contrails, lightning, kites and birds.<br>
<br>
This July, Radio Station KJR fanned a flying saucer flap by reporting celestial goings-on over Auburn.  A mysterious light was appearing so regularly over the area, claimed disc jockey named Lan Roberts, that hundreds of spectators (mainly teenagers) congregated in the streets of Auburn to gawk a it. The light turned out to be the casing of a Russian satellite.<br>
<br>
The morning meeting is over, and the club members are gathered around the debilitated porch, as well as in the surrounding yard.  Everyone is eating a pot-luck spaghetti lunch.  A plump, middle-aged woman tells a companion about her friendship with Mr. M., a saucerian from a planet named <B>Viveagga</B>, in another solar system.<br>
<br>
Mr. M., she reports, was scheduled to make an appearance at the convention, but, unforlunately, he couldn't make it.  As the next best thing, she displays some letters which Mr. M. has written in his quaint <B>Vivaagian</B> script.<br>
<br>
"I often have him over to dinner," she says, with a casual air that even Hollywood name-droppers would envy.  "He is a cleancut executive-type man who is no different in appearance than anyone from earth, except in a few, uh, unseen areas, where he is different."<br>
<br>
Vivaassians, she explains, have a religion like "the old Quaker religion," a capitalistic economy and an education remarkably like ours, with grammar schools, junior highs and high schools, except that none of these institutions is coeducational.  After completing school, Vivaamians all marry, and then many of them travel to earth in space ships which measure mile in diameter and carry 410 passengers- -plus the crew.  The trip itself takes 20 years.<br>
<br>
Vivaassians come to earth, she explains, to trade for magnesium, for the supply on their planet has been used up.  The trading concession, she adds, is going to be vastly profitable to the earthling who gets it.<br>

<br>
Nearly all tie saucer enthusiasts believe that extraterresial beings are friendly, but a few are not so sure.  At least 15 persons, they point out, have died in saucer incidents.  The first such death resulted from a UFO encounter involving Kenneth Arnold, the man who spied the first saucers over Mount Rainier.<br>
<br>
A month after his original sighting, Arnold heard a report about a doughnut shaped UFO which had landed on Maury Island, a few miles off Tacoma, and which had blatantly defied anti-litter laws by spewing molten lava all over the ground.  Immediately, Arnold flew to the island in question, and upon landing, radioed that he had sighted a group of saucerettes only three feet in diameter.<br>
<br>
Next, Arnold phoned Air Force Intelligence at Hamilton Field, California, and asked to have the landing site examined.  The<br>
Air Force obligingly dispatched a crew who collected earth samples at the supposed point of landing, but unfortunately, the B-2 burst into flames during its return flight; although two crew members<br>
bailed out safely, the pilot and co-pilot, who stuck with the ship, were killed.<br>
<br>
Arnold laid the cause of the tragedy to dark forces that were trying to prevent earthlings from learning the secret of the saucers.  Unhappily for Arnold's theory, the ensuing investigation showed that the Maury Island saucer report was the work of two pranksters who planned to sell the story to a magazine.<br>
<br>
Some of the deaths, however, are not so easily explained. One of the most mystifying saucer tragedy also occurred in this state. On April 1, 1959, an Air Force C-118 was flying five miles east of Sumner when the pilot radioed "We've hit something or something has hit us."<br>
<br>
Although witnesses on the ground did not see the collision, they did report that when the plane passed over, none of its four engines was running and that glowing, domed objects were following it. They also said that part of the tail assembly was missing.  All four crew mem-<br>
bers died in the crash.<br>
<br>
The idea that the saucer-men may be up to no good is, of course, anathema to members of the New Age Foundation, most of whom contend that the visitors from outer space are the only hope for earthly civilization.  "We would be dead already," declares Aho during a meeting on the following afternoon, "if the flying saucers were not constantly collecting atomic fallout from the stratosphere and then dumping it into an inactive volcano near Ottawa.  These beings are preparing a golden age for us.  The technology they will give us
will advance us thousands of years.<br>
<br>
"By 1988, in fact, the interplanetary exchange of commerce        and culture will already be commonplace.  We should begin now to train emissaries who will be capable of understanding these being<br>
from distant planets."<br>
<br>
Later, over paper cup of Kool Aid, Aho explains why the saucer-men do not simply go to the earthly authorities and reassure them of their good intentions.  "If a spaceship were to land on the White House lawn, the guards would shoot whomever came out of it," he says "And let's suppose a spaceman were able to see the President in some other way, an, suppose the President went on TV and said, 'Ladies and gentlemen, a most momenteous thing happened last night.  I spoke to a man from outer space.' Do you know what would happen? Before midnight, the streets would be full of people giving petitions and shouting, 'We've got to remove that madman from office!' No, the space-men must get in touch with people who are already sympathetic, and these people have to prepare the world for the spacemen's arrival. The people whom the spacemen talk with must be spritually developed.<br>
<br>
As the afternoon wears on and members of the audience one after another, take the podium, it becomes evident that this spiritual development takes a bewildering variety of paths.  Among the more provocative contentions are these:<br>
<br>
Jesus was a saucer pilot.<br>
<br>
Interplanetery reincarnation is commonplace.<br>
<br>
The earth is hollow, and there are more people inside it than outside.<br>
<br>
Other club members turn out to be believers in Christian Yoga, in something called the Ma ter Aetherius and in celestial music.  During the intermission, a middle aged man, who says he is an electrical engineer, explains what all this has to do with UFO'S.<br>
<br>
"Flying saucers have united the occult world," he sw.,s. "Before UFO's came along, occultists would stay with one organization until they learned all it had to teach or until they got bored with it; then they would move on to another cult.  But UFO's were something that all occultists could believe in, so people interested in metaphysics flocked to saucer clubs, bringing their old beliefs with them.<br>
<br>
"Now an occultist doesn't have to flit from one organization to another.  He can just join a saucer group, expound whatever he
believes in and at the same time listen to what people with other philosophies have to say.  The old table-rappers are almost out of business now.  When you want to get in touch with a dep@d friend or relative, your message is conveyed telepathically by a relay syttem in a flying saucer."<br>
<br>
The engineer goes on to say that there are hundreds of such saucer clubs throughout the country and that in the last year alone, he visited 32 of them on the West Coast.<br>
<br>
"Aho is an honest and sincere man," he continues, "but some   of   these   clubs   are operated by downright  crooks  who  take   the<br>
members for whatever  they  can  get.  Usually this isn't  much,  since  many   of   the   members are not only broke but are too way-out to function in regular jobs; the thing that keeps the crooks in busimess is the hope that a rich widow will come along whom they can really take to the cleaners.<br>
<br>
"A couple of months ago I talked to a woman who had been swindled oul of  $200,000 by two guys who pretended to be building a flying saucer from directions she received by telepathy from the crew of a spaceship.  I took one look at the crazy thing these guys had built, and I saw it was tn absolute hoax.<br>
<br>
"Then I looked one of the builders right in the eye and asked him how it worked.  He said, 'I think you already know,'and walked away.  It really makes n e mad to see these poor saucer people taken. Some of them may be cracked, but they're usually the most gentle, kind and generous people you'll ever meet."<br>
<br>
Kindness  is such a universal trait among the saucer cultists that there is an eerie quality about it. Though their occult views are<br>
often in conflict, they never argue with each other, and ii is almost as though they had all undergone lobotomies.  The most<br>
outrageous claims are accepted without evoking any apparent suspicion.<br>
<br>
This evening, for example, salmon   barbecue   held    by the club  in a nearby public park is attended by  a  number  of the  conventioneers   who   sit under a  tree  and listen  in   smiling   agreement while an  elderly janitor, who carries  the  title of Reverend, tells them  that  Jesus  is  in  the habit  of  coming in the night and  sitting  on  the foot of  his  bed.  " I was  Jesus'  brother  in  a previous reincarnation." he says, spitting out a salmon bone.  " ' remember very clearly how we used to jump off the barn roof together when we were children."<br>
<br>
This same gentleness is reflected in another man's hopes to build a brand new city for 1,200 homeless children.  "It will only take
$1,400,000," he says.  "I can raise money in two months by going to the various heads of state.  We'll have children of here, to prove once and for all that the races of the world can get along.<br>
<br>
"One of the main features will be a special, 300-foot landing pad for flying saucers.  "<br>
<br>
Although saucer cultists want to build a better world, they have so many different ideas of how to go about it that they are never able to get a specific Project under way.  A recent attempt in Califomia to found a saucerian political organization-to be called the Universal Part@ew an audience of exactly four people.  This lack of cohesiveness troubles them little, for they are convinced that very shortly the spacemen will decide to make their presence known in a way no scoffer can refute, and that true believers will then come into their own.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, enthusiasm is bolstered by the never-ending flow of saucer sightings all over the world and occasiidnally by a statement from a scientist sayin: that it is not beyond the realm of possibilil y that UFO's are from outer space-really.<br>
<br>
Last July, a number of reputable scientists appeared before Congress and recommended that it establish a UFO board of scientific inquiry and an international clearing house for UFO reports. Dr. James E. McDonald, a senior physicist with the University of Arizona told congressmen that extraterrestial aircraft are " a  possibility that I take very seriously If there is even a chance of surveillance we should explore it."<br>
<br>
A month later, at  aspecial "UFO Day" sponsored by Seattle's Pacific Science Center, Dr. McDonald spoke to an overflow audience about his own initial disbelief and his present cautious, tentative acceptance of the hypothesis of an extraterrestrial origin for UFO'S.  "Our appearance before Congress," he remarked af erward, "was really in the nature of a briefini session.  The group of congressmen was rather surprised to have a half-dozen credible scientists telling them really exists.<br>
<br>
"What happens next," he continued, " depends on how hard we press for we press for more action. The negative attitudes toward UFO phenomena are well developed in government circles, and one of the main causes of is skepticism is the existence of the so-called saucer clubs.  Many of them are so far out hat they scare off the serious scientists, who think that UFO's mean nothing but cultism and nuts."<br>
<br>
Such criticisms are of little concern to Major Aho, who magi tanimously welcomes Johnny-come-latelys like Dr. McDonald to the company of true believers.  "More and more important people are
coming over to our side," he told a friend as the present convention was breaking up.  "Secretary General U Thant of the United Nations has said that he considers UFO's the most important problem facing his organization next to the war in Viet Nam.  "<br>
<br>
As Aho spoke, the last of the conventioneers were driving        away supposedly armed with fresh information with which to convince a doubting world-and in the background, Mount Rainier gleamed through the dusk.  Overhead were the pulsating stars ... and maybe Something more.<br>

<br>
Curtis Peebles, "The Age of Confusion begins," <B>Watch the Skies!</B> A chronicle of the flying saucer myth. Washington and London: The Smithsonian Institution Press, 1994. p. 8-15.<br>
<br>
On the summer day the flying saucer myth began, Kenneth Arnold was a 32-year-old successful businessman, married with two daughters.  He owned the Great Western Fire Control Supply and flew his own light aircraft.  Kenneth Arnold was, in the vernacular to come, a reliable witness.<br>
<br>
On the afternoon of Tuesday, June 24, 1947, Kenneth Arnold was flying toward Mt.  Rainier at an altitude of 9,200 feet.  The air was smooth and clear and Arnold sat back to enjoy the ride.  After two or three minutes, Arnold noticed a bright flash- He saw, to the left and north of Mt.  Rainier, 'a chain of nine peculiar looking aircraft flying from north to south at approximately 9,500 feet elevation and going, seemingly, in a definite direction of about 170 degrees.'<br>
<br>
They were in the same part of the sky where he had seen the flash.  The objects were approaching Mt.  Rainier at a high rate of speed.  Every few seconds, two or three of them would dip or change direction and flash in the sunlight.<br>
<br>
At first, Arnold could not judge size or shape.  As they passed Mt.  Rainier, the objects were outlined against the snow.  He drew them later as having a curved front third, straight edges, and a rear edge that came to a rounded point.  He judged they were about fifty feet long, a little less wide and only three feet thick.  When seen edge-on, they were a black line.  The finish was mirror bright.  Arnold could see no tail.<br>
<br>
He decided to time them.  As the first object passed the southern edge of Mt.  Rainier, Arnold saw the sweep second hand of the clock
read exactly 2:59 P.M.  He continued to watch the objects as they swerved in and out of the mountain peaks.  Arnold estimated the distance to them as twenty to twenty-five miles.  Arnold also turned the aircraft to view them out a side window.  Using landmarks he found the 'chain' was at least five miles long.<br>
<br>
When the last of the nine objects passed the crest of Mt. Adams, Arnold found 102 seconds had passed.  He could still see the reflections from the objects as they continued south.  The sighting kept bothering him as he flew on to Yakima, Washington.<br>
<br>
Arnold did not measure the distance between the two peaks until he landed at Pendleton, Oregon, later that afternoon.  He found it was forty-seven miles which gave a ground speed of 1,700 mph-more than twice the speed of sound.  No aircraft had yet flown as fast as the speed of sound.  Other pilots suggested the objects might be guided missiles.<br>
<br>
Several ex-Army pilots told him they had been briefed that they might see similar objects while overseas (a probable reference to -Foo-Fighters").  A former Army Air Force pilot said, 'What you observed, I am convinced, is some type of jet or rocket propelled ship that is in the process of being tested by our government or even it could possibly be by some foreign government.'<br>
<br>
Thus, within a few hours of the first sighting, the working hypothesis was U.S. secret weapons or Soviet aircraft.<br>
Arnold took his map and calculations to the local FBI office, but found it closed.  He then decided to go to the East Oregonian newspaper.  Arnold talked with Nolan Skiff, the editor of the 'End of the Week- column.<br>
<br>
He said the objects 'flew like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water.- A report was sent out on the Associated Press wire.  It read:<br>
<br>
PENDLETON, Ore.  June 25 (AP)-Nine bright saucer-like objects flying at "incredible speed' at 10,000 feet altitude were reported here today by Kenneth Arnold, Boise, Idaho, [a] pilot who said he could not hazard a guess as to what they were.<br>
<br>
Arnold, a United States Forest Service employee engaged in searching for a missing plane, said he sighted the mysterious objects yesterday at three p.m. They were flying between Mount Rainier and Mount Adams, in Washington State, he said, and appeared to weave in and out of formation.  Arnold said that he clocked and estimated their speed at 1,200 miles an hour.<br>
<br>
When the report of the Arnold sighting first appeared, local newspaper editors considered it a hoax.  When they looked into Arnold's background as a businessman, Deputy Federal Marshal, and
pilot, their attitude changed.  The most impressive thing to them was the speed estimate. Front page stories appeared on the "flying disks," "flying platters, " or, to use the more popular term, 'flying saucers.'<br>
<br>
<B>The 1947 Flap</B><br>
<br>
The AP dispatch went out in the late morning of June 25.  Newspapers in the northwestern U.S. carried the report that evening.  The following day (June 26), it had spread nationwide.<br>
<br>
Newspapers not only carried reports of Arnold's sighting, but others which began to be made. July 4, 1947, saw a flood of reports from the Portland, Oregon, area.  Several policemen, four harbor patrolmen, and people on the street reported seeing disks "shaped like chrome hubcaps.'  They were moving very fast and oscillated.'<br>
<br>
The same day, newspapers carried an Army Air Force statement say-
ing they had not developed a new secret weapon that was responsible for the saucer sightings.  A study of the reports had -not produced enough facts to warrant further investigation." The Air Materiel Command suggested the sightings might be due to three causes: the Sun reflecting on low clouds; small meteors breaking up and their crystals reflecting the Sun; or large, flat hailstones forming under icing conditions, then gliding through the air."<br>
<br>
Newspapers carrying the statement quoted several scientists as saying the explanations were nonsense.  The first small seed had been planted.<br>
<br>
That same evening, the crew of United Airlines Flight 105 saw two formations of disks.  At 9:12 P.M., soon after takeoff, Capt.  E. J. Smith and his co-pilot saw a loose formation of five disk-shaped objects.  They called the stewardess to the cockpit.  She looked out the window and said, "Why, there's a formation of those flying disks!"<br>
<br>
The five disks flew off suddenly, then four more came into view.  The sighting lasted for ten minutes.  The next day Captain Smith met with Arnold and they became friends.<br>
<br>
The July 6 New York Times carried a list of the various hypotheses for the saucers.  In addition to the natural and man-made possibilities, it also suggested, "They may be visitants from another planet launched from spaceships anchored above the stratosphere."<br>

On July 8, the most sensational report was made.  The public relations officer at Roswell Field, Lt.  Walter Haut, said a flying disk had been found.  The next day this was retracted; the debris was identified as a radar weather balloon.  William W. 'Mac' Brazet, the New Mexico rancher who found debris, described it as pieces of paper covered  with foil, small sticks, and torn pieces of gray rubber.<br>
<br>
With the radar balloon explanation, the "Roswell incident" was quickly forgotten.<br>
<br>
The week of July 4 represented the high point of the 1947 flap.  Although centered on the Northwest, sightings had been made throughout the U.S., Canada, and overseas.  In mid-July, the number of reports started to decline.<br>
<br>
The flying saucer myth had begun.<br>
<br>
<B>The Army Air Force Becomes Involved</B><br>
<br>
In the days following the Arnold sighting, there had been no coordinated effort by the Army Air Force to collect data.  Intelligence officers were reluctant to begin local investigations, as they had no specific orders.  The event that first gained the Army Air Force's attention was a series of sightings at Muroc Field on July 8.<br>
<br>
The first occurred at 10 A.M., when several officers and airmen saw three silver-colored objects heading in a westerly direction.  The next occurred ten minutes later when test pilot Maj.  J. C. Wise was running up the engine of an XP-84 before a test flight.  He happened to look up and to the north, and saw a spherical, yellow-white object. if the object was the size of a normal airplane, he estimated it was at 10,000 to 12,000 feet and flying at 200 to 225 mph.<br>
<br>
At 11:50 A.M., Colonel  Signa A. Gilkey, Maj.  Richard R. Shoop, Capt.  John Paul Stapp, and two technicians on nearby Rogers Dry Lake were watching a formation of two P-82s and an A-26.  The technicians saw a round object: -The color was silver, resembling an aluminum painted fabric, and did not appear as dense as a parachute canopy."<br>
<br>
They estimated the object was lower than 20,000 feet and descending at three times the late of a parachute. it drifted slightly against the prevailing wind.  In their report, they said, 'It presented a distinct oval-shaped out-line, with two projections on the upper surface which may have been d to the level of the thick fins or knobs.'<br>
<br>
When the object descended to the level of the mountain tops, it
was lost from sight.  It had been seen for 90 seconds by<br>
four of the five people in the truck.<br>
<br>
Exactly four hours later, a P-51 pilot, flying at 20,000 feet, forty miles south of Muroc, saw above him a 'flat object of a light reflecting nature" with no vertical fin or wings.  The pilot tried to climb after it, but the P-51 could not reach the object.<br>
<br>
The Muroc sightings, along with others at White Sands and at atomic bomb facilities, convinced the Army Air Force that flying saucers were a very serious problem.  Classified orders were issued to investigate all flying saucer sightings.  The information was to be sent to the Technical Intelligence Division (TID) of the Air Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Field."<br>
<br>
In late July, two intelligence officers, Lt.  Frank M. Brown and Capt.  William Davidson, met with Arnold.  He gave them an account of the incident and drawings.  Arnold was asked not to discuss the sighting and to call the two intelligence officers if anything should come up.<br>
<br>
At TID, the situation during July 1947 was one of confusion bordering on panic, as each person was off investigating his own theory.  There seems little doubt TID considered the flying saucers to be "real" (i.e., not a hoax or misinterpretation).  The theories as to their origin could be divided into the earthly and non-earthly.<br>
<br>
The leading earthly candidate was the Soviets-it was thought that they might have used wartime German research to develop a high-performance aircraft.  A distant second earthly source was the U.S. Navy, which had built a disk-shaped aircraft called the XF5U-1.  The Navy scrapped the plane before it had ever flown.<br>
<br>
One memo written in July asked, 'Are you positive the Navy junked the XF5U-1 project?" Non-earthly explanations were led by alien spacecraft with space animals a distant second and a mixture of other theories far behind.<br>
<br>
By the end of July 1947, TID's confusion had passed and the Soviets emerged as the most probable source.  A-n examination of data on German wartime research and any possible Soviet developments was started. Only a few high-ranking officers knew of TID's speculations or work.<br>
<br>
<B>The Maury Island Mystery</B><br>
<br>
Raymond Palmer was quick to both publicly embrace the flying saucers and link them with the Shaver Mystery. in the October 1947 Amazing Stories he wrote:<br>
     
A part of the now world-famous Shaver Mystery has now been proved! On June 25 (and subsequent confirmation included earlier dates) mysterious supersonic vessels, either space ships or ships from the caves, were sighted in this country! A summation of facts proves that these ships were not, nor can be, attributed to any civilization now on the face of the Earth.'<br>
<br>
In the meantime, Palmer received a letter from two Tacoma harbor patrolmen-Fred Lee Crisman and Harold A. Dahl.  The letter said they had seen a group of flying saucers and had fragments from one of them.  Crisman was known to Palmer.<br>
<br>
A year before, Crisman had written a letter claiming he had had an underground battle with the Deros. Palmer asked Kenneth Arnold, to whom he had written earlier, to investigate the story.  Arnold agreed.<br>
<br>
Between July 29 and 31, Arnold met several times with Dahl and Crisman.  Dahl told him that at about 2 Pm. on June 21, 1947, he was in his boat off Maury island near Tacoma.  With him were two crewmen, Dahl's 15-year-old son, and his dog.  Suddenly they saw six very large 'doughnut-shaped" objects.<br>
<br>
Five of them were very slowly circling above the sixth which seemed to be in trouble.  The objects were spherical with flattened tops and bottoms, a hole in the center, and large port-
holes along their rims.<br>
<br>
Dahl beached the boat on Maury Island and began taking pictures. one of the objects descended and touched the center one as if to repair it. There was a dull thud and the center object began spewing out sheets of very light metal and black rocklike material.  His son's arm was injured, the dog was killed, and the boat's wheel house was damaged by the nearly molten rock.<br>
<br>
The six objects then rose and headed out to sea.  After they had left, Dahl tried to use his radio but found it was being jammed.  Dahl and his crew loaded some of the metal sheets and rocklike debris on the boat, then headed back to Tacoma.  Dahl's son was treated at the hospital while Dahl reported to his superior-Fred Lee Crisman.  Crisman did not believe his story about how the boat was damaged.<br>
<br>
On the morning following the sighting, Dahl said he had breakfast with a -mysterious stranger wearing a black suit who drove a 1947 Buick sedan.  The stranger said Dahl had seen something he should not have and warned 'that if he loved his family and didn't want anything to happen to his general welfare, he would not discuss his experience with anyone.'<br>

Dahl also said the photos were covered with spots as if they had been exposed to radiation.<br>
<br>
Crisman's story was that, at first, he was very angry over the damage.  Then he became curious and, the morning after the sighting, took a boat to Maury Island.  He found about twenty tons of debris scattered on the beach.  As Crisman was examining the fragments, another of the objects flew out of a cloud.<br>
<br>
Arnold and United Airlines Capt.  E. J. Smith examined the debris, which looked like lava rock and scrap aircraft aluminum.  They did not see the photos, as Crisman had misplaced them.<br>
<br>
By this point, the morning of July 3 1, Arnold and Smith felt the need for help.  They decided to call the intelligence officers, Lieutenant Brown and Captain Davidson.  Arnold outlined the story and they agreed to fly up." They arrived that same afternoon.  They interrogated Crisman and Dahl and examined the debris.<br>
<br>
They quickly determined it was a hoax.  Not wanting to embarrass Arnold and Smith, they did not tell them it was a hoax.  Rather, they said the B-25 was needed back at Hamilton Field the next day.<br>
<br>
Before leaving, Lieutenant Brown and Captain Davidson discussed the case with the intelligence officer at McChord Field.  Early on the morning of August 1, they took off.<br>
<br>
The next afternoon the Tacoma Times carried the headline: SABOTAGE HINTED IN CRASH OF ARMY BOMBER AT KELSO.  The article reported that the B-25, had been sabotaged 'or shot down' to prevent shipment of flying disk fragments." it continued that an intelligence officer had confirmed, "that the ill-fated craft had been carrying 'classified material'."<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Brown and Captain Davidson were killed in the crash.  The B-25's crew chief and a passenger were able to bail out. The Army Air Force found that a burned exhaust stack had set the left wing on fire.  Before the two intelligence officers could bail out, the wing broke free and tore off the tail.  There was no sabotage.<br>
<br>
The "classified material" was only a file of reports they had offered to take back to Hamilton; the reports had nothing to do with flying saucers.<br>
<br>
The Army Air Force also checked out Crisman and Dahl.  Rather than "harbor patrolmen," they merely operated several barely seaworthy boats to salvage floating lumber.  The "debris" was slag.  There was no mysterious stranger.  As the official report put it:<br>
<br>
Both [Crisman and Dahl] admitted that the rock fragments had nothing
to do with flying saucers.  The whole thing was a hoax.  They had sent the rock fragments to Palmer as a joke.  One of the patrolmen wrote to [Palmer] stating that the rock could have been part of a flying saucer.  He had said the rock came from a flying saucer because that's what [Palmer] wanted him to say.<br>
<br>
The August 4 San Francisco News also carried a report that "Mr.  Dahl went to the United Press Bureau at Tacoma and denied he had any parts of a flying disc.  He exhibited metallic stones, which he said he picked up on the beach at Maury Island shortly before the flying saucer craze swept the country.<br>
<br>
In retrospect, the newspaper publicity about the B-25 crash was the first to give a sinister air to the flying saucer myth.  The talk of "sabotage,' "mysterious stranger,- and -classified material" gave it a 'conspiratorial" atmosphere.  The Army Air Force knew it was a hoax and why the plane crashed, but the public had only the contradictory newspaper accounts.  As yet, however, this feeling of conspiracy and the myth itself remained undefined.<br>
<br>
<B><br>
Project Sign</B><br>
<br>
In the late summer of 1947, the commander of the newly independent U.S. Air Force had made a verbal request for a preliminary study of the flying saucer reports.  On September 23, Lt.  Gen.  Nathan F. Twining, the commander of the Air Materiel Command, sent him a preliminary report.  The report's conclusions were:<br>
<br>
a.     The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious.<br>
<br>
b.     There are objects probably approximating the shape of a disc, of such appreciable size as to appear to be as large as man-made aircraft.<br>
<br>
c.     There is a possibility that some of the incidents may be caused by natural phenomena, such as meteors.<br>
<br>
d.     The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll), and actions which must be considered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar, lend belief to the possibility that some of the objects are controlled either manually, automatically or remotely.<br>
<br>
e.     The apparent common description of the objects is as follows:<br>
<br>
(1)     Metallic or light reflecting.<br>

<br>
(2)     Absence of trail, except in a few instances when the object apparently was operating under high performance conditions.<br>
<br>
(3)     Circular or elliptical in shape, flat on bottom and domed on top.<br>
<br>
(4)     Several reports of well kept formation flights varying from three to nine objects.<br>
<br>
(5)     Normally no associated sound, except in three instances a substantial rumbling roar was noted.<br>
<br>
(6)     Level flight speeds normally above 300 knots are estimated.<br>
<br>
f.     It is possible within the present U.S. knowledge-provided extensive detailed development is undertaken-to construct a piloted aircraft which has the general description of the object in subparagraph (e) above which would be capable of an approximate range of 7,000 miles at subsonic speeds.<br>
<br>
g.     Any development in this country along the lines indicated would be extremely expensive, time consuming and at the considerable expense of current projects and therefore, if directed, should be set up independently of existing projects.<br>

FLYING SAUCERS.<br>
<br>
Aime Michel, "The first reports," <B>The Truth about Flying Saucers.<br>
</B>New York: Criterion Books, 1956, p. 17-24.<br>
<br>
As far as I know, the expression "flying saucer" was invented by Kenneth Arnold, an American business man.  On June 24th, 1947, Mr. Arnold was flying solo in his private airplane above the State of Washington, in the extreme northwest of the United States exactly halfway between Chehalis and Yakima.<br>
<br>
It was a sunny day, and twenty miles away the snowy peak of Mount Rainier was glittering in the blue sky. Mr. Arnold was looking straight in front of him when a sudden flash of light made him turn
his head.  Conspicuous against the white mantle of the snow, nine gleaming discs were traveling at a terrific speed, which he estimated roughly, by comparing their angular velocity with their approximate distance from the mountain, at about a thousand miles per hour.<br>
<br>
For three minutes Mr. Arnold, utterly amazed, watched the nine gleaming discs perform their evolutions between the mountain peaks, in formation, "exactly," as he afterwards stated, "as if they had been linked together at a height of about 10,000 feet." Still basing his estimate on the approximate distance of the mountain, he computed that they were of much the same size as a DC-3.<br>
<br>
On reaching Yakima he added that they were shaped like a pie pan, or better still, a kind of saucer made of some metal which was silvered over and glittered in the sun.<br>
<br>
<B>FRED </B>JOHNSON'S <B>COMPASS</B><br>
<br>
It will be remembered that Kenneth Arnold's story caused quite a sensation.  Newspapers throughout the world reported it, and<br>
some of them added ironical comments on the vivid imagination of Americans.  The mistake which they made, however, was to mention Kenneth Arnold only, for that same day, June 24th, 1947, before his story was reported in the press, a prospector named Fred Johnson, who was working in the Cascade Mountains, had noticed five or six objects in the sky exactly like those seen by Mr. Arnold.<br>
<br>
With the help of a telescope he was even able to follow their movements for several seconds.  It is noteworthy that, while these objects were passing by, the magnetic needle of Fred Johnson's compass moved about in a most erratic manner.<br>
<br>
THE FIRST INVESTIGATION<br>
<br>
American flying authorities then started an investigation.  Of course, it was their business to do so, but it is a pity that the investigators did not set about their task before the press had scoffed at Kenneth Arnold.  The evidence then collected would have had much greater value if it could have been asserted that the witnesses were not prompted by the desire to go one better than Mr. Arnold for <B>the purpose of getting into the</B> headlines.<br>
<br>
In any case, a pilot from Oklahoma stated that a month earlier<br>
he had seen a gleaming disc in the sky.  It was speeding faster than a jet plane and without a sound.  The investigators were also in-
formed that two other flying saucers were seen on June 12th at Weiser, Idaho.  They were moving in a straight line and then sud-
denly changed altitude.<br>
<br>
On June 21st there was a report from Spokane, then came Kenneth Arnold's on the 24th, and finally, on June 28th six flying saucers were seen in Nevada by an Army Air Force pilot.<br>

There were a number of other reports in addition to Mr. Arnold's.  The American authorities gave them a cursory examination and then, on July 3rd, 1947, despite this accumulation of information reported by eye-witnesses, published a communique@ to the effect that the accounts must be attributed to hallucinations.<br>
<br>
MORE SIGHTINGS<br>
<br>
But the authorities were unlucky.  On July 4th, flying saucers were seen above several towns in the northwest United States (Oregon and Washington).  At Portland, Oregon, there were several hundred witnesses, pilots, harbor authorities, police inspectors.  All their statements agreed.  They had all seen one or more discs shining in the sun and moving along at a great speed at a height which was estimated at about 40,000 feet by those mort qualified to do so.<br>
<br>
On the same July 4th and also in the northwest, above Idaho, Captain Smith of United Airlines watched the flight of five saucers for several minutes.  They were soon joined by four others and then moved off in group formation far ahead of Captain Smith's plane and easily seen against the setting sun.<br>
<br>
Captain Smith was skeptical.  He refused to believe his own eyes until his second-in-command, Stevens, and the air hostess, Marty Morrow, convinced him that he had not been dreaming. ne three of them watched the strange sight for about ten minutes, after which the nine discs vanished.<br>
<br>
<B>THE </B>ASTRONOMERS JOIN <B>IN</B><br>
<br>
This wealth of evidence, on the day after the authorities published their communique, created quite a stir.  Some journalists suggested that the machines which had been sighted in the northwest of the United <B>States had</B> been sent up by the Navy, whereupon the latter, probably far from reluctant to pass the buck to the Army, stated that this was not so, and that the circular, two-engined plane XF-5-U-1, better known as a "Flying Flapjack," had been given up after testing.  So the Navy was out of the business.<br>
<br>
It seemed obvious that some other approach would have to be made after Vannevar Bush, the expert whom President Roosevelt had placed in charge of all scientific research connected with national defense, stated that, although he knew all about the American investigations in this field, he had never come across anything resembling flying saucers.<br>
<br>
The astronomers were then approached.  Professor Gerard Kuiper, Director of the Yerkes Observatory, at the University of Chicago, declared that the phenomena described did not correspond to any known meteor and were obviously man made.  The director of another observatory gave a similar opinion and added that, in his view, the
saucers were produced by the Army.  The position now was that nobody wanted to assume responsibility for the flying saucers.<br>
<br>
THE OFFICIALS ARE ANNOYED<br>
<br>
In the United States of America, when some question or other, however trifling, agitates public opinion, the authorities receive thousands of telephone calls and the newspapers, cager to increase their sales, pester senators, congressmen, governors and commissions with their enquiries.<br>
<br>
At Washington this fuss about flying saucers was becoming a thorough nuisance.  On July 3rd an "authorized source" there supplied the Associated Press with the following statement:<br>
<br>
The flying saucers may be one of three things:<br>
<br>
I . Solar reflection on low-hanging clouds;<br>
<br>
2.  Small meteors which break up, their crystals catching the rays of the sun;<br>
3.     Icing conditions that have formed large hailstones, which might have flattened out and glided a bit, giving the impression of horizontal movement, even though falling vertically.<br>
<br>
Such was the first attempt to explain away the flying saucer angered those who claimed to have seen them and amused everyone  else.  There was so great a discrepancy between the descriptions given by the witnesses and the explanations suggested that the authorized source" clearly seemed to be making fun of the gullible visionaries."<br>
<br>
MORE FLYING SAUCERS<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for the "authorized source" the number of sightings increased and became more and more difficult to explain away.  On July 8th, pilots and officers of Muroc Air Force Base, saw silvery saucers moving at great speed across the sky.  On the same day newspapers published the story of a naval rocket expert carrying out a secret mission in the New Mexico desert, who on June 29th, had watched the flight of a silvery disc which was moving northwards at an altitude of about 10,000 feet.  This expert, C. J. Zohn, said that:<br>
<br>
1.      The object could not be a meteor;<br>
2.      If it was a machine operated by remote control, he had<br>
never heard of anything of the kind.<br>
<br>
<B>It </B>may be added that C. J. Zohn was accompanied by three other technicians, all of them equally familiar with American inventions in the way of rockets and jet planes.  The evidence of these four
experts, although not very detailed, is among the most impressive hitherto recorded.<br>
<br>
Exactly a fortnight had passed since Mr. Kenneth Arnold's strange experience.  The investigation by the American flying authorities had produced some twenty cases reported by witnesses who could be fully vouched for: flying experts, officers at military experimental stations, staffs of control towers of military and civil airports, naval officers and members of the police force, apart from a large number of casual witnesses.<br>
<br>
If the evidence had been concerned with something quite different from these amazing flying discs-if, for example, instead of the silvery saucer which recurs in all the descriptions, the witnesses had reported a more plausible machine displaying, say, the red star of the Soviets such an accumulation of evidence would certainly have carried conviction both with specialists and the general public.<br>
<br>
If the sum total of evidence had indicated that the witnesses had seen Russian contrivances of one kind or another, it can hardly be doubted that such evidence would have sufficed to justify a note of protest from the American government.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, all the witnesses told prac-
tically the same story and there was nothing to suggest that the Russians were involved.  Their story was also improbable.  The objects seen in the sky were circular, flattened, silvery, silent, with a diameter at least equal to the length of a Dakota, and capable of every variety of movement, from hovering in one spot to supersonic speeds in all directions, including vertical ascent.  It was these powers of acceleration, their most remarkable feature, which were mainly responsible for the skepticism of official and scientific circles.<br>
<br>
Jet plane technicians, accustomed to pit their ingenuity against the 49 mass-ratio," which has been described by Alexander Ananoff as the bugbear of the rocket experts, refused to believe the accounts 'Which credited a flying object with the ability to move along on a crooked course, describing an acute or obtuse angle when it changed direction, and to stop dead or to start off again at full lilt, keeping up this process indefinitely in an effortless manner and with recuperative powers which seem to be unlimited.<br>
<br>
THE ARGUMENTS OF THE SKEPTICS<br>
The technicians had the best of reasons for not believing in the possibility of such feats.  'the mass-ratio law' is altogether incompatible with them unless the gas ejection velocities used approximate that of light.  But in such a case the energy produced by the engine at the moment of acceleration would have been so great and released so violently that such a process could not possibly operate
without noise.<br>
<br>
Thus, the mass ratio law clashes with the evidence. Now this  law<br>
can  be  demonstrated   by   mechanical   means   in   a   manner   which leaves no doubt as to its validity.  It is not merely a law which is other established by experiment, liable to be displaced by some experiment.<br>
<br>
In the present state of science it is as firmly established as the fifth proposition of the first book of Euclid.  The flying saucers, or at any rate, what we are told about them, were more than <B>unlikely; they were impossible</B>, and indeed, they still are.<br>
<br>
BACK TO THE BEGINNING<br>
<br>
And yet we still have among us men obstinate or skeptical enough to have doubts about matters which have been proved and @ed and passed into a category of final scientific truths.<br>
<br>
At that time-this was in July 1947-various individuals with an inquisitive tum of mind took it into their heads to look up the records to see whether reports like Kenneth Arnold's were really new.  Whatever the explanation of the flying saucers might be, hallucination, natural<br>
phenomena and so forth-why had they not hallucination, natural<br>
been heard of before 1947?<br>
<br>
This point was stressed in an article in the Washington Star.<br>
On July 6th, 1947, after the- "authorized source" at Washington had issued its suggestion about a gliding hailstone, the writer pointed out that American airmen based in England during the war had already made statements similar to that of Kenneth Arnold:<br>
<br>
"During the latter part of World War II, fighter pilots were Yanks dubbed convinced that Hitler had a new secret weapon<br>
Yaks dubbed these devices "foo fighters," or "Kraut fireballs."<br>
<br>
"One of the Air Force Intelligence men now assigned to check on the saucer scare was an officer who investigated statements of military airmen that circular foo fighters were seen over Europe and *o on the bombing route to Japan.<br>
<br>
"It was reported that Intelligence officers have never obtained satisfactory explanations of reports of flying silver balls and discs over Nazi-occupied Europe in the winter of 1944-45.  Later, crews of B-29's on bombing runs to Japan reported seeing somewhat similar objects.<br>
<br>
"In Europe, some foo fighters danced just off the Allied fighters' wing tips and played tag with them in power dives.  Others appeared
in precise formations and on one occasion a whole bomber crew saw about fifteen following at a distance, their strange glow flashing on and off.<br>
<br>
"One foo fighter, says a war correspondent of United Press, chased Lt.  Meiers of Chicago some twenty miles down the Rhine Valley, at 300 m.p.h. Intelligence officers believed at that time that the balls might be radar-controlled objects sent up to foul ignition systems or baffle Allied radar networks."<br>
<br>
The author of this article then went on to suggest that the Ameri-
cans had discovered the secret of these contraptions at the end of the war and subsequently carried out tests over American territory.  Such a development would have explained why they were seen above Washington, Oregon and Idaho.  But a moment's reflection showed that this theory would not hold water:<br>
<br>
1.     If these "foo fighters" were German, why did they never display the slightest disposition to attack? Although the accounts given by the airmen differed in detail, the investigators did not discover a single case of the mysterious machines showing fight.  Surely Hitler would not have used such a weapon so kindly at the very time when the V-l's were pounding London.<br>
<br>
               2.     What about the famous law of mass-ratio? German tech-
nicians might ignore the dictates of humanity, but they could not get away from the laws of physics.<br>
<br>
That is why the investigation organized in 1944-45 by the 8th American Air Force resulted in a final decision.  As the investigators<br>
<br>
could discover no trace of an attack by an unknown contrivance on the American machines, they had nothing to go upon except the<br>
reports of the airmen, and they pronounced officially that hallucinations accounted for everything.  As a matter of fact an odd incident occurred at the Pentagon in 1949, five years after the official decision.<br>
<br>
Major Donald Keyhoe, who had been a Marine pilot, and later, the Chief of Information of the Air Commerce Bureau, was then carrying out an investigation into flying saucers on behalf of the magazine True.  He applied to the Pentagon for permission to consult the report by Air Technical Intelligence on the ghost fighters, but was informed that this particular file was secret.  Why?<br>
<br>
Balloons?<br>
<br>
Incidentally, it should be emphasized that the official finding of collective hallucination and fatigue was not made pubic until after the war.  While pilots were encountering shining globes and discs
known collectively as "foo fighters," the intelligence officers did not venture to put forward an explanation which was scarcely compli-
mentary to their fellow officers.  They suggested that the "fighters' in question were objects "suspended from balloons or some other kind of support invisible at night, and that the rapid movements reported  certain cases were to be ascribed to optical illusions."<br>
<br>
Professor Donald H. Menzel, Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Harvard, writes in his book Flying Saucers: "The idea that balls of light suspended from balloons could account for the observations is completely at variance with the reports.  I should rather accept the alternative that the objects were interplanetary<br>
saucers."<br>
<br>
But the Professor does not believe in the interplanetary theory...  It resembles all other explanations offered to date in ignoring certain features which still remain completely baffling.<br>

UFO TACOMA<br>
<br>
"What was it? Wonderful apparition seen over Tacoma," <B>The Tacoma Daily Ledger.</B> November 27, 1896, p. 4.<br>
<br>
Tuesday night at about 12 o'clock Mr. and Mrs. St. John saw a peculiar phenomenon in the heavens as they looked out of their window on Tacoma avenue.  Mrs. St. John first saw the strange light and called her husband's attention to it. It appeared to be high up in the heavens, east of Mount  Tacoma and moving slowly in a south easterly direction.<br>
<br>
They were lying in bed and watched this heavenly stranger a long time. They first saw it through the north window in their room, but after a while they could see it through a window several feet further south without having changed their position in bed.<br>
<br>
This proves that it must have traveled a long distance during the time they were watching it. Mr. St. John describes it as having the appearance of a brilliant electric search light and looked to be nearly the size of an arc electric light. It flashed often and each time sent forth various colored rays of light, shooting out from the center in every direction, like spokes from the hub of a wheel.<br>
<br>
It seemed to have a wavering motion and swayed back and forth in tis course through the heavens like a vessel at sea in a storm. He is puzzled to know what it was.<br>
<br>
An article in the Ledger yesterday morning speaking of an airship in California struck him that possibly this stranger in the heaves might be somewhat related to the California wonder.<br>

UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS - UFO' s<br>
<br>
Alice  Rushton, "Orting and the UFOs," <B>The History of the Town of Orting. 1854-1981.</B> Orting, Washington: Heritage Quest, 1989,p. 186-87.<br>
<br>
Much controversy and secrecy abounds the mysteries of the UFO's making the subject, perhaps, one that does not belong in this history of Orting.  However, some citizens of the area have sighted these objects, and the probability of the mystery being solved, grows greater with each passing day.<br>
<br>
On a cold, clear night in 1965, Mrs. Ozzie (Shari) Williams and the familys' baby-sitter, Sharon McComas, left the Williams' residence intending to drive into town.  But in leaving the house they noticed a strange buzzing noise much like the "hum" of electricity passing through electric wires but, somehow, "different.  "<br>
<br>
Mrs. William's horse began bucking and galloping in fury around the pasture.  The Great Dane pet ran in circles, unable to define the disturbance.  The sound seemed all around them.  Not able to know where it was coming from, they could not tell where to even begin looking.<br>
<br>
Then, against the hill to the east over the Carbon River, they spotted a lighted object which was hovering, not moving.  It was shamed slightly like the cigar others have reported, yet it was outlined by a hazy fog, with a brighter light shining from within.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Williams dashed into the house to call her husband, telling Miss McComas to remain in the yard.  However, Miss McComas also returned to the house.  When they all went to look a moment later, all that could be seen was a portion of the.,object, as it had moved closer toward town and was partially hidden by the hillside.<br>
<br>
The Williams immediately reported the sighting to the Air Force Base at McChord, who were able to detect the object upon their radar, and to follow it's movements for several minutes.<br>

A captain from the Air Force contacted Mrs. Williams at her home the following day.  A week later she received a questionnaire from Washington D. C., asking her to outline her viewpoint and for a detailed description.  They intimated that nothing would be related to her of their findings; and to date, this has been the case.<br>

VIGILANTES<br>
<br>
Janet Stwalley, "Vigilantes' rule in county short, in early days of county when law was slow, pioneers took matters into own hands and killed two desperadoes; but they paid dearly for their act," <B>Tacoma Sunday Ledger</B>. May 6, 1928 p. A-5.<br>
<br>
The doomed man glanced warily about him. On all sides were his stern visaged escorts, once his neighbors, then his enemies and now his captors. He clutched his throat and winced at the thought of a noose tightening about it. No, if go to the scaffold he must, at least he would go fighting.<br>
<br>
The wagon in which the prisoner huddled, joggled from side to side. The driver back bumped was paying no heed to the horse's gait. He wore an expression of a man who feels a deed has been well done. At his belt swung a holster, but butt of a revolver protruding.<br>
<br>
A bitter sneer quirked the corners of the prisoner's mouth, as he contemplated the distance between his right hand and the revolver. Slowly and stealthily his fingers moved along the edge of the driver's seat.<br>
<br>
With a quick movement he jerked the six shooter from its holster and before his bodyguard was aware of the act, fired a succession of shots.<br>
<br>
The driver and several others groaned as bullets plowed their way though flesh. But the murderous grimace of revenge changed to the pain as a volley of shot from the guns of his captors caused the crazed prisoner to pitch forward.<br>
<br>
A roughly hewn slab of wood in the little old cemetery behind the Steilacoom asylum tells the rest of the story, but perhaps the reader is curious about this man, his name and the events leading up to his capture.<br>
<br>
There are few men alive today who remember those trying times in the "sixties" when owners of Donation Land Claims were constantly at the mercy of "land jumpers" and "cattle rustlers." And very few in number are they who recall the formation of the Vigilante committee, one made up of staunch pioneers who grew tired awaiting the moving of the slow machinery of the far off government.<br>
<br>
LAW'S MACHINERY SLOW<br>
<br>
In those pioneer days, the law was very lax. It took an itinerate judge many months to make a circuit of the judicial districts. During the interim the district sheriff held miscreants for trial
pending the judge's visit. Steilacoom was the third judicial district as well as the county seat in the early days.<br>
<br>
One of the old timers who can recount the happenings of those years is Robert L. Chambers of Custer Station, the only living son of Thomas M. Chambers whose name is known to all pioneers of Pierce County.<br>
<br>
A boy in his teens then, Bob Chambers was impressed by the seriousness of the situation still fresh in mind he has given the writer a resume of the history of the famous Vigilantes.<br>
<br>
The lack of extradition laws made it possible and quite simple for Canadian reprobates and desperadoes to cross the border into the sparsely settled regions of the northwest. They were safe from the tentacles of Canadian government and free to commit desperate acts instilling fear and hatred into the hearts of the pioneers.<br>
<br>
Of such ilk were Charlie McDonald and his pal Gibson who came to his sad end at the beginning of this tale. Both had been dodgers of Canadian law since they had killed a man in British Columbia. They were partners in a donation land claim on Muck Creek near Roy in the early 1860s.<br>
<br>
Another pal of the two was Abijah O'Neil of Thurston County. In the fall of 1869 O'Neil jumped an improved farm belonging to a certain Charles Wren, a French-Canadian who was forced to vacate his claim on Muck Creek after the people of the county found him guilty of cattle rustling.<br>
<br>
The vigilantes formed their ranks at this time and after a stirring mass meeting at Steilacoom, September 11, 1869 with Thomas M. Chambers as chairman and Frank Clarke, secretary, they decided to exercise their united power in removing O'Neil from the Wren property.<br>
<br>
In short order O'Neil and his family returned to Thurston County but the pioneer fathers didn't count on incensing Gibson and McDonald by this act of justice. However, it didn't take long to discover that the hot blooded desperadoes were seeking to avenge their pal.<br>
<br>
The members of the committee were duly alarmed for the safety of themselves and their families. McLean Chambers, brother or Robert L. Chambers, proved to be the first vigilante molested. He was followed home one evening after a day's hunt by the two renegades.<br>
<br>
While at supper someone pounded on the door, demanding to see Chambers. He sense who his visitors were and refused to go to the door, well knowing that if he did so there would be one less vigilante to go down in the annals of history. He then asked them to come in. They thought little of accepting the invitation and
with not another word rode off.<br>
<br>
RANKS INCREASED<br>
<br>
This turn of events led the committee to increase its ranks and devise a method of capture.  Sam McCaw, then owner of a Steilacoom dry good store, was chosen captain.  With a number of recruits and a motley assortment of firearms, the vigilantes picked a place of ambush. It was in a deep gully screened from the road by heavy timber, situated between American and Gravelly Lakes.<br>
<br>
The planned to waylay their prey at this point, take them alive and hang them from the nearest tree.<br>
<br>
At the agreed time the forces assembled. LaGarde Bonaparte, a young Frenchman appointed as lookout climbed a tall fir giving a vista of the surrounding country. He had not long to wait.  Soon he saw two horsemen on the ribbon of road wining beneath him. After making sure of his quarry word was relayed to the alert vigilantes below.<br>
<br>
It seemed an interminable time before the command to advance was given and in the excitement someone grew nervous and fired. Thus warned the hunted men spurred their horses, the vigilantes hot on their heels.  Gibson and his horse were wounded but McDonald escaped injury making his getaway.<br>
<br>
with their captive in a wagon the little band proceeded to Steilacoom where they surmised McDonald was hiding. The Westbrook saloon seemed to be a probable place of concealment and as the story goes, there it was they found him.<br>
<br>
He had already surrendered to the barkeeper and faced his scowling captors in a most debonair manner. Desperado though he was, he was never dubbed a coward.<br>
<br>
SHOT DOWN<br>
<br>
But McDonald lost his attitude of levity, when, angrily, a few impatient members of the group demanded that someone shoot him. Before a fire of oats and threats he fled through a side door. After running but a short distance down the alley, he fell like a plummet under the fire of the vigilantes. Thus McDonald expiated for his misdeeds.<br>
<br>
Then the committee turned to the next item on the "docket" namely the hanging of the other victim. The reader remembers how Gibson met his end.  And although the determined vigilantes failed to carry out the approved method of exterminating the desperadoes, the residents felt they had established a good precedent.
But the valiant committee was short lived. A few months later the two score men who took active part in the machinations were charged with manslaughter and indicted by the federal grand jury.<br>
<br>
Only after a stiff legal battle at Steilacoom wee they exonerated. The best lawyers in the countryside were hired, which mean that the members of the ill fated committee had to dig deep into their pockets. A dollar then meant a great deal to the hard working pioneers and the enormity of the fees left them with little more than their donation claims.<br>
<br>
All middle aged men at the time, not one of the original vigilantes survives. Many descendants, however, are scattered over the United States. A few of them still remain in Pierce County. Among those who live in Tacoma and vicinity are: Robert L. Chambers, Custer Station, Steilacoom Lake; John Murray, Tacoma; Mrs. Belie Downey Bartlett, Tacoma; Ira D. Light, Steilacoom, John and Mat Mahon, Parkland and William Smith, Parkland.<br>

"Pierce County Troubles," <B>The Olympia Transcript,</B> January 29, 1870.<br>
<br>
In our columns will be found particulars of the troubles in Pierce County which resulted in the death of Charles McDonald and B. Gibson by shooting at the hands of a vigilante committee at Steilacoom last Saturday.  Their action has caused considerable excitement in our midst and every kind of intelligence concerning the matter sought with avidity.<br>
<br>
From all the information we can gather, it would seem that the citizens of the county had become exasperated by the conduct of these men, who appear to have put law and order at defiance, and taking the law into their own hands, pronounced the verdict of death upon them and executed it.<br>
<br>
It would appear that the citizens deemed the action justifiable to protect their own lives and property as well as the rights of others. Whether they are justifiable or not rests with the public to decide. If they had taken those men and hung them, perhaps the public sentiment would not have been so shocked; but the cause of their action rests with themselves.<br>
<br>
If sometimes seems that communities as well as individuals are compelled to protect themselves. The lawlessness and crime run riot to such an extent that all law and order becomes overpowered. In such cases it becomes the duty of all good
citizens to protect their own lives and property.<br>
<br>
They cannot do less, or else perish. We do not sanction mob violence or lynch law. Every good man will sustain the majesty of the law, but if that is overpowered and rendered futile some remedy for the peoples rights must be maintained.<br>
<br>
If the vigilance committee of Pierce County acted in the cause of right, public sentiment will justify them.<br>

<br>
"Are the acts of a vigilance committee justifiable?" <B>Olympia Transcript,</B> January 29, 1870.<br>
<br>
Early in December, I think, B. Gibson, who was a friend of Charles McDonald and who was living with McDonald at the time went and took the keys of Charles Wren's house, ordering the old man in charge to take what he had of his own out of it and leave the premises.  Gibson, as the man passed out, locked the house up, put the key in his pocket and said, " I have taken this as my ranch."<br>
<br>
F.A. Clarke, who rented the farm and who has occupied the house for the last six  years was at Victoria.  The house taken possession of by Gibson is a large two story house, well built, with a large barn and some other out houses. They farm has 640 acres or over under fence.<br>
<br>
The house had Clark's beds, furniture, etc. in at the time. He had hogs feeding, meat in the smoke house and grain in the granary and stock in the pastures. Gibson coolly took the keys and possession of the place giving orders for Clarke to remove  his stock and goods by Saturday or he would turn them loose.<br>
<br>
As soon as Clarke came home, he had this man arrested and held to bail.  McDonald and another man becoming Gibson's bail, the Justice of the peace not demanding the keys.  As soon as Gibson was released he went to Clarke's house and taking McDonald as his witness ordered Clark to move his stock and household goods at once and threatened to drive out the stock.<br>
<br>
Gibson was again arrested, one of his bail men withdrew the bail and he was sent to jail.  Gibson made all kinds of promises to not molest Clarke or his hired man in the peaceable possession of the place, and agreed not to trouble or disturb the stock and to keep out of the enclosures, so long as Clarke had possession of the farm.<br>
<br>
On the 12th of January, 1870, Gibson again goes upon the farm,
builds a log house in the door year and puts a notice up that he is the owner of the place. Charles Wren being up here went out  to see Gibson. He was not at home or on Wren's farm. This was January 17th. About this time or the day before, Charles McDonald sent word to Clarke that Gibson had turned his stock out of the pastures.<br>
<br>
Clarke went out with Wren, and as Gibson was not there Clarke went to McDonald's house to see him. Clarke again having put into the pastures all the stock he could find.  Wren took down the notice and left.<br>
<br>
Gibson was in company with Charles Rhodes and they were out hunting, but came back to McDonald's while Clarke was there. Gibson in the meantime seeing that some one had taken his notice down, as soon as he saw Clarke he started abusing him and wanted to fight but Rhodes and Mc Donald spoke to him and when McDonald him that Wren took his notice down he swore that he would kill Wren. McDonald and Gibson went in hunt of Wren but did not find him.<br>
<br>
As you know the people of this county drove Wren off in 1864 and feel it their duty to defend and protect his property. Then his two brothers and a nephew who appealed to the people. "You have driven Wren away, then do not let these men steal his property."<br>
<br>
Abijah O'Neal, his family and a man named Lashuer were removed from one of  Wren's farms which they had jumped in Yelm Prairie and admonished to stay there.<br>
<br>
The people went to the Muck Farm, tore down Gibson's house and left a notice for him to leave the property alone and signed their names.<br>
<br>
Clarke again had Gibson arrested but he refused to come in with the sheriff. Gibson fortified an old log house to defend his right to  jump the farm, worth $5,000 or more. He promised to be in Steilacoom the next day so he did, but made many threats against the twenty men who warned him to leave the place, each one had to die for taking down his house and leaving their names  there.<br>
<br>
In the meantime McDonald came into town to let the people know that Gibson had three hundred shots and that he wold be with him to defend their rights; said that Gibson would not come with the sheriff and that the first man that entered the lane leading to the house would be killed, etc.<br>
<br>
Not being satisfied with this, Gibson and McDonald rode around the country to find several men who had signed the notice notifying them to leave Wren's farms. Luckily Gibson and McDonald found none at home. And the threats they made to kill these twenty men cost them their lives.<br>

It was, as you see, self-preservation either Gibson and McDonald must die or these twenty men and God knows how many more, as McDonald and Gibson had made threats that they would have twenty rough and desperate men in Seattle, who would come to their assistance, and who would also take claims here.<br>
<br>
But all things must have an end. while Clarke and Wren were in Olympia settling up their old and long dispute, other men were being hunted by Gibson and McDonald.  The citizens became satisfied that either the parties who were in this trouble would be killed or Gibson and Mcdonald must die, so they determined to same themselves.  Though the whole thing looks bad and as some say it is cold blooded murder, still who would not do as these men did?<br>
<br>
While we cannot so fully indorse lynch law these men had placed themselves outside of all law by their threats and acts<br>
<br>
The vigilantes shot at McDonald and Gibson on the road and wounded Gibson and his horse badly, but McDonald escaped uninjured and when he arrived here he was told that if he remained in town he would be killed, but refused to leave, thinking that they were not in pursuit of him.<br>
<br>
The vigilantes followed Gibson to the garrison and took him, and then proceeded to Steilacoom, where they killed McDonald as you have learned.  He gave his pistol to a friend and begged for his life. Said he was disarmed; but when he was killed he had a bowie knife found upon him. He is believed to have killed Adams in british Columbia,; and had been in so many bad scrapes that these men could not trust him.<br>
<br>
He was shot running for his life, a whole load of buckshot passing into one ear and coming out back of the head.<br>
<br>
Gibson is supposed to have killed a man in Idaho and one in California and to be a desperate character. He was no coward.  When he found Mcdonald was killed and he was being taken out to be hung, he grabbed a pistol from one of the committee and shot him through the foot. Another man was shot through the thigh  by one of their own party before Gibson was killed.<br>
<br>
The Sisters of Charity took the bodies and had them prepared for burial and they were buried side by side.<br>
<br>
While no one can wish to see any one punished in this way and without legal proceedings, still when men like these defy the law, what is to be done? Let an impartial public judge.<br>
<br>

"Shooting of McDonald and Gibson," <B>The Olympia Transcript.</B>
January 29, 1870.<br>
<br>
The following telegram is from the <B>Intelligencer</B> and contains most of the details we have learned concerning the shooting of McDonald and Gibson.<br>
<br>
Steilacoom, January 23rd.<br>
<br>
It appears in relation to the shooting yesterday that one B. Gibson, formerly of Idaho, and who rumor said was an escaped murderer, some time since jumped the land claim of Charles Wren of Victoria, and was made to vacate it by a Justice court subsequently.<br>
<br>
The same man rejumped the claim, was arrested and brought to trial on Friday last before E. R. Rogers, Justice of the Peace, who granted Gibson a continuance until Saturday, at l o'clock.<br>
<br>
On Friday night it seems that Charles McDonald  and said Gibson rode to several farm houses in the county and threatened bodily injury to the owners among the number McLain Chambers.<br>
<br>
The impression now prevailed that said McDonald was an accomplice of Gibson's and upon such impression the citizens of Muck Prairie formed themselves into a vigilance committee, and started in pursuit of the jumpers.<br>
<br>
Early on Saturday morning at a point about five miles from town, Gibson was shot, supposed mortally, and was brought to the city. Meantime McDonald had entered the city and made boisterous demonstration, and while doing so the  Vigilance committee came down with the body of Gibson and surrounded McDonald at Westbrook's saloon.<br>
<br>
McDonald disarmed himself of all weapons, excepting a large knife, and wanted to make a statement but would not be listened to when one of the committee cried "Shoot the son of a b------!"<br>
<br>
McDonald then ran through the alleyway jumped over a railing and was making his way out betweens Wood's law office (formerly) and Cates' building, when a ball entered his left temple and he fell.  After struggling about three hours, he died.<br>
<br>
Gibson in the meantime was taken up on to the hill beyond the jail, when lo and behold he raised up and grabbed John Highstream's pistol and made fight, firing two shots, the ball taking effect in the leg of John Legard and Highstream, but wounding them very slightly.  gibson was then shot through the head and died instantly. The bodies were taken charge of by the Sisters of charity and will be buried today.<br>
<br>
The committee has abandoned their organization and returned home and thus has ended a most deplorable trouble.<br>

We learn further that sheriff Carson started from town for the place where the first shooting occurred immediately upon hearing of it. At the garrison he, with his deputies, were taken by the vigilantes and kept under guard during the day.<br>
<br>
The funeral took place on Monday, the bodies being buried at the garrison graveyard.<br>

WILLIAM D. VAUGHN<br>
<br>
At the time (of Byrd's murder) I was living five miles from Steilacoom on my ranch. Mr. Berry, who had bought and lived on part of my place, came out from town one evening about sundown and told me that Byrd had been shot and Bates was guilty of the dastardly deed.  I tried to organize a company and go and hang Bates that night, but they would do nothing until morning.<br>
<br>
We all went to town the next morning and I called to see Byrd. He was still living, but was very weak. They would not allow me to speak to him, but to look at him strengthened the desire to see his slayer meet his just reward.<br>
<br>
I left the room with tears in my eyes for he had always been a good friend to me. I had bought cattle and lumber of him and had bought feed at his mill. I would sometimes tell him I did not have the money to pay for it, but he always said that made no difference, that I could have a thousand dollars worth if I wanted it.<br>
<br>
The more I thought of his untimely end, the worse I felt about it and I started out to get men to help swing Bates up. I found twenty men who agreed to hang him if Byrd died, but I wanted to string him up then for it was plain that his intentions were to kill Byrd on the spot.<br>
<br>
Byrd died at ten o'clock that night, and the next morning we adjourned to an old stable that stood near the jail. We put a pole out from the top of the stable on which was fastened a block and tackle. We took a big piece of timber which we used for a battering ram, and tried the jail door, but we could not gain access.<br>
<br>
Steven Judson was then the sheriff and he braced the door on the inside. Philip Keach had taken a new ax up with him and Thomas
Headly took the ax and began to chop the door, but the door was so full of spikes that nothing was made by that effort.  I then took the ax and place in on the bolt which locked the door and told Headly to strike the ax with a sledge hammer which he did and the bolt was cut in two<br>
<br>
M.J. West was picking a hole in the brick with a crowbar, but I told him we would get the door open. I took the crowbar and pried off the casting the door was bolted to and took the casing for a pry and broke it open.  The door fell out toward the men and Philip Keach had his army slightly hurt.<br>
<br>
H. D. Montgomery made a rush to go in past the sheriff but he pushed  him back. I then caught the sheriff by the arm and dragged him out of the door, down the steps to the ground and B. Dolbear got him by the arm and we held him and the others rushed inside the jail.<br>
<br>
I was going to let the sheriff go, but the men told us to hold on to him and take him down town for they meant to hang Bates. While we were at work trying to get into the jail two layers were on hand and they told us we would have to suffer for it.<br>
<br>
While we kept the sheriff down town, the other men strung Bates up. When there were about to hand him, he said he wanted to see old man Meeker, and tell him what to do with his property.<br>
<br>
He said he was willing to die if he could kill Dr. Springs and Montgomery, brother-in-law of Erastus Light and after husband of Ellen Byrd.<br>
<br>
Bates was hung in the morning and when I left town after dinner time his body was still hanging. Thus ended the life of one of the cowardly dastardly fiends of crime which infested this coast a few years ago.<br>
<br>
Such punished is rarely meted out to anyone in these days, and we all look at the prosperity of this grand country with pride. The strides we are making will be noted over the entire country and we may expect as good and peaceable a people as is to be found in any part of the world.<br>

<br>
Vigilantes!<br>
<br>
The phrase swept the country like wildfire.  Down in old San Francisco, the mysterious organization struck terror into the hearts of the evil ones.<br>
<br>
Up north at Steilacoom, there wasn't so much need of vigilantes, but a band of them was formed anyway.  They rode out on the historic day of January 22, 1870, but they cut a rather sorry figure, and failed to gather much glory unto themselves. liere is the story of how the Pierce county vigilantes rode:<br>
<br>
There were two gamblers who lived out at about where the Country Club now stands on American lake.  Their names were Charles McDaniel and Benjamin Gibson.<br>
<br>
The vigilantes suspected that McDaniel and Gibson were assisting Lady Luck by doing a little cattle rustling on the side, so a committee of 27 men decided to take the law into its own hands and do away with them.<br>
<br>
On this cold January morning, the two men, all unsuspecting, mounted their horses and headed in for the metropolis of Steilacoom.  McDaniel is remembered as a fine figure of a man, with coal-black moustache and goatee, who wore a long coat exactly like that of a movie gambler.<br>
<br>
The commitee of 27 were in ambush between Gravelly and Steilacoom lakes, in a little hollow.  Without a word of warning, they opened fire on the two startled gamblers, 27 men against two.<br>
<br>
The vigilantes, it must be said, were poor shots.  In spite of the great barrage, McDaniel whipped up his horse and dashed for Steilacoom, while Gibson, near the site of the asylum, slipped from his horse with a wound in his leg.<br>
<br>
"Goodbye, Mac!"<br>
<br>
"So long, Gib!"<br>
<br>
The gamblers shouted to each other  as  they  parted.<br>
It was the last time they were ever to see each other, in this world at least.<br>
<br>
Let us see Gibson's fate first:<br>
<br>
Sorely wounded, Gibson lay on the ground while the vigilantes who
remained--half of them were chasing McDaniel--bundled him up and tossed him into a wagon.<br>
<br>
He had spirit, this man Gibson.  As the wagon drove toward Steilacoom and certain death, he suddenly raised up and drew his revolver from his holster.  The amateur vigilantes hadn't even disarmed their victim!<br>
<br>
Someone reached over and shot him through the head.  Thus died Gibson, bad man and gambler, but game to the end.  He passed on scrapping.<br>
<br>
McDaniel, in the meantime, won  the  race  to  Steilacoom.<br>
He dashed-- into a saloon.  The crowd of vigilantes,  thirsting for blood, soon arrived.<br>
<br>
McDaniel walked to the door of the saloon, faced the crowd, and tossed his gun and cartridge belt to the ground.<br>
<br>
"I'm unarmed, boys, " he called.<br>
<br>
There was silence for a moment.  Then--"Shoot the someone in the rear of the crowd called.<br>
<br>
There was a rush.  McDaniel turned and ran out the back door of the saloon.  A hail of bullets cut him down in his tracks.  The vigilantes had made their kill!<br>
<br>
There was a perfunctory hearing, but no one was convicted.  The affair was listed under the head of "Too bad." The vigilantes, probably ashamed of their poor showing, never rode forth again.<br>
<br>
Today, beneath the green grass on the asylum grounds, McDaniel sleeps.  Over his head they wrote these words: "Died by hands of violence, January 22, 1870.<br>

<br>
SOCIETY SOMEWHAT RUDE<br>
<br>
All tedious things finally come to an end. The winter at length
broke up and the spring came. Ben's father, mother and brother came up this time and moved into a larger log house that Ben had built and they lived in rude style.<br>
<br>
But ruder than the style of living was the state of society. Horse thieves, cattle thieves, cut throats, gamblers and blacklegs infest the country. Ben has a little faithful watch dog and night after night they sleep in the open prairie to protect their horses.<br>
<br>
More than once that little dog saved their animals from being stolen. But oxen wee frequently driven off and butchered. A reign of terror existed. The law was invoked but was powerless to protect either life or property. What was to be done?<br>
<br>
A vigilance committee was formed comprising most of the  law abiding citizens in the valley. Day after day, night after night was Ben out with his little gun to help drive off the thieves. Then things began to be done. One Saturday, a large band of cattle was stolen and driven from the Umatilla valley across Ben's father's place out into the hills. There was riding in hot haste.<br>
<br>
There were maneuvers and counter maneuvers. Not much was known and less was told. But the next day as Ben rode six miles up to the town to attend church, off on one side of the road was one of those cattle thieves. He had a rope around his neck and was tied to a tree. The rope was tight around his neck. Near by was his saddle and pistol. His horse was turned out to grass. He did not steal any more cattle.<br>
<br>
Six toed Pete got out of jail, was caught after night in the school house where Ben taught school. At daylight on Sunday morning he was taken past Ben's father's house towards town. He did not get out again.<br>
<br>
A horse thief rode a fine horse one day through the woods on Ben's father's farm. He was followed by two young men. Shots were heard. A few hours afterwards, the fine horse ws found dead in the road and the rider had been dragged through the bushes and thrown into the creek. Both had been shot.<br>
<br>
MEN ARE SHOT DOWN<br>
<br>
Similar reports came from different parts of the valley. In the course of those few weeks it was reported that there were some fifteen less thieves living. There was an exodus of a certain class and property was safer and lives wee safer.<br>
<br>
The center of the conflict was transferred to the Boise country. There the deputy sheriff was shot by Fred Patterson, a gambler, and the blacklegs terrorized the country. They had their own way.<br>

In the fall Fred Patterson came down to Walla to even up things. He was closely watched, but was very watchful himself. He was a fine looking man, rode a splendid horse; always went heeled, as they called it; that is, heavily armed and was a dead shot.<br>
<br>
He gambled and rank and none dared say him nay. Towards spring he met his fate. As the expression was, in those days, there was another man for breakfast. An insignificant looking night watch man, who always carried his pistol up his sleeve, was his avenger.<br>
<br>
One morning Patterson was being shaved in a barber shop which Ben had just passed on his way back from his breakfast. He had laid aside his coat and vest and removed his weapons. The night watchman came in from the rear, waited in the back room where he could see and not be seen, and watched his opportunity. When Patterson's face ws turned the other way he quietly stepped to the door saying, "You threatened to kill me last night and now I'll kill you first," fired.<br>
<br>
Patterson got out of his chair, staggered to the door and went out onto the sidewalk. Two more shots and he fell against the counter in the adjoining saloon, a dead man. the night watchman turned to the sheriff who was standing near, delivered himself up and was led off to the jail. It was the safest place he could find and was well guarded.<br>
<br>
Again there were threats and anger and fierce hat. Orders were issued and swift footed messengers rode in all directions. The next morning, as J.G. Isaacs came into the store after breakfast where Ben was clerking, he said, "The town is full of people this morning. Wagons everywhere."<br>
<br>
In a few minutes one of Ben's former neighbors came in and taking him to one side said," Ben have you got a good pistol?"<br>
<br>
"Yes," said Ben.<br>
<br>
"Let me have it today, will you?"  Most of the wagons in which the farmers rode had straw in the bottom of the beds and on raising it up one would see a number of guns safely stored there. The men on the street seemed inoffensive enough. But the gamblers saw the situation and quailed.<br>
<br>
"Give us time," said they, " and we will trouble you no more.  Within twenty four hours it was said that about forty left the city and peace reigned.<br>
<br>
What about the night watchman: In a few weeks some one with a false key unlocked the jail door in the night and he walked out. Friends were at hand. He was soon across the border and in British territory. It was said he made his way to the coast and sailed to San Francisco, from whence he took ship for China and never was heard of more.

Charles Prosch, "Vigilantes in Seattle," <B>Reminiscences of Washington Territory.</B> Fairfield: Washington: Ye Galleon Press, 1969, p. 71-72.<br>
<br>
The most thrilling, exciting and important event in this connection that ever took place in the Territory was that of January 18, <B>1882, </B>when Howard, Sullivan and Payne were hanged in a row on James street, in Seattle, upon a scantling suspended between two maple trees alongside the old residence of Mr. Yesler.  It was important because it had the effect of ridding the city for years of lawless characters, who kept the citizens in perpetual fear for their lives and property.<br>
<br>
At 6 o'clock on the evening of the 17th, as George R. Reynolds was proceeding down town from his home, he met Wm. Howard and James  Sullivan, who demanded his money and a moment afterward shot him, inflicting a wound from which he died in two hours.  An hour after the shooting the citizens met as a vigilance committee and organized searching parties, who scoured the city in all directions.  At 10 o'clock the murderers were found by Gardner Kellogg and H. A. Atkins, hidden in a pile of hay on  Harrington & Smith's wharf.<br>
<br>
They were placed in the custody of the police and the next morning examined before justice Coombs.  The evidence left not a shadow of doubt of their guilt.  Then the people took the murderers and hung them.<br>
<br>
In October, three months before the event just narrated, Benjamin  Payne deliberately shot David Sires in the street, while the latter was on duty as policeman.  Payne was arrested by James  Woollery the same night and lodged in jail there to remain until he found means to escape or until such time as he could be brought to trial without danger of conviction.<br>
<br>
After the hanging of Howard and Sullivan, somebody reminded the people of the almost forgotten murderer in the jail, and two hundred men started at once after Payne, whom they brought down  to  the  maple trees and strung up beside the other two.<br>
<br>
Clear as was the guilt of these men, it was extremely doubtful if either of them could have been convicted and punished under the law as then and now too commonly administered.  It too often happens that the law affords more protection to the criminal than it does to his victim.  There is usually no sympathy, in or out of court, to spare for the murdered man and those dependent upon him; it must all be bestowed upon the murderer.  This is a sufficient
vindication of the people for their prompt and praiseworthy action in the<br>
hanging of the three men named.<br>
<br>
Long after the event just narrated, when somebody spoke to Mr. Yesler of cutting down the maple trees upon which these men were hanged, he is reported to have said:<br>
<br>
"Those trees never bore but one crop of fruit, and that was the best crop that ever trees bore."<br>
<br>
Well and truly said; no trees ever bore so good a crop.  To show the salutary effect of this action of the citizens an amusing incident, related to the writer at the time it occurred, <B>will suffice.<br>
<br>
For some months previous to this wholesome</B> hanging there was a steady stream of blacklegs and cut-throats flowing into Seattle, and hardly a day passed that did not bring one or more of them from Portland.  Among the number were these three men.  On the day of the summary execution the police ordered the gamblers and all suspicious characters they could find to leave town.<br>
<br>
Soon after this order was issued, one of the policemen, while on duty on the wharf, witnessed the meeting of two well dressed men, one of whom had just landed and the other he recognized as one of the banished gamblers.  The latter immediately related to his friend the occurrences of the day, and concluded by saying that he and others had been ordered out of town.<br>
<br>
"And are you going?" asked his friend.<br>
<br>
"You bet I am," was the instant reply.<br>
<br>
It was evident that the scenes of that-memorable day had inspired him with a fear of the people which he had never entertained of any court of law or justice.<br>

Oscar Osburn Winther, "Vigilantes and the Mountain Code,"  <B>The Great Northwest.</B>  New York: Knopf, 1950. p. 245-250.<br>
<br>
In 1862 the Salmon River region, scene of early mining activities
was plagued by bad men until vigilantes stamped them out either by hanging or ostracism.  The same happened at Lewiston, where Lloyd Magruder, a prominent citizen, and five others in a party were murdered for money supposedly in their possession.  This bloody affair has since been referred to as the Magruder massacre.<br>
<br>
Describing the situation at Boise in 1864, Thomas Donaldson, an Idaho pioneer, reminisced: "Boise contained at that time a splendid assortment of murderers, robbers, and tinhorn gamblers.  They were offscourings of all the abandoned and worn-out mining camps in the territory.- Most notorious of that fraternity were the Updyke and Dixon gangs.<br>
<br>
For a period of about three years they robbed at will in and around Boise, but in 1866 vigilantes went to work with a vengeance.  Then it was that the leader, Dave Updyke, was, to use a popular expression, "strung up." His body was found in an old shed bearing a sign which read: "Dave Updyke, the aider of mur-
derers and horse thieves.  XXX." James Dixon was next, and on his lifeless body was pinned a list of crimes attributed to him.<br>
<br>
Favorite targets for outlaws were pack trains and stagecoaches; attacks continued at intervals in Idaho through the territorial period, and exploits of "road agents" were, to say the least, daring.  For instance, in 1880 the7Salisbury, Gilmore and Company stage, carrying Wells Fargo treasure, was robbed at Glenn's Snake River Ferry near Boise.<br>
<br>
It was after dark and the southbound stage was overdue.  The hostler bad just hung out a lantem when into the station jumped two armed men.  They bound and gagged the bostler and threw him into a stable.  When the stage arrived the road agents ordered the driver and one sole passenger from their seats and then proceeded to loot the express box, mail bags, and the station.<br>
<br>
Their job accomplished, the two highwaymen vanisbed into the darkness as mysteriously as they had come.  Wells, Fargo and Company lost no time going in pursuit.  They had such a good description of the men that within one week the guilty ones were hailed into judge H. E. Prickett's federal court at Boise.<br>
<br>
The trial was expeditious; the men were found guilty of robbing the mails and jeopardizing human lives.  The sentence was for life in the penitentiary.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, legal justice was not always attained with such dispatch in Idaho, and most frequently it was left to popular tribunals to dispense justice.  Not infrequently a simple statement such as the following would appear in local -newspapers: "David English, Nelson Scott and Wm.  Peoples who were arrested here a week or two since on charges of highway robbery were hung by the citizens of Lewiston, on Saturday night last."<br>
<br>
Then, as if a moral justification were needed, the newspaper
added: "If guilty the retribution was just that they were guilty there was not the remotest doubt.<br>
<br>
In no place were desperadoes so well organized, so vicious and bold, as in Montana.  Established governmental machinery failed to cope with the crime wave that swept along Montana's many lonely, mountain trails.  A series or holdups and slayings began in October, 1863.  It was not at first known who committed these acts, and to what extent they were a part of an organized scheme of operations.<br>
<br>
But as the holdups continued in such methodical fashion without anyone's being brought to justice, suspicion belatedly turned upon Henry Plummer, the Sheriff of the Bannack and Virginia City dis-
tricts.  Distrust of the Sheriff was amply justified.  He was actually the evil genius under whose businesslike direction a gang of about one hundred highwaymen, cattle rustlers, borse thieves, and murderers operated with precision, deftness, and skill.  Plummer was an easterner by birth and rearing, but no one seems to know his native state.<br>
<br>
Although it was not at first known to the citizens of Bannack, this outwardly respectable man had behind him a long list of crimes, including murder, committed in New England, Nevada, Califomia, and Idaho.  During 1861 be had lived in Lewiston with a woman erroneously thought to be his wife.  The two bad moved freely in respected social circles of this city, while he had been establishing leadership in a band of outlaws that terrorized the mining camps of Idaho.<br>
<br>
Finally two of the Lewiston culprits were hanged.  This grim act proved sufficient warning to the rest who moved on to new pastures.  Plummer, together with several of his intimates, went to mining camps of Montana where with added recruits he formed the notorious gang of "The Innocents." The organization of this group was amazingly intricate.<br>
<br>
There were various grades of officers, each offic@@eing filled according to the capability and criminal aptitude of each man.  Plummer was naturally first in command, with "Billy" Bunton probably as gangster Number Two.<br>
<br>
George Ives, Ned Ray, Buck Stinson held high ratings by their chiefs; "Clubfoot George" Lane, "Long John" Franck, "Gad" Moore, "Old Tex" Crowell, "Dutch John" Wagner, and the rest had their special assignments.  Men of another type sought and achieved key positions in public life, as for example Plummer, as Sheriff at Bannack, and jack Gallagher, his Deputy Sheriff, at Virginia City.  Several served as stool pigeons; others were given jobs of marking the stages which were known to have treasure aboard.<br>
<br>
Only the most dexterous gunmen were assigned to actual highway operations.  The most daring and brutal of the gunmen were Ives and Crowell.  Ives was cold-blooded.  Once when his sawed-off
shotgun failed to kill his victim, Ives stepped over to the injured man, and while talking calmly of this and that, drew bis revolver and finished the job.<br>
<br>
Not all were known to each other, but members wore a special sailor's tie-knot as identification.  From the "inside" Plummer kept in personal touch with bis men by going frequently to the gang's rendezvous, "Robbers' Roost," and gave as his favorite excuse for leaving town inspection of his "silver deposits."<br>
<br>
Suspicion of Sheriff Plummer reached a climax with his lassitude in what was called the Thomas Caldwell robbery.  Immediately following this event a group of about twenty-five irate citizens gathered at Virginia City and then set forth in search of "Robbers' Roost." Early the next morning the place was found and approached.  Shortly they encountered a man answering the description of the suspect George Ives.<br>
<br>
At the time it was not known that a large number of the gang were present at the hideout, although George Hildennan and "Long John" Franck were among those brought in with Ives.  On their way back to town Ives attempted to escape, but was recaptured.  Once in Virginia City, the three prisoners were bound together by a logging chain to await a vengeful trial before a vigilante court.<br>
<br>
Ives's trial came first.  It was held  outdoors  and  the  public<br>
was free to attend.  After all witnesses were heard, as well as the arguments of the counsels of defense and prosecution, the judge, seated upon a wagon, gave the case to a jury consisting of twenty-four men.  Within thirty minutes a verdict was returned.<br>
<br>
Twenty-three jurors declared Ives guilty of murder and robbery; one dissented.  It was then moved as an alternative that the assembly adopt the verdict of the vigilantes that Ives was guilty.  This motion carried, and after some haggling among the crowd, Ives was led ten yards from the scene of trial and hanged.  The trial of Hilderman was brief and ended differently from that of Ives.<br>
<br>
Because he turned state's evidence, and because of his advanced age, the robust vigilantes took pity on Hilderman and allowed him to leave the Territory with his life.<br>
<br>
Out of these incidents came the more formal organization of a Vigilance Committee which served notice on the outlaws, and brought most of them to their doom at the end of a rope.  The climax came early when Plummer was caught unarmed.  He beliied for mercy, but was told: "It is useless for you to beg for your life; . . . You are to be hanged.- They took him to a scaffold where two of his comrades, Ned Ray and Buck Stinson, were swinging by the hemp.<br>
<br>
Plummer requested that he be given a "good drop" and this was
granted so far as possible.  The noose was placed around Plummer's neck and the vigilantes lifted hhn 'th their arms as high as wi<br>
they could reach, and then let go.  The date was January 10, 1864.<br>
<br>
Between the hanginy of Ives in 1863, and that of James Daniel in 1866, thirty-two road agents felt in similar fashion the increasing activity of the Montana vigilantes.<br>
<br>
Others were banned, so that no doubt remained that the Plummer gang, probably the most vicious in the West, was thoroughly and effectively stamped out.  Before that time came, however, lawlessness had cost the lives of at least 102 persons killed by this organized gang of cutthroats.<br>
<br>
With the most vicious of the outlaws either hanged or exiled, the Vigilance Conunittee had little reason for being, and did, in fact, cease to function.  Constituted authorities came to assume, more fully, the requisites of their offices.<br>
<br>
This was made easier by the gradual passing of the most rugged of frontier conditions and the steady immigration into the inland areas of conservative agriculturists, who believed in the functioning of law through constituted govenunent, and whose peaceful, quiet lives made their influence felt upon the social body as a whole.<br>

MOUNT ST.  HELENS, MAY 18-19, 1980 - A SCENARIO<br>
by Michael A. Korosec<br>
<br>
On Sunday morning, May 18, 1980, the climactic eruption of Mount St. Helens began.  From U.S. Geological Survey news releases, media coverage, and eye-witness accounts, an attempt will be made to build a scenario of the events which took place in the vicinity of the volcano that day and the next.<br>
<br>
Relatively little information is available at this time, considering the magnitude of the explosive eruption and its devastation.  As more facts and observations are collected and become available, it is likely that portions of this scenario will need to be changed.<br>
<br>
At about 8:32 a.m. Sunday morning, a Richter magnitude 4.9 earth-
quake was recorded.  Prior to the earthquake, the only visible activity on the mountain was very minor venting of steam from a fumarole at the bottom of the crater and from the small vent on the southeast rim of the crater.  The earthquake triggered the collapse of ice blocks into the crater from glaciers on the south side.<br>
<br>
A few seconds later, a large portion of the north flank of the volcano began heaving and rippling, and slipped downslope towards the valley of the North Fork of the Toutle River along a fairly flat, steep detachment Dlane.  Many steam vents opened at the top of this detachment plane almost immediately, and either dust or steam was pushed out in front of the slide.  As the downward movement of the slide exposed a deep portion of the slide olane,<br>
<br>
Perhaps 1,000 feet in elevation below the top of the detachment surface, a cloud of dark-colored ash arose nearly vertically at first, but quickly spread laterally to the north.  As the landslide continued to move downslope, the ash cloud grew verv quickly as it was blasted about 200 to 400 from vertical off toward the north.<br>
<br>
At the same time, a lateral blast was directed nearly due north through the upper portion of the slide block.  Very shortly after, the summit crater erupted with a vertical blast of steam and ash.  The vertical flank eruptive cloud was initially darker than the developing crater cloud, and the lateral blast which spread outward much more quickly than the others was the lightest in color.<br>
<br>
The leading edge of the lateral blast raced ahead of the landslide reaching the valley floor and traveling up and over the north
valley wall of the North Fork of the Toutle River.  This portion of the eruption was a classic neo Peleanne explosion directed explosion cloud, similar to the event on Mount Pelee, May 8, 1902.  As the cloud moved north from the volcano, it fanned out to the northeast and northwest.<br>
<br>
As the summit eruption grew, portions of the south crater wall were progressively removed.  A dense ash cloud rolled down the south flank of the volcano, but it is not clear from which eruptive center this ash cloud originated.<br>
<br>
On the north side, the landslide had probably reached the valley bottom.  While the slide moved most of the vertical distance as a nearlv complete block, this mass probably began breaking up at about the time the lateral blast passed over it, and spread out throughout the valley.<br>
<br>
The continuation of the lateral blast probably hurled more material from the volcano's flanks, filling the valley below with a debris deposit from Spirit Lake to at least Castle Creek, measuring 4 miles north to south and 5 miles east to west.  The super-heated ash-laden gas cloud (nuee ardente) froifl the lateral blast passed Coldwater Creek and continued to spread across several ridges to the Green River valley north and northwest.<br>
<br>
The nue-e ardente was guided by topography beyond the Toutle Valley.  The valley of the North Fork of the Toutle River was devastated 18 miles westward to about Deer Creek, just east of Camp Baker.  The westward limit of destruction on the Green River was about 17 miles from the crater.  To the north-northeast, the nuee reached Goat Mountain, Ryan Lake, and Strawberry Lookout, about 12 to 13 miles from the crater.<br>
<br>
In addition, the destructive wave extended down the Quartz Creek drainage an additional mile or two to the north from the Ryan Lake area.<br>
<br>
Within the devastated area, several degrees of destruction had occurred.  A large portion towards the oroximal end was completely stripped of all vegetation and covered by ash and rock fragments to depths of several feet.  Frees were unrooted and vehicles overturned.  Beyond this, trees were snapped off at their bases and completely stripped of their needles.<br>
<br>
Stumps were left standing but again were partially buried by heavy ash fall.  In the fringe areas, oine needles were either stripped from standing trees or singed orange in a zone about 100 to 300 meters beyond the fallen trees.  The ash cover ranged from several
feet to several inches out from the crater.  A rapid transition from four inches to less than an inch over a distance of about 1/4 mile occurred just beyond the zone of fallen trees on the far northwest corner of the devastated area.<br>
<br>
Temperatures within the zone of devastation must have been quite high, estimated to have reached 500 0 C or more.  Plastic on a blown-over truck camper 13 miles nort@i-northeast of the volcano in the Ryan Lake area was melted.  Similar occurrences have been reported for Spud and Elk Mountain northwest of the volcano.  Fishermen along the Green River in section 3, of Township 10 North, Range 3 East on the periphery of the affected area were burned badly, surviving only because they juiflped into the river when it happened.<br>
<br>
The burns occurred as they came up for air and after they left the water.  The heat evidently came u,Don them in a series of waves over a period of about 10 to 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
After the lateral blast lost its hurricane force and high temperatures, the ash cloud slowed considerably, but continued to move to the northwest and northeast, reaching Silverlake about 1.5 hours after the eruption.  The cloud moved along the surface topography at an altitude of less than 1,000 feet, traveling about 20 to 30 miles per hour.  It was this cloud which deposited significant amounts of the ash into the Mossyrock and Riffe Lake area, and much of the Morton ash.<br>
<br>
The nuee ardente or ash cloud which rolled down the south side of the voicano was inuch smaller t@ian the north side activity, descending not far beyond the slope break.  No obvious destruction resulted from this nuee, though it probably did deposit at least a thin layer of hot ash on the south flank.<br>
<br>
At the crater,, dark ash clouds were shooting upward very rapidly, reaching elevations of 50 to 60 thousand feet within several minutes of the initial eruption.  Rock fragments and pumice were carried downward along with the ash, raining out in a large area to the north and east, extending at least to the Blue Lake and Horseshoe Lake area, 25 to 30 miles away.  The ash, of course, was carried well beyond this point.<br>
<br>
Pyroclastic flows periodically poured out of the crater and down the north flank into the valley below.  These flows probably occurred throughout the day, with a few reported to have occurred the next day.  The early pyroclastic flows, along with the hot ash
and debris began melting the@snow and ice that remained on the flanks of the mountain and the broken glacial ice blocks within the valley.<br>
<br>
This water, along with ground water, possibly torrential rains from the eruption cloud, and water displaced from Spirit Lake, mixed with the ash and debris in the valley, creating small to very large mudflows which combined and began moving down the Toutle River valley very shortly after the eruption began.  This process continued, to varying degrees, throughout the day.<br>
<br>
At some point, a large mudflow develoged in the upper reaches of the South Fork of the Toutle River valley from the Toutle and Talus Glaciers.  In addition, waters from the vicinity of and Shoestring Glaciers mixed with ash and debris, creating a mudflow which moved down the southeast flank and out the Pine Creek drainage, reaching the Swift Reservoir.<br>
<br>
Hot ash and pyroclastic flows which soured down the northeast flank and across the Plains of Abraham, melted the ice fields between the Nelson Glacier and Dogs Head.  This created a very large mudflow which moved down the western drainages of Smith Creek, continuing southeast along the main course of Smith Creek into the Muddy River and reaching the Swift Reservoir.<br>
<br>
These two east and southeast mudflows raised the level of Swift Reservoir by two feet.<br>
<br>
During the course of the day, a large volume of material was removed froifl the south wall and the area between the central and lateral vents.  At tinies, two distinct pluities could be seen rising from the crater, one directly over the central vent, the other centered nearly a mile due north, just south of the preeruption location of Goat Rocks.  A large portion of this material may have been removed during the initial blast.<br>
<br>
There is no way of knowing how many individual Dyroclastic flows and nues ardentes descended the slopes of Mount St. Helens during the day and night.  Some flows are reported to have traveled at speeds in excess of 70 miles per hour.<br>
<br>
The vertical ash eruption had maintained levels of 50,000 to 60,000 feet for several hours after the initial eruption, but decreased by early afternoon to levels at times under 40,000 feet.  By 4:30 p.m., the ash cloud had built back up to its highest level, about 63,000 feet, lasting for about an hour.<br>
<br>
This large vertical blast may have been accompanied by a lateral event on the north side, such as a large nuee ardente, because another low altitude ground-hugging ash cloud passed just east of Silverlake, at about 6:00 p.m., moving north at about 20 to 30
miles per hour.<br>
<br>
By evening, the height of the vertical eruption was only 15,000 feet, but occasionally reached 20,000 feet during short blasts.  By Monday, eruptions consisted of ash erupting to only a counle thousand feet above the crater.<br>
<br>
Seismic activity consisted of an almost continuous series of low to moderate strength events during the initial phase of the eruption.  Harmonic tremors were recorded throughout the day, starting out at shallow depths of 2 to 3 km and getting progressively deeper to about 10 km by day's end.  Just before noon, seismic activity increased.  This seems to correspond with a color change for the ash, from dark to light.<br>
<br>
The activity climaxed between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m., roughly corresponding to the second large vertical ash eruptions.  After this oeriod, however, activity dropped off considerably.<br>
<br>
By Monday, with the eruptive activity on t@lount St. Helens beginning @Lo slacken, the topographic changes to the area around the volcano could be assessed.  The once symmetrical 9,671-foot peak had been transformed into a Unshaped basin nearly 2 miles long from north to south and about I mile wide east to west.<br>
<br>
The rim reached a remorted maximum elevation of about 8,400 feet, but portions of the rim were several hundred feet lower.  The north flank openina to the crater is at about the 4,400-foot elevation.  The Sugar Bowl and Dogs Head domes were preserved on the northeast side.  Most of the glaciers are gone, but a few remained, at least in part, under a cover of ash.  They possibly include Swift, Dryer, Talus, Toutle, Ape, and Shoestring Glaciers.<br>
<br>
Within the crater, steam issued frorti numerous vents and fumeroles, concentrated on the south side over the central vent, with a fevi in the area of the exposed core of the Goat Rocks donie in the northern part of the crater basin.  The crater bottom is about 300 feet below the north rim, and several thousand feet below the south rim.<br>
<br>
The Swift Reservoir south of the volcano had its water level raised by about 2 feet, representing an influx of 13,000 acre -feet of debris from Pine Creek, Smith Creek, and Muddy River.<br>
The North Fork Valley of the Toutle River had been filled to a relatively flat surface, about 200 feet above the old valley floor.  The material was a combination of ash flow, landslide material, large blocks explosively ejected from the volcano, and pyroclastic material.<br>

This valley filling extended down the valley to about Camp Baker and up some of the drainages such as Coldwater Canyon.  Spirit Lake, which had been 185 feet deep, had its shoreline and drainage 
outlet raised <B>by </B>about 200 feet, and its shoreline extended about 3/4 of a nine to the south.  The depth had been reduced to about 80 to 100 feet, requiring a filling of 250 to 300 feet of debris.<br>
<br>
Secondary activity within the valley resulting from cool waters contacting hot pyroclastic debris resulted in numerous steam eruptions and continuous fumarolic activity.  A few large steam vents and many hundred fumaroles were still active 2 weeks after the eruption, and may continue to be active for years and oossibly decades.<br>
<br>
Other features occurring in the debris-filled valley include kettle holes, where small to very large blocks of ice melted out, leaving depressions measuring up to 50 feet in diameter; explosion craters, where buried ice and water were converted to steam in contact with hot pyroclastic debris and exploded upward through the sediment cover; "badland" and "scabland" topography, where water had eroded channels, sometimes 20 to 30 feet deep, and interconnected by a maze of smaller channels; small riople and dune features, where water and(or) wind had piled or scoured ash; and large blocks of hydrothermally altered roci< from the volcano's flanks, some over 50 feet high, looking like islands in a sea of mud and ash.<br>
<br>
The May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was only one day in the history of a mountain that is thousands of years old, but that one day has left an important impact on the volcano and its surrounding area, and a lasting impression on all those who were a part of it.<br>

THE MAY 18, 1980 ERUPTION OF<br>
MOUNT ST.HELENS A VIEW FROM THE TOP<br>
<br>
b Keith L. Stoffel*<br>
<br>
We took off from the Yakima airport with pilot Bruce Judson of Executive Aircraft at about 7:15 a.m. At about 7:50 a.m., we entered the restricted air space around Mount St. Helens from the northeast and began our first pass in a clockwise direction.  Right off, we were impressed and surprised by the wet appearance of the north face.  We circled above the base of the volcanic cone, at an elevation of about 11,000 feet, taking pictures.  
The mountain looked serene, with only very minor wisps of steam blowing toward the north and west.  Striking features on the north side of the mountain included large wet areas glistening around the Goat Rocks and Sugar Bowl where small avalanches had kirked up rocks and snow.<br>
<br>
The reddish-brown debris flows surrounding the two domes contrasted sharply with the surrounding slopes.  We wondered if these flows were very recent features and if they were hours or days old.<br>
<br>
After we had completed the first pass, we began the second from the north-northeast, with a tight bank and a pass directly over the south side of the summit crater, at an elevation of about 11,000 feet.  Again we were imoressed by the serenity of the scene below.  Activity included very minor steaming from a vent at the bottom of the main crater and from a small hole on the southeast side of the top surface of the raised southern lip of the crater.<br>
<br>
Numerous wet seeps were observed on the south-facing wall of the main crater, and a small lake had formed on the crater floor just below this area.  As we continued westward across the crater's edge, we noted the immense fractures on the top of the south lip.<br>
<br>
After we looped around to the north, we began a third pass along the same path followed in the previous pass, crossing directly over the summit.  We didn't notice anything different, but the pilot thought he noticed more extensive cracking.<br>
<br>
The fourth pass began with a wide sweep to the northwest to get a better overview of the entire mountain.  We circled clockwise at a distance of about 5 or 6 miles from the summit, passing over the northern end of Spirit Lake, and viewing each of the flanks as we continued the circular path.  We turned sharply on the west side of the crater, intending to pass over the summit and continue east back to Yakima.<br>
<br>
As we approached the summit, flying at an elevation of approximately 11,000 feet, everything was as calm as before.  Just as we passed above the western side of the summit crater, we noticed landsliding of rock and ice debris inward into the crater.  The pilot tipped the wing towards the crater, giving us a better view of the landsliding.  The south-facing wall of the north side of the main crater was especially active.<br>
<br>
Within a matter of seconds, perhaps 15 seconds, the whole north side of the summit crater began to move instantaneously.  As we were looking directly down on the summit crater, everything north of a line drawn eastwest across the northern side of the summit crater began to move as one gigantic mass.  
The nature of movement was eerie, like nothing we had ever seen before.  The entire mass began to ripple and churn uo, without moving laterally.  Then the entire north side of the summit began sliding to the north along a deep-seated slide plane.  I was amazed and excited with the realization that we were watching this landslide of unbelievable Droportions slide down the north side of the mountain toward Spirit Lake.<br>
<br>
We took pictures of this slide sequence occurring, but before we could snao off more than a few pictures, a huge explosion blasted out of the detachment plane.  We neither felt nor heard a thing, even though we were just east of the summit at this time.  Dorothy saw the southern portion of the summit crater begin to crumble and slide to the north just after the initial explosion.<br>
<br>
From our viewpoint, the initial cloud appeared to mushroom laterally to the north and plunge down.  Within seconds, the cloud had mushroomed enough to obscure our view.  At about this time, the realization of the enormous size of the eruption hit us, and we focused our attention on getting out of there.  The pilot omened full throttle and dove quickly to gain speed.  He estimates that we were going 200 knots.<br>
<br>
The cloud behind us mushroomed to unbelievable dimensions and appeared to be catching up with us.  Since the clouds were billowing primarily in a northerly direction, we turned south, heading straight toward Mount Hood.<br>
<br>
After a couple minutes we felt sure we had outrun the clouds.  Behind us, we could see the clouds continue to mushroom to the north and northwest.  An ash cloud rolled across the summit and down the south face, completely enveloping'the cone and eventually obscuring all but the lower slopes- The pilot suggested turning west and flying around the west side of the cloud, but after we thought about it briefly, we realized that the billowing clouds were moving west faster than we could fly.<br>
<br>
To the east of the volcano, the ash cloud separated into billowing, mushroom-shaped clouds and a higher overhang of cirrus-type clouds.  Ash fall from the mushroom-shaped clouds was heav . Lightning bolts shooting through the clouds were tens of thousands of feet high.  Soon, the ash cloud extended to elevations in excess of 50,000 feet.<br>
<br>
We thought about flying back to Yakima and even turned to the east briefly, but again we decided against it, realizing we could never beat the ash cloud.  Sometime between 9:00 and 9:15, we landed at
a Portland airport.<br>

James G. Riby and Michael A. Krosec, "Events leading up to the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.<br>
<br>
The following summary of events leading to the major eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, has been compiled from U.S. Geological Survey and University of Washington daily updates of volcanic and seismic activity, and from notes and daily reports collected by Jim Rigby of the Division of Geology and Earth Resources while assisting the U.S. Geological Survey in Vancouver.<br>
<br>
In most cases, only the most important activity of the day is reported, ignoring minor activity which is usually emphasized on slower davs.  In addition, weekend reports are not as detailed as those of weekday events.  This does not, of course, reflect the actual activity on the volcano.  Some of the earthquake magnitudes are preliminary.<br>
<br>
March 20 - March 26 - A minor earthquake of 4.1 Richter magnitude was recorded in the vicinity of Mount St. Helens on March 20.<br>
<br>
This was the first sign that an eruptive phase had begun.  Over the following week, swarms of microearthquakes were recorded, reaching 
magnitudes Of <B>U.D </B>to 4.4 and triggering minor avalanching.  The number and intensity grew, reaching-a peak on March 26, although intensities were somewhat higher on March 25 than on the 26th-<br>
<br>
<B>March</B> 27 - A thick black plume of ash and steam was exploded from the volcano's summit, rising to a level about 7,000 feet above the newly opened crater, which measured about 250 feet in diameter.  Extensive long cracks were visible in the ice crossing the crater on the north and south, and running down the west and east sides of the volcano. one hundred thirty-five earthquakes were recorded greater than magnitude 3, ranging up to 4.7.<br>
<br>
March 28 - Steam eruptions continued through the day, commonly to elevations I of 14,000 to 16,000 feet.  Small avalanches and mudflows moved down the upper flanks of the cone.  One hundred thirty earthquakes, greater than magnitude 3 were measured, ranging from 3.'C'- to 4.9.<br>
<br>
March 29 - A second crater was observed on the northeast side of the old crater which had apparently opened dur@ing the night before.  The new opening measured about 75 feet wide and 30 to 60
feet deep.  Eruptions observed during the day would begin as combinations of ash and steam, but would convert to steam only by the end of the eruption.  One hundred thirty-eight earthquakes greater than magnitude 3 were recorded, ranging up to 4.4. The "blue flame" was first observed during the night of the 29th, coming from the smaller, northeastern crater.<br>
<br>
March 30 - Minor eruptions continued at a rate of about one every 
112 to <B>l-2 </B>hours.  The largest ash eruotions to date were noted, and the crater was slowly being enlarged.  Seventy-nine earthquakes in the range of magnitude 3.2 to 4.6 were recorded.  The blue flame was seen during the night again.<br>
<br>
March 31 - Explosive eruptions continued, and the two craters merged, with a low saddle between them.  Seventy-five earthquakes were recorded, along with -Lhe first harmonic tremor reported. 1 - Ash and steam erU ' Dtions reached elevations of 16,000 feet.  Several small fumarole vents only a few feet in diameter opened up around the east crater on the northeast side.  Avalanching and mudflows were observed, especially along the north flanks, and a thermal infrared survey detected a hot spot at about an elevation of 5,000 feet just west of the Timberline area.  Seventy-six earth-
quakes over magnitude 3 were recorded.<br>
<br>
Many small steam eruptions were intermingled with occasional larger steam and ash eruptions, reaching elevations of 14,000 to 15,000 feet, and one large eruntion in the late afternoon to about 20,000 feet.  Eighty-eight earthquakes over magnitude 3 were recorded.<br>
<br>
Ash and steam eruptions were accompanied by several earthquakes greater than magnitude 4, with the largest measuring 4.9. In addition, harmonic tremors were recorded again, as during the last two days.<br>
<br>
<B>April 4 - April</B> 14 - Earthquake activity continued at a moderate rate, with 2 to 5 events per day in the range of magnitude 4.0 to 4.7. A small eruption occurred on the 8th of April, but eruptive events were generally lacking during this period, and seismic activity decreased towards the end of the period.  Harmonic tremors occurred on the 4th, 5th, 7th, 10th, and 12th.<br>
<B><br>
<br>
April 15 - April 22</B> - There was very little change in the frequency of eruptive activity, with a few small steam eruptions occurring daily.  There was a slight decrease in seismic activity during the beginning of this period, but the level picked up on the 20th, with fiftyseven earthquakes over magnitude 3, and with seven earthquakes greater than magnitude 4. No harmonic tremors were recorded during this period.<br>
<B>
April 23 - May</B> 6 - Over this period, there was virt:ially no eruotive activity.  Steaming, while sometimes intense at the beginning of the period, was reduced to smaller fumarolic activity by the end of Aoril.  The forination of a bulge on the north-northeast flank was detected on April 23, and was suspected to have been growing since the eruptions in March.  By the end of April, the area was defined as being I mile long and 0.6 mile wide.<br>
<br>
The axis of the elongated area trended northeasterly from the north side of the summit crater toward the Sugar Bowl.  The maximum uplift had been 320 feet, and Goat Rocks was moving north-northwest at about 5 feet a day.  The area affected included the Forsyth, Leschi, and Loowit Glaciers.  By May 1, it was determined that the bulge was moving out laterally faster than it was being uplifted.<br>
<br>
Seismic activity continued at a slightly reduced rate, with further decrease on April 30, but returned to former levels (about 31 per day) during the first week in May, with 5 to 8 events greater than magnitude 4 daily.  No harmonic tremors were recorded..<br>
<br>
Eruptive activity  increased  dramdtically  with  steam and ash eruptions reaching elevations of 13,000 feet with increased<br>
sulfur emission.  Steam emissions were also detected at two sites on the Boot on the north flank, and from crevasses at the head of Shoestring Glacier on the southeast flank.  The feature at Shoestring was enlarged somewhat by the end of the period.<br>
<br>
The lateral bulging continued on the north-northeast flanks, slowing down on May 10 to 11, but picking back up by the endof the period to about 5 feet per day.  Large magnitude seismic activity increased during this period, with 6 to 11 events greater than magnitude 4 daily, although the number of earthquakes between magnitudes 3 and 4 decreased slightly.  Two harmonic tremors occurred on May 8.<br>
<br>
May 15 - May 17 - Eruptive activity decreased, with only very few minor short-term steam eruptions.  The bulge continued to grow at about the same rate, and seismic activity over magnitude 3 decreased from 39 per day on May 15, to 33 on the ]6th, to 18 on the 17th, with 8 earthquakes over magnitude 4 on the 15th, 10 on the 16th, and 6 on the 17th.<br>

Editor's Note.- The Mount St. Helens Geological Area is part of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, USDA, Forest Service.  As one of 15 special Geological Areas in the National Forest System, it is being managed for public enjoyment and scientific study.<br>
<br>
Through visitor centers near Toledo and Ridgefield, Washington, the Forest Service offers information and interpretive programs to help visitors understand the special features of Mount St. Helens.<br>
<br>
This account of the 1980 volcanic activity at Mount St. Helens is from an information pamphlet (GPO 1980 699-331) published by the U.S. Forest Service, Gifford Pinchot National Forest, Pacific <B>Northwest</B> Region.Vancouver, Washington.<br>

VANCOUVER, WASHINGTON<br>
<br>
A beautiful, serene lake sheltered by lush forests, a tall, symmetrical, snowcapped peak dominating the skyline, a mountain graced with the beauty of geologic youth - these are the memories of Mount St. Helens.  These landmarks of the Pacific Northwest have been forever changed by one of the most cataclysmic events witnessed on the North American ontinent - an explosive volcanic eruption.<br>
<br>
The geologic history of the mountain, including recorded accounts of activity in the early-to-mid 1800S indicated that the mountain was only sleeping, not extinct.  On March 20, 1980, an earthquake measured at magnitude 4.1 on the Richter Scale announced to the world that Mount St. Helens was stirring.  Earthquakes continued with increasing frequency.  By March 27 it was difficult to distinguish between individual earthquakes due to the constant shaking of the ground.<br>
<br>
Geologic  Setting<br>
<br>
Mount St. Helens stands on, and partially conceals, the eroded remains of an earlier volcano active between 2,500 and 40,000 years ago.  The mountain has been formed over the last 2,500 years.  Most of the upper part of the cone was built only 350 years ago.<br>
<br>
The mountain is known as a "strata" volcano.  It is composed of lava flows, ash flows, and fragmented material of pumice and other debris in successive layers.Caves known as lava tubes are found within some lava flows.  These are formed when a crust develops on the surface of a fresh stream of lava.  When the lava flow subsides, the molten material drains away, leaving a hollow tube or 
cave. Many caves in the lava south of Mount St. <B>Helens were formed 
this way.</B><br>
<br>

<B>In the past Mount St. Helens has had</B> <B>periods of volcanic activity

altemating</B> with periods of relative calm.  Around 1800, a dormant 
period of about 150 years was broken by a volcanic pumice erup<B>tion.  
Mount St. Helens was then intermit</B><B>tently active until perhaps as 
late as 1857.</B><br>
<br>

<B>Newspapers of that period carried eye</B> <B>witness accounts of these 
eruptions,</B> <B>which were especially frequent in the</B> <B>1830s and 1840s.  
Whether or not the 1980</B> <B>activity will continue for as long a period</B> 
<B>of time is not known.</B><br>
<br>

<B>Earthquakes</B><br>
<br>

<B>Earthquakes have been a regular fea</B><B>ture of Mount St. Helens' 
volcanic activ</B><B>ity.  The first quake signaling renewed</B> <B>volcanic 
activity occurred on March 20,</B> <B>1980.  During the next eight weeks, 
nearly</B> <B>3,000 quakes were recorded with a Richt</B><B>er magnitude of 3.0 
or greater.  Of these</B> <B>quakes,over371weregreaterthan 4.0 mag</B><B>nitude, 
with the largest one measuring 5. 1.</B><br>
<br>

<B>A Crater Is Formed</B><br>
<br>

<B>When an eruption just after noon on</B> <B>March 27 blasted a crater in 
glacial ice</B> <B>near the summit, Mount St. Helens' 123</B><B>year sleep was 
over.  Additional eruptions</B> <B>throughout the evening of the 27th en</B>-

<B>larged the initial crater and threw pulver</B>ized rock and steam into 
the night sky.  By mid-morning March 28, a second crater <B>had formed 
near the first.  During the next</B> <B>few days, explosions enlarged both

<br>

<B>Harmonic  Tremors</B><br>
<br>

<B>On April 3 a new type of seismic activ</B><B>ity, a harmonic tremor, was 
recorded.</B> Harmonic tremors are a continuous vibration of the earth caused by the movement of molten rock (magma) beneath the volcano.  A section of the north side of the mountain began to swell by as much as 4 to 5 feet a day from forces within the mountain.  Minor earthquakes, eruptions of steam and ash, and other activity alter-
nated with quiet periods.<br>
<br>
GIGANTIC EXPLOSION<br>
<br>
Practically without warning, Mount St. Helens erupted at 8:32 Sunday moming, May 18, 1980.  The eruption began with a gigantic explosion which hurled approximately one cubic mile of pulverized rock and ash almost 14 miles into the atmosphere.  The force of the blast flattened trees and other vegetation in a fan-shaped<br>
area 8 miles long and 15 miles wide to the north of the mountain.<br>
<br>
Trees were uprooted, or snapped off at ground level, stripped of their limbs and layered flat like millions of dominoes spreading out from the crater.  With the blast, came fastmoving flows of superheated steam, ash, and gases incinerating vegetation in its
path and starting forest fires on the mountain's flanks.<br>
<br>
Mud flows created by melted glacial ice and snow coursed down the mountain's sides to the north, flooding into the Toutle and Cowlitz River drainages.  The flows gouged and filled the land into r@ew forms as it moved.<br>
<br>
Steam from the heated waters of what was once Spirit Lake rose as huge plumes in the air.  As of mid July, 28 deaths were immediately attributed to the hot gases and ash; 36 persons are still missing.<br>
<br>

Blanket <B>of </B>Ash<br>
<br>
Blown to the east by prevailing winds, ash from the eruption began a moving course across the United States.  Cities in its immediate path, like Yakima, Washington, some 80 miles away were heavily blanketed by the ash.  For hours after the eruption, ash blanketed out the sun over cities in Washington turning broad daylight to darkness.  Within 4 days, ash from the eruption had reached the East Coast.  The largest ash cloud reached over 63,000 feet and was traced around the world.<br>
<br>
Hazards<br>
<br>
Volcanic activity can change drastically within a few minutes.  Potential hazards include ash fallout, rapidly moving flows of mud (melted snow and ice mixed with ash), and "pyroclastic flows" made up of hot gases and light weight volcanic particles such as pumice.<br>
<br>
These pyroclastic flows can skim along the mountain's surface like an avalanche, enveloping everything in its path.  Many of the May 18 fatalities were the result of suffocation when fine ash filled the lungs of the victims.<br>

<P>
Murray C. Morgan born in Tacoma in 1916, the year the Smelter
was rebuilt and Pierce County began commandeering land to present
to Uncle Sam in return for the Camp Lewis payroll. The room in
which I was born looks out over the gulch that Allen Mason bridged
to open the North End to residential development. From that room
one sees the bay, the Cascades, the Mountain.
<P>
The enclosed world of the ravine with its singing stream (now
buried as part of a storm sewer project), the expanse of salt
water leading off to every seaport in the world, the ethereal
bulk of the Mountain sometimes manifest on the eastern horizon
still mean, to me, living in Tacoma.
<P>
One of my first memories is of being held up to look over the
railing of the balcony on the second floor of the house to watch
a long line of great gray warships steam down the East Passage,
round the point where George Vancouver dined with the Puyallup,
and anchor in the bay Charles Wilkes named Commencement.<HR>

<H4><A NAME="war">The war to end all wars</A></H4>

<P>
The war to end wars - the first war of my lifetime - was over,
though children still sang, &quot;Kaiser Bill went up the hill
to take a look at France; Kaiser Bill came down the hill with
bullets in his pants.&quot; The visit of the Pacific fleet marked
victory. Marked, too, Tacoma's linkage with the military, a growth
industry more reliable than railroads.
<P>
From our house on North Thirty-first Street on quiet nights one
could hear the trains clanking along the waterfront on track laid
by the old tunnel builder, Nelson Bennett; hear, too, the long
whistles, mournful and romantic. We used to play by the tracks,
though we were not supposed to, and the great game was to put
a penny on the rail, then retrieve it after the train had passed.
<P>
The penny would be paper thin, misshapen, and almost too hot to
touch. The money from the railroads was thinning out too. Tacoma's
romance with rails was fading.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME="railroad">The railroad</A></H4>

<P>
In 1920 the Northern Pacific moved its traffic department to Seattle;
soon afterward the rest of the western headquarters went north.
The Tacoma Lumbermen's Club telegraphed a complaint that this
was &quot;like throwing over an old love for a new.&quot; But
the NP left its shops and their payroll in Tacoma as a sort of
alimony, and the city acquired the graceful old Headquarters Building
at Seventh and Pacific Avenue as an auxiliary police station.
<P>
Tacoma's affair with the Union Pacific had ended in a breach of
promise. As for the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul, it had found
little profit in reaching the Pacific. The railroad managed to
go broke during the great twenties boom. Sold at courthouse auction
it passed into the hands of Wall Street receivers who had no sympathy
for Tacoma.
<P>
When Osaka Shoshen Kaisha, the Japanese shipping line which gave
the Milwaukee Line considerable business, shifted its terminus
to Seattle, the Milwaukee's western headquarters went too. Tacoma,
a railroad creation, was left as a way station. Only the Union
Depot and streets bearing the names of NP officials - Wright,
Villard, Oakes, Ainsworth, Wilkeson, and Sprague - recall the
days when Tacoma had a special relationship with its rails.
<P>
As children we didn't care about the loss of the termini. What
bothered us was the loss of our Mountain. Tacoma had never acquiesced
in the decision by the United States Geographic Board that the
great peak was Mount Rainier. We called it Mount Tacoma and wanted
the world to do likewise.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME="mountain">The mountain</A></H4>

<P>
In the twenties, Tacoma created another justice to the Mountain
Committee to get the bureaucrats to give us back our Mountain.
<P>
The committee marshaled considerable support. Theodore Roosevelt,
Ambassador James Bryce, Mary Roberts Rinehart, Amelita Galli-Curci,
and Will Rogers were among those who favored Mount Tacoma. Tacomans
combed the records for proof that Theodore Winthrop knew what
he was writing about when he said the Indian name was Tacoma.
<P>
Others researched Peter Rainier and announced triumphantly that
he was fat, myopic, funny-looking, foreign, and had fought against
the United States in the Revolutionary War. Tacomans persuaded
a national convention of Indian leaders &quot;to pray to the Great
Spirit Kitchemanitou to restore to the Indians Tacoma, meaning
Nourishing Breast.&quot; School children wrote essays, local historians
wrote letters to editors, and everybody wrote poems.
<P>
My father wrote one of many poems called &quot;The Mountain That
Was God,&quot; the title deriving from a highly suspect &quot;Indian&quot;
legend, and my mother, part Indian, wrote &quot;The Mountain That
Was Ours.&quot; And they lost again. The Geographic Board clung
to Rainier.
<P>
Tacomans then petitioned Congress for relief from the intolerable
burden. The Senate, in its wisdom, passed a bill on April 21,
1924, declaring Mount Rainier to be, henceforth and forevermore,
Mount Tacoma. But the Public Lands Committee of the House of Representatives
failed to report the bill to the floor. So Mount Rainier it remains,
except in Tacoma, where we usually refer to the ethereal presence
simply as <I>The Mountain.</I>

<H4><A NAME="lumber">Tacoma, the Lumber Capital of the World</A>
</H4>

<P>
Tacoma hasn't even had good fortune with nicknames. Back in the
1880s the eccentric eastern promoter, George Francis Train, saddled
the community with the sobriquet &quot;City of Destiny.&quot;
That one went sour during the Panic of Ninety-three. When the
Milwaukee Road and the Union Pacific rekindled civic expectations
early in the twentieth century, the Chamber of Commerce came up
with the slogan &quot;Watch Tacoma Grow.&quot;
<P>
That proved to be about as exciting as watching coral accrete.
Tacoma grew by only 16,000 between 1910 and 1920, achieving a
population of 96,965. Seattle during the same ten years gained
127,000 inhabitants.
<P>
Tacoma then styled itself the <I>Lumber Capital of the World</I>.
So, for a time, it was. Logging trains continued to roll in from
the mountains, bearing to the saws the carcasses of giant trees.
The ships of the world came to the wharves below the bluff to
pick up lumber from mills that lay like beached sea mammals at
the tideline. By night one could trace the curve of the harbor
by the ruby glow of the screens atop the waste burners.
<P>
Few questioned the practice of discharging industrial waste into
the sky for all to share. Particulate matter from the mills, like
the chemical exhaust of the Smelter, smelled like dollars in a
community anxious for payrolls. Nevertheless the old-fashioned
sawmill was an endangered species.
<P>
Costs rose as lumbermen chased the virgin forests deeper into
the surrounding mountains. Distances were greater, the slopes
steeper. The cream had been skimmed. There was decreasing profit
in the simple geometry of transforming round logs into rectangular
planks. A new technology arose, more sophisticated and more capital
intensive. Logs were not merely sawed; they were broken up by
machines and chemicals to be reassembled as plywood, fiberboard,
cardboard, and newsprint. St. Regis Paper Company bought the land
where the great pile driving war had been waged in the 1880s between
John Burns and the Tacoma Land Company.
<P>
They built the kraft mill which has helped to stabilize the economy
while making its contribution, too, to what is known as the aroma
of Tacoma. West Tacoma Newsprint was built at the mouth of Chambers
Creek not far from the site of Andrew Byrd's grist mill, where
Job Carr found occasional employment while waiting for the city
of his dreams to materialize.
<P>
One by one the waterfront sawmills I knew as a boy disappeared,
usually in a burst of flame, a rain of cinders, and an investigation
by the insurance company. Tacoma's publicly owned power system,
part of the heritage of the Angelo Fawcett period, lured electrochemical
industries such as Penn Salt (now Pennwalt), Hooker Chemical,
and Ohio Ferro Alloy to the tideflats to replace the lost payrolls.
They were most welcome. But they made Tacoma, increasingly, a
community in which the basic economic decisions were made in distant
board rooms.
<P>
Tacoma's struggle long since had become not to surpass Seattle
but to survive as something other than suburb or satellite to
the metropolis, to remain a community with a distinct economic
base and personality. During the Depression, survival was all.
Any activity that kept people in town was welcomed. Banks might
fail and mills might close but the oldest profession flourished
in Tacoma with a vigor unsurpassed since Harry Morgan was blindfolding
the police department with dollar bills.
<P>
During the Thirties, Tacoma received more national headlines than
at any time since the great boom of the Eighties - most of them
inadvertent and unfavorable. It was the city's misfortune to be
the scene of two kidnappings at a time when the murder of Charles
and Anne Lindbergh's son made kidnapping the most newsworthy crime.
Charles Matson, the young son of a prominent Tacoma physician,
was taken from his North End home by a gunman, sexually assaulted,
and murdered. The manhunt went on for years the FBI file on the
case remains open but the killer was never caught, or identified.
<P>
George Weyerhaeuser, scion of the timber family (and now president
of the Weyerhaeuser Company), was pulled into a car as he walked
home from grammar school. He was released unharmed after several
days, and his kidnapers were captured and convicted; but though
the story had a happy ending, it helped fix on Tacoma the reputation
of being kidnap capital of the West.
<P>
Even successes went quickly sour. In 1940 Tacoma realized an old
dream of direct connection with the Kitsap Peninsula. The Narrows
Bridge was opened to traffic fifty-one years after George Eaton,
a clerk in the NP Land Department, proposed a Tacoma to Port Orchard
railroad to link the terminus of the transcontinental with the
proposed Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.
<P>
But Galloping Gertie, as the slender, swaying suspension bridge
was nicknamed, went into the Sound almost before the echoes of
dedicatory speeches died down, the victim of design changes brought
about by demands for economy in government including bridge construction.
<B>It </B>was not to be rebuilt until 1950.
<P>
The New Deal, American rearmament which followed the rise of Nazi
Germany, and World War Two lifted Tacoma out of economic stagnation.
During the war, everything Tacoma produced was in demand, especially
soldiers. Fort Lewis, Madigan Army Hospital, and McChord Air Field,
which had been acquired by the War Department in 1938, expanded
hugely, while the tideflats sprouted shipyards. Not since the
days of Stampede Tunnel construction had Tacoma shared so fully
the heady excitement of common purpose and overtime pay. But with
the outbreak of peace it was back to the same old problems in
the same old city.
<P>
The generation that had been off to the wars returned to a town
strangely unchanged. Tacoma had won its fight for survival, but
Downtown was a relic of the nineteenth century. It was like a
pressed flower, a memory of when Tacoma had been invited to the
dance.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME="politics">Tacoma politics and Seattle's Dirty Backyard</A>
</H4>

<P>
City government, too, was something out of the past. Tacoma voters
adopted the commission form of government in 1910, when that was
the latest municipal style, like the grid pattern on streets.
For a time the system of elected department heads who sat as a
council to make policy energized municipal affairs. The combination
of legislative and administrative authority allowed able men,
like Ira Davisson, the utilities commissioner, to sell their plans
to the public and carry them out.
<P>
Tacoma's light and water departments provided electricity and
water to the citizenry and industries at rates as low as could
be found in the nation. The public works department, too, was
innovative and efficient. But inevitably innovation settled into
routine. Timeservers became policy makers. Vision perished. Municipal
politics became largely a question of who ran the police department,
because that's where the money was.
<P>
The mayor might be titular head of Tacoma but he had direct control
only of the garbage department while the commissioner of public
safety appointed the chief of police. The mayoral race drew two
or three candidates at most; the lineup in the public safety commissioner
primary usually looked like the start of the Boston Marathon.
<P>
Tacoma had an open town tradition. There had been a &quot;crazy
house&quot; on the hill above Old Town before the village was
incorporated. New Tacoma was not far behind in providing commercial
sex as an amenity. Harry Morgan gave gambling a good name.
<P>
Prohibition brought the speakeasy. Night life in Tacoma meant
bookie joints, slot machine and pinball routes, unlicensed drinking
spots, and an abundance of brothels, most of them in Opera Alley,
between Broadway and Market Street. They offered all the glamour
of a fastfood franchise, but the operators paid high rent. Reform
advocates were assured that Seattle was worse and more prosperous.
<P>
Control of night life in Tacoma centered on two local organizations
that grew up during Prohibition. Sometimes they shared, more often
they competed. There was little rough stuff, just politics and
corruption. Each side financed one or more candidates in the quadrennial
election of safety commissioner. The side that won the election
got to run things without raids while its rival planned better
precinct organization.
<P>
Change came, surprisingly enough, from within the police force.
Some idealistic young men returning from military service objected
to selective enforcement of the vice laws. Styling themselves
a Vigilance Committee they raided some joints that had paid their
dues. The safety commissioner was embarrassed. His embarrassment
increased when other cops with ties to the out of power organization
began making raids too.
<P>
The commissioner suspended several policemen for excessive diligence.
The Civil Service Board, after a prolonged hearing, ruled that
a policeman could not be suspended for enforcing the law, no matter
on whose behalf he was enforcing it.
<P>
In the ensuing uproar a reform candidate for safety commissioner,
backed by church groups, won election. Unfortunately between the
night of victory and the day of inauguration he made a tour of
inspection of the places he was pledged to close and was tape-recorded
in intimate conversation with a charmer of no discernible virtue.
His reform administration thereafter labored under difficulty.
<P>
Whenever enforcement became onerous to the forces of the night
somebody would phone the commissioner, play the tape-recording
and suggest the virtues of moderation in all things. Moderation
became so rampant that the military threatened to put the town
off limits. The American Social Hygiene Association sounded the
alarm on venereal disease. National magazines ran articles deploring
&quot;Seattle's Dirty Back Yard.&quot; A legislative committee
headed by State Senator Albert D. Rosellini held the town spellbound
with a televised investigation of Tacoma vice that made city officials
took, if not wicked, awfully silly.
<P>
Tacomans had had enough. A charter proposing a council/manager
system of municipal government was drawn up by a freeholders committee.
It won adoption at the general election of November 1952 - the,
one in which General Eisenhower was elected president. Tacomans
went on to elect an elitist city council, perhaps the best-educated
city council in the history of American governance.
<P>
Its nine members averaged six years of college education. In their
collective wisdom they hired a city manager of rigorous honesty,
who appointed an old shoe chief of police competent and content
to live on his salary. The climate changed. Tacoma won a Municipal
League rating as an All American City, night life disappeared
as a serious political issue (and almost disappeared altogether),
and the populace had time to address more important problems,
such as Tacoma's role as second city and worry about law enforcement
in surrounding Pierce County.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME="destiny">The City of Destiny</A></H4>

<P>
The City of Destiny remains unsure of what its destiny should
be. The land is much changed from that which George Vancouver
called &quot;the most lovely country that can be imagined&quot;
where &quot;the labour of its inhabitants would be amply rewarded
in the bounties which nature seems ready to bestow on cultivation.&quot;
Few would care to depend on cultivation of the land today.
<P>
Nor will Tacoma ever be the metropolis of the Pacific that Job
Carr envisioned that Christmas Day when he stood in his canoe
and shouted &quot;Eureka.&quot; It is unlikely to become, as Allen
Mason hoped when his earlier dreams of greatness had faded, a
Philadelphia to Seattle's New York, though the possibility remains
that it will be, as R. F. Radebaugh of the Ledger once predicted,
a Liverpool to Seattle's London.
<P>
The Tacoma of today, 187 years after Vancouver's visit, 128 years
after Delin started his mill among the skunk cabbages, 115 years
after Job Carr exulted in his first sight of the Sheltered Place,
106 years after the Northern Pacific chose Commencement Bay as
its terminus, 81 years after Nelson Bennett undercut the Cascades,
76 years after the crash stilled the great boom, remains a city
set in beauty, a city small enough for people to say hello on
the downtown streets, a city where it is safe to walk at night
and a morning's drive takes you to mountain or ocean, a city of
easy access to parks and playgrounds, and to the more metropolitan
delights of Seattle: in short, a pleasant place to live.
<P>
An anonymous visitor to the Pacific Northwest, quoted in the January
12, 1894, issue of Harper's Weekly, had it right: &quot;Well,
gentlemen, if I were a man of wealth seeking a home and investments
on Puget Sound, I would live in Tacoma and invest in Seattle.&quot;

<H2>Nelson Bennett and the Stampede Pass Tunnel</H2>

<P>
On January 22, 1886, Captain Sidney Bennett, temporarily resident
in Yakima, received a telegram from his younger brother Nelson,
then visiting in Philadelphia. The wire said the Bennett brothers
had won the contract to drive a tunnel 16 feet wide, 22 feet high
at the crown, 9,850 feet long through the north shoulder of Mount
Rainier. &quot;Get going,&quot; said the kid brother, who was
boss.
<P>
Sidney Bennett needed no urging. Haste was imperative. He and
Nelson were not only undertaking an assignment of formidable difficulty,
but they were betting more than they possessed that they could
finish the job in twenty - eight months. Their contract pledged
a one - hundred - thousand - dollar performance bond plus 10 percent
of the contract price if they failed to have trains rolling under
the Cascades by May 22, 1888.
<P>
Back in Philadelphia where the bids had been opened, the defeated
contractors, who numbered a dozen, were predicting that the Bennett
brothers' victory would not make them but break them. Their bid
had been so low - less than half that by some of their more experienced
rivals - that even if they beat the deadline they could still
lose a fortune. But if anyone could get the job done on time,
it was agreed, the Bennetts were the ones.
<P>
Nelson Bennett was forty - three years old, five feet nine inches
in height and almost as wide: put a mustache and goatee on a bulldozer
and you would have a reasonable facsimile. Born in Canada, left
fatherless at six, Nelson quit school at fourteen to work on a
farm. He came to the United States during the Civil War, helped
build Army barracks for a time, then caught on as a brakeman on
the Dixon Air Line.
<P>
Nelson was in Detroit in 1864 when he received a letter from one
of his brothers In Pennsylvania: &quot;I have found the Eldorado
- Come at once. I am boring for oil and we can slip into a fortune
as easy as eating mince pie.&quot; Nelson could not draw his railroad
pay until the end of the month, so he got himself fired on his
next run. He arrived in the oil fields with two dollars, worked
four weeks as a day laborer, then passed himself off as a contractor
and agreed to bore a six - hundred - foot well (&quot; I hired
a competent man to manage then stood round looking wise until
I learned something&quot;).
<P>
He sank twenty - seven wells before the boom tapered off. He took
a small fortune west but lost it in land speculation in Missouri
and Iowa. Next he taught school in Missouri (he had gone through
the sixth grade), fought Indians (twenty personal acquaintances
were killed in the race wars of the West), prospected in the Dakotas,
organized a mule - train freight service in the Southwest. He
was in Salt Lake City, broke again, when the copper rush to Montana
began.
<P>
Bennett contracted to move a quartz mill from Ophir, Utah, to
Butte, six hundred miles, on mule back, and did it. He put the
profits into building Butte's first street railway and the profits
from that into moving a steam sawmill into the Lost River region
of Idaho. He was rich again.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
His Rocky Mountain activities brought Bennett into contact with
Washington Dunn, who was building the Utah and Northern for Jay
Gould. Bennett teamed up with Dunn, doing the outside work while
Dunn hustled contracts. They undertook to dig a thirty - five
- mile irrigation ditch in Idaho to carry Snake River water to
270,000 acres.
<P>
The job required six hundred men, twelve hundred horses, and an
arsenal of drilling and blasting equipment. On this project Sidney
Bennett, Nelson's leaner and meaner older brother, a cavalry captain
in the Civil War, demonstrated what an admirer called &quot;a
peculiar genius for slave-driving.&quot; Dunn died, and Nelson
Bennett went into the negotiating end of the business, leaving
Sidney to direct field work. The Bennetts won the contract for
the first 134 miles of the Cascade Division, Pasco to Ellensburg,
before securing the Stampede assignment.
<P>
A human bulldozer and a slave - driving genius were needed on
the Stampede. just getting men and machines to the work site required
prodigious effort. Nelson shipped west five engines, two water
wheels, five air compressors, eight seventy - horsepower boilers,
four large exhaust fans, two complete electric arc-light plants,
two miles of six - inch wrought - iron pipe, two miles of water
pipe, two fully equipped machine shops, assorted tools, thirty
- six air - drilling machines, several tons of steel drills, two
locomotives (named &quot;Sadie&quot; and &quot;Ceta&quot; after
his daughters), sixty dump - cars, two sawmills, and a telephone
system.
<P>
On the east side of the Cascades, the rails toward the mountains
ended just beyond the village of Yakima; on the west they had
been run from Tacoma through Buckley to Eagle Gorge. Beyond the
railheads only vague pack - trails twisted through the forests,
up to the mountainsides, to the portals.
<P>
An even sketchier path went up through the pass to connect the
east and west work sites. It was so indistinct that the veteran
John McAllister and a companion lost their way and their horses
in a snowstorm, and survived for a week on nothing but boiled
oats. When a search party reached them McAllister was shoveling
a path down the mountain through ten feet of snow.
<P>
&quot;Have you any grub?&quot; McAllister asked his rescuers.
<P>
&quot;Yes.&quot;
<P>
The old settler sat down and wept.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
Through such country, in the dead of winter, Sidney Bennett had
to move an industry, a work force, and living facilities, against
a deadline. The first wagons started from Yakima only eleven days
after the contract was signed. In the dry, rocky hills around
Yakima the crews chipped away at the road with picks, but as they
approached the mountains they came to a stretch of fifteen miles
where a warm Chinook wind had melted the snow.
<P>
The wagons sank above the axles. So they built a moving roadway
of planks. Boards were laid end to end across the bog, the rear
boards being hand - carried forward as soon as the back wheels
of the wagon cleared them. It proved impossible to keep the wheels
on the planks with the horses hitched in the normal way. They
rigged block and tackle, fastened one end of the rope to the wagon
tongue, the team to the other end, and drivers slogged ahead of
the wagon shouldering the tongue to guide it. When all went well
they could make a mile a day.
<P>
Things were worse in the mountains. The trail led along gorges
five hundred to a thousand feet deep; it crossed creeks and rivers;
it threaded through a tangle of forest. Where the grades were
steepest and not even double - teaming could move the wagons,
the block and tackle was rigged from trees to allow the horses
to pull downhill. In some stretches the machinery was put on scows
that could be skidded across the frozen snow. The weather was
awful, alternating rain and snow. the winds could knock down a
horse.
<P>
An advance party under Master Builder W. H. Buckner reached the
east face on February 9. &quot;Before we could get to the portal,&quot;
he reported, &quot;we had to shovel a road through snow 800 feet
long and eight feet deep. At the face of the tunnel there was
200 inches of water falling from the top of the bluff 170 feet,
which had to be turned.
<P>
There was ice eight to ten feet deep across the cliff. We made
a cut through snow and ice twenty feet wide, eight to ten deep
and 150 feet long just to get at the portal at the east end. In
order to reach the west portal <B>it </B>was necessary to shovel
a trail through snow four to ten feet deep, four feet wide, and
four miles long.&quot;
<P>
Hand - drilling on the approach to the east face began February
13. Entries in Sidney Bennett's work journal are laconic:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Feb. 15. Work on excavation on approach to tunnel will be prosecuted
until point of heading is reached.</I>

<HR>

<P>
On the trail, organization replaced improvisation. A hundred wagons
were moving men and machinery up the roads. Stations had been
built every twelve miles. These were &quot;rag shows&quot; - tent
camps - where teamsters could get food and sleep. It had been
found that sleds that worked on the slanted snow fields could
be hauled across mud as the freezing line rose with the temperature.
At the portals the men lived in real houses, though on the east
side workers had to shovel away fifty feet of snow to reach solid
ground for the foundation of what was called Tunnel City.
<P>
The first compressor boiler left Yakima on February 22. It was
eight weeks reaching the portal but on June 19 the equipment was
assembled. Sidney's notes say triumphantly, &quot;Two Ingersoll
drills started in the east end - the first machinery that started.&quot;
<P>
If the Bennetts were to beat the deadline, it would be with the
help of technology. They planned to attack the rock with six Ingersoll
Eclipse drills at each end of the tunnel, the power to be generated
on the east side where six large boilers were installed to supply
four 480 - horsepower compressors. A pipe 12,500 feet long was
run over the pass to carry air to the drills at the west face.
<P>
Captain Sidney hoped to drill 400 feet of rock a month when under
full steam.
<P>
More than 122,000 cubic yards of rock were to be chipped out of
the mountain. just finding a place to put the debris was a problem.
On the west end the rock was run down a spur for a quarter of
a mile, then dumped into a ravine that was eventually filled and
used as roadbed for the track. A visitor who rode one of the dump
trucks reported that it went downhill &quot;with a speed that
made a person's hair rise like the quills of a fretful porcupine.&quot;
<P>
Reporters trooped &quot;to the front.&quot; Those from Tacoma
tended to be enthusiastic, those from Seattle and Portland dubious.
A favorite rumor was that there had been an engineering miscalculation
and when the east side and west side meet in the middle they'll
be a mile apart.&quot; Tilton Sheets, a civil engineer and surveyor,
visited the digs in July to assure readers of the Tacoma <I>Ledger
</I>that all was well. His tone was that of a recruiting sergeant:
<P>
Any man who will work can find employment and command from two
dollars all the way to three per day according to how he can work.
If he is worth three he can get it.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
How do the men live - their board and all that? Very well - as
cheaply and well as they could live in Tacoma. The contractors
have built camps and the men are well fed - plenty of beef and
good food otherwise, for all of which they pay $4.50 a week. Of
course it's roughing it a little - that's understood. Every man
provides his own blankets. Good meals can be obtained at points
along the road towards Ellensburg at two - bits, but up towards
the summit they come higher, naturally enough - say four - bits.
For parties visiting the scene on a flying excursion it is advisable
to take provisions along.
<P>
Saloons? Oh, yes - too many of them. That's one trouble. Many
of the men get caught by them every pay day and don't work till
they have to.
<P>
Another Ledger reporter met a professional gambler coming down
from the west portal. He was in complete agreement with Surveyor
Tilton about the opportunities for diversion on the mountainside:
<P>
His smile was contagious even across a hundred feet of space.
He carried only a little hand satchel such as ladies affect. Shaking
this and smiling over the clash of ivory and what - not within,
he asked: &quot;Poker? Roulette? Chuckluck? Try your hand. Anything
you wish.&quot; Pleased at the reception of this sally, he continued.
&quot;What's your racket? I can tell you, it's no good up there.
I've been all through it, from Ellensburg to the Gorge, all through.
It's worked out.
<P>
&quot;There's saloons and restaurants every fifty feet. You can
get a good meal for two - bits - as good as you can at Tacoma.
There's nothing left in it for us. What's your game? Whiskey?&quot;
<P>
Such prosperity and luxury proved more than some men could stand.
The week that Tilton Sheets' effusion appeared in the Ledger,
Captain Sidney penned an unusually long entry in his daily journal:
<P>
About 150 men in east end struck for nine hours as a day's work.
[They were working twelve - hour shifts, seven days a week.] It
lasted two days but did not prevail. In this matter the sheriff
of [Yakima] county was called upon the ground to prevent disorder
and injury to persons or property. One man was shot by him in
his attempt to escape arrest on a criminal charge.
<P>
In a letter to Nelson, who was at company headquarters in Tacoma,
Sidney remarked that they were using three crews at all times,
&quot;one coming, one drilling, one quitting.&quot; But the work
went on.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>August 9. Electric lights were extended in the west end, having
previously been placed in the east end. The rock in the east end
is getting so hard it has to be blasted with No. I Giant Powder.</I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>August 18. One man killed and another injured by blasting.</I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Sept. 1. Three Ingersoll drills started for the first time
in the west end.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
At this point Sidney added up progress and estimated what remained
to be done to meet the deadline. They would have to average 13.58
feet a day through May 21, 1888. The crews had yet to make as
much as 13 feet on any day.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Sept. 5. Work was advanced so far that the smoke and gas incident
from blasting had to be remedied, and the steam fans were applied,
which helped clean the tunnel thereof.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Sept. 25. Drilling delayed because of the breaking of rock
above the face of the tunnel caused by blasting shots. Five days
to remedy.</I>

<HR>

<P>
The delays in construction and the increasing stridency of the
campaign in Congress for forfeiture of the unearned land grants
caused NP President Harris early in 1887 to decide to lay a temporary
switchback track through the pass. That way train service could
begin before the tunnel was complete.
<P>
A thousand more men were hired in March to shovel snow off the
mountain above the tunnel so that rails could be zig - zagged
over the summit. With the realization that they would have a direct
connection with the east a year ahead of schedule, Tacomans were
caught on a rising tide of enthusiasm. Tourist excursions were
organized to visit the end of the line and applaud the workers
as they marched off to the front, shovels on their shoulders.
<P>
&quot;Beyond the end of the track,&quot; wrote the Ledger's front
line correspondent, a clearing very like a new country road extends
along the edge of the river and fringes the hill and is soon lost
at the turn. A few men may be seen lifting and letting fall their
shovels here and there where the road leads over into full view.
Columns of blue smoke rise above the trees at irregular intervals.
<P>
A few workmen are building a footbridge across the river back
of the station. The large tents are in the midst of a partial
clearing and about 30 horses and mules stamp and whinny under
the trees while pack men are binding to their backs bales of hay,
barrels and bundles of every description, while for every switch
of the tail or misstep of the burdened animal his heart is sent
to perdition forty times in the loud prayers of the drivers.
<P>
They are leaving now, as late as 11 A.M., starting away by the
trail, which, a mere pathway, begins at once a precipitate ascent
of the mountain. They go in single file, the drivers or pack men
more noisy than before, keeping the horses in line. A few laborers
have just come in and are directed on toward the picks and the
new dirt and the smoke in the shadowy gap further along.
<P>
A sound, as of distant cannonading, seems to shake the earth as
it rolls down from out of the mysterious shadows of the gulch
and beyond. Every few moments a thunder and crash through the
woods tells of the blasting rocks and the fall of giant trees.
<P>
And this is the front.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
By March 28, 1877, the shovel brigade had cleared enough roadbed
for the start of track - laying above the tunnel. The rails sashayed
up the slope in a series of three switches on each side of the
mountain. At each switchback the train would run up to a dead
end and back onto the track climbing to the next switch. 'this
Z - route reduced the grade to 297 feet per mile.
<P>
The last spike on the switchback was driven at two minutes past
six on the afternoon of June 1. Assistant General Manager J. M.
Buckley (for whom the Northern Pacific named the town of Buckley)
served as master of ceremonies. Mrs. H. S. Huson, wife of the
assistant project engineer, made the final tap on the spike with
a bottle of champagne. An experimental first train - two locomotives,
a baggage car, caboose, and a wooden - seated coach - was sent
from Yakima to Tacoma on June 6.
<P>
The route having been tested, Charles Wright was carried over
it in triumph the next day in his private parlor car.
<P>
Scheduled traffic over the Stampede began July 3. The first regular
overland train to the east - four coaches, with twenty passengers
- left Tacoma at 1:45 P.m. The first westbound passenger train
arrived at 7:15 - seven hours late.
<P>
On the Fourth of July Tacoma for the second time celebrated the
completion of the transcontinental. President Cleveland was invited
to speak but the celebrants had to settle for lank, scruffy Eugene
<P>
Semple, the governor. A grandstand was built at the present site
of Stadium High School. The papers claimed that eighteen thousand
visitors came to town, which would have been more than the combined
populations of Seattle and Olympia.
<P>
Festivities lasted three days, marred only by a dispute in the
hose - laying contest between the Seattle and Tacoma fire departments.
Somebody recognized one of the Seattle volunteers as a professional
sprinter who specialized in running at carnivals with the handicap
of a fifty - pound flour sack on his shoulders.
<P>
The switchback served more as a symbol of the Northern Pacific's
intention to complete the route than as a serviceable means of
transportation. The track had been laid so hastily on frozen ground
that much of it had to be replaced after the first thaw. The grade
was too steep to permit heavy freight. Crews drew hazard pay for
running the huge decapod lokeys that were hooked fore and aft
to trains of five passenger coaches or five light - loaded freight
cars for the eight miles between Martin on the east side and Stampede
on the west. There was a brakeman for every two cars.
<P>
Notwithstanding the precautions there were accidents. Engineer
Harvey Reed was taking a decapod over the pass with a load of
heavy bridge timbers. The engine broke down. Reed tried to jockey
the load over the top with a little Baldwin, Engine 457. He pushed
<P>
the freight car up the first leg of the switchback but, as he
backed up the second leg, snow jammed into the sand pipes. When
he called for sand, none spilled onto the track.
<P>
The wheels of the Baldwin began to spin on slick steel. Engine
and car slowed, halted, and, after a desperate wheel - spinning
pause, slipped backwards, slowly at first, then faster and faster.
Reed and his firemen jumped, landing safely in snowdrifts. Engine
and car sped down the slope, rocking around curves until they
came to a curving trestle where two men were working.
<P>
The engine struck one man killing him instantly. His companion
dropped face down on the ties. just as it reached him the engine
lumped the track, hurtled over the side without touching him,
and plunged into the ravine.
<P>
Engine 457 was restored to service, as was Engineer Reed. He was
at the throttle of the little Baldwin three months later when
<B>it </B>was overtaken and rammed from behind in a tunnel. The
coal tender was knocked loose but there was enough water left
in the boiler for Reed to get back to Marlin. For years old -
timers yarned about the arrival of the bob - tail lokey.
<P>
While the trains ran the slalom course over the summit, Captain
Sidney's work gangs moled below, none too expeditiously. There
were slides, strikes, cave - ins, deaths from blasting, and some
mayhem at management level. Sidney persuaded Nelson to persuade
President
<P>
Harris to remove the project engineer, with whom Sidney did not
see eye to eye.
<P>
And somebody, somewhere along the line of authority, decided to
furnish slave - driver Sidney with a carrot as well as a club.
A bonus was offered. Each month, for every foot gained over the
necessary average of 13.58 feet a day, laborers doing continuous
duty were paid twenty - five cents extra, drill men and expert
workmen, fifty cents. The pace increased phenomenally.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
On September 1, 1887, a year after the Ingersolls were put at
both faces, work was 410 feet behind schedule. In the next eight
and a half months they made up 4541/2 feet - 1321/2 in April alone.
It cost the Bennetts thirty - three dollars extra for every man
who had worked steadily that thirty days - and it saved the performance
bond.
<P>
Moving into May, when each blast might mean open space ahead,
the Bennetts offered a thousand dollars to the first man through
the bore with the fringe benefit of a steak dinner and whiskey
for the side he represented. Each team picked a tough little powder
- monkey who could wiggle and struggle. Foremen had problems keeping
the chosen men out of the area of flying rock when shots were
touched off.
<P>
Shortly after noon on May 3, 1888, the men who rushed into the
smoke and rock dust after a blast felt a draft. The west side
representative wriggled into the hole and collided, head - on,
with the eastern representative.
<P>
As the delegates butted each other, their constituents pushed
in behind, heaving and struggling, until at last the man from
the west was shoved through - skinned, bleeding, triumphant. For
the west this offset the statistic that through the long campaign
the east had moved more rock.
<P>
Captain Sidney's wife had long insisted she would be the first
person to walk under the Cascade ran e. She at least was the first
of her sex. On her first crawl, Mrs. Bennett, a lady of heroic
proportions, became stuck. The eastern team managed to pull her
back by her ankles.
<P>
Chagrined but determined she went down the tunnel, shed some undergarments,
and, according to legend, sent out for a bucket of lard to coat
her shoulders and hips. This time the men of the west gallantly
pulled her through. She arose, her dark hair powdered with blasted
basalt, and uttered the immortal words, &quot;The drinks, gentlemen,
are on my husband.&quot;
<P>
In Tacoma, along Cliff Avenue, the cannons thundered again. For
the third time the Northern Pacific had been completed, this time
for real.<HR>

<H2>Erastus Brainerd at the Gold Rush</H2>

<P>
Erastus Brainerd was a handsome Connecticut Yankee, solid and
sandy-haired and conservative, a delegate to the Republican National
Convention in 19O4, a pillar of the Chamber of Commerce, a lover
of the arts who once wrote a book on painting and served in his
youth as curator of the Gray Collection of Engravings at the Boston
Art Museum.
<P>
Though his name is hardly known in Seattle today, this author
and editor, whose friends considered him to be touched with genius,
probably did more than any other individual to annex the Territory
of Alaska to the City of Seattle. Certainly he was the man most
responsible for making Seattle the main port of the Klondike and
Nome gold rushes.
<P>
Brainerd started his newspaper career as an editorial writer on
the New York World and later served as an associate editor on
two other good papers, the Atlanta Constitution and the Philadelphia
Press.
<P>
In 1890 one of Brainerd's friends in Philadelphia, W. A. Bailey,
bought the Seattle Press and persuaded Brainerd to go west to
run it. The next year Bailey bought out the moribund Times and
combined the two papers under Brainerd's editorship. The New Englander
ran a literate paper, but his editorial tastes were a bit rarefied
for the frontier.
<P>
Times were bad again; so bad, in fact, that the new Baptist minister
was advocating &quot;the practical redistribution of wealth.&quot;
The whole state echoed to the sound of crashing banks; in Tacoma
alone, fourteen out of twenty-one shut their doors. The unemployed
began joining Coxey's Army.
<P>
Two thousand men converged on Puyallup, seized an unfinished hotel,
commandeered food wherever they could find it, and demanded that
the Northern Pacific give them train transportation east, to march
with Coxey on the nation's capital. They disbanded when Governor
McGraw threatened them with Army action. In the midst of all this,
the people of Seattle found Brainerd's enthusiastic coverage of
art, literature, and South American customs less than exciting.
<P>
The Press-Times lost money steadily, and finally Brainerd resigned
his editorship and accepted the post of state land commissioner,
offered to him by Governor McGraw.
<P>
Land Commissioner was an important job. Jim Hill had just pushed
the Great Northern through to Seattle and was trying to get control
of the Northern Pacific, which had run out of money again. The
railroad lines had tremendous holdings in timberlands, and as
the first lumber moved east over the Great Northern, far-sighted
lumbermen began to investigate the Northwest. Brainerd found his
work interesting.
<P>
In 1896, however, the Populists unseated Governor McGraw and within
a few months Brainerd was succeeded by a land commissioner of
the ruling party.
<P>
Times were still bad, and Brainerd had a hard time finding a job
suited to his talents. He picked up pin-money by serving as the
Paraguayan consul in Seattle, but there seemed to be little future
for a Yankee in that country's diplomatic corps. Brainerd was
still looking for work when on July 15, 1897, the newsboys chanted,
&quot;Gold discovered.&quot;
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
The ship Excelsior had just landed in San Francisco with half
a ton of gold aboard. A second ship was due in Seattle with an
even larger payload. The papers printed extras as each new bulletin
came in.
<P>
Everyone read the papers that day, read them time after time.
The whole nation was excited, but Seattle was in a frenzy. People
who had crossed the continent and waited months and years in the
mud and the rain, hoping for their luck to turn, now, felt that
they had been led by destiny to the end of the rainbow. It was
not just that Seattle was the nearest American rail-port to Alaska,
though no one forgot that factor for a moment; the really exciting
elements in the stories were the names.
<P>
Among those who had struck it rich were men everybody in town
knew. Jack Horne, an inept heavyweight prize-fighter from Tacoma,
was considered one of the unluckiest of the prospectors: he had
come out with only six thousand dollars. T. S. Lippy, who had
been a secretary of the Seattle YMCA, had gathered nuggets worth
eighty-five thousand dollars. And, of course, the rumors ran ahead
of the golden facts.
<P>
The next day a cutter with an Associated Press correspondent aboard
spied the steamer Portland off Cape Flattery, and fact again sprinted
ahead of rumor. This was the Portland's greatest voyage-in her
hold was more than a ton of gold. At Seattle a huge crowd was
awaiting her at the dock. The stories the prospectors had to tell
were fantastic.
<P>
A servant girl had found fifty thousand dollars in a week; a man
had made twenty-four thousand in a day; a schoolteacher, in Alaska
on her vacation, had taken out eighty thousand in a month. A Seattle
boy had bought a claim for eighty-five dollars and without so
much as turning a spadeful of dirt had sold it for thirty-five
thousand dollars.
<P>
A Fresno fruit-farmer had come back for one last try after repeated
failures and had made a hundred and thirty thousand over the winter.
A Negro who had been a slave made thirty thousand in three months,
then left for Georgia to give his treasure to the woman who had
owned him.
<P>
The tales told by the men on the Portland were unbelievable-until
the prospectors staggered off under the weight of the canvas bags
they carried. The gold talked convincingly, so much so that it
soon became heresy for anyone to believe that a man could fail
in Alaska.
<P>
Even before the Portland docked she was booked full for her passage
back north: fifty first-class passengers (including former Governor
McGraw) and ninety-eight second class. Seven other steamers were
accepting bookings. Half of Seattle seemed to expect to make its
fortune by going to Alaska, the other half by outfitting the prospectors.
<P>
It was the same in the other coastal towns. San Francisco expected
that it would naturally be the center of any gold rush; Portland
hoped to capitalize on its quick transportation to the East; Tacoma
had the Northern Pacific terminal; Nanaimo, British Columbia,
trumpeted the fact that the gold was in Canada and so was Nanaimo.
But Seattle had the natural advantage of being the northernmost
American rail-port, plus the good fortune that Erastus Brainerd
was in town and without a job to keep him busy.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
The Chamber of Commerce appointed a committee to see that Seattle
got more than its share of the Gold Rush trade, and the chairman
of that committee was Erastus Brainerd. The man who had failed
as a frontier editor proved to be the most resourceful publicity
man on the coast. He might not know a good local story, but he
did know most of the important journalists in the East by their
first names.
<P>
He knew magazine editors and advertising rates, and he knew what
questions an Easterner would want answered about going to Alaska.
The Chamber gave him a fat expense account to draw on, and in
return Brainerd gave Alaska to Seattle.
<P>
First, of course, he advertised. He placed more inches of ads
for Seattle than all the other ports together had bought. His
biggest splurge was for six full columns in Hearst's New York
Journal, which then claimed the highest circulation figure in
the country.
<P>
He placed ads in rural papers with an aggregate of nearly ten
million readers. He put ads in all the major magazines, Cosmopolitan
and Century, McClure's and Munsey's, Scribner's, and Review of
Reviews.
<P>
He thought up devices for getting free publicity. He wrote a series
of &quot;letters home,&quot; and whenever he heard of a newcomer
to town he gave him one of the form letters and had him send it
to the editor of his hometown paper. He wrote articles for Eastern
papers and magazines, including Harper's Weekly, and then quoted
his effusions in news dispatches datelined Seattle without mentioning
that their author was Seattle's paid booster.
<P>
Anything to link the two words: Seattle and Alaska, Alaska and
Seattle. He had a staff of stenographers write personal letters
to every state governor and to the mayor of every community of
five thousand or more. The letters gave information about the
goods anyone would need in Alaska and mentioned that anyone wanting
further information should write to Seattle. Thousands did.
<P>
He asked officials to send estimates of the number of people from
their communities who would be going to Alaska, so that Seattle
could prepare to outfit them. Alaska and Seattle, Seattle and
Alaska. He wrote an information booklet about the Klondike and
the way to get there (only one way, of course), and persuaded
the Secretary of State of Washington to print it and send it out
in the name of the state government.
<P>
The federal State Department sent copies to the governments of
fifteen countries, and in many of these the information was reprinted
in official bulletins and in the press. Alaska and Seattle, Seattle
and Alaska.
<P>
Brainerd had folders of pictures printed, pictures of Alaska and
the Klondike and Seattle, and sent them to every library in the
country. Elaborate editions of the folders were sent as Christmas
cards to every king in Europe and to the presidents of the South
American republics. When their secretaries sent letters of thanks,
Brainerd turned the letters over to the papers and more news stories
went out mentioning Seattle and Alaska in the same paragraph.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
The best story of all came from Germany: the Kaiser's staff had
been afraid to open the package containing the pictures-they thought
it was a bomb.
<P>
When the Post-Intelligencer printed its special Klondike edition
Brainerd's committee paid for nearly a hundred thousand copies
and sent them to every postmaster in the country, to every library,
and to five thousand public officials. Seattle and Alaska, Alaska
and Seattle.
<P>
Amid the Brainerd-created clamor the other claimant cities barely
made themselves heard. They kept trying, but soon almost everyone
except residents of the rival coastal cities considered Seattle
the gateway to gold. As the publicity went out, the prospectors
came in-by the hundreds, by the thousands. The streets were crowded
with men, hotels overflowed, and men rented out their barns. &quot;Flop
in the hay. Six bits.&quot;
<P>
Prices inched up under the steady demand of men who with their
life-savings in their pockets were outfitting themselves for a
trip into the unknown. The innocents would buy anything. They
were starting on a trip where they would have to climb mountains
and float down rivers, but in Seattle they could be persuaded
to buy a &quot;still,&quot; large as a fifty pound lard can, in
which to purify water.
<P>
The tenderfeet, the Alaskan epithet &quot;Cheechako,&quot; was
just coming into use-were suckers for heating equipment. Whatever
they did not know about Alaska and Northwest Canada, they were
sure it would be cold. One of the products offered in the Alaskan
outfitting stores along First Avenue was a burner that would use
coal, oil, or gas and fit into anything from an oil can to the
largest range. A Cheechako ruefully recalls:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The sample burner kept going by the solicitors seemed to work
all right. A lady who had been testing its oven qualities assured
me it would &quot;bake potatoes beautifully.&quot; As proof she
held up a good-sized tuber that had been partially cremated. I
bought the burner for $18. We set that coal-oil-gas burner up
in our tent. It roared like a small Vesuvius in full eruption.
Flames shot from every crack and opening in that stove. I worked
the pump with frantic haste-it was no use, the whole thing was
going to blow up. I stoned for the door of the tent, but a lad
who had seen the burners work before said, &quot;There's no danger.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
He coolly took out his pocket knife, cut the lead connecting pipe,
took the burner on a stick, and threw it outdoors. There were
a good many suckers in Seattle those days.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
The Seattle banks combined to set up an assay office to convert
the prospectors' gold to cash, and Brainerd began a successful
lobbying campaign to get Congress to assign Seattle a government
assay office.
<P>
Though he conducted one of the most masterful publicity campaigns
of all time on behalf of Seattle, a campaign that helped hundreds
of his friends get rich, Brainerd did not cash in on the gold
rush himself. Not that he didn't try. While propagandizing for
Seattle he also organized a nationwide campaign to get Erastus
Brainerd appointed as the United States Consul in Dawson, Yukon
Territory.
<P>
Twelve senators, nine governors, and numerous representatives,
editors, bankers, businessmen, and collectors of etchings wrote
to the State Department, urging creation of a Dawson consulship
and Brainerd's appointment; but this was a Brainerd campaign that
failed. He was left in Seattle to watch his friends and associates
grow rich off the people and trade he had helped to attract.
<P>
Every business prospered. Real-estate values boomed. Papers increased
their circulation. Anyone who owned or could lease a ship, no
matter how old, no matter how unseaworthy, could find passengers.
One captain hitched a series of rafts behind the ship, loaded
two hundred passengers and a herd of cattle aboard the rafts,
and started north. When a storm blew up in the Gulf of Alaska
he had to be restrained from cutting the rafts adrift. When the
party landed at Dutch Harbor he sold his passengers the cattle
that had come with them-at a mark-up of a thousand per cent a
head.
<P>
Ships were needed desperately, and Brainerd's friend, Robert Moran,
who had been mayor at the time of the fire, went to work to meet
the demand. Brainerd recalled later, &quot;When I went to Seattle,
Bob Moran simply had an ordinary boat-building establishment and
a little marine railway on which he could haul up schooners and
all that sort of thing.
<P>
Shortly after that he took a contract to build a harbor tug for
the Revenue Cutter Service, which he built successfully. Then
he built a torpedo boat for the government. Then he built fourteen
river steamboats for the Yukon River, the trade in that country
being started then. And, by the way, he personally navigated those
fourteen river stem-wheel steamboats of three and a half feet
draft through the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea to St. Michael-one
of the most astonishing feats that ever was done in the way of
navigation.&quot; With Moran's success the Seattle shipbuilding
industry was firmly established.
<P>
Of all the entrepreneurs who benefited by the gold rush, none
did better than the operators of the saloons and the brothels
and the dance halls along the Skid Road. With thousands of single
men pouring into the city, men with money to spend and time to
kill, the prostitutes were not far behind. Within two years after
the strike in the Klondike, Seattle had become, according to a
government report, one of the three main American centers of the
white-slave traffic.
<P>
There were more saloons in the business district than there were
restaurants or dry goods stores. The town was wide open and swarmed
with easy-money men, some going, some coming, and some satisfied
to stay in Seattle. It was along the Skid Road that the most famous
of Alaska's bad men, Soapy Smith, rounded up the gang that eventually
operated the town of Skagway as its private enterprise. Soapy
Smith-like Erastus Brainerd-was a part-time genius.
<P>
He took a weird bunch of individualists, men who went by the names
of Fatty Green and Kid Jimmy Fresh, Yank Few Clothes and Jay Bird
Slim, and organized them into a syndicate that not only ran all
the gambling and robbery at the southern end of the gold trail,
but even took over the United States Army Recruiting Station at
Skagway during the Spanish-American War and assigned men to pick
the pockets of the recruits who were taking their physicals.
<P>
Soapy did not profit personally from his endeavors. When he was
killed in a duel with the civil engineer who had laid out the
town (and who, like Soapy, felt a proprietary interest in Skagway)
Soapy's estate was a hundred dollars in cash and a satchelful
of marked cards.
<P>
As for Brainerd, he finally went to Alaska and worked there as
a &quot;mining consultant.&quot; He did not prosper. Back Outside,
as Alaskans say, he went to Washington, D. C., as representative
of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce.
<P>
In 1904 he became editor of the Post Intelligencer and, as representative
of the Better Element, engaged in a historic journalistic duel
with Colonel Blethen of the Times, the spokesman for an open-town
policy. Brainerd lost. He moved to Tacoma and died there on Christmas
Day, 1972. His death did not make the front page of either of
the papers he had edited, and his obituaries did not mention that
he had made Seattle the gateway to the gold rush.<HR>

<H2>George Browne becomes a useful member of the Tacoma community
</H2>

<P>
Tacomans, accustomed during the construction of the Northern Pacific
to long delays between the announcement of a project and its commencement,
let alone its completion watched with surprise and delight as
the new people went about their business.
<P>
The Griggs-Hewitt party arrived on the afternoon of June 4, 1888.
Before the day was done they had filed articles of incorporation
with the Pierce County auditor for the St. Paul &amp; Tacoma Lumber
Company, capitalized at $ 1,500,000.
<P>
They had held an organizational meeting and elected a board of
directors. Colonel Griggs was to be president of the company;
Foster, vice-president; Hewitt, treasurer; and George Browne,
in whose office the organizational meeting was held, secretary.
<P>
George Browne served as a link between St. Paul &amp; Tacoma and
the Northern Pacific: he was a nephew of NP Vice-president Oakes.
A native of Boston, whose forebears had arrived in Salem from
Lancashire in 1635, Browne had been educated in New York. At twenty
he went into the Union army, was commissioned lieutenant in the
Sixth Independent Horse Battery, and served with conspicuous gallantry.
<P>
He was frequently cited in dispatches, the first time after action
at Kelly's Ford on the Rappahannock during the battle of Chancellorsville.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;The guns were served with great difficulty, owing to
the way the cannoneers were interfered with in their duties,&quot;</I>
wrote General Pleasanton.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Carriages, wagons, horses without riders and panic-stricken
infantry were rushing through and through the battery, overturning
guns and limbers, smashing caissons and trampling horse-holders
under them. While Lieutenant Browne was bringing his section into
position, a caisson without drivers came tearing through, upsetting
his right piece and seriously injuring one of the horse drivers,
carrying away both detachments of his horses, and breaking the
caisson so badly as to necessitate its being left on the field.&quot;</I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Browne was again mentioned after action at Cedar Run. He rode
with Sheridan on the raid to cut Lee's communications with Richmond
during the battles of Wilderness and Spotsylvania and was in action
at Yellow Tavern near Richmond when the Confederate cavalry genius,
Jeb Stuart, was fatally wounded. For all his gallantry, he was
only a senior lieutenant when mustered out.
<P>
After his war experiences, the young Yankee saw little risk in
Wall Street. A big man with bold, open features, a cascading mustache,
and wide cultural horizons, he accumulated friends and market
tips with equal ease. In his midforties he decided he had made
enough money and took his family to France for an extended stay.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
On returning to New York in the spring of 1887 at the age of forty-eight,
Browne was invited by his uncle Thomas Fletcher Oakes, to cross
the country to Tacoma to attend a Fourth of July celebration that
would mark the completion of the temporary switchback railroad
over Stampede Pass.
<P>
The party reached Tacoma a day early, and Randolph Radebaugh of
the Ledger, invited Oakes for a drive in the country. Radabaugh,
a long-nosed man with a trim vandyke, had more in mind than fresh
air and a look at the Mountain. He hoped to interest the NP vice-president
in local real estate. They drove south past Wapato lakes where
Radabaugh had a homestead. He yarned about the time he sat on
his porch and watched a bear kill a calf that had become bogged
in the mud between the lakes and went as far as the pleasant rise
known as Fern Hill.
<P>
When Oakes admired the terrain, Radebaugh revealed that he had
an option to buy at $75 to $100 an acre some two hundred acres
from homesteads owned by two Civil War veterans. Would Oakes care
to join him in a development.
<P>
Oakes agreed on condition he could bring in his nephew, George
Browne, who came with him from the east and had a room at the
Tacoma Hotel and plenty of ready money.
<P>
&quot;I have the highest esteem for him and want him to locate
in Tacoma because I have great faith in the town.&quot; That evening,
back at the hotel, Browne accepted the proposition without even
looking at the land, and Tacoma acquired a highly useful citizen.

<H2>J. Ross Browne and Port Townsend</H2>

<P>
One difficulty with a federal payroll is that it means federal
inspectors. For Port Townsend, one trouble with being port of
entry for Puget Sound was J. Ross Browne.
<P>
After the presidential election of 1856, the faithful followers
of James A. Buchanan lined up hopefully. Among the job hunters
was a heavy-shouldered young Democrat from New York, J. Ross Browne.
He listed his qualifications for government service as including
employment as blubber-stripper on an Antarctic whaler, squirrel
hunter in the Kentucky backwoods, ferry-keeper, flatboat hand,
short-story writer, and all-important-campaigner for Buchanan.
<P>
He was offered an appointment as special agent for the United
States Treasury Department on the Pacific Coast. Browne said later,
&quot;At great pecuniary sacrifice (in a prospective sense, for
I hadn't a dime in the world), I announced myself as ready to
proceed to duty.&quot;
<P>
Browne's reports may well be unique in the history of the Treasury
Department. What experience he lacked as an accountant he attempted
to compensate for by his talent for burlesque. His reports on
the revenue service operation on Puget Sound were models of unrestrained
unenthusiasm. Of the revenue cutter based on Port Townsend he
wrote:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>She finds occasional occupation in chasing porpoises and wild
Indians. It is to be regretted that but little revenue has yet
been derived from either of these sources; but should she persist
in her efforts there is hope that at no distant day she may overhaul
a canoe containing a keg of British brandy that is to say, in
case the paddles are lost, and the Indians have no means of propelling
it out of the way. . . .</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Now and then they run on the rocks in trying to find their
way from one anchorage to another, in which event they require
extra repairs. As this is for the benefit of navigation, it should
not be included in the account. They generally avoid running on
the same rock, and endeavor to find out a new one not laid down
upon the charts-unless perhaps, by some reckless fly-in order
that their vessels may enjoy the advantage of additional experience.</I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Nor was Browne swept off his feet by the charms of Port Townsend,
which now termed itself Hub City of Puget Sound:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Port Townsend is indeed a remarkable place. The houses, of
which there must be at least twenty in the city and suburbs, are
built chiefly of pine boards, thatched with shingles, canvas and
wood slabs. The streets of Port Townsend are paved with sand,
and the public squares are curiously ornamented with dead horses
and the bones of many dead cows.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>This of course gives a very original appearance to the public

<I>The prevailing languages spoken are the Clallam, Chinook and

issued here once every six months, is printed by means of wooden
types whittled out of pine knots by the Indians, and rubbed against
the bottom of the editor's potato pot. The cast-off shirts of

Public affairs, Browne indicated, were oddly managed. He said
the jail, a log edifice, bad been built on beach sand and that
some Indian prisoners, &quot;rooting for clams, happened to come
up at the outside.&quot; He went on to discuss the manner in which
the pioneers determined those best suited for civic leadership:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>On the day of election, notice having been previously given
on the town shingles, all the candidates for corporate honors
go up on the top of the hill back of the waterfront and play at
pitch penny and quoits till a certain number are declared eligible;
after which all the eligible candidates are required to climb
a greased pole in the center of the main public square. The two
best then become eligible for the mayorally, and the twelve next
best for the common council.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>These fourteen candidates then get on the roof of the town
hall and begin to yell like Indians. Whoever can yell the loudest
is declared mayor, and the six next loudest become members of
the common council for the ensuing year.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
One purpose of Browne's visit to Port Townsend was to have an
audience with the Duke of York, a chief of the Clallams. Opinions
differ about the duke, whose Indian name was Chetzemoka. Local
residents considered him strong and intelligent, a friend of the
white man, and a pillar of strength for his people.
<P>
William Welsh, an authority on Port Townsend, says,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;His part in the development of the Northwest, and more
especially, Port Townsend, has reserved a place for him on the
historical honor roll of the region. Beautiful little Chetzemoka
Park is named for the gallant Indian who many times saved the
settlement from extermination.&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
But Theodore Winthrop, who rented a canoe from him in 1853, begins
his description of the incident with the remark, &quot;The Duke
of York was ducally drunk.&quot; And Browne, who called on him
four years later, said that not only the Duke but his two wives,
known to the whites as Queen Victoria and Jenny Lind, had had
a snootful:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>I complimented him upon his general reputation as a good man
and proceeded to make the usual speech, derived from the official
formula, about the Great Chief in Washington, whose children were
as numerous as the leaves on the trees and the grass on the plains.</I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Oh damn,&quot; said the duke, impatiently. &quot;Him
send any whisky?&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>No, on the contrary, the Great Chief had beard with profound
regret that the Indians of Puget Sound were addicted to the evil
practice of drinking whisky, and it made his heart bleed to learn
that it was killing them off rapidly, and was the principal cause
of all their misery. It was very cruel and very wicked for white
men to sell whisky to the Indians and it was his earnest wish
that the law against this illicit traffic might be enforced and
the offenders punished.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Oh, damn,&quot; said the duke, turning over on his bed
and contemptuously waving his hand in termination of the interview.
&quot;This Tyee no 'count!&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Browne's accounts of life in the Pacific Northwest came to the
attention of a congressman who, during a debate on the budget,
inserted some quotations in the Congressional Record. And Browne
sent articles to magazines and newspapers for publication. In
time some of the documents were reprinted in the Olympia Pioneer
and Democrat and reached Port Townsend.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
Pioneers may have callused hands, but their skins are thin. The
dullest barb pricks them painfully. Browne's broad axe cut deep
into Port Townsend's pride. Civic leaders, including Plummer,
Pettygrove, and Hastings, composed a long and humorless letter
of protest. Browne replied with an open letter in the San Francisco
Bulletin, in which he apologized, after a fashion:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>You do not think it can possibly have escaped my memory that
I found you engaged in your peaceful avocations as useful and
respectable members of society. Now upon my honor I can not remember
who it was particularly that I saw engaged in peaceful avocations,
but I certainly saw a good many white men lying about in sunny
places fast asleep and a good many more sitting on logs of wood
whittling small sticks, and apparently waiting for somebody to
invite them into the nearest saloon; others I saw playing billiards
and some few standing about the corners of the streets, waiting
for the houses to grow.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This apology was not accepted. There followed a vigorous public
correspondence, the result of which, Browne was to argue later,
made Port Townsend the Northwest city best known to Californians.
<P>
During this period a bearded young Scot passed through Port Townsend
en route to Olympia.
<P>
His tattered appearance attracted little attention, but when he
bought a new wardrobe and paid for it with gold dust poured from
a poke made of the scrotum of a bull elk, he no longer went unnoticed.
All at once he had a hundred friends and a thousand questioners.
He was a reticent man, but he could not keep his secret.
<P>
His name was McDonald, and he had found the gold himself up in
Canada, on the Fraser River. He and a partner named Adams had
spent the preceding year on the Fraser and Thompson Rivers, and
they had, in what was then a fresh and lovely phrase, &quot;struck
it rich.&quot; Long afterward some people paused to wonder what
had become of Adams, and the legend grew that McDonald had arrived
with gold enough for two. But at first no one had time for such
speculation. Everyone along the coast was outfitting-or helping
others to outfit for the rush to the Fraser.
<P>
Marine traffic picked up. Port Townsend had more than its share
of visitors. For this Browne publicly took credit.
<P>
The people of California were well acquainted, through the Newspapers,
with at least one town on Puget's Sound. If they knew nothing
of Whatcomb, Squill-chuck and other rival places that aspired
to popular favor, they were no strangers to the reputation of
Port Townsend. Thousands, who had no particular business there,
went to look at this wonderful town, which had given rise to so
much controversy.
<P>
The citizens were soon forced to build a fine hotel. Traders came
and set up stores; new whisky saloons were built; customers crowded
in from all parts; in short it became a gay and dashing sort of
place and very soon had quite the appearance of a city.
<P>
So it was that when official duty brought Browne back to Port
Townsend be was met not by a tar-and-feather brigade but by a
delegation from the common council, who made speeches of welcome.
Then they escorted him to a saloon, where, Browne recalled in
an article in Harpers Monthly, &quot;we buried the hatchet in
an ocean of the best Port Townsend whisky.&quot;
<P>
He was mellow enough to add a careful postscript.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;It is due the citizens to say that not one of them went
beyond reasonable bounds on this joyous occasion, by which I do
not mean to intimate that they were accustomed to the beverage
referred to.&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
This time few took offense. Browne kept up a correspondence with
several of his former antagonists, sending them presents from
out-of-the-way places. In 1867 he came back again, this time in
a private capacity. Waiting for him on the dock, a bottle of whisky
under his arm, was the Duke of York. And in the Port Townsend
Weekly Message there appeared a poem of greeting:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Welcome stranger, to our clam beach,<BR>
To our clams and tangling whisky.<BR>
The Duke and wives all wait to greet you:<BR>
Toothless, blear-eyed, dusky matrons-<BR>
Matrons soaked in strychnine whisky,<BR>
On the clam beach at Port Townsend.<BR>
All were drunk, though patient waiting,<BR>
For the hyas Boston tyee <BR>
Who remembered them in Lapland<BR>
And their dear Port Townsend whisky.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Several generations of Port Townsend residents cherished the reputation
that their waterfront first achieved during the Fraser gold rush.
Even the reformers took pride in the gaudiness of night life down
on the beach; one Christian lady boasted, &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah
wasn't in it.&quot; A pamphlet issued by the Chamber of Commerce
a few years ago wistfully quoted a retired admiral on the good
old days:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>There was a man's town! Port Townsend was wild and prosperous
then. A little too wild for a young ensign from the East. The
first night I spent in a hotel there a man came down with smallpox
in one room next to mine, and in the other a man was murdered.</I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
There were giants in those days.
<P>
You could smell the whisky in the dirt along Water Street to a
depth of ten feet, they said. There was one saloon for every seventy
inhabitants-man, woman, and child. Local bad men formed a union
known as the Forty Thieves. So many men, after visiting Victoria,
returned to Port Townsend with bottles concealed in their high
rubber boots that peninsula philologists claim the town gave to
the language the word &quot;bootlegger.&quot;<HR>

<H2>George W. Bush and the Simmons Party</H2>

<P>
There was an exquisite appropriateness in that first party of
Americans to reach the Sound in the fall of 1845. They symbolized,
as Lieutenant Peel indicated, the filling up of the Willamette
Valley by the covered wagon pioneers and the overflow of American
settlement across the Columbia.
<P>
The dam of HBC opposition had broken. And they symbolized, too,
the diverse motivations at play in the great migration that began
in 1843-patriotism, curiosity, land-lust, health, poverty, prejudice.
All played a part in bringing the Bush-Simmons party not only
across the plains and over the mountains to the Oregon Country
but across the river and through the trees to the inland sea the
British had monopolized.
<P>
An odd pair, these family men: Michael Troutman Simmons, thirty,
born in Bullock County, Kentucky, one of ten children; George
Washington Bush, at least fifty-four, maybe sixty-six, born in
Pennsylvania or New York, if not Louisiana, an only child, a man
of color, his mother Irish, his father possibly East Indian, probably
black.
<P>
Simmons, big-framed, bearded, blue-eyed; Bush, big-framed, bearded,
brown-eyed. Simmons, by his sworn testimony all but illiterate;
Bush, by others' testimony, well-educated. Simmons, a self taught
millwright; Bush, a mountain man turned rancher.
<P>
They met in western Missouri where Bush raised cattle and wheat,
and Simmons ran a gristmill he had put together from an illustrated
book on mechanics by the cut-and-see-if-it-fits method. It is<B>
</B>not known how much the Bush and Simmons families influenced
each other in the decision to join the covered wagon train to
Oregon in 1844, the year after the first mass crossing of the
plains by Americans, but they formed the nucleus of a group of
Clay County residents, which included Simmons' mother and father-in-law
and his wife's brother and sister-in-law and their neighbors,
the James McAllisters.
<P>
Big Mike westered for all the standard reasons: he was, to begin
with, a mover-on. His mother left Kentucky with her brood of ten
when he was still a boy. They settled in Pike County, Illinois.
From there Michael went to Iowa, where at the age of twenty-one
he had married fifteen-year-old Elizabeth Kindred, small enough
to stand under his outstretched arm.
<P>
After five years they moved to Missouri and now, another four
years later, it was time to think of moving on. Times were tough
in the Midwest, drought-stricken tough; Missouri was full of talk
about the Willamette, a land of deep soil and blessedly frequent
rains, where crops never dried up, a land that might be lost to
the British who wanted it, the politicians said, not to cultivate
but as a preserve for beavers and the wild Indians who hunted
beaver-and to encircle the United States and block Uncle Sam's
way to the Pacific.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
It was patriotic to go west, and patriotism might turn a man a
profit. Congress was considering a bill to guarantee each settler
in the Oregon Country 640 acres-a square mile-with another 120
acres for every child. To Simmons, father of three, that meant
1,000 acres. Why not Oregon?
<P>
To Bush, at fifty-four going on sixty-six, wealth and land were
not the problem. Color was the problem. Historians and genealogists
may debate Bush's ancestry but to the man himself what mattered
was that he, and his children, could fall within the reach of
laws restricting nonwhites from possession of land, from citizenship,
even from the right to testify in court against white men.
<P>
The chance to be himself had drawn Bush to the frontier, that
cutting edge of American independence, but others who also sought
freedom brought with them the virus of discrimination. One recourse
open to white men who found it difficult to compete with slave
labor was to move on. Opposing slavery, they saw in the exclusion
of blacks the surest way to prevent slavery. Institutionalized
exclusion moved with the American frontier, ahead even of apple
pie<B>.</B> 
<P>
&quot;The prejudice of race appears to be stronger in the states
which have abolished slavery than in those where it still exists,&quot;
reported Alexis de Tocqueville, &quot;and nowhere is it so important
as in those states where servitude has never been known.&quot;
Ohio in 1807 excluded blacks from residence unless they posted
bond of five hundred dollars for good behavior.
<P>
Illinois in 1813 ordered every free Negro to leave the territory
under penalty of thirty-nine lashes every fifteen days until he
did so. Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin denied blacks the franchise.
Indiana and Illinois in 1840 wrote Negro exclusion laws into their
constitutions. Congressman David Wilmot, author of the Wilmot
Proviso which excluded slavery from free territories, explained
his object as &quot;to preserve for free labor of my own race
and color those new lands.&quot;
<P>
Horace Greeley in urging young men to go west, meant young white
men. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;The unoccupied west,&quot; said Greeley's Tribune, &quot;shall
be reserved for the white Caucasian race.&quot; </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Though the Missouri census of 1830 listed Bush as a &quot;free
white person,&quot; there was clearly a question about his ancestry.
Perhaps it would be different in Oregon.
<P>
Bush bought six broad-wheeled Conestoga wagons, apparently furnishing
four to the Kindreds and the McAllisters. In the family wagon
he nailed at least $2000 in coin and bullion in a false bottom.
The little party ferried the Missouri at the crossing where Joe
Robidoux, a retired fur trader for whom Bush had worked in the
west, had a log-cabin warehouse. There was enough traffic going
by to cause Robidoux to lay out a town, which, as a government
official put it, &quot;with proper self-regard he named after
himself, St. Joseph.&quot;
<P>
On the prairie west of Robidoux Crossing the pioneers gathered
to organize the wagon train. Simmons was elected &quot;Colonel,&quot;
secondin-command, an honor somewhat diminished by the election
of the blustering Cornelius Gillium as &quot;General,&quot; but
one which gave him a title he carried to his grave.
<P>
So they set off along the Oregon Trail, a trail not yet rutted
deep. They were beleaguered not by Indians but by unseasonable
rain, then drought, then the shortages and disasters and dissension
inevitable to such a caravan. A man died of cholera; his wife
gave birth to a daughter then fell under the wagon wheel, which
shattered her leg.
<P>
There could be no waiting. The train moved on and the injured
woman gasped out her life in the jolting wagon. The Bushes helped
look after the orphans. Farther west, an Indian rode off with
Bart and Rachel Kindred's baby boy, then brought him back with
a new buckskin shirt, beaded moccasins, and his wife's compliments.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
The journals give glimpses of other moments beyond the routines
of the trail: Simmons in flaming argument with Gillium; the Simmonses
abandoning Elizabeth's heirloom oak chest at a crossing of the
Platte, Bart Kindred and Bush hunting antelope for the party,
Bush warning men sent on ahead that they'd be crossing hungry
land and should shoot and eat anything big enough to hold a bullet.
<P>
One day Bush and a young Englishman, John Minto, who kept a journal,
were ahead of the party, &quot;he riding a mule and I on foot.
He led the conversation to this subject [of prejudice]. He told
me he should watch, when we got to Oregon, what usage was awarded
to people of color and if he could not have a free man's rights
he would seek the protection of the Mexican Government in California
or New Mexico. He said that there were few in that train he would
say as much to as he had just said to me.&quot;
<P>
Minto later was detailed to ride ahead to Fort Vancouver, get
supplies, and meet the party at The Dalles with a barge. When
the Bush-Simmons wagons got there December 7, Minto informed Bush
that the Provisional Government of Oregon, an ad hoc settlers'
organization which had no legal power but did reflect the mood
of the populace, had just voted to exclude blacks.
<P>
The method was to be periodic whippings for any black, slave or
free, man or woman, who sought to stay in Oregon. This barbarous
penalty was never exacted, but its presence on the books greeted
the man of color and his party on arrival.
<P>
There is no hint in any known journal of the influence the black
exclusion law had on the decision of the Bush-Simmons group to
settle not on the &quot;American&quot; side of the river but on
the north, where the Hudson's Bay Company dominated, and soon
afterwards to migrate to Puget Sound. The journals and later volumes
of reminiscence speak only of love of country, of the desire to
penetrate an area from which the HBC sought to exclude Americans.
<P>
Most of the Clay County contingent wintered at Washougal on the
north side of the Columbia, upstream from Fort Vancouver. Bush,
the experienced cattle man, stayed on the south side at The Dalles,
looking after their herd as well as some cattle of other members
of the train. Simmons rented a three-walled sheep pen at Washougal,
paying a Hawaiian a yellow, homespun shirt (well worn), and moved
his family in.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
In the spring, Elizabeth Simmons gave birth to a son conceived
on the trail. His name reflects their venture and the river of
their destination, Christopher Columbus Simmons. The Indians called
him Kickapus, the White Seagull.
<P>
Already Big Mike was ready to move on. in the spring he and five
other men set out by canoe to look at the land around Cowlitz
Prairie and the Sound. The Cowlitz was high with rain and snow-melt.
They struggled up as far as the forks, pulling themselves along
by the branches that showered them with water at the touch, avoiding
trees that swept down on the flood, but Simmons recalled a bad
dream he had had in Missouri of disaster on a river, and they
went back to Washougal.
<P>
In July Simmons tried again, this time with a party of eight and
a French Canadian guide. They spent several weeks on the Sound,
getting as far as Whidbey Island and Hood Canal, but selected
for settlement the area at the extreme southern reach, where the
Deschutes River falls into Budd Inlet. Simmons saw in the plunge
of the river from the prairie to sea level at Tumwater the power
needed for grinding grain and cutting lumber.
<P>
Bush was at Washougal when Simmons and the scouting party returned
in September. The younger Kindreds, Bart and Rachel, chose to
settle near Astoria, where Bart became a bar pilot, but the rest
of the Bush-Simmons group, thirty-one in all, stuck together.
<P>
In the last week of September, with the fall cloud cover low over
the hills and the rain incessant, they set out for the Sound,
a party of men driving the cattle overland, the others, including
all the women and children, moving by flatboat down the Columbia
to the Cowlitz, then trans-shipping to canoes for the upstream
struggle. They paddled to Cowlitz Landing, just upstream from
today's Toledo and set out along the Indian trail. Although it
had been improved by traffic between Fort Nisqually and Cowlitz
Farms,they needed fifteen days to move fifty-eight miles. Elizabeth
Simmons, suckling her six-month-old son, remembered the crossing
as the worst time of her life.
<P>
A year and a half after leaving the Missouri the party was on
Puget Sound. Simmons claimed the area at the falls, where the
Olympia Brewery now stands. Bush chose higher, open land to the
south, more suited to farming and ranching. The Kindreds were
in-between. The McAllisters eventually decided on a claim close
to the Nisqually.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
That fall they worked together to build a house, forty feet by
twenty, walled by split logs set upright, roofed with cedar boards,
the floor of dirt, with a huge clay fireplace in which they cooked.
The whole party shared it while the individual cabins were being
built. They slept four or five to a bed, the beds made on slats
laid across stout pegs set in the log walls, one family shielded
from the next by a screen of blankets.
<P>
The weather was awful. Big Mike had told them he was leading them
to Eden, but Eden froze over. The HBC people at Nisqually said
it was the worst winter they had experienced, heavy rains followed
by heavy snow and prolonged cold. There was not time to both hunt
and build. For the first few days the party lived on the dried
peas and oats they had carried across the prairie, but Dr. McLaughlin
had given &quot;Col. Symonds&quot; a letter of introduction to
Dr. Tolmie, who had returned to Fort Nisqually in 1843 as chief
factor.
<P>
It authorized the Americans to buy on credit such food as they
required for personal use. The Nisqually House blotter records
the first sale on November 11, 1845: &quot;2 bu. salt&quot; and
&quot;11/4<B> </B>gal molasses.&quot; Before winter was over,
the Americans ran up a bill at the company store for two hundred
bushels of wheat, one hundred bushels of peas and ten head of
cattle.
<P>
The Indians helped, too. They showed these inland people where
to gather oysters and mussels, where to dig clams, how to catch
crabs. They sold them venison and bear meat; ducks, geese, and
swans netted in the swamps; camas root, skunk cabbage root, salal
cakes, dried geoducks, and dried salmon. The Bush and Simmons
children never lost the taste they developed that winter for the
food of the land.
<P>
On June 15, 1846, Robert Peel in his study at Number 10 Downing
Street read over a treaty already agreed to by the Americans.
It divided the Oregon Country between the United States and Britain
along the 49th parallel from the crest of the Rockies to the middle
of the Strait of Georgia, then by the main channels separating
the continental shore from Vancouver Island. That same day George
Washington Bush was planting spring wheat on the prairie and Michael
Troutman Simmons was working on the foundation, for a gristmill
below the Tumwater falls on the Deschutes.
<P>
There is not the slightest evidence in the official records that
the presence on Puget Sound of the Bush-Simmons party had any
direct influence on the British decision to give up the north
bank of the Columbia. The American settlers had no power other
than the power of suggestion. But they did symbolize the facts
that Americans on wheels were flowing westward through the funnel
of South Pass, that they came as families, that the longer Britain
waited to divide the Oregon Country, the stronger would be the
American presence in the disputed land. A congressman had told
his colleagues that war with England was unnecessary: &quot;We
will win the battle for Oregon in our bed chambers. We will out
breed them.&quot;
<P>
Prime Minister Peel was not inclined to dispute the imperatives
of geography and sex. A boundary at 49 degrees north latitude
was as favorable a settlement as Britain was likely to get. Sir
Robert signed the treaty that afternoon, listed it as one of his
major accomplishments in a speech to Parliament that evening,
and resigned from office, satisfied that he had established a
basis for lasting peace between Britain and the United States.
<P>
On Christmas Day 1847 the first child was born to the Bush-Simmons
group after their arrival. Lewis Nesqually Bush was born on American
soil.

<H2>Bob Cameron, aerial photographer</H2>

<P>
When my old friend Emmett Watson called to ask if I would spend
an hour or so showing a visitor from San Francisco around Tacoma,
I didn't know what an interesting time I'd have. The visitor turned
out to be Bob Cameron, one of the best aerial photographers in
the world and certainly, at 82, the oldest.
<P>
He has asked Emmett to write the text for &quot;Above Seattle,&quot;
the 11th volume in a series of picture books he is doing on great
cities and their environs. The assignment puts Emmett in distinguished
company. On previous books Cameron wafted Alistair Cooke above
London, Pierre Salinger above Paris, George Plimpton above New
York, and Herb Caen above San Francisco.
<P>
Emmett knows more about his home town than anybody but, true to
Seattle type, he confesses that his knowledge of Tacoma extends
little beyond the aroma. He wanted me along in the helicopter
when Cameron was taking pictures so they wouldn't confuse Stadium
High with a hotel or the Narrows Bridge with the Eleventh Street
bridge.
<P>
So up the three of us went in a rented helicopter with a pilot
who didn't mind back seat drivers.
<P>
We went first to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The tower
gave us permission to park above the waterside runway. We sat
there about a thousand feet above ground while Cameron decided
exactly the angle that would best show the field, the terminal
building and hangars, the Old 99 strip, the valley and Mount Rainier,
which was cooperating splendidly.
<P>
&quot;Back about a hundred,&quot; Cameron would say over the intercom,
and the buildings would move away. &quot;Up fifty,&quot; and the
buildings would sink. &quot;Over a bit to our right.&quot; That
did it.
<P>
We spent about half an hour over Tacoma. The great thing about
the flight was watching Bob Cameron work. It is always a privilege
to see an old pro doing his job - and Cameron is the oldest pro
in the aerial photography field. He keeps his tools to a minimum
but uses the best available. His camera of choice is a Pentax
6-by-7 centimeter single lens reflex. He uses color transparency
film, and carries an ultraviolet filter, a Pentax TLL metering
prism, and several lenses which are always fixed at infinity.
His treasure is his $5,000 Kenyon Gyro-Stabilizer, which he began
using when he shot &quot;Above Paris&quot; 10 years ago.
<P>
The stabilizer looks a bit like a squashed bowling ball. With
the long-snouted Pentax bolted on top it seemed ominous. When
the two gyroscopes inside - one horizontal, the other vertical
- are whirling at 22,000 revolutions per minute, it sounds like
a disturbed wasp nest. Small wonder that Cameron sometimes has
trouble at airport pass-through checkpoints. Once aloft, though,
the stabilizer gives him a tripod that rests, magically but firmly,
on thin air.
<P>
Cameron has taken aerial photos from everything that can get airborne
except a glider or a spacecraft. He has used blimps, dirigibles,
balloons and fixed-wings, but he much prefers helicopters. He
likes the opportunity to pick the exact spot and insists they
are the safest thing in the air.
<P>
His own experience with cameras goes back to 1919 when his father
gave him a Brownie. He didn't plan to be a photographer. After
high school he knocked around France for several years before
enrolling at the University of Iowa. He married a coed he met
there (they now have four children, eight grandchildren and four
great-grandchildren) and dropped out of school to earn a living.
He found work as a photographer for a Des Moines newspaper. When
photographing the aftermath of murders began to pall, he went
into the dry ice business. Then came World War II.
<P>
Classified 4F by Selective Service, he found a job photographing
Army camp and factory construction for the War Department. He
enjoyed being airborne with a camera, but peace grounded him.
He took a job with a Connecticut company franchised to sell French
perfume and did so well he became company president. He visited
San Francisco on business so often that he fell in love with it,
sold his share of the company to his partner and moved the family
west.
<P>
Under the San Francisco influence he wrote a long essay, &quot;The
Drinking Man's Diet,&quot; which argued that eating lots of steak
and drinking lots of red wine promoted good health and longevity.
No one would publish it so he published it himself. It sold more
than two million copies. So he founded a publishing company, Cameron
&amp; Cameron (the other Cameron being one of his sons) and in
1965 produced &quot;Above San Francisco.&quot;
<P>
Total sales for the &quot;Above&quot; books exceed 2,500,000.
All remain in print. So, as he approaches 83, Bob Cameron is looking
for more cities to rise above. He yearns to do Mexico City but
laments, &quot;with all the pollution, you can't see it anymore.&quot;<I>

<H2>Jumbo and Mrs. General Cantwell</H2>

<P>
A soft-spoken man with a trim mustache and rimless glasses, Jacob
S. Coxey looked more like a prosperous farmer than an economic
messiah. He proved ineffective at publicizing his proposals until
he teamed with Carl Browne, a hustler whose faults did not include
a lack of flamboyance. Browne had been a housepainter, cartoonist,
theosophist, snake-oil salesman, and private secretary to Dennis
Kearney during that demagogue's anti-Chinese agitation.
<P>
A big fellow, notoriously reluctant to bathe, with long graying
hair and a beard worthy of a prophet, Browne decked himself out
in buckskin coat, fringed, of course, and with buttons made of
Mexican half dollars. His ensemble was completed with high boots,
sombrero, a fur coat of dubious derivation, and a necklace of
amber beads. His vocal range was from foghorn to buzz saw. As
an attracter of attention, Browne was a triple threat, combining
visual, vocal, and odoriferous pollution. He was also imaginative.
<P>
Browne and Coxey decided to send Congress &quot;a petition with
boots on.&quot; The unemployed would march on Washington to demand
passage of a Good Roads Bill and a Non-Interest-Bearing Bond Bill.
Coxey took credit for the idea of the march, Browne for calling
the marchers <I>&quot;The Commonweal Army of Christ.</I>&quot;
<P>
Browne painted a remarkable banner for the army to march under.
It bore a picture of Christ which critics felt looked suspiciously
like a Browne self-portrait, and it was captioned <I>&quot;Peace
on Earth, Good Will to Men, He Hath Risen, but Death to Interest
on Bonds.&quot;</I> 
<P>
The first battalion of the Commonweal Army started for Washington
from Massilon on Easter Sunday, 1894.
<P>
A color-bearer with Browne's banner led the way, followed by General
Coxey in a piano box buggy drawn by his forty thousand dollar
pacer Acolyte, and, in a separate carriage, the second Mrs. Coxey,
who held in her arms their infant son whose baptismal certificate
read, no mistake, Legal Tender Coxey. Marshall Browne rode a spirited
stallion.
<P>
The others walked. Among those in the ranks were Cyclone Kirtland,
an astrologer who claimed that according to the stars the army
would be <B>&quot;</B>invisible in war, invincible in peace&quot;;
Unknown Smith, who had earlier been known as ringmaster for a
disbanded circus; David McCallum, author of an economic treatise
which sold under the title Dogs and Fleas, by One of the Fleas;
Christopher Columbus Jones, a five-foot apostle of reform who
marched under a silk hat; and Jones's private secretary, who &quot;sustained
a plug hat with impressive dignity.&quot;
<P>
The Commonwealers numbered only two hundred by the most favorable
count but they were accompanied down the glory road by forty-three
reporters, four telegraph operators, and two linemen.
<P>
Carl Browne had done his public relations work well. Though the
stories the reporters filed were heavy with ridicule, they were
numerous. Coxey's tatterdemalion troops captured the national
imagination as they traipsed south. Others followed.
<P>
Tacoma and Seattle organized separate contingents in April, Seattle
first. On the afternoon of Saturday, April 8, some two hundred
men gathered in a skid road hall furnished with only two chairs
and a card table. Harry Shepard, a soft-spoken engineer, made
a quiet speech that called on &quot;the respectable unemployed&quot;
to unite for the amelioration of their condition. He urged order,
discipline, and self reliance in gathering food and funds for
a protest march across the continent.
<P>
The seventy-two who signed the muster roll the first day pledged
themselves &quot;to uphold the constitution, recognize only honest
workmen, assist any officer in the lawful discharge of his duty,
repudiate all connections with drunkards, thieves and convicts,
and to protect life, liberty and property.&quot; They elected
Shepard their general.
<P>
Tacoma organized a week later. The unemployed and their sympathizers
gathered in the National Theater, a run-down hall at Twelfth and
A streets. After considerable speechifying, the mantle of leadership
settled not on a quiet engineer like Shepard but on one of Tacoma's
loudest personalities, Frank P. &quot;Jumbo&quot; Cantwell, long-time
bouncer for Harry Morgan, occasional prize fighter, and current
husband of Morgan's common-law widow, Dora Charlotte-usually called
Charlotte.
<P>
Not for Jumbo a tone of respectability or a demand that his followers
eschew association with thieves and drunkards. Cantwell himself
was not unknown in police court. Respectability he could do without.
Notoriety was the spur.
<P>
Cantwell told the would-be marchers that they could hire a train
at cutrates to carry them to Washington. How to pay for it?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Every feller who follers us from Tacoma, we'll make him
dig up ten cents; militia, police, I don't care who he is-we'll
make him dig up. Then we'll use the money to pay our way. But
when we come back to Tacoma, we won't hang out at the Old National.
Oh, no. We'll go to the Tacoma Hotel and be the elite.&quot;</I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Or so said the Ledger in a report on his speech. The Ledger complained
that Jumbo's followers were &quot;the best dressed, best fed lot
of unemployed to be found on the Coast,&quot; and disapproved
of &quot;emigrants going not west but east, with no purpose but
to present a demand that the government shall help them, shall
take them in its charge and provide for them. The Army is marching
to the unknown in search of the impossible and the impractical.&quot;
The paper suggested that the government simply draft the unemployed,
ship them out of the country to Nicaragua, furnish them with pick
and shovel, and set them to digging a canal.
<P>
The Commonwealers were not to be dissuaded by such suggestions.
They organized into companies, or &quot;cantons,&quot; of sixty
men, drilled at marching by morning and in the afternoons rustled
provender for the mess. &quot;General&quot; Cantwell helped out
by boxing an exhibition and turning over his purse to the commissary.
Two meals were served daily. They were long on clams, crab, salmon,
and beans, short on meat and bread.
<P>
Cantwell and Shepard arranged that their Tacoma and Seattle armies
would meet at Puyallup at the end of the month. They would then
ask the Northern Pacific for train service east. While preparations
were being made for the Puyallup encampment, a Commonweal contingent
from Butte, Montana, flagged down a freight train, piled four
hundred men into fourteen empty boxcars, put an unemployed engineer
at the throttle, and headed east.
<P>
The Coxeyites regarded this as hitching a ride, the NP as stealing
a train. Railroad officials obtained a court order forbidding
anyone to deprive rightful owners of the use of their boxcars.
Fifteen deputy marshals were hastily sworn in. They caught up
with the train at Billings, where a crowd had gathered to wish
the Butte army godspeed.
<P>
The deputies started shooting and several bystanders were wounded
before the engine was uncoupled from the freight and the engineer
arrested. The townsfolk sided with the unemployed. They helped
the army liberate another engine and supplied the Commonwealers
with food. The train pulled out for the East with flags flying
and a live rooster perched on the locomotive. President Cleveland
called out the United States Army. Regulars from Fort Koegh found
the freight parked on a siding at Forsythe, Montana, the engineer
catching some sleep. The Industrials surrendered without resistance.
<P>
A reporter asked Jumbo Cantwell his views about commandeering
trains. Cantwell at the time was trying on a uniform that had
been presented him by fellow members of Tacoma's gambling fraternity:
a longtailed coat with epaulets, dark pants with blue stripes
down the leg, a broad-brimmed black hat heavy with braid.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;We'll get back there one way or another,&quot; he promised,
admiring his finery in a mirror. &quot;We ain't too proud to steal
a train. Them fellers in Congress has broke the law. Why can't
we?&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
United States Marshal James C. Drake began swearing in deputies
to guard railroad property. Deputies were easy to find: why, the
pay was five dollars a day, and room and board. Drake dispatched
a dozen to Puyallup where the Commonweal armies were to rendezvous;
others patrolled train yards in Seattle, Ellensberg, Yakima, and
Spokane.
<P>
They were armed with .45s and Winchester rifles requisitioned
from Tacoma sporting goods stores, and they carried copies of
a restraining order issued by United States Circuit Court Judge
C. H. Hanford of Seattle. It prohibited any action which would
deprive the receivers of the bankrupt Northern Pacific from the
regular use of the line's locomotives, cars, and equipment.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
The Seattle Commonwealers under &quot;General&quot; Shepard started
for Puyallup on April 28, Jumbo's Tacoma troops a day later. A
light drizzle was falling as the unemployed marched down Pacific
Avenue that Saturday afternoon, through a thin line of spectators
on the plank sidewalks. A guard of honor carried a flag presented
the Commonwealers by the local post of the Grand Army of the Republic.
It hung limply.
<P>
General Cantwell, his uniform partly concealed by a macintosh,
followed the flag. He kept the Colonel, his pet Saint Bernard,
on a long leash. Some four hundred Coxeyites marched after him.
They sang as they went down Pacific to Puyallup Boulevard then
over to the river, Civil War songs, and &quot;Good Night, Ladies,&quot;
and, to an old tune, the new words of &quot;Coxey's March&quot;:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Come now, you sons of labor, and join the noble cause. <BR>
It's time I'm sure for something to be done <BR>
For bread and meat is very scarce because of their cruel laws.
<BR>
We'll pack our traps and march to Washington. <BR>
So sing along, march along, <BR>
Come along, march along. <BR>
While the air is pure and balmy <BR>
And every mother's son <BR>
Will march to Washington <BR>
And join General Coxey's army. <BR>
Now we're all honest toilers <BR>
But can't get work to do. <BR>
From honest work we ne'er were known to run, <BR>
So help us Grover Cleveland <BR>
The times look very blue. <BR>
We'll pack our traps and march to Washington <BR>
Dish out a little silver. <BR>
We hear you've got too much <BR>
We'll try and help you spend it, just for fun. <BR>
Yes, silver's good enough for us, <BR>
For gold we'll neer touch. <BR>
We'll pack our traps and move to Washington. </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It was evening when they reached Puyallup. They moved into two
empty buildings their scouts had spotted and began steaming out
shoes and bedrolls. The Seattle army, already encamped in an unfinished
hotel, had commandeered a deserted cafe. The coffee was already
hot.
<P>
A United States marshal served General Cantwell with Judge Hanford's
order prohibiting interference with Northern Pacific trains. Jumbo
accepted the document, glanced at its index of things not to be
done, folded the injunction, and pocketed it, remarking enigmatically
that the Commonwealers had lost some property and would reclaim
it wherever they found it. At a joint rally in the Puyallup
<P>
Opera House later that evening Jumbo was the most frequent speaker,
and less obscure.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;I'm a gambler,&quot; he said in<B> </B>introducing himself
to the Seattle army. &quot;I'm not looking for a job, but I'll
lead you to work and to victory. We're like Christ. If they strike
us on one cheek, we'll turn the other. But then we'll give 'em
one.&quot; </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
He shadow-boxed about the stage to thundering applause.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
The next morning's papers brought news that Coxey's original band
from Massilon had reached the outskirts of Washington. The Associated
Press described them as &quot;350 miserably dressed, woebegone,
grumbling, out-at-the-elbows and down-at-the-heels specimens of
humanity,&quot; but the Tacomans were cheered by the story: it
could be done. And the story said Coxey was calling for reinforcements.
<P>
Cantwell and Shepard agreed to let Jumbo's wife do much of the
negotiating with railroad officials for the rent of a train. Charlotta
Cantwell was a handsome woman in her mid-twenties, well spoken
and well dressed, fond of diamonds and seal skin. The NP men were
impressed enough to be very polite but not enough to reduce fares
or rent her twenty boxcars to carry the Commonwealers as far as
St. Paul. Their position was full fare in passenger cars, no people
in boxcars.
<P>
Jumbo sounded out the federal marshals on their interpretation
of the judge's restraining order. What would they do if the unemployed
hopped freights in twos or threes, or even by the dozen? When
they gave him no encouragement he asked,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Well, what if one of us should hire a few cars and an
engine for the purpose of transporting freight say, to Spokane.
What if he ran it into Puyallup and said, &quot;Hey, these are
my friends and I am going to give them a pull across the mountains,
what would you do?&quot; </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The marshals shrugged off the question.
<P>
With other deputies, Cantwell took a different line. &quot;Now
you fellers are getting a good thing, $5 a day and keep. There
are upwards of a hundred of you and your job is easy. It costs
our gang about $25 a day to live here. If you contribute $25 to
our support, we'll stay three or four months, till the railroad
gets tired of putting up your pay and gives us a ride back east.&quot;
<P>
Such talk was probably aimed less at the deputies than at the
people of Puyallup, who were nervous about all the strangers.
In midweek there was word from Washington that Coxey, Browne,
and little Christopher Columbus Jones had been jailed on charges
of illegal assemblage on the Capitol grounds. The Ledger headline
read: Coxey Was Crushed. Puyallup might well wonder what would
happen if the march were abandoned and the army remained in camp.
<P>
They did not care whether the Commonwealers made it to Washington
but they wanted them out of town. They wired the governor for
help.
<P>
Governor John H. McGraw showed up in Puyallup ready for almost
anything. A feisty little man with a bald head, waterfall mustache,
and rimless pince-nez, McGraw had made his political reputation
when as sheriff of King County he stood up to the mob that attempted
to chase the Chinese from Seattle three months after the Tacoma
expulsion.
<P>
The Puyallup brass band met him at the depot, and a mass meeting
was arranged at the Robinson Opera House. A meeting suited the
Commonwealers fine. They had nothing else to do. They packed the
hall.
<P>
The chairman explained that Puyallup had a problem, or rather
from eleven hundred to thirteen hundred uninvited problems. The
governor was introduced and said he was there to listen. Ezra
Meeker said that what the Puyallup people wanted to hear was what
the Commonwealers intended to do. They brought Jumbo lumbering
to the podium.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
Cantwell said his men didn't want to be in Puyallup, they wanted
to be with Coxey in Washington. They were not thieves or hobos.
Not a chicken house in Puyallup had been disturbed. They would
not steal from people as poor as themselves. They weren't even
stealing rides. They were ready to pay a thousand dollars for
boxcars but the railroads wouldn't let them go even for money:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;These men came to this state through fraud and misrepresentation
on the part of the railroad corporations and a rotten, lying press.
Now for God's sake let them go. The Northern Pacific is owned
in Germany, and all the money of this country has been sent to
Europe, and these men have none. We won't disband here, and when
I say we won't, I speak for the Seattle contingent as well as
my own.&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Jumbo started to tell of finding powder buried along the track
near Orting. He suspected the railroad intended to blow up the
train if the Commonwealers seized one. The chairman ruled him
out of order. When the shouting died down, Cantwell was saying,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;. . . the highest men in this country don't want us to
get back to Washington but we'll get there<BR>
and get justice.&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
E. J. Jeffries, a tall, thin attorney who espoused Populist causes,
made his way from the audience. &quot;The governor, I believe,
will come to our rescue and enable us to leave the state . . .&quot;
<P>
McGraw stood up.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;I am not here for any such purpose.&quot; </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The light from the bare bulbs shone off his skull; his cascading
mustache was dark against his pale face.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;I am not in sympathy with this march or this movement.&quot;
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
There were gasps in the audience.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;As governor of this state I owe a duty to the state and
the nation. I came here solely to consult with the citizens of
the town, and if they will appoint a committee of ten, or fifteen,
aye, of twenty-five to go to Washington and present your petitions,
I will do all that I can to secure transportation for them. More
I cannot do.&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
There was a tumult of boos, hisses, and groans. Jerries turned
to McGraw, who had resumed his seat.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;It is said we should go home. We have no homes. Where
is it we should go? Back to Seattle, where the judge would vag
us in twenty-four hours? No, we want to go east, and there demand
redress of our wrongs from the chief executive of this nation.
Can you not, Governor McGraw, go to the courts and induce them
to give us transportation, even in cattle cars, to the end of
the line at St. Paul?&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The uproar in the hall drowned the words of Jeffries and the chairman.
Eventually McGraw signaled that he would like to speak. The room
quieted. The governor rose to dead silence; not a cheer, or handclap,
not even a boo greeted him. He said quietly that he had already
talked to officials of the Northern Pacific and, since the railroad
was in the hands of receivers, to agents of the justice Department.
The government did not want the marchers back in Washington, and
the NP would not carry the unemployed east without compensation.
<P>
The audience was no longer quiet. McGraw raised his voice against
the rising murmur, and his speech took on the tone of a political
statement.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;I look on this movement as wholly unwise. That men are
out of employment is a matter to be deplored. I know what it is
to work myself, and I know what hard labor means. This is a country
of magnificent resources and in this great nation, I believe,
there is room and opportunity for all . . .&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
An attorney in the audience shouted that the governor was not
speaking to the question. The Chair ruled that he was but amid
howls and hisses the governor said that the gentleman's position
was well taken and sat down.
<P>
When order was restored, a committee of Puyallup citizens was
named to discuss with the railroad people the question of getting
the Coxeyites somewhere else. The meeting adjourned. Outside it
was raining hard.
<P>
During the night, the leaders of the Seattle and Tacoma armies
agreed on a new strategy. they would break camp, cross the mountains
in small groups by any available means - which meant walking or
stealing rides on trains - and reassemble at Spokane where a new
attempt would be made to hire boxcars.
<P>
Throughout the following day the men trudged out of town, singly,
in pairs, in groups of a half dozen. The rain soaked their bedrolls,
ran in rivulets down the greasy frying pans strapped to their
packs, squished in their shoes. Only a few turned back toward
Tacoma or Seattle, though &quot;General&quot; Shepard gave up;
he had been deposed by his men and replaced as general by Jeffries,
the attorney.
<P>
Most of the Industrials headed eastward along the tracks leading
into the cloud hidden Cascades. As freights chuffed past up the
grades or stopped at stations and watering tanks, some of the
men swung aboard. The crews made no effort to dislodge them.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
At 5:00 P.m. a special freight left Tacoma for Spokane: fifteen
cars, five loaded with shingles, two with lumber, and eight cattle
cars, empty.
<P>
As the freight came into Alderton just east of Puyallup, a company
of the Seattle army climbed into the cattle cars, and as the lokey
struggled up the grade toward Buckley, the men already aboard
helped marchers along the track to climb in. When they reached
Buckley there were about 120 Commonwealers aboard, much given
to song.
<P>
The stationmaster wired Tacoma that &quot;the Industrials&quot;
had seized the train. United States Marshal Drake sent out a call
for all available deputies and commandeered a locomotive and passenger
car to give chase. Then came a corrective wire: the train had
not been captured. Its engineer, still in control, had pulled
onto a siding at Palmer, uncoupled the locomotive, and raced back
down to Buckley, leaving the stranded Commonwealers to keep warm
cursing him..
<P>
Marshal Drake canceled his call for a special and bought tickets
for himself and twenty-six deputies to Palmer on the regular Tacoma-to-Spokane
night train. At Puyallup, who should join the party with a first
class ticket but Jumbo Cantwell. It was a strange trip the marshal,
the general, and the deputies made through the storm. At every
stop a few Commonwealers tried to climb into the baggage car.
Jumbo busied himself boosting his boys in, while the deputies
helped the conductor and brakemen put them off.
<P>
As the train pulled away, Jumbo would shout back to his waterlogged
troops, &quot;Spokane or bust, boys, Spokane or bust. I'm with
you.&quot;
<P>
Between stations he joshed with the deputies. When he displayed
a Colt .45 and boasted of his ability with it, Deputy Jack Jolly,
who claimed to have been a lawman in the Southwest, took him up
on it.
<P>
&quot;I don't want to fight in this car because there are ladies
present, but if you'll step on the platform at the next station,
or come to the smoking room, I'll give you first draw.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, now,&quot; replied Jumbo, &quot;tell you what I'll
do. I'll shoot at a mark with you for two-bits a shot, or spit
at a crack, or run you a foot race. Come on. Where's your sporting
blood?&quot; No blood, sporting or otherwise, was shed.
<P>
At Palmer they found members of the sidetracked army shivering
under wet blankets in the cattle cars or huddled around a bonfire
in the lee of the water tank. The marshal assigned Jolly and six
deputies &quot;to keep order,&quot; then went on with General
Jumbo to spend the rest of the night at Hot Springs Hotel, which
beat Palmer all hollow for comfort.
<P>
The men they left behind quickly found common cause in denouncing
the privileges of the elite. A camaraderie developed between guards
and guarded. The deputies unlocked the depot and allowed the Commonwealers
to bed down with them around the potbelly stove. The next morning
they shared breakfast. The Northern Pacific had ordered the Stampede
Tunnel closed to men on foot. A few Commonwealers climbed the
old switchback trail over the pass, but the deputies allowed most
of them to walk the tunnel, and sometimes furnished escorts with
lamps.
<P>
Public sympathy was on the side of the unemployed. Wherever parties
camped-Orting, South Prairie, Buckley, Palmer, Hot Springs, and
in the towns across the mountains well-wishers brought food. When
Jumbo disembarked at Ellensburg ahead of his troops, two butchers
donated a side of beef apiece, a Chinese loaned his restaurant,
a baker turned over the use of his ovens, the town provided flour,
and that evening the general presided over a banquet for two hundred
marchers.
<P>
On May 9, there was violence. About 150 Commonwealers were on
a freight which was shunted onto a sidetrack two miles from North
Yakima. Marshal W. C. Chidester of Tacoma, a local politician
of considerable popularity, arrived with a dozen deputies but
could not persuade the riders to disembark. He walked to Yakima,
wired for reinforcement, and returned to the train at the head
of a forty-eight-man posse.
<P>
Chidester ordered the engineer to back down the hill onto a bridge
over the Yakima River. The Commonwealers set the handbrakes. When
the deputies tried to release the brakes, fights broke out atop
the boxcars. Half of Yakima had turned out to watch the excitement.
Fights broke out among the spectators too. Shooting started among
the spectators, though who was being aimed at by whom was never
determined.
<P>
Three Industrials suffered flesh wounds, Marshal Chidester was
shot through the leg and Deputy Jolly through the lung. Jolly
was quoted as saying Chidester wounded himself trying to get his
revolver from his pocket, then shot Jolly while hopping around
in<B> </B>pain. Both survived but their friendship did not.
<P>
The wounding of United States deputies in the course of duty led
judge Hanford to order the arrest on contempt charges of all Industrials
who defied his injunction and boarded trains. One hundred fifty-three
alleged free riders were rounded up at Yakima along with five
local citizens (an attorney, a former policeman, a former town
marshal, a saloon keeper, and a barber) sympathetic to the Coxey
movement.
<P>
They were loaded into boxcars, shipped to Spokane for safekeeping,
then back to Seattle for trial. Thirty were sentenced to sixty
days at McNeil Island penitentiary.
<P>
The disorganized remnants of the Tacoma and Seattle armies kept
on the move toward Spokane. They had no place else to go, no place
to stay. One group stole a flatcar from a siding, pushed it onto
the main line, and coasted twenty-five miles down the mountainside
to Ellensburg without meeting a train coming the other way.
<P>
Less lucky was a party that built a scow from lumber donated by
an Ellensburg mill. She was twenty feet long, six feet wide, flat-bottomed,
ugly, and unstable. They named her The Pride of Ellensburg, shoved
off into the swift-flowing Yakima, and overturned. Four of the
men were drowned; eleven were rescued after clinging to a fallen
tree for nine hours.
<P>
Most of the men walked. About half of those who had camped at
Puyallup joined Jumbo at Spokane, but no boxcars were to be rented
there either. Cantwell took the train to St. Paul to see if anything
could be arranged. His men set out along the tracks through the
Bitterroots and the Rockies, stealing rides when they could, slogging
it when necessary. They crossed the mountains through passes still
clogged with a record snowpack and came down onto the plains just
in time to catch the floods.
<P>
Jumbo Cantwell's command straggled into Great Falls, Montana,
with gunnysacks wrapped around ruined shoes, clothes in rags,
food gone, energy gone, hope gone. There Charlotta Cantwell, returning
from the reconnoitering trip to St. Paul on which she had accompanied
her husband, found them. She turned herself into a one woman USO.
She rented vacant houses, borrowed furniture, and found shelter
for 1,260 men in all.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
She rustled food from bakers and butchers, shoes and clothing
from church groups. By night she took over the Salvation Army
headquarters, which stood across from a line of saloons and dance
halls, and staged fundraising rallies that emptied the rival night-spots.
Her act was something to see.
<P>
So was Charlotte: young, blonde, with blue-gray eyes and a figure
always described by reporters as &quot;fine.&quot; She was traveling
with her six-year-old daughter by her previous marriage. For protection
they had the family Saint Bernard, Colonel. Mother and daughter
sang the songs of the Coxey movement, most of them new words to
familiar tunes, and pretty awful. &quot;Only Last Fall,&quot;
a ballad of bad times, was done to the music of &quot;After the
Ball&quot;:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Bright were the prospects, clouds not in sight <BR>
Happy your homes were, from morn to night <BR>
Then came the office sharks, spoke soft and low <BR>
Fooled you poor workmen. How, you now know. <BR>
You knew the reason, after it was done. <BR>
You helped close all the factories that run. <BR>
That's why you're idle, no work at all. <BR>
Voted your jobs away, only last fall. </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
After each number the Colonel would pass through the crowd, a
basket in his mouth, and fix each man with mournful eyes until
he contributed. If anyone reached in the basket for change, a
growl changed his mind.
<P>
While Mrs. General, as the men called her, shook down the business
community for contributions, the daughter of the regiment, chaperoned
by the Colonel, made the rounds of the saloons, selling copies
of Coxey songs, pictures of the General and Mrs. Jumbo, and poems
confected by her mother. their bestseller was the lachrymose &quot;Over
the Dam&quot;:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>'Tis hard looking up the bright river<BR>
And seeing where I might have turned back. <BR>
To think that I took things so easy <BR>
Letting everything go to the rack. <BR>
But I'm here now just as you find me. <BR>
And I'm-well, you can see what I am. <BR>
I drifted too long with the current <BR>
And of course I went over the dam. </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Charlotta not only managed to feed and clothe her men and get
them back on the road, but she left behind in Fort Worth a Home
Guard of the Industrial Army to take care of any Commonwealers
who came through later. She preceded the troops down the line
to St. Cloud, Minnesota, where on the Fourth of July she addressed
a huge crowd at a picnic sponsored by the American Railway Union.
<P>
She raised enough to hire a freight to carry the party on to Minneapolis.
Charlotta rode in the caboose with her daughter and the Colonel,
while the troops filled the boxcars. Now they were writing poems
about her, such as the toast proposed by Edward J. Clark, the
Coxey movement's poet laureate:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>You may drink to the trade <BR>
And the creatures of fame <BR>
But I raise not my glass <BR>
'Til I hear her sweet name. . . . <BR>
'Tis to<I><B> </B>her I will drink <BR>
Our companion in life <BR>
God's great inspiration <BR>
General Jumbo's wife. </I></I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
At Minneapolis the army split into smaller groups. The main body
headed for Washington; others drifted off toward their home states,
or pursued rumors of jobs. Mrs. Cantwell went to Chicago and there
she collapsed. Doctors told her she probably was suffering from
dropsy and would have to rest. She returned to Tacoma arriving,
she told a reporter, with $1.15, &quot;so you can see we're not
broke.&quot;
<P>
But the Coxey movement was broke and broken. Its treasury was
empty, and it had drained to the dregs the manpower available
for a march. Of thousands who started, hundreds arrived; of them
few stayed. Congress ignored them and they drifted away. Coxey
went back to Ohio to run for Congress. Carl Browne followed a
lady to Atlantic City. Only the die-hards stayed.
<P>
Jumbo Cantwell stayed. He established a small camp for his Puget
Sound constituents and managed to see that his men had two squares
a day. He joined eight generals in drafting a Petition of the
Unemployed and a proposed Bill to Provide Work for American Citizens.
<P>
The petition was a catch-all of demands from &quot;millions of
unemployed or partly unemployed and underpaid workingmen who have
naught but their ability to labor to provide themselves and families,
and whose average wealth would not purchase a decent coffin.&quot;
The bill proposed a work relief project under which the secretary
of war would hire any man who had been out of work thirty days
or more and employ him on public projects at a minimum wage of
two dollars for eight hours.
<P>
A Populist senator from Kansas presented the petition to his colleagues
and introduced the bill, which disappeared into committee and
never emerged. The Industrial Army disbanded and drifted out of
town. Coxey was defeated for Congress. Jumbo Cantwell returned
briefly to Tacoma, then dropped out of sight. When he was next
heard of he was an alderman on the Chicago council.
<P>
Charlotta stayed in Tacoma until the probate of Harry Morgan's
estate was completed in 1902. By the time the lawyers were paid
there was nothing left for her. This fascinating lady disappears
from the records at this point.
<P>
Coxey's proposals foreshadowed actions taken by the federal government
to combat later depressions, but all the Petition on Boots accomplished
as far as Tacoma was concerned was to drain the town of at least
four hundred men, 1 percent of the population.<HR>

<H2>William Combe: Writer describes things not seen</H2>

<P>
William Combe, whose ghostly activities as amanuensis for books
of travel in North West America was a master of a prose style
well suited to describing action.
<P>
Although the writer was circumscribed by the rules of debtor's
prison to a narrow area bordering the King's Bench Jail in London,
his mind roamed the world and conjured memorable detail in scenes
he had not actually witnessed.
<P>
Listen to this elegant, albeit bankrupt, Estonian as he describes
for John Meares the launch of <U>The North West America</U>, the
first vessel to go down the ways in the Pacific Northwest. The
year was 1789, the place Friendly Cove on Nootka Sound.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;The presence of the Americans, Robert Gray and the crew
of the <U>Lady Washington</U> ought to be considered when we are
describing this important crisis which, from the labor that produced
it, the scene that surrounded it, the spectators that beheld it,
and the commercial advantages, as well ad civilizing ideas, connected
with it, will attach some little consequence to its proceeding,
in the mind of the philosopher, as well as in the view of the
politician.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Our suspense was not of long duration.On the firing of
a gun the vessel started from the waves like a shot. Indeed she
went off with so much velocity, that she nearly made her way out
of the harbor; for the fact was that not being very much accustomed
to this business, we had forgotten to place an anchor and cable
on board to bring her up. The boats, however, soon towed her to
her intended station.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Tianna (a six foot five inch Hawaiian prince who Meares
was taking back to the island from China) was on board the vessel
at the time of her being launched; he not only saw but may be
said to have felt the operation as it if had been the work of
enchantment, and expressed astonishment by capering about, clapping
his hands and exclaiming, &quot;myty, myty,&quot; the word most
expressive in the language of the Sandwich Islands to convey wonder,
approbation and delight.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;The Chinese carpenters who had helped assemble the vessel
were in almost equal degree of astonishment. Nor were the natives
of the Sound, who were present at the ceremony less impressed
by a series of operations, the simplest of which was far above
their comprehension. In short, this business did not fail to raise
us still higher in their good opinion, and to afford them better
and more correct notions than they hitherto possessed of the superiority
of civilized over savage life.&quot;</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
Combe's racial attitudes, of course, were those of Georgian England.
They show up again in a passage from his other famous work on
the Northwest, &quot;Mackenzies Voyages,&quot; in which he describes
a wild run down a tributary of the Fraser on June 13, 1793.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;We accordingly pushed off, and had proceeded but a very
short way when the canoe struck, and notwithstanding all our exertions,
the violence of the current was so great as to drive her sideways
down the river, and break her by the first bar.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;We had hardly regained our situation when we drove against
a rock which shattered the stern of the canoe in such a manner
that it held only by the gunwales, so that the steersman could
no longer keep his place. The violence of this stroke drove us
to the opposite side of the river which is but narrow, when the
bow met the same fate as the stern.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;At this moment the foreman seized on some branches of
a small tree in the hope of bringing up the canoe, but such was
their elasticity that in a manner not easily described, he was
jerked on shore in an instance, and with a degree of violence
that threatened his destruction.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;We had no time to turn from our won situation to inquire
what had befallen him; for in a few moments we came across a cascade
which broke several large holes in the bottom of the canoe and
started up all the bars, except one behind the scooping seat.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;If this accident, however, had not happened, the vessel
must have been irretrievably overset. The wreck becoming flat
on the water, we all jumped out, while the steersman who had not
recovered from his fright called out to his companions to save
themselves.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;My commands superseded the effects of his fear, and they
all held fast to the wreck; to which fortunate resolutely we owed
our safety, as we should otherwise have been dashed against the
rocks by the force of the water, or driven over the cascades.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;We were forced several hundred yards, ever hard on the
verge of destruction, but at length arrived in shallow water and
a small eddy, where we were enabled to make a stand. This alarming
scene with all its terrors and dangers occupied only a few minutes,
and in the present suspension of it, we called to the people on
shore to come to our assistance.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;The foreman had escaped unhurt from the extraordinary
jerk with which he was thrown out of the boat, and just as we
were beginning to take our effects out of the water he appeared
to give his assistance. The Indians, when they saw our deplorable
situation, instead of making the least effort to help us, sat
down and gave vent to their tears.&quot;</I>

<HR>

<H2>Lucien F. Cook and his transit plan</H2>

<P>
The first proposal for a rapid transit system connecting Puget
Sound communities was made more than a century ago.
<P>
In the summer of 1892 Lucien F. Cook, a Tacoma real estate dealer
and inventor, set up a miniature working model of an elevated,
electric-powered railroad. He invited visitors and especially
investors to see the big toy in the Tacoma Post Office building
at 1016 Pacific Ave.
<P>
Cook's contraption had two narrow tracks, one above the other,
suspended from poles on a single line of piers. The car was designed
to be suspended from the upper track and stabilized by horizontal
wheels at the bottom of the car, bearing against the lower rail.
The car would be very light and extremely narrow, only three feet
wide with passengers in single file, one behind the other.
<P>
Cars would be constructed in varied length to seat from eight
to 30 riders. Cook estimated that it would cost about $15,000
a mile to construct a track from Tacoma's Commencement Bay to
Seattle's Elliott Bay, and that the trip would take 20 minutes.
<P>
Cook found enough support to be able to build a full-sized model,
about a quarter-mile long, on the waterfront below the Tacoma
Hotel, which stood on A Street Between 10th and 11th.
<P>
Test runs were conducted on the afternoon of Friday, Nov. 26.
The first runs were made with an empty car. Those runs went so
well that as many as 10 volunteers at a time risked the trip in
the flimsy cars. There was no regulator to adjust the flow of
power so the train's starts and stops were emphatically abrupt,
but no one was hurt.
<P>
Civil engineer Henry Shaw, who served as motorman, said he would
not be afraid to run a train at 100 miles an hour. Promoter Cook
thought the upper limit would be 200 mph and spoke of the possibility
of a transcontinental train that would deliver the New York morning
papers to Tacoma at 1 p.m.
<P>
But the Panic of '93 struck a few months later. Investment capital
disappeared, as did all mention in the papers of Lucien Cook and
the overhead rapid transit system.
<P>
In July of 1895 the Tacoma Daily Ledger carried a one-paragraph
item on page 2 that said Henry Bucey of Buena was visiting town
to raise funds for &quot;an air line steam railroad&quot; to run
between Tacoma and Seattle. The subject never again came up in
print.
<P>
In 1900 a conventional light rail service between Tacoma and Seattle
began with electric engines drawing power from a third rail. It
lasted more than 30 years before giving way to the automobile
and the bus.
<P>
But even with the Interurban offering 70-minute trips between
the two cities there were still those who dreamed of faster transportation,
among them William H. Boyes.
<P>
In 1910 Boyes and two other men, all residents in a First Avenue
hotel in Seattle, signed papers incorporating the Seattle-Tacoma
Monorail Co., which proposed to offer high-speed rail service
between Puget Sound cities.
<P>
They circulated a photo, supposedly taken somewhere on the Tacoma
Tideflats, showing a futuristic car, remarkably like the present
Seattle monorail cars.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
It appears to be perhaps 25 feet long. Men in business clothes
peer from the side windows. An engineer in hat, tie and vest sits
in the drivers seat. The car rests on a single rail supported
by a dozen closely spaced pillars. To one of the pillars two large
signs are fastened. &quot;Wm. H. Boyes,&quot; says one. &quot;Monorail&quot;
says the other.
<P>
No contemporary story has been found in any Tacoma paper about
the construction of the model. But in the spring of 1911 a man
representing himself as G.E. Boyes, president of Boyes Monorail
Edmonds Co. obtained a 25-year franchise from the Edmonds City
Council to provide 10-minute monorail service between Edmonds
and Seattle at 10 cents a ride.
<P>
According to Kay V. Cloud's &quot;Edmonds, The Gem of Puget Sound,&quot;
the town held a civic celebration on May 2, 1911, when the first
support post for the monorail was put in place. &quot;Hopeful
speeches were made.&quot;
<P>
A week later, a &quot;penetrating odor&quot; emanating from the
monorail site was traced to a dead skunk that had fallen into
an open post hole. The skunk's demise was an ill omen. The timbers
and steel for the monorail track and the experimental cars that
were supposed to arrive within days never showed up.
<P>
On Oct. 21 of 1911 Harry Habey, J.L. Larimer and Royal A. McClure
procured an order from a Judge Tallman requiring the Pacific Railway
Co. (monorail) and W.H. Boyes, president, to show cause why a
receiver should not be appointed. Boyes was ordered to allow stockholders
to inspect the company books or show cause for his refusal. The
stockholders charged that $15,000 worth of stock had been sold
and that $10,000 had been used by Boyes for his personal requirements.
It is not known if anyone got money back.
<P>
Not until Seattle's Century 21 Exposition in 1962 was a working
monorail built. The Alweg Rapid Transit Systems built a $3.5 million
line to carry cars designed by an Italian automobile-building
firm and manufactured in Germany.
<P>
The line runs from the downtown business district to the former
exposition grounds, now the Seattle Center. There was talk of
extending it to Boeing's Duwamish plant, or even running it to
Tacoma.
<P>
That didn't happen, but the monorail still serves an estimated
400,000 passengers a year, gliding quietly over the street traffic.

<H2>George Cotterill, Hiram Gill and the Potlatch Riots</H2>

<P>
In the election of 1912 the [Seattle] voters had a clear cut choice
between good and evil-at the very least, between a closed town
and an open town: Hiram Gill versus George Cotterill.
<P>
Cotterill was a solidly built, youngish civil engineer of forty-seven,
a politician of liberal-reformist kidney. He had served as assistant
city engineer under that cross-grained genius Reginald H. Thomson,
and had helped to formulate the plans for reconstructing the water-supply
system of Seattle and the topography of part of Puget Sound.
<P>
Though Cotterill's first political leanings had been Republican
(he came to Seattle from England by way of New Jersey), he became
disgusted with the local GOP because, as the dominant party, it
was being wooed and won by open-town advocates. William Jennings
Bryan's cross-of-gold oration won Cotterill for the Democrats,
and he usually supported them, though he had nothing against Populists,
Silver Republicans, and Bull Moosers.
<P>
In 1902 Cotterill ran against Tom Humes, &quot;a race for principle,
not for office,&quot; he later called it. In 1912 the reform element
picked him to try again. This time Cotterill made it, defeating
Gill, to the disgust of the Times.
<P>
Colonel Blethen was in a pet. All the sacred orthodoxies were
being overthrown. The direct primary ended the party-convention
system, and candidates in city elections ran without the official
backing of political parties. Women had suffrage. The reformers
captured the city government.
<P>
The state not only cast its seven electoral votes for the Progressives
in 1912 but the Republicans finished third, far behind the Democrats
and a bare thirty thousand votes ahead of the despised Socialists.
The Colonel got the Wobbly Horrors.
<P>
The Wobblies--the Industrial Workers of the World--were active
in Seattle. Every night their speakers mounted soapboxes along
the Skid Road and sometimes in the business district-even in front
of the Times Building.
<P>
One spring afternoon in 1912 they marched through town in a parade,
the red flag flying next to the Stars and Stripes. The police
didn't stop them, but the crowd did. There was a small riot as
spectators fought the Wobblies for possession of the red flag.
From that time on Blethen campaigned against Mayor Cotterill on
the issue of &quot;red-flag anarchy.&quot;
<P>
Blethen contended that the mayor, by permitting the Wobblies to
talk, was endangering the safety of the community; he argued that,
law or no law, the Wobblies should be suppressed; permitting them
to carry on their activities was not liberty but license.
<P>
Cotterill believed that to deny someone the right to speak or
to carry a banner when no law prohibited such speeches or banners
was &quot;to evade the rule of law and was therefore no way to
suppress anarchy. Indeed, such actions would be anarchy.&quot;
<P>
The dispute came to a climax on a sultry August evening in 1913
Josephus Daniels, the Secretary of the Navy, had been invited
to Seattle to speak as part of the Potlatch Days celebration,
a jamboree arranged to draw visitors to town during the dog days.
After being introduced by Mayor Cotterill to the dignitaries assembled
at the ultra-respectable Rainier Club, Daniels made a routine
patriotic address, a set speech he had delivered some weeks before
in Erie, Pennsylvania.
<P>
Most of the men present were political opponents of the city administration
and they cheered with unusual fervor when Daniels spread the eagle.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
While the business community was demonstrating its sympathies
at the Club, Mrs. Annie Miller, a pacifist, delivered a speech
to a Skid Road crowd from a portable platform she set up on Occidental
near Washington Street. As she talked a trio of sailors on leave
from Whidbey Island joined the crowd. They heckled the speaker,
and she in turn called them drones and burdens on the working
class.
<P>
The crowd was pro-Miller. When she left the stand, one of the
sailors mounted it and made a speech too, probably just as patriotic
as the speech delivered by the Secretary of the Navy, but it was
received with jeers. After a while Mrs. Miller tried to get her
stand back from the sailors; it was rented, she said, and if she
didn't return it now she'd have to pay overtime. A sailor told
her to shut up and raised his fist.
<P>
Then, according to the sworn statement of several witnesses, &quot;a
large well-dressed man, with a diamond ring, who bore no resemblance
to the typical IWW, broke in. 'You would strike a woman!' he shouted,
and struck the sailor with his fist a number of times.&quot;
<P>
Some soldiers rushed to the support of the Navy. The military
were roughed up thoroughly before the police came to their rescue.
Three of the men were treated at the hospital, but all were released
in time to make it back to their stations. Up to this point it
was just another street-corner brawl, but then M. M. Mattison,
the political reporter for the Times, went to work on it. He gave
his story the full political treatment:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Practically at the very moment a gang of red-flag worshippers
and anarchists were brutally beating two bluejackets and three
soldiers who had dared protest against the insults heaped on the
American flag at a soap-box meeting on Washington Street last
night, Secretary of the Navy Daniels, cheered on by the wildly
enthusiastic and patriotic Americans present, rayed as a type
the mayor of any city who permits red-flag demonstrations in a
community of which he is the head.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Warming to his topic, the Secretary proceeded with a merciless
denunciation of the cowardly un-American, who, occupying the highest
position in the gift of an American city, fosters anarchy in the
streets by permitting the display of the red flag and the demonstrations
of its adherents.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
After reporting a version of the street fight in which Mrs. Miller
was described as an IWW and was accused of swearing at the sailors
and insulting the flag, Mattison closed his account with a series
of quotes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;The participants in last night's outrage ought to be
rounded up and driven out of town,&quot; said a National Guard
regimental commander. A leader of the veterans of the Spanish-American
War was quoted as saying that his men would parade past the headquarters
&quot;armed with everything from bolos to head axes.&quot; And
&quot;underground channels&quot; were said to have notified police
that a large force of enlisted men would circulate in town that
night, ready to &quot;decisively answer any insult.&quot;</I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
When the sailors appeared in the evening and smashed up Wobbly
headquarters, Mattison was there. After the riot he retired to
the Times office and wrote his story:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Anarchy, the grizzly hydra-headed serpent which Seattle has
been forced to nourish in its midst by a naturalized chief executive
for 18 months, was plucked from the city and wiped out in a blaze
of patriotism last night. Hundreds of sailors and artillerymen,
who carefully planned the entire maneuver yesterday morning, led
the thousands of cheering civilians to the attack and successfully
wrecked the Industrial Workers of the World headquarters and &quot;direct
action&quot; Socialist headquarters in various parts of the business
district....</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Fired with patriotic enthusiasm and armed only with small American
flags, the men in uniform wrecked the Industrial Workers of the
World headquarters on Washington Street, demolished the news stand
of Millard Price at Fourth Avenue and Pike Street, cleaned out
the Industrial Workers of the World office in the Nestor Building
on Westlake Avenue and the Socialist halls at the Granite Hotel,
Fifth and Virginia, and in an old church at Seventh and Olive
Streets. </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
They also broke into Socialist headquarters and messed things
up a bit, then wrecked a gospel mission in the Skid Road; when
they discovered their mistake in the latter spot, members of the
mob made one of their number kneel and kiss the flag. The active
mob, estimated at from a thousand by the Sun to twenty thousand
by the Times, was watched by a huge crowd that had gathered for
a Potlatch parade. According to Mattison's story, everyone was
happy; Mattison obviously was--his delight echoed in his prose:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>The smashing of chairs and tables, the rending of yielding
timbers, the creaking and groaning of sundered walls, and above
the rest the crash of glass of the windows on the east side all
blended together in one grand Wagnerian cacophony. And all the
while the crowd outside just howled and cheered. It was almost
more joy than they could stand.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It was definitely more than Mayor Cotterill could stand. He felt
that the Times had stage--managed the riot, and, while it had
passed almost without bloodshed--one Wobbly got a broken nose--a
resumption of the battle, with the Wobblies ready and the town
packed with holiday visitors, might bring on real anarchy. Cotterill
assumed personal command of the police and fire departments.
<P>
He ordered the second platoon of firemen, the men ordinarily off
duty, to help police the town. He issued orders that the liquor
stores must remain closed on Saturday and Sunday, and that all
street meetings and public speaking be suspended. He ordered the
chief of police to see to it that no copies of the Seattle Times
were circulated within the city limits until the following Monday,
&quot;unless the proprietors submit to me the entire proofs of
any proposed issue and that it be found and certified by me as
containing nothing calculated to incite to further riot, destruction
of property and danger to human life.&quot;
<P>
Chief of Police Bannick stationed a force of twenty-five policemen
around the Times Building, to see that no copies of the Times
leaked out, then went to the colonel's office and handed him a
copy of the proclamation. When Blethen calmed down enough to be
articulate he telephoned his attorney. The lawyer called Judge
Humphries at his home--it was a Saturday morning in August and
Humphries was the only jurist in town--and asked him to hold court.
The judge wrote out bench warrants for Mayor Cotterill and Chief
of Police Bannick, ordering them to appear in court at once.
<P>
It was early afternoon before the warrants were served and the
officials brought before the bar. Judge Humphries, a ponderous
man of profoundly conservative views, asked Cotterill what he
meant by such interference with freedom of the press. The mayor,
using Blethen's own favorite phrase, said that stories as inaccurate
as the one that touched off the Potlatch Riot were not an exercise
of liberty but of license.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
The irony of Blethen's paper being suppressed on the ground that
it was creating anarchy in its advocacy of suppressing anarchy
was lost on Judge Humphries. He was not amused. He issued an order
restraining Cotterill from interfering further with the Times.
(His phrasing indicated that he considered the mayor's action
to be in restraint of business rather than a violation of freedom
of the press.)
<P>
But having told Cotterill to remove the police from around the
Times plant immediately, Humphries proceeded to scold him for
almost an hour for overstepping his authority, a lecture the mayor
rather enjoyed because as long as he was in the courtroom listening
the Times Building was blockaded.
<P>
The police were withdrawn by mid afternoon. The Times hit the
streets with an account of the riot and a story about its troubles
with Cotterill. It referred to the mayor as &quot;an advocate
of anarchy,&quot; and the leader of a red-flag gang,&quot; and
&quot;a loathsome louse,&quot; but in general its tone was mild.
No one was incited to further riot. The last evening of the Potlatch
celebration passed quietly.
<P>
On Sunday the Seattle Sun, a newborn reformist paper, carried
a long statement by the mayor, reviewing his actions. He stood
four-square on civil liberties for everyone, with the possible
exception of Colonel Blethen:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>From the time I became mayor of the City of Seattle, I have
directed constantly that in the making of arrests without warrant
no person shall be thus arrested unless the officer making the
arrest has information of his own knowledge or evidence from some
other person upon which to base a definite charge for the violation
of some law or ordinance. </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>So far as I have controlling influence, there has been and
shall be no dragging of people to jail for detention and release
without charge, or for nominal charge unsustained by evidence
or expecting dismissal by the police judge.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>On occasion when the Seattle Times has printed quoted treasonable
statements alleged to have been made by some speaker, I have demanded
from the reporter or city editor that they support by evidence
a prosecution in the particular case which they claim to have
heard. Such request has been refused.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>I can not lawfully, nor will I arbitrarily, attempt to suppress
or curtail free speech anywhere on suspicion or rumor or Seattle
Times lies.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In cases where anarchy was openly advocated, as Cotterill felt
it had been in the Times' story of Daniels' speech and the Skid
Road brawl, he would take action. He defended his move in depriving
Seattleites of alcohol and Blethen editorials for the duration
of the Potlatch as being in the public interest.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;I applied every power at command,&quot; he said, &quot;to
preserve the peace and prevent renewed rioting and threats to
life and property. . . . If I can be blown down by a putrid blast
from the Seattle Times, I have no right or desire to publicly
serve.&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It was neither the cool civil-libertarian logic nor the hot rhetoric
that attracted the most attention in Cotterill's statement. What
Seattle buzzed about was his reference to some photographs, doctored
and dirty. There had been rumors of these photographs but now
the story was out in the open.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
In May 1912, according to Cotterill, he had gone to Blethen's
office to talk over his troubles with the Times and to see if
some agreement could be reached. But &quot;Blethen was bitter
in his denunciation of Dr. Mark A. Matthews, Prosecuting Attorney
Murphy, and others connected with the grand jury which had indicted
him,&quot; Cotterill wrote.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>With singular boldness he forced upon my attention two disgraceful
photographs bearing the heads of the two gentlemen upon human
figures in indescribably loathsome relations.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
He--Alden J. Blethen--explained in detail how and why he had conceived
the idea of these vile photographs, secured foundation pictures
by searching out some indecencies from a Paris collection, engaged
one of our best Seattle artists to combine them with perfect photographic
skill with the heads and faces of Dr. Matthews and of Prosecuting
Attorney Murphy. The name of the photographer and the price he
paid for making these faked exhibitions of degeneracy was part
of the Blethen recital.&quot;
<P>
The townsfolk looked toward the Times Building for further developments.
Blethen's answer was not long in coming. In a front page editorial
the colonel admitted that he had had the fake photographs put
together. His purpose, he explained, was purely educational.
<P>
When the grand jury had indicted him for association with the
city vice lords, he had heard a rumor that the prosecution proposed
to introduce
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;a piece of testimony . . . of a most damnable character,
an alleged photograph, faked for the purpose, but representing
the editor with a lewd woman under extraordinary circumstances.&quot;
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
So, to demonstrate to a jury how easily such documentation could
be faked, Blethen had ordered similar photos involving Murphy
and Dr. Matthews.
<P>
&quot;The sole purpose, as Cotterill knows, was to demonstrate
the viciousness of the Corliss-Burns gang, and to what ends they
would go to convict an innocent man of crime.&quot; But since
the judge had directed the jury to bring in a verdict for the
defendant without Blethen's taking the stand, he had not needed
to use the photographs in court. He had shown them to Cotterill
merely because he thought the mayor would be interested.
<P>
The fight reached the halls of Congress. Representative J. W.
Bryan of Bremerton, a Republican who had bolted to the Bull Moose
and won election as delegate-at-large, read into the Congressional
Record a long critique of the colonel's actions, including the
complete text of Cotterill's statement.
<P>
Representative Humphreys of Seattle replied on behalf of Blethen.
He said,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;As to the action of my colleague in attacking various
persons in private life here upon the floor of the House, where
he has the protection of the Constitution thrown about him and
can not be called to account elsewhere for what he may say, one
of the highest privileges that the Government can confer, I do
not care to comment.&quot; </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Bryan hurried back to Seattle.
<P>
In a speech before five thousand sympathizers in the Dreamland
Auditorium he repeated the charges without benefit of congressional
immunity from libel. The meeting adopted by acclamation a resolution
censuring the Times &quot;terroristic tactics&quot; and agreeing
to boycott not only the paper but the advertisers who make its
existence possible.&quot;
<P>
The boycott failed dismally. The Times continued to prosper. The
affair of the Potlatch Riots dwindled off into a series of lawsuits--the
Times against Cotterill, Bryan against the Times, Blethen against
Bryan--none of which was ever pushed to a conclusion.
<P>
The real beneficiary of the confusion arising out of the Potlatch
Riots was wiry and wasp-tongued Hiram C. Gill. In the serenity
of the sidelines, the deposed mayor figured out a remarkable political
maneuver by which he turned the riots to his own advantage.
<P>
Gill had written his own political epitaph after his defeat by
Cotterill. When a reporter had asked him if he would run again,
he said, &quot;Hell, no! I'm one dead'un who knows he's dead.&quot;
But when he looked at the list of candidates in the mayoral primaries
in 1914 he felt it was time for his resurrection.
<P>
Cotterill, his eyes on a Senate seat (which he did not achieve)
had declined to run for re-election. Seven clean-city candidates
offered themselves at once. Nobody admitted believing in an open
town. On the last day for filing, Gill appeared at the city hall.
He paid his filing fee with one-dollar bills and told reporters,
&quot;Frankly, I'm getting into this because I know politics well
enough to recognize a soft touch when I see one.&quot;
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
Gill's re-entry into municipal politics was a surprise to many,
but his campaign was a shock to nearly everyone. He announced
that he was a reform candidate, the only candidate with the ability
to run a closed town effectively. Gill said he was running &quot;to
seek vindication&quot; and to prove to his children that he was
a good man.
<P>
His little boy had come home from school crying one day not long
after the 1912 election; his playmates had said that his father
was so bad he had been kicked out of his job. Now, said Gill,
he just wanted to prove to his son that all he had been doing
was the job as he had promised to do it. The people had elected
him in 1910 on his promise to give them an open town; nobody could
deny he kept that promise.
<P>
The people had changed their minds about an open town and as a
result they &quot;diselected me.&quot; Well, he had changed his
mind. He agreed with the voters. He believed in a closed town
and, with all the knowledge he had gained about vice operations
in his previous administration, he could run a better closed town
than any uninformed reformer.
<P>
He sounded convincing. Even the Reverend Dr. Matthews felt it
might be a good idea to give Gill a chance. When the primary votes
were counted, Gill polled two-fifths of the total. He ran two
to one ahead of his nearest rival, a businessman named James D.
Trenholme.
<P>
&quot;Why, that man was unbeatable,&quot; Cotterill said later.
&quot;He had all the vice votes. They didn't take his reform seriously
and they had no one close to vote for anyway. But he got a lot
of our votes too,&quot; Gill agreed. &quot;I told you I wouldn't
have run if it wasn't a particularly soft spot,&quot; he said.
<P>
Gill remained a gentleman through the month of the final campaign.
Gone was the candidate who in 1912 had lashed out at Cotterill
as &quot;a politician who sold the souls of young women to dive-keepers
for votes.&quot; In his place was a gentle campaigner who said
of his opponent, &quot;I think James D. Trenholme is personally
a fine man; he is a man of excellent moral character.&quot; As
an afterthought he mentioned that Trenholme was backed by the
Seattle Electric Company, which was then in very bad odor.
<P>
On a rainy March day the voters of Seattle elected this new Hiram
Gill mayor by the largest margin by which anyone had ever won
the office. Among those writing congratulations was John Considine.
He suggested that the mayor-elect appear on a vaudeville show
and deliver a five-minute monologue. He offered five hundred dollars
a week and said Gill could have it until he took office. Gill
declined, saying that Considine had paid Sarah Bernhardt seven
thousand a week and &quot;I being younger than the Divine Sarah
should not consider an offer of less than ten.&quot;
<P>
When he took office Gill ran a closed town. He offered the post
of chief of police to one of his political foes, Judge Austin
E. Griffiths. Griffiths didn't want the job but took it when Dr.
Matthews asked him to. Within a few months there were pictures
of Hiram Gill smashing kegs of whisky in illegal saloons and breaking
up gaming devices with a sledgehammer. Within a year Colonel Blethen
was demanding Gill's recall on the ground that he was too easy
on Wobbly agitators. &quot;An advocate of anarchy,&quot; said
the colonel.
<P>
Blethen died in 1915, and Gill was elected again in 1916. His
third term was his worst. Chief Griffiths had resigned to run
for Congress; his successor resigned as chief after being indicted
by a grand jury. Gill said he hadn't known what was going on.
Dr. Matthews thought this probable and spoke out for him. Talk
of another recall was dropped, but in 1917 Dr. Matthews and Gill
and all Seattle were told what was going on. The Skid Road was
wide open again. Military authorities noted that the venereal
disease rate at the major Army post of Camp Lewis was skyrocketing
and placed Seattle off-limits to troops.
<P>
Again Gill reformed. He named a strapping seven-footer, Jim Warren,
a former United States marshal, as chief of police, and closed
things down again. But he was dead politically, and this time
he didn't know it. He ran for re-election in 1918 and was badly
beaten in the primaries.
<P>
He had not made the most of the chance he had once asked the voters
to give him--the chance to tell his grandson that he had been
mayor of Seattle, had made a mistake, had been kicked out, but
had come back to be the best mayor Seattle ever had.
<P>
In the finals that year Seattle elected a red-headed reformer
named Ole Hanson.<HR>

<H2>Nicholas DeLin and his mill</H2>

<P>
On April Fool's Day 1852 a long-nosed, spade-bearded Swede was
grubbing in the golden skunk cabbage at the southeastern edge
of Commencement Bay. It was hog-work, leveling the soggy silt
washed back by the tides from the out fall of the Puyallup River,
not the type of labor a master carpenter preferred. But Nick Delin
was preparing the ground for industry.
<P>
In this patch of bog, where the no-see-ums hovered and the blackbirds
flashed their underwing rubies, he would build a dam to impound
the waters of two rivulets flowing from the gulch to the south
and use the water from the millpond to drive a saw in a mill of
his own devising. The spade-bearded Swede in the swamp at the
far edge of nowhere, crushing insects against his forehead as
he rubbed back the sweat, was the cutting edge of technology on
the Northwest frontier.
<P>
We know little about Delin's early life. He was born Nicholas
Dahlin somewhere in Sweden sometime in 1817. He was apprenticed
as a carpenter and after learning his trade crossed the Gulf of
Finland to St. Petersburg in Russia, where he worked as a cabinetmaker.
<P>
After five years he left for New York, then left New York for
Massachusetts, left Massachusetts in 1849 with some 150 other
adventurers bound around the Horn for the California gold fields,
left San Francisco for Portland the next year, and in 1851 moved
on to Puget Sound.
<P>
The scattered farms of the Bush-Simmons party had given rise to
a village. There Delin found work and learned the brief history
of Olympia. Big Mike Simmons had completed his grist mill below
the falls of the Deschutes in 1847, furnishing it with grindstones
chiseled from granite found on Eld Inlet. Now the settlers could
eat their own wheat, though the first years were unusually dry,
the crops were small, and most grain was needed for seed.
<P>
The gristmill in operation, Simmons started building a sawmill.
Seven other settlers teamed up with him and on August 20, 1847,
they entered a &quot;corporate commercial venture&quot; to be
called the Puget Sound Milling Company. The mill was built half
a mile below the falls, far enough down the river that logs could
be floated in from the inlet.
<P>
It was amid this change and turmoil that Nick Delin, the quiet
Swede, reached Olympia and quickly attracted attention by his
competence. The demand for lumber was growing; new mills were
being built up and down the Sound. Delin found financial backers
for a mill on Commencement Bay.
<P>
After he smoothed out the ground around what is now Twenty-fifth
and Dock streets in Tacoma, Delin hired Sam McCaw, a young Irishman
who lived near Steilacoom and had a team of oxen, to drag the
foundation timbers into place. He paid $150 for three days' work,
an extraordinary price at the time. Most of the other work, Delin
did himself. The mill stood on tall pilings, a gaunt shed facing
the bay with a broad trough extending down into the stream (Delin
Creek) up which saw logs could be moved.
<P>
A little to the south, Delin built his house, twenty-four by thirty
feet, one and a half stories tall, its exterior of upright planks,
the inner walls of hand-planed cedar weatherboard twelve inches
wide. It was simply but handsomely furnished, for Delin was not
only cabinetmaker but Scandinavian.
<P>
Nearby was a typical pioneer garden, a bit larger than most since
it supplied food for the mill hands: corn, beans, pumpkins, squashes,
potatoes, peas, turnips, cabbages, melons, cucumbers, beets, parsnips,
carrots, onions, tomatoes, radishes, lettuce, parsley, sweet fennel,
pepper grass, summer savory, and sunflowers. Delin had a few chickens,
a dog and a cat, but he had yet to find a wife.
<P>
He needed only three or four helpers in the mill. Jacob Burnhardt,
a twenty-nine-year-old German who had come out from Illinois,
built a log cabin at the edge of the bluff near today's Seventh
and Pacific, but Delin built small houses near the mill for his
other workers. Into one of them a young English couple moved:
William Sales to work in the mill, his twenty-four-year-old wife,
Eliza, to cook. On October 23, 1853, she gave birth to their son,
James, the first white child born in what is now Tacoma.
<P>
The mill started cutting lumber sometime late in 1852. The Puyallup
Indians thought it a wonderful show, watching solemnly as one
of the mill hands rolled a two-foot fir log onto the crude carriage,
fastened it with iron dogs, and Delin shoved the lever that released
water down the flume. The mill wheels slowly turned and the muley
saw rose and fell against the face of the log. Yellow sawdust
cascaded to the floor and the air grew heavy with the scent of
fresh-cut wood.
<P>
Delin's mill could do two thousand feet a day on the days when
the saw didn't hang up too often. It took him nearly six months
to make enough lumber to form a shipload. Then, since it all had
to be rafted down the creek and out to the George W. Emery and
hand-loaded over the side, several more weeks passed before the
brig sailed for San Francisco. But Commencement Bay was now a
port of call.
<P>
Most of Delin's logs were brought in by settlers who were clearing
their land. He paid not in cash but in lumber. He ran an ad in
the Washington Pioneer of Olympia:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>SAW LOGS! SAW LOGS!</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>The undersigned will let a contract for furnishing his mill
with saw logs on the following terms: he will allow $6 per log
to be paid for in lumber at $20 per thousand. Application to be
made immediately at his mill on the Puyallup Bay.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>
In the fall of 1853 the local population was increased by the
arrival of the first party of settlers to struggle over the Cascades.
A wagon train, led by James Longmire, had come up the Yakima Valley
and through the Naches Pass-the route taken in 1841 by Lieutenant
Bob Johnson of the Wilkes Expedition-rather than following the
Columbia to the Cowlitz, then dog-legging north.
<P>
The Longmire party expected a wagon road but found only the incline
trail that had been widened in places that summer by a party of
west-side settlers hoping to encourage immigration. The trail
was a torment. The wagons crossed the Naches River sixty-eight
times.
<P>
At one point on the west side the party had to slaughter some
0xen to provide rawhide ropes to lower wagons down a cliff. But
thirty-four of the thirty-six wagons and all 171 pioneers made
it to the Sound. Nick Delin had not only a fresh labor supply
but a local market for lumber as they scattered to homesteads
around Pierce County.
<P>
One wagon brought Peter Judson, forty; his wife Anna, thirty-six;
their sons Steven, fifteen, and Paul, thirteen; and their niece,
Gertrude Meller, thirteen, who had lost the rest of her family
to cholera on the trail. Originally from Cologne, Judson had lived
in Illinois before starting for California; along the way he changed
his mind and joined the Longmire train.
<P>
His fellow German, Jacob Burnhardt, was ready to give up on Puget
Sound. Judson bought Burnhardt's cabin at the foot of today's
Stadium Way for thirty dollars and filed claim on 321 acres stretching
from Seventh to Twentieth streets.
<P>
Such land as was naturally clear, about six acres in all, they
immediately sowed with grain and in the summer of 1854 harvested
oats where the post office now stands and wheat near the Union
Depot site. The Judson boys threshed out thirty-five bushels of
wheat with flails and rowed it to the Simmons gristmill on the
Deschutes for grinding.
<P>
Young Steve yoked the family's six oxen and snaked logs down the
gully the Indians called Shu-bahl-up, &quot;the sheltered place&quot;-today's
Old Town. The logs were stored in a lagoon, then towed one at
a time by rowboat to the Delin mill. With the aid of one feller,
a Swede named Peter Anderson, Steven could keep ahead of Delin's
saw. Besides supplying Delin with sawlogs, his new neighbors provided
the thirty-seven-year-old bachelor with a wife.
<P>
On November 25, 1854, Gertrude Meller, then fourteen, married
the mill owner in a ceremony performed at the Judson's new house
on the present site of the Union Depot. Portly little Sherwood
Bonney, another member of the Longmire party, who had just been
elected Pierce County Justice of the Peace, performed the ceremony.
There was now a community of whites on the south shore of the
bay.
<P>
The Sales had staked a claim on the bank of the Puyallup, where
they had as neighbors three German-American veterans of the Mexican
War-Jacob Kershner, Peter Runquist, and Carl Gorisch-as well as
Adam Benston, a Scot who had arrived as a servant of the Hudson's
Bay Company. On the waterfront west of the Stadium gulch, a cooper
named Chauncey Baird had built a small cabin alongside a big shed
in which he assembled fir barrels.
<P>
These he sold to John Swan and Peter Reilly, the first commercial
fishermen on the bay. When the salmon were running, Swan came
up from Olympia and with Reilly dragged in enormous catches with
seines set between Shubahlup and Cho-cho-chluth-&quot;the maple
wood&quot;-where the Smelter now stands. There are no recorded
figures, but pioneer memoirs spoke of hauls of two thousand salmon.
The fish were brined and shipped to San Francisco.
<P>
With logging, sawmilling, farming, barrel making, seining, and
fish-packing under way the little community seemed ready to coalesce
into a town. Instead there was war, and all was lost.

<H2>Cub Reporter Scooped Them All On Amelia's Rescue </H2>

<P>
Yet another book has been published about the disappearance of
Amelia Earhart over the Pacific in the summer of 1937.
<P>
This one, &quot;Lost Star,&quot; contends that Earhart was on
a spying mission for the United States and was captured by the
Japanese. The author theorizes that she still may be puttering
around the U.S., age 96, keeping her secrets for reasons of her
own.
<P>
Revelations like these remind me of my biggest scoop in my days
as a reporter. I achieved it when, fresh from the University of
Washington School of Journalism, I was a cub reporter on the Grays
Harbor Washingtonian in Hoquiam.
<P>
The Washie, as everybody called it, was not a great newspaper.
It was not even the best newspaper on the Harbor, that distinction
belonging to the Aberdeen World. We were short on subscribers,
short on advertisers and, consequently, short on staff. But we
were a morning paper and did come out on Sundays, which the World
didn't.
<P>
Our Sunday edition wasn't one of the monstrous ad-wrappers now
burdening carriers. It was lean to the point of emaciation, sometimes
only six pages, with a news hole so small that one man could handle
all the editorial work between 4 p.m. and midnight press time.
<P>
Which is why I was all alone in the city room on the night my
big story broke.
<P>
It was only the second time I'd played editor of a real paper.
I felt important sitting at the big desk by the door to the backshop,
the linotypes clanking behind me, the Associated Press teletype
clattering out wire copy in the booth to my right. I even put
on City Editor George Sundborg's green eyeshade.
<P>
I was penciling in stories on the dummy for the front page when
the phone rang.
<P>
&quot;Washingtonian,&quot; I answered. The conversation that followed
was something like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;I've just picked up Amelia,&quot; the caller said.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
The first woman to fly the Atlantic had disappeared over the Pacific
months before but the Navy was still looking for her.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;You've what?&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;I just picked up a message from her. She's all right. She's
on an island somewhere.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Who is this?&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Fred Something,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm over on Elm street.&quot;
He gave me an address. &quot;The signal was weak but I could make
it out.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Just a minute, Fred.&quot; I stuck my head in the backshop.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Anybody here know a Fred Something?&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Yeah. He's some nut that fools around with radios.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
I went back to the phone. Fred had hung up. I found an address
for him on Elm and dialed the number. Busy.
<P>
Then I remembered The Associated Press. I went into the teletype
room. The wire service was on regional split, sending material
for the state papers. I turned on the sender, tapped the bells
for a break-in, and typed HAM OPERATOR SAYS AMELIA SAFE.
<P>
Seattle cut right in. &quot;HQ - GIVE US FULLEST.&quot;
<P>
I typed: HOQUIAM - Fred Something, a local ham operator, reports
picking up a message from Amelia Earhart, saying she is on an
island, and safe. More to come.
<P>
The phone was ringing on my desk. It wasn't Fred, it was AP in
Seattle, asking me to give them all I had. I said that was all
my information. Just then Bill, our Aberdeen reporter, came in.
He had the day off but had been nuzzling the bar at the Elks and
stopped in to pick up his coat.
<P>
I sent him over to Fred's and told him to call in the details
as fast as he could. I went back to the desk and began planning
a new layout for the front page. The Washie had a font of huge
woodblock letters, maybe six inches high: Second Coming type,
it was irreverently called. I decided AMELIA SAFE! would fit.
<P>
AP called and asked if I had more. I said I didn't. They said
they couldn't get through to Fred either. More tine passed.
<P>
Bill finally came back, redder of face than before.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Where have you been? Why the hell didn't you call?&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Aw, no story. False alarm. The guy's a nut. He just collects
old radios. Place full of Atwater Kents but no wireless at all.
He can't send or receive. He had a case of Rainier though.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
I went back to the teletype, rang for the wire, started to type
a revise:
<P>
HOQUIAM - Fred Somebody, who reported receiving a message from
Amelia Earhart, does not possess wireless equipment. A collector
of used radios, he ...&quot;
<P>
The teletype bells clanged. BUST BUST BUST, Seattle order. Avoid
libel.
<P>
Seattle straightened out the revise. I wadded the AMELIA SAFE!
headline and missed the wastebasket on a push shot. There went
my world scoop. That, I thought, was that.
<P>
A few days later, the AP sent me the front pages of a few West
Coast papers that had been closing their early editions just as
I sent out my bulletin.
<P>
For them, I'd still found Amelia. <HR>

<H2>Clinton P. Ferry, Duke of Tacoma</H2>

<P>
C. P. Ferry came to Tacoma only a few months after Matthew Morton
McCarver. He built a house near that of the old boomer in Old
Town, served for a time as McCarver's private secretary, correcting
the general's inspired spelling and eventually marrying a daughter
of McCarver's second wife, which made him McCarver's stepson-in-law,
though he preferred to be called the Duke of Tacoma.
<P>
A man of imposing presence, big-nosed, long-jawed, loose-framed,
he was hard-working and intent on money. Ferry served as agent
for the Tacoma Land Company, handled McCarver's estate after his
death, and managed his own property well.
<P>
He pioneered the development of South Tacoma and the papers guessed
he was worth a million or two. After his first wife died, Ferry
courted and won a vivacious, auburn-haired divorcee, Cynthia Trafton,
who of course was considerably younger than he. He was very proud
of her. Jealous, too.
<P>
In 1889 Ferry's contributions to the Republican party were rewarded
with an appointment as United States commissioner to the Paris
Exposition. It seemed the perfect honeymoon: Paris, visits to
the 984-foot tower Alexandre Gustave Eiffel had built for the
event, a suite in the best hotel, a government carriage for rides
on the Champs Elysee, diplomatic status. What more could a girl
ask? Well, Cynthia wanted to learn French.
<P>
Ferry hired as tutor a champagne salesman who claimed noble connections.
Cynthia's efforts were assiduous, her accent improved steadily,
but Ferry's enthusiasm for bilingualism lessened. He found the
tutor to be more than efficient, he was also young and handsome.
<P>
A story in the Tacoma Ledger quoted a story in a New York paper
to the effect that the Duke of Tacoma was going about with his
hand in a cast because Cynthia had broken his forefinger when
he waved it under her nose during a discussion about elisions
in latinate derivatives.
<P>
Ferry decided it was time for them to return to Tacoma with the
ob'ets d'art they had collected for the new house Cynthia was
planning. She wouldn't go.
<P>
Ferry agreed to stay in Paris a while longer if she would promise
not to admit the tutor to their suite nor recognize him on the
street. She kept her word. She met him at a hotel. Ferry and a
detective interrupted one of the French lessons. During the explanations
that followed, she bit a chunk off her husband's nose. He demanded,
unsuccessfully, that Parisian authorities jail her as &quot;a
common woman.&quot;
<P>
When the Duke of Tacoma returned to his home turf, his patrician
nose appeared intact but Mrs. Ferry was not with him. She was
no longer Mrs. Ferry. He was accompanied, however, by the collection
of art they had purchased for the new house.
<P>
Most of it Ferry gave to the city's new museum, which he helped
finance and which was named for him. Some he gave to the city
for its parks. The two maidens guarding the Division Avenue entrance
to Wright Park are mementos of the Duke of Tacoma's time in Paris.
<P>
Out of personal misfortune, civic amenities. <HR>

<H2>Old Bill Fife played song of success in early Tacoma</H2>

<P>
I was doing some library work the other day when someone asked
how it happened that Tacoma named a street after a musical instrument.
<P>
Turned out he meant Fife Street, which like the city of Fife was
named for an early settler, not a high-pitched flute.
<P>
William H. Fife certainly deserved to have things named for him.
He was one of the area's most enterprising characters. A Canadian,
born in Ontario to Scottish immigrants, he was apprenticed at
17 to work in a general goods store for $5 a month.
<P>
He owned his own store by the time he was 20. At 30 he took time
off from store-keeping to join the rush to Caribou gold fields
in British Columbia. Coming back three years later with a modest
fortune, he moved his family to Michigan, then to Iowa, where
he built a store at a river crossing east of Sioux City and watched
the town of Cherokee grow up around it.
<P>
The idea of having the first store in a growing town appealed
to him. In 1873, when Fife was 40, the <I>Northern Pacific railroad</I>
was about to decide where its western terminus would be on Puget
Sound.
<P>
Fife visited the area and happened to be on Commencement Bay when
the N.P. announced that New Tacoma was its choice. He hurried
home, sold off his Cherokee holdings, and headed west with his
wife, their five children and two servants. They arrived at the
Tacoma station on the wharf on the evening of April 14, 1874 -
the day before the <I>Tacoma Land Company</I> officially put downtown
lots on sale.
<P>
After spending the night in the Blackwell Hotel, Fife sloshed
up the dirt path to Pacific Avenue, climbed the hill to C street
(now Broadway), and went to the headquarters of the <I>Tacoma
Land Company</I>, a one-room shack in a patch of skunk cabbage
at the southwest corner of Ninth and C. There, on the city plan
sketched by William Isaac Smith, he selected the northwest corner
of Ninth and Pacific Avenue as his first investment.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;We arrived on a Saturday,&quot; he recalled years later,
&quot;and on Tuesday we took dinner in our own house. You would
hardly call it a house now, but it was somewhat of a mansion in
those days, a shanty 18 by 24 feet. Nine of us sheltered beneath
its roof until I could put up a large house, which I began without
delay, a two-story frame directly in front of the shack. This
I used as a store and dwelling combined. It was the first general
merchandise store in Tacoma.&quot; </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>

<P>
Two months after coming to town, Fife was appointed Tacoma's postmaster
by President Grant. When the first sack of mail, containing six
letters, arrived at New Tacoma, 17-year-old Billy Fife volunteered
to hand deliver them, a service he performed intermittently until
he went to California to attend the Oakland Military School in
1877.
<P>
Young Billy (as he was called to differentiate him from his father,
Old Bill) also found time to play in Tacoma's first baseball game,
an inter-squad match between members of the Tacoma Invincibles.
It ended 28 to 29, both sides claiming victory.)
<P>
Anyone wanting stamps or other postal service had to call at the
Fife store. Old Bill thoughtfully put the counter in a far corner
so patrons had to thread their way past tempting barrels of molasses,
pickles, flour, sauerkraut and fish. This encouraged conversation
as well as sales. Fife became the best-informed man in town about
business opportunities. He invested in timberland, mineral claims
and nearby farmland, one section of which is now the city of Fife.
<P>
In an early venture, Fife bought a corner at Ninth and Market,
where there was a free-running stream. (The whole Tacoma hill
was so water-soaked that an Oregon editor joshed about the N.P.
trying to build a city in the shallowest lake or steepest swamp
known to man.) Fife built tanks, captured the spring water, piped
it down Ninth in bored-out logs, and provided Pacific Avenue with
its first tap water and a modicum of fire protection.
<P>
In the boom that followed the completion of the transcontinental
railroad in 1883, Fife prospered. His two-story frame was replaced
by a five-story masonry business block and hotel. He became vice
president of the <I>Tacoma Coal Co</I>. He organized the <I>Puget
Sound Dry Dock Co</I>. that brought a huge floating dry dock to
Quartermaster Harbor. He was a director in the <I>Crescent Creamery</I>,
the <I>Tacoma Exposition Co</I>. and the <I>Tacoma Opera Theatre
Company</I>; and a trustee of the Chamber of Commerce and the
Methodist church. Newspaper estimates in 1890 put his wealth at
$1 million or $2 million. He was said to pay more taxes than anyone
in the county.
<P>
The Panic of '93 hit Tacoma harder than any other city in the
country. Population fell from its estimated 53,000 in 1893 to
a census confirmed 37,714 in 1900. Wealth fled too.
<P>
Old Bill lost almost everything. In '93 he was living in style
in a hotel he had named for himself. In 1896 he was in a boarding
house a block away and his old hotel was called<I> The Donnelly</I>.
<P>
Friends marveled at his good humor and optimism. When word came
of the gold strike in the Yukon, Old Bill rushed north. He got
no farther than Skagway and returned as broke as when he left.
He went to live with a daughter in California who had married
a congressman, but at 70 he bolted to Nevada on news of another
gold discovery.
<P>
That didn't pan out for him either. He returned to his daughter's
home in Alameda just before his grandson was born in 1904. The
child was named for him. William Fife Knowland was to become publisher
of the<I> Oakland Tribune</I> and a United States senator.
<P>
Old Bill died in January of 1905.<HR>

<H2>Thea Foss and her waterway.</H2>

<P>
An exhibition of photographs of<I> &quot;Thea Foss Waterway: Past
and Present&quot;</I> opens today at the Handforth Gallery in
the Tacoma Library at 11th and Tacoma Avenue. I haven't seen the
pictures chosen but since the waterway was literally under the
noses of photographers for 125 years, it should be a great show.
<P>
The waterway these days is a fresh topic of redevelopment, with
planners envisioning expanses of parks, recreation and pedestrian
walkways. But the announcement of the Handforth exhibit set me
to thinking of moments when nobody was around with a camera.
<P>
On the morning of May 20, 1792 two small boats from George Vancouver's
ship <U>Discovery</U> came south from the passage between Vashon
Island and the Peninsula. For the first time Europeans looked
eastward up the bay. No camera man caught it. But Archibald Menzies,
the Scot botanist, left a word picture:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;We had a most charming prospect of Mount Rainier. The
low land at the head of the Bay swelled out very gradually to
form a most beautiful and majestic Mountain of great elevation
whose line of ascent appeared equally smooth &amp; gradual on
every side with a round obtuse summit covered two thirds of its
height down with perpetual snow as were also the summits of a
rugged ridge of Mountains that proceeded from it to the Northward.
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Variable winds, fine weather for our work. Two boats
examined and surveyed Commencement Bay and the rivers emptying
into it.&quot; </I>(The rivers Sinclair mentioned were two branches
of the Puyallup. One followed approximately the river's present
course across the tideflats. The other, at least as large, swung
sharply south and emptied into the waterway across from today's
15th Street).<I> </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;These rivers,&quot; Sinclair continued, &quot;form a
small flat off their mouths which is (word indecipherable) at
low water but at high water boats may go in and fill with water.
Followed them up about two or three miles. Low meadowlands on
their banks covered with fine grass on which vast numbers of ducks
and geese were feeding.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;There was another opening in the hills to the Southward
as though another small stream came in there but there was no
water for the boats to go up.&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
No cameraman was on hand on April Fool's Day 10 years later when
Nicholas Delin, a Swedish immigrant who had come west during the
California gold rush, began building a dam to impound water for
a water-powered sawmill he intended to build at the head of the
waterway. No photos exist of the completed mill, or of the little
bark George W. Emery that lay for many days out in the bay while
a load of lumber was rafted down the shallow waterway and manhandled,
board by board, over the stern to be carried to San Francisco.
<P>
Tacoma did have a photographer by the time the first steam mill
was built in Old Town, beyond the entrance to the waterway. He
was Anthony Carr, son of founding father Job Carr. Tony had been
a topographic photographer for the Union Army and came to Tacoma
in 1866.
<P>
Photographers flocked in after the completion of the Northern
Pacific railroad in 1883. Most early pictures of the waterway
were taken from the tideflats looking toward the city. That angle
displayed the rising skyline. Shots looking out from the downtown
bluff showed mostly mud.
<P>
The nature of the waterway changed dramatically after 1888 when
the St. Paul &amp; Tacoma Lumber Company decided the mudflats
could be firmed up enough with pilings to support heavy industry.
The company acquired 200 acres from the Northern Pacific and started
work on what for a time was the largest sawmill in the world.
<P>
At the same time the Tacoma Land Company, a subsidiary of the
Northern Pacific, had a giant dredge, 120 feet long and 32 feet
wide, towed north from San Diego. Anchored at the foot of 11th
Street, it worked around the dock for more than two years, dredging
2,500 to 3,000 cubic yards of submerged silt and sand and muck
which it spewed out behind walls of pilings on both sides of the
channel.
<P>
When three-inch-a-day rain, followed by a Chinook wind that melted
the snowpack, sent a record flood down the Puyallup in November,
carrying whole trees, dead cows, a barn and tons of silt into
the deepened waterway, and threatening both the St. Paul &amp;
Tacoma mill and the Pacific Naptha Launch Company, workers managed
to block off the southern branch of the river. After the river
fell, the south bed was filled with mill waste and the Puyallup
followed pretty much its present course across the tideflats.
<P>
A century of industrial growth followed.<HR>

<H2>George Gibbs,the man who gave us acres and acres of flowers
</H2>

<P>
George Gibbs was 52 years old in 1882 when he bought some land
on Orcas Island in the San Juans and brought his wife and their
eight children west from Missouri. He planned to start an apple
orchard and had no idea that he would become the father of the
commercial bulb industry in Washington.
<P>
A Gloustershireman, born near the cathedral town of Tewksbury,
he did some farm work as a youth but migrated to the United States
when he was 17. For two years he worked as a farm hand around
Buffalo, then moved west to Michigan. He bought a small farm,
married an Ann Arbor girl and enrolled for classes at the University
of Michigan.
<P>
When he heard of the gold strike in California, nothing could
keep him on the farm. He rushed west, spent two years prospecting
and returned to Michigan with enough in his poke to buy a larger
farm. It prospered. He was able to return to England for several
months, where his articles about agriculture found publication.
<P>
On his return to the States, Gibbs engaged in a variety of enterprises.
He managed a packing house owned by an Englishman, marketed grain
and lumber in Iowa and, in 1870, moved to Missouri, where he established
a wheat ranch southeast of Kansas City.
<P>
Then the westering urge hit him again. Intending to become an
orchardist he planted apple trees and an experimental stand of
hazelnuts. The apples did well.
<P>
In 1890 he leased 121 acres near the present Orcas ferry landing
for $10 a year. He planted more fruit trees but, as one history
book of Whatcom County puts it, also &quot;invested $5 in flower
bulbs including hyacinths, tulips, narcissi, crocuses and several
lilies.&quot;
<P>
Gibbs planted his bulbs in a small, hand-dug bed. He left them
in the ground for two years. When he dug them in 1894 he found
they had increased far beyond expectation, especially some hyacinths
that had been damaged in planting. They had a profusion of bulblets
around the damaged base.
<P>
A thoughtful farmer and an experienced businessman, Gibbs sensed
opportunity. The Panic of '93 had depressed prices. Apples were
being dumped on the market. There were many orchardists in Washington
but no bulb growers.
<P>
Gibbs ordered a large quantity of bulbs from eastern growers and
from Holland. He planted them in beds averaging 3 feet in width,
15 feet in length. Bulb cultivation was labor intensive. The beds
were dug by hand and planted by hand. But Gibbs and his wife had
eight kids.
<P>
When ordering bulbs from Holland, Gibbs asked for advice from
growers there. The Dutch considered their methods a trade secret,
so the advice he got was not encouraging. One grower warned him:
&quot;It is impossible for a grown man to succeed in this business
of bulb culture without having been familiarized with the industry
from childhood.&quot;
<P>
He replied by sending samples of the bulbs produced by San Juan
soil and sunshine. The astonished grower came to Orcas &quot;to
see for himself another land which could grow bulbs equal to Holland.&quot;
<P>
In 1898 a delegation of Dutch growers visited his gardens. A newspaper
story quoted them as saying they were &quot;astonished to see
such fine plants grown in this part of the world by a man who
has never been trained in bulb culture.&quot;
<P>
Gibbs began entering his plants in flower shows. He won a silver
medal at the Trans Mississippi International Exposition, the judges
declaring his Madonna Lily (lilium candidum) to be the largest
and finest they had ever seen.
<P>
In 1899 Gibbs sold the apple orchard and moved his bulbs to the
mainland, putting them in at the old Fort Bellingham site. Three
years later he moved them again to a site near Lynden, where he
remained for the rest of his long life.
<P>
Gibbs' successes attracted the attention of other growers. Bulb
cultivation spread southward throughout Whatcom County and Puget
Sound. In 1900 Edwin Wines and Emma Booker began growing bulbs
on Fox Island for sale in Tacoma.
<P>
George Lawyer of Fife was the first large-scale bulb grower in
Pierce County, planting his first bulbs in 1917. By 1920 he had
more than an acre in bulbs and harvested 244,000 cut flowers,
which sold for $4,347.75. By 1926 he was shipping bulbs to Chicago
and New York. George Gibbs' experimental investment of $5 in bulbs
had led to a new industry.
<P>
Gibbs himself died in 1919, the father of eight, the grandfather
of 13, great grandfather of 12 - and the Father of Commercial
Bulb Growing in Washington. Give him a thought when you drive
past acres of flowers that are coming into bloom this month.
<P>
Nearly all of the facts in this sketch are taken from <I>&quot;History
of the Flower Bulb Industry in Washington&quot;</I> by Charles
J. Gould, the long-time plant pathologist at Washington State
University's Puyallup Research and Extension Center in Puyallup.

<H2>Billy Gohl of Gray's Harbor</H2>

<P>
Billy Gohl was a short, round-headed, heavy-shouldered man in
his forties. He had brown hair, which he wore parted in the middle,
bartender fashion; and, indeed, he sometimes tended bar. His eyes
were big and blue and wide-set-honest, you might say. In an era
of free-flowing mustaches he went about bare-lipped. His chin
was square, his neck short, his chest heavy. He was tough and
he looked tough, which was no disadvantage in the Grays Harbor
of the Big Cut.
<P>
Billy was a great talker. His conversation centered on his business
pursuits and his hobbies. If the reports of his listeners to policemen,
sheriffs, and grand juries are to be credited, his conversations
were unforgettable. You'd start chatting with Billy about the
weather, and the next thing you knew he was launched into a recital
about a house he had burgled, a hotel he had burned, a ship he
had pirated, a man he had murdered, or a deer he had shot out
of season.
<P>
&quot;Nice weather for ducks,&quot; a bartender in a saloon on
Wishkah remarked one evening shortly before Christmas in 1909
when Billy rolled in out of the rain.
<P>
Billy slapped his sou'wester across his thick thigh, settled himself
solidly against the bar, and said, &quot;I've got to kill Charley.
As long as that scissor bill is walking around, I'm looking right
into the penitentiary.&quot; Charley was never seen again.
<P>
A cigar-store operator, whose competition had driven Gohl into
temporary bankruptcy, told police that Billy approached him amiably
on the street and remarked, &quot;You ain't going to be in business
so long yourself.&quot; That night the hotel housing the cigar
store burned to the wet ground-two guests along with it, one of
them being an elderly Swede who had annoyed Gohl some years before.
Billy was in excellent spirits when he next saw the burned-out
tobacco man. &quot;Ain't it funny how things work out?&quot; he
said. &quot;I never dreamed there'd be a bonus in it.&quot;
<P>
One night in a bar he explained to a considerable group how he
had rigged the bomb. &quot;I used electricity to set it off,&quot;
he said. &quot;I had the damnedest time. I fastened the cord to
his light circuit, but the son-of-a-bitch hadn't paid his light
bill, and it was turned off. I had to run a wire in from clear
across the street to make it go.&quot;
<P>
The burned-out tobacco man felt the police should take the matter
up with Billy. So did Sig Jacobson, a former associate, who complained
to the authorities that Billy wouldn't pay him for the infernal
machine he had used to start the fire. A detective was sent around
to see Billy, but he came back with the word there was nothing
to it. (It was not impossible to get arrested in Aberdeen at this
time; Mac DeLane, the proprietor of the Pioneer Liquor Store,
who happened to be an enemy of Gohl's, was jailed for smoking
a cigarette on the street.
<P>
Billy could be remarkably persuasive. A man who shot a friend
at Gohl's suggestion told a jury, &quot;Billy looked at me and
said, 'You take him,' and I knew I had to. There wasn't anything
else to do. He had a great deal of animal magnetism.&quot;
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
During one eight-month period while Gohl was active forty-three
bodies were found floating in Grays Harbor. Some had been shot,
some slugged, a few showed evidence of poison, and the majority
appeared simply to have drowned after falling or being pushed
into the water while drunk. These anonymous dead men, culled from
the hordes of migrant laborers who had flocked to Grays Harbor
to cut trees, came to be known as the Floater Fleet.
<P>
Billy Gohl was credited with launching most of them. If he was
responsible for even half of the floaters found in the harbor
during his day, Gohl was America's most prolific murderer. Over
a ten year period the fleet numbered 124.
<P>
Gohl first appeared in Grays Harbor in 1900 one of many men who
drifted in broke from the Yukon. He said he had been born in Austria,
though one police report credited him to Madison, Wisconsin, and
another to Bergen, Norway. He found a job in a waterfront saloon,
where he attracted attention with a tale about eating a man during
a cold snap near Whitehorse.
<P>
He is said to have picked up bonus money by recruiting seamen,
usually unconscious, for misery ships that called at the Wishkah
mills for lumber. A bartender could be most useful when shanghaiing
was necessary to round out a crew. But this story may be libel,
for that is one of the few crimes Billy never boasted of committing,
perhaps because he soon graduated from barkeep to agent for the
Sailors' Union.
<P>
Gohl was an effective agent. Aberdeen became one of the first
ports on the Pacific Coast with a union hiring hall. People seldom
talked back to Billy. Once during a strike, when there were rumors
that a citizens' committee in neighboring Hoquiam was planning
to intervene, Billy strapped on a pair of forty-fives, cradled
a shotgun in his elbow, and boarded each streetcar as it came
in from Hoquiam.
<P>
As he searched the passengers he explained blandly, &quot;to make
sure there ain't nobody going around town illegally armed.&quot;
<P>
In 1905 the captain of the lumber schooner Fearless, which was
tied up in port by a strike, sneaked a non-union crew aboard,
cast off, and headed for the Pacific. A runner bounded up the
steps to the union hall, over the Pioneer Saloon, and reported
the getaway. Billy recruited a boarding party, commandeered a
launch, and put out after her. The seagoing pickets were sighted
as they approached the schooner in the dark.
<P>
Somebody started shooting. The gun battle lasted half an hour
before the Fearless escaped over the bar, which was too rough
for the launch.
<P>
Later Gohl was arrested. The papers said he was charged with piracy,
but actually it was &quot;aggravated assault.&quot; He was fined
twelve hundred dollars. On leaving court be remarked, &quot;It'll
be worth every penny of it, for advertising.
<P>
Gohl seldom missed an opportunity to expand his reputation for
violence. One of his stories was that after the Fearless returned
he sent word to four of the scabs that another non-union boat
was waiting to sail. &quot;After I got them on my boat,&quot;
said Billy, &quot;I took them out to the bar at low tide. I made
them get out on the spit. Then I held a gun on them until the
tide came in.&quot;
<P>
A private detective was hired to check on Billy. He's just trying
to scare people,&quot; the operator reported. &quot;He's all talk.&quot;
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
Gohl's headquarters were in the union hall, a gaunt, narrow room
with flaking yellow wallpaper. A scattering of scarred tables
stood stark under bare light bulbs. There were some rung-sprung
chairs and sturdy splintered benches. One day a friend told Billy
that a rumor was going around town that Billy sometimes killed
sailors who left money with him for safekeeping and then dropped
the bodies through a trap door into the Wishkah.
<P>
&quot;That's silly. There ain't no trap door here,&quot; said
Billy. &quot;And if there was it would just open into the saloon.&quot;
Then he took the man by the arm and led him to the window. &quot;Tell
you what I did do, though. The other day some Swede came in and
gave me some money to hold for him while he hit the crib houses.
I told him something was up. I thought a scab boat was coming
in.
<P>
&quot;I got him to put on a logger's outfit-there was some old
stag pants around-and I told him to go out and sit on those pilings
down there and keep a lookout for the boat. When he got out there
I got my rifle and shot him from here, right through the head.&quot;
<P>
In 1909 there was a shift in political alignment at the city hall.
Billy was arrested for stealing a car robe. He was indignant.
&quot;A auto robe, for Chrissakes!&quot; he said. He was acquitted
when a friend who rustled cattle on the Chehalis River said he
had bought the robe at a pawnshop and given it to Gohl.
<P>
Gohl brooded about the fact of his arrest. Rumor reached him that
the cattle rustler had been seen talking to a deputy sheriff.
It was then that he told the barkeep at the Grand that he would
have to kill the man. When the barkeep mentioned some weeks later
that be hadn't seen Charley around, Gohl told him, &quot;You won't.
He's sleeping off Indian Creek with an anchor for a pillow.&quot;
<P>
A report of this statement reached Montesano, where the sheriff
decided Gohl might not be joking. He waited for a day of low tides
and went to Indian Creek. Not far off shore he found Charles Hatberg's
body, weighed down by a twenty-five pound anchor.
<P>
Gohl was arrested. He denied everything. &quot;It's a frame-up,&quot;
he said, and many believed him. Their confidence was shaken two
months later when the schooner A. J. West returned from a run
to Mexico. Aboard her was a very nervous seaman named John Klingenberg.
He had been seen with Gohl the night Hatberg disappeared. He had
tried to jump ship in Mexico, but the captain, who had received
a telegram from the sheriff, kept him aboard.
<P>
On its return run the schooner was held up two weeks at the Grays
Harbor bar by adverse winds. The delay, said Klingenberg, &quot;left
me in a highly nervous state.&quot; When a sheriff arrested him
at the dock he was anxious to talk.
<P>
Klingenberg said Gohl had asked him to go along to kill Hatberg
so Hatberg couldn't tell anyone what he knew. They had gone to
Indian Creek, where Gohl kept a small schooner. There they met
a man named John Hoffman. Gohl asked Hoffman to go with them to
Hatberg's cabin. After they were on the launch Gohl drew his gun
and shot Hoffman in the back, wounding him. Hoffman begged for
his life.
<P>
Gohl sat on his chest and shot him through the forehead. They
threw his body overboard and went on toward Hatberg's. &quot;He'd
have been in the way,&quot; said Gohl. Near the cabin they ran
on a mud bank. Hatberg came out in a skiff and rowed them ashore.
The three men spent the night in the cabin. Klingenberg said he
didn't sleep much. The next morning Hatberg rowed them out to
the launch. &quot;You take him,&quot; said Gohl to Klingenberg.
And Klingenberg did.
<P>
&quot;But,&quot; he told the deputy, &quot;I didn't shoot him
in the back.&quot; Gohl and Klingenberg went back to Aberdeen
together. A few days later Gohl suggested to Klingenberg that
they go for a walk alone on the beach.
<P>
Klingenberg declined; the next day he shipped out for Mexico.
<P>
When brought to trial for his life, Gohl maintained that Hatberg
and Hoffman were somewhere in Alaska, tending lighthouse. He didn't
know exactly where; didn't have any idea whose body the sheriff
bad found off Indian Creek. The State then brought Hatberg's arm,
which had been pickled, into court so the jurors could examine
some identifying tattoo marks.
<P>
Gohl was sentenced to life. He was later transferred from the
state penitentiary to a hospital for the criminally insane, where
he died in 1928. Klingenberg was sentenced to twenty years in
prison.<HR>

<H2>Financial Flight of the <U>America</U></H2>

<P>
Of all the people England sent to the Pacific Northwest to look
after British interests during the &quot;54-40 or fight&quot;
crisis none was more notable or less effective that Captain the
Honorable John Gordon, who came as commander of the fifty gun
frigate <U>America</U>.
<P>
Later than any U.S. vessel in the Pacific HMS <U>America</U> was
sent to show the Union Jack off the Columbia and on Puget Sound.
Her 1845 visit was pure gunboat diplomacy, calculated to overawe
the Yankees and let British residents in the Oregon Country know
the crown was not abandoning them.
<P>
The Admiralty's choice of Gordon for command raised some eyebrows.
He had joined the Navy in 1805 and attained, thanks to the Napoleonic
wars and the War of 1812, the rank of captain in only eight years.
The pickings were poorer in peace time and he had been without
a deck under his feet for twenty-seven years when given Britain's
largest vessel in the eastern Pacific.
<P>
Some critics thought his assignment was less a mark of ability
than of connections; one of his brothers was a lord commissioner
of the Admiralty, another, the Earl of Aberdeen, was foreign secretary.
<P>
The dispatch of the <U>America</U> did not impress Chief Factor
John McLoughlin at Fort Vancouver. He complained to London that
she was too big to get across the Columbia River bar and would
have to be stationed on the Strait of Juan de Fuca or in Puget
Sound where there were no Americans to be intimidated.
<P>
The Admiralty had noted the at the <U>America</U>'s fifteen foot
draft would prevent her from entering the river. Captain Gordon's
instructions were to proceed to Fort Victoria, the new Hudson's
Bay Company post on Vancouver Island.
<P>
There he was to borrow the steamer Beaver, the only steam vessel
in the Northwest, and send a party to Fort Nisqually, then overland
to Fort Vancouver.
<P>
Gordon was to determine whether coal beds reported in the Puget
Sound-Cowlitz River area would provide suitable fuel for steamships,
check out the supply of timber fit for naval use and load spars
72 feet long 27 inches in diameter to serve as main yards.
<P>
Contrary winds delayed Gordon's arrival at the Strait of Juan
de Fuca two months beyond schedule. Poor charts, strong tides
and late summer fogs prevented him from finding the entrance to
Victoria harbor. Gordon went instead to Port Discovery.
<P>
When a small boat from the <U>America</U> found Victoria the officers
were told that the SS Beaver was up north trading with the Tlingits.
So the inspection party had to go south up the Sound by small
boat rather than steamer.
<P>
This group was led by Lieutenant William Peel, son of the incumbent
prime minister who carried out his assignment brilliantly and
submitted a solid, detailed report on the Oregon Country and its
potential.
<P>
While Peel was on reconnaissance, Gordon visited Fort Victoria.
Chief Factor Roderick Finlayson, a fellow Scot, took him fishing.
The salmon were running, Indians were netting and spearing them
by the hundreds, but Gordon insisted on fly casting. He was skunked.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
&quot;What a country, &quot; Gordon complained, &quot; where the
salmon will not take the fly.&quot; He told Finlayson he would
not trade &quot;one acre of the barren hills of Scotland for all
that he saw around him.&quot;
<P>
Gordon was equally dour in talking to James Douglas, another resident
Hudson's Bay Company official who reported to the company governor
that &quot;The old Gentleman was exceedingly kind, but no wise
enthusiastic about Oregon or British interests. He does not think
the country worth five straws.&quot;
<P>
After five weeks in the Northwest, Gordon was convinced that Puget
Sound and the Oregon Country was of such scant worth that &quot;...the
single Harbour of San Francisco in California with its surrounding
shores is worth the whole of it.&quot;
<P>
He reported to the Admiralty that in his opinion the United States
government was encouraging emigration to the Oregon Country as
a ruse, since newcomers would probably &quot;instantly quite it
for the fertile plains of California, and thus the <U>America</U>n
Government plant their native population in their friendly Neighbor's
territory.&quot;
<P>
Gordon decided to winter in warmer climes. He left Port Discovery
for Hawaii, then visited Mazatlan. Mexico was in turmoil and British
merchants feared their money might be confiscated. They asked
Gordon if he would transport an estimated two million dollars
in specie back to England.
<P>
Under existing British law a commander received a per centage
of money rescued under such circumstances. Gordon agreed, loaded
the gold and silver and sailed home. Thus while the Admiralty
was counting on the <U>America</U>'s presence in the North Pacific
in event of war with the United States, Captain the Honorable
Gordon left his station, in the bitter words of a superior, &quot;without
orders, with money.&quot;
<P>
Gordon was court marshaled. The charge of &quot;...leaving his
station, contrary to orders, &quot; was held to be &quot;full
proved,&quot; and Gordon was &quot;severely reprimanded,&quot;
but not relieved of his command. He resigned a few months later,
taking his cut of the two million, estimated at ten thousand dollars,
into retirement.
<P>
Gordon's money cruise did not effect the boundary settlement.
Britain and the United States had agreed to the 49th parallel
as the dividing line before it was known that the <U>America</U>
was missing from her station.<HR>

<H2>Quiet Leonard Howarth was a giant in Tacoma's finances</H2>

<P>
He was a wistfully shy little fellow with an oversized mustache,
a slight limp from a childhood bout with infantile paralysis and
an accent betraying English birth -- no advantage in a frontier
community. He had been in town less than three years. But a century
ago at the depth of the depression that followed the Panic of
'93, he held much of Tacoma's financial future in his slender
hands.
<P>
His name was Leonard Howarth, a name mentioned around here today
mostly because he donated the money for one of the original buildings
on the present University of Puget Sound campus, Howarth Hall.
<P>
Born in England in 1866, Leonard was an apprentice in a print
shop before coming to America with his brother around 1885. The
Howarth brothers picked Wisconsin as their land of opportunity,
and Leonard caught on as a clerk for Hewitt, Son and Co., a private
bank in Menasha. His attention to detail, his memory and his shrewd
grasp of financial possibility soon caught the eye of Henry Hewitt
Jr., the son in the company's title. 
<P>
Like Leonard, Henry Hewitt Jr. was English born, although he was
only a month old when his family left their Yorkshire farm for
America. Like Leonard, Hewitt had a bad leg, having been severely
wounded when he tripped the wire on a spring-gun while timber
cruising north of Green Bay. Unlike Leonard, he was anything but
unassertive. He was said to have acquired more pine forest land
than anyone in the world except the czar of Russia. Young Henry
made Leonard his private secretary. 
<P>
In 1888 Hewitt joined his brother-in-law, Charles Hebard Jones,
and partners Chauncey Griggs and Addison Foster of St. Paul to
form the St. Paul and Tacoma Lumber Co. They bought 80,000 acres
of prime timberland in Pierce County from the vast holdings the
Northern Pacific Co. received from the public domain as a reward
for building the transcontinental railroad. St. Paul and Tacoma
set out to build the &quot;world's largest sawmill&quot; on the
Tacoma tideflats.
<P>
Leonard followed his boss to Tacoma in 1891. On arrival he wrote
to his brother, William, from the Tacoma Hotel, marveling at the
forested hills stretching back to the mountains -- and at the
opportunities offered by the booming town.
<P>
The partners in St. Paul &amp; Tacoma were investing all around
Puget Sound. The company itself bought half-interest in the Wilkeson
Coal and Coke Co. Griggs was a major backer of the Tacoma Smelting
and Refining Co., which took over Dennis Ryan's under-financed
smelter. Griggs also joined the group that bought a floating dry
dock at Port Townsend and brought it to Quartermaster Harbor on
Vashon Island. 
<P>
All the partners bought stock in Traders' Bank, which had been
organized by Henry A. Strong shortly before he returned to his
native Rochester, N.Y., to run his new company, Eastman Kodak.
Traders prospered and in October of 1892 reported deposits of
$950,000. Then Came the crash.
<P>
On June 1, Merchants National Bank closed its doors, the first
of 17 Tacoma banks to disappear during the depression. That month,
for the first time ever, St. Paul &amp; Tacoma received no new
orders for lumber. Traders' suffered no concentrated run on its
deposits but withdrawals were steady. By July 20 deposits totaled
only $170,000 -- 18 per cent of what they had been eight months
earlier. Traders' closed its doors. Addison Foster was appointed
receiver.
<P>
Hewitt, Griggs, Strong and other directors personally pledged
that every depositor and creditor would be repaid every penny.
By pledging securities valued at $200,000, they were able to borrow
$50,000. In January, betting that the depression would ease, they
reopened the bank. Times got worse. Again Traders went into receivership.
This time the judge appointed 28-year-old Leonard Howarth as receiver.
He also became receiver for the Puget Sound Dry Dock Co. and the
Pacific Meat Co.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>
Writing to a banker friend back east, St. Paul &amp; Tacoma's
president Griggs pointed up the seriousness of the situation,
not just for the bank but for the region: &quot;So long as the
moneyed men of our country have not full confidence that the public
and the business community intend to pay one hundred cents on
the dollar, there is no doubt in my mind that we will be unable
to obtain eastern funds in our western country for investment.&quot;

<P>
Working with characteristic quietness with Griggs and the other
St. Paul &amp; Tacoma investors, Howarth was able to see that
all debts were honored. Traders' did not reopen, Hewitt having
decided &quot;There is no use running a business for the mere
purpose of making ends meet.&quot; But all depositors and creditors
got their money. The Pacific Meat Co. became Carsten Brothers.
The dry dock at Quartermaster Harbor returned to profitable operation,
then was sold to Manson Brothers and towed to Seattle.
<P>
With the termination of his receiverships, Howarth went quietly
back to making money for himself. He became a vice president of
the St. Paul &amp; Tacoma Lumber Co. and vice president, as well
as largest stockholder, in the Wilkeson Coal and Coke Co. With
his brother, William, he owned the Everett Pulp and Paper Co.
<P>
In 1927, for better or worse, he played a key role in St. Paul
&amp; Tacoma's decision to sell Union Bag and Paper of New York
the land on the tideflats for a pulp mill. He did not live to
smell it.
<P>
Howarth died on May 12, 1930. He had never married and left most
of his $10,000,000 estate to nieces and nephews. There was, however,
a bequest of $150,000 for the City of Tacoma &quot;to be used
as city officers see fit.&quot; It would be interesting to learn
what it was used for.<HR>

<H2><A NAME="topofpage"></A>Non-Resident Fees for a Tacoma Public
Library Card</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
America's tax-supported public libraries are unique and are the
envy of much of the rest of the world. Access to information,
education, entertainment and culture for every citizen is virtually
unheard of in most other countries.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Currently, the citizens of Tacoma invest over $7,500,000 each
year through taxes to provide themselves and their families with
exceptional library services through nine branches and a Main
Library. No funds are received from the County, State or Federal
government to support the Tacoma Public Library. Residents of
the city of Tacoma are entitled to receive a free library card
because of their tax support. Non-residents are charged a reasonable
fee for a Tacoma Public Library card and the privileges which
accompany it. As stewards of the services paid for by city taxpayers,
we cannot provide free services to people who have not paid for
them.

</H4>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME="whatitcosts"></A>Setting the Fee For Non-Residents.
</H4>

<P>
The theory of tax-supported services is simple. Services that
are too important to leave to chance are paid through taxes. People
pay whether they use the service or not because having the service
available benefits the entire community. Spreading the costs over
a broad community base keeps the costs low for everyone.
<P>
Non-resident fees for library services are based on how much the
average taxpayer pays to support the library. The current cost
of library service is $43.00 per year. Alternately, non-residents
may purchase six months of library service for $21.50. While you
may always use most resources of the Tacoma Public Library without
a valid library card, you will not be allowed to check-out library
materials or utilize the Computer Lab, InterLibrary Loan, or on-line
searching.
<P>
Some municipalities adjacent to Tacoma rebate all or part of the
cost of a Tacoma Public Library card to their residents. Please
check with your local municipal office to see if they participate
in this program. Remember, too, that you are probably already
paying for library services if you are a resident of King County
or of Pierce County (but living outside the limits of the City
of Tacoma). If so, you are already entitled to free use of either
of these libraries.<HR>

<H4><A NAME="Whatyouget"></A>What You Get For Your Money.</H4>

<P>
Upon payment of a non-resident fee, you have full use of:
<UL>
<LI>987,000 books
<LI>23,116 audio cassettes
<LI>2,451 different magazine and newspaper subscriptions
<LI>13,029 compact discs
<LI>12,440 video cassettes
<LI>4,086 books cassettes
<LI>14,359 large print books
</UL>

<P>
Forty-three dollars may seem like a lot of money, but some comparisons
may help put it in perspective. The average cost of a book is
$33.57. A one-year subscription to Time magazine is $61.88. An
evening out for a family of four at a fast food restaurant and
the movies costs at least $60. A Tacoma Public Library card costs
only 11 cents per day.
<P>
When put into perspective, $43.00 for a Tacoma Public Library
card for a year is an incredible bargain.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME="kingcounty"></A>King County residents</H4>

<P>
The Tacoma Public Library has a reciprocal agreement with the
King County Library System. What this means is that all residents
of the City of Tacoma who have a Tacoma Public Library card are
entitled to a free card from the King County Library System. This
also means most (but not all) residents of unincorporated King
County are entitled to a free library card from the Tacoma Public
Library.
<H5>Who's excluded</H5>

<UL>
<LI>Residents of cities and other library districts (includiong
Pierce County) who have reciprocal agreements with the King County
Library District.

of the River <BR>
</I>and the recipient of the <I>1995 Murray Morgan Prize</I></H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Thompson was the first person to chart the entire length
of the Columbia River, he also explored its source lakes and the
nest of tributaries that wind through the area we now call the
Inland Northwest. As he traveled he carried a compass, a sextant,
and a business proposition for the native tribes he met. For Thompson
was not just a geographer out to map a river, he was also a fur
trader with the North West Company of Montreal, out to expand
its domain and convert the natives to its commercial purposes.
He was an agent of revolutionary change in the region: its history
turns on the moment of his arrival.&quot;</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Jack Nisbet,</B> <I>Sources of the River</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Author and naturalist <B>Jack Nisbet</B> has done for the Inland
Northwest what Pete Fromm did for the Bitterroot Mountains and
Donald Hall for New Hampshire: he has illuminated the human and
natural history of a distinct region, that not only roots a place
but connects it to a larger span of time and community. Jack Nisbet,
author of <I>Sources of the River</I> and the first recipient
of the Tacoma Public Library's Murray Morgan Prize, is a field
biologist and natural history teacher. A native of North Carolina
and a graduate of Stanford University, he has lived for more than
fifteen years in the Inland Northwest. Nisbet first began writing
about the Inland Northwest in a newspaper column for the <I>Chewelah
Independent</I> in the mid-seventies. He is the author of <I>Sky
People</I> (1984), a collection of stories based around the highlands
of eastern Washington, and the forthcoming <I>Purple Flat Top:
In Pursuit of a Place</I>, a collection of <I>'carefully crafted
narratives about resilient people intertwined with remarkable
natural history.'</I> Nisbet first became acquainted with David
Thompson in the 1970s when he discovered Thompson's <I>Narrative</I>;
he has been following the explorer's trail ever since. He now
lives in Spokane with his wife and two children.
<P>
<I>Sources of the River, Tracking David Thompson Across Western
North America</I> is an absorbing account of the life and times
of David Thompson, an eighteenth century fur trader, explorer,
surveyor, and mapmaker who discovered the Columbia River's headwaters
and opened up much of the Northwest for trade. The book is a remarkable
story of two men - exploring and defining the western territory
almost two hundred years apart - a captivating blend of wilderness
adventure, natural history, and cultural discovery.
<P>
<I>Sources of the River </I>was published in 1995 by Sasquatch
Books, Seattle, won the 1995 Washington Governor's Writers Award
and was named Idaho Book of the Year.

<H3><A NAME="morgan"></A>About Murray Morgan</H3>

<P>
Murray Morgan is truly one of the Pacific Northwest's (if not
the nation's) most valuable resources. Morgan's work has guided
three generations of readers to a deeper understanding of who,
what and where we are through a remarkable series of journeys
of exploration and discovery of our region's history. As a teacher
he has inspired others to view the possibilities of the present
through the perspectives provided by the past. Born and raised
in Tacoma, Morgan is the son of a Unitarian minister who published
a small Christian magazine with world-wide circulation. His mother
wrote children's plays and poetry. A graduate of Stadium High
and the University of Washington, Morgan worked on both schools'
newspapers, and was hired on by <I>The Grays Harbor Washingtonian</I>
in Hoquiam immediately after he completed college. Two years later,
he married his childhood sweetheart, Rosa, and together they kayaked
down the Danube for their honeymoon, sending regular accounts
of their adventures to <I>The Tacoma News Tribune</I>.
<P>
Morgan earned his Masters degree in Journalism from Columbia University
and his career took flight. In addition to writing for <I>CBS,
Time,</I> and the<I> New York Herald Tribune</I> simultaneously,
Morgan earned the <I>Pulitzer Fellowship</I> for Outstanding Student,
providing him the opportunity to study the press in his country
of choice - Mexico. His year of study ended by being called into
the army. Morgan was stationed in the Aleutian Islands where he
wrote his first two books; <I>Day of the Dead</I>, a mystery set
in Mexico, and<I> A Bridge to Russia</I>, a history of the Aleutians.
<P>
Murray and Rosa returned to the Northwest - the place they would
always call home- in the late 1940s. Their daughter, Lane, was
born shortly thereafter and Morgan began teaching journalism at
what was then the College of Puget Sound. During his five years
with the college, Morgan produced his worst and best selling books.
<I>The Viewless Winds</I> sold 242 copies. <I>Skid Road</I>, a
history of Seattle through the 1930s, sold many times that amount.
<P>
Over the next 30 years Morgan's career blossomed. He wrote<I><B>
</B>The Dam</I> and <I>The Last Wilderness</I> in the mid 1950s
before traveling to 22 countries researching <I>Doctors of the
World</I>, a history of the World Health Organization. During
the 1960s he produced another four books -<I><B> </B>Northwest
Corner, Century 21, The Hospital Women Built for Children</I>,
and <I>One Man's Gold Rush<B> </B></I>- before resuming his teaching
career at Tacoma Community College.
<P>
In the 1980s he has authored and co-authored many books, including
<I>Puget's Sound</I> and <I>South on the Sound</I>, as well
as books on the Pike Place Market, the St Paul and Tacoma Lumber Company,
and the Northwest sea otter fur trade.

<H3>About Tacoma<A NAME="Tacoma"></A></H3>

<P>
Tacoma, an inland coastal town, is situated in the heart of what
one early northwest explorer called, &quot;the land of the sea
in the forest.&quot; First settled in 1862, the city is surrounded
by the beautiful waters of Puget Sound, the fertile farmlands
of the Puyallup River delta, snow-capped mountains and primeval
forests. Tacoma has the sixth busiest port in the U.S., the military
communities of Fort Lewis Army Post and McChord Air Force Base,
a center for high-technology industries and extensive trade relationships
with Pacific Rim countries.
<P>
A variety of recreation facilities are available in the Puget
Sound area. City park facilities include areas for bicycling,
jogging, tennis, soccer, basketball, baseball and boating. The
700 acre Point Defiance Park, one of the nation's largest urban
parks, features a variety of gardens and hiking trails and is
home to the city's zoo and aquarium. Within short driving distances
from Tacoma are excellent ski facilities, ocean beaches and lush
rain forests. Puget Sound waters offer sports fishing, sailing,
water skiing and swimming.
<P>
The community enjoys professional theater and dance companies,
classical and contemporary musical events including a resident
symphony orchestra, chamber orchestra and opera company, numerous
community theaters, art galleries, art and historical museums,
and an AAA baseball team. The city is served by excellent public
and private educational facilities, including two private universities,
the Tacoma campus of the University of Washington, three community
colleges, and numerous trade and business schools. Only 27 miles
from Seattle, Tacoma is close enough to enjoy all the advantages
of this major metropolitan area.
<P>
Given Tacoma's location and climate, housing and living costs
are below the national average. The city is comprised of unique
neighborhoods with turn of the century homes; suburbs with stunning
water and mountain views; waterfront residences, and secluded,
wooded rural communities within easy commuting distance to the
heart of the city. The region is consistently rated as one of
the best places in the United States in which to live and raise
a family.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<H3>About the Tacoma Public Library<A NAME="Library"></A></H3>

<P>
As one of the most important community institutions in the city,
the Tacoma Public Library plays a significant role in the quality
of life in Tacoma, the state's third largest city.
<P>
The city's 90.000 square foot downtown Main Library, renovated
and enlarged in 1991, includes the first Carnegie Library built
in the state. The 1903 library is now home to the Library's Special
Collections, community meeting rooms and the Thomas Handforth
Art Gallery. Nine branch libraries - eight of which were renovated
and enlarged through a $15.8 million Library Construction Bond
passed in 1984 - are scattered throughout the city's thriving
neighborhoods and include two large regional branch libraries.
<P>
The Library has a collection of 1.14 million items (not including
government documents); and in 1995 had a circulation of 2.493
million items (approximately 14.8 circulations per capita - the
highest in the state). The Library is fully automated with OPAC,
Internet access and many networked databases. The Tacoma Public
Library has a record of exceptional fiscal support and customer
usage.
<P>
The Tacoma Public Library is governed by an appointed 5-member
Board of Trustees , and 95% of the organization's funding comes
from budget allocations made by the Tacoma City Council from the
City of Tacoma's General Fund. The current (1995-96) biennial
operating budget is $16,734,933. Employees, except for five administrative
positions, belong to one of three separate bargaining units: two
AFSCME (American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees)
units, and one Teamsters unit.
<P>
The Tacoma Public Library has long been recognized as a national
leader in the utilization of new technology in the delivery of
library services. The Library is currently working cooperatively
with Data Research Associates (DRA) in the co-development of a
new state-of-the-art computerized circulation control system.
<P>
A snapshot of the Tacoma Public Library in 1995 - 1996 would reveal:

</I>Get ready for the Tacoma Public Library's <BR>
1996 Summer Reading Club!</H3>

<P>
<IMG SRC="inline.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>The ability to read is the basic stepping stone that insures
success in school and in the workplace. The Library's annual summer
reading program provides an important opportunity for young students
to continue to develop and maintain critical reading and comprehension
skills throughout the long summer months when they are not in
school. The annual summer reading program is the most important
thing we do at the Tacoma Public Library! <BR>

<BR>
<A HREF="../../index.htm">Return to Tacoma Public Library's HomePage</H4></a>
<HR>

<H4>How the Summer Reading Club Works. </H4>

<P>
You earn points (based on the number of pages) for every book
you read. The more books you read, the more points you earn. The
more points you earn, the more prizes you get. What could be easier
than that?
<P>
As a member of the club, you're expected to read at your own level.
All the books you report on must be checked out from the Tacoma
Public Library. While you can check out the books from any of
our ten locations, you can only report on books at the branch
library where you signed up to join the club.
<P>
There are lots of interesting books in the library, so the 'informal'
books - comic books, 'choose your own ending' books, cartoon books
and books that come with records or cassettes don't count. That
doesn't mean you can't read them, you just can't report on them
to earn points.
<P>
The rest is pretty simple. The first time you report you will
receive a colorful name tag that will help us (and you) keep track
of your reading. You can only make one report each day (although
there is no limit on the number of book on which you can report)
and all the books you are reporting on must be brought in and
shown to the library staff/volunteer.
<P>
Sometimes, when the library gets really busy, there may be lots
of kids waiting to report. If you can't wait, have your mom and
dad (or guardian) complete and sign a Summer Reading Club Reporting
Form. These forms are available at the SRC Reporting Desk. Return
the form to a library staff member (or volunteer) along with the
books you- listed on the form. That way, you'll get credit for
all the books you read. If you've read enough to earn a prize,
you'll want to report in person (or wait until next time to pick
up the prize).<A NAME="dates"></A> 
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<H4>Club dates</H4>

<P>
You can start reporting on Saturday, June 15, 1996.
<P>
The last day to report is Saturday, August 17, 1996.<A NAME="points"></A>
<HR>

<H4>Earning prizes</H4>

<P>
Now, the neat stuff about prizes. You receive points for the books
you read as follows:
<P>
All books marked ----- CJ -- 1 point
<P>
Up to 99 pages ----- 2 points
<P>
100 - 149 pages ------ 3 points
<P>
150 - 199 pages ------ 4 points
<P>
200 - 299 pages ----- 5 points
<P>
300 (or more) pages ----- 6 points
<P>
The more points you earn, the more prizes you earn.<A NAME="prizes"></A>

<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<H4>1996 Prizes</H4>

<P>
This year we have terrific prizes, including:
<P>
5 points ------- A Get a clue. Read! button
<P>
10 points ------ A personal pan pizza from Godfather's Pizza
<P>
25 points ------ A rainbow pen
<P>
50 points ------ Super sports bottle
<P>
75 points ----- A slick slinky
<P>
100 points ----- An invitation to the Mayor's Award Ceremony and
a free book
<P>
125 points ----- One child &amp; one adult ticket to the <B>Point
Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium</B>, &amp; <B>Dinamation's Dig Those
Dinosaurs</B> exhibit!
<P>
150 points ----- Mayor's Award with Honor! And a Get a Clue. Read
baseball cap!<HR>

<P>
The Tacoma Public Library's Summer Reading Program is made possible
through funds raised during the Library's annual Monster Book
Sale.. All donations of used books are welcome and you can donate
books at any branch library.
<P>
The Tacoma Public Library reserves the right to substitute prizes
of an equal or greater value if necessary.
<P>
If you have any questions, call the Library's Community Relations
Office at (206) 591-5688.

<H4>Fines For Overdue Materials</H4>

<P>
The fine for most overdue items is 20 cents per day, up to a maximum
of $10.00 per item. Fines for videos are $2.00 per day, up to
a maximum of $10.00 per item. Fines accrue each day an item is
overdue, including Sundays, holidays and days on which the library
is closed. The Tacoma Public Library will send only one overdue
notice before billing a patron for an item that has not been returned.
The overdue notices are mailed on or about the 15th of each month.
<P>
<A HREF="overdue.htm">Beating the Overdue Book Blues!</A> 
<H4><A NAME="renew"></A>Renewing Materials</H4>

<P>
Most Library materials may be renewed once, as long as another
patron has not placed a reserve on the item(s). However, video
cassettes cannot be renewed.
<P>
Library patrons are permitted to renew items in person or by telephone.
Some patrons find it helpful to call before they come to the library
to renew those items they wish to keep. When you renew an item
by telephone, you do not have to bring the item to the library.
When you telephone to renew an item, please be prepared to tell
us your library card number, name and address. Once this information
has been verified, you will be asked to tell library staff the
due dates (this is fastest), titles, or material type of the items
you wish to renew. Library staff will renew the items, if possible,
tell you the new due dates, and tell you if they are unable to
renew any of the items.
<P>
Staff will not be able to renew items that have been previously
renewed, or any items that have been requested by another patron.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<H4>Returning Video Tapes</H4>

<P>
Video tapes must be returned to the same branch from which they
were borrowed. Video tapes returned to a branch library other
than the one from which the tapes were borrowed will accumulate
fines until such time as the video tapes reach the original branch.
<H4><A NAME="replace"></A>Replacement Charges</H4>

<P>
After six weeks, the Library sends the patron a bill for the replacement
costs and overdue fines for items not yet returned. When items
become sixteen weeks overdue, the account may be referred to a
collection agency.
<P>
Patrons will be charged for the full replacement costs of items
that are not returned or that are returned in unusable condition.
<H4><A NAME="damage"></A>Damage Charges</H4>

<P>
Patrons are liable for damage to any items that are not properly
returned, for items that are returned in a damaged condition,
and for items that are returned with parts missing.
<P>
Patrons will be charged a nominal replacement fee for video cases,
cassette and compact disc cases, plastic bags for children's materials,
and any other such items which are not returned with the materials
they accompanied at the time the items were checked-out.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="lose"></A>Losing Borrowing Privileges</h4>
When a library patron has fines and fees exceeding $4.99, the
patron shall lose all borrowing privileges.
<P>
The following should not be placed in book drops as they are easily
damaged: audio cassettes, records, compact discs, puppets, and
slides. Please return these directly to the circulation desk.

<CITE>It's Saturday afternoon and the neighborhood mailman just
filled your mailbox with letters, the latest issue of your favorite
magazine, a new catalog (yeah!), a postcard and - YIKES - overdue
notices from the library (sigh). You quickly add up the damage
- 7 compact discs from that terrifically long weekend last month...3
bestsellers you took with you on vacation way back when...the
six books you checked out for your son's September school report.

<UL>
<LI>Keep a library list on your refrigerator door, listing all
the books check out during your last library visit and the date
they are all due.
<LI>Create a special place in your home just for library materials,
ideally someplace where you can't help but see them every day.
When you finish with a book, return it to that spot. When it's
time for your next trip to the library, all your materials will
be in one place.
<LI>Keep a special library card for each child on his or her bedroom
door. List the books checked out, and their due date. Check or
cross out books that are returned. This makes a great reading
log for your child, too.
<LI>The next time you visit the library, request a print-out of
all the library books and other materials checked out on your
card. Library staff are always willing to provide print outs of
your records if the check out desk isn't too busy. You could even
call ahead a day or two and have one waiting for you!
<LI>Don't forget, if you can't make a visit to the library, you
can always renew your books over the telephone.
<LI>Library fines do not have to be an inevitable fact of life.
They can be easily avoided with a little planning. Try it sometimes
and beat the overdue book blues.

<H2>The Tacoma Public Library and Confidentiality. </H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CITE>The confidentiality of your library records is protected
by law and by the administrative policies of the Tacoma Public
Library. Library policies concerning confidentiality safeguard
your rights to free speech and privacy. Our administrative policies
are designed to prevent anyone from finding out what library materials
you may be using. For example, these policies prevent a teacher
from discovering what books his or her pupils are reading, they
prevent a spouse from finding out if his or her partner is checking
out books on divorce, child custody or other volatile issues,
and they protect library records from inquiries by local, state
and federal authorities.</CITE>

</H4>
<HR>

<H4>How am I affected by this policy?</H4>

<P>
Because the Library is unable to verify with certainty the identity
of a person who telephones for assistance, our administrative
policies restrict the type of information that library staff may
provide you by telephone. In addition, the Library's interest
in protecting the confidentiality of patron records restricts
the type of information which staff may provide if you come to
the library with a card belonging to a friend or family member.
<P>
In the case of group cards (family, tax or agency cards) which
are designed to be used by more than one person, the Library assumes
that the person presenting the card is authorized to use it and
circulation information will be released to the bearer.
<H4>Some examples:<A NAME="telephone"></A></H4>

<P>
When renewing library materials by telephone, whether for yourself
or for a friend or family member, you must provide us with the
library card number, and with the full name and address of the
card owner. Library staff will match and verify this information
against the patron's library record.
<P>
Library staff may renew items by telephone if you provide them
with a title or a due date. While they are able to tell you the
number and type of overdue items and the amount of any fines,
they are restricted from giving you the specific information about
materials related to fines. They are also restricted from telling
you during a telephone conversation specifically which titles
need to be renewed, even if you are the owner of the card.

<P>
<h4><A NAME="notyourcard"></A>Using a friend's card</h4>
When you come to the library in person and present a library card
belonging to a friend or family member, you may check out materials
(except videos), and you may pay fines on that card. However,
library staff cannot provide you with information about any library
materials that may already be checked out on that card. At your
request, the information will be mailed to the name and address
listed on the library record. Additionally, Library policy prohibits
the bearer of another patron's card from using the resources of
the Computer Lab at the Main Library.
<P>
When you come to the library in person and present your own library
card, library staff will answer any questions you may have about
your record. However, they may ask you questions to verify that
you are the owner of the card you present, and, occasionally,
staff may ask you to present photo identification.
<P>
Upon your request and with presentation of your library card and/or
photo identification, library staff will provide you with a print-out
of library materials you currently have checked out, and/or any
fines on your record.
<H4><A NAME="children"></A>Can I receive information about my
children's circulation records?</H4>

<P>
The library record of a child has the same confidentiality protection
under Library policy as that of any other patron. However, because
the Tacoma Public Library understands that instances may arise
when it is necessary for a parent or legal guardian to be provided
with information about their child's library record (for example,
when a child has a fine, or when a child has misplaced library
materials) there are procedures that will enable parents to obtain
information about a minor child's records.
<P>
In all instances and regardless of circumstances, it is the policy
of the Tacoma Public Library to safeguard access to patron library
records and restrict access to that information only to the patron
who owns the library card or to the parent / legal guardian of
a minor. To help us ensure the confidentiality of library records,
please keep your library card in a secure place. If your card
is lost or stolen, please report the loss immediately to any branch
of the Tacoma Public Library.

<H2>Questions &amp; Answers About InterLibrary Loans</H2>

<H2><A NAME="definition"></A>What is InterLibrary Loan?</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CITE>InterLibrary Loan is a service through which one library
system lends its materials to another library system. If a Tacoma
Public Library patron needs a book or a magazine article that
is unavailable in our collection, the patron may request an InterLibrary
Loan. The Library will then search for the item in various databases
to locate another library system which owns the item and is willing
to lend the item to the Tacoma Public Library.</CITE>

<H4><A NAME="request"></A>How do I request an InterLibrary Loan?
</H4>

<P>
InterLibrary Loan Request Forms are available at all branch libraries
and at the downtown Main Library. The form is very simple to fill-out,
and must be completed prior to Library staff initiating an InterLibrary
search. Federal copyright restrictions do not allow Library employees
to complete the InterLibrary Loan form for patrons. InterLibrary
Loan requests cannot be taken over the telephone.
<P>
A person must have a valid Tacoma Public Library card to request
materials through InterLibrary Loan.
<H4><A NAME="whatget"></A>What can I request on InterLibrary Loan?
</H4>

<P>
The Tacoma Public Library can process InterLibrary Loan requests
for books and other print materials, magazine articles, microfilm
and microfiche. Media items - such as audio cassettes, compact
discs, records, video recordings and computer software - are not
available through InterLibrary Loan.
<P>
An InterLibrary Loan request can not be processed for books published
during the current calendar year.. A patron should complete a
Book Request Purchase Form for any current book that the Library
does not own.
<H4><A NAME="longtake"></A>How long does an InterLibrary Loan
take?</H4>

<P>
On average, it takes four to six weeks to process and receive
an InterLibrary Loan item. The request may take even longer depending
on the type of the request and the location of the lending library.
<H4><A HREF="#topofpage">Return to top of page</A></H4>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME="checkout"></A>How long is the check-out period?</H4>

<P>
The check-out period for an item received on InterLibrary Loan
can vary greatly, depending on the conditions set by the lending
library. The Tacoma Public Library must comply with these conditions.
The check-out period is usually much shorter than the standard
four-week check-out available with items held by the Tacoma Public
Library. InterLibrary Loan materials are not renewable.
<P>
Some items received on InterLibrary Loan come with a restriction
for 'Library Use Only'. In such an instance, the item cannot be
checked-out but must be used only within the Library. This restriction
is identical to reference materials and microform items already
held by the Tacoma Public Library.
<H4><A NAME="cost"></A>Are there any costs associated with ILL?
</H4>

<P>
There is no charge to a patron for processing, receiving and returning
an InterLibrary Loan. The cost to obtain the item is paid by the
Tacoma Public Library.
<P>
The fine for an overdue InterLibrary Loan item is 20 cents per
day, up to a maximum of $10.00 per item.
<P>
The replacement charges for an InterLibrary Loan item is $50.00.
Patrons will be charged for all InterLibrary Loan items that are
not returned or that are returned in unusable condition.
<P>
Patrons are liable for any InterLibrary Loan items that are returned
in a damaged condition , and for items that are returned with
parts missing.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Black Peppercorn Steak</H2>				

<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT> have returned from France and have some wonderful things for you. 
I've modified some French recipes to fit your lifestyle. Using healthier cooking methods and altering the ingredients a bit, I have brought to you French Cuisine ... almost.</P>








<P><B>3 tablespoons of black peppercorns (or combine black, pink and white)</B></P>





<P><B>4 or 5 steaks of choice, cut to about 3/4 of an inch</B></P>





<P><B>Non-stick cooking spray (butter flavored if possible)</B></P>





<P><B>Salt</B></P>




<P><B>1/2 cup of alcohol (brandy, cognac, wine)</B></P>





<P><B>1/2 to 1 cup of heavy whipping cream</B></P>





<P><B>1 onion</B></P>

<BR>
<BR>




<P><B>Directions:</B></P>





<P>1. Using a hammer or the back side of a pan, crush the peppercorns. Do this just before use to preserve the flavor.</P>





<P>2. Divide the peppercorns evenly between the steaks and press firmly into the flesh. The steaks may be refrigerated overnight this way to infuse flavor.</P>





<P>3. Spray the pan generously with the cooking spray.</P>





<P>4. Add the steaks and onion to the pan and saut&eacute until brown on the first side.  Flip the steak over and repeat. Season with salt and continue to cook until done as desired.</P>





<P>5. Remove steaks and onion rings from the pan and carefully pour off the juices and discard. Place the steaks and onions back in the pan.</P>





<P>6. Return the pan to the burner and add the alcohol and flambe, if desired.*</P>

 



<P>7. Add the cream to the pan and simmer for about five minutes, stirring occasionally.  If the onions are not yet done, remove the steaks from the pan and continue to cook.</P>






<P><B>Serving suggestions:</B></P>





<P>Candied yams, baked potato, caramelized onions, salad</P>





<P>*Flambe means to light the alcohol. This will leave the flavor of the liquid, but remove the alcohol from it. Read up or ask a pro before trying this.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Summer Vegetable Salad</H2>				

<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>H</FONT>ere's another French recipe modified for healthier eating. This one would be wonderful on a summer picnic or a family pitch-in.</P>








<P><B>1 cup of diced carrots</B></P>





<P><B>1 cup of diced celery</B></P>





<P><B>1 cup of shelled peas or lima beans</B></P>





<P><B>1 cup of green beans</B></P>





<P><B>1 cup of yellow pepper</B></P>





<P><B>4 or 5 tablespoons of red or white wine vinegar salad dressing (low-fat or fat-free is best)</B></P>





<P><B>1/2 cup of low-fat or fat-free mayonnaise (Miracle Whip works too)
salt and pepper, if desired</B></P>


<BR>
<BR>



<P><B>Directions:</B></P>





<P>1. Dice the carrots and celery into pieces the size of peas. Shell the peas and discard the shells--unless you want to nibble on them while you are preparing the salad.  Next, break off the head and tail of the beans and break each into 1/2-inch pieces. Peel the pepper, if desired, discard the seeds, and cut into pieces the size of peas.</P>





<P>2. Put the carrot and the celery in cold, salted (about 1/4 teaspoon) water and bring to a boil. Simmer for about 10 minutes or until tender when poked with a fork. Drain and set aside.</P>





<P>3. Boil the peas and green beans in salted (about 1/4 teaspoon) water for about 6 minutes or until they are just tender when poked with a fork. Drain and immediately put them into a tub of cold water (this stops the cooking).  Then drain and set aside.</P>





<P>4. Mix all the vegetables in one bowl with the salad dressing. Set aside to cool before adding the mayonnaise.</P>





<P>5. Stir in just enough of the mayonnaise to lightly bind the salad together.
Refrigerate. The flavor improves as the salad marinates, so make at least 6 hours in advance.</P>





<P>Any number of vegetables can be used according to your taste. Try some of these: beets, potatoes, leeks, turnips, pearl onions, red pepper, green pepper. The object is to keep the salad colorful.</P>

<P><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Jeff Morris</A></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=4>W</FONT>hat's more stressful than seeing all your worldly possessions jammed into cardboard boxes in preparation for a move? Waiting for the cable guy would rank up there, but certainly moving from one home to another has got to be near the top of the list.</P>





<P>This is the mobile generation. Our parents didn't move this often, of course, but they had jobs, not careers. As a result of our constant migrating, moving has become something of a science. </P>





<P>Whether your moving across town or across the planet, here are some stress-reducing tips to prepare you for moving: Sit in a dark corner, assume an upright fetal position, and rock gently while sobbing for your mama. Or you can choose something more practical: 1) Locate a cheap moving company, or 2) trick your friends again.</P>





<P>I went the friend route for my first seven moves. After all, 12 cases of beer, four or five pizzas and you're there, right? And you must never forget The Moving Code of Ethics: Once the party of the first part (you) has been assisted in one move, any and all of the parties of the second part (all your friends) may call upon you to be available for every weekend move over the next two years.</P>





<P>There are many reasonable in-town moving companies that will tote your stuff across town for around $200 or so. Almost as cheap as the buddy system. You pack, move the valuable and breakable stuff, and they do everything else. Just make sure the mover you choose is bonded and insured.</P>





<P>"Bonded and insured basically means we carry the credentials and insurance to cover everything from mysterious disappearances to damaged deliveries. When our people are on the premises, we are responsible for them (the premises)," says Sharon Sugrue, customer satisfaction deptartment, A-Mrazek/United Van Lines.</P>





<P>Also, make sure you go over exactly what you'll need moved with the moving company estimator. <IMG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=179 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="Box1.gif">They may not be able to handle things like hazardous goods or animals.</P>





<P>"We once had a guy who didn't tell us he was moving his pet iguana inside his car, which was then loaded on the truck," says Sugrue. "Iguanas can't adjust to temperature extremes and actually blew up inside the car."
</P>




<P>Of course, nothing's as sweet as having your new employer pay your moving expenses. All you have to do is find a place to live. The movers go to your old place, pack everything, take furniture apart, load the truck, drive the many miles to your new place, unpack the truck, and set up all the furniture. Total cost: $0. Your new company may even pay travel expenses for a visit to find a place to live. Remember to ask for the company's relocation policy in writing.</P>

<BR>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT>f excessive friction can cause severe problems in the office, imagine what it can do to your car's engine parts. You can't change co-workers every 3,000 days, but you can extend the life of your car's engine by replacing the oil every 3,000 miles. Motor oil cleans, cools and lubricates the engine.</P>

<P>"Growing up, my dad always said to keep an eye on your brake fluid and always check your oil," says Cary Cochran, who followed dad's advice and now manages a Q Lube franchise. "You can learn a lot about a car by the condition of the engine, not the outside of the car."</P>

<P>Most manufacturers and mechanics recommend changing your oil every 3,000 miles. "Some owner's manuals say you can go 7,500 miles without an oil change, but that's under 'normal driving conditions' and there's no such thing," says Cochran. "I'd say more than 80 percent of the people who come in here are doing high rpm driving on the interstate in excess of 55 or 65 mph."</P>

<P>Besides its function as a lubricant, motor oil cleans your engine. "There's all kinds of metal shavings and highway grime that can score your piston walls and lower the compression and decrease the life of your engine," says Cochran.</P>

<P>There's almost no excuse not to change your oil. Companies specializing in speedy oil changes have popped up like mushrooms in recent years, and all of them charge roughly the same amount and can get you into a service bay, change your oil and have you back on the street in nothing flat. For around $26, Cochran's employees will:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Replace your old oil with about four and a half quarts of oil 
<LI>Change the oil filter Lube the chassis 
<LI>Check and fill all fluids except coolants 
<LI>Adjust tire pressure Check differential, if applicable 
<LI>Wash the windshield.
</UL>

<P>Cochran says there are important environmental reasons to have your oil changed by professionals. Q Lube and its many competitors recycle old motor oil and some shade- tree mechanics might not. "We dispose of it properly," says Cochran.</P>

<P>Cochran says synthetic oil is better environmentally and it's good for the engine because it doesn't lose its viscosity for a long period of time. However, synthetic oil gets every bit as dirty as conventional motor oil and still needs replacing on a regular basis.</P>

<P>Full-service oil and lube stations also will replace air filters, those plastic-and-paper parts that catch dirt and road dust from entering your engine. Also, attendants at these stations will check your PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) system for clogging.  The PCV valve controls pollution from your vehicle and a clogged valve can be responsible for everything from jerky hesitation to actual stalling. Cochran says his station checks the air filters and PCV systems, advises drivers of their conditions. If the driver wishes them replaced, Cochran will do that for an additional cost. </P>

<P><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Bill Thornbro</A></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>M</FONT>arie's husband died of a sudden heart attack more than 20 years ago. Marie knew she'd never find another man like Stan so she never remarried. She worked hard to put two children through college and never remarried. Marie isn't alone, however; she keeps in touch with Stan's spirit through a medium.</P>





<P>"I thought I might sell the house and get something smaller after the kids moved out," says Marie. "He told me not to. There are so many memories in the house--little things we had--and, you know, I would have lost all that. Stan said hang on to it."</P>





<P>At its most basic level, spiritualism is the belief that the dearly departed exist as spirits. Psychic communication between the living and the spirits is done through mediums, people with clairvoyant abilities who act as local service providers to the nether world. Spiritualism is a religion, true believers insist, and not nearly as dark as some might think. They say just about anybody with an open mind can learn to speak with a spook, gab with a ghost or even pal around with a poltergeist.</P>





<P>"Everyone has a psychic side," says spiritualist Judith Davis. "You may not know it. It happens sometimes on a haphazard basis."</P>





<P>Spiritualism has a rich history.  It became very popular around the Civil War, and pioneers took it to the prairies. "It really caught on with that bunch," says Willis Ward, a clairvoyant and historian. Readings, rappings and seances became common in big cities and small towns throughout the country. Even the Lincolns had more than a passing fascination with communication with the dead. Camp Chesterfield, a community of 75 to 100 spiritualists near Anderson, Ind., is celebrating its 110th year.</P>





<P>With a cathedral, a chapel, two hotels and a bookstore, quaint Camp Chesterfield is internationally famous. "We have people who come from all over the world to attend camp in the summer," says Davis, secretary to the Indiana association of spiritualists.</P>





<P>Followers can attend a "seminary" at the camp. "First you become a medium missionary. Then you advance to associate minister and go on to ordination," says Davis. "Not everyone who attends is interested in certification. Many just want to be educated."</P>





<P>But even the best spiritualists suffer a cloudy crystal ball now and then.</P>





<P>Besides being a clairvoyant, Ward, 70, also is a yoga instructor. Interestingly enough, yoga, the mystic Hindu practice that seeks harmony of mind and body while connecting with the universe through intense meditation and physical postures, can sometimes cloud his clairvoyant abilities. When asked who would win the 1996 presidential race, Ward froze. "Yogis are apolitical," he noted.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=4>H</FONT>ad an absolutely awful job experience you'd like to share? Is your boss so evil you watch  <I>America's Most Wanted</I>  expecting to see his profile? We'd like to hear from you. We're looking for the funny, the outrageous or the just plain ridiculous. Let off some steam and <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">send your stories</A> to us today.</B></P>

<!--IMG  ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="http://www.entermag.com/oct/work/postal/postaltoon.gif">

<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>he worst job I ever had wasn't a real job, it was strictly volunteer. I didn't earn a cent. You could even say the position was dangerous to my health. Three or four times a week I volunteered my services--and my tongue--to the re-election efforts of my local congressman.
</P>

 <P>This was my senior year in college and I was a political science major and very into causes and stuff. Like a lot of volunteers, I truly believed this man had vision and ideas, and I believed our district was well-served with him in Washington. I still do. But there were people on his staff I could have done without. In fact, I wondered if some of them even shared my love for our democratic process. One staffer was an obnoxious know-it-all, a control freak who tried to impress people by shouting orders and running around like a madman. Basically, his only job was to see to it we had phone numbers to call or envelopes to stuff. I'll call him Squiggy.</P>

 <P>Squiggy wouldn't even give us water or sponges to close envelopes. Each flap had to be licked. I learned to keep a large fountain Mountain Dew by my side just to keep my mouth dry, but that only worked so long. After a couple of hours my tongue would feel thick and useless, and simple speech was difficult. Other staff experienced similar results and our conversations were often hilarious.</P>

 <P>"Wad ah ooo doid fo lunge? I cad go to McDoddold's an ged uh cheedbooga."</P>

 <P>"Dad uh good idea. I wand uh Quaduhhpowder."</P>

 <P>It was something like that. Not that old Squiggy would ever know what we sounded like. He never talked to us. He told us what he wanted and we were expected to deliver. In the two months I volunteered at headquarters, he never thanked us for our work or showed any appreciation for the time we put in.</P>

 <P>The congressman stopped by three times during the campaign. Squiggy and other important people managed to get him through the building without stopping by our desks and folding tables. Once, though, the congressman broke free and came over to introduce himself.</P>

 <P>The congressman shook one volunteer's hand and said, "Thanks for your help. We can't win this election without you." The girl's tongue was thick as a brick. She just smiled and nodded her head. "What's your name?" he asked. She stopped smiling, pointed to her face and shook her head. "That's awright, I understand," the congressman said understandingly, and he turned and looked at me. "Thanks for your help, son, "he said. "Keep up the good work." I shook his hand and said, "Thad you, thir. Good lud in Novebber." The congressman took a step back, smiled and left the building quickly.</P>

 <P>I thought Squiggy was going to have a heart attack. The congressman probably believes he lost the election because of the morons at campaign headquarters--and he might be right.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>O</FONT>ctober. Pleasant, cool evenings. Stunning autumn colors. Splashing entrails accented delightfully with blood-curdling shrieks. By far my favorite month of the year, October means Halloween, which, in turn, means Hollywood will once again attempt to oog us out by using the same tired, recycled horrorlines. Let's face it, with few exceptions (like <I>Silence of the Lambs</I>) movies just fail to scare us anymore. Why have we all become so numb to movie frights? Has real life become far more frightening than movies? Or is it the that nothing can be as terrifying as the lack of decent candidates in the upcoming presidential election? Either way, it makes one hunger for the days when movies could make us jump out of our skins.</P>

This masterpiece was the first and, by far, the best of the "splatter films" and it opened the floodgates for hundreds of inferior imitators. A nonstop ride of suspense and shocks, babysitter Jamie Lee Curtis is the next target of Myers, an escaped maniac, who is on a killing spree on Halloween night.</P>





<P>Also by Carpenter: The Fog, Starman, The Thing (1982), Escape From New York </P>


<BR>



<P><B><FONT SIZE=4>C</FONT>lassic Horror</B></P>

 



<P>PYSCHO (1960) Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh 109 min. B&W. Before Michael Myers began dusting babysitters, there was Norman Bates. As the first horror film I ever saw, this Alfred Hitchcock shocker still keeps me away from motel showers. Janet Leigh is a woman on the run who befriends Mama's boy hotel clerk Bates, played by Perkins. What is Norman's sinister secret? Will Leigh's sister, played by Vera Miles, find her? And exactly where is Mrs. Bates? The shower scene is so powerful to this day, many swear they watched Leigh knifed multiple times when the blade never actually touched her skin.
</P>




<P>Also by Hitchcock: Rope, Strangers On A Train, Rear Window, Vertigo, North By Northwest, The Birds.</P>




<BR>



<P><B><FONT SIZE=4>W</FONT>hat In THE Hell?</B></P>





<P>HELLRAISER (1987) Andrew Robinson, Clare Higgins 94 min. Color. Where would horror films be without those famous effects? And none are so famous as the stylings of Pinhead and his following of freaks. Top British horror writer Clive Barker penned and directed this chilling tale of a man trapped between life and death, and how he intends to sacrifice his brother and sister-in-law in order to reclaim his physical body. Bizarre shocker with unforgettable special effects.</P>





<P>Also by Barker: Hellraiser II and Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth, Transmutations, Rawhead Rex, Nightbreed, Candyman.</P>



<BR>




<P><B><FONT SIZE=4>O</FONT>h, They Can Hear You Scream</B></P>





<P>ALIENS (1986) Sigourney Weaver, Paul Reiser 137 min. Color. I know it's sci-fi and not horror, but it stills ranks as one of the scariest movies of all time. One of the few movies where I had to have my fingernails surgically removed from the armrests. In James Cameron's heart-stopping sequel to <I>Alien</I>, Ripley (Weaver) find herself on the way back to the infected alien planet with a battalion of Marines to rescue the colonists that have settled there in the years that Ripley was in suspended animation. Thanks to Reiser, the slimiest of corporate spawn, the marines end up in a battle for their lives. Also stars Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen.</P>





<P>Also by Cameron: Terminator, Terminator II, The Abyss </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

"If a company is big enough to hire people from out of state, they usually expect some kind of relocation expenses," says Steve Loher, human resources manager, The Glennon Company. "Even junior people should be offered a moving allowance to cover most expenses like truck rental. If a company doesn't offer a letter outlining the details of their offer and their relocation policy, I strongly encourage them (the candidate) to ask for it."</P>





<P>Many of the tips below apply more to people moving to a new city with a new job, but can be adapted for in-town moves as well. And while the following checklist doesn't provide for every horror of moving, it should at least give you the basis for making your next move as smooth as possible.</P>





<P><B>Countdown: 6-8 Weeks</B></P>





<P>Arrange for movers or rent a truck. Look for a new home or apartment (Take a tape measure to give you an idea of where your things will fit). Establish credit with your new bank. Set up your auto and renter's insurance. Collect any personal records you'll need for the next few weeks--medical and dental records, insurance, etc. Ask your current doctor, vet, dentist, etc., for references in new city. Transfer club memberships. And give your new address to new employer.</P>





<P>Start collecting boxes (Ask the manager at your local supermarket). Start packing one room per week.
</P>




<P><B>Countdown: 4-6 Weeks</B></P>





<P>Forward mail: You can pick up a card at your local post office. If you plan on staying with friends or family while looking for a new place, make sure you notify the post office of your temporary address or have them hold your mail. Remember, your first-class mail is only forwarded for one year.</P>





<P>Notify magazines. They like the advance notice because subscription are typically only forwarded for 60 days.</P>





<P>Take care of some of this stuff both in the city you're moving from and the city you're moving to. The more you can get done ahead of time, the less time you have to take off of new job. Whatever you do, don't forget utility shut-off dates at your old place and turn- on dates at the new place for electric, gas, water, trash/sewer (if necessary), telephone, and cable TV.</P>





<P>Notify your doctor, dentist, vet, and insurance company. Notify business accounts like the dry cleaner, department stores, banks, finance companies and credit cards. Stop by the public library (and register to vote while you're getting your new library card). Call city hall and ask about pet licenses. Many cities have restrictions on the number of pets you can have. And don't forget the bureau of motor vehicles.</P>





<P>Also notify Social Security, the city and state income tax bureaus and the Internal Revenue Service, the newspaper boy, and book or music clubs. Tell your landlord, parents and friends of the impending move. And now's a good time to start using up things in the refridgerator.</P>





<P>Kill two birds with one stone by having a garage sale. Not only will you get rid of some stuff you don't want to take to your new place, but the extra cash might just cover a good chunk of your moving expenses.</P>





<P><B>Countdown: 2-3 Weeks</B></P>





<P>Give your car a thorough inspection before you move. Change the oil if necessary. Have a party (Why not? It helps to relax you. Just keep it simple). Drain flammables for moving company. Give away your plants (They'll just die from the move). Collect merchandise stored at the dry cleaners or in layaway. Return library books.</P>





<P><B>Countdown: 2-3 Days</B></P>





<P>Pack stuff you'll need in the car. Move any breakables early. Pack clothes. Pack snacks in the car for trips. Pack this stuff for the new place: Cleaning supplies, paper plates/plastic utensils, cooking untensils, toiletries, a hammer, screwdriver, pliers, trash bags, and telephone.</P>





<P>Empty fridge so it can dry. Pack your phone book (It sounds silly, but you'd be surprised how often you'll need to contact a company or person in your old city).</P>





<P><B>Countdown: Day Before</B></P>





<P>Disassemble anything you can. Unplug TVs, VCRs, computers, etc. (Electronics that are still hot can sustain damage from a move). Empty waterbeds. Check every room again, look in closets, drawers, etc.</P>





<P><B>Moving Day</B></P>





<P>Check maps.  Leave phone numbers. Shut the water off. Shut the furnace and air conditioning off. Shut lights off. Lock windows and doors. Leave your old house keys and garage door openers. </P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><B>Apple Rosemary Pork with Broiled Tomatoes and Buttered Orzo:</B></H2><BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>For the pork: 2 1-inch pork chops (bone in)</P>

<P>1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped</P>

<P>1 Granny Smith apple cored, peeled and chopped</P>

<P>1/2 cup chicken broth</P>

<P>1/2 cup apple juice</P>

<P>For the tomatoes: 1 large, red tomato</P>

<P>2 tablespoons light brown sugar (white will work too)</P>

<P>1/2 teaspoon dried or 1 teaspoon fresh basil</P>

<P>For the orzo: 1 cup of orzo (orzo is pasta shaped like grains of rice)<

butter, salt and pepper:</B></P>

<BR>
<BR>



<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>Directions</B></P></FONT>


<P>1. Combine broth, juice and rosemary in a shallow dish. Add pork and turn to coat. Refrigerate for about 20 minutes. Prepare the ingredients for the others, but do not cook them yet.</P>





<P>2. Measure out the orzo and set aside.</P>





<P>3. Core the tomato and slice it crosswise into halves. Set each half, cut side up, on an oven-proof dish. Top each with 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. Set aside.</P>





<P>4. Place chops on the rack of a roasting pan and place the rack in the pan. Place in an oven set at 375 degrees F. for about 20 minutes.</P>





<P>5. After the 20 minutes is up, baste the chops with the remaining marinade. Return to the oven at 400 degrees F. for about 20 more minutes.</P>





<P>6. Put the rest of the marinade in a sauce pan or skillet and add the apples. Cook on medium heat until the apples are tender. Set aside.</P>



7. At 10 minutes, cook the orzo according to the directions and season 

<P>with butter, salt and pepper. Keep in a warm spot.</P>





<P>8. Pull the chops out of the oven, making sure that they are completely cooked and not raw, and set them aside for the moment.</P>





<P>9. Turn on the broiler in your oven, put the tomatoes in (low in the oven) and remove only when the sugar is melted and golden brown. Top with 1 teaspoon of butter and chopped basil.</P>





<P>10. Serve by placing the orzo on one side of the plate and nestling the tomato half into it (this keeps the tomato from sliding around). Then put the pork chop on the plate and top with the hot apple marinade.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Grilled Honey Mustard Chicken with Sauteed Zucchini and Herbed New Potatoes</H2>				

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Ingredients for chicken</B></FONT>


<P><B>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, halved</B></P>




<P><B>1/4 cup yellow mustard</B></P>




<P><B>1/4 cup honey</B></P>

<BR>
<BR>


<FONT SIZE=4>

<P><B>Ingredients for zucchini</B></P>

</FONT>


<P><B>1 small zucchini or yellow squash</B></P>




<P><B>1 tablespoon butter
salt</B></P>




<P><B>pepper</B></P>


<BR>
<BR>



<P><B><FONT SIZE=4>Ingredients for potatoes</FONT></B></P>




<P><B>8 new potatoes, skins on</B></P>




<P><B>1 tablespoon butter</B></P>




<P><B>garlic salt</B></P>




<P><B>pepper</B></P>

<BR>
<BR>



<P><B><FONT SIZE=4>Directions:</FONT></B></P>



<P>Before doing anything else, fire up the grill (either gas or charcoal). </P>





<P>1. Remove any visible fat from the chicken breasts. Separate each breast
in half. This will give you four smaller pieces. Set aside for the
moment.</P>





<P>2. Combine the honey and the mustard. Generously baste the chicken with
the mixture and set aside again. This step may be done the night before in
order to let the chicken marinate in the sauce, but make sure to put it in
the refrigerator for the night.</P>





<P>3. Once the grill is hot enough, put the chicken on and cover the grill.
Keep a close eye on the chicken...you want to cook it, not burn it.</P>





<P>4. Fill a pot with enough water to generously cover the potatoes when they
are in it. Put the pot on the burner and leave to boil. When the water
boils, turn the heat down to simmer and cook the potatoes until they are
tender when poked with a fork. Drain and set aside to cool for the moment.</P>





<P>5. While the potatoes are cooking, look in on the chicken and flip it over.
You may want to baste it again with the honey and mustard, but make up a
new batch. The first batch may have bacteria in it from the raw chicken,
so make sure to also clean the basting brush. Cover again.</P>





<P>6. While the potatoes are boiling, slice the zucchini very thin and place
into a skillet with the butter, salt, and pepper. Cook on medium heat
until the zucchini are tender, but not soggy.  Remove from the heat.</P>





<P>7. Once the potatoes are cool enough to touch, cut each into fourths and
put into a bowl. Toss in 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt and the butter
indicated. Set aside.</P>





<P>8. By now the chicken should be done (the juices should run clear when cut).
 Remove
from the grill. Now everything is ready to serve. If the
zucchini is cool, place on the burner long enough to heat, and if the
potatoes are cool, put in the microwave long enough to warm. Serve
according to your appetite.</P>

<B><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><P>Candlelight Dinner of Burgundy Beef Tips, <BR>
Honey Glazed Carrots, Seasoned Rice,
 and dessert  <I>(perhaps a <A HREF="des1.html">Baked Apple</A>)</I>
</P></H3></B>

<P>Have you ever wanted to be romantic on short notice, and all that's in the refrigerator is beer, salsa, and chicken salad?  It's difficult, when you live alone, to be frugal with your money, but at the same time be elegant.  I have devised a menu that provides romance with easy steps, a small amount of time, and little money.  Get ready for a menu that will enhance a romantic evening!</P>



<BR>







<B>

<P>8-10 oz. of beef sirloin tips (you will probably have to buy beef sirloin 	and have the butcher cut it into pieces for you)</P>




<P>Burgundy wine or other dry red wine</P>




<P>1 red pepper</P>




<P>1 green pepper</P>




<P>1 small onion (I suggest vidalia or a white onion)</P>




<P>1 tablespoon of butter</P>




<P>1 small package of baby carrots</P>




<P>1 tablespoon of honey
White rice (enough for two people)
1 beef boullion cube</P>



<BR>
<BR>



<P>Directions</P></B>




<P>1. Cut the peppers into thin strips and discard the seeds.  Then cut the onion into thin rings.  Place enough of each for two people into a skillet with the butter.  Saute' until the veggies are hot and partially cooked, but still a bit crisp (about five minutes).  Set aside.</P>




<P>2. Heat a skillet or wok on high heat and add the beef tips.  Cook briefly on all sides to brown (this seals in the juices).  Turn the heat to medium, then add 1/4 -1/2 cup of the burgundy wine and continue to cook until the beef is no longer pink in the center.</P>




<P>3. While the beef is cooking, follow the directions for the rice and get that started.  Add the boullion to the water according to the instructions.  This will flavor the rice quite nicely.  </P>






<P>4. Go back to the beef tips while the rice is doing its thing.  Add the sauteed veggies to the tips, season to taste with salt and pepper, and turn the heat to low.</P>





<P>5. Check the rice before you move to the carrots.</P>






<P>6. The fastest and easiest way to cook these carrots is going to be in the microwave.  Put the carrots, about a teaspoon of water, and a dash of salt into a microwave safe container.  Cover with plastic wrap, place in the microwave, and cook on high for about three minutes.  After this time, poke them with a fork to test them.  They are done whenever they are as tender as you like.  Drain off the water, and add the honey.  Place the plastic wrap back over the bowl and place back inside the microwave (do not turn it on...this just provides a place to keep the carrots warm).</P>




<P>7. Check the rice.  Check the beef tips.  If everything is hot and done, you are ready to plate it up and eat it.  **If the sauce with the beef tips seems too runny, take about 1/8 to 1/4 of a teaspoon of cornstarch, mix it with a bit of cold water (to form a paste), and stir it into the beef tip mix.  This will thicken the sauce.  Continue to cook just a few minutes longer, and then serve.</P>



<P>Bon Appetit!</P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>-P</FONT>ut a quarter of a vanilla bean into the bottom of a ten-cup coffee pot
before the coffee is brewed. The bean will steep in the coffee and
take on a wonderful flavor. Try serving with whipped cream and vanilla
sugar.*</P>




<P>- Place a cinnamon stick in the bottom of a ten-cup coffee pot. Follow the
directions above.</P>




<P>- Fill a coffee mug half full with coffee and then add one tablespoon of
chocolate syrup. Top with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cocoa.</P>




<P>- Use vanilla sugar or honey to sweeten your coffee.</P>




<P>- Present your guests first with their own cups of coffee, and then place a
saucer of hard candies on the table that they can drop into their coffee to
sweeten and flavor it. Good flavors to try are butterscotch, cinnamon,
peppermint, caramel, anise, vanilla, amaretto (Brachs makes a line of
International Toffees that would be excellent for this purpose).</P>





<P>For those who don't like coffee, the same ideas can be applied to hot
chocolate. This idea goes over well with youngsters.</P>





<P>*Vanilla sugar is made by burying a piece of vanilla bean in a cup or two
of sugar.  Seal both in a jar and allow to sit for a few days. Shake every
now and then to disperse the flavor.  Taste it to determine the intensity
of the vanilla flavor and use as desired.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Berry Wonderful Salad</H2>
<BR><BR>





<P><FONT SIZE=4>A</FONT>lthough it is not as common to see fresh fruit as an end to a French meal, it will pop up occasionally, especially when the weather is hot and something light is in order. This also makes a wonderful snack.</P>








<P><B>1 pint of good raspberries</B></P>





<P><B>1 pint of blueberries</B></P>





<P><B>1/2 pound of cherries-halved (Bing cherries are wonderful)</B></P>





<P><B>1/2 pound of strawberries-sliced thin</B></P>





<P><B>Honey</B></P>





<P><B>Heavy whipping cream</B></P>


<BR>
<BR>



<P><B>Directions:</B></P>





<P>1. Make sure that all of the fruit is clean before starting. Carefully wash the berries in cold water and pat dry with a clean towel.</P>





<P>2. Leave the raspberries and the blueberries whole. Remove the seeds from the cherries and then cut each in half. Remove the tops of the strawberries (be careful not to remove too much of the berry) and then slice them thin.</P>





<P>3.  Put all of the berries into a bowl and gently mix together.</P>

  



<P>4. If the berries are a bit tart, sprinkle with a bit of sugar and mix again. Be careful not to use too much sugar. You want to be able to taste the berry, not the sugar.</P>





<P>5. Pour about 1 cup of the whipping cream into a mixing bowl and begin to mix on low speed of an electric mixer (a wire whisk can be used, but beware that it is hard on the arm muscles). When it JUST starts to thicken a bit, add about one tablespoon of honey and continues to beat. You do not want the cream to get chunky, just smooth so that when you pull the beaters out of the mixture, it gently sticks to the beaters. Even if it is a bit runny, that's okay. Now taste it to make sure that it's sweet enough. If not, add a bit more honey and mix just long enough to incorporate. Cover and refrigerate.</P>





<P>If you're not ambitious enough to make your own whipped cream, either buy some or simply serve the berries sprinkled in honey. </P>

 



<P>To serve, put a small portion of berries into a dessert dish and carefully place whipped cream on top. Garnish with fresh mint if desired.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Chocolate Carmel Pecan Ice Cream Pie
</H2><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Here's a dessert that is perfect for company or just to enjoy all by yourself.  And guess what? It is sooooo easy!

<B>

<P>1 pre-made pie shell (graham or cookie)</P>





<P>1 quart vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt</P>





<P>1 small package chocolate chips</P>



<P>1  small package pecan pieces</P>





<P>1 jar carmel ice cream topping </P>

</B>
<BR>
<BR>

<B>Directions</B>



<P>1. Pull ice cream out of the freezer and allow to thaw on the counter for about 1/2 hour.</P>





<P>2. Open the pie shell, but leave it in the foil tin.</P>





<P>3. Melt 1/2 cup of chocolate chips over a hot-water bath or in the microwave.  </P>





<P>4. Spread the chocolate evenly over the bottom of the pie crust.  Put it in the refrigerator to harden the chocolate.
</P>




<P>5. Spread the ice cream into the pie shell (on top of the chocolate).  Use only enough to almost reach the top edge of the shell.</P>

 



<P>6. Pour the carmel over the ice cream and smooth.  You probably won't need all the topping.</P>





<P>7. Sprinkle the pecans on top.  You could also sprinkle chocolate chips on if you want.  Freeze for two hours.</P>





<P>To serve, use a warm, wet knife to slice through the pie.  Garnish with whipped cream and serve.</P>



<B>*</B>Hot chocolate or flavored coffee goes well with this.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Baked Apples</H2>

<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P>This old favorite is a deceptively simple recipe. It makes a sweet, enticing desert, or a spicey treat any afternoon.</P>







<P>1.	Take your favorite apple, core it and peel the top half. 
</P>




<P>2.	Place in a oven-safe container just large enough to hold the apple.
</P>




<P>3.	Fill the center with 1 teaspoon of butter or margarine, 1 teaspoon<BR>
 brown sugar, and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon.
</P>




<P>4. 	Preheat oven at 350 degrees. Put apple in oven for 10 minutes. 
	Then baste the apple with the syrup in the bottom of the dish. </P>

	

<P>Bake for 10 more minutes.</P>







<P>5.	Repeat process until apple is tender when poked with a fork.</P>





<P>6.	Remove from oven carefully. Sprinkle more brown sugar if
 	desired.</P>


<P>Variations on a theme<BR>


Replace brown sugar with honey or omit the brown sugar and<BR>
 	cinnamon and fill the center with "red hot" candies.</P></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>What do you eat on the go? Is it scary to think about? Most fast-food junkies should find their diets more frightening than dirty gym socks. When you're on the run, you have to get what you can when you can, right? Wrong. Many of you are back in school, dashing from one side of campus to the other, and now is the time to learn how to keep eating healthy when time is lacking.

Here are a few rules for when you're "on the run."



<P><B>Rule #1: Plan Ahead:</B> Make a list before heading to the store. Think about your needs "on the go" as well as those for dinner. What can you pop in your bag that is satisfying but quick and healthy? Try some of these:</P>



<UL>
<LI>Fresh fruit: apples, oranges, bananas
<LI>Cereal bars: lots of flavors
<LI>Granola bars: energy on the run
<LI>Cereal-throw some in a baggy and voila! A healthy snack
<LI>Dried fruit-apricots, raisins, cranberries, etc.
<LI>Baby carrots: quick, crunchy, and healthy
<LI>Jerky: turkey, beef, whatever
<LI>Vegetable juice in a can
</UL>





<P>Before you go to bed, put one or more of these items in your backpack or purse, so you'll be prepared in your rush the next morning.</P>



<B>

<P>Rule #2: Be Prepared:</B> Keep something extra with you or in your car for those times when you don't get a lunch break. Eat your stash instead of a vending-machine "sugar glob." Even if the snack will not hold you until dinner, it will hold you until nutrition can be found in something other than a chocolate bar and a cola.</P>



<B>

<P>Rule #3: Be Smart:</B> There are times when either our stores have been depleted or we were too sleepy the night before to remember our "instant energy." Sometimes it's impossible to do anything besides fast food. In this case, be sensible and feel better about your choice. A number of places now have salad bars, grilled or roasted items, and some even have "light" menus. Use common sense...unless you left that at home with the granola bar.</P>





<P>Being on the go is rough, but eating smart can be easy. Plan ahead, be prepared and be smart. It's a lot cheaper to buy a box of eight cereal bars at the grocery than to buy eight cereal bars from a vending machine. Spend that hard earned cash on something else... like running shoes for those mad dashes across campus.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Healthy Eating--French Style</H2>
<BR>
<BR>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>W</FONT>hether you are trying your hand at classical French fare or are simply trying to keep the hot side hot and the cold side cold, here are a few ways to lighten your food and get you on the road to healthier eating and a happier life.</P>





<P>1. Try using non-stick pans to reduce the amount of oil or fat needed to cook with.</P>





<P>2. Saut&eacute; vegetables in water or a spritz of cooking spray instead of oil or butter. Season with herbs and spices.</P>





<P>3. Use lower-fat or no-fat ingredients when possible.</P>





<P>4. Ste am your vegetables whenever possible--this not only keeps them crisper, but they retain a lot more nutrients this way.</P>





<P>5. One cup of beans adds flavor and fiber, not to mention protein, to soups, stews and salads.</P>





<P>6. When a recipe calls for salt, either reduce the amount by half, or omit it all together and season with herbs. This lowers sodium in the diet.</P>





<P>7. If a recipe calls for whole eggs, try replacing 2 egg whites for every 1 whole egg. This lowers fat in the recipe (1 yolk has about 4 grams of fat) and cholesterol. </P>





<P>8. After cooking ground beef, place it in a strainer and rinse it with hot water to remove excess fat and grease.</P>





<P>9. When a recipe calls for butter, reduce the amount by a third and see what the result. You may be surprised. (This does not always work in baked products)</P>





<P>10. Substitute lean ground turkey or chicken for regular ground beef when possible.</P>





<P>There are many other ways to make a healthier you, but this will hopefully head you in the right direction.  Good Luck.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Your First Kitchen</H2>
<BR>
<BR>



<BLOCKQUOTE><P>As graduation approaches, we are all faced with the big questions.  How do I survive on my own?  What do I do?  What do I need?  Do I have what it takes to keep my underwear from turning pink in the washer?   Despite how huge the real world seems, it is possible to pull it into perspective.  Assuming your mother has helped you along until now, here is just a little more motherly advice to get you going. </P>

 



<P>The new apartment tenant must have a few things to survive in the kitchen.  Some people need more than others, but even if all you do is eat hot dogs and frozen dinners, I think the following will still apply.</P>





<P>The Absolutely Must-Have Kitchen Stuff</P>





<UL>
<LI> A small microwave (great for those frozen dinners and leftovers)
<LI>A paring knife and a chef knife (see the article in the May issue of ENTER)
<LI>Simple dishes (plates and bowls are a must; saucers and gravy boats are not)
<LI>Silverware (go for about 4 sets of knife, fork, spoon if you live alone)
<LI>Glasses (pickle and jelly jars work well here)
<LI> Basic spices (salt, pepper, cinnamon, etc.)
<LI> A sponge and dish soap (Do NOT use regular dish soap in dishwasher.  Use dishwasher soap, otherwise, you will be cleaning up suds for a long time.)
<LI> Plastic storage containers for leftovers (try Cool Whip containers and butter tubs)
<LI>One skillet and one saucepan (try to get a non-stick skillet)
<LI> A small four cup coffeepot (these also can make tea)
<LI> Dish towels and pot holders
<LI> Spoons and spatulas
</UL>




<P>As you get into your kitchen, you will probably want more than just these items, but these are the essentials.  Just think: if cavemen survived with sticks and rocks, you can survive with these simple basics.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Black Peppercorn Steak</H2>				

<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT> have returned from France and have some wonderful things for you. 
I've modified some French recipes to fit your lifestyle. Using healthier cooking methods and altering the ingredients a bit, I have brought to you French Cuisine ... almost.</P>








<P><B>3 tablespoons of black peppercorns (or combine black, pink and white)</B></P>





<P><B>4 or 5 steaks of choice, cut to about 3/4 of an inch</B></P>





<P><B>Non-stick cooking spray (butter flavored if possible)</B></P>





<P><B>Salt</B></P>




<P><B>1/2 cup of alcohol (brandy, cognac, wine)</B></P>





<P><B>1/2 to 1 cup of heavy whipping cream</B></P>





<P><B>1 onion</B></P>

<BR>
<BR>




<P><B>Directions:</B></P>





<P>1. Using a hammer or the back side of a pan, crush the peppercorns. Do this just before use to preserve the flavor.</P>





<P>2. Divide the peppercorns evenly between the steaks and press firmly into the flesh. The steaks may be refrigerated overnight this way to infuse flavor.</P>





<P>3. Spray the pan generously with the cooking spray.</P>





<P>4. Add the steaks and onion to the pan and saut&eacute until brown on the first side.  Flip the steak over and repeat. Season with salt and continue to cook until done as desired.</P>





<P>5. Remove steaks and onion rings from the pan and carefully pour off the juices and discard. Place the steaks and onions back in the pan.</P>





<P>6. Return the pan to the burner and add the alcohol and flambe, if desired.*</P>

 



<P>7. Add the cream to the pan and simmer for about five minutes, stirring occasionally.  If the onions are not yet done, remove the steaks from the pan and continue to cook.</P>






<P><B>Serving suggestions:</B></P>





<P>Candied yams, baked potato, caramelized onions, salad</P>





<P>*Flambe means to light the alcohol. This will leave the flavor of the liquid, but remove the alcohol from it. Read up or ask a pro before trying this.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Summer Vegetable Salad</H2>				

<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>H</FONT>ere's another French recipe modified for healthier eating. This one would be wonderful on a summer picnic or a family pitch-in.</P>








<P><B>1 cup of diced carrots</B></P>





<P><B>1 cup of diced celery</B></P>





<P><B>1 cup of shelled peas or lima beans</B></P>





<P><B>1 cup of green beans</B></P>





<P><B>1 cup of yellow pepper</B></P>





<P><B>4 or 5 tablespoons of red or white wine vinegar salad dressing (low-fat or fat-free is best)</B></P>





<P><B>1/2 cup of low-fat or fat-free mayonnaise (Miracle Whip works too)
salt and pepper, if desired</B></P>


<BR>
<BR>



<P><B>Directions:</B></P>





<P>1. Dice the carrots and celery into pieces the size of peas. Shell the peas and discard the shells--unless you want to nibble on them while you are preparing the salad.  Next, break off the head and tail of the beans and break each into 1/2-inch pieces. Peel the pepper, if desired, discard the seeds, and cut into pieces the size of peas.</P>





<P>2. Put the carrot and the celery in cold, salted (about 1/4 teaspoon) water and bring to a boil. Simmer for about 10 minutes or until tender when poked with a fork. Drain and set aside.</P>





<P>3. Boil the peas and green beans in salted (about 1/4 teaspoon) water for about 6 minutes or until they are just tender when poked with a fork. Drain and immediately put them into a tub of cold water (this stops the cooking).  Then drain and set aside.</P>





<P>4. Mix all the vegetables in one bowl with the salad dressing. Set aside to cool before adding the mayonnaise.</P>





<P>5. Stir in just enough of the mayonnaise to lightly bind the salad together.
Refrigerate. The flavor improves as the salad marinates, so make at least 6 hours in advance.</P>





<P>Any number of vegetables can be used according to your taste. Try some of these: beets, potatoes, leeks, turnips, pearl onions, red pepper, green pepper. The object is to keep the salad colorful.</P>

<P><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Trisha Turner</A></P>




<P><FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT>f you're trying to decide whether it's better to rent or buy a home, look no further. Here's the definitive answer: It depends.
</P>




<P>"There's no rule of thumb," says Kim Donahue, education coordinator with Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Indiana. "But there are several questions people should ask themselves when deciding whether to rent or buy.</P>





<P>"First, ask, 'What is my goal?' If you are extremely mobile, as many young people are, then you don't want the burden of selling a house if you have to make a move. Second, ask, 'What is my lifestyle?' Do you really want the responsibility of taking care of your own maintenance, or is it easier to call a landlord? Once you buy a house, you are your own landlord."</P>





<P>There's always the issue of money. Here again, lifestyle should play a role in the consideration, according to experts.</P>





<P>"Young people change jobs frequently," says John Benjamin, associate professor of finance at American University in Washington. "When you buy, there's a selling commission of about six percent that you will have to stay in a home between three and five years to recover. There are also the hidden costs of home ownership--things like getting rid of termites."</P>





<P>Indeed, although house payments may appear to be no more--or even less--than the rent you're paying for that tiny apartment now, Benjamin says, don't be fooled. "You have to maintain this thing if you buy it," he says, "and, unless you're in an upper income bracket, you're not likely to benefit from using mortgage interest as a tax write-off. My vote is against buying a home as a young adult."</P>





<P>But the other side of the story, says Milwaukee real estate buyer-broker Michael Holloway, is that theoretically, "people are better off buying as soon as they have enough money to buy."</P>





<P>A brochure from North Dakota State University's extension service, "To Buy or Rent? The Choice," outlines several rules for paying for housing. For example, no more than 25-30 percent of total net monthly income should be spent on total housing expenses-- including utilities, telephone and cable television--and first-time home buyers should spend no more that two and a half times their annual gross income on a house.</P>

<BR>
<BR>
<P><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Andrew Vitale</A></P><FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT>t's getting late. You flip on the radio and hear: "My girlfriend likes to use my penis to slap against her face in sex. Is something wrong with her?" Sex is never boring with Dr. Judy Kuriansky, Chris Jagger, Fuzzball and the entire cast of the late-night radio talk show <I>Love Phones</I>. It's their raw, unfiltered approach that makes the sexual side of life extremely popular with millions of listeners nationwide each night.</P>





<P>The syndicated show is a unique mixture of entertainment and self-help. It's a place where even the most bizarre aspects of sex are discussed live with compassion, sound effects, smart-ass comments and celebrity guests (or "Honorary Love Doctors" as Kuriansky, a.k.a. Dr. Judy, calls them). You would expect someone with a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, 10 years of medical experience and 15 years in the media discussing sex to stand out in a crowd. And Dr. Judy doesn't disappoint.</P>





<P>But even though her fiery red hair, glittering gold sunglasses and exposed bra scream sex, Dr. Judy says her message is less about sex than it is about people caring about each other. And her calm and understanding voice lead you to believe she means it.</P>





<P>When we caught up with Dr. Judy she was explaining to an inquisitive women the definition of the "turtle" position. Our interview began with the hole at the end of a penis as part of her explanation. Never at a loss for words--or visual aids--Dr. Judy explained why sex, love and fear are all a part of <I>Love Phones</I>.</P>





<P><B>Enter:</B> What is <I>Love Phones</I> about?</P>





<P><B>Dr. Judy:</B> We're talking about sex because people have questions about it. I've been in this business for a really long time. I'm a psychologist, but I've been a TV reporter and a radio talk-show host for 15 years, and writing columns and books and speaking to colleges all over the country. Things have not changed that much in the years that I've been doing it. People still have the same questions. They have incredible myths that are really, really bizarre.</P>





<P>I'm very secure about what I know, and that, I think, is communicated to other people. I want everybody to feel secure and confident about who they are and what they feel in life, and how they are in relationships. And that's what I've reached in my life. I know what I'm talking about when I'm on <I>Love Phones</I> and I'm giving advice because I know the range of experiences and problems and I feel that I'm the best at what I do.</P>





<P> <B>Enter:</B> Is there a message that you try to get across with every show?</P>





<P><B>Dr. Judy:</B> We're trying to get across that people should really care about each other. The three R's, they're like what's <I>Generation Sex</I>. Respect for yourself and for the other person. Responsibility, being responsible in sex, and the right to say yes and no to anything, particularly in sex. So, that's kinda the big message. The four letter word that we really try to get across ends in K is really TALK.</P>





<P>Because when I'm talking about sex I'm not really talking about sex. I'm talking about feeling good about yourself, making smart decisions, and choosing the people who are gonna love you and care about you, and self esteem.</P>





<P><B>Enter:</B> There are a lot of shows that discuss sex today. What is it that your show hits on that others don't?</P>





<P><B>Dr. Judy:</B> There is becoming more and more conservatism in this country about sex, and its this conservatism that makes people feel more threatened, fearful, ashamed and guilty about their feelings. They need a place like <I>Love Phones</I> to feel accepted so they can appreciate themselves and respect themselves. The more there is oppression, the more there is a need for expression.</P>





<P>That's why <I>Love Phones</I> is becoming more and more popular. People of all ages--and especially young people--need to feel that they are okay and normal, and they have a place where somebody can really respect how they feel without judging them, and that's what we do on <I>Love Phones</I>.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>hanks to the courage and common sense of a few judges, the Communications Decency Act has been beaten back for a time. This is no time to get smug, beat chests or claim victory. The censors took a hard shot to the ribs, but the fight, they promise, isn't over. We win round one; round two will be tougher.</P>





<P>Note their posture. Censors never cower, even in the face of a certain whuppin'. Why? There's something about their psychology, about being superior and perfect and always right. Would you back down or slink <!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=342 HEIGHT=269 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="reasontoon.gif">silently away if you thought civilization itself depended on you and your struggle? You can beat on censors twice a day forever and not win. Like ghoulish extras in a George Romero movie, censors never stay down long.</P>





<P>The First Amendment has survived this long because its guardians have an equally high threshold of pain. God bless our first line of defense, the fearless editors and brave librarians who put their careers on the line to protect our freedom. You should hear some of their war stories. You can't imagine how often these heroes have stood their ground in the face of spineless publishers, wilting library boards or holier-than-thou civic busy bodies. Is there a monument in Washington to the Unknown Librarian? There should be.</P>





<P>These people inspire us to be vigilant. They teach us that censors never rest and neither should we.</P>





<P>Censors keep pace with technology. Life was easy when all they had to do was ban a few books, but the smart censors go wherever there are good ideas. They were quick to attack when movies, radio and television came along. When the Internet came along, censors were ready. They never miss an opportunity to keep you ignorant. </P>





<P>There will more CDAs. The people who claim they want government off your back are the same people who want to suppress your freedom with CDAs. People who advocate deregulation of industry want to regulate your life with CDAs. They would abolish regulations protecting our food and environment while regulating what you read and see.</P>





<P>Don't take your gloves off yet. Expect the bell for round two soon. </P>

<BR>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT>f an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, a few bucks spent on an annual tune-up for your car could save you several hundred dollars in repair bills. And think how warm and cozy you'll be as you drive by all those frozen cars stalled in parking lots and driveways this winter.</P>





<P>The tune-up is an end-of-summer ritual for many drivers, although it doesn't matter when it gets done. Some mechanics, manufacturers and car dealers suggest a tune-up every 12,000 miles, but still drivers cling to the autumn tradition. When leaves begin to fall, cash registers at garages begin to jingle. In fact, because fall is tune-up season and a tune-up can take anywhere from an hour and a half to three or four hours to complete, some garages suggest calling ahead.</P>





<P>"You want to make sure it runs in the winter, so a lot of people get it done in the fall," says Terry Decker, a service manager. "Some people get it done in the summer if they know they'll be doing a lot of summer driving. And some people don't want to do it at all, so they wait until it doesn't start and then they get it done."</P>





<P>Prices for a little preventative maintenance can run as low as $35 to $40 to as much as $55 or $60, depending on the area of the country, the type of car, the garage doing the service and the depth of tune-up involved.</P>





<P>"The tune-up today is a lot different than it was, let's say, 15 years ago," says service manager Mike Bering. "With fuel-injection systems and distributor-less ignition systems, most tune-ups are basically changing the spark plugs."</P>





<P>Some tune-ups also require computer diagnostic checks, Bering adds. The typical tune-up should include:</P>



<UL>
<LI>Replacing the spark plugs
<LI>Checking all belts and hoses to make sure they're not brittle or weather-cracked.
<LI>Checking fluids and filters, distributor cap and rotor, wires, vaccum lines, PCV valves, and timing
<LI>Cleaning and lubing the carburator on cars without fuel injection
</UL>



<P>Safety checks that aren't part of a typical tune-up but should be made regularly--some even monthly--include: inspecting all exterior lights, including headlight alignment; checking the muffler and exhaust pipes; checking tires for wear and loose lug nuts; checking brakes.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="m.gif" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="M"><BR><BR>illions of people scurry through the twisting passages of this online world every minute and someone has to do a little house cleaning now and then.</P>


<P>"We're the janitors of the Internet," says Lauren Gonzalez, assistant editor at <I>Internet Underground </I>magazine. "That's what we do for technology." </P>





<P>For 12 to 14 hours a day, Gonzalez trudges through Web page after Web page trying to make sense of the thousands of diverse sites. Because much of what being a web reviewer is about is putting things in their place, "you have to have a librarian's mind," says Gonzalez.</P>

 



<P>According to Patrick Joseph, reviews editor at <I>The Net</I> magazine, a typical day begins by going through your e-mail for about two hours. Then, sipping on a cup of coffee with URLs in hand, you're off to explore every nook and cranny of the Internet. "You never know what you're looking at so it takes some time," says Joseph. "Things that you never looked at before you are looking at now."</P>





<P>As you discover roughly 60 sites a day without fear of the boss rushing in to see what's on your screen, keep in mind that you're going to tell the world your impressions of sites like the Ultimate Manure Spreader page, a site its creator and visitors may take very seriously. "By it's nature the rules are a little slippery. You're reviewing a site whose content you're not familiar with," says Joseph.</P>





<P>But it may be a little thing about a site that you tended to overlook for months that becomes the major striking point in a review. "You need to have ideas that spark other ideas," says Gonzalez. While it may be easy to rant on about the cool new 'zine that you found, a limit of around 100 words per review requires that you pack a lot of punch into little space. Reviewers need to write distinctly, says Joseph, and be able to do it "with some voice."</P>

 



<P>As days become weeks, and sites blur together into a never ending string of what's new, hot or what's not, you develop a clear sense of what's worth your time. "The more you do this, the more you realize if you want to review a site right away," says Gonzalez. </P>





<P>The difficult thing about spending all your time cataloging the Web is that you see a lot of sites that suck, according to Gonzalez. "But that's also the fun. It's a Catch 22 because you may find something really interesting." And that's what the job--and the Web--are all about. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<P>
Like a lot of graduating seniors, I couldn't wait to start my career. Unfortunately, I had a harder-than-expected time finding a job in my major (social work) and ended up taking a job as a clerk in a liquor store. One thing led to another and I wound up working there nearly six months. It was extreme HELL.</P>

<P>The owner was a Danny DeVito clone with a nasty temper and breath that smelled like a freshly exhumed corpse. To make matters worse, <IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="postal.gif"> Death Mouth liked to munch on peanut butter crackers and barbeque potato chips while bending over the cash register to cough in your face. He would then run his greasy fingers around his gums to dislodge, examine and ultimately re-enjoy any unswallowed orange cud.</P>

<P>The thing that ticked me off most was when he would criticize clerks in front of customers. Turnover was always high, which he blamed on "irresponsible college kids" rather than his abuse and the putrid minimum wage he paid.</P>

<P>Anyway, our store was robbed four times in the six months I was there--twice on my shift. I don't know why I didn't quit the first time. The last time was shortly before Christmas and this guy walked in and pointed a gun at my face. Believe it or not, this guy was kind of polite and even said thanks and "Merry Christmas" when I gave him the money from the register. He was walking backwards out of the store when he hit a display stand, knocking over several bottles of booze. He laughed and said, "There goes the profits." I wished him a happy holiday. When I told the cops the story they all laughed because they hated the owner as much as I did.</P>

<P>When Death Mouth saw the video of the robbery he went through the roof because I was, in his words, "awful damn friendly" with the robber. The video even showed me laughing. Death Mouth was kicking broken glass around the store and cussing before I decided enough was enough. I told him where he could stick a two-liter bottle of club soda and quit on the spot.</P>


<P>A week later I got a good job at a clinic I had applied to months earlier. The best part is Death Mouth called me twice asking me to come back to the liquor store. What a freakin' lunatic. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<P><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Jeff Morris</A></P>
<P>It's that wretched time of year again. The blistering dog days of summer are winding down. The days are getting shorter. It can only mean one thing: Back to school. Time to trade your tan for the healthy glow of inebriation. Instead of kegs on the beach, it's kegs at the beach parties. Oh yeah, and a few of those class things cluttering up your party schedule. Of course, if you're already out of school, September means nothing to you. After all, you rarely see the sun anyway. You'll be spending the rest of your summers chained to a desk working a fluorescent light tan. But don't fret, at least the pay is miserable. And at least we've put together a great list of videos to cheer you up.</P>
<BR>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>P</FONT>opularity 101 </P>
<P><B>Heathers</B> 1989 Winona Ryder, Christian Slater, Shannon Doherty 102 min. Color. Didn't you hate that smug clique of so-called "popular" people from high school? Didn't you just want to kill them? Welcome to the outrageously dark comedy of <I>Heathers</I>. It's <I>Breakfast Club</I> meets <I>Blue Velvet</I> as Ryder, the reluctant member of a popular quartet of girls, and her new psychotic outsider boyfriend, Slater, accidentally kill the lead Heather, setting off a rash of suicides by status-conscious teens looking for posthumous popularity.</P>
<P>
Also with Ryder: <I>Mermaids, Edward Scissorhands, Dracula</I></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>M</FONT>ost likely to succeed<P> <B>Back To School</B> 1986 Rodney Dangerfield, Robert Downey Jr. 96 min. Color. Think about how cool school would have been if you were a millionaire? You could have actually spent your book money on books instead of 12-packs. Dangerfield knows how it works in this uproarious tale of a self-made millionaire who decides to better himself by entering college with his son. Also with Keith Gordon, Sally Kellerman.</P>
<P>Also with Dangerfield: <I>The Projectionist, Easy Money, Ladybugs</I></P>
<BR>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>E</FONT>xtracurricular Studies</P>
 <P><B>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</B> 1986 Matthew Broderick, Jeffrey Jones 103 min. Color. Broderick is Ferris, a Chicago high school student who definitely has his priorities straight: classes should never get in the way of having fun. With his best girl and best friend piled into a borrowed vintage roadster, Ferris stays just one jump ahead of his moronic high school principal who lives to send Ferris to summer school. Mia Sara and Jennifer Grey also star in this hilarious John Hughes classic.</P>
<P>
Also by Hughes: <I>Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Weird Science, Pretty In Pink.</I></P>
<BR>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>W</FONT>hew! It's so hot, I could kill someone</P>
<B>Dog Day Afternoon</B> 1975 Al Pacino, John Cazale 130 min. Color One last fling in the summer heat with one of the hottest Pacino films. Based on a true story, Pacino turns in a outstanding performance as a confused criminal who holds hostages in a bank in exchange for money to pay for his lover's sex-change operation. Of course, in the grandest tradition of our sick society, he becomes a media hero for his trouble. Cazale is celluloid perfection as Pacino's dimwitted partner. Supporting cast includes Charles Durning and Chris Sarandon.
</P>



<P>
Also with Pacino: The <I>Godfather</I> trilogy, <I>Serpico, ...And Justice For All, Scarface, Sea Of Love, Frankie & Johnny, Scent of a Woman</I></P>

Fullhart says a first-time homebuyer shouldn't bring anything "to the table except themselves." She talks of a short "sequence of things they should do." First, there must be a "willingness to take on responsibility." Secondly, a new homebuyer should go to a mortgage company, bank or other lender and get "prequalified to find out how much they can afford. Then they'll know if maybe they should wait longer, save up for a better downpayment."</P>

<P>You can think of the downpayment as the homeowner's version of the renter's damage deposit and one month's rent in advance. The difference, of course, is thousands of dollars versus a few hundred. That downpayment can range from three percent to 20 percent of the price, says Fullhart. "Sometimes you can do a quick qualification over the phone, but you have to be honest (when asked financial questions). Honesty is very important."</P>





<P>If you think you can afford to buy, Holloway encourages doing so. That does not mean, however, that you should look to buy that four-bedroom home with the huge yard like the one where you grew up.</P>





<P>"People forget it took mom and dad 30 years to afford the house they live in," he says. He suggests buying a duplex, a building with more than one housing unit, and renting one of the units out. He speaks from experience. The profit he has made off of the duplex he bought 16 years ago is now his down payment on a condominium in Vail, Colorado.</P>





<P>Are condominiums yet another alternative to renting? Absolutely, says Fullhart. "Remember, a condo is purchasing real estate. You do get a deed." Any advantage in condo living isn't necessarily measured in dollars and cents, she adds. "I won't say it's more expensive. It's just not any cheaper. The biggest advantage to condos, as I see it, is somebody is taking care of the external maintenance."</P>





<P><IMG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=166 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="Sale.gif">Holloway also argues against the theory that home ownership will tie you down. "I might move away tomorrow. I might also get hit by a bus, right? I know people who've said they're going to move for 20 years. They haven't."</P>





<P>Still, Washington University's Benjamin suggests it's wiser to put money in other investments before the age of 30 when you consider what he calls "the hassle factor" of owning your own home.</P>





<P>But what's best for you? Consumer Credit Counseling Service's Donahue says only you know that answer. The bottom line is simple, she says.</P>





<P>"Make sure you do all the homework you can." </P>

<P><B>Enter:</B> But do you feel that there's enough time to really help people on the air?</P>





<P><B>Dr. Judy:</B> When I first started in this work it was very, very distressing to me that I couldn't spend hours and hours with each person. Everybody deserves hours. I had to accept that the show is a totality, it's like a group experience. If people don't get their answer answered completely in whatever time we give them, then they get their answer by listening to other people. <IMG WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=299 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="drjudygene.gif">There are many people who call and say they learned by listening to everybody else. It's a vicarious experience, and a totality, rather than just enough time for everybody.</P>





<P><B>Enter:</B> What about people with serious problems like the caller who only had four months to live and wasn't sure if he should get married?</P>





<P><B>Dr. Judy:</B> [Dr. Judy takes a deep gasp, puts a hand to her chest, places her hand on my shoulder and dramatically leans back.] That was incredible. That was an incredibly beautiful call, because it just showed what <I>Love Phones</I> does, that it's not really just about sex, but to really touch their hearts.

<P><B>Dr. Judy:</B> I put people on hold. We have a bunch (of calls we put on hold). We have a whole staff of graduate students who get back to people. We follow them up as much as we can. We take care of them. We do our best. We offer as much as we can.</P>





<P><B>Enter:</B> Do you always follow the advice that you give?</P>





<P><B>Dr. Judy:</B> Yeah. My advice comes from my heart. It just comes through me. Over the years I've been really growing to be authentic, and that is my goal personally and my message to everybody. To totally be yourself. Most books talk about how you should put on games, learn and pretend and wait, and my message is just be yourself. That's what I am on the air. Each day and each night is that challenge to me. I never get tired. I never get depressed, because of the connection to somebody, really heart to heart, it makes me energized not tired.</P>





<P><B>Enter:</B> Are men ever uncomfortable about getting in a relationship with you, because their afraid you'll analyze everything they do?</P>





<P><B>Dr. Judy:</B> They go one of two ways. Either they really want to try it out with the Queen of Sex and Love and test themselves and earn five stars. Or they're intimidated and petrified and scared. </P>

<IMG ALT="When"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="when.jpeg">it comes to knowing what you're worth to a company the cards may in fact seem stacked against you. Maybe you've played a game of Go Fish with a potential employer. The game goes like this: "Do you have an ace?" you ask cautiously. "Nope, better luck next time. Go fish," the employer replies. All you find in the mess of cards is deuces. 
</P>




<P>"Job interviews are all a game so you just have to be careful how you play your cards," said Sara Veatch, an associate relations manager, with more than eight years of experience.</P>





<P>To straighten that mess of cards out you must first know how much the position you are interviewing for pays on the job market. Libraries and bookstores are littered with salary guides, but those guides are packed with figures from people with one to three years of experience. 
</P>




<P>Information overload.</P>





<P>One reliable source to find out what your colleagues are being offered fresh out of school is the Salary Survey published quarterly by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE). The guide is located in almost every college career center.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>Y</FONT>ou've just graduated from college and said yes to a terrific job offer. The new boss wants you to start in two weeks, however, and the job means moving to a city several miles away. Before you reach for that first cardboard box, there are a few things you ought to know.</P>





<P>Apartment hunting is rarely fun. It usually involves numerous phone calls (often long distance) and a lot of driving (sometimes over great distances). It can include negotiating with landlords or office managers. Just when you think you're stressed to the breaking point, there is a decision to be made, <IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="rent1a.jpeg">one you should be prepared to live with--and live in--for the length of your lease.</P>






<P>Here are some--though by no means all--of the basic questions and concerns a smart first-time apartment shopper should address. For purposes of brevity, most of our examples deal with complex living as opposed to that great second-floor flat in the renovated warehouse or the spartan quarters over your buddy's garage.</P>





<P>Start with solid resource information, which should include:</P>





<P>
<UL>
<LI>The classified ads or real estate section from the newspaper in 	   or near the city where you're moving.
<LI>An "apartment guide" from your new city.
<LI>One or two professional apartment locators in the area.
<LI>A book of advice for renters.
<LI>The phone numbers of some friends or future co-workers familiar with your new city.
<LI>A detailed apartment "wish list."
</UL></P>





<P>It doesn't matter which of these resources you use to kick off your search. There are often one or more free apartment guides published in larger metro areas, and these little magazines can be a good place to start because they feature the sort of apartment photos that can spark ideas for your wish list. Or you can start with the classified ads. Of course, if you come across any ads that begin "SWM seeks attractive SWF," you're in the wrong section.</P>





<P>In his book The Renter's Survival Kit (1993 Dearborn Financial Publishing, Inc.), author Ed Sack says safety should be a chief concern when looking at an apartment's location. Cathy Sharp of Apartment Showplace agrees.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>Y</FONT>our palms are wet and your heart is pounding. You're stuck in the hot seat and about to give a performance that details everything from school to what jobs you've held. You'll be probed and analyzed, and the entire time you may never know if your going to make it. This unscripted and almost impromptu act must go like clockwork if you want the job.</P>

   



<P>Welcome to the world of job interviews.  If you're prepared for the interrogation you'll be able to distinguish yourself from the competition. According to Scott Lashley, a human resource manager with four years of experience, the key to a successful interview is to research the company you're interviewing with, and he emphasizes, "be prepared for anything."</P>


<IMG WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=285 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="don2a.gif">


<P>John Veatch, a human resource manager with four years of experience agrees, "Be ready for any type of question. I want to know what you know about us."</P>

 



<P>The best way to acquire knowledge about the company you're interviewing with is to start finding information at the library and on the Internet before the interview. Focus your search to not only general information, but also find information about the position you want. According to Veatch the more informed you are the better your questions are about the company. </P>





<P>"I place a lot of emphasis on questions asked of me," says Lashley. "It helps me to interpret someone's knowledge." Your preparation will not only show your knowledge and interest in the company and position, but it will set you apart from the competition. </P>





<P>"The question I like the best is when someone asks me what I like most about the company," says Veatch. </P>





<P>Although being prepared also means that you need to bring the right materials to the interview. "I like to get your resume, manuscript of classes and any references up front," says Veatch. </P>





<P>Even though the interviewer already has your resume, and will be asking questions framed around it, walking into an interview with the right materials can distance you from the competition from the outset. You immediately establish that you can take the initiative to provide necessary information without being asked first.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Bill Thornbro and Andrew Vitale</A></P>

<BR>

<P><IMG SRC="ydrop.gif" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="Y">our resume might be strong, your references top-notch. But if your cover letter is full of mistakes, you can forget landing an interview with most companies. One personnel director put it this way: "You want to make a favorable impression. Don't look stupid."</P>





<P>The cover letter is your introduction to a company. It needs to make an immediate impact. A cover letter is nothing more than a standard business letter that states in a few words why you should be hired. The letter should compliment the resume, not copy it. According to Sara Veatch, an associate relations manager, "you have to come up with something that makes a company want to talk to you." </P>





<P>Many companies are besieged with applicants for open positions, and your cover letter may only get a brief glance initially, making it important to clearly define in the opening statement what position you are applying for and where and when you saw the position advertised. "The first thing I do is look for a cover letter, then I scan it to see what position they are applying for," says Veatch. "I get a lot of resumes that don't have them (cover letters) at all, and that is a negative."</P>





<P>How important is a cover letter to getting an interview? Veatch says the cover letter accounts for about 25 percent of the overall package. Without a cover letter you're already starting with a "C" average when competition for jobs commonly knocks "A" applicants out of the running. "It (the cover letter) is going to tell me how well you write, how you put sentences together, and it's going to give me an idea of your personality," says Veatch.</P>

 



<P>Always sign your cover letter. And never misspell the name of the person who'll be getting the letter. Either mistake can kill any chance for an interview.</P>

 



<P>Applicants should personalize each cover letter. Address the letter to a specific person. Even if a classified ad lists only the name and department of a company, job applicants should take the initiative and call the company to get the name of the person receiving the resume and letter. Joseph P. Goodwin, an assistant director of career services, advises against using "Dear Employer" or, worse, "Dear Sirs."</P>





<P>Some of these errors are common among applicants who have an all-purpose cover letter stored in a computer or word processor. "It's like, well, 'I'm on their little assembly line,'" says Veatch.</P>





<P>Goodwin agrees. "If the person is using a standard cover letter from a word processor, tailor the letter to the position," says Goodwin, who thought of several instances where applicants failed to update existing computer files and sent cover letters to, say, a human resources person at Bowling Green but the letter's salutation was to a person at Eastern Michigan.</P>


 


<P>"Mistakes are common to all categories," says Goodwin. "New grads or experienced job seekers, we see the same mistakes across the board." Slipshod editing has killed many otherwise strong cover letters. Goodwin says people rely too heavily on the spelling features of computers and word processors, which are notorious for having difficulty differentiating between certain words. "Have it proofread," he suggests.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=46 ALT="L"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="ldrop.gif">ook at any magazine, or watch TV and you'll see that human beings, must be pretty foul creatures. It seems we emit smells that offend anyone in our immediate vicinity. For years, Madison Avenue targeted the self-consciousness of consumers by advertising the "latest" or "newest" cure for one of these problems, bad breath.</P>


	


<P>For years, the prescribed cure for bad breath was brushing and using mouthwash (you decide - "mediciney" or "minty"). Dr. Howard Smith's Fresh Breath and Dr. Harold Katz's California and New York Breath Centers have grabbed a lot of media attention in the less than three years that they have been in existence. According to Dr. Katz, "The demand for our services has stunned us. We have successfully treated over 3,000 people since we started. In 1995 alone, we received over 10,000 inquiries [and] the number grows exponentially daily."</P>


	


<P>Halitosis, as the condition is formally known as, afflicts a wide spectrum of people. Dr. Katz estimates about 20 percent of the general population has this condition, with most of his patients falling in the 25-75 year old range. "However, we have seen patients as young as six, and as old as 86. It is evenly distributed between the sexes." says Katz "As far as socio-economic or other determinants, we have attorneys, bank presidents, physicians, computer <IMG WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=289 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="breath3.gif"> executives, teachers, scientists, etc. as patients. We also have dentists who have come to us for this problem." This condition is truly an "equal opportunity problem" Katz says.</P>


	


<P>Dr. Smith agrees that the condition is not limited to any single social or biological constraint, but he has found that "it has been our experience that middle-aged females are most likely to seek treatment, perhaps more so because of the social ramifications of living with this condition." Both doctors report requests for help and information from around the world.</P>


	


<P>Opinions for treatment vary. The toothpaste and mouthwash manufacturers continue to push their products, but the latest research is showing that these products have limited effects, and in some cases may only exacerbate the problem. Mouthwashes that contain alcohol will cause the mouth to dry out, one of the causes of halitosis. Dr. Katz recommends sufferers of this condition avoid alcohol, "whether it says Budweiser or Listerine on the label."</P>


	


<P>According to Dr. Smith, "80 percent of bad breath originates from the mouth, and 80 percent of these cases originate from the back of the tongue." He attributes this to numerous causes, including "poor oral hygiene, a diet that includes spicy foods, or dishes with a lot of garlic, onions or different cultural spices; a poor diet [lacking] the proper foods from the suggested food groups; not enough liquid intake (i.e. water); medications that tend to cause a dry mouth; and lastly, different systemic conditions which may lead to bad breath, such as infections in the lungs, stomach ulcers, or upper airway infections."</P>


	


<P>The actual odor can be attributed to "anaerobic bacteria that are located on the back of the tongue, and in the throat," Katz says. He adds that these bacteria are not "infectious or bad bacteria," but actually have a function in the digestion of food particles, "particularly proteins, by breaking them down into smaller chemical units, so that the digestion process is assisted."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>By contacting your creditors you can fend off any calls or stop the ones that may already be coming.

<P>So you've found what may be your next car and it's used. Before you drive into the sunset with the wind blowing through your hair, you need to carefully examine the car first.</P>






<P>We spoke with LemonBusters of Texas and Lemon Aid of Pennsylvania, two professional used car inspection services, about how to inspect a used car for potential signs of wear, tear, and damage. </P>





<P>Before you begin any inspection, make sure that a "Buyer's Guide" is displayed on the car if it is at a dealer. Federal law requires dealers to display the "Buyer's Guide" sticker to give buyers the warranty information. Read it carefully, because in many states the words "as is" declares a denial of warranty coverage, according to Consumer Reports.</P>





<P>If the car is from a private seller, ask for the service records, repair bill, or warranty information. If they look perplexed or can't show any documentation you may want to begin looking elsewhere for a used car.</P>



<P>If you're satisfied with the information you have gotten so far, it's time to begin a thorough inspection of the vehicle.</P>





<B><P>Start the engine<BR></B>

Begin by starting the car and letting it run during the entire time you're checking things out.</P>





<P>"Sometimes people will try to mask engine problems by putting very heavy oil in the engine to quite it down," said Greg Geske of Lemon Aid. "You will be able to hear any problems by letting it run for a while."</P>





<P>Some sounds such as ticking may indicate stuck valves or lifters, and a knocking sound could be more severe.</P>





<B><P>Get inside<BR></B>

Go over every inch of the interior of the car. If there is a button or switch use it and check for and any signs of water stains or moisture. Explaining to a cop you bought this car and didn't know the brake lights were out may not get you out of a ticket.</P>




<B><P>Under the hood<BR></B>

Check all of the fluids and look for any leaks. This includes the oil, transmission, radiator (shut engine off for this and let it cool down), power steering, and brake fluids.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>here are people for whom leasing a new car might be an attractive option. But leasing isn't for the faint of heart. If you qualify, the process and terms of the deal can be complicated enough to drive the most experienced CPAs and tax attorneys bonkers, and the average consumers, if they're not careful, can find themselves driven straight to the cleaners.</P>





<P>To give you an example of what you're in for when leasing,  Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine quoted a general manager of a large import-make dealership: "Unfortunately, buyers are not really wise on leasing right now...If you are willing to pay $250 a month, I can make a lot of money on you. If you haven't compared me with other dealers on the details, I can probably really take advantage of you...if I were that kind of guy." </P>





<P>Leasing is all about the fine print so it's important to decide if this option is right for you. According to <I>Car Buyer's and Leaser's Negotiating Bible</I> by W. James Bragg (1996 Random House) there are advantages.</P>




<UL>
<LI>Monthly payments are lower.
<LI>You can drive a new car every two years.
<LI>You can drive cars you couldn't afford to buy.
<LI>Rarely a down payment.
</UL>



<P>Coming straight out of college, the lack of a down payment and low monthly payments are very attractive, but according to Bragg there are also disadvantages.</P>





<P>
<UL>
<LI>Leasing usually means keeping your miles under 15,000 a year.
<LI>You have zero equity in the car.
<LI>Leased cars aren't covered by "lemon laws."
<LI>End-of-lease charges can be killers.
</UL></P>





<P>Mileage can kill any initial cost advantage you may have if you drive a lot. Written into every lease is a cost-per-mile if you exceed the maximum allotment. The charge ranges from 10 to 15 cents a mile.
</P>




<P>If you're ready to look at leasing as an option, always remember to get the best price you can on the car first. Even if you know what payment your monthly budget allows, and you're set on leasing, you'll lose any negotiating advantage if you let the dealer know that payment up front. Make sure you're getting the car and options you want at what you believe is a good price. Consult new-car pricing guides such as Edmunds and Consumer Digest for option packages and retail prices. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=4>S</FONT>ome people would rather drive off a cliff than shop for auto insurance. The whole concept is depressing (my god, bodily injury!). The language and actuarial science can be confusing. And insurance ain't free.</P>





<P>"It's not easy to understand," admits insurance agent Jim Beehler. "Sometimes I've been confused by the thing."
</P>




<P>Finding the best policy doesn't have to be an awful experience, insists Beehler, and a careful consumer can find terrific bargains. Calling insurance companies and getting great rates is easier "once you have a basic understanding of what the coverages are and you know what terms like bodily injury and property damage mean," says Beehler.</P>

<IMG WIDTH=126 HEIGHT=351 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="coverage1a.gif">



<P><B>Bodily Injury Liability</B></P>





<P>You'll usually see a pair of numbers divided by a slash in the policy. It might be "100/300," for example. In that case, the insurance company will pay up to $100,000 per person for bodily injury caused by your accident, or up to $300,000 total to everyone in the other car, says Beehler.</P>





<P><B>Property Damage Liability</B></P>





<P>This is another of those "splits." If the policy reads 100/300/100, the first two numbers are for bodily injury, the third property damage. It means your policy will cover up to $100,000 of property damage you cause in an accident. "Generally it's another car," says Beehler, "but every once and a while a car jumps a curb and hits a building."</P>





<P>The required minimum amount of coverage for both bodily injury and property damage liability vary from state to state, according to Beehler.</P>





<P><B>Medical Payments</B></P>





<P>These figures apply to the policy holder and his passengers. The company will pay up to the amount in the policy per person in the vehicle. The numbers typically range from $5,000 to $100,000 or more.
</P>


<B>Comprehensive</B>



<P>Fire, theft, wind damage, a deer caught in your headlights, a tree falling on your car, the effects of the Jonestown Flood. "Say a rock is thrown up and breaks your windshield," says Beehler. "That's comprehensive."</P>





<P><B>Collision</B></P>





<P>As the name suggests, collision is all about hittin' or gettin' hit. It includes everything from cars to shopping carts. Shopping carts? "It happens a lot in mall parking lots," says Beehler.</P>





<P>Comprehensive and collision coverage typically involves deductibles. If your policy calls for a $500 deductible and the appraised damage to your car is $2,000, you pay $500 and the insurance company agrees to pay the rest.</P>





<P><B>Uninsured Motorist Coverage</B></P>





<P>This protects you in the event your car is hit and/or you're injured by a driver without insurance. "It usually matches the bodily injury liability limits," says Beehler.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><IMG WIDTH=41 HEIGHT=60 ALT="T"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="tdrop.gif">he ads and infomercials promise easy money for little work and minimal investment. Some of them are legitimate business deals, some are outright ripoffs. Many straddle the ethical-legal line. Nearly all of them can leave an unsuspecting individual with third-degree burns.</P>





<P>You've seen the ads. Often tucked away in the employment section of newspaper classifieds or near the back of cheap supermarket tabloids, the ads suggest thousands--even millions--of dollars can be made working part time out of the home. "Learn the secrets that made me a millionaire!" is a common claim. You won't learn those secrets for free, of course. You have to buy the book, kit, audio or video tapes. They're not cheap.</P>





<P>Nobody knows exactly how many people fall prey to these job or investment scams every year. An investigator with a state attorney general's office said many people would rather forget the experience and right off their lost investment rather than admit they bought the exaggerated claims of a fly-by-night outfit. Who wants to admit they're a sucker?</P>





<P>Even victims who seek justice will have a difficult time. "The laws are there and they can be enforced," says law professor James P. Nehf., "but the first problem is finding the perpetrator." There are consumer protection laws in every state, but the con artists and grifters seldom have a permanent address; they often rely on mail drops and post office boxes, travel frequently and change company names when they fear the law approaching.</P>





<P>To make matters worse, "consumer fraud is never very high on a state legislator's agenda," says Nehf. "It's not a high enough priority to get legislation that's helpful." Victims are not "getting ripped off for thousands and thousands of dollars, they're getting ripped off for a few hundred dollars."</P>





<P>That can be very frustrating to a person who hoped an ad might pave the way to riches--or at least provide the lucrative second income needed to get out of debt. "It's as if there's nothing you can do. To have a legal remedy but not be practically able to pursue it, it's like there's no remedy at all," says Nehf.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><IMG WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=54 ALT="O" ALIGN=LEFT SRC="odrop.gif">n the side of a dark highway. It's raining. Life's hell if you're forced to work on your car.  Your hand slips as you try to wrench a lug nut off a wheel. The image of Bill Bixby races thorugh your mind. His eyes glaze over, his shirt rips open and he becomes the steroid-engorged Incredible Hulk.  <A HREF="/movnsound/angry.wav">"You wouldn't like me when I'm angry."</A> (79k "Incredible" wav file.)</P>

  



<P>"The key to avoiding a road-side emergency is preventative maintenance," says Doug Smith, the manager of automotive services at a AAA regional office. According to Smith, there are several little visual things you can do to help.</P>

 



<P>"Start by checking your tires for signs of damage and correct air pressure. Also, inspect the engine for cracked hoses, worn belts, low oil and make sure your coolant is full," says Smith. But even the most intense inspections may not keep you from reaching your final destination carefree. That's when you're forced to become a road-side mechanic--and your chances of pulling the job off successfully improve dramatically if you have the right tools.</P>





<P>There's some basic equipment everyone should have in their car, and it's not as expensive as finding a phone and calling someone to fix things for you. "I get a milk carton and put everything in there, and then strap it into my trunk with a bungee cord," says Smith.</P>





<P>Here are the essentials to stock your milk carton up with according to Smith:</P>





<P><UL>
<LI>A flare or orange triangle to warn others that you're stranded on the side of the road.
<LI>Extra antifreeze in case you lose all of your coolant.
<LI>A quart of oil, because as the heat rises on the road your oil becomes thinner and could become low on a long trip.
<LI>A bottle of transmission fluid. If the transmission starts to slip because you are running low on fluid, this will prevent serious damage. 
<LI>Some shop rags or old rags to clean up with after you are done working on your car.
<LI>A flashlight for working in the dark, especially under the hood.
<LI>Bottled water so you don't overheat, and you can mix the water with the antifreeze to thin it out and make it last longer.
<LI>Crackers or a candy bar. You may be there for a while.
</UL></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>E</FONT>ach month The Glue Factory is devoted to covering topics that relate to keeping your car properly maintained and (nearly) hassle free. If you have questions about auto maintenance, send them to  <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">us</A>.  </P>










<P><B>Question:</B> My tires are losing traction and are getting pretty bald, but I don't have $300 to $500 to put four new tires on my car. What can I do before I get a flat that leaves me stranded?</P>









<P><B>Answer:</B> New tire prices can be intimidating and cost nearly as much as a month's rent. If you are looking for a good set of tires that will get you by for a year or so, then look into used tires. At many junk yards, gas stations and some tire dealerships, you can find a lot of tires with 50-to-90 percent of the tread left on them. It is not uncommon to replace all four tires for less than $100.</P>





<P>Although used tires are a bargain, there are some things you need to do before buying.</P>





<P>1. Visually inspect the tires for bulges, patches or cracking. Then run your hand across the tire to feel for unevenness. 
</P>




<P>2. Look for uneven wear. The best way to check is to bring along a penny. Place the penny between the tread on one side of the tire and mark with your thumb how deep the penny is into the tread. Then do the same with the other side of the tire. Make sure there is not a lot of difference between the depth on each side. </P>





<P>3. Check the inside of the tire to see if there is ground-up rubber. Shavings inside a tire indicate it was driven when it was flat.</P>





<P>According to one mechanic: "I found a set of four used tires for my truck and have driven 35,000 miles on them. I only paid $40 for all four."</P>








<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="gluepic1.jpeg"><BR>
<B>Quick Tip:</B> The string of numbers on the side of the tire refer to its size. For example, 205/55R15 S means: 205--the cross-secion width of the tire in millimeters, 55--the Aspect ratio of the height to width, and 15-- the diameter of the rim in inches. The letter crammed in between the numbers refers to Radial Construction. The letter at the end refers to the highest speed a tire is designed to go. The letter designation's top speed, in miles per hour (mph) is: S--112 mph, T--118 mph, U--124 mph, H--130 mph, V--149 mph, Z--over 149 mph.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Question:</B>  I'm driving a used car and have no idea when the air conditioning was last recharged. How much can I expect to pay?</P>


 
 

<P><B>Answer:</B>  As long as you think your AC adequately cools your car, leave it alone. Unless there's a leak or seepage, most cars can go years before the AC needs recharging.</P>


 
 

<P>"I know people with '87 and '88 cars and they've never touched it," says Mike Bunch, a service manager. "If it's cold every year, there's no point in checking it. It's one of those things that if it's not broke don't fix it."</P>


 
 

<P>Standard AC draws hot air from the outside and cools it with a chemical before releasing the chilled air in the car. Depending on the make and model, you should feel a temperature change in 15 to 30 seconds. Service technicians check the AC's cooling ability by inserting what looks like a meat thermometer in one of the centerally located vents for a minute or two. Bunch says the temp should run 42 to 48 degrees.</P>


 
 

<P>Costs will vary around the country, but Bunch says labor at his shop will be about $40. Typical jobs require between two and four pounds of chemical coolant. One chemical is R12, commonly called Freon. Freon is a mixture of fluorine, carbon and usually chlorine and has been determined to damage the Ozone layer. Its price has skyrocketed lately and now runs about $25.50 a pound. "Supply and demand is driving prices up," says Bunch.</P>


 
 
 

<P>Freon's chemical cousin, the more environmentally friendly R134A, costs less than $20 in some places. Bunch sells it for $18.75.</P>


 
 

<P>Eventually all cars will use R134A. Drivers won't be switching from one chemical to another, however. "It's not going to be as simple as that," warns Bunch. Some cars will require adjusting of some fittings before going to the new chemical; it'll cost about the same as a recharging. Others, though, will need parts of the system replaced, and that could be $300 to $400 or more.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG ALT="W"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="w.jpeg">hen your star is on the rise, you can say crazy stuff and get away with it. But Rafaela Farias doesn't sound crazy. She sounds full of The Great American Dream, even when she says something really nuts like:
</P>




<P>"If you love what you're doing, money shouldn't matter."</P>





<P>The 28-year-old radio personality is hopelessly sincere. "I DJed at a radio station for four years for no money," she says, and you look at that heart-shaped face, deep into her honey-brown eyes, and you believe her every word and wonder why more people don't work 14 hours a day for black bread and water.</P>





<P>Farias, who goes by the moniker Ralph in real life and Rockin' Ralph on the air at 
<A HREF="http://www.wfbq.com">WFBQ-FM</A> in Indianapolis, combines hard work with equal parts enthusiasm and cuteness. She grins as she describes the handful of national radio commercials she recently recorded, but she positively beams as she explains the source of her work ethic and positive attitude--her parents.</P>





<P>Her Mexican-American parents were migrant farm laborers. They decided they would end the cycle of migrant life. Emilio Farias quit school in the eighth grade to work extra hours in the fields during hot Hoosier harvests, and he later toiled on a car lot before landing a factory job. Ralph's mother, Remigia Nunez, studied hard in high school and turned a love for typing into a scholarship to secretary school. When her family went back to South Texas at season's end, Remigia stayed in Indiana and furthered her education. Emilio and Remigia eventually met and married, settled down in quiet Union City, and raised their children to believe anything is possible if you're willing to work hard.</P>





<P>"To me, the American  Dream is fulfilling your goal, whatever it might be," says Ralph. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG WIDTH=260 HEIGHT=157  SRC="officehead.gif"></P><BR>



<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>here is no hell quite like an office where everyone hates each other. No cheerful "good morning" by the communal Mr. Coffee. Whispering cliques abound. Bosses preach teamwork in quiet meetings but practice favoritism when it counts. Anger and resentment, the twin viruses that kill productivity, thrive under weak, disinterested or incompetent management.</P>





<P>Hank Miller has heard all the nightmarish stories. As a manager of staff training, Miller leads workshops for university employees on workplace violence. His three-hour sessions are designed to "sensitize supervisors to violence early warning signals," but his experience in human resources has taught him that things don't have to reach that extreme before an office suffers emotionally.</P>


<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="scream.jpeg">


<P>"We need to communicate," says Miller. "Teamwork is more important than ever and so is group interaction. It's more important that people communicate and be open with each other."</P>





<P>Miller says "supervisors can control situations before they get out of hand," but that's assuming the supervisors aren't the cause of the problem. "That can be a little more difficult," he adds. "There are people who are technically proficient but who haven't been adequately trained in interpersonal skills or dealing with subordinates."</P>





<P>Like most HR personnel, Miller prefers "more informal" ways of correcting problems or dealing with the inevitable clash of personalities. "You need open communication to clear the air," he says.</P>





<P>Any company that believes all its internal squabbles are self-correcting is asking for disintegrating employee morale. Imagine a carpeted gulag full of brooding young malcontents, bitter mid-level managers stuck in office purgatory, and abusive bosses who openly pit workers against each other in almost gladiatorial battle.</P>





<P>Smart companies have grievance processes in place where employees can "go through the channels all the way through to arbitration, if that's necessary," says Miller. If the problem is with the boss, though, employees need to think long and hard. "It's a natural inclination that people would be apprehensive about going to a supervisor with problems with that supervisor."</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<P><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Heather Brophy</A></P>

<BR>


<P><IMG WIDTH=53 HEIGHT=50 ALT="W"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="wdrop.gif">ith 7,000 volunteers serving in 93 countries, a lot of people apparently love the "the toughest job you'll ever love," the Peace Corps, the number one employer of college graduates.</P>





<P>Many people envision a hut deep in a Third World forest when they think of the Peace Corps. But today a volunteer is just as likely to live in an apartment building and work in an office complete with phones and computers. For thirty-five years the United States has been sending volunteers to countries to help share technical knowledge as well as build understanding between countries. </P>

 



<P>While being a volunteer is not the most financially rewarding position--you will  earn mere peanuts--it does offer an opportunity to gain international experience, technical skills and, in most cases, a new language. Plus, you will have an advantage in getting federal government employment later. It even lets you put off the "real world" a little while longer. Experience of a lifetime--<IMG WIDTH=227 HEIGHT=219 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="peace1.gif">travel, adventure, helping others--what else could you want? But is it the career move to make? And how difficult is it to join?</P>





<P>Only four out of every 10 applicants are invited to serve. The first step to joining the Peace Corps is to get an application. Call or write the Peace Corps office, or visit their web page and ask for one to be sent to you. By the end of the summer you will even be able to download it from the web page. The application is long and Michael Wiedel, recruitment coordinator of the Chicago regional  office, suggests filling it out in detail and spending a lot of time on it.</P>





<P>"We're looking for interest and knowledge--through volunteering and education--that qualify (the applicant) for a position," says Wiedel.</P>





<P>Most volunteers work in four basic areas--agriculture, education, health or business. These and related degrees are helpful in obtaining a nomination.  There are also programs which do not require a specific degree but are based on work or volunteer experience. Teaching a vocational trade like carpentry is one example. Other experiences and certifications can also help so be sure to include CPR training and that vegetable garden you had last summer. Language skills are also a bonus, especially French and Spanish. While a college degree is not required, most volunteers are college graduates. And you must be at least 18 and a US citizen.</P>





<P>The next step is an interview, done either by phone or in person at a regional office or college campus. Two soon-to-be volunteers both felt face-to-face interviews were better.</P>





<P>Colleen Turner went to Chicago for her interview. She felt it gave her a chance to connect with her interviewer. She also felt she had more time with her interviewer compared to friends who interviewed on campus.</P>



<P>Throughout his application, Ahmad Ali never saw or spoke in person with anyone. Instead, he conducted his interview over the phone through the Dallas regional office while he lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico. While he was nominated, he felt a face-to-face interview would have given him a chance to really show his recruiter why he wanted to join the Corps.</P>





<P>Wiedel says recruiters are looking for someone committed and patient, with strong leadership skills as well as specific skills that qualify her or him for a  position.</P>





<P>Patricia Garamendi, associate director of recruitment, agrees the Peace Corps wants motivated, committed people with cross-cultural sensitivity because "all the skills in the world don't do any good without cross-cultural sensitivity." She says if you don't qualify for a position due to a lack of experience, you can work with the recruiter by doing some volunteer work--like six months of ESL (English as a Second Language) tutoring--to qualify for a position.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG ALT="Y" IMG ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="y.jpeg">eah, you can see yourself in uniform,  a burly member of the feared Mattress Police, that top-secret division of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Box Springs. You'd take a blood oath to uphold the Constitution and to forever preserve the holy image of J. Edgar Hoover--the image we had before we learned the G-Man was a Girlie Man. Maybe you'd get to be a plain-clothes Mattress Dick. You could raid private homes, bust down bedroom doors and violate civil rights willy-nilly (What's a Constitution when you can be featured on Cops?). "Okay," you'd holler, "this is the Mattress Police. You two, stop that coitus right now!" You'd flash your badge so nobody could read it, towering over the probable felons like a California redwood. Then you'd wave your government-issue Uzi in their direction and scream: "Look, which one of you scumbags took off the TAG?"</P>

<!-- Graphic Tag -->
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="matt.jpeg">



<P>Only one problem, officer. There is no Mattress Police. The feds don't care if you remove the tag on your mattress. "The tag" is a requirement of individual state boards of health, not Janet Reno & Co. According to one bedding manufacturer, states require each company to attach a tag that lists the contents (goose down, polyester fibers, etc.) of new pillows and mattresses. "Each ingredient is listed on the tag," a manufacturer said, "along with a number issued to the company by the state.</P>





<P>But what about the famous warning, DO NOT REMOVE UNDER PENALTY OF LAW? "If you read it again you'll notice it says 'not to be removed except by the consumer,'" said another manufacturer, one who has heard this dumb story too many times over the years to be amused. "A lot of comedians tell the joke, but it's really not that funny."        <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">            <IMG SRC="http://www.entermag.com/end.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BASELINE></A></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>S</FONT>ounds like the perfect job, huh? After all, what could be better training than four (five, six, seven) years of college? I know I spent several Saturday nights trying to match my blood alcohol level with my GPA. I put in countless hours sleeping in dumpsters clutching 40-ouncers in both hands. And I took advantage of every opportunity to turn my liver into something resembling a fossilized lima bean. But I was surprised to find out that becoming a beer taster is hard work. If you think your ability to bong several metric tons of Schlitz will land you a job like this, it's time to sober up.</P>





<P>According to Donald Kent, a salesman for a midwestern beer distributor, most professional beer tasters are authors. Professional beer tasters "usually work for publishing houses or publications. Basically, they're specialized food critics," Kent says. "They travel the world tasting beer and writing about it. So it's probably a good idea to have some kind of background in English or journalism. And on top of that, many have experience as a brewmaster's assistant." 	</P>





<P>Brewmaster's assistant? That didn't sound very arduous. I found out, however, that becoming a brewmaster's assistant involves two more years of studying in a brewing academy. I envisioned classes like Foam 101 and Belching: Beer Remembered. But the curriculum includes a steady schedule of chemistry, biology and other yeasty sciences. So you see, becoming one of these beer-tasting food critics is quite a commitment.</P>

 



<P>I wasn't born yesterday. I watch TV, and I happen to know that every brewery needs someone within the facility to taste their beer. This was my next line of inquiry. Unfortunately, the outcome was similar. "This type of tasting is usually done in the brewery by a quality control panel, consisting mostly of the brewmasters themselves," Kent says. "But occasionally they do use test markets." </P>





<P>Ah, a ray of hope. I jumped on that tidbit like drunken sailor on a beer nut. According to Kent, when breweries are testing out a new beer, they take their product to the people. If you're lucky enough to be part of the demographic they're targeting, you may just get a taste. This won't lead to a job, but it may lead to a new favorite beer. However, the breweries have to find you. Pull up a stool and grab a brew--you might be waiting a while.</P>





<P>Don't lose heart. There are other ways to embark on the long road to barley and hops enlightenment. "You can gain some relevant insight from brewing your own or working for a beer distributor," Kent says. "But the easiest thing you can do is to just start tasting all kinds of beer." Amen.</P></TD><TD><!--space--!></TD></TR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>O</FONT>kay. By a show of hands, who else thinks America's funniest home video would be the televised execution of Bob Saget's joke writers? Do you equate watching Erkel to, say, a root canal with a chainsaw? What kind of people choose to cancel intelligent, well-produced shows like <I>Hill Street Blues</I>, <I>I'll Fly Away </I>and <I>Twin Peaks</I> only to insult viewers, night after night, by broadcasting the aforementioned crap?</P>





<P>Actually, it could be you. Or your neighbor. Because the 
fate of your favorite TV shows lies in the hands of the mythical Nielsen family. Like the famed monster of that Scottish lake, many don't believe Nielsen families really exist. Or they think it's a creation of the networks to control the masses through mindless televised drivel. Mostly because few people have met a genuine Nielsen family.</P>


<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="family.jpeg">


<P>Truth is, no one knows who the Nielsen families are. And the "families" won't tell you. Although it may sound like the type of conspiracy that would make Fox Mulder moist, these highly scientific methods make A.C. Nielsen the most respected and reliable viewer measurement service in the nation. According to a Nielsen source, the actual family sampling process can be complicated and many times the households aren't necessarily families in the "2.5 children" sense. In a nutshell, the Nielsen families are chosen as a representative cross-section of every type of household--from the single person living in a New York flat to members of the Freemen militia compound in rural Montana.</P>


 


<P>Unfortunately, you can't volunteer to be a Nielsen family. Some people have turned down the opportunity. According to Anne Elliot of the A.C. Nielsen Company, one man asked to be removed from the study because "whatever he watched suddenly turned up in the TV Guide," and he simply didn't want to be responsible for the power. </P>





<P>Of course, Nielsen does not actually cancel the show. The networks use Nielsen's viewer ratings to determine whether the show is profitable based on its production costs versus the amount of advertising the network can sell on the show. And shows with millions of viewers can be cancelled due to high production costs or lack of advertiser interest in the show's demographics. After all, television is not there for entertainment or enlightenment. It's there to make money.</P>





<P>Measurement devices include everything from a simple diary filled out daily by members of the household to electronic TV-top meters that automatically record when your set is on and what it's tuned to--then downloads information in the middle of the night to a central computer via modem.</P>





<P>And if that weren't Big Brother enough, Nielsen is currently testing a 
futuristic Passive People Meter technology. This TV-top device contains digitized facial features of every member of the family so it can "recognize" who's in the room without ever touching it. Spooky.</P>





<P>While you can't volunteer to be a Nielsen family, you should 
jump at the chance if A.C. Nielsen ever calls. Someday we may be able to credit you with saving us from the likes of the Olsen twins or Joey Lawrence.</P>





<P><I>The author participated in the Nielsen survey in 1989. He swears he watched all the good shows; blame his roommates for shows like Hard Copy and Full House.</I></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Jeff Morris</A></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=4>SCENE:</FONT> A balmy afternoon in New York City. Max (played by James Spader) 
has traveled several hundred miles from St. Louis and is about to enter 
the restaurant to reunite with his love, Nora (played by 
Susan Sarandon). He hesitates, then quickly ducks inside.</P>





<P>"Cut! You. Yes you, in the red shirt. Could you come out of the shop 
just a little sooner?"</P>





<P><IMG WIDTH=280 HEIGHT=238 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="crowd.gif">My big acting debut. For $25 a day, I had spent weeks just standing 
around drinking coffee, watching the action and waiting to be called. 
Only to be reduced to "you in the red shirt." But I couldn't be more 
thrilled. I was a movie extra in the feature film <I>White Palace</I>. Of 
course, when the movie hit the big screens, my celluloid debut (it was 
actually shot in the Central West End in St. Louis) didn't make it. Lost 
on the cutting room floor, as they say in the biz. I never even met any 
stars.</P>





<P>So how did I get there? A friend had heard about a cattle call audition 
on the evening news. We went, spent several hours in a cramped 
auditorium, filled out reams of paper, then went home to await our call 
to stardom.</P>





<P>According to Judy Welker, one of the midwest's premier casting 
directors, it sometimes happens that way. But only when vast numbers of 
people are needed. Like the cheering crowds in the movie <I>Hoosiers</I>. In 
New York or L.A. you can scour the ads in <I>Daily Variety</I> or the 
<I>Hollywood Reporter</I> for cattle calls, but most Hollywood casting 
directors won't even consider you unless you're with a Hollywood agent.</P>

 


<P>The midwest, however, is a different story. </P>





<P>"Many studios are now shooting in the midwest because [production] is 
cheaper, but also because the talent here are real people," says 
Welker, "so I don't necessarily look for people who are trained in 
acting because chances are that's not what the [studio] producer is 
looking for."</P>





<P>How do you become a movie extra? Try to arrange an appointment 
with a casting director like Welker, who operates Artistic Enterprises Midwest Casting. She keeps a database of 
profiles and photos that she calls upon when the Hollywood studios 
call upon her. Because of her busy schedule, it's tough to meet her and 
there's no guarantee you'll get any auditions. It all depends on her 
unique feel for the character and whether you fit that part. For 
example, the boy Welker cast in the part of a young Babe Ruth in 
<I>The Babe</I> had heard about the casting on the radio, visited the local 
library to research Ruth, then impressed Welker with his genuine 
personality. He ended up being the only child on the audition tape sent 
to Universal Studios.</P>





<P>According to Welker, these success stories sometimes feed local 
scams. "People hear these stories and think they can do it too. I always 
warn people to be very careful about answering newspaper ads. I rarely 
use advertising. I rely on my database. And I get paid by the studios, 
so I don't charge for auditions. There should never be a fee for 
auditions."</P>





<P>"Being an extra is a tough job for not much pay," says Welker. I 
couldn't agree more. "Excuse me, Mr. Coppola, what's my motivation for 
exiting this store?"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
