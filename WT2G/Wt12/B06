<TITLE>Paul is Dead</TITLE>
<H1>The "Paul is dead" Story</H1>
Originally posted to the net by rjp1@ihlpa.UUCP (Pietkivitch)  <P>
This is the message you hear when you play the ending of _I'm So Tired_
from the Beatles "White Album", backwards.  All the Beatles discussion on
the net has brought back memories from the "Paul is dead!" period.  Back
then, me and a couple of my friends really poured over our Beatles albums
(American versions) looking for "clues" about McCartney's death.  We had 
discovered phone numbers and called them.  Got strange replies like, "you're
getting closer" and "beware of Abbey Road".  I think there were times when 
we almost believed.  But of course, he wasn't dead.  And the phone numbers
and messages could have been faked.  After a time, these numbers didn't work
anymore and we lost interest.  But at the time, we were immersed..
<P>
For some reason or another, a Paul McCartney look alike contest was held.
The winner was William Campbell.  He supposedly looked enough like PM to sit
in with the other Beatles for photographs, sometimes even fooling the photo-
graphers.  There is a picture of William Campbell on the poster that comes
with the White album.  He's in the lower left-hand corner.  A small picture,
he has a mustache and is wearing glasses.  Looking back on that period, I now
understand the "hoax" to be a metaphysical statement made by the Beatles. Paul
did indeed die, spiritually, as he was re-born in the ways of the Maharishi. 
A spiritual rebirth; his old self dying.  The creative genius of the Beatles
(and I think all of them were involved to some extent in the great hoax) was
to have done this without anyone suspecting for a couple of years.  I think
it all started when a DJ stated that he thought PM was dead, and that the proof
lie in the album covers and in the lyrics of songs.
<P>
Well, I dug out my old scrap book and found a good many "clues".  Some of
them are clear statements, while others apply only with a stretch of the ol'
imagination.  The way we understood it back then was, PM got into this car
wreck early one Wednesday morning at 5 am whilest looking at a pretty meter
maid, not seeing the changing traffic lights.  He wasn't killed outright, but
his car caught fire, a crowd of people stood around, and then he died from
head wounds (he lost his teeth and hair).  The morning papar came out with an
article but was then censored, recalled.  Enter William Campbell and Sgt.
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  Here's some of the clues found on album
covers and song lyrics:
<P>
These are from the "American" versions
<DL>
<DT> Rubber Soul album:
<DL> The title "Rubber Soul" in the shape of a heart, indicating a "false soul"
amongst them.  The Beatles are peering downwards (at/in a grave?!).
<DT>	Rubber Soul lyrics:
<DD>
<DL>
<DT> I've Just Seen A Face:
<DD>	"..had it been amother day I might've looked the other way, and I'd
	have never been a were.." (the Brittish accent on the word 'aware'
	sounds like 'a were').
<DT> Girl: 
<DD>	"..that a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure will she
	still believe it when he's dead.." (who, Jane Asher?!)
<DT>I'm Looking through You:
<DD>	"..I'm looking through you, where did you go?  I thought I knew you,
	what did I know.  You don't look different but you have changed, I'm
	looking through you, you're not the same.." "..your lips are moving
	I can not hear, you don't sound different I've learned the game.."
	"..you were above me but not today, the only difference is you're
	down there.."  "..you've changed, you've changed, you've changed.."
	(yep, he's down there in the grave)
<DT> In My Life:
	"..all these places have their moments ... some are dead and some
	are living, in my life I love you more.."
</DL>
<DT>Yesterday And Today album:
<DD> The original Y&T album cover had a picture of the Beatles with decapitated
dolls, raw meat, and loose teeth.  PM had both teeth and a doll head on him,
indicating the places of his fatal injuries.  On the "other" album cover, the
Beatles are standing and sitting on an empty case.  PM is inside of the case
indicating that he's buried in one.  Is that a picture of William Campbell?!
William Campbell has this faint scar on his upper lip, PM doesn't.
<DT> Yesterday And Today Lyrics:
<DD>
<DL>
<DT> Nowhere Man:
<DD>	"He's a real nowhere man.." "..doesn't have a point of view, knows not
	where he's going to.." "..you don't know what you're missing, nowhere
	man can you see me at all?.."
<DT> Dr. Robert:
<DD>	"..you're a new and better man.." "..he does everything he can,
	Dr. Robert.."  (William is the new man.  Nothing Dr. Robert can do
	will bring Paul back)
Yesterday:<DT> 
<DD>	.."oh I believe in yesterday, suddenly, I'm not half the man I used
	to be, there's a shadow hanging over me.  Yesterday came suddenly.."
<DT> And Your Bird Can Sing:
<DD>	"..you can't see me, you can't see me.." "..you can't hear me, you
	can't hear me.." 
</DL>
<DT> Revolver album:
<DD> First cover with an open palm above PM's head.  An open palm
signified that the person below was departed from this world.
<DT> Revolver lyrics:
<DD>
<DL>
<DT> Taxman:
<DD>	"..if you drive a car *Paul*.." "..if you get too cold *Paul*.."
	"..my advice to those who die -taxman.." (see your taxidermist)
<DT>Eleanor Rigby:
<DD>	"..father McKenzie (McCartney?!) writing the words of a sermon that
	no one will hear.." "..was buried.." "..father McKenzie wiping the
	dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave, no one was saved.."
<DT>Yellow Submarine:
<DD>	"..in the land of submarines.." "..sky of blue, sea of green in our
	yellow submarines.."  (nice term for a casket that's underneath a
	sea of green grass)
<DT>She Said She Said:
<DD>	"..she said I know what it's like to be dead.."
<DT>For No One:
<DD>	"..she says her love is dead.." "..she says that long ago she knew
	someone but now he's gone.."
<DT>Got To Get You Into My Life:
<DD>	"..I was alone I took a ride I didn't know what I would find there.."
	"..and then suddenly I see you.."  (lovely Rita, meter maid)
<DT>Tommorow Never Knows:
<DD>	"..laid down all thoughts surrendered to the void.." "..*Paul* play(ed)
	the game existence to the end.."  (hmmm, we all play the game existence
	to the end)
</DL>
<DT> Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album:
<DD> I think here, the Beatles were masters.  The crowd includes faces (and bodies)
of many famous people who passed away or have become outdated.  Even the wax
figues of the "early" Beatles stand in.  They're overlooking a grave site.  The
flowers spell out the word "Beatles" and there is a bass guitar there with 3
sticks upon it indicating that there are 3 remaining Beatles. There is another
open palm above PM's head.  A doll sits off to the side (Jane Asher?!) with red
lines (blood) running down her dress.  A small car sits on her lap, a model of
the car PM was driving.  On the back cover, the Beatles are all facing forward
except for PM, who's turned around. George is pointing a "sixth" finger at him,
a sign of ill-omen.  If you read across the back cover, from left to right, you
can find all sorts of clues.  Starting with "Somebody calls you, you answer 
quite slowly" (from Lucy), continue to read across "Wednesday Morning at five
o'clock as the day begins", "life flows on within you and without you", "you're
on your own you're in the street".  Inside the album, PM has a patch on his left
arm "O. P. D.", which in Canada means "Officially Pronounced Dead".  Hmm, looks
like William Campbell again.  He always had a mustache or slight beard..  One
last note, the paper sleeve that held the vinyl record looked like it had been
standing in, soaking up blood!  At the bottom it's bright red but then fades 
into a light pink at the top.  Subsequent releases of this album did not have
the red-faded-into-pink color scheme on the inner sleeve.

<DT> Sgt. Pepper's lyrics:
<DD>
<DL>
<DT> Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band:
<DD>	"..so let me introduce to you the one and only Billy Shears and Sgt.
	Pepper's lonely heart's club band.."  (Sgt. Pepper's Band is actually
	an idea taken from history (somewhere) where a man was able to take the
	place of another man without anyone catching on.  Billy is a nice 
	nickname for William Campbell)
<DT>Fixing A Hole:
<DD>	"..and it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right where I belong.
	See the Beatles standing there, they disagree.." "..silly Beatle run
	around, they worry me.."  (William is adjusting to his new role)
<DT>She's Leaving Home:
<DD>	"..Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins.."  (the time
	of the fatal accident)
<DT>Lovely Rita:
<DD>	"..standing by a parking meter when I caught a glimpse of Rita.."
	(took his eyes off the road!)
<DT>Good Morning, good Morning:
<DD>	"..nothing to do to save his life.." "..and you're on your own you're
	in the street.." "..people running around it's 5 o'clock.." "..watching
	the skirts you start to flirt, now you're in gear.."
<DT>A Day In The Life:
<DD>	"..I saw the photograph.  He blew his mind out in a car, he didn't
	notice that the lights had changed.  A crowd of people stood and stared
	they'd seen his face before, nobody was really sure if he was from the
	house of *Paul*.."
</DL>
<DT> Magical Mystery Tour album:
<DD> Paul is in the walrus costume on the cover.  The walrus is a sign of death in
certain cultures.  The word "Beatles" when held to a mirror is actually a
phone number!  The number is: 2317438.  When my friends and I called this
number way back then, we'd get this strange, cryptic message "You're getting
closer.." and then the call would cut off abruptly.  Inside the album is a
booklet with pictures from the movie.  Page 3 has a picture of Paul seated
at a desk with a banner in front of him stating "I was".  Also looks like
Campbell again, you can see the scar on his lip here.  Page 15 has a cartoon
of Paul playing with a car on his desk.  On page 18 and on the last page of
the booklet there's that open palm again above PM's head.  Page 23 has PM
wearing a black flower, not a red one like the others are wearing.

<DT>Magical Mystery Tour movie:
<DD>There are a couple of clues in the movie, but I don't recall them at the moment.

<DT>Magical Mystery Tour lyrics:
<DD>
<DL>
<DT>Fool On The Hill:
<DD>	"..day after day, alone on a hill, the man with the foolish grin is
	perfectly still.." "..but nobody ever hears him and the sound he
	appears to make.."  (that's because he's gone)
<DT> I Am The Walrus: (no you're not! Said little Nicola.)
<DD>	"..bury me, bury me.." "..bury my body.." "..*Paul* you're darn
	near death!.." "..rest you.."
<DT> Hello Goodbye:
<DD>	"..you say goodbye, I say hello.."  (exit PM, enter WC)
<DT> Strawberry Fields Forever:
<DD>	"..I buried Paul.."  (this infamous line means he must've been there
	with father McKenzie)
<DT> All You Need Is Love:
<DD>	"..No one you can save that can't be saved.." "..nothing you can
	see that isn't shown.." "..yes, he's dead.."  "..we loved you yeah,
	yeah, yeah.."
</DL>
Interestingly enough, "Lady Madonna" and "Revolution" (45 rpm version) were
released next in 1968, but didn't appear on an album until the "Hey Jude"
album was cut in 1970.  So, I'll put "Hey Jude" next, before the White album.

<DT> Hey Jude album:
<DD> The picture above the Beatles on top of the doorway they are standing in
front of is a picture of where Paul is supposed to be buried.

<DT> Hey Jude lyrics:
<DD>
<DL>
<DT> Lady Madonna:
<DD>	"..Wednesday morning papers didn't come.."  (they were recalled
	remember)
<DT> Revolution:
<DD>	"..don't you know it's gonna be -all right, *Paul* died, all right.."
	(a couple of those "all rights" sound just like "*Paul died", also
	a background vocal occasionally dubs in/over *Paul* died)
</DL>
<DT> White album:
<DD> The 4 glossy pictures of the Beatles are John, George, Ringo, and William!
And, of course, there is a small picture of William on the poster that comes
with the album, as previously mentioned.

<DT> White album lyrics:
<DD>
<DL>
<DT> Glass Onion:
<DD>	"..I told you about Strawberry Fields.." "..well here's another
	place you can go.." "..to see how the other half live, looking
	through a glass onion.." "..I told you about the walrus and me.."
	"..well here's another clue for you all, the walrus *was* Paul.."
	"..I told you about the fool on the hill.." "..listen to me,
	fixing a hole in the ocean.." "..looking through a glass onion.."
	(a glass onion is a term used for a coffin with a glass panel
	over the top so you can see in, see how the other half live)
<DT> I'm So Tired:
<DD>	"..Paul's dead man, miss him miss him.."  (what you hear when you
	play the very end of the song backwards)
<DT> Mother Nature's Son:
<DD>	"..find me in my field of grass, Mother Nature's son.."
<DT> Revolution #9:
<DD>	"..his voice was low and his eye was high and his eyes were closed.."
	"..*Paul* died.." "..my fingers are broken and so is my hair, I'm not
	in the mood for wearing clothing.." "..maybe even dead.." "..you
	become naked.."  (these are heard playing the song forward amongst
	other things, the droning "number 9".  McCartney has 9 letters in it)
	"..get me out, get me out!.." "..turn me on dead man, turn me on dead
	man.."  (these are heard playing the song backwards, there is a nasty
	car crash and it catches fire, that's when you hear Paul screaming 
	"get me out! get me out!".  Curiously, the forward droning words
	"number 9, number 9" actually are the words "turn me on dead man"
	backwards!)
</DL>
<DT> Yellow Submarine album:
<DD> The open palm appears above Paul's head on the front cover, while the
yellow submarine is pictured beneath the land, very stationary.

<DT> Yellow Submarine movie:
<DD> The movie has a couple of clues, one happens during the song "All You Need
Is Love" when John sings "..yes, he's dead.." the word "know" on the screen
changes into the word "now" at the same moment.

<DT> Yellow Submarine lyrics:
<DD>
<DL>
<DT> Only A Northern Song:
<DD>	"..when you're listening late at night you may think the band is
	not quite right.." "..you may think the bands a little dark and
	out of key, you're correct, there's nobody there.."  (there's
	nobody there on bass, if that's what you mean)
<DT> Hey Bulldog:
<DD>	"..you think you know me but you haven't got a clue.."
<DT> Yellow Submarine:
<DD>	(see Revolver)
<DT> All You Need Is Love:
<DD>	(see Magical Mystery Tour)
</DL>
<DT> Abbey Road album:
<DD> The cover shows the Beatles walking across Abbey Road.  John is dressed in
white, as the preacher. Ringo is dressed as pallbearer, Paul, who is out of
step, barefoot, and holding a cigarette in his right hand when he is a left
hander, is the corpse.  And George is dressed like the grave digger.  A 
Volkswagon has a license plate that says "28 if", meaning, Paul would be
28 if he were alive.  On the back, the word "Beatles" is broken, and a
glimpse of a woman (Rita?!) can be seen walking by.

<DT> Abbey Road lyrics:
<DD>
<DL>
<DT> Come Together:
<DD>	"..he say I know you, you know me.." "he got early warning.."
	"..he say one and one and one is three.  Got to be good looking
	cause he's so hard to see.."
<DT> You Never Give Me Your Money:
<DD>	"..one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, all good children go
	to heaven.."
</DL>
The song "You Know My Name, Look Up The Number" was released on the flipside
of "Let It Be" (45 rpm).  This strange song has a cuckoo clock that "cuckoos"
5 quick times just before another phone number is read off.  This number gave
us the "beware of Abbey Road" message each time we called.
</DL>
That about wraps it up.  I'm sure that there are other clues out there that
I am/was not aware of, or have simply forgotten.  I also remember someone
trying to verify that the vocal patterns of Paul's voice were the same when
he sang "Yesterday" and "Lady Madonna", but found that they were different
voices instead!  It's all too much..
<P>
Oh yeah, almost forgot.  The song "I'll Follow The Sun" has some hints of
what was to come when Paul sings "..someday, you'll look to see I've gone.."
<H2>More from Scott Slavin....</H2>
Worried about losing their public or something, the Beatles decided to
hide the death and get a replacement for public appearances.  The
replacement was named . . . Billy Shears.  I don't remember the
supposed chronology, but I think it was just before the release of
Sgt. Pepper.  In any case, John was haunted by Paul's death, because
he felt that if he had been there (or whatever) Paul wouldn't have
been driving where the accident happened.
<P>
There was no person "Billy Shears", the Beatles were using a play on
words to express that William Campbell was in the group:
<P>
Billy Shears = BillyS hears = Billys hear = Billys here
<P>
Get it!!  Billy is there, and the Beatles were introducing him.
<P>
Don't we all read books on such pointless matters.  William Campbell is
the guy who won the Paul McCartney lookalike contest, but he was
not announce as the winner in 1965 (? on the year)  He became friends
with the Beatles and had some plastic surgery (yeah sure like I believe
this stuff too).  
<P>
I, you, he, she and everybody else knows it was a publicity stunt.  Not
that the Beatles will admit it, but it benefitted them.  It made there
albums sell more.
<P>
Now lets get on with some more serious matters.  Like John Lennon death
clues.  Like the one on the Magical Mystery Tour.  If you look at ( I
don't remember the page number) the booklet that came with the older
MMT albums there is a picture of John and a sign next to him stating
"The best way to go is by  MD&C"  Obviously MD and C means
Mark David Chapman.  Go ahead look, I ain't jokin'. 
</P>
<H2>Yet More Clues!!!</H2>
<DL>
<DT>on the Sgt. Pepper cover:
<DD>the interior of the small car held by the doll is blood red; was it 
like this when paul's head was crushed or whatever happened to him?
<P>
paul is the only beatle facing directly forward, supposedly because the 
others were posing with a life-size cut-out of him for the cover photo.
<P>
the "younger" paul is consoling the "younger" ringo, who looks like 
he's looking down into a grave (all four of them are looking down like 
that)
<P>	
the flowers in the shape of the bass are actually over what is supposed 
to be paul's grave, and the bass looks peculiarly like the one paul 
played most often; it's even supposedly left-handed.
<P>
paul is the only beatle to be holding a black instrument; an english 
horn, which is also the only one of the four of them holding an 
instrument not from a marching band.
<P>
one of the patches of yellow flowers looks like a flaming car going off 
a cliff; i think it's the patch that the little doll is looking at.
<P>
"day in the life"
	often claimed to be the song john wrote immediately after paul died.  
clearly the whole first verse talks about exactly what everyone thought 
were the circumstances of paul's death.  Some people will tell you that 
the big orchestral build ups are somwhow representative of the car 
crash; and that the big final chord at the end sounds like the musical 
interpretation of slamming a coffin shut.  I know they used to give me 
the creeps, with or without the hoax stuff.</DD>
<DT>
magical mystery tour: the movie and photos
<DD>	there's one album photo from the movie that shows the group standing 
outside of a large stone structure.  this structure is paul's tomb.  
also, the white-capped "eggmen" in the background were the surgeons who 
tried to save paul.
<P>
paul is pictured as the fool on the hill with a crushed hat (head 
injuries???).
<P>
although what scott slavin said about mark david chapman was pretty 
wild, "the best way to go is by md&c" is believed by hoax buffs to refer 
to one of the more widely known english funeral parlours -- could this 
have been the company that handled paul's burial????
<P>
the subtitle of "i am the walrus" is "'no you're not!,' said little 
nicola, because as we find out in "glass onion" the walrus is not john, 
it WAS paul.
<P>
"i am the walrus" lyrics:
<UL>
<LI>	john sings "goo goo goo joob", which are supposedly (where they get 
this from, i have no idea) humpty dumpty's last words before he fell off 
the wall and broke his *head*.
<LI>	"choking smoke" -- from the crash and fire?
<LI>	"Pretty little policemen in a row" -- the infamous meter maid???
<LI>	"Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog's eye" -- not to get 
vulgar, but maybe paul's brain dripping from his cracked head??
</UL>
"hello, goodbye" lyrics:
<UL><LI>	"You say stop and I say go go go, oh no" -- the circumstances 
surrounding paul's accident??
<LI>	"Why why why why why why do you say goodbye goodbye, oh no?" -- why did 
paul die??
</UL>
<DT>white album liner photos
<DD>	i believe one of the album photos shows a lifeless paul floating in a 
tub of water.  there is some dark substance around his mouth.  this 
could be a photo of the body being washed/prepared for burial.
<P>
<B>lyrics<B><BR>
	don't pass me by:
			ringo sings: "you were in a car crash, and you lost your hair"

	while my guitar gently weeps:
			george can supposedly be heard in the song's fade-out saying "oh 
paul, oh paul"

	martha my dear:
			"Hold your hand out you silly girl see what you've done" -- more 
reference to the meter maid??  (see what she's done?)

	blackbird:
		"Take these sunken eyes and learn to see" -- reference to paul's 
condidtion?

	i will:
			"For if I ever saw you; I didn't catch your name; But it never really 
mattered; I will always feel the same." -- if he ever saw this meter 
maid, he never caught her name, but it never really mattered because now 
he's dead???
<DT>
abbey road cover:
<DD>	paul is barefoot because that's how many corpses were buried in 
england.  his eyes are closed.
<P>
let it be lyrics:
<UL>
<LI>	"when i find myself in times of trouble; mother mary comes to me"
<LI>	"i wake up to the sound of music; mother mary comes to me"
<LI>	"in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me"
<LI>	"when the night is cloudy; there is still a light that shines on me"
<LI>	"when the broken-hearted people (paul's friends and family?); *living* 
in the world agree"
<LI>	"for though *they* (the beatles????!?!?!?) may be PARTED; there is 
still a chance that they will see"
</UL>
these could all be references to paul departing from this world.  "let 
it be" could be another way of saying "rest in peace".  the whole song 
has a very sorrowful feeling to it, and as you can see, every line of 
every verse can be twisted into a "clue".
<P>
get back:
		the second verse is about a transvestite, someone pretending to be 
what he is not; metaphor for billy campbell pretending to be paul?
<P>
long and winding road lyrics:
<UL>
<LI>	"the wild and windy night; that the rain washed away; has left a pool 
of tears; crying for the day" -- aside from being very poetic, could 
refer to the night/morning he "died"
<LI>	"don't leave me standing here, lead me to your door" -- don't leave 
paul where he is, lead him into the afterlife????
<LI>	"the long and winding road" could just be a metaphor for life, leading 
to the "door" of death, which is where paul had gone.
</UL>
One point my parents (who lived through this and say that if the 
"current" Paul Mccartney were to admit to the hoax tomorrow, they would 
"not be surprised") brought up was this: Paul was with Jane Asher for 
such a long time; then all of a sudden he's marrying Linda Eastman.  
they both remember being very surprised at the suddenness of his 
marriage (maybe William Campbell was dating Linda Eastman already??).
<P>
Paul didn't have much family left, so there wasn't much question of 
being able to keep family leaks under control.
<P>
Some people seem to think that Billy Campbell is a couple of inches 
TALLER than the "real" Paul.  They would argue that part of the reason 
the Beatles stopped touring was to minimize the chance that people would 
notice the physical difference between the two.
<P>
John was supposedly haunted by Paul's death because the wreck was said 
to have happened after Paul left the studios angry, following a fight 
with the rest of the group.  He stormed out, and the rest is either 
history or fiction, depending on your opinion.
<P>
all of which just goes to show how ridiculous this stuff is; you can 
twist anything into evidence that Mccartney died.
</P>

Missing/extra/wrong brackets are a common problem when creating a
tcl/tk program (at least for me anyway). tclCheck is a VERY SIMPLE C
program that carries out a sanity check for brackets and their
nesting. Why a C program? The original was a tcl program but it was
simply too slow when run on large files.
<P>
tcl's rules for nesting and bracketing are pretty bizarre and are very
context dependent, so tclCheck takes a rather conservative view and
will flag things that may not in fact be errors. This generally occurs
inside strings, so that ":-(" throws up an error on the (. If you want
to shut tclCheck up put a \ in front of any troublesome characters.
The program does try to recognise when it might be inside in a comment
as people do seem to write things like :
<P>
  # 1) blah blah blah
<P>
If you want to turn off this behaviour invoke tclCheck with the -c
flag.
<P>
Simple bracket matching is not all that useful for finding a missing
bracket, so tclCheck provides two other flags that might help you
track them down. The -s outputs onto stout a line numbered skeleton
of the program. That is it outputs only leading whitespace on lines
and any brackets that they may contain. Lines with no brackets will
not be listed. The -m option provides the extra facility that where
brackets pair up directly they will not be printed either, so the
listing will only contain those brackets which are not matched on the
line on which they occur. Note that the -sm picture may not be quite
right where " " pairs occur next to each other. Even further
compression of the output will be obtained by using or adding the -l
flag which will remove nested lines which pair up. Using the -j flag
is similar to -l but ignores any indentation scheme which might work
better for you.
<P>
tclCheck will now pop its bracket stack to find a match with } &gt; ] &gt;
). If you do not want this to happen specify the -g flag.
<P>
The -i flag turns off error messages that begin "Inside a string".
The -q option will generate output only when it detects a problem
(except if any if the -jlms flags are set - the skeleton is always printed).
<P>
tclCheck checks all the files passed on the command line or the
standard input if this is empty. Messages about potential problems are
sent to the standard output.
<P>
I have run tclCheck over some of the larger packages in the archive
and it seems to behave in a sensible manner. In fact it finds what
appear to me to be errors in some of them. You may need to try various
combinations of flags to locate particular errors. tclCheck is most
definitely geared towards the way that I format programs and so it
works well for me (particularly the -lms options). You may have a
different style and if I can include this in some way let me know.
<P>
Thanks to Hans Stoop (hast@wmt.nl) for the stack popping code (which I
messed up but have now fixed....)
<P>
You can get the code by ftp from catless.ncl.ac.uk or else

<DD>This is a wonderful service.  As a child, I had to deal with pet loss, my parents did most of the work.  Now, as an adult, I had no idea what they did.  When I lost my kitty Floyd, I wanted everyone to share in his memory.  The more people who know about him, the more his life is celebrated, and the more he knows how much I love and miss him.  Hopefully, he will think of me more, too! Thank you for providing this opportunity.  Each day I feel more comforted, and closer to Floyd than ever.  JZ<P>

<H3>Introduccion</H3>

En 1945 se formo una seccion de geofisica en el actual Instituto de Geologia de la Universidad
Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. Y no es sino hasta marzo de 1949 que el Consejo Universitario
decidio crear el Instituto de Geofisica, como una respuesta a la importante evolucion que
tuvieron las tecnicas de medicion y tratamiento de datos geofisicos a escala planetaria.

Las investigaciones en el Instituto tienen como finalidad principal el estudio de la Tierra en sus
diferentes partes: solida, liquida y gaseosa, asi como el estudio de la influencia que, sobre
nuestro planeta y el espacio circunterrestre, tiene el sol por medio de sus radiaciones,
utilizando para ello diversas tecnicas y disciplinas basicas como son la fisica, la quimica y las matematicas. Aunadas a los estudios cientificos que realiza normalmente el Instituto de
Geofisica, existen importantes acciones dirigidas hacia la solucion de problemas economicos y sociales a nivel nacional, tales como: la exploracion y explotacion de recursos naturales no
renovables, la conservacion y uso de acuiferos, la proteccion civil ante fenomenos sismicos,
erupciones volcanicas, huracanes y otros riesgos geologicos, asi como en la planeacion del
desarrollo urbano, rural e industrial.
<p>

Debido al elevado desarrollo de las ciencias geofisicas en los ultimos 15 anos, se han abierto y confirmado diversos campos de accion de estas. Asi, los 101 miembros que conforman el
personal academico del Instituto (65 Investigadores y 36 Tecnicos Academicos) han sido
agrupados en cuatro departamentos: Fisica Espacial, Geomagnetisrno y Exploracion,
Recursos Naturales, y Sismologia y Vulcanologia, quienes desarrollan aspectos basicos
del campo de la geofisica y la geoquimica, incluyendo el desarrollo de tecnologia y de
infraestructura necesarias en las investigaciones de punta. Los miembros del personal
academico realizan sus labores a traves de mas de 55 proyectos de investigacion y de
desarrollo de tecnologia e infraestructura, siendo la mayoria de estos acordados con diferentes instituciones y empresas privadas, asi como con algunas secretarias de Estado.
<p>

Los cuatro departamentos que conforman la estructura del Instituto cuentan con diferentes
laboratorios, servicios geofisicos y observatorios para realizar estudios e investigaciones sobre los diferentes campos de la geofisica. Las labores de investigacion y docencia estan apoyadas ademas por una biblioteca con mas de 2000 titulos de libros y revistas especializadas, una seccion editorial responsable de la publicacion trimestral de la revista Geofisica Intemacional, de diversas publicaciones y folletos de difusion de las ciencias geofisicas. Existe igualmente una unidad de computo con diferentes equipos y perifericos interconectados en red, lo cual permite brindar ayuda en la solucion de diversos problemas informaticos, asi como mantener una comunicacion estrecha entre el Instituto y diversas universidades nacionales e internacionales.
<p>

El Instituto de Geofisica realiza anualmente mas de 20 actividades diferentes de intercambio
academico, incluyendo el desarrollo conjunto de proyectos de investigacion con universidades
e instituciones nacionales y extranjeras; asi como la asistencia de profesores visitantes quienes realizan estancias de entre 1 y 8 semanas. De Igual manera, el Instituto recibe en su seno candidatos nacionales o extranjeros para capacitacion especializada en areas como
sismologia, vulcanologia, geofisica de exploracion, recursos naturales, paleomagnetismo o
geoquimica.

<B>Observatorio de Rayos Cosmicos</B><BR>
Tiene por objeto monitorear la intensidad de la Radiaci&oacute;n C&oacute;smica
que llega continuamente a la Tierra desde el espacio. La Estaci&oacute;n
cuenta con un Monitor de Neutrones 6NM64 y un sistema multidireccional de
telescopios de mesones. Su funcionamiento ha sido continuo desde 1990. Este
Monitor detecta la parte media del espectro de Rayos Cosmicos a partir de
los 8.5 GV, que es la energia umbral de la Ciudad de MexicoEste instrumento
permite conocer el estado de perturbaciones del medio interplanetario y
del entorno magn&eacute;tico de la Tierra, lo que es de suma importancia
en la determinaci&oacute;n de la incidencia de radiaci&oacute;n c&oacute;smica
tanto en la alta atm&oacute;sfera como a nivel de la superficie. Hasta el
momento se han publicado cuadernillos con los datos horarios y las graficas
correspondientes a los anios 1990-1994. En breve estara listo el cuadernillo
de 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<B><A HREF="/ors/ors-red.html">Observatorio de Radiaci&oacute;n Solar</A></B><BR>
El Observatorio de Radiaci&oacute;n Solar dentro de sus funciones como Centro
Regional de Radiaci&oacute;n, ofrece a profesionales e instituciones de
los pa&iacute;ses miembros de la AR-IV, usuarios de instrumental para medir
radiaci&oacute;n solar, su servicio de referenciaci&oacute;n de pirheliometros
y piranometros (radi&oacute;metros en general) contra instrumentos de referencia
est&aacute;ndar, reconocidos por la Orgaizacion Meteorologica Mundial.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Radiointerfer&oacute;metro solar </B><BR>
Es de base peque&ntilde;a con longitud de onda de 4 cm, el cual permite
estudiar la componente lentamente variable de la emisi&oacute;n de microondas
del Sol, particularmente de regiones activas.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Estaci&oacute;n de Radiosondeo</B><BR>
Su fincionamiento se basa en la reflexi&oacute;n de las ondas de radio en
las capas ionizadas de la atm&oacute;sfera (ionosfera), permite la determinaci&oacute;n
de la concentraci&oacute;n electr&oacute;nica en funci&oacute;n de la altura.
Su utilidad fundamental es el monitoreo de la ionosfera sobre M&eacute;xico
y la posibilidad de llevar a cabo estudios morfol&oacute;gicos y comparativos
de la misma. Los par&aacute;metros fundamentales que se manejan dentro de
esta Estaci&oacute;n son: potencia pico de salida de 10KW, frecuencia del
pulso de 30 Hz, barrido de 1.5 a 20 MHz en 12 segundos y con una escala
logar&iacute;tmica de frecuencias. La Estaci&oacute;n est&aacute; integrada
a la Red Mundial de Estaciones de Radiosondeo Ionosf&eacute;rico.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Observatorio de Micropulsaciones Magn&eacute;ticas </B><BR>
Se ubica en Teoloyucan, Estado de M&eacute;xico. Las observaciones y mediciones
realizadas aqu&iacute; permiten estudiar el acoplamiento del viento solar
con la magnetosfera terrestre, as&iacute; como, los procesos magnetosf&eacute;ricos
e ionosf&eacute;ricos internos.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Observatorio de Centelleo Interplanetario</B><BR>
En el se encuentra actualmente operando un arreglo prototipo, dentro de
las instalaciones de la estaci&oacute;n de Teoloyucan, Estado de M&eacute;xico.
Uno de los prop&oacute;sitos principales de este observatorio es el de formar
una red mundial con otros arreglos semejantes existentes en Inglaterra,
India y Brasil, para establecer un sistema de alarma de tormentas geomagn&eacute;ticas.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Laboratorio de Radioactividad Natural y Activacion</B><BR>
Cuenta con un sistema de deteccion por centelleo y analizador multicanal
de 4k con capacidad de acceso para 60 detectores que son suficientes para
una planta nucleoelectrica. En este laboratorio se determina la radiactividad
natural que poseen las rocas, suelos y aguas, asi como la identificacion
de los diferentes radioisotopos que producen dicha radiacion en un futuro
proximo se empezara ha hacer fechamiento de material geologico joven mediante
el metodo de uranio-torio y analisis por activacion con neutrones.<BR>

<BR>
<B>Observatorio de Rayos Cosmicos</B><BR>
Tiene por objeto monitorear la intensidad de la Radiaci&oacute;n C&oacute;smica
que llega continuamente a la Tierra desde el espacio. La Estaci&oacute;n
cuenta con un Monitor de Neutrones 6NM64 y un sistema multidireccional de
telescopios de mesones. Su funcionamiento ha sido continuo desde 1990. Este
Monitor detecta la parte media del espectro de Rayos Cosmicos a partir de
los 8.5 GV, que es la energia umbral de la Ciudad de MexicoEste instrumento
permite conocer el estado de perturbaciones del medio interplanetario y
del entorno magn&eacute;tico de la Tierra, lo que es de suma importancia
en la determinaci&oacute;n de la incidencia de radiaci&oacute;n c&oacute;smica
tanto en la alta atm&oacute;sfera como a nivel de la superficie. Hasta el
momento se han publicado cuadernillos con los datos horarios y las graficas
correspondientes a los anios 1990-1994. En breve estara listo el cuadernillo
de 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<B><A HREF="/ors/ors-red.html">Observatorio de Radiaci&oacute;n Solar</A></B><BR>
El Observatorio de Radiaci&oacute;n Solar dentro de sus funciones como Centro
Regional de Radiaci&oacute;n, ofrece a profesionales e instituciones de
los pa&iacute;ses miembros de la AR-IV, usuarios de instrumental para medir
radiaci&oacute;n solar, su servicio de referenciaci&oacute;n de pirheliometros
y piranometros (radi&oacute;metros en general) contra instrumentos de referencia
est&aacute;ndar, reconocidos por la Orgaizacion Meteorologica Mundial.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Radiointerfer&oacute;metro solar </B><BR>
Es de base peque&ntilde;a con longitud de onda de 4 cm, el cual permite
estudiar la componente lentamente variable de la emisi&oacute;n de microondas
del Sol, particularmente de regiones activas.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Estaci&oacute;n de Radiosondeo</B><BR>
Su fincionamiento se basa en la reflexi&oacute;n de las ondas de radio en
las capas ionizadas de la atm&oacute;sfera (ionosfera), permite la determinaci&oacute;n
de la concentraci&oacute;n electr&oacute;nica en funci&oacute;n de la altura.
Su utilidad fundamental es el monitoreo de la ionosfera sobre M&eacute;xico
y la posibilidad de llevar a cabo estudios morfol&oacute;gicos y comparativos
de la misma. Los par&aacute;metros fundamentales que se manejan dentro de
esta Estaci&oacute;n son: potencia pico de salida de 10KW, frecuencia del
pulso de 30 Hz, barrido de 1.5 a 20 MHz en 12 segundos y con una escala
logar&iacute;tmica de frecuencias. La Estaci&oacute;n est&aacute; integrada
a la Red Mundial de Estaciones de Radiosondeo Ionosf&eacute;rico.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Observatorio de Micropulsaciones Magn&eacute;ticas </B><BR>
Se ubica en Teoloyucan, Estado de M&eacute;xico. Las observaciones y mediciones
realizadas aqu&iacute; permiten estudiar el acoplamiento del viento solar
con la magnetosfera terrestre, as&iacute; como, los procesos magnetosf&eacute;ricos
e ionosf&eacute;ricos internos.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Observatorio de Centelleo Interplanetario</B><BR>
En el se encuentra actualmente operando un arreglo prototipo, dentro de
las instalaciones de la estaci&oacute;n de Teoloyucan, Estado de M&eacute;xico.
Uno de los prop&oacute;sitos principales de este observatorio es el de formar
una red mundial con otros arreglos semejantes existentes en Inglaterra,
India y Brasil, para establecer un sistema de alarma de tormentas geomagn&eacute;ticas.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Laboratorio de Radioactividad Natural y Activacion</B><BR>
Cuenta con un sistema de deteccion por centelleo y analizador multicanal
de 4k con capacidad de acceso para 60 detectores que son suficientes para
una planta nucleoelectrica. En este laboratorio se determina la radiactividad
natural que poseen las rocas, suelos y aguas, asi como la identificacion
de los diferentes radioisotopos que producen dicha radiacion en un futuro
proximo se empezara ha hacer fechamiento de material geologico joven mediante
el metodo de uranio-torio y analisis por activacion con neutrones.<BR>

<H3>Departamento de Recursos Naturales</H3>

Este departamento fue creado con el fin de realizar estudios e investigaciones dentro de los campos de la hidrogeologia, la geotermia, la geoquimica de aguas, la modelacion matematica de fluidos en medios porosos y el estudio de la difusion de contaminantes en acuiferos. Especificamente, los 10 Investigadores y 3 Tecnicos Academicos que laboran en esta parte del Instituto desarrollan actividades enfocadas hacia la exploracion y evaluacion de aguas subterraneas por medios electromagneticos, la obtencion de datos quimicos e isotopicos de aguas subterraneas, la evaluacion y comportamiento de contaminantes en acuiferos por medios geoquimicos, la modelacion numerica del comportamiento de aguas subterraneas y yacimientos petroliferos, asi como en la caracterizacion petrografica y geoquimica de sistemas hidrotermales. Cabe senalar que algunos miembros de este departamento participan activamente en proyectos internacionales de investigacion sobre el punto de impacto meteorico del crater Chixchulub, Estado de Yucatan, el cual marco probablemente el limite geologico entre dos eras diferentes: el Mesozoico y el Terciario. 
<p>

Con el fin de brindar una capacidad de invstigacion de alto nivel, el departamento cuenta con un laboratorio especializado de quimica el cual realiza diversos analisis de  materiales solidos como rocas y minerales, y de aguas naturales o de desecho urbano. El laboratorio de quimica analitica, ademas de brindar apoyo a otros departamentos, busca siempre desarrollar nuevos metodos analiticos que conduzcan a la obtencion de mas rapidos y mejores resultados dentro de la caracterizacion quimica de aguas, rocas, suelos o fluidos biologicos

<BR>
Introducci&oacute;n</B><BR>
<BR>
La F&iacute;sica Espacial se inicia como una disciplina independiente a
ra&iacute;z de las primeras exploraciones del espacio exterior por medio
de sat&eacute;lites y sondas espaciales. La imagen que se ten&iacute;a del
sistema solar antes de la exploraci&oacute;n espacial era la de un sistema
de cuerpos ligados al Sol por gravedad moviendose en un espacio esencialmente
vac&iacute;o. Esta cambiar&aacute; radicalmente a partir del descubrimiento
del viento solar, de las magnetosferas planetarias y de la enorme din&aacute;mica
que caracteriza al Sol y que se transmite al medio interplanetario y a los
planetas.<BR>
<BR>
El terreno de estudio de la F&iacute;sica Espacial es la <B><I>heliosfera</I></B>,
esta es, la regi&oacute;n del espacio interestelar controlada por el Sol
mediante el flujo del viento solar y de todos los cuerpos que se encuentran
en ella: el Sol, los planetas, sus anillos y sus sat&eacute;lites, los asteroides,
los cometas y las part&iacute;culas energ&eacute;ticas (rayos c&oacute;smicos)
que se generan o se introducen en ella. Gracias a los ya casi 40 a&ntilde;os
de exploraci&oacute;n espacial, sabemos que la corona del Sol est&aacute;
en continua expansi&oacute;n a velocidades supers&oacute;nicas (el viento
solar) y que de esta manera el Sol se extiende hasta m&aacute;s all&aacute;
de la &oacute;rbita de Plut&oacute;n. Conocemos, igualmente, que algunos
planetas, como la Tierra, presentan campos magn&eacute;ticos (magnetosferas)
que los rodean y protegen del flujo del viento solar; que el medio interplanetario
no solamente no est&aacute; vac&iacute;o, sino que el material que lo constituye
est&aacute; en estado de plasma, y que el campo magn&eacute;tico que en
el se encuentra es altamente din&aacute;mico y puede transmitir enormes
cantidades de energ&iacute;a. El Sol es muy variable, a muy diversas escalas
de tiempo, y lejos de ser una esfera homog&eacute;nea y tranquila est&aacute;
altamente estructurado por un campo magn&eacute;tico muy complejo.<BR>
<BR>
El estudio sistem&aacute;tico del Sol y del medio interplanetario ha permitido
reconocer que la actividad solar, la cual implica emisiones electromagn&eacute;ticas
en muy diversos rangos del espectro y emisiones de material en estructuras
de gran escala y en forma de part&iacute;culas de muy alta energ&iacute;a,
juega un papel predominante en diversos fen&oacute;menos observados en el
entorno terrestre. Algunos de estos fen&oacute;menos son las tormentas geomagn&eacute;ticas,
las auroras, las perturbaciones ionosf&eacute;ricas y de la alta atm&oacute;sfera;
los cuales est&aacute;n probablemente relacionados con alteraciones clim&aacute;ticas
que se reflejan en menor o mayor grado en la modificaci&oacute;n de ecosistemas.<BR>
<BR>
El viento solar constituye la &uacute;nica muestra accesible del plasma
estelar a gran escala el cual se puede estudiar <I>in situ</I> y en detalle,
y que puede ser representativo de lo que debe estar ocurriendo en otras
estrellas. Adem&aacute;s, los rayos c&oacute;smicos gal&aacute;cticos (principalmente
nucleones de muy alta energ&iacute;a) constituyen las &uacute;nicas muestras
accesibles de material externo a la heliosfera y sirven como sensores de
la estructura magn&eacute;tica y de las perturbaciones en el interior de
la misma.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>L&iacute;neas de investigaci&oacute;n<BR>
</B><BR>
Entre los objetivos principales de investigaci&oacute;n en el Departamento
de F&iacute;sica Espacial se encuentran los siguientes:<BR>
<BR>
- El campo magn&eacute;tico y la actividad del Sol.<BR>
- El viento solar y el medio interplanetario.<BR>
- La ionosfera y la magnetosfera de la Tierra.<BR>
- La interacci&oacute;n del viento solar con las magnetosferas y las ionosferas
planetarias y con los cometas.<BR>
- Las perturbaciones interplanetarias y su efecto sobre la Tierra.<BR>
- La generaci&oacute;n y propagaci&oacute;n de part&iacute;culas energ&eacute;ticas
y rayos c&oacute;smicos en la heliosfera.<BR>
- Las relaciones entre la actividad solar y el clima.<BR>
<BR>
Adem&aacute;s, se pretende abrir a mediano plazo la l&iacute;nea de planetolog&iacute;a,
para la cual se est&aacute;n preparando ya algunos estudiantes.<BR>

<H3>Objetivos:</H3>
Realizar investigaci&oacute;n en el campo de los procesos de interacci&oacute;n
de la radiaci&oacute;n solar con la atm&oacute;sfera, sus componentes, as&iacute;
como sus implicaciones energ&eacute;ticas de conservaci&oacute;n y aprovechamiento.<BR>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=Top SRC="/ors/PIR-4.GIF"></P>

<H3>Antecedentes:</H3>
Los antecedentes de los estudios de radiaci&oacute;n solar en nuestro pa&iacute;s
pueden situarse en los a&ntilde;os de 1911 a 1928, cuando el investigador
de origen polaco Ladislaw Gorczynski realiz&oacute; mediciones actin&oacute;metricas
en el Observatorio Meteorol&oacute;gico de Tacubaya y otros lugares del
mundo para determinar las caracter&iacute;sticas de la radiaci&oacute;n
solar a nivel de superficie con ayuda de un sensor desarrollado por &eacute;l
mismo (termopila de Gorcynsky).<BR>
<BR>
Entre los investigadores nacionales que iniciaron los trabajos de investigaci&oacute;n
en este campo podemos mencionar al Ing. Jes&uacute;s Mart&iacute;nez G.
y al Dr. Ignacio Galindo Estrada miembros del Instituto de Ciencia Aplicada,
que m&aacute;s tarde se incorporara al Instituto de Geof&iacute;sica de
la UNAM. Instituto.<BR>
<BR>
En el a&ntilde;o de 1956 empiezan a efectuarse mediciones de radiaci&oacute;n
solar en el Instituto de Ciencia Aplicada auspiciado por la UNESCO con donaciones
de equipo de diversos pa&iacute;ses participantes del A&ntilde;o Geof&iacute;sico
Internacional, y adquisiciones del propio Instituto; se realiza mediciones
de: duraci&oacute;n de la insolaci&oacute;n, radiaci&oacute;n global, radiaci&oacute;n
difusa y radiaci&oacute;n directa (flujos totales). Estas observaciones
reciben validaci&oacute;n internacional gracias a la adquisici&oacute;n
de un pirheliom&eacute;tro patr&oacute;n (Pirheli&oacute;metro de Compensaci&oacute;n
de Angstr&ouml;m, No. 166, del Servicio Meteorol&oacute;gico sueco) y de
un pirheli&oacute;metro est&aacute;ndar, de disco de plata, Abbot No. 13.
Esto permiti&oacute; que el Observatorio de Radiaci&oacute;n Solar de Ciudad
Universitaria pudiera ser considerado oficialmente dentro de los puntos
de observaci&oacute;n de la Red Actinom&eacute;trica Mundial. As&iacute;
mismo, con la adquisici&oacute;n del Espectofot&oacute;metro Dobson No.
98, comienza la participaci&oacute;n de nuestro pa&iacute;s en la Red Ozonom&eacute;trica
Mundial. Adem&aacute;s del Observatorio de Radiaci&oacute;n Solar de Ciudad
Universitaria, se han tenido estaciones solarim&eacute;tricas en Mezcala,
Gro., Chilpancingo, Gro., Chihuahua, Chih., Altzomoni, Edo. de M&eacute;x.,
Laguna del Rey, Coah. y Orizabita, Hgo. De &eacute;stas, la que contin&uacute;a
en operaci&oacute;n es la &uacute;ltima de ellas.<BR>
<BR>
El grupo de radiaci&oacute;n solar ha tenido una participaci&oacute;n activa
en experimentos tanto nacionales como internacionales, cont&aacute;ndose
entre ellos cruceros oceanogr&aacute;ficos al Atl&aacute;ntico Tropical,
Mar Caribe, Golfo de M&eacute;xico, Oc&eacute;ano Pac&iacute;fico, Golfo
de California y experimentos especiales en San Luis Potos&iacute;, SLP,
Toluca, Edo. de M&eacute;x., Laguna Verde, Ver., Cholula, Pue., La Paz,
BCS, Sierra de la Laguna, BCS y Casey, Ant&aacute;rtica.<BR>
<BR>
La actividad observacional se ha visto complementada con una sistem&aacute;tica
labor de calibraci&oacute;n y control de equipos de radiaci&oacute;n solar,
tanto del Instituto de Geof&iacute;sica como de otras instituciones. Los
pirheliometros est&aacute;ndar se han venido comparando regularmente con
los est&aacute;ndares internacionales del Centro Mundial de Radiaci&oacute;n
de Davos, Suiza. La experiencia adquirida en este terreno ha sido decisiva
para el reconocimiento del Instituto de Geof&iacute;sica como Centro Regional
de Medici&oacute;n Mundial en el a&ntilde;o de 1986.<BR>
<BR>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=Top SRC="/ors/PIRRITO.GIF"></P>

El material observacional obtenido tanto en las mediciones de rutina como
en los experimentos particulares, oce&aacute;nicos y en tierra firme, ha
sido b&aacute;sico para el desarrollo de las l&iacute;neas de investigaci&oacute;n
del grupo. Se han hecho contribuciones, en forma de presentaciones en congresos
y otras reuniones cient&iacute;ficas, en el campo de los procesos energ&eacute;ticos
de la radiaci&oacute;n solar a nivel de superficie: balance radiacional
y aprovechamiento y evaluaci&oacute;n del recurso solar; en el &aacute;rea
de la interacci&oacute;n de la radiaci&oacute;n solar con los diferentes
medios geof&iacute;sicos,, por ejemplo estudios de propagaci&oacute;n de
la radiaci&oacute;n solar en la atm&oacute;sfera y el oc&eacute;ano; en
el &aacute;rea de la contaminaci&oacute;n ambiental a trav&eacute;s de estudios
de la turbiedad atmosf&eacute;rica causada pos gases y part&iacute;culas;
en el campo de la variabilidad clim&aacute;tica con trabajos sobre la influencia
de fen&oacute;menos clim&aacute;ticos espec&iacute;ficos sobre el campo
radiacional en la superficie y el an&aacute;lisis estad&iacute;stico de
las series de tiempo, meteorol&oacute;gicas y radiacionales, observadas.<BR>
<BR>
Actualmente se trabaja en la conjugaci&oacute;n de esfuerzos con investigadores
rusos y norteamericanos, en colaboraci&oacute;n con el grupo de Ingenier&iacute;a
Aerospacial del II UNAM, para desarrollar una metodolog&iacute;a que permita
el monitoreo de la poluci&oacute;n atmosf&eacute;rica en la ciudad de M&eacute;xico
con observaciones de superficie, a&eacute;rea (a bordo de helic&oacute;pteros)
y satelitarios.<BR>

<H1>Observatorio Magn&eacute;tico de Teoloyucan</H1>

<B>Mas de un siglo de observaciones magn&eacute;ticas.</B><BR>
<JUSTIFY>
Las observaciones magn&eacute;ticas en M&eacute;xico se remontan hacia finales 
del siglo XVIII hechas por Antonio Alzate y Alejandro von Humbolt y a principio 
del siglo XIX dentro de la Escuela de Miner&iacute;a. El primer observatorio 
magn&eacute;tico en forma fue instalado en el Palacio Nacional en 1879 dentro 
del Observatorio Meteorol&oacute;gico y Magn&eacute;tico Central operando con 
un magnet&oacute;metro unifilar Tompson (H y D) y una br&uacute;jula 
Negretti-Zambra (I) funcionando hasta mayo de 1887 debido a las modificaciones 
en la construcci&oacute;n del edificio que lo albergaba.<BR>
En abril de 1889 en el Observatorio Astron&oacute;mico de Tacubaya se 
instal&oacute; un pabell&oacute;n para observaciones magn&eacute;ticas con 
un magnet&oacute;metro Elliot-Dover (H y D), una br&uacute;jula Negretti-Zambra 
(I) y un juego de vari&oacute;grafos Carpentier de registro continuo. 
La instalaci&oacute;n en 1902 de la linea de tranvias el&eacute;ctricos 
oblig&oacute; al cierre del pabell&oacute;n.<BR>
En 1903 se cambi&oacute; el equipo al pueblo de Cuajimalpa, sin embargo en 1911 
al prolongarse la linea de tranv&iacute;as cerca del observatorio oblig&oacute; 
a mudarse una vez m&aacute;s. 
El nuevo observatorio se instal&oacute; junto al Palacio Municipal del Pueblo 
de Teoloyucan, 36 km al norte de la ciudad de M&eacute;xico, operando con el 
equipo traido desde Cuajimalpa. En 1921 se adquirieron vari&oacute;grafos 
Mascart, un magnet&oacute;metro Dover, un galvan&oacute;metro Edelman y una 
balanza magn&eacute;tica. Para 1929 se adquiri&oacute; un magnet&oacute;metro 
C.I.W. y en 1931 los vari&oacute;grafos Eschenhagen de la casa Askania 
(D, H y Z). En 1949 con la fundaci&oacute;n del Instituto de Geof&iacute;sica 
el observatorio pas&oacute; a formar parte de &eacute;ste.<BR>
La remodelaci&oacute;n en la estructura del Palacio Municipal en 1978 
afecto las mediciones y se hizo una vez m&aacute;s el cambio. Para la nueva 
<A HREF="/geomagne/omt/omt-loc.html">localizaci&oacute;n</A>
se tom&oacute; en cuenta el per&iacute;odo de observaciones magn&eacute;ticas 
medidas en el lugar. As&iacute; se eligi&oacute; un terreno junto al pante&oacute;n 
municipal en las afueras del pueblo, operandose con el mismo 
<A HREF="/geomagne/omt/equipo.html">equipo cl&aacute;sico</A> de 
registro continuo y adem&aacute;s magnet&oacute;metros QHM, de prot&oacute;n 
Geometrics y RUSKA, los cuales se encuentran funcionando hasta la fecha.<BR>
A partir de julio de 1996 se encuentran operando dos equipos digitales instalados
durante el Encuentro Latinoamreicano de Instrumentaci&oacute;n Geomagn&eacute;tica
(<A HREF="/geomagne/omt/elig96/elig96.html">ELIG 96</A>). El primero de
estos, dise&ntilde;ado y contruido por el Dr. Jean Rasson y Teotonio Ferreira en el
<I>Observatoire Magn&eacute;tique de Dourbes</I>, es un teodolito no magn&eacute;tico
RUSKA convertido a un magnet&oacute;metro DI-flux para observaciones absolutas y
un vari&oacute;grafo fluxgate de dos componentes (DI, bautizado como LAMA) que operan
junto a un PPM Geometrics G856; el segundo es un vari&oacute;grafo fluxgate de tres
componentes FGE (DHZ, bautizado como DMI) que pertenece al
<A HREF="http://www.dmi.dk/Welcome-uk.html"><I>Danish Meteorological Institute</I></A>
instalado por el Dr. Ole Rassmussen que operar&aacute; por un per&iacute;odo
de 2 a&ntilde;os en TEO.<BR>
Tanto <B>LAMA</B> como <B>DMI</B> se encuentran conectados al mismo adquisitor
y obtienen valores a cada minuto, para en un futuro poder proporcionar
valores magn&eacute;ticos en tiempo real mediante

<IMG WIDTH=220 SRC="/geomagne/omt/askania2.jpeg" ALIGN=left>
Se han realizado tres calibraciones para el equipo cl&aacute;sico desde 
la operaci&oacute;n en Teoloyucan.
La primera fue en 1954 cuando se enviaron los vari&oacute;grafos al U. S. 
Coast and Geodetic Survey (ahora el U. S. Defense Mapping Agency) para la 
instalaci&oacute;n de imanes compensadores de temperatura. Durante 1971 y 1972 
se realiz&oacute; la calibraci&oacute;n en el observatorio con instrumentos 
del Inter-American Geodetic Survey (IAGS, ya desaparecido). 
Y la &uacute;ltima se realiz&oacute; en 1991 bajo el auspicio del 
<A HREF="http://www.spin.com.mx/~ipgh/">Instituto 
Panamericano de Geograf&iacute;a e Historia (IPGH)</A> con equipo del

<h2>Depto. de Geomagnetismo y Exploracion Geofisica</h2> <br>
<P>


Los 22 miembros academicos que conforman este departamento llevan a cabo actividades especificas dentro de disciplinas tales como la exploracion geofisica, geomagnetismo, geoquimica, paleomagnetismo, paleoclimas, paleoambientes y tectonofisica. Bajo este departamento se encuentran ademas el Laboratorio Universitario de Geoquimica Isotopica (LUGIS), el <A HREF="/geomagne/omt/omt.html">Observatorio Magnetico de Teoloyucan (TEO)</A> y el Laboratorio de Paleomagnetismo y Geofisica Nuclear. Las actividades del departamento presentan un marcado caracter interdisciplinario, sin embargo, las investigaciones pueden ser agrupadas en lineas de investigacion tales como: exploracion geofisica en zonas con alta densidad de poblacion o de desarrollo economico, desarrollo de tecnicas de prospeccion geofisica de yacimientos minerales, sistemas geotermicos o exploracion petrolera, determinacion de la estructura de la corteza terrestre, estudios de la frontera Cretacico/Terciario y crateres de impacto (sitio de Chixchulub), estudios de cuencas lacustres y zonas deserticas, asi como la aplicacion de la geofisica en investigaciones arqueologicas. 
<P>

Dentro de la seccion de Geomagnetismo las investigaciones estan encaminadas hacia la comprension del campo magnetico terrestre y la influencia de los eclipses, determinar el mecanismo y generacion de pulsaciones magneticas y el rastrear ondas electromagneticas de muy baja frecuencia asociadas a oscilaciones de la magnetosfera.
<P>
El nuevo Laboratorio de Geoquimica Isotopica (LUGIS) cuenta actualmente con el mas moderno equipo de espectrometria de masas con fuente solida y otros instrumentos especializados para la obtencion de datos geoquimicos. Asi en breve, se efectuaran analisis quimicos de elementos mayores y traza, mediciones de relaciones isotopicas con fines petrogeneticos y fechamientos de rocas y minerales por metodos isotopicos de Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd y U-Pb. 

<P>
En Paleomagnetismo los estudios estan centrados hacia la caracterizacion de propiedades magneticas de rocas, minerales y materiales diversos, en la realizacion de estudios de magnetoestratigrafia y tectonica, asi como para la determinacion del comportamiento y evolucion del campo magnetico terrestre. Con el fin de caracterizar las propiedades magneticas de materiales de manera muy precisa se han adquirido equipos magnetometricos modernos tales como el magnetometro criogenico y el micromagnetometro, los cuales comenzaran a aportar datos nuevos en fecha proxima. Hay que recordar que los estudios paleomagneticos regionales realizados sobre muestras de rocas de provincias geologicas particulares, permiten efectuar correlaciones estratigraficas y reconstrucciones paleogeograficas de diversos ambientes geologicos. Esto es de suma importancia para la tectonofisica ya que permite proponer modelos de tectonica de placas a escala regional o mundial que expliquen los fenomenos geologicos ocurridos.

<H2>La geoquimica isotopica en Mexico</H2>

En Mexico se han llevado a cabo estudios de geoquimica isotopica utilizando diferentes metodos basados en pares isotopicos de elementos pesados y de algunos ligeros. La utilidad de cada metodo isotopico depende del tipo de roca, edad tentativa y condiciones de formacion del cuerpo rocoso. Los primeros fechamientos isotopicos en Mexico fueron efectuados en el Instituto de Geologia de la UNAM en la decada de los sesenta (ver por ejemplo Fries y Rincon Orta, 1965). En aquel entonces, se aplico el metodo de Plomo-alfa desarrollado por E.S. Larsen. Tambien en la decada de los sesenta se comenzaron a emplear los fechamientos de K-Ar y de Rb-Sr sobre muestras de rocas de diferentes localidades del pais. Aunque no existian en Mexico las facilidades instrumentales para hacer analisis por medio de estos ultimos metodos, se recurrio a trabajos de colaboracion con grupos norteamericanos y europeos para acceder a dichos procedimientos. En las decadas de los setenta y ochenta se iniciaron metodos adicionales para el estudio de rocas mexicanas, como el U-Pb y Sm-Nd. En este tiempo fueron iniciados en el Instituto de Geologia los primeros esfuerzos por desarrollar los procedimientos analiticos para fechar rocas por los metodos del Rb-Sr y U-Pb.
<P>

<H3>El Laboratorio Universitario de Geoquimica Isotopica</H3>

A partir del interes creciente de diferentes grupos geocientificos en la UNAM, los institutos de Geofisica y Geologia de la misma universidad decidieron emprender un esfuerzo conjunto para desarrollar un Laboratorio Universitario de Geoquimica Isotopica, que pusiera al alcance de investigadores mexicanos facilidades instrumentales para llevar a cabo analisis isotopicos de alta precision. Con el objeto de lograr esto, se requirio modernizar y poner a punto diferentes tecnicas de analisis que incluyen la espectrometria de masas, la fluorescencia de rayos X, el tratamiento quimico de muestras en condiciones ultrapuras y la separacion de minerales por diversas tecnicas.
<P>

Uno de los aspectos criticos en el trabajo de puesta en marcha de un laboratorio de geoquimica isotopica es la preparacion quimica de muestras de roca en condiciones de alta pureza. Para lograr estas condiciones, se construyo un nuevo laboratorio de quimica ultrapura en las instalaciones del Instituto de Geofisica y se llevaron a cabo adaptaciones  para mejorar el laboratorio de quimica del Instituto de Geologia. Los materiales utilizados en dichos laboratorios incluyen acabados de teflon y polipropileno para evitar la corrosion y la formacion de particulas contaminantes. Otros puntos de suma importancia en un laboratorio de analisis isotopico, son la pureza del agua, del aire y de los reactivos quimicos. El agua del laboratorio debe contener muy bajas concentraciones de iones de elementos pesados, por lo que para verificar su calidad se realizan blancos analiticos espectrometricos cuyas concentraciones deberan ser inferiores a 1.5 picogramos/gramo, en los casos del Rb y Sr, para que las influencias contaminantes no sean significativas en el estudio de muestras de roca.
<P>

La preparacion de concentrados minerales, para la obtencion de datos isotopicos y su aplicacion en la solucion de problemas petrogeneticos y de geocronologia, debe realizarse con un gran cuidado de las tecnicas. Estos concentrados se logran despues de inspecciones petrograficas detalladas y de la aplicacion de tecnicas que permitan separar los minerales a partir de sus diferentes propiedades fisicas como son la densidad, susceptibilidad magnetica y forma.
<P>

A principio del presente ao fue entregada la casi totalidad de las instalaciones remodeladas y construidas del Laboratorio Universitario de Geoquimica Isotopica, dentro de los Institutos de Geofisica y Geologia. Actualmente se cuenta con una base instrumental muy importante, en la cual se puede mencionar: espectrometria de fluorescencia de rayos X de tipo dispersion longitud de onda y de fin de ventana (Fig 3.) y espectrometria de masas con fuente de ionizacion termica equipada con nueve colectores y software para la adquisicion automatica de medidas (Fig. 4). Se cuenta ademas con un espectrometro de masas de 90 de sector, equipado con un colector. Adicionalmente, se dispone de equipos para la molienda de rocas y separacion y concentracion de minerales. 
<P>

<H3>Futuro de la Geoquimica isotopica en el LUGIS</H3>

Las instalaciones y equipos del LUGIS permiten la realizacion de analisis quimicos de elementos mayores y traza de cualquier roca magmatica o metamorfica, la obtencion de relaciones isotopicas de elementos como son Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, U-Pb o de cualquier otro par de isotopos de elementos pesados contenidos en rocas de diversos tipos. Los resultados analiticos aqui obtenidos son indispensables en el fechamiento de rocas y en la caracterizacion genetica de cuerpos rocosos, los cuales sustentan en gran medida los modelos tectonicos propuestos sobre la evolucion de la corteza y en general sobre la tierra.
<P>

El desarrollo futuro de las geociencias en la UNAM y en el pais enfrenta retos insolitos, especialmente en lo relativo al conocimiento de la estructura cortical de nuestro territorio y la interpretacion sobre su desarrollo desde el Precambrico. Se requerira de la aplicacion de procedimientos cada dia mas refinados y de una vision aguda sobre los enfoques necesarios para desentraar diversos problemas de la geologia mexicana. Las facilidades analiticas que presta el Laboratorio Universitario de Geoquimica Isotopica permiten dar un paso mas en la comprension y modelado de procesos geneticos de la corteza que forma el territorio mexicano.

<H2>Remote Sensing</H2>

A laboratory for digital image processing and pattern recognition is 
currently under operation.  The laboratory is based on two PCs and a
workstation interconnected among them through internet.  Two 
laserjet printers are coupled to these computers and great number of
procedures for image analysis is available.  The emphasis is with
satellite multispectral images eventhough any digital image may be
analysed.  This laboratory is used for research on mathematical
models to study digital images and some activities of teaching are
carried as well.  A group of students, both undergraduate and graduate
are always involved in research activities. <P>

<img src="/gifs/seasat.gif">

Example of.....<P>

Recent projects developed in this laboratory are the following: <P>


* Study of sediment distribution in the area of the Panuco River plume
  by means of remote sensing. <P>


* Segmentation of textures in SAR images by region growing and entropy
  schemes. <P>

* Texture processing, analysis and coding in SAR images. <P>

* Morphology of segmented regions in SAR images by means of a region 
  growing algorithm. <P>

There is a number of students working out their thesis in the laboratory,
their names and duties are: <P>

- Alejandro Aguilar, Structure of segmented regions. <P>

- Dubhe Chavira, Automatic region growing algorithm. <P>

- Ricardo Pastrana, Geometric filter. <P>

- Jose Rodriguez, Selective filters via FFT (finished). <P>

- Francisco Vazquez, Installation and administration of KHOROS. <P>

<title>Lang and Cabral, 1996</title>
<H3>PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF AVIRIS DATA FOR TECTONOSTRATOGRAPHIC ASSESSMENT OF NORTHERN GUERRERO STATE, SOUTHERN MEXICO.</H3>

<H5>Harold R. Lang* and Enrique Cabral-Cano** </H5><P>

*Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena CA 91109, USA <BR>
**Instituto de Geofisica, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico, D.F. 04510, Mexico. <P>

<H5>Abstract presented at the Sixth JPL Airborne Annual Workshop, Pasadena, CA, March 1996. </H5>

<H4>1. PURPOSE</H4>

The tectonostratihgraphic evolution of the southern margin of the North America Plate in Mexico is still in debate. Recent explanations assert Laramide age (Campanian-Eocene) accretion of far-travelled oceanic terranes (Campa and Coney, 1983; Sedlock et al., 1993). In 1989, we began an effort to bring new data to this debate through field mapoping, incorporating Landsat Thematic Mapper and digital elevation data, along a 30 km by 250 km, east-west geologic transect of northern Guerrero State. Covering the region from Huetamo, Michoacan to Papalutla, Guerrero (between latitude 18-19N and longitude 1010-99 W), our mapping results show that no stratigraphic incompatibilities suggesting terrane accretion exist in the region (Lang et al., 1996). <P>

In November 1994, AVIRIS data were acquired along the geologic transect in order to refine our stratigraphic assessment. One objective of this hyperspectral survey was to improve mapping of limestone, dolostone and gypsum-bearing facies of the Morelos Formation which record rudis      ate platform environments during mid-Cretaceous time. <P>

<H4>2. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS</H4>

Preliminary analysis of these AVIRIS data shows that signal-to-noise is sufficiently high to allow us to map the 2.34m calcite band, the 2.30m dolimite band, and 1.20 m and 1.74 m gypsum bands using simple ratio based algorithms. When incorporated into our tectonostratigraphic model, AVIRIS-based mapping results: 1) support the existence of a coherent mid-Cretaceous depositional model system in southern Mexico, and 2) are inconsistent with proposed terrane accretion models. <P>

<h5>Resumen en extenso presentado en la Reunion 1995 de la Sociedad de Especialistas Latinoamericanos en Percepcion Remota, Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Noviembre 1995</h5>


<P>
<h4>RESUMEN </h4>
<P>

Se reporta por primera vez en Mexico la adquisicion de 6 transectos hiperespectrales utilizando el Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) y pelicula aerea infrarroja, a bordo de una aeronave ER-2 de NASA. El analisis de estas imagenes resulta de gran utilidad en  la administracion de recursos naturales y exploracion geologica, debido a su alta resolucion espectral.


<P>
<h4>1. INTRODUCCION </h4>
<P>

AVIRIS es un espectrometro de imagenes de segunda generacion desarrollado por el Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Este instrumento cuenta con un sistema optico de barrido y cuatro espectrometros para capturar imagenes, con un ancho de barrido de 614 pixels en 224 bandas espectrales contiguas. Cada una de estas bandas cubren 9.7 nm, con un rango dinamico de 10 bits, dentro del espectro de 0.41 a 2.45 m. AVIRIS vuela a bordo de una aeronave ER-2 de NASA, a una altura de 65,000 pies (19,800 m), lo que resulta en una resolucion de 20 m/pixel y un ancho de barrido de 10.6 km.


<P>
<h4>2. ADQUISICION DE DATOS </h4>
<P>

La adquisicion de imagenes AVIRIS se llevo a cabo en 6 lineas de vuelo (<A HREF="figura1.html">Figura 1</A> y <A HREF="figura2.html">Figura 2</A>) durante el mes de Noviembre de 1994 en las areas de Atenango del Rio, Teloloapan, Huetamo, Libres y los Volcanes Popocatepetl, y Pico de Orizaba, en los Estados de Guerrero, Michoacn, Puebla, Morelos, Mexico y Veracruz. Las imagenes AVIRIS se complementaron con fotografia aerea convencional (Tabla 1), utilizando una camara fotografica aerea Wild-Heerbrug RC-10 con un formato de 9x9 pulgadas, distancia focal de 304.66 mm, apertura de diafragma f11, y velocidad de 1/200 s. Esto resulto en cuadros con una superposicion del 60% y una cobertura en tierra de 12 millas nauticas. La pelicula usada (Kodak Aerochrome IR SO-060) es sensible en un rango de 510-900 nm. La cobertura total de nubes es menor al 10%.


<P>
<h4>3. RESULTADOS Y CONCLUSIONES</h4> 
<P>

La utilizacion de imagenes AVIRIS (p. ej. <A HREF="figura3.html">Figura 3</A>) permite una caracterizacion cuantitativa con un alto nivel de detalle de las propiedades espectrales de la superficie terrestre. Este analisis resulta de mucha utilidad en  la administracion de recursos naturales y exploracion geologica. La utilizacion de estas imagenes dentro del analisis de cuencas sedimentarias, con un especial enfoque al analisis estratigrafico espectral, permite la rapida determinacion de la distribucion estratigrafica de cuarzo, calcita, dolomita, yeso, y algunas especies de arcillas.

Starting in 1989, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
funded the &quot;Multispectral Analysis of the Stratigraphic/Structural
Record, SW Mexico, Project&quot;. Originally, the project was a feasibility
study to assess the applicability of methods, developed in Wyoming (Lang,
1987), for geologic mapping with the aid of remote sensing and topographic
data in the more challenging geological environment of SW Mexico. Based
on positive results from the feasibility study (e.g., Johnson et al., 1991;
Jansma et al., 1991; and Barros et al., 1989), the project goal was expanded
in 1991. Presently, the overall goal is to improve understanding of Mesozoic
continental lithosphere formation and evolution on the southern margin of
the North America plate in southwestern Mexico. This paper summarizes our
approach, selected results, and near term plans. Work is being performed
by NASA-funded investigators at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University
of Miami, in collaboration with independently funded investigators at the
Institute of Geophysics and Institute of Geology of Universidad Nacional
Autonoma de Mexico, Florida International University, University of Puerto
Rico, Southwest Texas State University, UCLA, and University of Texas at
El Paso.<BR>
<BR>
The specific objective is to test the model of Laramide, Late Cretaceous-Paleogene
accretion of the Guerrero and Mixteco terranes (Campa-Uranga and Coney,
1983) by constructing an east-west crustal traverse across the boundary
of the two terranes between latitudes 1 8&#176;N to 1 9&#176;N and longitudes
101 &#176;W to 99&#176;W. For this purpose, we have created a digital database
incorporating 28.5 m resolution and UTM-projected LANDSAT TM, gravity and
digital elevation data covering the entire study area. Thefinal productwill
be a 1:100,000 scale cross section from Huetamo, Michoacan, to Iguala, Guerrero,
and on to Papalutla, Guerrero. This 200 km long cross section is constrained
by in progress 1:50,000 scale geological mapping, radiometric dating, and
biostratigraphic studies along a 30 km wide swath that straddles the line
of section. Validity of the cross section is being tested by gravity modeling.
Plans this year include acquisition of experimental NASA aircraft data to
enhance our remote sensing database and to facilitate application of state-of-the-art
geological remote sensing methods.<BR>

<P ALIGN=center><IMG WIDTH=400 SRC="/geomagne/omt/teoloyu2.jpeg"></P>
<H1>Teoloyucan Magnetic Observatory</H1>
<JUSTIFY>
<B>More than one Century of magnetic observations.</B><BR>
The magnetic observations in M&eacute;xico come from the end of the XVIII 
century. They were done by Antonio Alzate and Alejandro von Humbolt and in the 
beegining of the XIX century, by the School of Mines. The first formal 
magnetic observatory was installed in Palacio Nacional in 1879 inside the
Meteorological and Magnetic Central Observatory. It was working with the
Tompson magnetometer (H and D), and with a Negretti-Zambra compass (I). The
observatory was working until May 1877 because of modifications in to the
building that sheltered it.<br>
During April 1889 was installed a bench in the Tacubaya Astronomical 
Observatory for magnetic observations with an Elliot-Dover magnetometer
(H and D), a Negretti-Zambra compass (I) and a set of continous reception
Carpentier variographers. In 1902, with the instalation of electric railways the 
bench had to be closed.<br>
In 1903 the equipment was moved to Cuajimalpa town, however, in 1911 it was
moved again becuase the electric railways got close to that place. The new
observatory was installed next to the Municipal Building from Teoloyucan, 36 km
northward M&eacute;xico City. It was working with the same equipment of
Cuajimalpa. In 1921, the observatory get Mascart variographers, a Dover 
magnetometer, a Edelman galvanometer, and a magnetic balance. In 1929, it was
a C.I.W. magnetometer and in 1931, the Eschenhagen-Askania variographers
(D, H, and Z). In 1949, with the foundation of Geophysics Institute, the
observatory become to be part of it.<br>
A remodelation in the structure of the Municipal Building in 1978 disturbaced
the measurements, and the observatory was moved again. For the new 
<A HREF="/geomagne/omt/omt-loc.html">location</A>
it was considered the period of magnetic observations measured in that place.
So the new place was selected next to the Municipal Cemetery in the limits of
the town, it is working with the same continous reception
<A HREF="/geomagne/omt/equipo.html">classic equipment</A> and also
with QHM magnetometers, Geometrics PPM, and Ruska, such magnetometers are
working currently.<BR>
Since July, 1996 it is working two digital equipments. These were installed
during the Latin-American Workshop on Geomagnetic Instruments
(<A HREF="/geomagne/omt/elig96/evelig96.html">ELIG 96</A>). The first one
was designed and made by Dr. Jean Rasson and Teotonio Ferreira in the
<I>Observatoire Magn&eacute;tique de Dourbes</I>, Belgium. This is
a DI-flux magnetometer modified from a RUSKA nonmagnetic theodolite
for absolute measurements, and a two components fluxgate variograph (DI, it
is called LAMA). Both are working with a PPM Geometrics G856.<BR>
The second one is a three component fluxgate variograph FGE (DHZ, it is called DMI).
This last equipment belong to the
<A HREF="http://www.dmi.dk/Welcome-uk.html"><I>Danish Meteorological Institute</I></A>,
and was installed by Dr. Ole Rassmussen to work for a two years period in
TEO.<BR>
Both, <B>LAMA</B> and <B>DMI</B>, are coneccted to the same data adquisition
system, and they get magnetic values each minute. In the future, these magnetic
values will be available in real-time through

<B>Calibrations.</B><BR>
<IMG WIDTH=220 SRC="/geomagne/omt/askania2.jpeg" ALIGN=left>
Three calibrations have been done in Teoloyucan for the classic equipment. 
The first one was in 1954
when the variogrphers were sent to the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey
(now the U. S. Defense Mapping Agency), for the instalation of temperature
compensating magnets. During 1971 and 1972 a second calibration was carried
out in the observatory with instruments from Inter-American Geodetic Survey
(IAGS, that doesn't exist anymore). And the last one was in 1991 helped by
the <A HREF="http://www.spin.com.mx/~ipgh/">Pan-American Institute of

<BODY>

<H1>Recomendaciones para los Observatorios Geomagn&eacute;ticos en Latinoam&eacute;rica</H1>

<P>Los especialistas mencionados abajo, despu&eacute;s de reunirse en la
ciudad de M&eacute;xico e instalar y operar diversos instrumentos absolutos
y relativos para medir el Campo Geomagn&eacute;tico en el Observatorio
de Teoloyucan durante julio de 1996, publican las siguientes recomendaciones
para incrementar los est&aacute;ndares en las observaciones magn&eacute;ticas
en Latinoam&eacute;rica.</P>

<P>I - Observaciones absolutas.</P>

<UL>
<UL>
<P>I.1 - Se recomienda el uso exclusivo de instrumentos de mediciones absolutas
verdaderas y exactas. Como consecuencia, en lugar de QHMs, BMZs, inductores
terrestres y declin&oacute;metros, se recomienda que los observatorios
adopten el uso de la combinaci&oacute;n de magnet&oacute;metros DI-flux
y prot&oacute;n para la determinaci&oacute;n de l&iacute;neas base. I.2
- Se recomienda elaborar una gu&iacute;a concisa con la informaci&oacute;n
de operaci&oacute;n, mantenimiento y obtenci&oacute;n de datos de los magnet&oacute;metros
DI-flux y prot&oacute;n, as&iacute; como tambi&eacute;n un adecuado dise&ntilde;o
del pilar de observaciones e instalaci&oacute;n de los instrumentos absolutos.
<BR>
I.3 - Notando que algunos teodolitos Ruska antiguos han sido convertidos
exitosamente en DI-flux, se recomienda que cualquier instituci&oacute;n
en posesi&oacute;n de teodolitos no magn&eacute;ticos o cualquier otro
instrumento de este tipo, y que los consideren obsoletos, deben ponerlos
a disposici&oacute;n de observatorios que los necesiten. <BR>
I.4 - Se recomienda que las escuelas y/o talleres Latinoamericanos de geomagnetismo
se realicen en los observatorios, y que todos los participantes traigan
sus instrumentos de mediciones absolutas para intercompararlos. M&aacute;s
a&uacute;n que los resultados de estas intercomparaciones sean publicadas
y estudiadas.<BR>
I.5 - Se recomienda la revisi&oacute;n del azimut de las marcas en los
observatorios Latinoamericanos. Por tanto, se sugiere que un cient&iacute;fico,
conocedor de m&eacute;todos astron&oacute;micos y girosc&oacute;picos para
determinar azimutes, realice un viaje a todos los observatorios. </P>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>II - Vari&oacute;metros.</P>

<UL>
<P>II.1 - De acuerdo a una recomendaci&oacute;n de la IAGA, se recomienda
el uso de vari&oacute;metros digitales en todos los observatorios. <BR>
II.2 - Cuando se instale un vari&oacute;metro digital en un observatorio,
se recomienda: </P>

<UL>
<P>a) un per&iacute;odo de transici&oacute;n de grabaci&oacute;n paralela
con los vari&oacute;metros fotogr&aacute;ficos; <BR>
b) y, conservar los vari&oacute;metros fotogr&aacute;ficos en buen estado
para usarse como un respaldo de los nuevos equipos digitales mientras no
exista otro equipo digital como apoyo. </P>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>III - Procesado de los datos. </P>

<UL>
<P>III.1 - Se recomienda que los datos finales del observatorio se tengan
disponibles en forma digital usando el formato a cada minuto de los Centros
Mundiales de Datos. Se entiende como datos finales del observatorio como
datos absolutos a cada minuto, medidos en el pilar de referencia de observaciones
absolutas del observatorio. <BR>
III.2 - Se recomienda que los datos digitales sean mandados a los Centros
Mundiales de Datos cada a&ntilde;o. </P>
</UL>

<P>IV - Recomendaciones generales.</P>

<UL>
<P>Se recomienda la creaci&oacute;n de alg&uacute;n centro Latinoamericano,
con los siguientes objetivos:</P>

<UL>
<P>a) intercomparaci&oacute;n de valores absolutos de los observatorios
Latinoamericanos;<BR>
b) el seguimiento, conservaci&oacute;n y publicaci&oacute;n de los resultados
de dichas intercomparaciones; <BR>
c) y, crear condiciones para el dise&ntilde;o y reparaci&oacute;n de instrumentaci&oacute;n
geomagn&eacute;tica para observatorios. </P>
</UL>
</UL>

<h2>Estratigrafia Espectral</h2>

El uso intensivo de herramientas de visualizacion en aplicaciones geologicas estan muy poco exploradas y su utilizacion puede representar un nuevo impulso a la geologia moderna. Las tecnicas digitales de compilacion, despliegue y manipulacion de imagenes nos permiten crear productos fotograficos y cartograficos que son de gran utilidad durante el proceso interpretativo de la geologia. Para fines de fotointerpretacion geologica, el despliegue de imagenes de satelite en perspectiva, nos puede ayudar a inferir las relaciones geometricas que guardan diferentes unidades litoestratigraficas, asi como a discriminar la litologia con ayuda de las caracteristicas multiespectrales de las imagenes de satelite. Las tecnicas y criterios interpretativos utilizados no difieren sustancialmente de aquellos utilizados en la fotointerpretacion tradicional de fotografias aereas; metodo que es comunmente aceptado por la comunidad geologica y que tambien es considerada una tecnica de percepcion remota.
 <P>

En el caso de imagenes obtenidas por sensores remotos se tienen dos alternativas para extraer la informacion geologica (Abrams et al. 1984; Lang et al., 1987):
 <P>

1. El metodo fotogeologico/fotogeomorfologico se basa en el conocimiento de las caracteristicas de erosion e intemperismo de los diferentes tipos de rocas, asi como de su expresion topografica para inferir la presencia de estructuras geologicas en la superficie de la tierra y proyectar relaciones estructurales de superficie al subsuelo. La morfologia superficial y/o la textura de las imagenes se utiliza comunmente para delinear estructuras geologicas y discriminar entre unidades litologicas con caracteristicas espectrales similares.
 <P>

2. El metodo espectral se basa en nuestro conocimiento acerca de las propiedades espectrales de los materiales (por ejemplo Hunt and Salisbury, 1974; 1975, Lang et al., 1990). Apoyados en estas caracteristicas se extrae informaci6n sobre la composicion litologica a partir de los datos de percepcion remota. En el caso de imagenes TM, este metodo solo se puede utilizar en forma cualitativa. Unicamente podemos utilizarlas diferentes respuestas espectrales de los cuerpos de rocas para discriminar o correlacionarlos entre si, pero no para inferir su naturaleza o composicion. Esto se debe a que las bandas espectrales de TM son demasiado amplias y no contienen suficiente resolucion espectral para permitir una clara identificacion (Lang et al., 1987, 1990).
 <P>

Al interpretar imagenes TM en la misma escala y proyeccion que los mapas topograficos publicados, los rasgos estructurales y contactos litologicos se pueden transferir directamente para crear mapas y medir facilmente las actitudes y relaciones geometricas (rumbos, echados o discordancias angulares, por ejemplo) que guardan entre  ellos. Esto representa una ventaja al tener una determinacion cuantitativa rapida y exacta de las actitudes estructurales a partir de las imagenes. Asi mismo, se obtiene una salida directa en forma de mapas y secciones geologico-estructurales a escalas diversas, los cuales pueden ser modificados y actualizados con facilidad.
 <P>

La utilizacion de imagenes de satelite es una herramienta mas a nuestra disposicion, pero de ninguna forma se pretende (por lo menos en un futuro inmediato) que reemplace las labores tradicionales de verificacion y medicion del geologo en campo. Sin embargo, ayudan a realizar este trabajo de una manera mas economica y eficiente al mostrar localidades clave para resolver problemas estratigraficos o medir secciones estratigraficas o estructurales. De otra forma, estas localidades pueden pasar desapercibidas para el geologo, o requerir de una mayor inversion de horas-hombre en trabajo de campo.

<H2><CENTER>Deformation Network (DefNet) on the TMVB</CENTER>
</H2>
Volcanic risk assessment in Central Mexico using spaced based geodetic techniques
is performed by means of a permanent Global Position System (GPS) station
network (<B>DefNet</B>) that quantifes surface deformation on selected active
volcanoes on the <A HREF="/iavcei97/volcanoes/volcanoes.html">Trans-Mexican
Volcanic Belt</A> (TMVB). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>What is DefNet?</B><BR>
<BR>
In its first stage, <B>DefNet</B> consists of 2 permanent GPS stations at
the <A HREF="/iavcei97/volcanoes/popo.html">Popocatepetl</A> volcano in
central Mexico. Both stations are <A HREF="/geomag/popo/map.gif">located</A>
forming a N-S baseline at 4,000 m elevation. The basic concept is that any
crustal deformation due to any unusual magma chamber activity should be
observed as a change in the baseline length and XYZ position of the receiver
stations benchmarks. DefNet began transmissions from Popocatepetl <A HREF="/geomag/popo/posw.gif">POSW</A>
station (Chipiquixtle) on April 25, 1996, <A HREF="/geomag/popo/popn.gif">POPN</A>
station (Tlamacas) began tranmissions on May 31, 1996. At this moment we
are fine tunning the automated processing system and assessing data quality.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>How do we collect the data ?<BR>
</B><BR>
Raw GPS data is downloaded daily through a radio-modem connection at UNAM's
Institute of Geophysics, Digital Cartography Laboratory (<A HREF="/geomag/cardi.html">Cardi</A>).
Data is then relayed through Internet to the University NavStar Consortium
(<A HREF="http://www.unavco.ucar.edu/">UNAVCO</A>) for archiving. From there,
it is FTP'd for processing at our research partner, the <A HREF="ftp://corsica.rsmas.miami.edu/pub/www/tims-home.html">Geodesy
Laboratory </A>at the University of Miami-RSMAS. <BR>
<BR>
Within 18 hours after downloading the GPS receivers, processed data is archived
at IGF-UNAM and then transfered to the Centro Nacional de Prevencion de
Desastres (<A HREF="http://ensayes-1.cenapred.unam.mx/general.html">Cenapred</A>),
where it is used (in addition to <A HREF="/geomag/popo/morepopo.html">other
lines of volcano monitoring</A>) to assess the volcanic risk to the volcano's
adjacent communities. <BR>
<BR>
Shortly you will be able to see an updated graph of the DefNet-Popocatpetl
baseline.<BR>
<BR>
For those interested in the glory details about the site instrumentation
and operation, we have a comprehensive graphic description (still under
development) of our network at Popocatepetl volcano.<BR>

<HR><A NAME="ASAR"></A><B>ASAR: Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar</B>
<BR>
<BR>
An advanced synthetic aperture radar has been selected as the payload for
the Envisat-1 payload, which has a planned launch in 1998 (i.e., the same
year as the EOS AM-1 platform). This C-band (5.6 cm wavelength) radar represents
the next evolutionary step from ERS-2, and will have a variety of swath
widths, including a wide swath mode that has a 100 m pixel size and 405
km swath. The radar will have dual polarization (VV like ERS-1 and ERS-2,
and a new HH polarization capability). Also new for a European radar, there
will be a variable incidence angle, from 15 to 45 degrees. Envisat's orbit
has been selected as a 98 degree inclination orbit at 800 km altitude, which
provides 35-day exact repeat coverage (i.e., identical to ERS-1 and ERS-2).
The time of equatorial crossing for Envisat is 10:00 a.m. on the descending
pass, which is comparable to the 10:30 a.m. equatorial crossing for the
EOS A.M. platforms. <BR>

<h3>EVALUACIONES ESTRATIGRAFICAS, ESTRUCTURALES Y CARTOGRAFICA GEOLOGICAS APOYADS EN TECNICAS DE VISUALIZACION DIGITAL; UN EJEMPLO EN TIERRA CALIENTE, GRO. </h3>

<h3>Enrique Cabral-Cano </h3>

El uso de tecnologia de punta de ninguna manera esta rerlido con las tareas y metodos tradicionales de la investigacion geologica. La cartografia geologica apoyada en imagenes de satelite y modelos de elevacion digital es un claro ejemplo. A continuacion se detalla este tipo de metodologia y se presenta un ejemplo de investigacion utilizando esta tecnica. La intencion es dar una mayor difusion a este tipo de herramientas cuyo uso al parecer aun no es muy apreciado dentro de la comunidad de las ciencias de la Tierra en nuestro pais.
<P>

Las aplicaciones geologicas en materia de visualizacion, quizas con la excepcion de la estratigrafla sismica, estan muy poco exploradas y su uso intensivo puede representar un nuevo impulso a la geologia moderna. Las tecnicas digitales de compilacion, despliegue y manipulacion de imagenes nos permiten crear productos fotograficos y cartograficos que son de gran utilidad durante el proceso interpretativo de la geologia. En nuestro caso particular, el despliegue de imagenes de satelite en perspectiva, nos ayuda a inferir las relaciones geometricas que guardan diferentes unidades litoestratigraficas, asi como a discriminar la litologia con ayuda de las caracteristicas multiespectrales de las imagenes de satelite. Las tecnicas y criterios interpretativos utilizados en ocasiones, no difieren sustancialmente de aquellos utilizados en la fotointerpretacion tradicional de fotografias aereas, metodo que es comunmente aceptado por la comunidad geologica y que tambien es considerada una tecnica de percepcion remota.
<P>

<h3>Ventajas</h3>

En el caso de imagenes obtenidas por sensores remotos se tienen dos alternativas para extraer la informacion geologica (Abrams lt  1984; Lang et al., 1987):
<P>

1. El metodo espectral se basa en nuestro conocimiento acerca de las propiedades espectrales de los materiales (por ejemplo  Hunt and Salisbury, 1974; 1975, Lang et al., 1990). Apoyados en estas caracteristicas se extrae informaci6n sobre la composicion litologica a partir de los datos de percepcion remota. En el caso de imagenes TM, este metodo solo se puede utilizar en forma cualitativa. Unicamente podemos utilizarlas diferentes respuestas espectrales de los cuerpos de rocas para discriminar o correlacionarlos entre si, pero no para inferir su naturaleza o composicion. Esto se debe a que las bandas espectrales de TM son demasiado amplias y no contienen suficiente resolucion espectral para permitir una clara identificacion (Lang et al., 1987, 1990).
<P>

2. El metodo fotogeologico/fotogeomorfologico se basa en el conocimiento de las caracteristicas de erosion e intemperismo de los diferentes tipos de rocas, asi como de su expresion topografica para inferir la presencia de estructuras geologicas en la superficie de la tierra y proyectar relaciones estructurales de superficie al subsuelo. La morfologia superficial y/o la textura de las imagenes se utiliza comunmente para delinear estructuras geologicas y discriminar entre unidades litologicas con caracteristicas espectrales similares.
<P>

Al interpretar imagenes TM en la misma escala y proyeccion que los mapas topograficos publicados, los rasgos estructurales y contactos litologicos se pueden transferir directamente para crear mapas y medir facilmente las actitudes y relaciones geometricas (rumbos, echados o discordancias angulares, por ejemplo) que guardan entre ellos. Esto representa una ventaja al tener una determinacion cuantitativa rapida y exacta de las actitudes estructurales a partir de las imagenes. Asi mismo, se obtiene una salida directa en formade mapas y secciones geologico-estructurales a escalas diversas, los cuales pueden sermodificados y actualizados con facilidad.
<P>

<h3>Metodologia</h3>

El proceso utilizado en el presente estudio es una modificacion del de Lang et al. (1987). Dicha metodologia se puede abreviar de la siguiente manera:
<P>

1. Procesamiento de imagenes digitales TM cubriendo las areas de interes.
<P>

2 . Interpretacion fotogeologica de reconocimiento a escalas 1:250,000 y 1:100,000, de imagenes de falso color para identificar unidades estratigraficas regionales y posibles horizontes de referencia. Esto tambien ayuda a reconocer posibles localidades tipo que presenten un bajo nivel de deformacion y secciones estratigraficas completas susceptibles de una investigacion mas detallada.
<P>

3. Verificacion de campo con el fin de poner a prueba las interpretaciones fotogeologicas. Tambien se lleva a cabo un muestreo con fines estructurales y estratigraficos. Los antecedentes de este tipo de mapeo geologico (por ejemplo, Abrams et al., 1984; Lang et al., 1987; Johnson et al., 1991; Jansma el al., 1991) ponen en evidencia que unos cuantos dias de verificacion en campo, siguiendo el proceso descrito, son suficientes para construir una cartografia geologica de alta calidad .
<P>

Interpretacion geologica detallada de imagenes TM a escala 1: 50,000 cubriendo localidades tipo o de referencia, para determinar sus caracteristicas geomorfologicas, actitud estructural, secuencias, espesores, estructura y caracteristicas espectrales de unidades litoestratigraficas definidas fotogeologicamente. Este paso requiere informacion topografica y es aqui donde las imagenes TM y el modelo de elevacion digital registrados en coordenadas UTM son de gran utilidad.
<P>

Trabajos de campo adicionales para probar y afinar las interpretaciones en areas clave previamente definidas en los pasos 3 y 4, asi como para obtener mediciones y muestras con fines estructurales estratigraficos en mayor detalle.
<P>

Compilacion de informacion geofisica y de subsuelo, con el fin de poner a prueba las inferencias e hipotesis creadas hasta este momento.
<P>

Correlacion de las columnas estratigraficas obtenidas en el area de estudio con areas adyacentes. Esta correlacion nos permite asignar edades geologicas y nombres formales a las unidades estratigraficas informales obtenidas a partir de los datos multiespectrales. Los mapas geologicos y columnas estratigraficas construidasen el paso 3 pueden ser etiquetados con una nomenclatura formal.
<P>

Como se puede observar, la utilizacion de imagenes de satelite es una herramienta mas a nuestra disposicion, pero de ninguna forma se pretende (por lo menos en un futuro inmediato que reenplace las labores tradicionales de verificacion y medicion del geologo en campo . Sin embargo, ayudan a realizar este trabajo de una manera mas economicay eficiente al mostrar localidades clave para resolver problemas estratigraficos o medir secciones estratigraficas o estructurales. De otra forma, estas localidades pueden pasar desapercibidas para el geologo, o requerir de una mayor inversion de horas-hombre en trabajo de campo.
<P>

<h3>Un ejemplo en nuestro pais</h3>

La aplicacion de estas tecnicas ha sido llevada a cabo con resultados muy satisfactorios en parte de los estados de Guerrero y Michoacan (Johnson et al., 1991, Jansma et al., 1991). En fechas recientes se trabajo en la region de Tierra Caliente, Gro. (Cabral-Cano et al., 1992). Para esto contamos con la ayuda de imagenes del Mapeador Tematico (Landsat-TM) como base para un mosaico digital, transformado y registrado en coordenadas geograficas UTM (Figura 1). A partir de este mosaico se han realizado analisis de componentes principales (Conel et al., 1985), las imagenes producidas son fotograficamente ampliadas a escalas 1:100,000 y 1:150,000 cubriendo las mismas areas que las cartas publicadas por INEGI (Figura 2). Estas imagenes, superpuestas a un modelo de elevacion digital (Figura 3) previamente muestreado con la misma resolucion de las imagenes TM y registrado con estas mismas, nos permitio construir una serie de visitas en perspectiva del Complejo Metamorfico de Tierra Caliente (Figuras 4 y 5 ; vease portada). La imagen tiene un exageracion vertical de 2.5 :1. Como referencias, la ciudad de Iguala aparece en la esquina inferior derecha de la imagen. La ciudad de Arcelia, se encuentra en la parte superior izquierda, cerca de la Presa Vicente Guerrero (area de color negro) .
<P>


El analisis de este conjunto de imagenes combinado con los trabajos de campo, siguiendo el esquema antes descrito, nos llevo a producir el mapa geologico, las secciones estructurales y las columnas estratigraficas compuestas del area de Arcelia-Teloloapan, Gro. (Cabral-Cano etll, 1992). Parte de nuestras observaciones muestran que esta secuencia metamorfica contiene unidades litoestratigraficas que pueden ser mapeadas con exactitud, algunas de los cuales estan separadas por discordancias no reconocidas con anterioridad.
<P>

<h3>Conclusiones</h3>

En sintesis, la reevaluacion de la estratigrafia y estructura de esta region a partir de un proceso como el descrito, puede tener tanta o mas calidad ue un estudio convencional de mapeo geologico de exploracion, basado unicamente en interpretacion de fotografias aereas y verificaciones en campo. Sin embargo, el manejo de metodos de compilacion digital como los sistemas de informacion geografica (SIG) aunado a recursos-costos de produccion.

Nineteen LANDSAT Thematic Mapper quarter scenes, coregistered at 28.5 m
spatial resolution with three arc second digital topographic data, were
used to create a movie, simulating a flight over the Guerrero and Mixteco
terranes of southwestern Mexico. The flight path was chosen to elucidate
important structural, stratigraphic, and geomorphic features.<BR>
<BR>
The satellite imagery, resampled into Universal Transverse Mercator projection,
was geometrically and radiometrically corrected to produce a mosaic covering
two 1:250,000 topographic sheets (Ciudad Altamirano, E14-4, and Cuernavaca,
E14-5; 18 19&#176;N latitude, 98-102&#176;W longitude). This 422 by 111
km area covers 46,842 km2. The video, available in VHS format, was generated
by computer interpolation between approximately 50 manually selected key
frames to produce a 360 second animation consisting of 30 frames per second
(i.e., 10,800 total frames). The simulated velocity during three 120 second
flight segments of the video is approximately 37,000 km per hour, traversing
approximately 1,000 km on the ground.<BR>
<BR>
Each flight segment uses a different spectral band combination: (1 ) simulated
natural color, (2) false color infrared, and (3) principal components to
enhance features of interest. For each segment, the opening scene is a space
view of the entire input data set. During each simulated flight segment
that more or less follows Highway 51, geologic and geomorphic features are
exarnined in the following order: the complexly folded and faulted Mesozoic
strata of the San Lucas anticlinorium/Malpaso syncline, and Tertiary volcaniclastic
redbeds and volcanics of the eastern Tierra Caliente region; the high-angle
Arcelia fault defining the western margin of the Tierra Caliente metamorphic
complex (TCMC); the TCMC from Arcelia to Teloloapan; the thrust-faulted
eastern margin of the TCMC and the Chilacachapa anticlinorium in the Teloloapan-lguala-Taxco
region; the Tertiary volcaniclastics and volcanics and middle Cretaceous
carbonates displaying karst topography between the Huetamo and Atenango
del Rio; the complexly folded and faulted Cretaceous strata of the Atenango
del Rio synclinorium; and the Papalutla thrust fault that defines the northwestern
margin of the Acatlan metamorphic complex.<BR>

<H1>Recommendations for Geomagnetic Observatories in Latin America</H1>

<P>The specialists listed underneath, after meeting in M&eacute;xico City,
in July, 1996, and after installation and operation of several absolute
and relative instruments to measure the Geomagnetic Field, in the Observatory
of Teoloyucan, issued the following recommendations in order to increase
observational standards in Latin America. </P>

<P>I - Absolute measurements </P>

<UL>
<P>I.1 - We recommend exclusive use of true and accurate absolute instruments
for absolute measurements. As a consequence, instead of QHMs, BMZs, earth
inductors and declinometers, we recommend that the observatories adopt
the use of a combination of DI-flux and proton magnetometers for base line
determinations. <BR>
I.2 - We recommend to make available a concise guide containing information
on the operation, maintenance and data reduction of DI-flux and proton
magnetometer, as well as on proper pier design and absolute instruments
installation. <BR>
I.3 - Noting that some old Ruska theodolites have been successfully converted
to DI- fluxes, we recommend that any institution possessing non-magnetic
theodolites or any other instrument of this kind, and considering them
obsolete, make them available to observatories in need. <BR>
I.4 - We recommend that geomagnetic Latin-American schools and/or workshops
be made at observatories, and that all participants bring their absolute
instruments in order to inter-compare them. Moreover, that the results
of these inter-comparisons be published and monitored. <BR>
I.5 - We recommend the checking of all azimuth marks in Latin-American
observatories. Therefore, we suggest that one scientist, aware of astronomical
and gyroscopic methods of azimuth determination, make a round trip to all
observatories. </P>
</UL>

<P>II - Variometers </P>

<UL>
<P>II.1 - According to an IAGA recommendation, we also recommend the use
of digital variometers in all observatories. <BR>
II.2 - When installing a digital variometer in an observatory, we recommend:
</P>

<UL>
<P>a) a transitory period of parallel recording with the photographic variometer;
<BR>
b) to keep the photographic variometer in good state so to be used as a
back up of the new digital system as long as no other digital back up is
available. </P>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>III - Data processing </P>

<UL>
<P>III.1 - We recommend that the final observatory data be made available
in digital form, using the format of minute values of the World Data Center.
We understand final observatory data as absolute minute sampled data, measured
at the reference absolute pier of the observatory. <BR>
III.2 - We recommend that the data in digital form be sent to the World
Data Center every year. </P>
</UL>

<P>IV - General recommendation</P>

<UL>
<P>We recommend the establishment of some centralizing Latin-American body,
with the following missions: </P>

<UL>
<P>a) inter-comparison of momentary absolute values of Latin American observatories;
<BR>
b) the monitoring, keeping and publishing of the results of the inter-comparisons
of absolute instruments; <BR>
c) the setting up of a geomagnetic observatory instrumental design and
repair facility. </P>
</UL>
</UL>

<H2>Popocatepetl</H2> 
Elevation: 5,452 m. <br>
Calc-alkaline strato volcano <br>
Last activity: 1995 (active) <P>

Comments: Located about 70 km souteast of Mexico City, this cone is the second highest peak in Mexico, and is counted among the most famous volcanoes in the world. The record of activity from this volcano includes large, pre-historical eruptions, spaced at intervals of roughly 1,000 years, with the last severe event ocurring about 1,200 years ago. Robin 1984). This combined with the very dense concentration of human activity in the region (Mexico City, Puebla, etc.), indicates that Popocatepetl is and will remain a very dangerous volcanic hazard.<P>

<H3>Otras Investigaciones recientes en el Volcan popocatepetl.</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Investigadores del Instituto de Geofisica (IGF), al participar en un coloquio
acerca del tema, explicaron los estudios que se llevan a cabo en torndo
al volcan en la UNAM y en el Cenapred para conocer la evolucion del fenomeno,
a fin de que las autoridades tomen las medidas preventivas necesarias para
proteger a la poblacion<BR>
<BR>
<B>El origen se remonta al Pleistoceno</B><BR>
<BR>
El origen del Xalliquehuac -&quot;arena que vuela&quot;; Popocatzin &quot;humito
o venerado humo&quot;; &quot;Cerro que Humea&quot; o &quot;Gregorio el Chino&quot;
como se ha conocido a lo largo de la historia al Popocatepetl- se remonta
al periodo Pleistoceno (hace 50 mil anos). Numerosas erupciones destruyeron
y construyeron lo que hoy es la quinta altitud del continente americano.
Destaca una erupcion que se produjo probablemente hace 50 mil anos que arraso
completamente con los bosques y definio un periodo caracterizado por su
gran explosividad que deposito material llamado &quot;xaltete&quot; o &quot;cacachuatillo&quot;
a distancias de hasta 80 kilometros del crater. Una etapa muy activa se
produjo tambien hace cuatro mil 300 anos y otra quiza hace 800 anos. Durante
esta ultima el Popocatepetl arraso con aldeas de agricultores y con bosques.
Se sabe de otra erupcion en 1357 a partir de lo cual segun reportan las
cronicas se cambio su nombre de Xalliquehuac al de Popocatepetl.<BR>
<BR>
<B>La actividad del Popocatepetl, parte de un ploceso eruptivo de tipo efusivo
sin riesgo</B><BR>
<BR>
La actividad del cuerpo de lava que presenta el volcan Popocatepetl es parte
de un proceso eruptivo del tipo efusivo, por lo que no representa un riesgo
mayor para la sociedad mientras mantenga ese caracter, informo el doctor
Servando de la Cruz, investigador del Instituto de Geofisica (IGF).<BR>
En el Segundo Coloquio sobre la Reciente Actividad d el Popocate'petl efectuado
en el auditorio Ricardo Monges Lopez  del IGF, se dieron a conocer los resultados
de los mas recientes estudios multidisciplinarios realizados por investigadores
de la UNAM y del Centro Nacional de Prevencion de Desastres (Cenapred).<BR>
El doctor De la Cruz afirmo que la lava que ha emitido el volcan desde los
ultimos dias de marzo forma parte de un proceso evolutivo de varios siglos
y esta limitado, hasta el momento, al interior del crater, es decir, no
es un hecho evidente a simple vista, por lo que hasta ahora no representa
un serio peligro, excepto para aquellos que se acerquen al crater.<BR>
Los volcanes, explico, pueden tener muchos tipos de erupciones, pero se
pueden resumir en efusivas o explosivas. Estas se diferencian por el material
que expulsan y la rapidez con la que lo hacen. En las primeras la lava sale
en pequenas cantidades, con lentitud, por lo que su impacto es lento, es
decir, no toma por sorpresa a la poblacion. Por el contrario, en el segundo
tipo de erupcion los materiales salen en abundancia y en un tiempo corto,
lo que le da el caracter explosivo.<BR>
Las observaciones efectuadas hasta el momento en el Popocatepetl indican
que se encuentra en una fase efusiva, por lo que no representa problemas
graves. Sin embargo, no se debe olvidar que esta etapa puede evolucionar
a una explosiva ya que son fenomenos impredecibles.<BR>
Los estudios que se realizan en esa zona estan orientados a conocer la probabilidad
con la que este ultimo fenomeno (la fase explosiva) puede ocurrir, a fin
de que la poblacion y las autoridades tomen las medidas preventivas necesarias.<BR>
Hay que recordar, agrego De la Cruz, que el Popocatepetl es un volcan activo
desde hace muchos siglos y que seguramente continuara asi. Ademas, el tipo
de lava y la actividad parecen tener las mismas caracteristicas que en 1920.
Por esta razon, el proceso actual del Popocatepetl se puede describir como
ciclico, con etapas tranquilas y otras de mayor actividad. Desde diciembre
de 1994 vivimos un periodo de actividad que, segun los datos recabados hasta
el momento por el comite cientifico, no representa peligro grave, subrayo
el especialista. Lo anterior, agrego, se entiende asi: &quot;el riesgo es
aceptable en tanto que el peligro que representa la actividad del volcan
no exceda las medidas de proteccion a la poblacion&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Deformacion</B><BR>
<BR>
El doctor Servando de la Cruz explico que para medir la inflamacion o deformacion
del volcan, causada por efectos anomalos en su interior, se usan metodos
convencionales en los que participan estudiantes de Topografia de la Facultad
de Ingenieria (FI).<BR>
La metodologia consiste en instalar varios vertices reflectores en la pared
del volcan y otros en lugares alejados a esta. Asi se conoce con gran precision
la distancia y los angulos entre los distintos vertices. Despues, mediante
un distanciometro laser que genera varias series de pulsos de laser, se
mide cuanto tarda este rayo en reflejarse en los reflectores y regresar
a su origen. Por ultimo, los angulos se miden mediante metodos matematicos
convencionales; calculos que implican varios dias de trabajo y el analisis
de numerosos datos.<BR>
La interpretacion de la informacion, agrego, es: si las medidas son<BR>
mayores significa que el volcan esta en un proceso de deflacion y, por el
contrario, si la distancia entre los vertices o los angulos de los mismos
disminuyen se interpreta como una inflacion del volcan.<BR>
<BR>
En la actualidad, informo De la Cruz, existe una red de vertices instalada
en el norte del volcan (cerca del monumento al Paso de Cortez y de Tlamacas)
mediante la cual se miden las distancias entre los vertices reflectores
instalados en las partes altas del volcan. Algunos resultados obtenidos
mediante el proceso descrito, aplicado en la fase de actividad del volcan
(diciembre de 1994 y los primeros meses de 1995), demuestran que este sufrio
una inflacion, y recientemente una deflacion.<BR>
La deformacion del volcan Popocatepetl registrada hasta el momento varia
de 1.5 a tres centimetros, y su deflacion es en promedio de 1.5 centimetros.
Por ultimo, De la Cruz anuncio la instalacion de una red de este tipo al
Este y al Sur del volcan.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Actividad del Popocatepetl en la Decada de los Anos Veinte</B><BR>
<BR>
El doctor Jose Luis Macias, investigador del Instituto de Geofisica, al
comentar un video realizado por el Cenapred, dijo que existe una similitud
entre la actividad que presento el Popocatepetl a partir de febrero de 1919
hasta 1927, y la que presenta desde el 21 de diciembre de 1994 hasta hoy.<BR>
<BR>
La primera parte de la grabacion presenta una serie de disenos y fotografias
que realizo el Doctor Atl en la decada de los anos veinte, y la segunda
muestra algunas tomas realizadas por Marcos Galicia, miembro de Proteccion
Civil de Amecameca, realizadas desde el borde del crater, y otras aereas
de los vuelos que cotidianamente realiza el comite cientifico.<BR>
<BR>
La actividad de febrero de1919, explico el investigador, se registro como
una serie de explosiones en el interior del crater, el cual en 1906 estaba
ocupado por un lago. No fue sino hasta mediados de la segunda decada de
este siglo cuando se realizaron expediciones o excursiones a la cima del
volcan para hacer observaciones y dibujos de lo que ahi estaba ocurriendo.<BR>
<BR>
Estos trabajos muestran la emision de lava, en el interior del volcan, y
las explosiones violentas de 1927 que, se supone, dieron lugar a la formacion
de un crater interno de un diametro de aproximadamente 700 m y una profundidad
de 80-100 m. Uno de los dibujos del Doctor Atl muestra las rocas del crater
externo, en cuya parte inferior, existia un domo (especie de tapon con bordes
pronunciados). Ademas, se observa que las emisiones de cenizas y vapores
ocurrian esencialmente en la periferiua de icho domo, fuertemente fracturado.<BR>
En la actualidad, explico el doctor Macias, se puede apreciar que la lava
emitida en el suroeste del crater ha llegado a la altura en donde se encontraban
los orificios mencionados por el Doctor Atl en los estudios que realizara
en torno al volcan en la decada de los anos veinte.<BR>
Sin embargo, concluyo, de acuerdo con la cantidad de lava expulsada por
el Popocatepetl se considera que tardaria mas de un ano en rebasar el crater
externo (de mas de 300 metros de alto) del volcan. Ademas dijo, esperamos
que sea un periodo activo muy similar al de principios de siglo y que no
tenga una erupcion explosiva.<BR>
<BR>
Los cambios de emisiones del volcan pueden ser patrones que indiquen modificaciones
en el tipo eruptivo, o en la magnitud de 105 eventos del Popocatepetl, por
lo que las mediciones frecuentes del incremento o decremento de los gases
es imprescindible para conocer la intensidad del proceso.<BR>
<BR>
Los volcanes tienen muchos tipos de erupciones, pero se pueden resumir en
efusivas o explosivas, que se diferencian por el material que expulsan y
la rapidez con la que lo hacen. En las primeras la lava sale en pequenas
cantidades, con lentitud. En el segundo tipo de erupcion los materiales
salen en abundancia y en un tiempo corto.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Gases y Cenizas</B><BR>
<BR>
El doctor Hugo Delgado, investigador del IGF, indico que los cambios de
emisiones del volcan pueden ser patrones que indiquen modificaciones en
el tipo eruptivo, o en la magnitud de los eventos de! Popocatepetl, por
lo que Ias mediciones frecuentes del incremento o decremento de los gases
es imprescindible para conocer la gravedad del proceso.<BR>
<BR>
Las cantidades de dioxido de azufre que transpira el volcan son cuantificadas
mediante un espectrometro de correlacion, propiedad de la Universidad de
Colima, el cual mide la absorcion de energia solar por las moleculas de
dioxido de azufre. El metodo consiste en colocar entre el instrumento y
la fuente de luz, la pluma eruptiva o gases. Esta medicion puede ser terrestre
o aerea, por lo cual se cuenta con apoyo de la Fuerza Aerea y de la Armada
de Mexico.<BR>
<BR>
La doctora Ana Lillian Martin, investigadora del IGF, informo que de acuerdo
con los estudios quimicos, las cenizas arrojadas por el volcan, desde diciembre
de 1994 hasta abril de este ano, son de bajo nivel toxico, es decir, son
compuestos similares a los que se encuentran en los suelos de las areas
de cultivo.<BR>
Los registros de cenizas, agrego, se efectuan periodicamente, una o dos
veces por semana. Los estudios que se hacen para detallar las caracteristicas
de las cenizas y sus variaciones son: medidas de espesor, calculos de volumen,
microscoplas y analisis quimicos.<BR>
Los datos obtenidos hasta el momento indican que la distribucion y el volumen
de la caida de ceniza ha variado desde diciembre de 1994. En un principio
se esparcieron hacia Puebla, y en la parte central del volcan se registraron
de uno a dos centimetros de espesor. La distribucion en este ano no es uniforme
en direccion a Puebla, sin embargo comienza a dirigirse hacia el sur. Ademas,
dijo la doctora Martin, despues de la aparicion de la lava, entre el 5 y
el 10 de abril, se han localizado particulas de cristales en una matriz
de vidrio que probablemente sean material del domo.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sismicidad</B><BR>
<BR>
El doctor Carlos Valdes; investigador del IGF, informo que las recientes
senales sismicas del Popocatepetl estan relacionadas con la salida de lava
del domo, entre el 28 y 29 de marzo; posteriormente el movimiento comenzo
a descender.<BR>
Las senales sismicas son percibidas por sensores, que explican algunas fenomenos
del volcan, por ejemplo deformaciones o procesos de fluidos o gases que
generan vibraciones.<BR>
Con ayuda de equipo de computo se ha logrado hacer un corte del volcan y
localizar los hipocentros. Estos datos muestran que este tipo de eventos,
desde diciembre del 94 hasta ahora, se localizan principalmente en la zona
central del volcan a una profundidad de 0-10 km bajo el nivel de la cima.
Sin embargo, son senales frecuentes, debiles y acumuladas en el conducto
de salida.<BR>
Las graficas de los eventos debajo del volcan muestran fenomenos que pueden
ser los causantes de la lava y de las cenizas, entre otros, y que permiten
entender las diferentes fases del comportamiento del volcan.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Instrumentacion</B><BR>
<BR>
El maestro Roberto Quaas, investigador del Instituto de Ingenieria y asesor
del Cenapred, al referirse a la instrumentacion en el Popocatepetl, explico
que los equipos utilizados en el monitoreo del volcan son indispensables
para conocer su situacion.<BR>
Los tipos de vigilancia que actualmente se practican en el Popocatepetl
son vigilancia visual mediante la observacion directa con ayuda de helicopteros;
ascensos al volcan; monitoreo sismico, asi como el monitoreo de tiempo real,
por lo que existen equipos instalados cerca del Popocatepetl que transmiten
la informacion por telemetria al Cenapred y a la UNAM, entre otros metodos.<BR>
Ademas, como parte del monitoreo se cuenta con una camara enfocada hacia
el volcan que transmite via microondas imagen de video en tiempo real al
Cenapred. De esta manera, explico el maestro Quaas, se monitorea visualmente,
y con ayuda de computadoras se analizan los datos obtenidos para, posteriormente,
depositarlos en una base de datos y poder correlacionarlos.<BR>
Dijo que la sala de deteccion, localizada en el Cenapred, cuenta con registradores
de tambor, con imagenes en vivo y con computadoras, una de las cuales esta
conectada a una alarma para que en caso de que se incremente la actividad
sismica del Popocatepetl o varie la liberacion de energial, se reporten
en forma automatica los datos al grupo cientifico.<BR>

<BR>
The Chipiquixtle site is located (261.343456 E; 19.009658 N) about 2 km
away and 200 m higher from the closest dirt road. Access by vehicle is by
means of a 20 km long dirt road from the town of Atlautla, State of Mexico.<BR>
This station is located atop a small hill of blocky lava and scoria on the
southeastern flank of the volcano. This is not an easily accessible site,
so it was designed to operate autonomously; therefore, it is powered by
batteries and solar panels. The GPS instrumentation is housed within a small
(2.5x2.5 m) cabin (Chipiquixtle-PPX station) which also contains a seismometer,
tiltmeter and telecommunication equipment. The GPS installation consists
of an Allen Osborne Associates TurboRogue SNR 8000. The choke ring design
antenna is located on top of a steel spike mount 1.0 m high.<BR>

to have a clear line of sight to the base site. The site is AC powered,
with battery backup. The lodge (except for crisis situations like Dec '94-to
date) is regularly visited by hikers, therefore was necessary to keep a
low profile and concealed installation. Aside from the GPS and telecommunications
antennas, the rest of the equipment is installed underground. In a similar
fashion to POSW, the site is run by an Allen Osborne Associates TurboRogue
SNR-8000. The choke ring antenna is set on top of a steel spike mount 1.0

Base site is located at the Geophysics Institute, within the main campus
of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) In Mexico City. It
is approximately 65 km away from both POSW and POPN stations at the Popocatepetl
volcano. The equipment a the base site consists of an Intel x486 class computer
running Sun's Solaris 2.4 operating system. This computer controls the automatic
download of data from the AOA Turborogue receivers through a set of Freewave
modems and a 5W signal amplifier transmitting within 902-928 MHz spread
spectrum. This site also serves as a semi-permanent fiducial station which
will allow to subtract regional plate movements from the Popocatepetl volcano
sites. This site is equipped with a Trimble 4000 SSE receiver, and a Geodetic
SST antenna.<BR>

GPS Geodetic Monuments</H2>
<B>POSW (Chipiquixtle)</B><BR>
<BR>
Each one of the described monuments took the materials listed elsewhere.
The monuments were constructed each one by 6 persons in one day. Construction
of these monuments included digging a hole (1x1x1m) mostly in volcanic ash
and pumice. This time frame does not includes transportation of materials
to the site. Access by vehicle is by means of a 20 km long dirt road from
the town of Atlautla, State of Mexico. It took 1 1/2 days and 10 persons
to carry all the necessary construction materials, equipment and tools to
the site location. Some of the construction materials could be obtained
from the site surroundings, such as rock boulders, sand and gravel for concrete
aggregates, etc. Of course, mileage may vary according to local conditions.<BR>
The choke ring design antenna is located on top of a steel spike mount 1.0
m high. This spike rests on too of a beavis pin benchmark which embedded
in a reinforced concrete monument approximately 1.0 m deep and 0.8 m diameter.
The center reebar framework of the monument is connected to the country
rock by steel reebar driven down to refusal 1-1.5 m deep into the soil.
The monument is isolated from top soil by loosely compacted volcanic pumice
in order to minimize the monument from frost and heave topsoil movements.<BR>
<BR>
<B>POPN (Tlamacas)</B><BR>
<BR>
The Tlamacas site is 300 m away and 100 m higher from the Tlamacas lodge,
which can be accesses by paved road. In this case the construction of the
monument took 4 persons and one day to be completed. This reinforced concrete
monument is approximately 1.0 m deep and 0.8 m diameter; the center reebar
framework of the monument is connected to the country rock by steel reebar
driven down to refusal 0.5-1.5 m deep into the soil. The monument is isolated
from top soil by loosely compacted volcanic pumice in order to minimize
the monument from frost and heave topsoil movements. <BR>
This site was planned as an underground setting, so it was necessary to
dig a 1.6 x 2.2 x 1.0 m hole. This was later reinforced by brick and cement
walls to allow a cleaner and durable installation of the two watertight
boxes containing the batteries, receiver and telecommunications equipment.
It was also necessary to install a barbed wire perimeter fence 10x5 m length.
Power was supplied from the Tlamacas lodge 120v AC supply, so it was necessary
to dig a 300 m long, 0.5 m deep trench to run the underground burial copper
12 AWG cable (2 wires + ground)<BR>
<BR>
It is necessary to allow several days for proper cement curing before installation
of the antenna mount.

<center> <H3>Citlaltepetl (Pico de Orizaba)</H3></center> <P>

Infrared aerial photograph taken from a NASA ER-2 aircraft, november 1994. <P>

The Citlaltepetl volcano is localed at the eatern end of the Mexican Volcanic Belt, a Plio-Quaternary province that crosses the central part of Mexico, in which several volcanoes are still active including Ceboruco, Colima, Popocatepel and Citlaltepetl. The basement of the area around the Citlaltepetl volcano is formed by Cretaceous NW-SE folded mountain ranges made of limestone and shale. <P>

The Citlaltepetl volcano forms the southern end of a volcanic range which include a major stratovolcano (Cofre de Perote) at its northern end, and several partially destroyed older caldera structures in the central part. Numeros monogenetic cones, explosion crater or maars (e.g. Alchichica, Preciosa, Quechulac, Atexcac, Jalapazquillo, Tepexitl, Buanavista, Aljojuca, Tecuitlapa), dome complexes (e.g. Derrumbadas) and a big stratovolcano (e.g. Sierra Negra) are characteristic examples of the volcanic features of this region.<P>

The Citlaltepetl, or Pico de Orizaba, is the highest stratovolcano in Mexico with an elevation of 5,675m, rising over an asymmetrical topography of about 2,900 m to the west, and about 4,300 m to the east. It is located at the eastern end of the Mexican Volcanic Belt. It forms a steep cone which is covered by lava flows and ash erupted in 1566 and 1687. Cities and towns around the volcano have an approximate population of 500,000 people. The combined chararcteristics of being a large volcanic edifice with steep slopes, historic activity, and dense nearby population are favourable to induce several kinds of volcanic hazardous processes, especially gravity driven events such as lahar or even debris avalanches. <P>

Large dacitic spine occupues the center of the summit crater. the crater is breached to the northeast and southwest in a linear manner that suggest the possible presence of a buried fault other faults and smaller, parasitic cones and flows can be seen on the eastern and western flanks of the volcano. The faults are related to the Tepic-Chapala Rift, a Quaternary one of extension in southwestern Mexico.<P>

This is another member of the "Humboldt Line" of strato-volcanoes, which also includes Nevado de Toluca, Popocatepetl, and Pico de Orizaba. The location of this east-west line of volcanoes is clearly controlled by a deep seated fault one. The large valleys cutting deeply into the volcano probably have a glacial origin. The radial drainage pattern, common to all large volcanic cones, is clearly displayed.<P>

Caldera <br>
Last activity: about 25,000 years ago. <P>

Two of the most prominent features associated with most calderas are clearly visible in this image: ring faults, forming a near perfect circle 11 km in diameter, which resulted from the collapse of the roof of a shallow magma chamber following an eruption about 95,000 years ago; and numerous rhyolitic domes, which erupted later along the northern and southern margins of the caldera and near its center. The domes are easily distinguished by their elevated, smooth appearence; the associated pumice, ash, and lacustrine deposits are easily eroded, and thus display a crennellated surface due to rapid erosion. the region within the caldera has been evaluated as a possible source of hydrothermal energy.<P>

The ring faults that define the margins of this truncated caldera are clearly visible in the image, forming a circle lO-lZ km in diameter. The caldera is truncated along its southern margin by a younger east-west fault. The slopes outside of the caldera are composed of ignimbrites, slightly dipping more or less uniformily away from the caldera. The ring faults expose layers of volcanic deposits along the northeastern margin of the caldera. <P>

<title>Huichapan Caldera</title>

<body>

<H2>Huichapan Caldera</H2> 
Elevation: variable up to 2,262 m. <br>
Last activity 2-3 m.a. <Pr>

The morphology of this caldera is very similar to that of the Amealco Caldera, althought somewhat more eroded. This indicates that it may be slightly older. It lacks a large central resurgent dome, bu the ring faults are still visible at its margins, forming a circular basin approximately 9 km in diameter. Port-collapse volcanics are concetrated along its north-eastern edge.  larger cone of post-collapse volcanics is located just off the edge of this image to the southeast.<P>

<center><H2>IAVCEI GENERAL ASSEMBLY</H2></center> 
<center><H3>Puerto Vallarta, Mexico</H3></center> 
<center><H3>January 19-24, 1997</H3></center>


On behalf of the hosting Mexican scientists, we extend to you our sincere invitation to participate in the 1997 IAVCEI General Assembly, to be held in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, during the third week of January. The General subject of the meeting will be "Volcanic Activity and the Environment". We will have a Scientific Programme that highlights the two-way relations between different aspects of the volcanic phenomena and the ambient. Some sessions will be devoted to analyze how the geologic and tectonic environments influence volcanism. Ohers will study the impact of volcanic activity on the environment. We trust that such approach will appeal to you. <P>

On the other hand, Puerto Vallarta is one of the most beautiful places in the world to be in January. Excellent hotels on the beach at very reasonable prices, great food and spirits, international airport with worldwide connections, and a good programme of field excursions to a diversity of volcanic areas will provide a unique ambiance for scientific exchange; also less technical trips to sites of touristic and anthropological interest will make the meeting more attractive. It is a good opportunity to bring family or friends with you, for the accompanying persons activities (of all ages) will be superb. You answear to the first circular will permit us to plan these activities with more detail.<P>

We look forward to your participation in the 1997 IAVCEI General Assembly<P>

The Organizing Committee.<P>

<center>The Earth trembled whilst<BR>
the Citlaltepetl smoked.</center><P>

Since pre-hispanic times, central Mexico's indigenous records show evidence of seismicity asosciated with volcanic activity. <P>

The logo's icons are taken from the pre-hispanic "Vaticano Rios" and "Tellerian" codices. The lower icon (Ollin) represents movement and the encompasing rectangle represents a terrane. The upper icon represents the eruption of the  Citlaltepetl (Star) volcano, also known as the <a href="/iavcei97/volcanoes/orizaba.html">Pico de Orizaba</a>, a volcano located east-central Mexico.

<title>IAVCEI 97 Excursions</title>
<H2>EXCURSIONS</H2>
</head>

<body>

<H4>General Arrangements</H4>

Eighteen field trips are being planned, six will be pre-congress, 3 during the mid conference break and 9 post-congress. Excursions will cover a wide range of interests from alkali basalts and ignimbrites in northern Mexico and Queretaro to monogenetic and active poligenetic volcanism at Colima, Popocatepetl, Pico de Orizaba and Chichon and the Nicaraguan volcanoes. <P>

All excursions have limited space so acceptance will be based on when the request with payment is recieved. This will be on first come first serve basis and must be in no later than September 1. All excursions must be paid in full by then, please refer to Circular 2 (soon to be released) for payment specifications and excursion registration. If an excursion should be cancelled, payment will be reimbursed. If a registrant cancels after September 1 a refund will only be made in exceptional cases. Before this date a $50 US fee will be charged. Excursion cost includes transportation during the field trip, at least 2 meals (see each excursion), lodging and the field guide. Each participant must make arrangements to get to and from the excursion and obtein their own health insurance. Most field trips include hotels (double occupancy) and travel will be both by small buses / vans and large buses. <BR>
January in Mexico is cool (0-15C) except for southeastern Mexico (Chichon). Nicaragua (~30C) is much warmer.<P>

<H2>General Information</H2>

You will never encounter a friendlier people than the Mexicans. They are proud of their country and its attractions and delight in showing them offto visitors. <P>

Those very cultural and geographical paradoxes that give Mexico its infinite variety make it a land where the travel options are almost unlimited. You can enjoy 21st century luxury in an ambiance of high-rises. Or you can go back centuries into a past in which intriguing civiliza
tions thrived and declined, leaving only mute testimoni als in the form of temples, pyramids and steles.<P>

You don't have to be a history or archaeology buff, however, to enjoy Mexico's rich appeal.<P>

You can seek out any of scores of charming mountain resorts or colonial villages, like Taxco and Guanajuato, and immerse yourself in a totally different atmosphere.<P>

Volcanologists find Mexico particularly attractive. The diversity shown by its thousands of volcanic structures, old and new, provide avery rich source of information for a better understanding of the volcanic phenomena. Do not forget to bring you field gear!<P>



Puerto Vallarta is located in the Mexican state of Jalisco
on the Pacific coast. Settled on Bahia de Banderas, which
is fve times larger than Acapulco Bay, and the largest
natural bay in Mexico (42 km), ringed by mountains, it is
unique among the mexican beach resorts because notwith-
standing its international touch, it keeps that typical
mexican flavor, with cobblestone streets and white wall-
red tile roofed houses.<P>

One of the best communicated resorts in Mexico, there is regular operation by seven airlines, both domestic and intenational. By land, it is linked with the rest of the country via Federal Highway 200 who runs atong the Pacific coast. By sea, several international cruise lines stop in Puerto Vallarta.<P>

It is also close enough to interesting volcanic areas!<P>


The variety and quality of the services in many of the haiels make Vallarta a tourist and convention spot in the level of the best in the world: Marine, Golf course, facilities for meetings, spectacular swimmingpools, beach clubs, restaurants and exclusive bars, tennis courses, beautiful gardens around the swimming pools and the beach just in a few steps. But do not worry. We will try to make this not toodistracting for the scientific sessions!<P>

Puerto Vallarta has a great variety of hotels in all categories, from the most luxury ones to the modest ones, all depends of the different necessities of its visitants.<P>

Krystal Vallarta Hotel Hosting Meeting, is located in one of the most beautiful coast of the Mexican Pacific with almost one kilometer of beach the Hotel, Resort and Convention Center combines the beautiful natural view with the colonial architecture.<P>

It counts with 426 rooms, suites and villages, 7 session rooms, 44 swimming pools, tennis courses and racquetball, golffacilities and aquatic activities.<P>

Major ignimbrites are well exposed in the central sector of Mexican Volcanic Belt, particularly in the states of Queretaro and Hidalgo. We will examine the Amealco and Huichapan tuffs, 4.7 and 3.5 Ma, respectively. One of these tuffs is widely known because it is shown on the cover of  the book "Volcanic Successions" of Cas and Wright (1987). The ignimbrites are generally welded, low-aspect ratio deposits that are spectacularly exposed in canyons. We will be able to observe the whole pyroclastic epiclastic sequence associated to each major ignimbrite, including pumice fall, surge, ash-flow, and mud-flow deposits, as well welded and unwelded ignimbrites. One of these canyons exposes about 150 m of these deposits. We will examine the ignimbrites at their vent, proximal, medium, and distal facies. Amealco deposits are particularly interesting because they are trachyandesitic-trachydacitic and with evidence of glass mingling in each of the three major ignimbrites that compose the Amealco Tuff. The sources of these ignimbrites are identified, the Amealco (11 km diameter) and Huichapan (10 km diameter) calderas, which we will visit. Both calderas arc well exposed and have good access. The volcanic evolution of the Amealco caldera in particular, is well constrained in time, and it will be possible to observe several of the volcanic structures associated to it, including rim lava domes, central lava domes, and peripheral vents.<P>

Approximate cost: 550 US, includes hotel, meals and land transportation, leaving from and arriving to, the Leon airport.<P>

Meeting place: The field trip is start at Leon (Bajio) international airport, 3:00 PM on January 15, and end in the same place at 4:00 PM on January 19.<P>

Maximum number of participants: 25

Dr. Jose Luis Macias, Instituto de Geofisica, UNAM, Mexico<P>

The most comprehensive studies in the Cuitzeo Basin are  those dealing with hydrological and structural features (Suter et al, 1989; Israde et al., 1992). In order to understand the evolution of the Cuitzeo Basin, one of us (Israde) is now studying in detail the biostratigraphy, stratigraphy, and structural geology of the basin rocks. Los Azufres Caldera has been the center of discussion due to its complex evolution (De la Cruz et al., 1992; Dobson, 1984; Pradal and Robin, 1985; Ferrari et al., 1987, Garduo, 1988). In fact, the caldera geometry and the emission of its pyroclastic products has been a topic of interest among several investigators. During this field trip we will show some of the results of our fieldwork in this areas in order to stimulate discussion among the participants.<P>

Approximate cost: 300 US, this will include: bus transportation (comfortable large bus), hotel in double occupancy, breakfast and lunch.<P>

Meeting place: This field trip is planned to start at Toluca City on the and ends at Morelia City. <P>

Maximum number of participants: 20. <P>

Colima volcano is a large complex andesitic stratovolcano (3,850 m) located in the western part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) and at the s      end of the N-S tranding Colima graben (Luhr et al., 1985) about 70 km from the Pacific Ocean coast. The excursion will consist of two parts. In part 1 we will discuss the morphological and textural characteristics of the different debris avalanches deposits (DADs), evaluate the problems of dating of edifice collapse events and associated DADs, and of discrimination between complexly superimposed and intercalated deposits by visiting a variety of outstanding exposures through the entire DAD pile. In part 2 we will compare and contrast the textural and morphologic characteristics of pyroclastic deposits characteristic of the spectrum of non-effusive activity of Colima volcano focussing on detailed proximal sequences for the 1913, 1991, and 1994 eruptions.<P>

Duration: 6 dayas excluding venue and return<BR>
	3 days on debris avalanche and related deposits<BR>
	2 days on historical deposits<BR>
	1 day trip to Playon avalanche caldera moat area, 3,200 m elevation, and alternative day trip will be planned in case of bad weather and road conditions permitting.<P>

Approximate cost: 600 US including excursion guidebook, hotel accommodation (7 nights, from January 11 through and including night of January 17), breakfast and field lunches, one evening farewell party (participants are responsible for all other diners), ticket for Folkloric Colima Ballet show, and transportation during the excursion. This cost does not include travel to and from Colima Buenavista Airport. The excursion will involve some strenuous walking at elevations ranging from 500 m to 3,200 m.<P>

The field trip will focus on the vulcanism of southern Mexico City (Xitle Volcano), Popocatepetl Volcano (70km to the east of Mexico City) and Teotihuacan (north of Mexico City) and its effect on the civilizations which occupied these areas over 2,000 years ago. We will visit the Xitle monogenetic cone, lava tubes and other lava structures and the Cuicuilco pyramids which were covered by the lava flow. At Popocatepetl we will focus on the Plinian deposits and their effect on the populated areas nearby (past and present) and will make a short visit to the cone. Archaeologists have suggested that Teotihuacan flourished and was later abandoned because of these eruptions. We will visit the ancient quarries and pyramid tunnels and discuss the outcrops.<P>

Approximate cost: 550 US, this will include 4 nights double occupancy at 3 to 4 star hotel and meals (single room include 200 extra), bus transportation and field guide. Short hikes, cool weather.<P>

Meeting place: Mexico City 7:00 AM on January 15, excursion will end at Mexico City international airport at noon January 19.<P>

The main purpose of this field trip is to observe pyroclastic deposits produced during the 1982 eruption of El Chichon volcano and those produced by older eruptions. Because of the relatively recent occurrence of a volcanic explosive eruption at this volcano it is possible to observe pristine characteristics of fall, flow and surge deposits. In addition, due to the eruption old deposits have been exposed which gives a good opportunity to grasp the stratigraphy of the last 3,500 years BP of this volcano. <P>

Approximate cost: 390 US, this will include transportation (car rental, gas), 1 night of hotel (double occupancy), breakfast, box lunch, field guide. Most of the outcrops to be visited will be reached by long walks from Rancho San Juan to the volcano crater (between 4 to 10 km). Because we will camp at Rancho San Juan participants must bring their own camping gear including tents, sleeping bags, flash lights, etc. At the towns or small cities, where we will spend few nights participants will have the opportunity to visit colonial churches and interact with the local people. Weather during this time of the year can be a little rainy, therefore, a raincoat and an extra pair of boots is recommended. <P>

Meeting place: This field trip is planned to start and end at the airport in Villahermosa, Tabasco. From Monday, January 13, through Friday, January 17. <P>

Maximum number of participants: 20. <P>

The San Pedro-Ceboruco graben (SPCG) is located on the western Mexican volcanic belt. Is a complex WNW-ESE striking extensional basin comprised between the Cretaceous Eocene Jalisco block and the Oligocene-early Miocene Sie      e Occidental volcanic area. Calcalcaline and alkaline volcanism has been taking place concurrently inside the SPCG since the Pliocene, including the andesitic-dacitic Ceboruco stratovolcano, the San Pedro caldera and associated rhyolitic to andesitic domes complex and the Cerro Grande alkaline basaltic shield volcano. In the last years the geology and tectonics of the SPCG have been gratly enhanced by the drilling of deep exploratory wells, new geologic mapping and geophysical studies carried out in the geothermal exploration of Comision Federal de Electricidad. The excursion intend to present the recent advances in the geology of this complex volcanic area and their geothermal implications. <BR>
The first part of the excursion will show the geology of the San Pedro caldera and the associated dome complex with both panoramic view and closer looks at some relevant geologic contacts and pyroclastic deposits. After lunch a brief talk will illustrate the 3-D structure of the SPCG deduced by the geophysical studies and the geothermal wells and will discuss the geothermal potentiality of the area. The excursion will end with the examination of the historic explosive eruption deposits of the Ceboruco volcano. <P>

Approximate cost: 100 US, this include box lunch, transportation and field guide. <P>

Meeting place: The field trip will begin and end at the Congress hotel on January 22. <P>

Maximum number of participants: 500. <P>

The excursion provides the opportunity to visit a E-W cross section of one of the largest Mexican batholiths and its surrounding volcanosedimentary sequences. Emphasis will be given to the petrographic diversity of the granitoid rocks and the emplacement conditions (contact metamorphism, cooling history). If the road conditions are good, the last point of the excursion will be a view at the abandoned massive sulfur type Cuale mine, located at nearly 2,000 m in one of the volcanosedimentary units. <P>

Approximate cost: 75 US, this will include transportation in small bus or vans, box lunch and field guide. Short hikes. <P>

Meeting place: Hotel Krystal early morning January 22, return in evening. <P>

Maximum number of participants: 25. <P>

The purpose of this field trip is to have a birdseye view of several of the volcanoes along the front of the western Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, and to visit the famous Paricutin volcano. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) can be divided into three sectors: western, central, and eastern. The western sector volcanoes are related to subduction of the Rivera plate, and are located in rift zones within and along the margins of the Jalisco Block. An unusual diversity of magmas has erupted in this actively rifting continental arc, including primitive lamprophyres, calc-alkaline basalts, and ocean-island basalts, as well as differentiates of each. Lamprophyres and calc-alkaline magmas were coeval in eruption at the Mascota, Los Volcanoes, and San Sebastian fields within the Jalisco Block. Mascota is notable for having the youngest known minette cinder cone on Earth, dated at 68,000 years. A similar relationship is found at the Colima Volcanic Complex, site of some of the largest known volcanic debris avalanches. A chain of three large calc-alkaline andesitic volcanoes becomes progressively younger toward the trench, culminating in Volcan de Colima, Mexicos most active volcano. The andesitic chain is flanked by a dozen cinder cones with lava flows, most of which erupted a lamprophyric magma series gradational from basanite to minette. Farther east along the volcanic front, Jorullo Volcano (1759 1774) lies at the southern edge of the Michoacan-Guanajuato Volcanic Field (MGVF), where ~1,000 small volcanic centers are present. Magma composition changed from primitive calc-alkaline basalt to basaltic andesite during the course of the 15 year eruption. As for the Jalisco Block fields and Colima, lamprophyric magma also erupted in the area at Cerro La Pilita, a late Quaternary cinder and lava cone just 3 km south of Jorullo. The youngest volcano in the MGVF, Paricutin, lies about 80 km northwest of Jorullo. It was observed and studied intensively from the moment of its birth in a cornfield on February 20, 1943, until its death 9 years later. We will fly over these volcanoes in order to have a birdseye view of them. <BR>
On route to landing at the airport in Uruapan we will fly over the volcanic fields of the Jalisco Block, the Colima complex, and circle the cinder cones and lava fields of both Jorullo and Paricutin. After landing in Uruapan we will travel by van to Paricutin, where we will make stops at distal tephra-fall deposits, the lava flows that surround the remains of the church of San Juan Parangaricutiro, and climb up the rim of the cinder cone. The group will travel back to Uruapan by van for the return flight to Puerto Vallarta. January is the dry season, and so we expect a clear sunny day, excellent for photography and a pleasant hike at Paricutin. However, this season is also cool and  windy, so we recommend a parka, field boots, and sun block along with your camera and plenty of film. Even though the trails are not difficult, we will be walking above 2,000 m elevation. <P>

Approximate cost: 440 US, this will include air fare, lunch, transportation in vans from and to Uruapan's airport and field trip guidebook. <P>

Meeting place: The excursion will begin at the airport of Puerto Vallarta on January 22 at 7:00 AM, and finish at the same place later evening (approximate to 7:00 PM). <P>

Maximum number of participants: 46. <P>

The Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO) is the largest continuous expanse of silicic volcanic rocks in the world. Its main outcrop is a volcanic plateau (>1200 km long) that runs parallel to the Pacific coastline, from the US-Mexico border (31 N) to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (21 N). Near the base of the plateau is exposed a thick (~1 km) Cretaceous to early Tertiary magmatic sequence (Lower Volcanic Complex) dominated by a granitic batholith and propylitically altered andesites. Resting atop the Lower Volcanic Complex, and separated by a major unconformity, is a thick succession of mid-Tertiary felsic volcanic rocks, dominated by ash-flow tuffs (Upper Volcanic Supergroup). Isolated exposures of  similar volcanic rocks extend into the surrounding regions of the Basin and Range Province (BRP) and Gulf of California Basin (GCB) and produce a total areal distribution of approximately 300,00 km2.
The origin of the calc-alkaline rocks of SMO is tied to the eastward subduction of the Farallon Plate along the western Cordillera of North America. By mid- to late-Tertiary, subduction gradually ceased and a broad zone of normal faulting, more than 3,000 km long, was developed in the western US and in northern Mexico (i.e. the BRP). As a consequence of this change, the voluminous subduction related calc-alkaline magmatism was succeeded by small-volume eruptions of intra-plate alkali basalts and basanites. In northern Mexico the faulted area is split into two branches separated by the relatively unextended SMO block. West of the sierra is the faulted region bordering the Gulf of California and to the east is the Central Meseta.
In the region between Durango and Mazatlan, the transition between compression and extension occurred at about 30 Ma and the earliest known alkaline basalts began to erupt at 24 Ma in the Rodeo area. A new period of faulting and associated volcanism occurred in the Rio Chico-Otinapa graben at 12 Ma. By the Pliocene and Quaternary, basanitic magmas, which carried deep crustal and upper mantle xenoliths to the surface, were erupted both in the Meseta Central (Durango Volcanic Field) and in the Gulf of California area (Punta Piaxtla). <P>

Approximate cost: 750 US, this will include lodging in double occupancy, meals, land transportation and field trip guide. <P>

Meeting place: The field-trip will begin early January 25 at the Congress Hotel, and will end at the Zacatecas international airport, January 30 in the afternoon. <P>

Maximum number of participants: 20 <P>

In the western sector of the Mexican Volcanic Belt (WMVB) calcalkaline and alkaline (ocean-type) volcanism has been taking place concurrently with an extensional tectonics since the late Miocene. Most of this volcanic and tectonic activity developed along the boundary between the Cretaceous-Eocene Jalisco block (JB) and the Oligocene-early Miocene Sierra Madre Occidental ignimbrite privince (SMO). This make up this peculiar segment of the volcanic arc both on a regional and local scale. <P>

In the first part of the trip we will examine the impressive normal fault system which bounds the mouth of the Gulf of California and volcanism which occurred in this region since the late Miocene. We will pay particular attention to the Plio-Pleistocene volcanism visiting the Las Navajas peralkaline silicic volcano and the andesitic-dacitic Sangangey volcano. Then we will travel along the main axis of the WMVB, located inside the grabens formed at the boundary between the JB and the SMO. We will have a close look at the pyroclastic deposits of the active Ceboruco volcano and the Santa Rosa-Cinco minas normal fault system, which has reactivated and older shear zone. The following part of the trip is devoted to the volcanism and tectonics of the Guadalajara region with an inspection of the late Miocene to Pliocene volcanic stratigraphy along the Rio Santiago canyon and of the late Pleistocene La Primavera caldera. Finally we will move toward the Guadalajara triple junction, where we will examine the Quaternary normal faulting of the San Marcos Zacoalco half graben and the widely discussed Acatlan ignimbrite. <P>

Approximate cost: 500 US, this will include 4 nights lodging in double occupancy, meals, land transportation, field trip guide and geological maps. <P>

Meeting place: The field trip will begin at the Congress Hotel, January 25, and will end at the Guadalajara international airport, January 29 in the late afternoon. Direct flights connect Guadalajara daily with tens of destinations in the US. Over 25 flights per day to Mexico City allow easy connection to major destinations in Europe, South America and Asia. <P>

Maximum number of participants: 20. <P>

The main purpose of the field trip will consist in visiting outcrops of pyroclastic deposits produced by Quaternary volcanoes (Nevado de Toluca and Jocotitlan) in central Mexico. The volcanic products to be identified cover a wide spectrum and include debris avalanche deposits from sector collapse, pyroclastic surges, pyroclastic flows, lahars, and Plinian fall deposits. Since the area to be visited is tectonically complex we will also discuss the location of the volcanoes and their relationship with the tectonic environment. In addition, we will visit pre-Columbian sites located within the area. <P>

Approximate cost: 390 US, this will include transportation (car rental, gas), 4 nights of hotel (double occupancy), breakfast, box lunch, field guide. All outcrops to be visited will be easily reached by car and/or additional short walks from the road. At the towns or small cities, where we will spend the nights, participants will have the opportunity to visit colonial churches and interact with the local people. Weather is temperate during this time of the year but because we will visit the Toluca summit crater located above 4,400 m a heavy jacket is recommended. <P>

Meeting place: This field trip is planned to start and end at the airport in Mexico City, from Saturday, January 25 through Wednesday, January 29. <P>

The purpose of this field trip is to visit the most recent volcanic manifestations in the southern sector of the Basin of Mexico observing closely the tectonic controls of volcanism, the regional magmatic evolution, and the impact of volcanism on the human settlements and vice versa. The Pleistocene geological evolution of Mexico City is strongly linked to three volcanic phases characterized by different eruptive activity and magma output rate which has derived in the construction of several types of volcanoes with a wide range of sizes (from small cinder cones to huge stratovolcanoes) and activity (from hawaiian to plinian). Volcanic and tectonic activities were coeval with glacial events and development of lacustrine systems. In this region the emplacement of each volcanic edifice is governed clearly by the existing stress field and destruction       is also caused by same tectonic control producing sector collapses of varying sizes. We will visit volcanoes with historic activity, debris avalanche deposits of different scales, graben-nested volcanoes, sites where the tectonic control is evident, etc. Asides the reputation of Mexico City as a crowded and polluted place being the largest and most populated city of the world, we will travel along the most forested areas of the city, archaeological sites where the interaction of human beings with the volcanic phenomena in worth to be seen, and small villages nearby the city where traditional Mexican country side charm can be enjoyed. <P>

Approximate cost: 480 US this will include 5 nights in 3-4 stars hotels, in double room (add 100 US if single room is required), breakfast, lunch, transportation in vans and field trip guidebook. Does not include dinner (prices range from 5 to 20 US). January  is normally dry, sunny and cool in the Mexican highlands. We recommend to bring a windproof parka, sweater, boots, and woolen socks but also your swimming suit. Hiking trails are not difficult but some places are above 3,000 m. <P>

Meeting place: The excursion will start in Mexico City on January 25 meeting at the hotel at 17:00 hrs. Duration of the field trip is 5 days ending in Mexico City on January 30, after traveling down to the south into the states of Morelos and Mexico. <P>

Maximum number of participants: 35. <P>

Citlaltepetl, the highest volcano in North America (5,675 m), is located at the eastern end of the Mexican Volcanic Belt, forming a geographical boundary between the highlands and the coastal plains. It shows a comple evolution with constructional and destructional stages that produced a diverse sedimentation around the volcano, including mostly debris-avalanche, cohesive and noncohesive lahars, ignimbrite, block-and-ash-flow and tephra deposits. Large volumes of deposits are observed in the surrounding areas of the volcano, especially towards the coastal plains, where several populated cities are now settled. The excursion will cover most of the entire spectrum of volcanoclastic sedimentation with examples of each of these deposits, in medial and distal facies, from voluminous avalanche deposits that travelled dozens of kilometers from the vent to lahar and runout deposits. We will also have the chance to visit examples of recent explosive volcanism represented by major ignimbrite and bloc-and-flow deposits, as well as  controversial Miocene breccias that may be formed as a result of the decapitation of a stratovolcano. Discussions and oral presentations are expected in the evenings as a combined Workshop on Volcanogenic Sedimentation and Explosive Volcanism. <P>

Approximate cost: 240 US, this will include hotel accomodation (double occupancy), ground transportation (by vans), breakfast , lunch boxes and excursion guide. The clima is usually warm and humid with occasional rain showers. Small-to-moderate hikes are expected. <P>

Meeting place: The excursion will starts at Mexico City airport in the morning of January 25 and ends in the evening of January 27. <P>

Maximum number of participants: 22. <P>

The purpose of this field trip is to discuss the geological, seismologic, geothermal and human impact of Nicaraguan volcanoes. Visits to the Cerro Negro cinder cone (1992), Momotombo crater lake and geothermal plant and ruins of Leon Viejo (distroyed by the 1610 Momotombo eruption) are planned. The volcan Masaya cinder cones and deposits (7,000 yrBP) at the National Park and in Managua (human and animal casts) will also be examined. We will make short visits to Concepcion (lavas and avalanches), Maderas and Mombacho volcanoes and observe the seismic activity and gas emissions of some of these volcanoes. <P>

Approximate cost: 400 US, will include meals, tranportation and 3 nights (26-28) double room and excursion guide. The excursion will include short walks. Temperature will be  around 30C. <P>

Meeting place: Participants should arrive at the Managua airport on the 26 of January. The excursion will end at the same place late January 29. <P>

Maximum number of participants: 20. <P>

A complete traverse across the different magmaic events from Early Mesozoic to Cenozoic time that are well exposed along the Pacific coast of Mexico. It includes a) granitic and volcanic rocks of the Tertiary continental arc, b) stratigraphy of the Cretaceous accreted oceanic-arc and its related subduction complex, and c) basal Early Mesozoic metamorphosed sequences of ocean-floor affinity. Geochemical and isotopic studies of the wide variety of igneous rocks, their petrogenesis, as well as implications on accretionary and crustal growth processes will be discuss during the field trip. <P>

Approximate cost: 450 US, will include 4 nights double occupancy at 3 to 4 star hotel and meals transportation (VW Combi) and field guide. Nice and warm climate is common this time of the year (80-90F), since most of the excursion runs along the coastal highway. Although two traverses to higher elevation (65-70F) are planned. Rough areas might require small hikes. <P>
 
Meeting place: The field trip will leave Puerto Vallarta early morning (January 25) and ends in Zihuatanejo (January 29). There are good lodging and transportation facilities, including the International airport with direct fly to Los Angeles and other cities in the US. <P>

Maximum number of participants: 25. <P>

<CENTER><br><H2>CLEAN AIR PLANS</H2></CENTER><p><br>
<br><P>AQMD is required to produce plans to show how air quality will be improved.  Recently,  two plans were adopted by the Governing Board.,  the 1997 Air Quality Management Plan and the  Coachella Valley PM 10 Attainment Redesignation Request and Maintenance Plan .  Click on the title of each plan to go to that plan.  </P>

 <A HREF="/aqmp/97aqmp/"> 1997 Air  Quality Management Plan (AQMP)</A>
<P>Every three years,  AQMD prepares an overall plan for the air quality improvement.  Each iteration of the plan is an update of the previous plan and has a 20 year horizon. The AQMP was adopted by the Governing Board on November, 15, 1996.   The main document is available for viewing and to download.  In addition  to the main document,  there are extensive technical appendices,  environmental documentation,  and a socio-ecnomic analysis of the plan.  Due to the size of these documents,  they are only available to download.</P>

<A HREF="/aqmp/cvves/">Coachella Valley PM 10 Attainment Redesignation Request and Maintenance Plan</A>
<P>The Coachella Valley, located in the Salton Sea Air Basin and under AQMD's jurisdiction, has been designated as a serious nonattainment area for PM10.  With application of the U.S. EPA's Natural Events Policy, the Coachella Valley has not violated either the 24-hour or annual average PM10 standards during the last three calendar years (1993 - 1995) and is thus eligible for redesignation to attainment.  This plan, adopted by the Governing Board on December 13, 1996, requests the U.S. EPA to redesignate the Coachella Valley as an attainment area for PM10.  In accordance with U.S. EPA guidance, the plan consists of a demonstration of attainment, a maintenance plan, contingency measures, and a Natural Events Action Plan.  </P>

<P>Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options was adopted on December 8, 1995. As one compliance strategy, Rule 2202 allows employers to invest in the AQIP. Monies received are placed in a restricted account to fund programs that result in equivalent emission reductions that would otherwise have been achieved by the participating employers. Staff evaluated the proposals received during the third quarter of 1996 and this action is to recommend several for funding. The adjusted amount available for this quarter is $986,068. This was reviewed by the Administrative Committee on December 20, 1996, and recommended for approval.

<P>The AQMD is required by Section 44243.5(a) of the Health and Safety Code to provide $1.5 million, on or before January 15, 1997, to the Regional Transportation Agencies (RTAC) or its successor agency for the purpose of enabling regional or county rideshare agencies to provide marketing and client services to maximize voluntary ridesharing in the air basin.  Since RTAC does not have the authority to receive and safeguard funds, AQMD will transfer the money to an agency fund pending direction from RTAC for disbursement.

<P>On September 13, 1996, the Board approved the release of an RFP to select contractors to assist with permit processing when needed to respond to temporary work load increases. A panel has reviewed the proposals submitted in response to the RFP and recommends awarding bids to two firms. In its September action, the Board also reallocated $200,000 in the FY 1996-97 budget for this purpose. This was reviewed by the Administrative Committee on November 22, 1996 and recommended for approval.

This RFQ is for the replacement of 17 NOx analyzers with modern, state-of-the-art equipment. The newer technology would be more reliable, easier to maintain and less costly to operate with proposed staffing levels. A total of $156,000 is available in the FY 1996-97 budget. This was reviewed by the Administrative Committee on December 20, 1996, and recommended for approval.

<P>The Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) program is in its fourth year of implementation and an Automated Gas Chromatograph System is needed for the Burbank PAMS Type 2 Site, slated to be on-line for the 1997 smog season.  This equipment is the most cost effective way to develop the required air monitoring data.  There is $70,000 allocated for the purchase of an Automated Gas Chromatograph in the FY 1996-97 budget. This was reviewed by Administrative Committee on December 20, 1996, and recommended for approval.

<P>AQMD&#146;s federally mandated Title V Operating Permit Program is expected to receive interim approval from EPA in January 1997. Facilities subject to Title V are required to begin applying for a permit within the first year of program implementation. To assist these facilities during this process, AQMD staff has prepared application forms and a Technical Guidance Document (TGD) that will provide simple instruction and clarification on compliance with Title V. The TGD will be updated as needed to respond to program changes and the needs of regulated facilities. This was reviewed by the Stationary Source Committee on December 5, 1996.

<P>Proposed amendments will: 1) lower VOC requirements for electric dissipating and shock-free coatings; 2) replace solvent cleaning operations language with a reference to Rule 1171 provisions; 3) add a transfer efficiency requirement of 65% to be consistent with other AQMD coating rules; 4) replace outdated compliance test methods with current AQMD test methods; and, 5) add an exemption for air brush operations from transfer efficiency requirements. Proposed amendments will result in an emission reduction of approximately 1.4 tons of VOC per day. This was reviewed by the Stationary Source Committee on December 5, 1996.

<H3><A NAME="mission">MISSION</A> </H3>

<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District, by law, is required
to achieve and maintain healthful air quality for its residents.
This is accomplished through a comprehensive program of planning,
regulation, compliance assistance, enforcement, monitoring, technology
advancement, and public education.
<H3><A NAME="whatisaqmd">WHAT IS THE AQMD</A> </H3>

<P>
<IMG SRC="/icon/4cmap.gif" ALT="Map of Basin" ALIGN="RIGHT"> 
<P>
The AQMD is the air pollution control agency for the four-county
region including Los Angeles and Orange counties and parts of
Riverside and San Bernardino counties. This area of 12,000 square
miles is home to more than 14 million people--about half the population
of the State of California. It is the second most populous urban
area in the United States.
<P>
Many of the same factors that make living in Southern California
so desirable also contribute to the worst smog problem in the
nation. Gentle ocean breezes carry pollutants into the inland
valleys where they are trapped by the surrounding mountains. Thermal
inversions act like a lid over the basin. Bright sunshine and
warm temperatures cause some pollutants to react with each other,
forming even more pollution. These natural conditions, along with
the pollution from over 9 million motor vehicles, thousands of
businesses and industries, and countless consumer products, create
an ideal smog factory.
<P>
Different types and levels of air pollution can cause everything
from watery eyes and fatigue to respiratory disease, lung damage--even
cancer. Because this area's smog problem is so severe, AQMD often
finds itself at the forefront of the nation's efforts to reduce
air pollution.
<H3><A NAME="whataqmddoes">WHAT AQMD DOES</A> </H3>

<P>
<IMG SRC="/icon/o3source.gif" ALT="Map of Basin" ALIGN="RIGHT">

<P>
AQMD is responsible for controlling emissions from stationary
sources of air pollution. These can include anything from large
powerplants and refineries to the corner gas station. There are
about 31,000 such businesses operating under AQMD permits. Other
widespread stationary sources include consumer products such as
house paint, charcoal lighter fluid, and thousands of products
containing solvents that evaporate into the air. About 40% of
this area's air pollution comes from stationary sources, both
businesses and residences.
<P>
The other 60% of our air pollution comes from mobile sources--mainly
cars, trucks and buses, but also including construction equipment,
locomotives, trains and airplanes. Emission standards for mobile
sources are established by state or federal agencies, such as
the California Air Resources Board and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, rather than by local agencies such as the AQMD.
<P>
Although AQMD does not directly control pollution from motor vehicles,
we do have transportation-related programs aimed primarily at
reducing the number of cars on the road and promoting the use
of cleaner fuels and vehicles. For example, AQMD's Commuter Program,
Regulation XV, requires employers to encourage their workers to
carpool, use public transit, or even bicycle to work rather than
drive alone. About 6,000 companies employing nearly 2 million
commuters participate. AQMD also sponsors programs to reduce the
number of smoking trucks, buses and cars. We do this in cooperation
with the California Highway Patrol and the thousands of citizens
who call our toll-free number to report smoking vehicles.
<H3><A NAME="how">HOW AQMD CONTROLS POLLUTION</A> </H3>

<P>
<IMG SRC="/icon/o3level.gif" ALT="Map of Basin" ALIGN="RIGHT">

<P>
Controlling stationary sources of pollution includes a wide range
of activities. these begin with AQMD developing and adopting an
Air Quality Management Plan that serves as the blueprint for all
the future rules necessary to bring the area into compliance with
federal and state clean air standards. Rules are then enacted
to reduce emission from specific types of equipment, industrial
processes, paints and solvents, even consumer products.
<P>
AQMD's emissions trading program allows many facilities the flexibility
to choose the most cost-effective means of achieving annual reductions
in air pollution. Other facilities are issued permits spelling
out specific requirements for equipment and operations that emit
pollution.
<P>
AQMD staff conduct periodic inspections to ensure continued compliance
with requirements. We also provide training to help business owners
understand these requirements and keep up with new rules. Most
businesses recognize their responsibility and readily comply.
But, when necessary, AQMD takes enforcement action to bring businesses
into compliance with its rules. State law provides substantial
penalties for the worst Offenders, up to $50,000 per day and/or
a year in jail for each day of violation.
<P>
The &quot;bottom line&quot; of whether or not our efforts are
working is the quality of the air we breathe. AQMD Continuously
monitors air quality at more than 30 locations throughout the
four-county area. This also allows us to notify schools, the press
and the public whenever air quality is unhealthful.
<H3><A NAME="funding">WHERE AQMD GETS ITS FUNDING</A> </H3>

<P>
<IMG SRC="/icon/fund.gif" ALT="Map of Basin" ALIGN="RIGHT"> 
<P>
AQMD's annual operating budget is $97 million. A significant part
of AQMD's revenue comes from fees businesses must pay if they
release large amounts of pollution. Thus, the biggest polluters
pay the most toward funding the air pollution control effort.
Also, businesses must pay annual fees for their permits.
<P>
But motor vehicles account for more than half of this region's
pollution problem. So, beginning in 1991, a surcharge was added
to this area's vehicle registration fees to help fund air pollution
control efforts. This surcharge consists of a $4 per vehicle state
fee and an additional $1 per vehicle districtwide fee. The $1
fee and 30% of the $4 fee from vehicles registered in our four
counties goes to the AQMD to be used for Mobile source programs
such as those promoting ridesharing and developing clean fuels.
Forty percent of the $4 fee goes directly to cities for air quality
improvements involving mobile sources. The remainder is distributed
through an independent panel as grants for programs intended to
reduce vehicle emissions.
<H3><A NAME="progress">PROGRESS SO FAR</A> </H3>

<P>
Air quality in this area has continually improved despite an enormous
increase in population and cars. For example, maximum levels of
ozone, on of our worst smog problems, have been cut to less than
half of what they were in the 1950s, even though today we have
nearly three times as many people and four times as many vehicles.
<P>
In the past decade, we have reduced by half the number of Stage
I smog alerts, the level at which schools are advised to keep
children from playing outside. And, we almost never reach Stage
II levels, which used to occur 15 times a year a decade ago.
<H3><A NAME="jobahead">THE JOB AHEAD</A> </H3>

<P>
<IMG SRC="/icon/jobah.gif" ALT="Map of Basin" ALIGN="RIGHT"> 
<P>
The clean air effort still has a long way to go. even though recent
years have been the cleanest on record, our air still violates
the health standard for ozone on about 120 days of the year (based
on 1993 data). Maximum levels are more that twice as high as the
federal standard for healthful air.
<P>
State and federal law require this area to meet clean air standards
by the year 2010. This may seem like a long time for us to live
with smog. But the cleanup effort is enormous. Even though we
already have the strictest pollution control requirements in the
nation, we still have to reduce some types of pollution by more
than 80% if we are to rid the area of smog. To ensure that we
are making the necessary progress, the law requires us to reduce
these emissions by at least 5% per year.
<H3><A NAME="help">HOW YOU CAN HELP</A> </H3>

<P>
Winning the battle against smog will take more than just placing
tighter controls on smokestacks and tailpipes. A lot of our pollution
comes from the products and services we use every day. All of
us can help by making some simple changes in the way we live:
carpool, use public transit, use clean-formula gasolines, use
water-based paint, avoid aerosol products, recycle, conserve energy.

<h2><CENTER>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</CENTER></h2>
<p><br>
<HR>
<BR>

<h3>How does the air quality regulatory process work?</h3>

Under the Federal Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establishes health-based air quality standards that all states must achieve.  The California Clean Air Act also establishes requirements for cities and counties to meet.  The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) develops <A HREF="/aqmp/">plans</A> and <A HREF="/rules/">regulations</A> designed to achieve these public health standards by reducing emissions from business and industry.  AQMD&#146;s Governing Board adopts plans and regulations for the region and then submits them to the <A HREF="http://www.arb.ca.gov">California Air Resources Board</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov">Federal EPA </A>for approval.  By law, AQMD has jurisdiction over businesses and other stationary sources, while the California Air Resources Board is responsible for reducing emissions fom mobile sources, such as cars and trucks.
<BR>
<h3>
<B>How does the AQMD rulemaking process work?</B></h3>
<P>
AQMD staff develops rules designed to reduce air pollution.  The economic impact of each rule is carefully analyzed and AQMD allows an opportunity for public input on every proposed rule.  At <A HREF="/pub_edu/pubedu1.html">public workshops</A>, the public can voice suggestions and concerns about the impact of a proposed rule.  A final <A HREF="/hb/gb_cal95.html">public hearing</A> is held before the <A HREF="/hb/govbd.html">AQMD Governing Board</A> before it can vote on a proposed or amended rule.
<BR>
<h3>
<B>How can I comment on AQMD rules that might affect my business?</B></h3>
<P>
Public workshops and public hearings provide forums for public participation.  If you wish to receive a written response to your questions or comments, submit your written comments to the appropriate Rule Coordinator.  This person can be identified by calling AQMD&#146;s Public Information Center at (909) 396-3600.
<BR>
<h3>
<B>How can I find out about new rules or amendments?</B></h3>
<P>
There are several ways to keep informed or receive notices about new rules.  AQMD <A HREF="/rules/">Rules and Regulations</A> can be ordered from AQMD&#146;s Public Information Center (909) 396-3600, or downloaded from AQMD&#146;s home page (http://www.aqmd.gov).
<BR>
<h3>
<B>How can I find out how to comply with AQMD rules and requirements?</B></h3>
<P>
Call the Small Business Assistance Office at 1-800-388-2121 to arrange for an AQMD representative to inspect your facility, without penalty, to let you know what is required.
<P>
AQMD also offers<A HREF= "/business/baser.html#cc"> compliance classes</A> designed to help facility owners and operators understand rule and permit requirements.  For more information or to register for a compliance class, call AQMD&#146;s 1-800-425-6247 (<STRONG>1-800-4-CLN-AIR</STRONG>).  Or contact us by <A HREF="mailto:compliance_class@aqmd.gov">e-mail</A> (compliance_class@aqmd.gov).</FONT>
<BR>
<h3>
<B>Cars, buses, and trucks generate more smoke than my business.  Why not concentrate </B><B>efforts on them?</B></h3>
<P>
AQMD and other agencies work to limit emissions from vehicles through the following programs:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>AQMD&#146;s <A HREF="/smog/cutsmog.html">CUT-SMOG Smoking Vehicles Program</A> reduces pollution from cars, trucks and buses.  Citizens are encouraged to call <STRONG>1-800-CUT-SMOG</STRONG> toll-free to report their observations of smoking vehicles.  Over 9,000 smoking vehicle reports are received over this hotline each month.  Owners of smoking vehicles receive Cut-Smog letters advising them that their vehicles have been observed emitting excessive smoke and asking them to take steps to solve the problem.
<P>
<LI>California Air Resources Board requirements will make most <STRONG>new cars</STRONG> sold in this state <STRONG>significantly cleaner</STRONG> than current models.  Also, ARB has established requirements for <STRONG>zero emission vehicles</STRONG>.  By the year 2003, the number of electric cars sold in California will increase ten percent (10%).
</UL>

<BR>
<h3>
<B>Can AQMD provide speakers to discuss air pollution issues with business groups?</B></h3>
<P>
Yes.  AQMD&#146;s Speaker&#146;s Bureau features experts on a variety of topics who are available to speak to civic or business groups.  Just send your request in writing to AQMD&#146;s Public Advisor.  Please be sure to include information about the subject of the meeting, audiences, date, time, etc., so that we may match our speakers to meet your organization&#146;s needs.

<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<IMG SRC="/icon/line.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<P>
<B>The Federal Clean Air Act </B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Objective.  </B>Requires attainment of <I>National Ambient
Air Quality Standards</I> <I>(NAAQS)</I> for <I>criteria air</I>
<I>pollutants</I>, i.e. pollutants causing human health impacts
due to their release from numerous sources.  The following criteria
pollutants have been identified: ozone, particulate matter (PM10),
carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. 
The original 1970 Clean Air Act required attainment by 1975. 
The Act was amended in 1977 and 1990 to extend the attainment
deadlines.  Current deadlines vary by pollutant and severity of
pollution in the region.  The latest deadline is the year 2010
for <I>extreme</I> ozone nonattainment areas (South Coast District
is the only such area).<BR>

<P>
<B>State Implementation Plans.  </B>The Act requires each state
to develop a <I>state</I> <I>implementation plan</I> <I>(SIP)
</I>to attain the NAAQS by the applicable attainment deadlines.
 SIPs must be approved by the Federal Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) as containing sufficient measures to timely attain
NAAQS and meet other requirements described below.  SIPs must
contain air pollution measures in adopted, &quot;regulatory&quot;
form within one year after approval by EPA.  Upon approval by
EPA, SIP requirements can be enforced against regulated sources
by EPA and by any citizen.<BR>

<P>
<B>SIP Requirements</B>.  Among the numerous other SIP requirements
are: a mandate that the region achieve a three percent <B>annual</B>
reduction in emissions of ozone precursors (VOC an NOx); a requirement
that new sources over 10 tons per year of VOC or NOx, and modifications
to such sources, achieve <I>lowest achievable emission rate</I>
and <I>offset</I> their emission increases by equal reductions
elsewhere in the region; transportation control measures to reduce
vehicle trips; and measures to increase average vehicle occupancy
of commuters to employers of over 100 employees.<BR>

<P>
<B>Sanctions, Federal Implementation Plans, and Conformity Findings.
 </B>If the state fails to submit an approvable SIP according
to schedules in the Act, EPA is required to impose one <I>sanction</I>
within 18 months, and a second if the failure is not cured within
another six months.  The sanctions are cutoffs of federal transportation
funds (with certain exceptions) and an increased offset ratio
(2:1) that would make it more difficult for stationary sources
wishing to construct or modify to obtain required permits.  In
addition, EPA is required to, within two years of disapproving
the SIP, promulgate a <I>federal implementation plan (FIP)</I>
to fill the gap in the deficient state plan.  Finally, new <I>conformity</I>
findings, which are required for federal approval or funding of
highway and other projects, cannot be made 120 days after SIP
disapproval.<BR>

<P>
<B>Motor Vehicle Emission Controls.  </B>1970 Act required EPA
to adopt emission limitations for motor vehicles.  The 1990 Amendments
require EPA to adopt regulations to achieve further reductions
in emissions from motor vehicles, as well as from other mobile
sources such as locomotives.  States are preempted from adopting
emission limitations for motor vehicles and certain other mobile
sources.  Exception: California can adopt motor vehicle standards,
and standards for some --but not all-- other mobile sources, and
other states can adopt the California standards.<BR>

<P>
<B>Hazardous Air Pollutants.  </B>In addition to criteria pollutants,
the Act regulates 189 &quot;<I>hazardous air pollutants,&quot;</I>
i.e. those which can cause cancer or other severe localized health
effects due to emissions from a single facility.  EPA is required
to adopt regulations mandating that new and existing sources emitting
10 tons per year or more of such pollutants employ <I>maximum
achievable control technology (</I> <I>MACT)</I> according to
specified schedules.  EPA is to consider further reductions in
the future to eliminate any remaining unacceptable<I> residual
risk</I>.  
<P>
<CENTER><B>CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION LAW<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Agency Responsibilities:<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>California Air Resources Board (CARB):</B> responsible for
adopting motor vehicle emission standards; compiling the SIP for
submission to EPA; approving district air quality plans as sufficient
to meet state legal requirements; and general oversight of districts.
 CARB also has established state ambient air quality standards
for criteria pollutants which are somewhat more stringent than
the NAAQS.<BR>

<P>
<B>Air Quality Management Districts (AQMDs):</B> responsible for
preparing the portion of the SIP applicable within their boundaries;
adoption of control regulations for stationary sources; and implementation
of indirect source and transportation control measures (e.g. employee
ridesharing rules).<BR>

<P>
<B>Councils of Governments, e.g. Southern California Association
of Governments (SCAG):</B> responsible for preparing the portion
of the SIP within certain districts which relate to transportation
control measures, land use, and population projections.<BR>

<P>
<B>The Lewis Presley Act.  </B>Established and specifies authorities
of the South Coast District; specifies planning responsibilities
of District and SCAG as described above.<BR>

<P>
<B>The California Clean Air Act.  </B>Establishes numerous requirements
for district plans to attain state ambient air quality standards
for criteria air contaminants, e.g.: plan must contain measures
adequate to achieve five percent per year emission reductions
or must contain <I>all feasible measures and an expeditious adoption
schedule</I>; 1.5 average vehicle ridership during high commute
hours by 1999; no net increase in emissions from new and modified
stationary sources; and <I>best available retrofit technology</I>
for existing sources.  The state ambient air quality standards
must be achieved as <I>expeditiously as practicable</I>; there
is no firm attainment deadline in state law as there is in federal
law.<BR>

<P>
<B>Toxic Air Contaminants.  </B>The Air Toxic Hot Spots Act requires
facilities emitting specified quantities of pollutants to conduct
risk assessments describing the health impacts to neighboring
communities created by their emissions of numerous specified hazardous
compounds.  If the district determines the health impact to be
significant, neighbors must be notified.  In addition, SB 1731
requires the facility to develop and implement a plan to reduce
the health impacts to below significance, generally within five
years.  Additional control requirements for hazardous emissions
from specific industries are established by CARB and enforced
by districts pursuant to the Tanner Act.<BR>

<P>
<B>Permits.  </B>Under state law and district rules, every piece
of equipment which emits or controls air pollution must have a
permit to operate from the local air district.  The equipment
cannot be constructed without a district permit to construct.
 The district staff must issue the permit if the equipment will
comply with all emission limitations in district rules.<BR>

<P>
<B>Enforcement.  </B>Permit requirements and district rules can
be enforced by districts through actions for civil penalties (up
to $50,000 per day of violation is authorized), by local prosecutors
through actions for misdemeanor criminal penalties, and by either
seeking injunctive orders. <BR>

<P>
<B>Hearing Boards.  </B>Hearing Boards in each district are authorized
to issue temporary variances to sources having difficulty complying
with air pollution rules.  Hearing Boards can also hear appeals
of permit decisions by the district staff, and can issue orders
for abatement, i.e.administrative injunctions to comply.

<CENTER><P><A NAME="summary"></A><B>SUMMARY</B> </P></CENTER>

<P>The South Coast Air Basin has suffered unhealthful air since its rapid
population growth and industrialization during World War II. While air
quality has improved, the residents of the Basin; which encompasses the
areas of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties west
of the mountains; still breathe the most polluted air in the nation. </P>

<P>The 50-year history of the region's air pollution control efforts is,
in many ways, one of the world's key environmental success stories. Peak
ozone levels have been cut by more than half since air monitoring began
in the 1950s. Population exposure has been reduced even more dramatically,
cut by 50% during the 1980s alone, according to a state Air Resources Board
study. </P>

<P>Since the late 1940s when the war on smog began, the region's population
almost tripled from 4.8 million to 14 million; the number of motor vehicles
more than quadrupled from 2.3 million to 10.6 million; and the area has
grown into one of the most prosperous regions of the world. This phenomenal
economic growth illustrates that pollution control and strong economic
growth can coincide. </P>

<P><center><IMG SRC="summary0.gif" ALT="Undisplayed Graphic" ></center></P>

<CENTER><P><A NAME="govern"></A><B>Government</B> </P></CENTER>

<P>The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) is the regional
governmental agency mandated to manage--in terms of regulation of stationary
sources--the quality of air in an area often described as having the most
severe air quality problems in the nation. The AQMD which began operation
on February 1, 1977 was established by the California Legislature pursuant
to the Lewis Air Quality Management Act and encompasses all of Los Angeles
and Orange Counties and parts of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties,
representing over 14 million citizens. It succeeded the Southern California
Air Pollution Control District and its predecessor four county air pollution
control districts, of which the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control
District was the oldest in the nation, having been formed in 1947. The
AQMD Governing Board is composed of 12 members, including four members
appointed by the Boards of Supervisors of the four counties in AQMD's jurisdiction,
five members appointed by cities in the AQMD's jurisdiction and three members
appointed by the Governor, the Speaker of the State Assembly and the Rules
Committee of the State Senate, respectively. The members appointed by the
various Boards of Supervisors and cities consist of one member of the Board
of Supervisors of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties,
respectively, and a mayor or member of the city council of a city within
Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. Los Angeles County cities
have two representatives, one each from the western and eastern portions
of the county. </P>

<CENTER><P><A NAME="budget"></A><B>Budget</B> </P></CENTER>

<P>The AQMD's annual appropriated budgets are adopted for the general fund.
Budgets are adopted on a budgetary basis that includes encumbrances as
expenditures. All annual appropriations lapse at fiscal year end to the
extent they have not been expended or encumbered. Amendments to the budget
must be approved by the Governing Board. </P>

<P>To meet its financial needs, the AQMD utilizes a system of evaluation
fees, annual operating fees, emission fees, Hearing Board fees, contracts,
penalties/settlements and investments which generate approximately 70%
of its revenues. The remaining 30% of its revenue are from an Environmental
Protection Agency grant, Air Resources Board subvention, and California
Clean Air Act Motor Vehicle fees. Beginning with its Fiscal Year 1978-79
Budget, the AQMD no longer received any property tax moneys. </P>

<P>The draft budget consists of two volumes. The first volume is the Draft
Budget and Draft Work Program which presents the primary information regarding
proposed revenues and expenditures for the new fiscal year. The second
volume is the Supporting Documentation which contains detailed expenditure
and program justifications supporting the draft budget and work program
requests. The budget is a line-item budget structured by office and division.
The budget is supplemented with a work program which estimates the expenditures
along program and activity lines. </P>

<P>This draft budget and work program is scheduled for adoption by the
South Coast Air Quality Management District Governing Board at its May
meeting. The period covered by this budget is Fiscal Year 1996-97 which
ends on June 30, 1997. </P>

<P><U>Budget Process</U> </P>

<P>The AQMD has a comprehensive budget process which establishes goals
and objectives and monitors progress in meeting those goals and objectives.
</P>

<P>Up to and including the budget adoption hearing by AQMD's Governing
Board, the public and the business community have several opportunities
to participate in the budget process. The opportunities include: </P>

<UL>
<LI>five meetings of a budget advisory committee made up of business and
environmental representatives </LI>

<LI>three public workshops&amp;emdash;two to discuss changes to the fee
rule and one to discuss the proposed budget and recommendations made by
the California Air Resources Board and Legislature </LI>

<LI>two public hearings&amp;emdash;one on the Goals and Objectives and
one on the proposed budget </LI>
</UL>

<P>The following flow chart represents the major milestones that take place
in the development of the AQMD budget. </P>

<P><center><IMG SRC="summary1.gif" ALT="Undisplayed Graphic" ></center></P>

<P>A 1994 state law (Health and Safety Code Sections 40720,40721) affects
the AQMD budget and budget process in several ways. </P>

<P>The AQMD is required to prepare and submit annually by February 1 to
the California Air Resources Board (ARB) a Three-Year Budget Forecast.
The forecast must be reviewed by the state board with any comments or recommendations
submitted to the Legislature and AQMD by March 1. These recommendations,
if any, may then be incorporated by the AQMD into its budget. </P>

<P>The draft budget and fee projection for the ensuing fiscal year must
be prepared and made available to any person upon request no later than
the beginning of April of each year. Prior to May 15 of each year the AQMD
Governing Board must adopt a final proposed operating budget, including
final fee schedules. The approved final proposed operating budget must
be submitted to the Legislature and the ARB annually by May 15. </P>

<P>The final proposed operating budget submitted by the AQMD becomes operative

<P>The FY 1996-97 proposed budget continues the trend of budget reductions
in response to improving air quality. Both regulated and voluntary emission
reductions and actions to minimize fee increases on businesses have resulted
in reduced revenues to support mandated programs. To continue our progress
toward meeting federal and state health standards, the AQMD has implemented
several new programs such as: market based incentives (RECLAIM), permit
streamlining, source education, business assistance, and technology advancement.
</P>

<P>This draft budget request represents a 2% ($2.1 million) reduction in
expenditures from the FY 1995-96 adopted budget and a 5% ($5 million) reduction
from the current amended budget. Included is a proposed 4% reduction in
staffing (32 positions) from 796 to 764 positions. Since the expiration
of its labor contracts in June 1995, the AQMD has been unable to reach
agreement with its unions and is currently at impasse. No salary or benefit
increases are included in this proposed budget. </P>

<P>Notwithstanding these reductions, the AQMD is proposing an across-the-board
fee increase of 1.2%. This fee increase, which reflects the change in the
California Consumer Price Index (CPI), along with an estimated $3 million
from the fund balance is necessary to make-up for a projected 2.4% decline
in revenues next year. This proposed increase follows a 1.2% CPI fee increase
two years ago (FY 1994-95) and a 4% fee rebate this year (FY 1995-96).
</P>

<CENTER><P><A NAME="air"></A><B>Air Quality</B> </P></CENTER>

<P>The four-county Southern California region, designated for air quality
purposes as the South Coast Air Basin, has the dirtiest air in the United
States. The federal government has designated six pollutants that are pervasive
enough across the nation to warrant national health standards. Called &quot;criteria
pollutants,&quot; these are: </P>

<P>ozone (O<SUB>3</SUB>) <BR>
nitrogen dioxide (NO<SUB>2</SUB>) <BR>
fine particulates (PM<SUB>10</SUB>) <BR>
carbon monoxide (CO) <BR>
lead (Pb), and <BR>
sulfur dioxide (SO<SUB>2</SUB>). </P>

<P>In the past three years, the South Coast Basin has experienced levels
of ozone 2.3 times the federal health standard, carbon monoxide 1.9 times
the standard, and fine particulates 1.6 times the standard (based on the
annual average standard). In 1992, 1993, and 1994 the Basin violated one
or more of the federal criteria pollutant standards an average of 156 days
a year. </P>

<P>In addition, the State of California through the California Air Resources
Board (ARB) sets ambient air quality standards for these same pollutants.
California's standards generally are tighter than the federal Environmental
Protection Agency's, reflecting the conclusion on ARB's part that the federal
standards are not adequate to protect public health in this region. Toxic
compounds also are a potential problem. More toxic pollution is emitted
into the air in the South Coast Basin than in any other region in California.
Fifty-one percent of all toxic emissions from major facilities in California
occur in the South Coast Air Basin, some 67.6 million pounds a year. The
Basin's large number of cars and small sources&amp;emdash;including small
businesses and households using ozone forming consumer products and paints&amp;emdash;compounds
the problem. </P>

<P><U>Air Quality Trends</U> </P>

<P>Ozone levels have fallen by about 50% since peaks in the mid-1950s.
Lead, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide levels have gone down from nonattainment
to full attainment of federal health standards. This past year, 1995, was
the cleanest ozone year on record. </P>

<P>Particulate and carbon monoxide levels have also decreased in the past
decade but not to the degree which ozone has improved. </P>

<P>While our air quality is getting better it remains the most unhealthful
in the nation. In fact, you would have to combine the air pollution from
over 40 metropolitan areas including New York, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia
and Denver to equal the unhealthful exposure in our region. </P>

<CENTER><P><A NAME="mandates"></A><B>Mandates</B> </P></CENTER>

<P>The South Coast AQMD is governed and directed by several state laws
and a comprehensive federal law which provide the regulatory framework
for air quality management in this Basin. These laws require the AQMD to
take prescribed steps to improve air quality. Among the major statutes
are: </P>

<P><U>State Laws</U> </P>

<P>Under state law, the AQMD must develop and submit to the state at least
every third year an Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) demonstrating how
the region will achieve state and federal ambient air quality standards,
or at a minimum demonstrate that all feasible measures are being carried
out to meet state air quality standards. To date, the AQMD's Governing
Board has adopted such plans demonstrating attainment in 1989, 1991, and
1994. Earlier plans in 1979 and 1982 did not show attainment and predicted
continued unhealthful air well into the next century. </P>

<P>Generally speaking, AQMD is responsible for stationary sources such
as factories and businesses. The California Air Resources Board (ARB) is
primarily responsible for mobile sources. The AQMD and ARB share responsibilities
with respect to area sources. The AQMD and Southern California Association
of Governments (SCAG) share some responsibilities with ARB regarding some
aspects of mobile source emissions. Control of emissions from sources such
as airports, harbors, trains, and federal facilities is shared by the federal
EPA, ARB and the AQMD. </P>

<P><B>California Clean Air Act (AB2595)</B> requires air districts in California
to adopt plans to meet state ambient air quality standards expeditiously.
It mandates that AQMD's attainment plans meet several specific requirements,
including: </P>

<UL>
<LI>a 5% per year reduction in emissions (the plan can achieve less than
5% annual reduction if it includes every feasible measure and an expeditious
adoption schedule); </LI>

<LI>Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for new and modified sources;
</LI>

<LI>programs to achieve a 1.5 average vehicle ridership during heavy commute
hours by 1999; </LI>

<LI>Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (BARCT) for existing sources.
</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Lewis-Presley Air Quality Management Act (SB 151)</B> specifies additional,
more stringent requirements for air quality plans in the South Coast area.
It specifies that AQMD has responsibility to prepare the plan in conjunction
with SCAG, which must prepare the portions of the plan relating to demographic
projections, land use, and transportation programs. State law also includes
the following measures: </P>

<UL>
<LI>authorizes AQMD to adopt market incentives such as the emissions trading
program known as RECLAIM as long as they achieve reductions equivalent
to command-and-control regulations; </LI>

<LI>requires AQMD to establish a loan guarantee program using proceeds
from penalties received to help small businesses purchase air pollution
control equipment; </LI>

<LI>requires AQMD to establish a program to encourage voluntary participation
in projects to increase the use of clean burning fuels; </LI>

<LI>requires AQMD to adopt and enforce rules to ensure no net emission
increases from stationary sources. </LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Air Toxics Hot Spots Information &amp; Assessment Act (AB 2588)</B>
requires facilities that emit significant quantities of pollutants to prepare
health risk assessments describing the impact of toxic contaminants on
neighboring areas. If the AQMD determines that the toxic emissions create
a significant risk, the public must be notified. </P>

<P><B>Tanner Air Toxics Process (AB 1807)</B> requires ARB to adopt air
toxic control measures to limit emissions of toxic air contaminants from
classes of industrial facilities. Local air districts are required to enforce
these regulations. </P>

<P>Beginning January 1, 1996 three new laws took effect which place new
limits on ridesharing and the AQMD's fee authority. </P>

<P><B>Senate Bill No. 437 and 772, </B>place restrictions on the AQMD's
ability to require employers to submit trip reduction plans. At its December
8, 1995 meeting the AQMD Board adopted Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle
Mitigation Options and rescinded Rule 1501 - Work Trip Reduction Plans
and Rule 1501.1 - Alternatives to Work Trip Reduction Plans. The new rule
provides employers with a menu of emission reduction options, which employers
can choose to reduce mobile source emissions to meet their site-specific
emission reduction target. </P>

<P><B>Senate Bill No. 962 </B>restricts the AQMD's ability to index emission
fees based on a source's emission potential or percentage of emission trading
credits held. This prevents the AQMD from implementing a fee system that
would maintain level emission fee revenues while emissions are declining.
Emissions are anticipated to decease by 8% annually. This law modifies
the CPI cap on AQMD individual fee increases allowing for increases greater
than the CPI based on a finding by the Governing Board. This will allow
for fee adjustments to cover program costs but not to exceed the cap on
total AQMD fee revenues which is set at the 1993-94 budget plus any increase
in California CPI. </P>

<P><U>Federal Law</U> </P>

<P><B>The Clean Air Act.</B> Under federal law, the AQMD must develop and
submit to ARB for review and submittal to the federal EPA, an element of
the State Implementation Plan (SIP) demonstrating how the region will achieve
federal ambient air quality standards. In the case of ozone the plan was
required to be submitted by November 15, 1994 and for fine particulates,
PM<SUB>10</SUB>, the plan is required to be submitted by February 8, 1997.
Plans for other pollutants were submitted in earlier years. The federal
Clean Air Act mandates that sanctions be imposed on an area if a suitable
plan is not adopted. These sanctions can include loss of key federal funds
and more stringent requirements on new or expanding industries. </P>

<CENTER><P><A NAME="mission"></A><B>Mission</B> </P></CENTER>

<P><U>Goals and Objectives</U> </P>

<P>The mission of the AQMD is to protect public health from air pollution
while being sensitive to the economic needs of the Basin's businesses.
It does this through a comprehensive program of planning, regulation, education,
enforcement, compliance incentives, technical innovation and promoting
public understanding of air quality issues. Over the past several years
the AQMD has implemented a policy of working with regulated businesses
to ensure their participation in making the rules which will impact them.
This cooperative approach has resulted in greater business support for
achievement of air that is healthful to breathe. </P>

<P>To carry out its mission the AQMD has developed a set of Goals and Objectives
which is evaluated and revised annually and presented at a public hearing.
The following Goals have been developed for FY 1996-97: </P>

<UL>
<P>I. Implement, monitor, and update the Air Quality Management Plan. </P>

<P>II. Achieve planned emission reductions through a compliance program
consisting of air quality monitoring, source testing, permit reviews, education,
inspections, and strategic use of penalties. </P>

<P>III. Increase public, business, and government knowledge of air pollution
issues and support for actions needed to attain local , state, and federal
air quality standards. </P>

<P>IV. Develop and implement programs to promote mobile source emission
reductions. </P>

<P>V. Administer an efficient and cost-effective support organization consistent
with achieving clean air no later than the year 2010. </P>

<P>VI. Facilitate development and transfer of new air quality-enhancing
technology. </P>

<P>These goals are the foundation for the AQMD's Work Program. Each goal
is supported by multiple objectives which target specific areas of program
performance. A public hearing to receive input on the FY 1996-97 Goals/Objectives
was held on February 9. 1996. </P>
</UL>

<P><U>Program Categories</U> </P>

<P>The Work Program is organized into nine Program Categories which have
been revised for FY 1996-97 to better describe the AQMD's activities. These
categories are: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Policy Support </LI>

<LI>Monitor Air Quality </LI>

<LI>Develop Programs to Achieve Clean Air </LI>

<LI>Develop Rules to Achieve Clean Air </LI>

<LI>Advance Clean Air Technology </LI>

<LI>Timely Review of New Sources </LI>

<LI>Ensure Compliance with Clean Air Rules </LI>

<LI>Maintain a Program of Customer Service </LI>

<LI>Operational Support </LI>
</UL>

<P>Each activity within the Work Program falls into one of the above categories.
The Work Program ties the goals and objectives of the agency to each of
its program activities, identifying resources, performance measures/outputs
and legal mandates. A complete description of each program category along
with a detailed work program sort by program is included in the Work Program
section. The justifications in support of each activity are contained in
the second volume - Supporting Documentation. </P>

<CENTER><P><A NAME="program"></A><B>Program</B> </P></CENTER>

<P>Developing solutions to the air quality problem involves highly technical
processes to meet the legal requirements of California and federal laws.
</P>

<P><U>Monitoring</U> </P>

<P>The first step is simply to determine the smog problem by measuring
air pollution levels. AQMD today operates 35 monitoring stations throughout
its four-county jurisdiction. These range from full-service stations that
measure all criteria pollutants, as well as some toxic pollutant levels,
to those which measure fewer pollutants in critical areas. These measurements
provide the basis for our knowledge about the nature of the air pollution
problem and for all planning to address this problem. </P>

<P><U>Pollution Sources</U> </P>

<P>The AQMD in cooperation with ARB and SCAG estimates the sources of emissions
causing the air pollution problem. Nature itself causes a small portion
of the emissions and must be considered. In general, the AQMD estimates
stationary and natural sources of emissions. SCAG develops the information
necessary to estimate population and traffic, and ARB develops the information
necessary to estimate mobile-and area-source emissions using the SCAG traffic
data. </P>

<P>AQMD pulls this data together in the AQMP for use in developing the
necessary control strategies. </P>

<P><U>Computer Modeling</U> </P>

<P>The AQMD's planners take monitoring data and estimates of pollution
sources and enter it into state-of-the-art computer programs to model the
movement and peak locations of smog. Through a series of &quot;what if&quot;
questions, planners can look at different control scenarios to determine
what strategies best reduce air pollution at the least cost. </P>

<P>Due to the nature of air pollution, these models can be very complex.
Some pollutants are not emitted directly into the air but are products
of photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. For example, VOCs mix with
nitrogen dioxide (NO<SUB>2</SUB>) and &quot;cook&quot; in sunlight to form
ozone; similarly, nitrogen oxide gases from tailpipes and smokestacks can
be transformed into nitrates or particulates (PM<SUB>10</SUB>). The planners
thus must take into account the location and size of each source, how the
wind carries the emissions, how different emissions react to one another
once they are in the atmosphere, and where the pollution is eventually
carried. This means considerable weather data must be collected along with
the emissions data. </P>

<P><U>Planning</U> </P>

<P>With emissions data and an air quality model in place, planners can
develop possible control strategies and scenarios. As mentioned earlier,
for the most part, strategies to reduce driving are developed by SCAG,
while mobile source control standards are developed by ARB. The AQMD focuses
most of its effort on stationary source controls. </P>

<P>The AQMD has taken a more proactive role in recent years trying to persuade
the EPA to adopt national standards to address sources more appropriately
within EPA's jurisdiction, such as interstate trucks, trains, airplanes
and ships. AQMD's concern is that any emission reductions that are not
made by these sources can only be made up by those sources under its jurisdiction--local
businesses. </P>

<P>Once a plan of emission controls to achieve federal standards is outlined,
the AQMD is required to hold multiple public meetings to present the proposed
control strategies and receive public input. The AQMD also must complete
a socioeconomic analysis of the control program. The AQMD maintains an
ongoing and independent review board of outside experts for both its air
quality and socioeconomic modeling. </P>

<P>To meet federal air quality standards, the 1994 AQMP calls for significant
reductions from 2010 projected baseline emissions: </P>

<UL>
<LI>71% for VOCs </LI>

<LI>55% for sulfur oxides </LI>

<LI>60% for carbon monoxide </LI>

<LI>75% for nitrogen dioxide </LI>

<LI>29% for directly emitted particulates </LI>
</UL>

<P>These reductions, while meeting federal standards, will still not result
in attainment of all California air quality standards since these are more
stringent than federal standards. The attainment plan is estimated to cost
$5.4 billion dollars per year to achieve and will provide $6.2 billion
to $6.9 billion per year in health benefits. </P>

<P><U>Rulemaking</U> </P>

<P>The regulatory process, known as rulemaking, takes the concepts of control
measures outlined in the AQMP and turns them into proposed rule language.
This process involves: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Extensive research on technology </LI>

<LI>Site inspections of affected industries to determine feasibility </LI>

<LI>Typically a year or more of public taskforce and workshop meetings
</LI>

<LI>In-depth analyses of environmental, social and economic impacts </LI>

<LI>Thorough review with appropriate Governing Board Committees </LI>
</UL>

<P>This extensive process of public and policymaker participation encourages
consensus in development of rule requirements so that affected sources
have an opportunity for input into the rules which will regulate their
operations. Once the requirements are developed, the proposed rule, along
with an environmental impact report and a socioeconomic report, is presented
to the Governing Board at a public hearing. Public testimony is presented
and considered by the Board before any rule is adopted. </P>

<P><U>Enforcement and Education</U> </P>

<P>The AQMD then issues permits to construct and operate equipment to companies
to ensure equipment is operated in compliance with adopted rules. Follow-up
inspections are made to ensure that equipment is being operated under permit
limitations. </P>

<P>As regulations have gradually encompassed medium and small businesses,
where the greatest growth in emissions is occurring, the AQMD observed
that permitting and enforcement strategies designed for large, sophisticated
industries simply didn't work for medium and small businesses. Smaller
businesses often face unique problems and require more personal assistance
and information. So in November 1991 the AQMD launched its reform programs
known as &quot;Keeping the Clean Air Promise: New Directions in Air Quality
Management.&quot; </P>

<P>Under New Directions, all AQMD employees were given customer service
training, the issuance of permits was streamlined, and a greater emphasis
was placed on business assistance and education. Inspectors now meet many
business representatives in the classroom, rather than in the courtroom,
and teach them how to comply with AQMD rules. Printing, dry cleaning, and
other industry representatives also have come to the AQMD and provided
our inspectors with training so that staff is more familiar with their
operations. The AQMD underwrites loans to help small businesses buy air
pollution control equipment and actively works with businesses to help
them comply with regulations. So highly regarded were these New Direction
reforms that the Legislature incorporated them into a state law requiring
all air districts to implement them. </P>

<P>A key concept of New Directions was to develop market-based strategies
for reducing emissions. This concept culminated with the adoption of the
historic new program known as RECLAIM. This program gives businesses the
flexibility to seek out the least expensive ways to reduce emissions, including
the flexibility to buy emissions reductions from another firm. Meanwhile,
businesses that can reduce emissions more than required have a financial
incentive to do so because they can sell their excess emissions reductions.
It is estimated that RECLAIM will save AQMD businesses $58 million annually
compared to the traditional command-and-control rules it replaces. </P>

<P><U>Technical Innovation</U> </P>

<P>In the late 1980s, AQMD recognized that technological innovation, as
well as rule enforcement, would be necessary to achieve clean air standards.
So it created the Technology Advancement Office to look for and encourage
technical innovation to assist businesses in reducing emissions, while
maintaining or increasing production. The Legislature supported this effort
by providing a $1 surcharge on every DMV registration fee paid within the
AQMDt. These funds have been matched at a ratio of approximately five-to-one
with funds from the private sector to develop new technologies such as
electric and low-emission vehicles, low-NO<SUB>x</SUB> burners for boilers
and water heaters, zero-pollution paints and solvents, fuel cells and other
innovations. </P>

<P>An additional $4 vehicle registration fee was authorized by the state
legislature in 1990. These fees are administered through the AQMD with
$1.20 going to the AQMD for mobile source emissions reductions, $1.40 subvened
directly to cities and counties to support their air quality programs,
and $1.20 to the Mobile Source Review Committee. This outside panel established
by state law makes the decisions on the actual projects to be funded from
this portion of the revenue. </P>

<P><U>Public Education</U> </P>

<P>In the end, AQMD's efforts to clean up the air will be successful only
to the extent that the public understands air quality issues and supports
and participates in our cleanup effort. Thus, the AQMD undertakes to involve
and inform the public through the Public Advisor's Office, public meetings,
publications, the press, and&amp;emdash;to the extent limited funds are
available&amp;emdash;free and paid public service announcements. </P>

<CENTER><P><A NAME="new"></A><B>New Directions</B> </P></CENTER>
<P>Helping business stay and prosper in the South Coast Air Basin while
meeting clean air goals has become a priority for the AQMD. The AQMD has
instituted a number of programs to help business including offices for
small business assistance and business retention and economic development.
</P>

<P>In 1991, the AQMD initiated its New Directions in Air Quality Management
reform campaign designed to streamline regulatory and permit requirements,
as well as stress compliance education and business assistance. Hundreds
of companies have used AQMD services ranging from small businesses who
have received AQMD loan guarantees for pollution control equipment to major
aerospace companies such as Rockwell, Northrop, and TRW who are using lower-polluting
materials developed with support from the AQMD. The AQMD is a member of
the &quot;red team&quot;, a multi-agency effort at the state and local
level to liaison between business and government to retain jobs. </P>

<P>Continuing its efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs, the
AQMD has reduced the time period between application submittal and permit
issuance. Permit applications are now prescreened for completeness prior
to acceptance with issues now resolved over the telephone to reduce the
number of applications rejected. Applications are also designated for completion
within 7, 30, or 180 days depending on their complexity. The AQMD goal
is to issue as many permits as possible within the 7- or 30- day time frames.
</P>

<P>With over 30,000 sources subject to AQMD regulations, the AQMD has launched
several innovative approaches to maximize the effectiveness of its enforcement
programs during a time of decreasing resources. One of the most successful
efforts is the Targeted Inspection Program, whereby industry-specific or
rule-specific inspections are conducted on all or a significant number
of sources. Targeted inspections not only ensure source compliance but
also work to &quot;level the playing field&quot; within a targeted industry
by identifying unpermitted sources that have evaded the permitting system
and have unfairly competed with those sources complying with AQMD rules.
The AQMD has developed a &quot;Compliance Kit&quot; distributed to businesses
unfamiliar with the clean air mandate to supply basic information to assist
them in complying with AQMD rules. </P>

<P>The AQMD also conducts Source Education classes for facility owners
and operators to provide information about air quality compliance in a
nonadversarial setting. Experienced field inspectors, utilizing training
materials customized for specific industries or audiences, present information
that explains the frequently complex components of air quality rules and
regulations. The goal of the program is to fully integrate air quality
compliance into the standard operating procedures and day-to-day practices
of industry. </P>

<CENTER><P><A NAME="reg"></A><B>Regulatory Reform Initiatives</B> </P></CENTER>

<P>As a follow-up to the success of our New Directions campaign, the Governing
Board in April 1995 adopted its <B>Business Clean Air Partnership</B> proposal
with the guiding principles that the AQMD would: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Work as a Partner with Business and the Community to Achieve Healthful
Air </LI>

<LI>Support Economic Growth and Regional Competitiveness </LI>

<LI>Create More Flexible and Reasonable Paths to Clean Air </LI>

<LI>Require Cost-Effective Clean Air Technologies </LI>
</UL>

<P>These principles have been implemented through the following twelve
action items: </P>

<UL>
<P>I. Create a &quot;Clean Air Stars&quot; Incentives Program to Reward
Businesses that Successfully Comply with AQMD Rules or Exceed Clean Air
Requirements. </P>

<P>II. Eliminate Permitting Requirements for Most Small Equipment Used
in Businesses, Including All New Portable Internal Combustion Engines.
</P>

<P>III. Encourage Plant Expansion and Job Creation by Eliminating the Emission
Debts for All Existing Businesses. . </P>

<P>IV. Establish a &quot;HELP Manufacturers&quot; Program with Incentives
to Attract New <I>H</I>igh <I>E</I>mployment, <I>L</I>ow <I>P</I>ollution
Manufacturers. </P>

<P>V. Cut Red Tape such as by Eliminating the Requirement for Stage II
and III Smog Plans and Streamlining Regulation XV. . </P>

<P>VI. Establish, in Partnership with the Regulated Community, a &quot;Home
Rule Working Group&quot; to Eliminate Duplicative Local, State and Federal
Requirements. . </P>

<P>VII. Seek Legislation to Standardize, Streamline and Simplify Environmental
Permit Applications and Reporting Requirements. . </P>

<P>VIII. Emphasize Cost-Effective New Source Control Technologies </P>

<P>IX. Provide Periodic Checks for All Technology-Forcing Rules. </P>

<P>X. Seek a Level Playing Field for All Business by Establishing a No-Penalty
Amnesty Period for Unpermitted Businesses to Obtain Permits. </P>

<P>XI. Evaluate the Impact of Any New Rule on Local Competitiveness with
Outside Businesses. </P>

<P>XII. Develop an &quot;AQMD Customer's Bill of Rights&quot; </P>
</UL>

<P>By December, 1995 all elements of this 12-point action plan were fully
implemented. </P>

<P>In February, the Governing Board added to its Business Clean Air Partnership
directing staff to implement the <B>1996 AQMD Regulatory Reform Initiative</B>.
This initiative focuses on cutting costs and expediting the permit process
and includes the following specific action items: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Cut AQMD's Size by 50% Over the Next Decade </LI>

<LI>Eliminate Permits for Small Businesses </LI>

<LI>Roll Out the &quot;Green Carpet&quot; - <I>Give businesses speedy permits</I>

<P>The proposed budget for FY 1996-97 represents a decrease of approximately
$5 million from current budgeted expenditures. The amended budget includes
midyear increases associated with AB 2588 Toxic plan reviews; special funding
from the Environmental Protection Agency to implement projects in the areas
of PM<SUB>10</SUB> Technical Enhancement Program, Photochemical Assessment
Monitoring System (PAMS) air monitoring, CALSTART Electric Station Car/corridor
Shuttle Project, and Optical Remote Sensors project; California Air Resources
Board Children's Health Study; and the California Energy Commission Navigation
system and Traffic Data Field Test. </P>

<P>Comparing the 1996-97 budget proposal to the May 1995 adopted budget,
this budget proposal represents a decrease of approximately $2.2 million
over last year's adopted budget. This decrease is due mostly to the reduction
in staffing of 32 positions from 796 to 764 positions. Salary and benefit
increases for AQMD employees have not been included in the FY 1996-97 proposed
budget. The AQMD is presently at impasse with its labor unions. The services
and supplies group of accounts have increased overall by approximately
$1.6 million representing new debt service as the result of refunding the
AQMD's unfunded actuarially accrued pension liability. This debt was previously
accounted for in the salary and benefit group of accounts. The AQMD is
proposing a $640,000 increase in its capital equipment expenditures primarily
to replace worn-out or out-dated equipment. These replacements are consistent
with our Equipment Replacement Plan and will be funded from the Equipment
Replacement Designation in the General Fund. </P>

<P>The pie chart below represents expenditures by office/division. </P>

<P><center><IMG SRC="summary3.gif" ALT="Undisplayed Graphic" ></center></P>

<P><U>Comparison of Revenues</U> </P>

<P>Each year, in order to meet its financial needs, the AQMD Governing
Board adopts a budget supported by a system of permit evaluation fees,
annual operating fees, emission fees, Hearing Board fees, toxic &quot;hot
spots&quot; fees, and transportation plan fees which currently generate
over $58.6 million or about 63% of AQMD revenues. Other sources which include
contracts, penalties/settlements, investment, and miscellaneous income
generate approximately 6% of total revenues. The remaining 31% of revenue
will be received in the form of EPA grants, ARB subvention, and California
Clean Air Act motor vehicle fees. AQMD does not receive any property tax
money. </P>

<P>Overall a decrease in revenue from stationary sources is projected for
FY 1996-97 due in large part to projected declines in emissions of approximately
8% annually and fewer permits to operate projected for renewal next year.
The increase in permit processing fee revenue reflects the anticipated
work associated with implementing the federal Title V permit program. </P>

<P>Mobile source revenues which are subvened to the AQMD are projected
to increase by approximately 3% based on Department of Motor Vehicle estimates.
Transportation program revenues for next year are expected to drop as the
result of, (1) processing less of the triennial commute reduction programs
compared to the processing of the annual analysis which carries a substantially
lower fee; and (2) as a result of the Governing Board's action in December
1995 to rescind Rules 1501 and 1501.1 and replace them with Rule 2202 which
provides several different commute reduction program options. </P>

<P>The Environmental Protection Agency 105 grant is expected to decrease
this year as part of a nationwide reduction in 105 grant activities. The
Air Resource Board subvention is expected to remain flat. </P>

<P>Over the last several years, permit fees collected from stationary sources
has dropped 21% from $66.8 million in 1991-92 to a projected $53.4 million
in 1995-96. </P>

<P><center><IMG SRC="summary5.gif" ALT="Undisplayed Graphic" ></center></P>

<P>Of interest is the fact that 60 % of Basin businesses pay less than
$500 in total fees. The largest 63 facilities pay $100,000 or more annually.

<P><U>Debt Structure</U> </P>

<P><B>Installment Sale Revenue Bonds </B>were issued by the South Coast
Air Quality Management District Building Corporation in August 1988 and
September 1989 for the purpose of financing the building of the AQMD Diamond
Bar Headquarters. The bonds are secured by a pledge of the semiannual payments
to be made by AQMD pursuant to an Installment Purchase Agreement between
the Corporation and AQMD, whereby AQMD is required to make the debt service
payments on the Corporation's bonds. On December 1, 1992, AQMD's obligation
to the Corporation under the installment purchase agreement was refinanced
to take advantage of lower interest rates. </P>

<P>Reserves represent a portion of the fund balance set aside for future
use and are therefore not available for appropriation. These reserves represent
the estimated amount of current and prior years' unperformed purchase orders
and contract commitments (encumbrances) in process at year-end and the
value at cost of office, computer, cleaning and laboratory supplies on
hand at year-end. Designations in the fund balance indicates plans for
use of financial resources in future years. The AQMD is self-insured for
general liability, workers' compensation, automobile liability, premises
liability, and unemployment. These designations have been made to provide
for unanticipated judgments against the AQMD which exceed the budget. The
designation for forecasted revenue deficiencies provides for fee revenue
shortfalls forecasted for the three-year period ending FY 1999-00. The
designation for capital equipment replacement is to provide funding for
the periodic purchase of costly replacement equipment or systems which
have reached the end of their useful life and are identified in the Equipment
Replacement Plan. </P>

<P>As mentioned at the beginning of this section on revenues, the AQMD
receives approximately 63% of its total funding from stationary sources.
Approximately 36% of this funding is based on fees from emissions. The
dramatic decline in emissions in recent years, while benefiting air quality,
has seriously affected the AQMD's ability to carry out its mandated programs.
Emission fee revenues are used to finance air monitoring, regional modeling,
emission inventory, public outreach, and rule development. In addition,
emission fees are used to subsidize the 50% permit processing discount
provided to small business. This heavy reliance on emission fees to cover
basic programs has resulted in significant budget shortfalls in recent
years. In a two-year period, 1990-91 and 1991-92, the AQMD expended 70%
($11,785,392) of its available fund balance to offset significant under
collections in its fee revenues for those years. With AQMD's fee rates
and fee revenues capped, a strong fund balance has become an important
hedge against revenue fluctuations. </P>

<P>As air quality improves, it is understood that the size of today's AQMD
will diminish. The AQMD's Three-Year Budget Forecast identifies reductions
totaling $9.5 million by FY 1998-99. The Governing Board's initiative to
work with the Legislature toward meaningful regulatory reform and to cut
the size of the AQMD by 50% over the next decade, as we reach attainment
of air quality standards, should dramatically reduce the cost to business
while providing for the protection of public health. </P>

<P>
<A NAME="itroduction"></A>The AQMDs budget is funded mostly by the regions major sources of air pollution: regulated businesses through their AQMD permit fees and motor vehicles through a small portion of their owners registration fees.<p>
At Board direction, the AQMD instituted a three-year budget forecast process beginning with Fiscal Year
(FY) 1990-91 based on the Air Quality Management Plan and new
authorities derived from state and federal legislation. In January
1991 this process was formalized by the state with the addition
of Health and Safety Code Section 40452 which requires the AQMD
to annually forecast budget and staff increases proposed for the
following fiscal year and projected for the next two fiscal years.
Beginning in January 1995, with the addition of Health and Safety
Code Section 40721, the AQMD is now required to submit by February
1 of each year its three-year budget forecast to the California Air Resources Board
for their review.
<P>
Both regulated and voluntary emission reductions and actions to
minimize fee increases on businesses has resulted in less revenues
to support our clean air program. Over the next three years, the
AQMD will continue its efforts to reduce its budget as fee revenues
decline through its commitment to its 1991 "New Directions in Air Quality Management" 
and 1995 "Business Clean Air Partnership" reforms.  All are designed to ease the 
regulatory burden on businesses through the implementation of market incentives, 
permit streamlining, source education, business assistance, and technology advancement.
<P>
The AQMD is forecasting continued reductions in staffing through
attrition, if possible, of approximately 4 to 5 percent annually
along with reductions in contracting as programs relating to Title
V and RECLAIM become implemented. This downsizing relies on greater use of technology, which will be implemented as part of a five-year program to upgrade or replace obsolete equipment, due to the age or cost to repair many of AQMDs fixed assets. Despite
overall budget reductions, the AQMD is projecting across-the-board
CPI fee increases of 1.4% in FY 1996-97, 2.0% in FY 1997-98, and
2.0% in FY 1998-99.

<P>
<B><A NAME="About_AQMD"></A>About AQMD</B> 
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District is the regional
government agency responsible for air pollution control in Los
Angeles and Orange counties and parts of Riverside and San Bernardino
counties. AQMD regulations must be approved by the state Air Resources
Board and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
<P>
<B><A NAME="What_is"></A>What is the Governing Board?</B> 
<P>
AQMD's Governing Board adopts policies and regulations that
promote clean air within its four-county area, the smoggiest in
the nation. Federal and state law require that AQMD achieve clean
air standards to protect public health. Before it makes decisions
that affect local residents and businesses, AQMD must consider
ideas and comments from the public. The opportunity to comment
begins in public workshops and ends with a public hearing by the
Governing Board where anyone can testify or present written comments.
The Board usually meets at AQMD's Diamond Bar headquarters on
the second Friday of each month. 
<P>
<B><A NAME="Who"></A>Who serves on the Governing Board?</B> 
<P>
<A HREF="gb.html">The Board has 12 members</A>. Nine are elected
officials. Of these, four are county supervisors representing
<A HREF="la.html">Los Angeles</A>,<A HREF="orange.html"> Orange</A>, <A HREF="riverside.html">Riverside</A> and <A HREF="sanbernardino.html">San Bernardino</A> counties, elected
to AQMD's Board by their Boards of Supervisors. Five are City
Council members representing the cities in each county (because
of its size, Los Angeles County has two representatives). These
members are elected by their respective city selection committees.
The remaining three Board members are appointed by <A HREF="state.html">state</A> elected
officials; one by the Governor of California, one by the Speaker
of the State Assembly and one by the State Senate Rules Committee.

<P>
<B><A NAME="Why"></A>Why are procedures necessary?</B> 
<P>
Government agencies like AQMD must create an accurate public
record of how they conduct the public's business. Documenting
the process is necessary to ensure public participation, fairness
and an accurate account to which you and other interested parties
can refer in the future. Holding public workshops, recording oral
and written comments, responding to those comments, publishing
proposed rules and related reports, holding public hearings and
voting publicly are all based on set procedures -- the building
blocks of effective decision-making. 
<P>
<B><A NAME="What"></A>What happens at Board meetings?</B> 
<P>
Board Members discuss ways to improve air quality and establish
effective clean air programs. The Board receives reports from
AQMD's Executive Officer and staff who recommend new rules or
rule amendments to help reduce air pollution. The Board also hears
public testimony. After a public hearing, the Board may vote to
adopt a rule as proposed or with changes. In some cases the Board
may postpone a decision and instruct AQMD staff to develop a new
proposal. In addition, the Board approves contracts, policies
and various reports. The Board may also act on budget requests
and personnel matters. 
<P>
Agenda items that involve relatively simple administrative
decisions are grouped in what is known as a <A HREF="gb_cal95.html">&quot;consent calendar.&quot;</A>
Board Members and members of the public may comment on any individual
item on the consent calendar. When discussion is completed, the
Board may vote on the consent calendar as a whole. 
<P>
Also during meetings, Board Members report on activities of
various committees set up to explore specific issues. Standing
Board committees include Administrative, Legislation, Off-Road
and On-Road Transportation, Planning/Stationary Sources, and Technology.
Additional committees serve as advisory bodies to the Board. These
include the Advisory Council, the Ethnic Community Advisory Committee,
and committees on Interagency Implementation, Mobile Source Reduction
Review, Trip Reduction and Locomotive Propulsion Systems.

<P>
<B><A NAME="Where"></A>Where you fit in</B> 
<P>
The public is very much a part of the Board meeting. Public
workshops held weeks before the Board meeting give you the opportunity
to learn about proposed rules and major policies. Written reports
on rules or policies are available before Board meetings. Anyone
can testify on any item pending before the Board, but it's best
to prepare your testimony in advance. You can also bring up new
issues during the open comment session at the end of every Board
meeting. 
<P>
<I><B>Off the record</B></I> <br>
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TD>
<BR>
<I>If a Board Member receives information off the record and it
influences the Member's decisions about a proposed rule, the Board
member must put that information on the record. If that information
could substantially influence the Board's vote and was not available
to the public before the close of public testimony, the hearing
must be reopened to allow public comment on the new information.</I>
<P>
</TR>
</TD>
</TABLE>

<P>
<B><A NAME="How"></A>How to testify at meetings</B> 
<P>
Fill out a &quot;Request to Speak&quot; card and give it to
the Board Clerk. The Board Chairman will call your name shortly
before you are scheduled to appear. If there are seats vacant,
you may sit at the front of the auditorium near the speaker's
microphone so you'll be ready to testify. Please limit your testimony
to <B>three minutes. </B> The Chairman may give you more
time if the issue is complex or if you represent a large group.

<P>
If you have prepared written comments along with your testimony,
bring 25 copies with you and give them to the Board Clerk along
with your &quot;Request to Speak&quot; card. Each Board Member
will receive a copy. (Faxes are not accepted.) 
<P>
After all testimony on a proposed rule has been heard, the
Board Chairman closes the public hearing. Then Board Members discuss
the issue and, usually, vote. 
<P>
<I><B>Safe seating</B></I><BR> 
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TD>
<br>
<I>o Be seated when the meeting is called to order. Fire laws
don't allow standing in the aisles.</I> 
<P>
<I>o If the auditorium is full, AQMD sets up nearby &quot;overflow&quot;
rooms where you can sit and watch the Board meeting on video.
If you have asked to testify to the Board, listen for your name
to be called and then move quickly into the auditorium.</I> 
<P>
</TR>
</TD>
</TABLE >
<P>
<B><A NAME="Continuances"></A>Continuances and changes</B> 
<P>
Due to intense public interest and lengthy testimony, the
Board may choose to continue its discussion of an agenda item
at its next meeting. 
<P>
If significant changes are made to a proposed rule or rule
amendment <B>after</B> public notice has been issued,
the Board can hear public comment on the rule at the noticed hearing
but cannot take action on the changed text. The Board must publicly
summarize the text changes and continue the hearing to its next
regular meeting or later. At the continued hearing, the Board
must allow public testimony on the new text before taking final
action. 
<P>
In judging whether a text change significantly affects the
meaning of a rule, the Board considers its impact on emission
reductions and regulated facilities, the content of the original
public notice and the possible alternatives. 
<P>
<B><A NAME="Auditorium"></A>Auditorium dos &amp; don'ts</B> 
<P>
<B>o</B> AQMD's auditorium is equipped with a closed-circuit
video network that captures images from 35mm slides, 8-1/2 by
11 inch printed material and 1/2 inch VHS format videotape. You
may use this equipment to present your own material. For tips
on preparing effective visuals, call AQMD's audio-visual support
staff at (909) 396-2023. <I>NOTE: To guarantee a clear image,
text on overheads should be larger than standard typewriter size--at
least 14 pt--on a white non-glossy background.</I> 
<P>
<B>o</B> If you need to bring an oversized chart to support
your testimony, make sure it is not higher or wider that 18 inches.
If it is, you'll need to get the Board Chairman's authorization
to bring it into the auditorium. Generally, placards, signs or
posters that are longer than 18 inches or have protruding sticks
or handles are not allowed in the auditorium for safety reasons.

<P>
<B>o</B> Megaphones and bullhorns are not allowed in the auditorium.

<P>
For more information about AQMD's Governing Board, contact
the Clerk of the Board's Office at (909) 396-2500. 
<P>
Board meeting agendas and public notices are posted in the
lobby at AQMD headquarters. Proposed rules and amendments, staff
reports and other documents are usually available at the lobby
Public Information Center. 
<P>
If you have a computer and modem, you can access Board meeting
agendas and minutes through AQMD's on-line bulletin board system
(ATDT 19093963621). For help using the on-line system call AQMD's
system administrator at (909) 396-2867. To receive Board minutes,

<P>
The Hearing Board is a quasi-judicial panel authorized to provide
relief from AQMD regulations under certain circumstances. As state
law requires, <A HREF="members.html">Hearing Board members</A> are appointed by, but act
independently of, the AQMD Governing Board.
<P>
<B><A NAME="authorized_to_do">What is the Hearing Board authorized
to do?</A></B> 
<P>
The Hearing Board is authorized to hear:
<UL>
<LI>petitions by companies for variances;
<LI>petitions for abatement orders; <BR>
(An abatement order requires a company operating out of compliance
to take specific actions or to shut down its operation. This is
a severe remedy normally reserved for serious violators.) <BR>

<LI>appeals by companies from the granting of permits, permit
conditions, permit denials and suspensions, denials of emission
reduction credits and denials of pollution control plans;
<LI>appeals by third parties.
</UL>

<P>
After hearing all sides of a case in which individuals or companies
come into conflict with AQMD rules and regulations, the Hearing
Board weighs the evidence and reaches a decision.
<P>
<B><A NAME="not_authorized">What is the Hearing Board NOT authorized
to do?</A></B> 
<P>
It is important to note that the Hearing Board is not authorized
to:
<UL>
<LI>modify rules;
<LI>exempt a business from complying with a rule;
<LI>grant a variance from a violation of the public nuisance law,
such as one that creates an odor problem or threatens public health
or property; or
<LI>review a violation notice in any way.
</UL>

<P>
<B><A NAME="variance">What is a variance?</A></B> 
<P>
A variance is an administrative exception to a law. A variance
allows a company to continue operating in violation of AQMD rules
without penalty while it takes appropriate steps to meet air pollution
control requirements. Variances can be granted only by the AQMD
Hearing Board, not by AQMD inspectors or engineers.
<P>
There may be good reasons why a company can't immediately comply
with air pollution control laws. But operating outside the law
can result in a fine, or even the shutdown of an operation. The
only legal way to operate while working toward a solution without
being subject to penalties is to get a variance.
<P>
<B><A NAME="basis_variance">Basis for granting or denying a variance
</A></B>
<P>
The Hearing Board must make six findings on a case before a variance
can be granted <I>(Section 42352, California Health &amp; Safety
Code)</I>.
<UL>
<LI>That the petitioner for a variance is, or will be, in violation
of Section 41701 or of any rule, regulation, or order of the district.
<LI>That, due to conditions beyond the reasonable control of the
petitioner, requiring compliance would result in either:
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
an arbitrary or unreasonable taking of property, or the practical
closing and elimination of a lawful business.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<LI>That the closing or taking would be without a corresponding
benefit in reducing air contaminants.
<LI>That the applicant for the variance has given consideration
to curtailing operations of the source in lieu of obtaining a
variance.
<LI>During the period the variance is in effect, that the applicant
will reduce excess emissions to the maximum extent feasible.
<LI>During the period the variance is in effect, that the applicant
will monitor or otherwise quantify emission levels from the source,
if requested to do so by the district, and report these emission
levels to the district pursuant to a schedule established by the
district.
</UL>

<P>
<I>Additional information the Hearing Board must consider in making
these six findings is provided in<B> <A HREF="/rules/html/tofc5.html">AQMD Regulation V</A>.</B></I>

<P>
<B><A NAME="types_of_variances">Types of variances </A></B>
<P>
There are four types of variances:
<P>
<U><B>Emergency</B></U> 
<P>
When a situation develops without warning (such as an equipment
breakdown, power failure, or similar event that could cause a
violation of AQMD rules) an <B>emergency variance</B> is required.
Any member of the Hearing Board may grant an emergency variance,
without public notice or hearing.
<P>
<U><B>Interim</B></U> 
<P>
For immediate coverage other than for emergencies, an <B>interim
variance</B>--which does not require a public notice period--can
be obtained to cover the time until a hearing for a <B>short or
regular variance</B> can be held. An interim variance may be requested
at the same time either a short or regular variance is requested.
The Hearing Board is required by law to find <B>good cause</B>
to grant an interim variance. That means there has to be a good
reason why the company could not have filed its petition in time
for the hearing to be announced to the public.
<P>
<U><B>Short</B></U> 
<P>
Companies that can comply with AQMD rules within 90 days or less
should request a <B>short variance</B>. A short variance requires
a 10-day posted notice, plus five days processing time before
the request can be heard.
<P>
<U><B>Regular</B></U> 
<P>
Companies that need more than 90 days to comply with AQMD rules
should request a <B>regular variance</B>. The variance period
is usually one year or less, but can be longer if a specific compliance
schedule is set. An application for a regular variance must be
filed at least 45 days before the request can be heard.
<P>

The Hearing Board is required by law to give public notice of
hearings. You'll receive a copy of the notice.
<P>
AQMD <A HREF="/rules/html/r303.html">Rule 303</A> provides a detailed
description of all Hearing Board fees. At the time you apply,
you will be charged a &quot;filing fee.&quot; If you file for
an interim variance at the same time you petition for a regular
or short variance, you pay only one filing fee. <A HREF="smallbs.doc">Small businesses</A>
are eligible for a discount on some fees.
<P>
If public notice must be printed in a newspaper (regular variance
and appeals), you will also be charged a &quot;publication fee.&quot;
After your hearing, you will have to pay a &quot;daily appearance
fee.&quot;
<P>
If your variance is granted, there will be an &quot;<A HREF="exfees.doc">excess emission
fee</A>&quot; based on the weight and opacity (smokiness) of the excess
emissions discharged during the period the variance is in effect.

<LI>Dates by which your equipment can be installed; and
<LI>Your plan for reducing emissions until then.
</UL>

<P>
You may choose to seek the services of an attorney in presenting
your case. If you plan to represent yourself, be sure to know
what rules you are violating, your excess emissions, and how and
when you plan to come into compliance. It is helpful to bring
along any technical experts who are assisting you in resolving
your problem.
<P>
Remember to bring copies of your current permits. The Hearing
Board needs 10 copies of any and all documents presented.
<P>
Variance hearings are like courtroom proceedings. Both the variance
petitioner and the SCAQMD, represented by the District Prosecutor's
Office (909) 396-3400, present evidence through witnesses who
are placed under oath. Witnesses may be cross-examined by the
opposing side and questioned by Hearing Board members.
<P>
Among other issues, the Hearing Board attempts to discover why
and how the rule is being violated, whether the violation could
have been prevented, what is being done to correct the violation,
when corrections will be completed, what will happen to the business
if it is forced to shut down, how the violation affects the public,
and what efforts can be made to reduce excess emissions to the
maximum extent feasible.
<P>
AQMD may argue against a variance or suggest certain limiting
conditions. The public is invited to present any information important
to the case. Board members then close the hearing and discuss
the case among themselves before reaching a decision.

For more information about how to request a variance, call AQMD's
Clerk of the Board's Office at (909) 396-2500.
<P>
If you need help understanding the technical aspects of the rule
you violated, call the Hearing Board Liaison at (909) 396-2000.
<P>
If you have questions about the variance process, call the AQMD
District's Prosecutor's Office and ask to speak with the Duty Deputy
at (909) 396-3400.

<A HREF="#phone">Some informational Telephone numbers</A> 
<P>
<A NAME="intro"></A>The symptoms are familiar to all those who
live in cities where the air is polluted: aching lungs, wheezing,
coughing, headache. Millions of residents of the South Coast Basin
(which includes Los Angeles, Orange, and parts of San Bernardino
and Riverside counties) breathe dirty air some one-third the days
of the year.
<P>
Ozone levels here, or what most refer to as smog, are often twice
the federal health standard. In 1995, the standard was exceeded
on 98 days at one or more Basin locations, most frequently in
the east San Gabriel Valley.
<P>
What does all of this polluted air do to the body? The answer
depends on the situation. How long a person is exposed to pollution,
the type and concentration, the place, time and day, temperature,
weather and more.
<P>
But one thing is certain: Smog is harmful to your health.
<P>
Lungs are ozone's primary target. Studies on animals show that
ozone damages cells in the lung's airways, causing inflammation
and swelling. It also reduces the respiratory system's ability
to fight infection and remove foreign particles.
<P>
Ozone may pose a particular health threat to those who already
suffer from respiratory problems such as asthma, emphysema and
chronic bronchitis. About 10% of the basin's approximately 14
million residents fit into this category. Ozone may also pose
a health threat to the young, elderly and cardiovascular patients.
<P>
Ozone affects healthy people as well. In 1990, the State Air Resources
Board established a new health advisory level in response to mounting
evidence that smog affects healthy, exercising adults at lower
levels than previously believed. Now, a health advisory is issued
at .15 parts per million (on the pollutant standards index) before
a first stage smog alert is called when ozone levels reach .20
ppm.
<P>
During a health advisory, everyone, including healthy adults and
children are advised to avoid prolonged, vigorous outdoor exercise.
Susceptible individuals, including those with heart or lung disease,
should avoid outdoor activities until the advisory is cancelled.
<P>
Currently, the federal Environmental Protection Agency is reviewing
the adequacy of the federal health standard for ozone and is considering
tightening it.<BR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="source"></A>Sources of Smog</B> 
<P>
The sources of pollution include emissions from on-road vehicles,
non-road vehicles like planes, ships and trains, industries, and
even small businesses and households where polluting products
are used.
<P>
Ozone, an invisible gas, is not emitted directly into the air,
but forms when nitrogen oxides from fuel combustion and volatile
organic gases from evaporated petroleum products react in the
presence of sunshine. Ozone levels are highest during the warm
months when there is strong sunshine, high temperatures and an
inversion layer.
<P>
Nitrogen oxides are produced when fossil fuels are burned in motor
vehicles, power plants, furnaces and turbines.
<P>
Carbon monoxide is a by-product of combustion that comes almost
entirely from motor vehicles.
<P>
Fine particulates, which are emitted directly as smoke and diesel
soot and form in the air out of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides,
obscure visibility and can be inhaled deep into the lungs.<BR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="historical"></A>Historical Perspective</B> 
<P>
During the early years of World War II, Los Angeles residents
began to realize the consequences of an increasingly industrialized
area. Investigations began to determine the cause of resident's
eye irritation, crop damage, severe reductions in visibility and
the rapid deterioration of rubber products. &quot;Smog&quot; became
a familiar word and everyday presence and scientists and medical
personnel began to look at its effects on public health.
<P>
In the mid-1950s, the state of California's Public Health division
started to step up its efforts to define the problem of how and
where smog forms, as well as address the health concerns associated
with exposure to smog. Ozone levels were reaching peaks of .68
parts per million, more than six times the federal health standard.
Early efforts to study the health effects of exposure to air pollution
focused on acute exposure episodes. Only recently have the long-term
exposure effects been addressed.
<P>
In a 1956 survey sent out by the Los Angeles County Medical Association,
physicians reported the following:
<UL>
<LI>94.7% recognized the existence of a &quot;smog complex&quot;
involving eye irritation, irritation of the respiratory tract,
chest pains, cough, shortness of breath, nausea and headache;
<LI>56.1% have &quot;authenticated cases of individuals leaving
this area solely because of smog&quot;;
<LI>43.3% have recommended that patients move from the area on
account of the effect of smog on their health;
<LI>86.7% have observed that patients with respiratory diseases
are more susceptible to smog than healthy adults;
<LI>68% believe that patients with cardiac diseases are more susceptible
to smog than healthy adults;
<LI>89.6% have noticed patients with allergies are more susceptible
to smog than healthy adults; and
<LI>81.3% believe that smog is a contributing factor to cancer
of the lungs and air passages.
</UL>

<P>
<B><A NAME="disaster"></A>Historic Air Pollution Disasters</B>

<P>
There have been several episodes in history which illustrate the
harmful effects of acute short-term exposure to air pollution.
Among those include:
<P>
<I>Belgium's Meuse Valley</I> 
<P>
During a five-day fog in December 1930, 63 people died, most of
the deaths occurring on the fourth and fifth days. Older persons
with previously known diseases of the heart or lungs accounted
for the majority of fatalities. The signs and symptoms were primarily
those caused by a respiratory irritant. They include chest pain,
cough, shortness of breath and irritation of the eyes. Sulfur
dioxide gas is suspected as the cause of the disaster.
<P>
<I>Donora, Pennsylvania</I> 
<P>
Twenty people died and approximately 7,000 or 50% of the population,
experienced acute illness during the week of Oct. 25, 1948, when
temperature inversion and air stagnation occurred. Persons of
all ages became ill, but those over 55 were more severely affected.
Those with previous heart or respiratory disease, particularly
bronchial asthma, suffered most.
<P>
Symptoms were primarily respiratory and secondarily gastrointestinal,
and included cough, sore throat, chest constriction, shortness
of breath, eye irritation, nausea and vomiting. The onset of the
illness for most persons occurred on the evening of the third
day. Of the 20 who died, 14 had some known heart or lung disease.
<P>
<I>London, England</I> 
<P>
Three episodes during which heavy fogs and air pollution were
associated resulted in the death of nearly 5,000 people - in 1948,
1952 and 1956.
<P>
The episode in December of 1952 alone, resulted in at least 3,000
deaths more than expected for that time of year. Although the
increase was present in every age group, the greatest increase
was in the age group of 45 years and over. More than 80% of these
deaths occurred among individuals with known heart and respiratory
disease.
<P>
During each of these incidents, comparable conditions were present:
limited air supplies as a result of low-lying temperature inversions
and faint winds, and a continuing heavy output of air pollution
from multiple sources.
<P>
Also, in none of the incidents was technology sophisticated enough
to properly monitor the air and diagnosis of the specific causes
of the illness and deaths were based on limited evidence gathered
after the disasters.<BR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="effect"></A>Health Effects Studies</B> 
<P>
Since the 1950s, medical evidence chronicling the effects of air
pollution on the human body has continued to mount. Here are summaries
of some of the most recent medical studies:
<UL>
<LI>A 1989 study funded by AQMD and conducted by Dr. Jane Hall
of Cal State Fullerton found that meeting federal clean air standards
for ozone and fine particulates in the South Coast region would
provide $9.4 billion in health-related benefits each year. The
study found that 98% of the four-county basin's population of
13 million is exposed to unhealthful air, with children especially
vulnerable. In addition, 1,600 people die prematurely as a result
of exposure to air pollution, according to the study.
<LI>In 1991, as a follow up to the study, Hall looked at how air
quality impacts minority communities. The study showed that minorities
as a whole were shown to be exposed more often to poor air quality
since they tend to live in more polluted air where housing is
affordable. African-Americans and Hispanics generally breathe
the worst air, partly because they tend to work in outdoor occupations.
<LI>Children are the focus of a study funded by the California
Air Resources Board that began in spring 1992 and will track 9,600
fourth, eighth and twelfth grade students for up to 10 years to
assess the potential health damage from continued exposure to
ozone, fine particulates and atmospheric acidity. The lead scientist
on the project is Dr. John Peters of the University of Southern
California.
<LI>David Abbey, Ph.D., of Loma Linda University, studied a group
of 6,340 Seventh Day Adventists living throughout California (62%
lived in the Basin). Results of the study suggest a relationship
between long term exposure to air pollution and the development
of specific chronic diseases. Residents living in areas which
exceeded state and federal standards for suspended particulates
on 42 days or more per year had higher risks of respiratory diseases,
including a 33% greater bronchitis risk and 74% greater asthma
risk. In addition, women living in those high particulate areas
had a 37% higher risk of developing some form of cancer.
<LI>In 1987, Drs. Russell Sherwin and Valda Richters of USC examined
the health of 152 young people, between the ages of 15 and 25,
who died suddenly from accidents or homicide. In lung autopsies
of over 100 of the subjects, slight lung airspace inflammation
was found in 75% of the group, with severe damage in 27%. In addition,
all of the youths examined had some degree of airway inflammation,
while 39% had severe illness in the bronchial glands and 29% had
severe illness in their bronchial linings. Combined, about 54%
of the youths examined had at least one site of severe illness.
While no evidence has been found to deter-ine the levels of smoking
or other contributing factors that could have affected their health,
these youths appear to have provided the first positive proof
of health damage from long-term exposure to poor air quality.
<LI>A study conducted by Dr. Roger Detels of UCLA on chronic obstructive
respiratory disease (CORD) looked at residents of three Southern
California areas (Long Beach, Glendora and Lancaster) with different
types and levels of air pollution.<BR>
Participants aged 7 to 59 were questioned about lifestyle habits
and examined using lung function tests and histories to record
exposures to pollutants from workplaces and personal habits, such
as smoking.<BR>
Researchers followed those participants for more than five years
and found that the residents who lived in the more polluted areas,
Long Beach and Glendora, which experience numerous days of unhealthful
air, had more symptoms of respiratory diseases such as bronchitis
and asthma, while the residents of Lancaster had measurably fewer
symptoms of those illness.
<LI>Athletes may be relatively young, healthy, physically fit
and nonsmokers, but they may be among the most vulnerable to the
effects of inhaled ozone (and other environmental pollutants),
according to Dr. Henry Gong of UCLA. Endurance studies suggest
that athletic performance may begin to suffer at the .12 ppm level
of ozone (the federal health standard), and is very likely at
.20 ppm for most athletes exercising heavily for one or more hours.
<LI>Fine particulate pollution -- even at levels below the federal
health standard -- can shorten lifespans by two years, according
to a 16-year study by Harvard University researchers. In a study
of 8,111 residents of six U.S. cities, particle pollution was
strongly associated with excess deaths from lung cancer and heart
disease -- even when other lifestyle risks such as cigarette smoking
were factored out.<BR>
The six cities studied -- Watertown, Mass., Harriman, Tenn., St.
Louis and Steubenville, Ohio, Portage, Wis. and Topeka, Kan. --
all have PM10 levels below the federal health standard. In contrast,
the South Coast Air Basin has some of the worst PM10 pollution
in the nation, nearly twice the federal health standard.
<LI>A study by C. Arden Pope III, Ph.D., of Brigham Young University
found that particulate pollution reduces the average life expectancy
by one to three years in some of the most polluted cities.<BR>
There have been many Environmental Protection Agency studies looking
at health effects. Some findings include:
<LI>A study of 10 adult men exposed to .12 ppm ozone for 6.6 hours
(including five hours of moderate exercise), found that lung function
decreased and respiratory symptoms (coughing and breathing discomfort)
increased over the more than six hours of exposure.
<LI>In a study done on rats, continuous low level exposure to
ozone caused restrictive lung disease. Removal of the rats from
the ozone environment to one of clean, filtered air appeared to
reverse the disease state back to normal. However, the study indicated
that since people do not breathe filtered air, ozone exceedances
in numerous cities would appear to promote pulmonary fibrosis.
<LI>In a field study of children during normal activities at summer
camp, lung function measurements were taken before, during and
after ozone levels reached above .12 ppm on four days and .18
ppm on one day. Lung function failed to return to its pre-episode
level for many days after the ozone episode had passed.
<LI>An acute exposure of humans to .40 ppm ozone initiates biochemical
changes in the lung resulting in the production of components
which contribute to inflammation and acute lung damage and which
can lead to long term effects such as fibrosis. A study was initiated
to determine if prolonged exposure to low levels of ozone would
produce similar biochemical changes. Non-smoking males were randomly
exposed to filtered air and either .10 ppm or .08 ppm of ozone
for 6.6 hours with moderate exercise. The study concluded that
exposure of humans to low levels of ozone is sufficient to cause
an inflammatory reaction in the lungs.<BR>

<B><A NAME="children"></A>Children and smog</B> 
<P>
A 1984 study conducted by Dr. Kay Kilburn, M.D., Professor of
Medicine at USC showed that children raised in the South Coast
Air Basin suffer a 10% to 15% decrease in lung function compared
to children who grow up where the air is less polluted.
<P>
The California Air Resources Board has concluded that &quot;since
the lungs of children are not fully developed, early damage to
the respiratory tract could increase the risk of respiratory disease
in adult life.&quot;
<P>
Jane Hall's 1989 study on the health effects of air pollution
on residents of the South Coast Air Basin estimated that school-age
children, who represent only 20% of the basin's population, experience
more than 40% of the symptoms associated with exposure to ozone.
<P>
Because of their physiology, children are much more likely than
adults to develop smog-related lung damage. For their body size,
children inhale several times more air than adults, and they breathe
faster, particularly during strenuous physical activity. In addition,
they spend more time outdoors than any other segment of the population
according to the AQMD study.
<P>
Dr. Robert F. Phalen, Ph.D., professor of community and environmental
medicine and director of the Air Pollution Health Effects Laboratory
at the University of California, Irvine, says that when children
exercise, they tend to breathe through their mouths.
<P>
According to Phalen, mouth-breathing bypasses the natural filtering
of air pollutants by the nose and allows large volumes of polluted
air to affect the more sensitive areas of children's lungs which
are still developing.
<P>
Studies show that children exposed to summer ozone pollution year
in, year out, have a greater susceptibility to respiratory infections
because chronic exposure to smog impairs their immune system.
<P>
Research findings also suggest that, even if children do not show
symptoms while exercising in unhealthful air, they are likely
to suffer a loss in lung function compared to youngsters who grow
up where the air is less polluted.<BR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="standard"></A>Air quality standards and health</B>

<P>
State and federal governments have set health standards for pollutants,
specifying levels beyond which the air is unhealthful.
<P>
California's state standards for air pollutants are more stringent
than the federal government's. It is up to each individual state
to determine if they want to set tougher standards.
<P>
Standards are set to provide an adequate margin of safety in the
protection of public health. Under the federal Clean Air Act,
EPA must base standards solely on health considerations and not
economics or technology.
<P>
The standards for pollutants in California include:
<P>
<B>Ozone </B>(one-hour average)
<P>
<I>Federal</I> = Not to exceed .12 ppm (parts per million) more
than one day per year. That means no more than .12 of a volume
of ozone per million volumes of air.
<P>
<I>State</I> = Not to equal or exceed .09 ppm
<P>
<B>Carbon Monoxide</B> 
<P>
<I>Federal</I> = Not to exceed 35 ppm for one-hour average; 9.4
ppm for eight-hour average
<P>
<I>State</I> = Not to exceed 20 ppm for one-hour average; 9 ppm
for eight-hour average
<P>
<B>PM 10 </B>(particles 10 micrometers (millionths of a meter)
or less in diameter)
<P>
<I>Federal</I> = 150 micrograms per cubic meter of air for 24-hour
average (arithmetic mean); 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air
for annual average (arithmetic mean)
<P>
<I>State</I> = 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air for 24-hour
average; 30 micrograms per cubic meter of air for annual average
(geometric mean).
<P>
<B>Nitrogen Dioxide</B> 
<P>
<I>Federal</I> = .52 ppm for one-hour average
<P>
<I>State</I> = .25 for one-hour average<BR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="episodes"></A>Smog episodes and what they mean</B>

<P>
Various levels of smog episodes are reported for the pollutant
ozone. The declaration of a first, second or third stage smog
alert is based on the degree of health risk. The protective actions
help to reduce exposure to unhealthful levels of ozone, but those
who are especially sensitive should contact their physician for
more specific advice.
<P>
Generally, in the event of a smog alert, outdoor activities should
be scheduled for morning or early evening hours to avoid the mid-day
peak when ozone levels are at their highest.
<P>
Hourly updates on air pollution levels are available to the public
through the AQMD's toll-free, taped telephone information service.<A NAME="phone"></A>
<P>
The number for residents of Los Angeles is (800) 242-4022, (800)
445-3826 for Orange County and (800) 322-4710 for Riverside/San
Bernardino counties.
<P>
AQMD also provides a live, toll-free line at (800) 242-4666, where
callers can ask specific questions about air pollution conditions.

<B>JANUARY-AUGUST 1995 AIR QUALITY:<BR> A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS</B> <P></FONT>
</CENTER>
A brief preliminary analysis of 1995 air quality in the South
Coast Air Basin (SOCAB) and the portions of the Southeast Desert
Air Basin monitored by the District (SEDAB) has been performed
based on the available data for January - August 1995. During
the first eight months of 1995, maximum pollutant concentrations
recorded in the SOCAB exceeded state and federal standards for
ozone, carbon monoxide and PM10, and the state standard for sulfate.
In the SEDAB, state and federal standards for ozone and PM10 were
exceeded. Standards for nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and
lead were not exceeded at any District monitoring station.
<P>
Figure 1 shows the maximum pollutant concentrations as percentages
of the standard for January - August 1995 compared to the maxima
for the previous four years. Data were not available for the entire 8-month period for some pollutants
(PM10 - 6 months of data, sulfate and lead - 5 months). The limited
statistics presented in this preliminary analysis are also based
in part on unvalidated data (July and August data is not validated)
and are subject to revision. Tables of detailed statistics for
individual areas will be published in subsequent issues as complete
validated data becomes available for all pollutants.

* Statistics for1995 are based on January-August data for O3,
CO, NO2 and SO2, January-June for PM10 and January-May for lead
and sulfate. July-August data are preliminary and unvalidated.
<P>
**Higher lead concentrations were recorded at special monitoring
sites adjacent to sources. Maximum monthly averages were 3.66
<TT>&#181;</TT>g/m3 in 1991, 0.80 <TT>&#181;</TT>g/m3 in 1992,
1.83 <TT>&#181;</TT>g/m3 in 1993, 1.66 <TT>&#181;</TT>g/m3 in
1994 and 0.60 <TT>&#181;</TT>g/m3 in January-May 1995.

<P>
</CENTER>
Air quality for January - August 1995 may be briefly summarized
as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<B>OZONE</B> - the maximum 1-hour average ozone concentration
(0.26 ppm recorded in Central San Bernardino Mountains) for January
- August 1995 was 200% of the federal standard and 260% of the
state standard. The annual maximum for 1994 was 0.30 ppm. The
approximate number of days in January - August 1995 exceeding
the state standard, federal standard, health advisory level, and
stage 1 episode level is shown in Figure 2. The number of ozone
exceedances in January-August 1995 is the lowest of record for
the period. This makes it possible that 1995 will be a record low year. However, the number of exceedances recorded is still greater than recorded in any
other area of the U. S. in any recent year.

<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="/icon/preo395.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Figure 2" height=420 width=600><BR>
* Preliminary unvalidated data used for July and August 1995.
<P>
<B>Figure 2 - Ozone<BR>
January-August Exceedances of Standards and Episode Levels, 1976-1995</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>CARBON MONOXIDE</B> - The maximum 8-hour average CO concentration
during January - August 1995 (10.6 ppm recorded in Central Los
Angeles County) was 111% of the federal standard and 116% of the
state standard. This is much lower than the annual maximum for
1994 (18.1 ppm). Because highest levels occur during late fall
and winter months, higher concentrations and additional exceedances
are very likely to occur before the end of 1995.
<P>
<B>NITROGEN DIOXIDE</B> - No exceedances of the state standard
have been recorded so far in 1995. The maximum 1-hour average
NO2 concentration for January - August 1995 (0.21 ppm in Central
Los Angeles County) was 81% of the state standard. The annual
maximum for 1994 (0.24 ppm) was 92% of the standard.
<P>
<B>SULFUR DIOXIDE</B> - Sulfur dioxide concentrations continued
to remain well below the state and federal standards. The maximum
1-hour average SO2 for January - August 1995 (0.05 ppm, in Southwest
Coastal Los Angeles County) was 19% of the state standard.
<P>
<B>PM10</B> - The federal and state PM10 standards were exceeded
during January - June 1995. The maximum 24-hour average PM10 concentration
(219 <TT>&#181;</TT>g/m3 in Metropolitan Riverside County) was
145% of the federal standard and 429% of the state standard, considerably
higher than the maximum for all of 1994. However, it should be
noted that this event was associated with a Santa Ana wind event
and increased dust loadings. The 1994 annual maximum (161 <TT>&#181;</TT>g/m3)
was 107% of the federal and 315% of the state standard.
<P>
<B>SULFATE</B> - The state sulfate standard was exceeded in 1995.
The maximum concentration recorded during January - May 1995 (26.3
<TT>&#181;</TT>g/m3 in Metropolitan Riverside County) was 105%
of the state standard. The annual maximum for 1994 (26.8<TT> &#181;</TT>g/m3)
was 107% of the standard.
<P>
<B>LEAD</B> - The state and federal lead standards were not exceeded.
The maximum monthly average concentration at the regular air monitoring
stations during January - May 1995 (0.06 <TT>&#181;</TT>g/m3,
in Central Orange County) was 4% of the state standard. The special
monitoring stations immediately adjacent to sources recorded a
maximum (0.60 <TT>&#181;</TT>g/m3) which was 40% of the standard.

<P>
<IMG SRC="/icon/line4.gif"></CENTER> 

<P>
In 1994, the South Coast Air Basin (Basin) exceeded stateand federal ambient air quality standards for ozone, PM10 (particulate matter), and carbon monoxide in some or all areas. The state sulfate standard was exceeded in some Basin areas. The state lead standard was exceeded in one localized area immediately adjacent to a source.  No areas of the Basin exceeded standards for nitrogen dioxide or sulfur dioxide.
<P>
The Los Angeles and Riverside County areas of the Southeast Desert Air Basin (SEDAB) served by the District exceeded standards for ozone and PM10. No other standards were exceeded in the District SEDAB areas.
<P>
The maximum concentrations and the number of exceedances in all areas of the District are given in the following tables:

<a name = "rplan"><h3><B>Revised Plan Assures Cleaner Air</b></h3>
<P>An updated clean air plan adopted in November by the Governing Board keeps the Southland firmly on the road to healthful air quality.
<P>Stage I ozone episodes and carbon monoxide exceedances will be a thing of the past after 1999.  The present standards for fine particulate will be met in 2006 and for ozone in 2010.
<P>In Riverside -- where fine particle pollution obscures vistas most -- the average range of visibility will increase from about six miles today to more than eight miles in 2006 and 10 miles in 2010.
<P>The 1997 Air Quality Management Plan was approved unanimously by the Governing Board after a public hearing.
<P>&quot;We're making good progress toward clean air while being careful about the impacts of our decisions on jobs and the economy,&quot; said Jon D. Mikels, Governing Board Chairman.
<P>&quot;Our air is more healthful than ever because our program is scientifically sound and working as expected.  But we need to keep up our effort, particularly in light of tighter health standards that are on the way.&quot;
<P>Adoption of the revised plan came at the close of the cleanest Southland smog season on record, the fifth year in a row marked by substantial improvement in air quality.  The number of Stage I episode days was cut in half -- from 14 last year to seven this year.
<P>The plan includes 68 pollution control measures to put in place between now and 2010 to assure continued progress toward clean air.  Twenty-nine measures from the 1994 version of the plan that would bring just minimal emission reductions and reduce driving to shopping centers and other facilities were dropped.
<P>This reduces the overall cost of future pollution control requirements by some $3.7 billion a year, from $5.4 billion anticipated in the 1994 plan to just $1.7 billion.  Annual average benefits are estimated to be at least $4.5 billion.
<P>AQMD's revised plan is designed to meet the current standards for fine particle pollution by 2006 and ozone by 2010.  However, the federal EPA has proposed new standards for fine particles and ozone next year in light of medical evidence the current standards do not fully protect health.
<P>&quot;If EPA adopts the new standards in June, we'll need to revisit our plan&quot; Mikels said.  &quot;Meanwhile, we'll continue our progress toward healthful air.&quot;
<P>For example, the current ozone standard of .12 parts per million was exceeded on 87 days this year, almost half as many as ten years ago.  Only seven Stage I episode days -- when ozone exceeds .20 ppm -- were recorded this year compared to 79 in 1986 and 121 in 1977.
<P>&quot;The region's progress on air quality proves that our pollution control programs are working,&quot; said James M. Lents, executive officer.  &quot;It also shows the region must continue to follow through on its drive to clean air.

<P>Special studies costing $1.4 million were carried out to update the data base for the particulate portion of the plan, which also incorporates improved meteorological data and updated forecasts of population, vehicle use and economic activity.
<P>By 2010, the plan will reduce daily emissions of volatile organic compounds from 1,240 tons to 413 tons and nitrogen oxides from 1,194 tons to 530 tons.
<P>The plan outlines measures to control emissions from motor vehicles, households, industries and businesses, and offroad vehicles and equipment used in shipping and construction.  It also highlights programs to commercialize new technologies, such as fuel cells, biofilters and zero-polluting paints and industrial materials.

<P><a name = "epa"><h3><B>EPA Proposes New Health Standards for Fine Particulate, Ozone Pollution</B></h3>
<P>New health standards for air pollution based on recent medical evidence were proposed by the federal EPA on Nov. 27 under a federal court order won by the American Lung Association.
<P>A review of the latest epidemiological studies by EPA showed that the current standards for ozone and fine particulate may not prevent some significant health effects.  The federal Clean Air Act requires EPA to periodically review and revise the national ambient air quality standards to ensure that in light of the latest scientific knowledge they fully protect human health without consideration of cost.
<P>EPA proposed to revise the standard for ozone from .12 parts per million averaged over one hour to .08 ppm averaged over eight hours.  An area would be allowed to exceed the standard to the extent that the average of its third highest annual reading at any monitoring station over three years was no greater than .08 ppm.
<P>EPA also proposed new standards for particulate matter that is 2.5 microns in diameter (PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>) or smaller.  They are 15 micrograms per cubic meter averaged annually and 50 micrograms per cubic meter averaged over 24 hours.  To determine if an area meets the annual and 24-hour standards, EPA respectively would use a spatial average and a three-year average of the 98th percentile reading.  EPA said it planned to retain the annual average standard for PM<SUB>10</SUB>, but is considering removing the 24-hour standard.
<P>Public comments will be taken on the proposal for 60 days.  Final standards are due by June 28 under the court order.
<P>A preliminary AQMD analysis shows that after fully carrying out the 1997 Air Quality Management Plan the region would exceed the proposed ozone standard by 25% and the annual average limit for PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> by some 35%.  Meeting these tighter standards likely will require additional time beyond the deadlines for meeting current standards.
<P>AQMD plans to send technical comments on the proposal to EPA and to work with the federal agency on its implementation policy.

<P><a name = "permits"><h3><B>AQMD Eliminates Permits for 10,000 Sources</B></h3>
<P>Eliminating 10,000 air pollution control permits and saving businesses some $1.5 million a year, the Governing Board voted in November to exempt a variety of equipment from AQMD permit requirements.
<P>The exemption helps implement one element of AQMD's 1996 Regulatory Reform Initiative, namely, to eliminate or streamline permits for small businesses.  That initiative outlined a number of steps to ease the regulatory burden on the region's businesses.
<P>&quot;We're achieving our air quality goals, but are also committed to minimizing paperwork and other requirements that don't really contribute to air pollution control,&quot; said Jon D. Mikels, AQMD chairman.
<P>&quot;We'll continue to move forward in a balanced manner toward both clean air and regulatory reform in the year ahead.&quot;
<P><B>Agency goal is to reduce fees</B>
<P>The exemptions were made in amendments to AQMD's Rule 219, which lists equipment that does not require an air pollution control permit.
<P>Now exempt from permit requirements are freon recycling equipment, small portable internal combustion engines, small paint spray booths, fuel oil storage tanks, powder coating ovens and other equipment that produces minimal pollution or is regulated by another agency.
<P>The small portable internal combustion engines exempted from AQMD permit requirements will be covered under a statewide registration program.  The federal EPA regulates freon recycling.
<P>Future reforms will expand a registration process for small equipment.  The registration will provide simple guidelines to help ensure air pollution is minimized.
<P>Next, AQMD plans to expand the registration concept for individual pieces of equipment to cover small businesses as a whole, including all their equipment.  A simplified facility-based registration will be developed for several industries, including auto body shops and dry cleaners.
<P>The goal of both registration programs is to ease permitting and compliance requirements and reduce fees for businesses.

<P><a name = "paint"><h3><B>Rules Seek Cleaner Paint, Voluntary Ridesharing</B></h3>
<P><A NAME="I2"></A>The Governing Board has adopted a measure that will significantly reduce smog-forming ingredients in house paints and other architectural coatings.
<P>In addition, the Board exempted employers with fewer than 250 employees from its rule requiring them to reduce motor vehicle emissions.
<P><B>Cleaner house paints</B>
<P>To clean up paints, the Board voted in November to amend the agency's Rule 1113 to reduce volatile organic compound emissions by 10.3 tons per day.
<P>Most of the reduction would result from a requirement that flat house paints contain 60% fewer VOCs by 2001, and no more than 50 grams per liter of VOCs by 2008.  The latter will effectively require that flat paints be zero-VOC by 2008.
<P>&quot;Low- or zero-polluting water-based paints are already available from a growing number of manufacturers and many of us use them now in our homes,&quot; said James M. Lents, executive officer.
<P>&quot;By requiring all paints to meet this standard, we can speed their introduction throughout Southern California and ensure continued progress toward healthful air.&quot;
<P>The rule also will require reductions in the VOC content of lacquers, highway and road marking paints and specialty multi-color coatings.
<P><B>Voluntary ridesharing approved</B>
<P>The Board also voted to change AQMD's Rule 2202 to comply with a state law which took effect Jan. 1 to exempt 2,730 Southland work sites with up to 249 employees from motor vehicle emissions reduction requirements.
<P>The new year launches an 18-month effort to see if voluntary carpooling can achieve equivalent emission reductions.  Regional ridesharing agencies and AQMD will put into place an active voluntary rideshare program.
<P>Until now, Rule 2202 has required some 4,300 area employers of 100 or more employees at a worksite to reduce vehicle emissions through rideshare strategies, old vehicle scrapping or other programs.
<P>The new state law -- based on SB 836 sponsored by state Sen. John Lewis (R-Orange) -- calls for eventual phase out of the mandatory measure if the voluntary approach to ridesharing is as successful in reducing pollution.

<P><a name = "web"><h3><B>Permit Applications Available on AQMD's Internet Home Page</B></h3>
<P>To save businesses time and money, AQMD has made a variety of permit applications available on its World Wide Web site, as called for in the Governing Board's 1996 Regulatory Reform Initiative.  <I>(The address is <a href = "/warp-main/">http://www/aqmd.gov/warp-main/</a>.)</I>

<P>For specific equipment -- fuel storage and dispensing facilities, emergency standby engines, boilers and negative air machines -- permits can be filed online, although a check and transmittal sheet still must be mailed in.
<P>In this online filing system, known as WARP (Web Actuated Request for Permits) applicants can access permit applications and fill them out on their computers with help screens provided at every level.  Applicable fees are calculated and a transaction number for each application is assigned automatically.
<P>Applicants will receive e-mail verification that AQMD has received their completed applications and payment.
<P>The system will be expanded in the future to cover a greater variety of facilities with total emissions less than four tons per year that are not covered by the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market program.

<P><a name = "cool"><h3><B>AQMD Kicks Off Cool Communities Program</B></h3>
<P>Since the 1930s, when pavement started swallowing up orange groves and oak trees in Los Angeles, average temperatures have increased more than 5 degrees.
<P>Scientists have documented the phenomenon, known as the urban heat island effect, in cities across the United States.  During clear summer afternoons, cities are typically 5 degrees hotter than surrounding rural areas due to the lack of shade trees and vegetation, which naturally cool the landscape, and the prevalence of dark-colored roads, buildings and roofs, which absorb heat.
<P>The urban heat island effect contributes to air pollution in two ways.  Since ozone formation is driven by light and heat, higher temperatures generally result in higher levels of ozone.  Secondly, hot days increase the need for air conditioning and the demand for electricity.  Power plants can meet the higher demand by burning more fossil fuel, which causes more air pollution.
<P>To combat the heat island effect and reduce ozone formation, AQMD has adopted the Cool Communities program as part of the agency's 1997 Air Quality Management Plan.  The program would include voluntary measures to encourage the use of lighter colored roofing and paving materials, and increase the planting of trees.
<P>AQMD's Governing Board has approved an air quality modeling study to determine exactly how much ozone levels could be reduced by such measures.  If the study shows promise, it could be used to design a pilot Cool Communities program in areas with high ozone levels.

<P><a name = "ozone"><h3><B>AQMD Helps Investigate New Ozone-Eating Catalyst</B></h3>
<P><A NAME="I3"></A>Southland air quality officials are helping to test a chemical catalyst applied to home air conditioners to see if it can reduce outdoor ozone levels.
<P>If successful, the new technology could help reduce ozone levels where they are highest, typically in the Southland's inland valleys.
<P>&quot;We are going to need new clean-air technologies to achieve federal health standards for ozone in the next decade,&quot; said James M. Lents, AQMD's executive officer.
<P>&quot;We want to find out whether the ozone-eating catalyst could be an effective tool in cleaning up smog.&quot;
<P>The catalyst, developed by Engelhard Corp. of Iselin, N.J., breaks down harmful ground-level ozone into harmless oxygen molecules.
<P>Two air conditioners coated with the catalyst will be installed at two homes in Glendora.  AQMD will monitor outdoor air quality at the homes during this year's ozone season to determine whether the catalyst reduces pollution levels.
<P>The ozone-eating catalyst, a thick liquid that dries to a paint-like finish, is applied to an air conditioner's outdoor condenser coils.  As polluted outdoor air is drawn to cool the coils, the catalyst breaks down ozone.  The catalyst does not come into contact with or affect indoor air.
<P>Engelhard tested the ozone catalyst on car radiators last year, and found the catalyst converted 80% of ozone drawn through the radiators.
<P>Home air conditioners may be an even more effective use of the catalyst since they are operated many hours a day during the hottest, and hence smoggiest, times of the year.
<P>AQMD's Governing Board also has approved an air quality modeling study to determine the effectiveness of air conditioner catalysts on ozone levels.

<P><h3><B>&quot;50 Years of Progress Toward Clean Air&quot;</B></h3>
<P>Fifty years ago, the Los Angeles region became galvanized with a unity of purpose rivaled only by World War II and the 1984 Olympics.  The reason: To launch a unified, coordinated and multi-jurisdictional war on smog.
<P>Anti-pollution efforts actually began as early as 1905, when the City of Los Angeles adopted its first ordinance &quot;to prohibit dense smoke from stationary flues, chimneys and smokestacks.&quot;  
<P>But it was the industrial growth here during World War II that triggered public alarm about air pollution.  On Sept. 8, 1943, a<I> Los Angeles Times</I> headline described a &quot;daylight dim-out&quot; and a month later the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors established a county smoke and fumes commission.  
<P>A year later, both the city and county adopted separate air pollution ordinances, and in 1945 the city modified its ordinance to match the county&#146;s to create a uniform regulation.  But a problem remained:  The regulation applied only to the city and unincorporated county territory, leaving the county&#146;s other 45 municipalities unregulated.
<P>A citizens advisory committee organized and began negotiations among the cities and the county.  This culminated, on April 15, 1947, with the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approving draft legislation to address air pollution problem countywide.  Despite intense opposition, Assembly Bill 1 was approved by the legislators with only one dissenting vote and on June 10, 1947, Governor Earl Warren signed it into law, authorizing California counties to create countywide Air Pollution Control Districts.  On Oct. 14, 1947, the LA County Board of Supervisors activated California&#146;s first APCD, and others soon followed, including Orange County in 1950, Riverside County in 1955 and San Bernardino County in 1956.  In 1976, the Legislature merged all or portions of these four APCDs into the South Coast Air Quality Management District, effective Jan. 1, 1977.
<P>Clearly, 1947 marks the time when our region became organized with unparalleled unity of purpose to fight smog and launched the pioneering air pollution control effort that became a model for the nation.  
<P>To commemorate this anniversary and our region's 50 years of progress toward clean air, South Coast Air Quality Management District along with other organizations will host a series of activities during 1997.   Watch for updates in upcoming <I>Advisors</I>.

<P><a name = "ctech"><h3><B>Clean Technology Center Under Construction</B></h3>
<P>AQMD is developing a Clean Technology Center at its Diamond Bar headquarters to showcase products that surpass Southland air pollution control standards.
<P>The 3,300-square-foot exhibit hall, located on the ground floor of the agency's south building, is expected to open early this year.
<P>AQMD hopes to initially attract 30 exhibitors displaying such products as electric lawn mowers, electric vehicle technology and clean consumer products.
<P>&quot;This center will give manufacturers the opportunity to publicize and market their clean technologies to AQMD visitors, including government and industry decision-makers, the general public and more than 60 delegations a year from other states and nations,&quot; said La Ronda Bowen, AQMD's Public Advisor.
<P>Center display themes will include:  pollution prevention technologies, recycled materials, history of air pollution, economic development and business retention, AQMD's equipment certification program, ultra-low emission vehicles and products for the home.
<P><I>For more details call (800) 388-2121 or visit <a href = "/tao/">http://www.aqmd.gov/tao/</a> on the Internet.</I>

<P><a name = "doing"><h3><B>Doing Business with AQMD</B></h3>
<P><I>Beginning with this issue Advisor will profile small and minority-owned businesses doing </I><I>business with AQMD.  Through their experiences others can learn how to go through the </I><I>agency's procurement process and supply services and materials to the agency.</I>
<P>Beverly King admits she was skeptical when she received the flier about AQMD's Vendor Information Conference.
<P>&quot;An associate from the Black Business Association faxed the information to me,&quot; said King, president and chief executive officer of King &amp; Wright Consulting, Inc.  &quot;Initially I had reservations about going, but I then heard that the AQMD was reaching out to do business with minority-owned firms.  I just had a feeling I should go,&quot; she said.
<P>During the half-day conference King learned all about the types of equipment and services the agency procures, its contracting and procurement process, and how to access AQMD's procurement information through the Internet <I>(<A HREF = "/rfp/">http://www.aqmd.gov/rfp/</a>).</I>
<P>&quot;I was very impressed by what I heard and saw,&quot; said King.  &quot;The quality and quantity of information provided was invaluable.  But I still couldn't believe that an agency such as the AQMD was making itself so available to small and minority businesses.  I decided to challenge them.&quot;
<P>King gathered copies of all the requests for proposals she knew King &amp; Wright could respond to as a qualified bidder. She and her partner Linda Wright reviewed them, then decided to bid on a forms management proposal, working with AQMD's Information Management team.
<P>Three other companies also responded to the proposal but, after going through a rigorous interview and review process, King &amp; Wright won the contract.  
<P>&quot;The contract just arrived in the mail,&quot; said Wright, vice president and chief financial officer of the firm.  &quot;We took one look at it, then called to verify that we had been selected for the job.  It was a pleasant surprise.&quot;
<P>The two principals formed King &amp; Wright Consulting, Inc. in 1989.  The firm initially specialized in the design, development and implementation of diversity programs, but it has broadened its spectrum to provide technical support, training, management advisory, and community outreach services for public and private entities.  Their client list includes Turner Construction Co., the City of Los Angeles, Kaiser Permanente, and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
<P>Despite their success both King and Wright acknowledge that as a small, minority-owned firm the hardest aspect of the job is &quot;getting in the door.&quot;  But with its vendor conference AQMD rolled out the red carpet and met King's challenge.  
<P>&quot;Now that we have our foot in the door,&quot; said Wright, &quot;we are looking forward to a long, productive relationship with the AQMD.&quot;

<B><A NAME="About">About AQMD</A><BR>
</B>The South Coast Air Quality Management District is a four-county
regional government agency responsible for ensuring healthful
air quality throughout the South Coast Air Basin through the regulation
of mobile and stationary source emissions. You can help us achieve
our clean air goals for this region by calling 1-800-CUT-SMOG
to report your observations of excessive dust, odors, smoke, or
other air contaminants to the AQMD. This webpage describes how
the AQMD evaluates, responds to, and resolves your air quality
complaints.
<P>
<B><A NAME="What">What is </A>an air quality complaint?<BR>
</B>An air quality complaint is any injury, detriment, nuisance,
or annoyance occurring as a result of air contaminants or other
materials, including (but not limited to) smoke, dust, or odors<B>.</B>

<P>
<B><A NAME="How">How</A> do I report an air quality complaint
to AQMD?<BR>
</B>Call 1-800-CUT-SMOG.
<P>
<B><A NAME="What_happens">What happens </A>when I report a smoking
vehicle?<BR>
</B>When you call 1-800-CUT-SMOG to report a <A HREF="/smog/cutsmog.html">smoking vehicle</A>,
you will be asked to provide the following information:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>License plate number of smoking vehicle;
<LI>Vehicle model or type; and
<LI>When (date and time) and where (city and cross streets) smoking
vehicle was observed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
AQMD checks this information against California Department of
Motor Vehicles records to determine the name and mailing address
of the vehicle's registered owner. The owner is then sent an advisory
letter which describes when and where the vehicle was seen smoking,
and which recommends vehicle maintenance or repair to help &quot;cut
smog.&quot; The letter also asks the registered owner to return
a postage-paid form telling AQMD what has been done to reduce
visible emissions from the vehicle.
<P>
<B>What happens<A NAME="when_I"> when I </A>report other air quality
complaints?<BR>
</B>When you call 1-800-CUT-SMOG to report an air quality complaint
about a stationary source (like a factory or business), you will
be asked to provide the following information:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The time the air quality incident occurred and whether it is continuing
at the time of your call;
<LI>The nature of the air quality complaint (<A HREF="/rules/html/r401.html">smoke</A>, <A HREF="/rules/html/r403.html">dust</A>, <A HREF="/rules/html/r402.html">odor</A>, or
other).
<LI>Whether you have experienced this type of air quality problem
in the past.
<LI>The wind direction, if known.
<LI>The name and address of the alleged source and the type of operation,
if known.
</UL>


<P>This information is forwarded to an AQMD Inspector for follow-up
and resolution.
<P>
Complaints received after normal business hours or during the
weekend are usually dispatched to an AQMD Inspector for follow-up
the next business day, unless the air quality incident appears
to pose a particularly serious threat to the health or safety
of a considerable number of persons. Complaints which allege such
a <A HREF="/rules/html/r402.html">public nuisance</A> are usually dispatched to an Inspector
for prompt follow-up after they are received by AQMD.
<P>
<B><A NAME="Do">Do</A> I have to identify myself when I call AQMD
to report an air quality complaint?<BR>
</B>Although it's never required for complaints against mobile
sources, AQMD always encourages people who call to report stationary
source complaints to provide their name, address, and telephone
number. This information helps AQMD Inspectors verify complaint
information, including any prior history of air quality problems
involving the alleged source, and also allows them to inform complainants
of the status of complaint investigation activities. Because <B>AQMD
policy strictly prohibits the release of any information that
would identify a complainant to an alleged source or to any other
non-AQMD personnel without your consent,</B> all information about
you and your complaint will be kept confidential by AQMD staff.
<P>
<B>How are air <A NAME="quality">quality</A> complaints resolved?
<BR>
</B>Some air quality problems -- particularly odors which last
for a brief period of time -- dissipate so rapidly that they are
very difficult to verify. When complaints like these are reported
(especially by drive-by or anonymous complainants, and particularly
after hours) there may be no further action other than a follow-up
call from an AQMD Inspector.
<P>
In contrast, if a <A HREF = "/rules/html/r402.html">public nuisance</A> is suspected, an immediate
investigation of the alleged source may be necessary.
<P>
Whenever possible, an AQMD Inspector contacts complainants by
telephone to determine the cause of the complaint and the nature
and source of the alleged air quality problem, and to attempt
to resolve the complaint, if possible. At this time, the Inspector
obtains or verifies the following information:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The name and location of the alleged source, if known;
<LI>The frequency of annoyance or occurrence of the smoke, dust, or
odor giving rise to the complaint;
<LI>The time of day the air quality problem was first noticed;
<LI>The duration of the air quality problem at each occurrence;
<LI>The wind speed and velocity, if known;
<LI>The names and addresses of other persons affected, if available;
<LI>The location and extent of property damage, if any;
<LI>A description and frequency of any illness alleged to have resulted
from the air contaminants;
<LI>A description of odors, if any; and
<LI>Any other information the complainant may have that will relate
the air quality problem to a specific source, operation, or piece
of equipment.
</UL>

<P>
While many complaints can be resolved over the telephone and require
no additional follow-up, others require additional investigation.
If a complaint cannot be immediately resolved by phone, the Inspector
locates and verifies the alleged source by surveying and canvassing
the suspected area. On verifying the source, the Inspector conducts
a facility inspection to verify the complaint and determine the
cause of the air quality problem.
<P>
The Inspector documents the findings of the facility inspection,
issuing <A HREF="ntcmply.html">Notices to Comply</A>/<a HREF="nov.html">Notices of Violation</A> as necessary in
response to observed violations of applicable sections of the
California Health and Safety Code, AQMD Rules and Regulations,
and/or AQMD permit conditions.
<P>
After the investigation, the Inspector may contact the complainant
to discuss findings and resolve the complaint. Should the air
quality problem persist or occur at another time, the complainant
is advised to call 1-800-CUT-SMOG to report additional instances
as they happen.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B><br><H1></FONT><center></B>1997 Air Quality Management Plan</H1></center></B></FONT><br><br>
<P>The South Coast Air Quality Management District Governing Board approved the
this 1997 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) at a public hearing on November 15, 1996.
The AQMD had solicited feedback and input from all members of the
greater South Coast community on this revision to the region's
clean air plan. To further encourage comment, the Governing Board 
hosted a number of regional workshops throughout the Basin, as well
as at District headquarters in Diamond Bar.
</P>

<P>This AQMP puts greater focus on a pollutant found to be newly important
in the South Coast region: fine particulate matter (PM<FONT SIZE=2.5>10</FONT>). Recent
findings by nationally recognized health experts show that PM<FONT SIZE=2.5>10 </FONT>may
be responsible for significant adverse health effects for Southern Californians,
including premature death and disabling respiratory impairments. This 
1997 AQMP represents the first plan addressing Clean Air Act requirements
to demonstrate attainment of federal PM<FONT SIZE=2.5>10</FONT> ambient air quality
standards. </P>

<P>A comprehensive Plan such as this is built on the contributions of many.
In addition to those individuals and groups, the advisory support of the
PM<FONT SIZE=2.5>10 </FONT>Task Force is acknowledged as a vital component in this
Plan's strategy development effort. This Task Force first met in June 1995
as a gathering of agency, government, industry, academia, and organizational
representatives. Over many months, participants held critical discussions
and reviewed findings of the latest technical and scientific studies available
on particulate pollution. Their efforts are reflected in the completeness
of the attainment strategies presented here. </P>

<P>This Plan also reflects the combined technical and policy inputs
of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the state Air Resources
Board (ARB), and the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG).
</P>

<P>Air quality monitoring records of recent years have proven the effectiveness
of our Basin's ongoing pollution control efforts. The collaborative spirit
that was present as this Plan has been in development will help us
achieve the proper balance of our need for clean air with our need for
a strong economy, and assure that residents and visitors alike will breathe
healthful air by the year 2010. </P>


<P>
The Plan has an Executive Summary,  10 chapters,  and a Glossary.   To download or view sections of the Plan in Microsoft Word 6.0,  click on the appropriate icon below or view the section in html version.</P>

<H2><CENTER>COACHELLA VALLEY    PM   <SUB>10</SUB>
<BR>ATTAINMENT REDESIGNATION REQUEST
<BR>AND MAINTENANCE PLAN </H2></CENTER><br><B>RELEASED SEPTEMBER 9, 1996</CENTER></B></A>
<H3><A ID="I3" NAME="I3"><B>SUMMARY OF COACHELLA VALLEY PM</B><B><SUB>10</SUB>  PLAN</B></A></H3>
<P>The Coachella Valley is currently designated as a serious nonattainment area for PM<SUB>10</SUB> (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less).  Under the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), an area can be redesignated as attainment if, among other requirements, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) determines that the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) have been attained.  U.S. EPA guidance further states that a determination of compliance with the NAAQS must be based on three complete, consecutive calendar years of quality-assured air quality monitoring data.  In applying U.S. EPA's recently approved Natural Events Policy (NEP), the Coachella Valley has not violated either the 24-hour or annual average PM<SUB>10</SUB> standards during the last three calendar years (1993 through 1995).  Accordingly, the purpose of this plan is to request a redesignation of the Coachella Valley to attainment for PM<SUB>10</SUB> and to submit the attendant maintenance plan and other required actions to qualify for such redesignation by the U.S. EPA.  </P>
<a href = "#download"><h3>Chapters</h3></a>
<p><b>Chapter 1</b>  of the plan describes the purpose of the plan, the regulatory background, PM<SUB>10</SUB> health effects, the Coachella Valley area, and provides a summary of previous PM<SUB>10</SUB> reduction efforts.
<p><b>Chapter 2</b>  includes a description of air quality in the Coachella Valley, a case-study of a high-wind natural event, and the Valley's attainment with the federal PM<SUB>10</SUB> NAAQS.
<p><b>Chapter 3</b>  provides a summary of the methodology for estimating PM<SUB>10</SUB> emissions and includes future year emissions estimates.
<p><b>Chapter 4</b> contains the maintenance plan, which consists of a maintenance demonstration, a description of future air quality monitoring and verification of future compliance with federal NAAQS, and a contingency plan to be implemented if the area does experience a future violation.
<p><b>Chapter 5</b> is the redesignation request and references how each of the U.S. EPA's redesignation criteria are met.
<p><b>Chapter 6</b> is the Natural Events Action Plan, as required by the U.S. EPA NEP and is intended to protect public health as a result of future high-wind natural events.
<p><b>Chapter 7</b>  is a summary checklist that references the portions of the document intended to satisfy CAA and U.S. EPA requirements.

<h3><a name = "what">What are Autobody Shops?</h3>
<P>Autobody shops are businesses that do repair work, or perform customization, to automobile bodies.  The services available from these shops range from repainting an aging finish and repairing accident damage to modifying the shape of the body for custom applications.  
<P>There are three major steps in this process: repair or modification, surface preparation, and surface finishing.  Repairs can be as simple as removing a dent using various filling materials and smoothing techniques.  Complex repairs may call for the entire cars to be strapped into mechanical devices that pull them back into alignment and may require portions of the vehicle to be cut away with torches and replaced with either new or used parts.  
<P>Once the automobile has been &quot;straightened out,&quot; then the surface will be ground and sanded smooth.  Solvents may be used to clean and/or reactivate previous finishes to prepare them for a new paint job.  Once the surface has been prepared, and any areas not being painted are covered up, the new finish can be applied.  A spray gun is used for painting.  The gun has a reservoir for holding the paint and a source of pressure, such as compressed air, is used as a propellant.  
<P>The painting is usually done in a special room called a paint booth.  This booth has a large fan that pulls outside air in through filters and back out through another set of filters.  This arrangement of filters keeps most dust from settling on the wet paint and also prevents paint particles from blowing out into the air.  Special lamps and additional fans can be used to help dry the finish.  After the paint is dry, polishing and waxing compounds are applied to add luster and protection.  
<P>The AQMD is interested in autobody shops because the solvent and paints used have the potential to contribute to our region&#146;s severe smog problem.
<p>
<h3><a name = "rules">What Are the Rules and Regulations?</h3>
<P>Here are several key <a href = "/rules/rulesreg.html"><U>air quality rules and regulations</U></a> that apply to autobody shops.
If you operate an autobody shop you are expected to understand all applicable AQMD rules and regulations.
<P><ul><li><a href = "/rules/html/r201.html">Rule 201</a> and  <a href = "/rules/html/r203.html"> Rule 203</a> cover permit requirements.   A permit is required (unless equipment is exmpted by Rule 219) whenever you: install new equipment, alter existing equipment, change the ownership of equipment, move equipment to a new facility, change the location or the operating conditions.
<P><li><a href = "/rules/html/r219.html"><U>Rule 219</U></a>  includes exemptions for minimal use of paint sprayed outside of spray booths.    Section (l)(15) allows up to one gallon of solvent-based and three gallons of water-based coatings to be sprayed per day outside of a spray booth without an open-air spray permit.  (This assumes that you don&#146;t get overspray on your neighbors property and that your local city or fire department allows outdoor spraying).  If you have a spray booth and also spray outside of the booth, then it would benefit you to keep separate records.  Depending on how your permits are written, the daily limits on any painting that you do in your booth may or may not include the above limits for outside spraying.
<P><li><a href = "/rules/html/r1151.html"> <U>Rule 1151 - Motor Vehicle and Mobile Equipment Non-Assembly Line Coating  Operations.</U></a>  This rule controls how much Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are allowed to be in the paints (as they are applied).  It also covers the type of spray equipment to be used, such as High Volume Low Pressure (HVLP) spray guns.  Administrative requirements, such as recordkeeping ,are referred to in <a href = "/rules/html/r109.html">Rule 109</a>.  Recordkeeping forms are available from the AQMD or through your paint suppliers.
<P><li><a href = "/rules/html/r1171.html"><U>Rule 1171 - Solvent Cleaning Operations</U></a>  This rule covers any use of VOC containing solvents for cleaning.
<P><li><a href = "/rules/html/r1411.html"><U>Rule 1411 - Recovery or Recycling of Refrigerants from Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners.</U></a>  Some autobody shops repair or service air conditioners.  If you do this type of work, with certain refrigerants, you may need a permit for the recycling/recovery machine.  Also, anyone who operates the machine must be certified by the AQMD or by an EPA certified school.</ul>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>
<h4><a name = "inspect">What Does an AQMD Inspector Look For?</h4>
<P>Periodically, an AQMD inspector will visit a autobody shop to make sure that it is complying with these rules.  The job of the inspector is to educate, assist and ultimately help bring the operation into compliance.  Here is a typical inspection routine:
<P>
<b><li>Permits</b>
<ul>
<li>Does all equipment, requiring AQMD permits, have permits?
<li> Is a permit, or a copy of a permit, posted near the equipment?
<li> Is the information on the permit complete, up-to-date, and accurate?
<li>Do the model numbers on the equipment match the model numbers on the permit?
<li> Is all the equipment being used listed on the permit?
<li> Is the equipment being operated according to the permit conditions?
</ul><p>
<b><li>Records</b><ul>
<li>Are proper records being kept (including the make, manufacturer, product number and mixing ratios) of all coatings used, along with any ingredients (such as hardeners, activators, reducers and thinners) that may be added to them?

<li> Is the VOC content of all these ingredients recorded?
<li>Are the amounts of those ingredients used on a daily basis recorded?
<li> Are the total daily VOC emissions calculated and entered?
<li>Is all other data required by permit conditons listed?
<li>Are these records readily available?
</ul><P>
<b><li>Housekeeping</b>
<ul>
<li>Are cleaning solvent containers kept closed?
<li>Are the spray booth filters in good condition and properly fitted?
<li> Are gun cleaning tanks kept closed?.</ul>
<P><a href = "fincheck.doc"><B><I>(Download a self-inspection checklist)</I></B></a>
<h4><a name = "wrong">What If the Inspector Finds Something Wrong?</h4>
<P>For minor or administrative errors not involving actual emissions, a Notice to Comply (a type of &quot;fix-it-ticket&quot;) is usually issued.  The inspector will explain what needs to be done to correct the situation and will prescribe a specific amount of time (usually a week or two) for the business to come into compliance.  
<P>If the situation goes unresolved or there is a violation that involves emissions, a <a href = "/comply/nov.html"><U>Notice of  Violation</U></a> may be issued.  This is a more serious matter that is referred to the AQMD legal department for either a civil or criminal court action or resolution through a mutual settlement program.
<h3><a name = "resources">Are There Additional Resources for Autobody Shops?</h3>
<P>The AQMD offers classes to help you comply with our rules and regulations.  <a href = "baser.html#cc"><U>Compliance Course Information</U></a> classes are held periodically at AQMD Headquarters, as well as other locations, and include many different industries.  We also offer a free <a href = "basb.html#tcs"><U>Technical  Consultation Service</U></a>.  We can, either over the telephone or at your operation site, assist you with permit applications.  
<P>If you are planning to purchase new equipment that requires an air pollution permit, you may be eligible to participate in our <a href = "basb.html#aq"><U>Air Quality Assistance Fund</U></a> (AQAF).  This loan guaranty program is intended to help you reduce the costs of complying with our rules and regulations.

<h3><A NAME="navigating">Navigating</A></h3><p>
<dl>
<li><b>I'm logged in. What do I do now?</b><p>
  There are 3 actions a user can take with regards to an application. Start a 
  new application, resume a previously saved application, or track the status 
  of an application. Before you entered your login name, you selected one of 
  these actions.<p>
  <blockquote>

  <b>Filling Out a New Application</b><p>
  You will be presented with a series of forms to fill out. These forms will ask
  for information about the following topics:<p>
  
  <UL>
  <LI>Facility
  <LI>Equipment 
  <LI>Supplemental Form(s)
  </UL><p>
  
  Type in the appropriate information in each field. At the bottom of the 
  screen, you will see 2 buttons, Save Data and Clear.<p> 
 
  By clicking on Save Data, you will store all information typed so far on the
  current page. This allows you to come back to your application at a later 
  time and pick up where you left off. Click on Save Data when you have 
  completed the necessary fields for each page. Fields which require a numeric
  value will default to zero if left blank.<p>
 
  By clicking on Clear, you will erase all information typed so far on the 
  current page.<p>
 
  At the left of the screen, you will see folder tabs labeled with the sections
  of the current form. These tabs are used to navigate to other sections of the
  application. However, by clicking on a tab, you are not saving your data, you
  are simply jumping to the next section. If you have completed a page, click 
  on Save Data and you will automatically proceed to the next section.<p>
 
  Any underlined text represents a link to either the help text for a given 
  field, or supplemental forms/drawings you must complete.<p>
 
  When you have supplied all necessary information for the entire form, click 
  on the Submit button located on the 400A page with the tab labeled Submit.
  The fees due for your application will be calculated and you will be 
  presented with a form describing how to pay the fees. Print this form 
  (File | Print on most Web Browsers), sign it, and follow the instructions on
  mailing it. Once your application is submitted, you will no longer be able to
  make changes to it. <p>
 
  <b>Resuming a Saved Application</b><p>
 
  You will be asked to supply the application's transaction ID number. Type the
  number into the field and click on Continue. If the transaction ID is valid,
  you will be presented with the 400A form with the fields you previously 
  completed filled in. From this point, the application process is the same as 
  that for new applications. Complete the application and click on Submit.<p>
 
  <b>Tracking the Status of an Application</b><p>
 
  You will be asked to supply the application's transaction ID number. Type the
  number into the field and click on Track. If the transaction ID is valid, the
  current status of your application will be displayed. <p>
  
  </blockquote>

<li><b>I'm not sure what information to supply in a field.</b><p>
  There are help topics available for most fields. Click on the underlined 
  field name to receive help for that field.<p>

<li><b>I don't have the information for a certain field with me right now, 
what should I do?</b><p>
  You should click on the "Save Data" button at the bottom of the page you are 
  working on, and write down your transaction ID. When you obtain the 
  information, click on Resume Application from the WARP main menu, and enter 
  your transaction ID. Use the tabs to navigate to the place you left off.<p>

<h3><A NAME="supplemental">Supplemental Forms</A></h3><p>
<dl>
<li><b>What is a supplemental form?</b><p>

<B>RULE GETS WOOD PRODUCTS MAKERS HALF WAY TO GOAL IN ONE YEAR</B>
<P>
Wood product makers in the region will be more than half way
to their emissions-reduction goal within one year under compromise
amendments to Rule 1136 approved by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District governing board today. 
<P>
Between now and July 1, 1997, industry representatives agreed
to reduce daily emissions by five tons, more than industry emissions
have declined since 1988. In exchange, the AQMD agreed to give
the industry until 2005 to achieve their final reduction goal. 

<P>
The AQMD governing board, who approved the rule amendments
on a unanimous vote, hailed the compromise reached after lengthy
negotiations with industry representatives. 
<P>
&quot;This compromise is an excellent example of our new board's
efforts to strike a reasonable balance between our twin needs
for clean air and a strong economy,&quot; said James M. Lents,
AQMD executive officer. 
<P>
&quot;Our amendments will achieve substantial emissions reductions
in the short-term and provide additional time and increased flexibility
for our local businesses.&quot; 
<P>
AQMD worked closely with the industry in developing the amendments,
including five meetings with a wood product makers working group,
three with a group of wood coatings makers, a detailed survey
of the industry and two public workshops. 
<P>
Since 1988, volatile organic compound emissions from these
sources in our region went from 15 tons per day to 11 tons per
day. By July 1, 1997, the compromise amendments will cut those
remaining emissions by 45%, to six tons per day. In exchange,
manufacturers in the region won more time to meet the final goal
of two tons per day from July 1, 1996, to 2005. 
<P>
&quot;These manufacturers are important to our economy,&quot;
Lents said &quot;We found that many could not use less polluting
water-based coatings on their products now and still compete with
manufacturers outside the region not subject to similar requirements.&quot; 

<P>
EPA recently removed acetone from the list of photochemically
reactive compounds, which will allow coating makers to meet next
year's standards. 
<P>
The amendments also will: 
<P><UL>
<LI>Provide several additional choices for companies to comply
with the limits; 
<P>
<LI>Increase flexibility when it comes to averaging emissions
for compliance purposes; and 
<P>
<LI>Maintain exemptions for classic guitars, refinishing, touch-up
and repair, and replacement and custom replica furniture. 
</UL>
<P>
AQMD is the air pollution control agency for Los Angeles,
Orange and parts of Riverside and San Bernardino counties.

<P><A ID="I4" NAME="I4"></A>Hot, stagnant weather this spring created more smog this year than the same time last year, air quality meteorologists said.</P>
<P>So far this year, the South Coast Air Quality Management District has issued 15 health advisories and two Stage 1 episodes.  At this time last year, only five health advisories and no Stage 1 episodes had occurred.  (See following chart)</P>
<P>&quot;We've had an unusual spring that resulted in some high smog levels,&quot; said James M. Lents, AQMD's executive officer.</P>
<P>&quot;If it weren't for our air pollution control program, we would have had several more days with very unhealthful air quality this spring.&quot;</P>
<P>A Stage 1 episode is called when ozone levels reach 0.20 parts per million or 200 pollutant standards index (PSI).  At this very unhealthful level, everyone should avoid vigorous outdoor activity.  Residents who are particularly sensitive to smog, including those with heart or lung disease, should stay indoors.</P>
<P>A health advisory is called when ozone levels reach 0.15 ppm or 138 PSI.  At this unhealthful level, healthy adults should avoid prolonged and vigorous outdoor exercise, and susceptible individuals should avoid outdoor activity.</P>
<P>The potential for unhealthful smog levels has been heightened this spring due to the lack of an El Nino weather pattern, which tends to bring cooler temperatures that inhibit smog formation, AQMD meteorologists said.</P>
<P>In addition, offshore sea temperatures have been at near-August levels, diminishing the marine layer, which also inhibits smog formation.</P>

<P>Two other factors that will affect this summer's smog season:</P>
<P>&#149;  Cleaner-burning gasoline will significantly reduce emissions and have a positive effect on air quality.</P>
<P>&#149;  An increase in the state's speed limit from 55 mph to 65 mph may also slightly increase smog-forming emissions.</P>
<P>&quot;These significant variables make this year a hard one to predict,&quot; Lents said.</P>
<P><B>Higher smog on weekends</B></P>
<P>Although smog levels have declined every year, air quality officials have noticed a trend toward ozone levels reaching their peak on weekends.</P>
<P>This spring's Stage 1 episodes followed that pattern, occurring on Saturday, May 11, when ozone levels reached 0.24 parts per million, and Sunday, May 12, when levels climbed to 0.21 ppm.</P>
<P>Smog levels may be higher on weekends than weekdays due to a complex mix of factors; AQMD officials plan further analysis of the trend later this year.</P>
<P><B>Still nation's smoggiest</B></P>
<P>Air quality in the metropolitan Los Angeles area has dramatically improved -- the number of days above the federal health standard for ozone decreased from 208 in 1977 to 98 last year.  However, the region still has by far the worst smog in the nation.</P>
<P>From 1992 to 1994, the Southland suffered an average of 103 days a year above the federal standard for ozone.  Houston, the next most polluted region outside California, had an average of 13 days, and New York City averaged four days.  (See following graph)</P>
<P>Ozone forms when volatile organic compounds -- including fumes from gasoline, paint, vehicle exhaust and chemicals -- combine in sunlight with nitrogen oxides, which are created when fuel is burned in vehicles, industries and households.</P>
<P>AQMD is the air pollution control agency for Los Angeles, Orange and portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.</P>

<P><A ID="I2" NAME="I2"></A><B>AQMD HOSTS CONFERENCE TO BOOST MINORITY CONTRACTING</B></P>
<P><A ID="I3" NAME="I3"></A>More than 275 minority business representatives attended a conference this week hosted by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to help them bid on agency procurement opportunities.</P>
<P>&quot;AQMD is making every effort to expand the amount of contracting we do with small businesses, women and minority-owned businesses, and disabled-veteran business enterprises,&quot; said Pomona City Council Member Nell Soto, who represents eastern cities in Los Angeles County on the AQMD Governing Board.  &quot;We urge these companies to join us and explore future opportunities.&quot;</P>
<P>Prospective vendors learned first hand about AQMD contracting and how to navigate the bidding and proposal process from agency staff who are directly responsible for soliciting contracts.</P>
<P> &quot;According to the AQMD's 1996-1997 budget, which begins July 1, approximately $11.4 million will be spent on procurement of supplies, services and equipment, &quot; said Soto.</P>
<P> In addition, the AB 2766 Discretionary Fund, which is administered by the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee, distributes $12 million annually to local governments, agencies and private-sector businesses that compete for project funding.  Requests for proposals outline areas such as alternative fuel technologies and infrastructure, research and development into advanced emission reduction technologies, public awareness and educational programs, and transportation control measures.  AQMD staff provide administrative and contract support for the program.</P>
<P>AQMD also established an Air Quality Investment Program in December 1995 which enables any company subject to motor vehicle emission reduction requirements to contribute $60 per employee per year or $125 per employee for a three-year period into an escrow account.</P>
<P>Investment program money is used to fund projects which reduce vehicle pollution.  Car scrapping and construction of a public access CNG station are examples of two recently funded proposals.  Proposals are solicited quarterly, with $2 million to be allocated during the second quarter of this year.</P>
<P>&quot;The AQMD has a strong desire to enhance its contracting and procurement record and has a great deal of Board support for this effort.  Toward that end, we wanted to host our own event so that staff in individual AQMD programs could discuss how to bid on upcoming professional and technical consulting service contracts and purchases of building, automotive and office supplies,&quot; said Joe Contaoi, AQMD's Director of Administrative Services and Human Resources.</P>
<P>&quot;These include contracts and purchases in Policy and Planning, Transportation, Stationary Source Compliance, Atmospheric Measurements, Organizational and Administrative Services.&quot;</P>
<P>Recent contract and procurement opportunities have included data management and specialty computer programming, source testing and laboratory services.</P>
<P>The conference also covered how businesses can track request for proposal solicitations using the Internet.  AQMD's web page address is http://www.aqmd.gov.</P>

<P><A ID="I3" NAME="I3"></A><B>AQMD 1996-97 BUDGET CUT $5 MILLION</B></P>
<P><A ID="I4" NAME="I4"></A>

<P> As the region's air becomes cleaner, the South Coast Air Quality Management District has again cut is budget.</P>
<P> AQMD's budget for fiscal year 1996-97 will decline by $5 million under a financial blue print approved by the governing board today.</P>
<P> Program costs will be cut from $100.8 million in the current fiscal year to $95.8 million, or by 4.9%.</P>
<P> Revenues will decline $4.2 million from $97.1 million to $92.9 million, or by 4.3%.  The difference between expenditures and projected revenues will be made up by spending down AQMD's reserve account.</P>
<P> &quot;This year's budget continues AQMD's commitment to cut its size in half over the next ten years,&quot; said Executive Officer James M. Lents.  &quot;Our spending is down more than 15% since its peak in 1991 and our staffing is down by 34%.&quot;</P>
<P> Salaries and benefits will be cut by $4.1 million, from $60.3 million to $56.2 million, or 6.8%.  This cut will be achieved by reducing the number of authorized staff positions from 796 to 764 and by not providing employees any cost of living increase.  In fiscal 1991-92, there were 1,163 authorized positions.</P>
<P> Expenditures on services and supplies will be cut by $1.4 million, or 3.5%.</P>
<P> While individual fees were raised 1.2%, consistent with the rise in the state consumer price index over the last year, total revenue from fees on businesses for emissions, permit renewals and transportation will decline from $50.6 million to $46.3 million, or by 4.3%.</P>
<P> &quot;We're seeing the results of declining emissions, which means cleaner air, and less of a need to regulate businesses due to cleaner technologies coming on line,&quot; Lents said.</P>
<P> Revenues from processing permit applications will increase from $8.2 million to $8.9 million, or by 8.5%, due to growing business activity in the region, Lents noted.</P>
<P> The lion's share of remaining AQMD revenue comes from $22.8 million in registration fees for motor vehicles, the number one source of air pollution, Lents said.</P>
<P> AQMD also will receive $6.2 million in grants and subventions from the federal and state governments and $6.7 million in miscellaneous fees, such as rents and subscriptions to AQMD publications.</P>
<P>	Before its approval today, the budget was the subject of several meetings with an outside advisory committee made up of businesses and environmentalists, three public workshops and two public hearings.</P><CENTER><P>-#-</P></CENTER>

<P><A ID="I3" NAME="I3"></A><B>AQMD PROPOSES INCENTIVE TO SCRAP OLD, POLLUTING LAWN MOWERS</B></P>

<P><A ID="I4" NAME="I4"></A>Homeowners could receive incentives to trade in old, highly polluting lawnmowers for zero-emission electric models under a voluntary program approved today by air quality officials.</P>
<P>The South Coast Air Quality Management District's Governing Board adopted Rule 1623, allowing businesses to earn emission reduction credits by voluntarily replacing high-emitting lawn and garden equipment with low- or zero-emitting models.</P>
<P>&quot;Some older lawn mowers are bigger polluters than the family car,&quot; said James M. Lents, AQMD's executive officer.  A dirty mower operated for 20 hours a year produces the same amount of smog-forming volatile organic compound pollution as a 1996 passenger car driven for 26,000 miles -- more than most people drive in a year, Lents said.</P>
<P>&quot;This program could help speed up the phase-out of old, dirty mowers and other polluting garden equipment,&quot; he said.</P>
<P>Businesses can earn emission reduction credits by offering rebates, discounts or other incentives for homeowners to trade in old lawnmowers, edgers, trimmers, leaf blowers, chainsaws or other power garden equipment.  Firms also can earn a smaller increment of credits simply by selling clean gardening equipment to consumers.</P>
<P>Businesses will earn credits if old equipment is replaced with new models meeting or exceeding the California Air Resources Board's current emission standards for lawn and garden equipment.  The cleaner the replacement model, the more credits will be earned; electric-powered equipment will earn the most.</P>
<P>The credits, issued in pounds per year for volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, will last from one to seven years, depending on the average expected life of the equipment being replaced.</P>
<P>Companies can purchase and use the credits to delay compliance with AQMD regulations; to meet emission reduction requirements under RECLAIM, the REgional CLean Air Incentives Market; or to offset emission increases at new or expanding facilities.</P>
<P>Companies must ensure that equipment to be scrapped has been operable before the program and that engines be rendered permanently inoperable after collection so they cannot be reused.</P>
<P>The concept of the garden equipment program is similar to AQMD's successful old car scrapping program, which has taken more than 7,000 highly polluting vehicles off the road since 1994.  Businesses also have expressed considerable interest in an AQMD regulation adopted last winter granting emission credits to firms replacing vehicles or utility equipment, such as forklifts, with clean-burning or electric-powered models.</P>
<P>Lawn and garden equipment constitutes a significant slice of the smog pie in Southern California.  An estimated 1.73 million commercial and residential mowers, blowers and other utility tools emit 22 tons per day of volatile organic compounds -- more than is belched out by all aircraft in the region.</P>
<P>In addition, lawn and garden equipment is responsible for 0.8 tons per day of nitrogen oxide emissions and 182 tons per day of carbon monoxide.</P>
<P><center><H2>Lawn and Garden Equipment<BR>
VOC Emissions</h2>
<IMG SRC="mower596.gif"  ALT="Undisplayed Graphic"><h4>More than 1.7 million pieces of commercial and residental lawn and garden equipment in the South Coast Air Basin emit 22 tons per day of smog-forming volatile organic compounds -- more than is emitted by all aircraft in the region.</H4></center>
<P><P>To help reduce lawn and garden equipment pollution, the California Air Resources Board required 1995 and later models to meet low-emission standards.  A second, more stringent standard will apply to 1999 and later model years.</P>
<P>Today's electric mowers can easily do the job without polluting at all.  Modern cordless-electric mowers powered by rechargeable batteries are lightweight, pack five horsepower and can mow up to half an acre on a single charge.  Electric mowers are only half as noisy as gas-powered models and don't require the hassle of fueling.</P>
<P>&quot;The average life of a lawnmower is seven years,&quot; Lents said.  &quot;If businesses take advantage of this program, they could speed up the replacement of polluting mowers with more environmentally friendly equipment.&quot;</P>
<P>AQMD conducts extensive outreach activities for its proposed rules seeking input from affected businesses and the general public.  In the case of Rule 1623, AQMD staff mailed 8,700 notices, conducted one workshop and mailed 158 copies of the requested rule.</P>

<B><A NAME="HEADLINE"></A>FIRST UNHEALTHFUL OZONE LEVEL OF YEAR
RECORDED TODAY</B> 
<P>
Ozone pollution rose to an unhealthful level today for the first
time this year, signaling the start of another Southland smog
season.
<P>
Ozone levels reached 0.13 parts per million, or 113 on the Pollutant
Standard Index, in the East San Bernardino Valley area. Ozone
is considered unhealthful when it exceeds the federal health standard
of 0.12 ppm, equivalent to 100 PSI.
<P>
Warm spring weather combined with atmospheric temperature inversions
have created favorable conditions this week for the formation
of ozone smog.
<P>
Last year, Southland residents endured 98 days of unhealthful
ozone levels.
<P>
Ozone causes coughing and tightness in the chest, is associated
with an increased risk of cancer and is strongly suspected of
causing permanent lung damage.
<P>
The pollutant forms when volatile organic compounds, including
fumes from gasoline, paint and vehicle exhaust, combine in sunlight
with nitrogen oxides, a byproduct of burning fuel in vehicles,
industries and home appliances.

<P>
<B>DR. CHUNG LIU TO HEAD AQMD'S TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT OFFICE</B>

<P>
Dr. James M. Lents, executive officer of the South Coast Air Quality
Management District, has appointed Dr. Chung S. Liu to the position
of Assistant Deputy Executive Officer for Technology Advancement.
<P>
The position has been vacant since December 1995 when Dr. Alan
Lloyd left AQMD to become the executive director of the Energy
and Environmental Engineering Center at the Desert Research Institute
in Reno, Nev.
<P>
AQMD's Technology Advancement Office promotes the research, development,
demonstration and commercialization of advanced low- or zero-emission
technologies and clean alternative fuels. As the head of this
office, Liu will oversee an aggressive program to fully employ
clean technologies and alternative fuels to meet the Southland's
air quality challenge.
<P>
Within six months of joining AQMD in 1981 as an air quality specialist,
Liu was promoted to program supervisor. In 1989, he was promoted
again to program manager; then, two years later he became director
of Applied Science and Technology.
<P>
-more-
<P>
After a reorganization of AQMD's management staff in 1995, Liu
was named director of Planning and Policy, a position he held
until his current promotion.
<P>
&quot;Throughout his assignments, Dr. Liu demonstrated the ability
to develop innovative solutions to complex and controversial air
quality problems, foster creative approaches and stimulate new
technologies,&quot; said Lents.
<P>
&quot;Chung's strong research background, extensive knowledge
of AQMD's core programs, and experience in managing technology-related
functions provide him with unique qualifications for his new position.&quot;
<P>
Liu has 20 years of scientific research and management experience.
Before AQMD, he worked as an air pollution modeling and impact
assessment consultant. He also was a member of a university interdisciplinary
research team that studied electric power generation for the State
of California.
<P>
Dr. Liu received his B.S. in Chemistry from Fu Jen University
in Taiwan. His three advanced degrees are from the University
of California, Los Angeles: a M.S. in organic chemistry; a doctorate
in environmental science and engineering; and a MBA in finance
and management science.

<B>SOLAR CELL ROOF SHINGLES TO POWER HOMES IN COMPTON</B>
<P>
<A NAME="START"></A>High-tech roof shingles made from solar
cells will provide most of the electricity needed at 12 Compton
homes in a project approved this month by air quality officials.
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District's Governing
Board approved the program to help demonstrate the solar roof
shingles and to provide clean energy technology to low- and moderate-income
families.
<P>
This summer, the Compton Community Redevelopment Agency and
the Nehemiah West Housing Corp. -- a non-profit coalition of more
than 300 Southland church and community groups -- will build 49
two-story, suburban-style homes to help revitalize a Compton neighborhood.
<P>
Instead of bolting add-on solar panels to rooftops after construction,
shingles containing photovoltaic cells will form an integral part
of the watertight roofs.  Photovoltaic cells, typically made from
silicon crystals, directly convert sunlight to electricity.
<P>
&quot;This project will demonstrate the use of rooftop photovoltaic
cells in a way that should be more reliable and aesthetic and
possibly less costly than traditional solar panels,&quot; said
James M. Lents, AQMD's executive officer.
<P>
It will be one of the first demonstrations of solar shingle
technology on residential rooftops in this country.
<P>
Building solar cells directly into roof shingles at a manufacturing
plant will reduce installation costs and allow for greater quality
control, Lents added.
<P>
Photovoltaic roof shingles mounted on portions of south-facing
roofs will generate about two kilowatts, or roughly 60% of each
home's total electric needs, AQMD officials said.  The balance
of electricity needs will be provided by the region's conventional
power grid.
<P>
The performance and costs of the photovoltaic roofs will be
measured and compared to homes in the same development that do
not have solar shingles.
<P>
AQMD is contributing $100,000 toward the project and the state's
Petroleum Violation Escrow Account is providing $200,000.
<P>
Photovoltaic cells, first developed in 1954, have been widely
used since then to power everything from satellites to calculators
to freeway call boxes.
<P>
Although improved designs have dramatically reduced the cost
of solar cells in recent years, they still provide electricity
at a higher cost than power from utility companies.
<P>
If this project is successful, housing developers could offer
solar-shingle roofs as an option on new homes, and the increased
demand could reduce the cost of photovoltaics, making them more
competitive with conventional utility power.
<P>
Homes with photovoltaic roofs could also generate power to
recharge electric vehicles, providing a totally emission-free
source of transportation.
<P>
&quot;Homeowners could save money in the long run with their
own rooftop power plants,&quot; Lents said. &quot;They also could
take pride in knowing that they are directly contributing to the
fight against smog by relying on a pollution-free source of energy.&quot;
<P>
AQMD is the air pollution control agency for Los Angeles,
Orange and portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.

<B>AQMD EMISSIONS TRADING PROGRAM RECOGNIZED BY WHITE HOUSE</B>
<P>
 The President's Council on Sustainable Development has recognized
the South Coast Air Quality Management District for its innovative
emissions trading program, known as RECLAIM.
<P>
 AQMD was honored with a certificate of appreciation for its REgional
CLean Air Incentives Market program, which provides businesses
with greater flexibility and cost savings in reducing nitrogen
oxide and sulfur oxide emissions, two key ingredients of the area's
air pollution.
<P>
 RECLAIM was one of more than 300 entries considered for the 1996
Presidential Awards for Sustainable Development.  The council
recognized AQMD for its &quot;commitment and work on behalf of
sustainable development in America.&quot;
<P>
 RECLAIM was adopted in 1993 to lower the cost of reducing pollution
in the South Coast Air Basin.
<P>
 Under RECLAIM, companies that have reduced emissions more than
required can sell their excess emission reduction credits to companies
exceeding their limits.  This allows businesses flexibility in
how to reduce emissions, yet assures that overall emissions decline
each year to meet air quality improvement goals.
<P>
 &quot;RECLAIM is a critical tool in achieving our region's clean
air objectives with the support of our business community,&quot;
said James M. Lents, AQMD executive officer.
<P>
 Since taking effect in 1994, the 350 facilities covered by RECLAIM
have traded more than 100,000 tons of emission reduction credits
for more than $10 million.
<P>
 A recent audit shows that the companies are on track toward meeting
the program's requirements to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions
by 77 tons a day and sulfur oxide emissions by 15 tons a day by
2003.
<P>
 The audit also showed that 86% of the facilities fully complied
with their initial emission reduction targets.
<P>
 RECLAIM is the first part of a broader AQMD strategy to foster
greater use of market incentives and flexible clean air strategies
in the Southland.

<B>PILOT PROJECT BENEFITS HIGH EMPLOYMENT, LOW POLLUTION FIRMS</B>
<P>
A pilot program that offers priority permitting services to Southland
companies dedicated to creating jobs and reducing air pollution
was unanimously approved by the region's air quality board today.
<P>
The &quot;Green Carpet&quot; Priority Permitting Service was developed
through a cooperative effort between the South Coast Air Quality
Management District and the California Council for Environmental
and Economic Balance.  It offers special assistance to firms looking
to expand business and create jobs, or install or develop advanced
air pollution control technologies.  
<P>
The &quot;Green Carpet&quot; service is part of AQMD's Regulatory
Reform Initiative, introduced in January to eliminate
permits for small sources and streamline the process for larger
facilities.  The 12-month pilot program starts today.
<P>
&quot;'Green Carpet' represents a mutual commitment between AQMD
and companies that have demonstrated their responsibility for
cleaning the air and maintaining a healthy economy in our region,&quot;
said AQMD Chairman Jon D. Mikels, a San Bernardino supervisor.

<P>
<H3><B></A>AIR QUALITY MONITORING NETWORK TO BE STREAMLINED</B></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="START"></A>As the Southland's air gets cleaner, the
South Coast Air Quality Management District plans to cut costs
by streamlining and downsizing its network of air quality monitoring
stations, agency officials announced today.
<P>
AQMD officials outlined a plan to modernize aging air pollution
measuring equipment and reduce the number of monitoring stations
from 35 today to 22 by the year 2008.
<P>
&quot;As we get closer to meeting health-based standards for
clean air, we will no longer need today's extensive network of
air pollution monitoring stations,&quot; said James M. Lents,
AQMD's executive officer.
<P>
&quot;If we achieve healthful air by 2010 -- as is required
by federal law -- we will only need a maintenance-level network
to ensure that we continue to meet air quality standards.&quot;
<P>
Streamlining the air quality monitoring network is part of
the agency's overall plan to reduce its size by 50% during the
next decade.
<P>
Starting this year, three stations will be closed.  An additional
four would be closed in 1998; two more would be closed in 2002
and four would be shut in 2008.  (See following table)
<P>
Fewer stations will be needed to monitor air quality in 2008
because, by then, health-based standards are expected to be achieved
for all pollutants except ozone.
<P>
Most of the remaining stations in 2008 will lie along the
foothills of the San Gabriel, San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountains
-- areas where ozone and fine particulate levels have typically
been the highest due to the region's climate and geography.
<P>
The federal Clean Air Act mandates that health standards be
met in all areas of the Los Angeles Basin by 2010 for ozone and
2006 for fine particulates.
<P>
After 2008, stations in highly urbanized areas of Los Angeles
and Orange counties would also monitor carbon monoxide and nitrogen
dioxide to verify that levels do not exceed federal health standards.
<P>
Money saved from the decreased network size and resulting
reduced workload would more than pay for equipment upgrades needed
during the next decade, AQMD officials said.
<P>
Air quality officials plan to replace such vintage equipment
as 20-year-old, paper-strip chart recorders with more sophisticated
electronic recording devices.
<P>
The new technology will allow air quality officials to remotely
diagnose and calibrate equipment, saving the time required to
travel to and from monitoring stations in the field.
<P>
AQMD also will acquire three mobile air monitoring stations
to update information at formerly monitored locations and check
on air quality in areas of rapid population growth.
<P>
AQMD is the air pollution control agency for Los Angeles,
Orange and portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.

<U>AQMD Holds Workshops in April</U> 
<P>
<B>SMALL, MINORITY FIRMS ENCOURAGED TO TAKE PART IN LAB PROGRAM</B>

<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District will hold three
workshops next month to encourage small businesses, and women-,
minority- and disabled veteran-owned firms to participate in its
Laboratory Approval Program.
<P>
One of AQMD's on-going privatization efforts, the program approves
private laboratories and firms to conduct a variety of source
emission tests and laboratory analyses within the South Coast
Air Basin. The program also approves contractors to certify the
emissions of standardized process equipment, such as residential
water heaters and boilers, before they are sold to consumers.
<P>
During the workshops AQMD staff will review the administrative,
technical, and operational requirements as well as the approval
guidelines for the program. Staff also will assist interested
attendees with their applications.
<P>
&quot;The Laboratory Approval Program has been in effect since
1993, but with these workshops we are re-focusing our
<P>
outreach to increase the number of small and minority-owned businesses
participating in the program,&quot; said AQMD Governing Board
Member Nell Soto, councilmember of the City of Pomona, who represents
the cities of Eastern Los Angeles County on the AQMD board.
<P>
The workshops will be held April 5, 18, and 19, at AQMD's Diamond
Bar headquarters, conference room CC6, from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Limited seating is available on a first come first serve basis.
Call Sylphide Crevelle at (909) 396-2264 to reserve your space.

dry cleaning</P> </B></I></U></A>
<H3><A NAME="I3">AQMD SUPPORTS NON-TOXIC CLOTHES CLEANING DEMONSTRATION</P>
</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="I4">Before long, the familiar garment label &quot;Dry
Clean Only&quot; may be as obsolete as the basin and wash board.</P>
</A>
<P>
South Coast Air Quality Management District officials are co-sponsoring
a project to demonstrate wet cleaning, a commercial cleaning process
that uses water instead of chemicals to clean everything from
wool sweaters to silk blouses.</P> 
<P>
&quot;Almost all dry cleaners now use perchloroethylene, or 'perc,'
a potentially toxic cleaning agent that pollutes the air and can
contaminate groundwater,&quot; said James M. Lents, AQMD's executive
officer.</P> 
<P>
&quot;Wet cleaning offers the promise of cutting air pollution,
reducing consumers' personal exposure to potentially toxic chemicals
and even saving money for commercial cleaners.&quot;</P> 
<P>
The wet cleaning demonstration started on Feb. 1 when businesswoman
Deborah Davis opened a garment cleaning shop in Santa Monica called
Cleaner By Nature.</P> 
<P>
Davis accepts all types of garment materials for cleaning, including
rayons, linens and wool items. Even though the garments are labeled
&quot;Dry Clean Only,&quot; all of them are cleaned using special
water-based washing machines at the shop's Los Angeles plant.</P>

<P>
Like domestic washers, commercial wet cleaning machines use soap
and water. Commercial machines differ in that they use computers
to precisely control temperature, agitation and humidity to minimize
shrinkage or stretching of clothes.</P> 
<P>
Customers have responded well to the non-toxic cleaning process,
Davis said.</P> 
<P>
&quot;People really like the fact that when they come into the
shop, they don't smell any chemical odors, and their cleaned clothes
smell fresh,&quot; she said.</P> 
<P>
Researchers at the Pollution Prevention Education and Research
Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, will spend
the next year collecting data at Davis' business to compare the
efficacy, costs and labor of wet cleaning to perc-based dry cleaning.</P>

<P>
UCLA staff also have initiated a dialogue with dry cleaning industry
representatives -- including Korean-Americans who run a large
number of Southland dry cleaning shops -- to inform them of the
potential merits of wet cleaning.</P> 
<P>
AQMD's Technology Advancement Office committed $50,000 toward
the study through a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant,
the California Air Resources Board gave $30,000 and EPA's Environmental
Technology Initiative program contributed an additional $75,000.</P>

<P>
<U><B>Favorable results from Chicago study</P></B></U> 
<P>
A 1995 study of wet cleaning in Chicago has already shown encouraging
results. In the project, sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, more than 16,000 garments were wet-washed at a commercial
cleaner. A customer survey showed that 86% rated the wet cleaning
service as &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good.&quot;</P> 
<P>
Wet cleaning does present some challenges to cleaners. Clothes
processed in a wet cleaning machine also take slightly longer
than dry cleaned ones to be dried and finished.</P> 
<P>
&quot;Wet cleaning is not 'plug and play',&quot; said Davis, borrowing
a phrase from the personal computing world. &quot;It takes time
to get a feel for the cleaning and finishing process.&quot;</P>

<P>
Wet cleaning machines cost less than dry cleaning equipment and
can be cheaper to operate because they do not require the purchase
of perchloroethylene, the expense of air pollution controls and
hazardous waste disposal fees for used perc.</P> 
<P>
In addition, wet cleaning would not trigger the strict water quality
discharge regulations and liability concerns that burden perc
cleaners.</P> 
<P>
Perc is considered a hazardous air pollutant and a possible cancer-causing
chemical. Small amounts of perc also remain in garments after
cleaning, although it is not known whether this low-level exposure
is harmful to human health.</P> 
<P>
Federal, state and AQMD regulations require that new dry cleaning
machines have highly efficient controls to capture almost all
perc emissions. Replacing existing dry cleaning machines with
wet washers could further reduce perc emissions in the region.</P>

<P>
Wet cleaning follows a trend of reducing pollution at its source,
rather than trying to capture it as it rises out of smoke stacks.
In the future, garments off the rack could carry new labels reading
&quot;Wet Clean Only.&quot;</P>

<H3><A NAME="I3">AMNESTY PROGRAM CAUSES PERMIT APPLICATIONS TO
SKYROCKET</P></A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="I4">As it comes to a close April 2nd, South Coast Air
Quality Management District's Amnesty Program -- a one-time, 6-month
effort to help businesses obtain permits -- has been hailed a
success by AQMD officials.</P></A>
<P>
Applications were received from 659 businesses as of March 20
-- nearly five times the number of existing equipment applications
received during the same period of the previous year. So far,
the permit applications have saved businesses at least $40,000
in late fees alone.</P>
<P>
AQMD Public Advisor LaRonda Bowen reminded businesses that they
still have time to apply for needed permits under the Amnesty
program until the 5:30 p.m., April 2 deadline. Applications postmarked
April 2nd will be accepted.</P>
<P>
Under the program, which began on October 3, 1995, businesses
that voluntarily file an application for unpermitted equipment
are not subject to 15% late fees and are excused from the risk
of penalty.</P>
<P>
&quot;Amnesty was successful because of the unprecedented outreach
program we conducted within the local business community and the
help of business networks,&quot; said Bowen.</P>
<P>
The outreach effort was supported with over-the-phone and on-site
compliance assistance from many dedicated AQMD engineers, technicians
and small business experts.</P>
<P>
To promote the program, AQMD employed newspaper and radio ads
and mailed 100,000 notices to business owners, using commercial
mailing lists in 60 different types of industries. </P>
<P>
The agency also worked with area Chamber of Commerce presidents,
trade associations, environmental consultants and certified permitting
professionals in the four-county metropolitan area to spread the
word about the permit amnesty program.</P>
<P>
The publicity blitz generated 2,474 phone calls to date and confirmed
that more than 900 callers did indeed need AQMD permits. No-fault,
on-site technical consultations were also conducted at 96 businesses.</P>
<P>
&quot;We visited facilities from Chatsworth to Colton, walked
factory floors and helped fill out forms,&quot; Bowen said. </P>
<P>
Some 55% of the businesses applying had never previously obtained
a permit from AQMD. Of these, 94% were facilities emitting less
than 10 tons of pollution a year.</P>
<P>
The bulk of the permit applications were for chlorofluorocarbon
recycling units used by auto air conditioning mechanics; internal
combustion engines, such as emergency power generators in office
buildings; spray booths at autobody and other commercial painting
concerns; printing operations, and storage and plating tanks.</P>
<P>
The Amnesty program received praise from Peter Hsiao, counsel
in the Los Angeles law office of McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and Enersen
and a former assistant U.S. attorney for the Department of Justice
on environmental and natural resource matters. </P>
<P>
Hsiao dubbed the permit program &quot;the year's most promising
environmental amnesty program,&quot; awarding it a gold medal
for sound policy making. Hsaio cited the regulation's simplicity,
few restrictions, and strong compliance assistance.</P>
<P>
The rule was created to help level the playing field by ensuring
that businesses that comply with air quality standards do not
face unfair competition from those who do not.</P>
<P>
Businesses who want further information on amnesty can call AQMD
at 1-800-388-2121.</P>

<H3><A NAME="HEADLINE"></A>STUDY SHEDS LIGHT ON DAIRIES' CONTRIBUTION
TO AIR POLLUTION <A NAME="START"></A></H3>

<P>
The Southland's 300,000 dairy cattle cause significantly less
particulate-producing ammonia pollution than previously thought,
according to a recently completed study.
<P>
The $130,000 project was funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency and the South Coast Air Quality Management District in
cooperation with Chino-area dairymen and the Ontario-based Milk
Producers Council.
<P>
Study results, combined with the migration of dairy farms from
Chino to the San Joaquin Valley and other areas, may result in
less need for future air pollution control at dairies.
<P>
Dairies' effect on air quality, and the possible need for future
pollution controls, will be assessed in AQMD's 1997 Air Quality
Management Plan now under development.
<P>
&quot;Dairies are a significant source of ammonia emissions, which
help form particulate pollution,&quot; said James M. Lents, AQMD's
executive officer. &quot;They also can create a notable odor nuisance.
<P>
&quot;Land use issues have caused some dairies to move to other
areas. If this trend continues, we may need only simple air pollution
controls at dairies or perhaps no control measures at all.&quot;
<P>
Emissions from livestock waste, along with manmade pollutants,
contribute to particulate pollution -- particles smaller than
1/7th the width of a human hair that blot out visibility and have
been linked to 275 premature deaths a year in the Inland Empire.
Inland areas of the Southland have the highest average levels
of particulate pollution in the nation.
<P>
Manure and urine from dairy cattle -- as well as from goats, sheep,
horses, pigs and chickens -- contains ammonia. Ammonia evaporates
into the atmosphere and combines with nitric acid pollution to
form ammonium nitrate particulates. (Nitric acid is formed when
nitrogen oxide emissions from cars, trucks and industries react
with sunlight.)
<P>
Previous studies found that about half of all ammonia emissions
in the region result from livestock waste, mostly from the Chino
area, home to some 250 dairy farms and one of the largest concentrations
of dairy cattle in the world. Areas downwind of the dairies have
the highest particulate pollution levels in the region.
<P>
Ammonia emissions also come from sewage treatment plants, compost
facilities and residential use of fertilizers.
<P>
Livestock waste also emits volatile organic compounds, and methane,
which contributes to global warming.
<P>
AQMD researchers studied ammonia emissions at four Chino-area
dairies in late September, early October and mid-December of 1995
by placing a sampling device resembling an upside-down casserole
dish on top of manure piles. Curious cows gathered to watch the
activity.
<P>
Preliminary results indicate that each cow is responsible for
11 to 20 pounds of ammonia emissions per year -- the lower number
representing winter emissions and the higher indicative of summer
rates. Warmer temperatures are thought to increase ammonia evaporation
and emissions.
<P>
The new study, considered the most definitive and authoritative
to date, shows that per-cow emissions are only one-fourth to one-third
of those reported by a 1987 study, which used less sophisticated
methods for estimating emission rates.
<P>
It will be used in developing the 1997 AQMP, a blueprint for achieving
federal health standards for particulate pollution by 2006, and
ozone standards by 2010. The 1997 AQMP is now being developed
through public workshops and is scheduled for an adoption hearing
by AQMD's Governing Board this fall.
<P>
The need for pollution controls at dairies will depend in part
on the number of farms remaining in the region during the next
decade. The number of dairies in the Chino area has declined from
about 450 in the 1970s to about 250 today due to urban encroachment,
increasing land values and other factors, and is expected to continue
to decline into the next decade.
<P>
AQMD is the air pollution control agency for Los Angeles, Orange
and portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.

<H3>SCHOOL BUS PROGRAMS SPELLS REGULATORY R-E-L-I-E-F</H3>

<P>
AQMD officials today voted 8 to 0 to allow public and private
primary and secondary schools to earn extra credit toward the
air pollution control agency's rule to reduce on-road vehicle
emissions.
<P>
The extra credit amendment to Rule 2202 is for schools that meet
their emission reduction targets through student busing programs
or are experiencing financial hardships. To meet that target the
district must transport two students for every one school district
employee who reports to work at a regulated site between 6 and
10 a.m. 
<P>
The change could save public school districts as much as $4.3
million a year.
<P>
Rule 2202 is a more flexible and less costly alternative to reduce
on-road mobile source emissions than
<P>
the South Coast Air Quality Management District's old rideshare
rule 1501. 
<P>
Last December the AQMD board directed staff to determine the economic
impacts of Rule 2202 on Southland schools and to analyze approaches
for offering the educational sites relief options from the new
rule. 
<P>
&quot;The changes to Rule 2202 offer area schools greater flexibility
in meeting their emission reduction goals and an opportunity to
lessen the financial burdens they now face,&quot; said AQMD Chairman
Jon D. Mikels, a San Bernardino County supervisor. 
<P>
In the South Coast Air Basin primary and secondary public schools
make up 376 of the 4,900 work sites affected by Rule 2202. Trips
generated by these schools emit 1.38 tons of pollution per day.
<P>
The board also directed staff to study ways of providing schools
with credit for students who walk, bike take public transit or
are carpooled to school.
<P>

and portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.

<H3><A NAME="HEADLINE">AQMD BOARD BACKS CREATING POLLUTION CLEAN-UP
FUND</A> </H3>

<P>
<A NAME="START">In a revolutionary shift in air pollution clean-up
policy, regional air quality officials today endorsed the concept
of establishing a public trust fund to help clean up remaining
sources of air pollution in the nation's smoggiest metropolitan
area.</A>
<P>
The trust fund would be a key element of &quot;The Clean Air Credit
Exchange&quot; concept, given a green light today by the South
Coast Air Quality Management District's Governing Board.
<P>
Under the proposal, businesses would be able to pay into a fund
used for clean-up projects in lieu of reducing their own emissions.
<P>
AQMD then would use the money to pay for clean-up projects, such
as conversion of vehicles and equipment to cleaner fuels, and
others that would reduce pollution in the Southern California
region.
<P>
&quot;As the region continues to seek economically sound ways
to clean the air, this system will keep us on the fastest, most
flexible and efficient path to that goal,&quot; said James M.
Lents, AQMD's executive officer.
<P>
&quot;It will foster economic growth while achieving clean air.&quot;
<P>
Following today's board meeting, AQMD staff will develop specific
rules defining the Clean Air Credit Exchange which the Governing
Board will consider adopting late this year.
<P>
Under the Exchange, businesses would have three options for meeting
smog control requirements: 1) reduce their own pollution; 2) buy
credits from sources of pollution that reduce emissions beyond
required levels; or 3) pay into the clean-up fund.
<P>
The trading market would enable businesses to develop credits
through such diverse options as scrapping dirty old cars and lawn
mowers, converting equipment and vehicles to clean fuels or selling
clean consumer products.
<P>
Possible sources of pollution credits would encompass more than
30,000 businesses; 10 million motor vehicles; ships, trains and
planes; and a vast array of consumer products used by the region's
14 million people.
<P>
For example, a paint manufacturer that reduced smog-forming ingredients
in its products by one pound per gallon below current limits would
earn one pound of emissions credit for each gallon of paint sold.
<P>
Revenues earned from emission credits sold on the open market
could help offset the cost of developing cleaner products such
as low-polluting paints.
<P>
&quot;The scope of this credit market should provide a positive
boost to development of clean air products,&quot; said Lents.
&quot;We should see an even faster pace toward healthful air over
the next five years.&quot;
<P>
The Clean Air Credit Exchange will significantly expand AQMD's
existing emission credit trading programs, including RECLAIM,
the REgional CLean Air Incentives Market for sources of nitrogen
and sulfur oxide emissions.
<P>
Unlike RECLAIM, the Exchange will not set an emissions cap on
facilities.
<P>
Instead, to ensure continued progress toward clean air, AQMD will
continue to develop regulations to reduce pollution from specific
industries.
<P>
Later this year, for instance, AQMD will consider rules to tighten
emissions limits for printers, restaurants, oil refineries, metal
product makers, airports, aerospace companies, and other sources
of pollution.
<P>
These sources then will have the choice of reducing emissions
as specified in the rules, purchasing emission credits from those
who have exceeded their requirements or paying into the clean
air fund to fulfill their obligation. Combinations of these approaches
would also be allowed.
<P>
The credit exchange program could be a valuable model for air
pollution control in other regions and other countries, Lents
said.
<P>
&quot;We're going to work closely with businesses to develop the
details of the program as soon as possible,&quot; he said.
<P>

and portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.

<H3>NEW EMISSIONS TRADING PLAN OUTLINED <BR>
</H3>

<P>
A proposed intercredit trading
market would establish a broad and unified emissions trading program
to help the region attain healthful air quality in the most economical
way.
<P>
Under the proposal made by
the South Coast Air Quality Management District, any facility
facing an emission reduction requirement could either reduce emissions
on-site or purchase credits generated by surplus emissions reductions
made by other sources.
<P>
Real, surplus and quantifiable
emissions reductions by stationary, on- and off-road, and so-called
area sources would all be eligible for credits.
<P>
For example, stationary sources,
such as businesses, could receive credits for promoting programs
to scrap old lawnmowers or cars, which pollute far more than today's
mowers or cars. This would be more economical for many companies
than installing additional controls on already tightly controlled
facilities.
<P>
&quot;This new market approach
will make air pollution clean up as economical as possible,&quot;
said James M. Lents, AQMD executive officer. &quot;However, we
also must work hard to adopt additional emissions control rules
to require further clean up.&quot;
<P>
A provision of the proposal
that would allow credits to be &quot;banked&quot; for future use
would provide a strong incentive for companies to install innovative
new equipment that would reduce emissions below required levels.
This would provide an extra public health benefit.
<P>
Another provision would allow
some high-polluting manufacturing operations to be shifted voluntarily
to winter when ozone smog is not a great concern.
<P>
Emissions reduction credits
under AQMD's new source review program and RECLAIM trading credits
could be traded in the market as long as they were backed by emission
reductions that are both excess and real.
<P>
Rules to put the program in
place are expected to go to the board for adoption in the latter
part of this year.

Permits for Small Sources</I></U> 
<H3><A NAME="HEADLINE"></A>MIKELS PROPOSES 1996 AQMD REGULATORY
REFORM INITIATIVE <A NAME="START"></A></H3>

<P>
South Coast Air Quality Management District chairman Jon Mikels
proposed a five-point program today to shrink the agency's size
by 50% during the next decade, eliminate permits for the smallest
sources and further streamline air pollution permitting.
<P>
AQMD's Governing Board directed the agency's staff to bring back
an action plan next month to carry out the recommendations.
<P>
&quot;AQMD has already done more than most government agencies
to become more efficient and business-friendly,&quot; Mikels said.
&quot;We've already reduced our staff 30% since 1992. Now we're
committing to a major, further downsizing.
<P>
&quot;We challenge state regulatory agencies to follow our lead
and where possible, reduce their staff by the same amount.&quot;
<P>
Also at Friday's Governing Board meeting, AQMD Executive Officer
James M. Lents briefed the board on the &quot;State of the AQMD,&quot;
including highlights of the agency's accomplishments in 1995 and
goals for 1996.
<P>
&quot;In 1995, we experienced the best air quality on record,
thanks to air pollution control programs adopted in the past,&quot;
Lents said.
<P>
&quot;Our challenge in 1996 and beyond will be to continue cleaning
up the air in the face of declining revenues and staff and an
ongoing need to minimize the regulatory burden on businesses.&quot;
<P>
Building upon Mikels' 10-point Business Clean Air Partnership
launched last year, his &quot;1996 AQMD Regulatory Reform Initiative&quot;
will cut red tape and costs for businesses affected by air quality
rules. The initiative aims to:
<P>
<B>Shrink the agency</B> to half its current size in the next
decade;
<P>
<B>Eliminate permits for small business </B>where feasible;
<P>
<B>Institute a &quot;Green Carpet&quot; service </B>to help businesses
get speedy permits;
<P>
<B>Take the paper and hassle out of permitting </B>by creating
an on-line computer system this year allowing businesses to file
applications electronically; and
<P>
<B>Enlist the support of the state Legislature</B> to ensure that
the No. 1 cause of smog -- motor vehicles and consumer products
-- do their fair share to clean up the air, rather than saddling
businesses with an inequitable burden.
<P>
The initiative also will seek the Legislature's support in reforming
costly state-mandated requirements for variance applications,
toxics inventory reporting and California Environmental Quality
Act analyses.
<P>
Finally, the program would seek legislation granting tax breaks
to businesses that manufacture or install super-clean air pollution
control equipment.
<P>
Aside from implementing the new regulatory reform initiative,
AQMD will have its hands full this year with as many as 33 emission-reducing
rules scheduled for adoption in 1996, Lents said.
<P>
&quot;Our goal is to accommodate the Southland's economic growth
while assuring continued progress toward clean air.&quot;

<H3>AIR BOARD SHELVES EXPANSION OF SMOG TRADING MARKET</H3>

<P>
A proposal to expand the region's existing pollution credit trading
system to cover another major pollutant was suspended by the region's
air quality board Friday in a favor of a new hybrid approach combining
traditional technology-based regulations with flexible trading
options for businesses.
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District board voted unanimously
to set aside the agency's proposed REgional CLean Air Incentives
Market for volatile organic compounds, or VOC RECLAIM, after encountering
widespread opposition from businesses and environmentalists.
<P>
Under the new concept, AQMD will set separate technology-based
standards, as it has in the past, for individual industries that
use large amounts of solvents, paints, inks and other materials,
such as furniture makers and printers. VOC fumes from these materials
are a significant component of Southern California's smog.
<P>
Businesses subject to these rules then would be able to meet their
emissions limits by installing pollution control devices and shifting
to new low-polluting materials.
<P>
Another option would be to earn or purchase air pollution credits
from reducing emissions from motor vehicles or so-called &quot;area
sources,&quot; such as water heaters, gardening equipment and
other small sources of pollution. This &quot;open trading&quot;
approach, which would allow businesses to choose the most economical
way of reducing pollution, will be discussed by the Board in February.
<P>
&quot;We are moving to this new approach due to concerns that
the previous proposal would limit economic growth in the region,&quot;
said Jon D. Mikels, chairman of the AQMD Governing Board.
<P>
&quot;Open trading, combined with technology-based standards,
will assure plenty of room for economic growth in the region and
more effectively control largely unregulated area sources and
motor vehicles, the number one cause of our region's smog.
<P>
&quot;Moreover, this new program will reduce pollution just as
much as the previous proposal.&quot;
<P>
For example, a company that makes furniture might be required
under a technology-based standard to reduce emissions from each
can of paint it uses by 25%. It could do so by using cleaner paint,
installing controls on its vents to treat the fumes or by earning
or purchasing credits from scrapping old, high-polluting cars
or lawn mowers.
<P>
Under the VOC RECLAIM proposal, most companies emitting more than
four tons a year of VOCs from paints and solvents would have had
to keep their emissions under a pollution cap that would decline
each year. Companies could have done this by reducing emissions
at their own facilities or purchasing credits from other companies
covered by the program that made excess emission reductions below
their caps.
<P>
The VOC RECLAIM program was modeled after the original RECLAIM
program, which covers nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides emitted
by large fuel-burning industries, such as oil refineries, powerplants,
glass factories and metal foundries. That program was adopted
in 1993 and has been in successful operation since 1994.
<P>

Orange and parts of Riverside and San Bernardino counties.

<H3><A NAME="HEADLINE"></A>RECLAIM AUDIT SHOWS MARKET-BASED PROGRAM
ON TRACK <A NAME="START"></A></H3>

<P>
The world's largest emissions trading market has been a success
so far, according to a South Coast Air Quality Management District
audit of the program released today.
<P>
The audit shows that emissions trading has taken off and that
the program is on track in accomplishing air quality objectives.
AQMD today also awarded 26 facilities in the innovative program,
known as RECLAIM, for outstanding compliance. RECLAIM is short
for REgional CLean Air Incentives Market.
<P>
Since RECLAIM began in January 1994, participating firms have
traded more than 100,000 tons of nitrogen and sulfur oxide emissions
for more than $10 million, according to the audit.
<P>
&quot;In just two years, RECLAIM has fostered a brisk emissions
trading market,&quot; said James M. Lents, AQMD's executive officer.
In addition to individual trades, two firms have sponsored a total
of six auctions for RECLAIM credits.
<P>
&quot;At the same time, the audit shows that firms in RECLAIM
are on track toward meeting the program's requirement of reducing
nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by 77 tons per day and sulfur oxide
(SOx) emissions by 15 tons per day by 2003,&quot; Lents said.
<P>
<U><B>No significant adverse economic impacts</B></U> 
<P>
During the program's first year, trading prices for NOx credits
ranged from an average of $24 per ton for 1994 to $1,529 for 2009.
SOx prices ranged from $13 per ton for 1994 to $960 in 1998. Those
prices are far below a $15,000 per ton level that would trigger
an extensive review of the program's cost effectiveness.
<P>
The total number of facilities in NOx/SOx RECLAIM decreased slightly
from 391 when the program began to 353 today. The main reason
for the decrease was a further analysis of facility emissions
showing that some fell below the four ton-per-year emissions threshold,
a minimum criterion for inclusion in RECLAIM.
<P>
Overall the report showed no significant adverse economic impacts
from RECLAIM.
<P>
<U><B>Compliance on track</B></U> 
<P>
AQMD inspectors visited each RECLAIM facility at least three times
during the first year and found that 86% of facilities complied
with their initial emission allocations. Since the main reason
for non-compliance was a lack of familiarity with the program,
AQMD plans additional education programs to make sure that facility
operators understand RELCAIM rule requirements.
<P>
The inspections also found that 26 facilities had an &quot;A+&quot;
compliance record with RECLAIM program requirements. Accordingly,
AQMD today awarded those businesses as &quot;Clean Air Partners.&quot;
A list of those facilities is attached.

and portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.

COMPUTERS TO POMONA SCHOOLS </H3>

<P>
The Southland's chief smog fighting agency has donated 150 IBM
compatible computers to the Pomona Unified School District for
Christmas this year.
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District made the 286 computers
available after upgrading its in-house network to a Windows environment
earlier this year.
<P>
&quot;AQMD, in its efforts to work closely with the community,
is donating computers to schools in depressed areas, such as Pomona,&quot;
said Nell Soto, a member of both AQMD's Governing Board and the
Pomona City Council.
<P>
&quot;Computers are essential in preparing today's students for
tomorrow's economy. We recognize schools' limited budgets and
are pleased to be able to provide them with these important educational
tools.&quot;
<P>
Pomona Unified will use the computers in secondary math and science
education.
<P>
&quot;These computers work well and can be used for many things,
including graphing data, word processing and accessing data, including
the Internet,&quot; said Jim Lents, AQMD Executive Officer. &quot;We
used them for all these tasks here until just a few months ago.&quot;
<P>
The computers will be put into service in the coming year.
<P>
AQMD's donation of computers to the Pomona school system is one
of the agency's many efforts to support educational programs.
In addition, AQMD is providing computers to a number of other
schools and youth programs around the Southland.<A NAME="START"></A>

<P>
<U><I>Up to 28% of vehicles tested found to be tampered</I></U>

<P>
<B>REMOTE SENSING PROVES EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR CUTTING SMOG</B> 
<P>
A field study of remote sensing of vehicle emissions in Orange
County has proven the technology to be one of the most cost-effective
tools available for reducing air pollution.
<P>
During two weeks in May, South Coast Air Quality Management District
officials measured tailpipe emissions of 39,000 vehicles as they
drove by two remote sensing sites in Costa Mesa and Santa Ana.
<P>
Up to 8% of vehicles measured were found to be high polluters
with tailpipe emissions far exceeding state air quality standards.
<P>
Police officers signaled motorists driving high-emitters to pull
over for a vehicle inspection. A quick check under the hood revealed
that up to 28% of vehicles inspected had been tampered, resulting
in high emissions, AQMD officials said.
<P>
Of 600 motorists pulled over, about 150 agreed to turn over their
vehicles on the spot for repair and emissions testing. Volunteers
were provided with rental cars while their vehicles were being
fixed.
<P>
<U><B>Repairs prove cost-effective</B></U> 
<P>
The cost of repairs ranged from $42 for a simple inspection to
$2,800 to replace an entire engine. The average cost was $630.
<P>
That works out to $870 to $1,730 per ton of air pollution reduced,
AQMD officials said.
<P>
Even including the cost of remote sensing -- about $1 per car
-- repairing high-polluters compares favorably to many traditional
methods of reducing vehicle pollution, AQMD officials said.
<P>
&quot;This study gives us one more tool to tackle the No. 1 source
of air pollution -- motor vehicles,&quot; said James M. Lents,
AQMD's executive officer.
<P>
Southland businesses can now use remote sensing and a vehicle
repair program to meet requirements of AQMD's Rule 2202, On-Road
Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options.
<P>
<U><B>Study points to high polluters as major problem</B></U>

<P>
The Orange County study bolstered previous research showing that
a minority of old, poorly maintained or tampered cars and pickups
are responsible for the majority of vehicle air pollution.
<P>
At the Costa Mesa site, 6% of vehicles had high carbon monoxide
(CO) emissions and 3% of vehicles had high hydrocarbon emissions.
<P>
At the Santa Ana site, 8% of vehicles had high CO readings and
4% had high hydrocarbon emissions.
<P>
High polluters are defined as those with greater than 4% CO tailpipe
emissions, which is more than four times the average of all cars
tested in the study, or more than 0.1% hydrocarbon emissions --
about three times the average of all vehicles tested.
<P>
The most common repairs performed on the high polluters included
fixing exhaust gas recirculation valves, a device designed to
recirculate some of the exhaust back to the engine, tune-ups and
adjusting or repairing carburetors, vacuum lines and oxygen sensors.
<P>
<U><B>High rate of tampering</B></U> 
<P>
Among those vehicles that motorists agreed to leave for repair,
13% were found to have emissions systems that had been tampered
with. Motorists who were pulled over but chose not to leave their
vehicles had a tamper rate of 28%.
<P>
Tampering included modified or missing air filters, air pumps,
belts, hoses and catalytic converters.
<P>
&quot;Unfortunately, some people still believe the myth that cars
will run better if emissions controls are disconnected,&quot;
Lents said.
<P>
AQMD officials are still awaiting results of another part of the
study that placed remote sensors at 10 off-ramps in Orange County
to profile a representative sample of the county's vehicle population.
<P>
The $250,000 study was conducted by Desert Research Institute
of Reno, Nev., and co-sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency and several other organizations.
<P>
AQMD is the air pollution control agency for Los Angeles, Orange
and portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.

<H3>AIR QUALITY OFFICIALS SCRAP CONTROVERSIAL RIDESHARE PROGRAM
</H3>

<P>
Southland air quality officials scrapped the region's ridesharing
requirement today by a vote of 9 to 3 and replaced it with a rule
focusing instead on reducing motor vehicle emissions, the number
one cause of smog.
<P>
To replace those reductions and still meet federal health standards,
the South Coast Air Quality Management District's Governing Board
adopted a more flexible and less costly alternative, Rule 2202:
On-road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options.
<P>
&quot;Employers will now have a wide range of cost-effective options
to help clean the air,&quot; said James M. Lents, AQMD's executive
officer.
<P>
Among the options provided under the rule are scrapping old, high-polluting
vehicles and using remote sensing devices to detect and repair
gross-emitting cars.
<P>
In addition, companies will be able to contribute to a fund administered
by AQMD that will be used to finance such air pollution reductions
regionwide.
<P>
Ridesharing will not be mandatory and was only included as a voluntary
option after many businesses asked to continue receiving emission-reduction
credit for their ridesharing programs.
<P>
The new rule should offer businesses substantial savings and increased
flexibility at an annual cost of just $37 to $43 per employee,
compared to about $110 per employee for the old ridesharing requirement.
<P>
The new program also will reduce paperwork. Instead of submitting
a lengthy ridesharing plan every two years, companies will be
able to turn in a one-page registration form outlining their chosen
vehicle emission reduction option.
<P>
<U><B>How it works</B></U> 
<P>
Until this year, any business with 100 or more employees had to
institute a plan encouraging workers to rideshare.
<P>
The goal of the program was to reduce driving -- and pollution
-- by increasing the average number of employees in vehicles commuting
to work. For most Southland companies, the goal was to increase
the average vehicle ridership to 1.5, or an average of 15 workers
in every 10 cars.
<P>
Under the new rule, businesses with 100 or more employees will
be required to meet an annual emissions reduction target based
on their number of employees.
<P>
These emission reductions are necessary to avoid sanctions under
the federal Clean Air Act, which could have a severe impact on
the region's economic growth.
<P>
Companies can meet their emissions reduction target by choosing
one or a combination of the following options:
<UL>
<LI><B>Old vehicle scrapping </B>of 1981 or older vehicles;
<LI><B>Remote sensing </B>of vehicle tailpipe exhaust to identify
and repair highly polluting vehicles;
<LI><B>Clean fuel vehicles</B> -- Convert vehicles or off-road
equipment such as forklifts to compressed natural gas, electricity
or other clean fuels;
</UL>

<P>
<B>Air Quality Investment Program </B>-- Any company can contribute
$60 per employee per year, or $125 per employee for a three-year
period to an escrow account. This is a substantial cost reduction
from the former Air Quality Investment Program, which required
a payment of $110 per employee per year. The per-employee cost
was reduced because entrepreneurs such as old vehicle scrappers
have shown that emissions can be cut for considerably less than
$110 per employee. Investment program money will be used to fund
projects reducing vehicle pollution; and
<UL>
<LI><B>Emission Reduction Credits</B> earned when a company over-controls
polluting equipment, or shuts down a facility, can also be used
to meet the employer requirement.
</UL>

<P>
Rule 2202 has a sunset clause to end on Dec. 31, 1998, or sooner,
provided it is replaced with a program such as transportation
market incentives that would reduce an equal amount of emissions.
AQMD also plans a comprehensive review next year of its entire
mobile source emissions reduction strategy.

<H3>HEALTH STUDY TO LINK HOSPITAL VISITS WITH SMOG LEVELS </H3>

<P>
Air quality officials approved a health study today that will
compare daily air pollution levels with the frequency of hospital
visits in the Southland.
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District's Governing Board
approved a $145,000 study that will use computerized data from
nine Kaiser Permanente hospitals in the region.
<P>
Emergency room visits and hospital admissions for asthma attacks
and other acute respiratory and cardio-pulmonary illnesses will
be compared with daily measurements of three of the region's most
hazardous air pollutants: ozone, PM10 and PM2.5.
<P>
PM10 refers to particulate pollution from cars, factories and
dust that is smaller than 10 microns, or about one-tenth the width
of a human hair. PM2.5 indicates particulate pollution smaller
than 2.5 microns.
<P>
A number of studies have linked PM10 and PM2.5 to a shortening
of life expectancy and an increased susceptibility to asthma attacks
and infections.
<P>
Ozone, a colorless gas formed in the atmosphere from auto and
industry air pollution, reduces breathing capacity, can kill lung
cells and may contribute to premature aging of the lung.
<P>
&quot;This is the first health study to use daily measurements
of particulates to define individuals' exposure to air pollution,&quot;
said James M. Lents, AQMD's executive officer.
<P>
&quot;It will give us a much more accurate picture of how harmful
smog is to residents' health. It will also help explain whether
residents here suffer greater health effects from air pollution
than people in other parts of the country.&quot;
<P>
Most previous health studies have relied on measurements of PM10
levels taken once every six days. The Kaiser study will take advantage
of a special AQMD program which measures PM10 and PM2.5 levels
daily at five locations: Los Angeles, Anaheim, Diamond Bar, Fontana
and Riverside.
<P>
Researchers will track hospital visits by Kaiser's 1.8 million
Southland members from April 1995 to February 1996 at hospitals
in Anaheim, Bellflower, Fontana, Harbor City, Los Angeles, Panorama
City, Riverside, West Los Angeles and Woodland Hills.
<P>
Final study results are expected in mid-1997. The study will be
conducted by the Kaiser Foundation Research Institute of Oakland
and funded by a grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
to AQMD.
<P>
The research will add to a $204,000 study approved by AQMD's Governing
Board in October to study health effects of PM10 and PM2.5 in
the Coachella Valley.

<P>
<B>AQMD REMOVES MAJOR BARRIER TO BUSINESS EXPANSION</B> 
<P>
Air quality officials today removed a major regulatory barrier
to business expansion in the Southland.
<P>
In amending the South Coast Air Quality Management District's
requirements for businesses that expand, modernize or relocate
within the region, the Governing Board decided that emissions
increases from past projects do not need to be offset before new
projects can go forward.
<P>
This change to Regulation XIII fulfills yet another of the 12
commitments made in AQMD's Business Clean Air Partnership program,
adopted last April.
<P>
&quot;Our action potentially will save some 19,000 Southland businesses
$1.4 billion when they expand, modernize or relocate in the region,&quot;
said AQMD Chairman Jon Mikels. &quot;This removes a substantial
hurdle to economic expansion.&quot;
<P>
Regulation XIII meets a federal Clean Air Act requirement designed
to prevent emissions increases as the economies of smoggy areas
expand. The federal law requires that emission increases from
major industries be offset, generally through use of new and cleaner
technology on existing facilities or through purchase of &quot;offset
credits&quot; from other companies that have installed such technology
and reduced emissions beyond what is required by regulations.
<P>
For instance, in the South Coast Air Basin, the federal Clean
Air Act requires major sources of pollution that want to expand
to offset each new pound of emissions by a 1.2 pound decrease
in emissions. Expanding businesses can do this by further controlling
their existing facilities or by purchasing credits from other
companies that have installed technology to reduce their emissions
below permitted levels. Companies that have closed down facilities
also can sell offset credits.
<P>
Today's restoration of a pre-1990 exemption for small emissions
increases will eliminate the need for businesses to offset a total
of 238 tons of emissions a day. This represents a cost-savings
to Southland businesses of an estimated $1.4 billion at today's
offset credit prices.

<H3>AQMD BOARD APPROVES $204,425 TO SCRAP 700 OLD VEHICLES </H3>

<P>
Air quality officials committed $204,425 on Friday to scrap old,
high-polluting vehicles as an alternative to rideshare programs
at 45 Southland firms.
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District's Governing Board
unanimously approved the project, which is the first to be funded
by the agency's Air Quality Investment Program.
<P>
The program, created earlier this year, is one of several alternatives
now available under AQMD's employer emission-reduction program.
It allows businesses with 100 to 200 employees to pay to the fund
$110 per worker arriving during morning rush hours instead of
carrying out a traditional employee rideshare program.
<P>
&quot;We have had a very positive response to this program,&quot;
said James M. Lents, AQMD's executive officer. &quot;It promises
exciting new opportunities for businesses to reduce pollution
from the largest single source -- vehicles driven by their workers.&quot;
<P>
AQMD's Governing Board will consider a proposal in December to
expand the program to businesses with 100 to 500 employees. The
board will also consider reducing the program cost from $110 per
employee per year to $60, or $125 per employee for three years.
<P>
Entrepreneurs such as old vehicle scrappers have recently shown
that emissions can be reduced for considerably less than $110
per employee.
<P>
Eco-Scrap Co., a Los Angeles-based subsidiary of Unocal Corp.,
will receive $204,425 to scrap about 700 vehicles during the next
year.
<P>
Scrapping that number of vehicles will reduce more emissions than
the rideshare programs replaced at the 45 companies that contributed
to the program. (See following table)
<P>
Motorists are typically paid up to $600 per vehicle turned in
for scrapping. The clunkers must be in running condition and registered
to a Southland owner for the past two years. Only pre-1982 vehicles
are eligible for the program.
<P>
Pre-1982 vehicles account for only 18% of the Southland's auto
fleet, but may contribute as much as 60% of volatile organic compound
(VOC) emissions, 54% of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 60% of carbon
monoxide pollution from vehicles, AQMD officials said.
<P>
VOCs and NOx combine in sunlight to form ozone, a widespread pollutant
suspected of causing permanent lung damage. Unhealthful carbon
monoxide levels have been linked to an increase in congestive
heart failure among the elderly.
<P>
Scrapping older vehicles helps clean the air by speeding the retirement
of dirty cars with worn-out emissions control systems.
<P>
&quot;Scrapping clunkers alone is not a solution to the Southland's
smog problem, which is by far the worst in the nation,&quot; Lents
said. &quot;But it is a cost-effective adjunct to other pollution
control strategies.&quot;
<P>
Scrapping old vehicles costs less than $3,000 per ton of pollution
reduced compared to $18,000 to $36,000 per ton for a traditional
rideshare program, AQMD officials said.
<P>
AQMD's board will review and approve investment program proposals
every three months. Since companies contributed a total of $489,480
to the fund during the third quarter of 1995, the program has
a balance of $285,055, which will be carried over to the next
three-month review.
<P>
Several other proposals for reducing vehicle emissions were not
funded on Friday, but could be considered during the next three
months. They include additional old vehicle scrapping, continuation
of shuttle service to a Metrolink train station, an on-line computer
database for vanpools and an outreach program aimed at increasing
the number of compressed natural gas-powered vehicles on the road.
<P>
Investment program money resides in an escrow account completely
separate from AQMD operating funds. Any group or individual can
apply for Air Quality Investment Program money for projects reducing
mobile source pollution.
<P>
Projects must reduce at least as much pollution as the rideshare
programs they replace, must be as cost-effective or cheaper than
those programs and must be completed within one year.
<P>
AQMD is the air pollution control agency for Los Angeles, Orange
and portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.

programs should call Eco-Scrap at 213-580-1498.</I>

<H3>COMPANY BEATS YEAR 2010 POLLUTION CONTROL GOAL WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY
</H3>

<P>
A Vernon company that supplies refrigeration and electricity has
already surpassed its 2010 pollution control reduction requirement
through an innovative new technology that makes it one of the
cleanest power generators in the world running on fossil fuel.
<P>
Sunlaw Energy Corp.-- which supplies refrigeration service for
two large cold storage facilities that keep food fresh before
going to market -- developed the new pollution control technology
that reduces emissions by more than 80%.
<P>
Starting with the help of co-funding from the South Coast Air
Quality Management District's Technology Advancement Office in
1990, Sunlaw set out to reduce nitrogen oxides emitted by its
two 29-Megawatt natural-gas powered turbines. Nitrogen oxides
-- produced as a byproduct of burning any fossil fuel -- are a
chief component of both the ozone and fine particle pollution
that blankets Southland skies.
<P>
The turbines run refrigerators and freezers used by U.S. Growers
and Federal Cold Storage -- also in Vernon -- and provide electricity
to Southern California's power grid.
<P>
&quot;We both wanted to demonstrate new technologies that could
reduce their emissions without using ammonia, which is a toxic
gas that can form a lethal cloud if accidentally released,&quot;
said Andy Abele, manager of technology advancement for AQMD. Many
facilities around the area use ammonia to reduce nitrogen oxide
emissions in a process called selective catalytic reduction.
<P>
&quot;While the original work focused on injecting water into
the gas turbine, the company subsequently developed a catalyst
that is as effective in reducing nitrogen oxides as the ammonia-based
process, but without the toxic hazard,&quot; Abele said. &quot;In
addition, it has the added benefit of reducing carbon monoxide
emissions.&quot;
<P>
The Sunlaw carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide (SCONOx [trademark])
system uses a self-regenerating proprietary catalyst to reduce
emissions of nitrogen oxides from 25 parts per million to 4 parts
per million. It also reduces emissions of carbon monoxide and
eliminates ammonia emissions normally associated with selective
catalytic control equipment.
<P>
&quot;We wanted to do what was right for the environment,&quot;
said Sunlaw President Robert Danziger. &quot;We were concerned
about toxic ammonia emissions and the chance a leak could occur,
particularly because there is a school nearby. We would have needed
to store some 10,000 gallons of ammonia on site for selective
catalytic reduction.&quot;
<P>
&quot;We had to invest a lot to develop this new technology, but
we have found it is cost-competitive with selective catalytic
reduction.&quot;
<P>
Sunlaw now is hoping to market the new catalyst to other industrial
energy suppliers and users.

<H2>OZONE SMOG SEASON CALLS IT QUITS </H2>

<P>
Although last summer's heat waves created the potential for high
smog levels, the Southland once again experienced the cleanest
smog season on record.
<P>
Only 13 Stage 1 ozone episodes occurred this year, compared to
23 last year, and 59 ozone health advisories, compared to 96 last
year. The year's highest ozone reading -- 0.26 parts per million
-- also was the lowest recorded in the past 20 years.
<P>
&quot;Not only were emissions down this summer, but their smog-forming
potential has been reduced as the area has moved to cleaner fuels
and products,&quot; said James M. Lents, AQMD's executive officer.
<P>
&quot;Yet, even with this remarkable progress, we still live in
the smoggiest region of the nation, where ozone health standards
are violated almost one of every three days,&quot; he said. (See
sidebar on how smog affects individual health.)
<P>
Thanks to cleaner cars, businesses and consumer products, volatile
organic compound (VOC) emissions have been cut significantly since
1985, AQMD officials said. Those two pollutants combine in sunlight
to form ozone.
<P>
If air pollution had remained constant since the 1980s, this summer's
weather would have resulted in approximately 80 Stage 1 ozone
episodes, according to an AQMD computer analysis.
<P>
An analysis of VOC pollution shows that since 1987, as a result
of the use of cleaner products such as water-based paints, VOC
emissions now have slightly less ozone-forming potential.
<P>
<U><B>Carbon monoxide season ahead</B></U> 
<P>
As cooler weather settles over the Southland, carbon monoxide
levels will rise to unhealthful levels in parts of Los Angeles
County.
<P>
Carbon monoxide levels are typically highest during fall and winter
when cool air and stagnant atmospheric conditions trap the pollutant,
primarily from vehicle tailpipes, close to the ground.
<P>
A recent health study linked peak levels of carbon monoxide pollution
with up to 40% increase in congestive heart failure among elderly
Los Angeles County residents.
<P>
In 1994, carbon monoxide levels reached their highest levels in
South Central Los Angeles County, and the federal standard for
that pollutant was violated there on 22 days. The federal standard
is violated when average carbon monoxide levels exceed 9.5 parts
per million during an eight-hour period.
<P>
<U><B>New ozone standard proposed</B></U> 
<P>
While progress is being made in reducing ozone levels, recent
health studies have shown that residents suffer adverse health
effects when exposed for several hours at levels below the current
federal health standard of 0.12 ppm.
<P>
As a result of those studies and a requirement in the federal
Clean Air Act to periodically review health standards, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency is expected to propose a new standard
for ozone next year.
<P>
EPA officials are considering setting a new ozone standard at
0.07 to 0.09 ppm averaged over eight hours.
<P>
If such a standard were imposed today, it would have the effect
of increasing the number of days the Southland exceeds the federal
ozone standard from about 100 to 120 days per year.
<P>
<B>&quot;</B>Our greatest success to date has been wiping out
days with very high levels of ozone,&quot; Lents said. &quot;We
must continue to reduce the high number of days that residents
are exposed to unhealthful levels of ozone above the federal standard.&quot;

<H3>SMOG, IMPACTING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH </H3>

<P>
Smog. It's the brownish cloud that covers Southern California,
particularly during the summer and fall. Like a David Copperfield
illusion it causes mountain ranges to disappear and shrouds skyscrapers
that on a clear day tower above the land.
<P>
But smog -- a mixture of pollutants including ozone, particulate
matter, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide -- does much more
than decrease visibility for the more than 14 million people living
here in the South Coast Air Basin. It affects their health; and
for some, the effects are serious.
<P>
&quot;The elderly, children, and people with respiratory, heart
and lung diseases are the most susceptible groups,&quot; said
Dr. Shankar Prasad (M.D.), health effects officer for the South
Coast Air Quality Management District.
<P>
But even healthy, athletic individuals can feel the effects of
breathing polluted air, especially after engaging in vigorous
outdoor activities on unhealthful days, said Prasad.
<P>
While unhealthful air is a particular concern during the summer,
fall also has high levels of pollution, including elevated levels
of particulate and nitrogen dioxide.
<P>
<U><B>How it can affect us</B></U> 
<P>
Both Russell Martinez, 44, and Mark Rockenmacher, 34, are pharmacy
technicians at the Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in <B>DOWNEY</B>.
Both also are healthy, native Angelinos who enjoy the outdoors.
<P>
&quot;I'm an avid jogger,&quot; said Martinez, who lives in <B>LA
MIRADA</B>. &quot;I've attempted to run when it was smoggy, but
I felt more fatigued the day after and had to take a couple of
days off from jogging to recuperate. Now when I feel smog in the
air I don't exercise.&quot;
<P>
However, Rockenmacher, a die-hard road and mountain biker, doesn't
let the smog stop him. &quot;I'm out there regardless,&quot; he
said.
<P>
The <B>BELLFLOWER</B> resident bikes an average 25 miles two to
three times a week. On smoggy days he says he does feel the difference.
&quot;No doubt, smog slows you down. It's harder to breathe and
that causes you to take deeper breaths. You take in a lot of filth.
That heat and smog can zap you.&quot;
<P>
Unhealthful levels of ozone irritate the eyes, reduce breathing
capacity, inflame lung tissue, reduce the respiratory system's
ability to fight infection and may accelerate the lung's aging
process and increase asthma attacks. Some people also experience
chest pains, coughing, wheezing and nausea. Recent studies show
that unhealthful air in urban areas may shorten an individual's
life span by up to three years.
<P>
Fine particulate and nitrogen dioxide cause similar symptoms.
<P>
&quot;I can tell when it's smoggy because my eyes get watery and
I can barely breathe,&quot; said Jeffrey Foust, age 8. He and
his brother Brian Foust, age 10, are asthmatic. They, with their
parents Sandy and David Foust and three other brothers, have lived
in <B>RIVERSIDE</B> since 1986.
<P>
&quot;It seems we're always in the doctor's office,&quot; said
Sandy. She and four of her sons -- including Brian and Jeffrey
-- have allergies. &quot;I have a tough time of it,&quot; she
said. &quot;When my sinus infections flare up I'm down for three
to four days.&quot;
<P>
But, her main concern is how smog affects her children, especially
while they are in school. &quot;My children attend school here
year round, and I'm worried about them playing outdoors in August
and September when the smog levels peak in this area,&quot; said
Sandy.
<P>
Brian says he chooses not to go outside when the air is bad. &quot;I
used to try to run and play soccer but it was too hard for me
to breathe. I would cough until my face turned red.&quot;
<P>
In response to concerns like Sandy's, AQMD recently strengthened
its procedures to warn schools and the public when ozone reaches
unhealthful levels. The rule changes encourage the basin's 1,500
day care centers, public and private schools to receive notification
when ozone levels are forecast to exceed the federal health standard,
equal to 100 PSI (Pollution Standard Index).
<P>
&quot;These changes to our emergency episodes rule include recommended
actions to help the schools in our jurisdiction develop and implement
plans to curtail students' outdoor activities when the air reaches
unhealthful levels,&quot; said AQMD Executive Officer James Lents.
<P>
Sandy said she would like her family to move to an area where
the air is cleaner. &quot;I would love to live on the beach, along
the coast or in the mountains to see just how much the smog really
does affect our health.&quot;
<P>
According to the American Lung Association, 11% of the people
living in the basin (1.6 million) suffer from some chronic respiratory
problem -- i.e., emphysema, bronchitis, asthma or lung cancer
-- that could be attributed to or aggravated by the region's poor
air quality.
<P>
Albert Bolden, age 68, of <B>LOS ANGELES</B> is included in that
statistic. Two years ago the doctors told him that he has emphysema.
<P>
&quot;I would walk from one place to another and noticed it was
getting harder for me to catch my breath,&quot; he said. &quot;I
thought it was because I had gained weight.&quot; Bolden also
admits he's a smoker and has smoked cigarettes for the past 45
years.
<P>
Before the diagnosis, his daily routine as a state officer at
Exposition Park included patrolling the grounds and crowd control
during sporting and other special events. Now that has changed.
<P>
Bolden says his condition is so easily aggravated by the smog
that he now works nights and spends most of his days, during the
summer months, indoors.
<P>
&quot;When I get up I just know it. I close up the house, and
turn on the fan because we don't have air conditioning. But it
draws in the outside air ... and the smog. So I can't do much,&quot;
said the Texas native who moved to Los Angeles in 1955.
<P>
&quot;I get winded just walking around the house or combing my
hair.&quot;

</H5>

<H4>SMOG EMERGENCY RULE STREAMLINED, HEALTH WARNINGS UPDATED</H4>

<P>
In light of dramatic improvement in air quality, Southland officials
today eliminated the need for thousands of businesses to file
plans outlining steps to reduce pollution during extreme smog
episodes.
<P>
&quot;We haven't had a Stage II smog episode since 1988 or a more
serious Stage III episode since 1974,&quot; said James M. Lents,
executive officer of the South Coast Air Quality Management District.
&quot;Pollution control rules have reduced emissions enough that
these high smog levels no longer occur.
<P>
&quot;But we still have frequent days when smog exceeds health
standards, so we're also stepping up our efforts to inform schools
and the public about necessary health precautions.&quot; (<TT><U>Note:</U></TT>
See accompanying press release for details.)
<P>
The changes to AQMD's Regulation VII eliminate the need for written
plans from industries and major employers outlining economic production
activity curtailments to minimize emissions during Stage II and
Stage III smog episodes.
<P>
The amendments also strengthen public health warning procedures,
through which schools traditionally have been advised to curtail
physical activity programs during state health advisory conditions
and higher federal Stage I episodes.
<P>
The changes make good on an element of AQMD's 12-point Clean Air
Partnership program, approved by the Governing Board in April,
to streamline air quality rules and reduce paperwork requirements.
<P>
AQMD is the air pollution control agency for Los Angeles, Orange
and parts of Riverside and San Bernardino counties.

<H5><TT><U>Based on Latest Medical Findings</U></TT> </H5>

<H4>SMOG HEALTH WARNINGS TO SCHOOLS, PUBLIC STRENGTHENED</H4>

<P>
In light of recent medical studies indicating smog causes adverse
health effects at levels lower than previously believed, local
air quality officials have decided to strengthen warnings to schools
and the public when ozone reaches unhealthful levels.
<P>
&quot;Medical evidence abounds that ozone is unhealthful,&quot;
said James M. Lents, executive officer of the South Coast Air
Quality Management District. &quot;So we're going to issue precautionary
statements to schools as soon as ozone exceeds the federal health
standard.&quot;
<P>
Traditionally, Lents said, AQMD has notified only public schools
of heavy smog conditions.
<P>
&quot;Now, we're also requesting the region's 1,500 private schools
and thousands of preschools and day care centers to heed our health
warnings,&quot; he said. &quot;That's because children are highly
sensitive to smog.&quot;
<P>
Under changes to AQMD's Regulation VII, which covers smog emergencies
and public health notification, an advisory will be given to schools
and day care centers once ozone exceeds the federal health standard
of .12 parts per million, or 100 PSI (Pollutant Standards Index)
at their request. The health warnings are as follows:
<P>
_ <TT><B>When above .12 ppm, or 100 PSI, the federal health standard,</B></TT>
susceptible individuals, e.g. children (or adults) with heart
or lung disease, should minimize outdoor activity. Healthy individuals
with a noticeable adverse health response to existing conditions
should minimize activity.
<P>
_ <TT><B>When at or above .15 ppm, or 138 PSI, the state health
advisory level,</B></TT> all children (and adults) should discontinue
prolonged, vigorous outdoor exercise lasting longer than one hour
(e.g., calisthenics, basketball, running, soccer, football, tennis,
swimming laps and water polo). Susceptible persons, such as those
with heart or lung disease, should avoid outdoor activity.
<P>
_ <TT><B>When at or above .20 ppm, or 200 PSI, the federal Stage
I episode level,</B></TT> all children (and adults) should discontinue
all vigorous outdoor activities regardless of duration. Outdoor
physical education classes, sports practices and athletic competitions
should be re-scheduled or canceled.
<P>
Schools currently are notified of smog episodes via a special
emergency broadcast radio network. However, other options, such
as faxes or pagers are being considered.
<P>
Any member of the general public can obtain current smog readings
and health warnings by calling 1-800-242-4666 and entering their
zip code.

<H1><TT><B>POLLUTION-FREE FUEL CELL VEHICLES TO BE TESTED IN PALM
DESERT</B></TT> </H1>

<P>
<TT>Taking the next step toward development of totally pollution-free
automobiles, air quality officials have funded a project to build
vehicles that run on hydrogen produced by sunlight and wind.</TT>

<P>
<TT>The South Coast Air Quality Management District's Governing
Board agreed to contribute $550,000 this month toward a $4.23
million, multi-organization project to build and test eight fuel
cell-powered electric vehicles during the next three years.</TT>

<P>
<TT>Five utility carts and three &quot;neighborhood vehicles&quot;
-- narrow, two-seater cars -- will run on hydrogen produced by
a solar photovoltaic array near Palm Desert's City Hall and a
wind turbine north of the city. The City of Palm Desert will use
the vehicles on city streets for utility and demonstration purposes.</TT>

<P>
<TT>&quot;Unlike battery-powered electric vehicles, which may
be associated with a small amount of air pollution from the power
plants that charge them, these vehicles will truly have zero emissions
from cradle to grave,&quot; said James M. Lents, AQMD's executive
officer.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>&quot;Even the fuel production will not result in any pollution,&quot;
he said.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>The utility carts -- actually golf carts converted from batteries
to fuel cell power -- will be used on city streets, displacing
polluting gasoline-powered vehicles.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>City of Palm Desert officials pioneered the on-road use of
golf carts in recent years for local transportation. State legislation
allows the city to license electric golf carts for driving on
city streets.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Fuel cell-powered golf carts will be capable of much more
than their battery-powered cousins. They are expected to have
a range of up to 100 miles -- more than 10 times that of battery-powered
golf carts. Refueling fuel cell carts takes just minutes as opposed
to several hours needed to recharge battery electric vehicles.</TT>

<P>
<TT>Some of the fuel cell-powered electric golf carts will be
fitted with small pickup beds and used for city park patrols,
maintenance and a variety of utility functions. Neighborhood vehicles
are suitable for all but freeway driving.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>City of Palm Desert officials hope the project will attract
fuel cell manufacturers to the area.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>&quot;We want Palm Desert to become the Silicon Valley of
fuel cells,&quot; said Paul Shillcock, director of economic development
for the City of Palm Desert.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Researchers at the Schatz Energy Research Center at Humboldt
State University in Arcata will design and build the vehicles.
Under the direction of engineering professor Peter Lehman, they
will retrofit existing battery-powered golf carts and neighborhood
electric vehicles to run on proton exchange membrane fuel cells.</TT>

<P>
<TT>&quot;The lessons learned from building these small prototype
vehicles will provide valuable information toward the development
of full-sized automobiles powered by emisson-free fuel cells,&quot;
said Roy Wilson, an AQMD board member and Riverside County supervisor.</TT>

<P>
<TT>Fuel cells, first invented more than a century ago, chemically
convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity. The only byproducts
are pure water and heat.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Fuel cells have been used extensively in spacecraft and are
now being demonstrated in buildings and urban transit buses.</TT>

<P>
<TT>Hydrogen for the Palm Desert vehicles will be produced from
electricity generated by a 4,000-square-foot, 50-kilowatt solar
array, and a 65-kilowatt wind turbine. The electricity will be
used to extract hydrogen from water through a process known as
electrolysis. Fuel cells will get oxygen from outdoor air.</TT>

<P>
<TT>Hydrogen gas will be compressed and transported to a site
where the vehicles will can be refueled. The solar panels and
wind turbine are expected to produce enough hydrogen each day
to equal the energy content of eight to 16 gallons of gasoline
-- enough fuel to drive each of the eight vehicles 50 to 100 miles
a day.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Project leaders will also build a diagnostic and service center
in Palm Desert for the fuel cell vehicles.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>&quot;Petroleum products such as gasoline pollute our atmosphere,
and once they are taken from the Earth they cannot be replenished,&quot;
Lents said.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>&quot;This project will create a model for a pollution-free
community transportation system that uses an unlimited energy
source -- the wind and the sun.&quot;</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Organizations contributing to the project, and the expected
amount of their contributions include:</TT> 
<P>
<TT>_ U.S. Department of Energy: $1,859,300;</TT> 
<P>
<TT>_ AQMD: $550,000 during fiscal year 95-96 and $275,000 during
fiscal year 96-97 for a total of $825,000;</TT> 
<P>
<TT>_ City of Palm Desert: $300,000;</TT> 
<P>
<TT>_ DuPont Fluoroproducts of Wilmington, Del.: $42,500; and</TT>

<P>
<TT>_ Teledyne Brown Engineering of Hunt Valley, Md.: $40,000.</TT>

<P>
<TT>In addition, the following dollar amounts of services will
be contributed by:</TT> 
<P>
<TT>_ City of Palm Desert: $434,000;</TT> 
<P>
<TT>_ Schatz Energy Research Center: $521,640;</TT> 
<P>
<TT>_ Wintec of Palm Springs: $145,000; and</TT> 
<P>
<TT>_ ASE Americas, Inc. of Billerica, Mass: $61,000.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Finally, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Sandia
National Laboratory, both in Livermore, will contribute technical
expertise on hydrogen and fuel cells.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>AQMD is the air pollution control agency for Los Angeles,
Orange and portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.</TT>

<H1><TT><B>THE HAZE OF SUMMER DAYS: IS IT NATURAL OR IS IT POLLUTION?</B></TT>
</H1>

<P>
<TT>You've probably heard stories of newcomers who move to Southern
California, buy a house, and later discover to their surprise
that their home has a striking view of the mountains.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>The Southland's legendary haze -- from reddish-brown smudges
on the horizon to whitish clouds -- obliterate scenic vistas all
too often.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>In 1990, Ontario residents couldn't see more than 10 miles
-- roughly the distance from their homes to Mt. Baldy -- on two
out of every three days. Last year, one of the cleanest on record,
east San Gabriel Valley residents couldn't see that far on one
of every three days.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Many residents naturally associate haze and a lack of visibility
with air pollution. Even though some pollutants such as ozone
and carbon monoxide cannot be seen, when people see haze, some
assume they are looking at the effects of industrial and automotive
air pollution.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Are they correct? Or is the Southland's haze simply the result
of its coastal climate, windblown dust and other &quot;natural&quot;
causes?</TT> 
<P>
<TT>&quot;It's virtually impossible to tell the difference between
naturally occurring haze and man-made pollution with the naked
eye,&quot; said James M. Lents, AQMD's executive officer.</TT>

<P>
<TT>&quot;However, air quality trends do give us some clues.&quot;</TT>

<P>
<TT>&quot;Natural&quot; sources of haze include fog, sea salt,
vegetation, smoke from wildfires and wind-blown dust.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Man-made haze is primarily from particulate pollution -- a
complex combination of particles emitted directly from vehicle
tailpipes and industry smokestacks, as well as particles formed
during photochemical reactions of pollutants in the atmosphere.</TT>

<P>
<TT><U><B>Smog or fog?</B></U></TT> 
<P>
<TT>&quot;As a general rule of thumb, a whitish haze during morning
hours is due to moisture or fog in the air,&quot; Lents said,
noting that some particulate pollution may also be present.</TT>

<P>
<TT>&quot;If haze is still present by mid-afternoon, the primary
culprit is particulate pollution because the sun has evaporated
the fog,&quot; he said.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>To be more precise, if haze is present when the relative humidity
is below 70%, particulate pollution is the primary cause of poor
visibility. During a typical summer morning in the Southland,
relative humidity can range from 90% to 100%. By afternoon, it
will have fallen to 30% to 40%.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Morning fog can also contribute to particulate pollution.
Emissions of sulfur oxide gases mix with water droplets in air
to form sulfate particulate. By afternoon, the droplets have evaporated
but the particulates remain in the atmosphere.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>A reddish-brown colored haze is another telltale sign of man-made
pollution. Nitrogen dioxide, a result of fuel combustion and photochemical
reactions, absorbs the blue portion of the light spectrum, leaving
a reddish-brown tint on the horizon.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>This visible form of pollution has diminished as air quality
programs have reduced nitrogen oxide emissions. The Southland
has met the federal standard for nitrogen dioxide for the past
three years.</TT> 
<P>
<TT><U><B>How microscopic particles can wipe out a mountain</B></U></TT>

<P>
<TT>Poor visibility is primarily due to the <I>scattering</I>
of light by microscopic particles in the atmosphere. Light rays
hit a particle, bounce off and create a &quot;curtain&quot; of
haze that obstructs visibility.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>To a lesser degree, <I>absorption</I> of light by dark-colored
particles also reduces visibility.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Particles of the same size as the wavelength of visible light
-- about 0.4 to 0.7 microns -- are most efficient at scattering
light. A considerable portion of particulate pollution falls within
that range, and therefore is ideally suited to obliterating vistas.</TT>

<P>
<TT>Black carbon particles, such as those from diesel exhaust,
absorb light. If a great enough concentration of particles is
present, they will darken the sky. This may have been the cause
of the &quot;daylight dimout&quot; on Sept. 8, 1943, a day of
heavy smoke and eye-stinging pollution reported by the <I>Los
Angeles Times</I>.</TT> 
<P>
<TT><U><B>How visibility is measured</B></U></TT> 
<P>
<TT>Until the early 1970s, AQMD officials measured visibility
by standing on the roofs of air quality monitoring stations and
comparing the furthest visible object with photographs of landmarks
of known distance. On the worst days, pollution would drive visibility
to less than one-half mile.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>AQMD now uses an instrument called a nephelometer to measure
visibility. The nephelometer draws in an air sample and measures
the amount of light scattering. Visibility is calculated from
that measurement.</TT> 
<P>
<TT><U><B>Bad for health, too</B></U></TT> 
<P>
<TT>As bad as particulate pollution is for visibility, it has
an even worse effect on human health. Numerous studies have linked
particulate pollution to an increased number of emergency room
visits, asthma attacks and premature deaths.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Recent research also indicates that residents in the most
polluted areas of the United States -- including Southern California
-- could lose as much as one to three years of their life span
due to particulate pollution.</TT> 
<P>
<TT><U><B>Prognosis for future views</B></U></TT> 
<P>
<TT>Visibility in the region has gradually improved due to air
pollution controls. The three-year average of the number of days
when visibility was greater than 10 miles in Ontario increased
by 14% from 99 days in 1976-1978 to 113 days in 1988-1990.</TT>

<P>
<TT>By 2010, when all air quality standards are projected to be
met, residents will enjoy clear views more frequently.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>In Long Beach, visibility is expected to increase from an
average of about 10 miles today to 25 miles in 2010. That is the
typical visibility now experienced in non-polluted areas of the
California coast.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Visibility will improve most dramatically in the inland valleys.
In the San Bernardino-Riverside area, the average visual range
will increase from less than nine miles today to nearly 25 miles
in 2010.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>Stunning, 90-mile views of downtown Los Angeles from the San
Bernardino Mountains, or San Gorgonio Peak from Los Angeles International
Airport -- now glimpsed rarely in winter or when strong winds
whip pollution away -- will become more common.</TT> 
<P>
<TT>On those days, residents will see the tangible evidence of
the success of the region's air quality programs.</TT>

<H1>$6 million in purchase incentives</H1>

<P>
<B>&quot;QUICK CHARGE&quot; PROJECT BOLSTERS STATE'S ELECTRIC
VEHICLE MANDATE</B> 
<P>
Air quality officials approved a $6 million incentive program
Friday to make electric vehicles more affordable for Southland
motorists. 
<P>
The first-ever incentive plan would offer a $5,000 discount
starting in 1996 for motorists purchasing an electric vehicle.
The program is expected to cover up to 1,200 vehicles. 
<P>
The &quot;Quick Charge&quot; incentive plan is the keystone
of a $25 million, two-year program to encourage the development
of electric and alternative fueled vehicles, approved unanimously
by the South Coast Air Quality Management District's Governing
Board. 
<P>
The projects will be funded by a portion of a $4 annual motor
vehicle registration fee that has supported programs to reduce
vehicular air pollution since 1990. 
<P>
&quot;This program will help tip the scales toward greater
acceptance and commercialization of electric vehicles,&quot; said
John Longville, mayor of Rialto and chairman of the Mobile Source
Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee, the independent group
that recommended the incentive program to AQMD's board. 
<P>
&quot;It will also give electric vehicles a foot in the door
toward the 1998 mandate requiring that 2% of passenger vehicles
sold in the state have zero emissions,&quot; he said. 
<P>
The Quick Charge program was designed -- with suggestions
from manufacturers -- to introduce a small number of electric
vehicles into the marketplace to gauge consumer acceptance, train
service personnel and resolve any barriers to full commercialization.

<P>
Since passenger electric vehicles for this program must sell
for less than $32,000, consumers would pay less than $27,000 with
the discount, AQMD officials said. Consumers can also receive
up to $5,000 in state and federal tax incentives for purchasing
an electric vehicle. 
<P>
Unlike a rebate, which is taxable, consumers would get a $5,000
tax-free discount from the vehicle's sticker price. 
<P>
Funds for the incentive program will be available starting
July 1, 1996. Several manufacturers are expected to start selling
electric vehicles for the program as early as fall of 1996.

<P>
&quot;Southern California cannot conquer its formidable air
pollution problem without zero-emission vehicles,&quot; Longville
said. &quot;This program could give electric vehicles the extra
push needed to ensure the state's zero-emission vehicle mandate.&quot;

<P>
Aside from knocking a major dent in smog, a 1993 University
of Southern California study estimated that the state's zero-emission
vehicle regulations could foster an electric vehicle industry
and create 24,000 jobs in the region by 2003. 
<P>
To be eligible for the program, auto manufacturers must apply
to AQMD and provide: 
<P>
_ A base price, including batteries and battery charger, under
$32,000; 
<P>
_ Evidence that the vehicle meets all Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standards; and 
<P>
_ Servicing networks for the vehicles. 
<P>
Electric vehicle experts at AQMD and other agencies would
review manufacturers' applications to ensure that vehicles meet
the program's strict technical and consumer requirements.

<P>
Once a manufacturer is approved, it would be reimbursed $5,000
per vehicle following actual vehicle sales within AQMD's boundaries.

<P>
Full-size electric vans and buses are not expected to qualify
for the Quick Charge program since they will probably sell for
more than $32,000. They could qualify for other programs approved
by AQMD's board on Friday. 
<P>
To complement the $6 million incentive program, AQMD's board
approved the Mobile Source Review Committee's proposal for an
additional $1 million to encourage the development of electric
vehicle &quot;corridors&quot;. 
<P>
Groups of three or more clustered cities along designated
corridors can apply for matching funds to help develop electric
vehicle infrastructure. Cities would be required to streamline
the permit process for home charging systems and to stipulate
that builders install electric vehicle charging equipment in new
residential and commercial development. 
<P>
Designated corridors include Interstate 10 from Redlands to
Santa Monica, Interstate 405 from Sherman Oaks to Mission Viejo
and Interstates 215 and 91 from Riverside to Gardena. The corridors
were chosen because they include major shopping and entertainment
centers, airports and commuter train stations where public electric
vehicle charging stations are expected to be made available.

<P>
AQMD's board also approved $18 million Friday for purchasing
electric or alternative fuel school and transit buses, establishing
public transportation between homes and commuter rail lines and
other projects aimed at reducing mobile source pollution. (See
following table for details.) 
<P>
Organizations interested in obtaining funding for those projects
will submit proposals in a competitive bid process this fall.
AQMD's board will begin awarding contracts in December. 
<P>
All of the projects are co-funded by 30% of an annual $4 motor
vehicle registration fee established in 1990 by state Assembly
Bill 2766. The remainder is split among AQMD and local governments.
All of the money is earmarked for programs to reduce air pollution
from vehicles. 
<P>
Each year, the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review
Committee recommends projects to be funded to AQMD's board. The
eight-member review committee is composed of representatives from
transportation, air quality and regional planning agencies in
AQMD's jurisdiction: Los Angeles and Orange counties and portions
of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.

<P>As summer temperatures soar, driving Southland residents to the mountains or beach, ozone smog levels also will rise to uncomfortable and unhealthful levels.</P>
<P>Air quality this spring has been worse than the same time last year due to hot, stagnant weather during May and early June.</P>
<P>There have already been two Stage 1 episode days this year, both of which occurred on one weekend in mid-May.  During Stage 1 episodes, air quality is considered very unhealthful and everyone is advised to avoid vigorous outdoor exercise.</P>
<P>This spring's weather was so conducive to smog formation that Southland residents could have experienced even more Stage 1 episodes, if it weren't for air pollution control programs.</P>
<P>On the plus side, cleaner-burning gasoline, required in California starting this spring, will significantly reduce smog-forming emissions and benefit air quality this summer.</P>
<P>Even though this spring was somewhat smoggier than last year, residents will breathe much cleaner air than they did 20 years ago, thanks to a half century of smog fighting.</P>
<P>To appreciate how far we've come in the fight against smog, it helps to take a look at the history of air pollution control.</P>
<A NAME="Beginning"></A><P><B>In the beginning</B></P>
<P>On Sept. 8, 1943, the Los Angeles Times reported that eye-smarting smog -- thought to emanate from a synthetic rubber plant -- was so thick that it caused a &quot;daylight dim-out.&quot;</P>
<P>As World War II progressed, smog in the Los Angeles area worsened, prompting school closures, protest marches on city hall, grand jury investigations and calls for the Governor to declare a state of emergency.</P>
<P>More than 50 years later, smog in Southern California has improved markedly, even though the population has nearly tripled and the number of vehicles has increased more than fourfold since then.</P>
<P>In 1955, peak ozone levels reached .68 parts per million (ppm) -- well above California's Stage 3 episode level, when everyone is advised to remain indoors and minimize physical activity.  Such episodes ended in the 1960s.  The last Stage 2 episode -- a lower but still serious pollution level -- occurred in 1988.</P>
<P>Air pollution controls have reduced the number of Stage 1 episodes, when ozone reaches .20 ppm, from 121 days in 1977 to 14 last year. (At .15 ppm, a Health Advisory is declared and healthy adults and children are advised to avoid <I>prolonged</I>, vigorous outdoor exercise.)</P>
<P>Another indicator of progress is the annual maximum ozone level, which was .26 ppm in 1995 -- considerably less than half the peak of 40 years ago.</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="julgraf1.gif" WIDTH = 587 HEIGHT = 323 ALT="Undisplayed Graphic"></P>
<P>Even so, Southern California residents still breathe unhealthful levels of pollution an average of two out of every five days. In 1995, for instance, there were 98 days over the federal health standard of .12 ppm for ozone.  In addition, the area routinely has unhealthful levels of fine particle pollution and carbon monoxide.</P>
<P>What has been done to clean up smog in the last half-century?  While continued work is necessary for residents to breathe healthful air and see the mountains on a clear day, a glance at history shows that much has already been done.</P>
<A NAME="Pioneer"></A><P><B><U>Pioneering smog-control efforts</U></B></P>
<P>Los Angeles County officials adopted Southern California's first modern pollution control measure in February 1945, when they prohibited factories from emitting dark smoke.  By late 1950, the two-year-old Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District banned garbage burning in all 54 dumps in the county.  In 1958, air quality officials banned the burning of trash in backyard incinerators.</P>
<P>But smoke was not the sole problem.  In the late 1940s, meteorologists began to realize that Southern California's balmy climate also helped make it the smog capital of the nation.  If it weren't for summertime atmospheric inversions, where warmer desert air traps cooler ocean air close to the ground, temperatures in Los Angeles could match those in Palm Springs.</P>
<P>The same inversions -- together with three mountain ranges defining the Los Angeles basin -- trap pollutants close to the ground in the very places where millions live and breathe.</P>
<P>In the early 1950s, scientists began to crack the chemical code of smog -- an essential step in its prevention.  They knew that ozone, one of the principal and most hazardous ingredients of smog, was not emitted directly from auto tailpipes and smokestacks.  They also noticed that ozone levels were highest during daytime.  They soon discovered that Southern California's abundant sunshine was the essential catalyst that converted raw pollutants from homes, autos and industry into ozone.</P>
<P>Today, atmospheric chemists are still unraveling the many complex reactions that result when pollutants mix in the atmosphere, forming new compounds -- many of which are more hazardous than the original pollutants.</P>
<A NAME="health"></A><P><B>Smog is hazardous to your health</B></P>
<P>In the 1960s, concern grew that smog caused not only acute health effects, such as burning of the eyes and throat, but that it might also increase the risk of diseases, such as emphysema and cancer.</P>
<P>Hundreds of health studies conducted since then have borne out that concern.  Among the conclusions:</P>
<P>&#149; Particulate pollution is responsible for as many as 8,800 premature deaths a year in Southern California  and up to 64,000 deaths nationwide, according to a 1996 study by the Natural Resources Defense Council.  In both cases, that is more than the annual number of traffic fatalities.</P>
<P>&#149; In 1991, epidemiologist David Abbey of Loma Linda University in Loma Linda, Calif., concluded a long-term study of 6,340 Seventh Day Adventists living in and out of smoggy areas.  Seventh Day Adventists were recruited for the study because they abstain from alcohol and tobacco.  Abbey found that those who live in smoggy regions such as the metropolitan Los Angeles area suffer a 33% increased risk of bronchitis and a 74% greater risk of asthma.  Women living in smoggy areas have a 37% greater chance of developing some form of cancer.</P>
<P>&#149; Fine particulate pollution -- even at levels below the federal health standard -- can shorten lifespans by two years, according to a 16-year study by Harvard University researchers. In a study of 8,111 residents of six U.S. cities, particle pollution was strongly associated with excess deaths from lung cancer and heart disease -- even when other lifestyle risks such as cigarette smoking were factored out.  The six cities studied -- Watertown, Mass., Kingston-Harriman, Tenn., St. Louis, Mo., Steubenville, Ohio, Portage, Wis. and Topeka, Kan. -- all have particulate levels below the federal health standard.  In contrast, the Los Angeles metropolitan region is among the worst areas for particulate pollution in the nation, with levels nearly twice the federal health standard.</P>
<P>&#149; A study by C. Arden Pope III, Ph.D., of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, found that particulate pollution reduces average life expectancy by one to three years in some of the most polluted cities in the United States.</P>
<P>&#149; In 1987, Drs. Russell Sherwin and Valda Richters of the University of Southern California examined the health of 152 young people, between the ages of 15 and 25, who died suddenly from accidents or homicide. In lung autopsies of over 100 of the subjects, slight lung airspace inflammation was found in 75% of the group, with severe damage in 27%.  While no evidence has been found to determine the levels of smoking or other contributing factors that could have affected their health, these youths appear to have provided the first positive proof of health damage from long-term exposure to poor air quality.</P>
<P>&#149; Athletes may be relatively young, healthy, physically fit and nonsmokers, but they may be among the most vulnerable to the effects of inhaled ozone (and other environmental pollutants), according to Dr. Henry Gong of the University of California, Los Angeles. Endurance studies suggest that athletic performance may begin to suffer at the .12 ppm level of ozone (the federal health standard), with significantly decreased performance likely at .20 ppm for most athletes exercising heavily for one or more hours.</P>
<P>&#149; A 1989 study by Jane Hall, an economist at California State University, Fullerton, found that cleaning up just two pollutants in the metropolitan Los Angeles area would reap $9.4 billion a year in health benefits.</P>
<A NAME="Emissions"></A><P><B>Where does all this smog come from, anyway?</B></P>
<P>During the early years of air pollution control, residents and officials were quick to blame specific industrial plants as major contributors or even the entire cause of Southern California's pollution.</P>
<P>Such sentiment prompted officials at a Los Angeles rubber factory to temporarily close it in 1943.  But smog persisted.  Researchers later showed that motor vehicle emissions caused as much or more pollution than industry.</P>
<P>Today, cars, trucks and buses are responsible for 56% of VOC emissions and 68% of nitrogen oxide pollution.  The two pollutants combine in sunlight to form ozone.</P>
<P>Small businesses, homes and consumer products -- from nail polish to floor wax -- contribute 28% of VOC emissions and 5% of nitrogen oxide pollution.</P>
<P>Large industries are responsible for 7% of VOC emissions and 7% of nitrogen oxides.  Planes, trains, ships and construction equipment are responsible for the remaining 9% of VOC emissions and 20% of nitrogen oxide emissions.</P>

<A NAME="50-year war on smog"></A><P><B>50-year war on smog</B></P>
<P>Beginning in 1945, air quality officials started cutting smog by attacking the biggest and most obvious sources.</P>
<P>The banning of garbage burning in landfills and backyards along with curtailing smoke from heavy industries cut particulate pollution by nearly 800 tons per year <I>in each square mile</I>, according to a 1964 <I>Scientific American</I> article by A.J. Haagen-Smit, an early pioneer in air pollution chemistry.</P>
<P>Starting in 1963, auto engine &quot;blowby&quot; devices were required in new cars to capture hundreds of tons of engine exhaust gases that used to be vented from the crankcase to the air.</P>
<P>Catalytic converters became mandatory in 1975 to remove even more vehicle exhaust pollution.  Today's new cars are 10 times cleaner than those built in 1970.</P>
<P>Air quality control programs cut tens of thousands of tons of smog in the 1950s and 1960s, and exhausted all of the simple solutions.  Growth somewhat offset these gains.</P>
<P>In response, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the agency responsible for cleaning up smog in the metropolitan Los Angeles area, now seeks to reduce pollution from all sources, even those once considered insignificant.</P>
<P>State law generally limits the AQMD's jurisdiction to stationary sources such as businesses, and area sources such as some consumer products.  The California Air Resources Board is charged with primary responsibility for controlling emissions from mobile sources.</P>
<A NAME="Fostering clean technologies"></A><P><B>Fostering clean air technologies</B></P>
<P>AQMD's cleanup strategy relies heavily on developing new technologies to reduce pollution or create fewer emissions in the first place.  Water-based paints, for example, have less smog-forming volatile organic compounds (VOCs) than petroleum-based coatings.  By working with industries to find cleaner technologies, industry can reduce emissions without reducing productivity, and even expand.</P>
<P>AQMD formed its Technology Advancement Office in 1988 to foster the development of such clean technologies.  Funded primarily by vehicle registration fees, the technology office has co-sponsored more than 250 projects, including:</P>
<P>&#149; Demonstration this year of a fuel cell-powered pollution-free transit bus.  The 60-passenger electric bus is powered by a 275-horsepower fuel cell -- the same amount of power provided by a standard diesel bus engine -- except the fuel cell emits only warm water vapor.  Fuel cells, historically used in spacecraft, chemically convert hydrogen and oxygen to electricity and offer great promise as a pollution-free power source for down-to-earth vehicles.</P>
<P>&#149; A demonstration of wet cleaning, a commercial cleaning process that uses water instead of chemicals to clean everything from wool sweaters to silk blouses.  Almost all dry cleaners now use perchloroethylene, or &quot;perc,&quot; a potentially toxic cleaning agent that pollutes the air and can contaminate groundwater.  Wet cleaning offers the promise of cutting air pollution, reducing consumers' personal exposure to potentially toxic chemicals and even saving money for commercial cleaners.</P>
<P>&#149; Funding of a project to build eight totally pollution-free automobiles that run on hydrogen produced by sunlight and wind.  Five utility carts and three &quot;neighborhood vehicles&quot; -- narrow, two-seater cars -- will run on hydrogen produced by a solar photovoltaic array and a wind turbine near Palm Desert.  Unlike electric vehicles, which may be associated with a small amount of air pollution from the power plants that charge them, these vehicles will truly have zero emissions from cradle to grave.</P>
<P>&#149; Co-sponsorship of the development of a liquid natural gas-powered locomotive to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution, an ingredient in ozone smog.  Diesel locomotives currently are not subject to any emission standards and emit an estimated 32 tons per day of NOx in the Los Angeles area.  Liquid natural gas-powered locomotives have the potential to reduce NOx emissions by 80%.  Project plans call for the first liquid natural gas-powered locomotive to be used in regular service next year on Metrolink, Southern California's commuter rail network.</P>
<A NAME="Forcing technology"></A><P><B>&quot;Forcing&quot; new technology</B></P>
<P>AQMD also has used its regulations to spur development of clean technologies.</P>
<P>Backyard barbecues may seem like a small and innocuous source of pollution.  The problem wasn't the smoke; it was the invisible VOC fumes that evaporated from barbecue starter products and helped form smog.  Those products emitted up to four tons of VOCs a day -- as much as is emitted by Southern California's largest oil refinery.</P>
<P>When AQMD's Governing Board adopted a rule in October 1990 requiring a 50% cut in VOC emissions from starter products, manufacturers said it couldn't be done.  Starter fluid with a lower VOC content wouldn't light a barbecue, they said.  Just 18 months later, manufacturers had developed more than two dozen barbecue starter products that met AQMD's emissions rule -- including some lighter fluids that were well under the limit.</P>
<A NAME="Where from here?"></A><P><B>Where do we go from here?</B></P>
<P>As Southern California continues to emerge from its worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s, air quality officials are committed to become more sensitive than ever to the cost of regulations.  AQMD conducts rigorous socioeconomic impact studies for each rule it proposes, and hosts numerous public meetings seeking input from businesses that will be affected by anti-pollution measures.</P>
<P>At the same time, AQMD is required by the federal and California Clean Air Acts to achieve healthful air by 2010.  That will mean cutting current emissions -- which have already been sharply curtailed in the last 50 years -- even more.</P>
<A NAME="Market incentives"></A><P><B>Market incentives</B></P>
<P>One promising strategy is to harness market forces.  In October 1993 AQMD's Governing Board adopted RECLAIM, the world's first multi-pollutant emissions trading program.</P>
<P>Under RECLAIM, short for the REgional CLean Air Incentives Market, about 350 major facilities reduce their emissions by a prescribed amount each year.  If a firm exceeds its annual goal for pollution reduction, it will earn emission credits that can be sold on the open market.  Some industries can reduce emissions more easily and at a lower cost than others.  In this way, RECLAIM will harness the profit motive to reduce emissions in the most cost-effective manner -- saving firms a projected $58 million a year.</P>
<P>By 2003, RECLAIM will have reduced nitrogen oxide emissions by 77 tons a year and sulfur oxide emissions by 16 tons a year.</P>
<P>A recent audit of RECLAIM activity during the first 18 months of the program concluded that emissions trading is successful and that the program is on track in accomplishing air quality objectives.</P>
<P>Since RECLAIM began in January 1994, participating firms have traded more than 100,000 tons of nitrogen and sulfur oxide emissions for more than $10 million.</P>

<P>AQMD now is significantly expanding its market incentive programs by developing an intercredit trading program known as the Clean Air Credit Exchange, with adoption anticipated by year's end.</P>
<P>Under this new proposed system, businesses would have three options for meeting smog control requirements:  1) reduce their own pollution; 2) buy credits from sources of pollution that reduce emissions beyond required levels, or 3) in lieu of reducing their own emissions, pay into a Clean Air Trust Fund to be used for clean up projects.</P>
<P>The trading market would enable businesses to develop credits through such diverse options as scrapping older polluting cars and lawn mowers, converting equipment and vehicles to clean fuels, or selling clean consumer products, such as pollution free paints.</P>
<P>Possible sources of pollution credits would encompass more than 30,000 businesses; 10 million motor vehicles; ships, trains and planes; and a vast array of products used by the region's 14 million people.</P>
<P>AQMD would use the Clean Air Trust Fund to pay for clean up projects, including public transit, conversion of vehicles and equipment to cleaner fuels and others that would reduce pollution in the Southern California region.</P>
<P>In conjunction with the new credit market and clean air fund, AQMD will develop regulations to further reduce pollution from specific industries.</P>
<A NAME="Business opportunities"></A><P><B>Clean Air Business Opportunities</B></P>
<P>Southern California traditionally has been viewed as a world leader in controlling air pollution.  As cities across the nation and around the world clean up their smog, Southern California could reap billions of dollars in trade by developing new pollution control systems and clean, alternative transportation.</P>
<P>In turn, Southern California residents would enjoy not only abundant sunshine, but plentiful and healthy air.</P>

<P>
 In Southern California, that old line connotes more than hocus-pocus
acts of disappearance and reappearance by a Hollywood vaudeville
magician.  For us, a different kind of alchemy is at work, affecting
the very air our region's 14 million residents breathe.
<P>
 A complex atmospheric chemistry has made Southern California
residents accustomed to objects that &quot;disappear&quot; and
&quot;reappear&quot; on a daily basis.  Residents know these atmospheric
reactions work on a grand scale, causing major landmarks, even
entire mountain ranges, to vanish.
<P>
 Behind the vanishing act is the region's air pollution, formed
by gases, vapors and particles emitted mostly by the contraptions
and potions of the industrial age.
<P>
 Our densely populated basin, ringed by mountains and often capped
by an inversion layer of hot, dry desert air atop cooler, moister
marine air, is a natural atmospheric repository for any substance
blown by the wind or puffed up from fires, industries and other
sources.
<P>
 This results in a hazy marine layer--a soupy mix which consists
both of invisible gases and small particles that hang suspended
in the air.
<P>
 Some of these particles are emitted directly into the air, such
as diesel soot, soil dust, smoke from fireplaces and cooking,
and asbestos material and rubber particles from brakes and tires
on the region's 10 million motor vehicles.  Other particles form
in the air from gases emitted by burning fossil fuel.
<P>
 Together, they form the cloud of particulate matter that causes
the mountains and other landmarks to regularly disappear into
a haze of gray.  Then when the inversion layer dissipates, the
particulate matter is carried away, revealing glorious vistas
as our mountains and skyline &quot;reappear.&quot;
<P>
 It is often this particulate pollution that people see when they
experience smog in Southern California.  And it is more than an
aesthetic problem.
<P>
 A mounting body of scientific evidence points to particulates
as the most unhealthful component of the region's air pollution
problem.  Moreover, long-term monitoring shows that while levels
of ozone, carbon monoxide and other pollutants are falling, progress
on cutting particulate pollution has been less clear cut.
<P>
 Pressure to reduce particulates is growing, however.  The federal
Clean Air Act sets 1996 as the year the region must come to grips
with this form of pollution and develop a firm plan to finally
clean it up by 2006.  That plan, being developed now, will be
based upon one of the most intensive scientific studies of the
problem ever conducted.  The study results are due early this
summer.
<P>
 Here's a rundown on the health effects of the source of, and
possible solutions to the serious problem of particulate pollution.
<P>

<P>
<B><H3>The Nature of Particulate Pollution</H3></B>

<P>
 Particulates in the air are not of uniform size or chemical composition,
which are determined by the sources of pollution within an airshed.
<P>
 In the South Coast Air Basin, which encompasses the urbanized
portions of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino
counties, particle pollution comes in a wide variety of compounds
and sizes.  Sea salt, blowing soil, road dust, soot and smoke,
pollen, nitrate and sulfate from industries are just a few of
the substances.
<P>
 Much of the particulate is big enough to not be a health concern.
 The nasal passages and upper respiratory tract provide the first
line of defense to protect the lungs from airborne particles.
 The body's  natural filtering and self-cleansing mechanisms catch
larger particles before they can invade deep into the lungs.
<P>
 But particles that are 10 microns or less in diameter -- known
by environmental scientists as &quot;PM10&quot; -- are of greatest
concern.  These microscopic-sized particles are so small they
are not filtered out by the human respiratory system's natural
defenses.  They can penetrate deep into the lungs where they can
become trapped and cause serious health problems.
<P>
 Studies associating these small particles with ill health led
the federal Environmental Protection Agency in 1987 to set new
standards.  These new health standards for PM10 superseded EPA's
former standard, which targeted total suspended particulate, including
the larger particles.
<P>
 EPA's standards established two health limits.  First, that the
annual average level of PM10 should not exceed 50 micrograms per
cubic meter of air.  Second, that PM10 should not exceed a concentration
of 150 micrograms per cubic meter of air averaged over any 24-hour
period.
<P>
 Readings taken in the South Coast Air Basin since 1985 show that
the area regularly exceeds both of these standards.  In 1995,
for instance, numerous air monitoring stations recorded an exceedance
of both the annual average and the 24-hour average standards.
 These exceedances occurred primarily in the inland area which
is downwind of the vast majority of emissions sources.
<P>
 In Riverside County, three air monitoring stations (one in Norco/Corona
and two in metropolitan Riverside) recorded exceedances of the
federal annual average standard with averages of 54.2 and 69 micrograms
per cubic meter of air.  Metropolitan Riverside also had one day
exceeding the federal 24-hour standard, with a peak reading of
219 micrograms per cubic meter of air.
<P>
 In San Bernardino County, stations in the southwest and central
San Bernardino Valley exceeded the federal annual standard with
readings of 54 and 61 micrograms per cubic meter.
<P>
 Virtually all urban monitoring stations have recorded exceedances
of California's tighter annual average standard of 30 micrograms
per cubic meter of air and 24-hour standard of 50 micrograms per
cubic meter of air.
<P>
 As PM10 levels exceed the state 24-hour standard and approach
the federal 24-hour standard, visibility diminishes rapidly. 
That's because the particles, though individually invisible to
the eye, create a haze by reflecting and scattering sunlight.
<P>

<B><H3>Health Effects of PM10</H3></B>

<P>
 All pollution, including particulates, have long been known to
cause respiratory ailments.  In 1930, 63 people in Belgium's Meuse
Valley died after a five-day siege of air pollution that gathered
like a fog.  In 1948, some 7,000 people in Donora, Penn., became
acutely ill during a period of extreme air stagnation.  In London,
5,000 died in three separate episodes in 1948, 1952 and 1956.
 A thick fog polluted with soot and sulfur compounds from burning
coal was deemed the culprit.
<P>
 Today, medical researchers have identified PM10 as one of the
most unhealthful components of air pollution.
<P>
 In a landmark health study that took 16 years to complete, researchers
from Harvard University found a strong association between particle
pollution and early deaths from lung cancer and heart disease
among 8,111 people studied in six cities.  Moreover, the cities
-- Watertown, Mass., Kingston-Harriman, Tenn., St. Louis, Steubenville,
Ohio, Portage, Wis., and Topeka, Kan. -- all have PM10 levels
that <I>meet</I> the federal standards today.  Nevertheless, the
researchers concluded that levels of PM10 in these cities were
diminishing life spans by up to two years.
<P>
 PM10 also increases the risk of bronchitis and makes it harder
for people to fight off pneumonia.  Increased absences from work
and school and increased hospital admissions, particularly among
asthmatics and other sufferers of chronic respiratory disease,
follow.
<P>
 A recent study just released by the Natural Resources Defense
Council estimates there are more than 64,000 premature deaths
a year in the United States due to PM10 exposure.  Here in the
South Coast Air Basin, nearly 14% of those deaths -- over 8,800
-- occur!  This is more than five times as many deaths as previously
estimated in a 1989 study done at California State University
at Fullerton.
<P>

<B><H3>Sources of PM10</H3></B>

<P>
 The primary natural sources of PM10 in the South Coast Air Basin
are the ocean, wind erosion of soil, and wildfires.
<P>
 Salt particles come from the ocean as the spray of waves evaporates,
leaving salt particles suspended in the air.  Winds in the deserts
surrounding the South Coast Air Basin blow soil dust into the
air.
<P>
 Health standards are close to being met in these areas, including
Coachella Valley, through measures that reduce disturbance of
dust caused by human activities, such as construction, farming
and driving on dirt roads.
<P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="sand.gif"><BR>
<I>Blowing dust covers car in the desert just outside the South
Coast Air Basin.</I>
</CENTER>
<P>
 In the Basin, manmade contributors to directly emitted PM10 include:
 fireplace fires, disintegrating tires and brakes, smoke from
barbecues and charbroilers used in restaurants, rock crushing
and quarry operations, vehicles traveling over dirt roads, open
burning, and many others.
<P>
 Gases -- including nitrogen and sulfur oxides and volatile organic
compounds -- are emitted by burning fossil fuel in motor vehicles,
ships, trains, airplanes, construction equipment, industrial boilers,
heaters and even home water heaters.  Volatile organic compounds
also are emitted from paints, coatings, solvents and aerosol spray
cans.  Ammonia, another gas which contributes to PM10, is emitted
by livestock waste, sewage treatment plants and other sources.
<P>
 Typically, metropolitan Riverside is the worst area for fine
particle pollution in the air basin.  Preliminary data from AQMD's
1995 study of the area's PM10 problem show that annually in Riverside
45% of PM10 is directly emitted and 55% is formed in the air from
gases.  Soil dust was the largest component of directly emitted
particulate matter.
<P>
 The analysis also shows that fine particle pollution generally
is worst in the fall, after the intense sunshine of summer passes
and before the cleansing turbulence of winter storms begins. 
Changing light in the fall alters the photochemical reactions
that take place in the air.  This effect, coupled with more stagnant
wind flows, leads to more particulate in the fall.
<P>
 The study also found that the particles in the air formed from
gases generally are much finer than many other components of PM10,
with a large portion being 2.5 microns or less in diameter.  These
particles are now thought to be a greater threat to human health
than particles between 2.5 and 10 microns in diameter.  Accordingly,
the federal EPA is considering setting a new health standard that
targets allowable levels of PM2.5.
<P>

<B><H3>Control Measures</H3></B>

<P>
 AQMD is reviewing the newest study data to determine the adequacy
of the control measures outlined in its 1994 clean air plan in
meeting federal particulate standards.  As part of its upcoming
1997 plan, AQMD will again emphasize the most cost-effective and
technically feasible approaches to reducing PM10 levels.
<P>
 The federal Clean Air Act requires AQMD to implement best available
control measures for directly emitted PM10 by December 1996 and
to develop an overall plan for achieving federal health standards
for PM10 by February 1997.  This latter requirement will be satisfied
by the upcoming 1997 plan.
<P>
 Candidate best available control measures include such things
as improved street cleaning, better control of dust at demolition
and construction sites, coating unpaved roads and parking lots
with dust suppressants, and better soil conservation practices
on farm land.
<P>
 The PM10 plan will again address combustion sources, including
measures to reduce soot and emissions of nitrogen oxides from
heavy-duty trucks and buses, ships at the ports, trains, and a
variety of other sources.  Because these transportation sources
are engaged in interstate or intrastate commerce, it largely is
up to the federal EPA and California Air Resources Board to set
any needed standards.
<P>
 These agencies, in cooperation with AQMD, are working on many
of the needed standards now.  New technologies -- being developed
through public-private partnerships in which AQMD is participating
-- ultimately will help insure these standards can be met.  Among
the emerging technologies are natural gas-powered buses and trucks,
cleaner locomotives, and electric vehicles that are now being
introduced into delivery fleets and ground service at airports.
<P>
 To the extent that EPA refocuses the fine particle pollution
standard from PM10 to PM2.5, efforts to control blowing dust could
become less critical and the need to control combustion sources
could be greater.
<P>
 The need to control ammonia emissions, which feed formation of
fine particle pollution, also will be re-evaluated.  AQMD's 1995
PM10 study indicates that ammonia emissions from Chino dairies
are lower than previously thought.  However, the ammonia does
add to the nitrogen oxide rich air from the heavily populated
west side of the air basin as it blows east toward Riverside and
San Bernardino.  Needed reductions in ammonia may be achieved
as dairies voluntarily relocate for other business reasons to
areas outside the South Coast Air Basin.  If sufficient relocations
occur, direct ammonia controls on dairies may not be necessary.
<P>

<CENTER>

<P>

<B><H3>Conclusion</H3></B>

<P>
 Particulate pollution is not just a visibility problem -- it's
a serious health problem.  The intense study of this problem over
the past year demonstrates more clearly than ever the need to
reduce the amount of particulate pollution in this region.  While
PM10 levels are declining somewhat in the South Coast Air Basin
for reasons not fully understood, still more must be done.  The
use of emerging technologies to reduce emissions of the soot and
gases that form PM10 will help.
<P>
 The need to attain health standards for particulate pollution
is becoming clearer and clearer:  it is not only to unveil our
beautiful vistas year-round -- it is to add years to our lives.

<P>
Since 1988, the South Coast Air Quality Management District has
set aside a special evening to salute those we've come
to know as Clean Air Heroes. This year on May 16 AQMD held its
Clean Air Awards ceremony to honor the "Heroes of 1996"
who have gone above and beyond the call of duty to help improve
the Southland's air pollution problem.<BR>
<P>
We are pleased to announce the following winners for AQMD's
1996 Clean Air Awards in five categories:<BR>
<UL><LI>Advancement in Air Pollution Technology,
<LI>Innovative Transportation Projects,
<LI>Community Achievements,
<LI>Citizen Promotion of Good Environmental Stewardship, or
<LI>Public Education on Air Quality Issues.
</UL><P>
The winners come from all walks of life ... individuals and governments
... companies large and small ... but in their diversity, they
all believe that clean air can be achieved in the smoggiest region
in the United States.<BR>

<P>
<B>American Honda Motor Corporation</B>
<P>
<I>Torrance</I>
<P>
<I>Low-emission vehicle technology</I>
<P>
In October 1995, the Honda Civic LEV became the first gasoline-powered
vehicle to be certified by the California Air Resources Board
and the Environmental Protection Agency as a low-emission vehicle.
It also became the first such vehicle to reach the market and
the only gasoline-powered LEV offered by any manufacturer for
the 1996 model year (as of January over 9,000 had been sold in
California). This was achieved with little cost increase, increased
horse power and substantial reductions in hydrocarbon, carbon
monoxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.<BR>
<P>
<B>Hickory Springs of California, Inc.</B>
<P>
<I>Commerce</I>
<P>
<I>CFC-free foam blowing</I>
<P>
This supplier to the furniture and bedding industries has been
a leader in the use of alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons and
methyl chloroform in foam blowing. Since 1990, Hickory Springs
has used acetone, a non-ozone-depleting substance, as an auxiliary
blowing agent (ABA). Because acetone is more efficient than other
ABAs, the switch has also resulted in reductions in total pounds
of emissions at the Commerce facility. The company was one of
the leading furniture manufacturers to get acetone declassified
by federal regulators as a volatile organic compound.<BR>
<P>
<B>Surface Protection Industries</B>
<P>
<I>Los Angeles</I>
<P>
<I>Low-polluting, multicolor coatings</I>
<P>
For several years, SPI has been a leader in converting both solvent-based,
high volatile organic chemical (VOC) architectural and industrial
coatings to low-VOC, water-based products, with particular emphasis
on multicolor coatings. SPI's water-based multicolor architectural
coatings have a VOC content of roughly 100 grams per liter, substantially
less than the 420 VOC grams/liter limit established under AQMD
Rule 1113. To date, the conversion from solvent-based to water-based
products has eliminated over 900,000 pounds of VOC.<BR>

<P>
<B>City of Torrance</B>
<P>
<I>Alternative transportation</I>
<P>
The city has used several methods to reduce the number of vehicle
trips by employees going to and from its worksites including:
a compressed work week program involving more than 600 city employees;
a vanpool program involving compressed natural gas vehicles; a
child care center in which 20 percent of the parents are car-poolers;
a transportation network involving the city and 30 local businesses;
the operation of an electric bus between various city restaurants,
stores, banks, post offices and medical facilities. Since 1989,
the City of Torrance has increased its average vehicle ridership
from 1.10 to 1.51<BR>
<P>
<B>Super Shuttle </B>
<P>
<I>Torrance</I>
<P>
<I>Alternative fuels</I>
<P>
Since 1990, the Torrance-based airport shuttle service has courageously
invested its own capital and labor in its commitment to alternative
fuels. Super Shuttle currently operates 90 shuttle vans on compressed
natural gas throughout the South Coast Air Basin and has plans
to add another 30 CNG vans to its fleet. Super Shuttle, whose
CNG vans travel between 100,000 to 150,000 miles per year on 24-hour
operation, has achieved an average reduction of 10,000 pounds
of volatile organic compounds and 9,800 pounds of nitrogen oxide
emissions per year. It also has made available to the public a
number of CNG fueling stations throughout the area.<BR>

<P>
<B>Coates Screen, Inc.</B>
<P>
<I>Ontario</I>
<P>
<I>Low-VOC inks</I>
<P>
Coates Screen Inc. developed an environmental philosophy that
was incorporated into its charter, pledging to allow no economic
priority to overrule considerations of health and safety at work
and respect for the environment. At the same time, Coates achieved
emission reductions of 0.3 lbs./day by converting its customer
base to low-VOC technology. In cases where the company does not
have cleaner ink Coates quickly acknowledges competitors who have
compliant technology. In other cases, Coates simply refuses to
sell non-compliant inks because of its conviction that compliant
inks can do the job. The attitude of health first makes Coates
an outstanding community achiever.<BR>
<P>
<B>City of Lancaster</B>
<P>
<I>Blue Sky Project</I>
<P>
In 1994, the Lancaster City Council developed an energy management
program that includes a clean fuel vehicle policy, resulting in
the conversion of 30 percent of its fleet vehicles to electricity,
methanol and compressed natural gas; the installation of six electric
charging stations; and transit and bicycle programs. The city
also has established a recycling market development zone.<BR>
<P>
<B>Montclair TransCenter Child Care Center</B>
<P>
<I>Commuter trip reduction</I>
<P>
Located at the City of Montclair's multimodal transportation center,
this facility encourages working parents to use alternative modes
of transportation. The Riverside County Child Care Consortium
developed the concept, obtained AB2766 funding and administered
the project; the City of Montclair prepared the site and surrounding
infrastructure; the San Bernardino Associated Governments acted
as a partner and facilitator to the project; the Riverside County
Office of Education provided technical expertise and administrative
oversight for the construction of the center; and Children's Discovery
Centers furnished the center and has maintained daily operational
responsibilities. The center has enabled parents to reduce their
daily driving by an average of five miles per vehicle, resulting
in a reduction of 52,500 miles driven per year with estimated
emissions reduction benefits of 2,166 pounds of vehicle pollutants.

ARB developed two outreach programs for children in 1996: The
Air Quality Curriculum Compendium, a program that provides environmental
classroom materials, teacher training workshops and curriculum
development to help meet contemporary education standards; and
a joint venture with McDonald's Corporation involving the distribution
of 4.5 million paper tray liners containing clean-air messages.
The effort was the largest single public outreach distribution
in ARB's 25-year history and resulted in responses from educators
requesting additional information for their classrooms in the

This entrepreneur has dedicated her career to studying and demonstrating
the application of new environmental concepts to business, specifically
promoting the use of wet cleaning technology, a procedure that
provides an alternative to the use of perchloroethylene, a toxic
air contaminant, in the dry-cleaning process. Last year, Davis
worked with UCLA's Pollution Prevention Education and Research
Center to develop a wet cleaning demonstration project. She pursued
grants to fund the project at the university, whose resources
were limited. In February, 1996, Deborah opened a state-of-the-art

<H2>Clean Air Lawn Care</CENTER></H2>

<P>
Spring gardening -- for some of us it is a labor of love, for
others it is required weekend drudgery -- but, for pollution fighters,
lawn and garden equipment is yet another contributor to our smog
problem.
<P>
Most of us don't think of garden equipment as causing much air
pollution, but the small engines found in lawn mowers, leaf blowers
and weed wackers are actually a significant source of smog.
<P>
The federal Environmental Protection Agency estimates there are
89 million pieces of lawn and garden equipment in the United States
with engines rated at 25 horsepower or less. There are 4.6 million
small garden engines in California, half of them gas mowers. In
Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties alone,
1.3 million lawnmowers, edgers and trimmers are used constantly
by both homeowners and commercial gardeners.
<P>
Garden equipment engines emit high levels of carbon monoxide,
volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, producing up to
5% of the nation's air pollution and a good deal more in many
metropolitan areas like Los Angeles.

<FONT SIZE=2>A conventional lawn mower pollutes as much
in an hour as 40 late model cars.</FONT><P></center> 
A typical 3.5 horsepower gas mower, for instance, can emit the same
amount of VOCs -- key precursors to smog -- in an hour as a new
car driven 340 miles, say industry experts. A recent California
Air Resources Board report shows lawnmowers statewide emit 8.28
tons of VOCs per day. To top it off, lawn and garden equipment
users inadvertently add to the problem by spilling 17 million
gallons of fuel each year while refilling their outdoor power
equipment. That's more petroleum than spilled by the Exxon Valdez
in the Gulf of Alaska.
<P>
<I><B><A NAME="no_noise">No Noise, Effortless Start </A></B></I>
<P>
So what's the solution?
<P>
Electric mowers for a start. They may be either cordless, battery-driven
models or the plug-in variety. Some new cordless models can run
for three hours between charges. They are easy to start and require
no gas, oil, tune-ups or spark plugs, making them a bargain to
maintain. In fact, the average cost of energy to power a cordless
mower is only $3 each year.
<P>
Cordless electric mowers offer another big benefit -- noise levels
about half those of their gas-powered counterparts.
<P>

<P>
On the links, zero-emission riding mowers are making it possible
for some Southland golfers to tee off earlier. Ransomes Cushman
Ryan, a Lincoln, Nebraska-based manufacturer, has developed an
emission-free, battery-powered riding mower to trim golf course
greens. The electric mower runs for up to three hours on one charge,
enough to trim 18 greens. Because they are quiet like electric
cars, course operators can run them before dawn without disturbing
neighbors. This allows avid golfers to begin play at sunrise and
local golf course business owners to improve their bottom line
with additional greens fees for that early morning use.
<P>
From September 1993 through February 1994, the South Coast Air
Quality Management District conducted emissions tests of 45 gasoline-powered
lawn mowers, while giving their owners cordless electric models
as loaners. According to AQMD technology advancement manager Mike
Bogdanoff, users praised the cordless electric units for ease
of starting, lack of smell and noise, and the convenience of not
having to handle or store oil and gasoline.

said Black &amp; Decker product manager Susan Amey.</TABLE> </I>
<P>
<I><B><A NAME="quality">Quality Cutters </A></B></I>
<P>
Solution two is to redesign the gas-powered mower.
<P>
In 1995, there were 5,984,000 walk behind power mowers sold in
the United States, according to Power Systems Research of St.
Paul, Minn. Gasoline mowers are driven by either a two-stroke
or four-stroke engine with an average strength of three to five
horsepower. Two-cycle gasoline-powered mowers are generally much
more polluting than their four-cycle counterparts. Like a car
engine, a four-cycle contains separate wells for gasoline and
lubricating oil, but the simple two-cycle engine depends on a
mixture of gas and oil to lubricate the engine -- an inherently
dirtier process.
<P>
A new gasoline engine has been developed by Ryobi America Corporation
of Anderson, South Carolina that meets the proposed 1999 California
Air Resources Board emission standards. The engine powers lawn
and garden tools, such as grass and weed trimmers.
<P>
&quot;We worked on this engine technology since the early 1990s,
when we first recognized that California air agencies were trying
to limit pollution from lawn and garden equipment, &quot; said
Frank Coots, a Ryobi spokesperson.
<P>
Ryobi's line of string trimmers and edgers, which can be found
in Home Depot and most other major home centers in California,
feature a one-horsepower, 26.2-cubic centimeter, four-cycle engine
weighing under eight pounds. It is the first four-cycle engine
compact enough for use on hand-held lawn equipment. It reduces
exhaust pollutants by 80%, according to the Air Resources Board,
compared to other engines of its size.
<P>
Ryobi Chairman Akio Urakami said, &quot;We know that some companies
are having a difficult time meeting the new CARB rules, particularly
California's Tier II emissions standards scheduled for 1999. That
is why Ryobi is licensing the technology.&quot;
<P>
<I><B><A NAME="going">Going at a Slower Clip </A></B></I>
<P>
Solution three is to turn back the clock. The push or reel mower
first originated in England in the 1830s. It was the standard
for all homeowners before rotary power mowers were introduced
after World War II.
<P>
Push mowers available today are light weight at only 16 to 30
pounds versus the 40 to 60 pound models of our grandparent's generation
and feature metal handles instead of wood. Ideal for cutting small
lawns, they are quiet, stored easily and require no fuel.
<P>
<A NAME="garden3">
<CENTER><IMG SRC="garden3.gif"><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>New, people-powered reel mowers are lightweight,
quiet and fuel free.<BR>
<I>Photograph courtesy of American Lawn Mower Company/Great States
Corporation.</FONT></CENTER> </I>
<P>
Reel lawn mowers yield greener grass because of the clean and
even cut, according to Dick Crum of Purdue University's Cooperative
Extension Service. &quot;Grass clippings should remain on the
lawn to serve as a mulch and prevent evaporation while keeping
the ground cooler,&quot; said Crum. &quot;With a reel mower, you
can leave the clippings on the lawn, which adds up to one free
application of fertilizer.&quot;
<P>
Horticulturist Joe Keyser with the Montgomery County Department
of Environmental Protection in Rockville, Md., agrees, saying
that the clippings left by these human-powered machines are good
for the lawn, eliminating bags of green waste disposal at the
local landfill.
<P>
&quot;Mulching clippings into the lawn, on average, saves 25%
to 30% of the time spent with conventional mowing,&quot; says
Keyser. &quot;Most mowing time is spent dumping clippings and
dragging around plastic bags. Returning clippings to the soil's
surface increases biological activity and helps earth worms till
the soil below the surface, supporting drainage. And mulching
saves resources and conserves water.&quot;
<P>
Since Keyser started a major grass recycling program in Beltsville,
Md., in 1994, 27,000 tons of grass has been kept from the local
waste stream and are now left on lawns. &quot;I'm a fan of gas-powered
rotary mulching mowers,&quot; added Keyser,&quot; but I think
it's crazy for anyone with a lawn less than 7,000 square feet
to cut it with anything but a push mower.&quot;
<P>
Many people must feel the same way since push or reel mowers are
again gaining popularity as an easy and environmentally sound
way to mow. According to American Lawn Mower Co./Great States
Corp. of Shelbyville, Ind., sales of push mowers have increased
135% since 1985 to over 250,000 a year today.
<P>
Another benefit of push mowers is cost. They average under $100
and they are considered safer than rotary models. <I> </I>
<P>
<I><B><A NAME="tough">Tough National Standards make the Earth
a Big Customer </A></B></I>
<P>
Environmentally sound lawn care is more than a passing eco-fad,
it is now law.
<P>
The federal Environmental Protection Agency took a tough stand
on the issue of outdoor power equipment pollution with the initiation
of national emission standards for mowers, tractors and other
gas-powered lawn and garden equipment in 1995.
<P>
EPA phase one rules required manufacturers to produce engines
about 30% cleaner for model year 1997. The EPA lawn and garden
equipment rule also provides for equipment labeling, and mandates
that manufacturers receive EPA certification before selling engines
in the United States.  
<P>
EPA expects significant emission reductions as the current fleet
of equipment is replaced by equipment with new engines. A 32%
reduction in VOC emissions and a 7% reduction in carbon monoxide
emissions from these engines is expected in the year 2020. A second
phase of regulations addressing emissions from these engines is
now under development.
<P>
<I><B><A NAME="regulations">California Sprouts Lawn Regulations
</A></B></I>
<P>
California's Air Resources Board also adopted new standards that
took effect in 1995 to reduce emissions from lawn and garden equipment.
To date, 220 engine families, including gasoline, diesel, liquid
petroleum gas and compressed natural gas-powered models have been
certified to meet the state's 1995 emission standards. </B> 
<P>
Lawn and garden equipment is considered low emitting if it uses
ARB-certified engines which meet or exceed California's even tougher
1999 and later emission standards.
<P>
Compliance with these emissions standards, says CARB, would reduce
pollution from lawn and garden equipment a full 82% for VOCs,
76% for carbon monoxide and 91% for particulates.
<P>
Thanks to current environmental controls, four-stroke engine mower
emissions have already been reduced from 42 to 12 grams per brake
horsepower hour of hydrocarbons and NOx. Emissions from trimmers,
chain saws and other two-stroke engines have been reduced from
nearly 300 to 200 grams per brake horsepower hour of hydrocarbons
for current complying equipment.
<P>
<I><B><A NAME="new_lawnmower">New Lawnmower Scrapping Program
Takes Shape </A></B></I>
<P>
On May 10, 1996, AQMD, the smog control agency serving Los Angeles,
Orange, and parts of San Bernardino and Riverside counties, will
hold a public hearing for a new proposed regulation which would
provide businesses with emissions credits for permanently replacing
polluting lawn and garden equipment with newer, cleaner versions.
<P>
Rule 1623 applies to any lawn and garden equipment for which emission
standards have been adopted by the California Air Resources Board,
including lawn mowers, edgers, trimmers, blowers, vacuums, tillers,
shredders, grinders, chainsaws and garden tractors.
<P>
The rule would enable AQMD to issue nitrogen dioxide, VOC, carbon
monoxide, and particulate matter mobile source emission reduction
credits for scrapping old lawn and garden equipment. Firms demonstrating
significant emissions reductions from scrappage
<P>
and replacement with equipment which meets or exceeds applicable
emissions standards would be eligible for credits. The credits
could be used to substitute for their own emission-reduction requirements.
The rule would set new reporting requirements and establish a
protocol for lawn mower scrapping programs, including mechanisms
for recordkeeping and documentation.
<P>
&quot;Like old vehicle buy-back programs, this rule would provide
greater flexibility for businesses to comply with air quality
regulations, &quot; according to AQMD Executive Officer James
Lents.
<P>
&quot;It will give business another good compliance option. Rule
1623 will also accelerate the early retirement of high polluting
equipment and facilitate the early introduction of a new generation
of ultra-low and zero-polluting lawn and garden technology.&quot;
<P>
The federal Clean Air Act encourages market-based approaches and
EPA has published interim guidelines on the generation of mobile
source emission reduction credits. AQMD established its first
mobile source emission reduction credit program in January 1993
with Rule 1610, which established a mechanism for the generation
of VOC and NOx credits when older, pre-1982 passenger cars and
light-duty trucks are scrapped.
<P>
Proposed Rule 1623 again provides a means to obtain credits, but
it does not dictate how a lawnmower collection or dismantling
project would be designed. It also does not address the amount
or kind of incentive people will need to turn in old equipment
-- leaving that decision up to the marketplace.
<P>
A minimum of 100 units of lawn and garden equipment must be scrapped
and replaced at one time, according to the draft rule, to generate
mobile source emission reduction credits. For commercial users
who want to scrap and replace existing equipment, no limit applies.
At the time of scrapping, engines must be rendered permanently
inoperable. The credits generated would expire two years after
being issued and are expected to be tradable for RECLAIM Trading
Credits. 
<P>
<I><B><A NAME="tips">Tips for Preventing Backyard Pollution </A></B></I>
<P>
You can also help reduce pollution by following some simple tips
with your existing equipment. EPA's Office of Mobile Sources urges
careful equipment handling and maintenance practices that make
for cleaner mowing -- including use of reformulated fuel and periodically
tuning up your gas mower. EPA Web Page URL: <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/OMSWWW/lg-tips.htm"></B>http://www.epa.gov/OMSWWW/lg-tips.htm</B></A>

<P>
<A NAME="START"></A>Southland residents saw the trend toward cleaner
air continue in 1995, but new health studies revealed that air
pollution may be more harmful than previously thought.
<P>
To continue progress and increase public health protection, the
South Coast Air Quality Management District took a number of steps
last year, including:
<UL>
<LI>Strengthening its notification process when smog levels reach
unhealthful levels;
<LI>Working with businesses to make air quality regulations more
flexible and cost-effective; and
<LI>Sponsoring several research projects to develop new clean
air technologies and to refine knowledge of where pollutants come
from and what harm they cause.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<B>The Cleanest Year on Record</B>
<P>
Southland residents endured 14 Stage 1 ozone episodes this year,
the fewest in four decades.  That's a far cry from the 121 episodes
of 1977, or even the 23 in 1994.
<P>
During Stage 1 episodes, when air quality is considered very unhealthful,
everyone is advised to avoid vigorous outdoor exercise. Pollution
control programs are eliminating about four Stage 1 ozone episodes
each year.  Even so, exceeded the more protective federal health
standard on 98 days in 1995.  That is 98 too many.
<P>
Consequently, the region has its work cut out for it to eliminate
unhealthful smog levels by 2010, as is required by federal law.
<P>
Another air quality milestone in 1995 was the achievement of the
federal health standard for nitrogen dioxide.  The pollutant appears
as a reddish-brown smear on the horizon, particularly at this
time of year, and has been shown to irritate lungs and reduce
resistance to infections.
<P>
<IMG SRC="/icon/annual-1.gif">
<P>
<B>A Better Business Climate</B>
<P>
AQMD's staff and Governing Board also broke new ground in making
air quality regulations more friendly for the region's business
in 1995.
<P>
AQMD threw out its controversial employer rideshare mandate and
replaced it with Rule 2202, a program allowing firms to chose
from a wide variety of options to reduce vehicle emissions.
<P>
The flexible approach to reducing emissions earned the district
an award from President Clinton under Project XL, a program encouraging
government excellence and leadership in regulatory reform.
<P>
AQMD's Board froze fees and spending in its '95-'96 budget and
rebated $3.1 million in fees to regulated businesses.
<P>
In March, the agency's Governing Board adopted a 12-point Business
Clean Air Partnership program.  Accomplishments to date include:
<UL>
<LI>Encouraging business expansion by wiping out an emissions
&quot;debt&quot; owed by 19,000 companies.  While eliminating
the debt will not increase air pollution, requiring its payment
would have cost the region's businesses an estimated $1.4 billion;
<LI>Establishing a one-time, six-month amnesty program for businesses
that do not have required air pollution permits;
<LI>Creating the HELP Manufacturers program to attract High Employment,
Low Pollution firms to the region; and
<LI>Continuing efforts to help individual facilities comply with
regulations at the lowest possible cost.  One example:  The Los
Angeles Unified School District will save $8.4 million in boiler
upgrades thanks to technical assistance from AQMD staff.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Milestones of 1995</B>
<P>
During 1995, AQMD staff conducted dozens of public meetings to
seek input on VOC RECLAIM, a major proposed emissions trading
program.  VOC RECLAIM is short for REgional CLean Air Market for
Volatile Organic Compounds.
<P>
Although AQMD's Governing Board subsequently decided not to further
pursue VOC RECLAIM, groundwork laid for that program -- including
a detailed technology assessment of methods available to comply
with future air quality regulations -- will form the basis of
future industry-specific and market-based rules.
<P>
Additional clean air milestones of 1995 included:
<UL>
<LI>Developing a conceptual plan for a universal emissions trading
credit that would allow trades between mobile and stationary sources
and thereby increase opportunities for emissions trading.
<LI>Co-sponsoring the Reduce Emissions and Congestion on Highways
(REACH) task force to develop market-based approaches to reduce
vehicle pollution; and
<LI>Adoption of a $6 million electric vehicle &quot;Quick Charge&quot;
program providing a $5,000 discount for motorists purchasing electric
vehicles.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Clean Air Research</B>
<P>
In May 1995, AQMD and several other agencies collected emissions
data from 39,000 vehicles at two sites in Orange County using
remote vehicle-emissions sensing equipment.  An average of 7%
of vehicles were found to be high polluters with tailpipe emissions
far exceeding state emission standards.  Of those high emitters,
about 600 cars were pulled over and inspected.
<P>
A visual inspection showed that up to 28% of the cars pulled over
had tampered emission control systems.  More than 100 of the dirtiest
vehicles were repaired, and the reduction in their emissions was
measured.
<P>
As a result, air quality officials documented for the first time
that remote sensing in conjunction with a repair program is one
of the most cost-effective means for reducing pollution.  Repair
of high emitters cost $870 to $1,730 per ton of air pollution
reduced compared to $10,000 per ton or more for some pollution
controls at manufacturing plants.
<P>
Other significant research projects initiated in 1995 included:
<UL>
<LI> An intensive air monitoring study at six sites to determine
the levels and chemical composition of particulate pollution in
the region.  Preliminary results show that particulate nitrate
and suspended dust are the two main components of particle pollution.
 Particulate nitrates are formed in the atmosphere by chemical
reactions involving emissions of nitrogen oxides -- from combustion
sources such as cars and industrial boilers -- and ammonia, primarily
from livestock operations, sewage treatment plants and composting
operations.
<LI> Continued development of a 60-passenger pollution-free transit
bus.  The vehicle is powered by a fuel cell that delivers the
equivalent of 275-horsepower -- as much as a standard diesel bus
engine.  The new bus, developed with $1 million from AQMD and
$3.7 million from other organizations, will be demonstrated in
Los Angeles and several other North American cities.
<LI> Development of eight fuel cell-powered electric vehicles
to be used in the Palm Desert area.  Hydrogen for the fuel cells
will be generated by wind and solar power resulting in a truly
zero-emissions transportation mode; and
<LI> Initiation of two studies on the health effects of ozone and
particulate pollution.  One will focus on the comparative health
effects of manmade vs. natural particle pollution in the Coachella
Valley, while the other will look into the relationship between
hospital admissions and daily levels of ozone and particulate
pollution across the Southland.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Public Awareness Boosted</B>
<P>
As a result of studies indicating that even low levels of pollution
can be harmful, AQMD enhanced its program notifying schools and
the public of unhealthful smog levels.
<P>
Until last year, AQMD notified only public schools of high smog
levels.  AQMD now also calls on the region's 1,500 private schools
and thousands of preschools and day care centers to heed air pollution
forecasts.
<P>
AQMD officials also worked with teachers, the American Lung Association
and others to develop more specific recommendations for faculty,
coaches and day care center workers on when to curtail children's'
outdoor activities.  Children are among those most susceptible
to smog's harmful health effects.
<P>
Other public awareness initiatives in 1995 included:
<UL>
<LI>The debut of AQMD's on-line computer &quot;home page&quot;
on the Internet's World Wide Web.  The home page provides up-to-date
information on daily air pollution levels, proposed and adopted
rules and more;
<LI>The first public meetings required under the state's Toxic
Hot Spots program to inform residents of potential health risks
from nearby facilities;
<LI>A health effects symposium highlighting important research
findings; and
<LI>Promotion of the Cut Smog program, aimed at cleaning up smoking
vehicles, through billboards along Southland freeways.  Signs
depicting smoking vehicles urged motorists to &quot;Report This
Crime&quot;  by calling AQMD's 1-800-CUT-SMOG hotline.  As a result,
calls to the hotline doubled and the program, founded in 1988,
passed its one-million-caller mark.

<B>New Health Studies</B>
<P>
Research on the health effects of air pollution reported in 1995
confirmed or added to already extensive evidence that smog is
harmful to human health.
<P>
A major study of the effects of particulate pollution on residents
in 151 U.S. metropolitan areas concluded that smog levels in Southern
California shorten one's life span by one to three years.
<P>
Another study sponsored by the California Environmental Protection
Agency found that particulate pollution is linked to 275 deaths
each year in San Bernardino and Riverside counties.
<P>
A third research project concluded that levels of carbon monoxide
in Los Angeles are associated with a significantly increased risk
of heart failure.
<P>
In 1995, AQMD laid the groundwork for many important pollution
control programs.  In 1996, AQMD will follow through and put these
programs in place to continue steady progress toward clean air.

<H2>THE CASE FOR CHARGING AHEAD WITH ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA </CENTER></H2>

<P>
Electric vehicles have the potential to be as vital to Southern
California's environment as Hollywood is to the nation's film
industry.
<P>
The region's 15 million people and its multitude of businesses
churn up a daily tract of smog between the ocean and the mountains.
<P>
The region's air pollution levels, head and shoulders above anywhere
else in the nation, sicken many residents. For some, the pollution
pall even cuts their lives short.
<P>
Southern California needs electric vehicles (EVs) to win the war
against smog -- and to maintain healthful air in the 21st century.
Unlike the cleanest fossil fuel-powered machine, EVs have zero
emissions from the day they're driven off the showroom floor until
the day they're sent to the scrap heap.
<P>
They also could lead to a new electric vehicle industry as important
to our economy as aerospace and as uniquely identified with Southern
California as the &quot;Hollywood&quot; sign overlooking Los Angeles.
<P>
EVs are not a distant dream of ivory-tower environmentalists.
Prototypes tested by Southland drivers are peppy, fun to drive
and sufficient for all but the longest commutes.
<P>
Some automakers and oil companies, resisting the inevitable evolution
to a cleaner and more efficient automobile, have successfully
lobbied the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to delay its
landmark Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program adopted in 1990.
<P>
The program would have required that 2% of new passenger cars
and trucks sold in the state in 1998 be ZEVs, increasing to 10%
by 2003.
<P>
Practically speaking, the mandate would have required automakers
to produce battery-powered EVs, as other zero-emission technologies
such as fuel cells are not likely to be commercially available
before 2010.
<P>
CARB officials have recently directed their staff to develop a
new proposal that would eliminate all ZEV mandates until 2003.
Automakers might only be asked to make voluntary agreements to
start producing electric vehicles in 1998.
<P>
Instead of an estimated 22,000 electric vehicles that would have
been produced in 1998 under the 2% mandate, automakers may only
turn out a few thousand vehicles in what will amount to a small
demonstration program.
<P>
Ironically, even though GM and other automakers have recently
announced plans to sell EVs to the public this year, Detroit officials
predict that few will be sold.
<P>
Automakers and other EV opponents are sticking by their claims
that EVs are immature, unsafe, will be too costly and drivers
won't like them.
<P>
However, a closer look at the issues in this paper shows that
there is little basis to these claims.
<P>
Electric vehicles are poised to play a pivotal role in the quest
for clean air in the Southland, and in polluted metropolitan areas
around the world.
<H4>Why EVs are needed in Southern California</H4>

<P>
In spite of dramatic improvements in air quality during the past
several decades, Southern California still suffers by far the
worst air quality in the nation.
<P>
During 1995, Southland residents endured about 100 days when ozone
levels climbed above federal health standards. In comparison,
the next most polluted city outside California -- Houston -- had
an average of 13 days above the standard between 1992 and 1994.
Four other cities -- Houston, Hartford, Conn., Trenton, N.J.,
New York and Philadelphia -- averaged just four days above the
standard each year.
<P>
It's bad enough that smog wipes out scenic views and replaces
them with a brownish haze. Numerous studies have shown that smog
also exacts a terrible toll on health. Breathing particulate pollution
alone may reduce our life spans by one to three years.
<P>
That is why common sense dictates and federal laws require us
to meet health-based air quality standards by 2010, and pose tough
sanctions if we fail to meet those goals.
<P>
Vehicles are responsible for well over 50% of the air pollution
in Southern California. To achieve cleaner air, we must have cleaner
cars.
<P>
Just how clean? The South Coast Air Quality Management District's
20-year blueprint for clean air specifies that 35% of medium-
and heavy duty-vehicles, 22% of passenger cars, 15% of light-duty
trucks, 100% of urban buses and 50% of off-road engines have zero
emissions by 2010 in order to restore healthful air.
<P>
If CARB softens or eliminates its mandate that 10% of cars sold
by 2003 be EVs, the Southland's chances of achieving clean air
by the end of next decade will be dangerously compromised.
<H3>Why electric vehicles are practical today</H3>

<P>
Electric vehicles have come a long way since Scottish inventor
Robert Davidson first demonstrated basic EV principles nearly
160 years ago.
<P>
In 1892, the first four-wheel battery EV had a four-horsepower
motor and a maximum speed of 14 miles per hour. It could run for
13 hours on a 10-hour charge.
<P>
Today, some EVs have a range of up to 235 miles and sports car-like
performance. They can be recharged in about three hours at 220
volts and eight hours using 110 volts.
<P>
The most critical technical challenge for EV manufacturers is
to develop batteries that provide high energy and power density,
coupled with low cost, long life, and a rapid recharge capability.
<P>
To accelerate the development of advanced battery technologies,
Chrysler, Ford and GM and the federal government formed the U.S.
Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) and committed to more than
$260 million in research.
<P>
As a result of USABC and other research efforts, there has been
significant progress in reducing battery recharging times, improving
electric motor technologies and overall vehicle performance, and
demonstrating alternative power sources such as fuel cells, ultracapacitors
and electro-mechanical batteries (flywheels).
<H4>A brief history of electric vehicles</H4>

<P>
During the past 100 years, interest in EVs has waxed and waned
due to their cost and relative competitiveness with gasoline-powered
vehicles.
<P>
In 1900, battery-powered EVs comprised 38% of new vehicle sales.
Steam-powered cars accounted for 40% of total sales, while gasoline
cars made up 22%.
<P>
By 1912, there were approximately 34,000 battery-powered EVs on
the road, with a range of 25 to 50 miles, and a speed record of
66 miles per hour.
<P>
Despite this early success, EVs ultimately could not compete with
the technological breakthroughs and rapidly expanding refueling
networks of gasoline-powered vehicles. By 1940, the last U.S.
EV manufacturer was out of business.
<P>
During the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, General Motors announced
its intention to commercialize at least one EV model. However,
GM's interest in marketing EVs seemed to wane as gasoline again
became abundant and cheap.
<H4>Current EV Programs</H4>

<P>
<B>Chrysler</B> has produced about 50 prototype minivan EVs, the
most advanced of which are powered by nickel-metal hydride batteries
with driving ranges as high as 250 miles. Although Chrysler is
reportedly testing electric versions of the Neon passenger car,
it appears that the minivan platform will be used in Chrysler's
EV launch. It remains to be seen whether Chrysler will use the
more advanced nickel-metal hydride battery technology or go with
a less costly option such as the Electrosource lead-acid battery.
<P>
<B>Ford</B> has developed a prototype EV van, known as the Ecostar,
equipped with high temperature sodium-sulfur batteries. Ford is
currently testing about 80 Ecostar EVs which provide a range of
100 miles and a top speed of 70 miles per hour. For its first
EVs, Ford will reportedly use either the Electrosource lead-acid
battery, one of the nickel-metal hydride batteries (Ovonics or
SAFT), or the AEG sodium-nickel chloride battery.
<P>
<B>General Motors</B> has announced plans to produce an EV this
year based on the Impact, a prototype two-seater powered by lead-acid
batteries. Designed as a high performance vehicle, the Impact
can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 8 seconds, with a governed
top speed of 75 miles per hour and a range of about 75 miles.
<P>
GM officials say their new model, called the EV-1, will be sold
in 25 Saturn dealerships across the Southland starting this fall.
The car will be priced in the mid-$30,000 range; analysts predict
a few thousand will be sold this year.
<P>
Although GM has tested about 20 Impacts with nickel-metal-hydride
batteries that can achieve a much greater range of 210 to 250
miles, company officials have said the advanced battery needs
more testing before it can be used in the vehicle.
<P>
Four foreign manufacturers would have been required to market
zero-emission vehicles for the 1998 model year: <B>Toyota, Nissan,
Honda and Mazda</B>. Publicly, Japanese manufacturers are reluctant
to provide specifics, but privately they have told government
officials that all major technological issues with EVs have been
sufficiently overcome to produce EVs by 1998.
<P>
<B>Mitsubishi</B> recently indicated an interest in developing
a hybrid EV that could meet the &quot;Equivalent Zero Emission
Vehicle&quot; designation under consideration by CARB.
<P>
Smaller-volume automakers including <B>Suburu, BMW, Mercedes,
Volvo</B>, etc., will not be subject to a ZEV requirement until
several years after larger manufacturers. However, each of the
smaller automakers is working on its own EV technology for possible
commercial introduction at any time that they perceive the market
to be inviting.
<P>
Peugeot believes European cities are especially conducive to the
use of small &quot;neighborhood&quot; EVs and has announced an
intention to market EVs in Europe as early as this year.
<H4>Independent Automakers</H4>

<P>
AC Propulsion of San Dimas is building and demonstrating numerous
EVs with state-of-the-art AC-induction drive systems; this technology
may be licensed for use by one or more of the major automakers.
<P>
Solectria Corporation has achieved an on-road range of 235 miles
with a nickel-metal hydride battery pack in its &quot;Sunrise&quot;
prototype, and has announced plans to market 20,000 of these purpose-built
EVs this year.
<P>
Other companies and entities that are involved in the design and
development of passenger EVs include Amerigon, Calstart and Motive.
<P>
However, given the dynamics, costs, and complexities of manufacturing,
selling and servicing automobiles, the EV market is likely to
be dominated by the existing major automakers.
<H3>Electric vehicles are inherently superior to internal combustion
engines</H3>

<P>
EVs produce much lower emissions than even the cleanest internal-combustion
engine vehicles -- even when emissions associated with electricity
production are taken into account.
<P>
EVs directly produce no emissions, in contrast to gasoline-powered
vehicles, which emit combustion pollutants from the tailpipe as
well as evaporated hydrocarbons from the fuel system.
<P>
Moreover, EVs are cleaner than internal-combustion engine vehicles
throughout their useful vehicle life. Because EVs don't burn fuel,
there can be no degradation or failure of emissions-control systems.
Thus, unlike conventional vehicles which tend to pollute much
more as they get older, EVs maintain their negligible emission
rates over time.
<P>
This characteristic leads to an additional benefit: EV owners
never need a Smog Check!
<P>
Gasoline vehicles must be inspected every two years, and if necessary,
repaired. This cost to motorists will increase as the state's
&quot;enhanced&quot; Smog Check program is phased in.
<P>
Even the cleanest gasoline-powered vehicles, using reformulated
gasoline and improved catalytic converter technology to meet CARB's
Ultra Low Emission Vehicle standard, will not be nearly as clean
as electric vehicles, according to CARB officials. Table 1 shows
EV emissions, <I>including</I> related emissions from electric
power plants needed to charge EV batteries.

<P>
Southern California motorists will want to buy EVs
<P>
Top 10 reasons why:
<P>
1. They're fun to drive. EV acceleration can beat even that of
sporty gas-guzzlers.
<P>
2. EVs are capable of being fully equipped with comfort and safety
features such as air conditioning, dual air bags, anti-lock braking
systems, power windows and door locks.
<P>
3. EVs will meet the driving range needs of most motorists and
will more than fulfill the needs of a family's second car.
<P>
4. They should be cheaper to operate than gasoline vehicles. The
Los Angeles Department of Power and Water plans to offer discounts
for nighttime recharging.
<P>
5. Initial subsidies and tax incentives will make them attractive
to purchase. AQMD will offer a $5,000 per vehicle subsidy for
1,200 vehicles this year. The state and federal government also
offers significant tax incentives.
<P>
6. Before long, EVs should be cheaper to manufacture than gasoline
cars. Battery cost already has dropped from about $1,000 per kilowatt/hour
in 1990 to an expected $200 per kilowatt hour in 1998.
<P>
7. Mechanically, they are far less complex than today's cars,
so there will be much less maintenance involved. Weekend auto
mechanics will have to find new hobbies.
<P>
8. No more stopping at congested or dimly lit gas stations. Simply
recharge at home during evenings.
<P>
9. No more oil changes and oil stains on the driveway or in the
garage.
<P>
10. No more SmogChecks!
<H3>EVs will not require unusually large subsidies</H3>

<P>
Critics of EVs, including the Reason Foundation, a conservative
think tank, assert that electric vehicles will be so expensive
that automakers will have to subsidize their cost by charging
more for gasoline-powered models.
<P>
Reason Foundation officials maintain that increasing the price
of gasoline-powered vehicles will cause motorists to hang onto
older, higher-polluting cars longer than normal, resulting in
increased air pollution.
<P>
This assertion is inaccurate and misleading in several ways. First,
major automobile companies already routinely cross-subsidize certain
vehicle models within their product lines. For example:
<UL>
<LI>Ford Motor Company bought Jaguar with the intention of entering
into the luxury sedan market dominated by German and Japanese
automakers. Ford was able to revitalize Jaguar's production, sales
and marketing by internalizing some of the associated costs.
<LI>The Chrysler Viper was a very costly vehicle to develop, market
and support, but one that brought Chrysler prestige through high-profile,
image-based marketing on the auto show circuit. One means of helping
such vehicles through their early launch cycles is by cross-subsidization
from highly successful product lines, such as the Chrysler minivan
series.
<LI>After Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements were
adopted in the early 1970s, auto manufacturers began subsidizing
the prices of smaller, more energy-efficient vehicles such as
the Chevrolet Chevette and Ford Fiesta to ensure that sufficient
numbers were sold.
</UL>

<P>
This enabled the automakers to avoid paying significant federal
penalties for not complying with CAFE regulations and to meet
growing consumer demand for fuel-efficient vehicles. Since sales
of such low-profit vehicles could not pay for their entire development,
production and marketing costs, they were partially subsidized
by more profitable models through internal accounting procedures.
<UL>
<LI>Similarly, GM's establishment of the Saturn product line resulted
in significant benefits involving overall product reputation and
organizational reform. Consequently, GM made a business decision
to partially cross subsidize the establishment of the Saturn product
line, even though it may take several years, if not through the
end of the decade, to fully offset the original investment.
</UL>

<P>
GM essentially acknowledged the importance of internally cross
subsidizing models in its recent quarterly filing to the federal
Security and Exchange Commission. Such internal transfers clearly
reflect conventional business practices among major global corporations.
<P>
Automakers could aid the introduction of EVs by making available
their substantial lines of credit to dealerships. GM had a $400
million line of credit available to, but unused by, its dealerships
in calendar year 1994. Such lines of credit could readily be allocated
to ZEV marketing if a corporate strategic commitment is made for
a successful ZEV launch.
<P>
Thus, the Reason Foundation's assertion fails to acknowledge that
cross-subsidization of less profitable vehicle types is a routine
practice in Detroit.
<P>
It also apparently overestimates the magnitude of EV subsidization
that will be necessary for the automakers to market ZEVs. A recent
Department of Energy (DOE) report found that the cost of a typical
new gasoline car in California would have increased by an average
of only $91 during the first few years under the former 1998 ZEV
requirement.
<P>
DOE also estimated that under the CARB mandate EVs would have
cost essentially the same as gasoline vehicles by 1998 due to
greater EV production volumes.
<P>
The bottom line is that there is no evidence that any future ZEV
requirement would significantly raise car prices and cause prospective
buyers to postpone buying a new car, as predicted by the Reason
Foundation.
<H3>Attacks on EVs are scientifically unfounded</H3>

<H4>Lead Pollution Attributable to EVs Has Been Exaggerated </H4>

<P>
EV opponents have argued that lead pollution will dramatically
increase if EVs are produced in significant numbers.
<P>
Lead is a highly toxic substance that can cause severe neurological
damage, especially to children, if it enters the body via air,
food or water.
<P>
A 1995 study by Carnegie Mellon University has suggested that
deployment of EVs will significantly increase lead emissions due
to the manufacture, use, and disposal of lead-acid batteries.
<P>
The study, and a recent revised analysis by Carnegie Mellon conclude
that lead-acid-battery powered EVs will emit 15 to 34 times as
much lead as a Geo Metro burning now-banned leaded gasoline.
<P>
According to CARB officials, the original study was seriously
flawed due to several inaccurate assumptions.
<P>
For example, the study failed to recognize that lead-acid batteries
are likely to be a transitional technology for EVs. CARB estimates
that 90% of the new EVs in 2010 will use more advanced energy-storage
technologies such as nickel-metal hydride batteries and lithium
ion batteries.
<P>
GM has already formed a joint venture with Ovonics to mass produce
its nickel-metal hydride batteries in Ohio, according to the Edison
Electric Institute.
<P>
These batteries may be available in the near future at a reasonable
cost. And over the longer term, many experts expect fuel cells
to become the prime source of energy and power for EVs.
<P>
Diligence and strict compliance with environmental standards will
of course be essential for battery recycling and production facilities.
<P>
Meanwhile, AQMD is cosponsoring a project to develop and demonstrate
a state-of-the-art &quot;electrowinning&quot; process that produces
almost no emissions from lead-acid battery recycling.
<P>
In conclusion, the impact of EVs on ambient lead levels will be
virtually immeasurable in urban environments, which are subject
to far greater air pollution exposure than rural areas where mining
operations are located.
<H4>EVs and the Issue of &quot;Hidden Costs&quot;</H4>

<P>
It is ironic that the oil industry and other opponents of the
California ZEV requirement have criticized the &quot;hidden costs&quot;
of EVs.
<P>
America's petroleum-dependent transportation system imposes a
huge monetary toll on our society in the form of real costs that
are &quot;external&quot; -- or hidden -- to normal market forces.
<P>
Air pollution is a prime example. In the South Coast Air Basin,
nearly 80% of total volatile organic compound emissions (VOCs)
and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are directly or indirectly attributable
to petroleum fuels.
<P>
An AQMD-sponsored study by California State University, Fullerton,
estimated that air pollution costs Southland residents about $9
billion a year due to adverse health effects.
<P>
Cutting smog with electric vehicles will substantially reduce
the &quot;hidden&quot; health costs of air pollution.
<H3>EVs can create jobs and a new high-tech transportation industry
in the Southland</H3>

<P>
EVs offer a prime opportunity to boost the Southland's economy
while cleaning its air.
<P>
According to a study by the University of Southern California,
manufacturing EV components in the region could create 24,000
jobs by 2003.
<P>
Participants in Calstart, a public-private consortium, have already
invested more than $452 million in the EV industry.
<P>
A Southern California EV industry could partially replace lost
defense-related jobs. And it could tap into a growing global market
for zero-emission automobiles.
<H3>EVs will pave the way for other advanced technologies</H3>

<P>
EVs offer an opportunity to develop entirely new and improved
propulsion systems.
<P>
Today's state-of-the-art EV consists of storage batteries that
deliver power to an AC-induction electric motor that needs no
transmission. This propulsion system is inherently more efficient
than conventional ones consisting of an internal-combustion engine
and a toothed-gear transmission.
<P>
Fuel cells -- non-combustion &quot;engines&quot; that generate
power through the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen
-- can further improve the efficiency, utility and environmental
benefits of EVs.
<P>
Battery-powered EVs are seen as a catalyst in expediting the transition
from current electric-propulsion technology to highly advanced
fuel cell propulsion systems.
<P>
<U><I>Advantages of fuel cells</I></U> 
<P>
Fuel cells are even more benign to the environment than EVs, for
several reasons:
<P>
Fuel cells can be operated on pure hydrogen or a variety of hydrogen-rich
fuels, such as methanol, ethanol, natural gas or even gasoline.
<P>
Like batteries, fuel cells are approximately twice as efficient
as gasoline-fueled internal-combustion engines and can provide
zero emissions. Like gasoline-powered vehicles, they utilize an
external fuel supply, and can therefore match or better the driving
range of today's cars.
<P>
Fuel cell systems are completely emission-free when fueled on
hydrogen that has been generated by solar- or wind-powered electrolysis,
a process for separating hydrogen and oxygen from water.
<P>
The potential of fuel cell technologies to revolutionize the automobile
industry is now being recognized by major automakers worldwide.
All three domestic manufacturers are developing prototype fuel
cell passenger vehicles. Mercedes Benz appears to have the most
aggressive program to develop and demonstrate fuel cell cars.
<P>
Competition for future markets is sufficiently fierce that fuel
cells have been declared &quot;critical&quot; to America's future
as a world leader in technology development, according to the
industry-based Council on Competitiveness. Fuel cell buses are
already in operation and targeted for commercialization in about
five years.
<P>
Thus, today's emerging transition to EVs powered by batteries,
and ultimately by fuel cells, presents an important opportunity
to simultaneously achieve greater energy efficiency, major emissions
reductions, and a revitalization of some high-technology work
sectors in America.

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="/icon/9512fs.gif" HEIGHT=50 WIDTH=50 ALT="Clean Air Plan Logo"><H2>Officials Replace Controversial Rideshare Rule
</H2>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/icon/line4.gif"></CENTER>

<P>
Southland air quality officials scrapped the region's ridesharing
requirement today by a vote of 9 to 3 and replaced it with a rule
focusing instead on reducing motor vehicle emissions, the number
one cause of smog.
<P>
To replace those reductions and still meet federal health standards,
AQMD's Governing Board adopted a more flexible and less costly
alternative, Rule 2202: On-road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options.
<P>
&quot;Employers will now have a wide range of cost-effective options
to help clean the air,&quot; said Executive Officer James M. Lents.
<P>
Among the options provided under the rule are scrapping old, high-polluting
vehicles and using remote sensing devices to detect and repair
gross-emitting cars. In addition, companies will be able to contribute
to a fund administered by AQMD that will be used to finance such
air pollution reductions regionwide.
<P>
Ridesharing will not be mandatory and was only included as a voluntary
option after many businesses asked to continue receiving emission-reduction
credit for their ridesharing programs.
<P>
The new rule should offer businesses substantial savings and increased
flexibility at an annual cost of just $37 to $43 per employee,
compared to about $110 per employee for the old rule.
<P>
It also will reduce paperwork. Instead of submitting a lengthy
ridesharing plan every two years, companies will be able to turn
in a one-page registration form outlining their chosen vehicle
emission reduction option.
<P>
<B>How it works</B> 
<P>
Until this year, any business with 100 or more employees had to
institute a plan encouraging workers to rideshare.
<P>
The program's goal was to reduce driving -- and pollution -- by
increasing the average number of employees in vehicles commuting
to work. For most Southland companies, the goal was to increase
the average vehicle ridership to 1.5, or an average of 15 workers
in every 10 cars.
<P>
Under the new rule, businesses with 100 or more employees will
be required to meet an annual emissions reduction target.
<P>
These emission reductions are necessary to avoid sanctions under
the federal Clean Air Act, which could have a severe impact on
the region's economic growth.
<P>
Companies can meet their emissions reduction target by choosing
one or a combination of the following options:
<UL>
<LI><B>Old vehicle scrapping </B>of 1981 or older vehicles;
<LI><B>Remote sensing </B>of vehicle tailpipe exhaust to identify
and repair highly polluting vehicles;
<LI><B>Clean fuel vehicles</B> -- Convert vehicles or off-road
equipment such as forklifts to natural gas, electricity or other
clean fuels;
</UL>

<P>
<B>Air Quality Investment Program </B>-- Any company can contribute
$60 annually per employee that reports to work during the peak
window, or $125 per employee for a three-year period to an escrow
account. This is a substantial cost reduction from the former
Air Quality Investment Program, which required a payment of $110
per employee per year. The per-employee cost was reduced because
entrepreneurs such as old vehicle scrappers have shown that emissions
can be cut for considerably less than $110 per employee. Investment
program money will be used to fund projects reducing vehicle pollution;
and
<UL>
<LI><B>New Emission Reduction Credits</B> earned when a company
over-controls polluting equipment, modernizes, or shuts down equipment,
can also be used to meet the employer requirement.
</UL>

<P>
Rule 2202 has a sunset clause to end on Dec. 31, 1998, or sooner,
provided it is replaced with a program such as transportation
market incentives that would reduce an equal amount of emissions.
AQMD also plans a comprehensive review next year of its entire
mobile source emissions reduction strategy.
<P>
AQMD is the air pollution control agency for Los Angeles, Orange
and portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.
<P>
<B>Registration Facts for Employers</B> 
<UL>
<LI><B>A filing extension</B> until Feb. 16, 1996, is automatically
granted to employers who had plans due from Oct. 13 through Dec.
13, 1995.
<LI><B>Survey data</B> that became older than six months during
the same time period will be accepted for plans submitted through
Feb. 16, 1996.
<LI><B>Plans approved</B> after Dec. 8 will be considered triennial
plans. Other plans will remain biennial until the next filing
cycle. An annual analysis is still to be submitted in the off-years.
<LI><B>The triennial plan fee</B> is the same as for a biennial
plan, as specified in Rule 308. Amendments to Rule 308 take place
annually in June.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Workshop on Rule 2202 for 1996</B> 
<P>
Throughout 1996, AQMD will hold informational workshops each month
on Rule 2202. All workshops are free-of-charge and those listed
below will be held in AQMD's auditorium, 21865 E. Copley Drive,
Diamond Bar. AQMD also will hold additional workshops throughout
the basin. Their locations and dates will be announced at a later
date. No pre-registration is necessary. Seating for all workshops
is on a first-come, first-serve basis. For more information call
(909) 396-3271.

<H2>AQMD FACT SHEET</H2>
<HR>

<H3>REMOTE SENSING </H3>
</CENTER>
<H4>What is remote sensing?</H4>

<P>
Remote sensing is a technique for instantaneously measuring emissions
from vehicles' tailpipes as vehicles drive by.
<H4>Why is it needed?</H4>

<P>
Numerous studies have shown that 10% of the Southland's vehicles
are responsible for about 50% of the region's vehicle pollution.
<H4>How does it work?</H4>

<P>
An infrared beam is projected horizontally across a single lane
of traffic. As vehicles drive by, the beam passes through tailpipe
exhaust, which absorbs some of the infrared light. A sensor and
computer translate this into an emissions level.
<P>
At the same time, an electronic license plate reader uses a video
camera and computer to automatically record the vehicle's license
number.
<H4>What pollutants does it measure?</H4>

<P>
Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons. Some units also
measure nitrogen oxide emissions.
<H4>Where are remote sensors located?</H4>

<P>
Typically alongside a freeway on- or off-ramp, or on a surface
street where traffic can be narrowed to one lane.
<H4>Is remote sensing a &quot;proven&quot; technology? </H4>

<P>
Yes. Millions of vehicles measured in several studies across the
country have shown that remote sensing is a reliable method of
detecting high polluters, with certain limitations.
<H4>How accurate is remote sensing?</H4>

<P>
Plus or minus 5% for carbon monoxide and plus or minus 15% for
hydrocarbons for detecting high-emitting vehicles.
<H4>What are the limitations of remote sensing?</H4>

<P>
Remote sensing captures a one-second &quot;snapshot&quot; of a
vehicle's emissions. If a vehicle's engine is cold or if the vehicle
is accelerating, emissions may be considerably higher than if
the vehicle were cruising at a steady speed.
<H4>When was it developed?</H4>

<P>
Two faculty members at the University of Denver developed the
technology in the late 1980s.
<H4>Who makes remote sensing equipment?</H4>

<P>
At least two companies, including Remote Sensing Technologies
of Denver and Santa Barbara Research Center, a subsidiary of Hughes
Electronics.
<H4>How is it likely to be used in the future?</H4>

<P>
State officials are expected to use remote sensing as part of
an enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance program to detect
and repair high polluters.
<P>
Southland employers subject to AQMD's Rule 2202 may also use remote
sensing to comply with the regulation.

<H1>AQMD OPEN BURNING POLICY </H1>

<H1>Fact Sheet </H1>

<H1>AQMD Rule 444: Open Fires </H1>
<HR>

<P>
In 1976, AQMD adopted a rule prohibiting the open burning of combustible
materials within the South Coast District without first obtaining
a written permit from AQMD and if required, from the local fire
protection agency.
<P>
Open burning is not allowed, except for the following which requires
a permit:
<UL>
<LI>o when a fire hazard is declared by the local fire protection
agency and there is no other way to eliminate the hazard;
<LI>o for agricultural burning in the growing of crops, raising
animals or forest management;
<LI>o to dispose of tumbleweeds;
<LI>o to burn dry cotton gin waste infected with an agricultural
pest; or
<LI>o when a county health officer orders burning of infectious
waste to remove a public health hazard.
</UL>

<P>
Alternatives to open burning include hauling the debris to a landfill
dump site or chipping and shredding.
<P>
<B>PERMITS</B> 
<P>
AQMD permits are not needed for cooking, ceremonial or recreational
purposes, but may be required by the local fire department. Permits
from both agencies are needed for any type of allowable open burning.
<P>
<B>BURN/NO BURN DAYS</B> 
<P>
AQMD monitors weather conditions and air quality to forecast when
burning will be safe. BURN/NO BURN days are based on metrological
conditions and the likelihood of a smog episode. NO BURN days
usually occur in the summer when heat, dry conditions, winds or
smog would make it unsafe and unhealthy to burn. As air pollution
has decreased, the number of NO BURN days has declined accordingly.
In 1993, a total of 58 days were designated as NO BURN days with
five occurring during November during the weeklong series of Southland
fires.
<P>
Local fire protection agencies can receive a waver to conduct
burning on designated NO BURN days by contacting AQMD and requesting
a variance.
<P>
<B>WILDLAND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT</B> 
<P>
Burning conducted as part of a wildland vegetation management
plan must be approved by AQMD and specify the acreage to be burned,
efforts to minimize smoke and purpose of burning.

<H1>CUT-SMOG - SMOKING VEHICLE PROGRAM </H1>
<HR>

<P>
In 1987, Senate Bill 1928 (Presley) expanded the South Coast Air
Quality Management District's authority to regulate indirect and
mobile source as well as stationary source emissions in the South
Coast Air Basin. AQMD then developed a Smoking Vehicle
Program which was approved in March 1988 by <A HREF="/hb/govbd.html">AQMD's Governing Board</A>.
The program included a complaint hotline for smoking vehicles,
1-800-CUT SMOG.
<P>
<I><B>Why was the CUT-SMOG program established?</I></B>
<P>
The CUT-SMOG Program was established to reduce visible exhaust
from vehicles traveling in the basin.
<P>

AQMD's CUT-SMOG program depends on public participation. Southland
residents can call AQMD's toll-free number (1-800-CUT-SMOG) with
a complaint about a smoking vehicle they have seen travelling
the basin's roads and freeways.
<P>
<I><B>How does CUT-SMOG work?</I></B> 
<P>
Drivers who spot a vehicle emitting excessive amounts of exhaust
smoke can call the AQMD's toll free number (1-800-CUT-SMOG) and
report it.
<P>
An AQMD staff member will ask the caller for the smoking vehicle's
license plate number (the program only has jurisdiction over vehicles
registered in the State of California), the vehicle make and the
date, time and location of the observation. The program is voluntary
and callers remain anonymous.
<P>
Using the Department of Motor Vehicle's database, AQMD retrieves
the owner's registration information and mails an advisory letter
to the owner informing them that a complaint has been filed against
their vehicle. All information involved in the program remains
confidential.
<P>
<I><B>What does the advisory letter say and what must the owner do
after receiving one?</I></B> 
<P>
The letter advises smoking vehicle owners that their vehicle was reported to
be smoking and recommends they have it repaired to eliminate excessive
emissions.
<P>
The letter also alerts the owner to the fact that excessively
smoking vehicles violate the State of California Motor Vehicle
Codes (Sections 27153 and 27153.5) which carries a fine of $100
to $250, -- depending on the type of vehicle -- for first time
offenders.
<P>
After owners make the necessary repairs, they are asked to
complete the Smoking Vehicle Compliance Form attached to the advisory
letter and return it to AQMD.
<P>
<I><B>Can AQMD impose fines on vehicle owners who have been reported
through the CUT-SMOG program?</I></B> 
<P>
No. However the California Highway Patrol (CHP) can cite passenger
vehicles as well as big rigs and buses for excessive smoke and if warranted impose a fine. 
<P>
<I><B>Can AQMD's toll free number be reached anytime, day or night?</I></B>

<P>
Yes. Residents can report a smoking vehicle to AQMD's 1-800-CUT-SMOG
24-hours a day, seven days a week.
<P>
<I><B>Has AQMD's CUT-SMOG program made a difference?</I></B> 
<P>
After its first month of operation (June 1988), AQMD's CUT-SMOG
hotline received over 6,000 calls. Throughout 1991 incoming calls
averaged more than 15,000 a month. To date nearly 1,000,000 callers
have volunteered information to the CUT-SMOG program.
<P>
On average, more than 40% of the vehicle owners who receive an
advisory letter return their completed compliance forms to the
AQMD, stating that they have attended to their vehicle, either
having it checked and if warranted having any needed repairs made.

<P>
Southern California has suffered unhealthful air since its rapid
population growth and industrialization during World War II. While
air quality has improved in recent years, the residents of the
Basin - which encompasses the areas of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside
and San Bernardino counties west of the mountains - still breathe
the most polluted air in the nation.<BR>

<P>
The 50-year history of the region's air pollution control efforts
is, in many ways, one of the world's key environmental success
stories. Peak ozone levels have been cut by more than half since
air monitoring began in the 1950s. Population exposure has been
reduced even more dramatically, cut by 50% during the 1980s alone,
according to a state Air Resources Board study.<BR>

<P>
Since the late 1940s when the war on smog began, the region's
population has almost tripled from 4.8 million to 14 million;
the number of motor vehicles has more than quadrupled from 2.3
million to 10.6 million; and the area has grown into one of the
more prosperous regions of the world. Yet air pollution levels
here have been cut in half.<BR>

<P>
In 1994, the State legislature adopted Health and Safety Code
Sections 40720 and 40721 which affect the
South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) budget and
budget process in several ways. Beginning in 1995 the AQMD has
been required to prepare and submit annually by February 1 to
the California Air Resources Board (ARB) a Three-Year Budget Forecast,
based upon a work program that provides a workload justification
for the proposed budget and staff changes and identifies any cost
savings to be achieved. Budget and staff resources for existing
and new programs and rules are to be included. The Forecast must
also include proposed increases in permit and other fees for the
following fiscal year and projected for the next two fiscal years.
<BR>

<P>
Recent years have seen a decline in AQMD's expenditures as well
as a significant reduction in staff.
<P>
<IMG SRC="fin_img2.gif"><BR>

<P>
Since 1991-92 the AQMD has cut positions by one-third and reduced
its budgeted program costs by 13.4% ($15.1 million) overall; 10%
in staffing costs; 14% in services, contracts, and supplies; and
70% in equipment expenditures.
<P>
This year's Forecast continues the trend of significant budget
reductions in response to declining revenues from stationary sources.
Both regulated and voluntary emission reductions and actions to
minimize fee increases on businesses has resulted in less revenues
to support AQMD programs. To accomplish its mandates with less,
the AQMD has implemented several new programs such as: market
based incentives (RECLAIM), permit streamlining, source education,
business assistance, and technology advancement.<BR>

<P>
The following table compares current program costs and revenues
to the forecast for Fiscal Years (FY) 1996-97 through 1998-99.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<IMG SRC="fin_tbl1.gif"><BR>

<P>
For the purposes of this forecast, the AQMD has developed work
program information based on its existing and new programs requirements
and has assumed that for the near future it will continue to reduce
its workforce by approximately 4 to 5% annually through attrition.
As attrition occurs the AQMD plans, through its annual budget
process, to reallocate resources to meet its critical program
activities.<BR>

<P>
The projections for FY 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 do not include
salary or benefit increases or increases in basic services and
supplies due to increases in cost. With the expiration of the
current labor contracts, the 80-hour unpaid furlough which was
in place in FY 1993-94 and 1994-95 ended, increasing salary and
benefit costs by approximately 3.85% for FY 1995-96. To date,
the AQMD has been unable to reach agreement with its labor unions.
A more detailed description of the assumptions used to develop
program costs is included in the section on Revenue and Expenditure
Assumptions.<BR>

<P>
Despite forecasted program cost reductions of approximately 10%
over the next three years the AQMD will require additional appropriations
from its fund balance of approximately $3 million annually as
well as projected across-the-board fee increases of 1.4% in FY
1996-97, 2.0% in FY 1997-98 and 2.0% in FY 1998-99 to sustain
the projected expenditure levels. A more detailed description
of the assumptions used to develop revenue projections is included
in the section on Revenue and Expenditure Assumptions.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B><A NAME="new_dir">New Directions</A><BR>
</CENTER><B> </B></B>
<P>
Helping business stay and prosper in Southern California while
meeting clean air goals has become a priority for the AQMD. The
AQMD has instituted a number of programs to help business including
offices for small business assistance and business retention and
economic development.<BR>

<P>
In 1991, AQMD initiated its New Directions in Air Quality Management
reform campaign designed to streamline regulatory and permit requirements,
as well as stress compliance education and business assistance.
In 1995, AQMD provided further regulatory relief with the introduction
of its Business Clean Air Partnership program. Hundreds of companies
have used AQMD services ranging from small businesses who have
received AQMD loan guarantees for pollution control equipment
to major aerospace companies, such as Rockwell, Northrop and TRW
who are using lower-polluting materials developed with support
from AQMD. AQMD is a member of the &quot;red team&quot;, a multi-agency
effort at the state and local level to liaison between business
and government to retain jobs.<BR>

<P>
Continuing its efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs,
the AQMD has reduced the time period between application submittal
and permit issuance. Permit applications are now prescreened for
completeness prior to acceptance, with most issues now resolved
over the telephone to reduce the number of applications rejected.
Applications are also designated for completion within 7, 30,
or 180 days, depending on their complexity. The AQMD goal is to
issue as many permits as possible within the 7- or 30- day time
frames. <BR>

<P>
With over 30,000 sources subject to its regulations, the AQMD
has launched several innovative approaches to maximize the effectiveness
of its compliance programs during a time of decreasing resources.
One of the most successful efforts is the Targeted Inspection
Program, whereby industry-specific or rule-specific inspections
are conducted on all or a significant number of sources. Targeted
inspections not only ensure source compliance, but also work to
&quot;level the playing field&quot; within a targeted industry
by identifying unpermitted sources that have evaded the permitting
system and have unfairly competed with those sources complying
with AQMD rules. AQMD has developed a &quot;Compliance Kit&quot;
distributed to businesses unfamiliar with the clean air mandate
to supply basic information to assist them in complying with AQMD
rules.<BR>

<P>
AQMD also conducts Source Education classes for facility owners
and operators to provide information about air quality compliance
in a non-adversarial setting. Experienced field inspectors, utilizing
training materials customized for specific industries or audiences,
present information that explains the frequently complex components
of air quality rules and regulations. The goal of the program
is to fully integrate air quality compliance into the standard
operating procedures and day-to-day practices of industry.<BR>
<BR>

</CENTER><B> </B></B>
<P>
The four-county Los Angeles region, designated for air quality
purposes as the South Coast Air Basin, has the dirtiest air in
the United States. The federal government has designated six pollutants
that are pervasive enough across the nation to warrant national
health standards. Called &quot;criteria pollutants,&quot; these
are:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>ozone (O<SUB>3</SUB>)
<LI>nitrogen dioxide (NO<SUB>2</SUB>)
<LI>fine particulates (PM<SUB>10</SUB>)
<LI>carbon monoxide (CO)
<LI>lead (Pb), and
<LI>sulfur dioxide (SO<SUB>2</SUB>). <BR>

</UL>

<P>
In the past three years, the South Coast Basin has experienced
levels of ozone 2.3 times the federal health standard, carbon
monoxide 1.9 times the standard, and fine particulates 1.6 times
the standard (based on the annual average standard). In 1992,
1993 and 1994, the Basin violated one or more of the federal criteria
pollutant standards an average of 156 days a year.<BR>

<P>
In addition, the State of California through the California Air
Resources Board (ARB) sets ambient air quality standards for these
same pollutants. California's standards generally are tighter
than the federal Environmental Protection Agency's, reflecting
the conclusion on ARB's part that the federal standards are not
adequate to protect public health in this region. Toxic compounds
also are a potential problem. More toxic pollution is emitted
into the air in the South Coast Basin than in any other region
in California. Fifty-one percent of all toxic emissions from major
facilities in California occur in the South Coast Air Basin, some
67.6 million pounds a year. The Basin's large number of cars and
small sources-including small businesses and households-compounds
the problem.<BR>

<P>
<U>Air Quality Trends<BR>
</U> 
<P>
Ozone levels have fallen by about 50% since peaks in the mid-1950s.
Lead, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide levels have gone down
from non-attainment to full attainment of federal health standards.
This past year, 1995, was the cleanest ozone year on record. 
<BR>

<P>
Particulate and carbon monoxide levels have also decreased in
the past decade, but not to the degree which ozone has improved.
<BR>

<P>
While our air quality is getting better it remains the most unhealthful
in the nation. In fact, you would have to combine the air pollution
from over 40 metropolitan areas including New York, Chicago, Houston,
Philadelphia and Denver to equal the unhealthful exposure in our
region.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B><A NAME="mandates">Mandates</A><BR>
</CENTER><B> </B></B>
<P>
The South Coast AQMD is governed and directed by comprehensive
state and federal laws which provide the regulatory framework
for air quality management in this Basin. These laws require the
AQMD to take prescribed steps to improve air quality. The major
legal requirements are described below:<BR>

<P>
<U>State Laws<BR>
</U> 
<P>
Under State law, AQMD must develop and submit to the state at
least every third year an Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) demonstrating
how the region will achieve state and federal ambient air quality
standards, or at a minimum demonstrating that all feasible measures
are being carried out to meet state air quality standards. To
date AQMD's Governing Board has adopted such plans demonstrating
attainment in 1989, 1991, and 1994. Earlier plans - in 1979 and
1982 - did not show attainment and predicted continued unhealthful
air well into the next century.<BR>

<P>
Generally speaking, AQMD is responsible for reducing pollution
from stationary sources, such as factories and businesses. The
California Air Resources Board (ARB) is primarily responsible
for mobile sources. The AQMD and ARB share responsibilities with
respect to area sources. The AQMD and Southern California Association
of Governments (SCAG) share some responsibilities with ARB regarding
some aspects of mobile source emissions. Control of emissions
from sources such as airports, harbors, trains and federal facilities
is shared by the federal EPA, ARB and AQMD.<BR>

<P>
<B>California Clean Air Act (AB2595)</B> requires air districts
in California to adopt plans to meet state ambient air quality
standards expeditiously. It mandates that AQMD's attainment plans
meet several specific requirements, including:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>a 5% per year reduction in emissions (the plan can achieve
less than 5% annual reduction if it includes every feasible measure
and an expeditious adoption schedule);
<LI>Best Available Control Technology-BACT- for new and modified
sources
<LI>Programs to achieve a 1.5 average vehicle ridership during
heavy commute hours by 1999;
<LI>Best Available Retrofit Control Technology-BARCT-for existing
sources
<LI>Indirect source control programs.<BR>

</UL>

<P>
<B>Lewis-Presley Air Quality Management Act (SB151)</B> specifies
additional, more stringent, requirements for air quality plans
in the South Coast area. It specifies that AQMD has responsibility
to prepare the plan in conjunction with SCAG, which must prepare
the portions of the plan relating to demographic projections,
land use, and transportation programs. State law also includes
the following measures:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>authorizes AQMD to adopt market incentives such as the emissions
trading program known as RECLAIM as long as they achieve reductions
equivalent to command-and-control regulations;
<LI>requires AQMD to establish a loan guarantee program using
proceeds from penalties received to help small businesses purchase
air pollution control equipment;
<LI>requires AQMD to establish a program to encourage voluntary
participation in projects to increase the use of clean burning
fuels;
<LI>requires AQMD to adopt and enforce rules to ensure no net
emissions increases. <BR>

</UL>

<P>
<B>Air Toxics Hot Spots Information &amp; Assessment Act (AB2588)</B>
requires facilities that emit significant quantities of pollutants
to prepare health risk assessments describing the impact of toxic
contaminants on neighboring areas. If AQMD determines that the
toxic emissions create a significant risk, the public must be
notified.<BR>

<P>
<B>Tanner Air Toxics Process (AB1807)</B> requires ARB to adopt
air toxic control measures to limit emissions of toxic air contaminants
from classes of industrial facilities. Local air districts are
required to enforce these regulations.<BR>

<P>
Beginning January 1, 1996 three new laws take effect which place
new limits on ridesharing and the AQMD's fee authority. <BR>

<P>
<B>Senate Bill No. 437 and 772, </B>which take effect January
1, 1996, place restrictions on the AQMD's ability to require employers
to submit trip reduction plans. At its December 8, 1995 meeting
the Board adopted Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation
Options and rescinded Rule 1501 - Work Trip Reduction Plans and
Rule 1501.1 - Alternatives to Work Trip Reduction Plans. The new
rule provides employers with a menu of emission reduction options,
which employers can choose to reduce mobile source emissions in
order to meet their site-specific emission reduction target. 
<BR>

<P>
<B>Senate Bill No. 962 </B>restricts the AQMD's ability to index
emission fees based on a sources emission potential or percentage
of emission trading credits held. This prevents the AQMD from
implementing a fee system that would maintain level emission fee
revenues while emissions are declining. Emissions are anticipated
to decease by 8% annually. This law modifies the CPI cap on AQMD
individual fee increases allowing for increases greater the CPI
based on a finding by the Governing Board. This will allow for
fee adjustments to cover program costs, but not to exceed the
cap on total AQMD fee revenues.<BR>

<P>
<U>Federal Law<BR>
</U> 
<P>
<B>The Clean Air Act.</B> Under federal law, the AQMD must develop
and submit to ARB for review and submittal to the federal EPA,
an element of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) demonstrating
how the region will achieve federal ambient air quality standards.
In the case of ozone the plan was required to be submitted by
November 15, 1994 and for fine particulates, PM10, the plan is
required to be submitted by February 8, 1997. Plans for other
pollutants were submitted in earlier years. The federal Clean
Air Act mandates that sanctions be imposed on an area if a suitable
plan is not adopted. These sanctions can include loss of key federal
funds and more stringent requirements on new or expanding industries.
<BR>

<P>
To insure consistency, the AQMD has been adopting unified plans
that attempt to meet both state and federal plan requirements.
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B><A NAME="mission">Mission</A><BR>
</CENTER><B> </B></B>
<P>
<U>Goals and Objectives</U> <BR>

<P>
The mission of the AQMD is to protect public health from air pollution
while being sensitive to the economic needs of the Basin's businesses.
It does this through a comprehensive program of planning, regulation,
education, enforcement, compliance incentives, technical innovation
and promoting public understanding of air quality issues. Over
the past several years AQMD has implemented a policy of working
with regulated businesses to ensure their participation in making
the rules which will impact them. This cooperative approach has
resulted in greater business support for achievement of air that
is healthful to breathe.<BR>

<P>
To carry out its mission the AQMD has developed a set of Goals
and Objectives which is evaluated and revised annually and presented
at a public hearing. The following Goals have been developed for
FY 1996-97:<BR>

<OL>
<LI>Implement, monitor, and update the Air Quality Management
Plan.
<LI>Achieve planned emission reductions through a compliance program
consisting of air quality monitoring, source testing, permit reviews,
education, inspections, and strategic use of penalties.
<LI>Increase public, business, and government knowledge of air
pollution issues and support for actions needed to attain local
, state, and federal air quality standards.
<LI>Develop and implement programs to promote mobile source emission
reductions.
<LI>Administer an efficient and cost-effective support organization
consistent with achieving clean air no later than the year 2010.
<LI>Facilitate development and transfer of new air quality-enhancing
technology.<BR>

</OL>

<P>
These goals are the foundation for the AQMD's Work Program. Each
goal is supported by multiple objectives which target specific
areas of program performance. A public hearing to receive input
on the FY 1996-97 Goals/Objectives has been set for February 9.
1996.<BR>
<BR>


<P>
<U>Program Categories<BR>
</U> 
<P>
The Work Program is organized into nine Program Categories, which
have been revised for FY 1996-97 to better describe the AQMDs
activities. These categories are:
<UL>
<LI>Policy Support
<LI>Monitor Air Quality
<LI>Develop Programs to Achieve Clean Air
<LI>Develop Rules to Achieve Clean Air
<LI>Advance Clean Air Technology
<LI>Timely Review of New Sources
<LI>Ensure Compliance with Clean Air Rules
<LI>Maintain a Program of Customer Service
<LI>Operational Support<BR>

</UL>

<P>
Each activity within the Work Program falls into one of the above
categories. The Work Program ties the goals and objectives of
the agency to each of its program activities, identifying resources,
performance measures/outputs and legal mandates. A complete description
of each program category along with a detailed work program sort
by program is included in the section on program categories. 
<BR>

<P>
The following table compares budgeted AQMD Work Program activities
by category for FY 1995-96 and projected for FY 1996-97 through
1998-99. <BR>

<IMG SRC="fin_tbl2.gif"><BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B><A NAME="program">Program</A><BR>
</CENTER><B> </B></B>
<P>
Developing solutions to the air quality problem involves highly
technical processes to meet the legal requirements of California
and federal laws. <BR>

<P>
<U>Monitoring<BR>
</U> 
<P>
The first step is simply to determine the smog problem by measuring
air pollution levels. AQMD today operates 35 monitoring stations
throughout its four-county jurisdiction. These range from full-service
stations that measure all criteria pollutants, as well as some
toxic pollutant levels, to those which measure fewer pollutants
in critical areas. These measurements provide the basis for our
knowledge about the nature of the air pollution problem and for
all planning to address this problem.<BR>

<P>
<U>Pollution Sources<BR>
</U> 
<P>
AQMD, in cooperation with ARB and SCAG, estimates the sources
of emissions causing the air pollution problem. Nature itself
causes a small portion of the emissions and must be considered.
In general, AQMD estimates stationary and natural sources of emissions.
SCAG develops the information necessary to estimate population
and traffic, and ARB develops the information necessary to estimate
mobile and area source emissions using the SCAG traffic data.
AQMD pulls this data together in the AQMP for use in developing
the necessary control strategies.<BR>

<P>
<U>Computer Modeling<BR>
</U> 
<P>
AQMD's planners take monitoring data and estimates of pollution
sources and enter it into state-of-the-art computer programs to
model the movement and peak locations of smog. Through a series
of &quot;what if&quot; questions, planners can look at different
control scenarios to determine what strategies best reduce air
pollution at the least cost.<BR>

<P>
Due to the nature of air pollution, these models can be very complex.
Some pollutants are not emitted directly into the air but are
products of photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. For example,
VOCs mix with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and &quot;cook&quot; in sunlight
to form ozone; similarly, nitrogen oxide gases from tailpipes
and smokestacks can be transformed into nitrates or particulates
(PM10). The planners thus must take into account the location
and size of each source, how the wind carries the emissions, how
different emissions react to one another once they are in the
atmosphere, and where the pollution is eventually carried. This
means considerable weather data must be collected along with the
emissions data.<BR>

<P>
<U>Planning<BR>
</U> 
<P>
With emissions data and an air quality model in place, planners
can develop possible control strategies and scenarios. As mentioned
earlier, for the most part, strategies to reduce driving are developed
by SCAG, while mobile source control standards are developed by
ARB. AQMD focuses most of its effort on stationary source controls.
<BR>

<P>
AQMD has taken a more proactive role in recent years trying to
persuade the EPA to adopt national standards to address sources
more appropriately within EPA's jurisdiction, such as interstate
trucks, trains, airplanes and ships. AQMD's concern is that any
emission reductions that are not made by these sources can only
be made up by those sources under its jurisdiction: local businesses.
<BR>

<P>
Once a plan of emission controls to achieve federal standards
is outlined, AQMD is required to hold multiple public meetings
to present the proposed control strategies and receive public
input. AQMD also must complete a socioeconomic analysis of the
control program. AQMD maintains an on-going, independent review
board of outside experts for both its air quality and socioeconomic
modeling.<BR>

<P>
To meet federal air quality standards, the 1994 AQMP calls for
significant reductions from 2010 projected baseline emissions:
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>71% for VOCs
<LI>55% for sulfur oxides
<LI>60% for carbon monoxide
<LI>75% for nitrogen dioxide
<LI>29% for directly emitted particulates<BR>

</UL>

<P>
These reductions, while meeting federal standards, will still
not result in attainment of all California air quality standards
since these are more stringent than federal standards. The attainment
plan is estimated to cost $5.4 billion dollars per year to achieve
and will provide $6.2 billion to $6.9 billion per year in health
benefits.<BR>

<P>
<U>Rulemaking<BR>
</U> 
<P>
The regulatory process, known as rulemaking, takes the concepts
of control measures outlined in the AQMP and turns them into proposed
rule language. This process involves: <BR>

<UL>
<LI>Extensive research on technology
<LI>Site inspections of affected industries to determine feasibility
<LI>Typically a year or more of public taskforce and workshop
meetings
<LI>In-depth analyses of environmental, social and economic impacts
<LI>Thorough review with appropriate Governing Board Committees
<BR>

</UL>

<P>
This extensive process of public and policymaker participation
encourages consensus in development of rule requirements so that
affected sources have an opportunity for input into the rules
which will regulate their operations. Once the requirements are
developed, the proposed rule, along with an environmental impact
report and a socioeconomic report, is presented to the Governing
Board at a public hearing. Public testimony is presented and considered
by the Board before any rule is adopted.<BR>

<P>
<U>Enforcement and Education<BR>
</U> 
<P>
The AQMD then issues permits to construct and operate equipment
to companies to ensure equipment is operated in compliance with
adopted rules. Follow-up inspections are made to ensure that equipment
is being operated under permit limitations.<BR>

<P>
As regulations have gradually encompassed medium and small businesses-where
the greatest growth in emissions is occurring-the AQMD observed
that permitting and enforcement strategies designed for large,
sophisticated industries simply didn't work for medium and small
businesses. Smaller businesses often face unique problems and
require more personal assistance and information. So, in November
1991, the AQMD launched its reform programs known as &quot;Keeping
the Clean Air Promise: New Directions in Air Quality Management.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
Under New Directions, all AQMD employees were given customer service
training, the issuance of permits was streamlined, and a greater
emphasis was placed on business assistance and education. Inspectors
now meet many business representatives in the classroom, rather
than in the courtroom, and teach them how to comply with AQMD
rules. Printing, dry cleaning, and other industry representatives
also have come to AQMD and provided our inspectors with training
so that staff is more familiar with their operations. AQMD underwrites
loans to help small businesses buy air pollution control equipment,
and actively works with businesses to help them comply with regulations.
So highly regarded were these New Direction reforms that the Legislature
incorporated them into a state law requiring all air districts
to implement them.<BR>

<P>
A key concept of New Directions was to develop market-based strategies
for reducing emissions. This concept culminated with the adoption
of the historic new program known as RECLAIM. This program gives
businesses the flexibility to seek out the least expensive ways
to reduce emissions, including the flexibility to buy emissions
reductions from another firm. Meanwhile, businesses that can reduce
emissions more than required have a financial incentive to do
so because they can sell their excess emissions reductions. It
is estimated that RECLAIM will save District businesses $58 million
annually compared to the traditional command-and-control rules
it replaces.<BR>

<P>
<U>Technical Innovation<BR>
</U> 
<P>
In the late 1980s, AQMD recognized that technological innovation,
as well as rule enforcement, would be necessary to achieve clean
air standards. So it created the Technology Advancement Office
to look for and encourage technical innovation to assist businesses
in reducing emissions, while maintaining or increasing production.
The Legislature supported this effort by providing a $1 surcharge
on every DMV registration fee paid within the District. These
funds have been matched at a ratio of approximately five-to-one
with funds from the private sector to develop new technologies,
such as electric and low-emission vehicles, low-NOx burners for
boilers and water heaters, zero-pollution paints and solvents,
fuel cells and other innovations. <BR>

<P>
An additional $4 vehicle registration fee was authorized by the
state legislature in 1990. These fees are administered through
AQMD with $1.20 going to AQMD, for mobile source emissions reductions,
$1.40 subvened directly to cities and counties to support their
air quality programs and $1.20 to the Mobile Source Review Committee.
This outside panel established by state law makes the decisions
on the actual projects to be funded from this portion of the revenue.
<BR>

<P>
<U>Public Education<BR>
</U> 
<P>
In the end, AQMD's efforts to clean up the air will be successful
only to the extent that the public understands air quality issues
and supports and participates in our cleanup effort. Thus, AQMD
undertakes to involve and inform the public through the Public
Advisor's Office, public meetings, publications, the press, and-to
the extent limited funds are available-free and paid public service
announcements.<BR>

<CENTER><B> <A NAME="budget">Budget</A><BR>
</CENTER><B> </B></B>
<P>
<U>Budget Process<BR>
</U> 
<P>
The AQMD has a comprehensive budget process which establishes
goals and objectives and monitors progress in meeting those goals
and objectives.<BR>

<P>
Up to and including the budget adoption hearing by AQMD's Governing
Board, the public and the business community have several opportunities
to participate in the budget process. The opportunities include:
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>four to five meetings of a budget advisory committee made
up of business and environmental representatives
<LI>three public workshops-two to discuss changes to the fee rule
and one to discuss the proposed budget
<LI>two public hearings-one on the Goals and Objectives and one
on the proposed budget<BR>

</UL>

<P>
A 1994 state law (Health and Safety Code Sections 40720,40721)
affects the AQMD budget and budget process in several ways. <BR>

<P>
AQMD is required to prepare and submit annually by February 1
to the ARB a Three-Year Budget Forecast. The forecast must be
reviewed by the state board with any comments or recommendations
submitted to the Legislature and AQMD by March 1. These recommendations,
if any, may then be incorporated by the AQMD into its budget.
<P>
The draft budget and fee projection for the ensuing fiscal year
must be prepared and made available to any person upon request
no later than the beginning of April of each year. Prior to May
15 of each year the AQMD Governing Board must adopt a final proposed
operating budget, including final fee schedules. <BR>

<P>
The approved final proposed operating budget must be submitted
to the Legislature and the ARB annually by May 15. <BR>

<P>
The final proposed operating budget submitted by the AQMD becomes
operative on July 1 unless, prior to July 1, the Legislature enacts
an urgency statute amending or supplementing the proposed AQMD
budget, or the AQMD adopts a revised final budget pursuant to
the state board review.<BR>

The following table compares program expenditures by office/division
for 1995-96 and forecasted for 1996-97 through 1998-99.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<IMG SRC="fin_tbl3.gif"><BR>

<P>
The forecasted expenditures for FY 1996-97 through 1998-99 represents
projected decreases of approximately $9.5 million over the three
year period. The AQMD is forecasting continued reductions in staffing
through attrition along with reductions in contracting as programs
relating to Title V and RECLAIM become implemented. Due to the
age or cost to repair many of the AQMD's fixed assets, a five-year
program to upgrade or replace obsolete equipment is expected to
be implemented.<BR>

<P>
The pie chart below represents expenditures by office/division
for FY 1995-96.<BR>

<IMG SRC="fin_img3.gif">
<P>
<U>Comparison of Revenues<BR>
</U> 
<P>
Each year, in order to meet its financial needs, the AQMD Governing
Board adopts a budget supported by a system of permit evaluation
fees, annual operating fees, emission fees, Hearing Board fees,
toxic hot spots fees, and transportation plan fees which currently
generate over $60.8 million, or about 64% of AQMD revenues. Other
sources which include contracts, penalties/settlements, investment,
and miscellaneous income generate approximately 6% of total revenues.
The remaining 30% of revenue will be received in the form of EPA
grants, ARB subvention, and California Clean Air Act motor vehicle
fees. AQMD does not receive any property tax money.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<IMG SRC="fin_img4.gif"><BR>

<P>
The following table compares 1995-96 revenues to the projected
revenues for 1996-97 through 1997-98.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<IMG SRC="fin_tbl4.gif"><BR>

<P>
Decreases in revenue from stationary sources are forecasted for
FY 1996-97 through 1998-99 due in large part to projected declines
in emissions of approximately 8% annually. In addition, the potential
loss in annual renewal revenue associated with approximately 4,400
portable internal combustion engines which may be regulated by
the State of California has been incorporated into the projections.
<BR>

<P>
At this time the revenue impacts of Rule 2202 are unknown. For
the purposes of this forecast, program revenues associated with
Transportation plan processing have not been adjusted. Any change
to plan processing revenues will be offset by corresponding adjustments
to the program costs associated with that activity. A more detailed
description of the various revenues is contained in a separate
section of the forecast.<BR>

<P>
<U>Fund Balance<BR>
</U> 
<P>
Following are the projected reserves and designations for FY 1995-96
and forecasted for the following three years.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<IMG SRC="fin_tbl5.gif"><BR>

<P>
Reserves and Encumbrances represent a portion of the fund balance
set aside for future use and are therefore not available for appropriation.
These reserve items represent the estimated amount of current
and prior years' unperformed purchase orders and contract commitments
(encumbrances) in process at year-end and the value at cost of
office, computer, cleaning and laboratory supplies on hand at
year-end. Designations in the fund balance indicates plans for
use of financial resources in future years. The AQMD is self-insured
for general liability, workers' compensation, automobile liability,
premises liability and unemployment. These designations have been
made to provide for unanticipated judgments against the AQMD which
exceed the budget. The designation for capital equipment replacement
is to provide funding for the periodic purchase of costly replacement
equipment or systems which have reached the end of their useful
life and are identified in the Equipment Replacement Plan.<BR>

<P>
As mentioned at the beginning of the section on revenues, the
AQMD receives approximately 64% of its total funding from stationary
sources. Approximately 39% of this funding is based on fees from
emissions. The dramatic decline in emissions in recent years,
while benefiting air quality, has seriously affected the AQMD's
ability to carry out its mandated programs. Emission fee revenues
are used to finance air monitoring, regional modeling, emission
inventory, public outreach, and rule development. In addition,
emission fees are used to subsidize the 50% permit processing
discount provided to small business. This heavy reliance on declining
emission fee revenues to cover basic programs has resulted in
significant budget shortfalls in recent years. In a two year period,
1990-91 and 1991-92, the AQMD expended 70% ($11,785,392) of its
available fund balance to offset drops in fee revenues. <BR>

<P>
Since that time the AQMD has taken steps to increase and maintain
an available fund balance sufficient to cover the uncertainties
in its revenue base. Those steps have included the implementation
of significant reductions in its budget, along with actions taken
to collect approximately $10 million in prior year emission fees
owed to the AQMD from refineries and RECLAIM companies.<BR>

<P>
The AQMD recently commissioned a Fee Assessment Study. One of
the tasks was to explore funding options available to the AQMD
in an effort to solve the structural problems inherent in its
financing authority. Several recommendations were made, some of
which would require legislative changes to implement. The AQMD
will continue to seek further opportunities to reduce costs and
improve efficiency prior to proposing any of the study's recommendations.

AND ASSUMPTIONS</CENTER> </B></U>
<P>
<U><B>Emission Fees</B></U> 
<P>
This program was initiated in January of 1978. The fee is based
on the tons of emissions from sources that emit four tons or more
a year of the following contaminants: organic gases, specific
organics, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, and
particulate matter. In addition, a fee-per-pound is assessed on
the following toxic compounds and ozone depleters: asbestos, benzene,
cadmium, carbon tetrachloride, hexavalent chromium, chlorinated
dioxides and dibenzofurans, ethylene dibromide, ethylene dichloride,
ethylene oxide, methylene chloride, perchloroethylene, formaldehyde,
nickel, chlorofluorocarbons, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane. The fees
for these contaminants are established in AQMD Rule 301.
<P>
On January 1, 1994 the REgional CLean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM)
began. RECLAIM, a market incentive air pollution reduction program
for nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx), provides greater
certainty in meeting public health standards while allowing industry
to seek the most cost-effective solution to reduce their emissions.
Major stationary sources with NOx and SOx emissions generally
greater than four tons per year are a part of RECLAIM and receive
an emissions cap for RECLAIM pollutants and an annual rate of
reduction. The emissions cap less the accumulated annual rates
of reduction is expressed as RECLAIM Trading Credits (RTCs); an
RTC is a limited authorization to emit a RECLAIM pollutant at
a facility. Each RTC has a denomination of one pound and a term
of one year. A RECLAIM facility pays a emissions-based fee on
RTCs used. The holder of unused RTCs may transfer or sell them
to another party.
<P>
Emissions are expected to decline at an average rate of approximately
eight percent per year, which translates into a projection for
lower emission fees each fiscal year.
<P>
<U><B>Annual Renewal</B></U> 
<P>
The Lewis-Presley Clean Air Act requires the AQMD to have an annual
permit renewal program. The AQMD initiated this program in February
of 1977. This program requires that all active permits be renewed
on an annual basis. The annual renewal rates, based on complexity
of equipment, are established in AQMD Rule 301.
<P>
The economic downturn has resulted in fewer new equipment applications
filed and fewer permit renewals. Many of the Air Quality Management
Plan (AQMP) control measures still to be implemented will not
bring new equipment into the permit system but instead will be
directed toward existing equipment not subject to RECLAIM, indirect
sources, and consumer products. The economic outlook is expected
to slowly improve, with only a slight growth in the number of
new/expanding small sources expected in each of the three years
in the budget forecast period. However, beginning Fiscal Year
1997-98, this slight increase is offset by the potential loss
of annual renewal revenue from approximately 4,400 portable internal
combustion engines that may be regulated by the State of California.
<P>
<U><B>Permit Processing Fees</B></U> 
<P>
Permits are the vehicle the AQMD uses to ensure that equipment
in the AQMD's jurisdictional boundaries is in compliance with
AQMD Rules and Regulations. Permit processing fees are assessed
according to a equipment/process based system. Each applicant,
at the time of filing, pays a permit processing fee that includes
normal evaluation of the application. Although additional permit
processing fee revenues will be generated over the next three
fiscal years as a result of the implementation of Title V, the
increase in revenue will be offset by privatizing a portion of
the permit processing function; by a decrease in the number of
applications received for portable internal combustion engines
as a result of regulation of these engines by the State of California;
and by the anticipated expansion of the permit registration program,
which has a lower fee than the normal permit processing fee.
<P>
<U><B>Air Resources Board Subvention</B></U> 
<P>
The State appropriates moneys each year to subvene local air quality
districts. The amount awarded is based on population. Funding
from this source for the next three fiscal years is expected to
remain at a level equivalent to the amount budgeted in Fiscal
Year 1995-96.
<P>
<U><B>Environmental Protection Agency Grant</B></U> 
<P>
The purpose of the Section 105 Grant is to help support the AQMD
in its administration of an active air quality control program.
This grant, like State subvention, requires the AQMD to perform
certain agreed-upon activities. In recent years, in addition to
the base grant, several supplemental grants were awarded for specific
projects. Work on these specific projects will be completed, and
the amount awarded in each of the next three fiscal years is expected
to be only the base grant The AQMD anticipates performing approximately
the same level of agree-upon activities in each of the forecast
years; therefore, revenue over the next three fiscal years is
expected to remain constant.
<P>
<U><B>Interest</B></U> 
<P>
Revenue from this source is the result of investing the AQMD's
cash balances. Interest rates are expected to remain low as the
economy slowly improves.
<P>
<U><B>Source Test/Analysis Fees</B></U> 
<P>
In 1987 the AQMD amended Rule 304 Analysis Fees to recover some
of the costs associated with source testing in the basin. In December
1991 the AQMD again amended Rule 304; the rule now specifies that
no fees shall be assessed for laboratory analyses of certain materials
when submitted by AQMD compliance personnel in order to determine
compliance with applicable AQMD rules. Currently, a separate source
test fee is not charged for initial sampling of emissions secured
from sources. A source test fee is charged for the second and
any subsequent tests performed to confirm compliance. It is anticipated
that twenty percent of the initial source tests will require a
retest to confirm compliance.
<P>
Revenue in this category includes source test fees, laboratory
test fees, test protocol reviews, continuous emissions monitoring
systems (CEMS) evaluations, and continuous process monitoring
systems (CPMS) evaluations. Revenue is expected to decrease over
the next three fiscal years as the number of CEMS evaluations
decreases.
<P>
<U><B>Hearing Board</B></U> 
<P>
The revenue from this source results from excess emission fee
charges and the filing of petitions for variances. Revenue from
this source is expected to remain constant over the next three
fiscal years.
<P>
<U><B>Penalties/Settlements</B></U> 
<P>
The revenue from this source is derived from violations being
handled civilly versus criminally. Although it is expected that
there will continue to be a strong reliance on creative penalties,
this revenue is expected to decrease slightly over the next three
fiscal years.
<P>
<U><B>Mobile Sources/Clean Fuels</B></U> 
<P>
Section 9250.11 of the Vehicle Code gives the Department of Motor
Vehicles (DMV) authority to collect and forward to the AQMD money
for clean fuels programs and transportation control measures.
One dollar is collected by DMV for every vehicle registered in
the AQMD's jurisdictional boundaries.
<P>
In addition, section 9250.17 of the Vehicle Code gives the DMV
authority to collect and forward to the AQMD four dollars for
every vehicle registered in the AQMD's jurisdictional boundaries.
Thirty percent of the money collected is recognized in the AQMD's
general fund as mobile sources revenue and is used for programs
to reduce air pollution from motor vehicles and to carry out related
planning, monitoring, enforcement, and technical studies authorized
by, or necessary to implement, the California Clear Air Act of
1988 or the Air Quality Management Plan. Forty percent of the
money collected is deposited into the Air Quality Improvement
Fund and distributed to cities and counties in the AQMD's jurisdictional
boundaries, based on their prorated share of population, to implement
programs to reduce air pollution from motor vehicles. The remaining
thirty percent of the money collected is deposited into the Mobile
Sources Air Pollution Reduction Fund and is used to fund projects
developed and adopted by a Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction
Review Committee and approved by the AQMD's Governing Board; these
projects implement or monitor programs to reduce air pollution
from motor vehicles.
<P>
Revenue projections are based on current vehicle registration
data from the DMV. As the economy starts to slowly improve, the
number of vehicles registered in the AQMD's jurisdictional boundaries
is expected to increase over the next three fiscal years. Revenue
will increase accordingly.
<P>
<U><B>SEDAB Contract</B></U> 
<P>
The Lewis-Presley Clean Air Act allows the AQMD to contract for
providing specific air pollution control services in the Southeast
Desert Air Basin (SEDAB). For many years the AQMD contracted with
the County of San Bernardino. Then, the Mojave Desert Air Quality
Management District (MDAQMD) was formed with jurisdiction over
the Southeast Desert Air Basin. Over the next three fiscal years,
it is expected the AQMD will continue to provide services to the
MDAQMD at the level budgeted in Fiscal Year 1995-96.
<P>
<U><B>Subscriptions</B></U> 
<P>
The AQMD receives money from operating a subscription service
for new proposed rules and amended rules. Also, the sales of AQMD
Rules and Regulations are recorded here. Revenue from this source
is expected to remain constant over the next three fiscal years.
<P>
<U><B>Transportation Programs</B></U> 
<P>
In late 1987 the AQMD adopted Regulation XV setting forth the
actions employers who employ one hundred or more persons at any
work site must take to promote employee participation in trip
reduction and rideshare programs. Since that time the AQMD received
revenue from the fees associated with the filing, processing,
and review of the trip reduction plans. However, effective January
1, 1996 state law prohibits the requirement that facilities submit
trip reduction plans.
<P>
As a result of the upcoming change in state law, AQMD Rule 2202
was adopted by the Governing Board in December 1995. Rule 2202
replaces Rule 1501 and Rule 1501.1. Although Rule 2202 allows
employers who choose to do so to continue to file trip reduction
plans, the Rule includes a menu of alternatives available to employers
to reduce or mitigate emissions from employee commutes. It is
unknown at this time how many employers will choose to continue
to file trip reduction plans and how many will choose to participate
in alternative methods of emission reductions. Therefore, at this
time the Three-Year Budget Forecast assumption is that Rule 2202
will generate approximately the same level of revenue that was
generated by Rule 1501 and Rule 1501.1.
<P>
<U><B>Toxic &quot;Hot Spots&quot;</B></U> 
<P>
Health and Safety Code Section 44380 requires the AQMD to assess
and collect fees from facilities that emit toxic compounds. Fees
collected are used to recover state and AQMD costs to collect
and analyze data regarding air toxics and their effect on the
public. Costs, and fees to recover these costs, are expected to
decrease over the next three fiscal years as toxic substances
are phased out.
<P>
<U><B>Miscellaneous</B></U> 
<P>
The revenue here is derived from several sources including professional
services the AQMD renders to other agencies, witness fees, jury
duty fees, the sale of photocopies and data, laboratory approval
program fees, source education class fees, Public Records Act
requests, and certified permit program fees. This revenue is expected
to remain fairly constant over the next three fiscal years.
<P>
<A NAME="expenditure"></A><CENTER><U><B>EXPENDITURE ACCOUNTS</CENTER>
</B></U>
<P>
The program costs used in the Three-Year Budget Forecast are based
on office/division averages for salary, benefits, supplies, and
capital expenditures. An AQMD overhead cost has been applied to
each office/division based on the number of Full Time Equivalent
(FTE) positions projected. An FTE position represents a person
year. Where divisional program outputs have been defined, such
that a specific capital expenditure or service (contract) can
be identified, these expenditures are applied to the output and
are not included in the office/division average.
<P>
Following is a description of each of the AQMD's major expenditure
accounts and the assumptions used to make the Three-Year Budget
Forecast.
<P>
<U><B>Salaries and Employee Benefits</B></U> 
<P>
The cost associated with salary, retirement, and medical insurance
coverage is recorded in this group of accounts. Costs will decrease
proportionately to the attrition rate during the next three years.
<P>
<U><B>Insurance</B></U> 
<P>
This account includes: excess liability, property, earthquake,
rental income and public official liability coverage. The AQMD
is self-insured for workers' compensation, general and auto liability.
Expenditures are anticipated to remain relatively level over the
next three years.
<P>
<U><B>Rent Expense</B></U> 
<P>
The AQMD rents/leases both equipment and structures. Equipment
leases include: photocopiers, large computers, laboratory and
atmospheric measurement equipment. Structures include: permitting
and compliance field offices and air monitoring stations. As areas
within the AQMD's jurisdiction reach attainment, costs for measurement
equipment are expected to decrease beginning with the third year
of the forecast.
<P>
<U><B>Supplies</B></U> 
<P>
This group of accounts includes: Household Expense, Public Notices,
Demurrage, Clothing, Laboratory Supplies, Postage, Office Expense,
Office Furniture, Subscription and Books, Small Tools, Film, Gasoline
and Oil, and Miscellaneous Expenses. These expenditures are expected
to decrease slightly in response to the attrition rate for each
of the three years of the forecast.
<P>
<U><B>Contract and Special Services</B></U> 
<P>
This account encompasses a wide variety of professional services.
Included here are many services provided to the AQMD such as:
employee relations litigation, physical and medical services,
security guard services, court reporting services, printing, temporary
help, financial audits and bank services. In addition, the AQMD
has the need to contract for unique or one-time services such
as the Economic Development and Business Retention Program and
the Emission-Based Deployment Program. Expenditures in FY 1996-97
decrease from the base year as employee litigation costs related
to the layoff decline, as the migration of programs to a new computer
is completed, and as costs associated with the toxics emissions
program decrease. Increased expenditures in FY 1997-98 included
a triennial performance audit required by state law, transportation
programs to reduce or mitigate employee commute emissions, and
enhancement of the facility permit and RECLAIM systems. Decreases
in FY 1998-99 include completion of permit streamlining, a decrease
in work related to toxics emissions, and a decrease in work related
to facility permits.
<P>
<U><B>Maintenance</B></U> 
<P>
Included here are the costs associated with maintaining AQMD equipment
and buildings such as computer and communications equipment, lab
and air monitoring equipment, and mobile source test vehicles.
As areas within the AQMD's jurisdiction reach attainment, costs
for maintenance of air monitoring equipment are expected to decrease
beginning with the third year of the forecast.
<P>
<U><B>Travel and Auto Expense</B></U> 
<P>
This group of accounts includes local and out-of-basin travel
and the cost of maintaining the AQMD's vehicle fleet. A decrease
is anticipated due to the attrition rate for each of the three
years forecasted.
<P>
<U><B>Utilities</B></U> 
<P>
This account is used to pay utility costs at the AQMD's air monitoring
stations, its headquarters building, and the South Bay field office.
Expenditures are expected to decrease over the next three years
due to some attainment, the transition from field offices to one-stop
permitting offices, and attrition.
<P>
<U><B>Communications</B></U> 
<P>
Included here are the costs associated with telephone use, access
to technical and legal information systems, and the 800 prefix
citizen complaint and air quality information lines. Expenditures
are anticipated to remain relatively level over the next three
years.
<P>
<U><B>Interest Expense</B></U> 
<P>
This account is used to pay the interest due on the installment
sale revenue bonds for the Diamond Bar location and the pension
obligation refunding bonds. Expenditures are anticipated to remain
relatively level over the next three years.
<P>
<U><B>Capital Outlays</B></U> 
<P>
Equipment purchases which cost greater than $1,500 or are otherwise
defined as a fixed asset are included here. Historically, this
account has included such items as vehicles, car radios, air monitoring
equipment, lab equipment, personal computers, and office furniture.
Expenditures are anticipated to increase over the next three years
as older, obsolete monitoring equipment are replaced and as computer
systems are upgraded to meet the requirements of RECLAIM and toxics.

<P>
A resolution of the South Coast Air Quality Management District
(District) Hearing Board establishing procedures for a Consent
Calendar.
<P>
<B>WHEREAS</B>, the Hearing Board finds that establishing formal
procedures implementing a Consent Calendar procedure will facilitate
the orderly and efficient conduct of the Hearing Board's daily
calendar;
<P>
<B>WHEREAS,</B> the Hearing Board finds that the Consent Calendar
is a procedure for expediting the presentation of evidence at
hearings where the petitioner and the respondent have stipulated
to the facts;
<P>
<B>WHEREAS</B>, the Hearing Board finds that (a) evidence in Consent
Calendar matters shall be submitted by declarations, stipulations
and verified petitions by either party to the Hearing Board before
the hearing; (b) in addition to submitting declarations, the petitioner
shall submit proposed conditions and findings of fact and law
to the Hearing Board before the scheduled hearing, unless another
time is stipulated to by all parties and agreed to by the Board;
and (c) in all other respects, a Consent Calendar proceeding must
comply with the requirements set forth in the California Health
and Safety Code and the District Rules and Regulations which govern
variances and orders for abatement.
<P>
<B>WHEREAS, </B>the Hearing Board finds that the special requirements
for Consent Calendar matters are as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(1) After submitting a petition as required in District Rules
502(b) and 803, the hearing can be placed on the Consent Calendar
when stipulated to by the District's Executive Officer (represented
by the attorney from the District's Chief Prosecutor's Office
assigned to handle the proceeding) and the other party.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(2) Petitioner shall request respondent's stipulation to the Consent
Calendar process by submitting copies of witness declaration(s)
signed under penalty of perjury, any proposed condition(s), and
proposed findings of fact and law to the responding party at least
five (5) working days before the scheduled hearing date. The respondent
may waive any portion of the requirements of this paragraph.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(3) The responding party shall respond to a request to place the
matter on the Consent Calendar, in writing to the petitioner,
no later than three (3) working days prior to the scheduled hearing.
Upon stipulation of the responding party, petitioner shall file
a final copy of the signed stipulation, the declaration(s), any
proposed condition(s), and proposed findings of law and fact with
the Hearing Board at least two (2) working days before the scheduled
hearing date, unless some other time is stipulated to by all parties
and agreed to by the Hearing Board.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED</B> that the Hearing Board hereby
adopts the following Consent Calendar process:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(a) The Hearing Board shall receive any public testimony of a
Consent Calendar matter before the case is submitted.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(b) The Hearing Board's proceedings on a Consent Calendar matter
shall in all respects conform to the requirements set forth in
the California Health and Safety Code and the District Rules and
Regulations, except the Hearing Board shall base its ruling on
the stipulations and declarations submitted by the parties and
any public testimony received at the scheduled hearing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(c) At any time prior to the submission of the case, the Hearing
Board shall remove a matter from the Consent Calendar upon the
written or oral motion of the respondent or the petitioner, or
any Hearing Board member, and reschedule the matter to the next
available hearing date. If prior to the submission of the case,
a member of the public requests removal of a matter from the Consent
Calendar, the Hearing Board shall consider the reasons for the
request, and vote on the request prior to going forward with the
item on the Consent Calendar.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(d) The Hearing Board will not accept any matter for the Consent
Calendar that involves harm to the public health or any other
potential nuisance.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(e) The Hearing Board will provide copies of all documents relating
to the Consent Calendar item upon request.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>RULE 303. HEARING BOARD FEES</B>
<P>
<B>(a) Filing Fees</B>
<BR>
Every applicant or petitioner in a proceeding before the Hearing
Board except a small business shall pay to the Clerk or Deputy
Clerk, at the time of filing, a filing fee of $136.20 for each
petition.  Small businesses shall pay the fee specified in subdivision
(j).
<P>
<B>(b) Filing Fee Refunds</B>
<OL>
<LI>In the event the Hearing Board reverses the decision of the
Executive Officer in an appeal from denial or a conditional
approval of a permit to construct or a permit to operate, the
filing fee specified in subdivision (a) shall be refunded to the
petitioner.
<P>
<LI>In the event that the petition is withdrawn, and the petitioner
notifies the Clerk of the Hearing Board in writing not less than
four days prior to the scheduled appearance, or the hearing is
not held for any other reason, the petitioner shall be entitled
to a refund of fifty percent (50%) of the filing fee.
</OL>
<B>(c) Daily Appearance Fee</B>
<OL>
<LI>In addition to the filing fee, each petitioner or applicant
with a proceeding (designated by a case number) before the Hearing
Board shall pay a daily appearance fee of $407.60/day.  In addition
to the initial appearance, this fee is applicable to all following
appearances which pertain to the same proceeding (designated by
case number).  After the initial appearance, the daily appearance
fee shall be waived for any appearance (pertaining to the same
proceeding) which has a duration of less than one hour.
<P>
<LI>The respondent shall pay the daily appearance fee of $407.60
regardless of the duration of the Hearing, when requesting a modification
to an order for abatement.
<P>
<LI>If a petition before the Hearing Board is included on the consent calendar, fifty percent (50%) of the daily appearance fee of $407.60 shall be due.  In the event an item is removed from the consent calendar and an additional appearance is required, the full daily appearance fee shall be due.
<P>
<LI>Payment of these fees shall be in accordance to procedures
specified in subdivision (n).
</OL>
<B>(d) Publication Fees</B>
<BR>
Upon demand and in addition to the payment of the foregoing fees,
every petitioner for relief which requires published notice shall
pay a fee to cover the actual cost of publication(s) of notice
of hearing.
<P>
<B>(e) Excess Emission Fee</B>
<OL>
<LI>Each applicant or petitioner for a variance from these Rules
and Regulations shall pay to the Clerk or Deputy Clerk of the
Hearing Board, in addition to the filing fees required in subdivision
(a) and the daily appearance fees required in subdivision (c),
an emission fee based on the total weight of emissions discharged, per source or product, other than those described in subdivision (f) below, during the variance period in excess of that allowed by these rules in accordance with the schedule set
forth in Table I.  If the amount of the excess emission fee is less than that specified in subdivision (g), the applicant or petitioner shall pay the higher amount.
<P>
<LI>Where the total weight of emission discharged cannot be easily
calculated, the petitioner shall work in concert with District
staff to establish the amount of excess emissions to be paid.
 In cases where District staff determines calculations or estimations
cannot be made, the petitioner shall pay the amount set forth
in subdivision (g).
<P>
<LI>In the event that more than one rule limiting the discharge
of the same contaminant is violated, the excess emission fee shall
consist of the fee for violation which will result in the payment
of the greatest sum.  For the purposes of this subdivision, opacity
rules and particulate mass emissions shall not be considered rules
limiting the discharge of the same contaminant.
</OL>
<B>(f) Excess Visible Emission Fee</B>
<BR>
Each applicant or petitioner for a variance from Rule 401 or Health
and Safety Code Section 41701 shall pay to the Clerk or Deputy
Clerk of the Hearing Board, in addition to the filing fees required
in (a) above, the daily appearance fee required in (c), and the
excess emission fees required in (e) above (if any), an emission
fee based on the difference between the percent opacity allowed
by Rule 401 and the percent opacity of the emissions allowed from
the source or sources operating under the variance, in accordance
with the schedule set forth in Table II.
<BR>
In the event that an applicant or petitioner is exempt from the
provisions of Rule 401, the applicant or petitioner shall pay
a fee calculated as described hereinabove, but such fee shall
be calculated based upon the difference between the opacity allowed
under the variance and the opacity allowed under the provisions
of Health and Safety Code Section 41701, in accordance with the
schedule set forth in Table II.
<P>
<B>(g) Minimum Excess Emission Fees</B>
<BR>
When a variance is granted from a rule or rules which limit the
discharge of air contaminants, such that an excess emission fee
is due, an excess emission fee shall be imposed and remitted.
 The excess emission fee remitted, regardless of calculations,
will be no less than $21.50 per day, per source.
<P>
<B>(h) Applicability</B>
<BR>
The provisions of subdivision (e) shall apply only to those rules
or permit conditions that specify quantitative emission limits.
<P>
<B>(i) Fee Determination</B>
<OL>
<LI>The excess emission fees shall be calculated by the petitioner
based upon the requested number of days of operation under variance
multiplied by the expected excess emissions as set forth in subdivisions
(e) and (f) above.  The calculations and proposed fees shall be
set forth in the petition.
<P>
<LI>The Hearing Board may adjust the excess emission fee required
by subdivisions (e) and (f) of this rule based on evidence regarding
emissions presented at the time of the hearing.
</OL>
<B>(j) Small Businesses</B>
<OL>
<LI>A small business shall pay a filing fee of $81.90.  The petitioner
shall be assessed twenty percent (20%) of the fees required by subdivisions
(c), (e), and (f), or (g), whichever is applicable.  &quot;Small
business&quot; is defined in Rule 102, Small Business.
<P>
<LI>Request for exception as a small business shall be made by
the petitioner under penalty of perjury on a declaration form
provided by the Executive Officer which shall be submitted
to the Clerk or Deputy Clerk of the Hearing Board at the time
of filing a petition for variance.
</OL>
<B>(k) Group Variance Fees</B>
<OL>
<LI>Each petitioner included in a petition for a group variance
shall pay the filing fee specified in subdivision (a), and the
excess emission fees specified in subdivisions (e), and (f), or
(g), whichever is applicable.
<P>
<LI>The Daily Appearance Fee required by subdivision (c) and the
Publication Fee required by subdivision (d) shall be totaled and
divided equally among the petitioners.
</OL>
<B>(l) Adjustment of Fees</B>
<BR>
If after the term of a variance for which emission fees have been paid, petitioner can establish, to the satisfaction of the Executive Officer, that emissions were actually
less than those upon which the fee was based, a pro rata refund shall be made.
<P>
<B>(m) Emission Fee Refunds</B>
<BR>
In the event that the petition is withdrawn or the variance is not granted, petitioner shall be entitled to a full refund of the unused excess emission fees.
<P>
<B>(n) Fee Payment/Variance Invalidation</B>
<OL>
<LI>Excess emission fees required by subdivisions (e), (f), and
(g), based on an estimate provided during the variance Hearing,
are due and payable within fifteen (15) days of the granting of
the variance.  The petitioner shall be notified in writing of
any adjustment to the amount of excess emission fees due, following
District staff's verification of the estimated emissions.  Fee
payments to be made as a result of an adjustment are due and payable
within fifteen (15) days of notification of the amount due.
<P>
<LI>Daily appearance fees and publication fees required in subdivisions
(c) and (d), respectively, are due and payable within fifteen
(15) days of notification of the amount due.  Petitioners shall
be notified in writing of the amount due.
<P>
<LI>Failure to pay the excess emission fees required by subdivisions
(e), (f), (g), publication fees required by subdivision (d), and
daily appearance fees required in subdivision (c) of this rule
within fifteen (15) days of notification that a fee is due shall
automatically invalidate the variance.  Such notification may
be given by personal service or by deposit, postpaid, in the United
States mail and shall be due fifteen (15) days from the date of
personal service or mailing.  For the purpose of this rule, the
fee payment shall be considered to be received by the District
if it is postmarked by the United States Postal Service on or
before the expiration date stated on the billing notice.  If the
expiration date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a state holiday,
the fee payment may be postmarked on the next business day following
the Saturday, Sunday, or the state holiday with the same effect
as if it had been postmarked on the expiration date.  
</OL>
<B>(o) Request for Time Extension of Payment Due</B>
<BR>
Whenever this rule requires fees to be paid by a certain date,
in order to avoid invalidation of a variance or refusal of acceptance
of other petitions, the petitioner may, for good cause, request
the Executive Officer to grant an extension of time,
not to exceed ninety (90) days, within which the fees shall be
paid.  Any request for extension of time shall be presented in
writing, and accompanied by a statement of reasons why the extension
should be granted.
<P>
<B>(p) Discretionary Powers</B>
<BR>
Any person may allege that payment of any of the fees within this
rule, excluding publication fees, will cause an unreasonable hardship
and may be excused from payment of such fees or a portion of such
fees by order of the Hearing Board if the Board in its discretion
determines after hearing evidence thereon that payment of such
fees would cause financial or other unreasonable hardship to the
petitioner.
<P>
<B>(q) Transcript Fees</B>
<BR>
Any person requesting a transcript of the hearing shall pay the
cost of such transcript.  The parties to hearings and prehearing
proceedings may be directed by the Hearing Board to pay the cost
of transcripts necessary for the Hearing Board's determination
of the matter, in such proportion as the Hearing Board may order.
<P>
<B>(r) Government Agencies</B>
<OL>
<LI> This rule shall not apply to petitions filed by the Executive
Officer.
<P>
<LI> Federal, state or local government agencies or public districts
shall pay all fees.
</OL>
<B>(s) Waiver of Fees</B>
<P>
All fees associated with this rule shall be waived for any petition
for a variance filed as the result of any event declared to be
a &quot;state of emergency&quot; by the local, state, or federal
authorities.

<P>

<PRE>
For each source with opacity emissions in excess of twenty percent (20%),
but less than forty percent (40%) (where the source is in violation of
Rule 401), the fee is calculated as follows:
<P>
    Fee = (Opacity* equivalent - 20)  x  number of days allowed in
          variance  x  $1.08.
<P>
For each source with opacity emissions in excess of forty percent (40%)
(where the source is in violation of Rule 401 and California Health
and Safety Code Section 41701), the fee is calculated as follows:
<P>
    Fee = (Opacity* equivalent - 40)  x  number of days allowed by
          variance  x  $1.08.
<P>
*   <FONT SIZE=2>Where &quot;Opacity&quot; equals maximum opacity of emissions in percent (not decimal 
equivalent) allowed by the variance. Where the emissions are darker than the degree 
of darkness equivalent to the allowed Ringelmann number, the percentage equivalent 
of the excess degree of darkness shall be used as &quot;opacity.&quot;

be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible
persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs,
regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule
which might make improper the admission of such evidence over
objection in civil actions. Hearsay evidence may be used for the
purpose of supplementing or explaining any direct evidence but
shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless
it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. The rules
of privilege shall be effective to the same extent that they are
now, or hereafter may be, recognized in civil actions, and irrelevant
and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.

<H2>RULE 515. FINDINGS AND DECISION </H2>

<P>
(a) No variance shall be granted unless the Hearing Board makes
all the following findings:
<P>
<ol>
<li>That the petitioner is or will be in violation of any rule,
regulation or order of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District Government Board or applicable section of the California
State Health and Safety Code.
<P>
<li>That due to conditions beyond the reasonable control of the
petitioner, requiring compliance would result in either:
<P>
(A) An arbitrary or unreasonable taking of property, or
<P>
(B) The practical closing and elimination of a lawful business.
<P>
<li>That such closing or taking would be without a corresponding
benefit in reducing air contaminants.
<P>
<li>That the applicant for the variance has given consideration
to curtailing operations of the source in lieu of obtaining a
variance.
<P>
<li>During the period the variance is in effect, that the applicant
will reduce excess emissions to the maximum extent feasible.
<P>
<li>During the period the variance is in effect, that the applicant
will monitor or otherwise quantify emission levels from the source,
if requested to do so by the district, and report these emission
levels to the district pursuant to a schedule established by the
district.
<P>
</ol>
(b)
<ol>
<li>In determining whether or not the petitioner has presented
evidence sufficient to make the finding specified in Health and
Safety Code Section 42352(b) and Rule 515 (a)(2), the Hearing
Board shall consider, in addition to any other relevant factors,
both of the following:
<P>
(A) In determining whether or not conditions exist which are beyond
the reasonable control of the petitioner, the Hearing Board shall
consider whether or not the petitioner took actions to comply
or seek a variance which were timely and reasonable under the
circumstances. In so doing, the Board shall consider actions taken
by the petitioner since the adoption of the rule from which the
variance is sought.
<P>
(B) In determining whether or not requiring compliance would result
in either an arbitrary or unreasonable taking of property or the
practical closing and elimination of a lawful business, the Hearing
Board shall consider whether or not an unreasonable burden would
be imposed upon the petitioner if immediate compliance is required.
<P>
<li>If the petitioner is a small business as defined in paragraph
(3), the Hearing Board shall consider the factors specified in
paragraph (b)(1) as follows:
<P>
<blockquote>
(A) (i) In determining whether or not the petitioner took timely
actions to comply or seek a variance, the Hearing Board shall
make specific inquiry into, the reasons for any inaction, including
the bases for any claimed ignorance of the requirements from which
a variance is sought; and,
<P>
(ii) In determining whether or not the petitioner took reasonable
actions to comply, the Hearing Board shall make specific inquiry
into the petitioner's financial and other capabilities to comply.
<P>
</blockquote>
(B) In determining whether or not the burden of requiring immediate
compliance would be unreasonable, the Hearing Board shall make
specific inquiry into the impact to the petitioner's business
and the benefit to the environment which would result if the petitioner
was required to immediately comply.
<P>
<li>For purposes of this subdivision, the term &quot;small business&quot;
shall have the same meaning as set forth in Rule 102, except that
no source which emits four tons or more per year of any nonattainment
air contaminant or its precursor shall be a small business.
<P>
</ol>
(c) The decision shall be reduced to writing, served and filed
within 30 days after submission of the cause by the parties thereto,
and shall contain a brief statement of facts found to be true,
the determination of the issues presented, findings, and the order
of the Hearing Board. A copy shall be mailed or delivered to the
Executive Officer, the petitioner, and to every person who has
filed pleadings or who has appeared as a party in person or by
counsel at the hearing. A copy of any decision granting, modifying,
or otherwise affecting a variance shall be mailed to the State
Air Resources Board within 30 days after the effective date of
the decision.
<P>
(d) Formal written Findings and Decision of the Hearing Board
shall be prepared by the Hearing Board unless otherwise directed
by order of the Hearing Board.
<P>
(e) Whenever parties are directed to prepare the Findings and
Decision of the Hearing Board, the Findings and Decision shall
be submitted to the Hearing Board within 15 days after the date
of the hearing. The Chairman of the Hearing Board may, upon a
request by the preparer of the Findings and Decision, grant an

Findings and Decision shall be approved by the opposing party.
When parties cannot agree to the form of the Findings and Decision,

a variance from the District Hearing Board may obtain approval
of an Alternative Operating Condition that would be recognized
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Hearing
Board approval of an Alternative Operating Condition pursuant

stated in pounds per month, which exceeds the amount of emissions
that would be allowed if the source were operated in compliance
with an applicable requirement, calculated pursuant to paragraph
(h)(1) of this rule.
<P>
<LI>FACILITY means any permit unit or source, or grouping of permit
units or sources, or other air contaminant-emitting activities
which are located on one or more contiguous properties within
the District, in actual physical contact or separated solely by
a public roadway or other public right-of-way, and are owned or
operated by the same person (or by persons under common control),
or an outer continental shelf (OCS) source as defined in 40 CFR
Section 55.2. Such above-described groupings, if on noncontiguous
properties, but connected only by land carrying a pipeline, shall
not be considered one facility. Equipment or installations involved
in crude oil and gas production in Southern California coastal
or OCS waters, and transport of such crude oil and gas in Southern
California coastal or OCS waters, shall be included in the same
facility which is under the same ownership or use entitlement
as the crude oil and gas facility on shore.

Hearing Board shall consider whether or not requiring immediate
compliance would impose an unreasonable burden upon an essential
public service. For purposes of this subparagraph, &quot;essential

during this period.
<P>
</OL>
(g) Content of Alternative Operating Conditions
<P>
Each Alternative Operating Condition shall contain the following
provisions, as applicable: <BR>

<OL>
<LI>Emission Limits <BR>
If an Alternative Operating Condition allows emissions that are
greater than an emission limit in an applicable requirement, the
Hearing Board shall establish an enforceable alternative emission
limit which requires the source to reduce excess emissions to
the maximum extent feasible. The Hearing Board may establish an
alternative emission limit for any source located at the facility
which creates emissions of the subject pollutant that may feasibly
be reduced.
<P>
<LI>Operational Requirements <BR>
If an Alternative Operating Condition allows deviation from an
applicable operational requirement which is designed to limit
or minimize emissions, the Hearing Board shall establish an enforceable
alternative operational requirement or emission limit which requires
the source to operate in a manner that reduces excess emissions
to the maximum extent feasible. The Hearing Board may establish
an alternative operational requirement or emission limit for any
source located at the facility which creates emissions of the
subject pollutant that may feasibly be reduced.
<P>
<LI>Monitoring, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Requirements
<BR>
If the Alternative Operating Condition allows deviation from an
applicable emissions monitoring, recordkeeping or reporting requirement,
the Hearing Board shall establish an enforceable alternative requirement
which, to the extent feasible:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(A) mandates quantification, recordkeeping, and reporting
of emissions as accurately, expeditiously, and verifiably as the
applicable requirement,
<BR>
(B) complies with the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of
Rule 3004 - Permit Type and Content, and
<BR>
(C) for RECLAIM sources, complies with the RECLAIM protocols
for monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>Conditions<BR>
The Hearing Board shall impose conditions, other than those imposed
by applicable requirements, which are necessary to ensure quantifiability
of emissions increases, and any decreases, resulting from the
Alternative Operating Condition.
<P>
<LI>Stringency<BR>
Any alternative requirement or other condition imposed pursuant
to this subdivision shall not be more stringent than an applicable
requirement, except when consented to by the petitioner for purposes
of excess emissions mitigation.
<P>
<LI>Term<BR>
Each Alternative Operating Condition established by the Hearing
Board shall include a term during which the Alternative Operating
Condition shall be in effect. The term shall be determined in
accordance with Health and Safety Code Sections 42352 and 42358.
Upon termination of the Alternative Operating Condition, the source
shall comply with all applicable requirements and the preexisting
permit term(s) shall have full force and effect.
<P>
<LI>EPA Objection<BR>
Each Alternative Operating Condition shall contain a provision
stating that if the U.S. EPA objects to the Alternative Operating
Condition within 45 days, the Alternative Operating Condition
is ineffective to protect the petitioner from U.S. EPA or citizen
enforcement under the federal Clean Air Act for any federally
enforceable requirement.
<P>
</OL>
(h) Emissions Calculations
<P>
For purposes of determining whether or not the SIP allowance is
exceeded, as set forth in subparagraph (e)(2)(H) of this rule,
the amount of excess emissions resulting from establishment of
an Alternative Operating Condition, and the amount of any emission
reductions resulting from conditions included in the Alternative
Operating Condition, shall be determined in the following manner:
<OL>
<LI>Excess Emissions<BR>
Excess emissions from the source which is or will be in violation
of an applicable<U> </U>requirement shall be calculated as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(A) calculate calendar monthly mass emissions allowed by the
applicable requirement based on the terms of the applicable requirement
and projected activity during the term of the Alternative Operating
Condition;
<P>
(B) calculate calendar monthly mass emissions allowed by the Alternative
Operating Condition based on any alternative emission limits,
operational requirements and other conditions established pursuant
to subdivision (g), and projected activity during the term of
the Alternative Operating Condition; and
<P>
(C) subtract the calendar monthly mass emissions calculated pursuant
to subparagraph (A) from the calendar monthly mass emissions calculated
pursuant to subparagraph (B).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>Emission Reduction<BR>
The amount of emission reduction from a source other than the
source which is or will be in violation of an applicable requirement,
shall be calculated as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(A)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   (i) calculate the sum of actual emissions from the source,
as determined from emission fee reports filed pursuant to Rule
301 -<U> </U>Permit Fees, or other credible evidence provided
by the petitioner and approved by the Hearing Board, whichever
is less, which have occurred during the highest three of the last
five years immediately preceding the date of petition, or other
appropriate period approved by the Hearing Board if the source
had not operated consistently during the preceding five years;
and
<P>
   (ii) calculate the monthly mass emissions for the three years
or other appropriate period by dividing the sum of actual emissions
calculated pursuant to clause (i) by thirty-six or by the number
of months in the other appropriate period approved pursuant to
clause (i);
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
(B) calculate the calendar monthly mass emissions allowed by the
Alternative Operating Condition based on any alternative emissions
limits, operational requirements and other conditions established
pursuant to subdivision (g) and projected activity during the
term of the Alternative Operating Condition; and
<P>
(C) subtract the calendar monthly mass emissions determined pursuant
to subparagraph (B) from the monthly mass emissions calculated
pursuant to subparagraph (A).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>SIP Allowance Balance Determination
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(A) The Hearing Board will maintain a record of the balance
of emissions in the SIP Allowance for each calendar month.


<P>
(B) The amount of emissions that will be debited as a result of
an Alternative Operating Condition will be determined by subtracting
the emission reduction calculated pursuant to paragraph (2), and
the amount of any emission reduction credits temporarily surrendered
by the petitioner pursuant to paragraph (5), from excess emissions
calculated pursuant to paragraph (1). Emissions calculated pursuant
to this subparagraph shall be subtracted from the monthly and
annual SIP Allowance balance for the applicable period.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>The petitioner shall notify the Hearing Board within five
days after achieving continuous compliance with an applicable
requirement for which an Alternative Operating Condition has been
issued. Upon notification, the Alternative Operating Condition
for that applicable requirement shall expire. Any unused emissions
previously allocated to a petitioner will be restored by the Hearing
Board to the SIP Allowance balance for the same period from which
they were originally debited.
<P>
<LI>For non-RECLAIM sources, and non-RECLAIM pollutants at RECLAIM
sources, the amount of excess emissions calculated pursuant to
paragraph (h)(1) may be reduced by the amount of emission reduction
credits or offsets approved pursuant to Regulation XIII - New
Source Review, which the facility voluntarily relinquishes for
the term of the Alternative Operating Condition. Relinquishment
of ERCs shall not be deemed to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph
(e)(2)(E). Executive Officer will not issue a Permit to Construct
which relies upon ERCs relinquished pursuant to this paragraph
during the period for which such ERCs have been relinquished.
The Executive Officer shall not discount the value of ERCs due
to relinquishment pursuant to this paragraph.
<P>
<LI>An Alternative Operating Condition applicable to RECLAIM pollutants
emitted by a RECLAIM source shall be deemed to not result in any
excess emissions for purposes of this subdivision. This paragraph
does not relieve a RECLAIM facility of any obligation pursuant
to Regulation XX - RECLAIM.
</OL>

(i) SIP Allowance
<P>
The monthly and annual SIP Allowance for each air contaminant

<P>
Tom Eichhorn joined the District staff in 1987 after serving more
than six years on AQMD's Governing Board as an alternate member.
<P>
A fulltime newspaper reporter at 20 in his hometown of Galesburg,
Illinois, Tom later earned a B.A. in English/creative writing
at the University of Iowa Writer's Workshop and completed the
two-year M.F.A. program at the University of California, Irvine,
Writers Workshop.
<P>
These creative writing skills served him well when in 1969 he
became a reporter for the <U>Orange County Register</U>. During
his eight years there, Tom won 16 local awards, investigative
reporting honors and an &quot;outstanding reporting award&quot;
from the California Taxpayers Association. His articles contributed
to the indictments and convictions of two county supervisors,
a congressman and others.
<P>
In 1977, Tom was invited to become the Orange County Transit District's
first public information officer. Three years later, newly-elected
Orange County Supervisor Bruce Nestande hired Tom as his deputy
for transportation issues and press relations. The two played
pivotal roles in winning community acceptance of expanding John
Wayne Airport. With Nestande serving on the California Transportation
Commission, Tom helped shape the state transportation program
and led the campaign to revive HOV lanes in Southern California
as a less costly alternative to rail transit.
<P>
As a sideline, Tom served as Nestande's alternate on the AQMD
Governing Board from 1981 to 1987. Joining the District staff
in 1987 as its Media Relations Officer, Tom greatly expanded AQMD's
press outreach efforts. Later, Tom assumed responsibility for
AQMD's outreach support activities: advertising, newsletters,
brochures, speeches and graphics. In 1993, as Director of Communications,
Tom was assigned oversight of the District's Intergovernmental
Relations and Public Affairs functions.
<P>
Tom's wife Sara is a library administrator at the University of
California, Irvine. Their son, Robert Kennedy Eichhorn, is a graduate
student of Russian history. Tom and Sara split their time between
a small condo on the Balboa Peninsula in Newport Beach and a tiny
condo in Palm Springs.

<FONT SIZE=5><B>AIR QUALITY TRENDS THROUGH 1994</B> </FONT> 
<IMG SRC="/icon/line4.gif"> </CENTER> 

<P>
In 1994 pollutant concentrations in California's South Coast Air Basin (SOCAB) exceeded three of the six federal ambient air quality standards. The annual maximum concentrations of ozone, carbon monoxide, and PM10 exceeded both federal and state standards.  The federal standards were exceeded at one or more locations in the SOCAB on 142 days in 1994. Current air quality nevertheless represents substantial improvement over historical air quality.  <A HREF="/icon/trnd8494.gif">Figure 1</A> shows the change in exceedances of the standards over the past decade at selected monitoring sites which typify the areas with highest pollutant concentrations and which had complete data for the period. Three year averages were used to reduce the probability of obtaining a weather-induced trend caused by year-to-year variation in weather.
<P>
Between 1982-1984 and 1992-1994, the number of days on which the federal ozone standard was exceeded dropped by one third, from 33% to 22% of days, in the East San Gabriel Valley area which exceeded most frequently. Exceedances of the federal carbon monoxide standard decreased from 11% of days in 1982-1984 to 7% of days in 1992-1994. A comparison for the same periods can not be made for PM10 since the first full year of monitoring was performed in 1985. However, between 1985-1987 and 1992-1994, the percent of days exceeding the federal 24-hour standard decreased from 13% to 3%.
<P>
Exceedances of the state nitrogen dioxide standard decreased from 1% of days in 1982-1984 to 0.1% of days in 1992-1994. The federal nitrogen dioxide standard has not been exceeded in any area since 1991. There have been no exceedances of lead standards at regular air monitoring stations in the SOCAB since 1982. (The state and federal lead standards, however, were exceeded in some recent years at special monitoring sites immediately adjacent to stationary sources.) The state and federal sulfur dioxide standards were not exceeded in any of the SOCAB monitoring areas during either period. Exceedances of the state sulfate standard decreased from 2% to 0% at the long-term site used in this analysis, though a few sites exceeded in 1994.
<P>
The areas of the SOCAB which record the highest pollutant concentrations have shown a significant decrease in exceedances of the federal standards over the past decade. However, the SOCAB's high areas still record far more federal standard exceedances than any other areas of the U.S..

<p>
<b>RULE 403.	FUGITIVE DUST</b>
<p>
(a) Purpose
<p>The purpose of this rule is to reduce the amount of particulate
 matter entrained in the ambient air as a result of anthropogenic
 (man-made) fugitive dust sources by requiring actions to prevent,
 reduce or mitigate fugitive dust emissions.</p>
<br>
(b) Applicability
<p>The provisions of this rule shall apply to any activity or man-made
 condition capable of generating fugitive dust.
<p>
(c) Definitions<br><ol>
<li>ACTIVE OPERATIONS shall mean any activity capable of generating fugitive dust, including, but not limited to, earth-moving activities, construction/demolition activities, or heavy- and light-duty vehicular movement.
<p><li>ANEMOMETERS are devices used to measure wind speed and direction in accordance with the performance standards, and maintenance and calibration criteria specified in the District's Rule 403 Implementation Handbook, dated July 1993.
<p><li>BULK MATERIAL is sand, gravel, soil, aggregate material less than two inches in length or diameter, and other organic or inorganic particulate matter.
<p><li>CHEMICAL STABILIZERS mean any non-toxic chemical dust suppressant which must not be used if prohibited for use by the Regional Water Quality Control Boards, the California Air Resources Board, the Environmental Protection Agency, or any applicable law, rule or regulation; and should meet any specifications, criteria, or tests required by any federal, state, or local water agency.  Unless otherwise indicated, the use of a non-toxic chemical stabilizer shall be of sufficient concentration and application frequency to maintain a stabilized surface.
<p><li>CONSTRUCTION/DEMOLITION ACTIVITIES are any on-site mechanical activities preparatory to or related to the building, alteration, rehabilitation, demolition or improvement of property, including, but not limited to the following activities; grading, excavation, loading, crushing, cutting, planing, shaping or ground breaking.
<p><li>CONTRACTOR means any person who has a contractual arrangement to conduct an active operation for another person.
<p><li>DISTURBED SURFACE AREA means a portion of the earth's surface which has been
 physically moved, uncovered, destabilized, or otherwise modified from its undisturbed
 natural soil condition, thereby increasing the potential for emission of fugitive dust.
  This definition excludes those areas which have:<p>
	(A) been restored to a natural state, such that the vegetative ground cover
 and soil characteristics are similar to adjacent or nearby natural conditions;
	<p>(B) been paved or otherwise covered by a permanent structure; or
	<p>(C) sustained a vegetative ground cover over at least 95 percent of an area for a period of at least 6 months.
<p><li>DUST SUPPRESSANTS are water, hygroscopic materials, or non-toxic chemical stabilizers used as a treatment material to reduce fugitive dust emissions.
<p><li>EARTH-MOVING ACTIVITIES shall include, but not be limited to, grading, earth cutting and filling operations, loading or unloading of dirt or bulk materials, adding to or removing from open storage piles of bulk materials, landfill operations, or soil mulching.
<p><li>FUGITIVE DUST means any solid particulate matter that becomes airborne, other than that emitted from an exhaust stack, directly or indirectly as a result of the activities of man.
<p><li>INACTIVE DISTURBED SURFACE AREA means any disturbed surface area upon which active operations have not occurred or are not expected to occur for a period of ten consecutive days.
<p><li>LARGE OPERATIONS means any active operations on property which contains in excess of 100 acres of disturbed surface area; or any earth-moving operation which exceeds a daily earth-moving or throughput volume of 7,700 cubic meters (10,000 cubic yards) three times during the most recent 365-day period.
<p><li>NON-ROUTINE means any non-periodic active operation which occurs no more than three times per year, lasts less than 30 cumulative days per year, and is scheduled less than 30 days in advance.
<p><li>OPEN STORAGE PILE is any accumulation of bulk material with 5 percent or greater silt content which is not fully enclosed, covered or chemically stabilized, and which attains a height of three feet or more and a total surface area of 150 or more square feet.  Silt content level is assumed to be 5 percent or greater unless a person can show, by sampling and analysis in accordance with ASTM Method C-136 or other equivalent method approved in writing by the Executive Officer and the California Air Resources Board, that the silt content is less than 5 percent.  The results of ASTM Method C-136 or equivalent method are valid for 60 days from the date the sample was taken. 
<p><li>PARTICULATE MATTER means any material, except uncombined water, which exists in a finely divided form as a liquid or solid at standard conditions.
<p><li>PM10 is particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than or equal to 10 microns as measured by the applicable State and Federal reference test methods.
<p><li>PROPERTY LINE means the boundaries of an area in which either a person causing the emission or a person allowing the emission has the legal use or possession of the property.  Where such property is divided into one or more sub-tenancies, the property line(s) shall refer to the boundaries dividing the areas of all sub-tenancies.
<p><li>REASONABLY AVAILABLE CONTROL MEASURES are techniques and procedures used to prevent or reduce the emission and airborne transport of fugitive dust.  These include, but are not limited to, application of dust suppressants, use of coverings or enclosures, paving, enshrouding, planting, reduction of vehicle speeds, and other measures as specified by the Executive Officer.  (A detailed listing of reasonably available control measures for each fugitive dust source type is contained in the Rule 403 Implementation Handbook, dated July 1993.)
<p><li>SILT means any aggregate material with a particle size less than 74 micrometers in diameter which passes through a No. 200 Sieve.
<p><li>SIMULTANEOUS SAMPLING means the operation of two PM10 samplers in such a manner that one sampler is started within five minutes of the other, and each sampler is operated for a consecutive period which must be not less than 290 minutes and not more than 310 minutes.
<p><li>STABILIZED SURFACE means:
<p>(A) any disturbed surface area or open storage pile which is resistant to wind-driven fugitive dust; 
<p>(B) any unpaved road surface in which any fugitive dust plume emanating from vehicular traffic does not exceed 20 percent opacity.
<p><li>UNPAVED ROADS are any unsealed or unpaved roads, equipment paths, or travel ways that are not covered by one of the following: concrete, asphaltic concrete, or asphalt.  Public unpaved roads are any unpaved roadway owned and maintained by Federal, State, county, municipal or other governmental or quasi-governmental agencies.  Private unpaved roads are all other unpaved roadways not defined as public.
<p><li>VISIBLE ROADWAY DUST means any sand, soil, dirt, or other solid particulate matter which is visible upon paved road surfaces and which can be removed by a vacuum sweeper or a broom sweeper under normal operating conditions.
<p><li>WIND-DRIVEN FUGITIVE DUST means visible emissions from any disturbed surface area which is generated by wind action alone.
<p><li>WIND GUST is the maximum instantaneous wind speed as measured by an anemometer.
</ol>
(d) Requirements<p><ol>
<li>A person shall not cause or allow the emissions of fugitive dust from any active operation, open storage pile, or disturbed surface area such that the presence of such dust remains visible in the atmosphere beyond the property line of the emission source.
<p><li>A person shall utilize one or more reasonably available control measures to minimize fugitive dust emissions from each fugitive dust source type which is part of any active operation.
<p><li>A person shall not cause or allow PM10 levels to exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter when determined, by simultaneous sampling, as the difference between upwind and downwind samples collected on high-volume particulate matter samplers or other EPA-approved equivalent method for PM10 monitoring.  If sampling is conducted, samplers shall be:
<p>(A) Operated, maintained, and calibrated in accordance with 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 50, Appendix J, or appropriate EPA-published documents for EPA-approved equivalent method(s) for PM10.
<p>(B) Reasonably placed upwind and downwind of key activity areas and as close to the property line as feasible, such that other sources of fugitive dust between the sampler and the property line are minimized.
<p><li>A person shall:
<p>(A) prevent visible roadway dust from being deposited upon public paved roadways as a result of their operations for a cumulative distance of greater than 50 feet from any property access road during active operations; and
<p>(B) remove all visible roadway dust deposited upon public paved roadways as a result of active operations at the conclusion of each work day when active operations cease.
</ol><p>

(e) Special Requirements for Large Operations<p><ol>
<li>Any person who conducts or authorizes the conducting of a large operation which is subject to the requirements of this rule shall either:
<p>(A) take the actions specified in Tables 1 and 2 for each applicable source of fugitive dust within the property lines and shall: 
	<blockquote>(i) notify the Executive Officer not more than 7 days after qualifying as a large operation;
		<p>(ii) include, as part of the notification, the items specified in subparagraphs (e)(3)(A) and (e)(3)(B);
		<p>(iii) maintain daily records to document the specific actions taken;
		<p>(iv) maintain such records for a period of not less than 6 months; and
		<p>(v) make such records available to the Executive Officer upon request;
		 or</BLOCKQUOTE>
(B) obtain an approved fugitive dust emissions control plan (plan).
<p><li>Any person subject to paragraph (e)(1) who elects to obtain an approved fugitive dust emission control plan must submit the plan to the Executive Officer no later than 30 days after the activity becomes a large operation.
<p><li>Any plan prepared pursuant to subparagraph (e)(1)(B) shall include:
<p>(A) The name(s), address(es), and phone number(s) of the person(s) responsible for the preparation, submittal, and implementation of the plan;
<p>(B) A description of the operation(s), including a map depicting the location of the site;
<p>(C) A listing of all sources of fugitive dust emissions within the property lines;
<p>(D) A description of reasonably available control measures as applied to each of the sources identified in subparagraph (e)(3)(C).  The description must be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate that such reasonably available control measures will be utilized and/or installed during all periods of active operations.
<p><li>In the event that there are special technical (e.g., non-economic) circumstances, including safety, which prevent the use of at least one reasonably available control measure for any of the sources identified in subparagraph (e)(3)(C), a justification statement must be provided in lieu of the description required in subparagraph (e)(3)(D).  The justification statement must explain the reason(s) why reasonably available control measures cannot be implemented.
<p><li>Within 30 calendar days of the receipt of a plan submitted pursuant to subparagraph (e)(1)(B), the Executive Officer will either approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the plan , in writing.  For a plan to be approved or conditionally approved, three conditions must be satisfied:
<p>(A) All sources of fugitive dust emissions must be identified (e.g., earth-moving, storage piles, vehicular traffic on unpaved roads, etc.).
<p>(B) For each source identified, at least one reasonably available control measure must be implemented, or an acceptable justification statement pursuant to paragraph (e)(4) must be provided; and
<p>(C) If, after implementation of control measures, visible dust emissions are crossing the property line(s), then contingency measures (e.g., increased watering) must be specified for immediate implementation.
<p><li>Conditional approval will be made if conditions are met, but the stated measures do not satisfactorily conform to the guidance contained in the Rule 403 Implementation Handbook.  If a plan is conditionally approved, the conditions necessary to modify the plan will be provided in writing to the person(s) identified in subparagraph (e)(3)(A).  Such modifications must be incorporated into the plan within 30 days of the receipt of the notice of conditional approval, or the plan shall be disapproved.  A letter to the Executive Officer stating that such modifications will be incorporated into the plan shall be deemed sufficient to result in approval of the plan.
<p><li>If a plan is disapproved by the Executive Officer:
<p>(A) The reasons for disapproval shall be given to the applicant in writing.
<p>(B) Within 7 days of the receipt of a notice of a disapproved plan, the applicant shall comply with the actions specified in Tables 1 and 2 for each applicable source of fugitive dust within the property lines.
<p>(C) The applicant may resubmit a plan at any time after receiving a disapproval notification, but will not be relieved of complying with subparagraph (e)(7)(B) until such time as the plan has been approved.
<p><li>Failure to comply with any of the provisions in an approved or conditionally approved plan shall be a violation of subdivision (e).
<p><li>Any approved plan shall be valid for a period of one year from the date of approval or conditional approval of the plan.  Plans must be resubmitted annually, at least 60 days prior to the expiration date, or the plan shall become disapproved as of the expiration date.  If all fugitive dust sources and corresponding reasonably available control measures or special circumstances remain identical to those identified in the previously approved plan, the resubmittal may contain a simple statement of no-change.  Otherwise, a resubmittal must contain all the items specified in subparagraphs (e)(3)(A through D).
<p><li>Any person subject to the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) who no longer exceeds, and does not expect to exceed for a period of at least one year, the criteria for a large operation may request a reclassification as a non-large operation.  To obtain this reclassification, a person must submit a request in writing to the Executive Officer specifying the conditions which have taken place to reduce the disturbed surface area and/or the earth-moving or throughput conditions to levels below the criteria for large operations.  A person must further indicate that the criteria for large operations are not expected to be exceeded during the subsequent 12-month period.  The Executive Officer shall either approve or disapprove the reclassification within 60 days from receipt of the reclassification request.  The Executive Officer will disapprove the request if the indicated changes can not be verified to be below the criteria for large operations.  If approved, the person shall be relieved of all requirements under subdivision (e).  Any person so reclassified would again be subject to the requirements of subdivision (e) if at any time subsequent to the reclassification the criteria for large operations are met.
<p><li>A person responsible for more than one large operation at non-contiguous sites may submit one plan covering multiple sites provided that:
<p>(A) the contents of the plan apply similarly to all sites; and
<p>(B) specific information is provided for each site, including, map of site location, address, description of operations, and a listing of all sources of fugitive dust emissions within the property lines.
<p></ol>
(f) Compliance Schedule
<p>All newly amended provisions of this rule shall become effective upon adoption of 
this Rule Amendment.  Pursuant to subdivision (e), any fugitive dust emission control
 plan which has been approved or conditionally approved prior to the date of adoption

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><B>NOTICE TO COMPLY</B></H2>

<hr>

<P>The Notice to Comply is used to help facilities achieve compliance with
AQMDs procedural rules and regulations. A Notice to Comply is issued to
a facility: </P>

<UL>
<LI>When it is observed to be operating out of compliance with a procedural
rule. A procedural rule is a rule which requires a specified action but
does not involve direct air contaminant emissions to the atmosphere. </LI>

<LI>When AQMD requests the facility to supply information concerning its
operation. Information is defined as data, records, photographs, analyses,
plans, or specifications which will disclose the nature, extent, quantity,
or degree of air contaminants which are, or may be, discharged by the source
for which the permit was issued or applied.</LI>
</UL>

<P>AQMDs goal is to be consistent and fair to all sources in its application
of the Notice to Comply. To ensure that this goal is met, specific guidelines
have been developed to distinguish criteria for issuing a Notice to Comply
vs. a <A HREF="/comply/nov.html">Notice of Violation</A>
for failure to comply with AQMD rule requirements governing <A HREF="/permit/perm_net.html">permits</A>
and recordkeeping, as well as those associated with prohibitory and source-specific
<A HREF="/rules/">rules</A>. A Notice to Comply will
not be issued in situations where these guidelines require a Notice of
Violation. </P>

<H3><B>Compliance requirements</B></H3>

<P>When an AQMD Inspector issues a Notice to Comply, the facility owner
or operator is allowed a minimum of three (3) and a maximum of fourteen
(14) calendar days to comply with procedural rules or requests for information,
depending on the type of operation and urgency of the situation. Time allowances
may be modified under extenuating circumstances for bringing sources into
compliance. </P>

<H3><B>Failure to comply with procedural rules</B></H3>

<P>A Notice of Violation will be issued to a person who fails to comply
with a procedural rule by the date specified on the Notice to Comply. </P>

<H4><B>Failure to comply with requests for information</B></H4>

<P>An &quot;Intent to Suspend Permit&quot; letter will be sent to any person
who fails to comply by the due date with the Notice to Comply request for
information under California Health and Safety Code Section 42303. </P>

<H3><B>Record requests</B></H3>

<P>AQMD frequently requests records from facilities to determine rule and
permit compliance, especially for coating and solvent regulations. Recordkeeping
requirements are specified in many AQMD rules and permit conditions. When
the requirements exists and the records are not made available upon request,
AQMD must initiate enforcement action with a Notice to Comply. </P>

<P>Field inspection staff cite one of the following three sources when
issuing Notices to Comply for the purposes of obtaining records: </P>

<UL>
<LI>AQMDs Rule [example: 1107(I), 1124(I), 1145(g)]. </LI>

<LI>Rule 203 and the conditions stipulated on the Permit to Operate. </LI>

<LI>California Health and Safety Code Section 42303, which authorizes the
Executive Officer to request information for permitted equipment.</LI>
</UL>

<H3><B>Permit suspension process</B></H3>

<P>If a permit holder willfully fails or refuses to furnish the information,
analysis, plans, or specifications requested by field inspection staff,
AQMD may suspend that persons permit under Sections 42304, 42307, and
42309 of the California Health and Safety Code. </P>

<H3><B>Follow-up on suspended permits</B></H3>

<P>If the facility owner or operator does not respond by the effective
suspension date, field inspection staff will follow up after expiration
of the permit to determine if the facility is operating with a suspended
permit. If it is, field inspection staff will issue a Notice of Violation
for operating in violation of Rule 203. </P>

<H3><B>Permit reinstatement</B></H3>

<P>When the &quot;Intent to Suspend permit&quot; letter generates the requested
records from the permittee, AQMD will send the permittee a &quot;Reinstatement
of Permit&quot; letter.

<p><b><a  NAME="what">What is a Notice of Violation?</b></A> </p>

<p>A Notice of Violation is a written &quot;ticket&quot; informing a business
that it has failed to comply with an AQMD rule or permit, or a state air
pollution regulation. </p>

<p>If you receive a Notice of Violation, it means you are operating in
violation of the law. Under the law, each day or part of a day that you
are in violation is a separate violation, so it is in your best interest
to act immediately to solve your compliance problem. </p>

<p>According to the <i>California Health and Safety Code</i>, penalties
in the worst cases can be up to $50,000 per day per violation and may include
criminal sanctions. Actual penalties tend to be far less, depending on
the circumstances, such as how bad the violation was, whether the business
owner knew the law was being broken, and whether anyone was hurt. </p>

<p>If you need to continue operating equipment that is in violation, you
must obtain a <a HREF="/hearbd/hearbd.html#variance">variance</a>. The
variance is an administrative order that allows a company to continue operating
without penalties while it takes appropriate steps to meet air pollution
control requirements. Only the <a HREF="/hearbd/hearbd.html">AQMD Hearing
Board</a> can grant a variance.
<br></p>

<p><a  NAME="what_h"><b>What happens if I receive a Notice of Violation?</a></b>
</p>

<p>Once a Notice of Violation is issued to a business, it is forwarded
to AQMD's District Prosecutor for handling. Staff from that office will
review your case. Several factors determine whether a violation is handled
as a civil case by AQMD or referred for review as a potential criminal
case to a law enforcement agency such as the county District Attorney.
Among these factors are the: </p>

<p> Extent of harm caused by the violation 
<br> Type and length of the violation 
<br> Intent that led to the violation and 
<br> Frequency of past violations. </p>

<p><a   NAME="mutual"><b>Mutual Settlement Agreement Program</b> 
<p>Cases involving lesser offenses or companies with no prior violations
are usually handled under AQMD's Mutual Settlement Agreement Program. Under
this program, you and AQMD agree on the actions you must take to comply
with clean air rules and the penalty for your violation. This settlement
is reached without involving attorneys or the courts. </p>

<p>If your case is considered appropriate for this program, you will receive
a letter or phone call from an investigator in AQMD's District Prosecutor
offering to settle your violation. Settlement terms usually call for a
penalty payment and written proof of current compliance. </p>

<p>If you want to discuss your case, the investigator's name and telephone
number is included in the initial settlement letter. </p>

<p>Be prepared to describe anything about the violation that you believe
AQMD should know in considering your case. For example, you may want to
tell the investigator about the condition of your equipment, whether the
emissions were caused by an equipment breakdown, and whether you have current
AQMD permits. Knowing the relevant facts will help the investigator resolve
your case fairly. </p>

<p>When you receive your letter, be sure to respond in writing by the date
indicated to avoid further legal action. If the Mutual Settlement Agreement
Program fails to result in a settlement, your Notice of Violation will
be handled under the procedures for Civil Prosecution. </p>

<p><a   NAME="civil"><b>CIVIL PROSECUTION</b> 
<p>If your violation notice is handled under this option, your case will
be reviewed by an attorney from the District Prosecutor's Office. You will
receive a &quot;pre-suit&quot; letter from the attorney, asking for information
about your case. </p>

<p>Either you or your attorney should contact the AQMD attorney named in
the letter to discuss your case. You must reply by the date indicated in
the letter. </p>

<p>Explain to AQMD's prosecuting attorney anything related to the violation
that you believe AQMD should know in considering your case and in negotiating
settlement terms. </p>

<p>If you fail to respond by the date indicated in the initial letter,
the AQMD prosecutor will file a lawsuit-- a civil complaint-- taking you
to court. You will be served a copy of the complaint and a summons requiring
you to file a written response with the court within 30 calendar days.
</p>

<p>After the complaint is filed, the &quot;discovery process&quot; begins.
During this process, both sides work to specify the main issues in the
case. Written questions may be posed to you or your attorney. Individuals
can be questioned under oath. The court requires that both sides appear
at hearings to discuss a possible settlement. </p>

<p>If an agreement cannot be reached during these hearings, a trial date
is set. If as a result of the trial a judge finds that you did violate
AQMD rules, the court imposes a fine. The maximum civil penalty is $50,000
per day per violation. </p>

<p><a   NAME="criminal"><b>CRIMINAL PROSECUTION</b> 
<p>If AQMD's District Prosecutor determines that criminal prosecution may
be necessary, the case will be referred to the appropriate law enforcement
agency, such as the county District Attorney. That agency will determine
whether or not criminal prosecution is warranted. </p>

<p>Anyone undergoing a criminal prosecution can expect to be served with
an arraignment letter, an arrest warrant or, in a case involving corporations,
a summons. </p>

<p>Criminal prosecution of a violation takes into account serious factors
such as the type of pollutant(s) emitted, the intent of the person(s) cited,
endangerment of public health, and any past record of violating AQMD rules
or regulations. </p>

<p>Penalties can be substantial under criminal prosecution: The maximum
sentence is a $50,000 fine and/or one year in jail for each day in violation
of a given rule or regulation. </p>

<p><a   NAME="aqmd_enforce"><b>AQMD ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY</b> 
<p>AQMD's enforcement authority for civil penalties can be found in the
<i>California Health and Safety Code</i> Civil Penalties Sections 42402,
42402.1, 42402.2, 42402.3, and <i>California Health and Safety Code</i>
Criminal Penalties Sections 42400, 42400.1, 42400.2, and 42400.3. For more
information about these laws, see <i><a HREF="enfauth.html">&quot;What
You Need to Know About AQMD's Enforcement Authority&quot;</a></i>. </p>

<p><a   NAME="inj"><b>INJUNCTIONS</b> 
<p>AQMD has the authority to seek an injunction. A mandatory injunction
is a court order compelling a person and/or company to do a certain thing.
A prohibitory injunction is a court order compelling a person and/or company
to refrain from doing a certain thing. Injunctions, which can include shutting
down a business, are sought only in extraordinary cases to stop continuing
violations or to prevent serious violations from occurring. </p>

<P>
In April 1995, the Board initiated the Intercredit Trading Study.
The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of linking
the AQMD's mobile and stationary emissions credit trading programs
to increase compliance flexibility while achieving air quality
goals. In October 1995, AQMD staff released for public review
a draft paper on issues surrounding intercredit trading. Four
workshops were held in November. Based on public comments received,
staff is finalizing policy recommendations and an action plan
for rulemaking. Actual rulemaking would occur later. The report
will be made available prior to the February public hearing.<BR>

<P>
At the December 1995 Board Hearing, the Board adopted Rule 2202
- On-Road Vehicle Mitigation Options, and directed staff to bring
back information for further evaluation of appropriate fees for
participating in the Air Quality Investment Program, and to consider
possible exemption of primary and secondary schools. A staff report
is being prepared on these issues and a February hearing is being
scheduled relative to the fees specified in Rule 2202. Any action
to consider exemption of schools would need to occur at a later
date to allow completion of necessary CEQA analysis. <BR>

<P>
On September 8, 1995, the Board directed staff to evaluate the
feasibility of monthly recordkeeping for Rule 1130 - Graphic Arts
printing operations. This report indicates that monthly recordkeeping
may be viable for part of the industry, but some enforcement issues
still need to be resolved. In addition, it recommends that pursuit
of monthly recordkeeping be postponed until after the VOC RECLAIM
recordkeeping protocols and requirements are adopted. In the interim,
the report establishes several simplified daily recordkeeping
procedures for segments of the printing industry.<BR>

The Administrative Committee received a nomination by the Advisory
Council to fill two of the existing nine vacancies on the 20-member
council. The Administrative Committee recommends that it first
undertake an evaluation of the Advisory Council's composition,
duties and activities, solicit nominations for membership from
the business and environmental communities, as well as Board Members
themselves, in addition to the Advisory Council's nominations,
and return to the Governing Board with a comprehensive recommendation
for the Board's consideration.<BR>

On September 8, 1995, as part of the public hearing on PAR 1130
(Graphic Arts), the Board directed staff to conduct a technology
assessment on the flexographic printing of polyethylene and polypropylene
bags and report our findings at the January 12, 1996 Board meeting.
This report will provide staff findings on the feasibility of
using compliant inks (300 grams per liter or less of VOCs) in
the flexographic printing of polyethylene and polypropylene bags
for tortillas, produce (carrots), frozen foods, pharmaceutical
products, and manure. It will also provide staff recommendations
for further rulemaking.<BR>

Proposed Rule 518.2 - Federal Alternative Operating Conditions
(AOC), establishes procedures by which owners/operators of Title
V facilities seeking a variance from AQMD or state rules may obtain
an AOC from the Hearing Board that would be recognized by the
EPA. Five major issues are addressed in the proposed rule: 1)
federal recognition of variances through the approval of this
rule; 2) creation of a SIP Allowance for variances; 3) content
of AOC; 4) public participation; and 5) mitigation of excess emissions.

The rescinding of Rule 1129 and proposed amendment of the other

Section 41712 of the state Health and Safety Code which prohibits
local districts from enforcing or regulating VOC limits on aerosol
coatings. In addition, the proposed amendment of the definition
of &quot;exempt compounds&quot; in each rule will reference Rule

<P>
The meeting was called to order at 9:35 a.m. by Chairman Mikels.
<H3>Opening Comments</H3>

<P>
<U><B>Chairman Mikels</B></U>. 1) Upon unanimous agreement of
the Board, canceled the January 18, 1996 VOC RECLAIM Study Session
and the April 26, 1996 public hearing on Adoption of VOC RECLAIM,
and suggested that the issues inherent in VOC RECLAIM be considered
as part of a broader trading network following the Intercredit
Trading Study which is scheduled to be presented to the Board
at its February 9, 1996 meeting. The Rule Forecast Report (Agenda
Item No. 14) was amended to reflect cancellation of the January
18 study session and the April 26 public hearing. In response
to concern expressed by Mr. Braude and Mr. Paulitz that command-and-control
rules be put in place for the industries that would potentially
be regulated by a VOC RECLAIM program, Dr. Lents noted that the
Rule Forecast Report includes nine rule adoptions which were contingent
upon the Board not adopting VOC RECLAIM. 2) Announced that the
Board's AQIP Workshop would be held on February 16, 1996 at 12:00
noon; and appointed <BR>
Ms. Haggard and Mr. Hewitt to co-chair the workshop. 3) Suggested
several possible approaches regarding exempting schools from Rule
2202 as recommended by Mr. Hewitt at the Board's December 8, 1995
meeting (as set forth in the motion stated below).
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. PAULITZ, SECONDED BY MS. SOTO, A UNANIMOUS VOTE
WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Burke):
<P>
1) DIRECTING STAFF TO ANALYZE THE FOLLOWING POSSIBLE APPROACHES
REGARDING EXEMPTING SCHOOLS FROM RULE 2202, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER
APPROACHES ADVANCED TO STAFF BY BOARD MEMBERS, AND REPORT BACK
TO THE BOARD ON ALL OF THE POSSIBLE APPROACHES FOR CONSIDERATION
BY THE BOARD AT ITS MARCH 8, 1996 MEETING:
<UL>
<LI><I>Counting the students on school buses as part of the effort
that schools make</I> 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><I>Allow credit for the repair and tuning of old school buses
to reduce emissions, and look at possible allocation of either
<BR>
AB 2766 dollars or investment through the AQIP in that regard</I>

</UL>

<UL>
<LI><I>A limited two- or three-year exemption for schools</I>

</UL>

<UL>
<LI><I>An exemption if a rideshare matching effort is undertaken</I>

</UL>

<P>
2) REFERRING TO THE CO-CHAIRS FOR THE AQIP WORKSHOP THE ISSUE
OF POTENTIAL FUNDING FOR ONE OR MORE OPTIONS FOR SCHOOLS.
<P>
Mr. Hewitt requested that staff make every effort to contact the
school districts--as opposed to the transportation coordinators--directly
regarding the Board's consideration of the school exemption at
the March 8, 1996 Board meeting.
<P>
<U>Ms. Lee.</U> Showed a videotape of a brief commentary by Jess
Marlow relating to the AQMD, which recently aired on Channel 4.
<P>
<U>Mr. Paulitz.</U> Expressed his appreciation to the Cities of
San Bernardino County for reappointing him to the Board; and promised
to (i) continue to keep them informed, and (ii) listen to their
concerns and represent their best interest.
<UL>
<LI>Oath of Office Administered to Reappointed and/or Newly-Appointed
Board Members
</UL>

<P>
Chairman Mikels administered the oath of office to Candace Haggard,
Leonard Paulitz and Nell Soto, who were reappointed to the Board,
by unanimous votes of their Cities' Selection Committees, as representatives
of the Cities of Orange County, the Cities of San Bernardino County
and the Cities of the Eastern Region of Los Angeles County, respectively,
for four-year terms expiring on January 15, 2000.
<P>
Ms. Haggard and Ms. Soto expressed their gratitude to the cities
they represent on the Board. Ms. Soto added that the positive
comments she has received from the cities regarding the AQMD working
more closely with municipalities than they have in the past speaks
well for staff's extensive outreach efforts.
<UL>
<LI>Presentation of Award to Alan C. Lloyd, Ph.D.
</UL>

<P>
Chairman Mikels presented an award to Dr. Alan Lloyd, AQMD's Chief
Scientist since 1988, in appreciation of his efforts in projecting
the work of the AQMD into the national and international scientific
community and establishing a worldwide record for AQMD. <BR>
Chairman Mikels extended the Board's best wishes to Dr. Lloyd
for continued success in his new position as Executive Director
of the Energy and Environmental Engineering Center at Desert Research
Institute, in Reno, Nevada.

<P>
James M. Lents, Ph.D., Executive Officer, highlighted the achievements
made by AQMD in 1995 and outlined the goals for 1996. Major achievements
for 1995 included: (i) improved air quality, a continuing trend
for the last ten years; (ii) considerably improved business relations;
(iii) successful completion of all items committed to in the Business
Clean Air Partnership; (iv) successful implementation of the NOx/SOx
RECLAIM program, and staff moving forward on market-based strategies;
(v) new scientific initiatives and health studies began; (vi)
increased public awareness of AQMD activities through enhanced
public outreach; (vii) considerable reduction in the cost of AQMD
representation in Sacramento; and (viii) significant information
made available on the Internet.
<P>
A continuing decline in AQMD revenues will present significant
challenges for 1996. Staff will have to be reduced by approximately
30 positions, and compliance staff will be faced with a tremendous
caseload. Of the 28 rules scheduled for amendment/adoption in
1995, only 2 were actually adopted. Approximately 33 rules are
scheduled for amendment/adoption in 1996. Other plans for 1996
include: (i) continue to reduce the cost of air monitoring, yet
maintain quality and make data available through the Internet;
(ii) develop the PM10 AQMP and complete work on the Ozone AQMP;
(iii) Board consideration of geographical and temporal options
for air quality management; (iv) Title V Permits (federally-required
permits) for 1,400 facilities within 3 years--one-third during
1996; (v) continue to improve public outreach; (vi) improve AQMD's
contracting process to increase MBE/WBE participation; (vii) promote
new clean air technologies more aggressively; (viii) continue
work on the AQMD's Internet site; and (ix) bring a number of market-based
programs to the Board for consideration.
<P>
Commenting that he believed improvement should be a continuous
process, Chairman Mikels made the following recommendations with
regard to regulatory reform initiatives he believes the AQMD can
undertake:
<OL>
<LI>Reduce AQMD staff by 50 percent over the next decade; and
challenge other regulatory agencies throughout the state to do
likewise, where feasible;<BR>

<LI>Staff investigate the elimination of permits for some small
businesses in a way that does not detract from the region's air
quality attainment; and<BR>

<LI>Further expedite the permit review process, create a &quot;green
carpet ride&quot; for companies within the basin, and institute
an electronic permit application process.
</OL>

<P>
Consistent with regulatory reform, Chairman Mikels made the following
recommendations for statutory reform:
<OL>
<LI>That mobile sources and consumer products, which represent
the majority of the emissions in the inventory, bear their fair
share through appropriate legislation undertaken in Sacramento;
<BR>

<LI>Amend the statutes covering variances for small businesses
and substitute the equivalent of the small claims approach to
reduce the time and cost for small businesses to get variances;
<BR>

<LI>Where the effort is extremely costly, the benefits negligible
and the process time consuming, consider amendment of the AQMD's
CEQA reporting scheme; and<BR>

<LI>Encourage a legislation of tax breaks for manufacturers for
installing or producing super clean pollution control equipment.
</OL>

<P>
In conclusion, Chairman Mikels expressed his belief that AQMD
has an obligation to undertake and demonstrate that regulatory
reform and the protection of public health and attainment of air
quality standards can coexist and be managed. Chairman Mikels
recommended that staff investigate the potential for implementation
of the recommended initiatives, and report back to the Board at
its February 9, 1996 meeting.
<P>
In response to Ms. Soto, staff agreed to bring a report back to
the Board on the progress of enhanced public outreach activities.
<P>

Meetings
<P>
John Billheimer, Consultant, addressed the Board to request that
the Minutes of the December 7 Board Meeting be amended to clarify
that the intent of his comments, summarized on Page 10 of the
Minutes, was to question whether the ski slopes were &quot;<U><I>logically&quot;</I></U>
within AQMD's jurisdiction.
<P>
2. Set a Public Hearing for February 9, 1996 to Receive Public
Input on the Executive Officer's Program Goals/Objectives for
Fiscal Year 1996-97
<P>
Ed Guiles of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric addressed the Board
to express their gratitude, as one of the recipients of a Clean
Air Partners Award, for AQMD's leadership in allowing businesses
the flexibility to not only meet the intent of the law, but to
allow them to transition into a more competitive market-based
industry.
<P>
Linda Waade addressed the Board on behalf of the Coalition for
Clean Air and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) to
urge AQMD, now that California's economy is beginning to recover
from the recession, to get back to the business of making substantial
reductions in air pollution emissions. The Coalition and NRDC
will continue to fight any legislation to undermine AQMD's efforts,
and want to make sure that AQMD does not lose sight of its mission
to protect public health by improving air quality. (Submitted
Written Comments.)
<P>
14. Annual Rule Forecast Report 1996
<P>
Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, presented the
annual report highlighting AQMD's rulemaking activities for the
years 1993 through 1995, and forecasting emission reductions due
to proposed rulemaking activities in 1996. An update of VOC RECLAIM
and other major rulemaking activities was also provided.
<P>
Robert Wyman, Attorney with Latham &amp; Watkins, addressed the
Board on behalf of the Regulatory Flexibility Group and urged
the Board to stop work on staff's proposed VOC RECLAIM because
of the uncertainties regarding both the region's future economic
activity and the likely pace of technology development; and to
instead adopt an open market emission trading program, which would
not require AQMD to impose facility caps and would have the further
advantage of extending to regulated entities in any sector of
the inventory, thus potentially expanding emissions trading well
beyond the 2 percent of the inventory currently attributable to
the VOC RECLAIM sources. (Submitted Written Comments.)
<P>
ON MOTION OF DR. WILSON, SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD, A UNANIMOUS
VOTE WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Burke) APPROVING
AGENDA ITEMS 1, 2 AND 14 (including cancellation of the January
18 Board Study Session and the April 26 public hearing regarding
VOC RECLAIM) AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF, WITH THE FOLLOWING AMENDMENT
TO PAGE 10 OF THE MINUTES OF THE DECEMBER 7, 1995 BOARD MEETING:
<P>
<I>&quot;Mr. Billheimer raised the question, with respect to the
ski slope exemption, as to whether or not the north slope of the
mountains facing the desert are in fact <U>logically</U> within
AQMD's jurisdiction.&quot;</I> 
<P>
At Ms. Soto's request, Page 2 of the Minutes of the December 7,
1995 Board Meeting were also amended, with respect to Ms. Soto's
comments on Agenda Item No. 15, as follows:
<P>
<I>&quot;She suggested that <U>staff focus on involving more of
the minority community newspapers that are in English</U>, which
is most likely what people interested in these types of business
opportunities would be reading. <U>The fact that not one MBE is
on the vendor's list represents an outreach failure, and she expressed
her commitment to continue working with AQMD staff to improve
AQMD's outreach efforts</U>.&quot;</I> 
<P>
7. Award Contract for California Environmental Quality Act Analysis
Assistance
<P>
9. Issue a Request for Proposals to Enhance the Current RECLAIM
NOx/SOx Central Station Computer System
<P>
Ms. Soto and Ms. Lee reported on the January 5, 1996 meeting of
the Board's Ad Hoc AA Committee (Committee). It is an accepted
fact that in the employee hiring/promotion arena, there really
isn't a lot that can be done, especially since focus is on downsizing
the agency every year. However, the Committee did spend a considerable
amount of time on is the District's contracting and purchasing
policies. The Committee recommended that the staff review past
experiences with similar type RFPs, review RFP mailing list to
determine if there are historical problems in obtaining MBE/WBE/DVBE
participation. The committee also requested, that when staff recommends
awarding a contract, the Board members be provided the names of
the evaluation panelists and copies of the evaluation forms as
part of the review. It was subsequently decided, that the names
and forms would be reviewed during the Administrative Committee's
review of the monthly agenda.. The Committee directed staff to
do a comprehensive analyses of the District's existing policies
and procedures and report back with recommendations on ways to
increase outreach and minority participation. Based on this process,
the Committee will be able to recommend to the full Board, a new
direction for the District to take.

Bags
<P>
Fred Lettice, SSC Senior Manager, gave a brief presentation outlining
the findings of the technology assessment on the flexographic
printing of polyethylene and polypropylene bags conducted by staff
at the Board's direction.
<P>
Mr. Sol Schor, Coast Converters, addressed the Board and recommended
that variances granted to companies from the 300 grams-per-liter
VOC limit in Rule 1130 be reviewed and, where determined appropriate,
the time period of the variances be shortened.
<P>
Mr. Richard Gurewitz, Polypak America, expressed concern that
the staff report made no mention of the fact that flexibility
or changes to Rule 1130 are necessary to address problems experienced
during the packaging, storage, shipping and consumption of frozen
products, pharmaceuticals, hot packs and nitrogen-emitting fertilizer
packaged in polyethylene or polypropylene bags printed with water-based
inks.

24. Public Hearing on the First Annual RECLAIM Program Audit
<P>
Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, presented the
staff report. The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard
testimony from the following individuals:
<P>
<U>DR. ANNE SHOLTZ, Automated Environmental Credit Exchange (AECE)</U>

<P>
1) Commented on the importance of the two-cycle approach with
respect to the increased demand by businesses for credits when
reporting missing data. 2) Gave a brief overview of how AECE works.
<P>
<U>MILLIE YAMADA, Northrop Grumman</U> 
<P>
Expressed concerns regarding clerical errors in their facility
permit, an inordinate burden and redundancy in recordkeeping,
and several problems encountered with respect to monitoring and
reporting.
<P>
In response, Ms. Leyden offered to meet with Ms. Yamada and resolve
the concerns raised.
<P>
<U>ROBERT WYMAN, Regulatory Flexibility Group (RFG)</U> 
<P>
In response to the comparison of NOx RECLAIM and staff's proposed
VOC RECLAIM made by Ms. Leyden during presentation of the staff
report, commented that RFG would support VOC RECLAIM if it were
to go forward with the same methodology as the NOx RECLAIM program.
However, there are two important differences between the two programs:
(i) under the NOx program, companies would have received allocations
for their peak activity levels in 1989--a year before the recession,
whereas the VOC program narrows the window of years from which
companies could chose their peak activity levels to periods when
production levels were lower because of the recession; and (ii)
in the VOC program, everyone's initial allocation is shaved to
make up for what AQMD staff perceived as a shortfall from two
or three additional rules, which was not done under the NOx program.
<P>
<U>CURTIS COLEMAN, CMA Southern California Air Quality Alliance</U>

<P>
Agreed that the NOx program has been very successful, but pointed
out that the area of monitoring and reporting still remains probably
the most significant area where companies are still having problems
getting their CEMS to work properly, to interface properly with
the new RTUs, and to get the data reported to the AQMD. Staff
and industry need to continue working together to resolve those
problems.
<P>
<U>LEE WALLACE, Southern California Gas Company</U> 
<P>
Recommended that the Board ask the Clean Air Partner Award winners
to form a working group to address simplifying and reducing the
cost of monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping.
<P>
Expressing her full support of that recommendation, Ms. Leyden
indicated that staff will proceed to invite Clean Air Partner
Award winners to work with staff on developing ways of reducing
reporting costs.
<P>
<U>JOSH MARGOLIS, Cantor Fitzgerald Brokerage, L.P.</U> 
<P>
Elaborated on the success of the NOx/SOx Trading Market and gave
an overview of the three Clean Air Auctions that have occurred.
(Submitted Written Comments.)
<P>
<U>JOHN BILLHEIMER, Small Business Coalition</U> 
<P>
Recommended that when the AQMD produces lists of members of universes,
to sort the members not only by facility I.D. number and alphabetically
by company name, but to also include an SIC Code sort so that
industry groups can more efficiently examine their own impact.
<P>
Chairman Mikels asked that staff examine the possibility of SIC
Code sorting as suggested by Mr. Billheimer.
<P>
(Ms. Soto left at 12:20 p.m. during public testimony.)
<P>
ON MOTION OF DR. WILSON, SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ, A UNANIMOUS
VOTE WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Burke and
Soto) APPROVING THE FIRST ANNUAL RECLAIM AUDIT REPORT, AS RECOMMENDED
BY STAFF.
<P>
(Mr. Hewitt left at 12:35 p.m.)
<P>
25. Adopt Proposed Rule 518.2 - Federal Alternative Operating
Conditions
<P>
The staff report was presented by SSC Senior Manager Anupom Ganguli.
On January 11, 1996 EPA submitted a letter to staff (copies of
which were distributed to Board members and made available to
the public) suggesting addition of the following language to Proposed
Rule 518.2, which staff recommended inserting as Subparagraph
(e)(5):
<P>
<U><I>&quot;(5)</I></U><I> <U>The Hearing Board may deny a petition
for an Alternative Operating Condition if excess emissions resulting
from operation of a source pursuant to the Alternative Operating
Condition would, by themselves, cause an exceedance of a National
Ambient Air Quality Standard.&quot;</U></I> 
<P>
Staff further recommended the addition of the following sentence
to the end of proposed (e)(5), in response to industry representatives:
<P>
<U><I>&quot;The burden of proof on this issue, should it arise,
shall be upon the Executive Officer.&quot;</I></U> 
<P>
The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from
the following individuals:
<P>
<U>STEVE BROILES, Attorney, on behalf of the Cities of Burbank,
Glendale and Pasadena</U> 
<P>
Urged adoption of the proposed rule, which accomplishes all of
the objectives the three cities hoped to when they raised this
issue with the Board in June 1995.
<P>
<U>LEE WALLACE, Southern California Gas Company</U> 
<P>
Expressed strong support for the proposed rule, and urged the
Board to have staff continue to work with EPA to include protection
under Title V for NSPS and NESHAP requirements.
<P>
<U>GREG ADAMS, Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts</U> 
<P>
1) Expressed the following reservations: (I) the SIP allowance
bank for NOx and SOx in particular is unworkably low; (ii) concerned
with the length of time it takes to transfer ERCs to cover excess
emissions, but staff assures them they will streamline this process
to the best of their ability; (iii) not just ERCs should be eligible
for transferring, but universal trading credits derived from the
intercredit trading program should also be eligible; and (iv)
the AOC should encompass all federal rules contained within the
Title V Permit, in particular Federal NSPS and NESHAPS.
<P>
2) Recommend the following language contained in the staff report
be included in the proposed rule:
<P>
<I>&quot;In developing conditions for Alternative Operating Conditions,
the Hearing Board shall consider technical and economic factors
in determining whether the technology or monitoring required is
feasible.&quot;</I> 
<P>
<U>MIKE CARROLL, Attorney, on behalf of Regulatory Flexibility
Group</U> 
<P>
Supported adoption of the proposed rule; expressed concern that
(I) the 45-day EPA and public notice requirements for AOCs is
onerous, (ii) AOCs are not available for NSPS and NESHAP requirements,
and (iii) the SIP allowance may not have been properly funded;
hoped to be back before the Board at a later date to seek amendments
to Rule 518.2 to address these concerns.
<P>
<U>CURTIS COLEMAN, CMA Southern California Air Quality Alliance</U>

<P>
Expressed support and their desire that 518.2 be viewed as a work
in progress; and as additional areas of flexibility and ease of
administration arise at the state or federal level, that everyone
work together to resolve the issues
<P>
<U>DR. VLADAMIR KOGAN, Orange County Sanitation Districts</U>

<P>
Expressed full support of the proposed rule and asked for consideration
in the future of increasing the SIP allowances for VOC.
<P>
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is a joint presentation by the California Air Resources Board
and the Western States Petroleum Association and will provide
an overview of the progress made on the implementation of the
California Reformulated Gasoline (CaRFG) program. CaRFG is a state-mandated
program that requires production and use of a cleaner-burning
gasoline. The use of CaRFG will significantly reduce emissions
of unhealthful pollutants and help the AQMD meet its air quality
objectives.

<P>
At the January 12, 1996 meeting, the Board directed staff, at
the suggestion of Chairman Mikels, to evaluate several options
for providing regulatory relief for primary and secondary schools
subject to Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options.
A staff report has been prepared in response to this request and
is presented for Board consideration.

<P>
At the December 8, 1995 Board Hearing, the Board adopted Rule
2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options, and directed
staff to bring back information and necessary documents to allow
consideration of a possible exemption of primary and secondary
school districts. This report discusses background information
on the school exemption issues, including potential pollutant
emissions impacts. Rule language that would exempt primary and
secondary schools as well as other school district facilities
is provided in the event the Board elects to adopt such an exemption.

<P>
At its June 10, 1994, meeting, the Board approved a contract with
Telos Consulting Services (Telos) to provide system development
services on a task-by-task basis. This is a basic ordering agreement,
where specific work is defined, and individual task orders issued.
During the contract period, additional funding is needed as system
development requirements are identified. Staff recommends that
the contract be modified to add additional funding in the amount
of $100,000 to accommodate identified projects through June 1996.
Funding is included in the Fiscal Year 1995-96 budget for Information
Management to cover these expenses. This item was reviewed and
approved by the Administrative Committee on January 19, 1996.
<P>
<B> 5. <A HREF="960205.html">Reallocate Funds for Contracted Communication Services </A>to
Support Rule 701-Episode Forecast and Declaration Dissemination
to Schools <BR>
</B>Liu (909) 396-2105
<P>
Rule 701, as amended on September 8, 1995, removed the requirements
for schools and industry to maintain an antiquated radio system
to receive daily air quality forecast and episode declaration.
In its place, the AQMD committed to explore new-technology methods
to provide episode notification to school districts. Staff recommends
that the Board authorize the reallocation of $40,000 of budgeted
funds into the Professional and Special Services Account to fund
contractual services for providing a communications link to the
school districts. This item was reviewed and approved by the Administrative
Committee on January 19, 1996.
<P>
<B> 6. <A HREF="960206.html">Award a Contract to Privatize Portions of the Annual Emissions Report Program </A>
<BR>
Liu (909) 396-2105</B>
<P>
At its October 1995 meeting, the Board approved the release of
a Request for Proposals to privatize portions of the annual emissions
report program. All proposals submitted were evaluated and ranked
by a panel comprised of AQMD staff and representatives from The
Gas Company and the California Council for Environmental and Economic
Balance. Staff recommends that the Board award the contract to
the successful bidder. Funding is included in Planning and Policy's
FY 1995-96 budget. This item was reviewed and approved by the
Administrative Committee on January 19, 1996.

<P>
AQMD has used private sector source emission testing services
since 1987 to augment and enhance its source testing capabilities.
Applied Science and Technology proposes to continue this contracting
effort at a level between 125-150 source compliance tests annually,
beginning August 1, 1996. Such compliance testing will be conducted
using AQMD test methods in accordance with AQMD quality assurance
practices and subject to AQMD review. The maximum total dollar
amount to be contracted out is $300,000. This item was reviewed
and approved by the Administrative Committee on January 19, 1996.
<P>

<P>
Collective bargaining mediation discussions between AQMD management
and representatives of the San Bernardino Public Employees Association
resulted in a tentative agreement that was subsequently ratified
by members of the Professional Bargaining Unit. Under the terms
of the agreement, Professional Unit employees would, as of May
1, 1996, work the same Tuesday-through-Friday work week as other
AQMD employees. All other terms of the previous Memorandum of
Understanding would be extended through June 30, 1996. This recommendation
is to approve the ratified labor contract. This item arose after
the January 19, 1996 Administrative Committee meeting.

<BR>
Jason (909) 396-2065</B>
<P>
On March 10, 1995, the Board received and filed a report outlining
administrative policy and procedure changes made by the Executive
Officer relating to the purchase of nonconsultant services and
supplies. One of these changes was a requirement for establishing,
through Board approval, a list of prequalified vendors of such
services and supplies. Staff is recommending the release of a
Request for Quotations which will be used to establish a list
of pre-qualified vendors from whom competitive bids may be solicited
for mailing services as needed in the remainder of FY 1995-96
and through FYs 1996-97 and 1997-98. This item was reviewed and
approved by the Administrative Committee on January 19, 1996.

In April 1995, the Board initiated the Intercredit Trading Study.
The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of linking
the AQMD's mobile and stationary emissions credit trading programs
to increase compliance flexibility while achieving air quality
goals. In October 1995, AQMD staff released for public review
a draft paper on issues surrounding intercredit trading. Four
workshops were held in November. Based on public comments received,
staff is finalizing policy recommendations and an action plan
for rulemaking. Actual rulemaking would occur later. The report
will be made available prior to February public hearing.

notified the AQMD on January 30, 1996 that it has decided to terminate
the contract, and staff is requesting permission to develop a

2. Regulatory Relief Options for Primary and Secondary Schools 
Subject to Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options 
<P> 
3. Set Public Hearing March 8, 1996 to Amend Subdivision (l) of 
Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options, Pertaining 
to Possible Establishment of an Exemption for Primary and Secondary 
School Districts 
<P> 
Having learned recently that neither LAUSD Board Chairman Mark 
Slofkin nor Saddleback Valley School District Chairman Frank Uri 
had been informed that this issue had come before the Board and 
was scheduled for a public hearing in March, Mr. Hewitt asked 
that staff send a letter to each Board Chairman and Board member 
of the school districts subject to Rule 2202 notifying them of 
the Board's consideration--and the importance--of this issue. 
<P> 
Mr. Hewitt also expressed concern that, while the staff reports 
for Agenda Items 2 and 3 include an estimate of the per-employee 
cost, there is no analysis as to what the real dollar cost is 
after the subsidies are taken out. He asked that staff prepare, 
and submit to Board members for consideration at the March 8 hearing, 
a one-page document indicating the comparisons between what the 
costs are now, what an exemption would save, and what the other 
options would save. 
<P> 
Ms. Soto expressed her support for Mr. Hewitt's comments, and 
added that she would also like to know what feedback, if any, 
AQMD is receiving from the schools. 
<P> 
Expressing his support for an outright exemption of the schools 
in the South Coast region and his hope that other Board members 
would also support an exemption, Mr. Silva commented on the long 
history of ridesharing that schools throughout the nation have 
had in transporting children to school by bus and the fact that 
public schools operating on traditional calendars cease operation 
from mid-June to early-September--the peak smog season. He believed 
that the time and money spent by schools to comply with Rule 2202 
would be better spent in the classroom. 

staff agreed to prepare a written summary for the Board providing 
a forecast for the remainder of the year of projects that will 
be before the Board for approval. 

Ms. Soto commented on the amount of cost savings for this item 
($250,000) and suggested that staff look into other areas where 
this type of major savings can be achieved, including the ideas 
and products which Mr. Braude planned to suggest for Agenda Item 
No. 25 (Proposed Regulatory Reform Initiatives). She also asked 
that staff provide a chart showing the MBE/WBE/DVBE status for 
all of the proposals submitted, and each of the proposals' related 
scores; not only for this item, but for any future items regarding 
contracts. 

25. Proposed Regulatory Reform Initiatives 
<P> 
A presentation was given by James M. Lents, Ph.D., Executive Officer, 
in response to the Board's direction to staff at the January 12, 
1996 Board meeting to evaluate the potential to implement several 
regulatory reform initiatives proposed by Chairman Mikels. Staff's 
responses are summarized below. 
<UL> 
<LI><U><B>Reduce AQMD Staff by 50 Percent Over the Next Decade</B>.</U> 
This is possible, based on the following assumptions: (i) attainment 
of the CO standard by the Year 2000; (ii) attainment of the PM10 
standard by 2006; ozone attainment achieved by 2010; (iv) no unforeseen 
air pollution issues; (v) 2 percent cost of living increase; and 
<BR> 
(vi) 2 percent annual job growth in the small business sector. 
 
</UL> 
 
<UL> 
<LI><U><B>Eliminate Permits for Small Businesses</B></U>. A three-fold 
strategy is proposed: reduce permitting, increase registration, 
consolidate and simplify permits. Permits for many small sources 
could be replaced with a registration system which would have 
much simpler recordkeeping and a lot less documentation than the 
present permit system requires. Small sources that have multiple 
permits for their site could be issued a single site permit, as 
is presently being done with RECLAIM facilities; and eventually 
evolved to a single site registration program. The present program 
for pre-approved equipment could be expanded so that as small 
businesses purchase the pre-approved equipment, they would automatically 
fall under a registration system.  
</UL> 
 
<UL> 
<LI><U><B>Green Carpet Service for Businesses</B></U>. Staff suggested: 
(i) All AQMD employees complete a customer service program, as 
was done in 1992 and proved to be very beneficial; (ii) Accelerate 
permit processing particularly for designated businesses that 
are high employment and low polluting; and (iii) Develop marketing 
tools for the free offsets set aside under RECLAIM for new high 
employment/low polluting facilities in the basin.  
</UL> 
 
<UL> 
<LI><U><B>Remove the Hassle from Applying for Permits</B></U>. 
Staff proposed placing the permit application on the Internet 
and purchasing software which will guide the applicant through 
the permit process, thereby insuring completeness of application 
forms submitted. By Fall of 1996, three industry types--Gasoline 
Storage and Dispensing, Commercial Buildings, Asbestos Demolition 
and Renovation--should be able to submit applications electronically. 
After that, it will be expanded to permits for boilers and emergency 
standby engines; and in three years, staff would like to have 
all AQMD permit applications fully computerized.  
</UL> 
 
<UL> 
<LI><U><B>Mobile Sources and Consumer Products Bear their Fair 
Share</B></U>. The AQMD needs to: (i) continue to help ARB implement 
the CaRFG Program; and (ii) be active in the opposition of legislative 
proposals that would cut back on mobile source programs and ultimately 
force AQMD to adopt more stringent regulations for stationary 
sources.  
</UL> 
 
<UL> 
<LI><B>&quot;<U>Small Claims&quot; Type Process Needed for Variances</U>.</B> 
Staff is working with the California Council on Environmental 
and Economic Balance (CCEEB) on developing ways to make the variance 
process as simple as possible. Staff is also working on administrative 
procedures, and the Hearing Board has adopted a Consent Calendar 
procedure to handle cases where AQMD and industry have stipulated 
to facts.  
</UL> 
 
<UL> 
<LI><U><B>Amendment of AQMD's CEQA Reporting Procedure</B></U>. 
Staff will work with the authors of the various bills concerning 
CEQA to include language addressing streamlining issues.  
</UL> 
 
<UL> 
<LI><U><B>Provide Tax Breaks for Manufacturing or Installing Super 
Clean Pollution Control Equipment</B></U><B>.</B> There are several 
bills that would do this, which the Board voted to support in 
its action on Agenda Item No. 16 (Legislative Committee).  
</UL> 
 
<P> 
To follow up on the initiatives staff will: 
<P> 
-- Continue ongoing legislative activities. 
<P> 
-- Bring a Green Carpet Service plan back to the Board at its 
March 8, 1996 meeting. 
<P> 
-- By Fall of 1996, bring a report back to the Board on, and set 
up for, eliminating permits and shifting over to the registration 
system; and have at least three types of forms set up on the Internet 
to apply for permits electronically. 
<P> 
-- Follow the commitment to reduce AQMD's budget as projected, 
and if for any reason that downward slope cannot be maintained, 
staff will bring it to the Board's attention. 
<P> 
Mr. Braude complimented Dr. Lents on confronting the issues head 
on and presenting a forthright and prompt response; and requested 
the addition of four more items to the initiatives proposed by 
Chairman Mikels, as set forth below. 
<OL> 
<LI><I>Develop a comprehensive policy to address portable engines. 
Portable engines are regulated through many different rules: SCAQMD 
Regulations XIII (New Source Review), XXI (Portable Equipment 
Statewide Regulation), SCAQMD Rule 1110.2 (Emissions from Gaseous- 
and Liquid-Fueled Internal Combustion Engines), and EPA (40 CFR 
89) and state regulations. Portable engines are essential to many 
industrial, essential public service, and local government operations. 
Regulations need to be realistic, fiscally responsible, and preserve 
the portable nature of the equipment.<BR> 
</I> 
<LI><I>Streamline the process to certify and transfer emission 
reduction credits, both ERCs and MSERCs. This will be fundamental 
to the success of the proposed universal trading credit program. 
<BR> 
</I> 
<LI><I>Reaffirm the need to eliminate duplicative local, state, 
and federal requirements. Of special concern are the duplicative 
federal Clean Air Act requirements of Title V (Operating Permits) 
and Title III (Air Toxics). The statutory reform proposal should 
recognize the importance of Home Rule Working Group and provide 
for the support of legislative recommendations developed through 
that forum.<BR> 
</I> 
<LI><I>Establish RECLAIM facilities working group to simplify 
and reduce the cost of monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping, 
and address other RECLAIM implementation issues. This was agreed 
to by staff, at the January 12, 1996 Board meeting.</I>  
</OL> 
 
<P> 
Chairman Mikels indicated that staff should move ahead in the 
direction established by <BR> 
Dr. Lents as a way to implement the proposed reforms. 
<P> 
Both Ms. Soto and Mr. Paulitz disagreed with Dr. Lents with respect 
to cutting back on outreach after attainment has been achieved, 
because they believe significant outreach will be necessary to 
make the public aware of what must be done to maintain air quality 
attainment and to insure against backsliding. 
<P> 
Chairman Mikels pointed out that at the joint meeting with the 
Advisory Council on March 8, the significant issue that will be 
discussed is a &quot;white paper&quot; prepared by a subcommittee 
of the Advisory Council at his request to take a forward look 
at the AQMD beyond the year 2010--i.e., beyond attainment; and 
to give their best thought as to how the AQMD might change in 
terms of the allocation of its resources, its administrative organization, 
and its focus. One thing the subcommittee pointed out is, given 
the changes in demographic trends and housing patterns happening 
within the boundaries of the south coast basin, AQMD's outreach 
efforts may need to take on a different kind of perspective. Also, 
the subcommittee suggests that rather than simply &quot;pancaking&quot; 
the organization 50 percent across the board, to take a look at 
the functional components of the organization that can be eliminated 
altogether so that AQMD can concentrate its resources and do the 
best job in those areas that remain part of the focus of the organization. 
<P> 
Dr. Lents indicated that he would present a response to Mr. Braude's 
suggestions at the March 8, 1996 Board meeting. 
<P> 
Dr. Wilson added that one item was missing under the assumptions 
presented by <BR> 
Dr. Lents: the assumption that the state legislature will become 
responsible and stop passing frivolous legislation that requires 
unnecessary oversight and regulations on this district, which 
costs AQMD and those who pay the fees additional money. He believed 
that assumption should be included, and that message be made a 
part of the legislative program. 
<P> 
<U><B>PUBLIC HEARINGS</B></U> 
<P> 
26. Annual Report on the Air Toxics &quot;Hot Spots&quot; Risk 
Assessment Program 
<P> 
Ben Shaw, Senior Manager/SSC, presented the staff report, highlighting 
activities and progress through 1995 and providing a summary of 
anticipated activities during 1996. The public hearing was opened, 
and the Board heard testimony from the following individual: 
<P> 
<U><I>DR. VLADAMIR KOGAN, County Sanitation Districts of Orange 
County</I></U> 
<P> 
Asked that staff not make decisions about public notification 
based on HRAs that are five or more years old; but instead on 
the latest available HRA, so that the public receives current 
information. 
<P> 
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed. 
<P> 
27. Public Hearing to Receive Public Input on the Executive Officer's 
Program Goals/Objectives for Fiscal Year 1996-97 
<P> 
The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from 
the following individual: 
<P> 
<U><I>JOHN BILLHEIMER, Consultant</I></U> 
<P> 
Expressed his belief that there could be further development and 
clarity as to whether or not AQMD will be able to effectively 
regulate area sources such as consumer products, architectural 
coatings; mobile equipment; petroleum marketing permit; farm operations; 
and other surface coatings. (Submitted Written Comments.) 
<P> 
Dr. Lents responded that, while AQMD does have some authority 
in the area of consumer products, the legislature has adopted 
requirements that give authority to the ARB. With respect to architectural 
coatings, staff will be bringing a rule to the Board for adoption 
this year. Some of the AQMD's regulatory authority in the area 
of mobile equipment has been preempted by the legislature and 
placed elsewhere. 
<P> 
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed. 

28. Staff Recommendation and Rulemaking Action Plan on Intercredit 
Trading--Increasing Flexibility for AQMD's Mobile and Stationary 
Source Emissions Credit Programs 
<P> 
Barry Wallerstein, DEO of Planning, Technology and Information 
Management, presented the staff report. 
<P> 
The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from 
the following individuals: 
<P> 
<U><I>MICHAEL CARROLL, Attorney on behalf of RFG and COALESCE</I></U> 
<P> 
1) Expressed support for the concept of a broad based intersector 
trading program, and urged the Board to direct staff to move forward 
in that regard. 2) Submitted to Board members their proposal, 
&quot;The Clean Air Trust&quot;, which builds on AQMD's intersector 
trading proposal. The proposal by RFG and COALESCE includes three 
elements: (i) AQMD's existing NOx/SOx RECLAIM program; (ii) an 
open market trading program which includes many of the elements 
that are in AQMD's intersector trading proposal; (iii) an investment 
fund which would receive money from a variety of sources which 
could be used for investment in innovative clean air technologies. 
3) Proposed to come back to the Board at its March 8, 1996 meeting, 
after receiving input on their proposal from both AQMD staff and 
the environmental community and, at that time, give a detailed 
presentation on their proposal and a detailed response to AQMD's 
proposed intersector trading program. 
<P> 
<U><I>LEE WALLACE, The Gas Company</I></U> 
<P> 
Expressed support for staff's proposal; and pointed out that this 
AQMD policy should be flexible enough to provide for modifications 
or improvements that may result from either USEPA's open market 
trading or ARB's credit trading protocols being developed pursuant 
to <BR> 
AB 1777, as well trading programs from other jurisdictions such 
as the Ozone Transport Corridor in the northeast. 
<P> 
<U><I>JON OWYANG, Market-Based Solutions, Inc.</I></U> 
<P> 
Supported the staff proposal and stressed the need to make sure 
that if there are changes that are beneficial, that companies 
which made early decisions to support market-based programs also 
receive those benefits. 
<P> 
Dr. Lents pointed out that when staff began work on the intercredit 
trading program, they expected it to overlay NOx/SOx RECLAIM and 
the VOC RECLAIM program that staff was also developing. However, 
VOC RECLAIM was ultimately shelved because of the lack of sufficient 
consensus on the program. The purpose of the intercredit trading 
program is to help businesses trade credits and find the cheapest 
way to reduce emissions, and it does not have inherent within 
it an emissions reduction component. But in order to keep the 
attainment program moving forward in the absence of a VOC RECLAIM 
program, AQMD will have to adopt a number of rules. 
<P> 
In response to Mr. Silva's concern regarding duplication of efforts, 
Dr. Wallerstein stated that staff recently discussed coordination 
of efforts with ARB staff and EPA staff and believe AQMD will 
be able to move forward in a flexible enough manner that it will 
accommodate the work ARB is doing pursuant to AB 1777. 

29. Hearing to Consider Amendments to Subparagraph (f)(7) of Rule 
2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options Pertaining to 
Fees for the Air Quality Investment Program 
<P> 
The staff report was presented by Catherine Wasikowski, Director 
of Transportation Programs. 
<P> 
Ms. Soto commented that she does not support car scrapping, and 
has always voted against it. 
<P> 
Ms. Wasikowski responded that staff based its figures for AQIP 
costs on car scrapping because that was all that staff had experience 
with during the few months of the survey. However, other options 
will be presented to the Board as staff receives proposals for 
use of AQIP funds. 
<P> 
Based on his experience the past three years as the Board's representative 
on the MSRC, Mr. Paulitz issued a word of caution against proposals 
that include grandiose ways to reduce emissions, but fail to achieve 
those emission reductions. It is his belief that the only proposals 
where emission reductions are really going to occur are those 
involving hardware, such as a tailpipe, where the emission reductions 
can be easily determined. 
<P> 
The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from 
the following individuals: 
<P> 
<U><I>LEE WALLACE, The Gas Company</I></U> 
<P> 
Expressed concern that, while not opposed to car scrapping as 
an <I>option</I>, he believed the staff report made this appear 
like a car scrapping program; and he indicated that he looked 
forward to participating in the February 16 discussion on the 
use of AQIP monies. 
<P> 
<U><I>RON MERTZ, Eco-Scrap Inc.</I></U> 
<P> 
Presented a graph of the economics involved with one year AQIP 
buy-out at $60 and subsequent scrapping of vehicles for MSERCs; 
and emphasized the importance of ensuring, given the revenue stream 
that is proposed, that real, quantifiable reductions in emissions 
are achieved with AQIP funds. 
<P> 
<U><I>JON OWYANG, Old Vehicle Clearinghouse and Market-Based Solutions, 
Inc.</I></U> 
<P> 
Expressed support for the staff proposal, but believed it inappropriate 
to establish an arbitrary market value based on present cost, 
or perceived cost, for cleaning up the air. There are market alternatives 
that are going to continue to develop, and those market alternatives 
should be allowed to establish the true value. It was his belief 
that the AQIP should be viewed as a last resort and, if anything, 
the fee should be increased, and not decreased. 
<P> 
Mr. Hewitt expressed his belief that the AQIP fee should be set 
at a level one or two dollars above what it costs to scrap cars 
because, in his opinion, the most innovative approaches to achieving 
cost effective emission reductions will be through AQIP investments; 
and he will be pushing a host of different ways to improve the 
air that are outside of the normal envelope. He pointed out, however, 
that the Board could not decide where the fee should be set unless 
and until facilities have had a full opportunity to participate. 
Therefore, he suggested the hearing be continued until after the 
February 16, 1996 filing date in Rule 2202 and the February 16, 
1996 roundtable discussion on use of AQIP funds. 

MR. HEWITT MOVED TO CONTINUE THE PUBLIC HEARING TO THE APRIL 12, 
1996 BOARD MEETING. THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. SOTO.  
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
Dr. Wallerstein agreed that staff would have more information 
to provide to the Board at the continued hearing, but was doubtful 
that the additional time would change the staff recommendation. 
Staff did not recommend amending the fees downward, because staff 
believes that would undercut the marketplace and would erode AQMD's 
ability to produce equivalent emission reductions. With respect 
to staff's recommendation to prepare an RFQ to develop a qualified 
list of car scrappers, Dr. Wallerstein explained that staff was 
not suggesting that all AQIP funds be used for auto scrapping, 
but that a vendor's list would provide the Board a &quot;safety 
net&quot; for achieving equivalent emission reductions. 

MR. HEWITT AMENDED HIS MOTION TO CONTINUE THE PUBLIC HEARING TO 
THE APRIL 12, 1996 BOARD MEETING TO INCLUDE: DIRECT STAFF TO PREPARE 
A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS TO DEVELOP A QUALIFIED LIST OF CAR SCRAPPERS 
ELIGIBLE FOR AQIP FUNDS.  
</BLOCKQUOTE> 
 
<P> 
At Ms. Soto's request, staff agreed to make a presentation on 
this issue to the Home Rule Working Group. 
<P> 
Mr. Paulitz expressed concern regarding the equity to those who 
have already in good faith paid a fee if, after the roundtable 
discussion, the Board decides to raise or lower the AQIP fees. 
Agreeing that it would be unfair to those who have already paid 
for the Board to lower the fee, Mr. Hewitt indicated that if at 
the April Board meeting he were to make a motion to lower the 
fee, he would do so with an explicit refund provision to those 
who paid in at the <BR> 
$60-annual/$125-triennial level. 
<P> 
For the record, Mr. Silva disclosed the fact that he had met with 
representatives of the Garden Grove School District to discuss 
this matter and also Agenda Item No. 2. 

Work Program for the Final Component of the Zero-Emission Vehicle
&quot;Quick Charge&quot; Program <BR>
</B>Longville
<P>
As part of the FY 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program,
the MSRC proposed a three-component, $7 million Zero-Emission
Vehicle &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Program, including an Outreach
Coordinator, a buydown incentive, and an Electric Vehicle Corridor
Communities Program. The first two components were previously
approved by the Board. The EV Corridor Communities Program component
will assist communities in preparing for EVs by testing the consumer
market and demonstrating the infrastructure, permitting process,
and coordination necessary for the smooth introduction of larger
quantities of EVs. This RFP provides $600,000 for this effort,
including a $75,000 minimum award to each of the four counties.

<B>5. Award Sole-Source Contract to Southern California Association
of Governments for a Regional Transit Database Information Exchange
project as Part of the Fiscal Year 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary
Fund Work Program <BR>
</B>Longville
<P>
As part of the FY 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program,
the MSRC set aside $550,000 for a Regional Transit Database Information
Exchange project. The RTDIE will facilitate the interagency exchange
of transit route and schedule information for all fixed route
transit and rail operations within the AQMD through the Internet
or by making one phone call. The MSRC recommends that this project
be carried out by the Southern California Association of Governments
through a sole-source award. As a regional governmental agency,
SCAG is uniquely qualified to provide the project management necessary
to coordinate with the multiple transit agencies.
<P>
<B>6. <A HREF="960306.html">The AQMD's Program Cost Estimate for Implementing the Air Toxics </A>&quot;Hot
Spots&quot; Information and Assessment Act (AB 2588) During Fiscal
Year 1996-97 <BR>
</B>Broadbent (909) 396-3789
<P>
The Air Toxics &quot;Hot Spots&quot; Information and Assessment
Act requires air districts to transmit annually to CARB an AQMD
Board-approved cost estimate for local program implementation.
This proposed estimate must be approved and transmitted to CARB
before April 1, 1996 to be included in the state's new approved
fee rule. The AQMD cost estimate for FY 1996-97 is based on the
Three-Year Budget Forecast. Staff recommends approval of this
cost estimate and its transmittal to CARB. This was reviewed and
approved by the Stationary Source Committee on February 16, 1996.
<P>
<B>7. Issue a Request for Proposals for a Management Firm to Operate
the Diamond Bar Headquarters Cafeteria <BR>
</B>Jason (909) 396-2065
<P>
On August 2, 1991, the Board awarded a bid to ARA Services to
manage and operate the cafeteria at the Diamond Bar Headquarters
facility. This contract expires on March 31, 1996, and staff is
requesting permission to seek new bids in order to secure a new
contract.
<P>
<B>8. <A HREF="960308.html">Issue a Request for Proposals for Independent Audit Services</A>
<BR>
</B>Pearce (909) 396-2828
<P>
A financial audit is annually performed on the AQMD in compliance
with the Government Code and Single Audit Act of 1984. This audit
is performed by independent Certified Public Accountants, and
their reports are addressed to the Governing Board. The three-year
contract with the AQMD's current auditors expires on June 30,
1996. This RFP is for financial audit services for FYs 1995-96,
1996-97, and 1997-98. This was reviewed by the Administrative
Committee on February 16, 1996.
<P>
<B>9. <A HREF="960309.html">Fiscal Year 1995-96 Budget Transfer </A><BR>
</B>Pearce (909) 396-2828
<P>
At Board direction staff has periodically brought to the Governing
Board all necessary budget transfers occurring during the fiscal
year. Budget transfers are the result of Board actions, further
definition of programs approved in the budget, reorganizations,
or budget corrections. These transfers move moneys to the appropriate
expenditure accounts and do not require additional appropriations.

Pearce (909) 396-2828
<P>
Last year ARB recommended that the AQMD prepare a periodic report
to the Board on AQMD contract activity. This is the first semi-annual
report on the number of contracts let and dollar amounts for competitive
and sole-source contracts signed by the Executive Officer and
the Board Chairman. This report covers the contracts executed
during the first six months of FY 1995-96 (July 1 through December
31, 1995).

</B>Wasikowski (909) 396-3264<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:cwasikowski@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
(cwasikowski@aqmd.gov)<BR>

<P>
On September 8, 1995, the Governing Board approved the release
of an RFP to solicit proposals for Air Quality Investment Program
( AQIP) funds. Staff has reviewed and evaluated the proposals
received during the second quarter. The total amount available
for the contracts will be $414,545. The recommendations for the
contracts were reviewed by the Mobile Source Committee on February
23, 1996 and recommended for approval.
<P>
<B>12. <A HREF="960312.html">Execute a Contract to Cost-Share Heavy-Duty Vehicle Chassis Dynamometer Testing </A>to
Improve the Current Emissions Inventory and to Analyze the Impact
of Clean Fuels <BR>
</B>Abele (909) 396-3250
<P>
The current State model may not accurately reflect on-road heavy-duty
vehicle emissions or the impact of these vehicles on the inventory.
In this proposal, in-use heavy-duty vehicles of various weight
classes and fuel types will be recruited for emissions testing.
Data collected will be used to improve the on-road heavy-duty
vehicle emissions inventory, and to assess the benefits of clean
fuels. Staff recommends executing an agreement with the California
Air Resources Board in an amount not to exceed $200,000 to cost-share
this $850,000 project. This was reviewed by the Technology Committee
on February 13, 1996 and recommended for approval.
<P>
<B>13. <A HREF="960313.html">Execute a Contract to Cost-Share an Evaluation of Three-Way Catalyst Technology </A>for
Off-Road Equipment Powered by Gasoline and Liquefied Petroleum
Gas Engines <BR>
</B>Abele (909) 396-3250
<P>
Emission reduction goals have been established for off-road equipment
powered by gasoline and/or liquefied petroleum gas engines of
25 to less than 175 horsepower in the State Implementation Plan.
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the technical
feasibility of utilizing closed-loop three-way catalyst technology
on these engines in order to meet the SIP's targets. Staff recommends
executing an agreement with the California Air Resources Board
in an amount not to exceed $150,000 to cost share this $450,000
project. This was reviewed by the Technology Committee on February
13, 1996 and recommended for approval.
<P>
<B>14. Execute a Contract to Sponsor Follow-Up Emissions Testing
of High-Emitting Vehicles Recruited in Orange County Using Remote
Sensing Devices and Repaired <BR>
</B>Abele (909) 396-3250
<P>
In the Spring of 1995, the AQMD sponsored a project entitled &quot;Program
for the Use of Remote Sensing Devices to Detect High-Emitting
Vehicles,&quot; in which over 100 high-emitting vehicles were
recruited using remote sensing devices and repaired. Staff recommends
executing an agreement with the University and Community College
System of Nevada in an amount not to exceed $40,000 to conduct
a follow-up project to re-recruit these vehicles one year after
repair to evaluate the durability of the repairs. This was reviewed
by the Technology Committee on February 13, 1996 and recommended
for approval.
<P>
<B>15. <A HREF="960315.html">Execute a Contract to Cost Share the Evaluation of Fuel Cell Reformer Emissions </A>
<BR>
</B>Abele (909) 396-3250
<P>
The AQMP calls for deployment of ZEVs. Under current ARB definition,
fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) with fuel reformers cannot qualify as
ZEVs. On a life-cycle emissions basis, however, they are expected
to be as clean as battery-powered EVs. ARB, working closely with
AQMD, issued an RFP for a study to quantify emissions from FCVs
with on-board reformers. The evaluation team selected Acurex Environmental
to conduct this $250,000 study. Staff recommends executing a contract
with ARB to provide an AQMD cost share of $125,000. This was reviewed
by the Technology Committee on <BR>
February 13, 1996 and recommended for approval.
<P>
<B>16. <A HREF="960316.html">Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Development and Demonstration of a Propane Medium-Duty Engine </A>
<BR>
</B>Abele (909) 396-3250
<P>
Medium-duty vehicle applications, such as street sweepers, shuttle
buses and pickup and delivery trucks, lend themselves well to
the use of alternative fuels. Although there are several natural
gas engines available in the marketplace, there are no commercially
available propane-fueled medium-duty engines. Staff recommends
cosponsoring, in an amount not to exceed $313,400, The ADEPT Group
to develop and demonstrate a propane Cummins 6B engine in a shuttle
bus application with the City of Pasadena. The total estimated
cost of the project is about $2.5 million. This was reviewed by
the Technology Committee on February 13, 1996 and recommended
for approval.
<P>
<B>17. <A HREF="960317.html">Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Development and Demonstration of a Long-Range Natural-Gas Van </A>
<BR>
</B>Abele (909) 396-3250
<P>
Certain manufacturers have developed low-emission vehicles fueled
by automotive compressed natural gas (CNG). However, because of
space constraints for the CNG tanks, these vehicles are limited
in range to about half that of gasoline vehicles. CALSTART proposes
to develop a modified frame structure for the Dodge Ram Van to
incorporate larger CNG storage tanks and double the vehicle range.
The total estimated cost of this project is $750,000. Staff recommends
that a contract with CALSTART be executed for an amount not to
exceed $100,000. This was reviewed by the Technology Committee
on February 13, 1996 and recommended for approval.
<P>
<B>18. <A HREF="960318.html">Execute a Contract to Evaluate Allergens in Paved Road Dust and Airborne Particles </A>
<BR>
</B>Abele (909) 396-3250
<P>
The objective of this proposed study is to determine the contribution
of road dust to the toxicity of ambient particles (PM10). The
information can subsequently be used to determine the extent of
health benefits likely to be derived from road dust control measures
to achieve ambient PM10 target levels in different areas of the
Basin. Staff recommends cosponsoring this study by the California
Institute of Technology in an amount not to exceed $50,000. The
California Air Resources Board will provide $104,000 to cost-share
this study. This was reviewed by the Technology Committee on February
13, 1996 and recommended for approval.
<P>
<B>19. Amend Contract to Cost Share Year 3 of the GasRail USA
Program <BR>
</B>Abele (909) 396-3250
<P>
The Board previously authorized AQMD cost sharing for Years 1
and 2 of the four-year GasRail USA program. This is a cooperative
program conducted by Southwest Research Institute to develop and
demonstrate low-emitting natural gas locomotives. This $9.5 million
program is cost shared by ARB, DOE, SoCal Gas, General Motors
Electromotive Division, the Gas Research Institute, and the Southern
California Regional Rail Authority. The total cost of Year 3 is
estimated to be $1,555,000. Staff recommends an AQMD cost share
of $500,000 for Year 3. This was reviewed by the Technology Committee
on February 13, 1996 and recommended for approval.
<P>
<B>20. <A HREF="960320.html">Adopt Technology Advancement Plan and Include it in the Clean Fuels Program </A>
<BR>
</B>Abele (909) 396-3250
<P>
The proposed Technology Advancement Plan for the Clean Fuels Program
outlines planned project expenditures for the balance of Fiscal
Year 1995-96 in accord with SB 199 (Kelley). This legislation
includes a requirement that research, development, and demonstration
projects for vehicle applications within the AQMD's Clean Fuels
Program do not duplicate the efforts of 69 different organizations.
Based on communications with these organizations, staff has determined
that the projects proposed in the Plan are not duplicative. The
Plan will be updated periodically to reflect new developments.
This was reviewed by the Technology Committee on February 13,
1996 and recommended for approval.

<P>
At the February 9, 1996 meeting, Councilman Braude proposed several
regulatory reform initiatives in addition to those introduced
at the January 12, 1996 meeting. The Governing Board directed
staff to evaluate the potential to implement these additional
regulatory reforms.

<B>39. Regulatory Reform Initiative - &quot;Green Carpet&quot;
Priority Permitting Service <BR>
</B>Coy (909) 396-2434
<P>
During the last two years, AQMD has worked closely with a number
of companies to expedite permitting for certain large, complex
projects. This experience has been very successful. The Board's
Regulatory Reform Initiative offers similar green-carpet service
to projects that meet certain environmental, technology or job
creation criteria. A pilot project is proposed to evaluate implementation
of this concept. The details of the pilot project have been developed
in collaboration with the California Council for Environmental
&amp; Economic Balance (CCEEB). This was reviewed by the Stationary
Source Committee on January 19 and recommended for approval.

This report identifies and evaluates various treasury management

of implementing each option. Over the last several months the
Administrative Committee has been reviewing AQMD's investment
and cash management programs performed by the County of Los Angeles.
Based upon concerns highlighted by the Orange County bankruptcy,
the Administrative Committee has directed staff to provide to
the Board an objective comparison of the various treasury management
options available to the AQMD and the costs, risks, and benefits
associated with each recommendation. This was reviewed by the
Administrative Committee on February 16, 1996.

<P>
The rescinding of Rule 1129 and proposed amendment of the other
coating rules are necessary to make AQMD rules consistent with
Section 41712 of the state Health and Safety Code which prohibits
local districts from enforcing or regulating VOC limits on aerosol
coatings. In addition, the proposed amendment of the definition
of &quot;exempt compounds&quot; in each rule will reference Rule
102 - Definition of Terms, to provide a consistent definition
between rules.

Proposed amendments regarding the destruction of engine blocks
are recommended to: 1) make Rule 1610 more flexible in enabling
antique and classic car enthusiasts to salvage engine parts, and
2) provide added options for auto dismantlers to render engines
inoperable. The revised rule language would allow for alternative
methods to render the engine inoperable and would allow the classic
car enthusiasts to rebuild these engines to their original emissions
certification standards.

<P>
In April 1995, the Board initiated the Intercredit Trading Study.
The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of linking
the AQMD's mobile and stationary emissions credit trading programs
to increase compliance flexibility while achieving air quality
goals. In October 1995, AQMD staff released for public review
a draft paper on issues surrounding intercredit trading. Four
workshops were held in November. Based on public comments received,
staff finalized policy recommendations and an action plan for
rulemaking. Actual rulemaking would occur later. The report was
made available prior to the February public hearing.

<P>
On December 8, 1995, the Governing Board adopted Rule 2202, and
directed staff to bring back information and necessary documents
to allow consideration of a possible exemption of primary and
secondary school districts. At the January 12, 1996 meeting, the
Governing Board directed staff to evaluate several options for
providing regulatory relief for primary and secondary school districts.
This report discusses background information on these issues and
provides several options for providing regulatory relief for schools,
including exemption from Rule 2202 requirements. This report was
discussed at the Mobile Source Committee Meeting on February 23,
1996.

In response to a question by Mr. Silva, SCAG representative Lori
Hunter indicated that if the funds are depleted before Phase II
is completed, SCAG would still be able to maintain the database
management and operation with their existing staff.<BR>

<P>
In order to insure that SCAG does not seek additional funding
from the MSRC if they expend the entire $550,000 recommended,
Ms. Lee suggested the Board place a restriction on this item to
limit the funding to no more than $550,000 and specify that any
additional funding needed will be obtained by SCAG from sources
other than the MSRC.<BR>

Ms. Soto commented that she recently learned that the cost-effectiveness

AQMD's process for selecting the most effective and affordable

AQMD.<BR>

<P>
Ms. Soto expressed her belief that staff's distribution of the
reports should be more extensive so that the information reaches
the end users of clean fuel technology, as well as existing and
potential manufacturers. She mentioned press releases and presentations

<P>
32 (A)  Consider February 16, 1996 Legislative Committee Agenda
Including Recommended Positions, Receive Additional Legislative
Information, and Consider Recommendations on AQMD-Related Bills
<BR>

<P>
Mr. Hewitt commented that the urgency matters were dealt with
at a special meeting held by the Board on February 23, 1996, and
the Board adopted legislative positions at that time. The reason
this item was originally placed on the agenda was because there
were only two members of the Legislative Committee present at
its last meeting, and they did not want to take a position that
did not reflect the consensus of the full Committee. He suggested
that those matters which are not urgent--requiring Board action
at this time--be referred to the next meeting of the Legislative
Committee.<BR>

<P>
Legislative Director Catherine Witherspoon agreed with Mr. Hewitt's
assessment that the bills are not urgent, but noted for the Board's
information that AB 924 (Rainey)--Air Quality: Standards, will
be heard in the Senate Local Government Committee on March 20,
1996, prior to the Legislative Committee's next meeting on March
22, 1996. Staff recommended the Board adopt an &quot;oppose&quot;
position on AB 924, but noted that it is a relatively low-priority
bill for the AQMD.<BR>

AND SB 2130 BACK TO THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE.<BR>
</blockquote>

<P>
Ms. Witherspoon reported briefly on AB 924, a bill sponsored by
Western States Petroleum Association and primarily aimed at the
Bay Area AQMD, which has attained the federal ozone standard and
is on the verge of attaining the state standard. The reason why
it is significant for AQMD is because of the policy question it
raises as to whether each jurisdiction should be deciding what
the attainment goal is, and because it introduces cost/benefit
analyses precisely at the point in time when it is most difficult
to ascertain. This bill, for the first time, would say that districts
are obliged to quantify the benefit of being in attainment; where
presently the law simply presumes that it is a worthwhile end.
Therefore staff recommended an &quot;oppose&quot; position consistent
with past practice that these are goals set by the state and should
be uniform in application.<BR>

<P>
(Mr. Antonovich arrived at 10:15 a.m.)<BR>

<P>
Mr. Hewitt and Mr. Silva expressed their belief that it would
be premature for the Board to take a position at this time, and
suggested the Board take a &quot;no position&quot; position until
more insight can be gained as to how the bill may be amended.
<BR>

<P>
Chairman Mikels suggested an &quot;oppose unless amended&quot;
position because of the significant issues involved in the bill.

37 (A)  Adoption of Committee Procedures<BR>

<P>
Procedural requirements for standing Board committees were proposed
by Chairman Mikels for adoption by the Board. Modifications to
those proposed procedures were proposed by Mr. Braude, and copies
distributed to Board members.<BR>

<P>
Chairman Mikels called for a motion to approve the proposed Procedures
for Standing Committees of the Governing Board. Once that motion
was on the floor, the Board could then consider motions to amend
the main motion to make modifications to the procedures.<BR>

<P>
DR. WILSON MOVED TO ADOPT THE PROCEDURES FOR STANDING COMMITTEES
OF THE GOVERNING BOARD. THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD.
<BR>

<B>(a) Establishment of Committees.<BR>
</B>
<P>
There were no modifications to the proposed procedure.<BR>

<P>
<B>(b) Committee Membership.<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mr. Braude suggested changing the maximum committee membership
from six to five because he believed the more members there are
on a committee, the less power and significance each member has;
and the less incentive there is for any individual member to attend
the committee meetings.<BR>

<P>
Dr. Wilson commented that restructuring the membership of all
the committees was going beyond the intent of this item, which
is to set up procedures and guidelines.<BR>

<P>

<P>
<B>(c) Authority of Committees.<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mr. Braude commented that the Board should acknowledge the distinction
between a communication from one or two Board members and a recommendation
of a committee. Requiring a majority of the committee members
to make a recommendation would provide such a distinction. If
there is not a majority of the members of a committee present
at a committee meeting to make a recommendation, then the position
of those committee members present should be in the form of a
communication to the Board.<BR>

<P>
THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. BRAUDE.<BR>

<P>
Ms. Lee expressed opposition to the proposed modification to require
a majority of committee members in order to make a recommendation
to the Board. She pointed out that some members attend committee
meetings regularly; and others, because of their schedule, prior
commitments, and various reasons, do not. If the Board adopted
the proposed modification, typical attendance for some committees,
such as the Stationary Source Committee, would result in the committee
never making a recommendation to the Board. This would lengthen
Board meetings because all of the items considered by the committees
would have to be brought before the full Board, if there was less
than a majority of committee members present at the committee
meetings.<BR>

<P>
Ms. Haggard commented that she did not want to see the Board set
artificial barriers that would discourage committee members from
attending committee meetings; but believed instead that Board
members should voluntarily remove themselves from the committee
if they cannot attend the committee meetings.<BR>

<P>
With respect to proposed Paragraph (c)(6), Mr. Loveridge expressed
concern with committee members using staff to draft minority reports,
and suggested that the committee members prepare such reports.
The maker and second of the motion accepted Mr. Loveridge's suggestion
as an amendment to the motion.<BR>

Ms. Lee questioned how the motion would affect committees with
only three or four members. Also, the motion seemed redundant
to her since the Board had already acted to adopt the procedures
[(c)(4) &amp; (c)(5)] requiring a majority of the committee present,
and approval of the majority of that committee to submit a committee
recommendation to the Board.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Hewitt expressed his belief that at least two members of the
committee, in addition to the Board Chair, should be present to
conduct public business. If committee members are not willing
to attend the committee meetings, then the committee should not
meet.<BR>

<P>
Explaining that the intent of his motion was to allow a committee
meeting to be held with less than three committee members present,

Dr. Lents indicated that, in the interest of time, staff would

<BR>

<P>
Chairman Mikels stated that Bill Quinn (California Council for

44. Consider Regulatory Relief Options and an Amendment to Subdivision
(l) of Rule 2202 -<BR>
On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options, Pertaining to Possible
Establishment of an Exemption for Primary and Secondary School
Districts<BR>

<P>
Catherine Wasikowski, Transportation Programs Director, gave the
staff report; and noted additional amendments proposed by staff
to include an exemption for primary and secondary school districts
experiencing financial hardship, and to add &quot;County Office
of Education&quot; to the definition of school district. Copies
of the additional amendments were distributed to Board members
and made available to the public.<BR>

<P>
In response to a question by Ms. Soto, Ms. Wasikowski noted that
the issue of including private schools was brought up to the Mobile
Source Committee members, but there was no decision made by the
Committee for staff to perform further analysis. Therefore, staff
continued with analyzing primary and secondary public school sites.
Mr. Antonovich indicated that he would like the Board to consider
including parochial and private schools, and would make a motion
to make that amendment when appropriate.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Silva asked whether schools with busing transportation for
their students would be in a better position to get credits than
those where most children either walk or ride their bicycles to
school.<BR>

<P>
Ms. Wasikowski responded that in surveying the school districts,
staff found that approximately 98 percent of them would receive
the credits for busing recommended by staff. The other 2 percent
would have the option, under Subparagraph (f)(8) of the rule to
propose other means of achieving the trip reductions, such as
students walking or riding bicycles to school.<BR>

<P>
The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from
the following individuals:<BR>

<P>
<U>MIKE SPENCE, West Covina Unified School District<BR>
</U>
<P>
Expressed support for the 2 students-to-1 employee busing ratio
proposed by staff, but preferred a blanket exemption for schools
because it would allow them to devote their staff time and resources
to educating children.<BR>

<P>
ALAN TRUDELL, Garden Grove School District
<P>
<U>ALAN TOMIYAMA, Los Angeles Unified School District<BR>
</U>
<P>
Expressed support for the staff recommendation.<BR>

<P>
In response to Mr. Hewitt, Mr. Tomiyama estimated that over the
last five years, <BR>
Rule 2202/Regulation XV has cost them over $2.5 million, not including
indirect costs. If the staff recommendation is adopted, those
costs would be significantly reduced.<BR>

<P>
<U>JUDITH CIANCIMINO, Westchester neighborhood school<BR>
</U>
<P>
Suggested that the Board add carpools/vanpools if the Board includes
parochial and private schools, because the majority of children
in most private schools are already in a vanpool or carpool.<BR>

<P>
(Ms. Soto left at 12:00 p.m., and Mr. Braude left at 12:15 p.m.)
<BR>

<P>
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.

exemption for primary and secondary schools at the February 9,
1996 Board meeting, <BR>

<P>
MR. SILVA MOVED TO EXEMPT PUBLIC, PAROCHIAL AND PRIVATE PRIMARY
AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 2202. THE
MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. HEWITT.<BR>

<P>
Dr. Wilson expressed his opposition to the motion because he felt
it would set a precedent. Next would be counties, then cities,
and then every public entity.<BR>

<P>
Chairman Mikels commented that, while he was supportive of the
intent of the motion, he opposed the impact of the motion. By
including public schools in the rule, the emission reductions
from their school busing programs (approximately 1 ton per day)
can be claimed in the AQMP. That amount of emission reductions
could be even greater if demonstrated by further analysis of students
walking, bicycling and carpooling. With an outright exemption
of schools, credit for those emission reductions would not be
counted and could not be claimed in the AQMP. Therefore, he could
not support the motion.<BR>

<P>
Speaking in support of the motion, Mr. Hewitt commented that schools
face a constant battle to raise funds to add improvements into
the schools, and he was therefore supportive of reducing their
compliance costs as much as possible.<BR>

<P>

<P>
Jack Broadbent, Assistant DEO/Stationary Source Compliance, gave
the staff report. Industry representatives had requested of staff,
and would request the Board, to reinstate a small container (one
quart or less) exemption in Rule 1113 - Architectural Coatings.
If reinstated, this exemption would potentially have air quality
impacts. Presently, coating manufacturers are operating under
product variances, and staff believes that reinstating the exemption
would potentially result in continuing the air quality impact
that currently exists as a result of those variances. Nevertheless,
staff believes such an exemption should be placed in the rule;
and therefore, it should go through the rulemaking process and
be subject to an environmental assessment pursuant to CEQA requirements.
Staff is committed to bringing a proposed rule amendment to reinstate
the small container exemption back to the Board, under an expedited
rule development schedule, at the August 9, 1996 Board meeting.
The Resolution for this item was revised by staff to include that
commitment, copies of which were distributed to the Board and
make available to the public.<BR>

43. Staff Recommendation and Rulemaking Action Plan on Intercredit
Trading--Increasing Flexibility for AQMD's Mobile and Stationary
Source Emissions Credit Programs<BR>

<P>
Barry Wallerstein, DEO of Planning and Information Management,
gave the staff report. The public hearing was opened, and the
Board heard testimony from the following individuals:<BR>

<P>
<U>LEE WALLACE, Southern California Gas Company<BR>
</U>
<P>
Urged the Board to adopt the staff report, with the additional
design principles contained in written comments submitted by CCEEB;
and expressed opposition to the addition of an emission factor
offset discount, which staff proposes to evaluate as part of the
1997 AQMP and apply in the future, because it would further complicate
an already difficult problem of establishing a universal trading
credit and a common trading market and almost any way that could
be devised to extract additional emission reductions from trading
activities would be unfair.<BR>

<P>
<U>BILL QUINN, CCEEB<BR>
</U>
<P>
Recommended that the Board approve the staff report and incorporate
into the report six additional design principles which were agreed
to, and developed with input, by AQMD staff. (Submitted Written
Comments)<BR>

<P>
RON WILKNISS, WSPA
<P>
GREG ADAMS, Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts
<P>
FRANK DRYDEN, Southern California Alliance of POTWs
<P>
<U>DEBORAH KURILCHYK, Southern California Edison (SCE) <I>(Submitted
Written Comments</I>)<BR>
</U>
<P>
Expressed support for the concept of an intercredit trading program,
and urged the Board not to foreclose on options--such as use of
credits generated by shutdowns and use of credits to comply with
existing rule requirements--at this stage; but rather to ask staff
to develop rules and design the program for maximum flexibility.
Ms. Kurilchyk added SCE's support of the free exchange of all
credits, provided the Board put in place a corrective mechanism
that can be used if problems occur with air quality attainment,
the price of credits, or credit supply and demand.<BR>

<P>
GAIL RUDERMAN-FEUER, Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)
<P>
<U>TIM CARMICHAEL, Coalition for Clean Air <BR>
</U>
<P>
Supported the concept of a market trading program and urged the
Board to direct staff to follow through with development of the
program; but expressed concerns regarding: (i) the offset requirement,
because in their view, this program will only work and should
only be pursued and then adopted if there is an environmental
benefit; (ii) banking, which they are generally concerned and
opposed to, and believe AQMD needs to make sure that these credits
are not being saved up and then in the Year 2010 have a spike
of credits coming into the market; (iii) the potential impacts
that interseasonal trading could have on toxic emissions; and
(iv) the trust fund idea, which they suggest the Board have staff
study at this time, and not start right away with rulemaking on
that issue. (Written Comments Submitted Jointly by NRDC, Coalition
for Clean Air and American Lung Association)<BR>

<P>
<U>BOB WYMAN, RFG and COALESCE<BR>
</U>
<P>
Encouraged the Board to include the full range of options; not
only in the intercredit trading program that AQMD staff is proposing,
but also a clean air trust fund, which would be an expansion of
the AQIP. (Submitted Written Comments)<BR>

<P>
<U>JOHN BILLHEIMER, Consultant<BR>
</U>
<P>
Expressed support of an intercredit trading program, and suggested
bringing the emissions inventory into the discussion early on
in development of the program. (Submitted Written Comments)<BR>

<P>
<U>SHIPRA BANSAL, Communities for a Better Environment<BR>
</U>
<P>
Expressed opposition to intercredit trading, specifically the
banking, which would allow credits to have an indefinite life;
the various forms of creating ERCs, which they believe will create
more pollution than already exists; and the interpollutant trading,
which they believe has many problems and is not a viable concept
at all.<BR>

<P>
<U>DEE ALLEN, City of Los Angeles<BR>
</U>
<P>
Supported, in concept, the market trading program and encouraged
the Board to direct staff to consider four specific items throughout
the next phases of the program: One, to identify and mitigate
any localized air pollution impacts from a trading program; Second,
keep all options open so that if in the middle of the process
staff feels it does not work, staff will have the flexibility
to consider other options; Third, establish a monitoring element
as a component of the trading program to ensure that the cost
of compliance and emission reduction is not shifted from one source
to the other and that the cost of the credits do not significantly
restrict economic growth activity; and Lastly, to work with the
affected parties to resolve issues concerning the trading of ERCs
and post-1998 RTCs.<BR>

<P>
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<BR>

<P>
MR. HEWITT MOVED TO APPROVE THE INTERCREDIT TRADING STUDY, AS
MODIFIED BY THE AGREEMENT REACHED BETWEEN AQMD STAFF AND CCEEB

42. Amend Rule 1610 - Old Vehicle Scrapping<BR>

<P>
In the interest of time, staff waived an oral report on this item.
The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from
the following individuals:<BR>

<P>
<U>RAY BEGGS, Association of California Car Clubs<BR>
</U>
<P>
Supported the proposed amendments, and an additional amendment
to extend the time period that engine blocks will be available
to hobbyists.<BR>

<P>
<U>FRANK BOHANAN, Specialty Equipment Market Association<BR>
</U>
<P>
Expressed support for the proposed amendment to Rule 1610 to include
a Code of Conduct, which will protect the interests of automotive
hobbyists without compromising air quality or imposing additional
burden on the dismantlers.<BR>

<P>
<U>JON OWYANG, Old Vehicle Clearinghouse<BR>
</U>
<P>
Supported, in concept, the proposed amendments; and asked that
the five-day period for destruction of the engine block be changed
to ten days because of time needed for DMV clearance on the vehicles.
<BR>

<P>
Henry Hogo, Planning &amp; Rules Manager, indicated that staff
was agreeable to changing the five-day period to ten days, as
requested.<BR>

<BR>
</B>Liu (909) 396-2105
<P>
Proposed Rule 1623 will provide a mechanism for generating MSERCs
for either voluntarily replacing old high-polluting lawn and garden
equipment with new low- or zero-emission equipment, or for selling
new low- or zero-emission equipment without replacement. The proposed
rule will meet the 1994 AQMP commitment for control measures MOF-03
and MOF-04, as well as provide incentives to accelerate the retirement
of old high-polluting equipment and increase the penetration of
new low- or zero-emission equipment.

Index for certain types of equipment, alternative fee methodologies
to recover AQMD and state costs under the AB 2588 Air Toxics &quot;Hot
Spots&quot; program, adjustments to the fee schedule for toxic
air contaminants, exemptions for acetone and three other air contaminants
for the payment of annual operation permit emissions fees, adjustments

<P>
The MSRC identified an additional $6 million in AB 2766 Discretionary
Program funds which it has decided to utilize in a supplement
to the FY 1995-97 Work Program. The supplemental work program
would consist of the following five elements: 1) $725,000 for
innovative TCM programs, including bicycle transportation, market
incentives, and broad-based, land-use training for elected officials;
2) $850,000 to augment the EV Corridor Communities Program; 3)
$900,000 for additional research and development projects; 4)
$1.8 million for alternative-fueled heavy-duty vehicles, targeting
refuse and interstate trucks; and 5) $1.8 million for advanced
battery demonstration projects.

<BR>
</B>Baird (909) 396-2302
<P>
From time to time the AQMD requires the assistance of outside
litigation counsel having expertise and experience in areas including,
but not limited to, CEQA law, air quality laws, administrative
law, representation of government agencies, constitutional issues,
and complex environmental litigation. The purpose of this RFP
is to solicit qualified law firms or sole practitioners to establish
a pre-qualified list that District Counsel may use to represent
the AQMD in possible future litigation where outside counsel is
required. The maximum total dollar amount that may be contracted
out is $120,000 per year.
<P>
<B>7. Amend Contracts with Telos Consulting Services and Mosakin
Corporation to Increase the Funding for Systems Development Work
<BR>
</B>Mathur (909) 396-2722
<P>
At its June 10, 1994 and May 12, 1995 meetings, the Board approved
contracts with Telos Consulting Services and Mosakin Corporation
to provide system development services on a task-by-task basis.
During the contract period, additional funding is needed as new
requirements are identified. Staff recommends that contracts be
modified to add funding in the amount of $255,000 for Telos and
$60,000 for Mosakin, to accommodate projects through June 1996.
Funding is included in the Fiscal Year 1995-96 Budget. This item
was reviewed by the Administrative Committee on March 22, 1996
and recommended for approval.
<P>
<B>8. <A HREF="96048a.html">Amend Contract with Sierra Cybernetics to Increase Funding to Develop Systems for Electronic Permit Application Filing </A>
<BR>
</B>Mathur (909) 396-2722
<P>
To expeditiously implement the Board's Regulatory Reform Initiative
to enable electronic filing of permit applications over the Internet,
it is necessary to design and develop a computer system, which
can be done most cost-effectively by amending an existing contract
with Sierra Cybernetics to provide additional funding in the amount
of $49,000. This was reviewed by the Stationary Source Committee
on March 22, 1996 and recommended for approval.
<P>
<B>9. <A HREF="96049a.html">Amend Contract with Shute, Mihaly &amp; Weinberger for Continuing Litigation </A>
<BR>
</B>Baird (909) 396-2302
<P>
In response to a 1993 RFP, AQMD selected Shute, Mihaly &amp; Weinberger
as one of two firms assisting District Counsel in handling litigation.
The firm currently is leading the defense on two key cases challenging
NOx and SOx RECLAIM, and is assisting on a number of other cases.
Fiscal year 1995-1996 expenses to date are approximately $40,000;
it is estimated that an additional $20,000 will be needed, bringing
the total to $60,000.
<P>
<B>10. <A HREF="960410a.html">Amend Contract with Stradling, Yocca, Carlson &amp; Rauth for Specialized Legal Services</A>
<BR>
</B>Baird (909) 396-2302
<P>
In response to an Administrative Committee request for advice
concerning possible effects of a Los Angeles County bankruptcy
on District finances, the AQMD contracted with Stradling, Yocca,
Carlson &amp; Rauth to provide the requested opinion. During performance
of that work, an urgent need arose for legal assistance in connection
with the potential sale of the El Monte facility and the firm's
real estate department has been handling that work. Expenses to
date are estimated at approximately $45,000 for these two tasks;
it is estimated that an additional $15,000 will be needed in this
Fiscal Year, bringing the total to $60,000.
<P>
<B>11. <A HREF="960411a.html">Execute a Contract to Cost-share the Development of the Interstate Clean Transportation Corridor </A>
<BR>
</B>Abele (909) 396-3250
<P>
Use of alternative fuels in medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the
Basin could significantly reduce their emissions. However, many
of these trucks come into California from other states. Until
the alternative fuel infrastructure can support interstate trucks,
a large percentage of fleets cannot use alternative fuels. The
proposed contract with Gladstein &amp; Associates will design
an alternative fuel infrastructure to link Arizona, California,
Nevada, and Utah. Total estimated project costs are $413,000.
AQMD funding shall not exceed $50,000. This was reviewed by the
Technology Committee on March 21, 1996 and recommended for approval.
<P>
<B>12. <A HREF="960412a.html">Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Demonstration of Alternative Fuel Vehicles in a Rental Fleet Application </A>
<BR>
</B>Abele (909) 396-3250
<P>
Car rental companies in the Basin operate thousands of vehicles.
These companies have been reluctant to incorporate alternative
fuel vehicles into their operations because they are uncertain
about vehicle reliability and acceptance. The proposed contract
with Sunline Transit Agency will facilitate the introduction of
natural gas vehicles into The Hertz Corporation fleet at Palm
Springs Airport, and provide comparative data collection among
natural gas, methanol, and gasoline vehicles. Total project cost
is approximately $1,500,000; AQMD costshare is $38,000. This was
reviewed by the Technology Committee on March 21, 1996 and recommended
for approval.

<B>13. Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Demonstration of Photovoltaic-Integrated
Roofs in a Residential Development <BR>
</B>Abele (909) 396-3250
<P>
Nehemiah West Housing Corporation (NWHC), a non-profit entity
created to provide affordable suburban-style housing in Los Angeles,
has proposed to install photovoltaic (PV)-integrated roofs, generating
2 kW each, on 12 new single-family homes in Compton. Traditionally,
PV panels are placed on the roof. This project, however, breaks
new ground in that the roofs themselves shall consist of PV shingles.
Total project cost of $300,000 would be co-sponsored with Enertron
Consultants, working for NWHC; AQMD costshare is $100,000. This
was reviewed by the Technology Committee on March 21, 1996 and
recommended for approval.

<BR>
</B>Abele (909) 396-3250
<P>
The AQMP emphasizes the use of fuel cell and battery-powered ZEVs
as an air-quality attainment strategy. McKesson Water Products
(Sparkletts) has proposed to develop and demonstrate a battery-powered
electric water delivery truck. Such water delivery trucks start
and stop over 200 times per day, and have greater emissions than
indicated by their daily use of 70 miles. The cost of the Sparkletts`
demonstration program is $377,000, of which AQMD would cost-share
in an amount not to exceed $175,000. This was reviewed by the
Technology Committee on March 21, 1996 and recommended for approval.

<P>
Six existing vehicles in the AQMD's AFV Fleet (Lease) Demonstration
Program need to be replaced. Four new low-emission vehicles and
two electric-assist bicycles can be purchased at a cost estimated
not to exceed $100,000, including tax and license. The low-emission
vehicles are: a Ford Taurus fuel flexible vehicle powered by methanol
and one natural-gas-powered version of each of the following:
Ford Crown Victoria, Ford F-Series pick-up truck, and Dodge Ram
pick-up truck. This was reviewed by the Technology Committee on
March 21, 1996 and recommended for approval.

In order to operate a modern efficiently functioning air monitoring
network, consistent with the projected declining revenue in the
years ahead, staff proposes a modernization and streamlining program.
Over the next decade, network size will be reduced from 35 to
22 permanent sites. Additionally, modernization of station equipment
will introduce automation as well as remote diagnosis and calibration
of equipment, resulting in labor savings which will more than
offset the capital equipment costs. This was reviewed by the Administrative

During the last few years, AQMD has worked closely with a number
of companies to expedite permitting for certain large complex
projects. This experience has been very successful. The Board's
Regulatory Reform Initiative offers similar green-carpet service
to projects that meet certain environmental, technology or job
creation criteria. A pilot project is proposed to evaluate implementation
of this concept. The details of the pilot project have been developed
in collaboration with the California Council for Environmental
&amp; Economic Balance (CCEEB). This was reviewed by the Stationary
Source Committee on January 19 and recommended for approval.

33. Regulatory Reform Initiative - &quot;Green Carpet&quot; Priority
Permitting Service<BR>

<P>
David Schwien, Senior Air Quality Engineering Manager, reported
on the proposed pilot study to evaluate implementation of the
Board's Business Clean Air Partnership and Regulatory Reform Initiative
with respect to providing green carpet priority permitting service
to projects that meet certain environmental, technology or job
creation criteria.<BR>

<P>
Expressing her concern that there was not enough emphasis being
placed on training for inexperienced applicants, Ms. Soto asked
that such training be included in the proposed Green Team procedures.
Mr. Schwien indicated staff's agreement to make that modification.
At <BR>
Ms. Soto's suggestion, staff also agreed to provide the permit
applicants with forms for evaluating the green carpet program.
<BR>

<P>
Bill Quinn of the California Council for Environmental and Economic
Balance, which worked with staff on developing details of the
pilot study, expressed their support for the proposed program
and urged the Board to approve staff's proposal.<BR>

<P>
ON MOTION OF MS. HAGGARD, SECONDED BY MS. LEE, A UNANIMOUS VOTE
WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Antonovich, Braude
and Burke) APPROVING THE PROPOSAL AND DIRECTING THE EXECUTIVE

34. Further Discussion on Proposed Regulatory Reform Initiatives
<BR>

<P>
Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, outlined the
actions staff will be taking for implementation of the four regulatory
reform initiatives proposed by Mr. Braude at the February 9, 1996
Board meeting: Develop Comprehensive Portable Engine Policy, Streamline
Certification and Transfer of Emission Reduction Credits, Eliminate
Duplicative Local, State and Federal Regulations, and Address
Suggestions for Improving RECLAIM Recordkeeping.<BR>

<P>
Noting the complexity of the issues involved, Mr. Braude commended
staff and expressed his appreciation to staff for moving forward
quickly with developing a concrete proposal to implement the proposed
reforms.<BR>

<P>
35. Analysis of AQMD Treasury Management Options<BR>

<P>
Rick Pearce, Director of Finance, reported on two treasury management
options available to the AQMD, including the costs and benefits
of implementing each option. Option I proposed maintaining the
Los Angeles County Treasurer as AQMD's Treasurer, but placing
approximately 85 percent of AQMD's investments into separate accounts
[the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF), which is managed by
the California State Treasurer, and Los Angeles County's Special
Purpose Investments (SPIs)] outside of the County's Pooled Surplus
Investment Portfolio (&quot;the PSIP&quot;). Option II proposed
appointment of a new internal Treasurer, establishment of an Investment
Oversight Committee, selection of a Financial Advisor, development
of an AQMD Investment Policy and Guidelines, selection of new
Banking and Custodial services, and selection of an Independent
Investment Management Firm.<BR>

<P>
Ms. Haggard, Mr. Hewitt and Mr. Silva expressed their support
for Option II, in light of Orange County's bankruptcy and speculation
of budgetary problems for Los Angeles County, and considering
the letter from outside counsel advising AQMD of the risks associated
with commingling of AQMD funds with County funds, should the County
file for bankruptcy. They each acknowledged that the situations
with Los Angeles County and Orange County are entirely different
and that the Los Angeles County fund is well-managed, but the
risk is still there; and it is the Board's responsibility to ensure
that as safe a basis as possible is provided for investment of
AQMD funds. Mr. Silva suggested that the oversight committee be
appointed by the Board and independent of staff, and that the
committee provide quarterly reports to the Board and conduct study
sessions as needed.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Antonovich and Mr. Paulitz expressed support for Option I.
Mr. Antonovich commented that any budget problems experienced
by Los Angeles County would not impact the County's investment
portfolio, and he believed it would be prudent for AQMD to stay
with <BR>
Los Angeles County where there would be experience and a cost
savings of nearly $200,000 compared to Option II. Mr. Paulitz
pointed out that Option I would take 85 percent of AQMD's fund
out of the PSIP--where the commingling occurs. He believed the
Board could preserve the better parts of both options, if an oversight
committee could be established under Option I.<BR>

<P>
In response to questions by Ms. Lee, Mr. Pearce clarified that
both treasury management options are similar in the amount of
money that would remain in the PSIP ($10 million to <BR>
$15 million) and in LAIF ($20 million). The difference is, under
Option I approximately $40 million would be moved outside of the
pool (PSIP) into a special program investment fund where the County
would make special purchases for AQMD, which would be placed in
a custodian bank. Under Option II, AQMD would take responsibility
for investing that same $40 million, through an investment management
firm, and would set up a custodian bank of its own, holding those
securities separately in AQMD's name.<BR>

<P>
With respect to establishing an oversight committee under Option
I, Mr. Pearce commented that the committee could provide guidance
to Los Angeles County with respect to the bulk of the funds--80
to 85 percent--that the County would be investing separately,
outside of the County pool. He noted the possibility of increased
costs, should the Board decide to modify Option I, in developing
a policy and investment guidelines as part of the oversight of
the committee. Ms. Lee suggested that the oversight committee
concept be incorporated under Option I.<BR>

<P>
Dr. Lents indicated that staff is neutral on this issue. Any bias
towards Option I that might exist is driven basically by the fact
that staff does not have the experience or training to handle
the investing. Therefore, whether the Board chooses Board members
or others for the Investment Oversight Committee, he did not think
it would be appropriate to include AQMD staff on the Committee.
<BR>

<P>
MR. ANTONOVICH MOVED TO DIRECT STAFF TO: <BR>

<P>

to include outside financial advisors in addition to Board members,
back to the Board at its May 10, 1996 meeting.<BR>

<U><B>PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD</B></U><B> - (Public Comment on Non-Agenda
Items, Pursuant to Government Code Section 54954.3)<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mr. Egon Monostory of Mono-Tech Tool &amp; Engineering Company
addressed the Board to express his concern regarding a neighboring
business, RC Finishing. <BR>
Mr. Monostory indicated that he has been bothered for a number
of years by coating fumes emanating from the RC Finishing facility.
In response to a recent nuisance complaint which he made to the
AQMD regarding the fumes, an AQMD Inspector visited the site;
but did not issue a Notice of Violation to RC Finishing for causing
a public nuisance, as Mr. Monostory believes should have been
done. Instead, the company was issued a Notice of Violation for
operating equipment without an AQMD permit.<BR>

<P>
Peter Mieras, District Prosecutor, responded that the AQMD Inspector
responding to Mr. Monostory's complaint was unable to detect the
odor, nor was the inspector able to locate anyone else in the
area other than Mr. and Mrs. Monostory who were affected by the
alleged odor. The inspector did, however, discover that RC Finishing
had allowed their AQMD permit for a spray booth being operated
at the facility to elapse, and therefore issued the Notice of
Violation referred to by Mr. Monostory in his comments.<BR>

<P>
Mr. Mieras informed Mr. Monostory that RC Finishing submitted
a permit application to the AQMD, which is presently being evaluated
by staff, and a determination will be made in the near future
as to whether or not a permit will be issued. He assured Mr. Monostory
that he will be notified personally of staff's determination.
If the AQMD decides to issue the permit, he explained, Mr. Monostory
would have ten days from the time he receives notification of
such to appeal the AQMD's decision before the Hearing Board pursuant
to Section 42302.1 of the California Health and Safety Code. He
suggested that Mr. Monostory contact the Clerk of the Board for
the necessary forms and instructions, should he decide to appeal
AQMD's issuance of the permit to RC Finishing.<BR>

</B>AQMD is a cosponsor of &quot;Project Clean Air&quot;, a joint
project of the Coalition for Clean Air with Norco High School.
Project Clean Air provided to students a basic course on air pollution
and its damaging effect on health. Students became active on air
pollution issues as well as solutions to cleaning our air, and
encouraged their community to do the same. Students distributed
CUT SMOG brochures to other students, their families and the community.
A Clean Air Rally will take place which will include AQMD, American
Lung Association, Clean Air Now, the Riverside County Transportation
Commission and others.<BR>

Proposed Rule 1136 amendments will establish interim VOC limits,
achieving a 45% VOC emission reduction compared to current limits.
Choices are provided for facilities to use waterborne topcoats
or topcoats and sealers formulated with exempt compounds such
as acetone. The final limits are proposed to be delayed until
2005 to allow time for low-VOC coating technology improvement
and for wood coaters to adjust to low-VOC coatings. Amendments
also include compliance flexibility. The rule was last reviewed
by the Stationary Source Committee on April 19, 1996.<BR>

<U><B>PUBLIC HEARINGS</B></U>
<P>
<LI VALUE=38>Amend Rule 1303 - Requirements (New Source Review) and Rule
2005 - New Source Review for RECLAIM
<P>

 Dr. Anupom Ganguli, Senior Manager/Stationary Source Compliance,
presented the staff report.  At the April 12, 1996 Board meeting,
the Board continued the public hearing on Proposed Amended Rules
1303 and 2005 to the May 10, 1996 Board meeting so that staff
could obtain EPA's approval on an alternate rule amendment proposal
which had been agreed upon by staff and industry representatives.
 The alternate proposal was reviewed by EPA, and the revisions
requested by EPA were not acceptable to all parties involved.
 Therefore, staff  went back to the original proposal, and modified
that proposal to provide relief and other requirements which will
address the technical considerations requested by industry.  Copies
of the consensus proposal which staff recommended the Board adopt
were not yet printed, but were expected to be distributed to Board
members and made available to the public during the public hearing.
<P>
(Ms. Soto arrived at 10:05 a.m., during the staff presentation.)
<P>
 The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony
from the following individuals:
<P>
<U>DEE ALLEN, City of Los Angeles</U>
<P>
1) Expressed support for the proposed amendments.  2) Because
consensus was reached subsequent to release of the staff report
and the staff report is often used to interpret the rule, recommended
that the staff report be modified to incorporate the language
changes set forth in the written submittal by the City of Los
Angeles.
<P>
FRANK CAPONI, Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts
<P>
MARTIN LEDWITZ, Southern California Edison
<P>
SHARON RUBALCAVA, Attorney, on behalf of Mine Reclamation Corporation
and <BR>
Browning Ferris Industries
<P>
LEE WALLACE, Southern California Gas Company
<P>
RON WILKNISS, Western States Petroleum Association
<P>
<U>GENE BECK, Environmental Resource Institute      </U>
<P>
 Expressed support for the proposed amendments, and encouraged
the Board to accept the language recommended by the City of Los
Angeles for inclusion in the staff report.
<P>
 Ms. Leyden indicated that staff was agreeable to incorporating
into the staff report the language recommended by the City of
Los Angeles.
<P>
 There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P>
 Ms. Soto indicated that she would abstain from voting on this
item since she was not present during all of the discussion. 
She also indicated that she had comments to make on Agenda Item
No. 29 (Legislative Committee) at the appropriate time.
<P>
 There being no further discussion on Agenda Item No. 38, Chairman
Mikels postponed Board action on that item until copies of the
PAR 1303 and PAR 2005 were distributed to Board members.
<P>
-o-
<P>
 Ms. Soto clarified for the record that she opposes AB 3248 (Napolitano),
but disagrees with the Legislative Committee report as to what
occurred at the Committee meeting with respect to AB 3248.
<P>
 Legislative Director Catherine Witherspoon responded that the
Committee report concerns the Committee's first discussion on
the bill; and it is not reflective of the Committee's current
stance, which is to work directly with Assemblywoman Napolitano
on alternative solutions to the measure.
<P>
-o-
<P>
<LI VALUE=39>Amend Rule 1902 - Transportation Conformity
<P>
 Connie Day, Program Supervisor/Planning, Transportation and Information
Management, presented the staff report.  The public hearing was
opened.  There being no requests to address the Board on this
item, the hearing was closed.

<P>
<LI>Amend Regulation III - Fees
<P>
 Edwin Pupka, Senior Manager/Stationary Source Compliance, presented
the staff report.  The public hearing was opened, and the Board
heard testimony from the following individuals:
<P>
<U>RON WILKNISS, Western States Petroleum Association</U>
<P>
 With respect to the breakdown emission report fee for RECLAIM
facilities, thanked AQMD staff for developing an approach that
is much more palatable than the one originally proposed.
<P>
<U>JOHN BILLHEIMER, Small Business Coalition</U>
<P>
1) Recommended that the compounds listed in Rule 301, Table IV
- Toxic Air Contaminants and Ozone Depleters, be listed in decreasing
rank by unit risk factor, instead of alphabetically for those
compounds first adopted and sequentially for subsequent additions
of compounds.
2) Recommended that the Board consider a logarithmic
rationalization of the Toxic Fee Schedule, increasing the $3 fee
for certain compounds to $4 and increasing the $4 fee for certain
compounds to $7; and suggested that the Board continue the public
hearing to a later date--with respect to the Toxic Fee Schedule
only--so that staff could work out the details.  (Submitted Written
Comments.)
<P>
 Ms. Leyden responded that staff was agreeable to reversing the
order of the compounds listed in the table from alphabetical to
rank ordering by unit risk factor, if the Board so desired.  Staff
proposed alphabetical order because those subject to the fees
will look in the table for their specific compound(s) by name,
which can be located easier if the compounds are in alphabetical
order.
<P>
 There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P>
 Mr. Silva and Ms. Soto expressed opposition to the proposed fee
increase because of the effects it would have on businesses, especially
small businesses, which are struggling to stay in business.  With
respect to SB 836 and other legislation attempting to remove funds
from AQMD, Ms. Soto commented that it would be prudent to wait
and see what happens, and then if necessary and there is no alternative,
staff could bring Regulation III back to the Board for amendment.
 Ms. Haggard expressed her concern that there was not clear, sufficient
justification in the staff report as to why the fee increase is
necessary.
<P>
 In response to a question by Dr. Wilson, Dr. Lents stated that
the proposed 1.2 percent increase in fees equates to approximately
$600,000.  Without the increase, staff would have to take $600,000
more out of reserves to fund the budget for the 1996-1997 fiscal
year.
<P>
 Mr. Paulitz, Ms. Lee, Dr. Wilson and Mr. Braude expressed support
for the proposed fee increase because they believe it would not
be prudent to use up the reserves at a faster rate than what was
recommended by staff, or to leave the fees at the current level,
in view of the threat of SB 836 and other legislation.  Mr. Paulitz
pointed out that AQMD has been collecting much less in fees than
legislation actually allows, and last year the Board gave a refund
to businesses.  Therefore, he did not think it would be asking
too much of the business community at this time for them to pay
a 1.2 percent increase.  Ms. Lee agreed, adding that had the increase
amount proposed been unreasonable, the auditorium would have been
filled with people who would have expressed to the Board their
opposition to the staff proposal; rather than only two people,
both of whom expressed support.
<P>
 Dr. Burke expressed concern that staff reported a decrease over
the last 12 months of approximately 1,000 permits from the 80,000
permits in AQMD's annual renewal data base, but was unable to
answer definitively as to the reason(s) for the decrease.  Mr.
Paulitz suggested a future report by staff to the Board as to
the reasons for the reduction in AQMD fee revenue.
<P>
 Chairman Mikels commented that the proposed fee increase, divided
among 80,000 permits, amounts to only $7.50 per permit--which
is why there was no opposition expressed by those subject to the
fees.

MS. LEE MOVED THAT THE BOARD REMOVE FROM RESERVES AND DESIGNATIONS
ALL AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FY 1995-96 BUDGET;  APPROVE TOTAL
APPROPRIATIONS OF $95,792,304 AND TOTAL RESERVES AND DESIGNATIONS
OF $32,247,755;  AND RECOGNIZE ESTIMATED REVENUES OF $92,895,200,
AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 Commenting in support of the motion, Mr. Paulitz and Mr. Braude
expressed their belief that downsizing staff by not filling positions
vacated through normal attrition was not only a more prudent policy
than laying employees off, but it is compassionate and makes for
better relations with employees by giving them the opportunity
to make the decisions and have a transitional period.  Mr. Mikels
added that he believes the budget proposed reflects a sincere
and sustained effort at downsizing the organization in a manner
unparalleled in his experience in government within Southern California.

12, 1996 Board meeting, when Mr. Monostory first brought this
matter to the Board's attention, staff made another inspection
of the RC Finishing facility and continues to find that the company
is operating in compliance with all AQMD requirements.  The permit
application is still being processed by staff, and at this point,
staff is waiting for additional information from the manufacturers
of the paints used at the facility so that the Material Safety
Data Sheets can be analyzed.
<P>
 Chairman Mikels asked that in the event Mr. Monostory decides
to petition the Board to hold a public hearing on this matter,
that staff provide the Board a briefing on the process the Board
would undertake in response to the petition.

<P>This joint project of the Coalition for Clean Air and Norco High School,
co-sponsored by AQMD, provided students a basic course on air pollution and
its damaging effects on health. Students became active on air quality issues
and solutions to pollution problems, and encouraged residents of their community
to do the same. Students distributed CUT SMOG brochures to other students,
their families and the community. In addition, as a part of this project,
a Clean Air Rally will occur and will include AQMD, American Lung Association,
Clean Air Now, the Riverside County Transportation Commission, and others.

<P>Proposed Rule 1136 amendments will establish interim VOC limits, achieving
a 45% VOC emission reduction compared to current limits. Choices are provided
for facilities to use waterborne topcoats or topcoats and sealers formulated
with exempt compounds such as acetone. The final limits are proposed to be
delayed until 2005 to allow time for low-VOC coating technology improvement
and for wood coaters to adjust to low-VOC coatings. Amendments also include
compliance flexibility. The rule was reviewed by the Stationary Source Committee
on April 19, 1996.

AGENDA ITEMS 6 THROUGH 9, 11 THROUGH 13, AND 15 THROUGH 17 AS
RECOMMENDED BY STAFF, BY THE FOLLOWING VOTE:<BR>

<P>
AYES:  Braude, Haggard, Lee, Loveridge, Mikels, Paulitz, Silva,
Soto and Wilson.<BR>

<P>
NOES:  None.<BR>

<P>
ABSTAIN: Soto (on Agenda Item #6 only).<BR>

<P>
ABSENT: Antonovich and Burke.<BR>

<P>
18. Items Deferred from Consent Calendar<BR>

<P>
2. Set Public Hearing July 12, 1996 to Amend Rule 430 - Breakdown
Provisions<BR>

<P>
 Ms. Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, reported
that the proposed amendments include consideration of having the
Hearing Board on standby on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays in
the event of equipment breakdowns necessitating variance relief.
 Staff has reconsidered that proposal, and intends to withdraw
it from the proposed amendments which will be considered by the
Board at the July 12 public hearing on this item.<BR>

<P>
 3. Set Public Hearing July 12, 1996 to Amend
<P>
Rule 2002 - Allocations for NOx and SOx;<BR>
Rule 2004 - Requirements;<BR>
Rule 2005 - New Source Review for RECLAIM;<BR>
Rule 2011 - Requirements for Monitoring, Reporting, and<BR>
                    Recordkeeping for SOx Emissions;<BR>
Rule 2012 - Requirements for Monitoring, Reporting, and<BR>
                    Recordkeeping for NOx Emissions; and<BR>
Rule 2015 - Backstop Provisions<BR>

<P>
 Attorney Curtis Coleman addressed the Board on behalf of California
Portland Cement Company (CPCC) to express support of the staff
recommendations on this item; but to also express concern that
while CPCC is optimistic that it will be able to make modifications
to its cement kilns to reduce NOx emissions and still stay under
its RTC allocations cap, there is the possibility that CPCC may
exceed its allocation for the year because of circumstances beyond
its control.  In that event, CPCC may have to come back to the
Governing Board, since the Hearing Board is not authorized to
grant any relief from the RTC emissions allocation cap.<BR>

<P>
 4. Execute Contracts for Air Quality Investment Program<BR>

<P>
 Chairman Mikels indicated that this item was not pulled for discussion,
but for continuance of the item to the July 12, 1996 Board meeting.
<BR>

<P>
 5. Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Development of a Prototype
Economical Advanced Electric Vehicle and a Plan for California
Production<BR>

<P>
 The following individuals addressed the Board to speak in opposition
to the staff recommendation on this item:<BR>

<P>
JIM CAMP, Consultant to State Assembly Utilities and Commerce
Committee
<P>
   (Read into the record a statement by Assemblyman Conroy)
<P>
*ANITA MANGELS, Californians Against Hidden Taxes
<P>
BILL WARD, Committees of Correspondence
<P>
DR. KENNETH GREEN, Reason Foundation
<P>
<U>WAYNE KING, Orange County resident      </U>
<P>
*Submitted Written Comments<BR>

<P>
 The key points/issues raised by the above individuals are summarized
as follows:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>A statewide mandate already exists which provides for the
development of EVs by the world's seven largest automobile makers,
which are fully capable of funding the project without taxpayer
assistance.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC), with
an original four-year budget of $262 million has been working
on an EV battery design for years, with limited success.  It is
unreasonable to assume that the recommended contract, valued at
approximately $2 million, can solve a problem which has stymied
the USABC for so long.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The Board should reject the proposed contract, and instead
apply the $500,000 to viable--not speculative and duplicative--air
quality solutions.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The ARB has acknowledged that the mandated introduction of
over a million electric vehicles over the entire life of the mandate
would result in only one percent of the smog reduction required
under the SIP.  To expend such a vast amount of time and resources
for the return that is associated with EV usage is counterproductive.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The proposed sole-source contract was negotiated without the
benefit of the public competitive bidding process required of
most government contracts in California.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Contracting with an out-of-state firm for production of the
EV conflicts with all of the &quot;jobs for California&quot; language
that has been used for the last five years to legitimize the EV
mandate.  The contract should require that 75 to 80 percent of
the funds be spent in California.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
 The following individuals commented in support of the staff recommendation:
<BR>

<P>
<U>JOHN COX, Southern California Economic Partnership (SCEP)<BR>
</U>
<P>
 1) Pointed out that government investment in the business economy
has gone on for many years in all industries, and the electric
vehicle is no exception.  2) Expressed concern that while EVs
and EV batteries are being built worldwide, not enough of them
are being manufactured in the state of California.  3) Encouraged
Board approval of this item because SCEP views the proposed contract
as one that can fulfill the &quot;Project California&quot; goal
of creating jobs for California.<BR>

<P>
<U>BOB CROSS, California Air Resources Board<BR>
</U>
<P>
 1) Emphasized that the goal of the project is primarily one of
jobs and commerce for California, with recognition of the world
market potential, as opposed to environmental.  The proposed contract
with Troy Design and Manufacturing (TDM), a company which has
a long history of building low volume production runs for the
big three automobile makers, has a reasonable chance of starting
a world car production facility in California; and ARB's view
is that it is a good investment.  Also, the ARB contract includes
a $100-per-car royalty for the first 20,000 cars if the EV is
produced anywhere other than California.  2) Clarified that funding
for the project would be provided as follows:  TDM -- $600,000;
ARB -- $500,000; AQMD -- $500,000; and $800,000 provided by the
Advanced Research Projects Agency, for a total of $2.4 million.
<BR>

<P>
(Mr. Antonovich arrived at 10:00 a.m., during public comment)
<BR>

<P>
<U>Written Comments Submitted by:</U>
<P>
Assemblyman Bill Morrow
<P>
Assemblyman Bob Margett
<P>
Senator Ross Johnson
<P>
California Business Alliance<BR>

<P>
 Mr. Braude expressed concern that the proposed contract implies
that there is further development necessary for EV technology.
 There is no question that an EV can be built right now and be
sold for less than the mass-produced gasoline-driven vehicles.
<BR>

<P>
 Mr. Paulitz commented that funding provided by AQMD for the proposed
project is not taxpayers' money, but is money generated from air
pollution fees for a special fund to advance technology to clean
up the air in this basin.  Therefore, this item would be an appropriate
use of those funds.  In response to the comment that AQMD is subsidizing
the EV industry, he pointed out that the oil industry has been
subsidized for many years.  Expressing his belief that technology
will eventually solve California's pollution problem, not changing
people's driving habits, he added that the real demand for EVs
is going to originate in California.<BR>

<P>
 Indicating his agreement with Mr. Paulitz's comments, Dr. Wilson
commented that the basic issue with this item--and why he supports
it--is that it is attempting to put together a production model
EV that can be used to create jobs and add a new dimension to
the California economy as we service the outer rim countries with
EVs.<BR>

<P>
 Mr. Antonovich expressed his belief that the $500,000 the Board
is being asked to appropriate would be better spent in cleaning
the air by removing the polluting vehicles from the highways,
and also subsidizing clean fuel programs for public transit systems.
<BR>

<P>
 Chairman Mikels suggested the Board continue this item to the
July 12, 1996 Board meeting, and request a letter of explanation
and support from Cal-EPA to address the issues and concerns raised.
<BR>

<P>
 Mr. Braude added that he has been a consistent supporter of using
public funds to push the state of the art; but questions whether
the proposed project would make the best use of the funds available.
 He would like to see a list of alternatives, for example, for
investing the funds.<BR>

<P>
DR. WILSON MOVED TO CONTINUE AGENDA ITEM NO. 5 TO THE JULY 12,
1996 BOARD MEETING, AND TO REQUEST FROM CAL-EPA AND THE ARB A
LETTER OF EXPLANATION AND SUPPORT ON THE ITEM, ADDRESSING THE
ISSUES AND CONCERNS RAISED BY THE PUBLIC AND BOARD MEMBERS.  THE
MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ, AND PASSED BY A UNANIMOUS
VOTE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent:  Burke).<BR>

<P>
10. Issue a Request for Proposals to Audit AB 2766 Fee Revenue
Recipients for Fiscal Years <BR>
1993-94 and 1994-95<BR>

<P>
 Ms. Soto suggested that the board letter--which highlights the
outreach that will be conducted in an effort to get responses
from MBE/WBE/DVBE firms--be attached to the RFP, since copies
of RFPs are now submitted to the Ethnic Community Advisory Council
and the Latino and Black Legislative Caucus, among others.  Dr.
Lents indicated staff's agreement.<BR>

<P>
14. Rule Forecast<BR>

<P>
 At Ms. Soto's request, staff agreed to contact as many of the
restaurants as possible that will be affected by Proposed Rule
1138 (scheduled for public hearing in October 1996) through individual
restaurant management contacts, in addition to contacting the
restaurant trade associations.<BR>

<P>
ON MOTION OF MS. LEE, SECONDED BY MS. SOTO, A UNANIMOUS VOTE WAS
CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent:  Burke) APPROVING AGENDA

APPOINTMENT OF BOARD MEMBER LEONARD PAULITZ TO SCAG'S SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA RIDESHARE BOARD, AS RECOMMENDED.<BR>

<P>
20. Legislative Committee<BR>

<P>
 Legislative Director Catherine Witherspoon reported that the
Legislative Committee, at its meeting on May 24, 1996, continued
a bill to the June 14 Board meeting for discussion--AB 2635 (Morrisey),
concerning portable engines.  At the time of the Committee meeting,
staff expressed concerns about the bill, and  was recommending
an &quot;oppose unless amended&quot; position.  Staff subsequently
met with the sponsor of the bill, Construction Industry Air Quality
Coalition, and was able to reach a compromise on amendments to
the bill which would resolve staff's concerns.  The ARB is continuing
to refine both the legislation and their draft regulations implementing
last year's bill--AB 531 (Morrisey).  Staff will continue to work
with both the sponsor and the ARB on bringing the two together.
 Staff distributed copies of the compromise amendments to Board
members and recommended the Board take a position of &quot;support
with compromise amendments&quot; on AB 2635.<BR>

<P>
 Mr. Paulitz noted the following correction to page three of the
committee report:<BR>

THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. LOVERIDGE, AND PASSED BY THE FOLLOWING
VOTE:<BR>

<P>
AYES:  Antonovich, Braude, Haggard, Lee, Loveridge, Mikels, Paulitz,
Silva (except AB 2937 and AB 3159), Soto and Wilson.<BR>

<P>
NOES:  Silva (AB 2937 and AB 3159 only).<BR>

<P>
ABSENT: Burke.<BR>

<P>
 Ms. Witherspoon added that AQMD legal staff has been working
on the possibility of defining minor violations in the air quality
context in such a way that it does not bind the entire prosecutorial
arm of the agency, and may be able to find a compromise for AB
2937 and AB 3159 before the legislative session is over.<BR>

<P>
25(A) Establish Office of Public Affairs &amp; Local Government
Assistance and the Position of Deputy Executive Officer to Administer
its Responsibilities; Create the Local Government and Small Business
Assistance Committee; and Institute an Annual General Assembly
<BR>

<P>
 Chairman Mikels reported that this proposal relates to AB 3248
(Napolitano) -- Public Affairs Reorganization, which the Board
is on record as opposing.  He, Ms. Soto, and Dr. Burke met with
Assemblywoman Napolitano, Senator Polanco and Senator Archie Hudson
by telephone and agreed that the Board would draft an administrative
alternative to AB 3248, incorporating the important elements of
concern to Assemblywoman Napolitano.  Chairman Mikels and Ms.
Soto will meet with Assemblywoman Napolitano on June 18, 1996
to resolve any outstanding issues and conclude discussions, which
is expected to result in withdrawal of AB 3248 by the assemblywoman.
 Chairman Mikels recommended, therefore, that the Board approve
this item provisionally, upon the withdrawal of AB 3248, such
that it would not be implemented if the bill moves forward.<BR>

<P>
 In response to questions by Ms. Soto and Mr. Antonovich regarding
implementation of the proposal upon withdrawal of AB 3248, Dr.
Lents explained that the intention is to reconfigure existing
staff so that it would not involve any additional expenses, but
only a reorganization of duties and responsibilities.<BR>

<P>
 In response to questions by Mr. Braude, Ms. Witherspoon stated
that AB 3248 is scheduled for hearing in the Senate Local Government
Committee on June 26, 1996.  The bill has drawn substantial opposition
since the time it left the Assembly, and Assemblywoman Napolitano
is developing amendments to the bill in response to the opposition
that has been voiced to her directly from the Alternative Energy
lobby, Electric Vehicle supporters, and environmental groups.
 Major industry groups in the South Coast basin are concerned
about the micromanagement and the loss of fee revenue to AQMD
which might result in fee increases upon them, but they have not
stepped forward in opposition to the bill.  Instead, they have
declined to support the bill.<BR>

<P>
 Chairman Mikels added that if he and Ms. Soto are unable to conclude
discussions with Assemblywoman Napolitano on June 18 such that
AB 3248 is withdrawn, AQMD will prepare to present its case in
opposition to the amended bill at the June 26 hearing.<BR>

<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. LOVERIDGE, SECONDED BY MS. LEE, A UNANIMOUS VOTE
WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent:  Antonovich and
Burke), APPROVING AGENDA ITEM NO. 25(A) AS RECOMMENDED, PROVISIONAL
UPON THE WITHDRAWAL OF AB 3248 BY ASSEMBLYWOMAN NAPOLITANO.<BR>

<U><B>PUBLIC HEARINGS<BR>

<P>
26. Amend Rule 1136 - Wood Products Coatings<BR>

<P>
 Jack Broadbent, Assistant DEO/Stationary Source Compliance, presented
the staff report.  Board members were provided copies of an Errata
containing replacement pages for 1136-15, 1136-16, SR-27, and
APP G. 2 of PAR 1136 to correct an enumeration error.  In addition,
the Board was provided with revised language for Subparagraph
(c)(1)(A)(i), to delay the implementation of interim VOC limits
from April 1, 1997 to July 1, 1997, and for Paragraph (b)(34)
and Subparagraph (c)(1)(D)(i), to address comments by USEPA.<BR>

<P>
 The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony
from the following individuals.<BR>

<P>
<U>DANIEL MEER, U.S. EPA, Region 9<BR>
</U>
<P>
 Emphasized the following two issues raised in the letter submitted
to the Board from EPA's Air &amp; Toxics Division Director David
Howekamp:  <U><B>Averaging</B></U><B>.</B>  EPA's policy is that
the averaging provision in Rule 1136 (c)(1)(D)(i) must include
a 10 percent benefit share for the environment, because averaging
mechanisms and other economic incentive programs have the ability
to greatly reduce costs to regulated industry, and EPA believes
that some of those savings should be used to achieve further emission
reductions.  <U><B>Planning.</B></U>  Because PAR 1136 may achieve
VOC reductions at a slower rate than the version of Rule 1136
adopted by the Board in September 1995, any shortfall should be
accounted for in AQMD's SIP submittal.<BR>

<P>
<U>LARRY COZZO, Graco Inc.<BR>
</U>
<P>
 Requested that Paragraph (k)(8) of PAR 1136 be amended to allow
the use of air-assisted airless spray equipment provided the coatings
contain 550 grams, or less, of VOC per liter, and that any spray
equipment be allowed where the coatings used have a lower VOC
content according to the July 1, 2005 VOC limits.<BR>

<P>
 In anticipation of Mr. Cozzo's request, staff prepared revisions
to PAR 1136 to define &quot;conventional air spray&quot; and to
allow the use of any spray equipment, except conventional air
spray, that uses only coatings that contain 550 grams, or less,
of VOC per liter of coating, less water and less exempt compounds.
 Copies of the revised rule language were distributed to Board
members and made available to the public.<BR>

<p>Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options was adopted on
December 8, 1995. As one compliance strategy, Rule 2202 allows employers
to invest in the AQIP. Monies received are placed in a restricted account
to fund programs that result in equivalent emission reductions than would
otherwise have been achieved by the participating employers. Staff evaluated
the proposals received during the first quarter of 1996 and recommends
several for funding. The amount available for this quarter is $2,987,004.
This was presented to the Mobile Source Committee on May 17, 1996. </p>

<p>On March 8, 1996, the Board approved in concept the staff recommendations
to execute contracts for the AQIP. At that time, staff was directed to
return to the Board for final approval. Staff recommends that the Board
approve the release of AQIP funds for the final quarter funding of 1995.
This was reviewed by the Mobile Source Committee on April 26, 1996, and
recommended for approval. </p>

<p>ARB has identified several impediments to development and production
of EVs by major vehicle manufacturers, including low-volume production,
uncertain market and undeveloped electric drivetrain and battery technologies.
The proposed contract with ARB will produce an EV design and analysis of
the processes\costs of developing and manufacturing low production volumes
of advanced EVs in California. AQMD contribution to this $2.4 million program
will not exceed $500,000. This was reviewed by the Technology Committee
on April 10, 1996 and referred to the Administrative Committee for further
review. This was reviewed by the Administrative Committee on April 19 and
May 24, 1996, and recommended for approval. </p>

<br></a>Liu (909) 396-2105 </p>

<p>Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) staff
is considering converting its methanol bus fleet to operate on other fuels.
To evaluate all options for the methanol buses, LACMTA plans to evaluate
retrofitting the buses to operate on compressed natural gas (CNG) or other
fuels. LACMTA has requested financial assistance to support the conversion
of one methanol bus to CNG to determine the feasibility of this approach.
AQMD`s cost-share will not exceed $75,000. Total project cost is approximately
$192,800. This was reviewed by the Technology Committee on June 12, 1996
and recommended for approval. </p>

<p>EPA has allocated Section 105 and supplemental grant funds to AQMD for
three projects. This action is to recognize and appropriate these funds
to the FY 1996-97 Budget as follows: (1) $1,216,620 for the fourth year
Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations program implementation, (2)
$75,000 for the equipment replacement program of the existing NOx analyzers;
and (3) $25,000 for the PM2.5 project. This was reviewed by the Administrative

<p>In FY 1995-96, AQMD assumed operation of four ARB monitoring sites and
added monitoring equipment to four existing sites as part of the Childrens
Health Study. For that first year, ARB provided $150,000 to fund the operation
of the stations. For the second year, ARB will again provide $150,000 to
continue the operation of the air monitoring stations. This action is to
recognize the $150,000 from ARB and appropriate these funds to the FY 1996-97
Budget. This was reviewed by the Administrative Committee on June 21, 1996
and recommended for approval. </p>

<p>AQMD is seeking to pre-qualify vendors providing various library services
and supplies. Vendors selected will be issued blanket purchase orders for
the acquisition, cataloging, and shelf preparation of books, periodicals,
and other printed and multi-media materials in the AQMDs library. The
use of blanket purchase orders facilitates acquisition of books, articles
and reports, and reduces the labor required to type and process prepaid
purchase orders. This bidding and pre-qualification process will ensure
that AQMD is using the most cost-effective providers for these services
and supplies. This was reviewed by the Administrative Committee on June
21, 1996, and recommended for approval. </p>

<p>Through a competitive bid process, AQMD is seeking to pre-qualify vendors
capable of providing various services and supplies to maintain the personal
computer (PC) infrastructure. Vendors selected will be the sources for
hard disk, printer, modem and other telecommunication subsystem repairs.
They also will be the suppliers for routine PC, wide area network, and
local area network repair and installation of parts. The bidding and pre-qualification
process will ensure that the AQMD is using the most cost-effective providers
for these services and supplies. This was reviewed by the Administrative

<p>Administrative Policy and Procedure No. 35 requires the establishment,
through Board approval, of a list of pre-qualified vendors for purchase
of non-consultant services and supplies. These RFQs will be used to establish
lists of pre-qualified vendors from which service and supplies will be
purchased. From these lists, competitive bids will be solicited for recycled
copy paper, printing services, miscellaneous printing paper stock, unleaded
fuel, and automotive mechanical repair and service as needed for a twelve-month
period. This was reviewed by the Administrative Committee on June 21, 1996,

<P> Chairman Mikels.  Announced the formation of an Ad Hoc Committee composed of himself, Vice Chairman Dr. Burke, Ms. Lee and Ms. Soto to consider implementation of the administrative changes adopted by the Board at its June 14, 1996 meeting in order to address concerns which prompted AB 3248 (Napolitano) -- Public Affairs Reorganization.  The Board&#146;s action at that time was provisional, to be implemented only upon the withdrawal of AB 3248 by Assemblywoman Napolitano.  Although the bill was not withdrawn, Chairman Mikels believes there is merit in implementing some of the changes proposed.

<P>21(A) Items Deferred from Consent Calendar
<P>7. Cost-Share the Development of a Prototype Economical Advanced Electric 
<BR>Vehicle and a Plan for California Production
 <I>(Continued from the June 14, Board Meeting) </I> 
<P> The following individuals commented in support of the staff recommendation on this item:
<P>TOM CACKETTE, Air Resources Board
 <P> Referred to two documents submitted to the Governing Board in response to it's request at the June 14, 1996 meeting for further information from ARB and Cal-EPA on this proposal:  (i) a letter dated July 10, 1996 from James Strock, Cal-EPA Secretary for Environmental Protection, requesting the Board's support of the proposed project and pointing out that the project will help maintain California's leadership role in advanced transportation technologies;  and (ii) a letter dated July 10, 1996 from ARB Chairman John Dunlap addressing four questions raised by the Governing Board at its June 14 meeting regarding the necessity for the proposed project in light of Toyota's prototype EV and the existing commitment by the major automobile manufacturers to produce low volumes of EVs, justification for the proposal not being competitively bid, and justification for engaging a company located in Michigan to perform the project. 
<P>JOHN STEARNS, Project California 
<P> Urged the Board to support the proposal from Troy Design and Manufacturing (TDM) because of TDM's qualifications (extensive automotive design and manufacturing experience and an existing customer base of mainstream automobile companies in both the U.S. and abroad), the product (not simply another prototype; but the proposal includes a complete manufacturing and production plan, which will give public authorities, for the first time, a concrete measure by which to judge estimates of vehicle price and manufacture ability) and the benefit to California (TDM is committed to a California manufacturing facility, and is already involving California companies Automotive Components Plastics Technologies of Huntington Beach is supplying composite technology, AeroVironment of Monrovia is supplying battery management technology and Northrop Grumman is providing the drivetrains for prototype vehicles).  
<BR>(Submitted Written Comments)
<P>JOHN SLIFKO, Congressman Howard Berman
<P> Read into the record a letter submitted to the Board from Congressmen Howard Berman, 
<BR>Anthony Beilenson, Julian Dixon and Henry Waxman expressing their support for the proposed project, which they believe will help American industry capture emerging global transportation markets and help advance the state-of-the-art for technologies such as fuel cells and advanced composite materials, as well as provide substantive technical support for ARB&'s ZEV Rule and valuable data in support of the AQMP.
<P> The following individuals addressed the Board to speak in opposition to the staff recommendation:
<P>*ANITA MANGELS, Californians Against Hidden Taxes
<br>LES BERRIMAN, Drivers for Highway Safety
<br>BILL WARD, Committees of Correspondence
<br>WAYNE KING, concerned citizen
<br>ANTHONY TRUJILLO, concerned citizen
<br>ROBERT AULT, Committees of Correspondence
<br>LUCI GRISMER, concerned citizen
<br>MARIE WHALING, concerned citizen
<br>DR. KENNETH GREEN, Reason Foundation  
<br>*Submitted Written Comments
<P> The key points/issues raised by the individuals listed above are summarized as follows:
<UL>
<LI><P>  The proposed project will provide no measurable emissions reductions, therefore AQMD should not be involved.</p>
<LI><P>  EVs meeting the specifications of the TDM proposal are already available; and the ARB has entered into contracts with the &quot;Big Seven&quot; automakers to develop EVs, making the TDM contract a duplication of effort.</p>
<LI><P> The TDM proposal was negotiated outside the competitive bidding process required of all state contracts.</p>
<LI><P>  The proposed contract will cause the export of almost $2 million in public funds to Michigan.  Funds earmarked for the TDM contract are derived from state-mandated registration fees on motor vehicles in the District, and members of the public would view this charge as a tax.</p>
<LI><P>  TDM World Conversions, a division of TDM, performed a number of AQMD-funded CNG vehicle conversions for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.  Minutes of the MSRC meeting cite various and unavoidable delays, coupled with safety defects found in the majority of TDM vehicles.  TDM abruptly closed its facility in April 1995 without fulfilling its contractual obligations.</p>
<LI><P> This program and others like it will actually delay the development of practical EVs by interfering with free market funding mechanisms.</p> 
</UL>


<P>JOHN LONGVILLE, MSRC
<P> In response to comments by Ms. Mangels with respect to hidden costs/taxes, pointed out that the costs we pay when we drive petroleum-powered vehicles are hidden in more than just tax dollars, but also in the health effects that petroleum generates for all of us in Southern California and throughout the nation.
<P>(Mr. Braude arrived at 10:25 a.m., during public comment.)

<P> Mr. Silva commented that, as a member of ARB, he supported the extension of the EV mandate.  It his belief that the EV has a future, but in order for the EV to be successful--not only in California but throughout the United States--it will have to be market-driven.  The proposed project will bring jobs to the South Coast basin and will provide information on design, development and production costs.  The auto industry does not share this information, and rightfully so.  This information will be valuable in planning future projects and will help AQMD in keeping its commitment to improve air quality in the basin.

<P> Pang Mueller, Senior Enforcement Manager, presented the staff report.  
<BR>Cindy Greenwald, Planning Manager, reported briefly on the socioeconomic assessment performed for the proposed amendments.
<P> In response to concern expressed by Mr. Braude, Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, assured Mr. Braude that the proposed amendments are all essentially fine tuning issues and do not diminish in any way AQMD's ability to properly monitor industry compliance and to impose additional monitoring or regulatory provisions than currently exist in order to achieve the fundamental goals of RECLAIM.
<P> The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from the following individuals:
<P>LEE WALLACE, Southern California Gas Company
<br>STAN HOLM, Mobil Oil Corporation  
<BLOCKQUOTE><P> Expressed support for the proposed amendments, and commented that industry has made substantial progress in negotiations with staff on a number of issues which would further clarify the RECLAIM requirements for CEMS and missing data procedures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>TED METROSE, Western Independent Refiners Association
<BLOCKQUOTE><P> Commented that one of the main problems with the missing data procedures is that there are no variances allowed from missing data procedures; and there should be variances allowed to address cases where missing data procedures result in a significant overstatement of emissions.  (Submitted Written Comments)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>JOHN BENNETT, California Portland Cement Company
<BLOCKQUOTE><P> Expressed support of the proposed amendments pertaining to gray cement kilns, and requested that the July 1, 1996 and February 1, 1998 compliance dates in Rule 2015, Subparagraph (c)(3)(D), be extended one month to adjust for the one month delay of the public hearing date.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Ms. Coy indicated staff's agreement to extension of the two dates from &quot;July 1, 1996&quot; and &quot;February 1, 1998&quot; to &quot;August 1, 1996&quot; and &quot;March 1, 1998&quot;, respectively.


<P> With respect to the inability to obtain a variance from the missing data procedures, 
<BR>Ms. Leyden explained that EPA has indicated that it would not approve the rule if it included a variance provision.  Most companies have their CEMS installed and operating, so this issue involves only a small subset of companies--most of which have purchased the equipment and with due diligence are trying to get their CEMS to operate.  Staff is working with industry to bring an amendment to the rule back to the Board before the end of 1996 that would allow a minor extension of time on the use of interim reporting in those cases where companies have purchased and installed the equipment and is simply trying to get the equipment to test and certify correctly.

<P><LI><U>Items Deferred from Consent Calendar</U>
<P><B><I>*Note:  In his request to address the Board, Mr. Billheimer incorrectly indicated Agenda Item </I></B>
<BR><B><I> No. 4, when his comments actually pertained to Agenda Item No. 3.</I></B>
<P><UL>3. Set Public Hearing December 13, 1996 to Amend Rule 1130.1 - Screen Printing Operations
<P> John Billheimer, Consultant, requested that the Board take note of the following items so that these items could possibly be considered by the Board at the December 13, 1996 public hearing on Rule 1130.1:  (i) interaction of ink and partially cured adhesives in lamination of skis;  (ii) emission control system alternate to formulation, providing equivalent reductions;  (iii) a conflict in the exemption from  a written permit (Rule 219) versus exemption from the VOC requirements of Rule 1130.1;  and (iv) linkage of conditions in the derivative permit to a variance.  (Submitted Written Comments.)
<P> 6. Amend Contract with Telos Consulting Services and Issue an RFP for Short- and 
<BR>Long-Term Systems Development and Maintenance Support
<P> 9. Issue an RFP to Implement the Design for New Permit Streamlining System
<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D., Executive Officer, requested that the following language be included in the two RFPs for Agenda Items No. 6 and No. 9:
<P><I><U>&quot;The preference points to be awarded in Step 2 of the evaluation process for </U></I><I><U>MBE/WBE firms contained in this RFP may not be awarded if it is determined </U></I><I><U>that the awarding of these points is in violation of Proposition 209.

<P> With respect to Agenda Item No. 9, Ms. Soto noted that not all of the standardized language regarding MBEs and WBEs was included in the Board letter for this item and, in view of the recent elections, she felt it should be included.
<P> 7. Provide Additional Funding for Technical Support of AQMD&#146;s Technology
<BR>Advancement Program <I>(Continued from October 11, 1996 Board Meeting)</I>
<P> Ms. Soto commented that she expressed concern regarding this item at the October 11, 1996 Board meeting because it seemed to her a waste of money and effort to pay someone to obtain documents and gather information which is already provided by the MTA to AQMD staff upon request.
<P>11. Rule Forecast
<P> At Mr. Braude&#146;s request, Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, briefly outlined the schedule of rules that the Board will consider in the next year and how those rules relate to the proposed 1997 Revision to the AQMP, which the Board would consider later during the meeting (Agenda Item No. 25).
<P><UL>ON MOTION OF DR. WILSON, SECONDED BY MS.

<P> The public hearing was opened.  There being no requests to address the Board on this item, the hearing was closed.
<P> In response to concern expressed by Mr. Paulitz, Ms. Wasikowski clarified that the Regional Transportation Agencies Coalition is in the process of hiring a consultant or a team of experts to define the baseline and develop the methodology for measuring the emissions reductions that will result from voluntary ridesharing. Chairman Mikels added that the methodology developed will not only count commuter ridesharing, but also any other creditable voluntary ridesharing.<UL>

<P>24. Amend Rule 1113 - Architectural Coatings <I>(Continued from October 11, 1996 Board Meeting</I><I>)</I>
<P><B>Note:  A verbatim transcript of the public hearing on Proposed Amended Rule 1113 has been </B><B>prepared and a copy is available for public review in the AQMD Library.  Following is a </B><B><I>summary</I></B><B> of </B><B>the proceedings and statement of the actions taken by the Board.</B>
<P> Jack Broadbent, Assistant DEO/Stationary Source Compliance, summarized staff&#146;s responses to issues raised during public testimony at the October 11, 1996 public hearing on this item; and highlighted three key issues which, in response to those issues, staff proposed the following modifications to PAR 1113:
<P><UL><LI> <I>Establish a small manufacturer&#146;s provision in the rule for those manufacturers with </I>
<BR><I>$2 million or less in gross annual sales and less than 100 employees.  These manufacturers will be </I><I>exempt from the final VOC limits for flats and will be given two additional years to meet the final </I><I>VOC limit for lacquers.  Also, inclusion of language in the adopting resolution that AQMD staff </I><I>will monitor employment impacts on small manufacturers of flat coatings and lacquers and include </I><I>a report on those impacts in the technology assessment reports to the Board.</I>
<P><LI> <I>The addition of a provision in the technology review section of PAR 1113 that AQMD staff will </I><I>incorporate the results of the ARB survey, which is expected to be initiated in 1997 and will take </I><I>approximately two years to complete, as part of the upcoming technology reviews.</I>
<P><LI> <I>The addition of language to the adopting resolution directing AQMD staff to work with ARB and </I><I>USEPA to expeditiously amend the SIP if the technology assessments result in the need to amend </I><I>the future VOC limits for lacquers or flats, and to work with the USEPA to establish an </I><I>administrative method of reporting in Title V permits, rules which have been amended but for </I><I>which amendments have not yet been approved in the SIP without a finding of non-compliance due </I><I>to following the amended rules.</I></UL>
<P> Mr. Broadbent brought attention to letters from both EPA and ARB, copies of which were distributed to Board members, expressing their support for PAR 1113 as modified by staff.
<P> The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from the following individuals:

<P>*Submitted Written Comments
<P> Industry representatives reiterated comments made at the October 11 public hearing, and additional issues were raised with respect to:
<P><UL><LI> <B>Whether or not the VOCs in waterborne flats are significantly volatile to contribute to ozone </B><B>pollution; or if PAR 1113 will actually reduce VOC emissions on a net basis</B>.  Proposed ARB amendments to the California regulation for consumer products, which includes aerosol spray paints, exempt any VOC that has a low vapor pressure (LVP).  LVP compounds are not expected to contribute significantly to ozone formation.  These compounds can, therefore, be omitted from calculations of VOC content.
<P><LI> <B>The inadequate staff analysis and response to the data that has been provided to staff, and the </B><B>numerous issues that have been identified</B>.  The environmental assessment states that there will be technology reviews and, if necessary, the rule can be amended.  However, there is no discussion as to what would happen in the event EPA does not agree to changing the rule.
<P><LI><B>The amendment proposed still does not meet the Superior Court&#146;s command from 1990 to </B><B>consider and adequately address the thinning issues with respect to lacquers</B>.  In 1990, in reaction to certain prior amendments to Rule 1113, the Superior Court invalidated those amendments and issued a Writ of Mandate which commanded the District to &quot;consider and adequately address the thinning issues relating to, among other coatings, lacquers in the manner required by CEQA&quot;.</UL>
<P> Mr. Wendoll requested that the Board adopt those proposed cleanup amendments that are without objection, defer action on the proposed amendments affecting lacquers and flat coatings, and resolve to initiate a coatings research program, co-funded and managed by AQMD and 
<BR>EL RAP, that would involve not only the AQMD and industry representatives, but also qualified independent scientific consultants and local resources such as the newly-established coatings laboratory at Cal Poly Pomona.  The research would focus on resolving major technical issues related to the impacts of VOC content limits on coatings performance and usage and consequent emissions, determining the optimal VOC content limits that would minimize emissions from architectural coatings consistent with technological and economic feasibility, and investigating alternative strategies for reducing the ozone formation potential of those emissions.

<P> Several speakers commented on the success their companies have had in using low-VOC coatings that are near or below the 100 gpl VOC limit proposed for 2001.  Ms. Ruderman Feuer expressed NRDC&#146;s support of PAR 1113, in concept, and its opposition to the effective dates for future VOC limits, which NRDC believes allows paint manufacturers too much time to institute use of paints which are currently available on the market.  Ms. Kinney and Ms. Rodriguez expressed their concern about anything in the environment that is harmful to children, and their support for the use of safe, non-toxic paints with low emissions.
<P> Mr. Billheimer remarked on the fact that unlike point sources that have permits, pay fees, and install control equipment or reformulate substances, architectural coatings are related to area sources and there are no means by which these sources pay any funds into the AQMD.  He suggested that the proposal by EL RAP for a research venture could possibly be the avenue.
<P><U>MICHAEL R. LEE, Los Angeles County Fire Department</U>
<P> Commented that all of the solvents that have been mentioned to be used with lacquers are Class I flammable liquids, with the same relative hazard level.

<P><UL>MS. LEE MOVED ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION NO. 96-22, AMENDING RULE 1113 AND CERTIFYING THE FINAL SUBSEQUENT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. SOTO.</UL>
<P> Mr. Antonovich expressed the following concerns with the recommendations regarding flats and lacquers.  With regard to flats, many of the small manufacturers who concentrate their product on a specific use will be unable to comply due to their limited stock, and will not be able to use the averaging provision.  While he appreciates staff&#146;s attempt to bring forward an amendment to address the problems facing small manufacturers, his staff was unable to find any manufacturer with less than $2 million in gross annual sales, thereby rendering the amendment meaningless.  The staff proposal does not differentiate between exterior and interior flats.  The manufacturers of zero VOC flats have made it clear that these coatings have specific performance characteristics and limitations that make them unsuitable for the broad applications which are necessary.  Also, the latex flats that use cold solvents with vapor pressures under certain levels are exempted by the ARB under its consumer products regulation; however, such an exemption is not included within AQMD&#146;s PAR 1113.  With regard to lacquers, the survey data used by staff is nearly 7 years old.  Seven years ago, 90 percent of lacquers were applied in the field, but today that percentage is reversed, with the overwhelming majority of applications done in controlled environments such as factories.  The result of this is much lower emissions today than 7 years ago, and emission reduction projections are erroneous and not achievable.  To meet the 550 gpl VOC limit, acetone is being advocated by staff.  These applications will take place in the field, where the use of acetone is much more volatile than in a shop or factory, and potential for injuries is a very real concern.  While staff has agreed to evaluate the final VOC limits upon conclusion of the ARB study, there should be no rush to adopt limits which are not based in solid fact, and use outdated information.  The Board should not be in the business of adopting limits for 12 years in the future based on undeveloped technology.  These limits will be included in the SIP, and attempts to roll them back at a later date will most likely be rebuffed by the EPA, as they have done with similar relaxations involving Rules 1107, 1112 and 1115.
<P><UL>MR. ANTONOVICH MOVED TO AMEND THE MAIN MOTION TO:
<P><OL><LI> ADOPT STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS ON LIMITS DEALING WITH TRAFFIC AND MULTI-COLOR COATINGS, SET TO GO INTO EFFECT JANUARY 1, 1998;
<P><LI> REFER RECOMMENDATIONS DEALING WITH FLATS AND LACQUERS BACK TO STAFF, AND INSTRUCT THE DISTRICT TO WORK WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND EASTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY ON THEIR RESPECTIVE STUDIES TO OBTAIN THE MOST CURRENT DATA; AND
<P><LI> WORK WITH INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP A RULE AMENDMENT WHICH SETS PROPOSED LIMITS AND PROJECTED EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THAT ARE GROUNDED IN FACT, USING CURRENT DATA, AND THAT ENABLE MANUFACTURERS AND USERS TO BE COMPLIANT AND ECONOMICALLY COMPETITIVE.</OL></UL>
<P> Ms. Soto expressed her belief that the difference in the amount of money made by the large manufacturers and the small manufacturers is substantial enough that there should be some consideration for small businesses in the rule.  She also asked that staff look into the job loss concerns expressed by contractors.
<P> Speaking in opposition to the motion by Mr. Antonovich, Mr. Braude emphasized that people are dying everyday from dirty air, and continuous delays in emission reduction requirements seriously impact public health.
<P><UL>THE MOTION BY MR. ANTONOVICH DIED, FOR LACK OF A SECOND.
</UL><P> Expressing her belief that the language proposed by staff to address the employment issue should be more specific and give AQMD staff a proactive responsibility to work with manufacturers and painters in dealing with the employment issue that may arise from the application of Rule 1113,
<P><UL>MS. LEE MOVED TO AMEND THE MAIN MOTION TO REPLACE THE LANGUAGE PROPOSED BY STAFF REGARDING EMPLOYMENT IMPACTS FOR INCLUSION IN THE ADOPTING RESOLUTION FOR AMENDED RULE 1113, WITH THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE:
<P><I><U>&quot;Starting six months prior to the first step of implementation of Rule 1113, </U></I><I><U>District staff will contact paint and coating manufacturers in the District who </U></I><I><U>have testified in writing or at a public hearing that job losses will result from </U></I><I><U>the rule.  If any paint or coating manufacturer still plans to reduce the number </U></I><I><U>of employees because they will not meet Rule 1113 requirements, the District </U></I><I><U>will provide that manufacturer with a list of other paint and coating makers </U></I><I><U>within the SCAQMD.  The District will ask that employers share that </U></I><I><U>information with workers who are being let go so they can contact other </U></I><I><U>prospective employers.&quot;</U></I></UL>
<P> In response to a question by Ms. Haggard regarding the suggestion to divide the flats category into &quot;interior&quot; and &quot;exterior&quot; and set separate VOC limits, Mr. Broadbent expressed staff&#146;s belief that manufacturers will have ample time under PAR 1113 to be able to reformulate <I>all</I> flats to meet the 100 gpl limit in 2001.  In addition, there is the option of using the averaging provision.
<P> Mr. Antonovich commented that the proposed amended rule takes the AQMD back to a practice of adopting regulations based upon outdated information and projections predicated upon technology that has not been developed which, in the past, resulted in driving jobs out of the basin.
<UL><P>MS. HAGGARD MOVED TO AMEND THE MAIN MOTION TO DIVIDE THE &quot;FLATS&quot; COATING CATEGORY SET FORTH IN SUBPARAGRAPH (c)(2), Table of Standards, INTO &quot;EXTERIOR FLATS&quot; AND &quot;INTERIOR FLATS&quot;, AND TO SET THE VOC LIMIT EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2001 FOR EXTERIOR FLATS AT 200 GRAMS PER LITER.

<P>*Submitted Written Comments
<P> In general, those speaking in opposition to the staff recommendation urged the Board to delay action on the AQMP until such time as certain inadequacies or deficiencies in the proposed Plan could be addressed and resolved.  The main overall concern expressed was that the proposed Plan is a step backwards from the 1994 AQMP--which was approved by USEPA in September 1996--and will not adequately protect public health to the extent that it could.  The key issues raised with respect to deficiencies/inadequacies of the proposed Plan were:
<P><UL><LI> More peer review of the Plan is needed by local medical professionals to bring the AQMD up to date on public health impacts due to the high PM10 and ozone levels in the basin, particularly in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties.
<P><LI> The proposed Plan allows an increase in the amount of pollutants the region can emit into the air on the basis that the federal standards will be met; however, merely meeting the federal standards is not sufficient to protect public health in the basin.
<P><LI> There is an overreliance in the proposed Plan on the VOC strategy and tremendous reliance and optimistic expectation about reductions from area sources.  Stronger emphasis needs to be placed on reduction of NOx emissions.
<P><LI> The AQMD needs to address the issue of localized impacts and environmental justice, which is the concept that poor people and communities of color disproportionately suffer most from the impacts of the degradation of the environment, particularly air quality.</UL>
<P> Mr. Carmichael noted that the American Lung Association (ALA) of California was unable to have a representative present at the Board meeting.  However, the ALA did submit to the Board a letter dated November 7, 1996 in opposition to the proposed Plan, and he read into the record an excerpt from that letter.  He indicated that the environmental community would support a delay in AQMD&#146;s submittal of a PM10 Plan if the AQMD used the additional time to work with ARB and EPA to come back to the Board with a Plan that better protects public health.
<P> Mr. Larson requested that proposed control measure CMB-09 (PM10 emission reductions for FCCUs) be withdrawn, or at least redesignated to Phase II, because   (i) FCCU emissions constitute a very small portion of the emissions inventory and will not significantly impact attainment,  and (ii) the cost effectiveness of this measure is questionable.  He also requested that the advanced technology control measures for fugitive emissions be deleted from the 1997 AQMP because  (i) proper credit has not been given for the VOC reductions already made,  (ii) the measures are based upon control technologies that are already being considered elsewhere,  and (iii) cost effectiveness is not considered.

<P> Those speaking in support of the proposed Plan acknowledged that the Plan is not perfect; but believe that it is moving in the right direction, and that dialogue will continue on the issues raised and those issues will be addressed during the rulemaking phase.
<P> In response to a request by Southern California Gas Company, Dr. Wallerstein indicated staff&#146;s agreement to move Phase II RECLAIM back to the category of &quot;Further Evaluation&quot;, and to incorporate that change into the staff recommendation on this item.
<P><B><I> </I></B><B><I>No position expressed:</I></B>
<P><U>LILLIAN KAWASAKI, City of Los Angeles</U>
<P> With respect to the BACM measures in the proposed Plan, noted that the operational efficiencies and the potential cross media impacts with the recently-adopted Los Angeles County storm water permit are issues that need to be resolved.  Second, a number of the AQMP measures--both the control measures and the mitigation measures--either require local government implementation or have, or could have, significant impacts on local governments.  Therefore, requested that these measures be referred to the newly-created Local Government Small Business Committee for review and input by local government during the conceptual stages of the rule development process.  Encouraged the Board, as AQMD undertakes the intercredit trading program and  the air quality investment program, not to move forward with implementation until the potential localized impacts have been addressed.  Commented that the City will continue to work with AQMD and EPA to refine the updated ship emissions inventories, and with CARB through the SIP consultative process for the federal sources.
<P>CARLA WALECKA, Realtors Committee on Air Quality
<P><U>RON HOFFMAN, Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning</U>
<P> Regarding the Clean Air Community/Livable Communities Program (FSS-03), 
<BR>Ms. Walecka agreed with staff&#146;s recommendation to remove this measure from the Plan, and emphasized that the realtors should join with AQMD in seeking clean air communities.  
<BR>Mr. Hoffman encouraged the Board to retain FSS-03 as a future study measure in the Plan.  If, however, the Board agreed with staff&#146;s recommendation to include the livable communities program as an item in the Board resolution, rather than a measure in the AQMP, his department would volunteer to work with AQMD in developing the measures or incentives that could be used by local governments to help in improving air quality.
<P><U>STAN HOLM, Mobil Oil Corporation</U>
<P> Recommended that Control Measure CMB-09, which calls for PM10 reductions from refinery FCCUs, be redesignated from a short term measure to a long term Level 2 further evaluation measure, to allow for the additional assessment the measure needs.
<P>CURTIS COLEMAN, Attorney, on behalf of California Manufacturers&#146; Association 
<BR><U>Southern California Air Quality Alliance</U><U> </U><U> </U><U> </U><U> </U><U> </U><U> </U>
<P> Commented on all the criticism the AQMD Board gets for adopting the Plan; and yet, AQMD is directly responsible for less than 15 or 20 percent of the total emissions that are creating the air quality problems in this region.  Also commented that since 1977, AQMD staff has continuously sought out VOC emissions to put into the Plan to reduce in order to show that the attainment number can be reached, with little or no consideration being given as to whether those VOCs contribute significantly to ozone formation.  He suggested that there should be an AQMD/ARB/industry task force set up to address these issues outside of the compressed context of an AQMP adoption procedure, to insure that mobile sources are accounted for accurately and that the reductions that are needed to achieve air quality standards are obtained from the proper areas.
<P> There being no further requests to address the Board, public testimony was closed on this item.

<p> Indicating that he and Ms. Haggard both serve on SCAG&#146;s Regional Council, 
<BR>Mr. Loveridge reported that the 1997 AQMP Revision was considered by two of SCAG&#146;s policy committees, heard at length in one of the standing committees, and approved unanimously by the Regional Council.
<P> In response to a question by Mr. Braude as to the loss of 80 tons of VOC emission reductions by the removal of certain rules from the AQMP, Dr. Lents explained that the rules are not being removed.  The EPA requires that a rule be adopted within 18 months for all short term measures in the AQMP.  Staff does not believe it can bring rules to the Board within 18 months that will give the emission reductions laid out in the 1994 AQMP, because the technology has not been developed.
<P> Chairman Mikels announced that in anticipation that the hearings on Rule 1113 and the 1997 AQMP Revision would be lengthy, and with the knowledge that the Board might lose a quorum, Board members anticipated that this item might need to be continued to a later date.  The consensus of the Board was to continue the item to November 15, 1996 for <I>further Board discussion and approval of </I><I>the AQMP only</I>.  There will be no public testimony allowed at the continued hearing, and no revisions other than what the Board has received to date and what was heard via public testimony at the November 8 meeting.
<P> Dr. Lents stated for the record that the health benefit/economic value in the socioeconomic assessment was calculated based on the federal standards.  He asked staff to make that calculation based on the state standards, and it was his intention to include those changes in the staff recommendation.

<P><B><I>(ii)</I></B><B><I> </I></B><B><I>SCAG Submittal dated November 7, 1996; and</I></B>
<P><B><I>(iii)</I></B><B><I> </I></B><B><I>&quot;Additional Modifications to Agenda Item #25&quot; dated November 15, 1996</I></B></UL>
<P> Mr. Silva and Dr. Burke, who were both absent from the November 8 Board meeting, indicated for the record that they had reviewed the written materials distributed at the 
<BR>November 8 meeting, as well as the cassette tape recordings of those proceedings.
<P> Dr. Lents responded to comments made during public testimony on November 8 with respect to:  the proposed Plan being a step backwards from the 1994 AQMP; the proposed Plan not being protective of public health; problems with the mobile source emission factors used; and backsliding related to increased carrying capacity in the basin.  Because the proposed Plan is designed to reach attainment of the federal air quality standards, and not the new, stricter federal standards that are expected to be proposed, there was concern expressed that the proposed Plan is not protective of public health.  The proposed Plan is designed to achieve the federal standards, because that is what is required by law.  When the new standards are promulgated by EPA, the AQMD will have to work towards meeting those standards, as will be required by law.  With respect to the mobile emission factors, staff used the latest emission factors supplied by the state.  Regarding carrying capacity, which is the amount of emissions that can occur and still meet federal air quality standards, the number reported in the proposed Plan is slightly higher than what was reported in 1994.  This is because improved modeling technology indicates that the basin can &quot;carry&quot; a few more tons and reach federal standards.  This is simply a number that the AQMD is required by law to report.  It should not, and will not, change AQMD&#146;s commitment to achieve clean air as fast as technology will allow; and it did not change AQMD&#146;s opinion on what control measures can be implemented in the short term.
<P>(Mr. Loveridge arrived at 9:55 a.m.)
<P> At Ms. Soto&#146;s request, Dr. Wallerstein responded to the request made by several environmental groups that the Board delay adoption of the Plan until after a Plan more protective of public health could be developed, since there was no requirement that the Plan be submitted until some time in 1997.  Dr. Wallerstein explained that the federal Clean Air Act requires a PM10 submittal by February 8, 1997; and the ARB needs to receive the Plan immediately in order to have sufficient time to prepare its documents and notices and submit the Plan to EPA as required.  In addition, staff believes there is nothing that can be done to significantly improve the modeling, the emissions inventories or control strategies in the near term; the Plan provides much better inventories that should allow conformity decisions to move forward much easier; the Plan removes the indirect source measures, in accordance with the position the Board has taken with the legislature; and the 1994 AQMP contains a number of measures that are not in the proposed 1997 AQMP and staff needs to realign AQMD&#146;s rule adoption schedule with the federal government.
<P> Board members commended staff for the hard work that went into developing the proposed Plan and the professional way that staff has handled its detractors, and the extensive public outreach that was done and the numerous meetings and hearings that were held throughout the basin which allowed business, government and other interested parties an opportunity to provide input to the development of the Plan throughout the process.  The consensus of the Board was that the proposed Plan is the best plan that could be developed, given the technology and data presently available, and it moves the AQMD closer towards achieving clean air in the basin; recognizing that there is an ongoing process of refining the AQMP as new data is obtained.
