  Thyristor valves for HVDC
</H2>
<H4>
  The thyristor valves do the actual conversion from AC to DC or vice versa.
  The basic circuit used is the <A HREF="l11522.htm">Graetz bridge </A>consisting
  of six valve functions, but in order to eliminate the largest harmonics,
  two such bridges are connected in series forming a 12-pulse converter. The
  valves are normally located in a valve building and arranged as three structures
  suspended from the ceiling of the valve hall. Each valve consists of a number
  of series connected <A HREF="l11521.htm">thyristors </A>with their auxiliary
  components. The valves are water cooled by a closed loop with de-ionised
  water. The thyristors are arranged in a number of modules. The ABB design
  has six thyristors per module.
</H4>
<P>
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="3dventil.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
</CENTER>
<H4>
  The thyristors are triggered by electrical gate pulses generated in a small
  thyristor control unit located near each thyristor. These units receive
  triggering impulses 50 or 60 times per second from the HVDC control system
  by means of light guides, that can transmit the triggering order from ground
  potential to each thyristor position in a valve in spite of the fact that
  a thyristor may have a voltage of 500 kV to ground!

	A DC transmission line costs less than an AC line for the same transmission
	capacity. However, the terminal stations are more expensive in the HVDC case
	due to the fact that they must perform the conversion from AC to DC and vice
	versa. But above a certain distance, the so called "break-even distance",
	the HVDC alternative will always give the lowest cost. The break-even-distance
	depends on several factors and an analysis must be made for each individual
	case. The importance of the break-even-distance concept should not be
	overstressed, since several other factors are important in the selection
	between AC or DC.

  Cable transmissions

  The above relationships apply also for submarine or underground cables. This
  is because AC needs three cables and DC only one. (The sea water or the ground
  is an excellent conductor for DC and can be used as the return conductor.)
  But cables are much more expensive than overhead lines, and therefore HVDC
  becomes economically attractive already for distances above about 50 km.

  Long distance water crossing
</H3>
<H4>
  In a long AC cable transmission, the reactive power flow due to the large
  cable capacitance will limit the maximum possible transmission distance.
  With DC there is no such limitation, why, for long cable links, HVDC is the
  only viable technical alternative. The longest HVDC submarine cable presently
  in operation is the 250 km <A HREF="l131.htm">Baltic Cable Transmission
  </A>between Sweden and Germany. Several HVDC submarine cables of 500 km or
  more are currently being planned in Europe and Asia.

  Lower losses
</H2>
<H4>
  An optimized HVDC transmission line has lower losses than AC lines for the
  same power capacity. The losses in the converter stations have of course
  to be added, but since they are only about 0.6 % of the transmitted power
  in each station, the total HVDC transmission losses come out lower than the
  AC losses in practically all cases.
</H4>
<H4>
  HVDC cables also have lower losses than AC cables.
</H4>
<H4>
  The diagram below shows a comparison of the losses for overhead line
  transmissions of 1200 MW with AC and HVDC.

  Asynchronous connection
</H2>
<H4>
  Several HVDC links interconnect AC system that are not running in synchronism
  with each other. For example the Nordel power system in Scandinavia is not
  synchronous with the UCPTE grid in western continental Europe even though
  the nominal frequencies are the same. And the power system of eastern USA
  is not synchronous with that of western USA. The reason for this is that
  it is sometimes difficult or impossible to connect two AC networks due to
  stability reasons. In such cases HVDC is the only way to make an exchange
  of power between the two networks possible.
</H4>
<H4>
  There are also HVDC links between networks with different nominal frequencies
  (50 and 60 Hz) in Japan and South America.

<H2>
  Controllability
</H2>
<H4>
  One of the fundamental advantages with HVDC is that it is very easy to control
  the active power in the link. Depending on the application and the network
  requirements, the control system can include a number of functions.
</H4>
<H4>
  In some projects, the main control is based on a constant power transfer.
  However, in many cases the link can be used to improve the AC system performance
  by means of additional control facilities. Normally these controls are activated
  automatically when certain criteria are fulfilled. Such automatic control
  functions could be constant frequency control, redistribution of the power
  flow in the AC network, damping of power swings in the AC networks etc. In
  many cases such additional control functions can make it possible to increase
  the safe power transmission capability of AC transmission lines where stability
  is a limitation.
</H4>
<P>
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="diagram.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
</CENTER>
<H4>
  Today's advanced semi-conductor technology, utilised in both power thyristors
  and microprocessors for the control system, has created almost unlimited
  possibilities for the control of the DC transmission system. By means of
  analog and digital simulation of the power system, it is possible to arrive
  at the optimum control strategies in each particular case.

<H2>
  Low short circuit currents
</H2>
<H4>
  When a high power AC transmission is constructed from a power plant to a
  major load center, the short circuit current level will increase in the receiving
  system. High short circuit currents is becoming an increasingly difficult
  problem of many large cities. They may result in a need to replace existing
  circuit breakers and other equipment if their rating is too low.
</H4>
<H4>
  If, however, new generating plants are connected to the load center via a
  DC link , the situation will be quite different. The reason is that an HVDC
  transmission does not contribute to the short circuit current of the
  interconnected AC system.

  <A HREF="http://www.vattenfall.se/">Vattenfall </A>of Sweden and PreussenElektra
  of Germany. The capacity is 600 MW at 450 kV DC. The Baltic Cable has made
  it possible to postpone the construction of new power production plants and
  that existing production plants can be used more efficiently by the owners.
  Both the converter stations and the submarine cable were delivered by ABB.

  In April 1984 ABB received a contract for the supply of a 200 MW back-to-back
  HVDC converter station to Vermont Electric Power Company (VELCO). An extremely
  short delivery time of 17 months was required, and the station was taken
  into service in September 1985. The reason for the short delivery time was
  that in the late autumn of 1983 an agreement was reached between the State
  of Vermont (USA) and the Canadian utility Hydro Quebec about the import of
  electric power to Vermont. Under the terms of this agreement Hydro Quebec
  was to export 150 MW as soon as the necessary facilities had been built and
  then increase this by a further 50 MW in 1987.
</H4>
<H4>
  It became particularly urgent to start the import of electricity from Canada
  as soon as possible, since it was planned to shut down the Vermont Yankee
  Nuclear Power Station for maintenance from mid-September 1985 for a period

  from Hydro Quebec would be profitable compared to other sources for the
  replacement power. This lead to the shortest delivery time for any HVDC project
  in the world.

  The Intermountain HVDC transmission system brings power from a coal fired
  station in Utah to the Los Angeles area. The original rated power was 1600
  MW at &#177;500 kV DC, but the link has subsequently been upgraded to 1920
  MW. Each pole has a 1200 MW continuous and 1600 MW short term
  <A HREF="l1333.htm">overload capacity</A>, to minimize the impact on the
  power system in the event of a pole outage.
</H4>
<H4>
  The receiving station in Adelanto is located in a seismically active area.
  Suspended thyristor valves are therefore used to achieve maximum security.
  Extremely stringent requirements were imposed on reliability. The ABB redundant
  converter control system is an important factor in meeting these performance
  requirements.
</H4>
<H4>
  ABB had complete turnkey responsibility for the converter stations, which
  were commissioned in April 1986.

  The Itaipu HVDC Transmission Project in Brazil, owned by
  <A HREF="http://www.furnas.gov.br/">Furnas Centrais El&eacute;tricas S.A</A>.
  in Rio de Janeiro (an
  <A HREF="http://www.embratel.net.br/infoserv/eletrobr/emenu.htm">El&eacute;trobras</A>
  company), is by far the most impressive HVDC transmission in the world. It
  has a total rated power of 6300 MW and a world record voltage of &#177;600
  kV DC. The Itaipu HVDC transmission consists of two bipolar DC transmission
  lines bringing power generated at 50 Hz in the 12600 MW Itaipu hydropower
  plant, owned bu <A HREF="http://www.cits.softex.br/socios/itaipu/">Itaipu
  Binacional</A>, to the 60 Hz network in S&atilde;o Paulo, in the industrial
  centre of Brazil.
</H4>
<H4>
  Power transmission started on bipole 1 in October 1984 with 300 kV and in
  July 1985 with 600 kV, and on bipole 2 in July 1987. The converter stations
  were commissioned stepwise in order to match the generating capacity built
  up at the Itaipu hydropower plant.
</H4>
<H4>
  HVDC was chosen basically for two reasons: partly to be able to supply power
  from the 50 Hz generators to the 60 Hz system, and partly because an HVDC
  link was economically preferable for the long distance involved.
</H4>
<H4>
  The converter stations Foz do Igua&ccedil;u and Ibiuna represent a considerable
  step forward in HVDC technology. The two stations are unique in their combination
  of size and advanced technology.

  In December 1995 the Kontek Interconnection was handed over for commercial
  operation to the owners SEAS of Denmark and VEAG of Germany. Even before
  that, the link proved to be a vital part to secure the power supply to Zealand,
  Denmark, when, in late October 1995, an anchor of a ship broke the 400 kV
  AC cable between Sweden and Denmark.
</H4>
<H4>
  The capacity is 600 MW at 400 kV DC. The strongest motivation for the project
  was the possibility to optimally operate the highly efficient thermal power
  generating units of Zealand, combined with the beneficial environmental aspects
  of low Nox and Sox of these units. In addition both interconnected areas
  will gain from higher security of operation as well as increased possibilities
  for power exchange and trading. The converter stations were delivered by
  ABB and the land and sea cable by the Danish company NKT.

  The AC systems on the South and North Islands of New Zealand were interconnected
  in 1965 by a &#177;250 kV, 600 MW HVDC transmission link. In 1992 the HVDC
  link was upgraded to 1240 MW by the grid owner Transpower. The existing link,
  with its mercury arc valves, was modified to operate in a bipolar "hybrid"
  scheme together with a new thyristor converter. The first stage of the upgrade
  was to add the 700 MW thyristor converter, and the second step was to operate
  the old and new equipment as a bipole rated 1240 MW.
</H4>
<H4>
  On average 80 per cent of New Zealand's electric energy production is from
  hydroelectric sources, most of which is produced on the South Island. However,
  the North Island accounts for almost two thirds of the total electric energy
  demand, and has a peak load almost twice that of the South Island. After
  the upgrade of the HVDC transmission as much as 25 per cent of the North
  Island's electricity demand is met by South Island hydro capacity.

<H4>
  When ABB was awarded the contract for the Quebec - New England Phase II HVDC
  project in 1986 by
  <A HREF="http://www.mais.hydro.qc.ca/Welcome.html">Hydro Qu&eacute;bec
  </A>and <A HREF="http://www.nees.com/">New England Hydro</A>, it was the
  first large multi-terminal HVDC system ever contracted. The power is generated
  at the La Grande II hydro power station in the James Bay area, converted
  into DC at the Radisson Converter Station, and transmitted over the
  multi-terminal system to load centres in Montreal and Boston.
</H4>
<H4>
  Phase I of the bipolar HVDC transmission consists of two converter stations,
  each rated 690 MW. One terminal, Des Canton, is located near Sherbrooke,
  Quebec, and the other, Comerford, near Monroe, New Hampshire. The Phase I
  converter terminals were placed in service in October 1986.
</H4>
<H4>
  The contract for Phase II included three additional converter terminals as
  well as modifications to the existing ones. The line was extended north from
  Des Canton over a distance of 1100 km to the 2250 MW Radisson terminal, located
  within the La Grande hydroelectric generating complex. Furthermore, the line
  was also extended over a distance of 214 km south from Comerford to a new
  1800 MW converter terminal at Sandy Pond, Massachusetts. This extension was
  taken into full commercial operation in 1990.
</H4>
<H4>
  In 1992 another terminal was placed in service on the multi-terminal HVDC
  system. This terminal is rated 2138 MW and located at Nicolet in the Montreal
  area.
</H4>
<H4>
  The Comerford and Des Cantons converter stations were originally to have
  been integrated into the multi-terminal scheme to enable even more operating
  flexibility, allowing five stations to operate simultaneously. After reassessing
  the benefits of this additional flexibility, however, Hydro Quebec and New
  England Hydro finally elected to suspend the commercial multi-terminal
  integration of Des Cantons and Comerford.

  National Thermal Power Corporation Limited built a 3000 MW coal-based thermal
  power station in the Sonebhadra District of Uttar Pradesh State. Part of
  the power from the Rihand complex is carried by the Rihand-Delhi HVDC bipolar
  transmission link, which has a rated capacity of 1500 MW at &#177;500 kV
  DC. Some of the power is transmitted via the existing parallel 400 kV AC
  lines.
</H4>
<H4>
  The basic aim of the HVDC link is to transmit the Rihand power efficiently
  to the Northern Region, meeting urgent needs in the area. There were several
  reasons why choosing HVDC instead of 400 kV AC. The most important ones were
  better overall economy, halved right-of-way requirements, lower transmission
  losses and better stability and controllability.
</H4>
<H4>
  The Rihand-Delhi HVDC transmission is the first commercial long-distance
  HVDC link in India, and also the largest in Asia.
</H4>
<H4>
  The two converter stations in Rihand and Dadri, outside Delhi, were supplied
  jointly by ABB and Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, a government of India
  undertaking.

	The converter transformers connect the AC network to the thyristor valve

	design depending on the power to be transmitted, and possible transport
	limitations. The most common type is a single-phase-three-winding design.
	Three identical transformers are then needed per converter. On-load tap changers

<H4>
  In ABB's HVDC 2000 concept, commutation capacitors are connected between
  the valve bridge and the converter transformers. This location has been found
  to be advantageous for several reasons. The capacitor stresses are much lower
  in this position than outside the converter transformer, as both the operating
  current and overcurrents are controlled by the valve bridge. The capacitor
  overvoltage protection can thus be handled by a varistor of reasonable size.

	The variable inductance is achieved with an iron core which is placed inside

  Outdoor valves
</H2>
<H4>
  ABB has built an air-insulated outdoor prototype valve, which has been in
  service since June 1992 in the Swedish station of the Konti-Skan 1 transmission
  link. The operation has been very succesful, and has proven the adequacy
  of the concept for further installations.

<I>Prototype outdoor valve</I>
<H4>
  Outdoor thyristor valves give full flexibility in station layout, reduce
  delivery times, reduce equipment size and make it easier to upgrade an existing
  station.
</H4>
<H4>
  The outdoor valve unit contains a single valve function. Consequently, 12
  units are needed for a 12-pulse converter. Inside the outdoor valve unit,
  the electrical configuration is of traditional design with thyristor modules
  and reactor modules as for present indoor valves built by ABB. Therefore,
  valve maintenance is as easy to perform as for the ABB indoor valves.

  Active DC filter
</H2>
<H4>
  Demands regarding permitted interference levels from DC lines have become
  increasingly stringent in recent years. ABB has therefore developed an active
  DC filter that enables efficient filtering using a small-size filter.
</H4>
<H3>
  Operating principles
</H3>
<H4>
  The principle of the active DC filter is to inject a current generated by
  a power amplifier into the DC circuit cancelling the DC side harmonics coming
  from the converter. The amplifier is controlled by a high speed digital signal
  processor controller.

<P>
ABB Power Systems' philosophy is that the series capacitor bank
should be designed to give at least the same degree of reliability
as that of the transmission lines, to permit integration in the
power transmission system without reducing availability.
<P>
Series compensation in a transmission system improves voltage
control and reactive power balance, because the reactive power
generation in series capacitors increases as the transmitted power
increases. In this respect, the series capacitor is a self-regulating
device.<HR>

<P>
<IMG SRC="sctech01.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></CENTER> 
<P>
The transmission system configuration and the requirements regarding
protective equipment and reinsertion time determine the protective
scheme to be adopted. The time, i.e. the time from when a faulty
line section is disconnected to when the series capacitors are
again in fully operation is often the most essential factor to
be taken into consideration.<HR>

ABB power Systems' series capacitor banks are designed to provide
maximum safety for personnel, simplify layout and minimize the
need for maintenance. The well-proven design minimizes the required
ground space.
<P>
The capacitors and protective equipment for the high voltage system
are placed on steel platforms, fully insulated to the earth. The
equipment for each phase is located on individual platforms. These
platforms are fenced-in and suitable inspection corridors are
provided.<BR>
Via the inspection corridors, access can be obtained to the operating
device of the by-pass breaker for the purpose of inspection and
performing local operations. The platform mounted equipment is
electrically connected to the platform at one point only, but
is otherwise insulated from it.
<P>
The protective relays required for the series capacitors are normally
installed in a control building.

<B>SVC System Technology</B> 
<P>
The characteristics of ABB's Static Var Compensators are their
flexibility, dependability and their exceptional controllability.
We have an SVC solution for every situation. Our SVC can be used
for symmetrical three-phase control or phase-by phase control.
<P>
<B>Thyristor Controlled Reactor (TCR)</B> 
<P>
A reactor and a thyristor valve are incorporated in each single-phase
branch. The power is changed by controlling the current through
the reactor by means of the thyristor valve. The on-state interval
is controlled by delaying the firing of the thyristor valve in
relation to the natural current zero.<BR>
A TCR is used together with a fixed capacitor bank when reactive
power generation is required.
<P>

The characteristics of a TCR are:
<UL>
<LI><B>Continuous control</B> 
<LI><B>No transients</B> 
<LI><B>Generation of harmonics</B> 
</UL>
<HR>

<P>
<B>Thyristor Switched Capacitor (TSC)</B> 
<P>
A shunt capacitor bank is divided into a suitable number of branches.
Each branch is individually switched in or out by means of a valve
with antiparallel connected thyristors. All switching takes place
when the voltage across the thyristor valve is zero, thus providing
almost transient-free switching.<BR>
Disconnection is effected by suppressing the firing pulses to
the thyristors, which will block when the current reaches zero.
<P>
<IMG SRC="tsc.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<P>
The characteristics of a TSC are:
<UL>
<LI><B>Stepwise control</B> 
<LI><B>No transients</B> 
<LI><B>No harmonics</B> 
<LI><B>Low losses</B> 
<LI><B>Redundancy and flexibility</B> 
</UL>
<HR>

<P>
<B>Thyristor Switched Capacitor / Thyristor controlled Reactor
(TSC / TCR)</B> 
<P>
A combination of TSC and TCR is, in the majority of cases, the
optimum solution.<BR>
With a combined TSC/TCR compensator, continuously variable reactive
power is obtained throughout the complete control range as well
as full control of both the inductive and the capacitive parts
of the compensator.<BR>
This is a very advantageous feature permitting optimum performance
during large disturbances in the power system.

<B>SVC Electromechanical Design</B> 
<P>
ABB Power Systems has the resources to supply complete Static
Var Compensators on a turnkey basis.<BR>
With our computer programs, we can determine the optimum position
of an SVC in your network. We can also optimise the flow of active
and reactive power with respect to production costs and transmission
losses, study the influence of load variations from, for example,
rolling mills, arc furnaces and motor drives, and propose measures
for reducing voltage variations.
<P>
The items included in our SVCs are to a large extent manufactured
in our own factories, either at the parent company in Sweden or
at the plants of our subsidiaries in Sweden and elsewhere.<BR>
With the aid of advanced computer programs for planning and control,
we can maintain short delivery times and effectively control all
the activities associated with the complete turnkey projects.

<B>Static Var Compensation References</B> 
<P>
ABB Power Systems has a leading position with around 50% market
share in the field of static var compensation.
<P>
The company became aware of the importance of effective and rapid
control of reactive power very early on. We were the first company
in the world to commission a large commercial thyristor-switched
capacitor installation.

<P>
The research started at our company in 1967 and the world's first
commercial installation of thyristor-switched capacitors (TSC)
for an industrial application was delivered in 1972. Since then
have the number of installations increased to 280 in 46 different
countries, with the totally installed power of more than 30.000
Mvar.<HR>

<B>Problem med optimal verkningsgrad?</B> 
<P>
Naturligtvis skall du str&auml;va efter s&aring; h&ouml;g verkningsgrad
som m&ouml;jligt i ditt n&auml;t. Det ger maximal &ouml;verf&ouml;ringsf&ouml;rm&aring;ga
och minimala f&ouml;rluster.<BR>
Verkningsgraden kan f&ouml;rb&auml;ttras genom att tillf&ouml;ra
reaktiv effekt s&aring; n&auml;ra f&ouml;rbrukningen som m&ouml;jligt.
Med f&ouml;r mycket reaktiv effekt i ditt n&auml;t minskar m&ouml;jligheten
att &ouml;verf&ouml;ra aktiv effekt. Det g&auml;ller att med utg&aring;ngspunkt
fr&aring;n f&ouml;rbrukningen optimera f&ouml;rh&aring;llandet
mellan aktiv och reaktiv effekt.
<P>
Den reaktiva effekten beh&ouml;vs dock f&ouml;r att bygga upp
magnetf&auml;lt i till exempel elmotorer, transformatorer, ugnar,
svetsutrustningar och andra elektriska apparater. <BR>
&Auml;ven sp&auml;nningen &auml;r beroende av den reaktiva effekten.
&Ouml;kar uttaget av reaktiv effekt, sjunker sp&auml;nningen.
F&ouml;r att f&aring; j&auml;mn sp&auml;nning och h&ouml;g elkvalitet
m&aring;ste den reaktiva effekten h&aring;llas p&aring; r&auml;tt
niv&aring; s&aring; att variationer p&aring; grund av oj&auml;mn
belastning kompenseras.
<P>
Reaktiv effekt orsakar ocks&aring; on&ouml;diga och dyrbara f&ouml;rluster
i ledningar och transformatorer. &Ouml;verbelastade st&auml;llverk
och transformatorer f&aring;r f&ouml;rkortad livsl&auml;ngd och
kan f&ouml;rorsaka elavbrott och produktionsstopp.<HR>

<P>
<B>Konsekvenser och kostnader!</B> 
<P>
Konsekvenser av d&aring;lig verkningsgrad f&ouml;r ofta med sig
h&ouml;ga kostnader. Kostnader f&ouml;r produktionsst&ouml;rningar,
f&ouml;rluster, f&ouml;rkortad livsl&auml;ngd p&aring; n&auml;t
och apparater samt h&ouml;g taxa f&ouml;r &ouml;veruttag av reaktiv
effekt.<HR>

<P>

<P>
ABB har l&ouml;sningar. Faskompenseringsutrustning med eller utan
filter, styrd kompensering och seriekompensering &auml;r exempel
som kan f&ouml;rb&auml;ttra verkningsgraden och d&auml;rmed minska
kostnader.

<B>Problem med osymmetri, flicker och sp&auml;nningsvariationer?</B>

<P>
Sp&auml;nningsvariationer, flicker och osymmetri kan uppst&aring;
i till exempel anl&auml;ggningar med ljusb&aring;gsugnar, valsverk
och enfaslaster.<BR>
I svaga n&auml;t kan &auml;ven andra typer av laster, till exempel
svetsar, st&ouml;rre motorer och kranar, orsaka dessa problem.
<BR>
F&ouml;r att f&ouml;rb&auml;ttra verkningsgraden och skapa en
totalt sett h&ouml;g elkvalitet m&aring;ste &auml;ven dessa problemomr&aring;den
beaktas, d&aring; de bland annat kan orsaka st&ouml;rande arbetsmilj&ouml;
och leda till produktionsstopp och f&ouml;rlust av data i olika
styr- och datorenheter.<HR>

<P>
<B>Sp&auml;nningsvariationer</B> 
<P>
Med sp&auml;nningsvariationer menas att sp&auml;nningen varierar
kortvarigt utan att f&ouml;r den skull definieras som flicker.
<BR>
Detta uppst&aring;r p&aring; grund av att lasten varierar &ouml;ver
tiden och d&auml;rmed varierar det reaktiva effektuttaget. Det
leder till sp&auml;nningsvariationer och s&auml;mre utnyttjande
av framf&ouml;r allt v&auml;xelstr&ouml;msutrustningen.
<P>
M&aring;nga utrustningar kan g&ouml;ras mindre k&auml;nsliga genom
att de matas via batterier eller UPS. Att d&auml;remot &aring;tg&auml;rda
sj&auml;lva k&auml;llan till problemet inneb&auml;r reaktiv effektkompensering
med hj&auml;lp av snabbkopplade kondensatorer och reaktorer.<HR>

<P>
<B>Flicker</B> 
<P>
Flicker &auml;r irriterande blinkningar i belysningen vid en frekvens
som ligger under 50 Hz. De orsakas av mycket snabba lastvariationer
som p&aring;verkar sp&auml;nningen, till exempel ljusb&aring;gsugnar
och svetsar.<BR>
Flicker kan st&ouml;ra stora geografiska omr&aring;den kring st&ouml;rk&auml;llan,
speciellt om n&auml;tet &auml;r svagt.
<P>
St&ouml;rningarna kan minskas genom att effektuttaget stabiliseras,
exempelvis genom att installera seriereaktor p&aring; ugnar eller
med hj&auml;lp av styrd kompensering som motverkar lasternas reaktiva
effekuttag.<HR>

<P>
<B>Osymmetri</B> 
<P>
Obalanserade laster skapar osymmetri mellan faserna och kan orsaka
&ouml;verlast p&aring; olika v&auml;xelstr&ouml;smaskiner.<BR>
En str&ouml;mriktare som snedbelastas kan d&aring; generera &ouml;vertoner
vid flera frekvenser &auml;n de karakteristiska. Konsekvenserna
&auml;r f&ouml;rkortad livsl&auml;ngd p&aring; apparater, maskinhaverier
med driftstopp som f&ouml;ljd och dyrare maskiner f&ouml;r att
klara st&ouml;rniv&aring;n.
<P>
Med hj&auml;lp av styrd kompensering kan problemet helt avhj&auml;lpas
genom att fasvis tillf&ouml;ra och avleda reaktiv effekt. P&aring;
s&aring; s&auml;tt kan sp&auml;nningssymmetri uppn&aring;s.<HR>

<P>
ABB har l&ouml;sningar. En gemensam l&ouml;sning f&ouml;r dessa
tre problemomr&aring;den &auml;r installation av styrd kompensering
som ger h&ouml;gre verkningsgrad utan risk f&ouml;r &ouml;verkompensering,
l&auml;gre &ouml;vertonshalt, inga kopplingstransienter, stabiliserad
sp&auml;nning och reduktion av osymmetri och flicker.
<P>
<B>Kontakta oss p&aring; ABB n&auml;r du beh&ouml;ver r&aring;d
och konkreta l&ouml;sningar!</B>

	Dr. Lamm was the man most responsible, as an engineer and manager, for research
	and development, that led to the first practical application of an HVDC
	connection between two AC systems. The keys to solution of this program were
	the development of an electric valve, which could be used in high capacity,
	high voltage converters, and a fundamental system technology.

<H4>
  Dr Uno Lamm graduated from the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm 1927
  and acquired his Doctorate of Technology in 1943. He joined ASEA in 1928
  with the task of developing mercury arc rectifiers as an early assignment.
  During his career with ASEA, he received progressively more responsible
  appointments: Head of the Rectifier Department; Head of ASEA's Nuclear
  Department; Electrotechnical Director; and Consultant to the President of
  ASEA. He was a Fellow of <A HREF="http://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</A>and the 1965
  recipient of the Benjamin Lamme Medal.
  <P>
  The <A HREF="l11411.htm">Uno Lamm High Voltage Direct Current Award</A> was
  established in 1980 to recognize outstanding achievements in the HVDC field.
  <P>
  Dr. Lamm passed away in 1989 at the age of 85.

<H4>The voltage contribution from the commutation capacitors supports
the commutation of current from one valve to the next. This means
that the CCC will continue normal operation even during large
AC voltage disturbances since it is much more robust than the
conventional HVDC converter. Typically, a CCC can tolerate a sudden
15-20% voltage drop without causing a commutation failure.</H4>

  Dynamic stability improved
</H2>
<H4>
  The dynamic stability of a CCC HVDC transmission is greatly improved due
  to the contribution to the commutation voltage from the capacitors resulting
  in a positive inverter operating characteristic. A conventional inverter
  has a negative operating characteristic, which is destabilizing, and if the
  AC network has a low short-circuit capacity, this could cause problems.

</CENTER>
<H4>
  The improved stability is demonstrated by the curves for maximum available
  power, (MAP). The important consequence is that the CCC is far less sensitive
  to such circumstances and can be connected to networks having a much lower
  short-circuit capacity than a conventional converter.

  The MAP curves also demonstrate that the load rejection overvoltage (AC voltage
  at Id=0) is much lower with a CCC. This is because of lower reactive power
  generation in the small shunt filters.

      A key component in a CCC is the commutation capacitor. The steady state operating
      voltage of the capacitor is defined by the direct current. The capacitor
      is protected against overvoltage by parallel ZnO varistors. Since both the
      voltage stresses on the capacitor and the energy requirements for the varistor
      are relatively low compared to the installed capacity, the commutation capacitors
      can be made very compact.

<H4>An important influence from the capacitors on other equipment
is the reduction of valve short-circuit current. A capacitor located
between the converter transformer and the valve bridge will build
up a counter-voltage at transient currents, reducing the valve
short-circuit current typically to less than 50% compared to a
conventional circuit.</H4>

<B>Single-gap Protective Principle</B> 
<P>
The basic protective scheme for series capacitors is shown in
the diagram below.
<P>
In parallel with the capacitor bank, there is a spark gap which
will by-pass the bank in the event of excessive overvoltages caused
by system faults. The short-circuit current then flows through
the spark gap instead of through the capacitors. A damping circuit
limits the amplitude and provides the required damping of the
capacitor discharge current.<BR>
To by-pass and reinsert the series capacitors, a by-pass breaker
is incorporated.<BR>
The single-gap scheme is designed to provide medium speed reinsertion,
aprox. 200-400 ms, which in most cases is fully adequate.

<B>Metal Oxide Varistor (MOV) Protective Principle</B> 
<P>
A non-linear resistor of zinc-oxide (ZnO) type limits the voltage
across the series capacitor during a fault sequence and reinserts
the bank immediately on termination of the fault current. The
energy is normally absorbed by the ZnO varistor without necessitating
the firing of the spark gap or closing of the by-pass breaker.
The series capacitor and the ZnO varistor are in circuit during
the fault period and reinsertion takes place automatically and
without delay when the line fault is cleared.

<B>Controllable Series Capacitor Technology</B> 
<P>
The structure of the transmission networks of power systems leads
to several operational challenges which may be helped by appropriate
forms of series compensation technology. Thyristor Controlled
Series Capacitors (TCSC), Thyristor Switched Series Capacitors
(TSSC) and Mechanically Switched Series Capacitors (MSSC) provide
a proven technology that can address the different needs of the
transmission system.<HR>

<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="kanaw.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </CENTER><HR>

<P>
All installations of series compensation presently in operation
use passive capacitor banks as the main component to provide reactive
power. Adding control means to the fixed capacitor permits a variation
of the inserted capacitor reactance, physically or virtually,
so that the degree of compensation can be controlled. Such means
may be based on mechanical switching equipment or on semiconductor
technology in the form of power thyristors.

<H1><B>SIMPOW Functions: A brief overview</H1>
<FONT SIZE =4>
<P>
A brief general overview of the major functions of SIMPOW
is given below. The overview is in the first place referred
to a.c. systems; d.c. systems can, however, also be
simulated by SIMPOW.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
OPTPOW<BR></FONT></CENTER></B>
<P>
This function can be characterized, in general terms, as 
a static simulation of a power system under steady-state 
symmetrical conditions, considering the power-frequency 
voltages and currents. 
<P>
Basically, the power system is represented by a 
single-phase model using positive-sequence quantities 
only. A large variety of constraints (variables to be at  
fixed values or within limits) can be pre-specified. The 
state of the system is given by the node voltages in the 
form of phasors, injected active and reactive powers and 
some other variables.
<P>
The numerical technique employed to solve the power-flow 
problem is optionally either a so-called "dynamic" 
method or the usual Newton-Raphson method. 
<P>
The OPTPOW function is used for usual power-flow 
simulations.
<P>
<a name="dymt"></a>
<HR>
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>DYNPOW: TRANSTA and MASTA
</B></CENTER></FONT><BR>
<P>
Each of the subfunctions TRANSTA (transient stability) and 
MASTA (machine stability) of DYNPOW can be characterized, 
in a wide sense, as a dynamic simulation of a power 
system under steady-state or disturbed symmetrical or 
asymmetrical conditions. Emphasis is laid on the influence 
of machine dynamics and of automatic control systems.
<P>
The principle difference between the two subfunctions 
is that TRANSTA simulates the power-frequency components 
of a.c. system voltages and currents (and the average 
values of d.c. system voltages and currents) while 
MASTA simulates the instantaneous values of voltages 
and currents. Switchings between the TRANSTA (phasor) 
mode and the MASTA (instantaneous-value) mode, 
or vice versa, can (with some restrictions) be made 
during the course of a simulation.
<P>
In the TRANSTA modelling, the power system primary 
components are basically represented by models described 
in terms of symmetrical-component quantities. In the 
MASTA modelling, the power system primary components 
are basically represented by models described in terms 
of dq0 quantities (optionally abc quantities). Furthermore, 
in the MASTA modelling, the components of the network and 
of the passive shunt elements, including loads, are 
considered as lumped-element RLC circuits with constant 
parameter values. The so-called transformer voltages of 
rotating machines are included.
<P>
DYNPOW has a comprehensive set of models available, 
including such of HVDC and SVC systems.
<P>
DYNPOW uses an implicit predictor-corrector method of 
integration for simultaneous solution of all the algebraic 
and differential equations. The default method is a 
combination of the Gear's integration method and the 
trapetsoidal integration method, with automatically  
controlled variable time step. The solution method 
assures retained accuracy and numerical stability also 
for long-term simulations.
<P>
DYNPOW is useful for a wide spectrum of study types,  
TRANSTA particularly in cases of a large power system, 
e.g. for traditional stability studies, and  MASTA 
particularly in cases of a small power system but with 
requirement of detailed time resolution.
</PRE>
<a name="linear"></a>
<HR>
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>DYNPOW: Linear Analysis</B>
</CENTER>
</FONT>
<P>
DYNPOW includes functions for linear system analysis: 
Eigenvalue and frequency response techniques. In the
general study case, these techniques include linearization
of the power system equations at the actual operating state
and considering only incremental changes of the state
variables around the quiscent point.
<P>
The eigenvalue techniques available are:
<UL>
<LI>Calculation of eigenvalues and corresponding 
eigenvectors
<LI>Sensitivity analysis of an eigenvalue with respect to 
parameters 
<LI>Providing an eigenvalue locus diagram, in the complex
plane, for varying values of a parameter
<LI>Providing a single-line power system diagram with
"vector" visualization of the generator speed components of
the eigenvectors related to a selected pair of complex
eigenvalues (corresponding to a particular mode of
generator electromechanical oscillations).
</UL>
The eigenvalue techniques can be applied at any time during 
a simulation. These techniques are excellent 
tools for the study of the small-signal behaviour and 
stability of generators and automatic control systems.
<P>
The frequency response technique available:
<UL>
<LI>Providing calculation (in the frequency domain) of 
the response of selected variables to a sinusoidal 
perturbation, either in the form of a current injected 
to a selected node or by adding a signal to a selected 
variable. Frequency scanning is performed for a specified 
range of frequencies.
</UL>
This technique is valuable, not at least for treating
harmonic matters.
</PRE>
<a name="dsl"></a>
<HR>
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>DYNPOW: DSL</B></CENTER></FONT><BR>
<P>
DYNPOW includes a so-called "dynamic simulation language" 
(DSL) by which the user himself can introduce models of 
practically any type of power system components, not only 
of automatic control systems (regulators) but also of 
primary components , for example of FACTS devices, drive 
systems and special machines. 
<P>
Among the properties of DSL, mention can be made of the 
ability to handle dead-time delays and the ability to 
handle DSL-model equations written in implicit form. 
Furthermore, the DSL equations are solved simultaneously 
with all other equations of the total system simulated.
<P>
<a name="stapow"></a>
<HR>
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE =4><B>STAPOW</B></CENTER></FONT>
<P>
This function can be characterized, in general terms, 
as a static simulation of a power system under 
steady-state symmetrical or asymmetrical conditions, 
considering power-frequency voltages and currents.
<P>
The STAPOW function post-processes a linearized 
&quot;frozen&quot; state from a TRANSTA simulation, 
at an arbitrary point of time after the occurrence 
of an event; normally at zero time.
<P>
The STAPOW function is, in the first place, used for 
calculations of power-frequency short-circuit currents. 
The extent of such a calculation can be specified to 
include the short circuit currents, their distribution, 
their positive, negative and zero sequence components, 
as well as the corresponding short circuit impedances 
seen from the faulty nodes.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE =4><B>Short-circuit current 
calculation according IEC 909</B></CENTER></FONT>
<P>
SIMPOW also includes a function by which short-circuit
currents can be calculated according the procedure and
rules of the Standard IEC 909, which is aimed to produce
conservative results. Maximum and minimum values of
initial, peak, breaking and steady-state short-circuit
currents on arbitrary nodes can be calculated.</PRE>

<B>Applications of Controllable Series Compensation</B> 
<P>
Series compensation is a well-established technology for increasing
the power carrying capability of transmission lines. Series capacitors
act by inserting a voltage in series with the transmission line
whose polarity is opposite to the voltage drop across the line.
The net effect is the decrease of the apparent reactance of the
transmission line. The different control methods for series capacitors
can be an appropriate solution for following system challenges.
<HR>

<P>
<B>High series compensation level</B> 
<P>
Series Capacitors increase the power carrying capability of transmission
lines and thus allow a higher utilization level of transmission-limited
power plants. The level of allowable compensation in transmission
networks has traditionally been limited due to the potential interactions
between the series capacitors and the shafts of nearby turbine-generator
units. This phenomena is known as subsynchronous resonance (SSR).
Some forms of controlled series capacitors permit a high level
of compensation without the fear of SSR.<HR>

<P>
<B>Power oscillation damping</B> 
<P>
Many large power system experience undamped power oscillations
in the frequency range of 0.2-2.0 Hz across critical tie-lines
when a high level of power, relative to the transmission capacity,
is transmitted over a long distance. Controlled series capacitors
can provide an active damping for these oscillations and therefor
permit the transfer of larger levels of power for longer distances.
Furthermore, controlled series capacitors can provide critical
support to the power system following major disturbances and enable
the system to remain in synchronous operation.<HR>

<P>
<B>Interconnections</B> 
<P>
Two power systems are usually interconnected in order to either
transfer economical power from one system to the other, or to
share the spinning reserve resources of both systems and thus
enhance the overall reliability of both systems. Controlled series
capacitors are an effective means of interconnecting two power
systems in order to utilize the economic interchange of power
even when the interconnection points are electrically weak.<HR>

<P>
<B>Power flow control</B> 
<P>
Controlled series capacitors allow the operator to control the
level of power flow on a transmission line. This is especially
beneficial following a line-outage contingency where the uneven
distribution of power between various transmission circuits might
lead to overloading and force the operator to reduce the capacity
usage of many lines.<HR>

<P>
<B>Loadability control</B>
<P>
Controlled series capacitors are an effective means of increasing
the power carrying capability of transmission lines. The level
of compensation can be controlled in order to minimize system
losses during normal operation, while increasing the power transfer
on lower voltage circuits during contingencies on the higher voltage
transmission system.<HR>

<B>More about Controlled Series Capacitor Technology</B> <HR>

<P>
Controllable series capacitors (CSC) have the possibility to optimize
their degree of compensation over a wide range under various network
conditions, partly or fully by means of thyristor switching, thereby
offering themselves as an active component for power flow control
in networks.<BR>
By adjusting the degree of compensation to the network operating
conditions, control of the level of firm power delivery through
a specific line is possible. A distribution of power flow through
several parallel lines can be achieved to secure the transfer
capability in case of an outage in part of the system, or in order
to ascertain the lowest possible transmission losses.<BR>
In networks interconnected by weak links, active power oscillations
may occur as a result of a disturbance to the system. The thyristor
controlled series capacitor can furthermore be useful as a means
for damping of such power oscillations<HR>

<P>
<B>Mechanically Switched Series Capacitors</B> 
<P>
A straightforward implementation of a controllable series capacitor
is offered by mechanically switched segments. Careful selection
of size for a few segments provides a large variation of the inserted
capacitive reactance with adequate resolution.<BR>
The obvious attributes of the MSSC are freedom from harmonic generation
in sustained operation and negligible conduction losses. The typical
speed of response is 50-100 ms from command to execution of by-pass
or insertion of a segment. The frequency of operation is limited
by the maintenance interval of the mechanical breaker.
<P>
<IMG SRC="sctech05.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<P>
The characteristics of an MSSC are:
<UL>
<LI><B>General design as for fixed series capacitor installations</B>

<LI><B>Adequate for steady state control of power flow</B> 
<LI><B>Adequate for limited number of daily adjustments of compensation
degree</B> 
</UL>
<HR>

<P>
<B>Thyristor Switched Series Capacitor</B> 
<P>
Thyristor switched series capacitor TSSC is an extension of the
MSSC principle where the mechanical switching is replaced by power
thyristors. The thyristors are made fully conducting or fully
blocking for any number of half-cycles as desired.<BR>
The inserted reactance response follows the command within one
half-cycle of the main frequency. Sequences of reactance changes
can be performed within any period of time. Further, unlimited
number of operations can be performed without any need for maintenance.
No sustained harmonics are generated due to the switching mode
operation of the thyristors.

The characteristics of a TSSC are:
<UL>
<LI><B>General design as for fixed series capacitor installations</B>

sensors in the main HV circuit</B> 
<LI><B>The integrated thyristor scheme in the capacitor overvoltage

<LI><B>Unrestricted number of operations and sequences</B> 
<LI><B>Adequate for frequent adjustment of compensation degree
for loadability control and damping of electromechanical oscillations.</B>

</UL>
<HR>

<P>
<B>Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor</B> 
<P>
The capacitor bank is provided with a parallel thyristor controlled
inductor that circulates current pulses which add in phase with
the line current. This boosts the capacitor voltage beyond the
level that would be obtained by the line current alone. Each thyristor
is triggered once per cycle and has a conduction interval that
is shorter than a half-cycle of the rated mains frequency.<BR>
If the additional voltage created by the circulating current pulses
is controlled to be proportional to the line current, the transmission
system will perceive the TCSC as having a virtually increased
reactance beyond the physical reactance of the capacitor. Due
to the sub-cycle conduction interval of the thyristors, harmonic
currents will be injected into the capacitor. Harmonic currents
increase with the boost level. In fact the scheme can provide
an accurate setting of the compensation degree, with a high resolution
as well as an SSR immune series compensation even at high compensation
degrees.

Klackarna i taket.  ABB  r  rets bsta IT-anvndare i industri-klassen. 
Mste en av vrldens strsta industrikoncerner vara bra IT-anvndare?  Ja, det verkar s. ABB r ett paradexempel p ett bolag som jobbar "glokalt". Det finns 1 000 operativa bolag inom ABB.  200 000 anstllda. Verksamhet ver hela vrlden. Klart att en sdan koloss mste ha mycket IT.  Men det r inte drfr vi utser ABB till rets IT-anvndare i industriklassen. Utan fr att de lyckats infra IT-std globalt utan att pracka p lokala anvndare centrala system.<BR>
- Det fanns 17 olika system fr elektronisk post inom ABB, sger ABBs hgsta IT-chef Bengt Skantze frn huvudkontoret i Zrich.
<P> 

Det blir vl ltt s om man kper bolag i den takt som ABB gr. Och finns det 17 postsystem finns det skert 170 olika ekonomisystem, allt frn egenutvecklade COBOL-system till moderna helintegrerade paket som SAP R/3. I IT-arbetet p ABB finns stor lyhrdhet fr lokala anvndares individuella behov. Koncernens eget IT-konsultbolag heter ABB Infosystems och man har rubriken "Frndringsarbete" p i stort sett allt man gr.<BR>
 - Vrt T-50 tar aldrig slut, sger Sten Ahlberg p Infosystems. 
 - Vi gr nu vidare och hjlper olika ABB-bolag att frndra sina administrativa processer.
<P>
Infosystems blev sjlv ett certifierat T-50-bolag i maj 1994 och har ocks certifierats enligt ISO 9000.
<P>

<B>"Resandes ensak"</B><BR>
- Alla ABB-bolag ska g frn den gamla hierakiska organisationen till den process-styrda, sger Ahlberg. ABB-bolagen mste vara flexibla. Man ska snabbt kunna svara p marknadens behov. Fr Infosystems del betydde det praktiskt att man lyckades integrera 25 personer frn ett annat fretag p blott tv mnader.<BR>
- Administrativ beredskap kallar vi sdant, menar Ahlberg.
<P>
 
Andra ABB-bolag anvnder Infosystems och andra konsulter och fristende produkter fr att uppn samma ml. ABB Treasury Center  r koncernens internbank. Dr har man lyckats halvera produktionstiderna fr riskrapporter, mnadsbokslut och kundbekrftelser.  Och sedan 1990 har antalet affrer frdubblats. S hr jobbar man p ABB. Lokala bolag v ljer l sningar som g r dem maximalt flexibla. Sedan kopplas bolagen ihop i stora ntverk och anvndare kan kommunicera och dela information med Lotus Notes. ABB  r en av vrldens 25 strsta ntverksanvndare och 65 000 personer av bolagets 200 000 anstllda anvnder Notes dagligen.

Verksamheten inom S&ouml;dra Skogs&auml;garnas fd databolag S&ouml;dra Data AB slogs den 1 april samman med ABB Infosystems. F&ouml;r ABB Infosystems inneb&auml;r det ett v&auml;lkommet tillskott av kompetens och utbud inte minst inom skogsbranschen. F&ouml;r kunderna inneb&auml;r det att fd S&ouml;dra Datas tj&auml;nster f&ouml;r t ex underh&aring;llsstyrning, ekonomistyrning och OLF-hantering "Order, Lager, Fakturering" f&aring;r resurser f&ouml;r en vidareutveckling, b&aring;de genom funktionsm&auml;ssigt nyt&auml;nkande och teknikskifte, vilket i slut&auml;nden medf&ouml;r en tryggad framtida tillvaro f&ouml;r     de som redan nu har eller kommer att v&auml;lja dessa tj&auml;nster.<P>

<B>Fakta om Merit</B><P>

Merit Underh&aring;llssystem &auml;r ett kraftfullt verktyg f&ouml;r underh&aring;llsavdelningen inom industrin. Systemet &auml;r framtaget av fd S&ouml;dra Data inom S&ouml;dra Skogs&auml;garna och finns installerat inom skogsbranschens olika verksamhetsgrenar, i kemisk industri, verkstadsindustri samt energiverk i Sverige och Norge -

<LI>Projekthantering<P>


Merit finns i UNlX-milj&ouml; f&ouml;r olika h&aring;rdvaruplattformar (t ex HP, SUN Digital IBM) och med vaifri relationsdatabas (lngres, Oracle, Sybase). Ett f&auml;rdigt gr&auml;nssnitt m&ouml;jligg&ouml;r integrationer mot andra system som ekonomisystem, produktionssystem, CAD o dyl. Funktioner f&ouml;r multimedia finns ocks&aring;. Arbetsplatserna kan vara allt fr&aring;n enkla terminaler till X-terminaler, PC under Windows, arbetsstationer och Macintosh. <P>

Vidareutveckling och underhall av Merit sker kontinuerligt och p&aring; s&aring;dant s&auml;tt att inga skillnader finns p&aring; standardprogramvaran oavsett milj&ouml;. Individuella anpassningar ligger i helt separata moduler specifika f&ouml;r varje kund. <P>

Merits anv&auml;ndarf&ouml;rening d&auml;r samtliga kundf&ouml;retag medverkar, borgar f&ouml;r en stark, engagerad och funktionell utveckling av systemet.

v&auml;xer med ISDN</FONT></B><HR><BR>

ABB Infosystems erbjuder ISDN-anslutningar mot ABBs fasta Sverige n&auml;t. ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) &auml;r en kommunikationsarkitektur som integrerar tal-, data och bild&ouml;verf&ouml;ring samtidigt och p&aring; samma linje. <BR>
Telekombolagens utbyggnad av ISDN har &ouml;kat kraftigt i Europa under det senaste &aring;ret. Det m&ouml;jligg&ouml;r en m&aring;ngfald av integrerade applikationer. Framf&ouml;rallt inneb&auml;r detta en h&ouml;g &ouml;verf&ouml;ringskapacitet till en l&aring;g kostnad. <P>

<B>Billigt komplement</B><BR>
&Ouml;verf&ouml;ringshastigheten f&ouml;r ISDN &auml;r normalt 64 kbit/s att j&auml;mf&ouml;ras med det fasta linjen&auml;tet d&auml;r &ouml;verf&ouml;ringshastigheter fr&aring;n 64 kbit/s till 2 Mbit/s. I det fasta n&auml;tet &auml;r anslutningarna uppkopplade dygnet runt och avsedda f&ouml;r en kontinuerligt h&ouml;g trafik. Med ISDN betalar man enbart f&ouml;r den tid man &auml;r uppkopplad. Oberoende p&aring; var i n&auml;tet noderna finns &auml;r kostnaden densamma som f&ouml;r lokalsamtal eller rikssamtal. Sammantaget inneb&auml;r detta att totalkostnaden f&ouml;r en ISDN-anslutning ofta blir mindre &auml;n h&auml;lften, j&auml;mf&ouml;rt med vad en fast linje med motsvarande kapacitet skulle kosta.<P>

<B>Betydligt l&auml;gre kostnader</B><BR>
ISDN erbjuder d&auml;rmed client/server-milj&ouml;er LAN till LAN kommunikation till betydligt l&auml;gre kostnader &auml;n en fast linje. Riktm&auml;rket f&ouml;r kostnadseffektiviteten ligger vid ca fyra timmars uppkopplingstid per dag. F&ouml;r ett litet kontor med n&aring;gra f&aring; medarbetare som bara beh&ouml;ver anv&auml;nda n&auml;tet tillf&auml;lligt &auml;r det ett utm&auml;rkt alternativ. Inom ABB finns det fortfarande m&aring;nga f&ouml;retagskontor som inte &auml;r anslutna till Sverigen&auml;tet men med ISDN-teknikens m&ouml;jligheter r&auml;knar man med att antalet abonnenter raskt kommer att &ouml;ka. <P>

<B>Anslutningar till f&aring;manskontor</B><BR>
ABB Fl&auml;kts 3v&auml;derstrecksbolag2 och ABB Installation &auml;r exempel p&aring; bolag som har p&aring;b&ouml;rjat anslutningar via ISDN f&ouml;r sina f&aring;manskontor runt om i landet. I takt med att efterfr&aring;gan &ouml;kar kommar ABB Infosystems att ut&ouml;ka antalet ISDN-noder i Sverigen&auml;tet. <P>

ABB Industrial Systems har valt ABB Infosystems som samarbetspartner och integrator vid inf&ouml;randet av standardsystemet SAP R/3 fr&aring;n Tyskland. Easy Flow &auml;r ben&auml;mningen p&aring; inf&ouml;randeprojektet som kommer att fortg&aring; under tv&aring; till tre &aring;r.<P>

S&aring; &auml;r det dags &auml;ven f&ouml;r ABB Industrial Systems att l&auml;mna AROS-milj&ouml;n. Funktioner som order hantering, ink&ouml;p, konstruktion, tillverkning, ekonomi, fakturering, logistik osv som idag hanteras i stordatormilj&ouml;n ska flyta l&auml;ttare i en flexibel client/server-milj&ouml;.   
- SAP R/3 &auml;r ett modernt verktyg som ska bidra till att f&ouml;rb&auml;ttra v&aring;ra aff&auml;rsprocesser i v&aring;r str&auml;van att erbjuda v&aring;ra kunder totall&ouml;sningar i v&auml;rldsklass. Vart val av ABB Infosystems som samarbetspartner ger oss goda f&ouml;ruts&auml;ttningar att, med gemensamma resurser framg&aring;ngsrikt genomf&ouml;ra projektet, s&auml;ger Lars Linde, VD hos ABB Industrial Systems. <P> 

Efter omfattande utv&auml;rdering har SAP R/3 valts som grundsystem f&ouml;r st&ouml;d &aring;t bolagets verksamheter inom anl&auml;ggning, utveckling, produktion, f&ouml;rs&auml;ljning, ekonomistyrning och kvalitetsuppf&ouml;ljning. Systemet ska inf&ouml;ras p&aring; ABB Industrial Systems samtliga sju divisioner pa tio platser i Sverige. Ordersumman &auml;r 40 miljoner kronor och avser ett total&aring;tagande d&auml;r ABB Infosystems svarar f&ouml;r inf&ouml;rande och utbildning av SAP R/3. Avtalet omfattar licenser f&ouml;r 1.500 anv&auml;ndare j&auml;mte under h&aring;llsavtal under fyra &aring;r. 
Leveransavtalet inneh&aring;ller &auml;ven en option f&ouml;r ABB Industrial Systems att best&auml;lla drift av det nya systemet hos ABB Infosystems under projekttiden och d&auml;refter i ytterligare tv&aring; &aring;r. Denna option motsvarar ett ber&auml;knat orderv&auml;rde p&aring; drygt 10 miljoner kronor. Inom ABB Industrial Systems p&aring;g&aring;r flera projekt med T50 - och verksamhetsutvecklingspr&auml;gel och med SAP R/3 vill man etablera systemst&ouml;d f&ouml;r dessa projekt. N&aring;gra m&aring;l &auml;r att effektivisera och &ouml;ka automatiseringen av orderhantering och tillverkning samt att h&ouml;ja kvaliteten i anl&auml;ggningsprojektens hantering och uppf&ouml;ljning. <P>

SAP R/3 &auml;r ett flexibelt verktyg som st&ouml;der f&ouml;renklade arbetss&auml;tt och underl&auml;ttar kommande f&ouml;r&auml;ndringar i verksamheten. En viktig del i partnerskapet med ABB Industrial Systems &auml;r att Kjell Gustafsson i ABB Infosystems f&ouml;retagsledning tar anst&auml;llning som projektledare hos ABB Industrial Systems. ABB Infosystems sluter &auml;ven avtal med underleverant&ouml;rerna SAP Svenska AB och Management Application Support som har fler&aring;rig erfarenhet av SAP R/3.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Pilotprojekten g&ouml;r positiva erfarenheter</B></FONT>
<HR><BR>

Pilotprojekten f&ouml;r inf&ouml;rande av EVITA-konceptet och presentationsst&ouml;dsystemet inom ABB Control och ABB Coiltech b&ouml;rjar nu summera sina erfarenheter och fundera &ouml;ver hur man ska g&aring; vidare.<P>

Inom ABB Control var redovisningsavdelningen, tv&aring; produktionsenheter samt exportf&ouml;rs&auml;ljningsavdelningen pionj&auml;rer i EVITA h&ouml;sten 1995. Sedan dess har konceptet successivt inf&ouml;rts p&aring; avdelningarna f&ouml;r administrativ utveckling, svensk f&ouml;rs&auml;ljning samt personal. EVITA Presentationsst&ouml;dsystem anv&auml;nds inom administrativa grupper medan man f&ouml;r produktionsrelaterade grupper utvecklat en egen l&ouml;sning som kombinerar EVITA-konceptet med traditionell produktionsuppf&ouml;ljning. Hos ABB Coiltech har konceptet och EVITA Presentationst&ouml;dsystem inf&ouml;rts inom ett produktionsled samt inom personalavdelningen.<P>

<B>&Ouml;kat engagemang</B> <BR>
- EVITA-konceptet &auml;r helt perfekt och vi har beslutat att inf&ouml;ra det &ouml;ver hela ABB Control. Vi har dock &auml;nnu inte tagit st&auml;llning till hur vi vill g&ouml;ra med presentationsst&ouml;dsystemet. Klart &auml;r dock att det beh&ouml;vs n&aring;gon form av systemst&ouml;d f&ouml;r att h&aring;lla processen levande, s&auml;ger Birger Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m, ekonomichef hos ABB Control. En intervjuunders&ouml;kning har visat att EVITA har &ouml;kat engagemang och dialog inom ABB Control. Medarbetarna har en &ouml;kad medvetenhet och insikt om visioner och m&aring;l. Engagemanget i grupperna och dialogen mellan enheterna har &ouml;kat i och med arbetet med och framtagningen av EVITA-processen. EVITA har ocks&aring; resulterat i ett mer strukturerat f&ouml;r&auml;ndringsarbete tack vare perspektivsyns&auml;ttet samt skapat f&ouml;ruts&auml;ttningar f&ouml;r att g&aring; fr&aring;n ett kortsiktigt agerande till ett l&aring;ngsiktigt agerande. En upplevd positiv effekt &auml;r att medarbetarna k&auml;nner att de kan p&aring;verka den egna verksamhetens m&aring;l f&ouml;r f&ouml;r&auml;ndringsarbetet.<P>

<B>Viktigt st&ouml;d i strategiarbetet</B> <BR>
G&ouml;rel Ingebrigtsen, Asea Brown Boveri AB, har fungerat som l&auml;nk mellan ABB Infosystems och ABB Control och s&auml;kerst&auml;llt att generella och angel&auml;gna anv&auml;ndarsynpunkter inarbetats i EVITA Presentationsst&ouml;dsystem<BR>
. - Den aktuella versionen &auml;r v&auml;l genomtestad och inneh&aring;ller den n&ouml;dv&auml;ndiga funktionaliteten f&ouml;r att systemet p&aring; ett smidigt s&auml;tt ska vara ett st&ouml;d f&ouml;r att f&ouml;lja verksamheten mot uppsatta m&aring;l, s&auml;ger G&ouml;rel Ingebrigtsen. Hos ABB Coiltech har B&ouml;rje Natanaelsson, produktionsledare f&ouml;r enheten Batteri-kroppar med 60 medarbetare, med bist&aring;nd av verksamhets-konsult Karin Netzler fr&aring;n ABB Infosystems, ansvarat f&ouml;r EVITA-konceptets inf&ouml;rande inom sina tre m&aring;lstyrda grupper. B&ouml;rje Natanaelsson har &auml;ven anv&auml;nt sig av presentationsst&ouml;dsystemet under b&aring;de strategiarbete och senare uppf&ouml;ljningar. <BR>
- Presentationsst&ouml;dsystemet har varit ett viktigt st&ouml;d sj&auml;lva strategiarbetet och hj&auml;lpt oss att strukturera upp det, s&auml;ger B&ouml;rje Natanaelsson. Genom EVITA f&aring;r vi en enhetlig presentationsmodell f&ouml;r alla m&aring;lstyrda grupper st&auml;llet f&ouml;r att ha ett antal olika modeller som inte talar riktigt samma spr&aring;k. Det &auml;r ocks&aring; l&auml;ttare att f&ouml;lja upp resultat och f&ouml;rst&aring; helheten j&auml;mf&ouml;rt med tidigare m&auml;tsystem som presenteras i pappersform p&aring; anslagstavlan. Systemet hj&auml;lper oss i f&ouml;r&auml;ndringsarbetet med att lokalisera framg&aring;ngs-faktorer och finna nya m&auml;tetal. F&ouml;r medarbetarperspektivet har systemet t ex bidragit till att vi snabbt och enkelt kunnat se vilken effekt det ger i resultatet om en medarbetare slutar samt vilka kompetenser vi beh&ouml;ver ers&auml;tta. <BR>
- Systemet ger ocks&aring; den effekten att vi hela tiden har v&aring;ra visioner och m&aring;l i fokus. Allt finns d&auml;r, samlat p&aring; ett l&auml;ttillg&auml;ngligt s&auml;tt. Utan presentationsst&ouml;dsystemet &auml;r det sv&aring;rt att h&aring;lla processen levande. Inom ABB Coiltech har man &auml;nnu inte tagit n&aring;got formellt beslut om att inf&ouml;ra EVITA &ouml;ver hela f&ouml;retaget. F&ouml;retaget har redan ett m&auml;tsystem p&aring; papper. &Auml;n s&aring; l&auml;nge avvaktar man hela kostnadsbilden. Man g&aring;r dock f&ouml;rsiktigt vi-dare med att inf&ouml;ra b&aring;de koncept och system p&aring; den andra produktionsenheten samt inom avdelningen f&ouml;r Beredning och Konstruktion.

<BR>

ABB Infosystems kan nu presentera sin f&ouml;rste IT-revisor inom datas&auml;kerhet. Tomas Forsberg &auml;r sedan september 1996 certifierad som CISA-revisor (Certified Information Systems Auditor) enligt den amerikanska revisionsstandard som tagits fram av ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association). Examineringen pr&ouml;var kompetens, revisionsetik, erfarenhet och kr&auml;ver fortl&ouml;pande utbildning f&ouml;r att f&ouml;rnyas. I hela v&auml;rlden finns ca 10 000 CISA-certifierade IT-revisorer varav ett hundratal i Sverige.<P> 

IT-revision enligt ISACA kr&auml;vs idag inom banker och f&ouml;rs&auml;kringsbolag d&auml;r h&ouml;ga krav st&auml;lls p&aring; kvalitet och s&auml;kerhet. &Auml;ven inom industrin blir dessa fr&aring;gor alltmer viktiga, inte minst med tanke p&aring; Internetutvecklingen.<BR>
ABB Infosystems kan g&ouml;ra en samlad IT-revision omfattande ett f&ouml;retags hela anv&auml;ndning av IT. Revisionen omfattar ekonomi, kvalitet, konkurrensf&ouml;rdelar och s&auml;kerhet. Basen f&ouml;r revisionen &auml;r en allm&auml;nt erk&auml;nd standard f&ouml;r IT-framtagning som heter COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology). Den bygger bl a p&aring; teknisk standard (ISO, Edifact), regler f&ouml;r upptr&auml;dande (OECD, ISACA), kvalitetsstandard (ITSEC, ISO9000, TCSEC), revisionsstandard ( t ex GAO, IFAC), industripraxis (t ex ESF - European Security Forum). Enligt COBIT granskas alla delar av ett f&ouml;retags anv&auml;ndning av IT inklusive utvecklingsplaner, projektledning, programmering och utvecklingsarbete samt levererade program och f&auml;rdiga system.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Nytt arbetsstt med Consensus ger </B><BR>
<B>bidrag i vrldsklass</B></FONT><HR>
<BR>

Mlet r att n vrldsklass. Vi har kommit en bra bit p vg och nu terstr att finslipa arbetssttet och fokusera p kvalitet. Vr kompetens r hg och det r bara genom att arbeta smartare som vi kan konkurrera, sger Magnus Jonasson, chef fr Produktdivisionen inom ABB Generation. Produktdivisionen r ABB Generations tillverkande enhet. Det r hr all konstruktion, tillverkning, montage och idrifttagning av generatorerna sker.
<P>
Konkurrensen frn andra generatortillverkare r hrd. De senaste ren har priserna fallit med 30 procent och det gller att arbeta smartare fr att snka kostnaderna i processen och drmed kunna stta konkurrenskraftiga priser. En vattenkraftsgenerator har ca ett rs genomloppstid  frn order till leverans varav 30 procent enbart fr konstruktion och produktionsadministration. Med std av Consensus ska arbetsuppgifterna integreras och den orderbundna tiden halveras i Produktdivisionens mlstyrda komponentfldesgrupper.<BR>
 IT-verktyg som Consensus bidrar i avsevrd omfattning till att n vra ml. Vi har bl a redan kunnat snka antalet ingenjrstimmar p ngra komponenter, men det terstr mycket arbete fr att n mlet  en halvering av tiderna fr samtliga komponenter i en generator, sger Magnus Jonasson.
<P>

<B>Bakomliggande std</B><BR>
Men det r inte bara Consensus i sig, utan ven det bakomliggande std som ABB Infosystems givit i form av verksamhetskonsultationer samt ABB Generations utveckling av produktmodeller, som ger bidrag till processen.
Produktmodeller r ett nyckelord i ABB Generations framtida generatorsatsningar. Tanken r att varje strre komponent, t ex rotor och stator, som ingr i en generator, ska tas fram med en produktmodell dr frberedelsegraden r s lngt driven som mjligt. Varje modell beskrivs i srskilda koncept i Consensus som hller ordning p ritningar, valtabeller, listor och reglerna fr orderbehandlingen enligt det nya arbetsttet. Genom att p detta stt anvnda frberedda lsningar i Consensus kan sedan den mlstyrda komponentfldesgruppen i verkstaden sjlva ta fram det tillverkningsunderlag som de behver. ABB Infosystems ger ABB Generation kontinuerligt std i konceptbyggandet.<BR>
 Vr utveckling av produktmodeller ger oss ett stt att arbeta smartare p, sger Magnus Jonasson. Genom att arbeta med produktmodeller av komponenter i frdiga koncept i Consensus sparar vi ytterligare arbetstimmar och snker vra kostnader samtidigt som vi hjer kvaliteten p konstruktionsarbetet. Vi kan teranvnda redan gjorda konstruktioner och behver inte mata in samma data flera gnger om.
<P>
<B>Fakta om Consensus</B><BR>
<LI>Consensus r en komplett konstruktionsarbetsplats som kombinerar vl beprvad konstruktionssystematik med Cad-system, kontorsapplikationer mm.
<LI>Consensus ger mjlighet att framstlla och hantera alla dokument och ritningar i produkt- och orderfldet frn id och produktutveckling via orderbunden konstruktion och leverans till kunddokumentation, drift, underhll och slutlig avveckling.
<LI>Consensus uppfyller kraven som stlls p ett modernt PDM-system (Product Data Management) med funktionalitet som passar bde inom produkt- och anlggningskonstruktion. Consensus ger std fr dokumentstyrning enligt ISO 9001.
<LI>Multistrukturhantering i Consensus ger speciella mjligheter att arbeta parallellt med olika delar av samma projekt, s k Concurrent Engineering.
<LI>Consensus Koncepthantering ger mjlighet att automatisera orderbunden konstruktion med olika grad av frberedda lsningar.

<BR>

Stimulerande, intressant, och trevligt, sger Jan Brink, redovisningschef  inom Sdra Cell och Jonas Franzn, controller hos AB Klippan Finpappersbruk, om symposiet.<BR>
 Stimulerande eftersom vi nu kan vara skra p att MERITekonomi kommer att fortstta utvecklas i samma positiva anda som tidigare. Med en kompetent gare som r lika angelgen som vi, att systemet ska frbli ett exklusivt standardsystem p ekonomiomrdet lngt in p 2000-talet, sger Jan Brink vidare.<BR>
 Det vi har sett idag r definitivt ett steg i rtt riktning. Det r mycket positivt att det hnder ngot med MERITekonomi, fyller Jonas Franzn i.<BR>
Trevligt har det ocks varit, och intressant att f lra knna ABB Infosystems bttre tycker de bda. Ett mycket bra symposium. Omdmena om detta elfte symposium i MERITekonomi anvndarfrenings regi kunde knappast bli mer positiva.<BR>
 Synd bara att det genomfrdes under en sdan tidpunkt nr mnga av oss ekonomer har fullt upp med budgetarbete. Vi brukar vara betydligt fler under dessa trffar, sger Jan Brink. Men jag rknar med att de som inte kunnat komma fr ta del av innehllet p annat stt.
<P>
<B>Tidigare AvantGarde</B><BR>
MERITekonomi hette tidigare AvantGarde och hr till det systempaket som ingr i den portflj ABB Infosystems vertog i samband med kpet av Sdra Data april 1996. I samband med garbytet har systemet dpts om fr att markera samhrigheten med de vriga systemen i paketet  MERIT Underhll och MERIT OLFI (Order, Lager, Fakturering, Inkp). Tillsammans bildar de ett komplett standardpaket fr administrativ informationsbehandling. 
MERITekonomi togs fram i slutet av 70-talet som ett online-system i distribuerad datamilj. Under rens lopp har det, mycket tack vare sina engagerade anvndare, stadigt utvecklats i takt med den ekonomiska verksamhetens krav. Idag anvnds systemet i 25 installationer hos bolag i skilda verksamheter inom industri och tjnsteproduktion. Klippan, Sdra Cell, Nitro Nobel, Bulten Produktion,  Ericsson Components och rebro Lantmn r bara ngra exempel p anvndare.
<P>
<B>"Enkelt att anvnda"</B><BR>
 MERITekonomi r i grunden stabilt, funktionellt och enkelt att anvnda, sger Jonas Franzn.<BR>
 Med de nya funktionerna fr rapportframtagning och mjligheter att flytta data till och frn andra system har vi ftt ett nnu flexiblare instrument fr att gra ekonomiska analyser. Som controller vill jag ha mjlighet att vrida och vnda p data efter mina behov och kunna sammanstlla samt presentera informationen p ett verskdligt stt. ABB Infosystems har ocks lagt grunden till ett helt nytt grafiskt grnssnitt som gr det n mer lttanvnt och modernt. MERITekonomi har blivit ett mycket intressantare system, slutar Jonas Franzn.<BR>
 Vi gr nu vidare med ytterligare utvecklingssteg och bidrar med ett rs underhllsverskott i finansieringen av det fortsatta arbetet. Med ABB Infosystems som en stark och kompetent gare knner vi stor tilltro till systemets framtid. Vi hoppas ocks att systemet fr flera nya kunder eftersom det gagnar dess utveckling som standardsystem genom tillfrsel av nya ider. Med fler som delar p utvecklingskostnaderna blir systemet ocks lnsammare fr bde kunder och gare, avslutar Jan Brink.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Ny uppbyggnad av Lotus Notes </B><BR>
<B>ger bttre effektivitet</B></FONT><HR>
<BR>

Lotus Notes r mycket mer n ett ovanligt smidigt mail-system. Det r ett kraftfullt verktyg fr affrsverksamhet ver grnserna  det anvnds fr att utveckla tillmpningar som underlttar samarbetet i olika projekt. Produktutveckling, kundservice, projektstd, redovisning och underhllsplanering r bara ngra exempel p vad Lotus Notes kan anvndas till.<BR>
Idag har mnga ABB-bolag sin egen Lotus Notes-domn, som underhlls lokalt. Det krver mnga arbetstimmar och mnga administratrer, och det r svrt att f en total verblick ver strukturen och ver den utveckling som sker runtom i vrlden.
<P>

<B>Mnga domner blir en enda</B><BR>
Nu freslr en utredning att drifttjnsten fr Lotus Notes ska effektiviseras och frenklas inom hela svenska ABB. I korthet gr frslaget ut p att man erstter alla Lotus Notes-domner med en enda, som drivs i form av insourcing av ABB Infosystems.<BR>
I Norge, Portugal, Spanien och alla lnder i Asien har omfattande nationella domner redan installerats. Mnga andra lnder har lagt grunden till ett sdant hr koncept, bland andra Schweiz, Tyskland, USA, Finland och Danmark.
<P>
Utredningen pekar p en rad frdelar, som fljer med en omorganisation av driften fr Lotus Notes. Tillgngligheten blir bttre, driften blir skrare, servicegraden blir hgre, och utvecklingsarbetet blir effektivare. Dessutom sjunker driftskostnaderna, eftersom frre och mer specialiserade administratrer blir engagerade.
Tanken r att ABB Infosystems ska ta ansvaret fr driften av den svenska domnen med hgt specialiserade administratrer. Det 40-tal Lotus Notes-specialister, som knyts till domnen, har alla de resurser som behvs fr att sttta anvndarna med bland annat drift, installation, support, utbildning, applikationsutveckling och Internet-std.
Summan av kardemumman blir allts skrare och snabbare informationsverfring med hgklassig support, till lgre kostnader.
<P>

<B>Ett 50-tal servrar lnkade till ett nav</B><BR>
Den svenska Lotus Notes-trafiken gr idag via ett 50-tal servrar, de flesta i Vsters. Alla r lnkade till en Hub (ett "nav", som r spindeln i det elektroniska ntet). Den svenska Huben r i sin tur kopplad till Hubar i andra delar av vrlden, s att alla de drygt 11.000 svenska anvndarna kan kommunicera jorden runt. Av dessa 11.000 administreras idag 5.000 av ABB Infosystems.
<P>
Det r vl frberett fr fler Lotus Notes-anvndare  ytterligare 10 000 fr plats i ABB Infosystems nt, och nr det r fullt, gr det att bygga ut med fler servrar.<BR>
Lotus Notes-ntet vervakas dygnet runt av program, som slr larm nr ngot onormalt hnder. Ofta fr specialisterna p ABB Infosystems s tidiga indikationer, att ett fel kan rttas till innan det intrffar.
Tillgngligheten i Lotus Notes r mycket hg. ABB Infosystems garanterar en tillgnglighet av 99,7 procent under kontorstid, 99,5 vrig tid. 
<P>
<B>Problemlsare p Kundtjnst</B><BR>
Mnga kontakter som rr Lotus Notes sker via ABB Infosystems Kundtjnst  de fr varje dag mellan 50 och 60 samtal frn anvndare, som stller frgor om allt som har med Lotus Notes att gra. I de flesta fall handlar det om mail-funktioner eller hur man gr fr att komma t informationen i olika databaser. Anvndarens egen namn- och adressbok r ett annat problemomrde, som ofta dyker upp.
<P>
Kundtjnst lser mnga anvndarfrgor direkt per telefon, mer komplicerade frgor som krver expertkunskap slussas vidare till tjnstespecialisterna i ABB Infosystems Notes-grupp.<BR>
Kundtjnst svarar p anvndarfrgor under kontorstid. Skulle problem uppst under annan tid finns alltid mjlighet att rapportera till Kundtjnst, som registrerar problemet fr tgrd nsta dag.
<P>
Det finns ett enkelt stt att sjlv lsa problem i Lotus Notes utan att kontakta Kundtjnst. Boken Notes Anvndarhandledning r en praktisk handledning, som reder ut de vanligaste frgorna angende Lotus Notes. Boken kostar 100 kronor och kan bestllas frn Kundtjnst i Vsters, telefon 021-32 35 00, Notes: #CPYHelpDesk eller Huskvarna 036-17 12 55.

<BR>

Samarbete r ett nyckelord nr det gller Easy Flow. Hela krntruppen p ca trettio personer i projektet r samlad i IT-landskapet i det gamla "datahuset" p Lunda i Vsters.<BR>
- Det var ett viktigt villkor i projektbeskrivningen att projektgruppen fysiskt skulle sitta tillsammans i funktionella lokaler. Korta kommunikationsvgar r en ndvndig frutsttning, sger Kjell Gustafsson, ABB Industrial Systems projektledare fr Easy Flow. 
<P>
En prototyp har nyligen frdigstllts i standardpaketet SAP R/3 och projektgruppen kan med tillfredsstllelse konstatera att den i allt vsentligt fungerar enligt planerna. <BR>
- Vi har sjsatt en verklighetsbaserad order i systemet, sger Kjell Gustafsson. Testordern avser ett anlggningsprojekt och fljer anlggnings- och produktleveransprocesserna samt involverar tv av vra divisioner. Med denna prototyp testar vi den funktionalitet vi hittills byggt in i systemet fr att se hur det fungerar i praktiken och fngar upp problem. Cirka 70 procent av den totala funktionaliteten ska vara med i prototypen.
<P>
<B>Fakta om SAP R/3</B><BR>
SAP R/3 r ett ppet moduluppbyggt system i client/server-milj. Fler n 800 processer fr bl a order, logistik, produktion, projektstyrning, underhllsplanering, ekonomi och personalhantering r frdefinierade i systemet.
Alla moduler r integrerade med varandra i realtid. Nr frndringar i verksamhet eller organisation intrffar kan systemet anpassas via en uppsttning styrparametrar.
<P>
Bassystemet innehller databaser, utvecklingsverktyg och grnssnitt till operativ- och terminalsystem. Till bassystemet kopplas ett valfritt antal funktionsmoduler:
<LI>Projektplanering/Projektstyrning
<LI>Produktionsstyrning
<LI>Inkp/Materialstyrning 
<LI>Order/Distribution/Fakturering
<LI>Extern redovisning
<LI>Intern redovisning
<LI>Anlggningsredovisning
<LI>Kvalitet
<LI>Personalhantering
<LI> Underhll av anlggning
<P>
SAP R/3 r vl frberett fr modern kommunikation. Med direktkoppling till Internet kan systemet anvndas fr elektronisk handel, service och kundinformation. Frdefinierade grnssnitt finns fr scanning och EDI.
<P>
<B>Arbetsgrupperna motsvarar modulerna</B><BR>
 Indelningen i arbetsgrupper fr huvudfunktionerna orderhantering, materialhantering/inkp, tillverkning, projekthantering och ekonomi motsvarar R/3s moduler. I dessa gr vi igenom och infr arbetssttet i systemet, sger Kjell Gustafsson. Hur ska vi registrera en order, hur ska vi planera materialhantering och hur ska inkp g till osv.<BR>
Varje vecka mts "antal icke pbrjade aktiviteter", "antal pbrjade aktiviteter" samt "antal frdiga aktiviteter" i en grafisk modell. En annan modell r mer problemorienterad och visar hur mnga stora ppna frgor som finns att bearbeta, antalet olsta frgor och vilka frgor som str nrmast i tur att lsas. 
 Varefter problemstllningarna r lsta bockar vi av dem och ser hur bilden frndras ver tiden. Tillsammans med aktivitetsmtningarna fr vi en lttverskdlig visuell information ver projektets framskridande, sger Kjell Gustafsson.

<B>IT-optimismen</B><P>

Informationstekniken skapar nya mjligheter och nya verktyg fr att utveckla verksamheter, konkurrensfrdelar och globala samarbeten. Informationsteknik r idag etablerad i alla delar av samhllet och r en ny och viktig infrastruktur. Det r ltt att bli fr optimistisk. <BR>
<dd>Optimismen r kanske en av svagheterna. Den nya informationsstrukturen innebr att mer och mer av information blir digital, tillgngligheten kar och informationsnten vxer globalt. Optimisten hnrycks ver detta, men frbiser ofta den kade srbarheten. Viktiga och knsliga data har ftt kopplingar ut mot en oknd vrld. Ett lsenord rcker inte som skydd.<P>

<B>Glm din bild av hackern <BR>
som en dataintresserad skolpojke</B><P>

Vad r det vrsta som kan hnda dina informationssystem? En datakrash, ingen backup, ett virusangrepp, en eldsvda eller ett otillbrligt intrng utifrn? Vilka r konsekvenserna? <dd>Varje dygn genomfrs ett stort antal frsk att ta sig in i fretags och myndigheters datasystem. Det r inte skolungar som leker. Hackers/crackers r vlorganiserade, oftast med
ett brottsligt frflutet som mlmedvetet arbetar med industrispionage, ekonomiska brott och sabotage.<P>

<B>IT och skerheten</B><P>

Vi fresprkar inte pessimism utan frsker vara realistiska och tar vra kunskaper och erfarenheter frn verkligheten. Dataskerhet r serist och ska alltid vara ekonomiskt frsvarbart. Insatserna ska st i proportion till den information och de system de ska skydda. Varken mer eller mindre. 
<dd>Dagens informationssamhlle frutstter att vi har frbindelser med omvrlden, fr samarbete, transaktioner mm. I en dligt byggd eller bristflligt underhllen frsvarsmur hittar angriparen alltid de svagaste fogarna. <BR>
<dd>ABB Infosystems grupp fr dataskerhet reder ut det abstrakta begreppet dataskerhet i konkreta termer, och hjlper till att bygga ett skydd med fungerande passagekontroller mot omvrlden.<P>

<HR>
<P>
Ingen kan undg att se i vilken grad fretagen ftt kade elektroniska kopplingar mot omvrlden. Samtidigt finns det idag ett behov att spara och undvika ondiga investeringar. Skerheten blir ltt ett omrde dr man inte vill investera just nu.
<dd>Detta r en farlig instllning, srbarheten har kat och grs inga investeringar i skerheten, s urholkas det skydd man hade fr bara ngra r sedan till nrmast ingenting. 
<P>
Vi ser som vr uppgift att vara effektiva nr det gller att skydda fretagen, bde nr det gller teknik, metodik och ekonomi. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><li>Vi ligger i teknikens framkant bde nr det gller att kunna bryta sig in i datasystem och att skydda dem. 
<li>Vi granskar vra kunders skerhet enligt erknd metodik och IT-revisionsstandard. 
<li>Vi upprttar en budget ver kundens skerhetskostnader och visar vad varje element i skerheten kostar. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Vi ser alla dessa element som ndvndiga, det gr inte lngre att slja datorskerhet och samtidigt frbise antingen tekniken, metodiken eller ekonomin. Det gr inte heller att vara svagare p ngon punkt, fr d kommer kundens skerhet ocks att halta p samma stt. 
<P>
<B>Tala med skerhetskonsulterna</B><P>

Allt frndras snabbt. Det som gllde inom dataskerhet fr ngra r sedan, gller inte idag. Precis som inom resten av informationstekniken.
<dd>I takt med att tekniken och informationsfldena ndras, bildas ocks nya svagheter.
<dd>Vrt jobb r att skapa avancerade skerhetslsningar och samtidigt ga kunskapen om vad som hnder i "fiendens lger". ABB Infosystems skerhetsgrupps uppgift r att bemta det kade kravet p IT-skerhet. 
Vi arbetar med IT-revisionsteknik, skerhet i stora ntverk och teknisk datorskerhet.

<FONT SIZE=+2>Skydda webservern mot angrepp</FONT>
<HR>
<P>
<P>Ett antal h&auml;ndelser har visat hur en angripare kan &auml;ndra inneh&aring;llet
i en webserver. Vad kan man g&ouml;ra f&ouml;r att skydda sig?&nbsp;&Auml;r
det ens m&ouml;jligt, alla s&auml;ger att den som verkligen vill tar sig
&auml;nd&aring; in?</P>

<P>Det &auml;r m&ouml;jligt att skydda sin server med relativt enkla medel.</P>

<UL>
<LI>&Ouml;ppna minsta m&ouml;jliga antal tj&auml;nster och portnummer</LI>

<LI>L&auml;gg webservern p&aring; ett eget firewall segment</LI>

<LI>Anv&auml;nd kommersiell och v&auml;l bepr&ouml;vad programvara</LI>

<LI>L&aring;t inte servern ha n&aring;gon annan uppgift, undvik s.k. &quot;kompletta
Internetservrar&quot;</LI>

<LI>Undvik helst all anv&auml;ndning av cgi-bin script</LI>

<LI>Om scripts &auml;nd&aring; m&aring;ste anv&auml;ndas, till&aring;t
inga kommandotolkar (typ perl, perl.exe) i cgi-bin katalogen</LI>

<LI>Till&aring;t ej g&auml;stb&ouml;cker eller diskussionsareor som kan
l&auml;gga in HTML&nbsp;kod</LI>

<LI>Till&aring;t inga scripts som k&ouml;rs n&auml;r en websida presenteras,
typ r&auml;knare osv.</LI>

<LI>Anv&auml;nd helst bara tillf&auml;lliga skrivtillst&aring;nd p&aring;
webserverns filutrymme</LI>

<LI>Begr&auml;nsa webprogrammets r&auml;ttigheter i filsystemet s&aring;
l&aring;ngt det g&aring;r </LI>

<LI>Till&aring;t ingen uppladdning &ouml;ver Internet av filer eller data
via ftp eller http PUT</LI>

<LI>Avinstallera nfs fr&aring;n webservern</LI>

<LI>Bjud inte p&aring; information, typ anv&auml;ndarstatistik, inloggade
anv&auml;ndare eller motsvarande</LI>

<LI>Ta bort on&ouml;diga program och funktioner, det g&aring;r ofta att
bryta sig in i en fabrikslevererad dator</LI>

<LI>H&aring;ll en saklig profil p&aring; allt inneh&aring;ll i webservern
och inbjud inte till angrepp</LI>
</UL>

<P>Vidta alla normala f&ouml;rsiktighets&aring;tg&auml;rder och anv&auml;nda
starka l&ouml;senord med blandade stora och sm&aring; bokst&auml;ver samt
siffror. Observera att firewall eller routerskyddet &auml;r felkonfigurerat
om man kan n&aring; tj&auml;nster som nfs eller tj&auml;nster som kr&auml;ver
l&ouml;senord fr&aring;n Internet. L&ouml;senorden &auml;r bara ett skydd
mot anv&auml;ndare inom det egna f&ouml;retaget.</P>

<H3>F&ouml;rst&aring; hur angriparen arbetar</H3>

<P>En angripare f&ouml;ljer oftast kokboksrecept f&ouml;r att bryta sig
in, lyckas han inte med dessa &auml;r sannolikheten stor att han v&auml;ljer
ett annat m&aring;l. F&ouml;rst h&auml;mtar angriparen information om vilka
portar och tj&auml;nster som &auml;r &ouml;ppna, vilka maskiner som ligger
p&aring; samma n&auml;tsegment som servern, vilka programvaror som anv&auml;nds
och hur dessa &auml;r konfigurerade.</P>

<P>Angripare l&auml;ser ocks&aring; alla filer han n&aring;r i servern,
b&aring;de genom l&auml;nkar i websidor och genom att lista inneh&aring;llet
i kataloger. Han f&ouml;rs&ouml;ker &auml;ven p&aring; olika s&auml;tt
l&auml;sa filer med k&auml;nda eller l&auml;tt gissade namn, d&auml;ribland
olika konfigurationsfiler, script-filer och systemfiler. Han provar om
han via anonym ftp har skriv eller l&auml;stillst&aring;nd p&aring; webserverns
filsystem eller om han via cgi-bin script kan anropa n&aring;gon kommandotolk.</P>

<P>D&auml;refter s&ouml;ker angriparen efter kokboksrecept f&ouml;r de
programvaror han identifierat, dessa kan best&aring; av att man utnyttjar
buggar eller vanliga konfigurationsfel i serverprogram, cgi-bin script,
ftp eller smtp program. De flesta av dessa program svarar alltid med versionsnummer,
antingen vid uppkopplingen eller n&auml;r de f&aring;r ett kommando de
inte kan tolka.</P>

<P>I&nbsp;en sista fas kan angriparen s&auml;tta upp samma program i en
egen dator och j&auml;mf&ouml;ra konfigurationerna med hj&auml;lp av olika
tester. Ett exempel &auml;r att man f&ouml;rs&ouml;ker utf&ouml;ra ett
PUT&nbsp;kommando och ser vilket felmeddelande man f&aring;r - &quot;du
saknar beh&ouml;righet&quot;&nbsp;eller &quot;metoden &auml;r ej definierad&quot;.
P&aring; s&aring; s&auml;tt kan angriparen stegvis pussla ihop en korrekt
bild av den maskin han vill angripa.</P>

<P>Det &auml;r viktigt att inse att angriparen genom Internet har stora
resurser till sitt f&ouml;rfogande, han disponerar &ouml;ver att flertal hackerdatabaser
med kokboksmetoder, han kan g&ouml;ra s&ouml;kningar p&aring; nyckelord
och han kan h&auml;mta r&aring;d &ouml;ver IRC&nbsp;kanaler. Han har ocks&aring;
tid och intresse f&ouml;r det han vill g&ouml;ra.</P>

<H3>Hur vanligt &auml;r det med angrepp</H3>

<P>Intr&aring;ng i datorer rapporteras s&auml;llan, vilket medf&ouml;r
att m&ouml;rkertalet &auml;r stort. Bara de mer uppm&auml;rksammade intr&aring;ngen
resulterar i att en bild p&aring; den &auml;ndrade hemsidan sprids p&aring;
n&auml;tet. Den b&auml;sta uppskattningen p&aring; riskniv&aring;n &auml;r
d&auml;rf&ouml;r antalet angrepp som kan observeras i loggarna p&aring;
v&auml;lsk&ouml;tta webservrar. En f&ouml;rsiktig bed&ouml;mning kan vara
allt mellan ett intr&aring;ngsf&ouml;rs&ouml;k i m&aring;naden till ett
par f&ouml;rs&ouml;k i veckan. Trenden &auml;r att antalet &ouml;kar.</P>

<P>Man kan j&auml;mf&ouml;ra med antalet anrop till en newsserver som inte
till&aring;ter publik access, i v&aring;rt fall sker mellan 20 och 50 s&aring;dana
anrop per dag. Detta tal ger en uppfattning om antalet personer som har
f&ouml;rm&aring;ga att sortera fram listor &ouml;ver m&ouml;jliga maskiner
och systematiskt s&ouml;ka igenom dessa.</P>

<H3>Vad g&ouml;r man om ett angrepp lyckats</H3>

<P>Det b&auml;sta &auml;r att f&ouml;lja ordinarie rutiner inom f&ouml;retaget
och l&aring;ta den pressansvarige besvara fr&aring;gor. Till&aring;t inga
tekniker att besvara fr&aring;gor eller f&ouml;ra diskussioner i &auml;mnet
p&aring; Internet. G&ouml;r upp detta i f&ouml;rv&auml;g s&aring; att tekniker,
webmaster och informationsavdelning vet sina roller.</P>

<P>F&ouml;ruts&auml;tt alltid att angriparen l&auml;mnat en eller flera
bakd&ouml;rrar efter sig, nyinstallera d&auml;rf&ouml;r operativsystem
och serverprogramvara. Byt alla l&ouml;senord, &auml;gde angreppet rum
i en unixmaskin s&aring; har angriparen troligen tagit en kopia av den
gamla l&ouml;senordsfilen.</P>

<P>Anm&auml;l det intr&auml;ffade. F&ouml;rs&ouml;k att ytterligare &ouml;ka
s&auml;kerheten stegvis, flytta servern till ett eget n&auml;tsegment.
L&aring;t erfaret s&auml;kerhetsfolk g&aring; igenom konfigurationen, uppenbarligen
hade den egna personalen missat n&aring;got och det &auml;r os&auml;kert
om de under press kan t&auml;ppa till s&auml;kerhetsbristen.</P>

<P>Se &ouml;ver router konfigurationer, firewallmaskinen och &ouml;vriga
servrar med Internetrelaterade funktioner, angreppet kan ha varit m&ouml;jligt
p&aring; grund av en brist i omgivningen.</P>

<H3>N&auml;r ska man kontakta s&auml;kerhetskonsulterna?</H3>

<P>Man b&ouml;r kontakta erfaret s&auml;kerhetsfolk innan man anv&auml;nder
sin webserver f&ouml;r aff&auml;rsverksamhet. I&nbsp;dessa fall b&ouml;r
man se sin webserver som ett ekonomisystem, med de krav p&aring; granskning
som st&auml;lls p&aring; s&aring;dana.</P>

<P>Man b&ouml;r ocks&aring; kontakta erfaret s&auml;kerhetsfolk innan man
l&auml;gger en webserver innanf&ouml;r sin firewall eller l&aring;ter sin
webserver h&auml;mta information eller f&ouml;rmedla transaktioner till
system inne i f&ouml;retaget.</P>

<HR>
<P>
Det finns inga hundraprocentiga skydd. Olyckor och haverier kan alltid hnda beroende p bde mnniskor och maskiner och man kan vara mer eller mindre skyddad. Med ABB Infosystems skerhetsrevision fr du veta var de svaga punkterna finns och konsekvenserna av dessa. Med en skerhetsrevision som grund kan man bygga upp skerheten till en ekonomiskt frsvarbar niv. En skerhetsrevision innebr att vi attackerar systemet, vi agerar "hackers" och anfaller, dock utan syfte att sabotera, men fr att lokalisera och tgrda brister.

Vid en skerhetsrevision undersker och testar vi skerheten efter ett antal kriterier, varefter en bedmning grs. Vid underskningen gr vi frst igenom dokumentation, och skerhetspolicy samt genomfr intervjuer. Drefter provas skerheten med hjlp av checklistor, manuella hackingtekniker, samt med maskinella program. Till std fr skerhetsrevisionen anvnder vi en accepterad <A HREF="itrev.html">IT-revisionsstandard</A>.

<FONT SIZE=+2>Fr att skerheten ska best, behvs en strategi </FONT>
<HR>
<P>
Fr att skerheten ska best i ett lngre perspektiv, behvs en skerhetspolicy som beskriver ansvarsfrdelningen och principer fr skerhetsarbetet inom det egna fretaget. Mnga tgrder riskerar annars att efter en tid ntas bort. Det r viktigt att ansvaret r klart frdelat, och att alla r medvetna om hur skerhetsstrategin ser ut. En skerhetspolicy r en garanti fr att skerheten ska fungera. Det r viktigt att policyn formuleras p rtt stt och anpassat fr respektive fretag, annars riskerar den att inte fungera.
<P>
Vi hjlper till att konstruera en fungerande skerhetspolicy fr fretaget samt praktiskt kontrollera hur den efterlevs. Som underlag fr policyn anvnds en allmnt accepterad standard som anpassas till fretagets organisation och ansvarsfrdelning. Vi hjlper till att gra policyn lagom stor och flexibel, vilket r en frutsttning fr att den ska fungera praktiskt.

Alla informationssystem frndras och utvecklas. Nya applikationer och nya erfarenheter tillkommer. Gamla uppgraderas och nya funktioner lggs till i takt med frndrade behov och verksamhetens utveckling. Det r ltt att frbise en viktig aspekt i utvecklingen.

<P>
ven om systemet inte sjlvt ndrats, s kar mngden information samt antalet datorer och anvndare. Nya kopplingar till andra system och Internet tillkommer, liksom utbyggnad av olika protokoll med ny funktionalitet. Nya versioner av program har mer och mer oprvade funktioner. Allt  detta gr att skerheten mste ses ver fr att kunna best. Vi hjlper till att se ver skerheten bde p regelbunden basis och nr strre frndringar grs, kanske i  samband med outsourcing eller systembyten.

Skerhetsprodukter r inte skra i sig sjlva. Konfigurering av skerhetsprodukter ger
mjligheter att skapa genvgar som tidigare inte var mjliga. I mnga fall har installation av skerhetsprodukter lett till att skerheten frsmrats istllet fr att frbttras, och gett anvndarna en skenbar skerhet. Det r viktigt nr man uppgraderar sin skerhet, att man gr det p rtt stt. <BR>
<dd>Vi hjlper till att implementera skyddet, vilket innebr att installera och konfigurera ndvndig hrdvara och mjukvara, ndra i befintliga rutiner samt lgga upp nya, dokumentera och utbilda.
<P>
Ett skerhetssystem r aldrig frdigt, utan mste alltid anpassas och dokumenteras
efter fretagets krav. Valmjligheterna r mnga och flera mjliga val kan vara helt
felaktiga i en viss situation. Mjligheterna r stora fr systemprogrammerare och
ntverksoperatrer att stadkomma en bekvm arbetsmilj dr de aldrig eller sllan
behver ge lsenord, men nd kan administrera sina system p stora avstnd. <BR>

Intrng i datasystem r en omfattande och vlorganiserad brottslighet. De flesta som flls fr dataintrng r kriminellt belastade.

Ett framgngsrikt angrepp fr alltid omfattande konsekvenser. Data frsvinner och frndras, affrshemligheter lnsas och systemet saboteras.

Listan p verkan kan gras lng. Det r kostsamt och tar lng tid att rekonstruera efter ett angrepp. Mnga fretag har strategiska data utan att vara medvetna om det. Vi kan upprtta ekonomiskt frsvarbara skydd som str i relation till den lagrade informationen.
<P>
I alla system finns det information som mste skyddas. Vi kontrollerar frst att det finns en riktig grund att st p. Ntverken och maskinerna ska ha en tillrcklig teknisk datorskerhet, vilket kontrolleras vid en <A HREF="sakrev.html">skerhetsrevision</A>.

Marknadsexponering kan i Internet sammanhang ha flera betydelser. Man kan mta sin nrvaro p Internet gentemot sina konkurrenter och jmfra marknad fr marknad hur antalet referenser i skmotorer och lnksidor vger till ngons frdel.
Man kan underska konkurrentens nrvaro i olika projekt och marknadssatsningar genom att ska lnkar och analysera dessa. Kunder och samarbetspartners stter ofta upp lnkar gentemot sina leverantrer.
<P>
Det r ocks vrdefullt att underska om det frekommer diskussioner kring fretagets produkter eller aktuella projekt p Internet. Ju tidigare man kan fnga upp diskussioner, desto lttare blir det att frbereda och frbttra sin egen information.

Kryptering r den skraste formen av IT-skerhet. All information ska inte vara allmnt tillgnglig. Viss information mste skyddas extra noga, t&nbsp;ex kritiska affrshandlingar och ekonomiska transaktioner som skickas via nt utanfr det egna fretaget. Att kryptera data r att skydda den frn lsning. Men all kryptering r lngtifrn sker. Vilken niv och vilka system som r lmpliga kan vra skerhetsexperter hjlpa till med, liksom de juridiska frgorna med olika lagar fr kryptering som gller i olika lnder.
<P>
Kryptoteknik r en avancerad vetenskap och det krvs kunskap fr att frst hur en kryptolsning ska anvndas fr att ge rtt skydd. Farorna r mnga, det finns gott om
 hemgjorda kryptosystem som inte ger ngot skydd vrt namnet. Andra kryptosystem r mycket goda, men kan anvndas p fel stt, antingen p grund av brister i nyckelhanteringen eller fr att de anvnds fr att kryptera olmpligt data. Vi hjlper till att finna starka lsningar, att anvnda kryptot p rtt stt och viktigast av allt - vi talar om lsningens begrnsningar.

Ett stt att frsvra angrepp r att minska p antalet funktioner i systemet. Vid installation av operationssystem medfljer ofta programvaror och serverfunktioner man egentligen inte behver. Genom att lyfta bort ondiga funktioner och tjnster optimeras skerheten. Vi kallar det fr att strippa systemet.
<P>
Vi hjlper till att se ver vilka komponenter som installeras i systemen och tar vid behov bort komponenter som r olmpliga ur skerhetssynpunkt. I vissa fall r det uppenbart att kritiska ekonomisystem inte ska ha kompilatorer och mailsystem aktiva eller ens installerade. I andra fall r det inte alls klart fr en oinvigd att en installerad komponent utgr en allvarlig fara fr skerheten eller p vilket stt funktionen kan missbrukas. <BR>
<dd>Strippningen kan ven omfatta komponenter i ett system, en knslig informationsserver ska exempelvis inte alltid ha alla moderna grnsnitt mot Internet installerade.

Att rka ut fr ett datavirus kan vara frdande. Det kan rcka med att ngon laddar hem en fil frn en databas eller att en okontrollerad diskett stts i en maskin. Ett virusangrepp kan snabbt sprida sig i ntverket. Det krvs en "doktor" att rensa ett system frn ett virusangrepp, en specialist som kan stlla diagnos och stta in rtt behandling. Det finns mnga "kvacksalvare" som stter in alla mjliga tgrder och rensar virus fr summor som inte r frsvarbara. S dyr och omfattande behver inte en riktig behandling bli om man vet vad man gr.
<P>
Virus r ett problem och lsningen r normalt enkel. Man skyddar sina anvndare genom installera ett virusskydd p varje dator, samtidigt som allt viktigt data ligger p
gemensamma diskar som skyddas genom backuper. Men det finns nd mycket som kan g fel, och nr ngot hnt r ofta den strsta faran rdslan som kan leda till stora
kostnader. Vi har sjlva sett exempel dr rensning av datavirus kostat betydligt mer n
vad som var ndvndigt. Om ngot har hnt kan vi hjlpa till att vrdera faran och fresl  tgrder. Vi hjlper ven till att frebygga problem, genom att se ver virusskyddet och kontrollera att lsningen r anpassad till fretagets vriga rutiner.

<B>ABB Infosystems and Sdra Data join forces.</B><HR>
<BR>


The operations of Sdra Skogsgarna's former data specialist Sdra Data AB were integrated with ABB Infosystems on 1 April. For ABB Infosystems, this brought a welcome addition of competence and an even wider range of skills, not least in the forestry industry. For the customers, Sdra Data's services for applications such as maintenance control, economy control and order, stock and invoice processing benefit from a boost in resources for further development. The benefits are seen both in terms of a new functional approach and in an upgrade in the technology used, which in turn means added security for those who already use these services or expect to use them in the future.<P>

<B>Facts about Merit</B><P>

The Merit maintenance system is a powerful tool used by maintenance departments in industry. The system was developed by Sdra Data, formerly part of Sdra Skogsgarna, and it is installed in various branches of the forestry industry, in the chemical industry, engineering and power suppliers in Sweden and Norway. Merit is a standard system which is installed in any number of modules to suit individual needs.
<LI> Basic module
<LI>Plant module
<LI>Drawing and Document Register
<LI>Parts handling
<LI>Preventive maintenance
<LI>Work-order processing
<LI>Follow-up module
<LI>Stores and Purchasing
<LI>Project handling<P>

Merit is used in the UNIX environment for various hardware platforms such as HP, SUN Digital IBM, and with a free relation database (Ingres, Oracle, Sybase). A readymade interface permits integration with other systems such as economy and finance, production, CAD and other systems. There are also functions for multimedia. The workstations may be anything from simple terminals to X-terminals, PCs operating under Windows, dedicated work-stations and Macintosh computers. <P>

Further development and maintenance of Merit take place continuously and in such a way that there are no differences in standard software irrespective of environment. Individually tailored applications are separated in dedicated modules which are specific to each individual customer.<P>

Merit's user association, which ties together customers from different backgrounds and countries, helps ensure strong, motivated and functional development of the system. Both users and ABB Infosystems want to continue developing Merit with flexible and integrated functions within the customer's overall IT requirements.<P>

<B>Sverigentet ABB SN grows with ISDN</B><HR><BR>

ABB Infosystems offers ISDN connections with ABB's fixed Swedish network. ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) is a communication architecture which integrates speech, data and graphic transmission simultaneously and on the same line. The telecom industry's ISDN expansion has increased considerably in Europe over the past twelve months, paving the way for numerous integrated applications. The main benefit is high transmission speed at low cost.<P>

<B>Cheap supplement</B><BR>
The ISDN transmission speed is normally 64 kbit/s, compared with the dedicated line network which has transmission speeds from 64 kbit/s to 2 Mbit/s. In the dedicated network, the lines are connected round the clock and are intended for continuous intensive traffic. With ISDN, you only pay for the duration for which you are linked up. Irrespective of where in the network the nodes are located, the cost is only for a local or national call. All this taken together means that the total cost for an ISDN connection is often less than half that of a fixed line of corresponding capacity.<P>

<B>Far lower costs</B><BR>
ISDN thus offers LAN client/server environments for LAN communication at a far lower cost than for a dedicated line. The break-even point for cost-efficiency is around 4 hours link-up time per day. For a small office with just a few staff members who only need to use the net occasionally, it is an excellent choice. Within ABB, there are still many company offices which are not connected to the Swedish network but with ISDN technology, the number of subscriptions is expected to increase sharply.<P>

<B>Links to small offices</B><BR>
ABB Flkt's branch offices/regional subsidiaries and ABB Installation are examples of companies which have begun linking up their smaller regional offices to ISDN. As demand increases, ABB Infosystems will increase the number of ISDN nodes in the Swedish network.

<B>Easy Flow - a 40-million kronor agreement with ABB Industrial Systems</B><HR>
<BR>

ABB Industrial Systems chose ABB Infosystems as partner and integrator for implementation of the German SAP R/3 standard system. Easy Flow is the name of the implementation project which will continue for two to three years.<P>

And now it is time for ABB industrial Systems to leave the AROS environment. Functions such as order handling, purchasing, engineering, manufacture, economy, invoicing, logistics etc which today are handled in the mainframe environment will work more smoothly in a flexible client/server environment. SAP R/3 is a modern tool which will help improve our operational processes in our bid to offer customers all-inclusive solutions of world-beating standard.<BR>
"Our choice of ABB Infosystems as partner offers us an excellent basis for carrying through the project successfully with our combined resources," says Lars Linde, President of ABB Industrial Systems.
 <P> 

After a detailed assessment, SAP R/3 was chosen as the basic system to support the company's activities in plant operations, development, production, sales, economy steering and quality follow-up. The system will be introduced at all seven of ABB Industrial Systems's divisions at ten sites in Sweden. The order is valued at 40 million Swedish kronor and covers a comprehensive undertaking whereby ABB Infosystems is responsible for the introduction of SAP R/3 and training in its use. The agreement covers licences for 1,500 users and maintenance for four years. The delivery agreement also includes an option for ABB Industrial Systems to place an order for operation of the new system at ABB Infosystems throughout the project duration, and additionally for a further two years. This option is valued at just over 10 million kronor. ABB Industrial Systems is conducting several projects with T50; with this latest operational development and backed up by SAP R/3, the intention is to establish reliable system support for these projects. Some of the goals are to streamline and increase the degree of automation in the order handling and production processes, and to improve the quality of the plant project's operation and follow-up.<P>

SAP R/3 is a flexible tool which supports a simple working approach and assists forthcoming operational changes. One important aspect in the partnership with ABB Industrial Systems is that Kjell Gustafsson in the ABB Infosystems executive management takes up a position as project manager at ABB Industrial Systems. ABB Infosystems has also signed an agreement with its suppliers SAP Svenska AB and Management Application Support, both of which have several years of experience with SAP R/3.<P>

<TD WIDTH=400><FONT SIZE=+2>Hur anv&auml;nds olika spoofing metoder</FONT>

<HR>
<P>Spoofing anv&auml;nds ofta som hj&auml;lpmedel vid dataintr&aring;ng
och avlyssning. Man skiljer normalt mellan IP, DNS och Web spoofing. Alla
metoderna bygger p&aring; att man utger sig f&ouml;r att vara n&aring;gon
man inte &auml;r.</P>

<H3>IP spoofing</H3>

<P>Vid IP spoofing uppger angriparen en falsk IP adress, motiven &auml;r
antingen att utnyttja ett tillst&aring;nd i en annan dator som baseras
p&aring; IP adress eller att f&ouml;rsv&aring;ra identifiering. Rent praktiskt
finns f&ouml;ljande alternativ: </P>

<P>1. Omkonfiguration till &ouml;nskad IP adress (enklast)<BR>
2. Intr&aring;ng i en dator med &ouml;nskad IP adress<BR>
3. Anv&auml;ndning av f&ouml;rfalskade IP paket (sv&aring;rast)<BR>
</P>

<P>Vid en omkonfiguration anger man tillf&auml;lligt en ny IP-adress i
sin dator. Detta kan givetvis medfra konflikter med den dator som har
samma IP-adress. Om man r i samma lokaler s kan man dra ut ethernetkabeln till
denna maskin, lossa en frbindelse i en router eller stra ut datorn p annat
stt. Ifall datorn vars IP-adress man vill anvnda befinner sig utom rckhll
s kan man stra ut den ntverksmssigt med olika metoder och antingen
verbelasta den eller tvinga den att starta om.  

<P>Det &auml;r sv&aring;rt att
byta ut mer &auml;n den sista delen i IP adressen, i annat fall kommer
routrarna inte att kunna skicka tillbaka svaren. Man kan d&auml;rf&ouml;r
ist&auml;llet g&ouml;ra ett intr&aring;ng i en dator som ligger i ett l&auml;mpligt
n&auml;t. Detta intr&aring;ng kan kombineras med ett tillf&auml;lligt byte
av IP adress, man bryter sig allts&aring; in i en dator, konfigurerar om
n&auml;tadressen (inom samma subn&auml;t), startar om datorn och tar slutligen
ny kontakt med datorn p&aring; den nya adressen efter omstarten. </P>

<P>Exempel: Angriparen vill passera en firewall. Via sniffning (man l&auml;ser
all datatrafik p&aring; sitt eget subn&auml;t) hittar han en IP adress
och en identitet med l&ouml;senord som ger &aring;tkomst till en dator
p&aring; andra sidan. Om angriparen anv&auml;nder sniffning kan han kanske
hitta en inloggning &ouml;ver n&auml;tet till den betrodda IP adressen
- i s&aring; fall &auml;r det l&auml;tt att sj&auml;lv logga in i den betrodda
datorn och d&auml;refter passera firewallen. </P>

<P>Som en sista utv&auml;g kan angriparen anv&auml;nda f&ouml;rfalskade
IP paket. Den minsta sv&aring;righeten &auml;r att man inte f&aring;r se
svaren p&aring; de kommandon man ger - det &auml;r som att arbeta vid en
trasig bildsk&auml;rm. Men datorn som man f&ouml;rs&ouml;ker lura avslutar
trafiken om man inte kvitterar svaren. F&ouml;r att kring&aring; detta
har det konstruerats program som f&ouml;rutsp&aring;r sekvensnumreringen
av de IP-paket som ska kvitteras. </P>

<P>Spoofingskyddet i en Firewall kontrollerar om IP-adressen kan
komma genom det n&auml;tverkskort (i Firewall datorn) som trafiken passerar. Givetvis &auml;r
det m&ouml;jligt att spoofing lura en Firewall &auml;ven i detta fall,
men d&aring; genom indirekta metoder. </P>

<H3>DNS spoofing</H3>

<P>Tillst&aring;nd till tj&auml;nster (newsgrupper, websidor och inloggning
i datorer) baseras ofta p&aring; dom&auml;nadress ist&auml;llet f&ouml;r
IP adress. Om en person tillh&ouml;r bolag.se s&aring; f&aring;r han l&auml;sa
bolagets interna websidor. Denna kontroll sker genom en &quot;reverse DNS-lookup&quot;.
<BR>
Exempel: En angripare som kontrollerar sin egen DNS server kan instruera
denna att ge ett l&auml;mpligt svar p&aring; en fr&aring;ga - kommer fr&aring;gan
fr&aring;n bolag.se s&aring; ge svaret dator1.bolag.se, ge annars det riktiga
svaret. Att fr&aring;gan st&auml;lls till angriparens DNS server beror
p&aring; att denna &auml;r ansvarig f&ouml;r IP adressen. </P>

<P>M&ouml;jligheterna att utnyttja DNS spoofing avg&ouml;rs av i vilken
omfattning det system man vill lura utf&ouml;r dubbelkontroller och rimlighetskontroller.
Webservern som fick svaret dator1.bolag.se i exemplet ovan, kan be om en
vanlig DNS uppslagning (denna fr&aring;ga g&aring;r nu till dns.bolag.se
eftersom denna &auml;r ansvarig f&ouml;r dom&auml;nnamnet). </P>

<P>Det r viktigt att hantera DNS relaterade skerhetsfrgor korrekt. Fr det frsta
ska DNS servern ha en hg skerhetsniv eftersom den kan anvndas fr att ge tillstnd
att n andra datasystem. Ofta r DNS administratren inte medveten om detta ansvar.
Fr det andra kan DNS spoofing kombineras med andra intrngsmetoder, tex Web spoofing
som beskrivs nedan. Detta kan ske genom att en angripare med hjlp av en frfalskad DNS
uppgift pekar ut en oriktig Web server. Fr det tredje kan DNS spoofing anvndas fr att
att uppge en oriktig sndningsvg fr e-post. Brev fr d passera en extra frmedlande 
server som kopierar innehllet.                                 

<P>Det r slutligen mycket viktigt att inte lmna ut uppgifter om det inre datantet till
en extern DNS frfrgan, eftersom dessa uppgifter kan ge ledtrdar som behvs fr att 
bryta sig in i ntet. Normalt ska yttre DNS frfrgningar enbart ge information om var
Web och SMTP (e-post) servers har fr adresser. 
Olika varianter av DNS spoofing kan hr anvndas fr att 
antingen oriktigt f detaljerad information frn det inre ntet eller utge en falsk web eller
SMTP server representera ett fretag. </P> 


<H3>Web spoofing</H3>

<P>Vid web spoofing utger sig en mellanhand f&ouml;r trafiken f&ouml;r
att vara den verkliga servern (gentemot klienten) och den verkliga klienten
(gentemot servern). Detta &auml;r normalt m&ouml;jligt att &aring;stadkomma
&auml;ven vid krypterade websessioner eftersom ingen fullst&auml;ndig 
autentiseringskontroll skett i b&aring;da riktningar. </P>

<P>Med hj&auml;lp av webspoofing kan l&ouml;senord och data snappas upp
samt falska transaktioner genomf&ouml;ras. I samband med anv&auml;ndning
av Java, Javascript och ActiveX &ouml;kas m&ouml;jligheterna att d&ouml;lja
den verkliga mellanhanden eftersom de f&auml;lt i webklienten som visar
location, contacting host mm. kan &auml;ndras. </P>

<HR>
<P>SATAN vllade stor debatt nr programmet slpptes 1995. Oron var stor att
databrottslingar skulle f ett verktyg att bryta sig in i datorer.
Debatten har ocks lett till att f tillggsmoduler publicerats trots
att programmet r enkelt att bygga ut. Det mest knda
paketet med tillggsfunktioner finns idag p Purdue University.</P>

<P>Paketet omfattar moduler fr att detektera brister i popd, fingerd,
ftpd, smtp decode, rstatd, rusersd och ypbind. Vidare ingr en modul, sysaccnt,
fr att finna systemidentiteter utan lsenord eller med ltt gissade lsenord. 
Slutligen ingr ett par mycket enkla uppdateringar fr att identifiera POP och
IRC servrar.

<P>Anvndningen av Expect gr att tillggsmoduler r lika enkla att skriva som ett 
inloggningsscript till en modempool. Den modul som frsker logga in i system, 
sysaccnt.satan, r konstruerad fr SUN system. Fr att anpassa modulen till andra system krvs
att teckenstrngarna fr misslyckade inloggningar i dessa system lggas in. Likas kan
man behva gra anpassningar fr andra mjliga felmeddelandetexter.           

<P>Det intressanta r att vissa tjnster identifieras som
brister oavsett deras farlighetsgrad. Mjligheterna r ocks stora att anpassa
bedmningen efter fretagets eller organisationens nskeml. En systemadministratr
vill normalt ha en enhetlig milj och bara tillta de tjnster som mste anvndas
inom fretagets verksamhet.

<P>Vi har mjligheter att som konsulter ge fretag och organisationer egna anpassningar
av programmen. Vi kan d lgga in kontroller att enbart tilltna versioner av vissa tjnster
anvnds och att andra tjnster enbart fr kras i ett begrnsat antal maskiner. Givetvis har
vi mjligheter att stta upp en lokal milj fr programmen och verlta gjorda anpassningar.

<H4>Nr kommer nsta version av SATAN?</H4>

Enligt Dan Farmer kommer nsta version av SATAN under brjan av 1997. Under tiden
rekommenderar vi hans artikel "Shall we dust Moscow?" som ligger p

<TD WIDTH=400><FONT SIZE=+2>&Aring;r 2000 problematiken - v&aring;r syn</FONT>

<HR>
<P>Debatten kring &aring;r 2000 problematiken har &ouml;kat i takt med
antalet artiklar, konferenser och utbildningar i &auml;mnet. De krav som
st&auml;lls p&aring; datasystemen &auml;r h&ouml;gst olika. Vissa system
m&aring;ste fungera under &aring;rsskiftet - detta g&auml;ller tele och
datakommunikation, larmcentraler, kraftleverant&ouml;rer och processindustri
.</P>

<P>Andra datasystem m&aring;ste snabbt f&aring;s att fungera efter st&ouml;rningar
- detta g&auml;ller framf&ouml;r allt ekonomi, transport och produktionssystem.
H&auml;r kan enstaka driftst&ouml;rningar m&ouml;jligen till&aring;tas,
men inga l&auml;ngre stopp.</P>

<P>P&aring;verkan av &aring;r 2000 kommer vid olika tidpunkter. Ett ekonomisystem
m&aring;ste hantera &aring;rtalen ett par &aring;r i f&ouml;rv&auml;g,
d&auml;remot beh&ouml;ver order, transport och produktionssystem kanske
bara beh&ouml;va det n&aring;gra m&aring;nader i f&ouml;rv&auml;g.</P>

<P>Normalt medf&ouml;r varje &aring;rsskifte ett visst antal &aring;tg&auml;rder
och kontroller. I&nbsp;en stordator framst&auml;ller en systemadministrat&ouml;r
ett antal filer med helgdagar mm. som sedan ligger till grund f&ouml;r
schedulering och debitering i systemet. Man kontrollerar &auml;ven fyllnadsgraden
i systemen inf&ouml;r &aring;rsk&ouml;rningar.</P>

<P>Det finns dock faktorer som g&ouml;r &aring;r 2000 speciellt. Detta
g&auml;ller framf&ouml;r allt hanteringen av &aring;rtal i databaser och
program.</P>

<UL>
<LI>&Auml;ldre program lagrar inte hela &aring;rtalet - det g&aring;r inte
f&ouml;renklat att s&auml;ga att bara tv&aring; siffror lagras. I&nbsp;stordatorer
lagras &aring;r och dagnummer ofta i packat format och antalet varianter
p&aring; datumf&auml;lt &auml;r stort.</LI>

<LI>Sorteringsprogram kan vara inst&auml;llda p&aring; att sortera tv&aring;
tecken i &aring;rtalet. F&ouml;r varje sortering finns en parameterfil
som beskriver f&auml;lt, sorteringsordning och eventuellt vilkor f&ouml;r
sl&aring; ihop filer (merge). </LI>

<LI>Assemblerprogram kan vara inst&auml;llda p&aring; att bara sortera
vad som ryms i ett register eller ett ord.</LI>

<LI>Administrativa program f&ouml;r hantering av dataset (filer, band)&nbsp;kan
tolka poster typ 99365 som att detta dataset saknar slutdatum (expiration
date).</LI>

<LI>Databashanterare kan tolka f&auml;lt som 99 eller 00 som att f&auml;ltet
inte &auml;r ifyllt eller att uppgift saknas.</LI>

<LI>&Aring;r 2000 &auml;r skott&aring;r eftersom det &auml;r j&auml;mt
delbart med 400 (rutiner f&ouml;r datumhantering &auml;r normalt riktiga,
men ibland kan man hitta hemgjorda assemblerprogram).</LI>

<LI>Teckenstr&auml;ngen 19 kan vara f&ouml;rifylld i olika menyer och program.</LI>

<LI>M&aring;nga datumfunktioner anger antal dagar sedan seklets b&ouml;rjan,
tex funktionen date('Century')&nbsp;i rexx.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Hur f&ouml;rbereder man sig f&ouml;r &aring;r 2000?</H3>

<P>Beh&ouml;vs det en speciell organisation och speciella experter? Problemet
&auml;r ju helt unikt?</P>

<P>Enligt v&aring;r uppfattning &auml;r en &aring;r 2000 genomg&aring;ng
av ett datasystem en normal arbetsuppgift f&ouml;r en IT-revisor. Vi vill
ocks&aring; referera till den <A HREF="http://www.isaca.org/yr2000ag.htm">Year
2000 Audit Guideline</A>.</P>

<P>Planera &aring;r 2000 genomg&aring;ngen p&aring; samma s&auml;tt som
en f&ouml;rberedelse f&ouml;r en uppgradering av ett operativsystem. Inventera
f&ouml;retagets aff&auml;rsprocesser och deras krav p&aring; IT-st&ouml;d.
G&aring; d&auml;refter genom datasystem, databaser, subrutinbibliotek,
API:er och program. I detta sammanhang st&auml;lls normala IT-revisionskrav,
n&auml;mligen att f&ouml;retagets system ska vara dokumenterade. </P>

<H3>Hur ska genomg&aring;ngen g&ouml;ras?</H3>

<P>F&ouml;rs&ouml;k att g&ouml;ra genomg&aring;ngen stegvis. Spara pengar
genom att g&ouml;ra en dokumentation som kan anv&auml;ndas i framtiden.
L&aring;t programmerare och systemprogrammerare dokumentera sina arbeten,
men granska fortl&ouml;pande kvaliteten.</P>

<P>Ifall f&ouml;rteckningar saknas &ouml;ver f&ouml;retagets datasystem,
s&aring; g&aring; igenom ansvarsf&ouml;rdelningar och skriv upp alla program
som kommer fram. Om det beh&ouml;vs s&aring; s&ouml;k igenom all k&auml;llkod
efter datumrelaterade str&auml;ngar, tex.</P>

<P>datum, date, YYMMDD, MM/DD/YY osv.</P>

<P>G&ouml;r tester p&aring; program och rutiner. Framst&auml;ll provdata
och skaffa licenser fram till och med &aring;r 2000 f&ouml;r att kunna
prova k&ouml;pta program i ett testsystem.</P>

<P>Skriv in i f&ouml;retagets IT-plan vad som beh&ouml;ver g&ouml;ras.
Best&auml;m vilka system som ska fasas ut f&ouml;re &aring;r 2000. L&aring;t
inte genomg&aring;ngen bli f&ouml;r dyr, anv&auml;nd den kompetens som
finns inom f&ouml;retaget i f&ouml;rsta hand.</P>

<P>V&auml;lj helst en konsult eller IT-revisor med programmeringserfarenhet
i de system som g&aring;s igenom.</P>

<H3>Var hittar man testdata och datumrutiner?</H3>

<P>Programmet 
<A HREF="archive/dateconv.txt">dateconv</A> 
&auml;r skrivet i rexx och ska med mindre justeringar
kunna anv&auml;ndas under AS/400, OS/2, VM/CMS och MVS/TSO. Programmet
visar vilka datumkonverteringar som kan g&ouml;ras och l&auml;mpar sig
ocks&aring; f&ouml;r att framst&auml;lla testdata.</P>

att uppgradera, men det b&ouml;r ske i samband med kompletterande &aring;tg&auml;rder.</P>

<H4>Uppgradera linan</H4>

<P>Standarden f&ouml;r en anv&auml;ndare &auml;r idag minst 28 kbit/s.
En dataavdelning med 10-20 anst&auml;llda kan troligen klara sig med en
gemensam 64 kbit/s f&ouml;rbindelse. Ett dataf&ouml;retag med 500 anst&auml;llda
kan klara sig med 512 kbit/s. I&nbsp;dessa siffror f&ouml;ruts&auml;tts
en normal anv&auml;ndning av Internet och att man anv&auml;nder en gemensam
cache.</P>

<P>I&nbsp;framtiden kommer det att bli vanligt med egna Internetlinor,
ett f&ouml;retag med en egen telefonv&auml;xel kommer troligen ocks&aring;
att ha en egen fast koppling till Internet. St&ouml;rre avdelningar inom
ett f&ouml;retag kommer troligen att ha en egen matningslina f&ouml;r sina
egna behov, typiskt en cacheserver och kanske &auml;ven en mail server.</P>

<H4>F&ouml;rb&auml;ttra DNS st&ouml;det</H4>

<P>Ett bra DNS st&ouml;d (Domain Name Services)&nbsp;kr&auml;vs f&ouml;r
Internetlinan ska fungera bra. Varje g&aring;ng n&aring;gon h&auml;mtar
en websida anropas DNS servern flera g&aring;nger. F&ouml;rst fr&aring;gar
klienten efter en &ouml;vers&auml;ttning av adressen, varp&aring; den best&auml;mmer
att anropet ska g&aring; via en cacheserver eftersom adressen l&aring;g
utanf&ouml;r f&ouml;retagets n&auml;t. D&auml;refter fr&aring;gar cacheservern
om samma adress innan anropet g&aring;r iv&auml;g till den fr&auml;mmande
datorn, som i sin tur vill veta vem som fr&aring;gar och g&ouml;r en bakl&auml;nges
fr&aring;ga (reverse DNS lookup).</P>

<P>En bra DNS konfiguration kan vara att ha en modern unix maskin som primary
DNS server och secondary DNS via sin Internet leverant&ouml;r. <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Av
s&auml;kerhetssk&auml;l &auml;r det viktigt att DNS servern aldrig l&auml;mnar
ut information om f&ouml;retagets inre namn och adresser, man har d&auml;rf&ouml;r
normalt en inre DNS&nbsp;server inom f&ouml;retaget och en yttre DNS server
som bara k&auml;nner till f&ouml;retagets mail-kopplingar, externa webserver
och cacheserver.</FONT></B></P>

<H4>Anv&auml;nd moderna webl&auml;sare</H4>

<P>Moderna webl&auml;sare klienter klarar att hantera en egen cache, i
motsats till &auml;ldre versioner som ofta h&auml;mtar allt data &ouml;ver
n&auml;tet varje g&aring;ng. Ju nyare webl&auml;sare som anv&auml;nds desto
fler s&auml;kerhetsrisker f&ouml;rsvinner, &aring;tminstonde i allm&auml;nnhet.
En av riskerna med Internetanv&auml;ndning kan annars vara en oj&auml;mn
f&ouml;rdelning av f&ouml;retagens webl&auml;sare, &auml;ldre program har
kvar fler buggar relaterade till exempelvis JAVA applikationer.</P>

<H4>Ge r&aring;d till anv&auml;ndarna</H4>

<P>Genom att s&auml;tta l&auml;mplig storlek p&aring; anv&auml;ndarens
lokala cache och v&auml;lja att kontrollera om l&auml;nkarna uppdaterats
h&ouml;gst en g&aring;ng per session minskar man belastningen. Hj&auml;lp
ocks&aring; anv&auml;ndarna att v&auml;lja en startsida inom f&ouml;retaget,
ist&auml;llet f&ouml;r att g&aring; direkt till Netscape eller Microsoft.
Se &auml;ven till att anv&auml;ndarna g&aring;r genom en proxy / cacheserver.
I vart fall &auml;r det ol&auml;mpligt att l&aring;ta ett stort antal anv&auml;ndare
kunna g&aring; ut p&aring; Internet direkt, &auml;ven om man av n&aring;got
sk&auml;l vill till&aring;ta denna m&ouml;jlighet. Dataprogram och liknande
resurser b&ouml;r h&auml;mtas inom det egna landet n&auml;r s&aring; &auml;r
m&ouml;jligt.</P>

<H4>M&auml;t anv&auml;ndningen</H4>

<P>De flesta cacheservrar ger information om anv&auml;ndningen. Normalt
kan man utnyttja denna information f&ouml;r att styra upp anv&auml;ndningen.
Genom loggarna kan man ocks&aring; bilda sig en uppfattning om n&auml;r
linan b&ouml;rjar bli &ouml;verbelagd.</P>

<H4>Anv&auml;nd en cache server</H4>

<P>Normalt b&ouml;r man ha en cache server med minst 4 GB&nbsp;cachedisk
f&ouml;r en 512 kbit/s lina. Det &auml;r praktiskt att ha s&aring; stort
disk utrymme att servern inte startar &quot;garbage collection&quot; under
dagtid. Man b&ouml;r ocks&aring; f&ouml;rs&ouml;ka st&auml;lla in bra parametrar
f&ouml;r hur ofta servern kontrollerar om cachat data har f&ouml;r&auml;ndrats.</P>

<P>F&ouml;r att f&ouml;rb&auml;ttra prestanda kan man ofta dela det cachade
datat &ouml;ver olika diskar, samt &auml;ven l&auml;gga det cachade datat
och olika indexfiler p&aring; olika diskar.</P>

<H4>Anv&auml;nd flera linor</H4>

<P>F&ouml;rst n&auml;r olika avdelningar inom ett stort f&ouml;retag anv&auml;nder
separata linor f&ouml;r sin Internettrafik blir det praktiskt m&ouml;jligt
att styra kostnader och anv&auml;ndning r&auml;tt. Separata linor beh&ouml;ver
inte vara sv&aring;ra att hantera ur kommunikations och s&auml;kerhetssynpunkt
om de bara anv&auml;nds f&ouml;r att mata en cacheserver.</P>

<H4>Anv&auml;nd olika linor f&ouml;r surfning och f&ouml;retagets aff&auml;rsf&ouml;rbindelser</H4>

<P>Denna punkt &auml;r den viktigaste av alla. F&ouml;retagets externa
websidor &auml;r en viktig del av dess aff&auml;rsverksamhet och ska inte
st&ouml;ras av de anst&auml;lldas surfande p&aring; Internet. Tyv&auml;rr
upplever man ofta inte hur stort problemt &auml;r utifr&aring;n, eftersom
f&ouml;retagets egen cacheserver fungerar tillfredsst&auml;llande. Man
antar d&auml;refter felaktigt att utomst&aring;ende har samma svarstider
n&auml;r de l&auml;ser f&ouml;retagets websidor.</P>

<H4>Effektivisera den externa webservern</H4>

<P>Anv&auml;nd g&auml;rna flera webservrar och avst&aring; fr&aring;n att
anv&auml;nda &quot;reverse DNS lookup&quot; f&ouml;r all &ouml;ppen information.
I&nbsp;den m&aring;n man vill ha dessa uppgifter f&ouml;r statistikens
skull s&aring; f&aring;r de tas fram i efterhand. D&auml;rigenom serveras
l&auml;saren ofta sidorna 5 till 15 sekunder snabbare.</P>

<P>S&auml;tt r&auml;tt expiration date p&aring; websidorna - de st&ouml;rsta
syndarna p&aring; detta omr&aring;de &auml;r normalt dagstidningar som
ju borde veta i f&ouml;rv&auml;g n&auml;r n&auml;sta dags utg&aring;va
ska komma.</P>

<P>Anv&auml;nd inte f&ouml;r stora bilder och l&aring;t alla referenser
till enkla bildelement (knappar, streck, f&ouml;retagsnamn)&nbsp;g&aring;
till ett enda st&auml;lle. Skicka inte bilder av text - ifall f&ouml;retagsnamnet
ska st&aring; i ett visst typsnitt s&aring; ange det och l&aring;t de webklienter
som klarar att visa typsnittet g&ouml;ra det. En nackdel med att skicka
text i bildformat &auml;r ocks&aring; att man inte kan hitta texten vid
s&ouml;kning.</P

<FONT SIZE=+2>Skning efter "cgi-bin" brister,<BR>
ett nytt hot mot webservrar</FONT>
<HR>
<P>
En systematisk skning av cgi-bin brister dr ett stort antal webservrar sks igenom maskinellt r ett nytt problem, som nu diskuteras i skerhetsrelaterade mailinglistor. Se nedanstende <A HREF="#ex">exempel</A>. 
<P>
Fr att kunna behandla information frn anvndaren har de flesta webservrar en programkatalog, dr program kan ta emot argument frn ett formulr eller liknande. En angripare kan istllet skicka data p ett sdant stt, att de tolkas som ett nytt program som krs i web servern. 
<P>
Vid en maskinell genomskning kan angriparen anvnda en lista ver ett stort antal webservrar och kombinera dessa med ett antal tnkbara brister. Fr att undvika upptckt s utnyttjas inte bristen fullt ut, utan bara s mycket som krvs fr att se att den r dr. I de mnga fall rcker det med att se om ett visst cgi-bin program finns i maskinen, man ger d ett helt legalt anrop. 
<P>
Efter den maskinella genomskningen r klar vljer angriparen i lugn och ro ut de maskiner han vill angripa, ofta vntar man ngra veckor fr att loggar ska rensas och det inte ska kunna konstateras i efterhand att angreppet var systematiskt. 
<P>
<B>Vra rekommendationer</B>
<P>
Vr slutsats blir att sannolikheten kat att en webserver ska bli utsatt fr den hr typ av underskning och angrepp. Man kan inte lngre hoppas att kunna gmma sig i mngden och tro att angriparen aldrig kommer till just min maskin. Frutom cgi-bin brister kan rena buggar i serverprogramvara och konfiguration utnyttjas. Ett exempel fel i konfigurationen kan vara att webserver tillter obegrnsad uppladdning med filer via PUT, normalt anvnds bara GET fr att hmta sidor och filer. 
<P>
Var drfr beredd p att ett angrepp kan komma via en webserver. Lgg drfr helst webservrar och mailservrar p egna firewallseparerade ntsegment. Kr alltid webprogrammet med en egen anvndaridentitet, som har mycket begrnsade skriv- och lstillstnd. 
<P>
Tips p hur man gr sina cgi-bin program skra finns p fljande stllen.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.genome.wi.mit.edu/WWW/faqs/www-security-faq.html">WWW security FAQ </A>
<P>
En lista p srbara scripts i dessa sammanhang r ocks inkluderad i denna FAQ, ett par scripts som ofta nmns r AnyForm, FormMail och "phf" phone book script. 
<P>
<A NAME="ex"></A>Det finns ven rena brister i vissa web programvaror, som kan utnyttjas utan att behva anropa ngot cgi-bin program.

<HR>
<P>
Everything changes fast. The security knowledge that was valid a only a few years ago, is obsolete today. Just as in the data communication and the Internet. <p>
As technology and information flows change, new vulnerabilities are introduced.
<P>
Our aim is to create advanced security solutions and at the same time have firsthand knowledge of the new methods used by crackers to break the computer security. 
ABB Infosystems Security Services group was formed in order to meet the increasing demand for IT-security, both within and outside the ABB group. <BR>
<dd>We have experience in fields like auditing standards, operating systems, network communication and computer security.

During a security audit we examine and evaluate the security by a number of criterias, and write a report over our findings. The first step is to examine all relevant documentation and the effectiveness of the security policy. At the same time we also do interviews. The next step is to do a number of tests based on checklists and manual hacking methods, as well as with computer based scanning tools. Of course we do follow commonly accepted <A HREF="itrev.html"> Information Systems Auditing Standards </A> and practicies.

We help the customer to make a working security policy and how to enforce its usage. As a base for the policy we use a commonly accepted standard and then make all necessary changes in order to customise it to the organisation. We help to create a flexible and not to complicated policy, which helps it to work in practice. It is also important to include all relevant items in the policy. Some parts that should
be included are computer security, information security, network security and segmentation and finally measures to enforce the policy by means of security budgets and security auditing at regular intervalls.

In all computer systems exists information that must be protected. We first check
that we have a solid base to build on. The computer network and the computers
must have a sufficient security level, which is checked with our <A HREF="_sakrev.html">Security Audit</A>. It is often adviseable to strip the operating system by removing components and services that are not needed, which can introduce vulnerabilities when used. After these steps are covered it is possible to make the information systems themselves secure, whether they are an economy system or a production system in an industrial environment. At this point we check that all prerequsites in form of customisation, documentation, surveillance and control measures are fulfilled.

Market Exposure with regard to Internet could mean different things. It is possible to measure the company presence on
the net and compare it to the competitors, and for each market compare the numbers of references given by search engines
and link pages. It is possible to analyse competitors presence in different projects by searching links and examine the
findings. Customers and partners often enter links to their manufactures. 
<P>

Our objective in this area is to help our customers to achieve an advantage by honest means. After we have evaluated the
company presence on the net, we will report our findings and suggestions for changes in the web pages, and the way of
spreading information.

Det r viktigt att ta reda p varfr ngot har hnt oavsett om det r ett datorhaveri, en
brand eller ett virus som slagit till. Om man fr svar p frgorna angende hndelsefrlopp och konsekvenser, kan man frebygga att det hnder igen. Vi hjlper till att reda ut detta i en incidentanalys.
<P>
Vid en incidentanalys undersker vi bakomliggande orsaker till varfr ngot
onskat intrffat. Orsakerna kan vara grundlggande brister i skerhetspolicy eller brister i uppfljning och rapportering. Men bristerna kan ocks bero p att den
tekniska datorskerheten blivit eftersatt och man helt inte fljt anvisningar frn
<A HREF="http://www.cert.org">CERT</A>. Tekniska problem kan bero p att man inte tar sig tid med konstruktion och dokumentation av systemen. Denna underltenhet kar underhllet och gr att man hamnar i en ond spiral.

   to your garbage cart by 6:00 a.m. on any garbage collection day.
   Please remove ornaments and tinsel, and cut trees taller than six
   feet in half. If you want your tree composted, also remove plastic
   trees bags and save the tree in your back yard -- off the alley --
   until yardwaste collection begins in mid-April.

<P>Yard work is just around the corner. Remember that a dull lawnmower blade
tears grass. This results in brown, damaged grass tips. By sharpening your
blade at a nearby hardware store, you can mow faster and keep a greener
lawn.</P>

signs are posted the day before sweeping. Vehicles not moved are towed.
After you rake leaves, consider composting instead of bagging them. For
composting information, call 673-2917 (TTY 673-2157).</P>

hours when parking is prohibited even if your street APPEARS to be plowed.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>TEMPORARY SIGNS.</B> Streets and alleys are often plowed, sanded and
salted without a Snow Emergency declaration. Temporary no-parking signs
will be posted if necessary. <BR>
<BR>
<B>PARKING TICKETS.</B> Tickets will be issued for parking violations, and
vehicles may be towed to the Impound Lot. <BR>
<BR>
<B>THE IMPOUND LOT.</B> The Municipal Impound Lot, located at 51 Colfax
Avenue North (2 blocks south of Glenwood Avenue and west of Lyndale Avenue),
is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Call 673-5777 with your license plate
number to determine if your vehicle has been towed. Fees are $70 for towing
and $10 daily for storage. The lot accepts cash, personal checks, VISA and
MasterCard. <BR>
<BR>
<B>SEVERE WINTER STORMS.</B> When a major storm is predicted, Minneapolis
may impose temporary parking restrictions IN ADVANCE of the storm. Parking
may be prohibited on the EVEN side of residential streets for up to 48 hours.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>WINTER PARKING RESTRICTIONS.</B> Minneapolis officials will decide after
each Snow Emergency whether it is necessary to continue residential parking
restrictions. If required due to snow accumulation, parking will be banned
on the EVEN side of residential streets. Once imposed, this ban will remain
in effect until April 1 unless removed earlier by City officials. <BR>
<BR>
<B>SHOVEL YOUR SIDEWALKS PROMPTLY.</B> Keep a critical part of Minneapolis'
transportation system moving. City ordinances require that sidewalks of
single family homes and duplexes be cleared within 24 hours after a snowfall.
<BR>
<BR>
Sidewalks in commercial areas and adjacent to apartment buildings must be
cleared within four daytime hours. Removal of snow from private property
into streets and alleys is prohibited. <BR>
<BR>
<B>HELP YOUR NEIGHBORS.</B> Help your elderly neighbors and those with disabilities
clear their sidewalks. Remove snow build-up at corners and around fire hydrants.
When you go out of town, arrange to have your sidewalk cleared and your
vehicles moved during Snow Emergencies. <BR>
<BR>
<B>CALL FOR ASSISTANCE.</B> If you are physically unable to care for your
sidewalk, community organizations will provide snow removal assistance for
a fee. Seniors needing assistance can call the Senior Services Office, 673-3004.
<BR>
<BR>
Call 673-2441 to report unsafe sidewalks or to find out where to get free
sidewalk sand. <BR>

<H1>Put Yourself Into the Plan<BR>
Fight Crime in Minneapolis</H1>
<H3><BR>
Enforcement</H3>
The City of Minneapolis will fairly and vigorously enforce the law. <BR>
 
<H3>Intervention</H3>
When society intervenes,<BR>
 lives of crime are prevented.
<H3><BR>
Prevention</H3>
A crime prevented is a crime <BR>
that never happens. <BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
Minneapolis is a great city. We refuse to let crime -- or the fear of crime
-- diminish it in any way. We will not allow criminal activity -- serious
or petty -- to destroy the beautiful city that is our home.<BR>
<BR>
Minneapolis has a plan to fight crime. Every citizen can be a part of this
plan. It is based on four proven and effective strategies.<BR>
<H2>Zero-Tolerance Enforcement</H2>
 The Minneapolis Police Department enforces zero-tolerance for serious crime.
Our new Gang Strike Task Force has taken the offensive. Thugs, bullies and
gang members who commit crimes of violence and other major crimes will be
arrested.<BR>
 The Minneapolis Police Department is also preparing to enforce zero-tolerance
for &quot;gateway&quot; misdemeanors such as street-level drug-dealing,
prostitution, playing loud music, public consumption of alcohol and littering.
We will not allow irresponsible people to destroy our neighborhoods.<BR>
<H2>Saturation Enforcement</H2>
 The Minneapolis Police Department concentrates zero-tolerance enforcement
on high-crime neighborhoods and addresses.  Anyone who thinks any place
in Minneapolis is &quot;safe for crime&quot; will find out differently.<BR>
 The Minneapolis Police Department - working with the Public Schools and
the Park and Recreation Board - will ensure that our schools and parks are
safe. The Safe Schools/Safe Parks initiative will create safe walking routes,
and use &quot;McGruff&quot; vehicles, school safety assessments and other
tools to protect children and families. The citizens of Minneapolis will
do whatever is necessary to protect our children.<BR>
<H2>Zero-Tolerance Prosecution</H2>
 The City of Minneapolis aggressively prosecutes criminals, including those
who commit the &quot;gateway&quot; misdemeanors that can destroy the livability
of our city. The City will work with the Hennepin County District Court
to create a calendar to target chronic misdemeanants. We will stop the &quot;revolving
door&quot; that frustrates the good work of our Minneapolis police officers.<BR>
<H2>Smart Prevention and Intervention</H2>
 Minneapolis citizens take responsibility for our own safety. We develop
good safety habits. We look out for each other's well being. United, we
can prevent crime.<BR>
 An important part of crime prevention is providing education, recreation
and employment opportunities for youth. We must also remember to teach our
children, by word and by example, our family and community values. We will
never turn our backs on our children. They are our future.<BR>
<BR>
Take a few minutes to read this brochure. It will update you on how the
Minneapolis Police Department enforces the law. It also suggests how you
can put yourself into the plan to fight crime and build community in Minneapolis.<BR>
<BR>
The citizens of Minneapolis lead law-abiding and productive lives. We will
not permit criminals to define the kind of community we live in, or the
kind of community we will pass on to our children.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H1>Fighting Crime </H1>
<H3><I>Straight Talk from Police Chief Robert K. Olson</I></H3>
<H2>The Minneapolis Police Department</H2>
Minneapolis citizens can be proud of their professional law enforcement
organization. It continues to be on the cutting edge of policing in America.
We are currently authorized to hire the highest number of officers in Department
history - 914 sworn positions. In addition, we have put almost $2.5 million
worth of vehicles and equipment into service in 1996. <BR>
<H2>Community Policing</H2>
In the last year we &quot;civilianized&quot; many office positions in order
to put more officers into community policing. We decentralized the Department,
giving precinct commanders additional resources, and empowering them to
be responsible for crime fighting in their precincts. We now have 66 more
officer positions in the precincts than we did a year ago. They do much
more than answer 911 calls. They are part of the new Community Response
Teams that solve problems identified jointly by precinct commanders and
citizen precinct advisory committees.  <BR>
<BR>
We have decentralized School Liaison, DARE, and some property crimes functions.
This frees up officers to work in the precincts, on the streets. It also
means the commanders - rather than distant headquarters personnel - are
responsible for solving problems in their own precincts. Last year we created
a Downtown Command which includes our Mounted Patrol, K-9, Traffic and other
units. That freed up resources in the Fourth Precinct, which had previously
been responsible for downtown, and ensured that downtown will remain one
of the safest places in the city.<BR>
<BR>
Minneapolis has been on the cutting edge of community policing in establishing
CCP/SAFE units across the city. In 1996 we expanded this very successful
program by 50 percent.<BR>
<H2>The Minneapolis Gang Strike Force</H2>
We have assigned 12 experienced officers to the Minneapolis Gang Strike
Force. We know the &quot;blueprint&quot; of how gangs operate. We know who
the members are, who the leaders are, where they live and their daily routines.
We know their motivations and the types of crimes they commit. This  intelligence
resulted in the arrest in August and September of 14 gang members. Three
are murder suspects and charges against the others include attempted murder,
soliciting a minor for prostitution, and drug and gun felonies. We are now
working our way through a list of the 50 most dangerous gangsters. Minneapolis
will be rid of them. <BR>
<H2>Safe Schools/Safe Parks</H2>
The Department is working with the Minneapolis Public Schools and Park and
Recreation Board to improve safety in and around schools and make them a
better environment for learning. A number of measures are proposed as part
of this Safe Schools/Safe Parks initiative, including I.D. cards, security
training for school personnel, and security evaluations for all public schools.
We are working with the Park Board and Park Police to increase park safety
and enhance summer activities for youth, and have launched a Police Athletic
League.<BR>
<H2>Homicides </H2>
Minneapolis has experienced a tragic increase in homicides. Most are committed
by persons known to the victim. Often one or both parties are engaged in
criminal activity. Sadly, over 40 percent involve youth, either as victims
or perpetrators. We are combating this problem with police intelligence,
saturation enforcement and a focus on top criminals and gang activity.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, other crime in the city has not been increasing. The MPD will continue
to focus on violent crime, and the crimes that most disrupt the quality
of life in our neighborhoods.<BR>
<BR>
As proud as I am of our Department, I want every citizen to understand that
good police work is only part of the answer to crime. No matter how many
officers are on the street or how many arrests are made, our work needs
to be backed up by a cooperative criminal justice system, and by county,
state and federal governments. <BR>
<H2>Be Part of the Solution</H2>
Most importantly, we need to work with cooperative and active citizens.
We need you to be our partner. We must all rededicate ourselves to strengthening
our community and fighting crime, each of us in our own way. Together, we
can make sure that Minneapolis continues to be one of the great cities of
America.<BR>

<H1>Defusing <BR>
Drugs, Guns and Gangs</H1>
<I>by Sergeant Mike Martin</I><BR>
<BR>
When you watch the news or read the newspaper, it's hard to avoid stories
about gangs, gun violence and drug-related crime across the country.  Unfortunately,
we in Minneapolis are not immune to the negative impact of street gangs
and narcotics, but we are taking new steps to curb gang activity and violence
in our neighborhoods. We understand that preventing violence requires not
only suppression, but prevention and intervention.  <BR>
<BR>
The Minneapolis Gang Strike Force is responsible for tracking gang intelligence
and making arrests for gang-related crimes.  Our goal is to insure that
there are serious legal consequences for anyone wanting to traffic in guns
or narcotics in our city. <BR>
<BR>
We also work closely with the precinct Community Response Teams to target
street-level drug dealers and remove illegal guns from our neighborhoods.
 In addition, we train school personnel and youth-serving agencies on how
to identify and deal with gang activity.  <BR>
<BR>
We also train community organizations, church groups and other organizations
that provide early intervention with kids who are at risk of becoming involved
in gangs.  We recognize that issues like poverty, lack of parental supervision
and inadequate recreation can put a child at risk.  This is why we need
the help of community members to  provide positive role models for our youth.
 <BR>
<BR>
Some of the best programs I have seen for gang intervention have been community-based
groups that stress cultural issues and provide positive mentors for our
youth.  Programs like The Lao Assistance Center and the American Indian
Center's Golden Eagles Program are excellent examples of the power of early
intervention to prevent youth violence.<BR>
<BR>
As a gang investigator and a resident of Minneapolis, I am excited about
the opportunities we have to provide a positive future for our kids, but
we can't do it alone.  We need your help to identify issues, suggest solutions
and work with our kids.<BR>

<H1>Confronting<BR>
Domestic Violence</H1>
<BR>
<I>by Fourth Precinct Commander Chris Morris</I><BR>
<BR>
Before commanding North Minneapolis' 4th Precinct, I served in the Domestic
Violence unit. Verilea Howard and I are members of a team that has developed
a more effective way to confront domestic violence. It's made up of the
Minneapolis Police Department, the City Attorney's Office, the Domestic
Abuse Project and other community agencies. We've called it The Minneapolis
Model.<BR>
<BR>
In the past, victims/survivors of domestic violence often shut themselves
off from family, friends, police and social service agencies. Families and
neighbors usually looked the other way. Perhaps the most distressing fact
was that, even when cases were prosecuted, 60 percent were dismissed.<BR>
<BR>
Things have changed. Victims are more willing to report violence and society
recognizes that domestic violence is a crime that radiates outward to include
children and neighbors among its victims. When domestic abuse is reported,
police officers have always intervened immediately - often in highly dangerous
situations. What is new is that police investigators and the City Attorney's
Office are more aggressively following up to gain evidence for prosecution.
It goes without saying that our concern for victims/survivors continues.
The Domestic Abuse Project helps them find safe places to live and connects
them with the support networks that are so vital to recovery.<BR>
<BR>
By taking an aggressive, zero-tolerance stand on domestic violence, we've
been able to reverse the apathy of the past. Police and prosecutors - rather
than victims - are taking responsibility for making sure that abuse stops
and offenders are brought to justice. Our conviction rate is now 60 percent;
offenders are paying for their crimes through  jail time, probation and
intensive counseling.<BR>
<BR>
Victims of domestic violence can call the Metro Area Shelter Crisis Line,
<BR>
646-0994. It is answered 24 hours a day. They can be certain that we will
help.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H1>Put Yourself Into the Plan</H1>
<H3>We know what causes crime and violence.<BR>
We also know how to prevent it.</H3>
<H2>Know the Issues</H2>
Crime is the result of personal, family and community failures. The best
way to prevent crime is to build a strong community. Good parenting and
quality education, employment training and jobs, community policing and
neighborhood conflict resolution -- all prevent crime. These have nothing
to do with government. How we conduct our lives on the job and in our homes
and neighborhoods is the most important factor in determining our safety.<BR>
<H2>Get Involved</H2>
What's most important is for each of us to put ourselves into the plan to
fight crime. We don't need to do something big or momentous to be effective.
Small things can make a big difference - learning the name of the child
next door, welcoming the new people on the block, or helping a young adult
improve his or her job skills. Decide what you can do. That's crime prevention.
It's everybody's job.<BR>

The Cyberspace Rangers are a diverse group of Minneapolis City employees
who meet as needed to share information and discuss Internet issues. The
group's mission is to assist and advise City departments as they explore
possible uses for emerging technological methods of communication. 
<H4>Major Goals </H4>
The Cyberspace Rangers will:
<UL>
  <LI>Examine the Internet, specifically the World Wide Web, as a site for
disseminating City information. The group will guide the process of setting
up a City home page, which will provide an umbrella of general information
under which departments will be able to place their own information. City
departments currently using the Web to provide information will be hotlinked
from the City's home page. This will provide a single starting point for
users. In guiding the CityWeb project, the group will consider the merits
of encouraging a standard stylesheet, including common graphics/text to
be found on all pages under the City's control. 
  <LI><BR>
  <LI>Support the Minneapolis CityNet project as it connects City employees
to a common WAN. 
  <LI><BR>
  <LI>Support the efforts of the River Project and the NRP to establish
public access terminals throughout the city. 
  <LI><BR>
  <LI>Examine other emerging technology for possible use by city departments
and communicate their findings to department heads. 
</UL>
<H4>Mission and Objectives </H4>
As a service to Minneapolis citizens, we will provide a citizen-oriented,
easy-to-use online presence containing information about Minneapolis' local
government services. The City's presence on the Internet will help make
the city a better place to live, work, learn and play by establishing a
foundation for greater access to government services. <P>
To accomplish this mission, the project and its coordinators will:
<UL>
  <LI>encourage participation in local government and city life; 
  <LI>make local government more accessible and more interactive to its
customers; 
  <LI>advocate for greater access to the City's Internet information, both
for all its citizens and for its employees; and 
  <LI>carry a consistent graphical look and will coordinate messages and
content wherever possible with other City-sponsored communication vehicles.
<BR>
</UL>
<H4>Values<BR>
</H4>
We place highest value on the information needs of Minneapolis' citizens:
the people who live work and play here. For the website, our values include:
<UL>
  <LI>Customer-focused layout
  <LI>Consistent, accurate information
  <LI>Ease of use
  <LI>Interactivity: an e-mail address on every page
  <LI>Compatibility with major Web browsers
  <LI>Accessibility from slow modems without significant delays<P>
</UL>

<html><head><TITLE>Overview</TITLE></head><body>City of Minneapolis, Division of Solid Waste & Recycling <H2>OVERVIEW</H2><HR width=100%>The Division of Solid Waste & Recycling provides service to approximately 290,000 residents in 114,000 dwelling units. This includes all 1-4 unit residential buildings, and any buildings with five or more units that contract with the City for solid waste services. Crews also collect garbage and recyclables from an additional 100 City buildings, and from 1,200 litter containers placed throughout the city.<p>Service is comprehensive and includes garbage, recycling, large item, and yard waste collections. Collection is provided by City of Minneapolis collection crews, and a consortium of private garbage haulers, Minneapolis Refuse Incorporated (MRI). The City and MRI each collect from approximately half of the dwelling units in the city. In addition, neighborhood clean sweeps and drop-offs for excess garbage, construction and paving materials and tires are also provided as a part of City service.<p>The City of Minneapolis, Division of Solid Waste & Recycling, has received numerous national awards:<ul><li>1992 Best Recycling Program - National Recycling Association<li>1992 Systems Excellence Award - Solid Waste Association of North America<li>1991 Best Recycling Program - US Conference of Mayors</ul>The following is a brief overview of the different aspects of the Division of Solid Waste and Recycling.<p><HR width=100%><p><b>FUNDING</b><p>The primary source of funding is the Solid Waste Base Fee and Disposal Fees charged on the Public Works Utility Bill. The Solid Waste Base fee is $19 unit/month. The Large Cart Disposal fee is $4 cart/month and the Small Cart Disposal fee is $2 cart/month. The Recycling Credit, for participating households, is $7/unit/month.<p><HR width=100%><p><b>GARBAGE COLLECTION</b><p>Residential garbage, including carpet and large items less than 50% metal, is collected weekly. Each building may set out two large items per week. The Division of Solid Waste & Recycling also collects garbage from 1,200 litter containers, and City buildings including fire and police stations.<p><HR width=100%><p><b>LARGE ITEMS COLLECTION</b><p>Major appliances, such as air conditioners and refrigerators, are collected every other week on recycling day. After collection, PCB-laden capacitors and fluorescent light ballasts are removed for disposal at a hazardous waste facility. Mercury switches are removed for recycling. Freon is removed, filtered and reused in city air-conditioning equipment. The appliances are then sent to a scrap metal dealer to be recycled.<p>Large items that are at least 50% metal, such as aluminum storm doors and filing cabinets, are collected every other week on recycling day and delivered to a scrap metal dealer for recycling.<p><HR width=100%><p><b>RECYCLING COLLECTION</b><p>Minneapolis began its recycling program at a time when legal requirements or statutes mandating recycling were nonexistent. The program was originally supported by a strong environmental ethic and a concern about rising garbage disposal costs. A pilot curbside program in 1982 served 32,000 households and collected just over 1,000 tons of newspapers, clear glass and aluminum cans. In 1995, over 22,000 tons of recyclables were collected.<p>Newspapers, metal cans, glass bottles and jars, plastic bottles, magazines, household batteries, phone books, milk/juice cartons, drink boxes, office paper, dry-food boxboard, and corrugated cardboard are collected bi-weekly for recycling. Approximately 90% of the households served by Minneapolis Solid Waste & Recycling participate.<p>In October 1990, household batteries were added to materials collected by recycling crews. In addition, battery drop-off locations were made available at community centers, and fire and police stations for residents who do not have City recycling collection. Mercury and silver oxide, gel cells and nickel-cadmium batteries are recycled. Alkaline batteries are disposed of at a hazardous waste landfill and lithium batteries at a hazardous waste incinerator.<p><HR width=100%><p><b>YARD WASTE COLLECTION</b><p>Grass clippings, leaves, and brush are collected weekly from April through November. Yard waste is composted within the city limits by a contractor.<p>The City Street Division cleans leaves from streets during the fall. These leaves are composted, mulched or landspread.<p>Christmas trees are collected for one week each January. The trees are then chipped and used in landscaping and composting.<p><HR width=100%><p><b>DROPOFF PROGRAMS</b><p>The Division of Solid Waste & Recycling offers vouchers to drop off building and paving materials, excess garbage, and up to eight tires at no additional charge. Two vouchers of each type are available per year for each building with City Solid Waste & Recycling service.<p>The concrete and asphalt collected are both reused. Concrete is stockpiled during the winter months, and then crushed and used as a granular road bed. Asphalt is also crushed and used in varying amounts for new paving projects.<p><HR width=100%><p><b>NEIGHBORHOOD CLEANSWEEPS</b><p>Cleansweeps are one-day, neighborhood clean-up events organized by registered neighborhood groups. The neighborhood provides a coordinator, promotion, and volunteers to help load materials. Minneapolis Solid Waste & Recycling provides trucks, drivers, and disposal. Cleansweeps are a popular City program especially with elderly residents who get assistance from their neighbors with garbage removal. In 1994, 29 neighborhoods organized Cleansweeps.<p><HR width=100%>Updated Monday, 20 May 1996.</body></html>

<H2>Motor Oil and Oil Filter Drop-offs</H2>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P>It is illegal to dispose of motor oil and filters in the garbage
or in storm sewers. An oil filter contains about one cup of oil even
after draining. A single cup of motor oil is enough to contaminate
62,000 gallons of drinking water.</P>

<P>Fortunately, the locations below accept both motor oil and motor
oil filters, at no charge, from Minneapolis residents. These
drop-offs are for residential use only. So limit oil to five gallons
at a time. Do not mix oil with other auto fluids such as antifreeze.
Please drop-off oil and filters during business hours only. For
questions about hours, call the phone numbers listed below.</P>

<P>Also, if you decide to have your motor oil and filter changed,
please visit one of the locations listed below.</P>

<html><head><title>Home Composting In Mpls</title></head><body>City of Minneapolis, Division of Solid Waste & Recycling <H2>HOME COMPOSTING IN MINNEAPOLIS</H2><HR width=100%>Compost is organic materials (grass clippings, leaves and other food wastes) that have decomposed into a rich soil conditioner.  Composting is the process of combining the right ingredients to make compost.  It's really just a way of "recycling" organic materials.<p>Compost provides many benefits<ul><li>Compost improves the drainage and aeration of clay soils, and reduces the likelihood of waterlogged plants.<li>Compost increases the moisture-holding capacity of sandy soils, and reduces drought damage to plants.<li>Compost helps keep nutrients in the soil near the plant's roots.  <li>Compost keeps soil from crusting on top, thus helping seeds to sprout and water to soak in more easily.</ul><p>Many of your neighbors are already composting, and you can be too!  To make composting easier, this article covers the tools, bins and organic materials you will need; how compost happens; and how to become the envy of your neighbors after your compost is done.<p><a HREF=#but first>A Little History</a><br><a HREF=#compost bins>Compost Bins</a><br><a HREF=#ingredients>Ingredients</a><br><a HREF=#adding materials>Adding Materials to Your Compost Bin</a><br><a HREF=#mixing and turning>Mixing and Turning</a><br><a HREF=#using your compost>Using Your Compost</a><br><a HREF=#troubleshooting>Troubleshooting</a><br><a HREF=#for more information>For More Information on Composting</a><p><HR width=100%><p><a name=but first><b>A LITTLE HISTORY...</b></a><p>Who composted first?  It's hard to know, but the first recorded use of compost was by a Roman statesman, Marcus Cato, over 2,000 years ago!  The Roman empire fell, but composting lives on!<p>In the 1800's, famed agricultural chemist and educator George Washington Carver helped many people understand the nutritional value and great taste of peanuts.  But peanuts were not his only interest; he also taught people of this day that compost was important to gardens, and it saved money.  He said, "make your own fertilizer...compost can be had with little labor and practically no cash outlay".<p><HR width=100%><p><b><a name=compost bins>COMPOST BINS</a></b><p>You don't need a bunch of fancy tools to compost -- just a pitchfork or shovel to turn the compost, a bucket or hose to water the compost, and a compost bin.<p>City of Minneapolis Ordinance requires that compost piles be contained  by some type of compost bin.  Piles without bins can become unsightly and may not be able to generate enough heat.  Many local garden centers or hardware stores have compost bins, or you can make one.<p><ul><li><b>Woven wire bins</b><br>Bins made of woven wire or snow fence are popular because they are inexpensive, simple to build, and easy to move and store.  Steel posts can be used for corner supports.<p><li><b>Turning bins</b> <br>These are a series of two or more bins like the <a HREF="mccomposter.gif">Minneapolis Cedar Frame Composter (29K)</a>.  These bins make turning the compost easier because they give you something to turn the compost into.  And, with a multi-bin composter, you can start new compost while the first batch is still cooking.</ul>Whatever you use, your compost bin should be at least 3'x3'x3' to generate sufficient heat for composting.  City Ordinance prohibits any compost bin larger than 5'x5'x5'.  <p>The space you can have for compost bins is limited by the size of your property as follows:<p><ul><li>Lots less than 5,000 sq. ft. can have up to a total of 125 cubic feet of bins.<li>Lots between 5,000 and 10,000 sq. ft. can have up to a total of 250 cubic feet of bins.<li>Lots of more than 10,000 sq. ft. can have up to a total of 375 cubic feet of bins.</ul><p>Where is a good place to put your compost bin?  In your backyard!!  Partial shading is ideal.  This will keep your compost from drying out to quickly. Avoid placing the bin under the edge of a roof, where rainwater may run off and over-water the pile.  City Ordinance requires that your bin be placed at least one foot from any property line, and 20 feet from any habitable building other than your own home.<p><HR width=100%><p><b><a name=ingredients>INGREDIENTS</a></b><p>Successful composting combines the materials below, in the right proportions, to give microorganisms such bacteria and fungi an environment in which to thrive.  Microorganisms are essential to the composting process and are naturally on "greens" and "browns".<p><b>Greens</b> -- Organic material like grass clippings and garden plants.  Greens are high in nitrogen, and provide the protein microorganisms need to make the compost.<p><b>Browns</b> -- Organic material like leaves, straw, woody plants and woodchips.  Browns are high in carbon and provide the energy source for microorganisms.<p><b>Water</b> -- The material in the compost bin should be like a damp sponge - wet to the touch, so that you get just a drop or so of water when squeezed.  If the compost gets too wet, air will not get to the organisms.  However, without enough water, the organisms will not thrive.<p><b>Oxygen</b> -- Those little microorganisms need to breathe too!  Without enough oxygen your pile may begin to smell.  When you first make your pile there will be enough oxygen. Later, you will add more oxygen to the pile by turning it.<p><b>Other ingredients..the good and the bad</b><p><ul><li>Okay to add -- coffee grounds, crushed egg shells, fruit remains, tea bags,vegetable scraps.<p> Vegetable and fruit scraps are high in nitrogen and moisture and tend to become compacted, so air cannot get to the microorganisms.  Pay special attention if you are composting fruit and vegetables.<p><li>Do <b>not</b> add -- bones, dairy products, fats and oils, grease, meat, pet feces, plastic or synthetic fibers. City of Minneapolis Ordinance prohibits these materials in home composting bins.</ul><p><HR width=100%><p><b><a name=adding materials>ADDING MATERIALS TO YOUR COMPOST BIN</a></b><p>Layering the bin:<p><ul>Step 1: Start with a 2"-3" layer of small sticks or wood chips or a 4"-8" layer of browns.  This will help air flow up through the pile.<p>Step 2: Add a 4"-8" layer of greens and moisten.<p>Step 3: Add a 4"-8" layer of browns and moisten.  <br>Tip: Break up sticks before you place them in the pile.  Long sticks make turning the pile difficult, and smaller pieces will break down quicker.<p>Step 4: Sprinkle on a thin layer of soil or finished compost.<p>Step 5: Repeat steps two through four until the bin is full.<p>If you already have greens and browns mixed together, you can combine steps 2 and 3.</ul>After a few days, your pile will begin to heat up as the microorganisms thrive and your pile begins to decompose. Ideally, your pile should heat to about 140-160 degrees to kill weed seeds or diseases in garden plants. (Your bin must be at least 3'x3'x3' and have the right mix of ingredients in order to heat up properly.)<p><HR width=100%><p><b><a name=mixing and turning>MIXING AND TURNING</a></b><p>The frequency that you mix the compost depends on how quickly you want a compost product.  The more the materials are mixed, the more air will get to the microorganisms, and the faster they will be able to decompose the materials.<p>When mixing the pile, be sure to:<ul><li>Turn the materials at the outside or the edges of the to the inside, so that all the material will be properly heated and composted.<br><li>If your pile is not moist like a damp sponge, be sure to add water as you turn the pile.</ul><p>After you turn the pile, the heat will increase, and peak after 4 to 7 days.  To maintain a hot pile (one that is rapidly decomposing) turn the pile each time it begins to cool.<p>After being turned several times,  the pile will no longer heat up -- the work of the microorganisms is done.  Just let your compost pile sit as insects and earthworms complete the job.<p>How long will it take?  That's up to you.  Finished compost can be made in as fast as one month under ideal conditions, or as long as 12 to 24 months.  The time it takes depends on how often you turn the compost, the balance of greens and browns, and the moisture level.<p><HR width=100%><p><b><a name=using your compost>USING YOUR COMPOST</a></b><p>There are a variety of ways you an use your finished compost.:<ul><b>A Soil Enrichment in Vegetable and Flower Gardens</b><br>Add from 1"-3" of compost to your soil and work it in well.  Adding compost will help soil keep nutrients near the plants roots.<p><b>A Mulch Around Trees, Shrubs, or Plants</b><br>Apply a 3"-6" layer of compost around the base.  Compost makes an ideal mulch for annual and perennial gardens.<p>Compost used as a mulch will help suppress weeds, reduce soil erosion, modify the soil temperature, and conserve soil moisture.  Compost will also make a cozy home for earthworms, who help aerate the soil.<p><b>A Substitute for Peat Moss</b><br>Mix one part compost and two parts potting soil.  Compost will add nutrient value to your potting soil.<p><b>Compost Tea</b><br>Compost can also help you get a nutrient-rich liquid fertilizer.  Place some compost in a gunny sack or similar bag of loose woven fabric.  Soak the bag in a barrel or bucket of rain water for three days.  Use this to water your plants.  It will feed them and stimulate growth.</ul><p><HR width=100%><p><b><a name=troubleshooting>TROUBLESHOOTING</a></b><p>Composting is pretty low tech, but you may encounter a few problems at first.  Here are some common problems and solutions:<p><ul><b>The compost has a bad odor</b><br>Solution: There is not enough air/too wet.  Mix the pile, or add dry materials to the pile.<p><b>Pile is not composting quickly</b>.<br>Solution: Pile may have dried out.  Mix the pile and moisten as you turn the compost.<p><b>The compost is moist and sweet smelling but still won't heat up</b><br>Solution: Not enough greens.  Add a nitrogen source like grass clippings or nitrogen fertilizer.<p><b>The compost is damp and warm only in the middle</b><br>Solution: Pile is too small.  Be sure your pile is at least 3'x3'x3'.<p><b>Unwanted pests are attracted to the pile</b><br>Solution: They smell food scraps.  Stop adding food scraps, or bury them deep inside the pile.<p><b>Unwanted pests are nesting in the pile</b><br>Solution: Turn the pile.<p><b>Neighbors keep asking why your garden looks so great</b><br>Solution: They don't compost.  Show them your compost bin, your compost and share this article with them.</ul><p><HR width=100%><p><b><a name=for more information>FOR MORE INFORMATION ON COMPOSTING...</a></b><p>Here are a few of the many books about composting available.  :<p>"Backyard Composting: Your complete guide to recycling yard clippings" by Harmonius Technologies.<p>"Let it rot!  The Gardener's Guide to Composting" by Stu Campbell.<p>"Rodale Guide to Composting" Jerry Minnich and Marjorie Hunt.<p>If you are interested in vermicomposting Mary Appelhof's, "Worms Eat My Garbage" is a good reference.<p>For more information about composting, you can also call the Minnesota Extension Service of Hennepin County at 374-8400.<p><p><HR width=100%><p><b>THANKS</b><p> For inspiration and great information about composting, we  thank the Seattle Solid Waste Utility, King County, Washington,  the City of Plymouth, and the Minnesota Extension Service of Hennepin County.<p><HR width=100%>Updated 3/6/96</body></html>

<P>The Office of Budget &amp; Evaluation administers a financial planning,
budgeting, and program evaluation system that provides the information that
allows policy officials to determine the appropriate level of government services
to be provided by City departments and agencies, and allows them to allocate
public funds needed to provide these services in the most efficient and effective
manner possible. The City budget is made up of several parts. Of particular
interest to citizens are the Operating, Community Development Block Grant,
Capital, and Year of the City budgets.

<H3><BR>City of Minneapolis Budget Process</H3>

<P>The City of Minneapolis has a budget review process which integrates
departmental performance with budget review in a year-round continuum of
events.

<P>The Office of Budget &amp; Evaluation prepares a budget calendar, which includes
a process for reviewing each department's operational performance from the
previous year. City departments appear before their appropriate City Council
policy committee to report on their accomplishments in the previous year as well
as to indicate anticipated changes in their current year activities that were not
reflected in the performance information reviewed during their budget
hearings.

<P>Departments with capital improvement or Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) programs, as well as community service organizations seeking CDBG funds,
submit all those requests in April and May. By mid-June, all <A
HREF="/departments/index.html">City departments</A>, the <A
HREF="/departments/other/library.html">Library Board</A>, the <A
HREF="/departments/other/parks.html">Park &amp; Recreation Board</A>, the Municipal
Building Commission and the <A HREF="/departments/other/mcda.html">Community
Development Agency</A> submit their operating budget requests. Decision packages
are prepared which describe policy changes or alternatives requested by
departments or proposed by the budget staff. In July, these decision packages
form the basis for the Mayor's budget hearing with department heads.

<P>The Mayor's budget includes recommendations for the <A
HREF="/departments/other/parks.html">Park Board</A> and <A
HREF="/departments/other/library.html">Library Board</A>, <A
HREF="/departments/other/mcda.html">Community Development Agency</A>, <A
HREF="/departments/other/mpha.html">Public Housing Authority</A> and Municipal
Building Commission. State law requires local governments to establish maximum
tax levies for the coming year by September 15. Next year's budget will be
presented a few weeks prior to this deadline in order for the City's independent
boards and commissions to react to this proposal before the <A
HREF="/departments/other/taxation.html">Board of Estimate &amp; Taxation</A> sets
the maximum levy amounts.

<P><A HREF="/departments/city-council/index.html">City Council</A> hearings on
the proposed budget occur in mid-October. State law now requires that city
budgets be adopted at a public hearing. Like the maximum tax levy, this date must
also be established by September 15 although the hearing cannot be held before
November 29. The independent boards and commissions adopt their own operating
budgets, although the <A HREF="/departments/city-council/index.html">City
Council</A> and <A HREF="/departments/mayor/index.html">Mayor</A> decide what
level of local government aid and bonding authority they will receive in most
instances.

<P>Once the final budget resolutions are adopted, all requests from <A
HREF="/departments/index.html">City departments</A> for additional funds or
positions made throughout the year are brought before the <A
HREF="/departments/city-council/index.html">City Council</A> for approval as
amendments to the original budget resolutions.

<P>The City Council governs Minneapolis through its legislative, administrative,
and financial power over many City functions. The Council levies taxes, enacts
ordinances and resolutions, licenses businesses, and exercises budgetary and
policy control over <A HREF="/departments/index.html">City departments</A>.

<P>Council Members represent the interests of their constituents. They respond to
inquiries, suggestions and complaints regarding City programs and services and
meet regularly with constituents to discuss developments affecting the ward that
they represent and the City as a whole.

<P>The 13 Council Members are elected by ward for four-year terms. Ward
boundaries are adjusted after each federal census so that there is no more than a
five percent difference in population among the wards. The Council elects its own
officers. The Council President chairs its meetings and acts as mayor if the <A
HREF="/departments/mayor/index.html">Mayor</A> is out of town or incapacitated.

<P>The Council meets twice monthly on Fridays at 9:30 a.m. according to a
calendar approved at the beginning of each year and may hold additional meetings.
Its meetings, and those of Council committees, are open to the public. Meeting
schedules are published weekly in the <CITE>Minneapolis Star Tribune</CITE>,
<CITE>Finance and Commerce</CITE>, and the <CITE>Minneapolis Labor Review</CITE>.

<P>The Council adopts ordinances that provide for the government and order of the
City. They serve a variety of purposes, including licensing, regulating public
and private activities, controlling the uses of property, preventing crime, and
generally ensuring public health and welfare. The Council adopts resolutions to
express policy or to direct certain administrative actions. The Council also
passes on assessments, submits annual tax levy statements and has charge of City
elections.

<P>The Council functions with committees. Departments report to the Council
through an assigned committee. Committee recommendations are forwarded to the
full Council for its consideration. Council actions then go to the <A
HREF="/departments/mayor/index.html">Mayor</A> for approval or veto. Council
standing committees are Community Development; Intergovernmental Relations;
Public Safety and Regulatory Services; Transportation and Public Works; Ways and
Means/Budget; Zoning and Planning; and Claims. It has several special committees
including Rules, Taxes and Elections. Each standing committee meets during the
two weeks preceding the Council's biweekly meeting. The only exception is Claims,
which meets once a month.

<P>The Minneapolis Civilian Police Review Authority investigates complaints of
misconduct against Minneapolis police officers. The authority, which is
completely independent of the <A
HREF="/departments/police/index.html">Minneapolis Police Department</A>, has its
own staff of investigators. If complaints are sustained after the investigation
and after an administrative hearing, the authority sends its findings to the
Chief of Police for appropriate discipline of the officers involved. Upon the
agreement of the complainant and the officer, the complaint may be resolved in
mediation.

<P>Both victims and witnesses of alleged police misconduct may file a complaint.
Misconduct includes excessive force, inappropriate language or attitude, theft by
an officer, harassment, failure to provide adequate or timely police protection,
or discrimination on the basis of protected-class status.

<P>The Emergency Communications Center (ECC) is staffed 24 hours a day every day
of the year. The ECC receives calls from citizens via both <B>9-1-1</B> and
conventional telephone numbers. Calls are screened to determine the need for
police, fire, and/or ambulance assistance and if a response is necessary,
department staff takes steps to dispatch the proper City <A
HREF="/departments/police/index.html">police</A> or <A
HREF="/departments/fire/index.html">fire</A> personnel.

<P>The department uses a call prioritization and classification system to insure
that those needing help most urgently get the fastest possible response. This is
necessary because during periods of peak activity, there are often more calls
awaiting service than there are available police squad cars to send.

<P>An advanced computer system is used to help employees inventory the calls that
are received and organize them for dispatch and later retrieval. All telephone
and radio conversations involving ECC operations are tape recorded and strict
attention to accuracy, speed and quality are maintained. More than 80 civilian
employees staff the ECC.

<P>ECC also provides Tele-serv, a system whereby the victims of crimes such as
thefts can make reports via telephone of crimes that do not require a police
response to the scene.

<P><I><B>NOTE:</B> As of January 1, 1996, the Tele-serv unit has been placed
under the <A HREF="/departments/police/index.html">Minneapolis Police
Department</A>.  The transfer of Tele-serv will be phased in over the next couple
of months.</I>

<P>Tours of the ECC are available by arrangement.

<P>As required by the City Charter, the Board of Estimate &amp; Taxation holds
public hearings to obtain citizen input relating to setting the maximum tax
levies for certain tax funds in the City. The board reviews selected City
department budgets and after receiving recommendations from the <A
HREF="/departments/mayor/index.html">Mayor</A> and <A
HREF="/departments/city-council/index.html">City Council</A>, sets the maximum
tax levies for the following funds:

<UL>
	<P><LI><A HREF="/departments/city-council/index.html">City Council</A>:
	General Fund, Permanent Improvement Fund, Police Personnel Expansion Fund.

	<P><LI><A HREF="/departments/other/parks.html">Park and Recreation Board</A>:
	Park and Recreation Fund, Tree Preservation and Reforestation Fund, Park
	Rehabilitation and Parkway Maintenance Fund, Shade Tree Disease Control Fund,
	Lake Pollution Control Fund.

	<P><LI><A HREF="/departments/other/library.html">Library Board</A>: Library
	General Fund.

	<P><LI><A HREF="/departments/other/mpha.html">Public Housing Authority</A>:
	Public Housing Fund.

	<P><LI>Board of Estimate &amp; Taxation: Estimate and Taxation Fund.
</UL>

<P><EM><B>NOTE:</B> The Fire Department Relief Association, Police Relief
Association, Municipal Employees Retirement Fund, and Building Commission Funds
are not subject to the Board's maximum tax levies.</EM>

<P>The Board also participates in the overall debt management policy of the City
and issues General Obligation Bonds of the City in support of the Capital Program
(excluding Tax Increment Bonds).

<P>The Board staff is responsible for preparation of the Official Statement
except Appendix A. They assist in preparation of responses to rating agency
inquiries. They prepare self-supporting debt documentations and are involved in
pre- and post-bond-sale activities.

<P>The Board is responsible for the Internal Audit function of the City, as
defined in Chapter 17.80 of the <CITE>Minneapolis City Charter and Code of
Ordinance</CITE>. It identifies internal audit areas covering City departments,
boards and commissions, and provides audit programs to establish guidelines,
policies, and procedures for the conduct of periodic internal audits. It
initiates investigations of alleged or suspected impropriety, misappropriation
and other misuse of City funds. When requested, the Board provides assistance to
City departments for evaluation of financial controls or other special projects
and assists outside auditors.

<P>The Board is responsible in determining if a project is related to the <A
HREF="/departments/city-coordinator/operations/convention.html">Convention
Center</A> and therefore eligible for the use of sales taxes.

<P>The Board consists of seven members: the Mayor or designate, the City Council
President, the chairman of the Ways and Means/Budget Committee, a commissioner of
the Park and Recreation Board, a trustee of the Library Board and two members
elected city-wide for four-year terms.

<P>The support staff for this Board consists of an executive secretary to the
Board and an internal auditor.

<P>The Minneapolis Fire Department has five main areas of service responsibility:
fighting fires, fire investigations, fire safety inspections, fire prevention,
and emergency medical service.

<H3><BR>Fighting Fires</H3>

<P>The Fire Department has about 430 firefighters assigned to 20 stations located
throughout the City, with at least 109 firefighters working every day. Each
station responds to calls within its own response zone and may assist in
responding to calls within a larger district (there are four districts in the
City). The department's typical response to an alarm is three engine companies
(smaller trucks), two ladder companies (larger trucks), and a battalion chief.
Additional resources may be called in for multiple alarm fires. The first company
out of a station attempts to respond to an alarm within six minutes (the average
response time is 3.5 minutes).

<H3><BR>Fire Investigations</H3>

<P>The Fire Department has four investigators who examine every reported fire to
determine its cause/origin and the extent of loss. If the department determines
that arson is the cause of a fire, the <A
HREF="/departments/police/index.html">Minneapolis Police Department</A> conducts
the ensuing investigation.

<H3><BR>Fire Safety Inspections</H3>

<P>The Fire Department has six inspectors who strive to carry out annual fire
safety inspections of existing properties in the following categories: apartment,
condominium, commercial, office, service, storage and school. Auditoriums and
churches are inspected on a seasonal basis. Inspections are also carried out for
new construction and for any other properties requiring a City permit, license,
or certificate. Other inspections are carried out in response to a complaint or
referral. If a code violation is noted, a follow-up inspection is made to check
for compliance with departmental regulations.

<H3><BR>Fire Safety Education</H3>

<P>The Fire Department has two full-time employees involved in fire-safety
education and planning: in schools, day-care centers and hospitals; with block
and neighborhood groups; and in response to requests for information from
individual Minneapolis residents. The department's Junior Fire Program, for
instance, involved 3,659 fifth-grade children at 49 public elementary schools
during the 1992-93 school year. The &quot;Safe Escape House&quot; (a mobile,
fire-safety instruction unit) is frequently used at block and neighborhood
gatherings to teach children how to safely escape from a building that is on
fire.

<H3><BR>Emergency Medical Service</H3>

<P>Fire Department personnel stationed at the 20 Minneapolis fire stations are
also trained Emergency Medical Technicians. Technicians at each station respond
to calls within their fire-fighting response zone. The average response time is
3.5 minutes.

<P>The Minneapolis Department of Health has three main areas of service
responsibility: personal health, public health nursing, and environmental
health.

<H3><BR>Personal Health</H3>
<P>The Health Department offers a variety of direct-care services to
income-eligible people at a downtown clinic and at satellite community and
high-school clinics. These clinics offer health care to mothers, teens, and
children; dental care; family planning services; and laboratory tests (e.g.,
blood, urine) for health problems and marriage licenses.

<P>The Health Department also provides general health information and encourages
health and wellness activities. Most of these services are free. Examples
include: worksite and school programs on AIDS; radio and TV public-service
announcements; brochures and posters; and health films, videos and literature.
Health educators are also available to speak about health-related topics.

<H3><BR>Public Health Nursing</H3>
<P>The Health Department provides home visits by nurses, home health aides, and
other specialists for residents who are unable to visit a clinic or who require
special assistance. Other services include training for care givers and
self-care; consultations for child-care programs; and organizing group
activities, especially for developing parenting skills.

<H3><BR>Environmental Health</H3>

<DL>
	<DT><B>Housing Hygiene</B>
	<DD>This program's task is to investigate sanitation and pest-related
	complaints in multiple family dwellings and single-family homes. The
	sanitarians are also involved in &quot;neighborhood sweeps,&quot; in which
	all properties in a neighborhood are inspected for compliance with a variety
	of City regulations: health, fire, building, etc. If a violation is noted, a
	follow-up inspection is made to check for compliance with City regulations.

	<DT><BR><B>Food Protection</B>
	<DD>The Health Department has sanitarians who strive to make regular
	inspections of food-oriented businesses and institutions. Sanitarians also
	make inspections in response to complaints from patrons or employees of such
	businesses. If a violation is noted, a follow-up inspection is made to check
	for compliance with City regulations.

	<DT><BR><B>Animal Control</B>
	<DD>The Health Department has animal-control wardens who minimize the risk of
	bites and rabies for residents by picking up stray animals. The department
	makes periodic patrols in neighborhoods that are prone to stray-animal and
	other violations of animal-control ordinances, sells animal licenses, and
	operates the animal shelter. Wardens are also available for group
	presentations.

	<DT><BR><B>Other</B>
	<DD>Other environmental health services include periodic monitoring of water
	quality (wells, lakes, rivers, and public and commercial swimming pools);
	inspecting tattoo parlors, dry-cleaning establishments and tanning parlors;
	and responding to complaints of carbon monoxide, asbestos, lead, and
	violations of the Clean Indoor Air Act.

<A NAME="insp-zon">
<H3><BR>Zoning Administration</H3>

<P>The Zoning section is the first stop for anyone who wants to know if their
proposed use of a particular parcel of land is allowable. If the proposed use is
consistent with existing zoning ordinances, the next step is submission of
construction plans to the Plan Review section. If the proposed use is not
consistent with existing zoning ordinances, the applicant will be scheduled for a
public hearing by the Planning Commission for a rezoning or a conditional use
permit, or by the Board of Adjustment for a variation or an appeal.

<A NAME="insp-pln">
<H3><BR>Plan Review</H3>

<P>After Zoning has approved the proposed land use, two sets of construction
plans are submitted to the Plan Review section in order to secure a permit for
new construction, expansion or remodeling. The Plan Review section determines
compliance with local ordinances and applicable state building and mechanical
codes.

<A NAME="insp-per">
<H3><BR>Permit Issuance</H3>

<P>The Permit Issuance section issue permits for most work regarding building,
electrical, plumbing, and heating for contractors and the general public. This
includes the collection and handling of all permit fees. The section also
provides information about which projects require a permit, how to go about
getting a permit, and how much the permit costs.

<A NAME="insp-con">
<H3><BR>Construction Inspection</H3>

<P>The inspectors who make up the Construction Inspections section are
categorized by their areas of expertise: building, electrical, elevator,
mechanical, and plumbing. As part of the construction permit process, inspectors
are required to ensure that the work being done meets code and follows the
approved plan. More than one inspection may be performed during construction if
work does not meet code requirements, if the job is particularly complex, or if
it involves more than one area of expertise. Inspections can be scheduled by
calling the inspector's mobile phone number directly. To obtain an inspector's
phone number, please call the appropriate section listed below:

<P>Each of the field inspectors in the Housing Inspection section of the <A
HREF="index.html">Inspections</A> division is assigned a district within the
City. Housing inspectors respond to referrals from <A
HREF="/departments/city-council/index.html">City Council</A> members, other City
agencies, and interested citizens that a particular property in their district is
in violation of the <CITE>Housing Maintenance Code</CITE>. A copy of the
Maintenance Code is available for &#36;5 from the Inspections Office, (612)
673-5890, or is free to view at the <A
HREF="/departments/other/library.html#lib-mil">Municipal Information Library</A>,
City Hall, or the <A HREF="/departments/other/library.html#lib-ctr">Central
Public Library</A> downtown.

<P>Owners of properties found to be in violation of the code will be issued a
letter describing the violation(s), specifying a timeline for correction of the
problem and a date for reinspection. This letter is called an &#34;order.&#34; If
the problem is not corrected in the specified time, a binding final notice will
be issued. Nuisance orders have short due dates. Major repairs are given more
time. The next step could be a violation tag with court action and fine to gain
compliance. In most cases, owners correct the problem upon receipt of the first
notice, or set a timetable for completion.

<P>Housing Inspectors look for:

<DL>
	<DT><B>Alley/sidewalk</B>
	<DD>Growth and vegetation that hangs over the edge of the public alley or
	public sidewalk must be cut and removed. A clearance of seven feet over
	public sidewalks and 14 feet over public alleys is required.

	<DT><BR><B>Garbage and litter</B>
	<DD>Each property should have adequate trash containers, and the property
	should be free of trash, garbage and debris. If a nuisance condition exists
	and is not corrected in the time allotted, inspectors will order proper
	disposal and may authorize a contractor to correct the problem and assess the
	costs to the owner.

	<DT><BR><B>General disrepair</B>
	<DD>Buildings that lack paint, have broken windows and rotting wood, broken
	steps or guardrails, and missing bricks in walls and chimneys will be issued
	orders.

	<DT><BR><B>Graffiti</B>
	<DD>Owners will be asked to paint over or remove graffiti marks painted on
	their property. For information on graffiti removal, call the Graffiti
	Hotline, (612) 673-2090.

	<DT><BR><B>Grass/weeds</B>
	<DD>All tall grass and weeds over eight inches in height must be cut and
	removed from your property. This includes all boulevards, side yards, and
	along alleys.

	<DT><BR><B>Inoperable vehicles</B>
	<DD>Inoperable or junk vehicles that have missing wheels or engines, broken
	windows, or out-of-date registrations will be tagged and towed.

	<DT><BR><B>Missing or unreadable addresses</B>
	<DD>Visible and readable house numbers are required for identification by
	emergency vehicles. Numbers must be on the front of the home or in the rear
	if there is an alley access.

	<DT><BR><B>Parking in yard</B>
	<DD>Vehicles may not be parked in yards or on unpaved surfaces; vehicles must
	be parked within the garage or on a hard-surfaced driveway. The number of
	vehicles outside a garage is also limited.

	<DT><BR><B>Poor housing hygiene</B>
	<DD>Inspectors will refer homes which may have extremely unhealthy conditions
	-- such as excessive or improperly stored garbage, rats, roaches, or other
	situations that may cause a health hazard -- to the <A
	HREF="/departments/city-coordinator/operations/health.html">Health
	Department</A>.

	<DT><BR><B>Storage of Large Items</B>
	<DD>Property owners who store large appliances, tires, or used motor oils and
	petroleum products on their property may be issued an order. Owners who have
	City service are advised to call <A
	HREF="/departments/public-works/solid-waste/index.html">Public Works/Solid
	Waste & Recycling</A>, (612) 522-6644, to inquire about (1) a special pick-up
	of large items such as refrigerators and freezers; and/or (2) a dumping
	voucher for tires (limit of one voucher per property per year and a maximum
	of four tires per voucher). Oil products must be disposed of properly and not
	in garbage containers or on streets, alleys or lawns. Free oil disposal is
	available at these City garages from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday:
	3607 44 St E; 2710 Pacific St N; 1308 Currie Av N; 1809 Washington St NE;
	6036 Harriet Av S; and 1911 26 St E (24 hours).

	<DT><BR><B>Unlicensed businesses</B>
	<DD>Illegal businesses will be reported to the proper authorities.
</DL>

<P>Other departments respond to health hazards such as rats, mice, roaches, and
lead paint (<A HREF="/departments/city-coordinator/operations/health.html">Health
Department</A>, (612) 673-2301) or asbestos (State Abatement, (612) 627-2170).

<H3><BR>CONDEMNATIONS</H3>

<P>When one or more of the following conditions exist, a condemnation may take
place:

<UL>
	<LI>A building is vacant and boarded.
	<LI>A building is determined to be unsafe; an inspector cites specific
	hazards.
	<LI>A building is dilapidated; no specific hazards are cited but the
	inspector has assigned the property a score qualifying it for condemnation.
	<LI>Utilities to a building have been discontinued.
	<LI>There is a housing hygiene problem (conducted by the <A
	HREF="/departments/city-coordinator/operations/health.html">Health
	Department</A>).
</UL>

<P>In rare situations, an individual dwelling unit in a multi-unit building may
be condemned if it does not endanger the remaining structure.

<H3><BR>REINSPECTION FEE ORDINANCE (Minneapolis Ordinance 244.190)</H3>

<P>The reinspection fee ordinance was passed on December 10, 1992. The intent of
this ordinance is to gain compliance of housing orders and to save resources. For
information on the ordinance, call (612) 673-3701; for information on
reinspection fee billing, call (612) 673-5864.

<H3><BR>RENTAL HOUSING</H3>

<P>Effective January 1, 1991, rental housing units with the City became subject
to a rental license ordinance. The intent of the ordinance is to:

<UL>
	<LI>Promote the health, safety, and welfare of the general public.
	<LI>Assure preservation of the existing housing supply.
	<LI>Help maintain property values.
	<LI>Work toward eliminating substandard and deteriorating rental housing.
	<LI>Maintain a living environment that contributes to healthful individual
	and family living.
</UL>

<P>The ordinance requires that every rental dwelling, including single-family
rental dwellings and rental units in owner-occupied duplexes, and rooming and
shared-bath units (unless they are in a licensed lodging house) must have a
license. For information on the licensing process, call (612) 673-3701.

<P>The Intergovernmental Relations Department has a federal legislative liaison,
a state legislative liaison, and a local government relations representative.

<P>The federal liaison lobbies the federal legislative process to maximize the
advantages to the City resulting from federal programs. The federal liaison
communicates regularly with federal elected officials and local elected
officials, exchanging information to keep them up-to-date with issues that have
an impact on the City. The federal liaison also provides information about
federal bills, hearings, regulations, reports, studies, agencies, national
organizations, and Congressional and Cabinet members.

<P>The state liaison coordinates the representation of the City before the state
government. The state liaison analyzes and researches legislative proposals,
proposes policy alternatives to the IGR Committee, keeps elected officials and
department heads informed of legislative activity, summarizes legislative
enactments affecting the City, and identifies future major issues on which the
City should take a position.

<P>The local government relations representative acts as a liaison with
metropolitan and local units of government. Metropolitan governments include the
Metro Council and the regional operating commissions. Local units of government
include both other cities and <A HREF="http://www.co.hennepin.mn.us">Hennepin
County</A>. This function also includes participation in such organizations as
the Association of Metropolitan Municipalities and the League of Minnesota
Cities. This position provides policy analysis on infrastructure issues,
financial issues, parks, recycling, and other issues.

<P>The Minneapolis Public Library, as the city's pivotal information, education,
and cultural resource, is a source of community pride and economic stimulation.
The library selects, organizes, preserves, and makes accessible books and other
materials of current interest and permanent value, upholding the public's right
to know by providing people of all ages access to information and collections
that reflect all points of view. In a democratic society that depends on the free
flow of information, the library system, with its central facility and community
locations, is the key public institution and most visible symbol of democracy and
the importance of education, lifelong learning and intellectual freedom in the
City of Minneapolis.

<P>The library is governed by an independent board of trustees. Six are elected
at large for four-year terms and two are appointed for two-year terms by the <A
HREF="/departments/mayor/index.html">Mayor</A> and <A
HREF="/departments/city-council/index.html">City Council</A>. The board is
responsible for overseeing the establishment, management, and maintenance of
public libraries in the City of Minneapolis and has the authority to levy a tax
for the support of the library system. The board also appoints the director, who
administers and coordinates the operation of the library within the basic goals,
objectives, policies and principles approved by the Library Board. Anyone
interested in contacting a member of the Library Board may call the director's
office, (612) 372-6611.

<P>The Minneapolis library system consists of the Central Library at Fourth
Street and Nicollet Mall, 14 community libraries and a municipal reference
library at City Hall. The library's collection numbers over two million books
plus over 800,000 government documents and 150,000 nonprint items. During 1993,
there were 3,226,596 borrower transactions in the library system, and librarians
responded to 3,275,728 requests for information (2,074,921 requests were made in
person; 1,200,808 were made by telephone).

<A NAME="lib-ctr"><H3><BR>Central Library</H3></A>

<P>With more than 1.5 million books, over 2,700 magazine subscriptions and 75
different newspapers, the Central Library is the largest public library in the
state. Only about 16 percent of these materials are visible on open shelves. The
rest are shelved in nonpublic areas and may be requested at the service desks.
Special Collections, housed on the upper floors of the building, include rare
books and materials about Minneapolis. The Central Library collection is

	<P><LI>Response to citizen concerns about City affairs.

	<P><LI>Other initiatives.

	<P><LI>The Mayor's Office has occasionally housed new initiatives which

	existence after serving their function. The office currently houses the
	Neighborhood Employment Network. Its operations are funded with non-city
	funds.

<P>The Minneapolis Police Department is organized into four bureaus: the
Patrol Bureau, the Investigative Bureau, the Internal Services Bureau, and
the Community Services Bureau.</P>

<H2><BR>
Police Bureaus</H2>

<DL>
  <DT><B>Patrol Bureau</B>
  <DD>The Patrol Bureau provides general patrol and traffic law enforcement
  services. Most of the Patrol Bureau personnel are assigned to one of the
  four Minneapolis Police precinct stations, each of which is responsible
  for a sector (or precinct) of the city. Patrol duties include response
  to emergency and non-emergency requests for police service, prevention
  and deterrence of crime, offender apprehension, initial investigation and
  evidence gathering, and maintenance of order in the community. Twenty-five
  Patrol Bureau personnel are assigned exclusively to traffic law enforcement.
  Their duties include response to personal injury vehicular accidents, maintenance
  of proper traffic control and flow throughout the city, and the issuance
  of traffic violation citations to encourage compliance with existing traffic
  laws.
  <DT><BR>
  <B>Investigative Bureau</B>
  <DD>The Investigative Bureau is comprised of approximately 200 employees
  who are divided into four specific divisions: CID I, Crimes Against Persons;
  CID II, Crimes Against Property; Special Investigations Division, e.g.,
  Narcotics, Vice, Intelligence, Gang, License; and the Juvenile Division.
  <DT><BR>
  <B>Internal Services Bureau</B>
  <DD>The Internal Services Bureau is comprised of work specialists who perform
  various internal support functions for the department such as:
  <UL>
    <LI>Selection and training of personnel
    <LI>Fiscal control of departmental operations
    <LI>Maintenance of central police records
    <LI>Provision of criminal identification information
    <LI>Statistical analysis of crime trends
    <LI>Crime laboratory/criminologistics support
  </UL>
  <DT><BR>
  <B>Community Services Bureau</B>
  <DD>The Community Services Bureau includes SAFE, Crime Prevention, and
  RECAP (Repeat Complaint Address Policy). SAFE/CCP provides teams of police
  officers and crime prevention specialists to work in neighborhoods to:
  <UL>
    <LI>Strengthen community by organizing networks of residents such as block
    clubs, apartment networks, and other resident connections.
    <LI>Develop and implement crime prevention strategies with residents.
    <LI>Work with residents to solve neighborhood problems such as drug houses,
    loud parties, unsupervised problem youth, graffiti, vandalism, and problem
    families.
  </UL>
  <P>The Bureau works cooperatively with other City departments to solve
  problems at both the team level and through the Coordinated Neighborhood
  Action Plan (CNAP). A youth coordinator implements youth crime-prevention
  programs and assists teams in problem solving.
  <P>Other strategies and projects include:
  <UL>
    <LI>Personal safety workshops
    <LI>Home security demonstrations
    <LI>McGruff Safe Houses
    <LI>Mediation
    <LI>Leader training
    <LI>Crime Alert Bulletins

<P>The Minneapolis Public Housing Authority (MPHA) manages and maintains
approximately 6,700 housing units in Minneapolis, including scattered sites
(individual homes) and more than 5,000 apartments in 42 highrises. More than
10,000 residents live in public housing, many of them elderly or handicapped,
most of them on limited incomes. The MPHA strives to increase available,
affordable housing for low- and middle-income families, upgrade and preserve
existing housing, and promote neighborhood revitalization by encouraging resident
involvement and social activities.

<P>The MPHA also administers the federal Section 8 rent-subsidy program, which
qualifies tenants who meet certain guidelines to live in either privately-owned,
market-rate rental housing or housing built or rehabbed through Section 8.
Participants pay 30 percent of their income for rent and utilities.

<P>The MPHA is directed by a Board of Commissioners consisting of nine members,
of which two are public housing residents. The MPHA is administered by an
executive director.

<P>The mission of the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority is to provide
well-managed, high-quality housing for eligible families and individuals; to
increase the supply of affordable rental housing in the metropolitan area; and to
assist public housing residents in realizing their personal goals for economic
independence and self-sufficiency.

<P>Approximately 97&#37; of the MPHA's funding is provided through federal
subsidies and rents. The remaining 3&#37; is provided by the City of Minneapolis.

<P>The Public Works Department has a number of areas of service responsibility.
The following list includes some of the more visible types of services:

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="#sidewalk">Sidewalk Inspection</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#str-fix">Street Maintenance and Repair</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#str-cln">Street Cleaning</A>

</UL>

<A NAME="sidewalk"><H3><BR>SIDEWALK INSPECTION</H3></A>

<P>The Public Works Department has divided Minneapolis into three
sidewalk-inspection districts, with one inspector assigned to each district. Each
inspector visually inspects sidewalk sections for major cracks, hazardous
conditions and general deterioration from May 1 to Nov. 1. If a repair is deemed
necessary, the property owner has 15 days in which to respond. If there is no
response, a City-approved contractor makes the repair and the property owner is
billed for the work. The property owner can either pay the bill or have the cost
assessed over five years. Inspectors strive to carry out routine inspections of
all sidewalks every seven to eight years. Other inspections are made in response
to complaints from residents or other City personnel.

<P>The Sidewalk Department is also responsible for enforcement of the snow
shoveling ordinance. Commercial properties are required to remove snow within
four daylight hours. Residential properties must clear their sidewalks within 24
hours.

<P>Sidewalk Department: (612) 673-2441

<A NAME="str-fix"><H3><BR>STREET MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR</H3></A>

<P>To maintain Minneapolis streets, Public Works Department personnel perform the
following repairs: 1) pothole filling, 2) crack filling, 3) seal coating, and 4)
thin overlays. Various criteria are used to determine which type or combination
of repairs are best suited for a given situation. Most repairs can only be made
during warmer months. The Department strives to carry out routine inspections of
all streets and alleys every year. They will also investigate any complaints they
receive of problems in streets and alleys.

<P>Street Maintenance: (612) 673-5720

<A NAME="str-cln"><H3><BR>STREET CLEANING</H3></A>

<P>To keep streets free of litter and other debris, Public Works Department
personnel perform the following cleaning services: 1) a complete sweeping of all
streets and alleys each spring (typically mid-April to May); 2) the
<A HREF="sweepoct.html">collection of leaves and sweeping of all streets each fall</A>
(typically late October to
mid-November); 3) night sweeping of streets and alleys in central business
district approximately twice per week if weather permits; 4) targeted sweeping of
other commercial areas and some residential streets on an as needed basis
throughout the summer; 5) miscellaneous sweeping and cleaning (i.e. after an
extraordinary storm or special event); and 6) catch-basin and drain cleaning as
required.

<P>Street Maintenance: (612) 673-5720

<A NAME="snow"><H3><BR>SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL</H3></A>

<P>The Public Works Department provides snow and ice control on all City streets
and alleys. In general, at least four inches of snow must fall before a snow
emergency is declared. Snow plowing activities are prioritized as follows: 1)
snow emergency routes, 2) alleys, and 3) residential streets.

<P>The appendix contains information on parking restrictions during a snow
emergency.

<P>Snow and ice removal personnel also provide the following services on an
as-needed basis:

<UL>
	<LI>Clear sidewalks and parking lots of City-owned buildings.
	<LI>Sand arterial and residential streets and alleys.
	<LI>Open frozen or clogged storm drains.
	<LI>Clear bus stops.
	<LI>Clear corners.
	<LI>Remove ice from water main break.

<P><A HREF="snow.html">Snow emergency information</A> is available 24 hours/day at (612) 348-SNOW. For
any problems or complaints call (612) 673-5720.

<A NAME="trans"><H3><BR>TRANSPORTATION AND SPECIAL PROJECTS</H3></A>

<P>The Division of Transportation and Special Projects is responsible for transit
operations, the parking system, bicycle operation, movement of pedestrians,
movement of goods, and the safety of people who use the City's transportation
system.

<P>The system consists of over 28,000 street lights, 100,000 signs, 750
intersections with traffic signals, 6400 parking meters, and nine parking ramps.
The Transportation and Special Projects division manages all street uses
throughout the city, including the Impound Lot.

<P>The division is also responsible for the oversight and management of special
construction projects, including four new fire stations, light-rail transit
development, parking ramps and skyways, the Nicollet Mall Extension, and other
special construction projects.

City Clears Snow, Residents Asked to Help</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Minneapolis Public Works crews are working hard
to clean up after the recent snowfalls. Crews continue to clear snow from
street corners, bus stops and alleys. <BR>
<BR>
City residents are also encouraged to help. Keeping key areas of the City
clear of snow and ice helps make winter bearable.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sidewalks</B> Remember that sidewalks around homes and businesses should
be fully cleared. This helps people move about and decreases the risk of
injury. Keep in mind that people with mobility impairments need enough space
to get around. To report unsafe sidewalks, call 673-2420.<BR>
<BR>
Community organizations provide shoveling assistance for a fee. Seniors
and persons physically unable to keep their sidewalks and garbage cart paths
in good winter condition can call 673-3004 for a referral.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Free Sand </B>City residents can pick up free sand to help them keep
sidewalks safe. The sand is available at four street maintenance yards.
They are at 18th and Jefferson St. NE, 121 Glenwood Av N, 6036 Harriet Av
S, and 4444 Snelling Av S. The sand is furnished for the private use of
residents only, not for commercial use. It is accessible outside the yard
gates 24 hours a day seven days a week. Residents must bring their own shovel
and bucket.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Garbage Carts and Fire Hydrants </B>Please help clear snow from around
fire hydrants and shovel a three-foot path around garbage carts and recycling
bins so that City crews can get to them when needed.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Potholes</B> This winter's severe weather has caused some streets to
break up. City crews are making temporary repairs to the worst potholes
and are encouraging people to drive with caution. To report dangerous potholes,
call 673-5720.</FONT><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>

Home Tour Update</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>
The 10th Minneapolis/Saint Paul Home Tour will be Saturday, May 3, and Sunday,
May 4.<BR>
<BR>
The deadline for home nominations is Friday, February 14. Owner-occupied
homes of all kinds are needed. In particular, the tour seeks nominations
from owners who are people of color or persons with disabilities, and from
owner occupants of two-, three- and four-unit structures. Although new kitchens,
baths and other renovation projects are regularly featured, homes do not
need to be extensively remodeled. Homes will be selected by mid-March. Call
673-2491 for nomination materials.<BR>
<BR>
The tour invites organizations to conduct neighborhood tours on the Home
Tour weekend. Last year's neighborhood tours of Bancroft and Old Highland
were very successful. Organizations that would like to use the Home Tour
to promote themselves to new buyers and to build neighborhood identity should
call soon. Go/no go decisions must be made by February 14. The number is
673-2009.<BR>
<BR>
Become a Friend of the Home Tour. Friends of the Home Tour is new this year.
It recognizes that REALTORS&reg;, contractors and many retail businesses
need a cost-effective way of advertising their services to Home Tour visitors.
The $200 fee covers a business-card-size ad in a flyer handed to Home Tour
visitors, a listing in a quarter-page ad in the Home Tour Guide, 100 words
on the Home Tour website and other benefits. Reservations must be made by
February 14. Call 673-3821 for more information.</FONT><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>

Barbara Fountain Mason, Interfaith Task Force Co-Chair</I><P>There is an incredible gong to the tune of destruction, devastation anddiscord in the cities of our Nation. Nights are filled with pain,misunderstanding and uncertainty while people of good will work towards a bettertomorrow. Consequences of the discord are senseless acts of violence, echoingdissonance in our communities. We listen for peace and harmony only to hear andsee more discontent, deaths of our young, violent acts against the elderly, anddissolution of family structure.<P>Well, be of good cheer! There is good news! Discord can be turned to harmony.The Interfaith Task Force has accepted the challenge of Mayor Sayles Belton towork toward eliminating negative acts of violence in the City of Minneapolis. Wehave chosen to do this by celebrating the year 1995 as A Year Of Harmony withspecial guests and challenging workshops during our Diversity Month, October 22ndto November 22nd.<P>Our kick-off speaker for this month is a well known peacemaker and prophet. Heis the Honorable Emanuel Cleaver, II, Mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, co-founderof Harmony in a World of Difference, and pastor of St. James United MethodistChurch in Kansas City.<P>All too often, in our quest to seek peace and pursue it, we need skills andresources to accomplish our desires. Harmony, Shalom, Peace is desirable to mosthuman beings, though our interpretations of these words may differ, our goal isthe same.<P>We are not the only city that has struggled with the hard issues of violence,racism and conflict. The City of Kansas City faced these issues. Mayor Cleaverwas inspired to organize Harmony, a program which is aimed at improving racerelations, reducing prejudice and increasing cultural awareness.<P>Harmony in a World of Difference had its roots in the City Council in KansasCity, as does the Minneapolis Initiative Against Racism (MIAR) has its roots inthe Minneapolis City Council. Founders were Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton andCommissioner Sandra Hilary when they were City Council members.<P>The Kansas City Council ranked race relations as a top priority and set out toaddress this problem through the leadership of then Councilman Cleaver. Hedeveloped the Harmony covenants/voluntary agreement concept. The City endorsed itand provided seed money. Community leaders worked with the Anti-Defamation Leagueeducation program which began in Boston called A World of Difference. The twoconcepts were combined and the idea of Harmony in a world of difference emerged.<P>The initial project had four components: alliance, education, media, and taskforces. The task forces, like ours, covered a variety of sectors of the city suchas: financial, labor, real estate, economic development, media, education, lawand justice, religion, and intergroup dialogue. The project has grown andcontinues to work diligently to meet community needs.<P>The Honorable Emanuel Cleaver is the 51st Mayor of Kansas City and in 1991,became the first African American elected to the Citys highest office. He has along history of civic and community activism. Some of his accomplishments are ineconomic development, public safety (spearheading the community policing concept,and other neighborhood innovative programs), along with capital improvement.Since being elected Mayor, he has received many outstanding awards andrecognition. He and his wife Dianne have four children.<P>We cordially and very enthusiastically invite the community, civic andbusiness leaders, the faith community, one and all to come hear this greatspeaker and help us in Celebrating a Year Of Harmony in a World of DifferenceParticipate in the Kick Off Interfaith Celebration on October 24 and theConference on October 25th.

It was decided that someof these activities would be one time events while others could be ongoingactivities, even after the year ended.<P>With these goals in mind, the following projects were initiated: Food Drive(ongoing), Volunteering at a nursing home in Roseville (once a month),Volunteering at the Food Banks Product Recovery and Preboxing programs (once amonth), Volunteering at the Soup Kitchen (one event completed, one in theplanning stage with youths from the Jewish community), and Volunteers to sign upfor training to teach English to refugees through UCAM.<P>For the upcoming events, the community also hopes to participate in activatesplanned for the Diversity month and the Youth Recognition Event. Along with theSuni Muslims, we hope to help the Bosnian refugees find work and employment.<P><A HREF="#TOC">(Table of Contents)</A><HR><H3><A NAME="UPDATES">Task Force Updates</A></H3><P>September 1994<P><EM><B>Note:</B> In past MIAR newsletters, goals for each Task Force have beenlisted.

The program will help these companies establish themselves,expand and provide jobs in their communities. This program is intended to financebusinesses that can demonstrate their potential for success.<P>The loan program is available to new or existing businesses in Minneapolis,St. Paul, Columbia Heights, Hilltop, Hopkins, Lauderdale Mendota, South St. Paul,St. Anthony, and West St. Paul.<P>Loan funds may be used for normal business expenses such as machinery andequipment, inventory and receivables, working capital, new construction,renovation and site acquisition. Funds cannot be used for financing existingdebt.<P>Businesses may apply for loans between $10,000 and $300,000 Interest rates areset by negotiation between the non-profit agency and each individual business,and will range between 2% and 10%. Terms and conditions of each loan arenegotiable.<P>Funds are awarded by the Urban Initiative Board to qualified local non-profitagencies. The agencies, in turn, review loan applications and make loans toindividual businesses. The non-profit groups also offer businesses a variety ofmanagement and technical assistance, including analyzing financial and managementneeds and linking businesses with training opportunities for employees.<P>The entire application and loan process is managed by qualified localnonprofit agencies. Several organizations have been selected to receive theinitial funds, and more will be awarded in coming months. To find out whichagency serves your business or area of the Twin Cities, call Bart Bevins,297-1170, if you are located in Ramsey, Anoka or Dakota counties or call StewartMcMullan, 297-3548, if you are located in Hennepin county. Both are on the staffof the Minnesota Department of Trade and Economic Development and can help inmatching up with the right organization or identifying other sources of businessdevelopment assistance.<P><A HREF="#TOC">(Table of Contents)</A><HR><H3><A NAME="VOTEREG">Voter Registration and Voting as an Initiative AgainstRacism</A></H3><P>In the past two elections, the discrepancy between the number of inner-cityvoters and the number of suburban voters has widened. In 1992, the top suburbandistrict, Edina, voted almost triple that of the lowest turnout district, NorthMinneapolis. If we compare the top ten turnout districts (mostly suburban) withthe bottom ten turnout districts (mostly inner city), we see almost a two-to-oneratio in participation, a difference of 90,000 votes. In 1994, we see similardifferences with much lower turnouts in the inner city districts. All the voicesin our society need to be heard! It is time we concentrate on an effort toregister voters in the lower voter participation communities of the cities ofMinneapolis and St. Paul. Let all voices be heard!

In break-out group discussions they then discussed how they couldcombat racism in their own agencies. In their program materials, participantsreceived the MIAR Principles of Conduct and other MIAR literature, were invitedto sign our pledge and put their names on our mailing list.

I am pleasedto present a framework for City Department Heads to follow in developingtheir 1997 budget proposals. It reflects the collaborative budget processI have established with the City Council. This is the second year we haveworked with our new budget process, and I believe our focus, collaboration,and quality of our decision-making are improving as a result. You may rememberlast year we reached consensus on all major policy issues, and our onlysubstantial disagreements were on how to spend about $450,000, or abouttwo-tenths of one percent of our tax-supported budget. <BR><BR>I thank you for your participation and cooperation, and especially thankthe Department Heads for their unprecedented efforts to look beyond departmentallines to meet City-wide challenges. <BR><BR>Last year our budget strategy was successful in several ways. Faced withshrinking resources and the need to cut costs, we found ways to reorganize,consolidate and streamline, enabling us to save money and manage our citybetter. We were able to do this with minimal disruption to employees. Meanwhile,we continued to merit a Triple A bond rating - saving $3 million a yearin interest the city would otherwise have to pay on its bonds - the equivalentof a five percent increase in property taxes. <BR><BR>This year, the City continues to face the same financial pressures, causedto a great extent by the federal deficit, which tripled during the 1980s.Today, 15 percent of total federal outlays are for interest payments. Congressis responding to the deficit, not with broadly distributed belt-tighteningmeasures, but with what it calls &quot;devolution&quot; - drastic cuts ingrants to cities and states. Our State's deficit is expected to grow about$3.2 billion in the next six years as a result of devolution, and thesecuts will be passed on to the cities and towns of Minnesota. These federalreductions transfer the responsibility of reducing the federal deficit tostate and local taxpayers. The burden falls particularly hard on cities,which traditionally provide the economic, social and cultural infrastructurefor citizens of their regions and states. <BR><BR>For the last five years Minneapolis has experienced a decline in our taxbase, causing us to defer certain obligations. Now that our tax base isstabilizing, it is time to face up to them. Here are some challenges wemust meet in the near future: <MENU>Next year we must begin to fully fund the cost of self-insurance,instead of borrowing money to pay for it. <BR><BR>In 1998, we must begin to pay the full cost of the &quot;Clinton Cops&quot;program, which has been heavily subsidized in its first three years. <BR><BR>We must make significant repairs and improvements in our roads and bridges.<BR>As I indicated in my last budget address, we must make major improvementsin our water system that will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Thereis a story in the August issue of Mpls-St. Paul magazine on the status ofour water facility, which I urge you to read to appreciate the significanceof this issue. Unfortunately, the author of this otherwise excellent storyappears to be under the impression that we have been keeping the need fora capital program for the water system some sort of secret; so what I urge<I>him</I> to read is my last year's budget address! <BR><BR><BR>Over the next several years we must also find a way to reduce commercialand industrial taxes. We must be sensitive to the fact that as downtownrecovers from the depressed commercial tax base, taxes will continue torise. A recent climate study suggests that so far taxes have not discouragedbusiness. But just this weekend I received the preliminary results of MCDA'ssurvey of what I call our &quot;horizon&quot; industries - the industriesthat will lead our economy in coming years. One in five respondents saidthey may move within two years, and those considering leaving Minneapolisgave taxes as their number-one reason, with crime not far behind. Thereis little doubt that as businesses become more cost-sensitive, high taxrates will discourage future growth. However, the method we choose to reducebusiness taxes must not interfere with the community's ability to fund ourpublic schools, nor can it result in painful property tax increases forresidents. Working together, we must find a solution that will benefit the<I>entire</I> community. </MENU><BR>Even though we cannot address all these challenges next year, we must continueto prepare for them by careful planning, living within our means and conscientiousstewardship of our resources. It would be far easier to continue to do businessas usual, and leave these problems to our successors. However, our successorsare our children, and the problems we leave them will, by that time, benearly insurmountable. <BR><BR>Fortunately, Minneapolis is better prepared than many communities to meetpresent and future needs, even in the context of the federal funding changes.This is because we prepared for them for the last two years with tough budgetsand creative redesigns. We protected citizens from drastic service cutsand higher taxes, and city employees from sweeping layoffs. <BR><BR>The framework I propose today is just as tough and creative. It describesthe path for again accomplishing our priority goals - <I>without increasingthe City's property tax rate</I>. <BR><BR>Now I will highlight some of the proposals I am instructing department headsto address as they submit their budget plans. I will begin with what I knowwe all agree must be our top priority in 1997: public safety. <BR><BR><HR><H3>Public Safety</H3>I know we all agree the top priority for Minneapolis in 1997 is public safety.It is an outrage that in the City of Minneapolis there are schools wheregunshots ring out, parks where drugs are dealt, and streets where a mothercan be murdered taking her children to buy an ice cream cone. This is notthe Minneapolis our citizens deserve, it is not the Minneapolis our childrendeserve, and I am determined that <I>this will not b</I>e the Minneapoliswe pass on to them. <BR><BR>Last year I called for unprecedented investments in public safety. Theseinvestments allowed us to raise our authorized police strength to an all-timehigh of 914 officers, and purchase $2.4 million dollars' worth of squadcars and police equipment. <BR><BR>But simply assigning more police officers to the streets is not the answer.We must fight crime the same way a general fights a war: by holding ourground, preventing all incursions, and denying the enemy a foothold. Wemust stop criminals at the very gateway to crime. We must stop them on thesidewalk where they are dealing drugs, at the doorway of the houses of prostitution,in the homes where domestic violence terrorizes innocent women and children.We must stop them as they carry illegal firearms, sell alcohol and tobaccoto children, and disturb the peace with blaring radios. Low-level, or gatewaycrimes, destroy our sense of safety, trust in each other, and create anenvironment for more serious crime. <BR><BR>Nevertheless, in Minneapolis and in Hennepin County, we do very little toprosecute gateway crimes. At my request, the Chief of Police and City Attorneyhave developed a plan for aggressive prosecution of misdemeanors, and arerecommending an investment of $245,000 to hire two additional attorneys,two investigators and three support staff. I am prepared to support thisinvestment. But the City cannot succeed in this effort alone. We need theHennepin County District Court to put the full muscle of the criminal justicesystem behind the good work of the Minneapolis Police Department. Thereare still some details to be worked out, but Chief Judge Daniel Mabley andAssistant Chief Judge Pamela Alexander have given me their strong commitmentsto consider my plan for the creation of a new misdemeanor calendar in theDistrict Court, and help us slam the door on gateway crime. <BR><BR>We need a coordinated effort in which Minneapolis police aggressively enforcemisdemeanor violations, the City Attorney has resources to prepare strongcases against them, and the District Court has greater capacity to handlethem. Many residents and police have become frustrated with the &quot;revolvingdoor&quot; that seems to release criminals as quickly as they can be apprehended.Our strategy will have two results: One, it will produce higher convictionrates, and two, it will remove trouble-makers from the streets before theyhave a chance to commit more serious crimes. <BR><BR>If we work together, we can stop today's dilapidated properties from becomingdrug houses, today's domestic assault from becoming tomorrow's homicide,and today's illegal handgun from becoming a weapon of death. <BR><BR>It is an outrage that in some Minneapolis neighborhoods - just to get toschool - our children must pass through streets of despair where they donot pass grocery stores, pharmacies and dry cleaners, but houses of prostitutionand drug houses, where they confront delinquents, bullies and gang memberswho would readily smash our children's future with a rock of crack-cocaineor a bullet. <BR><BR>City officials have many critical responsibilities, but first and foremost,we must protect our children. A community that turns its back on childrenturns its back on its own future. In February at my State of the City AddressI said we needed to place a priority on keeping children safe in our publicspaces, including city schools and parks. Since then we have been workingwith the Minneapolis Public Schools and the Minneapolis Park and RecreationBoard to outline a strategy. Today I am calling for implementation of thisstrategy, which we call Safe Schools, Safe Parks. <BR><BR>Safe Schools, Safe Parks is smart, and it's tough. It saturates with policeprotection the areas where children and their families work and recreate.It enforces a policy of zero-tolerance for crime, zero-tolerance for drugs,zero-tolerance for prostitution, zero- tolerance for guns, and zero-tolerancefor gangs. <BR><BR>I am directing the Police Department to submit plans for the 1997 budgetto increase police protection along the routes children take to school,and work intensively with school principals to develop a safety plan forevery Minneapolis public school. I am asking every city agency that sendsstaff into the community to identify workers to drive specially marked McGruffvehicles children can flag down if they think they are in danger. I am askingInspections to submit plans for zero-tolerance of code violations that createdangerous or unhealthy conditions in these areas or that deface our cityand insult our citizens. <BR><BR>I have been in discussions with the Minneapolis Public Schools to find outhow we can work together for safer schools. They have agreed to meet weeklywith police school liaison officers to identify and solve safety issues,conduct security audits, and issue ID cards that will help them keep outthe dangerous people who do not belong in our schools. <BR><BR>We send children to school so they can learn in an environment where adultsguide and supervise them, but they also need structure and positive opportunitieswhen the bell rings at the end of the school day. However, 40 percent ofthe average student's time is spent unsupervised. In my State of the Cityaddress last February, in the name of the safety of our youth, I asked theMinneapolis School Board to consider changing school hours so that childrenwill both begin and end school later in the day. <BR><BR>This morning I am happy to announce, together with School Board Chair BillGreen and Superintendent Peter Hutchinson, that the Minneapolis Board ofEducation has voted to work with the community to develop by December arecommendation to change start times beginning in 1997. Board Chair Greenand Superintendent Hutchinson, would you please stand and let this audiencethank you. <BR><BR>Minneapolis parents, this is your chance to work with the schools so yourchild may no longer have to wait for the bus or walk to school on dark wintermornings, or leave school at 1:45, perhaps unsupervised, during the veryhours juvenile crime is at its peak. <BR><BR>In 1992, we were so concerned about this problem that we started the Youthin Minneapolis Program (Y-MAP). Now that children will be staying in schoollater, I am directing the Youth Coordinating Board to begin immediatelyto redesign Y-MAP, placing more emphasis on activities that will take placein the school buildings. We need to be ready for the 1997-1998 school year.<BR><BR>I urge everyone in the community to set special interests aside, and worktogether to develop a new schedule that meets the safety needs of our children.I thank the School Board for making a change that will go a long way towardkeeping our youth safe and out of trouble. <BR><BR>I have also discussed Safe Schools, Safe Parks with the Minneapolis Parkand Recreation Board. I was shocked to learn there are parks in Minneapolisover which we have lost control, parks that been taken over by thugs, gangstersand substance abusers. It is intolerable that some of our public spaces,which our taxes support, are no longer safe enough for us to enjoy. At myrequest, Chief Olson has met with Captain Jacobs of the Park Police to determinehow the Minneapolis Police Department can help. They have agreed to outlinea plan for Park police and Minneapolis precinct commanders to take backour city parks - and do it now! <BR><BR>The Park Board and the City share the goal of protecting citizens from crime.Because I believe we can make better use of the taxpayers' dollars by poolingour resources, I will continue to explore how City and Park police can worktogether to make our city a safer place. <BR><BR>Youth need supervision, guidance and support. This community has made abig mistake by not providing it on the long sunny weekends of June, Julyand August. I congratulate the Park Board on its plans for the RecXtra program,which will offer activities for families and children on summer weekends,starting in 1997. We may discover we can not afford this program in everypark, but it is crucial to introduce it in those neighborhoods where wemust take back the parks for the families and children of Minneapolis. <BR><BR>Crime, like a noxious weed, can grow only in an environment that permitsit to grow. As a result of our new priority work team meetings, many pointsof view contributed to the discussion of how to make the Minneapolis environmentinhospitable to crime. One proposal was to deter crime by better lightingin our streets and alleys. I am asking the Department of Public Works tomeet with neighborhood and NRP groups, businesses, the City Assessor andNSP to put together a lighting-for-safety plan for consideration in nextyear's budget. <BR><BR><HR><H3>Livable Neighborhoods </H3><BR>Now I will move to our second priority: livable neighborhoods. <BR><BR>In February I spoke of the need to make Minneapolis more livable duringthe winter by digging out from snowstorms within 24 hours. Public Workshas not yet been able to identify a way to accomplish this with expendituresthat are acceptable in the present economic climate. However, we do knowwe could meet peak seasonal needs, such as making the city more passablein the wintertime and conducting community clean-ups more quickly, effectivelyand inexpensively, by changing the way we use our work force. Now we hiresummer seasonal staff whom we lay off during the winter. Yet we pay themunemployment and on-call bonuses while they are not working. All told, wepay them the equivalent of eleven months' wages for only seven months' work.It would be a better use of taxpayer dollars if we paid them 12 months ofthe year for 12 months of work, so they could help us remove snow from aroundbus stops, alley approaches, street corners and the downtown area. <BR><BR>We have other resources that we are not using. We should be talking withour friends in labor about cross-training employees for seasonal work, sothat, for example, Inspections field staff and animal control workers whosebusy season is the summer could write tickets during snow-emergencies. Housingand rental licensing inspectors could be assigned temporarily to help withweed and rubbish removal. Workers on light duty could help, too, as couldsummer youth workers. And why not ask the District Court to assign non-violentoffenders to community service? They can help us cut weeds, pick up trashand erase graffiti, to make our community more livable. I look forward toreceiving the recommendations of the work force utilization task force forinclusion in my 1997 budget. Again, we must work cooperatively with laborto accomplish our objectives. <BR><BR>I also believe we can do a better job cleaning up our neighborhoods - atno additional cost to taxpayers - just by better coordinating our streetcleaning and sanitation operations. I am asking Public Works to test sucha coordinated effort in 1997. I know the Department is planning a pilotcommunity clean-up in the Central neighborhood in August, and another inthe Phillips neighborhood in October. For the Phillips clean-up we may evenobtain the additional support of 200 of President Clinton's AmeriCorps volunteers!<BR><BR>Last year's bitter winter presented severe problems for citizens who areelderly or who struggle with disabilities. Unshoveled corners and sidewalksmade it all but impossible for them to move around out-of-doors. We canimprove the livability of our city, again at little or no cost, by expandingour Citizen Inspection program, in which community volunteers identify neighborhoodmaintenance problems, and either encourage property owners to solve them,or contact the city for help. As we look for ways to reweave the socialfabric, we must treat our citizens not as passive customers of government,but as full partners who take responsibility for their neighbors and forown community. <BR><BR>Now, in case any of you brought along my budget message from last year,I'd like you to turn to page three. In the section on sewer service, I saidour five-year plan to put the sewer fund in the black required us to makemodest increases in the sewer rates for each of those years. In 1997, thefourth year of the plan, those increases will amount to an average of 96cents per household per month. I want to remind everybody that this increaseis part of a responsible plan we all agreed to, and it should not be a surpriseto anyone. <BR><BR><HR><H3>Economic Development </H3><BR>Now I will turn to the third major priority for the City of Minneapolis:economic development. <BR><BR>If we want to grow the Minneapolis economy, we must grow our tax base. Thefundamental task of the MCDA is to recommend the investments we must maketo develop a tax base strong enough to support our local economy. We needthe MCDA's recommendations for investments we should make in housing - notjust in rehabilitation, but in land parcels we can put together to sellto meet consumer demand. I am delighted with the new housing that has sprungup in recent years along the riverfront. This excellent use of desirableland adds tremendously to both the urban environment and to our tax base.Riverfront living to date has been costly, with Saw Mill Run homes startingat $325,000, but the new Itasca units promise to be more affordable. <BR><BR>In my State of the City Address I said we need to address housing issues,especially low home ownership in the Phillips neighborhood and the NearNorth Side. We want to increase the rate of home ownership. I am askingthe MCDA to develop for a specific plan to accomplish this objective. <BR><BR>We need the MCDA to continue to emphasize the development of community commercialcorridors. They are the life blood of the residential neighborhoods thatsurround them. In 1997 we must get some important projects on line, especiallyon Chicago and Lake, Broadway, Lowry and Central Avenue. Council MemberHerron, I will work with you to help revitalize Lake Street with that Searsredevelopment project. We can accomplish our objective of creating the jobcenter, and bring exciting retail back to Chicago-Lake. <BR><BR>We are progressing with Central Riverfront development, and are on schedulewith our partners, the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board and Minnegasco,to complete the Great River Road in the spring of 1997. We are moving aheadwith plans for new housing in the Northstar Woolen Mill and the UtilityBuilding. Through our partners on the St. Anthony Falls Heritage Board,we secured state bonds to develop Phase I of Mill Ruins Park. The Park Boardwill request 1997 capital funds from CLIC as part of the required localmatch, and I plan on approaching Hennepin County, our partner on the HeritageBoard, also to make a financial contribution to the contribution of thisnew riverfront park. The park will enhance the redevelopment of the MilwaukeeDepot site, which will be under construction by January 1. These are wonderfulhistoric sites in Minneapolis, and will be great amenities for people wholive and work and play downtown. <BR><BR>In the MCDA business survey, the need for skilled workers was the secondmost frequently cited high priority need. Remember that unemployment isonly 2.3 percent in Minneapolis, and many companies are having a hard timefinding qualified employees. This tight labor market makes it a necessityto groom a work force to meet the needs of growing businesses. The highlevel of communication and coordination needed for this effort will nothappen automatically. I am calling on the MCDA and Minneapolis Educationand Training Program (METP) to pursue plans for a work force compact tocoordinate employment and training with industry's need to fill new jobs.The compact must include the School District, community colleges, technicalschools, labor and other public and private partners. <BR><BR>If we want to feed economic growth and keep businesses in Minneapolis, wemust invest in the education and training of our citizens. If we want toaddress the double-digit unemployment we have in some neighborhoods, wemust recognize this tight job market is a golden opportunity to provideeducation and job training for inner city residents who might otherwisebe left out. The passage of the welfare bill is going to have an impacton Minneapolis. We need to be pro-active in ensuring that the people haveaccess to education and training so they can be gainfully employed and ina position to make a contribution to the community. <BR><BR><HR><H3>Healthy Families and Children </H3><BR>Our fourth City goal is to ensure healthy families and children. Last year,as a result of reduced federal funding, the City changed the way it addressedpublic health. Today's Department of Health and Family Support assessescommunity health needs, advocates to meet them, and monitors the deliveryof health care, especially with the clinics it contracts with for directcare. <BR><BR>In keeping with the emphasis we place on violence as a public health problem,I reaffirm that the City wants to advance the Health Department's role infighting crime and violence, and that it should continue with this importantwork. <BR><BR>I also want to emphasize the Department's role as an advocate for the healthof the people of Minneapolis. Health problems in Minneapolis are disproportionatelyhigh, compared to health problems elsewhere in Hennepin County. We needthe Department to be a strong advocate to help us secure the additionalresources we need to maintain good public health. <BR><BR>There has been much discussion recently about the level of student achievement.Every good parent knows a child must feel strong, healthy and energeticto perform well in school. But too many young people are held back by chronicillness and medical problems. Think about it: Can a teenager who uses drugsbe motivated to succeed in school? Can a seven-year-old who suffers fromabuse and clinical depression learn to read? Will a pregnant 15-year oldwith morning sickness be able get to school on time? Who will help thesefragile young people if, for whatever reason, their parents fail them? Whatwill happen to them in five years if no one helps them? <BR><BR>The Health Department and the Public Schools are engaged in a partnershipin which the schools are under contract to deliver clinical care to students.They believe that in the past we have focused school health service toonarrowly on treating illness, and so have adopted a new goal of prevention.I endorse this approach, because I believe it will result in healthier childrenwho are better prepared to succeed in school. I commend Commissioner DelHurt and his staff for advancing this discussion. <BR><BR>Because it is the overall goal of the city to build community, it is importantthat some department of the city be responsible for thinking about and discussinghow we improve the status of families and children. I believe this responsibilityshould lie with the Health Department. I have asked the Health Commissionerto assume responsibility for convening a task force that will involve theappropriate city departments in examining the critical issues facing familiestoday and developing an agenda for action. You will find greater detailon this proposal in your Priorities '97 documents. <BR><BR>Many of our City offices receive daily phone calls from citizens with problems.Some call with relatively simple problems - for example, a mix-up on a bill,a complaint about a pothole. Others call with problems so difficult andcomplex that they don't know who else to call or where to start. Staff dotheir best to help, but often do not have the training or full range ofexpertise to solve the problem. We already have a one-stop shop for business;why shouldn't we have one for citizens? Why shouldn't there be a place,perhaps with free parking, where taxpayers can easily obtain the information,referrals and services they are paying for? I propose that in 1997 we establishan Office of Citizen Service. I want to reorganize the way we serve citizensto most efficiently respond to <I>their</I> needs. This is a first step.<BR><BR>This office, and the Task Force for Children and Families, will take onnew importance in the face of federal devolution. It is impossible for usto predict the result devolution will have on citizens. We do know thatall the failures of our American systems - the failures of education, theeconomy, housing and the criminal justice system - eventually collide, notin the halls of Congress or the state Capitol, but in the streets of Americancities. When the safety net breaks, the people fall - on Lake Street, onBroadway, and in the alleys behind the bars. When the safety net breaks,it will be the cities that witness the damage, even if we have no resourcesto deal with them. We must prepare ourselves for the future. <BR><BR><HR><H3>Government Management </H3><BR>Our fifth and final priority is government management. When I became mayorin 1994, I pledged to improve the City management system. In 1995 I followedup by obtaining the commitment of the City Council to undertake sweepingreforms. We have made many improvements together since then, including anew finance system, regulatory reform, technology improvements. Next yearwe must finish the job. <BR><BR>Our citizens are not at all pleased to read in the paper about the lawsuitsand claims against the City that act like a slow leak in our budget. TheCity of Minneapolis currently does not have a comprehensive risk managementstrategy, and because we are self-insured, our losses have a dollar-for-dollarimpact on the size of our budget. The cost of risk is currently estimatedat $11 million. About $9.8 million is caused by losses, and the rest isfor administration and insurance premiums. A draft report from our consultantindicates that while the City may not be able to prevent all lawsuits, wecan lower our costs significantly just by improving our management. We mustconsolidate the five risk-management functions now scattered throughoutthree city departments. We must staff up to do a better job preventing lossesand returning injured workers back to the job. If we make these changes,we will save $200,000 the very first year, and upwards of $500,000 everyyear after that, because of increased efficiency and effectiveness. Thisis an investment we must make this year. It is not optional. We owe it toour citizens to stop this waste of their tax dollars. <BR><BR>The City of Minneapolis operates a fleet of vehicles that are used by fire,police, public works, inspections and other departments. Because we havenot instituted a policy of regular replacement, over a third of our vehiclesare past their replacement date and expensive to maintain. Despite the factthat a centralized pool would be more efficient and economical, we maintainour fleet at five locations throughout the city, resulting in underutilizationof vehicles, inefficient inventories and duplication of effort. Our mainrepair facilities were built in 1936, and are not adequate for modern fleetmaintenance. This kind of disarray can result in policy-makers having tomake important decisions --such as whether to invest in new vehicles --with insufficient information. <BR><BR>The director of Public Works faces major challenges in turning our systemaround. I am asking him to give me a multi-year fleet and facilities managementplan we can begin to implement next year. We must make the investments necessaryto get the fleet back onto a reasonable replacement cycle, and we need tobuild modern, efficient facilities. Implementation of this plan will resultin future cost savings. In last year's Budget Address, I said &quot;we shouldbegin now to build the funds needed to put the City on a pay-as-you-go basisfor improvements&quot; to our water system. Now we must develop a specificplan. I would like a preliminary plan by November. <BR><BR>We continue to make progress on all 14 objectives of our Human Resourcesagenda. In 1997 we will make substantial progress in two areas. We can makethe Human Resources generalist program city-wide, and we can implement theHuman Resource Information System which will give us more accurate and timelyinformation. <BR><BR><HR><H3>An Opportunity </H3>Before concluding, I want to talk about a proposal that did not come outof the budget process, but represents a very exciting opportunity. For twoweeks the whole world has been mesmerized by the Altanta Olympic Games,and we all have cheered for those young Americans who have excelled in thename of our country. Now, the Olympic Committee proposes that Minneapolisbe one of two sites in the nation for an Olympic Development Center foryoung people. The facility would be a state-of-the-art community centeroperated by the YWCA. Our residents would have access to a world-class aquaticcenter, play pockets and fountains for small children, a water games areaand even a water slide. There would be three gymnasiums and a fitness centerfor people of all ages and abilities. Council Member Dziedzic, I want youto know there will be facilities for soccer, basketball, volleyball andtrack and field, and they will be available to our Minneapolis school children.There will be child care, so the facility could serve as a gathering placefor the entire community. <BR><BR>Council Member Thurber has worked hard to coordinate the development ofthis opportunity. It would involve a partnership consisting of the MinneapolisYWCA, Minneapolis Public School District and the Minnesota Amateur SportsCommission. Funding would come from a capital drive spearheaded by the YWCA,as well as resources from the state legislature, the school district, theNRPs of Longfellow, Powderhorn and Corcoran, Hennepin County and the Cityof Minneapolis. <BR><BR>This YWCA Community Center and Olympic Development Center will enhance ourcommunity's national sports profile. It will improve the quality of lifefor our residents. It will promote dreams of excellence and achievementto our youth, and help them make those dreams come true. Finally, it willgive us an important advantage as we compete with other communities forfamilies who will live and invest in Minneapolis. Many suburban communitiesalready have excellent recreational and fitness amenities. There is no reasonthat the families and children of Minneapolis should not have them, too.<BR><BR><HR><H3>Conclusion </H3><BR>I know many of these directions will challenge the creativity of our departmentheads. I want them to remember, however, as they prepare their proposals,that if the City of Minneapolis made no changes at all in the way we dobusiness, our costs would increase by $5 million dollars in 1997. Fortunately,we will be able to absorb $3 million dollars of that increase with the increasedrevenues associated with a growing tax base. However, because I am absolutelycommitted to avoiding an increase in the tax rate, I need City Departmentsto reduce total expenditures by $2 million. <BR><BR>I hope that as you work with your Priorities '97 documents, you will beexcited by the new opportunities we have identified for making significantprogress in several areas. This is a framework for zero tolerance for crimeand violence. We <I>will</I> have safe schools and safe parks. We <I>will</I>have a criminal justice system that backs up the work of our Minneapolispolice officers. We <I>will</I> have well-lit streets free of trash, debrisand graffiti. This is a budget framework for more livable neighborhoods!Neighborhoods where our families can be strong and self-sufficient. Thisis a budget framework that recognizes our responsibility to create an economicclimate where businesses can grow and offer our citizens good jobs at goodliving wages. <BR><BR>We are making progress. We must continue to work together to build a stronger,safer city for all of our residents. <BR><BR>I look forward to our continued collaboration in this budget process. <BR><BR><HR><H5><BR>Email your comments and questions to <I><A HREF="mailto:opa_mpls@ci.mpls.mn.us">opa_mpls@ci.mpls.mn.us</A></I></H5></BODY></HTML>

Members of the IndependentBoards and the Hennepin County Board, welcome. Citizens of Minneapolis,thank you for joining us. <BR><BR>I thank Principal Ann Widseth, the administration, faculty, students andparents of Jenny Lind Community School for welcoming us today. I particularlywant to thank the children who sang so beautifully a few moments ago. Let'sgive them a hand. <BR><BR>Jenny Lind represents some of the best qualities of our Minneapolis Publicschool system. It is a brand new, state-of-the-art building. <BR><BR>This kind of high-quality education is found throughout our public schools.Jenny Lind students enjoy a science program, a public-private partnershipdeveloped at the University of California at Berkeley and funded by Medtronic.It offers a program for gifted and talented children that even lets thempublish their own newspaper, and a computer-based math and reading programthat won a national award. <BR><BR>We applaud these achievements, especially since our Minneapolis schoolsface challenges many other school districts do not. Yes, they must overcomelearning barriers created by poverty. Yes, our teachers must work harderto educate the 12 percent of our children who have limited English skills,the 55 percent eligible for free lunches, the 34 percent on AFDC, the 12percent who are disabled. The success of our schools, in the face of thesechallenges, is remarkable, and more than enough reason to be proud of themand to give them the support they both need and fully deserve. <BR><BR>One of the great benefits of being Mayor of Minneapolis is the badge ofcommunity pride I wear every place I go. A couple of weeks ago I attendedthe US Conference of Mayors, and it was a pleasure to hear mayors from allaround the country sing the praises of our city. <BR><BR>Those mayors know that even though Minneapolis struggles with the same problemsthey do, we are solving them. They envy our Triple A bond rating, our citymanagement, and our progressive attitude. Many who were here two years agofor the National League of Cities convention remember how beautiful andclean Minneapolis is, and how safe it feels compared to their own downtowns.<BR><BR>I say this, not to distract us from the challenges at hand, but to makesure we do not focus on them exclusively, forgetting the positive foundationwe have to build on. For us to sustain our commitment to a healthy and thrivingMinneapolis, we need two things: first, pride in our past accomplishments;and second, a vision of a vital and thriving future. <BR><BR><HR><BR><H3><STRONG>Reviewing Our Accomplishments: 1995</STRONG></H3><BR>So let us take a few minutes to review our 1995 &quot;report card.&quot;Did we accomplish what we set out to do? How did we build on our city'salready strong foundation? <BR><BR>In my last State of the City address I said we needed to develop a long-termplan to stabilize our community, and provide the things families need tobe strong and healthy. I said then we should concentrate on the four factorsthat make the biggest difference in people's lives: housing, jobs, education. . . and safety. <BR><BR>A few months later, record homicides sent shock waves through the community.Ninety-seven men, women and even children fell victim to a terrible plagueof violence. We saw killings over drugs, over relationships, over angrywords, over a bicycle. Children were murdered by their parents, wives bytheir husbands, children by other children. <BR><BR>When we think of public safety in Minneapolis, we must remember that --overall --serious crime has been declining. In that context, we struggledto understand this tragic rise in homicides, and we took action. <BR><BR>Last July, on a 60-day trial basis, the Minneapolis Police Department sentspecially trained Operation Safe Street squads into nine neighborhoods totest a new strategy. We identified the neighborhoods suffering the mostfrom violence, and set out to remove as many illegal guns as we could fromthe streets in these neighborhoods. Our strategy worked. One hundred seventy-sevenillegal guns were confiscated, and the number of gunshots fired droppedimmediately -- in fact, below the 1994 level. Even more importantly, theword went out on the streets that if you want to stay out of trouble inMinneapolis, you'd better leave your gun at home! <BR><BR>Operation Safe Street was effective because it fought crime with a campaigndesigned and directed -- not in City Hall -- but in our precincts and neighborhoods.Police identified specific neighborhood problems, and formed a united frontwith local residents and businesses to confront crime. We are encouragedby the success of this strategy, and will expand it this spring. We arealso encouraged by Governor Arne Carlson's recognition of Operation SafeStreet's effectiveness and his efforts to fund it in Minneapolis and evenexpand it into other Minnesota communities. <BR><BR>Community policing programs such as Operation Safe Street require more policein the community. So does the downtown command, which Chief Robert Olsonestablished last year. We passed a budget with substantial increases inpolice funding, allowing us to hire and equip 10 new police officers, andwe received a federal grant for another 17 &quot;Clinton Cops&quot; to walkthe beat, and work with residents to solve problems before they jeopardizeneighborhood peace and safety. That's community policing! <BR><BR>Last year we created Precinct Response Teams, and an Organized Crime Unitthat, by this spring, will be able to deal aggressively with the difficultproblems of illegal street activity, repeat offenders, gangs and weaponssales. <BR><BR>These changes in the police department were extremely important, but sowere other changes not so widely publicized. Chief Olson often talks about&quot;attitude.&quot; Our new police administration's new attitude is resultingin major internal changes. We are moving more swiftly and decisively tofollow up on charges of officer misconduct. More importantly, we are decentralizingthe force, and placing more trust and responsibility in the hundreds ofofficers who perform their jobs with integrity -- and often, heroism. <BR><BR>In 1995 we closed one chapter on the way the Minneapolis Police Departmentworks, and opened a new one. Congratulations, Chief Olson, on an excellentjob. <BR><BR>A study we conducted last year implicates guns in more than three quartersof our youth homicides. Last year we passed a zoning ordinance to keep commercialgun sales out of residential neighborhoods -- not a panacea, but one morestep toward reducing the killing. We must do everything possible to reduceguns in our neighborhoods, to get them out of our homes, out of our neighborhoods,out of the hands of criminals, and out of the way of our children. We cando this, we must do it, and we will do it in the City of Minneapolis. <BR><BR>Good housing is essential to a stable community. Last year I proposed, andthe City Council adopted, a set of housing principles which are now theCity's official housing development policy. They encourage homeownership,reinvestment in our housing stock, and better housing choices for residents.<BR><BR>In 1995, the Minneapolis Community Development Agency helped 430 Minneapolisresidents reinvest in their homes with nearly $2.3 million dollars worthof home improvement loans, and made 716 residential mortgage loans totalingmore than $54 million. Ladies and gentlemen, that was an all-time record!<BR><BR>Meanwhile, the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority, or MPHA, helped 17public housing and Section 8 families become first-time homeowners. <BR><BR>MPHA designated four public high-rises -- 900 units -- for the elderly.It rehabbed 70 single-family homes, and modernized 22 high-rises, includingthe Cedars Complex, Hiawatha Towers, and 1815 Central. We made a dramaticdifference at the 1710 Plymouth Building. Once a crime-infested tower thatdisfigured an entire neighborhood, it is now beautiful modern housing forthe elderly, and an asset to the community. Horn Tower in the Lyndale neighborhoodis being renovated, and promises to improve the lives of hundreds of residents.<BR><BR>Using HUD funds from the Hollman out-of-court settlement, MPHA has alreadyfound good homes for 80 of the 300 affected families previously living insubstandard housing. Sixteen of them are now Minneapolis homeowners. Mycommitment to those affected by this lawsuit is to find them better housingthan they had before, in a location they have chosen themselves. <BR><BR>Just this week I received news that the MPHA's Modernization and Elderly-OnlyHighrise Programs were nominated for national awards. MPHA's work is beingrecognized nationally; let's give Director Cora McCorvey and her peoplea hand and recognize them right here at home, as well! <BR><BR>Our residents showed renewed commitment to improving their neighborhoods.Twenty-four excellent Neighborhood Revitalization Plans were approved lastyear. Some of them demonstrated outstanding cooperation among neighborhoods-- for example, the four neighborhoods that collaborated on the Longfellowplan, and the five that collaborated to keep Camden Health Clinic in thecommunity's commercial district. <BR><BR>We thank the hundreds, maybe thousands of residents who took responsibilityfor the well-being of their own communities through the NRP process. Thisis a great program, and we must work harder to insure its success. <BR><BR>Our employment picture continued to improve in 1995. Last year our unemploymentrate was only 3.3 percent -- four-tenths of a point lower than 1994's. Iam happy to say that this is the lowest unemployment rate Minneapolis hashad since 1978! <BR><BR>That is welcome news... but it ignores the thousands of discouraged workerswho no longer show up in the statistics, and the double-digit unemploymentin some neighborhoods. Unemployment is approximately 15 percent in boththe Near North, and Phillips neighborhoods, according to the last census.Even the low overall 3.3 percent unemployment rate translates into 34,000Minneapolis adults without jobs. <BR><BR>Last year our Minneapolis Employment and Training Program, through our NETNetwork, trained, placed and kept 1,400 hard-to-employ people on the job,for an average hourly wage of $7.50. Their combined earnings of nearly $20million paid back four dollars for every one spent on this program. <BR><BR>In our 1996 budget we asked the private sector to raise $1.2 million tostabilize this program. We hope to meet our goal by the end of June. <BR><BR>Last year the Bemis Company Foundation helped us deal with an importantemployment challenge. In the suburbs, where 85 percent of the new jobs are,employers are in need of workers, especially for the late shifts. Meanwhile,unemployed city residents want those jobs but can't get to them for lackof bus service. Bemis made a generous grant to our Neighborhood EmploymentNetwork to work with Loring-Nicollet Job Bank, and the Southwest Metro BusCompany, to help establish the regular bus runs needed to get people tothese jobs. <BR><BR>Good jobs are created by strong businesses, and the MCDA's Business FinancePrograms were of exceptional assistance to the city's business communitylast year. Business financing totaled $215 million, compared to $55 millionthe previous year. As a result, 539 new jobs were created -- the majorityof them industrial -- and more than 4,000 jobs were preserved. 1995 wasalso the year we acquired the Target Center, and financed a new entertainmentvenue downtown, the Hey City Stage. <BR><BR>These employment programs, together with our housing initiatives, have helpedthousands of Minneapolis residents stabilize their lives. In fact, the numberof residents living in the same place more than three years rose to a five-yearhigh in 1995, while the number who lived in the same place less than sixmonths fell to an all-time low. This is excellent news -- a sign that weare moving in the right direction, that our strategies are working. <BR><BR>There were other signs of a healthy, job-producing economy. The value of1995 construction permits exceeded 1994's by 18 percent, partly becauseof the Federal Reserve Bank construction, and partly because homeownersare starting to use NRP housing funds to improve their homes. The downtownvacancy rate fell again, from 12.2 percent to 9.7 percent. Twelve more acresof urban &quot;brownfields&quot; were converted by the MCDA's MILES programinto commercial and industrial sites where Minneapolis residents will eventuallybe able to find jobs. A good example of the MILES program at work is itsclean-up of the Grace Lee Manufacturing Company site in Northeast Minneapolis,which is now being used by Harmony Scenic, Incorporated. Minneapolis isa national model for cleaning up polluted land and restoring it to the taxrolls. <BR><BR>Not all the cleaning-up we did last year was job-related. Some of it willimprove the quality of our lives outside of work. The Chain of Lakes CleanWater Partnership, now in its third year, broke ground this fall for CedarWetlands, a project that will provide a natural filter for stormwater pollutantsthat would otherwise run into our lakes. It will help us restore our beautifullakes from &quot;green to clean.&quot; <BR><BR>In the past year, the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board has upgradedmany of our beautiful parks. They have already begun to develop the comprehensiveframework for our Chain of Lakes, and I look forward to seeing the completedplan. I congratulate the Park system for its fine work. <BR><BR>Last year in my State of the City Address I called for closure on a lingeringquestion: &quot;Should Minneapolis establish community schools to promoteboth family and community support the education of our young people.&quot;<BR><BR>After extensive community discussion, the Minneapolis School Board decidedto create a system of community and magnet schools. For the first time inyears, parents of this year's kindergartners will be able to choose to sendtheir children to a community school near their home, such as Jenny Lind,or a magnet school across town. <BR><BR>We welcome this opportunity to embrace the growth and education of our childrenin our own neighborhoods. We look forward to moving our community schoolsto center-stage, where they can once again be a focus of family and communitylife, where they can help us strengthen, and where necessary, reweave thefabric of our community. <BR><BR>I applaud the Minneapolis School Board members, administration and facultyfor their commitment to make this change, and thank the Minneapolis citizenswho participated in this important community discussion about our children'swelfare. <BR><BR>As we all know, this matter is not quite closed. The State Board of Educationstill must approve a waiver allowing us to proceed with this plan, and weencourage it to do so quickly. <BR><BR><HR><BR><H3><STRONG>Building 21st Century Capacity: 1996</STRONG> </H3><BR>The State of the City Address gives us an opportunity at the beginning ofeach year not only to review our progress, but to look forward to the future.It's a time to renew our vision of Minneapolis as a prosperous and culturallyvibrant city, as a city that asserts its place in the global economy, anda city that does now, and will continue, to serve as the cultural and economicgateway to the state of Minnesota. <BR><BR>If we are going to continue to serve as that gateway, we must be preparedto change and keep pace with the rest of the world. We can prepare for thefuture by building our city's capacity for the 21st Century. <BR><BR>We have worked hard in the last two years to build the capacity of Citygovernment -- upgrading our own management and technology systems, streamliningoperations and reducing costs, to prepare for the days ahead. I'd like tothank the City's management team for their great work, and I would likeall Charter Department heads to please stand up. <BR><BR>We also have also created powerful tools -- including those housing, employment,business and police programs I have just mentioned -- to help the communitybuild 21st-century capacity. Now, in the coming year, we must work on applyingthese tools strategically in each of those four areas we said are criticalto our citizens: jobs, housing, education and public safety. <BR><BR><HR><BR><H3><STRONG>Building Capacity with Jobs and Economic Development</STRONG></H3><BR>First, jobs. Let me share something with you. Last month, while I was atthe U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington, I visited the Frederick DouglassMuseum. On the wall was a framed quotation that has haunted me ever sincemy return. Listen to what Frederick Douglass had to say: &quot;Neither we,nor any other people, will ever be respected 'till we respect ourselves,and we will never respect ourselves 'till we have the means to live respectably.&quot;<BR><BR>How do we help citizens gain respectability? By giving them an education.By giving them a job. Give them a job, so they can pay their own way, providefor their children, buy their own house, take a vacation. <BR><BR>We need a sound jobs-creation strategy that brings more community educationand career training to city neighborhoods in which there is high unemployment.<BR><BR>The strategy needs to begin with gearing up Minneapolis businesses to becompetitive in the global economy. In July the Metropolitan Council andthe Humphrey Institute released a study identifying four industries thatmust lead the way. They are: printing and publishing, machinery and metalworking,computers and software and bio-medical technologies. I call them our &quot;horizonindustries.&quot; <BR><BR>In 1996 the MCDA, which is newly focused on nurturing our home-grown businesses,will survey Minneapolis firms in these horizon industries to determine theirfuture needs. Then, to ensure that they grow and prosper, we will assistthem with their financing; we will provide them a work-force trained tomeet their specific needs; we will help them locate their facilities inadvantageous locations; and, if necessary, we will provide them loans tohelp them purchase the equipment they need. <BR><BR>As we grow and prosper we want to preserve and protect our heritage, includingour historic buildings. But the costs of preservation can be prohibitive.We are moving forward in this session of the Legislature to establish aHeritage and Historic Tax Increment Subdistrict to help us redevelop ourhistoric buildings. <BR><BR>This district will include all Minneapolis properties on the National Registerof Historic Buildings. It will be a tool to help us, for example, preservethe Grain Belt building, the Ivy Tower, and buildings in the Warehouse andCentral Riverfront areas -- all of them part of the architectural heritagethat makes Minneapolis unique. <BR><BR>Block E is an important economic development opportunity because it hasthe potential to be a linchpin for all downtown, connecting the warehouse,shopping and entertainment districts. One of our community's foremost expertsin finance, real estate and development, Mr. Bill Reiling of Towle FinancialServices, recently commented that &quot;how (we use) Block E is a 100-yeardecision.&quot; He is right. We must not force something to happen therejust to satisfy a desire to move quickly. <BR><BR>In 1996 we will continue to use our best resources to help us make gooddecisions on Block E. I am happy to announce today that Mr. Reiling hasagreed to share his wisdom and experience with us by serving pro bono asa senior adviser to the City and the MCDA, and to help us put together astrategic development plan for Block E. <BR><BR>Mr. Reiling wanted to be with us today, but, shrewd decision-maker thathe is, he apparently determined that in view of our 100-year record coldhe perhaps would rather be elsewhere -- I think he's playing golf in Florida!So even though he can't hear us, let's give him a hand to show him our appreciation!<BR><BR>We need economic development throughout our city, not only downtown. Thisyear we must get serious about redesigning the major commercial corridorthat cuts across South Minneapolis: Lake Street. We must rethink where toimprove its commercial nodes in relation to nearby population centers, andfind the capital needed for redevelopment. The MCDA has been working withthe Neighborhood Revitalization Program to develop a city-wide CoordinatedNeighborhood Commercial District Revitalization Plan. In December the CityCouncil identified Lake Street as its first area of focus. Our goal is tobegin implementing the plan for Lake Street redevelopment by July 1, andlaunch the commercial revitalization of our South Minneapolis neighborhoods.<BR><BR>Minneapolis is blessed with an extraordinary gift: the Mississippi riverfront.We've been working on it for 25 years, dating back at least to the early1970s when we drew up a Central Riverfront plan. Today we have NicolletIsland, the Whitney Hotel, and a stunning suspension bridge. Lovely townhouseand condominium communities have sprung up in the past two decades, withnames that proudly reflect the area's history and beauty: Lourdes Square,La Rive, The Falls, The Pinnacle, Winslow House and Riverwest. <BR><BR>This year on the riverfront, we must and we will complete the Great RiverRoad, and open the long-awaited St. Anthony Falls Historic InterpretiveTrail. We will work with the University of Minnesota to move the steam plantoff-river. I congratulate and thank the Board of Regents for sharing ourvision for reclaiming our great Riverfront, and we hope the Legislaturedoes, too. Thank you, Council Member Campbell, for your leadership on thisissue. <BR><BR>With much of the Central Riverfront development completed, it is time tobring the same inspired vision, careful planning and long-term commitmentto the northern part of the river. I am asking the Planning Department andthe MCDA to make Upper Riverfront Redevelopment, in North and NortheastMinneapolis, a top priority. <BR><BR>The Upper River Citizens Advisory Committee, chaired by Michael Rainville,has already begun to explore how we can integrate the beauty of the riverinto the surrounding neighborhoods. Now we must complete that plan, emphasizingpublic access, environmental quality, and a thoughtful transition away fromuses that degrade the riverfront and its surrounding neighborhoods. In theirplace we want residential, recreational, commercial and industrial usesthat are more river-friendly. <BR><BR><HR><BR><H3><STRONG>Building Capacity with Housing</STRONG></H3>Now let's consider housing. The rate of single-family home-ownership isrelatively high in Minneapolis -- almost 90 percent. <BR><BR>But it's a different story in some neighborhoods: On the Near North sideit is 71 percent, a drop of 16 percent from 1984; in Phillips, it is 64percent -- a drop of 18 percent in just 12 years. <BR><BR>We are trying to build stability in our neighborhoods, but we will not succeeduntil we focus our resources strategically in the two neighborhoods withthe greatest housing and employment needs -- Phillips and the Near Northside. As I pointed out a few moments ago, the City of Minneapolis now hasexcellent job- and business-development tools. This year, let's put themto work in the neighborhoods that need them the most. <BR><BR>Minneapolis needs the federal government to be a strong housing partner.Last month at the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Henry Cisneros, Secretary ofHousing and Urban Development suggested that the federal government createa way for people to apply their Section 8 housing funds to the purchaseof a new house. This is the kind of innovative programming we need fromthe federal government -- real solutions that help people who are strugglingto improve their lives. <BR><BR>We must tap the resources of the great University we are privileged to havein our city to help us find solutions locally. I have begun discussionsabout creating a model of cooperation between residents of the GlendaleHousing Project and their local PICA/Headstart participants, and the Universityof Minnesota. We want to explore how to better the lives of these residentsand their children. We will look to our federal government partners to supportthis pilot project. <BR><BR>One of the things that keeps a downtown alive is a vigorous downtown residentialcommunity. Our downtown neighborhoods are already about 20,000 residents-strong-- in Loring and Elliot Park, and along the Mississippi Riverfront. We willfurther strengthen these great residential neighborhoods by introducinganother 1,500 residential units. Let me highlight a few. <BLOCKQUOTE>Sixty beautiful townhome condominiums at The Landings at SawMill Run, near the Plymouth Bridge; <BR><BR>Forty-one condominium lofts in the Northstar Woolen Mills building nearour newly restored Stone Arch Bridge;<BR><BR>Thirty-nine apartment units at the old Tension Envelope Building in theWarehouse district; <BR><BR>Twenty townhouses and 20 low-income apartments on the Marquette Block rightbehind Lourdes Square;<BR><BR>And at Heritage Landing in the Itasca area, 612 beautiful townhouse condominiums,which will be the largest homeowner development in Minneapolis!</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>This bricks-and-mortar investment is a solid vote of confidence in the futureof our downtown. I congratulate the Downtown Council, Chamber of Commerce,the Downtown Residents Association, and the City Council for their hardwork and continuing commitment in our great city and our great downtown.<BR><BR><HR><BR><H3><STRONG>Building Capacity with Education</STRONG></H3>Next, let us look at what we must do for education. In Minneapolis, it isthe School Board -- not the City -- that determines what happens insidethe school building. But the City can and must support the schools in anumber of ways. <BR><BR>One way is to make sure our children are prepared to learn and make thebest of their learning opportunities. In January the SEARCH Institute releasedan in-depth study of adolescent youth in Minneapolis that identified thedevelopmental assets that are absolutely crucial to youth development. Theyrange from experiencing family love and support to feeling safe; from doinghomework to having positive values. The report contained shocking news,however: The average young person in Minneapolis, regardless of race orgender, has fewer than half the assets needed to grow up strong and healthy.<BR><BR>Furthermore, the study produced stunningly convincing statistics to showthat youths who lack assets are more likely to be depressed, violent, andinvolved with drugs. The study makes it clear that the failure of the adultsin Minneapolis to care for their children is creating a problem of tragicproportions. <BR><BR>At the same time the study offers much hope. It makes it clear that thethings we must do to bring this youth tragedy to a close are not mysterious.Many are simple and obvious things, like reading to our children, makingsure children have a chance to see their grandparents, talking to neighborhoodyoungsters. There are other things organizations can do -- churches, neighborhoodgroups, businesses. <BR><BR>Today we are launching a campaign we want every Minneapolis adult to join-- a campaign to Invest in Children. The Youth Coordinating Board has printedup cards -- like little recipe cards -- with the list of things the studysuggests you can do to support our youth. There's a card for you if youare a parent, a neighbor, a teacher or a journalist; if you own a business,work for a non-profit, or are active in a church. We have them right outsidethe gym. I ask everyone here to pick one up. Study it, and use it to inspireyour own activities to change the life of a child. <BR><BR>Let me tell you the first thing the City is going to do to respond to thecall to Invest in Children. We must do a better job of engaging our youthin positive after-school activities. Places to Grow, another SEARCH Institutestudy, commissioned by my office, says we already have enough activitiesfor our youth -- the problem is that our young people just don't know aboutthem. Now, in this electronic age, there is no reason Minneapolis can'thave a hotline, so that any child old enough to use the phone can find activitiesthat are constructive, interesting and fun. This hotline must be up andrunning by June 1. <BR><BR>Education is not just for children. In the 21st Century, life-long educationwill be more important than ever. I am pleased that this year the MinneapolisPublic Library System will begin a renovation of the historic Hosmer Library,and part of this renovation will be a Technology Learning Center. The librarysystem will also be able, by the end of this year, to hook its customersup to the Internet and a vast array of other technological highways. <BR><BR><HR><BR><H3><STRONG>Building Capacity with Public Safety</STRONG></H3><BR>We have worked hard to create community schools for our children. But ina few neighborhoods, children are afraid to walk to those schools; and theirparents don't want to send them. Why? Because they are surrounded by boarded-upbuildings, crack houses, and sometimes even the sound of gunfire. A fewyears ago we created drug-free zones around our public schools. We havethe drug-free signs around the schools -- you've seen them. But let's behonest: What do they really mean? They represent good laws, but are thoselaws being used to the extent possible? <BR><BR>This year we must put real meaning behind those signs, real strategies towork around our schools and parks. I am asking the Police Chief and CityCoordinator to recommend how to use the total resources of the City to closedown crack houses, rehabilitate or tear down the boarded buildings aroundour schools and parks, and help in any other way to create real drug-freezones. Our children must be guaranteed safe passage as they walk to andfrom schools and parks! <BR><BR>Chief Olson has already directed his precinct commanders to work with eachschool principal to meet the school's specific safety needs. He has relievedschool liaison officers of their other duties to work exclusively with theschools. I am asking the other city departments to follow suit and makeour children a number-one priority. We are making major investments in communityschools. We must also invest time and resources in the communities thatsurround them. <BR><BR>Only a few years ago juvenile crime meant a joyride in a stolen car or aschoolyard fight. In 1995, it meant that 21 of our 97 homicides were committedby youth -- at a time when most other serious juvenile crimes were on thedecline. I asked our Health Department to analyze juvenile homicide, tohelp us understand why it is increasing. The Department's findings werepresented at an all-day community meeting attended by some 200 citizens,as well as by several Council Members. The Department is working with thosecitizens to identify how to intervene in what is, without a doubt, our community'smost disturbing, and dangerous, problem. <BR><BR>Most juvenile crime is committed right after children leave school, whenthey are unsupervised and have nothing constructive to do. I ask the MinneapolisSchool Board to consider changing the hours school is in session, so thatchildren can stay safely in school until their parents come home from work.We need to forge the link between school and after-school activities. Iam committed to finding resources to make this happen. <BR><BR>It is no secret that illegal drugs are driving much of today's crime, includingour high homicide rate. Because the drug problem is complex, affecting notonly public safety, but physical and mental health, and the welfare of entirefamilies, we have been working to coordinate the City's law-enforcementresources with Hennepin County's law enforcement, financial assistance andchemical health services. <BR><BR>Last year I announced a program in which officers making drug arrests refercocaine-addicted mothers to Hennepin County Chemical Dependency services.Progress was slow, but women did seek treatment through this program ona voluntary basis, and we learned that by integrating our anti-drug activitieswith the County's, we were on the right track. <BR><BR>We have also been conducting &quot;knock and talks.&quot; Officers fromSAFE and patrol units visit addresses where drug activity is suspected.If they are allowed inside, they provide referral information about Countychemical-dependency programs, and warn the parties that if they don't changetheir ways, they can expected to get busted. <BR><BR>Now I am proposing that we take another step with the County. Professionalswho work in this area believe that when drug activities are conducted inthe home, it is almost certain that household funds -- including assistancepayments -- are being mismanaged. We do know that a certain amount of publicassistance funds wind up in the hands of drug dealers. I am asking HennepinCounty to review the cases of clients convicted of drug charges to determineif there is mismanagement of public funds, and if there is, to provide futureassistance mostly in the form of vendor payments for rent, utilities andother necessities, instead of cash. <BR><BR>In addition, because there are chemically dependent recipients of publicassistance who want help in getting over their addiction, I propose thatwe step up our efforts to encourage them to join the vendor program on avoluntary basis. Some people may view this program as punitive, but we havea drug crisis in our city, and we must take bold steps. The vendor programwill help ensure that the first of the month will no longer be the day thedrug man gets paid in Minneapolis! <BR><BR><HR><BR><H3><STRONG>Regional Issues</STRONG> </H3><BR>Because Minneapolis is the economic gateway for the region, it faces issuesthat are regional in scope, and require regional cooperation. This yearwe will face four issues that have enormous impact on the role the city,the state and the region will play in the global economy. <BR><BR>The first is the expansion of the Convention Center. Last year, one outof every 20 Minnesota businesses exhibited at the Convention Center -- and80 percent were from outside Minneapolis! Convention Center visitors fromoutside Minnesota spent $129 million here last year, and, if the facilityis expanded, they will contribute $14 million in tax revenue every year.<BR><BR>No wonder Twin Cities Business Monthly recently reported that ConventionCenter expansion is one of the top legislative priorities of Twin Citiesbusiness leaders. I call on business leaders throughout the region to helpMinneapolis get the Convention center expansion included in the 1996 legislativebonding bill. The expansion creates 4,000 new jobs that pay good wages andbenefits. Who could be against that? <BR><BR>In 1995 I appointed an Airport Task Force to identify all of the vestedinterests Minneapolis has in the airport: economic, social and aesthetic.The Task Force will present its recommendations to the City Council on February13. <BR><BR>It is clear that the debate about the location of the airport will cometo a conclusion soon -- I personally hope not before the public has itssay. Whatever the decision, Minneapolis must be assured that substantialresources and tools will be set aside for further sound insulation and otherneighborhood noise-mitigation efforts. And top that off with Stage III aircraft.Now! <BR><BR>Another important regional issue is transit. Last fall the Metropolitanarea experienced its first transit strike in more than 25 years. Althoughthe popular perception was that not many problems were created by the strike,city residents suffered. People couldn't get to work, go shopping or getto medical appointments. We understand that the MCTO needs better funding.But that funding problem must not be solved at the expense of people whohave no alternative to public transportation! <BR><BR>The strike was a wake-up call. It was warning us that that we must movequickly to secure a stable, independent funding source for metropolitantransit, such as the general sales tax; that we must design a transit systemto meet the needs of the people who need it the most, including those inthe city who want to get to suburban jobs, a system that provides an attractivealternative to the private car. The City of Minneapolis will be at the Legislatureworking for this kind of resolution. <BR><BR>The financial strength of Minneapolis has permitted us -- over several decades-- to play a key role in supporting the sports and entertainment that contributeso significantly to the state and regional economies. As the baseball stadiumdiscussion at the Legislature continues, the City must move forward andidentify the most appropriate location for the new ballpark. I stronglybelieve that Minneapolis has the infrastructure to support new sports andentertainment facilities. The stadium must be in downtown Minneapolis! <BR><BR><HR><BR><H3><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></H3><BR>As I conclude this State of the City Address, I want to remind you of afew things. In the past two years we have worked hard to develop the toolswe need to create capacity for the 21st Century. Now we have arrived atthe point where we can put those tools to work. <BR><BR>We created clear housing principles and powerful finance tools. Now we mustuse them strategically to build stability, especially in the neighborhoodsthat need it the most. <BR><BR>We strengthened the MCDA and focused it on serving businesses that havetheir roots here and will provide jobs for our residents. Now we must focusits work even more closely on the industries that will figure prominentlyon the horizon of the 21st Century, and work more closely with those neighborhoodswith high unemployment. <BR><BR>We are creating community schools for our children. Now we must build thecommunity structures -- in our homes, neighborhoods, churches and localbusinesses -- to support them so they will be successful. <BR><BR>We are reforming and decentralizing the Minneapolis Police Department. Thosechanges allow the department to enter partnerships with citizens on theneighborhood level so we can all fight crime together and make our citysafe. <BR><BR>We cannot do this alone. Now, more than ever, we need the support and collaborativeefforts of the City Council and our citizens to keep this city great. Let'sdo it! <BR><BR>Thank you. <BR><BR><BR><HR><BR><BR><H5>Email your comments and questions to <I><A HREF="mailto:opa_mpls@ci.mpls.mn.us">opa_mpls@ci.mpls.mn.us</A></I></H5></BODY></HTML>

  <TITLE>Winter Parking Ban 1996-1997</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">

<H2>City Bans Parking on Even Side of Residential Streets</H2>

<P>December 17, 1996 -- Due to high levels of snow accumulation, Minneapolis
officials have determined that it will be necessary to ban parking on the
even side of residential streets for the remainder of the winter.</P>

<P>The ban will begin at 8 a.m. Wednesday, December 18, when the current
Snow Emergency ends. It will remain in effect until April 1 or until the
City is confident that the snow season is over.</P>

<P>&quot;We realize this will inconvenience many Minneapolis residents,&quot;
says Public Works Director David Sonnenberg, &quot;but the welfare and safety
of the public in terms of our ability to get emergency vehicles through
the streets must take precedence over the inconvenience.&quot;</P>

<P>Sonnenberg adds that last winter was the first time since the winter of
1991-92 that the City had to restrict parking to one side of the street.
&quot;We have already received as much snowfall this season as we had by
mid-January last winter,&quot; he says.</P>

<P>During Snow Emergencies, cars will be allowed to park on the even side
of the street on the odd-side plowing day. Vehicles parked on the even side
any other time will be subject to tagging and towing. Enforcement will begin
immediately.</P>

<P>Complete Snow Emergency parking information is always available on 348-SNOW,
the City's 23-hour hotline, as well as City Cable Channel 34 and the City
web site at <A HREF="http://www.ci.mpls.mn.us/index.html">www.ci.mpls.mn.us</A>.</P>

<P>To ensure public safety after heavy snowfalls, Sonnenberg also reminds
residents and business owners to clear their sidewalks down to the pavement,
across the full width, and all the way to the corner after the plows have
gone by for the last time. City ordinances require that sidewalks of single-family
homes and duplexes be cleared within 24 hours after a snowfall. Sidewalks
in commercial areas and adjacent to apartment buildings must be cleared
within four daytime hours.</P>

<TITLE>THE HOMESTEAD CLASSIFICATION</TITLE>

<META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Word 2.0z Beta">
</HEAD>

<BODY>

<H2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT HOMESTEADING A PROPERTY</H2>

<H4>Why do people apply for a homestead classification?</H4>

<P>
The State of Minnesota encourages home ownership by providing
owner-occupied properties reduced property taxes. The reduction
is very beneficial to the property owner. The owner of a homestead
property valued under $72,000 pays 54% less taxes than a non-homestead
property. As the property value increases, the percentage of reduction
decreases. 
<H4>Who can receive this benefit?</H4>

<P>
If you own real property and you, or a <A HREF="relative.html">qualifying relative</A>, occupy
the property on the 1st of December, you may apply for homestead
status.
<H4>What does ownership mean?</H4>

<P>
You must have a valid deed granting you title to the property.
In order to be recognized as a valid deed, the deed must be registered
with the Hennepin County Registrar of Deed. 
<H4>What does occupy mean?</H4>

<P>
You and all other owners must use the property as your main residence,
in other words, you must live there. Temporary and token occupancy
is not considered sufficient to receive homestead treatment. If
more than one person owns the property and any of the owners do
not reside at the property, then the property may receive a <U>fractional</U>
homestead classification.
<H4>Can a relative homestead a property for me?</H4>

<P>
<A HREF="relative.html">Qualifying relatives</A> may become substitute occupants for the property
owner. <BR>
Qualifying relatives include <U>only</U> the following: parent,
child, stepparent, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother,
sister, uncle, and aunt.
<H4>I own an apartment building, can I homestead it?</H4>

<P>
Just about any type of property that can be lived in can be classified
as homestead. However, unlike common residential properties, apartment
buildings with four or more units and other types of properties
are usually limited to receiving the homestead treatment on the
first $72,000 of market value.
<H4>How do I apply for a homestead classification?</H4>

<P>
Inform the City Assessor that you own a property and that you,
or a qualifying relative, occupy the property. Provide the City
Assessor with documentation to prove your claim. This may done
by fax, mail, or in person.
<H4>When do I need to apply?</H4>

<P>
The sooner the better after purchasing and moving into your home.
If you purchase and occupy non-homestead property before December
1, and apply for homestead treatment before December 15, then
the homestead level of taxation will begin in the next year.
<H4>Where can I get more information on homesteads?</H4>

Please, call or write us. Our address and phone number follow:

                              contact you.
</PRE>

<P>
If the documents provided show that your new home should be classified
as homestead, then you can expect the following:
<OL>
<LI>If the property <B>was not</B> previously classified as homestead,
then within ten days of receiving your request, you will receive
by mail an application that must be signed by all the homesteaders
and returned to the City Assessor.
<LI>Within ten days of the 2<U>nd</U> of January you will receive
by mail an application that must be signed by all the homesteaders
and returned to the City Assessor. 
</OL>

<P>
Failure to sign and return the application will result in the
property being classified <BR>
as non-homestead.
<P>
Applications are only sent in the first year after purchasing
the new home. So, if you sell or move out of your home, then you
must inform the City Assessor within 30 days of vacating or selling
the home.

Discussions have led to a greater appreciation of the roleand expertise of each party and how each may continue to support the otherin the spirit of the franchise that has existed since 1983. <BR><BR>All parties are in the process of negotiating a lease agreement, whereinthe City will lease to Paragon all PEG (public, educational, government)access channel capacity until the year 2004. The City through the MTN willreserve four channels on the 'A' cable (32,33,34,35) and eight channelson the 'B' cable (32,33,34,35,39,42,46,49) for video PEG access programming.Under these terms, the City will be returning 18 channels to Paragon. <BR><BR>In exchange, Paragon will expand the City's existing Institutional networkby adding a total of 25 new sites, will construct a dedicated fiber opticbased voice, video and data system for the Public Schools and constructa fiber connection from Paragon head-end directly to the MTN. <BR><A NAME="At Stake"></A><HR><H2>What's at Stake </H2><B>The City Will Receive </B><BR>The City of Minneapolis will receive: A fiber optic/coaxial network connectingCity Hall with: <UL>  <LI>MCDA   <LI>2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th Precincts   <LI>Traffic Center   <LI>Street Department   <LI>Equipment Division   <LI>Convention Center   <LI>Minneapolis Telecommunications Network (MTN) </UL><BR>Paragon values this installed infrastructure at $354, 520* Paragon shallprovide 24 hour a day maintenance for the network, which Paragon valuesat $75,000 annually* A fee from Paragon for use of the 18 channels. Thefranchise designates it as a nominal fee.** <H5>*No independent valuation currently exists <BR>**Formula for setting the &quot;nominal fee&quot; is yet to be determined</H5><BR><B>The Minneapolis Public Schools will receive</B><BR>Fiber I-Net connections to seven (7) schools including: <UL>  <LI>Anthony   <LI>Sanford   <LI>Anwatin   <LI>Northeast   <LI>Folwell   <LI>Olson Middle   <LI>Franklin </UL>Fiber replacements of existing Coax I-Net connections to: <UL>  <LI>North High School   <LI>Roosevelt High School </UL>The following five (5) high schools will remain on their existing I-Netconnections but will get transmission equipment to connect the schools together:<BR>Edison <BR>Henry <BR>Southwest <BR>South <BR>Washburn <BR>A fiber I-Net connection will be installed at the Work Opportunity Center.The District Service Center, currently on fiber, will receive new switchingequipment. The Fire Training Center will remain on coax and receive newequipment. All seventeen (17) sites will be upgraded to two-way video capability,allowing full interactive and remote learning participation from each site.<BR><BR>Paragon figures this as an initial projected cost of $495,597*. <H5>*No independent valuation currently exists </H5><BR><B>The MTN will receive</B><BR>Paragon Cable will build and maintain fiber optic connections between theMTN's St. Anthony Main (SAM) facilities and the cable system head-end onPlymouth Avenue North. With this fiber link, the technical quality willimprove and allow the MTN to continue to broadcast live and with remotefeeds. Paragon's installation of the fiber will allow MTN to playback tapesfrom their SAM location with virtually no loss in signal to the cable head-end.Paragon has agreed to pay for the move and consolidation of MTN's playbackequipment and staff. MTN will have high speed access to the Internet atthe Supercomputer Center. This will allow MTN to increase their serviceto non-profit organizations. <BR><BR>In addition, Paragon has agreed not to challenge MTN fundraising relatedto its non-profit Internet services. Paragon Cable will continue semi-annualpayments to the MTN. <BR><BR>Paragon values this investment at $243, 410* <H5>*No independent valuation currently exists </H5><BR><B>The Minneapolis Community and Residents will receive</B><BR>An Expanded Institutional Network, which will give residents more efficientand varied methods to communicate with City offices and staff. More cableprogramming will be added to the cable service, as Paragon receives morechannels. Paragon will add 5 additional cable programs per year. New commercialservices being considered include: The Home and Garden Channel, the InternationalChannel, MS/NBC, Fox News, The Outdoor Network, America's Health Network,Speed Vision and The Classic Sports Network. High speed access to the Internetfor non-profit organizations through the MTN and the Supercomputer Center.Future competition in the marketplace. As Paragon becomes more competitivewith US WEST for residential services such as voice, data (Internet) andvideo programming, prices may lower and the variety of services will increase.<BR><A NAME="Benefits"></A><HR><H2>Benefits and Drawbacks</H2><B>How City Government and City Schools will Benefit with a High Speed Network</B><BR>The system will meet the communication needs of a growing City and Schoolorganization, as well as the growing communication expectations of its citizensand students. Exclusive, high reliability lines at key locations for theCity and the Schools will improve employee productivity and enhance public/studentsafety. <BR><BR>Schools will use the expanded Institutional Network to create &quot;virtual&quot;classrooms and alternative ways of reaching students and managing schools(3 to 7 years out). The system for the Schools, City and MTN will each beindependent, but will be able to be interconnected and expanded. <BR><BR>Both the City and the Schools will have a high-speed internet connectionthrough the MTN and the Supercomputer Center. <BR><BR>The City will use the expanded I-net for high speed communications. TheI-net could replace pieces of CityNet and it could save the City rentalcharges from companies such as US WEST and Norstan (3 to 7 years out). Forexample, the City could save $50,000 annually in US WEST data line chargesin 1997. The City and the Schools could save more in maintenance/lease costsin 1998 and beyond* <H5>*We do not have accurate estimates at this time </H5><BR><B>Paragon's benefits will include</B><BR>Relief from current franchise language that obligates Paragon to providethe City with 25% of its channel capacity for public access programming.Paragon will receive eighteen (18) more channels which will allow them toadd more programming, which will in turn increase Paragon's revenue. <BR><BR>The US telecommunications market is in the midst of tremendous and rapidchange -- toward competition within and a convergence of cable TV, computerand telephone industries. The additional channels will help Paragon staycompetitive with entrants into the telecommunications marketplace such assatellite and microwave multi- channels providers. Paragon will have a highermarket value -- should Time Warner, Inc. decide to sell the Paragon system.Currently, it is not in the interest of Paragon to invest in its systemand increase its market value, where 25% of the capacity is reserved forthe public. <BR><BR>Paragon will receive back 2,320 square feet of office space in the 801 Plymouthlocation. (The space is currently used by the MTN for their tape playback.)Paragon will be released from the franchise obligation to provide FM service.Paragon has agreed to provide an antenna allowing receipt of these signalsto interested subscribers. <BR><BR><B>What is the City of Minneapolis giving up? </B><BR>Minneapolis will be giving up 18 channels, by giving up the franchise languagethat requires 25% of system capacity be reserved for public access* TheCity does retain the right to claim additional PEG channels when needed.With additional funding**, these 18 channels could be used by the City foradditional programming such as: <UL>  <LI>Stolen goods preview channel   <LI>Live phone-in counseling sessions   <LI>City Council Committee meetings   <LI>Interactive voting channel </UL>(These unused channels have little or no &quot;market value&quot; to theCity because according to our franchise agreement, we cannot use them tocompete against Paragon or lease them to a Paragon competitor. We do nothave the revenue potential from non-profit sources.) <BR><BR>The City would also give up 2,320 square feet of office space located atParagon's head-end at 801 Plymouth Avenue North. <H5>*The nature of this lease back is an undecided issue <BR>** This additional funding could come from the 1.5M franchise fee the Cityreceives annually from Paragon. Currently, these dollars are funneled directlyinto the General Fund. </H5><A NAME="Issues"></A><HR><H2>Outstanding Issues </H2>(1) Terms of the Lease-back arrangement. Does the City want to give up the25% franchise language? <BR>(2) Fair Use Value for Paragon using the City's eighteen (18) channels.<BR>(3) I-net Ownership <BR>(4) Service Level Agreement--The City must be able in insure quality ofnetwork &quot;up-time.&quot; Maintenance requirements must be agreed upon.<BR><A NAME="Direction"></A><A HREF="#Direction"> </A><HR><H2>Direction to City Staff By November 1, 1996</H2><UL>  <LI>Conduct an independent study of Time Warner, Inc.'s business strategyand Time Warner, Inc.'s projected value of the 18 channels. This independentstudy will be conducted by Larry Greenberg at a cost of $10,000 and willallow the City to negotiate a channel usage fee that reflects a fair andreasonable price, using a non- disclosure approach.   <LI>Complete a detailed analysis of future cost/benefit of the fiber I-Net.   <LI>Resolve the terms of the lease-back arrangement.   <LI>Propose an interim agreement, wherein Paragon can immediately beginconstruction on laying fiber to the police precincts.

<P>The Minneapolis Community Development Agency (MCDA) is an arm of the City
of Minneapolis, directed by a Board of Commissioners consisting of the 13
members of the <A HREF="/departments/city-council/index.html">Minneapolis
City Council</A>. The MCDA is administered by an executive director.

<P>The MCDA seeks to sustain and improve the residential, economic, and aesthetic
environment of the city for the benefit of residents, employees, and businesses
through the implementation of development financing programs. To accomplish these
goals the MCDA:

<UL>
	<P><LI>Sells bonds and assists in land acquisition and development for a
	variety of commercial, industrial, business, health-care, nursing home and
	educational facilities.

	<P><LI>Attracts and supports new and existing businesses by providing loans
	and other assistance to settle, expand, or relocate.

	<P><LI>Provides grants, low-interest mortgages, and home improvement and
	substantial rehabilitation loans to homeowners to build, buy, or upgrade
	their homes.

	<P><LI>Provides loans to rental-property owners to upgrade their buildings.

	<P><LI>Provides financing and other assistance to provide affordable housing
	for residents, particularly low- and middle-income families.

	<P><LI>Removes or rehabs blighted buildings and works with nonprofit and
	neighborhood organizations to sell rehabbed or new homes to low- and
	middle-income owner-occupants at affordable prices.

	<P><LI>Provides funding, programs, and other assistance to neighborhood
	organizations to revitalize neighborhoods.
</UL>

<P>Most of the revenue for MCDA activities is generated by the sale of bonds and
activity from development districts, current investment, and real estate
proceeds. The MCDA also administers funding from various state and federal
sources such as Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and the Minnesota
Housing Finance Agency (MHFA).

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Instructions</H2>

<P>In order to vote by absentee ballot you must be an eligible voter, a
resident of the election precinct indicated by your legal residence address
on this application, and do not intend to abandon this residence prior to
election day. Please note that Minnesota law provides that it is a felony
to make a false or untrue statement in an application for an absentee ballot,
to apply for an absentee ballot more than once in an election with the intent
to cast an illegal ballot, to exhibit a ballot marked by a person to another
person, or to violate an absentee ballot provision for the purpose of casting
an illegal vote in a precinct or to assist anyone to cast an illegal vote.
<BR>
<BR>
Be sure to check the appropriate box indicating why you are unable to go
to your polling place on election day; these are the only reasons that entitle
you to vote by absentee ballot. <BR>
<BR>
An eligible voter who reasonably expects to be permanently unable to go
to the polling place on election day because of illness or disability may
apply to automatically receive an absentee ballot application before each
election and to have the status as a permanent absentee voter. <BR>
<BR>
Be sure to give your correct legal residence address as completely as possible,
since this is used to verify your precinct number. <BR>
<BR>
Be sure to sign the application. <BR>
<BR>
Return the completed application as soon as possible to the Minneapolis
Elections Department. You may fax the application to 673-3399. <BR>
<BR>
Your absentee ballot will be mailed or delivered to you as soon as they
are available. <BR>
<BR>

OR GENERAL ELECTION, OR BOTH. <BR>
<BR>
Do not submit more than one application for each election. <BR>

<P>City of Minneapolis, Department of Public Works, Street Maintenance Division
<H2>Street Sweeping and Fall Leaf Removal Information</H2>
<P>
<HR width=100%>
<P>
The Street Maintenance Division will start the fall sweeping and leaf removal of the City's streets and parkways on October 22. Fall sweeping and leaf removal will be complete in approximately one month.
<P>
Please do not rake any additional leaves into the street. Leaves in the street cause a variety of problems: 
<UL><LI>Plug drains when it rains.
<LI>Create a fire hazard when cars park in them.
<LI>Increase danger to small children who like to play in the leaf piles.
<LI>Become slippery when wet and can cause car accidents.
<LI>Blow into previously raked yards.
<LI>If  raked out after the sweeping has been done, leaves remain in the street all winter causing drainage problems.</UL>
For information about bagging fall leaves and collection, see the <A HREF="http:solid-waste/yw.html">yard waste collection</A> page.
<P>
Posting of "No Parking" signs will be done the morning of the day prior to the actual sweeping.	Business and commercial areas will be a priority for sweeping each day so as to restore critically needed parking as soon as possible. Signs will be removed on the same day as the sweeping occurs.
<P>
For questions or more information about the fall street sweepings and leaf removal, call the Street Maintenance Division at 673-5720.

Triple-A is the highest credit rating category for municipal bonds. <p>The rating agencies noted that the City reduced its overall bonded indebtedness by $38 million in 1995. The reduction occurred mostly in tax increment bonds. The City's debt levels are expected to continue declining as future borrowing will be largely limited to routine improvements.   <p>The rating agencies said that Minneapolis has maintained its position as the economic center of the growing seven-county metropolitan area. The city's tax base is recovering from an oversupply of office space. Residential values continue to increase and commercial values have increased significantly. Estimated fair market value of taxable property increased 14.3 percent from $11.9 billion in 1994 to $13.6 billion in 1995. <p>"Minneapolis has remained strong through prudent financial management," said John Moir, City Finance Officer. "By reaffirming the City's AAA/Aaa bond ratings, the rating agencies have shown complete confidence in the City's financial management controls and practices."<p>Mayor Sayles Belton says she hopes that the Governor and the legislators pay attention to the ratings reports. "Moody's describes us as the economic center of this region," she said. "Our 8 percent of the population pays 11 percent of the state's income taxes and 18 percent of corporate taxes. Twelve percent of the state's work force is employed in Minneapolis. This city carries more than its own weight and it's in the state's best interest to keep our city strong."<p>Minneapolis is one of only two cities its size to hold AAA rating from both Moody's and Standard & Poor's. The other city is Charlotte, North Carolina.<p>The City sold $68.5 million of general obligation refunding bonds Thursday. The current low interest rates will reduce the interest expense for Minneapolis taxpayers.State of the City set for Feb. 7Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton will deliver her 1996 State of the City Address at 5 p.m. Wednesday, February 7, at Jenny Lind School, 5025 Bryant Avenue North. The address is free and open to the public. It will also be aired on City Cable 34.`<P><hr><H2>Jan. 12 City Council Actions</H2>At its regular meeting on January 12 the Minneapolis City Council:<p>- Reappointed members of the Public Housing Authority and concurred with the Mayor and City Council President on reappointment and appointment of members of the Senior Citizen Advisory Committee.<p>- Authorized acceptance of a $352,000 federal  grant for the Multi-jurisdictional Narcotics Enforcement Task Force and executed related agreements for Hennepin County and City matching funds.<p>- Denied rental dwelling licenses at 2312-14 North 6th St and 10 East 15th St.<p>- Approved demolition of nuisance structures at 3631 Queen Avenue North, 2911 Morgan Av N, 2706 13th Av S and 417 26th Av N.<p>- Authorized an agreement with the Minnesota Department of Health to implement the Immunization Action Plan for 1996.<p>- Authorized staff to participate in a feasibility study of improving street connection from the Parade area to the Bassetts Creek valley and directed that effected neighborhoods be involved.<p>- Accepted donation from the Jay & Rose Phillips Family Foundation to support the Phillips Neighborhood Gateway project.<p>- Allocated a fixed amount to each City Council office with unexpended funds to be returned to the General Fund, recognized additional staff in the Council President's office.<p>- Approved City Council officers and committee assignments for 1996.

The agreement avoids a potentials lawsuit by the County against the City. If approved by the County Board and City Council, the agreement provides that the City will deliver solid waste collected in Minneapolis to the County, as opposed to shipping it to out-of-state landfills. <p>"I never lost faith that the City and County would work out their differences without going to court," said Mayor Sayles Belton. "What happen in our negotiations was that both sides listened to each other, and both gave alittle bit. The City recognized that it was part of the County's disposal system and therefore would participate. That makes this agreement realistic. The County recognized that it should charge the City a reasonable fee. That makes it fair."<p>Videotape of the news conference will air on City Cable 34 Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 6 p.m. for the next several weeks. <P><hr><H2>City Cable 34 Highlight</H2>City Beat, hosted by Kent Robbins, features Assistant City Engineer Brian Lokkesmoe on the parking ban and Planning Director Paul Farmer on The Minneapolis Plan.

With winter comes snowstorms.  And on the heels of the snow comes the salt.  It seems to be everywhere - on your car, your sidewalk, your clothes and shoes.<p>Just how much salt is used in Minneapolis each winter?  That depends on the amount of snowfall and the weather conditions.  Last winter was mild, with little snowfall, and more than 18,000 tons of salt were used.  In addition, over 18,000 tons of sand were applied.<p>The effects of this salt use are most evident on our cars. In fact, half of all automobile corrosion is due to road salt. However, the metal in bridges and underground cables can fall victim to salt corrosion. Roadside trees, shrubs, and grasses are also damaged by salt.<p>Aquatic vegetation can be injured by the chloride in salt.  This occurs when runoff is channeled into small lakes, streams, and wetlands.  With the accumulation of salt on paved surfaces, this threat increases in the spring.  As the snow melts, salt and sand are washed off.  These high concentrations can be toxic to aquatic vegetation.  <p>While there are alternatives to salt, such as potassium chloride, calcium chloride and calcium magnesium acetate, salt remains the best option for ice removal due to its high deicing ability, its usability at low temperatures, and its low cost. The best way to reduce the impact on our water is to reduce our overall salt use.<p>You can minimize your use of salt by following these simple tips:<BLOCKQUOTE> <B>Sun</B>- Use salt on sunny days when it is most effective.<P> <B>Temperature</B>- Use salt at temperatures of 15 degrees F or higher.<P> <B> Shovel</B> - Remove snow as soon as possible after snowfall, before it becomes packed down and icy.  Remember, city ordinances require that sidewalks of single family homes and duplexes be cleared within 24 hours after a snowfall.  <P> <B>Prevent</B> - If snowfall is to be followed by rain, leave snow down to absorb the rain and prevent icy conditions from forming.  Be sure to remove the snow as soon as the rain stops.<P> <B>Sand</B> - Use sand more often.  Call 673-2441 to get your free sidewalk sand.  Sand should be swept up around your home and reused to keep it out of waterways. <P> <B>Store</B> - Keep unused sand or salt in covered buckets.<P> <B>Sweep</B> - Clean up any spilled or excess sand or salt and use it another time.<P> <B>Chip</B> - Get out and chip away at the ice on your sidewalk.  You might even find out that you enjoy the cool, crisp winter air.</BLOCKQUOTE> <P><hr>Questions or comments?

Editor: Bill Carter, 673-2009. FAX: 673-3250. For sign language interpreting call TTY 673-3250. Available in alternative formats. This is Issue 10, Volume 12. The next issue will be March 1. <P><HR><H3>Council Improves Collaboration Between Planning and MCDA</H3>On February 9, the Minneapolis City Council approved an ordinance to improve collaboration between the City's planning and development programs and streamline its development operations. The ordinance requires cooperation and collaboration between the MCDA and the City Planning Department. The MCDA operates the City's development program while the Planning Department is responsible for strategic planning programs. <P>Provisions of the ordinance include:<BLOCKQUOTE>- The MCDA will work with the Planning Department each year to present a report evaluating the effectiveness of MCDA projects and programs, allowing for better strategic planning. - Teams that include staff from MCDA as well as Planning and other City departments will review significant development proposals. The City Council will have substantially less involvement in daily agency management, but it will approve the strategic plans and the annual MCDA budget. - The MCDA executive director will have the authority to implement projects. The ordinance broadens the executive director's authority to include making offers on properties, settling condemnation actions, entering into citizen participation contracts, and increasing or decreasing personnel within an approved budget.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><HR><H3>Home Tour Seeks Volunteers</H3>When more than 40 Minneapolis and Saint Paul homeowners open their doors to visitors May 4 and 5, thousands of people will get a look at the quality and diversity of city living. Tour organizers are seeking volunteers to help promote city living and ensure that the tour runs smoothly. Homes will be open on Saturday, May 4, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday, May 5, from 1 to 5 p.m. Volunteers spend a half day in a home in their area, greeting and monitoring visitors. Beyond a belief in the quality of city living, no special expertise is needed. To volunteer, call 673-3821.<P><HR><H3>Recycling Calendars To Be Sent </H3>City residents will receive recycling calendars by mid-March. The City's Division of Solid Waste and Recycling explained that the delay was caused by negotiations for the City's recycling processing contract. The old contract ended December 31, 1995. "The problem was that we wanted to add boxboard, office paper, and mail; but the vendors all had different specifications," explains Jack Yuzna, Assistant Director of Solid Waste and Recycling. "We did not want to tell our customers one thing, and then change the recycling guidelines a few months later."<P>The new contract should yield an extra $300,000 in recycling revenues this year. The Division of Solid Waste and Recycling says that this, along with the reduced garbage tipping fee at the incinerator, will mean no fee increase for Solid Waste and Recycling services in 1996. For information about Solid Waste and Recycling, call 673-2917. <P> <HR><H3>February 9 City Council Actions</H3>At its regular meeting on February 9 the Minneapolis City Council:- Directed staff to negotiate development terms for North Star Woolen Mill Residential Project.- Approved actions related to MCDA and Planning Department procedures. Please see accompanying story.- Set City's position related to items before the Legislature as follows: 1) City's crime prevention priorities, 2) City's opposition to proposed vacant building legislation, 3) City's support of proposed Historic Preservation Tax Increment Subdistrict legislation, 4) City's opposition to proposed legislation related to tobacco sales to minors that would reduce local efforts.3)    Supported a public/private partnership for development of YWCA and Urban Sports Center. - Approved appointments to the Minneapolis Advisory Committee on People with Disabilities, Citizens' Environmental Advisory Committee, and Minneapolis Television Network.- Approved demolition of nuisance structure at 1820 West Broadway.- Approved an option for the taxicab lottery process.- Authorized acceptance of funds from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Minneapolis Foundation for the Youth Homicide Forum.- Approved a memorandum of understanding regarding neighborhood commitments of NRP funds to support the demolition of boarded buildings and authorized agreements necessary to implement activities.- Authorized a cooperative agreement with the Park Board for design and construction of the Bassett Creek Trail Project.- Authorized City participation in pollution cleanup activities at the Schnitzer Iron and Metal site.- Approved submission of 12 applications seeking funding for park projects from the Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources.- Approved the following actions related to Victim/Witness and Domestic Abuse Advocacy services: 1) Issuance of an RFP for provision of victim/witness services in the City Attorney's office, 2) Establishment of a working group to develop an RFP for provision of domestic abuse advocacy services, 3) Authorization for the Domestic Abuse Project (DAP) to continue advocacy services until a permanent provider is selected, 4) Providing funding for interim DAP services.- Adopted the City's draft comments regarding the Draft Environmental Impact Statement on the Dual Track Airport Planning Process.- Endorsed the continuum of care planning effort recommended by the Task Force on Homeless Adults and Families.- Adopted modifications to the Camden Redevelopment Plan related to the Camden Medical Facility.<P>This is a partial list of City Council actions. For a full list, or for details on specific actions, call 673-3130.<P><HR><H3>Students Play Ball with Minneapolis PAL</H3>The Minneapolis Police Athletic League's first basketball season is off to a great start. The League has five girls' and eight boys' teams of Minneapolis students ages 7 to 14. The Minneapolis Police Department provides coaches and jerseys. Games are every Monday and Thursday at 2:30 p.m. at Folwell and Franklin Middle Schools. The Minneapolis PAL, which was formed six months ago, is part of a national organization of police officers working with youth and their communities. Its purpose is to promote respect through athletic and recreational activities. <P><HR><H3>Parks Accepting Reservations March 4</H3>It's not too early to start thinking about spring and picnicking in City parks. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board's Special Services Division will begin accepting reservations for outdoor picnic area covered shelters beginning March 4 in person and March 5 by phone. Permits can be obtained for facilities at Beard's Plaissance, Boom Island, Columbia, Minnehaha Falls, Mississippi River Flats, Theodore Wirth Picnic Area, and Wabun Park. To make a reservation, stop by the Park Board's permit office in the Minneapolis Grain Exchange Building, 400 South 4th Street, Suite 109, or call 661-4817.<P>State of the City 1995 Report Provides Statistical Portrait of MinneapolisWant to know how many single family homes there are in the City's Southwest community or what percentage of the City's population is between the ages of 25-44? You can find the answers to those questions and more in the newly released "State of the City 1995." The 186-page report published by the City's Planning Department provides a statistical portrait of Minneapolis. It contains useful information on population, housing, employment, transportation, education, and crime in the city. Pick up a copy of the report in Room 210 City Hall, 350 South Fifth Street.<P><HR><H3>Minneapolis To Hire Police Officers</H3>From February 26 to March 15 the City of Minneapolis will be accepting applications for approximately thirty Police Officer positions.    Requirements are Peace Officer Standard Training (P.O.S.T.) eligibility, good eyesight and hearing, ability to pass a medical/psychological exam and criminal background investigation prior to hire and eligibility for a MN driver's license.    City residency is required after probation.    Starting salary is $2323 per month.    For an application call Sharon Foster at 673-2281.<P>    <HR><H3>Get Ready for Kindergarten</H3>Early Childhood Screening, required of all Minnesota children before they can enter kindergarten, can be done long before a child reaches kindergarten age.    In fact, it can be scheduled anytime after age three-and-a-half. "Most parents wait to fulfill this requirement until the summer before their child is planning to enter kindergarten," says Betty Flanigan, Director of 348-TOTS, a program of the Minneapolis Department of Health and Family Support. "But we highly recommend scheduling an appointment earlier, because the sooner we do the screening, the sooner we can give parents the information they need to prepare their children to succeed in school."<P>Screening is free and takes only about 20 minutes.  In addition to a height, weight, vision, and hearing check, it includes a review of immunizations, a health and family questionnaire, and a developmental check. Screening takes place at a variety of convenient locations throughout the city, including parks, child-care programs, community centers, and the Public Health Center in downtown Minneapolis. Minneapolis parents may call 348-TOTS (8687) to schedule an appointment.<P>    <HR><H3>Health Services Will Continue</H3>The City of Minneapolis will close its three maternal and child health clinics at the end of February due to changes in the health care system and anticipated steep cuts in federal and state aid. Many services formerly provided by the Department of Health and Family Support will be provided by contractors.<P> "Some confusion surrounds the recent decision to transfer the provision of direct health-care services to contractors and to place greater emphasis on assessing community health needs and developing public policies to meet those needs," said Acting Health Commissioner Del Hurt. "The Minneapolis Department of Health and Family Support is not closing; nor is it abandoning the health needs of low-income women and children."<P>The Neighborhood Health Care Network, a network of community-based clinics, will provide most direct-care services.; the telephone number is 489-CARE. Contractors will also provide dental services for children (673-3020); prekindergarten and other childhood developmental screening services (348-TOTS); the WIC nutrition program for women, infants, and children (673-3500); health services in the school-based clinics; and visiting nurses.<P><HR><H3>Solutions for Winter Hazards</H3>With the winter weather providing snowy and icy conditions, roads take a beating. Potholes are created by water freezing and then thawing in cracks causing the road to expand. The Department of Public Works is repairing the roads, but the speed of the maintenance is determined by weather conditions. After being repaired, potholes can easily return due to the freeze/thaw factors and stress from traffic.<P>	The weather has also made walking on sidewalks difficult. Ice buildup coats many city sidewalks potentially increasing accidents. It is up to every property owner to remove ice and snow and to cover trouble spots with sand, which will make better traction for pedestrians. The City of Minneapolis provides free sand to residents. Locations: 1809 Washington St. NE, 121 Glenwood Av. N, 6036 Harriet Av. S., 4444 Snelling Av. S, and 2710 Pacific St.<P> <HR><H3>Open Appointments</H3>Positions are open on the following boards and commissions. Applicants must be residents of Minneapolis except under special conditions.

The free, self-guided event will feature more than 40 homes, including a house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, a floating bed and breakfast, and a geodesic dome, all of which will be open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, May 4, and from 1 to 5 p.m. Sunday, May 5. <P>New this year will be walking tours of three Minneapolis neighborhoods - Old Highland, Bancroft, and the Mississippi Mile, which includes Nicollet Island. In addition to historic homes, artists' lofts, and elegant condominiums, these tours will spotlight neighborhood landmarks and amenities.<P>"People love to go on the Home Tour to see how magnificent old homes have been restored and remodeled, but this year the event will include opportunities to see something besides beautiful woodwork and stained glass," says Leah Proctor, president of the Old Highland Association. "By organizing walking tours, we hope to help visitors get better acquainted with the community and what that community has to offer."<P>In Saint Paul, the annual Cinco de Mayo celebration will take place during the same weekend as the Home Tour, and organizers hope those attending one event will also attend the other.<P>The Home Tour is organized by the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul to build community awareness, encourage home improvement, and promote city living. Homes on the tour are typically not for sale. Estimated attendance last year was more than 40,000.<P>Copies of a 20-page Home Tour guide, containing descriptions and photos of all the homes, will appear in subscriber copies of the Pioneer Press on May 1 and the Star Tribune on May 2. The guide will also be available in Target Stores and metro area Norwest offices the week before the tour. <P><H4>Tour Volunteers Still Needed</H4> Volunteers are needed to help staff homes on the tour. Volunteer responsibilities include welcoming visitors, directing traffic through the homes, and answering questions about city living. It's an excellent way to make contacts and promote buying in the city. Three shifts are available: Saturday morning (9:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m.), Saturday afternoon (1-5:30 p.m.), and Sunday afternoon (12:30-5:30 p.m.).

McGruff Houses are safe places where children can go if they feel they are in danger on their way to and from school.<P>McGruff House participants no longer have to be at home all day long. The City changed the program's rules late last year allowing people to "generally" be home mornings or afternoons. The old rules required people to be home all morning and afternoon. <P>"The rule change opens it up to people who work part time," said John Baumann of the police department's Community Crime Prevention, which coordinates the McGruff House program. "We need more people to participate."<P>The program, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, has approximately 650 McGruff Houses throughout the City.<P>Prospective McGruff House participants must fill out an application; agree to a criminal history check for all household members age 14 and older; and provide references. A Minneapolis police officer will also do a surprise visit of the home. For more information on the McGruff House program, call Charlyn Cadwell at 673-2922.<HR><P><H3>Minneapolis Initiative Against Racism Receives National Award</H3>The Minneapolis Initiative Against Racism program has received a 1996 City Cultural Diversity Award from the National Black Caucus of Local Elected Officials. The city program was first runner up among cities with populations between 100,000 and 400,000.<P>Four first-place winners and four runners up received engraved silver awards at the "Celebrate Diversity" Breakfast March 10 during the National League of Cities Annual Congressional City Conference in Washington, D.C. Henry Cisneros, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, was the keynote speaker.<P>Cisneros spoke about the community's role in creating a sense of inclusiveness. "This sense of inclusiveness in communities is not going to happen because we run into each other at a cocktail party at the museum association," he said. "It will be when leaders like you formally, structurally, systematically think about inclusiveness as a major part of your job."<P>The MIAR was formed in 1992 to break the cycle of racial misunderstanding, prejudice and racism in order to provide equal economic and social access to people of all cultures and races in the community. Nine task forces consisting of representatives from both government and the community at large are working to eliminate racism in housing, education, media, government, employment, civic groups and arts, human services and religious institutions and among youth. The MIAR Awards were created in 1995 to honor individuals and organizations who have made strides in the fight against racism.<P>More than 21 percent of Minneapolis' population are people of color, according to the 1990 census. "We want to make it known that Minneapolis is a city that respects its diversity and encourages those who do not to think and act differently," said past MIAR co-director Tara Buckner.  <P>The NBC-LEO's City Cultural Diversity Awards are designed to promote the concept of cultural diversity in local governance through citizen and community participation. Rochester, New York took top honors in the 100,000 to 400,000 population category. Other top winners were Columbus, Ohio (over 400,000); Richmond, California (25,000 to 100,000); and Natchez, Mississippi (Under 25,000). Runners up were Casa Grande Arizona (Under 25,000); Roswell, New Mexico (25,000 to 100,000); and Boston, Massachusetts (Over 400,000).<HR><P><B><H3>City of Minneapolis News Briefs</H3>Council Honors North High Team</B>The City Council honored the North High School boys basketball team March 29 for winning the 1996 Class AA championship in the Boys State Basketball Tournament. The Polars are the 13th team to win back-to-back titles in the tournament's 87-year history.<P><B>Council Approves Speed Humps</B>At the March 29 meeting, the City Council approved a procedure for speed humps in alleys to slow down drivers. A test of the recycled plastic speed humps in about a dozen alleys last year was successful. Under the proposed program, at least 75 percent of property owners on a block must petition the city to install the speed humps. The block must pay for the installation, estimated to cost $520 for a three-hump alley, and agree to remove them between Nov. 1 and April 1 to accommodate snow plowing. Contact Rick Dahl, 673-2411 <P><B>Neighbors Celebrate Phelps Park Center</B>On March 30, Bancroft, Bryant, Powderhorn Park and Central neighborhood residents marked the ground breaking of the new Phelps Park Community Center, Chicago Av. at 39th St., with a "Wonder Web Celebration." Participants brought "wondrous" objects that were be woven into a web of wire and rope with the help of community artists. The web will be displayed in the new community center. Construction in Phelps Park includes a new gym and a renovated community center. When the center reopens in September 1996, it will be the permanent site for the Southside Boys & Girls Club. Bryant, Bancroft, and Powderhorn neighborhoods used $750,000 of their NRP funds for the park project. <P><B>City to Provide Lead-Safe House</B>Beginning April 1, Minneapolis residents have a safe place to stay while their own homes are undergoing lead hazard reduction. The City of Minneapolis has contracted with the Phillips Lead Project to provide a lead-safe house in the neighborhood. A $25,000 State Health Department grant awarded to the Minneapolis Lead Poisoning Intervention Program earlier this month will pay for furnishings and rental of the property through September 1997. The maximum stay at the safe house is two weeks. <HR><H3>Open Appointments</H3>Application materials are available from the Office of the City Clerk, 350 South 5th Street, 304 City Hall, Minneapolis, MN 55415-1382; telephone 673-2735.

I am outraged.<P>"This investment in the state economy was supported by business, supported by labor, supported by people in Greater Minnesota who want market outlets, by people in the Twin Cities who want jobs; it was supported by both houses of the legislature, and both sides of the aisle.<P>"But Governor Carlson said no. He said "no" to $100 million in new money coming into Minnesota every year - $100 million that would have reduced the taxes of all Minnesotans. He said "no" to 5,000 businesses across the state that need visibility and expanded markets. He said "no" to 4,000 people in Minneapolis, St. Paul and the metro area who want to go to work for good wages and benefits.<P>"Governor Carlson selected the only part of the bonding bill that could generate substantial revenue for the State of Minnesota, and singled it out for a veto. That doesn't make sense.<P>"The Governor knows that last year, because of lack of room, the Minneapolis Convention Center had to turn away: 12 thousand National Education Association delegates, 12 thousand International Dairy Foods Association delegates, 16 thousand National Urban League Delegates....and thousands of others - in fact, a total of 195 thousand visitors who would have enriched our state by $150 million dollars. <P>"The Governor's logic in permitting this situation to continue escapes me. "Governor Carlson says the reason for his veto is that Minneapolis doesn't have a financial plan to finish the convention center. However, he has refused to assign anyone in his administration to work with us on the parameters of a plan that would be acceptable to him. The Governor knows that Minneapolis, almost single handedly, has created a global marketplace for the whole state by building the Convention Center. He knows that the total cost of the Convention Center is $520 million - and that already the City has picked up the tab for the first $350 million.<P> "Now that it's time to finish the project, Minneapolis wants the Governor and the State of Minnesota to be our partner. The Convention Center is a state resource and a state project. It was the only bonding bill project that would have benefited everybody in the state. "The Convention Center makes sense. The Governor's veto does not."<P>Minneapolis City officials maintain that although they attempted to work with the Carlson Administration to complete a finance plan, no one within the Administration was formally assigned to work with them on the parameters of an acceptable plan.<P>During the Legislative session, the City proposed to legislators and to the Carlson Administration a proposal for amortizing the $160 million Convention Center project. Members of the Carlson Administration did caution the City that the proposal would still require the state to use its own bonding capacity. The City took this constraint quite seriously, and commissioned an outside consultant, Evenson Dodge, to provide options that might mitigate this burden. That report is due in early May. <P>The City has always assumed that the Governor would not authorize the issuance of any bond proceeds to the Convention Center project until he was satisfied that there was available a suitable long-term financing plan. In fact, the language of the bill designates the $12 million only after this condition is satisfied.<P> The veto means that for another year the City cannot negotiate for the needed land, cannot move forward on a financing plan, or tell prospective conventions that Minneapolis might be able to accommodate their needs after the year 2001.<P>The Mayor said, however, that although this is a setback, the City will continue to pursue the completion of the Convention Center with our business and labor partners throughout the State of Minnesota.<P><HR> <H3>May 4 & 5 Home Tour Adds Focus on Neighborhoods for First Year</H3> <P>This year, visitors to the Minneapolis & Saint Paul Home Tour will be able to explore entire neighborhoods as well as fine homes. For the first time, the Home Tour has partnered with neighborhoods to organize three neighborhood tours. Visitors will be able to see several of the neighborhoods' most distinct homes as well as enjoy guided tours and entertainment, learn the history of the neighborhood and meet neighbors.<P>The neighborhood tours occur during the same hours of the Home Tour: on Saturday, May 4, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on Sunday, May 5, from 1 to 5 p.m. Like the Home Tour, neighborhood tours are free of charge.<P>In North Minneapolis' Old Highland neighborhood, four homes will be open. In addition, the neighborhood is hosting local bands and an information fair. Pick up information at 1604 Emerson Av. N.<P>Along the Mississippi Mile, the city's newest, oldest neighborhood will feature guided walking tours of four historic areas, and a glimpse of new and restored condos; artists' lofts and studios; as well as information about the history and future of the area. Visitors can also pick up a flyer and explore the riverfront on their own. Pick up information or sign up for a guided tour at De La Salle High School on Nicollet Island.<P>A "classic" south Minneapolis neighborhood, Bancroft is highlighting its latest developments with a look at the Phelps Park project, which is currently under construction. Visitors will also be able to tour several of the neighborhood's homes and businesses. Start your tour at 3945 Chicago Av.

There are no Kondirators in North America, but construction of one has been proposed along the Mississippi River in North Minneapolis, an area that Biernat represents. Biernat is paying the cost of his own transportation for the trip.<P> Biernat and Frame will meet with local government officials, residents who live near the Kondirators, managers of the facilities, and environmental organizations. Staff from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency have accepted an invitation from the City to attend these meetings. Biernat and Frame also will collect videotape, slides and samples.<P> After their return, Biernat and Frame will present the results of their inspections to the City Council and neighborhood organizations at a series of meetings. They will also present their information at a meeting of the MPCA Citizens Board. The Board will determine the adequacy of an Environmental Assessment Worksheet for the project in the next few months. <P>Last December, Biernat saw a metal shredder in Phoenix. "It was tremendously valuable to talk with neighborhood residents and workers in the plant," he said.<P> "The Kondirator is one of the most important issues facing the residents of North and Northeast Minneapolis, but no one from the City or the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has actually seen one," Biernat said. "I believe that it is essential to see these operations firsthand and then share the information with my constituents."<P><HR><H3>Participants Needed for McGruff</H3>The City of Minneapolis is looking for residents who are willing to open up their homes in the McGruff House program.

The City changed the program's rules late last year allowing people to "generally" be home mornings or afternoons. The old rules required people to be home all morning and afternoon.<P> "The rule change opens it up to people who work part time," said John Baumann of the Police Department's Community Crime Prevention, which coordinates the McGruff House program. "We need more people to participate."<P>The program, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, has approximately 650 McGruff Houses throughout the city.<P>Prospective McGruff House participants must fill out an application; agree to a criminal history check for all household members age 14 and older; and provide references.

Olson announced Safe Summer - a package of police, community and youth initiatives to improve the quality of life in Minneapolis neighborhoods and to provide youth with positive summertime opportunities - at a May 31 news conference.<P>- The Chief's Summer Beat will put almost 200 sworn officers who do not usually work in the community on the streets for one or two days a month throughout June, July and August. This means as many as 26 more officers a day will be working in neighborhood "hot spots." The program will involve officers of all ranks, including the Chief.<P>- Seventeen additional "Clinton Cops" will begin community policing assignments in neighborhoods starting June 16, along with 30 other new recruits. These new officers will raise the authorized strength of the Minneapolis Police Department to 886. In addition, 23 more "Clinton Cops" are being recruited for the October 1996 Recruit Academy.<P>- The Police Athletic League (P.A.L.) Rookie League, sponsored by the Minnesota Twins, will begin June 11. The League will offer Minneapolis youth between the ages of seven and 14 both recreation and a chance to develop a positive relationship with a Minneapolis Police Officer. Hundreds of youth are expected to participate.<P>- "What's Up?" Youth Hotline, operated by the Youth Coordinating Board, will provide Minneapolis youth information on hundreds of athletic, recreational, enrichment and employment opportunities. The hotline will be available starting June 18. In announcing Safe Summer, the Mayor recalled last year's record homicide rate. "The memory of the pain and violence of last year is still fresh in our minds. We must not, and will not, relive those tragic days. If any good can come of them, it must be a resolve on the part of all of us - police, clergy, business people, youth workers, neighbors, parents and young people - that this year will be different. This year we will work as one to do whatever is necessary to bring peace to our homes, peace to our neighborhoods, and peace to our city."<P>"Government can provide tools, but it takes citizens to put them to work," the Mayor said. "The City can put that new cop on the beat, but the way that officer is going to be successful is for the people in the neighborhood make the effort to meet that officer, and make a partnership with him or her to work together to prevent crime in the community."<P> Chief Olson stressed the need for community involvement. "Gangs, violence and youth crime are a reality in America's major cities and Minneapolis is no exception. Even with the very successful programs initiated over the years, we can never let down our guard. Only through the strong cooperation of the citizens, the police and government will we ever be able to make a difference in protecting the quality of life for our residents. These new initiatives are also designed to address the root issues that feed the fires of disorder and youth and gang violence."<P>The Mayor said Safe Summer builds on successes of the past two years. "Last year we experimented with Operation Safe Streets - police saturation of targeted neighborhoods. It worked. It provided relief to those neighborhoods. This summer we intensify that effort with more police, in more neighborhoods, working with more people in the community to prevent crime."<P><I>Video of this news conference will be shown on City Cable 34 starting June 7. It will follow live coverage and tape repeats of City Council meeting.</I><P><HR><H3>May 24 Minneapolis City Council Actions</H3>At its May 24 meeting the Minneapolis City Council took the following actions.<P><B>Appointments</B><P>The Council approved appointments to the Minneapolis-St. Paul Strategic Investment for Living Wage Jobs Task Force: Alexa Bradley (MAPA), Thomas Burke (Norwest Bank), and Evelyn Miks (AFSCME). <P><B>Community Development Committee</B><P>- Approved revenue bonds for Minneapolis Career Center, Inc to acquire and renovate former Sears warehouse at 2929 Elliot Av S.<P>- Approved Neighborhood Revitalization Program plans and funds:<P><LI>Northeast Park Neighborhood, $510,000 for Action Plan activities which include a home improvement matching grant program, traffic calming measures, and improvements to Northeast Park.<LI>Audubon Park Neighborhood, $2,798,845 for Action Plan activities which include low interest housing loans, rehabilitation of distressed properties, tree planting, improvement of Central Avenue and Johnson Street commercial areas and revitalization of the Hollywood Theater.<LI>Harrison Neighborhood, $450,000 for First Step Plan activities which include rehabilitation of blighted housing, a tool lending library, a master plan for Glenwood Avenue, block club organization and provision of security lights.<LI>Waite Park Neighborhood, $250,000 for First Step Plan activities which include an interest rate buy-down program to encourage housing rehab and development of a restorative justice program.<LI>Holland Neighborhood, $10,000 of early access funds for a inter-neighborhood Central Avenue Corridor Study<LI>Waite Park Neighborhood, $190,250 of early access funds to upgrade Waite Park Elementary School for its transition from grades 4-6 to K-6 and to enhance REC Plus latchkey program.<P>- Approved Preliminary Planning Fund allocations for Southeast Minneapolis Industrial Area (SEMI) project, 7th Street Business Center, and the Lyndale Gateway project.<P>- Authorized MCDA to negotiate with FORECAST Public Artworks for arts programs and entertainment events on Block E as an interim use.<P><B>Public Safety & Regulatory Services</B><P>- Authorized demolition of nuisance buildings at 617 26th Av N and 617 Lowry Av N.<P>- Approved architectural and engineering services proposal by Julie Snow Architects, Inc. for new Fifth Precinct Police Station.<P><B>Transportation & Public Works</B><P>- Passed an ordinance related to illegal dumping.<P>- Authorized RFP for engineering services related to parking issues in the Lowry Hill neighborhood; the study is in conjunction with the neighborhood's NRP plan.<P>- Directed that a report of an interdepartmental  Transit and Transportation Work Team be submitted to the Transportation & Public Works and Intergovernmental Relations committees not later than the first cycle of November in order to have a plan to propose to the 1997 Legislature.<P>- Accepted a proposal for architectural and engineering services submitted by Luken Architecture PA for the Fire Training Simulator project.<P><B>Ways & Means/Budget</B><P>- Approved the following organizations to participate in the City's 1996 Charitable Campaign: Cooperating Fund Drive, The Health Fund of Minnesota, Open Your Heart to the Hungry and Homeless, The College Fund/UNCF, United Arts, Minnesota Environment Fund, and United Way of Minneapolis Area.<P><B>Taxes</B><P>- Approved 1996 assessment rolls and received report of the Board of Equalization.

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>On The Agenda -- 07/03/96</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H1>ON THE AGENDA</H1><H2>City of Minneapolis Actions & Issues -- July 3, 1996</H2><I>On The Agenda provides information on issues, programs and actions ofthe City of Minneapolis. Editor: Bill Carter, 673-2009. FAX: 673-3250. Forsign language interpreting call TTY 673-2626. Please send address correctionsto 323M City Hall, 55415 or fax to 673-2011. On The Agenda and other Citydocuments are available in alternative formats; call 673-2009. <BR><BR>This is Issue 19, Volume 12. The next issue of On the Agenda will be July19. </I><BR><BR><HR><H3>Get ready for <A HREF="/departments/police/nno/index.html">NationalNight Out</A>, Tuesday, August 6. <BR></H3><HR><H3>City Launches the &quot;What's Up&quot; Youth Information Line</H3>It's summer, finally. For grade school and high school students that meansgetting away from the ritual of attending classes, studying, and going toschool sporting events and other extracurricular activities. It also mightmean some serious down time with nothing to do. <BR><BR>Youth now have a new way to find out what to do in Minneapolis by simplypicking up the phone and calling <I>What's Up?</I> (399-9999), a new youthinformation line developed by the Minneapolis Youth Coordinating Board.<BR><BR><I>What's Up?</I> is the Twin Cities' first phone line that directly connectsyoung people to Minneapolis youth programs and activities. A recent study,conducted by the Search Institute for the Youth Coordinating Board, foundthat half of Minneapolis' young people ages 7 to 14 are not involved inconstructive youth development activities. One of the main reasons, accordingto the <I>Places to Grow</I> study, is lack of knowledge about availableprograms. Students interviewed for the study reported, however, that &quot;ifthere was a phone number to call that told us what's going on, we'd useit.&quot; And so the Minneapolis Youth Coordinating Board developed <I>What'sUp?</I> <BR><BR>The information line, staffed entirely by Minneapolis youth, operates from2  p.m. to 8  p.m., Monday through Friday, and from noon to 5  p.m., Saturdayand Sunday. <BR><BR>Here's how <I>What's Up?</I> works: youth call in and make initial contactwith peer operators, who can link callers to Minneapolis athletic activities,civic groups, community education classes, youth crisis counselors, jobopportunities, mentoring programs, park and recreation events, and weeklyentertainment stored in a database. Through a specially-designed geographiclocator computer program, engineered by the City's Engineering and Designdivision, operators can advise callers on the nearest place to participatein these programs and activities, and then actually connect their call toprogram organizers. <BR><BR>&quot;The Minneapolis Youth Coordinating Board has established a goal thatby the year 2000, 80 percent of Minneapolis young people ages 7 to 14 willbe involved in at least one youth development activity,&quot; the board'sExecutive Director, Colleen Moriarty said. &quot;<I>What's Up?</I> is acritical tool to help us meet that goal.&quot; <BR><BR><I>What's Up?</I> is made possible from sponsorship and donations from BrookfieldLePage, City of Minneapolis, Crisis Connection, Hennepin County, Karwoski& Courage Public Relations, McKnight Foundation, Minneapolis Employmentand Training, Minneapolis Department of Neighborhood Services, MinneapolisPark and Recreation, Minneapolis Public Library, Minneapolis Public Schools,Paragon Cable, Quik Print, Stay Alive Project, Transtop, Twin Cities One-to-Oneand Youth Trust. <BR><BR>Call Annie Nelson, 673-2060, for more information on <I>What's Up?</I> orthe Minneapolis Youth Coordinating Board. <BR><BR><HR><H3>Graffiti Increasing -- Brochure and Presentations Available </H3>As graffiti becomes a more common sight in Minneapolis, residents and businessowners need to know what they can do to stop it. <BR><BR>The Inspections Division and Police Department's Community Crime Prevention/SAFEUnit have produced a brochure entitled &quot;What You Can Do About Graffiti,&quot;that has free information on prevention, removal tips, removal productsand resources. <BR><BR>The city's graffiti problem is rapidly increasing, according to Jose Cervantesof the Minneapolis Department of Inspections. The Housing Section has issuedmore than 1,800 violation notices for graffiti this year as of June 5. Thatfigure is expected to rise to more than 2,500 by the end of the year, Cervantessaid. About 75 percent of the graffiti in the city is done by taggers, whoput their scrawls on as many buildings and street fixtures as possible togain recognition or fame. The rest is done by gang members who use graffitito mark their turf or send messages to rivals. <BR><BR>The City has taken a tough stance against graffiti in the past year withadditional laws, aggressive enforcement and education programs. <BR><BR>&quot;Community involvement is essential to reducing our graffiti problem,&quot;Cervantes said. &quot;This new brochure provides information to help peopleget involved. By following these tips, people can help keep graffiti fromtaking hold in their neighborhood.&quot; <BR><BR>Some important tips from the brochure are: <UL>  <LI>Report graffiti. Call 911 if you see graffiti being done or Teleserveat 348-9392 if you are a victim of graffiti.   <LI>Remove graffiti as soon as possible. Left alone, graffiti attractsgraffiti.   <LI>For removal assistance, call the Graffiti Hotline at 673-2090. TheCity offers free graffiti removal and paint-over services for residentsand businesses. Graffiti removal on other types of property is done by theowner. For example, graffiti on phone booths is removed by US West.   <LI>If you are removing graffiti yourself, you can pick up a free productat Minneapolis fire stations or purchase it at hardware, paint or auto stores.</UL>The Inspections Division will do free presentations on graffiti preventionand removal to block clubs, schools and businesses. CCP/SAFE can also provideinformation on controlling graffiti. Call 673-3015  to request a brochure.<BR><BR><HR><H3>City of Minneapolis News Briefs </H3><B>Employee's Invention Saves Money</B>  Minneapolis employee Charlie Runninghas invented a device that will simplify encasing electrical conduits inconcrete for traffic signals and street lights. The invention will savethe City thousands of dollars in labor and equipment rental each year. Thedevice, called The Running Connector, features a thin metal pipe glued toa PVC conduit tube. It easily attaches to existing pipe buried beneath thestreet without jack hammering through layers of concrete. More informationfrom Charlie Running, Public Works, 673-5750. <BR><BR><A NAME="anchor229796"></A><B>City to Add On-Street Bicycle Lanes</B>  Tomake city streets more bicycle friendly, Minneapolis has added seven newbicycle lanes. The lanes are on Park and Portland Avs. between 28th St.and Minnehaha Parkway; 10th and 11th Sts between Glenwood and Hennepin Avs.;E. 24th St. from Hennepin to 3rd Av.; Hennepin Av. from 10th to 11th St.and the Hennepin Bridge to Washington Av.; and Glenwood Av. from 12th to10th St. More information from Rhonda Rae, Public Works, 673-3439. <BR><BR><B>City Donates Computers</B>  Old computers will get new life at localsocial service agencies. The City recently donated almost 200 used computers,printers and other hardware to Sabathani Community Center's Horizons YouthProgram, Project for Pride in Living's Surplus Home & Office Products programand Oak Park Heights prison. At Sabathani, 35 computers will be used inan academic support program for students and given to youth who improveacademically.

The campaign, supported by the Mayorand Minneapolis City Council, is aimed at reducing the number of animalspermanently lost, impounded, or destroyed each year when their owners can'tbe found. Cat and dog licensing is required by ordinance in Minneapolis,but many owners don't realize licensing can better ensure their animal issafely returned home if it is lost or stolen. <BR><BR>&quot;We want to reduce the number of animals who are impounded or mustbe destroyed because there's no way to identify them,&quot; says LeslieYoder, Animal Control Manager. &quot;The benefits of pet licensing are wellworth the small cost. If your animal is ever lost or strays, it can be easilyidentified and returned home. You also avoid the impound fee to recoveryour animal from the shelter.&quot; Yoder says the public benefits becauselicensing requires cats and dogs to have current rabies vaccinations andmakes it easier to track an animal if it has bitten someone. <BR><BR>Animal Control staff will be carrying their licensing campaign into thecommunity to neighborhood events, libraries, pet stores, veterinary officesand precinct stations, to educate owners about benefits of licensing, andprovide licensing opportunities. &quot;There's nothing worse for a cat ordog owner than losing their animal,&quot; says Yoder, &quot;and nothingmakes us happier than to return a pet to its owner. If the campaign savesanimals, it's well worth the effort.&quot; <BR><BR><I>Minneapolis City Code currently requires licensing for cats and dogsmore than four months old. Pets which are spayed, neutered or less thaneight months old can be licensed for $10; others are $15. For additionalinformation on pet licensing, call Animal Control at 348-4250, or City Licensingat 673-2050. </I><HR><H2>Police Athletic League Will Sponsor Flag Football League </H2>The Minneapolis Police Athletic League (P.A.L.) will sponsor a flag footballleague for 5th and 6th grade boys and girls this fall.

The City of Minneapolis is an Equal Opportunity - AffirmativeAction Employer.</I><HR><H2>Mayor Proposes Zero-Tolerance for Crime, Zero Increase in Tax Rates</H2>Zero-tolerance for crime is Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton's top 1997 budgetpriority. On August 6, she outlined a &quot;smart, tough&quot; crime-fightingprogram in her 1997 Budget Framework Address. <BR><BR>The Mayor presented her &quot;Framework for a Safe City&quot; message toan audience of city officials and community leaders. The speech launchesthe budget-preparation season by giving department heads a policy frameworkfor proposing their respective budgets. The Mayor makes her final budgetrecommendations to the City Council in November.<BR><BR>The City would use saturation police patrols in neighborhoods and aroundschools and parks to enforce zero-tolerance for misdemeanors which she saidwere &quot;gateways to crime.&quot; She said the program calls for the CityAttorney to more aggressively prosecute misdemeanors, and that she has askedthe Hennepin County District Court to &quot;put the full muscle of the criminaljustice system behind the good work of the Minneapolis Police Department.&quot;<BR><BR>The Mayor said the Minneapolis Board of Education has responded to her calllast year to begin and end the school day later so that children would beoff the streets during peak crime hours. <BR><BR>&quot;I am happy to announce, together with School Board Chair Bill Greenand Superintendent Peter Hutchinson, that the Minneapolis Board of Educationhas voted to work with the community to develop by December a recommendationto change start times beginning in 1997.&quot; She outlined an intensiveprogram of cooperation between the schools and the City, including police-protectedsafe routes for children who walk to school. <BR><BR>The program &quot;enforces a policy of zero-tolerance for crime, zero-tolerancefor drugs, zero-tolerance for prostitution, zero-tolerance for guns, andzero-tolerance for gangs.&quot;<BR><BR>She said the City must assist the Park Police with park security, and encouragedthe Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board to proceed with its proposed RecExtraprogram, which will offer activities for families and children on summerweekends, starting in 1997. She said it was crucial to introduce the programin &quot;neighborhoods where we must take back the parks for the familiesand children of Minneapolis.&quot;<BR><BR>Pointing out that last year her 1996 budget raised the authorized policestrength to an all-time high, she said that simply assigning more policeofficers to the streets is not enough. &quot;We must fight crime the sameway a general fights a war: by holding our ground, preventing all incursions,and denying the enemy a foothold. We must stop criminals at the very gatewayto crime. Low-level, or gateway crimes, destroy our sense of safety, ourtrust in each other, and create an environment for more serious crime.&quot;<BR><BR>Although the Mayor asked for plans for a number of new initiatives, shesaid they could not lead to any increased cost to taxpayers. In fact, shesaid, department heads would have to cut total expenditures by $2 million.&quot;I am absolutely committed to avoiding an increase in the tax rate.&quot;<BR><BR>Other initiatives include:<BR>- Doing a better - and cheaper - job of neighborhood cleanups by coordinatingsanitation and street sweeping efforts. She said pilot projects were beingplanned for Central neighborhood in August, and Phillips in October.<BR>- Using untapped resources to help the city meet peak seasonal needs, suchas writing tickets during snow emergencies, cutting down weeds and removingrubbish. Resources include workers on light duty, summer youth workers.She said workers could be cross-trained and work year-round, instead ofbeing hired for summer work and laid off in the winter when they receiveunemployment and on-call bonuses. She stressed the need to work cooperativelywith organized labor to accomplish these goals.<BR>- Shifting the emphasis of School-Based Health Clinics to prevention inorder to improve student performance. <BR>- Investing in a program to reduce the &quot;slow leak&quot; of losses fromclaims and lawsuits, saving the City $200,000 in the first year and $500,000annually thereafter.<BR>- A preliminary plan for improvements needed in the City water system. <BR>- An Office of Citizen Services, a one-stop shop for citizens to obtaininformation and referrals, and an interdepartmental Task Force for Childrenand Families. <BR><BR><I>City Cable 34 will air videotape of the Mayor's address after taped repeatsof City Council meetings through September 11. Rebroadcasts of Council meetingsair Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 6 p.m. The full text of the addressis on the Internet - the City's home page address is http://www.ci.mpls.mn.us.Printed copies can be obtained from the Mayor's Office, 673-2100.</I><HR><H2>Town Meeting Set for September 19 </H2>Minneapolis city government will move from downtown to the neighborhoodson the evening of Thursday, Sept. 19. <BR><BR>The Minneapolis City Council and Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton will hold aMinneapolis Town Meeting at which citizens can obtain information aboutcity services and express their views on how city government is meetingits goals.<BR><BR>&quot;The Town Meeting is a unique chance for elected officials to hearfrom citizens about how we are doing in meeting our goals for Minneapolis,&quot;said City Council President Jackie Cherryhomes. &quot;We want to make iteasy and convenient for citizens to talk with us so we're getting out ofCity Hall and into a neighborhood.&quot;<BR><BR>The Open House featuring city departments will start at 6 p.m. Thursday,Sept. 19, and the Town Meeting will begin at 7 p.m. The event will be inthe Northeast Armory, 1025 Broadway Street NE, which is one block east ofCentral Avenue.<BR><BR>At the Open House, citizens will be able to pick up information and gettheir questions answered on a wide range of city services.

Editor: Bill Carter, 673-2009. FAX: 673-3250. Thisis Issue 23, Volume 12. Next issue will be September 20. Please send addresscorrections to 323M City Hall, 55415 or fax to 673-2011. ON THE AGENDA andother City documents are available in alternative formats, call 673-2009.The City provides sign language interpreting for City programs and services,call TTY 673-2626. The City of Minneapolis is an Equal Opportunity &shyp;Affirmative Action Employer.</I><HR> <H2>Police and Fire Recognized for Hiring of Protected Class Members</H2>Both the Minneapolis Police and Fire Departments have achieved high levelsof diversity through cadet programs. <BR><BR>The Police Department has been selected by the Minnesota State Legislatureto receive $85,000 in Educational Opportunities Program funds, allocatedto police agencies that take an aggressive recruitment and hiring approachwith protected class members. The department's Cadet Program met requirementsset by the Legislature and has been responsible for more than 88 percentof department minority and protected class hiring over the past six years.<BR><BR>Deputy Chief of Police Richard Schultz appeared before the August 14 meetingof the City Council's Public Safety &amp; Regulatory Services committeewith a formal request to accept the state funding.<BR><BR>At the same meeting, Assistant Fire Chief Rocco Forte provided data showingthat the department has surpassed goals for minority personnel imposed bya class action law suit against the City. The experimental Firefighter CadetProgram recently graduated the most diverse, best-trained firefighters inthe history of the department, debunking myths that achieving diversitymeans sacrificing quality. The 18 cadets are the first Minneapolis Firefighterstrained at Hennepin Technical College and first to complete Emergency MedicalTechnician and Hazardous Materials training before joining the department.<BR><BR>While the total number of Fire Department personnel decreased from 1981to 1996, the number of protected class employees increased from 43 to 133out of a current total of 441 employees. &quot;We're not underutilized inany male category,&quot; said Forte, &quot;and, in comparison to 12 othermajor metropolitan fire departments, we employ the largest percentage offemale firefighters - 9.5 percent.&quot; (Seattle is the closest competitorwith 8.2 percent; New York City's female firefighters compose 0.32 percentof the total force.) <BR><BR>Measured alone, protected class members hold 42 percent of all Firefighterpositions in Minneapolis. Forte said percentages for protected class Firefighterswould be even higher, but a record number of persons of protected classwere promoted in 1995 and 1996 from Firefighter to other positions in thedepartment.<HR> <H2>Consolidated Plan Meeting Set</H2>The City of Minneapolis will conduct a public meeting on the City's FY97Consolidated Plan on Wednesday September 18, beginning at 5 p.m. at theMCDA offices on the second floor of Crown Roller Mill,105 Fifth Avenue South.<BR><BR>Staff of the City of Minneapolis, the Minneapolis Community DevelopmentAgency (MCDA), and the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority (MPHA) inviteyou to participate in the development of the City's FY97 Consolidated Planfor Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment PartnershipsProgram (HOME), Emergency Shelter Grants Program (ESGP), and the HousingOpportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) federal entitlement funding.<BR><BR>The FY97 Consolidated Year is June 1, 1997 through May 31, 1998. Citizenscan participate by attending the meeting, by speaking at the meeting, and/orsubmitting written comments before, during, or after the meeting. If youare unable to attend this public meeting, you can send comments and relevantdata such as articles, reports, studies or surveys you feel should be consideredduring the development of the City's FY97 Consolidated Plan to the MinneapolisOffice of Grants &amp; Special Projects, 200 City Hall, 350 South FifthSt., 55415. If you have any questions, call Ken Brunsvold at 673-2348.<BR><BR>The FY95 and FY96 Consolidated Plans are available for review at the Grants&amp; Special Projects Office (200 City Hall), Municipal Information Library(300 City Hall), MCDA (700 Ceresota Mill), and Public Libraries. Copiesof FY95 plan (370 pages) or FY96 plan (207 pages) are available for purchaseat printing and mailing costs &shyp; pick up at Room 200 City Hall for $10or mailed first class for $15.

<H2>Lakes to Get Alum Dose </H2>
The cloudy waters of Cedar Lake and Lake of the Isles will dramatically
clear this fall and should remain that way for years to come following treatment
with a chemical that controls algae. The treatment in mid-October with aluminum
sulfate, commonly called alum, will help control algae by reducing the amount
of phosphorus in the water. The treatment is expected to take a week to
10 days. <BR>
<BR>
Alum is commonly used in water treatment plants and has been used around
the country in more than 100 lake restoration projects. The alum treatment
will help control internal phosphorus for 10 to 15 years. The treatment
is harmless to aquatic creatures, plants, and people. <BR>
<BR>
Once phosphorus controls are completed at Lake Calhoun, it also will undergo
an alum treatment. The Calhoun treatment is scheduled for 1998. <BR>

<H1>ON THE AGENDA</H1>
<H2>City of Minneapolis Actions &amp; Issues - November 1, 1996</H2>
<BR>
<I>ON THE AGENDA provides information on issues, programs and actions of
the City of Minneapolis. Editor: Bill Carter, 673-2009. FAX: 673-3250. This
is Issue 3, Volume 13. Next issue will be November 15. ON THE AGENDA and
other City documents are available in alternative formats, call 673-2009.

Action Employer.</I><HR> 
<H2>Budget Address This Week</H2>
Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton will deliver her 1997 Budget Address at 2 p.m.
Thursday, November 7, in the City Council Chambers. Her address will focus
on public safety issues. The public is welcome to attend.<HR> 
<H2>City Gets Lead Control Grant</H2>
<BR>
A $5 million federal grant will allow Minneapolis to step up its lead-control
education program and replace or seal contaminated window frames to prevent
further lead poisoning in hundreds of city residences.<BR>
<BR>
More than 80 percent of the City's 177,000 housing units contain some lead-based
paint. Over the past five years, an average of 350 children annually have
undergone treatment for lead poisoning after blood tests indicated that
the metal had reached dangerous levels.<BR>
<BR>
Lead poisoning cases tend to be associated with older housing, where lead-based
paint was once used extensively. The City program, dubbed The 10,000 Windows
Project, will reduce lead exposure by replacing or sealing up to 10,000
sashes, jambs and other parts of contaminated windows.<BR>
<BR>
Part of the money also will be used to develop a system to track and manage
lead poisoning cases. Under the grant, financing will be made available
to help property owners in making what are often costly corrections. The
City anticipates that up to 200 residential properties will undergo extensive
lead reduction over the next two years.<HR> 
<H2>Open Appointments</H2>
<BR>
One position is vacant on the Minneapolis Advisory Committee on People With
Disabilities. Call Amy Stegora-Peterson at 673-2735 (TTY 673-3360) for information.

<BR>
Two positions are vacant on the Real Estate Advisory Board. More information
from Bill Carter, 673-2009. Deadline is November 22.<BR>

the commission are to foster development of the arts, seek financial support
for the arts, advise the City Council with respect to arts-related matters,
and stimulate participation in and appreciation of the arts by all city
residents. For information call David Hanson, 673-3006. Deadline is December

<H2>Remembering Timothy Wegener</H2>
<BR>
Timothy Wegener, 38, loved being a carpenter. He was a member of the Brotherhood
of Carpenters Local 851 in Anoka. As a temporary employee of the City of
Minneapolis, Wegener was responsible for skilled carpentry work, a job in
which he took great pride. <BR>
<BR>
Sadly, on October 10, Wegener's life was cut short when a hydraulic lift
he was operating was struck by a train northwest of Cedar Lake. Wegener
was removing concrete forms from the Cedar Lake Parkway bridge when this
tragic incident occurred. He was the first City employee killed on the job
since Police Officer Jerry Haaf was killed in the line of duty in 1992.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Tim was an employee who impressed me, and I don't impress very easily,&quot;
said Rich Profaizer, the Bridge Maintenance Engineer who supervised Wegener.<BR>
<BR>
The Federal Railroad Administration is investigating the incident. It appears
that there was a communications breakdown. Under normal circumstances, a
rail dispatcher notifies any crews on the tracks several minutes before
a train arrives. However, Wegener's crew claims to have never received the
dispatch.<BR>
<BR>
Wegener moved to Brooklyn Center from Colorado about two years ago, and
is survived by his wife, Cindy, and four sons.<HR>

<H2>Correction</H2>
The November 15 transmission of this issue of On The Agenda incorrectly
reported the November 8 City Council action concurring with the Mayors recommendation
to reappoint or appoint persons to the Minneapolis Commission on Civil Rights.
Lisa Albrecht, James F. Cannon, Robert B. Fine, Anne LaLonde Laux and Ophelia
Balcos were reappointed to the commission. Dianne G. Marsh and Ron Elwood
(not Ron Edwards as reported) are new appointees. <BR>

<H2>Mayor Sayles Belton Unveils 1997 Budget, Focus Is On Public Safety and
Infrastructure; Public Hearing Set for December 4</H2>
<BR>
On November 7, Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton unveiled a $194.6
million budget for 1997 that includes increases to fight crime and improve
the Citys neighborhoods and infrastructure, but no tax increases for the
third straight year. In presenting the budget to the City Council, Sayles
Belton, characterized the spending plan as a public safety budget. <BR>
<BR>
The Mayor also called it her first post-recovery budget, reflecting the
fact that Minneapolis has the second lowest office vacancy rate in the nation
at 3.9 percent and has seen an increase in commercial and residential property
values. We have the resources to make the necessary public safety investments,
she said. In this budget, I recommend new investments of nearly $10.3 million,
including $2.2 million in federal grants, to strengthen our ability to fight
and prevent crime. <BR>
<BR>
The Mayor also recommended the resumption of investment in neighborhood
and government infrastructure improvements that were postponed because of
rising costs and cuts in state and federal funds.<BR>
<BR>
She cautioned, however, that the fight against crime doesnt tell the entire
story. Citing the recent <I>Fortune</I> ranking of Minneapolis as the fourth
best city nationwide in which to do business, and a similar high ranking
by <I>Entrepreneur</I> magazine, the Mayor stressed the need to build upon
what is good about Minneapolis. Sayles Belton pointed to development in
the downtown area, which makes up 40 percent of the Citys tax base: construction
of a new Target Store, office towers and Riverfront development. She also
noted the new Quarry Retail Center in Northeast Minneapolis and a remodeled
Lunds grocery store in Uptown as signs of growth and development.<BR>
<BR>
Sayles Belton outlined initiatives to support major City priorities. Among
them were:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Safe Neighborhoods </B>By June, the Police Departments authorized strength
of 922 officers will be on the streets. The number an all-time high will
allow the zero-tolerance for gateway crimes that affect our residents and
their neighborhoods and lead to more serious offenses. <BR>
<BR>
The Mayor said better enforcement without aggressive prosecution would be
meaningless. In 1997, Minneapolis will start a one-year pilot program to
bolster the prosecution of misdemeanors, including domestic assault. Referring
to priorities being developed by the City and the Criminal Justice Coordinating
Committee, the Mayor cited a Hennepin County Drug Court and state supervision
of criminals on parole or probation. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Liveable Neighborhoods </B>Sayles Belton said that residents and businesses
should have an unprecedented voice in the decisions made about their neighborhoods.
We will consult them about where to put street lights and signs, how to
calm traffic, what kind of trees, plants and paving they prefer, the Mayor
said. Livablility doesnt come from a one-size-fits-all program. It comes
from respecting lifestyles, needs and desires of real people.<BR>
<BR>
The Mayor noted that the time has come for a plan to maintain the citys
streets during the upcoming decades now that 30 years of road construction
has been completed. The maintenance plan, still under development by Public
Works, has no effect on the 1997 budget but will affect the 1998 spending
plan.<BR>
<BR>
Sayles Belton proposed setting up a one-stop permit shop, where citizens
could have access to histories of all properties and information about them
from every City department. The service would cost $117,000 in 1997. She
also recommended boosting the snow removal budget by $200,000 to hire seasonal
workers during the winter months to help ease the negotiation of icy streets
and sidewalks. <BR>
<BR>
Neighborhood cleanups and graffiti-removal should be increased she said.
The budget contains a $100,000 boost in graffiti-removal funds.<BR>
<BR>
She also recommended spending $195,000 next year to conduct inspections
of South Minneapolis households to ensure that sound-insulated homes near
the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport are up to code.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Health, Families and Children </B>The Mayor recommended a $159,000 increase
in the spending for Way to Grow, a program that helps parents find the resources
to care for their preschool children. She also announced that the City had
received a $5 million federal grant to help track and manage lead poisoning
in the citys children. The grant also will be used to eliminate dangerous
lead levels in 200 Minneapolis homes.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Economy </B>She recommended investing $430,175 in housekeeping and
production staffing to keep the Minneapolis Convention Center operating,
and spending $150,000 to begin a detailed plan to Downtown and Riverfront
development.<BR>

<H2><I>City of Minneapolis Actions &amp; Issues -- December 6, 1996</I></H2>

<P><I>ON THE AGENDA provides information on issues, programs and actions
of the City of Minneapolis. Editor: Bill Carter, 673-2009. FAX: 673-3250.
This is Issue 5, Volume 13. Next issue will be December 20. ON THE AGENDA

<H2>Animal Control, Vets Join For Licensing, Rabies Prevention</H2>

<P>Minneapolis Animal Control and local veterinarians have teamed up to
allow owners to buy pet licenses and get rabies shots for their dogs and
cats - all in one spot. The pet licensing and rabies shot campaign runs
through Sunday, December 15.</P>

<P>For neutered dogs and cats or pets that are less than eight months old,
the cost of the 1997 license and rabies shot is just $15. The cost is $20
for unaltered adult dogs and cats. Written proof that a pet has been neutered
is required.</P>

<P>Owners of dogs and cats that have wandered off often can be traced and
notified through license tags worn by their pets. Most times, a telephone
call is all that is necessary to reunite a licensed animal with its owner.
Without the tag, finding a lost pet can be much more difficult.</P>

<P>Locations, dates and times are:</P>

<P>- Animal Medical Clinic, 2603 Hennepin Avenue South, Saturday, December
7, 2 p.m. to 5 p.m..</P>

<P>- Camden Pet Hospital, 1401 44th Avenue North, Saturday, December 7,
2 p.m. to 5 p.m.</P>

<P>- Martin Luther King Neighborhood Center, 41st and Nicollet, Sunday,
December 8, 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.</P>

<P>- People's Veterinary Clinic, 2000 South 5th Street, Saturday, December
14, 8:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.</P>

<H2>Initiative Against Racism Hires Executive Director</H2>

<P>The Minneapolis Initiative Against Racism has hired Joanne Jackson, an
experienced community organizer, as its new executive director. Jackson
will be responsible for organizational development, implementation of a
long-range public relations campaign, fund-raising, and other efforts to
increase support for the Initiative. She assumed her responsibilities on
December 1.</P>

<P>&quot;I have dedicated myself personally and professionally to the eradication
of racism,&quot; Jackson says. &quot;In building on the MIAR's past successes,
I hope to increase awareness about institutional racism and marshal the
human and financial resources necessary to dismantle its devastating effects.&quot;</P>

<P>Among other things, Jackson plans to conduct training workshops for churches
and community organizations, strengthen fund-raising efforts, and raise
the visibility of the Initiative through billboards, public-service announcements,
and a cable television program.</P>

<P>Jackson's extensive management history includes directorships of highly
successful fund-raising campaigns, volunteer recruitment programs and design
of diversity-training curricula. Most recently, Jackson worked for the Mental
Health Division of the Minnesota Department of Human Services directing
the Multicultural Task Force and Advisory Committee.</P>

<P>From 1987 to 1989, she served as Director of Community Outreach for the
U.S. Department of Commerce. She was appointed in 1989 by Mayor Don Fraser
to direct the Minneapolis Census '90 Complete Count Campaign. In 1990, Jackson
was commended by then Mayor Don Fraser and City Council President Sharon
Sayles Belton for her leadership, which resulted in the City of Minneapolis
being cited as &quot;exemplary&quot; in its 1990 census count by the U.S.
Census Bureau.</P>

<P>Established in 1992, the Minneapolis Initiative Against Racism seeks
to break the cycle of racial misunderstanding, prejudice, and racism in
order to provide equal economic and social access to people of all cultures
and races. Nine task forces have been working to eliminate racism in the
media, housing, business, and other areas. Additional volunteers are welcome
and needed. For information, or to join a task force, call 962-4848.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2>There's No Business Like Snow Business</H2>

<P>Minneapolis snow fighters come in all shapes and varieties,&quot; says
Brian Lokkesmoe, Director of Operations for Public Works. &quot;People always
think of the person in the plow, but there's an awful lot of support that
makes it all work.&quot;</P>

<P>Snow Emergencies typically involve 300 to 400 people. In addition to
about 160 drivers and operators, there are 50 or 60 mechanics and a half-dozen
dispatchers, plus supervisors and laborers, Impound Lot and enforcement
staff, street and bridge maintenance staff, and the people behind the scenes
answering phones, keeping track of payroll, and handling a slew of other
details.</P>

<P>Generally, four to six inches of snow needs to fall before the City declares
a Snow Emergency, but factors such as the condition of the streets before
the snowfall and the weather forecast must also be taken into consideration,
especially because every Snow Emergency costs at least $250,000. Lokkesmoe
recalls one March when it snowed 10 inches, but the City didn't declare
a Snow Emergency, because the forecast for the next day was 45 degrees and
sunny. The City lucked out, and the snow melted within two days.</P>

<P>Because back-to-back Snow Emergencies were declared on November 21 and
24, some City crews recently had to work 14 or more days in a row, many
of them 12-hour shifts each day. &quot;I'm always impressed by the responsiveness
of people,&quot; Lokkesmoe says. &quot;They're there when we need them.
They show up, get the work done, and don't complain.&quot;</P>

<P>For information on winter parking restrictions, call 348-SNOW, a 24-hour
hotline; pick up a brochure at a Tom Thumb Store; watch City Cable 34; or
visit the Minneapolis Home Page on the Internet at http://www.ci.mpls.mn.us.
<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2>City Provides Free Sand for Minneapolis Residents</H2>

<P>The City of Minneapolis provides free sand to residents to help keep
sidewalks safe for pedestrians. The sand is available at four street maintenance
yards. They are at 18th and Jefferson Street NE, 121 Glenwood Avenue North,
6036 Harriet Avenue South, and 4444 Snelling Avenue South.</P>

<P>The sand is furnished for the private use of residents only, not for
commercial use. It is accessible outside the yard gates 24 hours a day seven
days a week. Residents must bring their own shovel and bucket.</P>

<P>City ordinances require that sidewalks of single family homes and duplexes
be cleared within 24 hours after a snowfall. Sidewalks in commercial areas
and adjacent to apartment buildings must be cleared within four daylight
hours. Walks should be cleared to full width. To report unsafe sidewalks,
call 673-2441.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2>Corrections</H2>

<P>The November 15 issue of On The Agenda incorrectly reported the November
8 City Council action concurring with the Mayors recommendation to reappoint
or appoint persons to the Minneapolis Commission on Civil Rights. Lisa Albrecht,
James F. Cannon, Robert B. Fine, Anne LaLonde Laux and Ophelia Balcos were
reappointed to the commission. Dianne G. Marsh and Ron Elwood (not Ron Edwards
as reported) are new appointees. OTA also omitted the Council's appointment
of Duchess Harris to the commission.</P>

<P>The November issue also incorrectly reported an item from the Zoning
&amp; Planning committee. The moratorium applies only to correctional facilities
in residential districts. A proposed inclusion of elderly housing was deleted
before passage.</P>

<P>The Office of Public Affairs regrets these errors.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2>1997 Home Tour Seeks Nominations from Owners</H2>

<P>Now in its tenth year, the Minneapolis &amp; Saint Paul Home Tour is
a popular spring event for thousands of neighbors and remodeling enthusiasts.
The 1997 Home Tour will be held on Saturday, May 3 and Sunday, May  4.</P>

<P>Organized by the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, the tour builds
community awareness, encourages home improvement, and promotes city living.
The cities invite owners to nominate their homes for the tour starting January
2. The closing date for nominations is February 14. </P>

<P>As in past years, a variety of homes will be showcased, from newly constructed
homes with modern amenities to turn-of-the-century landmarks featuring rich
woodwork or stained glass. Owners from neighborhoods throughout both cities
will proudly share their remodeling and decorating triumphs. Memorable homes
from past years include a geodesic dome and a houseboat. The tour is also
an opportunity for neighborhood organizations to communicate the strengths
of their neighborhoods to prospective home buyers.</P>

<P>The tour is fun and satisfying event for both visitors and home owners.
&quot;This was something we could do to promote where we live,&quot; said
Jonathan Riehle, whose home was on the 1993 Home Tour. &quot;The tour benefits
the entire city and benefits us as well.&quot; </P>

<P>All homes will be selected by mid-March. <I>To nominate your Minneapolis
home, call the Office of Public Affairs, 673-2491.</I><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2>Winter News Briefs</H2>

<H3>City Bans Parking on Even Side of Streets</H3>

<P>Due to high levels of snow accumulation, Minneapolis officials have determined
that it is necessary to ban parking on the even side of residential streets
for the remainder of the winter. The ban began at 8 a.m. Wednesday, December
18. It will remain in effect until April 1 or until the City is confident
that the snow season is over.</P>

<P>&quot;We realize this will inconvenience many Minneapolis residents,&quot;
said Public Works Director David Sonnenberg, &quot;but the welfare and safety
of the public in terms of our ability to get emergency vehicles through
the streets must take precedence over the inconvenience.&quot; Sonnenberg
adds that last winter was the first time since the winter of 1991-92 that
the City had to restrict parking to one side of the street. &quot;We have
already received as much snowfall this season as we had by mid-January last
winter,&quot; he says.</P>

<P>During Snow Emergencies, cars will be allowed to park on the even side
of the street on the odd-side plowing day. Vehicles parked on the even side
any other time will be subject to tagging and towing. Enforcement will continue
throughout the ban.</P>

<P>To ensure public safety after heavy snowfalls, Sonnenberg also reminds
residents and business owners to clear their sidewalks down to the pavement,
across the full width, and all the way to the corner after the plows have
gone by for the last time. City ordinances require that sidewalks of single-family
homes and duplexes be cleared within 24 hours after a snowfall. Sidewalks
in commercial areas and adjacent to apartment buildings must be cleared
within four daytime hours.</P>

<P><I>Complete Snow Emergency parking information is always available on
348-SNOW, the City's 24-hour hotline, as well as City Cable Channel 34 and
the City web site at www.ci.mpls.mn.us. </I></P>

<H3>Garbage Carts Need Shoveling</H3>

<P>Winter is a difficult time for Minneapolis sanitation crews. Moving snowed-
or iced-in garbage carts is hazardous and increases injuries. Please help
out by clearing a three-foot-wide path between your garbage cart and the
alley or street and remember to cut a path through the windrow left by snow
plows.</P>

<P>Households that do not provide a path for their garbage carts will receive
a warning. If no path is created by the next collection day, the carts will
be shovelled out by the City at a charge of $19 for each cart.</P>

<P><I>Community organizations provide shoveling assistance for a fee. Seniors
and persons physically unable to keep their sidewalks and garbage cart paths
in good winter condition can call 673-3004 for a referral. Solid Waste and
Recycling will answer other questions; call 673-2917.</I></P>

<H3>City Simplifies Christmas Tree Collection </H3>

<P>For Minneapolis residents with City garbage and recycling collection
services, disposing of Christmas trees is easier than ever this year. Just
place them next to your garbage cart by 6 a.m. on any garbage collection
day. Remember to remove ornaments and tinsel, and cut trees taller than
six feet in half. If you want your tree composted, save the tree in your
back yard (not in the alley) until yard waste collection begins in mid-April.</P>

<P>Residents are also reminded that the City cannot recycle gift wrap, gift
and toy boxes, tissue paper, ribbons or other holiday packaging even if
the products' labels say they are recyclable. </P>

<P>In 1997, make a New Year's resolution that helps everyone: Work to reduce
the amount of trash you generate and increase the amount you reuse or recycle.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H2>City Job Listings Now on Web</H2>

<P>Employment opportunities with the City have been added recently to the
City's web site. The address is www.ci.mpls.mn.us. You can also get weekly
updates by calling 673-CITY, Option 11.<HR ALIGN=LEFT>  </P>

<P><B><I>City Retains AAA Rating</I></B><BR>
Minneapolis is proud to be one of only two cities with a population over 200,000
to receive the highest possible credit rating from both of the major rating
services. Moody's Investor's Service and Standard and Poor's gave Minneapolis a
rating of AAA, which translates to millions of dollars in lower interest costs,
because it assures bond buyers that Minneapolis is a financially safe and
attractive investment. Last year, the only other city of similar size to hold the
AAA rating from both rating services was Charlotte, North Carolina.

<P><B><I>The City of Minneapolis Is No Place for Prejudice</I></B><BR>
The programs and services of the City of Minneapolis are available to all
citizens. The Minneapolis Civil Rights Ordinance protects against discrimination
treatment based on race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, sex
(including sexual harassment), affectional preference, disability, age, marital
status, and status with regard to public assistance. The ordinance also protects
families with children in the rental and purchase of housing. For educational
materials and programs, or for information on how to file a discrimination
complaint, call the Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights, 673-3012.

<P><B><I>Call 673-LINK for Business Information and Services</I></B><BR>
When Kirk's Mobil, a service station at 46th Street and Fourth Avenue South,
wanted to install gas pumps, co-owner Kirk Anderson turned to BusinessLink for
assistance. BusinessLink, a business referral network at the MCDA, helped the
station apply for the necessary zoning changes and locate affordable financing to
remodel. BusinessLink can make it easier you to do business in Minneapolis, too,
by connecting you with professionals who can offer valuable financing and
technical assistance. Whenever you need to navigate City regulatory procedures
(licensing, zoning, and permits), locate a new office or industrial site, secure
affordable financing, or write a business or marketing plan, BusinessLink can
help. Call 673-LINK (5465).

<P><B><I>Council Meets on Fridays</I></B><BR>
Minneapolis City Council meetings take place at 9:30 a.m. every other Friday,
with the exception of four weeks a year. Meetings take place in Room 317 City
Hall. They are open to the public and aired live on <STRONG>City Cable
34</STRONG>. For a 1996 Council meeting schedule, call 673-3130. For a ward map,
call 673-2070.

<P><B><I>Mayor, Council Set Priorities to Guide City Spending</I></B><BR>
The Mayor and City Council have developed seven policy goals as part of their
effort to determine what the City's 1996 service priorities and budget
allocations ought to be:

<OL TYPE="1">
	<LI>Strong and healthy families and children.
	<LI>Livable neighborhoods that are safe.
	<LI>Education opportunities for all children through successful public schools.
	<LI>Access to convenient transportation services.
	<LI>Diverse, resilient economy that creates needed job opportunities.
	<LI>Strong, healthy downtown area for housing, commerce, employment, and entertainment.
	<LI>A municipal government that is efficient and effective, responsive to the needs of citizens and neighborhoods, and ensures quality service.
</OL>

<P><B><I>Advisory Committee Makes Minneapolis More Accessible</I></B><BR>
With help from residents, Minneapolis is striving to become a barrier-free city.
A 15-member Advisory Committee on People with Disabilities provides advice and
guidance to the Mayor and City Council regarding architectural and program
accessibility, employment, transportation, and housing. Anyone with an interest
in accessibility or disability issues is welcome to attend the committee's
monthly meetings. For more information, or to report a problem with
accessibility, call 673-3343 (TTY 673-3360).

<P><B><I>Home Tour Showcases City Living</I></B><BR>
The South Minneapolis home of Skeet Kelly and Diana Richards used to be a
single-story summer home on the river.  By the time they finished with the second
story, the home had become a unique statement on the diversity of city housing. 
To show off their pride in city life, Diana and Skeet welcomed visitors during
the 1995 Minneapolis-Saint Paul Home Tour.  In all, 50 homes in the two cities
were featured. The 1996 tour will be May 4 and 5. To nominate a home, call
673-2491.

<P><B><I>Vote for School Board on November 7, 1995</I></B><BR>
Minneapolis voters will elect School Board members on Tuesday, Nov. 7. The next
election for Mayor and City Council will be in 1997, when Council Members will
begin serving staggered terms. Members of odd-numbered wards will be elected to
two-year terms in 1997 and to four-year terms in 1999. Members of even-numbered
wards will be elected in 1997 and 2001. You can register to vote on or before
Election Day. If you don't know where to vote, or if you have other questions,
call 673-2070.

<P><B><I>City Honors Special Citizens</I></B><BR>
The Mayor and City Council present Minneapolis Awards every fall to citizens who
have &quot;gone the extra mile&quot; to enrich the arts, education, business, or
some other aspect of the city. Anyone who lives or works in Minneapolis is
eligible to receive one of these awards. For nomination forms, call 673-2491.

<P><B><I>Visit City Hall on City Cable 34</I></B><BR>
When you can't get to City Hall, City Cable 34 brings City Hall to you. Council
Meetings air live at 9:15 a.m. Council Fridays and are rerun at 6 p.m. Fridays,
Mondays, and Wednesdays. City Beat recaps decisions made at Council meetings and
examines issues currently before the Council. Artifacts covers the local arts
scene and features interviews with local artists and arts policy makers. Twin
Cities 10 Most Wanted profiles local criminals and offers rewards for information
leading to their arrest. Mayor's Roundtable, hosted by the Mayor, explores issues
facing Minneapolis.

<P>Check round-the-clock videotext for job openings, program schedules, snow
emergencies, and other news. For a quarterly program guide, call 673-2234. For
cable installation and subscription rates, call 522-2000.

<P><B><I>City's Share of Your Property Tax Bill Is Only 17 Percent</I></B><BR>
Nearly half of your property taxes help support the Minneapolis Public Schools.
About one-quarter of them pay for municipal services, including parks and
libraries. Police service receives the largest share of municipal property taxes,
followed by Fire, Parks, and Public Works. Property taxes are based on estimated
market value as determined by the City Assessor and a formula established by the
State.

<P>Where Your Municipal Property Tax Dollars Go:
<PRE>
     Police        (29%)
     Fire          (15%)
     Public Works  (14%)
     Other         (20%)
     Parks         (15%)
     Libraries      (7%)
</PRE>

<P>Where Your Property Taxes Go:

<P><B><I>Organize a Neighborhood Clean Sweep</I></B><BR>
Clean Sweeps are Saturday clean-up events organized by registered neighborhood
groups and assisted by Minneapolis Solid Waste and Recycling. Neighborhood groups
promote the event, and volunteers load neighborhood garbage into trucks provided
by Solid Waste and Recycling, which also pays disposal fees. This is a good
opportunity for elderly residents to get assistance from their neighbors. If you
are interested in helping with a Clean Sweep, contact your local neighborhood
group. For additional information about solid-waste disposal, call Solid Waste
and Recycling, 673-2917.

<P><B><I>Leave Clippings When You Mow</I></B><BR>
For an easy way to a thick, healthy yard, leave grass clippings as you mow. Short
grass clippings filter down to the soil, protecting your lawn's roots from the
sun and helping to retain moisture. As grass clippings decompose, nutrients are
recycled back into your soil. Leaving clippings for a whole year is equal to one
fertilizer application. For a brochure about grass clippings and lawn care, call
Solid Waste and Recycling, 673-2917.

<P><B><I>Transfer Station Takes Old Carpet</I></B><BR>
Minneapolis residents with City solid-waste collection services can drop off
carpet at the Transfer Station for no extra charge. Just obtain a voucher from
Solid Waste and Recycling. There is no limit to the length and weight of a carpet
roll dropped off at the Transfer Station. For a voucher, call 673-2917.

<P><B><I>Vouchers Let Residents Drop Off Building, Paving Materials</I></B><BR>
Save on disposal costs when you remove a sidewalk or tear off a roof. Minneapolis
residents with City solid-waste collection services can obtain vouchers
permitting them to drop off building or paving materials at no additional charge.
Best of all, concrete and asphalt will be recycled in City paving projects. For a
voucher or more details, call 673-2917.

<P><B><I>Buy Reusable Building Materials</I></B><BR>
Located in the Hi-Lake Shopping Center, 2216 Lake St E, the Reuse Center sells
reusable building materials. The inventory includes items such as hardware,
fixtures, doors, cabinets, molding, and dimension lumber. Purchase reused
building materials to match an existing architectural style, to create unique
signature pieces, to save money, and to help the environment. The Reuse Center
also provides home-improvement classes and is working with the Science Museum of
Minnesota on environmental education. For more information, call 724-2608.

<P><I>Lend A Hand: Purchase products made from recycled materials. Examples range
from recycled lawn edging to polar-fleece jackets. Look for the words
&quot;post-consumer recycled.&quot;</I>

<P><B><I>Holidazzle Lights Up the City Beginning November 24</I></B><BR>
The annual Holidazzle celebration will transform downtown Minneapolis into a
colorful wonderland with 28 free evening parades, beginning Friday, November 24.
A marching band and a choir accompany lighted floats with nursery-rhyme and
fairy-tale themes down Nicollet Mall from 12th Street to Fourth Street. Santa
Claus and his lighted reindeer provide the grand finale. The parades start at
6:30 p.m. and last about 30 minutes. See the November and December calendars for
the complete schedule.

<P><B><I>Avoid a Tow - Call 348-SNOW</I></B><BR>
A towed vehicle makes winter much colder, so please review the 1995-96
Minneapolis Snow Emergency regulations. For up-to-the-minute parking information,
call 348-SNOW (7669). In general, at least four inches of snow must fall before a
snow emergency is declared. Don't park in the street during hours when parking is
prohibited, even if your street appears to be plowed; additional plowing may be
necessary. When you go out of town, please arrange for someone to clear your
sidewalk and move your vehicles during Snow Emergencies.

<P><B><I>Safe Sidewalks Are Every Citizen's Responsibility</I></B><BR>
Everyone gets involved in keeping our sidewalks clear of snow during the winter
months. Older neighbors or those with disabilities may need a helping hand, and
everyone can pitch in to remove built-up snow from corners and fire hydrants.
City ordinances require that sidewalks of single-family homes and duplexes be
clear 24 hours after a snowfall. Sidewalks of commercial areas or apartment
buildings must be cleared within four daytime hours. Community organizations can
provide shoveling assistance for a fee to people with disabilities. Seniors can
call 673-3004 for a referral. Call 673-2441 to report unsafe sidewalks.

<P><B><I>Do the Town and Park for Free in Downtown Minneapolis</I></B><BR>
Park free downtown with a purchase of $20 or more at any one of nearly 200
participating shops and restaurants on weekday evenings and weekends. Just enter
any parking facility displaying the green &quot;Do The Town&quot; parking sign
after 4 p.m. Monday through Friday or anytime weekends. Ask for a free parking
voucher when you make your purchase (receipts will not be accepted), then present
the voucher to the parking attendant when you head home. For more information,
call the Downtown Council, 338-3807.

<P><I>Lend a Hand: Please clear snow down to the pavement 
and across the full width of your sidewalk so that 
people traveling in wheelchairs can get by.</I>

<P><B><I>Parking Lots - Not Just for Cars</I></B><BR>
The City's parking ramps and lots serve thousands of downtown commuters and
shoppers daily. They also offer convenient, low-cost parking for people attending
events at the Convention Center, the Metrodome, and Target Center. The ramps are
a vital part of the transit system, and some include terminals for MCTO buses and
lockers for bicycles. The City's parking lots also provide sites for downtown
events such as Ribfest. Habitat for Humanity even built a house on a parking lot
and then moved the home to a neighborhood. For information on municipal parking,
call 673-2411.

<P><B><I>300 More Places to Park</I></B><BR>
Watch for the opening of a new municipal parking ramp in December 1996. The ramp
in the Federal Courts Building will connect to the skyway system, and it will
include lockers and showers for bicyclists.

<P><B><I>Cedar Lake Commuter Bicycle Trail Opens</I></B><BR>
Minneapolis residents are among the most avid bicyclists in the country, and
their city reflects that. Broad, smooth and traffic-free, the new Cedar Lake
Commuter Trail is the latest addition to a world-class system of bicycle lanes
and paths. The system spans 77 miles and includes bicycle lanes in downtown
Minneapolis; smooth, flat trails for commuters and recreational cyclists; and
convenient bicycle racks and lockers. To protect your safety as a bicyclist, the
City enforces bicycling &quot;rules of the road.&quot; For a copy of these rules,
call 673-2411.

<P><B><I>Road and Home Construction Continue Along Hiawatha Avenue</I></B><BR>
Watch for progress on the missing link in Hiawatha Avenue. Construction will
start in Spring 1996 on the overpass at Lake Street. By 1998, Hiawatha will be
completed from downtown to 46th Street. Construction south of 46th Street is
scheduled to start in late 1997. With help from the MCDA, new homes are being
built along the &quot;Hiawatha Corridor.&quot; For more information on home
building, call the MCDA, 673-5233.

<P><B><I>Carpool and Park for Less</I></B><BR>
Sharing rides helps the community by saving energy, improving air quality, and
easing rush-hour congestion. Carpooling will also help you save money. The City
works with Minnesota Rideshare and the Minnesota Department of Transportation to
support ridesharing. Special rates for carpools are available in some municipal
parking ramps and lots. Call 349-RIDE for more rideshare information.

<P><B><I>Move Cars for Street Sweeping</I></B><BR>
Minneapolis sweeps its streets each spring and fall. Sweeping begins in mid-April
and mid-October and takes about four weeks. Be careful where you park during
street sweeping. The City posts &quot;No Parking&quot; signs the day before it
sweeps streets. Vehicles illegally parked during sweeping are towed to the
Municipal Impound Lot.

<P><B><I>Low-interest Loans Available for Home Improvements</I></B><BR>
Want to expand your kitchen? Add a bathroom? Repair the roof? Low-interest
home-improvement loans are available from the MCDA. Homeowners with incomes of
$41,000 or less may qualify. Some MCDA loans don't even have to be paid back
unless you sell the house, move, or transfer the title. For more information,
call the MCDA, 673-5286.

<P><B><I>Keep Your House Up, Taxes Down</I></B><BR>
This Old House, a tax incentive approved by the legislature in 1993, offers
savings to owners of older homes. Those who have improved their property since
Jan. 1, 1993, are eligible for these savings. If your home is between 35 and 70
years old, you can get a property-tax exclusion equal to half of the increase in
property value, up to $25,000. If your home is more than 70 years old, you can
get an exclusion equal to the entire increase in value, up to $50,000. For
example, if a new kitchen and bath raise the market value of your 78-year-old
home from $80,000 to $100,000, you won't be taxed on the $20,000 increase for 10
years. The exclusion will then phase out over the next five years. The deadline
for This Old House applications is June 30. For more information, call the City
Assessor, 673-2382.

<P><B><I>MCDA Provides Below-Market-Rate Loans to Home Buyers</I></B><BR>
The Minneapolis Community Development Agency (MCDA) has helped thousands of
people realize the dream of home ownership through a variety of below-market-rate
home loans for buyers -- and homeowners looking to refinance -- with incomes up
to $89,250. If you're planning to fix up an old home or build a new one, or if
you're just looking for a traditional mortgage, the MCDA can provide mortgage,
closing-cost, and down-payment assistance. To talk with a mortgage representative
about the best program for you, call 673-5288.

<P><B><I>Your Neighborhood Organization Needs You</I></B><BR>
Minneapolis neighborhood organizations are an important part of making the city
work. Members work closely with Community Crime Prevention/SAFE, the Neighborhood
Revitalization Program, the MCDA, and other City offices on safety and livability
issues. They also plan neighborhood festivals, ice-cream socials, and other
community-building events. To find out which organizations are active in your
neighborhood, please call 673-5239.

<P><I>Lend A Hand: Volunteers for the Metro Paint-A-Thon help 
elderly, disabled, and low-income residents paint their 
homes. Call 870-3660 by June 1.</I>

<P><B><I>MCDA Offers Business Loans</I></B><BR>
Neighborhood businesses bring goods, services, and jobs close to residents and
make Minneapolis a better place to live and work. That's why the Minneapolis
Community Development Agency offers business loans with below-market-rate terms
to finance operations, purchase inventory, or make building improvements.
Minneapolis also has more than 30 business associations, which meet to share
ideas, learn about expansion and improvement programs, and discuss strategies for
strengthening their commercial areas. To learn more about MCDA business loans or
to connect with your nearest business association, call 673-5071.

<P><B><I>NRP Makes a Difference</I></B><BR>
Thousands of your neighbors are working with local government, businesses, and
nonprofit organizations to make Minneapolis a better place to live, work, learn,
and play. With help from the Minneapolis Neighborhood Revitalization Program
(NRP), they are meeting their housing, safety, economic development, recreation,
health, social service, environment, and transportation needs. Currently, 80 of
the city's 81 neighborhoods are involved in the NRP. Get involved in the NRP
activities in your neighborhood; call 673-5140.

<P><B><I>City Inspectors Help Preserve Quality Neighborhoods</I></B><BR>
City inspectors help ensure that Minneapolis homes and businesses are safe and
properly maintained. They also inspect construction sites and check for
compliance with environmental and zoning regulations. You can help, too. If you
witness illegal dumping, try to get a license number and description of the
driver, then call 673-2895. If you see graffiti, report it to 673-2090.

<P><B><I>Valuing Diversity</I></B><BR>
Like other major cities across the country, Minneapolis is becoming increasingly
diverse. Signs of our changing demographics are all around us: diverse
publications on our newsstands, non-traditional performances at our theaters,
ethnic restaurants in our neighborhoods. Minneapolis values this diversity, and
many citizens are working to ensure equal treatment and opportunity for all
through their involvement in the Advisory Committee on People with Disabilities,
the Minneapolis Initiative Against Racism, and other volunteer groups.

<P><I>Lend A Hand: Join the Minneapolis Initiative Against Racism, which fights
discrimination in business, housing, the media, and other areas. Call 730-6256
for more information.</I>

<P><B><I>Get to Know Minneapolis' Finest Natural Resource</I></B><BR>
From the natural beauty of Minnehaha Falls to the serenity of the Berger fountain
in Loring Park and the inexorable movement of the mighty Mississippi, Minneapolis
is truly a city made beautiful by water. With more than 80 miles of parkways
winding along the shores of the city's lakes and rivers, you'll always be able to
get lost in the serenity of a gurgling stream or relish in the driving thunder of
a waterfall.

<P><B><I>SPEEDREAD Installation Nears Completion</I></B><BR>
Most Minneapolis residents now have their water meters read automatically by a
new system called SPEEDREAD. Since January 1992, the Water Works has installed
SPEEDREAD in more than 80 percent of Minneapolis homes. SPEEDREAD consists of a
new water meter and a meter interface unit (MIU), which is connected to
residents' telephone lines. The MIU is programmed to read meters once a month,
convert the data into a digital format, and send the information over the phone
line to a central computer in the downtown Utility Billing Office. SPEEDREAD
eliminates the need to send meter readers door-to-door and estimate bills when
residents are not home. If you do not yet have SPEEDREAD, call 1-800-648-3244 to
have it installed, free of charge.

<P><B><I>Monthly Utility Billing Begins</I></B><BR>
To assist residents with budgeting, the City is switching from quarterly to
monthly billing for water, sewer, and solid waste. The changeover began in August
1995 and was expected to take five months. Monthly billing is available only to
customers with SPEEDREAD, the City's automatic water meter reading system.
Residents without SPEEDREAD will continue to be billed quarterly.

<P><B><I>Separating Sewers Stops Pollution, Saves Money</I></B><BR>
A 10-year effort to stop pollution of the Mississippi River will conclude in
1996. This effort has involved separating storm and sanitary sewers to prevent
the overflow of untreated sewage during large rainstorms and snow melts.
Separating the sewers has saved the City an average of $625,000 a year by
reducing the amount of water requiring purification at the treatment plant by
millions of gallons a year.

<P><B><I>Clean Water Takes Partnership</I></B><BR>
Even if you don't live by a lake, what you do at home affects the water in the
lakes and creeks. The water that drains off your yard and driveway is carried to
the lakes and creeks by the storm-sewer system. Landscaping that reduces erosion
and lawn care that is kind to the environment help protect water quality. Avoid
raking leaves into the street and never pour oil and antifreeze down the storm
drains harm local waters. The City of Minneapolis is part of an innovative Clean
Water Partnership that is improving water quality in the Chain of Lakes. The
partnership is one of the largest urban water restoration programs in the
country. It is restoring wetlands, including Cedar Meadows; building stormwater
ponds; and constructing grit chambers to remove pollutants from stormwater. The
City's partners include the City of St. Louis Park, Hennepin County, the
Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, the Minnehaha Creek Watershed District,
and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. To learn how to help improve water
quality, call 348-4448.

<P><I>Lend A Hand: Help stencil storm drains to remind people that what they put
down the storm drain flows directly to lakes and streams. Call 927-8563.</I>

<P><B><I>National Night Out Helps Build Community</I></B><BR>
Each year in August, neighbors across the city fill their streets for National
Night Out. Locally-planned events are as diverse as the neighborhoods and include
parades, concerts and entertainment for kids. The evening provides opportunities
to get to know your neighbors and underscores that strong neighborhoods, where
people are involved and know one another, are consistently safer and more stable.

<P><B><I>Firefighters Respond to Calls in an Average of 3.5 Minutes</I></B><BR>
With 20 well-equipped stations located throughout the city, the Fire Department
responds to approximately 30,000 calls a year, arriving in an average of 3.5
minutes. Fighting fires is just part of a firefighter's service to citizens. They
also respond to medical emergencies, check blood pressure at all stations,
inspect commercial buildings, drop off fire-safety information to residents
annually, and teach children about fire safety during fire safety camps. You can
help by reading fire-safety information, checking your home for unsafe wiring or
flammable items, replacing the old battery in your smoke detector, and properly
storing flammable items. For more information call 673-3290.

<P><B><I>Police Officers Meet the Public, Maintain Safety</I></B><BR>
Community policing, the philosophy that guides the Minneapolis Police Department,
means police cooperate with other agencies, departments, businesses, and
residents to identify priority problems as well as long-term solutions. The
regular contact with citizens achieved through permanent shifts, bike patrols,
the mounted patrol, and other community policing strategies builds trust and
facilitates the exchange of information, which results in better service and
stronger neighborhoods. The creation of the downtown mounted patrol is a result
of the cooperative efforts between the City and the Downtown Council. The City
agreed to provide the Police officers, and the Council agreed to provide the
funds necessary to implement the program and cover monthly operational costs.

<P><B><I>Knowing Your Neighbors Is Key to Keeping Crime Down</I></B><BR>
Neighbors are more effective deterrents to crime than expensive security systems,
according to the experts. People who connect with each other, take ownership in
the quality of life on their block, and work to solve problems that arise are
crucial to safe, stable neighborhoods. The Police Department's Community Crime
Prevention/SAFE office provides resources and support to block and apartment
clubs, including workshops and printed materials on personal and home safety,
property management, and other neighborhood safety issues. Another important
resource, the McGruff House program, recruits residents who can offer safe places
for children to go in emergencies. Teams of civilian crime-prevention specialists
and police officers coordinate neighborhood crime-prevention activities
throughout the city. To get involved in making your neighborhood safer, call the
CCP/SAFE office, 673-3015.

<P><I>Lend A Hand: Keep your neighborhood safe and meet your neighbors by joining
a block club. Call 673-3015 for information.</I>

<P><I>The City-sponsored safety camp is a great way for kids to learn safe
habits. Call 348-2183.</I>

<H3><BLINK>Start of POLDER/ADEOS Routine Acquisition phase</BLINK></H3>
Following completion of ADEOS commissioning phase (3 months), POLDER has now started  its routine acquisition phase. The intrument is functionning nominally.The 5 months Calibration phase is beginning at CNES. Several vicarious calibration methods are operated within the Image Quality System of POLDER Ground Segment.

<HR>
<H3>The First POLDER Images</H3>

<B>THE FIRST IMAGES ACQUIRED BY POLDER OVER FRANCE</B><P>
<P>
POLDER acquires images through eight spectral filters in the visible and near infrared spectrum and also through polarizers.<BR>
This pair of images shows the same September 16th 1996 first acquisition over France in natural light (left image) and polarized light (right image).<BR>
Each image is a blue, green and red color composite of POLDER measurements at 443 nm, 670 nm and 865 nm.<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/Mosaic_com_4.gif"><P><P>
On the <B>conventional image</B> (left), marked differences appear between the clouds (in white) and different types of surfaces: vegetation in red, soil in brown and yellow, sea in dark blue. The bright spot in the Mediterranean Sea, west of the island of Sardinia, is the sunglint pattern.<P>
On the <B>polarized image</B> (right) the color blue prevails and the geographic contours can hardly be recognized. This is because the polarized light mainly results from scattering in the atmosphere which increases at shorter wavelengths. The clouds still appear in grey or white and the sunglint spot in the Mediterranean Sea corresponds to a strong polarized signal.<P>
The additional information provided by these original polarized measurements allows a better characterization of the atmospheric contribution to the signal measured at the top of the atmosphere, and thus an improvement in the determination of both surface and cloud parameters of interest.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=50% SIZE=5>
<P><P>
<B>FIRST SEQUENCE OF POLDER IMAGES  OVER EUROPE AND   NORTH  AFRICA</B><P>
This is the first sequence (top to bottom and left to right) of images taken by POLDER onboard ADEOS on September 16th.<P>Each image is a blue, green and red color composite of POLDER measurements at 443 nm, 670 nm and 865 nm. Marked differences appear between the clouds (in white) and different types of surfaces: vegetation in red, soil in brown and yellow, sea in dark blue.<P>
An examination of the same area followed from one image to the other shows large variations in intensity. In the Mediterranean Sea a bright spot corresponding to  sunglint appears west of Corsica and moves southwards before disappearing near the African coast (images 1 to 3).<P>
Owing to its wide field of view POLDER can take images of a single target successively from different viewing angles. This unique capacity allows the directional properties of the radiation reflected by land surfaces and clouds to be characterized and studied.<P><P>

In the field of Earth and Environmental Sciences, CNES' action is indissociable from that of the French science research national center, CNRS, (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique), the French Universities and the other national research organizations. Indeed, they are directly responsible for defining the scientific objectives and the national research programmes in which they participate. Furthermore, wherever the space research carried out in this field promotes the progress or the emergence of applications such as meteorology, harvest forecasts or monitoring of natural risks, it also mobilizes, along with CNES, the major French organizations responsible for these applications. <P>
CNES'action aims to define, to design, develop and operate, in close collaboration with the laboratories, the space systems, the ground segments and certain airbone experiments which meet the needs expressed by the scientific community, and its action also aims to promote the use of the observations collected by orbiting systems. CNES participates directly in space research in the fields of oceanography, geodesy and of the continental biosphere through two French laboratories it shares with CNRS, the LERTS and the UMR39/GRGS. <P>

<A NAME="Intro">
<H2> Introduction </H2>

This programme includes two complementary parts, devoted respectively to the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and the International Geosphere - Biosphere Programme (IGBP). <P>

The study of the ocean, of the meteorological atmosphere and of their interactions is broached within the framework of the first part which concentrates on the physical aspects of the climate. This part includes the Franco-American altimetric mission, <A HREF="/topex/Mission.html">TOPEX/POSEIDON</A> which constitutes the reference element of the space system for observation set up for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (<A HREF="#OceanClimate">WOCE</A>). France is also participating in this system by its contribution to ESA's ERS programme. The study of the aerosol-clouds-radiation-dynamic interactions, one of the priorities of the Global Energy and Water cycle EXperiment (<A HREF="#Gewex">GEWEX</A>) Programme, is the  objective of a specific instrument programme which comprises the <A HREF="/scarab/Mission.html">SCARAB</A> radiometer for observing the radiation budget, the ALISSA altimetric lidar and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (<A HREF="/iasi/Mission.html">IASI</A>). The POLarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (<A HREF="/polder/Mission.html">POLDER</A>) imaging radiometer-polarimeter, designed for the <A HREF="http://hdsn.eoc.nasda.go.jp/guide/guide/satellite/satdata/adeos_e.html">ADEOS mission</A> is also an element in this instrument programme. It constitutes a link between the two parts of the french programme to the degree that the study of the biosphere and of aerosol cycle, two themes of the IGBP, will also be benefiting from the richness of its measurements.  Shared between the goals of WCRP and IGBP, the stratospheric research programme also contributes to both parts. It owes its originality to a balloon-borne observation programme, open to the international community. <P>

The second part, devoted to the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, is centered on the study of the biosphere. It is based on the continuity and on the evolution of the SPOT Programme, on the complementarity of the <A HREF="http://www-projet.cnes.fr:8050/">VEGETATION</A> and POLDER instruments and on a set of airborne systems.<P>

ERS and <A HREF="/topex/Mission.html">TOPEX/POSEIDON</A> are the space components of the observation system of WOCE, which, in a pre-operational configuration, makes it possible to characterize ocean circulation at various space-time scales and the atmospheric forcing at the ocean-atmospheric interface. The TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetric programme is conducted in cooperation by CNES and NASA. The spacecraft was launched by ARIANE on August 10, 1992. Defined by the international oceanographic community, the mission was entirely optimized to meet the requirements of the WOCE programme. In addition to the launcher, CNES supplied the POSEIDON solid state compact altimeter, the <A HREF="/doris/Mission.html">DORIS</A> POSEIDON control and processing center and the AVISO system for post-processing and distribution of all the mission's data. AVISO/EDDIE completes the <A HREF="http://www.ifremer.fr/cersat/english/">CERSAT system operated by IFREMER</A>, to benefit ESA with the production and distribution of oceanic low rate data from the ERS-1 and 2 missions. <P>

 Since January 1993, the total technical success of the TOPEX/POSEIDON mission has been demonstrated. The excellent performance of the two altimeters, the subdecimetric precision of the orbit calculated by the DORIS system and the excellent operation of the data processing and distribution system confirmed the pertinence of the choice of the Science Working Team of NASA and of CNES.  The results obtained attest that the mission's goal was largely exceeded, and they open new scientific prospects and orient the definition of future altimetric systems. <P>

Henceforth, what is needed is continuity of an altimetric observation system including a TOPEX/POSEIDON class reference mission plus at least one other satellite - ideally two - in order to best observe the marine geoid, the whirlpools, the major currents such as the Gulfstream, the Kuro Shivo and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the "El Nino" climatic anomalies, the tides and the Waves, the ice and the level variations sea. Given the maturity of the technologies, that of the community of users and the anticipated scientific and operational, advantages involved such as system would naturally fit within the ocean component, Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) of the worldwide climate observation system. To contribute to this undertaking, CNES is participating in the ENVISAT altimetric mission, providing the DORIS orbitography service and CNES is carrying out the design of a series of operational altimetric mini-satellites, destined to continue the TOPEX/POSEIDON observations at least cost and at the same performancelevel. <P>

Two major surveys at sea, devoted to the study of the ocean-atmosphere exchanges and the medium scale ocean circulation, SOFIA and SEMAPHORE, were organized in 1992 and 1993. They supply an integrating framework for researches and make it possible to establish the contribution of the ERS and TOPEX/POSEIDON measurements and to reinforce the validation of the reversal techniques and to assess the representativity of the space measurements. Like the works validating the ERS-1 data, they benefited from the availability of original onboard instruments such as the RESSAC conical sounding radar or the PORTOS hyperfrequency radiometer. <P>

Research on this theme is mobilizing many laboratories and organizations and is supported by the joint use of globally oriented space systems, airborne equipment which is indispensable to the study of mesoscale processes and to a hierarchy of digital models. <P>

France is developing a series of dedicated instruments for GEWEX, to observe the radiation budget, the three-dimensional thermodynamic structure of the atmosphere, the clouds and the aerosols. The radiation pattern observation programme is based upon the <A HREF="/scarab/Mission.html">SCARAB</A> instrument, designed by the Laboratoire de M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie Dynamique and ROSHYDROMET (Russia) and is also based on <A HREF="../CNESaction/polder.html">POLDER</A>.  An initial series of two to three instruments will be used on Russian meteorological satellites of the METEOR series, as part of the Franco-Russian cooperation. The first was launched on 25 January 1994 from the Plessetsk cosmodrome. An international annoucement of opportunities for proposals involving the validation and scientific use of the data has been released on January, 1995. The second flight model is expected to be launched in 1997 onboard the RESSURS satellite. With time, the <A HREF="../scarab/Mission.html">SCARAB</A> instrument might find its natural place on the METOP operational meteorological missions, developped by ESA and EUMETSAT for a launching at the beginning of the next century. The POLDER imaging polarimeter radiometer is an instrument which complements SCARAB and whose function is to study the radiation impact of aerosols, the physical properties of clouds and the two-directional distribution functions of short waves fluxes. The franco-russian lidar, ALISSA, will make it possible, within the framework of a short duration exploration experiment on the MIR space station, to analyze the potential contribution of cloud altimetry to the study of the interactions between clouds and radiation. <P> 

The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) is now being studied in Phase B as part of an european cooperation.  Its performances, particularly in terms of space resolution and radiometric budget will enable to observe the temperature and humidity profiles in the troposphere with a vertical precision and resolution beyond the possibility of the present operational probes, and to obtain measurements of the integrated contents of ozone, methane and carbon monoxide which play key roles in the troposphere's chemistry and in the additional greenhouse effect. IAS is designed for the METOP polar meteorological mission. It will be used for the joint needs of climate research and operational meteorological forecasts. <P>

 The airborne programme, developed in cooperation with INSU, METEO-FRANCE, IGN and CNET is part of the PATOM (Meso-scale Oceanography ATmosphere Programme). <P>

The complexity of the operating processes of the ecosystems and the heterogeneity of the coverage imposes an observation strategy concentrating on the integration of the scales and of the various parameters observed. This is supported by the combination of high and medium resolution spaceborne and airborne imagery and ground-based measurements. In this field the french space effort is based on the continuity and evolution of the SPOT programme. <P>

HVR (High Resolution Visible) imagery is particularly used in the framework of the SALT experiment to characterize the evolution of zones of sensitive gradients and <A HREF="http://www.orstom.fr/hapex/index.html">HAPEX</A> type surveys. <A HREF="../spot/Mission.html">SPOT 4</A> will constitute a decisive evolution with the addition of a mid-infrared channel to the HRV imager (having become HRVIR) and above all, thanks to the <A HREF="http://www-projet.cnes.fr:8050/">VEGETATION</A> system, co-financed by the European Union, France, Belgium, Sweden and Italy, and designed for permanent observation of the continental biosphere. On board SPOT, VEGETATION will provide a decisive advance in comparison with AVHRR, thanks to its capacity for medium resolution repetitive global coverage (1 km), to the improved atmospheric corrections (blue and mid-infrared bands) and to the simultaneous observation capacity at medium and high resolution which makes it possible to use it together with the HRVIR instrument. The data from <A HREF="../polder/Description.html">POLDER</A> on ADEOS and from VEGETATION on SPOT-4 will also be combinable to improve the atmospheric corrections, filter the angular effects or to provide complementary contributions to the characterization of vegetation. <P>

Many airborne surveys have been organized to study the processes, define and prepare the use of future satellites and carry out analyses at the scale of the grid of climate models. They utilize the airborne sensors VARAN, PORTOS, POLDER and ISM installed on the ARAT aircraft as well as other data which are accessible within the framework of international cooperation.  <P>

The <A HREF="/polder/Mission2.html">POLDER</A> on ADEOS program is an initial Franco-Japanese space cooperation in the field of the Earth and Environmental sciences. The POLDER instrument is a wide viewing imaging polarimeter radiometer designed for the ADEOS japanese mission which will be launched in 1996 and which collect, during at least three years and over the whole globe, observations of solar radiation reflected by clouds, aerosols and marine or continental surfaces. Thanks to an original instrument concept, POLDER will be the first space instrument to simultaneously observe the polarization and the multi-spectral and directional signatures of reflected radiation. Its observations will make it possible to reach certain physical-optical characteristics of aerosols and clouds, to observe oceanic phytoplankton, the continental biosphere, the directional distribution of short wave radiation as well as the water vapor content.<P>

French research work concerning dynamics, physico-chemistry of the stratosphere and the mesosphere remains centered on the study of the processes of ozone destruction, the chemical-dynamic inter-actions, the troposphere-stratosphere exchanges as well as on the analysis of trends and balances at regional and global scale. For observation, it relies on stratospheric balloons, instrument equipped aircraft and space systems, the combination of which is necessary to study the complex processes and the mechanisms of inter-actions and of integration of scales. These activities complete France's contribution to ESA's ENVISAT-1 programme. <P>

The balloon programme is based on a set of vehicles and operational services developed and operated by CNES. The Open stratospheric balloons (Bso), capable of carrying multi-instrumented gondola weighing 500 kg, are widely used for short duration flights, while the infrared Montgolfieres (MIR) have shown their ability to fly 50 kg instrumented gondolas during more than 60 days above convective tropical zones with vertical displacements, sufficient for the study of troposphere-stratosphere exchanges. These facilities and services are made available to the international scientific community, on a commercial basis which make it possible to ensure their permanence and their evolution. In this way, many Bso launches by CNES have widely contributed to the success of the European Union's European Arctic Stratospheric Ozone Experiment (EASOE) and to that of the French component of the UARS correlative measurement programme. The MIR have also made it possible to study the water vapor flux between the equatorial stratosphere and troposhere.  <P>

A long duration, international scope balloon survey, STRATEOLE is also in Phase B. Its goal is to study the stratospheric dynamic-chemical inter-actions, associated with the Antarctic polar vortex, using 200 high pressure drifting balloons, traveling at two different altitudes (70 hPa and 50 hPa) at the periphery and within the vortex. The payload of these balloons will be composed of 10 kg gondolas equipped with miniaturized instruments for position determination and measuring pressure, temperature, wind and minor constituents including ozone. During the survey, planned for the year 2000, the balloon observations will be combined with the profiles of constituents, aerosols and temperature produced by ENVISAT and with digital models, in order to follow a complete cycle of the evolution of the Antarctic vortex. STRATEOLE will make it possible to perform a large scale validation of the ENVISAT observations. <P>

The strictly space component of this programme is conducted within the framework of various cooperations. It concerns a set of instruments intended for the study of solar forcing, of the dynamics, thermodynamic structure and constituents in the stratosphere. The SPECSOL spectrometer, developed by two laboratories, the Service d'A&eacute;ronomie (SA) and the IASB and flown several times in the ATLAS and EURECA missions, characterizes the variability of the UV solar spectrum. <A HREF ="../uars/descript.html#Windii">WINDII</A>, a Canadian-French interferometer, measures temperature and wind profiles in the stratosphere and mesosphere on board UARS. In the field of stratospheric chemistry, CNES and the French community are concentrating their efforts on occultation techniques, by participating in the France-belgium (GRILLE on ATLAS) and Belgium-France-Russia (MIRAS on MIR) infrared spectrometry experiments and in the United States <A HREF ="../poam/Mission.html">POAM-2</A> experiment carried on SPOT-3. <P>

In parallel, the study of the tropospheric chemistry is growing considerably from the theoritical and experimental point of view, with, particularly, research accompanying the development of the IASI infrared spectrometer. <P>

The laser reflecting satellite, STELLA, was launched by ARIANE at the end of 1993, to accompany SPOT-3, on an orbit selected to complete the coverage of STARLETTE, which is still operational. Its data are used to study the terrestrial gravity field and kinematics. The DORIS programme, thanks to the centimetric coherence of the earliest DORIS measurements obtained on SPOT-2 and  <A HREF="/topex/Mission.html">TOPEX-POSEIDON </A>and the homogeneous global coverage of the ground network of beacons makes it possible to study the relative movements of the plates as a whole, and to improve the gravity field on a large scale. The <A HREF="/doris/Mission.html">DORIS</A> system is also used on SPOT for a positioning mission whose development will be continuing on future SPOT (4 and 5) beyond the conclusive experiments conducted as part of SPOT 2&3 missions. Thanks to an evolution on the DORIS system, it is planned to perform, on <A HREF="/tp-follow/Mission.html">TOPEX-POSEIDON FOLLOW-ON (TPFO)</A>, from a higher altitude orbit, a still more accurate position determination mission in order to study lithospheric deformations. <P>

Synthetic Aperture  Radar (SAR) images acquired before and after the earthquakes (M = 7.3) by the <A HREF="http://gds.esrin.esa.it:80/">European ERS-1</A> satellite were analyzed by interferometry to measure the coseismic surface displacement field over an area of 100 km by 250 km. <P>

After removing effects due to topography and orbits, the residual fringes depict changes in the ground surface between the acquisition times of the two images. <P>

This approach provides a denser sampling than surveying methods and a better precision than previous space imaging techniques. <P>

This new geodetic technique can detect centimetre-sized changes in the ground surface. The accuracy of the measurement is better than 4 cm in range, based on comparisons with ground surveys. <P>

For a pair of images taken before and after the earthquake, the interferogram shows clear lobes with long axes oriented approximately 45&#176; from the fault trace, consistent with predictions of an elastic dislocation <A HREF="model_landers.html">model</A>. <P>

Interferometric combination of pairs of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired by the <A HREF="http://gds.esrin.esa.it:80/">ERS-1 satellite</A> before and after the Eureka Valley, California earthquake of May 17 1993 (M = 6.1), maps the coseismic deformation field. <P>

The fringes corresponding to contours of equal change in satellite-to-groung distance can be enhanced by forming the sum of two of such interferograms with altitudes of ambiguity roughly equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. <P>

The resulting composite interferogram reveals some 10 cm of change in range indicating a coseismic deepening of the Eureka Valley graben. <P>

<H1>ETNA : Volcano deflation monitored by spaceborne radar interferometry</H1>

<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

Spaceborne radar interferometry can be used to monitor long-term volcano deformation. Two families of Synthetic Aperture Radar images, acquired from ascending and descending orbits by the <A HREF="http://gds.esrin.esa.it:80/">satellite ERS-1</A>, and looking at mount Etna from opposite sides, cover the time period from May 17 1992 to October 24 1993, and include the second half of Etna's most recent eruption. <P>

With the interferometric technique, a volcano-wide deflation has been observed, which is an expected consequence of the eruption, but which had not previously been appreciated. The <A HREF="etnamodl.html">modelled deformation</A>, based on the change of pressure in a sphere located in an elastic half-space, increases linearly with time until the end of the eruption. <P>

Examples of interferograms showing the subsidence of the volcano at different stages : <P>

</CENTER>

The longer the time between image acquisition the larger the deflation, expressed by the number of fringes. The first figure shows less than 1 fringe. The last figure shows up to 5 fringes. Artefact structure due to atmospheric heterogeneity can be seen. Noisy areas occured where the conditions for surface preservation between data acquisition were not met, mainly due to vegetation or climate changes. <P>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/icones/back8.gif">
<H1>ScaRaB Data Processing Center</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

The ScaRaB Ground Segment joins two principal centers : The telemetry receiving and the remote control sending in Obninsk, Russia; the data processing and the instrumental programming at the CST. The communications between those two principal centers are made through a specialized and multi-projects connection installed by the "telematique" Division between the CNES and Moscow. The french part of the ground Segment is composed of three main systems "delocalized" which exchange necessary informations to progressively build more and more elaborated scientific products (data files).<P>

<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

The Ground Segment is composed of three main systems :
<UL>
 <LI> <STRONG>The Control and Survey Ground Segment</STRONG> (SSCS) which assure the operational missions in almost real time (in about 24 hours):
 <UL>
  <LI> The receiving and the setting of the scentific and constraints telemetry, the orbital reports and the informations of time adjustments.
  <LI> The survey of technological parameters (lamps and calibration black bodies), memories, control mechanisms.
  <LI> The instrumental operating mode control (programmation),here again, essentialy for onboard calibration domain.
  <LI> The decommutation, geographical localization of the measures and first level data production for the usable raw data.
 </UL><P>

 <LI> <STRONG>The Processing, Distribution and Archiving Ground Segment</STRONG> (SSEV) which offers, with a little longer time span :
 <UL>
  <LI> The realization of upper level data products, in "luminance" (level 1b), in flux after spectral corrections and geophysical transformations (level 2) and space-time averages, on eventually several onboard instruments (level 3).
  <LI> The centralized archiving of all the processing chain products and their access or their distribution to the whole scientific community involved.
 </UL><P>

 <LI> <STRONG>The Calibration and Validation Ground Segment</STRONG> (SSTDA) is the system specialized in calibration (transformation of the raw data in physical "luminance") and the validation which generates coefficients for level 1b products computation. It needs a precise knowledge based on an onboard calibration technology with different lamps, black bodies and filters.
</UL><P>

<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

From the data processing point of vue, the ScaRaB Ground Segment is a shared system which divides the different centers (operational for the SSCS, valuation for the  SSEV, computation and data conservation for the SSTDA) and based on various technologies (commercial-off-the-shelf <EM>Probe</EM> for the survey, <EM>Ingres and Oracle Data Base Managers, Files Transfert and Archiving Service</EM> and CD-ROM for the distribution).<P>

<H2>Overall organization of  the POLDER on ADEOS Ground Segment</H2>

The ADEOS Ground Segment is responsible for command and control of the ADEOS Satellite telemetry acquisition, orbit control and restitution and processing of raw sensor data into level 0 data. Its NASDA/EOC component in charge of data acquisition and processing into level 0 data, delivers POLDER level 0 data to the CNES POLDER Ground Segment. <P>

The POLDER Ground Segment is located in CNES, Toulouse. <P>

It generates POLDER commands and delivers them to the NASDA/TACC element of the ADEOS Ground Segment for uplinking to ADEOS.  <P>

The CNES POLDER Ground Segment processes POLDER level 0 data into POLDER Standard Products. Such products are distributed by the CNES POLDER Ground Segment and the ADEOS Data Center to the worldwide user community. <P>

<A HREF="/images/Ground_segm1.gif">POLDER/ADEOS Ground Segment environment</A> <P>

<H2>Basic functions and architecture of the CNES POLDER Ground Segment</H2>

The CNES POLDER Ground Segment is made up of three components :
<UL>

Dynamical processes have a profound effect upon the chemical composition of the upper atmosphere. The high-altitude distribution of chemical species-including ozone and the source molecules, free radicals, and reservoir/sink molecules that enter into ozone reaction chains - therefore cannot be understood through photochemical studies alone. Conversely, the processes of upper-atmosphere dynamics are higly sensitive to variations in chemical composition, being driven by solar heating of the ozone layer as well as by the upward propagation of energy from the troposphere.<P>

Upper atmosphere winds can be measured directly by ground-based radars and lidars and by balloon-and rocket-borne sounding instruments. Such techniques permit study of small-scale dynamical processes and long-term monitoring of atmospheric dynamics over fixed deployment sites; however, they are intrinsically limited to a few geographic locations. For investigations of the global-scale dynamical processes that determine the distribution of ozone and other upper-atmosphere constituent, satellite data are required.<P>

<H2><A NAME="description">Instrument description</A></H2>

POAM II is composed of three subsystems :  <P>
<OL>
<LI> An optical head housing nine telescopes each of which has an aperture defining a common field-of-view, a narrow-band interference filter, and a detector. The telescopes are coaligned and mounted on a gimbal with sufficient movement in elevation and azimuth so that they can be pointed at the sun at sunrise and sunset.
<LI> An electronic module which controls the optical head, collects and stores the data from these sensors, processes the commands, and controls all equipment operations.
<LI> A telemetry subsystem which transmits data to the the ground through a filter and a antenna

<H2><A NAME="objectives">Mission Objectives</A></H2>

Odin is a dual purpose project dedicated to the study of both astronomical objects and the Earth's atmosphere. The Odin Payload is a common resource and approximately half of the available spacecraft time shall be used for each scientific discipline. <P>

<A HREF="#TOP"> Back to index </A><P>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

<H2><A NAME="experiment">Aeronomy experiment</A></H2>

Odin will be used to infer the abundance and spatial distributions of important atmospheric species such as water vapour, chlorine monoxide, ozone, molecular oxygen, mitrogen and hydrogen compounds as well as atmospheric aerosol particles. A limb scanning mode will be employed between 15 and 120 km to observe spectral signatures in the mm, submm and ultraviolet-near infrared wavelength regions of the spectrum. Odin will be the first aeronomy satellite to perform spectroscopic measurements at submm wavelengths and will be operationnal during a period when a serious lack of satellite surveillance of the Earth's atmophere is expected to exist. <P>

<A HREF="#TOP"> Back to index </A><P>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

<H2><A NAME="payload">Payload composition</A></H2>

The payload will comprise a heterodyne radiometer system and a spectrograph with an ultraviolet near infraed spectroscopy capability. The radiometer is fed by a 1.1 m telescope and will be used for both the astronomy and aeronomy parts of the mission. <P>
By designing the radiometer to have a frequency coverage of approximately 118.25 - 119.25 GHz, 486 - 502 Ghz and 541 - 579 Ghz it can fulfill the rquirements of both scientific disciplines. The receiver will be equipped with one acusto-optical and two hybrid correlator spectrometers. The maximum instantaneous banswidth is 1 Ghz. There will be two selectable frequency resolutions, 1 Mhz and 150 Khz, respectively. <P>
The ultraviolet-near infrard spectrograph will only used for the aeronomy observations. The design assumes as a goal a wavelength coverage between 200 - 800 nm, 1.19 - 1.39 &#181;m and 1.43 - 1.60 &#181;m. The resolving power is assumed to be between 55 and 900. <P>

<H1>Polder Instrument And Mission Concept Description</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

The POLDER instrument concept is based on wide-field-of-view telecentric optics, a rotating wheel carrying spectral and polarizing filters and a charged coupled device (CDD) detector array. With its aperture of 43&#176; along-track, 51&#176; across-track and 57&#176; in the diagonal, the instantaneous field of view of the optics intercepts a two-dimensional Earth scene imaged and partitioned into 244 x 274 elementary pixels by the CCD matrix. This geometry produces a swath width of about 2400 km, allowing for near-complete daily coverage of the Earth, while the arrangement of the CCD matrix pixels yields a quasi-constant horizontal resolution throughout the swath, only distorted by Earth curvature and equal to 6 x 7 km2 at nadir. <P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/images/p9824.gif"></CENTER><P>

Multi-angle viewing is achieved by the along-track migration at spacecraft velocity of the two dimensional field of view, as illustrated on the following schema. Thus, over a single pass any target within the instrument swath can be observed quasi-simultaneously under up to 13 different viewing angles. Combining multi-pass observations obtained at short time intervals in taking advantage of the 4 day quasi-subcycle of the ADEOS orbit allows a more complete sampling of the bidirectional reflectance and polarization distribution functions (BRDF and BPDF). On the other hand, the polarization and multispectral capability is produced the rotation of the filter/polarizer wheel. The selection of the fifteen filters mounted on the wheel, determined by mission requirements, results in POLDER's capacity to observe reflectances in eight narrow spectral bands of the visible and near infrared spectrum and, for three of these channels, respectively centred on 443, 670 and 865 nm, at three different polarization angles 60 degrees apart. A sixteenth, opaque filter is mounted on the wheel for frequent measurements of the CCD dark current and control of its stability. <P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/images/p8623.gif"></CENTER><P>


The list hereafter displays the characteristics of POLDER spectral bands. High and low limits of the dynamic range correspond to worst case saturation (considering that both the sun and the sensor are aligned at zenith) and to the minimal observable reflectances (molecular scattering only) respectively. <P>

In order to accommodate both the large dynamic range required by the observation of clouds and the high radiometric sensitivity needed at low signal level for the ocean colour mission, short and long integration/exposure times are interleaved as a result of the optimisation of the CCD reading sequence, leading to a Noise equivalent Differential Reflectance (NeDR) increasing from 10E-4 at low reflectance values up to about 10E-3 for a reflectance of 1. All spectral channels from 670 to 910 nm have dual dynamics/sensitivity. 

An accuracy of 2 % and 3 % is targeted for the estimation of the calibration coefficient for shorter (< 565 nm) and longer (> 565 nm) wavelengths respectively, while a 1 % accuracy is expected for the interband calibration coefficient. These error budgets are considered within reach of a calibration approach based on both pre-launch calibration with an integrating sphere and on in-flight, external calibration based on modelling and observation of reference Earth targets of known reflectance signatures. A pre-launch POLDER-OCTS intercalibration procedure is also planned, with an expected accuracy of 2 %. <P>
POLDER observations are acquired continuously in the sun-illuminated part of the orbit, for solar zenith angles lower than 75&#176; with respect to nadir viewing. This implies that the geographic zones observed by POLDER change according to the season. <P>

<H1>THE MEDIAS INITIATIVE</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>
Coordination between the participating research groups within the Mediterranean Basin (MEDI) and Subtropical Africa (AS) is being implemented through a Regional Research Network called MEDIAS.
The main goal of the MEDIAS Network is to promote appropriate interdisciplinary studies that address global environmental issues, and to develop data distribution, modelling, training, synthesis of results and dialogue with the socio-economic world, on a cooperative basis at regional scale.
<P>
MEDIAS objectives and plans have been discussed at the first MEDIAS Meeting held in Toulouse (France) in February 1992, attended by about 120 participants from twenty-five countries throughout the region.
An International Pilot Committee for the MEDIAS Network has been established. At the workshop "Africa and Global Change" held in Niamey (Niger) in November 1992, MEDIAS was further encouraged to play a coordinating role for MED and NAF.
At the French level, a Regional Research Centre, linked to the MEDIAS Network, has been created in order to impulse the MED Network and to contribute to the coordination of the Network activities of both MED and NAF regions.
Six institutions (CLS, <A HREF="http://www.cnes.fr/Welcome.html">CNES</A>, <A HREF="http://www.meteo.fr/">METEO-FRANCE</A>, <A HREF="http://www.orstom.fr/">ORSTOM</A>, SPOT-IMAGE, and Toulouse University), working in close collaboration with CNRS laboratories and <A HREF="http://www.cerfacs.fr/">CERFACS</A>, are joining in a public, non-profit corporation, headquartered in Toulouse, called MEDIAS-FRANCE. 
Moreover the Commission of European Communities (CEC) is developing the ENRICH (European Network for Research In global Change) initiative to improve coordination in this respect between CEC, Central and Eastern Europe, Africa and other developing countries.
The MEDIAS Network provides a framework to ENRICH for research and training with particular focus on Mediterranean and African needs. <P>

<TITLE>Research priorities of MEDIAS</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/icones/back8.gif">
<H1>Research priorities of MEDIAS</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

The regions involved in the MEDIAS Network include all those countries that border on the Mediterranean sea and embracing almost all of Africa north of the equator. The specificity of these areas results from the conjunction of three factors: wide range of marginal zones extremely sensitive to climatic variability and subject to possible migration shift; pronouced meridional gradient from the equatorial rain forests to Sahara through the sub-Saharan savannah woodlands and the Sahel; and series of severe periodic droughts with concomitant human suffering.
<BR>
The scientific challenge of global change is to develop our predictive understanding of the regional relationships between the three basic components of the global environmental systems, that are the physical climate system, the biogeochemical cycles and the social processes.
<P>

<IMG SRC="/images/plaket21.gif"><P>

<H3> Atmospheric, oceanographic and land studies.</H3>

Priorities of atmospheric studies deal with the water cycle - availability and storage, dynamic of rainfall and drought, partitioning of energy on Earth - and with the chemical composition of the atmosphere, both strongly influenced by biological processes and human action. <P>
Oceanographic studies in the framework of MEDIAS focus on Mediterranean sea and the Tropical Atlantic, with a view  to investigate the complex biological and chemical processes that regulate the oceanic transport and transformation of carbon. The overall aim is also to develop a capacity to predict on a regional scale the response of these processes to anthropogenic perturbations (increasing man-made CO2 emissions, riverine sediment discharge, marine pollution), in particular those related to climate change. The land environment has also been identified as of highest and immediate priority for understanding the effects of changes in climate, atmospheric composition and land use on terrestrial ecosystems, and for determining feedback effects to the physical climate system. Particular concerns include soil erosion, sand-hill migration and expansion or contraction of the Sahara desert boundaries, aerosol climatology, African savannah fires which produce as much as one third of the total global emissions from biomass burning, land-cover and urbanisation or pest control.<P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/images/plaket22.gif"><P>

<H3> Human dimension.</H3>

A fully comprehensive study of global change need to integrate the human dimension to improve our understanding of both human-induced and naturally-induced drivers and their impacts. Social sciences priorities focus on six components which interact among themselves and with the global environmental processes : fund of knowledge and experience, preferences and expectations (cultural constraints), factors of production and technology (including resources), population and social structure (demography), economic systems, and political system and institutions. Research programmes are being developed to advance knowledge on the socio-economic causes and impacts of global change as MEDIAS include heavily populated regions subject to a long history of extensive land use. <P>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/icones/back8.gif">
<H1>THE INTERNATIONAL GEOSPHERE BIOSPHERE PROGRAMME</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>
Established in 1986, the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme: A Study of Global Change is aimed at "describing and understanding the interactive physical, chemical, and biological processes that regulate the total earth system, the unique environment it provides for life, the changes that are occuring in the system, and the manner in which they are influenced by human action".
<P>
The IGBP has developed a set of linked core projects to investigate the life-driven interactions within and between the land, atmosphere and ocean components of the Earth system. The fundamental issue is that humankind is altering, in ways that are not well understood, virtually all the systems and cycles that together make life possible on Earth. Major environmental problems such as greenhouse gas warming, depletion of stratospheric ozone, reduction in species diversity, deforestation and desertification are of particular concern.
<P>
The IGBP along with its international companion programmes WCRP (World Climate Research Programme) and HDP (Human Dimension Programme) address the dynamic and transdisciplinary nature of the Earth system which requires integrating research approaches between natural and social sciences. <P>

The general objectives are to determine the long term trends for the main climatic parameters in the region, to gather the necessary input or validation data for numerical models, and to validate space observations. Measurements of atmospheric chemistry (e.g., tropospheric ozone, precipitation), radiation and aerosols are among the first priorities.

<H1>THE START PROJECT</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>
A worldwide fieldwork programme and research network are required to achieve these goals, involving scientists from all nations. There is a critical need to stimulate research which focus on regional origins and implications of global change and to promote interdisciplinary studies on a regional basis.
<BR>
The <A HREF="geobio.html">IGBP</A> SysTem for Analysis, Research and Training (START) provides the necessary structure of networks, centres and sites to address the regional aspects of global change. It also provides training, to strengthen the much-needed participation of developing countries in IGBP research. Regional Research Networks should progressively be established in each of the 13 regions which have been defined as a primary basis in terms of scientific needs, biogeographical features and existing regional collaborations.
<BR>
An important effort in developing START activities is being directed at the Mediterranean (MED) and Northern Africa (NAF) region. These are currently subject to strong interannual climate variability, and could be severely impacted by further shifts in climate patterns. <P>

<H1>DATA MANAGEMENT</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>
The crucial role of data and information systems and the importamce of data management methodologies in support of global change research are now clearly recognised. The large variety of types and sources of global, regional, and local data needs to strengthen data management programme and accessibility, to extend database directory, and to foster data exchange.<BR>

Information distribution facilities to the MEDIAS research community are being implemented (MEDIAS Newsletter, electronic mail) and data bases (e.g <A HREF="http://www.orstom.fr/hapex/index.html">Hapex-Sahel</A>, pilot sites, climate data series) are implemented. <P>

<H1>TRAINING ACTIVITIES</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>
The MEDIAS Regional Research Network will provide a regional focus for training in interdisciplinary environmental science. This will be achieved through fellowships, short courses, workshops and seminars, exchange programmes, and "mobile" international school, closely linked to existing higher education establishment. Two international summer Schools have been organised in France and Spain in 1992 with MEDIAS support. The first International MEDIAS Winter School took place in Niamey (Niger) in December 1993, coordinated with the African Centre of Meteorological Applications for Development (ACMAD), ICRISAT, AGRHYMET, EAMAC, and several Niger institutions (METEO-NIGER, University of Niamey, National IGBP Committee). The second one is planned for February 1995 in Nairobi (Kenya). The organisation of numerical modelling training sessions are also planned on a regular basis in collaboration with regional and national structures.<P>

<H1>The CNES SeaWIFS Data and Information Service</H1>

<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

The objective of the CNES SeaWIFS Data and Information Service consists in acting as the unique interface between the <A HREF="http://seawifs.gsfc.nasa.gov:80/SEAWIFS.html">GSFC/DAAC</A> that archives all SeaWIFS products derived from the NASA/GSFC ground segment processing, and the french scientists selected as PIs or CoIs by <A HREF="http://seawif.gsfc.nasa.gov:80/SEAWIFS.html">NASA</A> in the frame of the NASA announcement of opportunity. It is thus a restricted access service. It will help the selected scientists to get the data they need for their scientific investigation and will set up a long term reference central archive.<P>

The CNES SeaWIFS data and Information Service should be active 10 years after the end of the nominal lifetime of the SeaWIFS space segment. Thus, it will help selected scientists to jointly use SeaWIFS data with data from other orbiting space sensors.<P>

<H1> SPOT CONCEPT</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

<P>In its initial design as well as in its long term planning, the SPOT programme concept is based upon the continuity of service to users worldwide.</P>
<P><A HREF="http://www.spotimage.fr/anglaise/system/s_syst.htm">SPOT 1</A> is beeing in service since February 1986, followed by SPOT 2 in January 1990 and SPOT 3 in September 1993.</P>
<P><A HREF="http://www.spotimage.fr/anglaise/system/future/sf_spot4.htm">SPOT 4</A> with improved capabilities (middle infra red band) and the <A HERF="http://www-projet.cnes.fr:8050">Vegetation Instrument</A> onboard is planned to be launched mid-1998. <A HREF="http://www.spotimage.fr/anglaise/system/future/sf_spot5.htm">SPOT 5</A> will be a completely new designed satellite with improved ground resolution and continuous stereoscopy, to be launched begining of next century.<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/spot2.gif"></CENTER><P>

<P>The SPOT satellites' two viewing instruments (HRVS) when operated simultaneously in the vertical viewing configuration are capable of imaging a 117 km wide strip on the Earth's surface. Both HRVS are fitted with programmable Strip Selection Mirrors giving access, off track, to areas within a 950 km wide corridor. This specific oblique viewing capability greatly increases the frequency at which the satellite can revisit a particular site (4 to 11 times within the 26 day cycle, according to latitude).</P>
<P>Consequently stereopairs, used for relief perception and elevation plotting (Digital Elevation Modelling) are formed from two SPOT images acquired at different viewing angles on successive satellite passes.</P>
<P>A single SPOT scene covers a geographical area of 60 x 60 km.Two alternative modes of imaging are possible : </P>
<UL>
<LI> Panchromatic, black and white, with a ground resolution of 10 m which makes SPOT data the most advanced system in terms of image resolution as features as small as 10 m in size on the ground are detected. This complies with mapping at scale up to 1/50000.<P>
<LI> Multispectral, colour, with 20 m ground resolution acquired simultaneously in 3 bands : green, red and near infrared.
</UL>
<P>SPOT key features such as ground resolution, repeat registration, acquisition programming and stereo capabilities makes the system the current most advanced programme to acquire up to date geographic information.
</P>
<P>Many operational applications in a variety of domains ranging from Earth sciences to economic planning and decision making takes benefits of SPOT data : vegetation, agriculture, forestry, soils, geology, erosion, oil and mineral exploration, water resources, urban and rural planning, civil engineering, development projects, or environmental monitoring.

<H1>TOPEX/POSEIDON: Mission Objectives</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

Using a state of the art Radar Altimetry system, TOPEX/POSEIDON aims at measuring the precise height of the sea-surface for studying the dynamics of the circulation of the world's ocean. The main science goal of the mission is to improve the knowledge of the global ocean circulation to an extent that will ultimately lead to improved understanding of the ocean's role in global climate change. Other applications include the ocean tides, geodesy and geodynamics, ocean waveheight, and wind speed.
<P>
To be useful for studying ocean circulation, especially at the gyre and basin scales, numerous improvements have been made in TOPEX/POSEIDON relative to previous altimetric systems, including specially designed satellite, sensor suite, satellite tracking systems, and orbit configuration, as well as the development of an optimal gravity model for precision orbit determination and a dedicated ground system for mission operations.<P>

The TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite
</H2></A>

The TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite is an adaptation by Fairchild Space of the existing Multimission Modular Spacecraft (MMS), which has successfully carried the payloads of the Solar Maximum Mission, Landsat 4 and Landsat 5. The MMS design was modified to meet the TOPEX/POSEIDON requirements.<BR>

The satellite carries 6 science instruments, 4 from NASA, 2 from CNES. A dual frequency radar altimeter (ALT, NASA), a TOPEX microwave radiometer (TMR, NASA), a Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA, NASA) and the Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS, CNES) dual Doppler tracking system receiver are the operational sensors. The single frequency solid-state radar altimeter (SSALT, CNES) and the Global Positioning System Demonstration Receiver (GPSDR, NASA) are the experimental ones.<BR>

The orbit configuration has been chosen to avoid undesirable aliased tidal frequencies such as 0, annual and semi-annual, and avoid that different tidal constituents be aliased to the same frequency. To satisfy these constraints and yet cover most of the world's ocean (~ 90%), an inclination of 66&#176; was selected. A repeat period of 9.916 days has been chosen to compromise best between spatial and temporal resolutions, resulting in a 316 km cross-track separation at the equator. Finally, a high orbit altitude was selected to maximise the accuracy of orbit determination, because of the reduced atmospheric drag and gravity forces acting on the satellite. The exact altitude that allows the orbit satisfy these constraints and fly over 2 verification sites located in the Mediterranean Sea (Lampedusa Island, Italy) and at the Harvest Platform (California, USA)  is 1336 km.<BR>

The TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite has a 2500 kg mass and is expected to have a 5 year lifetime. It has been launched in August 1992 with an european ARIANE 42P launcher.<P>

The TOPEX/POSEIDON Payload
</H2></A>

The ALT is the first spaceborne dual frequency altimeter. The measurements are made at 2 frequencies (5.3 and 13.6 GHz) and are combined to minimize the errors caused by the ionospheric free electrons. The ALT design is based on the previous SEASAT and GEOSAT altimeters with significant improvements including the 5.3 Ghz channel for the ionospheric measurement, a more precise height measurement and longer lifetime.<BR>
The TMR makes use of the measurement of sea-surface microwave emissivity at three frequencies (18, 21 and 37 GHz) to estimate the total water vapor content in the atmosphere. The 21 GHz is the primary channel for water vapor measurement. The 18 GHz and 37 GHz channels are respectively used to remove the effects of wind speed and cloud cover on the water vapor measurement.<BR>

The LRA is used with a network of Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) stations to provide satellite tracking data for precision orbit determination and calibration of the altimeter bias.<BR>

The DORIS system of CNES provides another type of satellite tracking data using microwave Doppler techniques. The system is composed with an onboard receiver and a network of ground transmitting beacons. These beacons provide a quasi-continuous tracking of the satellite. They are equipped with meteorological sensors measuring temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure to correct for the atmospheric effects on the transmitted signals. The DORIS signals are transmitted at 2 frequencies (401.25 and 2036.25 MHz) to allow the removal of the effects of the ionospheric free electrons on the tracking data.<BR>

The SSALT is a solid-state Ku-band (13.65 GHz) altimeter. It is a new technology low power, low weight altimeter.<BR>

The GPSDR receives signals from the GPS constellation. With a combination of the GPSDR data and a number of GPS receivers on the Earth's surface, precise tracking of the satellite is made possible by using the technique of Kalman filtering and differential ranging. <P>

Raw data from the two French instruments are extracted and transmitted daily to the french ground segment (SSDP) located in Toulouse. Within the SSDP is the DORIS - POSEIDON Control Centre, the CTDP, operated and run by CNES subsidiary CLS. The CTDP preprocesses the data, does the scientific processing, monitors the French instruments, and generates the work program and the commands. The DORIS Orbitography Department at CNES calculates the precise satellite ephemeris from the DORIS measurements.In parallel, data from the US instruments are processed at JPL. The two agencies exchange the processed informations. Then, each science investigator can access the whole data set from the mission thanks active archive centers located in the US (PO-DAAC, JPL) and France (AVISO, CNES).<P>

<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

To perform its missions of spacecraft orbit restitution and of ground beacons location, the DORIS system comprises an on-board package, a beacon network and a control and data processing center.<P>

The basic principle is based on the accurate measurement of the Doppler shift on radiofrequency signals emitted by ground beacons and received on board the spacecraft. Measurements are made on two frequencies, 2036.25 MHz for accurate Doppler measurement and 401.25 MHz for ionospheric correction. The 401.25 MHz frequency is also used for measurements time-tagging and auxiliary data transmission.<P>

Selection of an uplink system allows a fully automated operation of the beacons and easy communication links for the overall system, data being centralised through the satellite and its ground segment to the DORIS data processing center.<P>

Doris on-board equipment is presently flying on the SPOT2 and SPOT3 Earth observation satellites and TOPEX oceanography satellite, and is scheduled to fly on SPOT4 in 1998 and ENVISAT, SPOT5 and TOPEX Follow-on satellites.<P>

The ground segment is shared by all DORIS missions. The orbit determination beacons are deployed on a dense worldwide network. Installation and maintenance of the network is performed by the IGN (French national geographic institute). The time reference for the system is provided by the master beacons, located in Toulouse, France and in Kourou, French Guyana, which are connected to atomic clocks.<P>

For the point positioning mission of DORIS, specific ground location beacons are available and are installed according to different users need. They are field packaged and equipped with autonomous power supply.<P>

The control and data processing center is located in Toulouse, France, and operated by the CLS company.<P>

The Precise Orbit Determination is performed by a division of CNES.<P>

The system was originally designed to perform very precise orbit restitution of low Earth orbiting satellites, in support of the POSEIDON ocean altimetry experiment, providing an orbit altitude reference for radar altimeter data processing, with an accuracy goal of 10 cm or less on the radial component of the orbit. As such, it was embarked on the TOPEX satellite which was launched in August 1992, but it was also validated earlier in flight, on the SPOT2 Earth observation satellite, launched in February 1990. This precise orbit determination requires a certain amount of processing of the measurements performed by the DORIS on-board package, with a software model of a certain number of parameters. The orbit data is available within 1 month, the delay resulting mainly from external data availability (solar flux, earth rotation parameters).<P>

As far as the Precise Orbit Determination (POD) is concerned, operational computation has been performed on SPOT2 data since January 1992, TOPEX data since September 1992 and SPOT3 (launched in September 1993) data since October 1993. Thanks to the very good coverage of the orbit determination beacons network, which increases with the spacecraft orbit altitude, the amount of data acquired daily is very important. Moreover, data production is very reliable, the TOPEX precise orbit having been produced 100 % of the time since the beginning of the mission.<P>

For DORIS on SPOT satellites, only internal criteria can be used, for the orbit restitution quality assessment, such as residuals after orbit restitution and comparisons of solutions with overlapping data. For DORIS on TOPEX, external criteria can be used, on top of the previous ones, such as comparison of the POD performed by CNES with DORIS data and performed by NASA-GSFC with SLR, or altimetric crossovers. All these results show that the radial accuracy of precise orbit restitution using the DORIS system is in the order of 2 to 3 centimeters with DORIS/TOPEX data and 5 to 6 cm with DORIS/SPOT data, well within the 10 cm accuracy goal that was set initially for the system.<P>

Other analysis have been performed also by groups outside of CNES, using DORIS data, which also demonstrate very good performance (Willis et al, 1994 ; Tapley et al, 1993).<P>

The DORIS control and data processing center provides an operational orbit with a 20 cm RMS accuracy on the radial component within 48 hours, also well within the 1 meter accuracy design goal.<P>

The on-board package provides, at the interface with the spacecraft, an orbit calculated in real time, computed by a navigation software designed to an accuracy goal of 25 meters RMS 3D. This may typically be of interest for other instruments or experiments on-board the spacecraft that need the provision of an orbit in such a class of accuracy. This feature has been incorporated in the DORIS receiver to fly with the SPOT4 satellite in 1998, and has been tested on ground with SPOT2 and SPOT3 data. It shows very good performance when compared to the precise orbit calculated with the same data, the 4 meters accuracy results being well within the design goal of 25 m RMS.<P>

Similar measurements can be performed to determine the location of a ground beacon for point positioning, whether it is a beacon of the permanent network or a dedicated location beacon.<P>

Location of ground beacons is performed either by a quasi-geometric method using the precise orbit ephemeris and measurements over the considered beacon, or by a dynamical method using the whole set of measurements and estimation of beacon locations as well as orbit and dynamical parameters. This enables high accuracy absolute or relative location.<P>

The worldwide coverage of the system makes it most suitable for monitoring of natural phenomena such as continental drift, sea level, earth rotation. The good accuracy, the field packaging of the location beacons and the fact that the system is centralised, which enables automated operation of the location beacons, even for long durations, and does without the usual significant cost for data communications, are all important points that make DORIS a very useful tool for precise geodesy and monitoring of glaciers, landslides, volcanoes, construction sites, tectonic plates...<P>

A positioning service, based on dedicated location beacons, is offered by CLS (Collecte et Localisation par Satellite) a CNES subsidiary in Toulouse, France, which also operates the ARGOS search and rescue system. It includes rent of equipment, installation help, personnel training, maintenance, processing and archiving, reporting. Location of the beacons of the permanent network is performed by several groups for scientific purposes : GRGS (Groupe de Recherche en G&eacute;od&eacute;sie Spatiale), IGN (Institut G&eacute;ographique National), University of Texas.<P>

Depending on the processing strategy of the data, several classes of accuracy can be achieved. The service offered by CLS achieves the performances quoted in fig. 1, with respect to the ITRF international reference, for absolute location. For relative location, performances are given in fig. 2 for 26 days of observation. This service has already been applied in geodesy to the determination of a point coordinates, e.g. for a 2 GHz satellite ground station or for airport equipment, for the tying in of a local geodetic network to a reference network, for the determination of a geodetic network itself. In geophysics, it has been or is being used for local tectonic monitoring, geodynamics applications, seismology, glaciology, vulcanology. It has also been used for landslide monitoring.<P>

Based on the good stability of the location of the beacons of the DORIS permanent network, and on the fact that the latter covers the nine major lithospheric plates, velocity solutions enable to derive global plate motions. Fig. 5 shows the relative velocities of 331 interplate baselines based on three years of DORIS data on SPOT2, SPOT3 and TOPEX/POSEIDON for 28 beacons on 8 plates, as compared with the NUVEL1-A model predictions for global plate motions. The correlation of 0.975 is quite impressive.<P>

The DORIS system has been used also for polar motion determination. Fig. 8 shows the polar motion from 1990 to 1994, clusters of points representing the DORIS data. It can be seen that the correlation is very good and that it even increases with the availability of DORIS/TOPEX data in addition to DORIS/SPOT2 data from mid-1992, and again with DORIS/SPOT3 data from end 1993.<P>

<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><P>
<H2>MODELS</H2>
Due to the fact that processing of DORIS data calls for use of mathematical models for physical forces involved, such models as Earth gravity field model, geo&iuml;dmodel, ionosphere model and air drag models can be improved implicitly.<P>

<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><P>
<H2>SYSTEM EVOLUTIONS AND OTHER APPLICATIONS</H2>
The DORIS system will be used as a new technique in the international Earth Reference System (IERS). DORIS data, which is already processed by several groups around the world, will be even more abundant in the future since a DORIS receiver will be part of the European Space Agency (ESA) ENVISAT satellite payload complement, and since the data produced during that mission will be part of the ENVISAT science data base.<P>

Evolutions currently under development to make the present system and its performances even more attractive include : self programming of the on-board instrument, using the on-board calculated orbit data,in view of autonomous navigation ; self initialisation of the on-board orbit determination software ; improvement of on-board orbit determination accuracy, with a 1 meter objective ; processing two channels (and therefor two beacons) simultaneously in the on-board instrument, which would enable to have one channel dedicated to precise orbit determination and the other to precise location for example ; provision of datation on board of the carrier satellite with respect to UTC.<P>

Moreover, the DORIS results have justified the will to perpetuate the system and the service it provides, taking into account potential new applications with increased performance requirements such as : navigation for satellite cluster colocation, constellation management or GEO satellite control, autonomous satellite navigation and even control, satellite to satellite tracking, time transfer, ground clocks comparison, ground beacon position determination on-board of the satellite, attitude determination, ... This is leading CNES to study new developments with an objective of reduction of the DORIS on-board package in term of mass, volume, cost, by using MMIC and digital signal processing technology, with the possibility to add a spread spectrum ranging capability to the system.<P>

<H1>Wind Imaging Interferometer</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>
Wind Imaging Interferometer WINDII provides direct observations of wind velocity through measurements of the Doppler shifts of selected emission and absorption lines. These shifts are measured in two different directions, yielding two components of the wind velocity relative to the spacecraft; the true wind velocity can then calculated from the observing geometry and a knowledge of the spacecraft velocity. The spacecraft motion combined with vertical scanning by the instruments produces a three-dimensional global map of the upper-atmosphere wind field. <P>

Since atmospheric emission and absorption characteristics vary strongly with altitude, a number of atomic and molecular spectral features must be used to obtain a wide range of altitudes. Moreover, the Doppler shift that arises from spacecraft motion must be separated from the shifts caused by atmospheric motions. High spectral resolution and a stable observing platform are required. <P>

The Wind Imaging Interferometer utilizes emission lines for the basic Doppler-shift measurements. In addition to lines of neutral and ionized atomic oxygen, these include two lines of the OH molecule and a molecular-oxygen line. WINDII obtains measurements both day and night at altitudes above 80 km. <P>

The WINDII spectral filter is a high-resolution michelson interferometer. The instrument consists of a telescope, the interferometer, and a detector array. The telescope views 45&#176; and 135&#176; from the spacecraft velocity vector simultaneously. In normal operation, the detector provides a vertical resolution of about 4 km and a horizontal resolution of some 20 km. Wind velocity accuracy within 10 m/sec is expected in the altitude range between 80 and 300 km. <P>

<H1>ScaRaB Science: Radiation Budget, Nebulosity, Climate</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

<H2>Radiation Budget</H2>
It is the difference between :
<UL>
<LI> the part of the incident solar radiation (short waves) absorbed by the Earth and its atmosphere, which warms it,<BR>
<LI> the thermal infrared radiation (long waves) sent back in space, which cools it.
</UL>
The mean radiation budget (on a global scale and annual period) is very near 0. But on short time scale, it is a function of latitude.

<H2>Nebulosity</H2>
<IMG SRC="/images/img_scar1.gif"> <P>
<IMG SRC="/images/img_scar2.gif"> <P>
Variations with time and space of radiation budget are dipending on various factors but in peculiar of nebulosity. <P>
A cloud reflects locally the incident solar radiation and decreases the absorption. On the other hand, a cloud creates locally a greenhouse effect and decreases the thermal radiation re emitted back towards space.  <P>
Nebulosity is a critical parameter in modelizing climatic evolution.
<P>
<H2>Climate</H2>
<IMG SRC="/images/result4_scarab.gif"><P>
The radiation budget variations drive global circulation of atmosphere and ocean but at the same time, give evidence of this circulation, which is a key of climate evolution.<P>

<A NAME="Cooperation"><H2>The First Cooperation with JAPAN</H2></A>

The regular increase in greenhouse gases due to anthropogenic emissions in the atmosphere may have a major impact on the Earth's climate in the forthcoming decades. In order to reduce the uncertainties in forecasting climatic changes, it is necessary to better understand the processes involved in interactions between aerosols, clouds, radiation and atmospheric circulation. Such interactions are poorly represented by current numerical models and there is a need to quantify their role in phenomena involved in the evolution of the climate system. <P>

Carbon dioxide uptake by the upper ocean and continental biosphere also constitutes a large element of uncertainty in climate models. Spaceborne sensors will play a key role in climate research by providing global, long term observations of parameters describing the state of the atmosphere and Earth surfaces. The French space agency, CNES, has therefore developed the POLDER (POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances) instrument, to be flown on <A HREF="http://hdsn.eoc.nasda.go.jp/guide/guide/satellite/satdata/adeos_e.html">ADEOS</A> (ADvanced Earth Observation Satellite), developed by the Japanese space agency, nasda. This is the first French/Japanese cooperative project in the area of Earth observation. <P>

A second, identical instrument is to be flown on ADEOS-2, successor to ADEOS, in 1999.<BR>
It will ensure the continuity of the POLDER mission over a significantly long period from a climate point of view. <P>

</TABLE> <P>

POLDER is a wide field of view imaging radiometer that will provide the first global, systematic measurements of spectral, directional and polarized characteristics of the solar radiation reflected by the Earth/atmosphere system. Its original observation capabilities open up new perspectives for discriminating the radiation scattered in the atmosphere from the radiation actually reflected by the surface. POLDER-acquired data will be processed in order to :
<UL>
- determine the physical and optical properties of aerosols so as to classify them and study their variability and cycle,<BR>
- improve the climatological description of certain physical, optical and radiative properties of clouds,<BR>
- precisely determine the influence of aerosols and clouds on the Earth's radiation budget,<BR>
- quantify the role of photosynthesis from the continental biosphere and oceans in the global carbon cycle.
</UL><P>
The scientific results from POLDER will contribute to the World Climate Research Programme and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme.<P>

The primary science objectives of &Oslash;RSTED are:
<UL>
<LI> the studies of the generation of the magnetic fields in the fluid core and the magnetic and electrical properties of the solid earth
<LI> the studies of Earth's magnetic field as the controlling parameter of the magnetosphere and of all the physical processes that take place in the Earth's plasma environment, including phenomena like aurora and magnetic storms.
The secondary mission objectives are related to the contribution to the technological advancement of small satellites and associated flight and ground based subsystem development and to the demonstration of the feasibility of small satellites as a means of performing well focused world-class space science exploration, within a relatively short time horizon.
</UL>

<P><A HREF="#TOP"> Back to index </A><P>

<H2><A NAME="project">The &Oslash;RSTED Project</A></H2>
The &Oslash;RSTED Project has been initiated as a cooperative effort between Danish research institutions and space related industry. The project started in september 1993. The satellite will be launched in early 1997. After a two month commissioning phase, a one full year of science observation, including science analysis is foreseen.

<P><A HREF="#TOP"> Back to index </A><P>

<H2><A NAME="payload">The Payload</A></H2>
The science payload shall consist of four basic subsystems: a Compact Spherical Coil (CSC) triaxial magnetometer for measuring magnetic field vectors, an Overhauser proton-precession magnetometer (OVH) for measuring magnetic field amplitude, a Star Imager (SIM) to determine the attitude of the CSC magnetometer and a Six solid-state Charged Particles Detectors (CPD) to measure energetic particle radiation in the upper polar atmosphere.

<P><A HREF="#TOP"> Back to index </A><P>

<H2><A NAME="segment">The ground segment</A></H2>
The Science Data Center (SDC) is under control of the Danish &Oslash;rsted Project. The SDC will archive the &Oslash;rsted mission raw data and shall provide CNES with an access point to the dataset. SDC is in charge of higher level processing of the dataset.
CNES shall distribute the high level datasets provided by SDC to the French Science community.

<P><A HREF="#TOP"> Back to index </A><P>

<H2><A NAME="contribution">The CNES contribution</A></H2>

<H1>&Oslash;RSTED Scientific objectives</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

<H2>Background</H2>
 Scientifically, the objectives has been defined to answer the need to resume measurements of the earth's magnetic field more than a decade after the Magsat mission. A unique combination of Magnetometers and a compact star imager has simplified the collection of data, and the special boom design will minimize the intrinsic magnetic contamination from satellite.<P>
<H2>Primary Science Objectives</H2>
 The two primary science objectives are to measure the main magnetic field from the Earth, and to study its interaction with the Solar wind plasma.<P>
<A HREF="/images/chmpmag1.gif"><H2>Earth Magnetic Field</H2></A>
 The Earth's main magnetic field is determined by the Earth's own inner structure. The aim is therefore to :<BR>
<UL>
<LI> determine models of the main magnetic field and its secular variation
<LI> study physical properties of fluid core
<LI> study electrical conductivity of the mantle
<LI> investigate correlation between the geomagnetic field and variations in the length of day
<LI> study lithospheric structure and evolution.
</UL><P>
<A HREF="/images/chmpmag2.gif"><H2>Solar Wind/Magnetosphere Interaction</H2></A>
 The other main objective focuses on the interaction between the Solar wind plasma and the Earth's magnetosphere, entailing studies of :<BR>
<UL>
<LI> structure and variability of high-latitude fields and currents
<LI> relationships between field-aligned and ionospheric currents in the cleft and cusp
<LI> external magnetic fields as functions of local time, season, and solar wind conditions
<LI> ionospheric signatures of localized processes in the outer magnetosphere
<LI> substorm processes.
</UL><P>
<H2>Secondary Science Objectives</H2>
 In addition, the &Oslash;rsted mission has several secondary science objectives, namely to study <BR>
<UL>
<LI> ionospheric currents including the equatorial electrojet and the Sq current system
<LI> energetic particles, which includes research on the energetic particle environment and geomagnetic morphology, and a study on correlations between energetic particle precipitation and ionospheric absorption seen in ground-based imaging riometer observations.
</UL><P>

 Data on GPS satellite occultaion will also be provided which may subsequently be used to derive information on temperature and humidity profiles in the atmosphere.<P>
<H2>Orbit</H2>
 To optimize conditions to fulfil these various scientific objectives, an orbit has been chosen with the following characteristics :
<UL>
<LI> Elliptical Polar Orbit
<LI> Apogee at 850 km
<LI> Perigee at 400 km
<LI> Inclination at 96.1&#176;
<LI> Nodal drift at 0.77&#176;/day.
</UL><P>

<A HREF="/images/schema1.gif"><H1>&Oslash;RSTED Space Segment</H1></A>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif">
<P>
<H2>Configuration</H2>
The &Oslash;rsted satellite is shaped as a box with a long boom carrying the magnetic instruments and the star imager, with solar panels on its five sides. It has a height of 68 cm, a width of 45 cm and a depth of 34 cm.<P>

Interface with the launch vehicle adapter is through a satellite separation mechanism mounted on the underside of the satellite body. Mounted above it are the lower platform, the vertical 'H' beam primary structure, a cable tray and an upper platform.<P>

<H2>Primary Structure</H2>
The main structural 'H' beam configuration forms two vertical compartments, one on each side of a centre web of the 'H' beam. Two rows of modular electronic boxes for the satellite and payload functions are mounted in one of these compartments. The other contains the boom assembly which during launch is packed in a caniser. All main structures are fabricated of aluminium.<P>

<A HREF="/images/bras_intr_oerst.gif"><H2>Boom Structure</H2></A>
The deployable boom consists of three coilable longerons, separated by radial spacers and tensioned by cross-wires. Redundant release mechanisms are provided, and deployment is controlled by a restraining lanyard. Total length is 8 meters, divided into two sections of 6 and 2 meters each.<P>

During launch the hingeless boom is coiled like a spiral. In orbit the boom deploys slowly (1m/min) with a screw-shaped motion.<P>

<H2>GPS receivers</H2>
The satellite position is determined by two GPS receivers with the following specifications :<P>
<UL>
<LI> The primary GPS receiver is a six channel TAN GPS from Trimble Navigation. It uses C/A mode on L1 frequencies, and gives an accuracy of position better than &#177; 50 m.
<LI> The secondary GPS receiver isTurboRogue receiver from JPL. It uses P-mode on L1 and L2 frequencies for GPS occultation measurements, but uses C/A mode on L1 frequency for position back-up.
<LI> Universal Time Coordinated accuracy is within 1 microsec, and velocity determination is within 0.5 m/sec.
</UL><P>

<H2>Power subsystem</H2>
The Power subsystem is compromised of the following elements :<P>
<UL>
<LI> A solar array, consisting of five solar panels. Each panel is composed of 2 x 4 cm GaAs solar cells with micro-sheet cover glass. The array delivers 54 watts average at End-of-Mission.
<LI> Two NiCd battery units, each with a 6 Amp/h capacity. A 15% depth of discharge is forseen during eclipse operations.
<LI> Two power control units are included with redundant battery charge regulators, central DC/DC converters, and load control/protection devices.
<LI> Available outputs : &#177; 5 V, &#177; 8V, &#177; 15 V and the unregulated power bus. Controlled disconnection of loads is included for the protection of the power subsystem itself.
</UL><P>

<H2>Communication</H2>
The communication system is redundant in order to ensure communication to and from the satellite with a very high reliability. Its characteristics are :<P>
<UL>
<LI> S-band communication (down link 2039.6 MHz, up link 2215 MHz) with two turnstile communication antennas mounted on the downwards side of the satellite.
<LI> Science data accumulation rates are approximately 1 kbit/sec in normal mode, and 6 kbits/sec in burst mode.
<LI> Telemetry down link is equipped with Reed-Solomon concatenated and convolutional encoding.
<LI> Telecommand up link includes Bose-Chaudhury - Hocquenghem encoding.
<LI> ESA packet standards PSS-04-106 (Telemetry) and PSS-04-107 (Telecommand) have been adopted for the &Oslash;rsted mission.
</UL><P>

<H2>Command and Data Handling</H2>
The Command and Data Handling (CDH) subsystem is responsible for all onboard data processing, performing<P>
<UL>
<LI> housekeeping data acquisition and processing
<LI> science data acquisition and storage
<LI> time management
<LI> data memory management
<LI> data compression
<LI> TM and TC format management
<LI> TC validation, distribution and execution
<LI> attitude control processing
</UL><P>

The CDH subsystem is compromised of two Central Processing Units each equipped with an Intel 80186, 16 MHz processor. It contains 16 Mbytes of RAM data storage which is sufficient for 13 hours of continuous operation. Data error detection and correction circuitry are included in the CDH.<P>

<H2>Attitude control</H2>
Attitude control is provided to perform detumbling after separation from the launch vehicle and to ensure stabilization during the operational phases of the mission. Attitude determination is based on inputs from the star imager, sun sensors, the CSC magnetomater and GPS receiver. Attitude control is performed in a way which creates minimum disturbances to magnetic field measurements.<P>

Stabilization of the satellite attitude is accomplished by passive and active techniques. The passive technique employs gravity-gradient stabilization using the deployed boom with a tipmass of 3.1 kg from the two magnetometers and the star imager. The active technique uses three-axis magnetorquer coils interacting with the Earth's magnetic field. The ACS maintains a yaw angle variation of &#177; 10&#176; to optimize the power output of the solar panels.<P>

<H2>Ground Equipment</H2>
Ground Support Equipment used for &Oslash;rsted has been designed whith the following key considerations :<P>
<UL>
<LI> The Core EGSE is build from a commercial product (EasyMAP)
<LI> Subsystem specific test equipment is to be integrated via standardized I/Fs
<LI> Adoption of ESA Space Standards
 <UL>
 - Packet TM/TC standards<BR>
 - Packet Utlization Standards (PUS)

<H1>Introduction</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif">
<P>
IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) is part of the core payload of EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS)<A HREF="/images/metop.gif"> METOP-1</A> and will contribute to the primary mission objective of EPS which is the assessment of meteorological parameters. The AMSU-A and MHS microwave sounding systems, the HIRS/3 infrared sounder and the AVHRR/3 imager are companion instruments of the meteorological payload. <A HREF="/images/sensor2.gif">IASI</A>, AMSU-A, MHS, HIRS/3 and AVHRR/3 will operate from a low altitude, sun-synchronous polar orbit, over a 2000 km wide swath.<P>

The main focus of IASI on the provision of temperature profiles with improved accuracy and vertical resolution compared to the currently existing infrared temperature sounder HIRS on NOAA polar satellites. To achieve this goal a high spectral resolution is required, and a novel instrument was designed based on a Michelson inetrferometer. It will cover the spectral range from 645 to 2760 cm&#175; &#185; with a spectral resolution (unapodised) between 0.25 and 0.5 cm&#175; &#185;. Beyond the technical challenge to realise this instrument the analysis of the IASI data is demanding, and it will be required to modify existing or develop new algorithms to retrieve all desired information from IASI data.<P>

Among the parameters that will be measured with IASI either in a stand-alone or in a synergistic mode with other EPS instruments are, in addition to profiles of the temperature, water vapour profiles, surface characteristics (temperature, emissivity,...), cloud parameters (top pressure and temperature, effective amount) and column integrated and vertical information of some minor constituents (<MATH>O<SUB>3</SUB>, CO, CH<SUB>4</SUB>, N<SUB>2</SUB>O, SO<SUB>2</SUB></MATH>).<P>

Although the objectives of the EPS mission are primarily aimed at fulfilling the needs of operational meteorology and climate monitoring, the system will also be able to support research oriented applications in the area of meteorology and global change. Through its capability to monitor trace gases EPS will be at the same time of value for studies in the field of atmospheric chemistry. <P>

<A NAME="Remote"><H2>Remote sounding with high spectral resolution instruments</H2></A>

The infrared portion of the atmospheric spectrum can be divied into three broad regions :<BR>
<UL>
<LI> The near infrared (2,500 to 20,000 cm&#175; &#185;) is dominated by solar radiation scattered by the atmosphere and reflected at the Earth's surface.
<LI> The middle infrared (500 to 2,500 cm&#175; &#185;) is characterised by thermal emission of atmospheric molecules in the vibrational-rotational bands. This range has been extensively used for atmospheric sounding.
<LI> In the far infrared (50 to 500 cm&#175; &#185;) rotational lines are present in the thermal emission of atmospheric molecules and radicals. This region has not been exploited yet as extensively as the previous one by space-borne remote sounding systems.
</UL><P>

Line widths in vibrational-rotational bands vary by several orders of magnitude. The bands are typically 10 to 100 cm&#175; &#185; wide, consisting of several thousands of spectral lines, which have halfwidths from 0.1 cm&#175; &#185; near the surface (collision broadening) to 10&#175; &#179; or 10&#175;<SMALL><MATH><SUP>4</SUP></MATH></SMALL> cm&#175; &#185; (Doppler broadening) at the top of the atmosphere.<P>

The concept of using narrow channels in the 15 &#181;m (~670 cm&#175; &#185;) vibrational-rotational bands of <MATH>CO<SUB>2</SUB></MATH> was experimentally tested on-board the NIMBUS 3 spacecraft using the SIRS instrument. The first instrument designed to provide temperature profiles on an operational basis was VTPR launched on NOAA-2 in 1972.<P>

Technology achievements have now enabled observations of the surface and the atmosphere at a resolution of parts of cm&#175; &#185;. This higher spectral resolution is required to gain deeper insight into the physical and chemical behaviour of the atmosphere by measuring more parameters with higher accuracy and better vertical resolution. Studies have shown that a system based on high spectral resolution may provide, with respect to temperature profiles, a precision of 1 K and a vertical resolution ranging from 1 km near the surface to 3 km at the tropopause.<P>

The present space-borne systems are far from meeting the instrumental requirements to achieve these goals. The ATOVS sounder planned by NOAA for launch in 1996 will provide improved temperature and water vapour profiling. However, it will not advance significantly the vertical resolution in the troposphere, which will remain the major weakness of the present operational temperature and humidity sounders. The IASI instrument has been designed to fulfil the need for a high spectral resolution in order to achieve the mission requirements of EPS (see <A HREF="/iasi/Annexe1.html">Meteorological payload</A> for a description of IASI and companion instruments).<P>

Numerical weather prediction, climate studies and atmospheric chemistry will benefit from the new capabilities of such hight spectral resolution instruments. For the optimal use of data from infrared sounders complementary measurements in the microwave domain should be available.<P>

<A NAME="mission"><H2>The IASI Mission : Operational and Research Objectives</H2></A>

<A NAME="Introduction"><H3>Introduction</H3></A>

To date, a lot of experience has been gained with the operational meteorological satellites of the NOAA series (from TIROS-N to NOAA-12). NOAA has produced in real time global sounding of temperature and moisture profiles determined from TOVS radiances since the instruments became operational in January 1979. Besides this pioneer operational approach parallel research efforts have been devoted to improve the quality of the retrieved products and derive additional products from measurements.<P>

The weakness of the current TOVS vertical sounding for operational numerical weather prediction and climate research is now well recognised. The primary shortcomings are insufficient vertical resolution and limited precision, namely 2 K for temperature and 20 to 30 % for water vapour profiles.<P>

To meet the specifications issued by the World Meteorological Organisation (i.e. temperature with an average error of 1 K ; humidity with an average error of 10 % ; vertical resolution of 1 km, at least in lower troposphere), an improvement of the spectral resolution by typically one order of magnitude is need. IASI will be the first space-borne operational instrument which is expected to meet these requirements.<P>

The mission objectives assigned to IASI will primarily serve on an operational level the meteorological and climate monitoring communities. However, the nature of data provided from IASI allows also for more research orientated objectives in the fields of meteorology, global climate change and atmospheric chemistry. Many of the geophysical products which can potentially be derived from IASI will indeed be of common interest to both operational and research users. Tentatively the following products could be targets for retrievals from IASI either in a stand-alone or in a synergistic mode : <P>

<UL>
<LI> temperature profiles with an average accuracy of 1 K and 1 km vertical resolution,
<LI> humidity profiles with an average accuracy of 10% and a vertical resolution of about 2 km,
<LI> cloud parameters (cover, cloud top temperature, characterisation, total precipitable water),
<LI> ozone column amounts and profiles,
<LI> column amounts of CH<MATH><SUB>4</SUB></MATH>, CO, N<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>O and potentially CFCs, possibly in several layers,
<LI> sea surface temperature with an average accuracy better than 1&#176;C,
<LI> land surface temperature,
<LI> outgoing longwave radiation.
</UL> <P>

For a more complete list of products which could be derived from IASI we refer to Table A. <P>

Operational and research oriented IASI mission objectives which can be served by the assessment of these products are presented in the following in some more detail. A brief description of some relevant international programmes which will benefit from IASI is included in the discution. <P>

<A NAME="Meteorology"><H3>Meteorology</H3></A>

Operational meteorology covers a wide spectrum of activities related to predicting the way the atmosphere will change with time on regional and global scales. These activities are coordinated through the World Weather Watch (WWW) of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). While the needs of very short-range forecasting and nowcasting can be served by geostationary satellites, forecasting beyond 12 hours and up to 14 days relies on global input from polar orbiting satellites. Of paramount importance for NWP in this context are three dimensional fields of temperature, humidity and winds. <P>

As a result of the significant advances of operational NWP models (assimilation techniques, computing facilities) the current spaceborne sounding systems, despite their unique spatial and temporal sampling capabilities are now appearing as a limiting element of the forecast accuracy. Amajor improvement of satellite systems in terms of all weather prediction especially for the Northern Hemisphere where radiosonde networks over continental areas usually provide satisfactory data. Even over the oceans of the Northern Hemisphere, the accuracy of 6 hours forecasts using information from continental radiosondes which has propagated downstream is comparable to the accuracy of forecasts based on satellite data. <P>

The inversion and use of simultaneous co-located infrared and microwave sounding on METOP is deemed essential to exlpoit the capabilities of the system up to its limits, namely under cloudy conditions. Due to the high spectral resolution of the IASI instrument and the coupling with AMSU-A and MHS, temperature and humidity profiles of improved accuracy and vertical resolution can be provided which will significantly advance the potential of the current NWP. <P>

To make full use of the information that will be provided by IASI and companion instruments, significant evolution of the assimilation methods may be necessary. Examples are the influence of stratospheric wind information derived from ozone distributions and the direc use of raw (and cloudy) radiances. <P>

<A NAME="Climate"><H3>Climate Monitoring and Global Change</H3></A>

The requirement to monitor and understand the global changes of climate has been widely recognised in the last decade. Current satellite observations while having many desirable characteristics are by no means ideal for diagnosis of the climate system. An advance as the one offered by IASI and companion instruments on METOP is highly welcome because of the enhanced accuracy and increased number of parameters which can be retrieved. <P>

EPS will especially contribute to an improved understanding of the planetary boundary layer, the analysis of changes due to greenhouse gases, the investigation of climate processes such as the interaction between clouds and radiation and the validation of climate models. Global climate models, presently limited by their spatial resolution and by the parameterisation schemes used to represent complex physical processes, still meet difficulties in describing the full variability ofthe atmosphere. The evaluation of their strengths and shortcomings will clearly benefit from improved satellite observations. <P>

<A NAME="Monitoring"><H4>Climate Monitoring</H4></A>

While climate related activities have been more on a scientific level in the past the need for the transition to an operational scheme for global monitoring has been more and more recognised. WMO and UNEP (UN Environmental Program) took the initiative to reorganise the exchange between the scientific community and the policy makers through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report by this panel highlighted the need for systematic observations of key climate related parameters which include the sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, clouds which influence the radiative transfer, oceans, land surfaces and the hydrology cycle. <P>

The programme GCOS (Global Change Observing System) was established to ensure that consistent and high quality data are systematically provied for climate studies and applications. Satellite data will be a fundamental component of this operational climate monitoring system, and the GCOS Space Plan is inteded to identify and prioritise the requirements for spacebased observations in the context of an operational climate monitoring system. An initial Observing System (IOS) is planned to be established by the year 2005.<P>

A rpovisional list of productshas been defined which will be needed as input for the IOS and follow-on systems. IASI, in combination with the other instruments on EPS, can contribute to the product requirements through its potential to yield temperature and humidity, monitor ozone and possibly aerosols, detect and analyse clouds, provide information about the surface temperature, surface emissivity and radiation budget. <P>

EPS will continue the long term monitoring of climate relevant parameters from NOAA/TIROS satellites whose observations are currently being reanalysed in the context of the PathFinder programme (organised by NOAA and NASA). It is aimed at the reprocessing the whole NOAA/TIROS observations since 1979 and started with a reprocessing of a two-year benchmark period. <P>

<A NAME="Global"><H4>Global Change</H4></A>

A number of research oriented programmes complementing GCOS have been initiated with the aim to improve our general understanding of global changes. Two of the major programmes are the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP). <P>

The general objective of the WCRP is to determine to what extet climate and man's influence on climate can be predicted. Within WCRP four international core projects have been given the highest priorities, and contributions from IASI can be expected to two of them. The first is the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX). The aim of GEWEX is to further our understanding of the impact of greenhouse gases on global climate and the response of the hydrology cycle to climatic changes. The second project is Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) whose goal is the description, modelling and prediction of global climate variations on seasonal, inter-annual and mult-decadal time scales. There are a number of parallel programmes or sub-programmes which will also benefit from the global and long-term monitoring capabilities of satellite instruments such as IASI on EPS. <P>

In closecooperation to WRCP, the IGBP programme has the objective to describe and understand the physical, chemical and biological processes that regulate the total Earth system, the changes that are occuring in this system and the impact of man's activities. The sub-programme Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems (GCTE) is aimed at developing an understanding of the effects of climate changes, the atmospheris composition and land use on eco-systems and determining the feedback to the physical climate system. There are a number of other sub-programmes within GCTE which will rely on instruments like IASI for the provision of data which are relevant to climate issues. <P>

<A NAME="Chemistry"><H3>Atmospheric Chemistry</H3></A>

The study of atmospheric chemistry is a secondary mission objective for IASI and companion meteorological instruments. While activities related to meteorology are on an advanced operational level and climate monitoring is progressing in this direction, the study of the complex chemical processes in the atmosphere using satellite data is a research subject. <P>

Observations show that due to human activities, both industrial and agricultural, the chemical composition of the atmosphere is changing on all spatial scales. Of special importance from a global point of view are increased concentrations of trace gases with long atmospheric residence times which affect the climate and chemical equilibrium such as CH<MATH><SUB>4</SUB></MATH>, N<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>O and O<MATH><SUB>3</SUB></MATH> and chlorofluorocarbons (CFC). As there are still large uncertainties, especially regarding the temporal and spatial distribution of trace gases it is important to apply advanced space-borne techniques for monitoring on a global scale. <P>

IASI will enable the observation of CH<MATH><SUB>4</SUB></MATH>, O<MATH><SUB>3</SUB></MATH> and CO and possibly also of SO<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>, NO<MATH><SUB>x</SUB></MATH> and CFCs and can thus provide valuable information about some of the key trace gases which are involved in the chain of chemical reactions. Especially the importance of O<MATH><SUB>3</SUB></MATH> is to be stressed as a precursor of OH radicals which are strongly reactive with almost all gases emitted into the troposphere by natural or anthropogenic processes. IASI might ultimately contribute to the monitoring and analysis of events such as industrial pollution, biomass burning and stratospheric ozone depletion. <P>

Several international projects are dedicated to the advancement of our understanding of atmospheric chemistry. Especially the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Project (IGAC) has to be mentioned which is a component of IGBP and has the aim to improve our insight into the processes the determine the chemical composition of the atmosphere and to understand the interactions between the chemical composition of the atmosphere and climate processes.<P>

<A NAME="Flight"><H2>Flight opportunity</H2></A>

The first flight opportunity for IASI is the <A HREF="/images/metop.gif">METOP-1 satellite</A>, which is being developed by ESA in cooperation with EUMETSAT for launch by the end of 2001 and will be operated by EUMETSAT. METOP-1 within the EPS programme is the first satellite of a series of polar orbiting satellites in the monitoring (AM) orbit, as part of the Joint Polar Orbiting Satellite System with the NOAA afternoon (PM) satellites which will provide services for operational meteorology and climate monitoring.<P>

The meteorological core payload of the METOP-1 satellite comprises (see <A HREF="/iasi/Annexe1.html">Meteorological payload</A> for more details) : <P>

<UL>
<LI> the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-A), a microwave 15 channels multispectral temperature sounder ;
<LI> the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) (replaces the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-B)), a 5 channels humidity sounder ;
<LI> the High Infrared Sounder (HIRS/3), a sounder with 19 infrared and one visible channels ;
<LI> the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/3), a cloud and surface imager with 6 channels in the visible and infrared.
</UL> <P>

Some of the operational features of IASI such as the scan cycle will be synchronised with the companion meteorological payload to facilitate a synergic use of data from all instruments, which is essential to achieve the EPS mission objectives. <P>

<A NAME="constraints"><H2>Operational and programatic constraints</H2></A>

The global sounding and imaging mission has been recognised as having the highest priority for the EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS). IASI is a key for element of the meteorological sounding package, and it is forseen that IASI will, after successful demonstration, replace the HIRS infrared sounding instrument. Accordingly, IASI is the prototype instrument of a sries of advanced operational infrared sounders. <P>

The design, configuration and operation of IASI has to comply with the complete METOP-1 spacecraft and payload. This refers to mechanical, thermal and electrical interfaces, data rates and management, mass and power budgets and the operation of the instrument. <P>

Some of the IASI features are forseen to be adjusted to the accompanying meteorological payload. This refers to the simultaneous operation and identical coverage for all instruments and co-registration between the infrared (IASI, HIRS/3) and microwave (AMSU-A, MHS) units. Furthermore, co-registration of typically 1 km is required between the IASI sounder and the AVHRR/3 imager. The IASI scan pattern will be synchronised with those of MHS and AMSU-A. <P>

IASI will also be, to the extent feasible, compatible with the afternoon satellite to be developed within the US converged satellite system. This NPOESS satellite is expected to form together with its METOP/EPS counterpart the polar component of the next generation of meteorological space observing system. <P>

The currently difined target life time for IASI is four years (with a planned in-orbit commissioning and operation phase for METOP-1 of five years). The probability of IASI to be fully functional and operational without significant loss in performance after four years in orbit operation must be at least 0.8. During this time IASI should be available without interruptions 24 hours a day. All IASI expendables must be designed for a life-time of six years. <P>

The operation of IASI will include three distinct phases after the launch. The first is the commissioning and validation phase which is anticipated to last less than six months. The pre-operational assessment phase follows. It is forseen that this second phase covers up to 18 months. It will be succeeded by the third, operational phase for the rest of the life-time of METOP-1. <P>

Under nominal conditions starting with the pre-operational assessment phase the IASI system, composed of the IASI instrument and its ground segment, should allow permanent coverage of at least 95 % of the earth without any significant systematic gap in coverage. <P>

Over the Atlantic Ocean, Europe and the Mediterranean Sea the objective is to reach 99 % coverage. <P>

The operational processinf of IASI data on-ground has to comply with the requirement to provide the user community with sounding data not later than 135 minutes after reception. The software for this processing will be used in an operational environment by EUMETSAT and has to follow operational constraints and principles.

<A NAME="Availability"><H2>Availability of IASI data</H2></A>

During the commissioning and validation phase the performance of the instrument and the level 0 to 1 processing algorithms will be validated. With the start of the pre-operational assessment phase validated level 1 data will be processed and archived. At present, it is expected that IASI data will be distributed to operational users at level 1c (i.e., radiance spectra, obtained by Fourier Transform of the interferograms plus apodisation : see <A HREF="/iasi/Annexe1.html">Meteorological payload</A> for the definition of data levels). The pre-operational assessment phase is dedicated to the validation of level 2 products (temperature and humidity profiles, cloud parameters, trace gas amounts, etc.). <P>

Selected investigators will have access to IASI data necessary for their investigations. The provision of all data will be subject to operational constraints which will be inherent in the ground segment. As the ground segement is still in the planning stage the constraints cannot be completely specifiedat this time. <P>

To optimise the performance of the IASI instrument the full spectral range has been subdivised into three spectral bands. The boundaries and spectral resolution for these bands are given in Table ! . IASI has a constant spectral sampling interval of 0.25 cm&#175; &#185;. <P>

Band 1 is mainly contributing to retrievals of temperature profiles and ozone, band 2 to retrievals of humidity and som trace gases and band 3 to retrievals of temperature and some trace gases. <P>

<A NAME="Radiometric"><H3>Radiometric Specifications</H3></A>

For the spectral resolutions defined in Table 1 IASI shall measure equivalent temperatures between 2 (cold space) and 315 K. The quality of the measuerement is determined by the radiometric noise and radiometric calibration accuracy. <P>

Radiometric noise has been specified for IASI in terms of the noise equivalent temperature difference, NEDT, for a given reference temperature of 280 K. The NEDT requirements apply to pseudo-channels defined as average of individual samples (0.25 cm&#175; &#185;), having widths of 0.5 cm&#175; &#185; in band 1, 1.0 cm&#175; &#185; in band 2 and 1.5 cm&#175; &#185; in band 3. A requirement of &lt; 0.2 K has been established which will be met close to the channel boundaries and at the centers (TBC). This includes all noise contributions (detectors, amplifiers, A/D converters, processing) and all errors sources which do not result in a bias (e.g., errors due to field-of-view motion, fluctuations of wavelength calibration, knowledge of the spectral response function, fluctuations of the radiometric calibration). <P>

Table 2 indicates for the example of band 1 how the specifications for the noise have to be modified if two different reference temperatures, 250 K and 220 K , are chosen. <P>

<STRONG>Table 2 : IASI Noise Requirements at Different Reference Temperatures</STRONG></CENTER><P>

The specifications for the on-board radiometric calibration are as follows :<P>
<UL>
<LI> The accuracy is &lt; 1 K in the range from 200 to 300 K (the goal is 0.5 K).
<LI> The stability is &lt; 0.3 K in the range from 200 to 300 K.
<LI> The relative accuracy between bands, different scan angles and different ground pixels for targets at the same equivalent temperature is &lt; 0.2 K.
</UL><P>

<A NAME="imager"><H3>The integrated imager</H3></A>

In order to improve the processing of partly cloudy pixels the IASI instrument will comprise a built-in imager to enable precise collocation between IASI and AVHRR and also some stand-alone mean for cloud analysis. The field-of-view of the imager will coincide with that of the IASI sounding unit (3.3333&#176; by 3.3333&#176;). The field-of-view will be covered by a raster of 64 by 64 imager pixels. <P>

The imager will have a single spectral channel ranging from 3.7 to 4.0 &#181;m. The radiometric performance is characterised by NEDT of less than 0.5 K at 280 K and calibration accuracy of better than 1 K at 280 K. The positionning error of imager pixels with respect to the pixels of the sounding unit will be less than 0.05&#176;. <P>

<A NAME="characteristics"><H3>Instrument field-of-view and scanning characteristics</H3></A>

IASI is <A HREF="/images/geom.gif">scanning</A> across track with a swath width of approximately &#177; 1100 km in a "step and dwell" mode. Over the scan width the scan mirror moves to 30 positions, one every 216 ms. During the dwell time of 150 ms for each pixel the movement of the satellite is compensated for by the mirror. The field-of-view corresponding to each pixel is 3.3333&#176; by 3.3333&#176;, which is about 48 by 48 km at the sub-satellite point. Within each pixel four sub-pixels, arranged in form of 2x2 matrix, are imagedonto four detectors of the IASI instrument. Each sub-pixel corresponds to a circular field-of-view of 0.84&#176;, which results in a sub-pixel diameter of 12 km at the sub-satellite point. The total scan period is 8 sec, including the 30 "step and dwells", calibration measurements and the retracing to the starting position. <P>

The IASI scan cycle of 8 sec is synchronised to the AMSU-A scan cycle. While IASI samples four sub-pixels in each 3.3333&#176; by 3.3333&#176; pixel, AMSU-A only performs one measurement of the full pixel. IASI is also synchronised with MHS in sense that three MHS scans are performed during one IASI scan. MHS samples with a circular field-of-view every 1.1&#176;, so that after three MHS scans in each basic IASI pixel (3.3333&#176; by 3.3333&#176;) nine MHS pixels have been sampled. The sampling and scanning characteristics of IASI and the companion instruments of the meteorological core payload are collated in Table 3. <P>

<A NAME="levels"><H3>Data and Product Levels</H3></A>

The following description of IASI data and product levels follows results of the IASI Phase A Study and should therefore only be considered as preliminary. <P>

<DL>
<DT> Level 0 :
<DD> Raw IASI telemetry data, including housekeeping, on-board calibration and verification data, after demultiplexing, time re-ordering, elimination of redundant information and addition of METOP-1 housekeeping data. <P>

<DT> Level 1a:
<DD> Unapodised radiance spectra and imager data with quality flags, obtained in the nominal operating mode ; corrected from geometrical and instrumental effects by an interim calibration procedure ; merged with time and geolocation information ; with all information needed for the further processing of IASI data, including flags, IASI and METOP-1 housekeeping data and the instrument transfer function ; level 1a data should be processed from level 0 without loss of information. <P>

<DT> Level 1b :
<DD> Unapodised, resampled radiance spectra and imager data corrected from all geometrical and instrumental effects based on the ultimate calibration procedure ; including quality flags, merged with time and geolocation information ; with all information needed for the furtherprocessing of IASI data, including flags, ISAI and METOP-1 housekeeping data and the instrument transfer function. <P>

<DT> Level 1c :
<DD> Level 1b data after apodisation ; expected real time input for NWP models. <P>

<DT> Level 2a :
<DD> Geophysical products derived from IASI in a self-standing mode (profiles of temperature, humidity, surface temperature, trace gas distribution, cloud parameters, etc.). <P>
Level 2a data may exist as interim geophysical products during the commissioning and pre-operational IASI mission phases and as geophysical products after upgrading of the processing software at the end of the pre-operational phase. Some of them might be merged into a more limited number of geophysical product records depending on the processing architecture and needs of users. <P>

<DT> Level 2b :
<DD> Geophysical products derived after co-processing of data from IASI and the companion meteorological instruments. These products may be similar to level 2a products but with higher accuracy, resolution and/or representative for a wider range of cloudiness. Or they are additional geophysical products which can only be derived in a synergistic mode. <P>

<DT> Level 3 :
<DD> Gridded and time-averaged geophysical products derived from level 2b products possibly in combination with information not obtained from EPS but from other sources.
</DL><P>

<A NAME="Companion"><H2>The companion : meteorological payload</H2></A>

The meteorological core payload comprises, in addition to IASI, the following instruments : <P>

<UL>
<LI> <STRONG>AMSU-A</STRONG> (Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit) : a microwave temperature sounder with 15 channels. AMSU-A is an upgrade of the MSU currently providing the microwave component of the TIROS Operational Sounder (TOVS). The prime role is to yield temperature sounding over completely oveercast conditions and to aid cloud detection for the companion infrared sounding instruments. The temperature sounding exploits the oxygen band at 50 GHz. <P>

<LI> <STRONG>MHS</STRONG> (Microwave Humidity Sounder) : a microwave humidity sounder with 5 channels. MHS is the upgrade of AMSU-B currently flying with AMSU-A on the NOAA spacecrafts. As MHS is sensitive to liquid water in clouds and graupel in precipitating clouds it can also provide a qualitative estimate of the precipitation rate. The calibration repeatability is 0.3 K. The inter-channel calibration accuracy is 0.5 K. <P>

<LI> <STRONG>AVHRR/3</STRONG> (advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) : a multispectral imager with 6 channels in the visible and infrared. The focus is on cloud parameters (distribution, top height, emissivity, etc.), sea surface temperatures and ice, snow and vegetation cover. The instrumentis currently flying on the NOAA series of spacecraft. The absolute calibration accuracy is 2% in the visible and 1 K (at 273 K scene temperature) in the infrared, the in-orbit stability 2% in the visible and 0.2 K in the infrared, and the inter-channel accuracy 0.2 K. (Please note that channel 3a will presumably only be used during daytime, 3b only during nighttime.) <P>

<LI> <STRONG>HIRS</STRONG> (High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder) : a sounder with 19 channels in the infrared and 1 in the visible. HIRS will fly on NOAA K to N satellites and will as part, of the TOVS units, provide temperature and humidity profiles. The calibration repeatability is specified to be better than 0.3 K with an inter-channel accuracy of better than 0.2 K.
</UL> <P>

<H2> TPFO, MISSION OBJECTIVES </H2>

Given the difficulties to observe the ocean in situ, the satellites are part and parcel of any regional or global ocean observing system, for their unique capabilities to provide homogeneous quantitative measurements with appropriate sampling, coverage and availability. <P>

Radar altimetry from space is the only proven technique for observing ocean circulation and sea level on a global, quantitative and systematic basis. The accurate measurement of the shape of the sea surface is the only physical variable measurable from space that is directly and simply connected to the large scale movement of water and the total mass and volume of the ocean. <P>

Altimetry has also the unique advantage to give access to homogeneous long term series of co-located measurements of wind speed and significant wave height, in any region of the ocean. These parameters are derived from the analysis of the shape of the returned echo. <P>

<STRONG>Recall of the measurement techniques</STRONG> <P>

The ocean dynamic topography is obtained through two basic measurements, first the satellite altitude above the sea surface using the altimeter and then the radial distance from the satellite to the reference ellipsoide using precise orbit determination system. <P>

The altimeter uses radar pulses to measure precisely the distance from the satellite antenna to the ocean surface by measuring the time it takes for the emitting pulse to return to the spacecraft. <P>

Geophysical corrections are then applied to compensate for the measurements errors introduced by propagation through the troposphere, this is the aim of the radiometer, and by ionospheric electrons, directly obtained when using a two-frequency altimeter. Other corrections related to tides and pressure effects are also applied. <P>

The satellite precise  position is calculated using data coming from precise orbit determination system like <A HREF="doris/Mission.html">Doris</A> (Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositionning Integrated by Satellite) or laser system. <P>

<STRONG>TOPEX-POSEIDON continuity</STRONG> <P>

Since August 1992, The Topex/Poseidon system marked a new era in altimetry by providing on a permanent basis high quality data of the global ocean circulation signal and its variability. <P>

One major challenge of the space oceanography programmes of the next decade is therefore to transition from the successful programs of the nineties (ie ERS and <A HREF="topex/Mission.html">TOPEX/POSEIDON) to operational systems designed to ensure the continuity of a service with the best compromise in terms of performance and cost. This transition is justified by the stake and the sustainable demand from the research and operational communities, as stressed in the following. <P>

<EM>Research and climate monitoring</EM> <P>

Prototype systems for EL NINO early detection and prediction have already been developed, based on the combination of <A HREF="topex/Mission.html">TOPEX/POSEIDON</A> measurements, sub-surface observations arrays and numerical models. A number of models are now run in pre-operational mode in the tropical ocean but need to be extensively validated over long periods and for a representative set of distinct events. Moreover, just like numerical weather prediction models, these ocean models produce extrapolations from a realistic description of the initial state of the ocean, which will ever be determined in using observations like those provided by altimeter systems. <P>

Other interannual phenomena involving air-sea-ice interactions have been observed, like slow fluctuations in the northern Atlantic and Pacific oceans. These phenomena remain poorly understood due to the lack of adequate observations over long enough periods, but seem to be connected with significant climate variability over Europe. Altimeter measurements at centimetric accuracy are necessary to quantitatively describe the ocean processes involved. <P>

The secular variations of global mean sea level, currently estimated to 4.5 mm per year thanks to the Topex/Posidon measurements, may also have important societal impact in the long run, but are currently poorly sampled by few highly accurate tide gauges, whose measurements are difficult to reference to a common absolute terrestrial frame. As demonstarted by the analysis of TOPEX/POSEIDON data, altimetry can overcome these shortcomings and difficulties. <P>

The continuity of TOPEX/POSEIDON-class measurements is thus essential. It is in particular indispensable for applications which are out of reach of mesoscale-oriented missions like ERS or GEOSAT, namely : <P>

<UL>
- early detection and prediction of EL NINO anomalies which develop over a period over about 2 years and repeat in a variable configuration every two to six years, <P>

- quantitative studies of seasonal and interannual variability of the ocean circulation, including the fluctuations on scales of decades which have signatures of a few centimeters over thousands of kilometers, and their impact on climate, <P>

- analysis and monitoring of the slow and subtle variations of mean sea level of a few mm per year, in the context of additional greenhouse effect. <P>
</UL>

<EM>Ocean and meteorological applications</EM> <P>

The meteorological services produce sea state analyses and predictions used in real time in order to maintain the security of personnels and goods at sea, to assist navigation and operation of off-shore facilities or to perform ship routing. Such products are also elaborated and/or used by the public and private sectors to compute the wind/wave statistics necessary to design and size marine infrastructures in any region of the ocean. The altimetric measurements are already integrated into these services and used for marine predictions at regional or global scale, directly or after assimilation into sea state numerical prediction models, or for statistical and climatological applications. The long term continuity of data is also indispensable to the sustainable development of these applications. <P>

<STRONG>From demonstration to operational altimeter systems</STRONG> <P>

Transitioning from a demonstration programme to an operational service requires that technologies, mission concepts and applications are mature enough and that a long term need be expressed by a well-structured user community. Most of those conditions are now met, since the TOPEX/POSEIDON programme has demonstrated the validity and value of an optimum mission concept and qualified the advanced technologies needed to manufacture light-weight, compact, low consumption sensors with high performances and reliability. Meanwhile, the TOPEX/POSEIDON and ERS missions have met the challenge of quantitative space oceanography, stimulated the structuration of the user community, the development of methods and the demonstration of tools, models and know-how, which now serve as the basis for operational organizations to demonstrate the viability of a number of applications. As a result, the sustainable and consistent development of research and application is possible, including the implementation of an operational global ocean circulation monitoring system. <P>

<STRONG>TPFO AS THE FIRST ELEMENT OF A FRENCH SMALL SATELLITE PROGRAMME</STRONG> <P>

CNES started to initiate studies on a multi-mission platform dedicated to scientific or operational missions compatible with a small satellite in 1993. This program is now named " PROTEUS " (Plateforme Reconfigurable pour l'Observation, les Tlcommunications et les Usages Scientifiques) for reconfigurable platform for observation, telecommunications and scientific uses. The objectif of PROTEUS is to provide the necessary means to design and build satellites (excluding the payload sensors) with  low cost and short delays objectives and adapted to all types of low earth orbiting missions with a launch mass between 300 and 500 Kg. <P>

PROTEUS shall thus include the development of non recurring equipments, functional assemblies or platforms as well as the required methodology and tools to fulfill the cost and schedule requirements. <P>

In parallel, PROTEUS, leaning on industry, develop the satellite and integrate the sensors of the various missions. <P>

The phase A studies have been successfully completed in May 1995 and have demonstrated the technical feasability of this concept. <P>

TOPEX-POSEIDON FOLLOW ON is the baseline candidate for the first mission in this small satellite program. It was selected among a number of focussed, research-dedicated or operational missions, on the basis of scientific, technical and programmatic arguments described hereafter. <P>

The first basic justification is that a dedicated small satellite appears the definite right choice for altimetry. The space programmes of the last decade have amply demonstrated the superiority of dedicated altimetric satellites over complex multi-mission systems with altimetric capabilities. TOPEX/POSEIDON has been demonstrating since 1992 the invaluable capabilities of a fully optimized mission tailored to the needs of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment. Indeed, the choice of a dedicated non-synchronous, high altitude orbit proved essential to cut the error budget down to below 5 cm RMS and to reduce the geographically correlated orbit errors. Such performances are required to quantitatively assess the seasonal and interannual variability of the large scale ocean circulation, including EL NINO events and basin scale fluctuations, and to monitor the subtle variations of the global mean sea level in the context of additional greenhouse effect. <P>

The feasibility of compact, low power, light weight sensors like the French solid state KU band POSEIDON altimeter qualified on board TOPEX/POSEIDON, confirms that a TOPEX/POSEIDON-class mission can now be implemented at much lower cost by small satellites in the 400-600 kg range. This opens new perspectives for operational systems with recurring costs compatible with the resources of user organizations. <P>

From a more general standpoint, an altimetry mission was deemed technically representative of a large set of the small satellite missions which justify the PROTEUS program development, and the planned continuity of the TPFO series was found very attractive for the long term assessment of the small satellite " product line " and its evolution. In addition, the successful TOPEX/POSEIDON heritage makes TPFO a first class scientific programme with low technological risk at payload level, which is an ideal situation for assessing the product line. <P>

<H2> TPFO, FROM OBJECTIVES TO MISSION REQUIREMENTS</H2>

<STRONG>Error budget</STRONG> <P>

The fundamental objective of the TPFO mission is to ensure the continuity of TOPEX/POSEIDON measurements over two decades starting in 1999, with at least the same level of accuracy and the addition of a real time service tailored to the needs of the operational users. The performance requirements are therefore equal to the proven performances of T/P (see table hereafter) with a local absolute error budget on instantaneous (one-second average) sea level measurements below 5 cm RMS, the goal being to reach the centimeter level. <P>

<STRONG>Orbit selection</STRONG> <P>

Repeating the TOPEX/POSEIDON orbit was deemed necessary by the Science Working Team in order to maintain the T/P performances. This choice is also essential to avoid any disruption or degradation in the use of the data, since it allows to use the T/P-dedicated gravity field for orbit determination, to cross-calibrate T/P and TPFO over the same sites, and to interpret the TPFO measurements without any delay, with explicit reference to TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetric mean profiles. <P>

The main characteristics of this non-synchronous orbit are: <P>

<TR><TD>ground track repeatability<TD>&#177; 1 km crosstrack at the equator
</TABLE> <P>

<STRONG>Payload requirements and definition</STRONG> <P>

The TPFO sensor payload is composed of a compact, light weight, low power, solid-state dual frequency (Ku and C Band) altimeter derived from POSEIDON, a second generation miniaturized DORIS receiver, a three-channel microwave sounder and a laser reflector. A GPS receiver is also considered as an option. <P>

A dual frequency altimeter is necessary for correcting range measurements from ionospheric path delay. The comparison of altimeter signals at two frequencies yields an estimate of total electron content co-located with and simultaneous to the range measurements, which allows the ionospheric correction to be obtained directly from the altimeter data. Such corrections would be otherwise known from ionospheric models, but with insufficient accuracy, in particular in the equatorial regions under high solar activity. <P>

The three-frequency, nadir viewing microwave radiometer is also needed to measure the water vapour column with an accuracy compatible with the 1.1 cm error allocated to the "wet" tropospheric correction applied to the range measurements. <P>

The <A HREF="doris/Mission.html">DORIS</A> (Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositionning Integrated by Satellite) two-channel Doppler tracking system is compliant with the 3.5 cm allocated to the radial orbit error, as demonstrated on TOPEX/POSEIDON. Doris also allows the production of real time onboard ephemeris accurate to 5 meters. The DORIS POD service is based on measurements of Doppler shifts of radiofrequency signals transmitted to the spacecraft by ground beacons. The DORIS network includes about 50 beacons and its worldwide coverage and homogeneous distribution are optimized to produce homogeneous orbit quality and to minimize error correlations. A laser retroreflector array consisting of quartz corner cubes is also accommodated on TPFO for use as a calibration source for the orbit determination. <P>

<STRONG>Products definition</STRONG> <P>

As for TOPEX/POSEIDON, an Interim Geophysical Data Record (IGDR) will be available within 10 days for mesoscale and El Nino event studies, with an orbit in the 10 cm accuracy range. The final Geophysical Data Record (GDR), to be delivered within 30 days with an orbit precision of 3.5 cm or better, are dedicated to large scale ocean circulation and mean sea level studies. For TPFO, an additional Operational Science Data Record (OSDR), including wind, wave and topography information with an associated orbit precision of 5 m, will be made available within three hours for real time use/assimilation by operational services/users. Moreover, the feasibility of a real time data downlink to remote sites such as ships at sea is under investigation. <P>

<STRONG> FLIGHT SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</STRONG> <P>

<STRONG>Orbit-driven requirements</STRONG> <P>

The TPFO ground-track pattern repeats every 9.9 days, with 127 orbits in each cycle and must be phased so as to overfly one calibration site. An on-board propulsion system is necessary to reach the operational orbit after injection by the launcher and to maintain it within +/- 1 km at the equator. The orbit being non-synchronous, has an inertial nodal rate of -2.06  per day. The orbit thus rotates two times in approximately one year in a westerly direction relative to inertial spacewhich means that the sun-orbit plane angle varies through three cycles per year, and the spacecraft must periodically operate over periods during which the sun is occulted at each orbit, up to 35 minutes per orbit. This is a driver of the design and sizing of the electrical power and solar array subsystems, and led in the case of TOPEX/POSEIDON to adopt a yaw steering mode in order to keep the solar array pointed towards the sun. A similar approach is envisaged for TPFO but with a view to simplifying the attitude control law as much as possible whilst keeping the level of available power sufficient. <P>

The TPFO orbit induced radiation environment has also been identified as a dimensionning constraints for the electronic components. The total cumulated dose after five years behind  a shielding equivalent to 1 g/cm2 of Aluminium has been estimated at 36 Krad. <P>

<STRONG>Pointing requirements</STRONG> <P>

The sensors pointing reference is the geodetic nadir defined as the perpendicular to the local goid, as opposed to geocentric pointing. The altimeter is pointed to nadir with an uncertainty budget below 0.30 (conical, 3 sigma), with 0.28 allocated to the satellite bus and 0.1 to the altimeter/radiometer antenna electrical boresight misalignment with respect to the mechanical reference. These relatively stringent pointing requirements are driven by the need to preserve the altimeter return signal (waveform) from antenna pattern disturbances and to keep the measurement accuracy within specifications. Special care should be taken to limit medium frequency (1 minute to 1 day) errors which would neither be filtered by the altimeter nor easily calibrated and removed  by ground processing. On the contrary, altimeter pointing calibration can be used to remove very low frequency components of the pointing errors such as misalignments and the attitude control system of the satellite shall allow these calibration maneuvers (periodically roll and pitch mispointing command of 0.3  amplitude). <P>

<STRONG>Precise Orbit Determination (POD) requirements</STRONG> <P>

In order to meet the 3.5 cm requirement, the level of pertubating accelerations must be minimized. Although the POD system can partially estimate unmodelled accelerations using DORIS measurements, the requirement implies some constraints onto the satellite design, in terms of knowledge on surface to mass ratio, on-orbit mass,, satellite projected surface and thermal model, relative motion of the satellite with respect to the DORIS phase center and residual acceleration level between manoeuvres. <P>

As one of the objective of the TPFO mission is to measure long term variation of the mean sea level of a few mm per year, special care should also be taken on the knowledge of the position of the satellite center of  mass location and its evolution along the mission time. <P>

<STRONG>Command control and ground interface requirements</STRONG> <P>

The only particular TPFO requirement is the three-hour latency imposed by the operational real time service. One acquisition per day is necessary, which drives the definition of the ground station network. <P>

<H2> TPFO, STATUS AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS </H2>

The satellite bus design status presented hereafter is based on internal CNES studies and industrial Phase A studies performed by two industrial subcontractors, AEROSPATIALE and MATRA MARCONI SPACE. <P>

<STRONG> Satellite bus design status</STRONG> <P>

Its structure is monobloc with unique load path and its thermal control is software driven for single cavity using thermistances and heaters, the more sensitive equipments like the battery being installed on the Earth-looking face. <P>

The TPFO satellite design is based on the multi mission platform designed in the frame of the PROTEUS project. Its baseline solar array configuration is based on a satellite yaw manoeuvre, which provides sufficient power and a relatively stable thermal environment, whilst keeping low the complexity of the driving mechanics and attitude control law. The required solar array surface is around 7 m2 consisting in two three-panel wings using Si cells. <P>

The attitude control system is based on a classical gyro compassing technique using reaction wheels and magnetotorquers as actuators and magnetometers, sun and earth sensors and gyros as sensors. <P>

The propulsion system uses a reference hydrazine module with a spherical tanks of around 30 liters to allow final orbit acquisition and maintenance with a comfortable margin with respect to the foreseen operational lifetime. <P>

The data handling is centralized, built around a MA 31750 micro-processor and uses modular packaging (stacked cards) and a 1553 data bus for payload interfaces. The on-board storage requirement (4 orbits) of about 0.7 Gbits is met by existing solid state recorders. An all S-band configuration for science and housekeeping telemetry is the current baseline for telecommunications, for it reduces the spacecraft equipment mass and power at the expense of minor ground stations modifications. <P>

The current baseline launcher, the NASA Med-Lite (using a Taurus or a Delta-lite configuration), has a 2 m-diameter shroud, which leaves enough volume margin to accommodate a two-antenna configuration. <P>

 Although the contractors do not consider the 1336 km orbit as critical in terms of radiation environment, it will be necessary to carefully select the parts in order to reduce as much as possible the Single Event Upset probability, to select Latch up free parts and to perform evaluation tests on some parts/components and to use adequate shielding. <P>

As in Europe like in the US, components manufacturers are progressively closing their dedicated " space  " product line, due to the very small market amount associated, we are currently investigating the adequacy of Commercial space part or Plastic Encapsulated Microcircuit to our application. <P>

Recent studies tend to show that this type of components have now reached an equivalent and sometimes even better reliability level than usual space qualified parts because of the large effort which has been payed mainly in the computer and car industry. Moreover, the number of available parts type will increased by about 30% and the cost will be much lower, so the potential advantages for our small satellite, low cost approach is obvious. But this type of components also show a great variability in time and also from one manufacturer to another one, they are not well known by the usual space community and their adequacy to the TPFO radiation induced environment is also questionnable and needs to be assessed. <P>

In order to be in a position, by the end of 1995 for schedule compatibility, to decide whether this approach is adequate for TPFO or not, a set of actions are in progress. These actions aim at defining a procurement approach, building a preliminary preferred parts list from selected best commercial suppliers, evaluate the specific space related constraints and their impact on the commercial parts availability and selection and assessing the assembling technologies. <P>

The 0.9 reliability objective will probably require to implement some redundancy in order to minimize single point failures. Nevertheless, some functional redundant modes with degraded but still acceptable performances for the mission are foreseen (eg for attitude control). The current baseline for payload integration is to accommodate all the sensors inside an instrument module provided by the satellite bus contractor. <P>

The overall mass and power budgets are the following for the dual string, single antenna configuration : <P>

<STRONG>TPFO power budget</STRONG></CENTER> <P>

<STRONG> Payload design</STRONG> <P>

The estimated total <A HREF="/images/TPFOPAYLOAD.GIF">nominal payload</A> mass assuming a dual string configuration is around 140 kg with a power consumption of 105 W. <P>

<EM>DORIS</EM> <P>

The DORIS flight segment consists of a two-channel, two-frequency (401.25 MHz and 2036.25 MHz) Doppler receiver capable of tracking signals from a worldwide network of about 50 ground beacons. The TPFO DORIS receiver is the same second generation device as the one developed for the ESA ENVISAT mission at the exception of the data interfaces. Its main functional improvements over first generation receivers are its capability to receive two beacons simultaneouly and to produce on board in real time orbit ephemeris with a precision of 5 m. The receiver is controlled by an ultra stable oscillator delivering the reference frequency with a stability of 5 10-13 over 10 to 100 seconds and delivers an on-board real time UTC time output accurate to within 0.1 ms. Its mass and power consumption are reduced and it is equipped with a new, more powerful processing unit which is more tolerant to radiations and single event upsets. It is compatible with a 1553 data bus interface and configured with redunded USOs and receivers connected through a switching unit to a single omni-directionnal dual frequency antenna. <P>

<EM>Altimeter and radiometer</EM> <P>

The two-frequency solid state altimeter (SSALT), derived from the single frequency POSEIDON altimeter, is under phase B at ALCATEL and consists of two synchronized radar altimeters, operating at 13.575 GHz and 5.3 GHz respectively. The altimeter electronics is split into two boxes, the processing unit and the RF unit. The processing unit includes the digital chirp generator, baseband demodulator, spectrum analyzer, instrument control unit and interfaces. The RF unit performs the up-conversion to Ku and C bands, the high power solid state amplification, the low noise amplification of the received echoes and its mixing with a reference chirp. The peak output power of the two channels are 6 to 8 W in Ku band and 30 to 40 W in C band. The radars operate at pulse repetition frequencies of 1800 and 300 Hz respectively, corresponding to 6 Ku-band pulses for 1 C-band pulse. <P>

The major evolutions of the altimeter with respect to Poseidon are : <P>
<UL>
	-Addition of the second frequency (C Band) to obtain direct ionospheric correction. Using models, the ionospheric correction induces errors which are not compatible with the TPFO error budget mainly during the high intensity period of the solar cycle. <P>

	-The digital chirp generator to allow a selectable bandwidth necessary for the C band channel and a better phase knowledge. <P>

	-Increase of the emitting power to keep an acceptable link budget (the size of the antenna has been decreased wrt Topex/Poseidon). <P>

	-A 128 points FFT transform to obtain a better mispointing evaluation and then reduce the pointing requirements. <P>

	-Use of a rad hard microprocessor to provide a better radiation tolerance and thus increase the operational availability of the sensor. This microprocessor will also be more powerful to increase the on-board processing capability of the altimeter. <P>
</UL>

The phase B study, which will end in March 1996 includes some pre-developments. The housekeeping telemetry is also extended to improve the sensor monitoring capability and the instrument control unit is modified for compatibility with the 1553 data bus. This impacts primarily on the processing unit, the RF unit which includes almost all analog hardware being only modified by the addition of the C-band channel. The preliminary reliability estimations show that a dual string (without cross-coupling) altimeter will probably be the optimum approach for meeting the 0.9 payload reliability objective. Both channels will be connected to a single dual frequency antenna through a switching unit. <P>

The radiometer consists of three separate channels at 18, 23.8 and 34 GHz and is based on MMIC technologies, leading to reduced weight and power consumption. This design does not need for a cold horn for the calibration, which is performed using a noise diode. The electronics of the 23.8 GHz channel is fully redunded. <P>

Both sensors will use a dedicated antenna (deployable for the radiometer) but a common antenna with a multi- frequency feed system is still considered as an option. <P>

<STRONG>Flight / Ground interfaces</STRONG> <P>

A time multiplexing approach is adopted for simultaneous downlink of housekeeping and scientific telemetry, using the aforementioned all S-band configuration. The baseline ground network includes the NOAA Fairbanks and Wallops stations and a third station located in Europe. The latter is needed to acquire the blind orbits in line with the real time service requirement. The baseline is to use a dedicated, low-cost ground station to be developed by CNES in the frame of  the PROTEUS program. The antenna has a two-meter diameter, which requires an increased in on-board transmitter power (5 W), the use of convolutional coding to achieve an acceptable data link budget and QPSK modulation to cope with power flux density modulation. <P>

The telemetry system is based on a packetized approach which allows to differentiate engineering telemetry from scientific one. Each packet includes an header identifying the associated type of informations (including time tagging) which allow to process the packet without any external informations. <P>

The packet TM approach allows to use several virtual channels supported by the same physical link. One channel will be allocated to the real time telemetry, a second one to the play back engineering telemetry, a minimum of two channels will be allocated to the payload scientific telemetry. For TPFO, the first one will be dedicated to the fast delivery data and includes the Doris real time ephemeris, the radiometer data and the altimeter  on board estimated parameters. The second one will include tha altimeter raw data , the Doris and radiometer data and wiil be used to generate the IGDR and GDR products. <P>

<STRONG>CONCLUSION</STRONG> <P>

The TPFO program aims at ensuring the continuity of TOPEX/POSEIDON measurements over twenty years from 1999 onwards, with the same accuracy, using a series of low-cost, high performance small satellites operating on the same non-synchronous orbit. This initiative is part and parcel of an attempt to extend the World Weather Watch in the framework of the GOOS, recommended by the Second World Climate Conference and the Rio UNCED conference. It is justified by the maturity of the mission concept, advanced sensor technologies and the user communities and by a sustainable demand in the fields of research, monitoring and applications in the open sea and coastal zone. <P>

The results available from the satellite phase A study and sensor phase B studies confirms that the approach is technically feasible within the programmatic, cost and schedule constraints. Particular attention is being paid to the recurring cost, since it determines the affordability of the transfer of the programme to user organizations, which is considered as a medium term goal. <P>

<P>
The slow erosion of the stratospheric ozone layer, strikingly illustrated by the appearance of a seasonal "ozone hole" in the southern polar stratosphere, is perhaps the most remarkable environmental change noticed in the last decade. Indeed, stratospheric ozone has a direct impact on life, as it protects it from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation. The human activity, through the injection of nitrogen and chlorine compounds,is responsible for disrupting the natural chemical equilibrium which has prevailed until now. Our understanding of the stratospheric ozone budget has rapidly improved in the course of the last two decades, with space borne and ground based observations, and progress in our understanding and modelling of chemical and dynamical processes. However operational, satellite measurements suffer from poor vertical resolution and lack of precision. In addition, understanding of the transport of minor constituents requires accurate measurements of the stratospheric winds, which are not directly available from space. In order to fill these gaps, a group of French research institutes has proposed to INSU/CNRS and CNES, the French space agency, to conduct the STRAT&Eacute;OLE experiment for studyimg the dynamics of the stratospheric antarctic polar vortex and its interaction with ozone chemistry in late winter and spring.<P>

<H1>STRAT&Eacute;OLE Mission Objectives</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>
<P>
Solving the main scientific problems in stratospheric dynamics and ozone chemistry requires not only ozone, water vapour and other trace gases observations but also accurate measurements of wind and temperature with high resolution sampling, as well as the capacity to detect polar stratospheric clouds. At present, only instrumented drifting balloons are capable of provinding the required accurate measurements with the appropriate sampling of diurnal variations - not accessible from heliosynchronous satellites. These observations, combined with present meteorological analyses and trace constituent soundings obtained from satellites, would lead to significant improvement in our understanding of the basic processes which couple dynamics with photochemistry. The trajectography of a sufficient number of constant level drifting balloons equipped with currently available precise positioning devices can give an accurate description of the velocity field at their drifting level, resolving horizontal scales as small as 600 km every 15 minutes. The optimum number of balloons and their lifetime must be determined in order to secure the horizontal coverage needed to document the filamentation or injection of small isolated coherent vortices from the main vortex and give valuable information on the mixing properties of air masses. Simultaneous measurements of chemical species, temperature and wind on board the same gondola is particularly interesting for documentating the complex chemical processes involved in ozone depletion and their coupling with dynamics. Finally, simultaneous radiation measurements and in situ observations of dynamical variables will allow to document the vortex evolution.<P>

<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>
<H2>STRAT&Eacute;OLE : The Scientific Objectives </H2>
The scientific objectives are the study of :<BR>
<UL>
<LI> the structure and evolution of the antarctic polar vortex,
<LI> the diffusion and mixing properties of the vortex,
<LI> the evolution of the ozone deficit and its dilution after the vortex breakdown,
<LI> the permeability of the vortex edge to chemical constituent fluxes,
<LI> the impact of gravity waves and turbulence on the mixing properties of the vortex.
</UL>

<P>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>
<H2>Complementary Measurements</H2>
Complementary measurements of wind and chemical species at different time and space scale from ground-based, aircraft and space borne instruments are planned or will be available during STRAT&Eacute;OLE.<BR>
The ENVISAT mission of the European Space Agency, includes among other sensors three profiling instruments (SCIAMACHY, MIPAS, GOMOS) devoted to the observation of minor constituents, as well as temperature and aerosols. STRAT&Eacute;OLE will bring the detailed dynamical information necessary fir explaining the large scale transport and distribution of these aerosols and minor constituents. Hence the synergy between these two programmes appears to be a unique opportunity for the research community.<BR>
The use of airborne facilities developed by different countries, instrumented Infrared Montgolfi&egrave;res, ground-bases instruments, radiosondes and ozone sondes at stations existing on the Antarctic continent will also provide complementary measurements documenting to stratospheric chemistry, vortex permeability and turbulence.<BR>
International cooperations will be sought to organize such intensive observing campaing during the STRAT&Eacute;OLE experiment.<P>

<P>
<H2>The Observing System</H2>
The main element of the STRAT&Eacute;OLE observing system is a set of approximately 200 balloons drifting at two different constant density level (about 50 and 70 hPa), equipped with instrumented gondolas weighting about 10 kg.<P>

<STRONG>The gondolas</STRONG> are designed by LMD (CNRS); their structure consists in a 70 cm long and 40 cm diameter polystyrene tubes which allows thermal conditioning of the different elements. Three solar panels are set vertically around the central tube.<BR>
The basic payload includes :<BR>
<UL>
<LI> temperature and pressure sensors,
<LI> precise positioning GPS receivers,
<LI> an ARGOS beacon for data collection.
</UL><BR>
The total mass of tha basic payload is 5.5 kg. In addition, some gondolas will host supplementary sensors :<BR>
<UL>
<LI> TDDR (TOTAL DIRECT DIFFUSE RADIOMETER) to measure O<MATH><SUB>3</SUB></MATH> and N<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>O column amounts and aerosols,
<LI> IRBBR (INFRARED BROAD BAND RADIOMETER) to measure upwelling IR fluxes.
</UL>
these two instruments are developed by the NASA-AMES RESEARCH CENTER,<BR>
<UL>
<LI> a light weight, near infrared diode laser spectrometer to measure CH<MATH><SUB>4</SUB></MATH> and H<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>O mixing ratio, developed under the responsibility of the LPMA (CNRS-UNIV. OF PARIS 6).
</UL><BR>
The energy is supplied by Cd-Ni batteries, heated and reloaded by the solar panels. The energy budget of the gondola is determined by the duration of the solar day : at its minimum (15 of August at 65&#176; latitude south), the daily energy available is 40 Wh and the internal temperature is between -40 and +20&#176;. After this date, each additional solar hour gives an added energy of 20 Wh. The onboard processing is performed using an electronic device which controls also the interface with the ARGOS system and the GPS receiver. The data are transmitted to ground using the ARGOS system.<P>


<STRONG>The balloons</STRONG> developed by CNES are small overpressurized balloons, with a closed "no-leak" envelope, able to carry a payload of about 10 kg, with an expected life time of three months.<BR>
Before launch, the balloon is inflated with an amount of helium which is a function of the targetted flight altitude and gondola mass. When the balloon reaches flight level, the envelope must be overpressurized to prevent deformation in order to keep a constant volume (in particular at sunset, when the balloon cools down) and hence a constant density level. The balloon is spherical in order to better resist to pressure. It is made with bilaminated polyester material with a final thickness of 50 microns. The life time of these balloons is mainly limited by their pearmeability to hellium. This point requires careful tests and verifications at all stages from manufacturing to launching.<P>

<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>
<H2>SUMMARY</H2>
<BR>
<STRONG>Number of Balloons</STRONG><BR>
Balloon trajectory simulations have shown that balloons should spread in the 50-70&#176; latitude band. In order to secure a description of velocity field with horizontal scales of the order of 600 km, it is necessary to have 100 evenly distributed balloons drifting simultaneously at each level. This means that at least 200 balloons must be launched.<P>
<STRONG>Launch Frequency</STRONG><BR>
Mixing properties of air masses will tend to homogenize the <A HREF="/images/strateo3.gif">distribution</A> of balloons after a sufficient period of time. Consequently, a ramdom launch strategy is acceptable with a launch rate from 1 up to 3 balloons per day. The objective is to have most of the balloons well inside or very near the vortex edge.<P>
<STRONG>Dates</STRONG><BR>
The balloons devoted to measurement of chemical species will be launched well inside the vortex around August 15. Those devoted to the study of the vortex in winter time and during the spring breakdown will be launched later, after September 1st, close to the vortex edge.<P>
<STRONG>Constraints</STRONG><BR>
The balloon envelope is fragile and conditions for a safe launch require that winds at ground level be no more than 2 m/s. This is a very stringent condition on the Antarctic continent. Thus, meteorology will play a central role in launching operations.<P>
<STRONG>Launch Sites</STRONG><BR>
This finding and its constraints have guided the Scientific Steering Committee and CNES in their optimum choice of appropriate balloon launch stations. At least three launch stations are necessary in order to secure launchings at the edge and well inside of the vortex. Today, the nomianl scenario considered by CNES is to use <A HREF="/images/site1_strateole.gif">Marambio</A> and <A HREF="/images/site2_strateole.gif">Ushuaia</A> (Argentina) as the main stations and <A HREF="/images/site3_strateole.gif">McMurdo</A> (USA) as the secondary station. <P>

ADEOS is a 3.5 ton polar orbiting satellite following on from earlier Japanese satellites such as MOS-1, MOS-1b and JERS-1. It is scheduled for launch mid-1996 from Tanegashima, Japan, by the new H2 launcher developed by NASDA. The design life time of the mission is three years with expendables available for another two years of on-orbit operations. <P>

ADEOS will be flying at an altitude of 797 km on a sun-synchronous orbit with an inclination of 98&#176;, an exact repeat period of 41 days and a quasi-subcycle of 4 days. In addition to <A HREF="/polder/Mission.html">POLDER</A>, it will carry advanced optical sensors (<A HREF="http://hdsn.eoc.nasda.go.jp/guide/guide/satellite/sendata/avnir_e.html">AVNIR</A> and <A HREF="http://hdsn.eoc.nasda.go.jp/guide/guide/satellite/sendata/octs_e.html">OCTS</A>) developed by NASDA and other sensors provided by the National Administration for Space and Aeronautics, NASA, of the USA (<A HREF="http://hdsn.eoc.nasda.go.jp/guide/guide/satellite/sendata/toms_e.html">TOMS</A> and <A HREF="http://hdsn.eoc.nasda.go.jp/guide/guide/satellite/sendata/nscat_e.html">NSCAT</A>), the Ministry for International Trade and Industry, MITI, of Japan (<A HREF="http://hdsn.eoc.nasda.go.jp/guide/guide/satellite/sendata/img_e.html">IMG</A>) and the Japanese Environment Agency, JEA (<A HREF="http://hdsn.eoc.nasda.go.jp/guide/guide/satellite/sendata/ris_e.html">RIS</A> and <A HREF="http://hdsn.eoc.nasda.go.jp/guide/guide/satellite/sendata/ilas_e.html">ILAS</A>). <P>

Observations from these sensors will be recorded on board ADEOS by three Mission Data Recorders (MDR) and two Low speed Mission Data Recorders (LMDR) and dumped at high speed to ground stations such as the Hatoyama Earth Observation Centre (EOC). EOC, in interaction with the NASDA Tracking and Control Centre (TACC) will generate operation plans for the instruments, mission data recorders and ground stations. These plans are based on requests from sensor-providing organizations, end-users and foreign ground stations. <P>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/icones/back8.gif">
<H1>Overall ENVISAT 1 Mission Objectives</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

The main objective of the ENVISAT - 1 programme is to endow Europe with an enhanced capability for the remote sensing observation of the Earth from space, with the aim of further increasing the capacity of Participating States to take part in the studying and monitoring of the Earth and its environment. Its primary objectives are:
<OL>
<LI>to provide for continuity of the observations started with the ERS satellites, including those obtained from adar based observations;<P>
<LI>to provide for enhancement of the ERS1 mission, notably the ocean and the ice mission;<P>
<LI>to extend the range of parameters observed to meet the need to increase knowledge of the factors determining the environment;<P> 
<LI>to make a significant contribution to environmental studies, notably the areas of atmospheric chemistries and ocean studies (including marine biology);
</OL>
coupled with two linked secondary objectives: 
<UL>
<LI> to allow more efective monitoring and mangement of Earth's resources<P>
<LI> to better understand solid Earth processes.<P>
</UL>
These objectives will be achieved by developing: 
<OL>
<LI>a package of instruments aimed at meeting the need to observe the Earth and its atmosphere from space in a synergetic fashion, addressing such matters as global warming, climate changes, ozone depletion and ocean and ice monitoring;<P>
<LI>a ground segment including a flight operations segment, dedicated to spacecraft mission control and operations; a data payload segment, ensuring payload operations planning, data acquisition and processing, data distribution and archiving, and user services; taking into account the existing ESA ground infrastructure and thatof participating states.<P></UL> 

The mission is aimed to continue and improve upon measurements initiated by ERS1 and ERS2, and to take into account the requirements related to the global study and monitoring of the Earth and its environment as expressed by international cooperative programmes such as the International Geosphere and Biosphere Programme and the Word Climate Reaearch Programme. The mission is an essential element in providing long term continuous data sets that are essential for addressing environmental and climatological issues.<P>

The mission will at the same time further promote the gradual transfer of applications of remote sensing data from experimental to pre-operational and operational exploitation.<P>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/icones/back8.gif">
<H1>Global and Regional Mission Objectives </H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

There is a need to provide both global and regional data to scientific and application users on various timescales.<P> 
Continuous and coherent global data sets are needed by the scientific and application community in order to understand better climatic processes and to improve climate models.<P> 
Some of the global objectives require products available in off-line mode (days to week from sensing). Specific examples include quantitative monitoring of: 
<UL>
<LI> radiative processes <BR>
<LI> ocean-atmosphere heat and momentum exchange <BR>
<LI> interaction between atmosphere and land or ice surfaces<BR>
<LI> composition of the atmosphere and associated chemical processes <BR>
<LI> ocean dynamics and variability <BR>
<LI> ice sheet characteristics and sea-ice disribution and dynamics <BR>
<LI> large scale vegetation processes in correlation with surface energy and water distribution <BR>
<LI> primary productivity of oceans <BR>
<LI> natural and man-made pollution over the oceans <BR>
</UL>
as well as support to large international scientific programmes (GCOS, IGBP, GEWEX, JGOFS, etc.).<P>  
Some global applications, however, require near-real time data delivery (from a few hours to one day from sensing). Specific examples include:<P>
<UL>
<LI> forecasting of sea state conditions at various scales <BR>
<LI> monitoring of sea surface temperature <BR>
<LI> monitoring of some atmospheric species (e.g. ozone for warning purposes) <BR>
<LI> monitoring of some atmospheric variables (e.g. temperature, pressure and water vapour, cloud top height, earth radiation budget, etc.) <BR>
<LI> monitoring of ocean colour for supporting fisheries and pollution monitoring (complementing the hig resolution regional mission).<BR>
</UL>
Continuous and coherent regional data sets are needed by the scientific and application user community for a variety of objectives such as: 
<UL>
<LI> sea ice tactical and strategic off-shore applications <BR>
<LI> snow and ice detection and mapping <BR>
<LI> coastal processes and pollution monitoring <BR>
<LI> ship traffic monitoring <BR>
<LI> agriculture and forestry monitoring (including tropical zones) <BR>
<LI> soil moisture monitoring and large scale vegetation processes <BR>
<LI> geological features and mineral resources applications linked to <A HREF="../radar/Mission.html">SAR interferometry</A> (DTM generation, hazard monitoring, etc.) <BR>
<LI> hydrological research and applications <BR>
<LI> support to fisheries in coastal waters.<BR>
</UL>
Some of the regional objectives (e.g. sea ice applications, marine pollution, maritime traffic, hazard monitoring, etc.) require near real time data products (within a few hours from sensing) generated according to user requests. Some other of those objectives (e.g. agriculture, soil moisture, etc.) require fast turnaround data services (a few days). The remainder would be satisfied with off-line (few weeks) data delivery.<P>

<TITLE>The SEAWIFS Instrument Description</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/icones/back8.gif">

<H1>SEAWIFS Instrument Description</H1>
<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

<H2>The SEASTAR Satellite</H2>
The SeaWIFS sensor will be carried by the SEASTAR spacecraft developed by OSC. It will be launched to a circular, noon, sun-synchronous orbit onboard an extended Pegasus launch vehicle, the final orbit being reached approximately 20 days following launch. The SeaWIFS sensor will be the only scientific payload on the SeaStar spacecraft. At 25 days after launch the SeaWIFS instrument is powered up and checked out. Data collection operations begin at launch plus 30 days. In terms of attitude, the ACS (Attitude Control System) has been designed to be able to maintain the spacecraft sun-synchronous orbit, perform the lunar and solar calibration maneuvers, and provide attitude knowledge within 1 SeaWIFS pixel.<P>

The three axis stabilized system consists of orthogonal magnetic torque rods for roll and yaw control and two momentum wheels for pitch stabilization. Sensors include redundant sun sensors, horizon sensors, and magnetometers.  Two telemetry streams are transmitted. The first is real time LAC data merged with spacecraft health and instrument telemetry at 665.4 kbps. It is transmitted at L-band with a frequency of 1702.56 Mhz. The other telemetry stream consists of stored GAC and selected LAC, along with spacecraft health and instrument telemetry, at 2.0 Mbps. It is trasnmitted at S-band with a frequency of 2272.5 Mhz.  Redundant GPS (Global Positioning Systems) receivers will be used for orbit determination. The orbit state derived from this is included in the spacecraft health telemetry. <P>

<H2>Sensor description</H2>

The instrument has scanning mechanisms to drive an off-axis folded telescope and a rotating half-angle mirror that is phase-synchronized with, and rotating at half the speed of, the folded telescope. The rotating scanning telescope, coupled with the half-angle scan mirror arrangement, provides a design configuration that permits a minimum level of polarization to be achieved, without field-of-view rotation, over the maximum scan angle requirement of 58.3&#176;. The absence of field-of-view rotation permits the use of a multichannel, time-delay and integration (TDI) processing in each of the eight spectral bands to achieve the required SNR. This capability, in turn, allows a relatively small sensor collecting aperture and, therefore, results in a smaller and lighter instrument than would otherwise be required. Incoming scene radiation is collected by the folded telescope and reflected onto the rotating half-angle mirror. The collected radiation is then relayed through dichroic beam splitters to separate the radiation into four wavelength intervals-each wavelength interval encompassing two each of the eight SeaWiFS spectral bands. The radiation in the four separate wavelength intervals is directed by four corresponding aft-optics assemblies through two separate spectral bandpass filters that further separate the radiation into the eight required SeaWiFS spectral bands. The aft-optics assemblies also image each of the resultant defined bands of radiation onto four detectors that are aligned in the scan direction.  The detected radiation signals are then amplified by preamplifiers for TDI processing in the electronics module.<P>

The off-axis scanning telescope rotates at six revolutions per second in the cross-track direction, for HRPT format compatibility, to provide contiguous scan coverage at nadir from a 705 km (380 nmi) orbital altitude with the SeaWiFS spatial resolution of 1.6 mrads (1.13 km or 0.6 nmi at nadir). A scanner tilt mechanism enables the instrument to be oriented in the along-track direction to +20, 0 - 20&#176; to avoid sun glint from the sea surface.  Tilting the entire scanner, rather than only a section of the optical train, assures that the SeaWiFS calibration, polarization, and angular scanning characteristics will be identical for all tilt positions and, thereby, simplifies the ground processing of in-flight data.<P>

Monitoring of sensor calibration over periods of a few orbits, to several months or years, is accomplished using solar calibration for the former and lunar calibration for the latter. Solar calibration uses a solar radiation diffuser and an input port located in a fixed position outside of the 58.3&#176; SeaWiFS scene-scan interval. The diffuser is located on the inside of a baffle pointed in the +y (minus velocity vector) direction. The diffuser will be covered with an aperture plate with numerous small holes that will adjust the diffuser system output to the required level and minimize diffuser surface degradation from contamination or ultraviolet exposure. The diffuser is located so calibration will take place near the southern terminator.<P>

Lunar calibration is accomplished by a spacecraft maneuver to view the moon when the spacecraft is in the nighttime part of the orbit. The spacecraft is oriented such that the SeaWiFS scene-scan interval is 180&#176; from the normal Earth oriented position, i.e., looking outward.  The lunar observation can, therefore , be accomplished under nearly full moon conditions through the identical SeaWiFS optical path as that for Earth scenes.<P>

The detected and amplified signals are routed from the scanner to the electronics module where they are further amplified and then filtered to limit the noise bandwidth. The filtered signals are digitized by a 12 bit analog-to-digital converter and the digitized signals directed to a commandable processor where the TDI operation is performed in real time as data are generated.  The resultant summed signals are divided by four and rounded to 10 bit numbers, and then sent from the processor to the spacecraft data system at 1.885 Mbps during the data acquisition period of each scan line.  The instrument angular momentum will be compensated by the angular momentum wheel. This is necessary to avoid nutation coupling when the instrument is tilted.<P>

Implementation will consist of a brushless DC motor driven synchronously at approximately 2,000 rpm. The accurately controlled frequency derived from the instrument clock will ensure compliance to the 1 oz-in-sec uncompensated angular momentum requirement for the spacecraft attitude control system.<P>

Below is a listing of the central wavelengths and bandwidths for SeaWiFS.

An image sequence is taken every 20 s. Meanwhile, the satellite moves about 140 km. Any target on Earth therefore stays in POLDER's field of view for several successive imaging sequences (up to 14 for a single satellite pass). From one day to the next, the satellite's ground track shifts the target is therefore viewed under various geometric conditions. After four days, due to the <A HREF="http://">ADEOS</A> subcycle, the situation is similar to that on the first day. In this way that POLDER samples the bidirectional reflectance function of the targets. <P>

<TABLE>

</TABLE><P>

Aerosols are liquid or solid particles of between 10&#175; &#179; and 10 microns. They have various origins and are of different types. The major classes of aerosol are as follows: stratospheric aerosols of sulfuric acid, mainly from volcanic eruptions, tropospheric marine aerosols from the oceans, desertic aerosols of dust from desert or semi-desert areas, anthropogenic aerosols from urban pollution or fires, and aerosols from chemical transformations. An important topic in the Global Change program is the study of the biogeochemical cycle of tropospheric aerosols, and specifically the generation of aerosols from the surface, their uplift and transport as well as their interaction with other cycles. <P>

Although minor constituents of the atmosphere, aerosols have both a direct and indirect impact on climate. Their impact is direct through the diffusion and absorption of solar radiation, leading to a cooling effect; and indirect, through their interaction with clouds. Aerosols act as condensation nuclei and affect the microphysical properties of clouds, which in turn drive the Earth's radiation budget (clouds formed in this way would reflect more solar radiation). The effect of aerosols might therefore counterbalance global warming due to greenhouse gases. <P>

The extremely variable nature of their physical and chemical properties, together with their distribution over time and space, make the study of aerosols quite complex. <P>

Furthermore, aerosols also affect satellite-based remote sensing of the Earth in the visible domain. An improved characterization of their optical properties is a key issue in improving the quality of products based on data from future spaceborne imaging instruments. <P>

POLDER's original capabilities are such that new approaches may be proposed for the global mapping of aerosols (at a resolution of 20x20 km) above oceans and land. <P>
<BR>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="/images/immeteo.gif"><TD><EM>Colored Meteosat composition showing a plume of desertic aerosols over the coast of Senegal and Mauritania. (source: Mto France, ORSTOM)</EM></TABLE><P>

As the ocean is almost "black" in the near infrared, the atmosphere is the main contributor to the signal measured from space (away from the glitter). <P>

In this case, the "aerosol over ocean" inversion scheme to obtain aerosol size distribution and content is based on spectral dependence in the 665 nm - 865 nm range and on directional information. The polarized radiance is then used to estimate the refractive index. <P>

It is much more complicated to obtain the optical properties of aerosols over land , as their contribution to the top of the atmosphere signal is at most of the same order as the surface contribution. However, the contribution of aerosols outweighs any others in polarized light. The operational algorithm over land, therefore, only uses polarized channels at 443, 665 and 865 nm.<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/images/FMBFig7.gif"> <P>
<EM>Polarized reflectance x cos (&Theta;v) (%) versus scattering angle (in degrees) <P></EM></CENTER>

For one of the acquisitions over the La Crau site, this graph shows that the polarized signal measured at 650 nm (upper curve) is directly related to the scattering angle, and is greater than the contribution of a purely molecular atmosphere (lower curve). The difference between the two curves is attributed to aerosols, which may be characterized in this way. (source: <A HREF="http://loasys.univ-lille1.fr/recherche/pol_obs_terre/pol_obs_terre_gb.html">LOA</A>)<P>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="/images/lcb.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><TD><A NAME="Surfaces"><H2>Land Surfaces and Continental Biosphere</H2></A>
</TABLE><P>

The global, systematic observation of land surfaces and continental biosphere characteristics is crucial to determine what fraction of carbon dioxide is absorbed by the vegetation. This is needed to analyze ecosystem response to climatic fluctuations and to derive the parameters of surface/atmosphere exchanges. <P>

It is possible to determine vegetation cover indicators from the multispectral data acquired by the optical imaging sensors. The annual and inter-annual variation of these indicators may then be analyzed. It is also possible to derive parameters which describe vegetation cover (such as leaf area index) and primary production through statistical relationships. <P>

Nevertheless, two major problems have to be overcome when using measurements from space: atmospheric effects (mainly due to aerosols), for which no global method of connection is currently available; and surface directional effects, not usually taken into account in vegetation index computations. <P>

POLDER, whose spectral channels are well suited to land surface observation, also has measurement specificities that should lead to some improvement with respect to the abovementioned problems. <P>

Since the atmospheric molecules and aerosols polarize the scattered radiation, whereas the surface does not, the polarized reflectance measured by POLDER is essentially an atmospheric contribution. It is then possible to fit an aerosol model to the observations, derive the atmospheric optical thickness and thus satisfactorily correct for the atmospheric effect. <P>

</TABLE> <P>

POLDER's multidirectional measurements may also be used to fit a directional model to the surface signature and derive a reflectance corrected for directional effects and normalized to a standard viewing geometry as well as a precise albedo, which is a crucial parameter in determining the radiation budget. Once normalized, the surface spectral signature may be used to derive various vegetation indices. <P>

The bidirectional surface reflectance measurements constitute a specific signature that it should be possible to relate to certain structural parameters for vegetation cover (particularly the vegetation's interception and absorption of radiation), which should improve the quality of the surface cover classification on a global scale. <P>

The models used to predict potential climate changes related to the increase in greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols require a realistic description of clouds and their radiative forcing. <P>

<A HREF="/images/BRDF.gif"><IMG SRC="/images/icone_BRDF.gif"></A> <P>

The anisotropy of the radiation measured from space, together with diurnal variability and the calibration accuracy of the sensors, is one of the major sources of uncertainty in the determination of the Earth Radiation Budget. The conversion of the measured radiances into fluxes assumes a priori knowledge of the angular behavior. POLDER will perform near-simultaneous multidirectional measurements and consequently will enlarge the directional database. The various measurements in the POLDER narrow spectral channels will be combined to reconstruct a bidirectional function over the entire solar spectrum. <P>

Polarized and directional reflectances from the clouds will also be analyzed to improve the characterization of both their macrophysical properties (three-dimensional structure, validity of the plane-parallel hypothesis) and their microphysical properties (phase - water or ice - particle shape and size). <P>

The parameters derived from POLDER observations, such as cloudiness, optical thickness and cloud pressure (computed with two different methods) will make a significant contribution to a better cloud classification and cloud climatology on a global scale. <P>

<A NAME="Water"><H2>Water Vapor</H2></A>

Atmospheric water vapor is a variable that fluctuates greatly over time and space. It is a vector of the energy exchanges at the surface/atmosphere interface and in the atmosphere by the liberation of latent heat. <P>

POLDER is able to estimate the integrated water vapor content in clear sky conditions, whether above continents or oceans in glitter conditions, by means of differential absorption techniques using the 910 nm and 865 nm channels. These evaluations, with an expected accuracy of around 10 %, should improve the quality of existing measurements, especially over land, which suffers from sparse sounding sampling and the physical limitations of microwave and infrared techniques. <P>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="/images/oc.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><TD><A NAME="Ocean"><H2>Ocean Color</H2></A>
</TABLE><P>

Phytoplankton, dissolved organic matter and sediments affect the spectral signature of the light reflected by the upper ocean by increasing absorption and scattering. "Ocean color" takes into account the spectral variations of light scattered by the water surface, and thus varies from deep blue in pure waters to dark green in phytoplankton-rich waters and "milky" green in sediment-rich waters. <P>

In the open ocean, phytoplankton and associated biogenous materials are the prevailing components. <P>

By observing ocean color from space, the chlorophyll pigment concentration may be estimated and its spatial and temporal variability (currently little known) may be studied on both regional and global scales. This information is crucial to the understanding of marine ecosystems and the evaluation of energy fluxes affecting the food chains. <P>

</TABLE><P>

<EM>Annual pigment concentration and primary production maps of the Mediterranean basin, obtained from CZCS/NIMBUS 7 data. (source: LPCM) <P></EM>

Phytoplankton also plays a geochemical role as a "biological CO<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH> pump" due to its ability to take up atmospheric carbon dioxide through organic matter photosynthesis. International programs such as igbp and jgofs have emphasized the key role of oceans in the global carbon cycle. In order to quantify and model this process, satellite remote sensing pigment maps have to be translated into "primary production" maps (carbon uptake by surface or volume and time unit) via models. <P>

Moreover, phytoplankton affects the heating rate of the upper ocean layers and consequently the oxygen and CO<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH> fluxes at the ocean/atmosphere interface. In addition, because phytoplankton behaves like a passive tracer in certain cases, remote sensing of ocean color can be used to depict dynamic ocean features like eddies or the meanders of currents such as the Gulf Stream. <P>

POLDER has the conventional capabilities of an imaging sensor for monitoring ocean color: a wide field of view, enabling global, repetitive observations, a resolution suited to the open ocean, and channels with well-suited spectral and radiometric properties. <P>

Furthermore, POLDER's original multidirectional and polarization capabilities will allow to : <P>
<UL>
- systematically avoid perturbations due to glitter,<BR>
- improve corrections for atmospheric effects (scattering by atmospheric molecules and aerosols) and other perturbations (such as reflection by foam). As the ocean contribution is generally less than 10 % of the signal measured by the sensor, the accuracy of these corrections largely determines the accuracy of marine reflectances retrieved. The multidirectional and polarized measurements will lead to a better "pixel by pixel" understanding of the nature of atmospheric aerosols, which are highly variable over space and time. <P>

<H2><A NAME="description">Description and characteristics </A></H2>
MERIS is a passive optical pushbroom instrument intended to perform radiance measurements with high spectral resolution in the spectral range from 0.40 to 1.05 &#181;m. up to 15 band can be selected at any time.<P>
The swath width of MERIS is 1450 km, providing a global coverage of the Earh's surface every 3 days, with a spatial resolution of 250 m (full resolution) or 1000 m (low resolution) at subsatellite point.<P>
The main goal of MERIS is to monitor marine biophysical and biochemical parameters on a large scale and with a very high resolution. Secondary objectives are related to atmospheric parameters, such as cloud properties and water vapour, and to vegetation conditions on land surfaces. As a moderate spatial resolution, wide swath sensor, MERIS should provide data useful as inputs to global climatological and ecosystem models on a long term basis.<P>
DATA will be collected only during daylight, and geophysical validation will be achieved by correlation with in situ measurements.<P>

<A HREF="#TOP"> Back to index </A><P>

<H2><A NAME="synergism">Synergism with other ENVISAT - 1 instruments</A></H2>
The high resolution data of MERIS will complementor benefit measurements from many other instruments such as AATSR, SCARAB, SCIAMACHY, and , to a lesser extend, ASAR. For the former group, the complementarity will come from their capability to obtain data on bi-directional reflectance to achieve good correctionsfor the atmospheric effects, as well as additional information regarding angular dependance of target albedos, aerosol and cloud properties.<P>
With the ASAR, useful correlations will be made for the observation of oceanic surface patterns such as current, front, eddies. The same will be true, to a lesser extend, of AATSR.<P>

<A HREF="#TOP"> Back to index </A><P>

<H2><A NAME="dependance">Dependance on other data </A></H2>
Knowledge of atmospheric attenuation and cloud fields is important for correcting atmospheric effects. Data from AATSR will be very useful for this purpose.<P>

To this end it is intended to measure H<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>O, O<MATH><SUB>3</SUB></MATH>, CO, N<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>O, F11, F12, F22, CCl<MATH><SUB>4</SUB></MATH>, CF<MATH><SUB>4</SUB></MATH>, NO, NO<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>, ClO, H<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>O<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>, HNO<MATH><SUB>4</SUB></MATH>, N<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>O<MATH><SUB>5</SUB></MATH>, ClONO<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>, HOCl, HNO<MATH><SUB>3</SUB></MATH>, OCS, C<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>H<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>, and C<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>H<MATH><SUB>6</SUB></MATH> plus temperature (CO<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>) and possibly thin cirrus and polar stratospheric clouds. MIPAS will provide data not only of relevance to "chemical" investigations but also to radiative studies.<P>
MIPAS is a cooled, high resolution (about 0.05 cm&#175; &#185; apodised), radip scanning Michelson interferometer. It has a scanning FOV in the horizontal both rearwards and to the side. It is intended to operate over the height range 5 to 150 km with a vertical resolution of 3 km and a resolution in the horizontal of 30 km. Spectroscopically it spans the range 4.15 to 14.6 &#181;m. The MIPAS instrument is capable of acquiring data continuously.<P>

ASAR belongs to a new generation of SARs. While the principle of operation is the same as in ERS - 1, the technology is different. ASAR is an active antenna which allows changing the antenna beam position in orbit. The advantage is that the observed swath can be changed in position. While ERS - 1 takes images in only one swath of 100 km width, ASAR allows the choice of seven different swaths (with widths between 60 and 100 km) inside a total swath of 500 km. On one handhis allows higher flexibility in observing a given area from different satellite passes; on the other hand it allows observation under different incidence angles. ASAR also allows to image a full swath of more than 400 km, at one time, but a reduced spatial resolution (100 m)<P>

Another major difference between the AMI/SAR and ASAR is the availability of a second polarisation. ERS - 1 operates only with vertical polarisation, ASAR with both vertical and horizontal polarisation. A special mode allows quasi-simultaneous imaging in both polarisation. In addition, ASAR has a low resolution mode (1 km) which allows images of more than 400 km swath width to be taken from anywhere on the Earth and stored on the on-board tape recorder.<P> 
The operating frequency of ASAR is 5.3 GHz as on ERS - 1. Continuity between ERS - 1 and ASAR is ensured as the ASAR performance characteristics include the capability of ERS - 1.<P> 

The scientific objectives of the ASAR includes:
<UL>
<LI>Oceanography: ocean circulation, (current, fronts, eddies, internal waves, bathymetry); 
<LI>Land processes: Soil moisture, surface roughness, geomorphology, vegetation science (moisture, geometry, biomass); 
<LI>Cryospheric sciences:
<UL><LI>Sea-ice dynamics and dissemination;
<LI>Ice sheets and shelf dynamics; 
<LI>Snowpack properties.
</UL></UL>
The parameters are derived from interpretation/analysis of images elaborated from doppler-shifted radar echoes processed through a coherent ASAR image processor.<P> 
ASAR is designed for five modes:
<UL>
<LI>Image mode: it provides High resolution images (resolution < 30 m) in any subswaths inside a total swath of 500 km. The polarisation is either vertical or horizontal. A direct data transmission is required because of the high data rate (about 100 Mbit/).<P>
<LI>Wave mode: it provides Radar imaging of one or two imagettes of 5 x 5 km anywhere inside the total swath of 500 km. The repetition distance for imagette (pair) to imagette (pair) along track is 100 km or 200 km respectively. No ground contact is required during operation.<P>
<LI>Alternating polarisation mode: it provides Hig Resolution imaging in any subswath as in Image mode but with polarisation changing from subaperture to subaperture. The results are images of the same scene in HH and VV polarisation with better than 30 m resolution. Radiometric resolution is reduced compared to Image mode, but the data rate is equivalent. Ground contact is thus required for data transmission.<P>
<LI>Wide swath mode: it provides a Medium Resolution imaging (resolution < 100 m) of a full swath of more than 400 km. The data rate/ transmission is similar to Image mode.<P>
<LI>Global monitoring mode: it provides a Low Resolution imaging (resolution < 1000 m) of a full swath of more than 400 km. This mode has a reduced data rate, so that the data can be stored on-board for global monitoring.
</UL>
Additional support modes are also used for ease of operations and for in-orbit calibration and validation.<P>
ASAR is an instrument for which operational and/or commercial applications are already identifid (e.g. ice, geology, mapping) and are anticipated in the medium term (agriculture, forestry, vegetation). ASAR is furthermore independent of weather and daylight.<P>

<H2><A NAME="synergism">Synergism with other ENVISAT - 1 instruments</A></H2>
ASAR data will be of major synergistic use for data originated from maby other instruments on European and US polar platforms, including:
<UL>
<LI>MERIS and AATSR for studies of vegetation status (growth, soil moisture stress), snow/ice energy transfers and sea-ice dynamics, as well as oceanic features (front, boundaries, currents); 
<LI>RA - 2 for ice topography (ASAR providing fine detailed information on sea-ice morphology) and large-scale ocean dynamics (ocean currents)

<H2><A NAME="description">Description and characteristics</A></H2> 
The primary function of GOMOS is to monitor ozone and ozone trends to high accuracy using stellar occultation by observing the UV/visible/near infrared spectra of stars as they set through the atmosphere. It capitalises on the inherent strenghts of te occultation technique. The high measurement accuracy, stability and vertical resolution are unique features.<P>

About 25 stars can be monitored systematically over many orbits in the course of a day, providing enough coverage for the production of word-wide, daily maps of ozone concentrations at each altitude above 20 km.<P>

In addition to ozone, it may also produce simultaneous observations of other species including  H<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>O, NO<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>, NO<MATH><SUB>3</SUB></MATH>, OClO and aerosol. Thus in addition to monitoring ozone it should be capable of providing new information on the composition, the dynamics and the radiation balance in the middle atmosphere. GOMOS will provide data not only of relevance to "chemical" investigations but also to radiative studies.<P> 
GOMOS consists of two bore-sighted spectrometers. Spectrometer A covers the spectral range 2250 to 675 nm (O<MATH><SUB>3</SUB></MATH>). Spectrometer B covers the range 758 to 772 nm (O<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>) and 926 to 943 nm ( H<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>O). The spectral resolutions of the two instruments is 1 nm for spectrometer A and 0.1 nm for spectrometer B.<P>
In the limb viewing mode it is intended to operate over a vertical height range of about 10 km to about 100 km. In this mode it will have a resolution in the vertical of about 1.7 km.<P>

SCIAMACHY is intended to enhance our understanding of the composition, radiative balance and dynamics of the middle atmosphere (and possibly the upper troposphere). It will be capable of operating in either nadir or limb viewing modes and is intended to make observations in both the troposphere and the stratosphere. It is an evolution of the ERS - 2 GOME instrument.<P> 
It will operate in the UV, visible and near infrared regions of the spectrum, in principle being capable of observingthe following species H<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>O, O<MATH><SUB>3</SUB></MATH>, NO, NO<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH> , NO<MATH><SUB>3</SUB></MATH>,ClO, SO<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>,  CH<MATH><SUB>4</SUB></MATH>, BrO, OClO, HCHO, CO and CO<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH> plus temperature (O<MATH><SUB>2</SUB></MATH>)  and aerosol. To a certain extend, in its limb sounding mode, SCIAMACHY should complement GOMOS and MIPAS.<P> 
Its grating spectrometer should be capable of recording atmospheric spectra at fairly  high resolution (0.2 to 0.5 nm) over the spectral range 0.24 to 1.7 &#181;m (six overlapping channels) and selected spectral regions between 1 and 2.4 microns. In the limb scanning mode, it will cover altitudes from 20 to 100 km with an intended vertical resolution of 1 km. In the nadir viewing mode the cross track scan as at least &#177; 500 km to either side or nadir, and the minimum pixel exposure time across track correspond to 32 km. SCIAMACHY is intended to produce a continuous stream of data during daylight whatever used in nadir of limb sounding mode. SCIAMACHY will provide data not only of relevance to "chemical " investigations but also to radiative studies.<P>

AATSR will provide data of relevance to a wide span of disciplines including:
<UL>
<LI>Climate studies (sea surface temperature) 
<LI>Biological oceanography (productivity)  
<LI>Physical oceanography (oceanic variability) 
<LI>Cloud detection/radiation processes 
<LI>Vegetation monitoring (index, leaf moisture content) 
<LI>Bi-directional reflectance 
</UL>
It is also intended to use AATSR for operational and commercial applications (meteorology and derived applications, land applications related to vegetation monitoring).<P>

AATSR is an imaging radiometer operaing in the infrared (4 channels at 1.6, 3.7, 10.7 and 12.0 &#181;m) and in the visible (3 channels at 0.55, 0.67 and 1.37 &#181;m) part of the spectrum. The AATSR retains the conceptual design of the ATSR to be flown on ERS - 2, namely that a 500 km swath width, centred on the subsatellite ground track is imaged at a number of wavelengths and two views of each surface sample are provided, at different angles of incidence. By comparing the measurements for each view, the effects of the atmospheric attenuation can be removed. This principla offers a unique method of significantly improving the accuracy of sea surface temperature (SST) retrievals and of measuring surface properties. The measurements occur within a time (typically 150 s) over which atmospheric and illumination levelsare unlikely to change significantly. AATSR is designed to operate continuously. Channel 3 (3.7 &#181;m) is used  at night and Channel 4 (1.6 &#181;m) is used or day measurements.<P> 

The different viewing directions are achieved by employing a plane inclined mirror in the which rotates and produces a conical SCAN of the instrument instantaneous field of view (IFOV), the scan being centred about a line of sight approximately 23&#176;, i.e. along track of nadir. The two views therefore are at angles approximately parallel to an 46&#176; from nadir. Pixel size for the ocean IR channels 1 km x 1 km and 500 m x 500 m for the land visible channels.<P>
The two principle objectives for the AATSR are:
<OL>
<LI>To extend the ATSR/ERS - 1, 2 data set, and continue to develop and exploit the operational (and also scientific) applications of precise SST data that will have been initiated and demonstrated by ATSR.<P>
<LI>To develop new land applications of the bi-directional reflectance measurements which are made by AATSR using the Along Track Scanning Techniques. This objective will be achieved through the use of visible/reflected IR channels additional to those in the ATSR/ERS - 1, 2 instrument design.

The UARS operational altitude is 330 miles and its inclination is 57&#176; to the Earth's equator. <P>

The four instruments that measure and record atmospheric chemical composition and temperature include the Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer (CLAES), Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (ISAMS), Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and the Halogen OccultationExperiment (HALOE). <P>

These instruments determine the amounts of ozone, chlorine, methane hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acids, carbon dioxide and other chemical compounds implicated in ozone depletion and suspected greenhouse effects, along with temperature fluctuations at various atmospheric levels. <P>

The first direct measurements of horizontal winds in the upper atmosphere are made by the High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI) and the Wind Imaging Interferometer<A HREF="/windii/Windii.html">(WINDII)</A> Indirect measurement are taken by the CLAES ans ISAMS instrument. <P>

The measurement of ultraviolet radiation as the major energy source for the upper atmosphere are conducted by the Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM) and the Solar/Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE). <P>

The Particle Environment Monitor (PEM) detects the characteristics, amount and distribution of electrically charged particles that enter the upper atmosphere. <P>

The Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM II) measures the total amount of radiation from the sun to help provide an insigth as to how increased solar activity may affect the Earth's weather and climate. <P>

<TITLE>Interferometry RADAR</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/icones/back8.gif">
<A NAME="TOP"></A>
<H1>RADAR INTERFEROMETRY METHOD</H1>

<IMG SRC="/icones/line_fusee.gif"><BR>

<STRONG>Radar interferometry is a recent technique that uses the phase difference between two radar images as a measurement of the distance between the ground and a satellite. This measurement is to scale with the wavelength used, i.e. to within centimeters and thus highly accurate.</STRONG> <P>

We can also use the technique to measure relief (with accuracy to within 10 m) or possible movements on the ground (to within millimeters). <P>

<H2>RADAR IMAGERY</H2>

Each pixel of a radar image carries two items of data : a radiometric characteristic and a phase. Radiometry represents the ground's reflectivity to hyperfrequency waves, provinding the image as such. The phase is the sum of the phase specific to the pixel and dephasing due to the there and back path of the wave used. The pixel's specific phase is random from one pixel to another but does not change from one shot to another. Dephasing depends only on the relative distance between the point observed and the satellite. <P>

<H2>RADAR INTERFEROMETRY</H2>

Once the two radar images have been made superimposable by geometric processing, the pixel to pixel phase difference is carried out. The specific phase for each pixel, related to the physical nature of the ground, is thus eliminated, leaving only purely geometrical data for changes in distance between the point observed and two satellite passes. This measurement is highly accurate, but will only be known as modulo of wavelength (a few centimeters). The image for these phase differences will thus show "fringes". This will be the image we have come to call an "interferogram". <P>

An interferogram can be broken down into three distinct items of data : <P>

<UL>
<LI> A shape created by the viewing geometrical configuration and the possible non-parallelism of the two orbits. This latter effect can be eliminated with prior knowledge of the relative position between the orbits and the image. <P>

<LI> By a slight stroboscopic effect, the relief will impress a network of fringes similar to that for iso-altitude curves on the interferogram. The difference in altitude between two of these fringes (and thus the accuracy of the altimetric measurement) will depend on imaging accuracy (stereo base). <P>

<LI> Finally, any movement on the ground between two shots will be measured by interferogram on the scale of the wavelength, and thus to within very high accuracy. To obtain this image for movements (also made up of fringes comparables to iso-movement curves), we must be able to eliminate relief's effects or choose an image couple where the stereo effect is non-existent. <P>
</UL> <P>

<H2>LIMITATIONS</H2>

<UL>
<LI> <EM>Geometrical</EM> :<BR>
Dephasing related to the ground's physical nature will depend on the wave's incidence on the ground. This dephasing must be the same for both SAR images. The two satellite passes must thus be close enough (to within about a few hundred meters), which is often the case. <P>

<LI> <EM>Temporal</EM> : <BR>
The surface state of the ground must remain unchanged between two viewings. This excludes seas, but also highly agricultural regions dues to harvests, ploughing or simply changes in the vegetation. Where possible, it is preferable to avoid over long intervals between image acquisitions or regions with a dense cover of vegetation. <P>
</UL> <P>

<H2>APPLICATIONS</H2>

<UL>
<LI> <EM>Terrain Digital Model</EM> : <BR>
A Terrain Digital Model can be computed from a raw interferogram and prior knowledge of satellite orbital positions. Levels of accuracy obtained are comparable with those obtained by stereo optics from SPOT images. <P>

<LI> <EM>Ground movements</EM> : <BR>
If we can remove the effect of relief or where this effect is of low significance, the interferogram can show ground movements between two viewings to within centimeters. CNES was the first to validate this technique when it published a cartography for ground co-seismic movements during the Landers earthquake in June 1992 (<EM>Nature</EM>, July 93). Other applications include the following : <P>

<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="landers.html">studying earthquakes</A> and detection of pre- and post seismic movements,
<LI> <A HREF="etna.html">detecting volcano swellings</A> before eruption,
<LI> <A HREF="mexique.html">measuring landslides</A>,
<LI> measuring the rate of progress of glaciers,
<LI> monitoring land subsidence where gas or oil are being extracted,

11th November 1996
<P>
Dear Reader,
<P>
As you may know, The Shetland Times Ltd have obtained a temporary court order preventing The Shetland News from making free HTML links to pages on their website. 
<P>
They claim we breached their copyright by doing so. This case has enormous implications for the future of the World Wide Web and has attracted international concern because, if The Shetland Times succeeds at the full hearing in the Court of Session in Edinburgh, it will become illegal in Scotland (and possibly throughout the UK) to make a hypertext link to a page without the permission of the website operator. 
<P>
The action also has serious implications for me personally. I have already incurred legal fees of 1,831.50p for lodging defences in a court 400 miles away. My professional association, the <A HREF="http://gnew.gn.apc.org/media/nuj.html">National Union of Journalists</A>, has now taken up the case and we have instructed a specialist law firm in Edinburgh to fight it. But I still have to pay my initial costs.
<P>
1,831.50p is chickenfeed to a business like The Shetland Times Ltd, which has a near-monopoly on print media in Shetland, but I run a one-man news agency business and I don't have the spare cash to settle this account, which is now due. Nor does Zetnews Ltd, the publisher of The Shetland News, because it is a new company, still in the development stage. 
<P>
A bill of this size would mean firing our first paid member of staff, whom we hired only last week to help expand our free service to readers. The rest of us are currently working for nothing on this project.
<P>
I don't like asking you for charity but I have no alternative. If you will make a donation, however small, to The Shetland News Appeal Fund, my colleagues and I will be very grateful. We will not publicise individual donations without the donors' permission.
<P>
The fund will be controlled and administered by Messrs. Tait & Peterson, solicitors, of Commercial Street, Lerwick, Shetland. They will be the sole signatories on the bank account, in trust for me and Zetnews Ltd. The money will be used to pay our legal expenses. If there is a surplus, we propose that it should go to the National Union of Journalists, to help the costs of fighting this case and any similar cases which may arise in future. The accounts of the fund will be open to public inspection and in due course will be published on our website.
<P>
Thank you for your help,
<p>
(Jonathan Wills)

<H1>The Bressay Essay</H1>
<H3>A new script for 'Tory Story'</H3>
<P>
by Jonathan Wills, 9th January 1997
<H4>(This feature also appears in <I>The Orcadian</I> newspaper, published at Kirkwall, Orkney.)</H4>
<HR>
</center>
<P>
Last year it was too snowy for first-footing, although Lord knows I tried. Remind me to tell you the story, sometime, of how I fought my way out of that drift in the park below Raymond's house, armed with only a broken ski stick and an empty half-bottle. The year before it was too icy and the year before that it was so windy that people were blown over on the ice before they reached their neighbours' full bottles. Some of us bear the scars to this day.
<P>
But this year the summer weather was with us - those calm, sunny days and still, frosty nights having arrived four months late but some weeks before Christmas and, most remarkably, persisting throughout the festies. So it was not surprising that normal first footery was resumed with a vengeance in Beautiful Downtown Bressa. There was a lot of catching up to do and no-one was astonished when I became sleepy around five a.m. and a kindly neighbour offered a sofa to 'lay me by for a start'. Anything to stop me singing.
<P>
I awoke, with a start, to find yet another sunny afternoon breaking - and set off with a light foot and a heavy head for the second footing. Bressa being a sociable place, it was not long before I found myself sidetracked. With just five minutes to the oven-timer dinner deadline I tumbled in the door of the old homestead, only to find I had been despaired of and that, rather than call out the rescue helicopter with that infra-red thing that can spot lukewarm half-bottles in roadside ditches, someone had got their priorities right and put the turkey in to roast early. It was some time later before we realised that the foul giblets were still in their plastic bag, inside the hapless fowl. Entirely my fault, of course
<P>
Let us draw a veil over these distressing events. I really should have gone to Stromness for a sober New Year, as intended. The second day of 1997 was, let us say, somewhat subdued. But good cheer was restored on the morning of the third when the radio alarm went off right on time (there having, quite unaccountably, been no power cuts overnight) and dear old Radio England told us, as the lead story, that Mr Major had decided to make 'The Family' his theme in the run-up to the General Election.
<P>
'Gosh!' I said to my partner in our vale of four feet. 'That's jolly good news, Dear, isn't it?' She sniffed, gave me a look of withering distaste and left to catch the Bressa wage-slaves' Red-Eye Special to Lerwick, where the streets are paved with PAYE slips.
<P>
I mean, I'd been expecting Mr Major to say: 'Look here, voters. Who needs families? Isn't it time we did away with such outmoded and often embarrassing social concepts, oh yes? 
<P>
'So I say to Mr Blair, the Devil Incarnadine, why don't we just do away with trade union rights, put millions of men on the dole and force on millions of women the freedom to go out to work for lower wages than the men used to get, my goodness me, yes? With the grown-ups working all the time, or filling in forms at Jobseekercentres, pre-school children will have three or four different child-minders every week, so they'll hardly ever see their parents and will soon forget who they are. 
<P>
'Then they'll grow up to be economic individuals, as the Blessed Margaret intended, not socialised members of old-fashioned families with all the restrictive practices that entails, and it'll be so much easier for my friends in the Confederation of British Industry to hire them for peanuts on short-term, part-time contracts. Soon we'll be the most successful economy in the world and we'll be able to undercut South Korea, so who needs Europe? And I shall be remembered, Oh yes, I will!'
<P>
But that's not what Mr Major's saying at all. The mind boggles, as Mr Blair's surely must have when he heard what the Prime Minister had to say in the forward to his new book of speeches. He'll surely win by a landslide on these novel, family-friendly policies. With the Tories at last converted to family values, their platform must surely include: a minimum hourly wage; restoration of trade union rights; no discrimination by race, creed, gender or age; doubling the old age pension; a social wage for home-makers and carers; free nursery schools on demand; a ban on the purchase of privilege in education, health and social services; and, of course, a sensible defence policy for a small archipelago, in order to free up the funds to pay for the rest.
<P>
Readers, we may at last be about to emerge onto the sunny uplands, after 18 years in the dark canyons of despair. For I now see that I may have misunderstood Mr Major for the past six years. He is actually a double agent, like Kim Philby, Aldrich Ames, Oleg Gordievsky and all the other rentaspooks in the 'Boys' Own Book of Spies' my wife gave me for Christmas. While pretending to be a loyal Thatcherite, he has secretly been preparing for the day when he can lead us triumphantly back to the sanity of a properly-funded welfare state where we are all one big, and not too unhappy, family.
<P>
Chance would be a fine thing. Some ironic genius in the 'Today' programme production team slotted in a package about childminding a few minutes after the announcer's deadpan recital of Mr Major's tawdry old election slogans. 
<P>
This disturbing report explained that many young children really do see so little of their parents these days that they're in danger of growing up not knowing who they, let alone their parents, really are. The reason is that most families can only survive financially by having both parents working, because wages are so low. 
<P>
With regular, professional childcare almost impossible to buy, even if you have the money, thousands of children's lives have to be fitted into complicated daily arrangements, often involving several childminders. They see less of either parent than any previous generation, and at six o'clock, when their mummies and daddies (particularly the single ones) finally get home from work, they're too exhausted to play with them.
<P>
The BBC reporter asked listeners: 'Are we doing right by our children?' The question might more properly have been put a few minutes earlier to the head Con-man who helped to bring our society so low and who still resists the efforts of the European Union to force the Government of Sweatshop Britain plc to conform to at least some minimum standards of civilised social policy.
<P>
Radio England was still on as I moved into the living room, to start collecting wine and beer glasses left by revellers under the table, behind the Christmas Tree, on top of the piano and in other ingenious places. It being the Parliamentary Recess, they were broadcasting a fairy tale in place of Prime Minister's Questions. I was just about to switch on the vacuum cleaner when I realised that another BBC producer, no doubt hoping for preferment under an incoming administration, had hired (apparently for ready money) the wholly unremarkable Carol Thatcher to read out loud her trite biography of her even more unremarkable father. 
<P>
The potboiler's plot, such as it was, was that Dennis Thatcher was 'the golden thread of love' in the life of That Bloody Woman, the author's mother (who, in a just and civilised society, would now be doing porridge in Holloway). How absolutely astonishing. Who ever would have thought it? But there was more - rich, reliable old Dennis had been moved to tears when Maggie the Terrible was overthrown in November 1990, by disloyal underlings as bigoted as herself. Get away! I was so amazed that I switched on the vacuum cleaner and shifted an armchair, to collect more pine needles and shards of broken whisky tumblers.
<P>
It was then that I saw the 'Toy Story' video for which I had been hunting ever since I visited my incredibly famous (and extremely hospitable) friend 'Gospel Tom' Morton over Christmas and he allowed me to play for an hour on his computer with the 'Toy Story' Inter-active CD Rom which he had bought for his bairns (well, that was his story). 
<P>
My taste in films is simple: I like a nice, happy ending after a good car chase but not too much excitement and no murders. I have to watch the old ticker, after all. It helps if the characters are not cardboard cut-outs, which is why I hated 'Four Weddings and Hugh Grant's Funeral in Los Angeles'. Movies must also be funny if I am to watch them for more than a few minutes, which is why I always avoid Woody Allen and never miss a Shell promotional video about the environment. I am also partial to special effects, which is why I so much enjoy Labour Party conferences on the telly, or Jim Wallace on horseback.
<P>
So I left the housekeeping until the afternoon and settled down to watch 'Toy Story', after a helpful child had shown me how to work the video machine. If you haven't yet seen it, all I can say is do so, soon. If you have, then why not watch it all over again?  This film has everything. I take back all I ever said about the Disney Corporation. They finally did it. Eat your heart out, 'Magic Roundabout'!
<P>
Disney executives and their many competitors must already be worrying about how they can follow a blockbuster like this. It's obvious that human actors are a thing of the past. The computer creations are now so much more attractive and interesting and, no doubt, easier to direct and produce. And so much less likely to compromise themselves with Los Angeles ladies of the night, or indeed the middle of the afternoon.
<P>
The answer may well be 'Tory Story'. It can only be a matter of time before 'House of Cards' and 'Our Friends Up North' are superceded by a computerised version of Parliamentary papers and capers. Better still, the inter-active CD Rom version would allow voters the chance to design the politicians they want and make them do things the electorate would like them to do, rather than what vested interests lobby them for.
<P>
I am already working on a screenplay which, for copyright reasons, I dare not expose to your vulgar gaze until I've flogged it to Shetland Times Global Media Monopolies plc. But I can tell you one of the storylines: in 'Toy Story' Sheriff Woody marshals his troops in preparation for the imminent house removal of their owner, one Andy (a child whose working mother appears to lavish him with expensive gifts in lieu of meaningful inter-familial relationships).
<P>
Woody asks each toy to make sure he, she or it has a 'Moving Buddy' - a colleague to look after them on the journey. The question must be - who should John Major's moving buddy be? Not Michael 'Mr Wobbly' Hassletime, surely? Certainly not Michael 'Action Man' Portaloo or Michael Forsyth, the pet rat. Rather too many Michaels there for a single script, in any case.
<P>
His old buddy, Peerie Norrie Lamont, aka 'My Little Shetland Pony', might not be welcome on a long pantechnicon journey these days. Possibly Ken 'Mr Potato' Clarke, being the Little Lead Major's next-door neighbour, might chum our unlamented First Lord of the Treasury into oblivion on the Huntingdonshire tundra or the Bank of England board. More likely, I suggest, it will be Virginia 'Bo Peep' Bottomley, who has lost her sheep - and the place.
<P>
Whoever is chosen, I hope they lose their buddy on the way. We desperately need a new script, suitable for all ages. Alas, 'Bambi' Blair's production team seem all too likely to seek parental guidance. His Dad was a Tory, after all.

9th January 1997
<P>
A Fife historian believes he has solved the mystery of the wreck  discovered on the seabed less than a mile from Britain's first  Atlantic oilfield.
<P>
Dunfermline author and businessman Bob Baird said yesterday [WED] he  was 'extremely confident' that the ship lying 1,400 feet below the  surface is the Norwegian steamer 'Navarra', torpedoed with the loss  of 11 men on April 6, 1940, just three days before the Nazi invasion of Norway.
<P>
Now Mr Baird (55) is trying to find out what happened to the 14  survivors who were picked up from lifeboats by the Finnish steamship  'Atlas' and landed at Kirkwall.
<P>
The wreck, at the Foinaven oilfield 100 miles west of Shetland, was  found two years ago by a remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) during  seabed surveys by McDermotts, working for British Petroleum. 
<P>
BP made available 13 hours of ROV video footage for Mr Baird to study  and, after an 11-month trawl through libraries and wartime archives  in Britain, Norway and Germany, he said the wreck exactly fitted the  'Navarra', built at Sunderland in 1921.
<P>
It was the right size, in the right position and its cargo of coal  matched records showing the 'Navarra's' last voyage was from Swansea  to Oslo with 3,000 tonnes of Welsh coal - and also what appear to be  some tracked military vehicles.
<P>
'BP have been brilliant,' Mr Baird said. 'They couldn't have been  more helpful. They even arranged for a re-survey of the wreck a few  weeks ago. I feel highly privileged.'
<P>
BP's Foinaven operations manager, Les Thomson, has taken a keen  personal interest in the discovery. On his Aberdeen office desk sits  a lump of coal brought up from the wreck by a ROV, which also  recovered the serial number plate 105675 from the ship's Marconi  radio, now being checked for positve identification. There are plans  to send to coal for chemical analysis and to try to recover one of  the tracked vehicles on board.
<P>
Mr Thomson said his one remaining doubt was that the wreck appeared  to have a gun on the stern. As Norway was still neutral at the time,  this did not seem to tally. But yesterday [WED] Mr Baird said he  thought he had solved that problem: 'There was an agreement under the  rules of war that allowed neutral shipping under contract to  belligerent states to be armed defensively... 
<P>
'I suspect the 'Navarra' was under contract to a British company,  bringing pit props from Norway and taking coal back, so that's the  obvious explanation for the gun, which the Imperial War Museum have  identified as a 12-pounder,' he said.
<P>
'The 'Navarra' was torpedoed by Oberleutnant Hans Jurst of the U-59  in a horrendous northerly gale at 2.30 in the morning. I don't think  Jurst made any attempt to communicate with the ship before he sank  her. In those conditions it would have been very difficult. The fact  that she was a neutral vessel trading with the enemy would have  justified him sinking her. On the video you can see the ship's plates  bent 90 degrees by the force of the explosion.'
<P>
Chris Olsson of Foinaven oilfield operators Golar-Nor is helping with  the research. He said yesterday: 'What became of those 14 men who  landed in Kirkwall on April 7, 1940? If their vessel had not been  sunk then they would have been steaming up Oslo Fjord on the morning  of April 9, surrounded by most of the German surface fleet which was  attacking Norway.
<P>
'The U-boat which torpedoed 'Navarra' continued a successful career  throughout the remainder of the war until she was scrapped in Kiel in  the summer of 1945. 
<P>
'The commander of U-59 was transferred to the newly built U-104 in  August 1940 and was killed, together with all his crew, when they  were depth-charged by 'HMS Rhododendron' north-west of Ireland three  months later.' 
<P>
Mr Olsson found the details on an excellent Icelandic site  <A HREF="http://rvik.ismennt.is/~gummihe/Uboats/u-boats.htm">http://rvik.ismennt.is/~gummihe/Uboats/u-boats.htm</A>  which readers may like to visit.
<P>
Mr Baird and Mr Olsson would like to hear from any survivors of the  'Navarra', or their descendants, so they can piece together the full  story of the 'Navarra's' last voyage, 57 years ago.
<P>
Mr Baird can be contacted at: <BR>39 Woodlands Drive, <BR>Crossford,  <BR>Dunfermline, <BR>Fife, <BR>KY12 8QE; <BR>tel: +44 (0)1383 728307.

 The Norwegian Steamship "Navarra" was torpedoed by a German U-Boat (U-59, Captain Jurst) on 6th April 1940 while carrying a cargo of 3,000 tons of Welsh steam coal from Swansea to Oslo.  It is believed that she now lies in  400 metres of water near the Foinaven oilfield.  I understand that 11 men perished, but 14 others were rescued by a Finnish vessel (Atlas) and were delivered to Kirkwall in Orkney on the 7th.  This event occurred just 3 days before the German invasion of Norway and those men may have subsequently joined the  Free Norwegian Merchant Navy.
<P>
I have been in touch with the researcher and author Bob Baird who has established that she was sunk at 02:30hrs during a Northerly Gale.  A Royal Air Force Coastal Command aircraft sighted a lifeboat on that same day  some distance to the South and it was subsequently established that this  boat  was from Navarra and which was saved by "Atlas".  
<P>
On the 9th of April one of Navarra's lifeboats was found in North Ronaldsay Sound  and on the 2nd of May a liferaft from Navarra was found at Ness Point, Burray, Orkney.  On the 3rd of  May another was found at Old Head, South Ronaldsay and on the 4th of May  a lifebuoy from Navarra was found at Stew Haven on the East side of South Ronaldsay.
<P>
An excellent Website in Iceland <A HREF="http://rvik.ismennt.is/~gummihe/Uboats/u-boats.htm">http://rvik.ismennt.is/~gummihe/Uboats/u-boats.htm</A>  shows that the  U-boat which torpedoed Navarra continued a successful career throughout the remainder of the war until she was scrapped in Kiel in the summer of '45. The commander of U-59 at the time of the sinking  of Navarra was transferred to the newly built U-104 in August '40 and was killed together with all his crew when they were depth-charged by HMS Rhododendron North West of Ireland three months later.
<P>
What became of those 14 men who landed in Kirkwall on the 7th of April 1940? If their vessel had not been sunk then they would have been steaming up Oslo Fjord on the morning of the 9th of April surrounded by most of the German surface fleet which was attacking Norway! 
<P>
Presumably records were made in Kirkwall of the arrival of 14 ship-wrecked sailor even if they were nationals of a then neutral state.  Perhaps the Kirkwall Harbour Masters office recorded their names.  Perhaps the Norwegian Vice-Consulate in Orkney documented their arrival and their onward  departure for Aberdeen?  Would the local Police have been involved?  I presume that during wartime the local newspaper would have been forbidden from printing casualty information which could have been of value to the enemy, but perhaps unnamed witnesses of the sinking were interviewed for a suitably censored report.
<P>
I would be most interested to find a list of the names of those 14 men and any other information about them which may still be available.  It is unlikely that any of them are still alive today, but that possibility does exist and I would like to try to find out what happened to them.

<B>The Dan Lawn judgment - Stan Stephens writes:</B>
<P>
Valdez, Alaska, 
<BR>28th December 1996
<P>
The Alaska Supreme Court has handed state environmental regulator Dan  Lawn a victory in his wrongful-demotion lawsuit.
<P>
This demotion occurred on July 31, 1989 - four months after the  'Exxon Valdez' ran aground on Bligh Reef.  Dan was removed as  District Supervisor of the Prince William Sound District and relieved  of all oversight responsibilities dealing with the Alyeska Pipeline  Service Company and the oil industry.  
<P>
Before the oil spill Dan had constantly warned the State of problems  with the shipment of oil.  The State of Alaska ignored his pleas  before the spill and failed to listen to their senior most  knowledgeable person at the time of the spill.  
<P>
Dan Lawn's hard work was rewarded by a job demotion. This December,  almost eight years after the spill, the State told Dan Lawn that they  no longer had work for him and said he would be laid off as of  February 1997. This early Christmas present by the State was their  way of saying thanks to a dedicated employee of 19 years, who did his job.
<P>
On December 27 the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that Dan Lawn was  wrongfully demoted in July of 1989. This decision gave Dan back his  old job duties, overseeing the Alyeska Pipeline Terminal in Valdez  for the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.
<P>
Will the State of Alaska do the right thing and honor the Supreme  Court decision? We are all hoping so. The citizens of Alaska have  everything to gain by putting Dan back in his old job.  The citizens  of this State have always said that Dan was wrongfully demoted. Now  the Supreme Court of the State of Alaska agrees.
<P>
It will be interesting to see if a Supreme Court decision will be  upheld by the State administration or if they will continue to try to  abuse his rights.

<B>Back The Tory Government, Whatever It Does? </B>
<p>
2nd December 1996
<P>
Dear Sir,
<P>
The tendency of Tory prospective candidates, for Orkney and Shetland, to criticise Tory government policy has again been exemplified by Mr Hope Vere  Anderson's attack on Mr Clarke's airport tax.
<P>
To show one's independence is all very well and we must thank Mr Anderson for so doing but, it is fair to ask, for whom should local Tory supporters vote if they happen genuinely to support Mr Clarke on this matter - as they have every right to do ?
<P>
This, may I say, is not a problem for me as I shall not vote Tory, however many criticisms Mr Anderson may make of bigger and better Tories than he. Were I a mischievous old fellow, I would put up as a 'Back The Tory Government Whatever It Does' candidate. I reckon I could split the Tory vote rather neatly.
<P>

<B>Folly beyond belief does incalculable damage to Web culture</B>
<P>
16th November 1996
<P>
It is intensely sad that Shetland Times publisher, Robert Wishart, in  his attempted gagging of the Shetland News has infringed the very  principles of free access, co-operation and interdependence that the  WWW community has espoused since its inception.
<P>
He has demonstrated, in an astonishing outburst of almost Maxwellian  bile, a fear of anything which could remotely threaten his  monopolistic ambitions in Shetland's news gathering and publishing arena.
<P>
The Shetland News was set up to inform, educate  and entertain the Shetland public and the world at large, on a medium  which, though in its infancy, is generally free of the kind of  cut-throat commercialism more appropriate to the Robber Barons of the  publishing world. In one fell swoop Wishart has ended the unwritten  code that permeates Internet culture - Free Speech is genuinely free.
<P>
And why? Because the Shetland News, a small company existing on  sponsorship and goodwill, makes an open-handed gesture in the spirit  of the Web's emerging culture by offering a link to the Shetland  Times' pages. Wishart, by obtaining an unprecedented court  injunction (at great expense, no doubt) to remove this link,  astonishingly says to the world: 'Here's my foot, here's the pistol - bang!'
<P>
The damage to Web culture in general and Shetland credibility is  incalculable. No-one benefits from airing dirty washing in public, we  know, but to make an issue of what is, after all, clean washing  is folly beyond belief. 
<P>
I hope that the inevitable spotlight that Wishart's decision will  bring to bear on Shetland's Internet presence, will, in the end, help  to show that some of us in Shetland have the vision and ability to  shrug off such petty rivalry. I hope also that Robert Wishart will  eventually understand that the Internet is no place to flex  commercial muscle in the pursuit of personal profit.

<B>Concern about Academic ramifications of the case</B>
<P>
15th November 1996
<P>
I am a little concerned about the potential implications of the 'links' case for academic citations. 
<P>
A link in the WWW is, after all, a 'pointer' to another source in the same  medium. A foonote is, similiarly, a pointer to another source in the same medium (print). If a WWW link becomes something which requires permission from the copyright holder, and which might be charged for, could not publishers then appply the same principle to print?
<P>
Conversely, of course, as publishers do not insist that one have permission to cite in print, and I imagine no publisher would dream of demanding copyright permission or payment for citations in print on paper, how can citation in print on the WWW be treated any differently?

<B> The Internet for Dummies</B>
<P>
15 November 1996
<P>
Dear Sir,
<P>
I have just read about this situation in our copy of New Scientist  and, out of curiosity,  have looked at the pages of Shetland Times and Shetland News.  And I  am a bit confused.
<P>
I fully expected the Shetland Times pages to be viewable only by  membership, i.e. that  the publisher charges money for a web user to read the pages.  If  this were true however  then hyperlinks from Shetland News could not bypass any membership  security on the Times  server, so there would be no argument.  If on the other hand the  Shetland Times pages are  free (as indeed it appears) then hyperlinks from Shetland News merely  has the effect of  diverting readers to those pages - a benefit to the Times and a loss  to the News.
<P>
So what is the problem?  Ok, I suppose you could argue that in a  community as close as  Shetland a courtesy call might be better but hey, this is the World  Wide Web.  The whole  *point* is that you want as many readers as possible and as many  links to your pages as  possible to justify the development cost.  If other sites point to  yours then surely it  is because yours is worth reading?  And isn't this why you do it?
<P>
We have recently launched our own Web site and, frankly, if Shetland  News posted  hyperlinks to our material we would be delighted.  It would be  different if the News  copied material from our pages without our permission but as I  understand it this is not  what happened.
<P>
This is all totally ridiculous.  The editor of the Shetland Times  clearly does not  understand the basic principles of Internet publishing and his court  action is at best  ill-advised and at worst (given the potential implications) irresponsible.
<P>
To help with his confusion perhaps you could send him some background  reading.  How about  "The Internet for Dummies"?
<P>
Best wishes and good luck!

<B>World Wide Web under threat</B>
<P>
10th November 1996
<P>
 Dear Sir,
<P>
As an Internet user, I was horrified to hear of the Shetland Times'  assault on the whole concept of the World Wide Web.  
<P>
As any Net user will know, links to one's site are a much  sought-after commodity; this is how people find it.  Any normal  person would be grateful to find another organisation - especially  one which he views as a rival - including a link to his site.
<P>
Quite what possessed Mr. Wishart to launch a judicial task force over  this piece of professional courtesy is a mystery to me. It is only to  be hoped that, when his case is thrown out of court, his legal bill  is suitably crippling.
<P>
I am more than willing to donate to any defence fund for the Shetland  News, should this become necessary.  It is unfortunate that I do not  live in Shetland, otherwise I could boycott the Shetland Times.

Dear Sir,
<P>
Isn't the entire point of the Internet the fact that you can move  from site to site to site? It's called 'surfing', as any schoolchild  with a modicum of intelligence will tell you. I can only presume that  Mr Wishart's total loss of marbles is due to the surf up Shetland way  being so damn cold, especially at this time of year.
<P>
There couldn't be another reason, could there? Could it possibly be  that Mr Wishart's ire is up because The Shetland News is the far  superior and livelier newspaper and its editor the best journalist  the islands have produced in a generation or more?

May you and the Shetland News prosper! As has been pointed out by other  correspondents, people are normally flattered (and may be prepared to  pay) to have a link to their site. And as you yourself say, to invoke  the Copyright Act seems curious where no copying is involved. 
<P>
For some time I have had a link to your excellent site from my <A HREF="http://www.dis.strath.ac.uk/business/newsuk.html"> UK news page</A>  (part of a site of links to business sources) - I have removed the link  to the Shetland Times...

David Rothman writes from Alexandria, Virginia:
<P>
 Has anyone checked some local water supplies for lead or perhaps something more lively, in the Timothy Leary vein? Just how else to explain Robert Wishart's bizarrely obtuse crusade against easy linking, the very glory of the World Wide Web? Only one other possiblity (<A HREF="http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/editorial/guested2.html">http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/editorial/guested2.html</A>) comes to mind.
<P>
Whatever the reason, I'm amazed that anybody could be so dim-witted, so blind to the basic principles here. 
<P>
Just now I dropped by the Web site of the Shetland Times and saw that Mr Wishart publishes books, not just the newspaper. Let's hope that he doesn't feel the same way about this other medium. If so, perhaps a judge will go along with Mr. Wishart's certain-to-be-made suggestion that library catalogues be declared illegal. 
<P>
At least the controversy has introduced me and others to your newspaper's wonderful, quirky writing -the Shetland Islands aren't exactly at the center of most conversation in my suburb of Washington, D.C. 
<P>
Now some second thoughts: Could Mr. Wishart actually be a secret investor in The Shetland News? If you two are in cahoots to boost your publication's readership, I'll say: 'Jolly well done.' 
<P>
Seriously, the very best of luck in court.

<B>Shocked at victimisation of The Shetland News</B>

Dear Editor
<P>
I have just returned from a visit to Russia, and am shocked to  discover that The Shetland News, a website I read daily when in the  UK, is being victimised by someone who clearly doesn't understand what the World Wide Web is about. 
<P>
This is just a line to wish you all the best in the important legal  battle that is to come. Post details of where to send money for your  legal fighting fund and you'll certainly get a contribution from me.
<P>
And thanks for a thoughtful, literate, provocative and entertaining  paper. Could it be that the Shetland Times people are jealous?

<B>A stab in the heart of the Internet community</B>
<P>
31st October 1996
<P>
Dear Editor,
<P>
I have read the reports of what has been happening in the Scottish  Court vis-a-vis the outrageous claim that the links you made to  another island newspaper, The Shetland Times, were illegal and a  breach of copyright law!
<P>
Why should I be interested? I have no links with the Shetland Islands  other than a few friends I've made over the Internet.
<P>
Well, I'm an expatriate Welshman, and I know what links with home  mean. It's been such a pleasure to read publications from a small  community that still has heart - or so I thought. The actions of your  rival seem to me to stab at that heart, and extremely viciously. I  can think of no occasion when I was unaware of which newspaper I was  reading. Anyone who is interested enough to read the two publications  must be aware that they are different.
<P>
The action taken is against the free spirit of the Internet. Anybody  who has only two or three hours worth of experience of "Net surfing"  would realise this. I have two small web-sites on which I'm  encouraged to make world-wide links. In other words, I'm supposed to  give a free ad. to other contributors to this medium, provided of  course that they are not engaged in anything unsavoury or illegal.
<P>
One of them is in the course of revision right now. It's in the  States, and the whole site gets many visitors. I shall, in my  revision, put a link to "The Shetland News", and when it's in place,  later next week, I'll let you have full details with the address.  Please note. I'm not asking your permission to do this. I hope you  won't take me to court for it!
<P>
So far as I'm concerned a blow against free speech of this sort on  the Internet is a blow against the Freedom of the Press.
<P>
Yours sincerely,
<P>
Ian Ballard.

Dear Mr Wishart,
<P>
As expat Shetlanders with many relatives around the world we are  appalled at your recent action against the Shetland News.
<P>
You obviously have no understanding of the World Wide Web. Your  behaviour is ridiculous  and pathetic. What is worse is that it brings down the name of The  Shetland Times and questions the intelligence of Shetland islanders  re the outside world!
<P>
For God's sake, stop being so stupid. A great many people, including  ourselves, will no longer be accessing the Shetland Times pages if  this idiotic childishness continues.

 Dear Shetland News,
<P>
I am writing in to support your right to be able to freely show links  to other Web sites (inc. Shetland Times). A link to a Shetland Times  story is in my estimation the equivalent of reading one newspaper,  and it telling you to read "headline" on page xxx of other newspaper. 
<P>
In simple terms you are just referencing their material, not  reproducing it, therefore keeping within the bounds of copyright law.
<P>
If you can use this letter of support to help your case, then please  feel free to do so.

Dear Sir
<P>
I heard with dismay about the current conflict between you and the  Shetland Times.  Such a thing in a small community seems absurd  especially considering the ramifications which come to bear on the  whole idea of the internet being a medium with a free exchange of  information.  What a shame that this could not have been settled  between the two parties without resorting to the courts.
<P>
I should like to draw your attention to links which we have set up  which show what a ridiculous situation this is.  Several months ago,  William Sandison from Shetland Litho/The Shetland Times asked me if I  would set up a link from our knitwear brochure (which acknowledges  that it is printed by Shetland Litho (part of the Shetland Times  organisation) and in return they would link from their publicity to  us.  They must have been aware that the Shetland News had a link to  us so by extrapolation the links run as follows: Shetland News linked  to us, we are linked to Shetland Litho and Shetland Litho is linked to  the Shetland Times. Or at least, as far as I am aware all these links  are in place and if not, they were intended to be.
<P>
In addition, if the system of linking is ruled to be causing a breach  of copyright then will we have to sue all those people who put links,  unbeknownst to us, to our brochure? Surely the system of links is  meant to draw people's attention to your web-site and not to detract from it?
<P>
I trust that this situation is clarified soon,..., otherwise the free exchange of information  will not be able to continue.
<P>
Yours sincerely

Dear Editor,
<P>
   As you know, I've been following with interest your dispute with the Shetland Times about your past inclusion of Web links to that newspaper.  In response to your query about precedents in America, I know of no interdiction of Web linking except in the "Dilbert" case, in which the Web author actually incorporated the copyrighted contents of another site into his own Web page format, giving the appearance that the content resided at his own site.  I am not an expert on U.K. copyright regulations, but it is my view that in the U.S., copyright law simply would not apply to a situation such as yours, since no copying was done by you or your newspaper.
<P>
   In one of your editorials, you mentioned your concern that a threatened action against your paper might be intended to cause unbearable legal expenses, even if unsuccessful.  Over here, such an action is known as a SLAPP suit, which stands for Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation.  Such suits are frequently filed against individuals and small businesses in order to prevent the publication of letters to newspapers, presentations at public meetings of legislative bodies, etc.  The billboard industry ("outdoor advertizing" in its own terminology) is notorious for filing such suits to suppress community support for billboard-banning local ordinances.  If you've traveled in America, you'll no doubt appreciate how widespread and successful this tactic has become.
<P>
   As a faithful reader of both Shetland newspapers, let me express my hope that this dispute can be settled quickly and on a basis rooted in the realities of the Internet.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>

<P>
Dear Dr Wills,
<P>
I am rather new to the Internet and so perhaps I have misunderstood what has been happening between you and the management of The Shetland Times. As I see it, you have included in the SN one or more links to the ST and that this action has been construed, by them, as breach, by you, of the ST's copyright.
<P>
Irrespective of legal technicalities (of which I am in even greater ignorance than of the Internet) it appears to me that you have actually provided, by way of these links, two useful services: you have given your readers easy access to another, no less valuable, net site and you have given the ST a little more publicity than it would otherwise have had.
<P>
It would be pressing matters too far perhaps for you actually to ask the ST to pay for what amounts to free advertising but, were I the operator of a major independent website, I would be glad of, and encouraged by, any links to my site that other interested operators might put in theirs.
<P>
I write as one who values both the SN and the ST and indeed I have been a regular reader and intermittent contributor to the ST for a good many years.
<P>
I hope that this matter is soon to be resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned - especially the readers upon whom both publications depend.
<P>
Yours sincerely,

We have  asked our lawyers to tell The Shetland Times that, if they care to  ask the court to lift the interdict, and if they pay all costs, we  are happy to let byegones be byegones. There is room for both  publications and scope for co-operation (and friendly rivalry)  between them. But we cannot and will not give up the right to post  links to the pages of other publications.

<P>
  I have just made one of the most enjoyable connections on the internet I  could ever imagine; a connection to Shetland. You can't imagine how  fantastic it feels to be able to re-connect with the greatest experience in  all my life.
<P>
 In 1970, I was assigned to duty at the US Coast Guard Base in Scatsta Brae  near Sullom Voe. I lived with my wife, Elizabeth, in a small cottage called  Boden in Stromfirth. We absolutely loved (and still love) your wonderful  islands and all our wonderful Shetland friends. The Hunters, the Robertsons,  and all our neighbors in Stromfirth were without a doubt the warmest and  most endearing friends I have ever met. The fourteen months we lived in  Shetland are still fresh in my mind, and so wonderful that they are almost  dreamlike today. When I received my orders to return to the US, I was faced  with the most difficult task I have ever had to perform - leaving Shetland.  Even though I physically left, my heart has always remained in Shetland. 
<P>
 Many years have gone by, as have many failed plans to return to Shetland.  And now I have a chance to once again return to your beautiful islands. It  is not quite the same as being there, but through the internet, your  newspaper articles and pictures have again made that connection to my heart.  I am forever grateful. Thank you, your web page, all the wonderful people of  Shetland, and all the wonderful memories of Shetland that I hold so dearly.
<P>
 If anyone would like to contact me, feel free to email me at  teltecmace@worldnet.att.net. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to  renew contact with old friends and meet new ones as well. I am also  interested in any information concerning what happened to the US Coast Guard  base at Scatsta, as well as the whereabouts of any others who were stationed  there in 1970-71.

<STRONG>General Situation at 12:00 UTC 08/01/97, with Inference</STRONG><BR>

An anticyclone of 1018 mb over Scotland is expected Faeroe, with little change, by midday Thursday. A large area of high pressure extending from Iceland into eastern Europe will persist. 
<p>

A low of 988 mb in Finisterre is expected 1002 mb southern France by the same time.  An Atlantic low will move rapidly east, expected north-east Spain also by the same time. Later in the day, as an occluding Atlantic frontal system pushes north-east across Biscay, SE'ly winds are expected to strengthen across southern areas.
<p>

Pressure is expected to remain high across northern areas during Thursday and Friday.
<p>

There is the likelihood that, during Friday and Saturday, southern areas may see a period of snow - or possibly freezing rain - as the occlusion pushes on into England and Wales. This should gradually turn to rain as much milder conditions move in. The north of Scotland should stay fine and dry, though with a freshening E'ly wind, until late on Saturday.
<p>

Over the weekend the high pressure may transfer south-east into eastern Europe and, with pressure low over the eastern Atlantic, mild S'ly winds are likely across much of the UK.

<STRONG>3-day outlook for the Northern Isles (Thursday - Saturday)</STRONG><BR>

Daytime temperatures 3&#176; to 5&#176; Celsius, 0&#176; to 2&#176; Celsius overnight. Coastal areas are likely to remain virtually frost-free, but a ground frost is likely to be widespread inland. Areas of 'black ice' may develop on untreated roads left wet by any overnight showers - especially should skies clear. 
<p>

<B>THURSDAY:</B> Remaining generally settled with variable amounts of cloud and a few scattered showers over the North Isles. Winds are expected to be F1-3 NE'ly.
<br>
<B>Swell</B> - N'ly at 1 metre.
<p>

<B>FRIDAY:</B> A fine, frosty start with bright periods, scattered wintry showers and light winds. Becoming cloudier during the afternoon and evening as the wind increases F4 SE'ly by the end of the day.
<br>
<B>Swell</B> - N'ly at 2 to 3 metres.
<p>

<B>SATURDAY:</B> Cloudy, but mostly dry at first with a F4 SE'ly wind. Rain and sleet, preceeded by snow over the higher hills, spreading north through Caithness around midday. At the same time the SE'ly winds, backing ESE'ly, will be increasing F6-7, possibly touching gale F8 over exposed hills and headlands.

<STRONG>Extended Outlook for the Northern Isles (Sunday - Saturday)</STRONG> - <I>Confidence level is low.</I>
<br>
Mild, with temperatures around 6&#176; to 8&#176; Celsius.
<p>

<B>SUNDAY:</B> Mild and cloudy with mist, periods of rain and a F5-7 ESE'ly wind at first. Becoming a little drier and brighter later as the wind veers S to SW'ly.
<p>

<B>MONDAY - SATURDAY:</B> Generally cloudy, with outbreaks of rain at times and a strong S to SW'ly wind. Continuing mild.

<h2>4/1/97</h2>

The Tresta <b>KING EIDER</b> was at Sandsound Voe today, and the 2 male <b>KING EIDERS</b> are still in Mousa Sound. In addition <b>2 VELVET SCOTERS</b> are in Tresta Voe along with <b>18 SLAVONIAN GREBES</b>, 6 unseasonal <b>RED-THROATED DIVERS</b>, and <b>4 GREAT NORTHERN DIVERS</b>.

<P>

The <b>SPERM WHALE</b> carcass is still on the rocks at Sand.

<P><HR><P>

<h2>3/1/97</h2>

A dead <b>SPERM WHALE</b> has washed up onto the rocks alongside the old church on the shoreline at Sand (near Garderhouse), on da west side. It is starting to decompose with no skin left on its body although it is still fairly intact, especially around the tail which is still complete. It is about 40-50 feet in length and has apparently been floating around in the sea in the general area for the last month or so. 
<P>
Although its just about impossible to tell, it is almost certainly a male as female Sperm Whales never wander far from tropical or subtropical waters, but the males often venture north even into polar waters. In fact all but one of the strandings in this country have been males.
<P> 
To see it, drive down to the old church and graveyard at Sand and walk along the side of the graveyard heading towards the mouth of the voe (west - away from the beach). It is on the rocks about 100 feet past the graveyard.

<P>
<P>
Mistress Mana Berg being in a great 'stoor' in her pantry this morning, a-preparing of sweetmeats, sundry victuals and ale for the feast of Our Blessed Saviour's Nativity, I did not at first remark upon an unusual noise emanating from the brigstanes. But at length the commotion became so clamorous that I was obliged to rise from my escritoire and open the door of my study, intending gently to reprove the good woman and inquire whether she would be so kind as to refrain from her labours for an hour's length, that I might compose my sermon without further distraction, my topick for Christmas Eve being the folly and vanity of all our striving in this sorry world, and the spiritual necessity of preparing oneself for the Day of Judgment.
<P>
The scene that I beheld resembled the Day of Judgment itself. For there, in a cloud of dust, stood the unmistakable figures of Young Grinnyskull and Dicka Nastigirth, each bearing a monstrous flagstone upon his back, to add to the growing pile of slabs resting in my vestibule. Mistress Berg was remonstrating with them, gesticulating, and adamantly repulsing their insistent demands for 'wan peerie moothlufter'.
<P>
Interposing myself betwixt the combatants, I bade Mistress Berg fetch a  flagon of porter and indicated to the two young rascals that I wished to interview them privily in my chambers. Meek as lambs, they followed.
<P>
Young Grinnyskull presently explained: 'Da Commeeshnersis wantinstonn furdastritta Lerook an da young mesteraKeldybuster's kerryinonlikk smokk afforda Nesseens irda Hollanders winninapoda tredd.'
<P>
'Yea, feth,' his accomplice vouchsafed, 'Anwirrbin biddenta oppinda aald wharry idda Hollada Boogers pa' Bard. Datsda verrrabest stonnfurda chob, dusees.'
<P>
'Anwirrhockit ankerried aamoarneen anwitowtwi widdchoost laywis byfrastert aside dee, bitshoosno waantinwis,' Young Grinnyskull added, indicating the glowering form of my housekeeper who, despite her manifest displeasure, had indeed borne two flagons of refreshment from the cellar.
<P>
'Biddalooksa yuntwa lippers, meenister, wanill likklyno be anyoch!' she  said, and turned on her heel, slamming the door with such force that a domestic ornament - a painted clay figurine of an Eider Duck, given me by the good Cap'n Dooswelfrimsel, to mark the launch of his new bark 'Denter' - fell from its shelf and shattered upon the floor.
<P>
Mistress Berg's prediction proved accurate. It was late evening before the fifth flagon was consumed and the lads staggered away down the sheeps' gait with their back burdens, in the general direction of the noost below Mistress Lindatimber's establishment, whence the precious cargo was to be ferried to the great works upon the main thoroughfare of our county town.
<P>
I did not regret their visit for, having been much at Lerook upon their errands with samples of the Breezey flagstones over the past weeks, they were able to impart many intelligences concerning publick affairs, which might otherwise have escaped me, I having been confined to my manse with a fit of the vapours of late.
<P>
What they had to tell was alarming in the extreme. It appears that the junto of seditious malcontents who for so long have vexed our wise and benevolent governor, Mr Black Mekkie, have now succeeded so far in their turbulent scheming as to induce him to consider resigning his benefice. Sir Jas Bloob, ever Mr Black Mekkie's closest confidant, is said to be arranging a suitably handsome <I>ex gratia </I>honorarium to ensure that the great man shall not be quartered upon the parish in his dotage.
<P>
An aura of gloom and despond surrounds the once lightsome halls of the local authority, where in happier times mummers and fiddlers were frequent guests of Mr Black Mekkie, the most notable patron of the musical arts these islands have ever known. 
<P>
All of Mr Black Mekkie's personal retinue are concerned anent their future employment with the Commissioners of Supply. Messrs Smeeg and Risible bear the look of hunted men. Other flunkeys, once upon familiar terms with the Omnipotent, now avoid his gaze and scuttle around the skirts of Mistress Lorta Carnaptions, the Commissioner for Whalesahoy and Pendicles, whose favour they hope to gain under the new administration. 
<P>
Mr Pall, who formerly regulated the emptying of slop buckets, the cleansing of the publick wells and the inspection of cooked viands, is entirely disaffected and has lost all interest in his duties, or such duties as were left him after King George's men of business had appropriated sundry responsibilities to their retainers in the rotten burgh of Noswasepa, upon the continent of Scotland.  Mr Pall has expressed himself desirous of departing the Commissioners' service, if appropriate terms can be arranged. It is understood that there is some enthusiasm for this upon the part of the Commissioners, who had already decided to dispense with Mr Pall's services and hire but a single clerk to administer the wells, stanks, cart roads and applications for commercial alms.
<P>
I am informed that Mistress Hazel Nethergreen, the keeper of the Privy Chambers, was visibly distressed when her superior was impertinently called to account by Mr Bertram Blackguard, the Commissioner for Helliness, who dared to demand that he be furnished with details of the elaborate arrangements for preventing eavesdropping at the Toon Hoose, where matters of great moment are oft discussed in seclusion when Mr Black Mekkie grants audience to principals in His Majesty's Ministry and, indeed, to the gentlemen adventurers of the British Peat Oil Company and the Shalloot Corporation, to the incalculable, if necessarily unseen, advantage of the commons of Zetland.
<P>
It is being put about, by Sir Jas Bloob's serving wenches below the Toon Hoose stairs, that Canon Shand was entirely ignorant of the 27,000 pounds Scots expended by Mr Black Mekkie upon ear trumpets, trip-wires, man-traps, night-watchmen and concealed scribes. The authority for the works was entirely that of Sir Aidie Pleep, now out of office and compiling a memoir of his decades in the cockpit of political oeconomy, which is expected to be a massive quarto of some 800,000 wise words.
<P>
Sir Adie Pleep, being accosted and questioned upon Da Stritt by some vulgar and disrespectful septuagenarians, is said to have replied: 'Manmanman, dukeens, wichoost heddta duit, brrrm, hmmph, whitwi'dat Dr Garlick rinnin' amok. Daboggerwis gettincloss, aafilcloss. Rrmph. Wididna keen whit he micht du neist!'
<P>
This is taken to be a reference to the panick induced in the Toon Hoose by the elevation to a commissionership, ephemeral as it turned out, of the notorious Dr Witney Garlick, some years past. Dr Garlick is but rarely seen these days, Dicka Nastigirth confided, being entirely taken up with his new 'evanescent publishing machine' which employs the latest calculating engines, new-brought from our former American colonies. My printers and I trust this venture will founder in the same impecuniary confusion as his previous incarnations, and have taken certain measures at law to ensure that this comes about.
<P>
Young Grinnyskull's opinion was that Commissioner Blackguard had been emboldened in his attack on the viceroy by the sudden appearance in publick office of the but recently disgraced Mr Nicol Jonpy, whose spendthrift profligacy, masquerading as benevolence to the poorer classes, Mr Black Mekkie had been obliged to rein in, lest the coffers be entirely emptied and no specie remain to support indigent carp-farmers, such as Mr Francis Fishybizz, the Master of Laxfirth and Skattland Point.
<P>
Last month Mr Jonpy, brazen as ever, had the impudence to present himself to the electors of Soothyale for a casual vacancy upon the Commission of Supply. The island being remote from reliable political intelligences and wanting a licensed town crier of its own, the inhabitants were naturally insensible of the true condition of our Zetland commonwealth and, foolishly, were induced to return Mr Jonpy with a handsome plurality of the ballots. 
<P>
The calculated offence was compounded by the irksome necessity of Mr Black Mekkie counting the votes in person at the rude bothy or 'side school' which served as polling place for that tiresome and depopulated district. Upon the result being declared, he was further constrained by constitional propriety actually to shake the hand of the unwelcome interloper. 
<P>
Mr Black Mekkie's words of congratulation were suitably muted and inaudible to the throng of bonnet lairds and idle peasantry who had assembled to witness this extraordinary reverse in his fortunes.  One ignorant boor, employed in the Commissioners' service upon the bigging up of brigs and slaps, was even heard to remark: 'Disseldoofurda aald deevilnoo! Fur Mester Chonnpy keenswhaarda bonns is hoided.' It is greatly to be regretted that the rancelman in attendance was unable to identify and apprehend the offender, who will undoubtedly have his publick emoluments terminated, should he be taken before the Committee of Discipline. 
<P>
I would despair of our prospects of civil government, were it not for the efforts of Commissioner Wullamandra Whitret, who grows daily in stature and <I>gravitas</I> and may soon be estimated amongst the true worthies of our society. His custodianship of the Common Good Fund has been exemplary, with vast quantities of treasure bestowed liberally upon every gentleman merchant and manufacturer who will bestir himself to append his signature to the necessary parchments. Commissioner Whitret's conduct, on those occasions when his ministrations were questioned by vulgar scribblers such as Mr Garry Luss, the Olsterman, has been much admired by those of the Quality.
<P>
Only last week, when interrogated anent the desperate condition of the poor's dwellings, the parochial schools and the Lerook Wet Docks Commission, Mr Whitret responded unhesitatingly: 'Weel, weel, I dunnakeen bit feth dey'll choost haeta makkda bestoa beddchob an dirnaethin mairtabi seddabootit, du keens.'
<P>
Methinks I detect a budding greatness in Mr Whitret, whose full flowering I trust we shall shortly see, after Mr Black Mekkie goes to enjoy his well-earned rest at Fort Acolyte where, I am told, a company of wandering minstrels, Darridvans, has already been engaged to serenade his declining years.

<H2>How to trace your island ancestors and long-lost cousins</H2>
<HR>
<P>
</center>

<P>Readers often ask if we can help them trace relations in Shetland. 
This is not surprising because there are probably as many people with 
Shetland connections living outside the islands as there are in 
Shetland. And more and more of them are on the Net.
<P>They don't have the knowledge, skills or resources (yet!) to give your 
queries the detailed attention they deserve. But we know people who do.
<P>The Shetland Family History Society is a group of enthusiastic but 
entirely unpaid volunteers. They'll help you if and when they can 
but, because of the huge interest in Shetland genealogy worldwide, 
they can't promise a reply by return.
<P>You can reach the society, by snail-mail only , at the following address:

<H1>The Internet copyright case 
</H1>
<H2>and its implications for users of the WWW</H2>
by <A HREF="mailto:CHARLES@dmu.ac.uk">Professor Charles Oppenheim</A>, 6th December 1996

<P>
<CENTER><U><B>The background to the case</B></U></CENTER>
<P>
On 24 October 1996, Lord Hamilton gave  in a Scottish court a preliminary interdict (equivalent to injunction in English law) to prevent the <I>Shetland News</I>, an Internet based newspaper, from offering links from its WWW pages to those of its rival  Internet newspaper, the <I>Shetland Times</I>.   Right now, the <I>Shetland News</I> is appealing for funds to help fight the case in 1997. 
<P>
 The wording of the interdict includes the following key text (I trust I am not infringing copyright by reproducing it):
<P>
"... Interdicts the Defenders, their employees, agents or  anyone acting on their behalf or with their authority from (1.)  storing in any medium by electronic means or otherwise copying or  (2.) including in any service operated by the Defenders on the  Internet any headline, text or photograph from any edition of "The  Shetland Times" newspaper or the Pursuers' Internet web site  WWW.Shetland-Times.Co.UK..."
<P>
<CENTER>-------</CENTER>
<P>
Robert Wishart, the  managing director of The Shetland Times Ltd. commented on this preliminary injunction with the following statement: 
<P>
"Recent statements by Dr Jonathan Wills (the Editor of the Shetland News)  are an attempt to lay down a smoke-screen over the issues.  We took action to prevent him presenting our news stories as part of his web site. These stories are gathered by professional staff at considerable expense to the company.
<P>
"Put simply, this is an argument over whether a publisher on the Internet retains copyright in any material once it goes "on-line". My view is that by incorporating our copyright material into his news service he infringes our copyright. The technical process by which this is achieved is irrelevant.
<P>
"How Dr Wills arrives at the conclusion that the ruling makes the Internet in its present form illegal I don't know. There is no restriction on "free" access to the Internet and we would be perfectly happy with a proper link to our home page so that readers can have access to our reports in their intended context.
<P>
"Our successful action at the Court of Session demonstrates that this is by no means a "frivolous" action as claimed by Dr Wills. On the contrary it is a case which will be of vital interest to every publisher on the Internet. Had our action failed it would have meant that the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 would no longer apply to any material published on the Internet.
<P>
"I have every confidence that if Dr Wills wishes to pursue the matter we will receive support from other publishers on the Internet. 
<P>
"It is quite clear that Shetland News were driven to this action because they were unable to provide a proper news service on their own. In the meantime we will continue to develop our Internet site as a quality product.
<P>
"Dr Wills' attempts to use his web site to generate nuisance mail and phone calls is exactly the sort of infantile action I have come to expect from him. We really should be arguing about the principles involved. As a part-time journalist himself one would have thought he would have some understanding of the protection which copyright laws offer to writers and publishers."
<P>
<CENTER>-------</CENTER>
<P>
A lot of fuss has been made regarding this interim injunction, with headlines about "this means the death of the Web".  Nonsense.  Where the grant of an interlocutory injunction is concerned, the party seeking the injunction undertakes to provide compensation should that matter proceed to trial.  Therefore,  the court can afford to be "generous"  in its ability to grant interim injunctions, <B>as all the court  considers is whether there is an issue to be tried</B>, and then considers  the "balance of convenience". It does not consider the rights and wrongs of the case in terms of  matters of law.  So the preliminary injunction is simply a confirmation that there is a possible case to answer - and indeed, as the discussion below shows, there may indeed theoretically be a case to answer!
<P>
<CENTER><U><B>The first question:  are these Literary Works?</B></U></CENTER>
<P>
There is the background.  What are the implications of this little spat, which has received wide publicity, including an article in New Scientist and an item on BBC TV News on 6 December?  The first thing to be aware of, is that the two individuals concerned, Dr Wills and Mr Wishart, have a long history of disputes; some years ago Jonathan Wills was editor of The Shetland Times, and was dismissed, which resulted in an out-of-court settlement, paid by Robert Wishart to Dr Wills, to prevent a hearing for unfair dismissal. So, it is clear this argument is as much to do with personalities as it is to do with copyright.  But what about the rights and wrongs of the case?
<P>
Under copyright law, even storing the text of material temporarily on a hard disc is, technically, infringement.  Certain proposals being discussed by WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organisation -  the body that largely controls international copyright law) in  December  in Geneva would, if passed,  make this even more explicit but the truth  is, UK law is already pretty explicit on this point anyway.  (I will write an article for Ariadne  on the WIPO conference in due course.)  However,  in order for infringement to be proved, the person making the complaint must prove that his material is indeed a Literary Work as defined in the Copyright Act, that the defendant had copied all, or a substantial part of that Literary Work, and that none of the standard user permissions applied.  The complainant must also demonstrate that there was no implied license to copy the material.
<P>
The defendants  "simply" linked their Web pages to those of the other company. The user clicks on the hypertext link and is transferred to the other newspaper's pages.  They were not copying the full text of the articles;  only the URL and the title of the article. 
<P>
So the first hurdle for Mr Wishart is to demonstrate that his URLs and the headlines of his articles are "Literary Works" and are therefore worthy of copyright protection.  This is not an insignificant hurdle!  A work needs to have some substance to enjoy copyright.  Many UK Court cases have confirmed that to quote or copy  a part of a sentence,  or a single word, is never infringement.   Song titles and advertising slogans cannot enjoy copyright.   Can a single sentence, such as a newspaper headline, enjoy copyright?  This probably depends on the length and uniqueness of the sentence.  Looking at the headlines that were copied in this case, I would doubt very much that they would enjoy copyright, but it is just possible that they would.
<P>
What about the URLs?  It is well established in UK law that there is no copyright in a single fact, although there is copyright in a compilation of facts.  Since the number of URLs copied by the defendants represents only a very small proportion of the total number of URLs on the complainant's WWW pages, it is unlikely that any action claiming there was infringement of  copyright in a database of URLs would succeed.
<P>
So, to sum up this stage of the argument:  it is possible, but unlikely, that the single sentences in question would be regarded as copyright;  it is possible, but unlikely, that the small number of URLs copied out of the large number possible would be considered sufficient significant that a substantial part of the database of URLs (which, being a compilation, is a Literary Work worthy of copyright) had been copied.  In any case, I am not sure that Mr Wishart had developed a clearly identified database of URLs;  it is far more likely that they simply were individually associated with particular stories;  if that is the case, then the defendants were entitled to copy these facts to their heart's content.
<P>
So Round 1 may go Mr Wishart's way in the full Court hearing, but this is not certain. 
<P>
<CENTER><U><B>The second question - is there a defence? </B></U></CENTER>
<P>
But this is not the end of the story.  Even if Mr Wishart can prove the material in question is copyright, he now has to overcome the defences that the defendants will suggest.  These are:  were we entitled to copy under "fair dealing" and/or  there was an implied license to copy?
<P>
One can "fair deal" - in other words one can copy a Literary Work without having to ask permission or pay a fee - as long as it is indeed "fair" (in other words, does not damage the legitimate commercial interests of the copyright owner) <B>and</B> as long as the copying is for one of several permitted purposes. It must pass both tests to be permitted.  In a section below ("What if Mr Wishart wins?"), I consider the financial damage to the complainants, and conclude they have suffered no financial damage.  So the defendants pass the first test.  They also pass the second, because one of the permitted purposes for fair dealing is for "reporting current events".  The Courts have shown themselves generally sympathetic to newspapers that copy for this purpose,  because they have a concern that freedom of speech will be prejudiced if newspapers cannot report current events.  It is normal too, for one newspaper to have an "exclusive" and for other papers to copy the material in later editions;  this is considered to be fair dealing.  
<P>
I would therefore conclude that the defendants have a cast iron defence of fair dealing.
<P>
What about the question of implied licences?  It is a defence against an infringement action that there was a clear implied license to copy.  If I write a letter to the Editor of <I>Ariadne</I>, there is an implied licence for the editor to reproduce that letter in the journal.  In general, as regular readers of this column will know, I warn against relying on this as a defence, as it is only rarely applicable.  However, this may be a case where it is applicable.  Consider the facts:
<P>
The  copyright owner made a deliberate choice to  place his Web site online, with full knowledge (presumably) of  how the system operates.  Linking of Web sites to one another is extremely common and is, arguable, both the <I>raison d'etre</I> of the WWW and the reason for its success.   It is custom and practice, and so if a copyright owner puts up a Web site, he MUST expect others to link into his site.  Services such as Web search engines could not operate without this ability.
<P>
When someone opens a shop, they expect people to walk into the shop. Customers do not have to get permission from the shop owner, to go inside,  <B>even though they are entering private property</B>. Permission is inferred, by the presence of the shop, and that the door is unlocked. This is how most shops operate by custom and practice. If you don't wish people to walk into your open shop, you should clearly state that fact, at the shop's entrance.
<P>
When someone opens a public  WWW site,  they  must expect  people to put links into their site, and for them to put links to other sites. The system was designed to work like this. Permission for any links (I think) is therefore granted by implication, owing to the  very  presence of  that site. If you do not wish to have such links made, you should clearly state this fact, at your web site's entrance.
<P>
I have said it many times in presentations and in articles, but I will say it again: if a copyright owner is worried that his material will be copied on the Web, he has one simple choice: <B>do not put your material up on the Web!</B>
<P>
<CENTER><U><B>Summing up the case</B></U></CENTER>
<P>
So, to sum up my view of the case;  it is possible - just possible - that the Court at its full hearing will agree the text copied is worthy of copyright protection.  Even if it does decide this, the defendants have two excellent defences - that they were fair dealing, and that there was an implied license to copy.  In my view, the defendants have a 99.999% chance of winning their case.  But what if I am wrong?
<P>
<CENTER><U><B> What if Mr Wishart wins?</B></U></CENTER>
<P>
Copyright law allows for two things - an injunction, and damages.  An injunction stops the guilty party from continuing to infringe.  To claim damages, the complainant must either demonstrate a loss of sales or profits, or must demonstrate that the defendant had made profits out of his infringement.  Since both the newspapers are available for free on the Internet, there seems to be no basis at all for suing for damages.  Copyright law also makes certain actions liable for criminal penalties;  these include deliberate piracy (selling infringing goods), or malicious intent to damage the sales  or market position of the injured party.  Since neither party is, as far as I know,  making income out of their respective Internet offerings, criminal issues do not enter the case.  As far as market size is concerned,  Dr Wills' paper had, according to data I have seen, the lions' share of accesses and was, in effect, giving free advertising to Mr Wishart's paper. (The <I>Shetland News</I> is read 4,500 to 8,000 times a day, whereas the <I>Shetland Times</I> site was only getting around 500 to 600 hits a day.) They gave Mr Wishart's paper a bigger readership, and as such were positively enhancing their market position. (For the short time the links were in place, the <I>Shetland Times</I> hit rate reached 1,000 per day.) The defendants are the bigger, and stronger Web site in terms of readership, world-wide coverage, advertisers, etc. The <I>Shetland Times</I> had no advertisers paying them at the time of the action, whereas the <I>Shetland News</I> had several. Incidentally, the <I>Shetland News</I>  went live on the Internet in November 1995, and the <I>Shetland Times</I>  in March 1996. 
<P>
So in practice, if the <I>Shetland Times</I> wins, it would not win money, but would win the injunction.  This, of course, would have a "chilling" effect on the development of the WWW in the UK.  (The decision would have no effect abroad.)  People would be reluctant to put links between their service and any other WWW pages for fear of problems based on the precedent.  This could seriously damage the development of Internet services such as search engines, as well as WWW developers generally.  Whilst not going as far as some commentators have on this topic, I have no doubt it would seriously damage the long term development of the WWW in the UK.  That is not, of course, a problem for the Courts. They take no regard of such issues;  they just look at the niceties of the case in hand.  
<P>
<CENTER><U><B>Finally</B></U></CENTER>
<P>
You may wonder if Moral Rights apply to this case, as I discuss them so often.  They do not;  the Copyright Act makes it  clear they do not apply to material appearing in newspapers, magazines or periodicals. 
<P>
The Shetland Times is at  &lt;..(sorry we are not permitted to put up this link - <I>The Shetland News</I>)..&gt;
<P>
The Shetland News is at   <A HREF="http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/">http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/</A>
<P>
Finally, I am quite prepared for the possibility that either party might sue me for infringing the copyright in their URL, or in any of the public statements they have made.

 6th December 1996
<P>
Shetland Times boss Robert Wishart today (FRI) attacks the National  Union of Journalists for supporting The Shetland News in the Internet  links court case and accuses Shetland News editor Jonathan Wills of  being a cynical, hysterical and unprofessional parasite.
<P>
In a statement to the BBC's legal correspondent, Joshua Rozenberg, Mr  Wishart said: 
<P>
'We asked Shetland News to stop using our copyright material on their  news service but they refused. We were clearly left with no  alternative but to resort to legal channels. We regret this, but the  terms of their reply left no room for discussion.
<P>
'Recent comments on the implications for the future of the internet  have been grossly overstated in the increasingly hysterical and  cynical 'Press Releases' put out by Shetland News. We have no  intention or desire to restrict 'free access' to material published  on the internet. Both Shetland News and Shetland Times copy remains  available to anyone who wants it. The action does not restrict the  legitimate use of the internet such as viewing web pages, linking  sites, or any other "normal" internet activity.
<P>
'Our action is solely to protect our company and its employees from a  parasitic activity which, allowed to run unchecked, would make it  impossible for publishers to reap the rewards of their efforts and  destroy the principle of copyright on any material published on the internet.
<P>
'I understand that the National Union of Journalists supports this  unprofessional behaviour and deplore the union's involvement in an  argument between two commercial organisations. This is totally at  odds with the interests of NUJ members at The Shetland Times,' the  Shetland Times managing director said.
<P>
Dr Wills commented: 'Sadly, it is clear that Mr Wishart still does  not understand how the Internet works. His personal remarks would be  actionable, were they not so hilariously funny.
<P>
'There is still time for him to accept the generous offer we have  made to settle this dispute out of court. It is hardly in the  interests of my NUJ colleagues at The Shetland Times to have their  employer wasting large sums on lawyers in this futile and destructive  court action. The money might be better used to reward his staff.'
<P>
Mr Rozenberg's report on the test case, filmed in Shetland over the  past two days, is scheduled to appear at 1pm, 6pm and 9pm on BBC1 television news today, and on the BBC TV World Service at various times throughout the day.

<P>
The following is the full text of Lord Hamilton's written reasons for  granting an interim interdict (temporary legal ban) to <I>The Shetland  Times Ltd</I> on 24th October 1996 to prevent <I>The Shetland News</I> making  free links to their site.
<P>
The court is expected to hear a full legal debate on the case some  time in the New Year.

<P>
<B><CENTER>Opinion of Lord Hamilton in the case of The Shetland Times Ltd</B>  <BR><I>against</I> <BR><B>Dr Jonathan Wills and Zetnews Ltd.</CENTER></B>
<P>
Court of Session, 
<BR>Edinburgh
<P>
24 October 1996
<P>
The pursuers (The Shetland Times Ltd) own and publish The Shetland  Times, a newspaper which carries local, national and international  news. The second defenders (Zetnews Ltd) provide a news reporting  service and trade under the name The Shetland News. The first  defender (Dr Jonathan Wills) is the managing director of the second defenders.
<P>
In The Shetland Times there appear news items comprising texts under  relative headlines. Photographs also appear. In the issue of The  Shetland Times printed on Friday, 11 October 1996, there appeared an  item, running to several paragraphs, concerning financial difficulties  about the Fraser Peterson Centre in Shetland. It appeared under the  headline 'Bid to save centre after council finding 'cock up''. A  number of other items also appeared in that issue, each under a  relative headline.
<P>
The lnternet is a world-wide electronic system used for the exchange  of information. Such information may include advertising material.  Information is accessed through computers in conjunction with the  telephone system. Persons wishing to impart information or to  advertise on the Internet can do so by establishing for themselves a  'web site'. Access to the information available at a web site is  gained by callers accessing a relative 'web address'.
<P>
The pursuers have recently established such a web site. By this means  they make available on the Internet items, including photographs,  which appear in printed editions of The Shetland Times. Such items  are stored electronically by reference to an index of relative  headlines, being the headlines which appear above those items in the  printed issues. Access to the text of the printed items is gained by  the caller clicking on the relative headline which appears on a  'front page'. The front page is the display which first appears on  access being gained to the pursuers' web site. The pursuers' front  page bears the heading 'The Shetland Times'. On an item being  accessed there appears below the text a note in the following terms:
<P>
'Contacting The Shetland Times'
<P>
'Comments or suggestions on this server (sic) please to  webmaster@shetland-times.co.uk'.
<P>
The pursuers have expended resources in establishing this web site.  It is their expectation that, once this information service becomes  known to and is used by Internet users, the pursuers will he able to  sell advertising space on the front page on their web site.
<P>
The defenders also operate a web site with a relative web address.  The front page accessed by callers at that web address is headed 'The  Shetland News' and sub-headed 'Main Headline Page'. A number of  advertisements appear on that page.
<P>
Beneath those are a number of news headlines.
<P>
Since about 14 October 1996 The defenders have included among the  headlines on their front page a number of headlines appearing in  recent issues of The Shetland Times as reproduced on the pursuers'  web site. These headline are verbatim reproductions of the pursuers'  headlines as so reproduced. A caller accessing the defenders' web  site may, by clicking on one of those headlines appearing on the  defenders' front page, gain access to the relative text as published  and reproduced by the pursuers. Access is so gained and subsequent  access to other such headlines also gained without the caller  requiring at any stage to access the pursuers' front page.
<P>
Thus, access to the pursuers' items (as published in printed editions  and reproduced by them on their web site) can he obtained by  by-passing the pursuers' front page and accordingly missing any  advertising material which may appear on it. 
<P>
In this action the pursuers seek declarator that the defenders'  actings constitute an infringement of copyright owned by them. The  case came before me on the pursuers' motion for interim interdict.
<P>
The grounds of action are twofold The pursuers maintain that the  headlines made available by them on their web site are cable  programmes within the meaning of section 7 of the Copyright. Designs  and Patents Act 1988 ('the Act'), that the facility made available by  the defenders on their web site is a cable programme service within  the meaning of section 7 and that the inclusion of those items in  that service constitutes an infringement of copyright under section  20 of the Act. The pursuers also maintain that the headlines are  literary works owned by them and that the defenders' activities  constitute infringement by copying under section 17 of the Act, the copying being in the form of storing the works by electronic means.
<P>
Miss Milligan for the pursuers maintained that in respect of each of  those grounds of action the pursuers had a prima facie case and that  the balance of convenience favoured the grant of interim interdict.  Mr MacLeod for the defenders maintained that the pursuers had no  prima facie case on either ground and that the balance of convenience  favoured the reftisal of interim interdict. 
<P>
Mr MacLeod did not dispute that copyright subsisted in the pursuers  in the text of items appearing in the printed editions of The  Shetland Times and in such texts therefrom as appeared on the  pursuers' web site. It was acknowledged that these were literary  works. It was, however, maintained that no copyright subsisted in the  headlines. I shall return to that issue in due course.   The  principal argument before me related to the alleged infringement  under section 20. This turned essentially on an interpretation of  section 7. That section, by sub-section (1), defines 'cable  programme' as meaning 'any item included in a cable programme  service' and defines 'cable programme service as meaning -  'a  service which consist wholly or mainly in sending visual images,  sounds or other information by means of a telecommunications system,  otherwise than by wireless telegraphy, for reception -
<P>
(a)   at two or more places (whether for simultaneous reception or at  different times in response to requests by different users). or
<P>
(b)   for presentation to members of the public, and which is not, or  so far as it is not, excepted by or under the following provisions of  this section.'
<P>
Sub-section (2) provides:
<P>
 'The following are excepted from the definition of 'cable programme service' (a)   a service or part of a service of which it is an essential  feature that while visual images, sounds or other information are  being conveyed by the person providing the service there will or may  be sent from each place of reception, by means of the same system or  (as the case may be) the same part of it, information (other than  signals sent for the operation or control of the service) for  reception by the person providing the service or other persons receiving it...'
<P>
Mr MacLeod for the defenders submitted (1) that the process involved  in Internet communication did not involve 'sending' information, (2)  that, if it did, the sending was in the circumstances done not by the  pursuers but by the defenders and (3) that, in any event, the service  was an 'interactive service excepted by sub-section (2)(a). 
<P>
No detailed technical information was put before me in relation to  the electronic mechanisms involved. It was simply submitted that  there was not 'sending' in an ordinary sense and that a contrast  could he made with cable television where there was sending by  transmission from the provider to the customer. On the Intemet a  caller electronically accessed information which was provided  entirely passively.
<P>
In my view the pursuers' contention that the service provided by them  involves the sending of information is prima facie well founded.  Although in a sense the information, it seems, passively awaits  access being had to it by callers, that does not, at least prima  fade, preclude the notion that the information, on such access being  taken, is conveyed to and received by the caller. If that is so, the  process may arguably be said to involve the sending of that information.
<P>
If the information is being sent, it prima facie is being sent by the  pursuers on whose web site it has been established. The fact that the  information is provided to the caller by his accessing it through the  defenders' web site does not, in my view, result in the defenders  being the persons sending the information.
<P>
As to the argument founded on section 7(2)(a), the contention was that, because it was possible for a caller to contact the pursuers by the  Internet and because comments and suggestions were encouraged by the  note below the text to be transmitted by this means, any cable  programme service was interactive and fell within the exception. It  was also submitted that information by way of comment and suggestion  could also be sent by this means to the defenders' web site. In my  view, it is plainly arguable that the exception does not apply. While  the facility to comment or make suggestions via the Internet exists,  this does not appear to me to be an essential element in the service,  the primary function of which is to distribute news and other items.  In any event, it is arguable that this facility is a severable part  of the pursuers' cable programme service.
<P>
The resolution of the above issues may in the end turn on technical  material not available to me at the hearing on interim interdict. On  the information that was available and on the basis of the arguments  presented, the pursuers have, in my opinion, a prima facie case that  the incorporation by the defenders in their web site of the headlines  provided at the pursuers' web site constitutes an infringement of  section 20 of the Act by the inclusion in a cable programme service  of protected cable programmes.
<P>
As to section 17, Mr MacLeod submitted that headlines such as 'Bid to  save centre after council finding `cock up'' and the other headlines  complained of in the Summons were not original literary works within  the meaning of the Act and that accordingly there was no infringement  in copying them by any means. It was submitted that there was not  such expenditure of skill or labour as to make any of them original  literary works; they were 'ordinary in the extreme'. Mr MacLeod did  not go so far as to submit that no newspaper headline could ever  attract copyright. His position was that those complained of did not.
<P>
I was not referred to any authority on this aspect. While literary  merit is not a necessary element of a literary work. there may be a  question  whether headlines, which are essentially brief indicators  of the subject matter of the items to which they relate, are  protected by copyright. However, in light of the concession that a  headline could be a literary work and since the headlines at issue  (or at least some of them) involve eight or so words designedly put  together for the purpose of imparting information, it appeared to me  to be arguable that there was an infringement, at least in some  instances, of section 17.
<P>
The balance of convenience clearly, in my view, favoured the grant of  interim interdict subject to certain amendments in the formulation of  the conclusion. The defenders' activities of which complaint is made  have just begun. It was not suggested that they would sustain any  loss if prevented ad interim from making use of the pursuers'  material in this way. It was fundamental to the setting up by the  pursuers of their web site that access to their material should be  gained only by accessing their web directly. While there has been no  loss to date, there is a clear prospect of loss of potential  advertising revenue in the foreseeable future. The extent of any loss  will be difficult to quantify. There was, in the circumstances, no  substance, in my view, in the suggestion that the pursuers were  gaining an advantage by their newspaper items being made available  more readily through the defenders' web site.
<P>
Certain amendments having been made to the second conclusion, I  granted interim interdict in terms of that conclusion as amended.

2nd December 1996
<P>
Hundreds of messages of support are flooding into 'The Shetland News'  offices from all over the world, as outraged readers protest against  court action taken by 'The Shetland Times' to ban links from our  pages to theirs.
<P>
'Shetland News' editor Jonathan Wills said last night (SUN): 'From  Australia to North America, and throughout Britain and Europe, the  message has been unanimous - deploring the resort to legal action.
<P>
'People are telling us that if 'The Shetland Times' wants to restrict  access to its pages and make all visitors pass through the home page  first, then all it has to do is put up a normal gateway on the site,  not drag us though a financially damaging action in the Court of Session.
<P>
'The Shetland Times Ltd say we've breached their copyright and they  maintain other Internet publishers support them. We've done no such  thing and not a single Internet publisher has come out publicly in  favour of the legal action,' Dr Wills said.
<P>
The UK <A HREF="http://gnew.gn.apc.org/media/nuj.html">National Union of Journalists</A> is backing Dr Wills, managing  director of 'Shetland News' publishers Zetnews Ltd, in defence of the  legal action, which is expected to be debated in court early next  year. But Dr Wills still has to pay personal legal bills of over  1,800 for initial court defences when the Court of Session in  Edinburgh ordered a temporary ban on links on October 24.
<P>
Donations to the legal defence fund have been coming in as  international media pick up on the story and its serious implications  for the future of free links on the World Wide Web.
<P>
'If this were just a personal spat, no-one would be interested,' Dr  Wills said. 'We're fighting this case for the important principle  involved and it's now clear we have overwhelming support from Net  users who know what they're talking about.
<P>
'Unfortunately, the workload of replying to every e-mail is now so  great that I can no longer cope with it and attend to my work on our  news site at the same time, quite apart from my other job as Shetland  correspondent for the national media. So I hope the many kind people  who write to me will understand if I don't reply immediately.
<P>
'The letters have been a great boost to all of us on 'The Shetland  News' during a very trying time. We didn't seek this conflict and  we've tried to settle it amicably, out of court, so we can get on  with developing our site and improving the service to readers.
<P>
'The response from the United States after<A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/"> 'The New York Times' </A> carried our story has been particularly heartwarming. It's good to  know we have so many friends and I thank them all sincerely on this  Thanksgiving weekend.'
<P>
Dr Wills asked supporters not to do anything 'provocative', such as  putting up their own protest links to 'The Shetland Times' and  challenging them to take more legal action.
<P>
'We're happy to let the law take its course and have no doubt we must  win. In any case, we've no intention of resuming regular links to  'The Shetland Times', whatever the outcome of the case. We were  growing rapidly without linking to them and they were always an  optional accessory to our pages. Now they've alienated so many  surfers, we don't feel like giving their website any more free hits.'

1st November 1996
<P>
Statistics published on the Internet yesterday (Thursday) show that  Shetland is becoming a major electronic publishing centre.
<P>
The islands' two electronic newspapers, <I>The Shetland News</I> and <I>The  Shetland Times</I>, are gaining more than 10,000 'hits' between them  every day. The larger of the two, The Shetland News, is heading for  two million hits by its first anniversary on November 23.
<P>
A 'hit' is a single visit to a page on a computer newspaper and  10,000 hits equates to around 6,800 readers - because many readers go  to more than one page.
<P>
The figures, compiled independently, are the Internet's equivalent of  the Audit Bureau of Circulation reports used by conventional newspapers.
<P>
Dr Jonathan Wills, managing director of Zetnews Ltd, which publishes  <I>The Shetland News</I>, said yesterday: 'What these figures show is the  amazing growth in readership since we started <I>The Shetland News </I>as an  experiment, just under a year ago. The figures are an under-estimate  because many central computers on the Internet store our pages for  quicker access and this does not show up in the records.
<P>
'The secret of success is updating our 250-page news magazine every  day. Surprisingly, only about five per cent of our readers live in  Shetland. Because of emigration from the islands over the past  century and a half, there are now hundreds of thousands of people  with Shetland connections all over the world and they're a big part  of our audience.'
<P>
He said <I>The Shetland News</I> accounted for 83 per cent of Shetland's  daily hits and three quarters of the information downloaded by  surfers, to read on their own home or office computers. 
<P>
'Interestingly, it appears that we trebled the <I>Shetland Times'</I> much  smaller readership when we began making links from our pages to  theirs early in October,' Dr Wills said. 'Unfortunately, they took  this as an assault on their copyright rather than the friendly  gesture which it was, and they've obtained an interim interdict  preventing us giving them an even wider audience.'
<P>
A hearing in the test case, which will decide for the first time  whether links between Internet sites are legal, is expected in the New Year at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.
<P>
Both papers rely on the services of <A HREF="http://www.zetnet.co.uk/">Zetnet Services, Ltd,</A> the  nationwide, local-call-rate access provider run from Lerwick, Shetland.

<H1>Funny Old World</H1>
<H2>Meet Robert Wishart, <BR>the man who took The Shetland News to court</H2>

</CENTER>
<P>
<HR>
<P>


<B>He did WHAT?</B><BR>
As managing director of The Shetland Times Ltd, he complained on 23rd October 1996 to Scotland's supreme civil court, the Court of Session in Edinburgh, that <I>The Shetland News</I> (which he, but no-one else, regards as a rival) was making direct links to the pages of his on-line edition.
<P>
<B>So what was his problem?</B><BR>
Breach of copyright, dear child. <I>Shetland News</I> links via his headlines to his stories apparently amounted to stealing the hard work of his six journalists and 'passing off' their stories as <I>Shetland News</I> reports.
<P><A HREF="wishart.jpg"><IMG SRC="wisharts.jpg" ALIGN=left WIDTH=163 HEIGHT=216 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
<B>This ridiculous allegation was some sort of joke?</B><BR>
Not at all. Mr Wishart intends to be Shetland's main Internet entrepreneur and regarded the alleged breach of copyright as a very serious matter indeed.
<P>
<B>But, but, but surely he realised that a link does not involve making a copy?</B><BR>
That's not Mr Wishart's view and he is a very important person in the Shetland media world. His thoughts on Life, the Internet and Everything are of great consequence. He publishes and/or prints almost all the islands' magazines and his weekly <I>Shetland Times </I>(founded 1872, circulation 11,000+ copies among 23,000 islanders) has a profitable monopoly in its tiny paddock.
<P>
<B>But, as I said, no unlicensed copy is made by a link, so how can the question of copyright arise?</B><BR>
I'm glad you asked that. Only Mr Wishart knows the answer. Everyone else who knows anything about it thinks he's up a gum tree.
<P>
<B>I thought there were no trees in Shetland?</B><BR>
Not many, but a person of Mr Wishart's stature can afford to buy what he likes.
<P>
<B>Like lawyers?</B><BR>
Oh, yes, lots of them.
<P>
<B>But surely <I>they</I> know this is nonsense and doomed to fail?</B><BR>
I don't think we ought to talk about that. It might upset their client.
<P>
<B>I take it the court told him to get lost?</B><BR>
Not exactly. Lord Hamilton, the judge, listened to three hours of legal arguments and then went to avizandum.
<P>
<B>He went on <I>holiday</I> to Turkey? In the middle of a test case which will decide the whole future of the Internet in the UK?</B><BR>
No, you fool. Going to avizandum means returning to your chambers, having a nice cup of tea, putting your feet up and having a long think about things, before sleeping on it.
<P>
<B>And what <I>did </I>Lord Hamilton think when he woke up next morning?</B><BR>
He thought it fairest to all concerned to order a temporary ban - what we rocket scientists call an interim interdict - which would restore the situation to what it was before Mr Wishart complained.
<P>
<B>So that's that, then? Internet links are illegal unless you have the website operator's approval to make them?</B><BR>
Not yet. That's what Mr Wishart thinks Lord Hamilton means but in fact there won't be a full hearing of all the evidence in the Court of Session until the New Year. Only after that will the court decide one way or the other.
<P>
<B>I see. So what sort of fellow is this Wishart?</B><BR>
Perfectly charming, according to those who are close to him. Worshipped by his staff, welcome in any dockside watering hole, always bubbling over with <I>bonhomie</I> and <I>joie de vivre</I>, he was educated at Gordonstoun (where Prince Charles went) and has his own yacht, so he must be a thoroughly good egg.
<P>
<B>Not, er, subject to tantrums at all? Flying off the handle, that sort of thing?</B><BR>
Perish the thought! A man of supremely equable temperament, skilled in the arts of quiet diplomacy and charitable to a fault, it says here.
<P>
<B>Qualifications for current position?</B><BR>
Oodles. In fact, his dad was so impressed with his c.v. that he asked him to be MD for life.
<P>
<B>Gosh, that's pretty impressive!</B><BR>
Yes, isn't it?
<P>
<B>But, wait a minute, weren't these chaps at <I>The Shetland News</I> doing him a favour by giving him readers, at their own expense, for his not terribly popular website?</B><BR>
That's what<I> they</I> thought, pathetic idealists and free communicators that they are. But don't take their word for it: e-mail the great man yourself at <A href="mailto:r.wishart@shetland-times.co.uk">r.wishart@shetland-times.co.uk</A>
<P>
<I>(A word of warning, though - he regards unsolicited correspondence on this subject as 'nuisance mail')</I>

<P>
29th October 1996
<P>
The Shetland Times last night (Monday) failed to respond to a peace  offer from Zetnews Ltd, publishers of The Shetland News, in an  unprecedented legal dispute over copyright on the Internet.
<P>
Dr Jonathan Wills, Zetnews managing director and editor of The  Shetland News - Britain's first local Internet paper - said he was  'saddened but not surprised' at the apparent rejection of what he  described as a 'generous' offer, designed to spare The Shetland Times  the 'embarrassment and expense' of a lengthy test case in Scotland's  supreme civil court, the Court of Session.
<P>
Last Thursday Lord Hamilton granted an interim interdict preventing  The Shetland News from making Internet links from its World Wide Web  pages, to pages operated by The Shetland Times.
<P>
It may be several months before the case for full interdict is heard.
<P>
The Shetland Times allege that the free links, provided at the  expense of The Shetland News, constitute infringement of copyright.
<P>
Last night (Friday) Dr Wills said: 'The Shetland Times have  misinterpreted Lord Hamilton's judgment as ''in effect'' favouring  their arguments. In fact, the interim interdict merely puts the  situation back to what it was before The Shetland Times made their  complaint. That is normal court procedure. The court has yet to  decide the issue.
<P>
'When it does, I am confident we will win. The practice of linking to  other Internet publications is universal and, indeed, the very basis  of the World Wide Web. This is a test case because, if The Shetland  Times were to succeed in their frivolous and vindictive action, there  would have to be a new Act of Parliament allowing the Internet to  continue to function in this country, in its present form.
<P>
'We have never made or kept copies of The Shetland Times on-line  edition. So the question of copyright does not arise. There is no  case to answer. All we have done is direct our readers to The  Shetland Times on-line edition, thus doing everyone a favour. It is  like someone putting a poster on a shop window and then drawing  customers' attention to someone else's poster on the other side of the window.'
<P>
The Shetland News was founded in November last year and has already  attracted over a million readers in more than 60 countries. Its  250 pages carry paid advertising from organisations and companies,  including P&O Ferries and Shetland Islands Tourism. Readership of The  Shetland Times electronic edition has not been disclosed but the  paper's web pages have not attracted any significant paid advertising  since the venture started in February this year.
<P>
<B>The offer to settle the dispute was made in a letter from Dr Wills to  The Shetland Times Ltd on Sunday. 
<BR>
The full text was as follows:</B>
<BR> <BR> 
<P>
'In the hope of settling the current dispute between us promptly,  economically and to the satisfaction of all concerned, I hereby make  the following offer to the directors of The Shetland Times Ltd, on  behalf of myself and Zetnews Ltd (publishers of The Shetland News).
<P>
'If The Shetland Times Ltd will undertake to apply immediately to the  Court of Session to lift the interim interdict, and will also agree  to pay all my and Zetnews Ltd's vouchered legal expenses to date, I  will undertake to:
<P>
<B>'1 </B> Instruct my solicitors and counsel to take no action in the  matter of the financial damages suffered by myself and Zetnews as a  result of The Shetland Times Ltd s proceedings, nor in the matter of  the <I>prima facie</I> defamation of myself, recently published by your  managing director.
<P>
<B>'2</B>  Ensure that all references to this affair are permanently removed  from the pages of The Shetland News.
<P>
<B>'3 </B> Make no further public reference to the details of the case,  while reserving the right to comment on the general issue of  copyright and the Internet.
<P>
<B>'4</B>  Ensure that, whenever a link is provided in future from the pages  of The Shetland News to pages of The Shetland Times on-line edition,  the link will carry a legend saying  'This is a link to a Shetland  Times copyright report'. I am willing to discuss a mutually agreed  alternative wording if this is not acceptable to you.
<P>
<B>'5 </B> Ensure that, in accordance with our invariable practice to date,  no Shetland Times on-line pages, logos, icons, photographs, artwork,  text or other editorial material are ever stored in electronic form  on our website or in our computers, except where such material has to  be stored for short periods, for use by such web browser software as we employ.
<P> <BR>
'I believe this to be a generous and fair offer which will save you  the expense and embarrassment of a protracted court case, from which  The Shetland Times Ltd is most unlikely to emerge with credit. It  will also save the local and wider Internet community considerable  distress and dislocation.
<P>
' My proposal has the added advantage of maintaining diverse  electronic news media in Shetland, providing readers with wider  choice and, on those occasions when we do make links to your site in  future, of considerably enhancing your own readership at no expense  to yourselves.
<P>
'I ask for your response in writing, by fax or messenger, by 5pm  tomorrow, Monday 28th October.
<P>
'If your response is favourable, I am content that this should remain  a private letter and that we should agree a joint public statement on  the following lines:  <BR><I>Following discussions between The Shetland  Times Ltd and Zetnews Ltd, the directors of both companies have  agreed an amicable solution to the current dispute between them. No  further public comment on the matter will be made by either company. </I>
<P>
'If you do not agree to this offer, I shall feel obliged to publish  it in full (so that our readers and customers are made aware that I  and Zetnews Ltd have tried to settle this amicably) and to instruct  my solicitors to prepare a detailed and vigorous defence of your  action for interdict. Your own solicitors may already have alerted  you to the startling misinterpretation which your managing director  appears to have placed upon Lord Hamilton s grant of <I>interim</I> interdict.
<P>
'I look forward to hearing from you.

25th October 1996
<P>
The attempt by The Shetland Times Ltd to have the basis of the  Internet declared illegal is drawing national media attention today (FRI).
<P>
Following yesterday's decision by Lord Hamilton in the Court of  Session at Edinburgh, The Shetland News has been forced to remove all  links to the pages of The Shetland Times on-line edition.  Our links  to other WWW news sites are unaffected and remain in place.
<P>
Shetland Times managing director Robert Wishart told the court that  links from The Shetland News breached his copyright and hindered his  efforts to attract advertising to his pages. 
<P>
BBC Radio One and other national media have featured the affair,  which is seen as a test case and is believed to be the first time a  UK Internet publisher has asked the courts to stop people making  links to a public domain website.
<P>
Lord Hamilton's ruling means that The Shetland News is banned from  making such links for several months, until a full hearing is held  into the issues raised by the case.
<P>
Legal expenses could run well above five thousand pounds. Shetland  News editor Jonathan Wills, speaking today from Orkney, where he is  on his annual ten day holiday, said he planned to launch a fighting fund:
<P>
'We are building up a new, small business which, while it is paying  its way, does not yet earn the directors and shareholders any income.  There's no way we can pay lawyers to take this case the full  distance, which of course is why The Shetland Times took this legal action. 
<P>
'They know that if they lose at the full hearing, as they certainly  will, they could still win financially by forcing us out of business  and leaving them with a monopoly. I am appealing to everyone who  believes in the free exchange of information on the Internet to help  us fight this case.
<P>
'A special bank account is being set up and details will be published  early next week when I return from my family holiday, which Mr  Wishart's vindictive court action has now ruined.'
<P>
Demonstrating that he still does not understand how Internet links  work, Mr Wishart today repeated his claim that a link from The  Shetland News to Shetland Times pages was in breach of copyright. He  also said The Shetland News had attempted to 'pass off' Shetland  Times reporters' work as part of The Shetland News website.
<P>
Dr Wills immediately responded by asking Mr Wishart to withdraw,  correct and apologise for 'this defamatory statement'.
<P>
Unlike the daily, 250-page Shetland News, which routinely achieves  hit rates many times higher than The Shetland Times on-line edition,  Mr Wishart has not yet attracted any significant paid advertising  since he launched an electronic edition in February, three months  after The Shetland News pioneered the idea.

<P>
<CENTER><U>Statement by Dr Jonathan Wills, editor of The Shetland News <BR>and  managing director of the Internet publishers, Zetnews Ltd:</U></CENTER>
<P>
'This morning (THURS), in an unprecedented attempt to block free  access to the Internet, The Shetland Times Ltd obtained interim  interdict in the Court of Session, preventing The Shetland News from  directing its readers to the pages of the Internet edition of The  Shetland Times.
<P>
'The Shetland Times Ltd alleges breach of copyright. In fact, no such  breach occurs when we put up free links from our pages to theirs.  What we have been doing is bringing The Shetland Times readers which  otherwise they would not have had. It is the equivalent of the  publisher of The Guardian directing readers to an interesting article  in The Independent. I thought we were doing them a favour and  expected them to reciprocate.
<P>
'I respect the law and will abide by the terms of the interdict  when it is formally served. In place of the former links to The  Shetland Times, The Shetland News will carry a message informing our  readers that their freedom of choice has been legally censored at the  instigation of Robert Wishart, managing director of The Shetland  Times Ltd. I am sure readers will draw their own conclusions. 
<P>
'I am confident that, when the court studies the full facts of this  case, it will reject The Shetland Times' application and award full  costs against them for what I can only decribe as a frivolous,  vexatious and malicious legal action, clearly designed to cripple our  small, new company financially and to gain a monopoly of Internet  news publishing in Shetland.
<P>
'The managing director of The Shetland Times must know that the basic  principle of the Internet is free access. This access is via links  from one website to another. By attempting to block such links, he is  in effect saying that the Internet in its present form is illegal.  This is a test case and, if upheld, will undoubtedly require a new  Act of Parliament to let the Internet continue in its present form in the UK. 
<P>
'The hilarious side of it is that The Shetland Times is the first  Internet news publisher I have heard of to turn away readers and  attempt to publish in secret. Most are desperate to get as many  'hits' as they can.
<P>
'What is not so amusing is that, as The Shetland Times Ltd also  knows, I cannot afford to defend this action. The preposterous claim  that The Shetland News has infringed the copyright of The Shetland  Times Ltd is a flimsy veil for a personal spite which has existed  since Mr Wishart was obliged to settle out of court after illegally  dismissing me as editor of The Shetland Times in January 1990.
<P>
'The Shetland Times also implies that I and Zetnews Ltd have no right  to use the title 'The Shetland News'. In fact, permission to use this  title was given to me in 1990 by the late Dr Mortimer Manson, the  last editor of the print newspaper of the same name, which closed in 1963.'

<P>
16th October 1996
<P>
In a highly unusual move, The Shetland News has been told by the  publisher of The Shetland Times to stop putting up links to pages in  the on-line edition of Shetland's weekly printed newspaper.
<P><A HREF="wishart.jpg"><IMG SRC="wisharts.jpg" ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
Most Internet publishers are desperate to log as many hits as they  can, but in a fax last night (Tuesday) to Dr Jonathan Wills, editor of  The Shetland News, Robert Wishart, managing director of The Shetland  Times Ltd, said:
<P>
'It has been brought to my attention that you are making use of  headlines, news, photographs and other material from The Shetland  Times and our 'On Line' service.
<P>
'As this is a clear infringement of our copyright we must ask for the  immediate withdrawal of this and your written undertaking not to use  any such material in the future without first obtaining our written permission.
<P>
'We would be obliged if you could respond to this as soon as possible  and no later than noon tomorrow (Wednesday) failing which we will be  forced to take further action in this matter.'
<P>
Choking back tears of mirth, Dr Wills replied as follows: 'Thank you  so much for your fax message, which has given me no end of fun. It's  good to see that you have not lost your legendary sense of humour  after all these years.
<P>
'Just in case there is the teeniest chance that you were being  serious, let me explain a few points of which you, as a relative  newcomer to the Internet publishing business, may not be aware.
<P>
'The principle of the Internet is free access. We have no turnstile  where we vet or charge readers. Nor do you. What we have done, are  doing and will continue to do is direct our readers to your website  on those occasions when your six editorial staff manage to come up  with a story which our single member of staff has either missed or  not got around to writing. You are in good company. We do the same  for The Herald, CNN, Le Monde, La Stampa and dozens of other Internet  news publishers. Take a look at the Icelandic volcano site, for  example: it puts into perspective your own little explosion this  evening (which I am sure you will regret and have a quiet giggle  over, once you calm down and realise what a silly billy you've been). 
<P><A HREF="wills.jpg"><IMG SRC="willss.jpg" ALIGN=right HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5></A>
'At no time have we infringed your undisputed copyright, nor have we  made any use whatsoever of your material in our own pages. If we did,  we would pay you our normal, single-use, electronic reproduction fees  at NUJ rates. Where we give a free link to a Shetland Times story  which we think would interest our readers, we send them straight to  your very own page, not to one of ours. When they get there they are  looking at The Shetland Times, not at The Shetland News. They know  this because the page carries your own banner and copyright notice.  To make doubly sure that the reader is not confused, we make no  alterations to your pages at all. A moment's reflection will tell you  that we couldn't possibly do that, anyway. We also leave untouched  any pictures you may be carrying. Because they are of such low  technical quality, there is no chance that our readers could possibly  imagine they were still looking at the Shetland News site.
<P>
'We don't need your written permission to put up links to your site,  or to any other. You ought to be jolly pleased, because we are  bringing you hundreds of readers a day whom you wouldn't otherwise  have. In fact, we would normally charge someone for the privilege of  such links from our busy site but, in the interests of our readers  and out of a feeling of solidarity with your complementary WWW  operation, we wouldn't dream of sending you an invoice. You see,  whatever you feel about us, we don't regard you as a competitor.
<P>
'It would be nice, once you're feeling better, if you could  reciprocate - rather than threaten to retaliate. But I'll quite  understand if you don't do that right away. These things take time,  after all. I know it's difficult to understand but the WWW is quite  different from print media. Different rules apply and at first they  are surprising. 
<P>
'In the meantime, if you have any pages which you feel are not  getting the hits they deserve, don't hesitate to send me another fax  message (or even an e-mail) and I'll see if I can arrange a link for  you. No, really, I will. You see, I'm not cross with you at all.
<P>
Yours sincerely,
<P>
(Jonathan Wills)'

10th January 1997
<P>
Knitwear pirates all over the world are still selling bogus Shetland  woollies, despite protests by islanders who manufacture the real thing.
<P>
Lorna Graham of <A HREF="http://www.zetnet.co.uk/skta/">Shetland Knitwear Trades Association</A> said yesterday  [THURS] it was proving 'almost impossible' to control abuse of the  islands' name and trademarks.
<P>
'Unfortunately, the word Shetland is now almost a generic term for  some kinds of wool and garments,' she said. 'An increasing number of  manufacturers claiming 100 per cent Shetland wool, pure Shetland and  real Shetland are appearing worldwide.'
<P>
A recent report to Shetland Islands Council's Knitwear Advisory Panel  suggested applying for European Union 'Leader' funding for a renewed  campaign to report fraudulent manufacturers to the trading standards  authorities in their own countries.
<P>
Complaints to the International Wool Secretariat had not led to any  action, the panel heard.
<P>
Frank Miller, managing director of Judane Ltd, Shetland's largest  knitwear manufacturer, said: 'Shetland has a strong case and I think  political lobbying would help.' He pointed to the example of  champagne, where French vintners in the Campagne region had achieved  trade mark protection.
<P>
Members of the panel agreed to pursue the matter and pointed out that   three-quarters of the Shetland wool clip comes from pure Shetland  sheep. Much of it is spun and knitted in the islands.

10th January 1997
<P>
Treasures from two major archaeological digs in Shetland are to  return to the islands.
<P>
Shetland Museum curator Tommy Watt said yesterday [THUR] the Finds  Disposal Panel of Historic Scotland had awarded the museum finds from  excavations at Upper Scalloway and Kebister, near Lerwick.
<P>
'I'm very pleased these artefacts are coming home,' he said. 'They've  been undergoing extensive study in Scotland and now that the final  reports are nearing publication, they've been released.'
<P>
Kebister was excavated between 1985 and 1987, revealing a site dating  from the Neolithic to the 19th century.  Among the Kebister finds is  a large armorial slab, believed to have belonged to Henry Phankouth,  archdeacon of Shetland (1501-29), who had a teind barn or warehouse  at Kebister, for rents paid in butter and cloth. 
<P>
Mr Watt said: 'The Upper Scalloway material is a vast collection of  artefacts which where excavated from a settlement and medieval  cemetery.  A late Bronze Age cremation was discovered under a broch  and associated Late  Iron Age structures.
<P>
'Exciting finds include several carved bone playing pieces, painted  pebbles which have an unknown unique use, crucible fragments and many  other smaller items from a site with a long human occupation.'
<P>
He hoped to display the items once they are returned to Shetland in April.
