<P>Welcome to the Chemistry Home Page at Lenoir Community College.
Below you will find information about our chemistry program,
information about the instructors, and links to sites that may be of
interest to chemistry students, and educated students in general.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>We provide courses that fulfill first year chemistry
requirements for students in a broad range of curricula- from science
majors, pre-med, pre-vet, pre-nursing, etc. Second year Organic
chemistry has been offered in the past, and still appears in the
catalog, but has not been taught for several years; we do not
anticipate offering these classes unless a substantial demand arises.
</P>

<P>Lectures are usually conducted in Main 209, with laboratories
meeting in Main 226.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>We have recently acquired and upgraded six IBM
computers, providing a total of eight computers for student use;
these computers were already used in laboratories this quarter. If
enought funding is forthcoming in the next few months, students
should have use of these eight computers as tools to acquire,
analyze, and manipulate data in the laboratory; the goal of providing
such materials in the laboratory is to give students a more thorough
experience of the environment in real research and industrial labs.

should be certain to complete a full year sequence if possible this

<P><HR><B>Here is a nice list of all the courses offered for degrees
in the Arts and Sciences Unit. It's not complete, nor will it be
anytime soon. In fact, some of it doesn't even make any sense. So be
patient, I'm working on it--and a dozen other things besides. (Plus
there's that thing with Christie Brinkley, but hey, that's my
problem, so don't worry about it.) Oh, by the way, links to course
syllabi will be provided as they become available. So check back
often.</B><HR></P>

<P>Several important notes pertain:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><UL>
   <LI>Quizzes will be administered weekly (details in class). These
   quizzes are a valuable tool for helping you to know how well you
   comprehend the material being covered and emphasized by your
   instructor.
   
   <LI>The first two exams will each contain 20 - 25 questions. The
   final exam will be comprehensive, and will include questions from
   the two midterm exams. Hint: Analyze the questions you miss on an
   exam. Understand how to answer them correctly.
   
   <LI>Final Grades will be determined by calculating a percentage of
   the total points. If your final exam grade (scaled to 200 points)
   is better than one of your two midterm exams or your class quiz
   grade, the scaled score will replace that lowest score. You should
   not rely on this way of "pulling out your semester's grade". A
   total of 900 points guarantees an A; 800 points a B; 700 points a
   C; 600 points a D. YOU SHOULD NOTE that excessive absences (more
   than 4) will be used as a factor for students whose course grade
   is close to a borderline. Pay particular attention to the LCC
   catalog, pages 30-31.

<UL>
   <LI>Math Skills - The single best skill for your success in a
   third of CHM 91 is your facility with mathematics. Other necessary
   skills and concepts needed for CHM 91 are detailed in item 6 of
   this handout. (OTHER AREAS OF CONCERN)
   
   <LI>Assistance in the Course<BR>
   
   1. Review sessions will be offered in class prior to all
   exams.<BR>
   
   2. Office hours will be held regularly throughout the week (to be
   announced); if these are inconvenient, see me to make an
   appointment.
   
   <LI>Self-Help - Chemistry 91 is a course that demands certain
   efforts. These will be most productive if your effort is expended
   regularly over the quarter and not concentrated immediately prior
   to an exam. One very helpful procedure is:

   <LI><B>Use of a calculator. </B>The calculator you use in this
   course need not be expensive. It should be able to handle
   scientific - or exponential - notation. <B>You should know how to
   use your calculator.</B> <B>Calculators may not be shared on
   examinations.</B> Consult your manual for operational details
   specific to your calculator.
   
   <LI><B>Units of Measurement</B> - You should be familiar with the
   <B>fundamental units</B> of measurements (Table 1.1-1.4 pp. 6-9)
   as well as those prefixes most commonly encountered in the SI
   system (Table 1.5 p. 11). You should be able to quickly convert
   between any units in the SI system. No conversion factors of this
   type will be provided on examinations. Additionally you are
   expected to know the English - SI conversion factors: 453.6 g = 1
   lb and 1 in = 2.54 cm (exact). Any other necessary English - SI
   conversion factors will be provided. You should also be familiar
   with the <B>derived quantities</B> of volume and density. While
   most scientific work involving temperature is done on the Celsius
   or Absolute scale, there are instances in which temperature data
   are provided on the Fahrenheit scale.

   <B>There is a certain vocabulary</B> with which you should be
   familiar and <B>for which you will be responsible on the first
   exam including:</B>
   
   <DL>
      Names and symbols for the elements in the eight columns denoted
      I-VIII on the inside front cover of your textbook. Additionally
      you should know the names and symbols for the 1st row
      transition metals (atomic no. 21 - 30).
      
      <DL>
         <DD>&nbsp;
      </DL>
      
      <DD>Names and formulas for common monatomic cations and anions
      and common polyatomic ions. A handout will be distributed in
      class to provide a basic list. Additional listings are found in
      your text Table 3.4 pp 67.

</TABLE></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Several important notes to consider:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Quizzes will be administered weekly (details in class) . These
   quizzes are a valuable tool for helping you to know how well you
   comprehend the material being covered and emphasized by your
   instructor.
   
   <LI>The first two exams will each contain 20 - 25 questions. The
   final exam will be comprehensive, and will include questions from
   the two midterm exams. Hint: Analyze the questions you miss on an
   exam. Understand how to answer them correctly.
   
   <LI>Final Grades will be determined by calculating a percentage of
   the total points. If your final exam grade (scaled to 200 points)
   is better than one of your two midterm exams or your class quiz
   grade, the scaled score will replace that lowest score. You should
   not rely on this way of "pulling out your semester's grade". A
   total of 900 points guarantees an A; 800 points a B; 700 points a
   C; 600 points a D. YOU SHOULD NOTE that excessive absences (more
   than 4) will be used as a factor for students whose course grade
   is close to a borderline. Pay particular attention to the LCC
   catalog, pages 30-31.<BR>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Math Skills</B> - The single best skill for your success in
   CHM 101 is your facility with mathematics. Other necessary skills
   and concepts needed for CHM 101 are detailed in item 6 of this
   handout. (OTHER AREAS OF CONCERN)

   <LI><B>Self-Help</B>
   
   <DL>
      Chemistry 101 is a course that demands certain efforts. These
      will be most productive if your effort is expended regularly
      over the quarter and <B>not</B> concentrated immediately prior
      to an exam. One very helpful procedure is:

   <LI><B>Units of Measurement</B> - You should be familiar with the
   <B>fundamental units</B> of measurements (Table 1.2 text, p. 7) as
   well as those prefixes most commonly encountered in the SI system
   (Table 1.2 p. 7). You should be able to quickly convert between
   any units in the SI system. No conversion factors of this type
   will be provided on examinations. Additionally you are expected to
   know the English - SI conversion factors: 453.6 g = 1 lb and 1 in
   = 2.54 cm (exact). Any other necessary English - SI conversion
   factors will be provided. You should also be familiar with the
   <B>derived quantities</B> of volume and density. While most
   scientific work involving temperature is done on the Celsius or
   Absolute scale, there are instances in which temperature data are
   provided on the Fahrenheit scale.

      </TD></TR>
</TABLE></P>

<P>Several important notes to consider:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Quizzes will be administered weekly (details in class) . These
   quizzes are a valuable tool for helping you to know how well you
   comprehend the material being covered and emphasized by your
   instructor.
   
   <LI>The first two exams will each contain 20 - 25 questions. The
   final exam will be comprehensive, and will include questions from
   the two midterm exams. Hint: Analyze the questions you miss on an
   exam. Understand how to answer them correctly.
   
   <LI>Final Grades will be determined by calculating a percentage of
   the total points. If your final exam grade (scaled to 200 points)
   is better than one of your two midterm exams or your class quiz
   grade, the scaled<BR>
   
   score will replace that lowest score. You should not rely on this
   way of "pulling out your semester's grade". A total of 900 points
   guarantees an A; 800 points a B; 700 points a C; 600 points a D.
   YOU<BR>
   
   SHOULD NOTE that excessive absences (more than 4) will be used as
   a factor for students whose course grade is close to a borderline.
   Pay particular attention to the LCC catalog, pages 30-31.<BR>

   <LI><B>Math Skills</B> - The single best skill for your success in
   CHM 102 is your facility with mathematics (even more so than in

   <DL>
      Chemistry 102 is a course that demands certain efforts. These

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Several important notes to consider:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Quizzes will be administered weekly (details in class) . These
   quizzes are a valuable tool for helping you to know how well you
   comprehend the material being covered and emphasized by your
   instructor.
   
   <LI>The first two exams will each contain 20 - 25 questions. The
   final exam will be comprehensive, and will include questions from
   the two midterm exams. Hint: Analyze the questions you miss on an
   exam. Understand how to answer them correctly.
   
   <LI>Final Grades will be determined by calculating a percentage of
   the total points. If your final exam grade (scaled to 200 points)
   is better than one of your two midterm exams or your class quiz
   grade, the scaledscore will replace that lowest score. You should
   not rely on this way of "pulling out your semester's grade". A
   total of 900 points guarantees an A; 800 points a B; 700 points a
   C; 600 points a D. YOU SHOULD NOTE that excessive absences (more
   than 4) will be used as a factor for students whose course grade
   is close to a borderline. Pay particular attention to the LCC
   catalog, pages 30-31.
   
   <LI>The term paper will count the same as <B>TWO</B> exam grades,
   and cannot be replaced by a better final exam score. Detailed
   information about the paper is attached to this syllabus, and will
   be discussed in class.

<P><A NAME="Success"></A>5.SUCCESS IN THE COURSE</P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Math Skills</B> - The single best skill for your success in
   CHM 103 is the same as for 101 and 102- your facility with
   mathematics. Other necessary skills and concepts needed for CHM
   103 are detailed in item 6 of this handout. (OTHER AREAS OF
   CONCERN)
   
   <LI><B>Assistance in the Course</B>
   
   <UL>
      <LI>Review sessions will be offered in class prior to all
      exams.
      
      <LI>Office hours will be held regularly throughout the week (to
      be announced); if these are<BR>
      
      inconvenient, see me to make an appointment.
   </UL>
   
   <LI><B>Self-Help</B>
   
   <DL>
      Chemistry 103 is a course that demands certain efforts. These
      will be most productive if your effort is expended regularly
      over the quarter and <B>not</B> concentrated immediately prior
      to an exam. One very helpful procedure is:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Several important notes pertain:<BR>

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
   <LI>Quizzes will be administered weekly (details in class). These
   quizzes are a valuable tool for helping you to know how well you
   comprehend the material being covered and emphasized by your
   instructor.
   
   <LI>The first two exams will each contain 20 - 25 questions. The
   final exam will be comprehensive, and will include questions from
   the two midterm exams. Hint: Analyze the questions you miss on an
   exam. Understand how to answer them correctly.
   
   <LI>Final Grades will be determined by calculating a percentage of
   the total points. If your final exam grade (scaled to 200 points)
   is better than one of your two midterm exams or your class quiz
   grade, the scaled score will replace that lowest score. You should
   not rely on this way of "pulling out your semester's grade". A
   total of 900 points guarantees an A; 800 points a B; 700 points a
   C; 600 points a D. YOU SHOULD NOTE that excessive absences (more
   than 4) will be used as a factor for students whose course grade
   is close to a borderline. Pay particular attention to the LCC
   catalog, pages 30-31.<BR>

<P><A NAME="Concerns"></A>6. OTHER AREAS OF CONCERN</P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Use of a calculator. </B>The calculator you use in this
   course need not be expensive. It should be able to handle
   scientific - or exponential - notation. <B>You should know how to
   use your calculator.</B> <B>Calculators may not be shared on
   examinations.</B> Consult your manual for operational details
   specific to your calculator.
   
   <LI><B>Scientific (Exponential) Notation</B> - Consult pp 10-13
   and Appendix A.1 of your textbook if you are "rusty" on the
   procedures for expressing numbers in scientific notation and
   manipulating those numbers.
   
   <LI><B>Units of Measurement</B> - You should be familiar with the
   <B>fundamental units</B> of measurements (Table 1.1, Table 1.2,
   Table 1.3, pp. 7-8) as well as those prefixes most commonly
   encountered in the SI system (Table 1.5 p. 12). You should be able
   to quickly convert between any units in the SI system. No
   conversion factors of this type will be provided on examinations.
   Additionally you are expected to know the English - SI conversion
   factors: 453.6 g = 1 lb and 1 in = 2.54 cm (exact). Any other
   necessary English - SI conversion factors will be provided. You
   should also be familiar with the <B>derived quantities</B> of
   volume and density. While most scientific work involving
   temperature is done on the Celsius or Absolute scale, there are
   instances in which temperature data are provided on the Fahrenheit
   scale.
   
   <LI><B>Significant Figures</B> - You should remember that not all
   the numbers on the calculator's display are significant. Consult
   your textbook pages 13-17 and Appendix 3 (pp 619,620) for a review
   of these details.
   
   <LI><B>Factor Label\Dimensional Analysis</B> - Unity Factors: By
   whatever name it is called, Factor Label analysis offers a
   foolproof method for exchanging units between systems. It <B>DOES
   NOT</B> offer a way to convert mass into length or lead into gold.
   You should be well versed in the uses and limitations of this
   technique. Consult pp 18-20 of your text for assistance in this
   area.
   
   <LI><B>Chemical Vocabulary</B>: CH 105 is the introductory course
   in chemistry at LCC. There is a basic vocabulary with which you
   should become conversant as rapidly as possible. One such area of
   vocabulary is <B>nomenclature</B> - the system of naming things.
   <B>There is a certain vocabulary</B> with which you should be
   familiar and <B>for which you will be responsible on the first
   exam including:</B>

<UL>
   <LI>RETAIN THIS HANDOUT ALL SEMESTER, referring to it for
   information concerning pertinent dates, policies, and rules.
   
   <LI>Retain any graded material for the semester so that - in the

         <P>= 1000 points
      </TD></TR>
</TABLE></P>

<P>Several important notes pertain:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Quizzes will be administered weekly (details in class). These
   quizzes are a valuable tool for helping you to know how well you
   comprehend the material being covered and emphasized by your
   instructor.
   
   <LI>The first two exams will each contain 20 - 25 questions. The
   final exam will be comprehensive, and will include questions from
   the two midterm exams. Hint: Analyze the questions you miss on an
   exam. Understand how to answer them correctly.
   
   <LI>Final Grades will be determined by calculating a percentage of
   the total points. If your final exam grade (scaled to 200 points)
   is better than one of your two midterm exams or your class quiz
   grade, the scaled score will replace that lowest score. You should
   not rely on this way of "pulling out your semester's grade". A
   total of 900 points guarantees an A; 800 points a B; 700 points a
   C; 600 points a D. YOU SHOULD NOTE that excessive absences (more
   than 4) will be used as a factor for students whose course grade
   is close to a borderline. Pay particular attention to the LCC
   catalog, pages 30-31.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Several important notes to consider:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Quizzes will be administered weekly (details in class) . These
   quizzes are a valuable tool for helping you to know how well you
   comprehend the material being covered and emphasized by your
   instructor.
   
   <LI>The first three exams will each contain 20 - 25 questions. The
   final exam will be comprehensive, and will include questions from
   the two midterm exams. Hint: Analyze the questions you miss on an
   exam. Understand how to answer them correctly.
   
   <LI>Final Grades will be determined by calculating a percentage of
   the total points. If your final exam grade (scaled to 200 points)
   is better than one of your two midterm exams or your class quiz
   grade, the scaledscore will replace that lowest score. You should
   not rely on this way of "pulling out your semester's grade". A
   total of 900 points guarantees an A; 800 points a B; 700 points a

CLASSES UPON CONVERSION TO SEMESTERS</FONT></B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><BR>

<B><FONT COLOR="#000000">CHM 90</FONT> </B>and <B>91</B> will be
combined into a single course, <B><FONT COLOR="#000000">CHM
90</FONT></B>; at this point it is anticipated that separate sections
will be offered with different emphasis appropriate to the needs of
the students.</P>

<P><B>CHM 101, 102, 103</B> will be combined into two courses,
<B><FONT COLOR="#000000">CHM 151, 152;</FONT></B> basically dividing
the textbook materials in half.</P>

<P><B>CHM 105, 106, 107</B> will be combined into two courses,
<B><FONT COLOR="#000000">CHM 131</FONT></B> (with
<B><FONT COLOR="#000000">CHM 131A</FONT></B> lab),
<B><FONT COLOR="#000000">CHM 132</FONT></B>;basically dividing the
textbook materials in half; this will cause a splitting of the
organic material in two over Christmas vacation, or a compression of
the organic and biochemistry topics into a single semester.</P>

<P>Note that under the current quarter system, classes meet four
hours a week for lecture, and two hours a week for laboratory (except
for <B>CHM 90/91</B>, which meets five lecture hours per week);
conversion to the semester system will cause a change in this
arrangement to correspond to the arrangement typical of
semester-based institutions- three lecture hours and three laboratory
hours per week. This decrease in lecture time will necessitate the
omission of some materials we now cover, and progression through
the<BR>

course material at a more aggressive pace.</P>

The alliance broadened its network to include Language Arts teachers from the middle schools in 1993.  Over the past five years, the alliance has scheduled three workshops a year, concentrating on issues of importance for English teachers.  The purpose of this alliance is to establish a network of teachers who have the same common objective:  to help students improve their oral and written communication skills.</H3><H3></H3><H3>     If you would like more information concerning this group, contact Debbie Lamm at Lenoir Community College at 919.527.6223, ext. 308 or via email at debbie.lamm@transfer.lenoir.cc.nc.us.</H3><HR ALIGN=center  WIDTH=100% SIZE=2><A HREF="english.html">Return to English Dept.

<PRE>
DEGREE:  Associate in Arts - 96 Quarter Hours Minimum

     This curriculum is designed for those students who plan to major in 
     psychology at a senior institution.  The course offerings will allow 
     a student to transfer to a four-year school with most of their non-major 
     and non-minor requirements already met.  The offerings in psychology are 
     designed to meet the required course needs for most freshman/sophomore 
     level psychology majors.  The transferring student will consequently 
     be prepared to begin taking advanced level (junior and senior) psychology 
     courses upon admission to their new institution.

<H2>T056  Mental Health Associate</H2>
<HR>
<PRE>
	The Mental Health Associate curriculum prepares graduates to provide a
variety of services to persons who are mentally ill, emotionally disturbed,
behaviorally disoriented, criminally insane, abused or neglected, retarded or
otherwise developmentally disabled, culturally and educationally handicapped
and in crisis.  Graduates promote educational and public mental health
awareness; provide outreach, out-patient day care, intake, in-patient,
rehabilitation, counseling, behavior modification services; and offer special
training instruction in community mental health and retardation centers.
	Mental health associates may work in mental health centers, mental hospitals,
mental retardation centers, social service agencies, private and public
hospitals and schools, nursery schools, and day care centers.  The functions
may be interdisciplinary in nature or they may consist of duties related
primarily to a particular discipline. In either case, the mental health
associate functions under the supervision of a professional member of their
health team.
	Individuals desiring a career in mental health assisting should, if possible,
take biology, algebra, sociology and psychology courses prior to entering the
program.

SIZE="+3" COLOR="#0000AF">WHY CHOOSE <BR>

COMMUNITY COLLEGES?</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#0000AF">Jerry
McCullen, Head Lenoir Community College Psychology
Department</FONT></B></CENTER></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000AF">Students who face the decision
about what college to choose often bypass Community Colleges with
little if any thought, feeling that Community Colleges are somehow
"lesser" institutions or are for people who cannot gain acceptance to
the traditional four year colleges. As a consequence of this
prejudice, many students who would benefit from some of the unique
strengths of Community Colleges fail to seriously consider this
useful alternative.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000AF">Perhaps the major reason why
students fail courses in college involves study habits. Many students
entering college simply have not learned study habits sufficient for
acquiring the relatively large amounts of material required in
academically oriented college level courses. High school often does
not prepare students for acquiring large amounts of material in short
periods of time, particularly when, as often occurs, a student will
have several tests in one day.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000AF">Four year institutions, because of
their size and because of other requirements imposed on faculty
members have relatively little time or inclination to devote major
amounts of effort toward dealing with study skills. Notwithstanding
the fact that these institutions will usually have study skills labs,
these are typically underutilized by both students and faculty
members. The general attitude seems to be that the student who really
wants to learn will find a way to acquire the material, and the
student who does not acquire the material did not really want to
learn anyway. The current shortage in college age students is forcing
four year institutions to reassess this attitude, but total
alteration of an attitude as pervasive will require several
years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000AF">Community colleges on the other
hand have a long term commitment to maximizing the performance of all
of their students, and there seems to be a much more pervasive
commitment to helping students acquire the skills that will be
required for academic success. Not only is the course material itself
considered vital, but preparing the student to learn the material is 
considered to be of primary importance. This long term commitment to
improving the skills of each student, not just the knowledge of the
student leads the Community College to approach the educational
process with a very different outlook.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000AF">Within the Community College
itself, we find teachers with a somewhat different outlook than that
of teachers in the four year institutions. Senior colleges have
traditionally required their teachers to be deeply involved in
research and publication. This requirement has insured that faculty
members will remain on the cutting edge of knowledge within their
particular discipline, but it has also forced those faculty members
to invest tremendous amounts of their time and professional energy in
their research, consequently leaving less time and energy for the
purely teaching aspects of their jobs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000AF">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000AF">Also, because of their involvement
in  the more advanced, esoteric aspects of their disciplines, these
faculty members are often less interested in the elementary courses
within their subject areas. Introductory courses then are frequently
taught by either the most junior members of the faculty, or more
often by graduate assistants and graduate teaching fellows. While
these individuals are undeniably bright, knowledgeable people, their
lack of experience in teaching may lead to a less than optimal level
of performance in the classroom.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000AF">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000AF">Individuals who teach in the
Community College system have frequently been self selected for their
commitment to teaching. These individuals have chosen to teach in
Community Colleges because their first love is teaching, not
research, and they have a genuine belief that helping students
improve their classroom performance is a task that can best be
achieved in the classroom itself. Consequently they have invested
large portions of their time and energy in learning to be good
teachers who can effectively communicate their course material to
students. The Community College system does not place the research,
publication, and committee demands on their time that other
institutions of higher learning may require, thus freeing more of
their time for pure teaching and student contact.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000AF">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000AF">Community Colleges will also
typically have more favorable student ot teacher ratios, thus making
it more possible for teachers to be aware of the strengths and
weaknesses of individual students. To the extent that an instructor
is aware of a given student's weakness and strength, then that
teacher can more effectively design an academic program that will
challenge that student to learn, but will not be pitched so far
beyond that student's ability as to discourage him and cause him to
leave the academic environment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000AF">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000AF">In no way is any of this intended
to disparage the performance of four year institutions or the faculty
members at those institutions. Simply put though, Community Colleges
have a totally different perspective of the best fashion in which to
educate our young people. The superior student will manner wherever
he enrolls, but the student who has not prepared himself to the
maximal degree would benefit from the atmosphere of most Community
Colleges.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000AF">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000AF">This atmosphere of concern and
care, coupled with teachers who are committed to teaching as a life's
work will ease that student's transition into the highly charged
atmosphere of higher education. Further, the two years spent at a
Community College provide time for the prospective student to grow
and mature, and to do so in a more nurturing and protected
environment. Consequently, when this student enters a four year
institution he is more likely to possess the skills, maturity, and
confidence necessary in order for him to obtain maximal benefit from
that institution.</FONT></P>

     The Pre-Business Administration and Pre-Business Education

      business courses which are normally taken during the first 
      two years at a senior institution.  Because requirements vary

      business adviser when choosing courses.

DEGREE:  CRIMINAL JUSTICE / PROTECTIVE SERVICES TECHNOLOGY (T129)

	The Criminal Justic/Protective Services Technology curriculum is designed so
that it may be a multi-faceted program of study.  It may consist of study
options in corrections, law enforcement and security services.
	The curriculum is designed with a core of courses to afford one the
opportunity to acquire basic knowledge, skills and attitudes in the generally
accepted subject areas associated with a two-year study of correctional
services, law enforcement services, and security services.  It includes
subjects such as interpersonal communications, law, psychology and sociology.
	In addition to core subjects, the correctional services option provides an
opportunity to study other generally accepted subjects indigenous to a two-year
correctional services program such as confinement facility administration,
correctional law, counseling, probation-parole services and rehabilitation
options.  Similarly, the law enforcement option provides an opportunity to
study other generally accepted subjects included in a two-year law enforcement
services program such as criminal behavior, criminal investigation, patrol
operation, traffic management, and other aspects of law enforcement
administration and operations.  The security services option provides an
opportunity to study other generally accepted subjects related to a two-year
security services program such as accident prevention and safety management,
common carrier protection, fire prevention, private security, industrial
security, retail security, security systems and surveillance.
	Job opportunities are available with federal, state, county and municipal
governments.  In addition, knowledge, skills and attitudes acquired in this
course of study qualify one for job opportunities with private enterprise in
such areas as industrial, retail and private security.

Hours:  Class = 5   Credit = 5 	Prereq's:  ENG 83, 92  (CR: ENG 93)

Course Description:  A survey of basic geographical concepts based on 
a study of the world's regions.

Required Texts:   
Harm de Blij and Peter Muller.   Geography: Realms, Regions, 
and Concepts.  7th edition.  John Wiley and Sons,  1994.

Goodes World Atlas.  19th edition.  Rand McNally, 1995  (pkgd. w/text) 
	
Course Objectives:    The purpose of GEO 101 (Introduction to Geography) 
is to introduce the student to the earth's major cultural and economic 
regions and important geographical concepts.

About the Course:  I hope this course will be unlike any geography 
course (or any other course, for that matter) you have ever taken.  
Through use of the computer, multimedia applications, and, most 
important, the Internet, we will not only read about and discuss 
various world regions, we will visit them -- virtually, of course.
	You will conduct research via the Internet, write a few short 
(and I mean short) assignments on the computer, and (hopefully) 
review for tests on the computer.  In other words, you and the computer 
are about to become good friends.  If you do not own or have never 
used a computer extensively, dont worry. We have a computer lab 
and I will walk you through unfamiliar territory.  I must warn you, 
however, the Internet is addictive, and boy do I mean addictive.  
You will find that time loses meaning.  What you are doing is fun, 
too much fun to be work, but it is.
	
Course Outline (subject to revision):
I.  Basic Concepts and Ideas of Geography
II. Computers, the Internet, and Geography
III. Europe
IV. Russia and the CIS
V.  North America
VI. Developed Asia:  The Pacific Rim
VII. Middle America
IX. South America
X. The Islamic Realm: The Middle East and North Africa
XI. Subsaharan Africa
XII. South Asia
XIII. China
XIV.Southeast Asia


Grading Criteria:  Final grades will be based on the following:

Three One-hour Tests	=	300 points
Final Examination	=	100 points (not comprehensive)
Internet Assignments	=	100 points (several short ones)
Map Quizzes		=	100 points
				600 points available

Grading Scale: I grade on a ten-point scale.
	  
ATTENDANCE AND MAKEUP POLICY FOR GEO 101, HIS 151, AND HIS 152

1. You are allowed to miss a maximum of EIGHT [8] class meetings 
    for any reason[s] whatsoever.  This covers sickness, work, flat tires, 
    alien invasion, sick relatives, marriage, court dates, heating 
    contractors, college activities, whatever.  Any absence, any reason--it
    counts.

2. If you miss more than eight [8] class meetings, you will be dropped 
     from the class roster.

3. If dismissed from a class, you will be assigned a grade of  WP (Withdrew 
    Passing) or WF (Withdrew Failing) based upon your grade average 
    as of your ninth absence.

4. Remember: as far as counting days missed is concerned, there is no such 
     thing as an "excused" or "unexcused" absence.  If you miss, it counts 
     towards the total of eight [8].

5. Three tardies count as one absence. Why? Because tardiness is not a 
    sin in and of itself, unless it becomes a habit.  Then it becomes 
    disruptive, irritating, and annoying -- and, unacceptable.

6. You may make-up a missed test or quiz if you can document (upon 
    request) that your absence on test day was an excusable absence. 
    Excused absences are defined as:
	a.  personal illness or illness of dependents or spouse living in 
       	     the household if the illness requires a doctor's supervision;
	b.  death in the family;
	c.  participation in authorized college activities;
	d.  others at the discretion of the instructor.
    A test or quiz missed for any other reason [an unexcused absence]CANNOT 
    be made up.  You will receive a grade of 0 [zero] for that test. 

7. Make-up day for Fall Quarter, 1995 is Friday, November _____, at 2:00 pm,
    in Room 205. This is the only time make-ups will be given.

<H1>HIS 101  Western Civilization I</H1>
<PRE>
5 credit hours;  5 contact hours
                                           
  A survey of the development of Western civilization from prehistory
  to 1715.

  The subject matter for this course concerns the origin and development
  of the political, economic, and social institutions, forces, and
  problems of the Western world up to 1715.  The development and
  consideration of these aspects of life should serve to make students
  familiar with the chief characteristics of Western Civilization; to let
  them see how it has grown and changed and how it has come to be as it
  is; to deepen their understanding of human nature through a study of
  what man has believed and undertaken in the past; to give them some
  insight into the institutions through which much of life is made
  effective; and to afford them background, perspective, and awareness
  which will aid them in interpreting and evaluating their experiences and
  ideas.

  This course does not attempt to teach a specific or standard set of
                
  values, attitudes, or assumptions, nor does it attempt to teach all of
  the infinite number of specific items of data, known and unknown, in
  Western Civilization.  Specific data seems most relevant when used to
  document or detail events, trends, concepts, or ideas.

  PREREQUISITE(S):   None


  REQUIRED TEXT(S):  The Western Experience:  To 1715, 5th Edition, by
  Mortimer Chambers et al.  McGraw-Hill, Inc. New York, N.Y., 1991.

 COURSE OBJECTIVES:

  1.  Students will comprehend how their civilization (Western
      Civilization) has developed and therefore, where it stands today,
      and their role in it through consideration of the evolving changes
      in the basic patterns of western thought and life.

  2.  Students will be able to organize, analyze, synthesize, and
      communicate, using appropriate data, the principle elements in the
      evolution of their civilization and the interrelatedness of these
      elements, through investigation into the origin and development of
      the political, economic, and social institutions, forces and
      problems of the Western world up to 1715.

 COURSE OUTLINE:

      I.   The Ancient Near East

      V.   The Early Middle Ages
     VI.   Monarchy in the Medieval West
    VII.   The Crusades
   VIII.   The Late Middle Ages
     IX.   Reformation in Religion
      X.   A Century of War and Revolt
     XI.   Beginnings of the Scientific Revolution
    XII.   The Triumph of Aristocrats and Kings

 COURSE REQUIREMENTS:

  Learning activities that accomplish the above objectives are:  assigned
  textbook readings, a book report essay, scheduled hour tests, and a
  final exam.

  GRADING CRITERIA:

  Tests for the course will consist of three announced hour tests and a
  final examination.  The hour tests, the book report essay, and the final
  exam, will each count 20% of the final grade.

  GRADING SCALE:

      90 - 100 = A
      80 -  89 = B
      70 -  79 = C
      60 -  69 = D
      Below 60 = F


 STUDENT ACCESS TO INSTRUCTORS:

  Full-time faculty members will post office hours to inform students of
  their availability for interaction and academic assistance.  Part-time
  faculty members will notify students of and provide for their avail-
  ability outside of class.  Students may call the College at (919)
  527-6223 and speak with the instructional assistants to schedule
  appointments with instructors.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS:

GRADING CRITERIA:

You will be responsible for all the material in all assigned chapters.
The instructor will assume that you have read the materials in the
chapters as lectures are presented.  This means that all the points
covered in the chapter may not be covered in class. Such a procedure puts
the responsibility on you, the student, for reading the material and
asking questions about points you may not understand.  If you do not do
this, you will, in all likelihood, not do as well as you would like.  The
basic assumption of the instructor is that in order to make a "C" in this
class, you will spend a minimum of one hour reading and studying outside
of class for every one hour that you spend in class.

Further, you will be responsible for ALL material presented in class,
whether it be lecture, films, or class discussion. There will be four 
(4) multiple choice/essay tests during the quarter, including the final.
If you miss a test and have not given the instructor prior notice, and
do not have a certified excuse, you will receive a "0" on that test.
If you miss a test that you are going to be allowed to make up, you 
are expected to take the test on the first day that you return to 
school.  Further, you are responsible for working out all arrangements
with the instructor.  Pop quizzes will comprise an additional 100
possible points. There will be several pop quizzes during the quarter,
with each quiz having a value of 05 points.  These quizzes will be added
together at the end of the quarter and counted like a regular test score.
if you miss a quiz, you will NOT be allowed to  make it up without a
verified excuse.  If you are late for class and miss a quiz, you will NOT
be allowed to make it up without a verified excuse.  By now, the message
that being in class, and being in class on time is very strongly
recommended should have come across loud and clear.

If you need to contact me, please make every effort to contact me at 
school, and if I am not here, please leave a message.  Do NOT call
me at home unless there is an absolute emergency .

Your final grade for the quarter will be computed on a 10-point scale.

	A = 90 - 100  
	B = 80 -  89  
	C = 70 -  70  
	D = 60 -  69  
	F = > 60   or 


 STUDENT ACCESS TO INSTRUCTORS:

 Full-time faculty members will post office hours to inform students of
 their availability for interaction and academic assistance.  Part-time 
 faculty members will notify students of and provide for their avail-
 ability outside of class.  Students may call the College at (919) 
 527-6223 and speak with the instructional assistants to schedule 
 appointments with instructors.

 ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS:

    "Absences seriously disrupt students' progress in a course and 
 diminish the quality of group interaction.  Since there is a close 
 correlation between the number of absences and the final grade, 
 students are expected to attend punctually all lecture and laboratory
 sessions in the courses for which they are registered, beginning with 
 the first session following registration for the courses.  Since 
 punctuality is an important factor, three tardies and/or early 
 departures will count as one absence, and students must be in atten-
 dance for 50% of the class time to get credit for the day's attendance.
 Students should notify instructors of planned and emergency tardiness,
 absences, and early departures. 

    "Although occasional absences may be unavoidable, they in no way 
 excuse students from meeting the requirements of the courses.  Absences
 (excused and/or unexcused) are calculated from the first class meeting 
 following enrollment.  "Excessive" absences are defined as absences 
 totaling 15% of the scheduled class meetings.  15% translates into the
 following formula:   for a 5 credit hour class, 15% = 8 hours of
 absences; 4 credit hours = 7; 3 credit hours = 5; 2 credit hours = 3; 
 and 1 credit hour = 2.  Excessive absences may, at the instructor's 
 discretion, result in suspension from the class. 

    "However, students who miss two consecutive weeks, not including the
 first week of the quarter are suspended from class on the first day of
 the third week.  Students with prolonged absences should either contact
 their instructors so that they are not suspended, or officially drop the
 classes so that attendance is not factored into their final grades.

    "Suspensions for excessive or prolonged absences will result in a 
 grade of W (Withdrew), WP (Withdrew Passing), or WF (Withdrew Failing)
 based on the students' academic standing on the day of suspension. 

    "The classification of absences as excused requires verification 
 and allows students to make up missed work, in accordance with the
 instructors' make-up procedures, but they are still computed as 
 absences in the 15% tabulation.  Excused absences are identified as
 follows:

	1.	personal illness or illness of dependents
		or spouse living in the household, if the
		illness requires a doctor's supervision

	2.	death in the family

        3.  participation in authorized college
            activities
 
        4.  others at the discretion of the instructor

    "All instructors will adhere to the established procedure as printed
 in the LCC catalog, will notify students in writing of their make-up
 procedures, and will, when possible, confer with students with exces-
 sive and/or refer those students to counselors.  Students' grades,
 however, cannot be raised or lowered more than one letter grade based 
 on excessive absences and/or attendance.  This does not take into 
 consideration the effects of students' failure to comply with
 instructors' make-up procedures.

    "Student appeals will be made through the Academic Affairs 
 Committee." (LCC Catalog)

Class procedures are as follows:

a.   There will be no make-up tests for unexcused, uncertified 
     absences.  The grade will be recorded as zero.  It is the 
     student's responsibility to know what has been missed, to
     present verification, and to make immediate arrangements 
     for makeup.  A student is responsible for meeting with the 
     instructor on the first day that he/she returns to arrange 
     makeup work, and failure to do so will result in denial of 
     makeup privileges.  Scheduled tests that a student misses 
     because of an excused absence must be made up on the first 
     day that the student returns to class.

b.   Any student who cuts more than six class periods may be 
     dropped.  Absences count from the first day of class, and 
     you must be present for 80% of the class meetings to get 
     credit for the course.  This means that even if you have 
     some excused absences you MAY NOT miss more than a total 
     of five class meetings whether your absences are excused, 
     or unexcused, or some combination of the two.

c.   Roll will be taken at the beginning of the class.  Any 
     student that comes in late must ask the instructor to 
     change his/her status from that of absent to present before
     he/she leaves class that class period; otherwise, the atten-
     dance record will not be changed.  Three tardies will 
     constitute one absence.

No teacher has ever taught anything to anyone.  People learn them- 
selves.  If we look at the word "educator" it comes from the Latin 
"educare", meaning to lead, to guide.  Teachers try to guide students
through the learning process.  However, we are not psychic.  Please feel
free to ask questions in class.  Office hours will be posted and students
may feel free to set up appointments if special help is needed or
desired.

<P><B>Please note- this page is under construction!</B></P>

<P><BR>

The most important (and most enjoyable to teach) chemistry classes
are the introductory courses; these are the place at which students
have the opportunity to learn something about the world around them,
and to learn the necessary fundamental concepts to allow them to make
educated decisions about things like toxic waste disposal, nuclear
power, use of pesticides, plastics recycling, and any of another of
the many issues we are confronted with every day. I don't think the
classroom should be an advocacy forum for the chemical industry, but
I do think it is our responsibility to discuss these issues, and give
the students the fundamental facts upon which to base their own
decisions.<BR>

<BR>

Most chemistry classes don't deal with these issues; first year
chemistry is the only exposure many students will <B>ever</B> get to
chemistry, and I think it is both exciting and challenging to try and
help them realise how important chemistry is to them, and how much it
influences their lives.<BR>

<BR>

I believe the reason we have difficulty getting students to enrol in
chemistry courses lies in the way we teach chemistry. Granted,
learning chemistry (as well as doing well in class) is challenging,
but I think everyone would find chemistry interesting if it were
presented from the appropriate point of view.<BR>

<BR>

Chemistry is a science established on curiosity. The way we teach
chemistry has nothing to do with curiosity. The first day of class we
stand before a group of bright, enthusiastic people, and proceed to
reinforce all the bad experiences they have had in previous chemistry
classes by <B><U>telling</U></B> them what chemistry is about. Read
the book. Do problems. Answer questions on the test. Get a grade. All
the discovery, the curiosity, is lost! Chemistry laboratories are not
places of exploration of the unknown, they are the place where
students learn some technique (the value of which is debateable
except for those students continuing on), and try to get the right
answer; students do not explore the unknown.<BR>

<BR>

I believe we should teach chemistry with reference to exploring what
chemistry it means in student's lives. My research plans discuss this
in more detail; we need to allow students to see the beauty and
wonder in chemistry that researchers see. I think the way to do this
is to teach them chemistry in the context of what they know already.
Simple questions like 'why does Scotch tape stick?', 'what causes a
suntan?', 'why does salt curing keep meat from spoiling?', or 'how do
fire retardants work?' can lead directly to lectures on
intermolecular forces, biochemistry, or combustion and redox
reactions. By starting with what students already know, and then
developing principles to what they don't know (and what we want them
to learn), we are teaching them chemistry in a context they can
relate to, <U>and</U> teaching it in the way chemistry is really
conducted in the research lab-- start with what you know, and go on
to answer the questions you don't know.<BR>

<BR>

I plan on asking the students what they are curious about, and use
these questions within lectures, or as papers that the students
research themselves. Far too little writing is involved in
introductory chemistry classes, and this is where we need to bring
them up to a university writing level; the ability to write about
somewhat abstract topics like chemistry is a valuable skill.<BR>

<BR>

Upper level classes are also important. The chemistry and science
majors, however, have already seen something in chemistry which
strikes their curiosity; this needs to be encouraged, and this is
where research can be a powerful teaching tool. Research is where
students learn that science doesn't follow the simple structure they
see in laboratory classes; things just don't work sometimes, and the
ability to solve problems is more valuable than some of the facts the
students learn in classes. By publishing their research in the
refereed literature, students can contribute to scientific knowledge
in a way which gives them recognition and pride.</P>

<P>My research interests lie in two broad areas: synthetic transition
metal chemistry, and chemical education.<BR>

I am fundamentally interested in the use of multinuclear (195Pt, 31P,
15N, 103Rh, 13C, for example) nuclear magnetic resonance as a tool to
follow the formation, reactions, and equilibria of transition metal
complexes in solution; projects within this area would include:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>development of systematic, reasoned approaches by which metal
   cluster complexes can be formed in solution; for example:
   
   <UL>
      <LI>analogues of
      Pt<SUB>2</SUB>(SO<SUB>4</SUB>)<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>4-</SUP> and
      Pt<SUB>2</SUB>(HPO<SUB>4</SUB>)<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>4-</SUP> using
      strong organic acids, assembled via a process the reverse of
      disproportionation (already demonstrated in my thesis research)
      
      <LI>1,3- diphenyltriazine as a bridging ligand for analogues of
      Pt<SUB>2</SUB>(P<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB>)<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>4-</SUP>
      
      <LI>mixed metal analogues of
      Pt<SUB>2</SUB>(SO<SUB>4</SUB>)<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>4-</SUP>,
      Pt<SUB>2</SUB>(HPO<SUB>4</SUB>)<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>4-</SUP>,
      Pt<SUB>2</SUB>(P<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB>)<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>4-</SUP>,
      and similar species (using Pd, Os, Ir, Au, and especially Rh
      due to its NMR sensitivity)
      
      <LI>exploration of new bridging ligands, especially those with
      NMR sensitive nuclei like phosphorus
   </UL>
   
   <LI>studies on the interactions of amino acids, peptides, and
   polypeptides with analogues of Pt(NH3)2(H2O)2 using different
   metals
   
   <LI>studies on the interactions of small polypeptides that are
   involved in assembly of nanoclusters of CdS by an aquatic
   invertebrate; this project would involve collaboration with a
   project at the Center for Drug Design and Development at the
   University of Queensland, Australia
   
   <LI>model studies of the reaction chemistry of the active site of
   selected metalloenzymes
</UL>

<P><BR>

My interests in chemical education lie in:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>the use of multimedia and computer technology (and the
   internet) in the classroom and laboratory, particularly for
   introductory level students:
   
   <UL>
      <LI>the use of videodisc and videotape to augment lectures and
      laboratories; I worked with Loretta Jones and Stan Smith at U
      of Illinois where we used video technology and interactive
      computers to emphasize lecture material and provide
      challenging, self paced video laboratories (<I>J.Chem.Ed.</I>,
      <B>1984</B>, 61(10), 864, and 66(1), 8)
      
      <LI>the use of modern computer acquisition and analysis in
      laboratories; John Amend at Montana State, for example, has
      developed a laboratory interface system which enables students
      to simply program computers to collect laboratory data and
      perform rapid calculations and data analysis
      (<I>J.Chem.Ed.</I>, <B>1990</B>, 67(4), 333 and 67(7), 593). I
      helped debug some of the initial versions of the programming,
      taught laboratories for several years using this system, helped
      develop new labs, and update old labs.
      
      <LI>using computers to administer quizzes outside lecture time;
      at NC State we now use the Q System developed by Joe Lagowski
      at U of Texas
      
      <LI>using computers to provide exam question individualization
   </UL>
   
   <LI>development of introductory level courses which emphasize
   everyday aspects of chemistry, particularly for courses geared
   towards non-science students
   
   <LI>outreach programs and materials for primary and secondary
   teachers, including multimedia and computer technology

MEMORANDUM #1

DATE:  27 November, 1995

TO:  GEO 101 Students

FROM:  Ken Tyndall

RE:  Written Assignment:  State Department Briefing Book

	You didnt really think you could get out of here without doing some sort of project, now did you?  Here's what we're a-gonna do:  We (meaning you) are going to write a geography-based briefing book for the Department of State of the United States of America.  Here's the deal:

	The president has just appointed new ambassadors to represent U.S. interests all around the world.  We need good ambassadors who are knowledgeable about the countries they are assigned to.  Good ambassadors knows not only about the physical and political geography of their mission state, but also about the economic geography (Is this country a potential market for U.S. goods, or a potential competitor?), the population geography (Is this nation growing too fast to support itself?  Will it need U.S. aid?  Are conditions ripe for a flood of refugees?), and even the cultural geography (many an ambassador has gotten off to a bad start by insulting his/her hosts because they did not know about local customs, food taboos, or whatever). 

	Thus good, well-informed ambassadors need information on the nations they are assigned to -- and lots of it.  They rely very heavily on big, thick briefing books for this data.  But, alas, the State Department folks who usually compile briefing books are all tied up with Bosnia, China, Russia, and..., well, you get the picture. This is where you come in, my budding geographers.  You (yes, you) will compile these very important documents because, as we know, geography is a diverse discipline and geographers are a smart bunch of folks.

	The specifics of the assignment:

	1)  Your briefing book will not be a prose-style paper, per se.  Instead, it will
	    be more of a running commentary summarizing important information and
	    a compilation of documents, articles, maps, graphs, charts, tables and other data.  
	    The length is largely up to you -- whatever it takes.  (Hint:  Longer is almost 
	    certainly better.  Get it?)

	2)  You will be assigned a nation to research, unless you have a particularly
	     strong desire to write about a specific country.

	3)  Your source options are bountiful, to say the least.  Consider the following
	     as logical starting points:

		The Reader's Guide to Periodic Literature
		The New York Times (a gold mine, esp. for its index)
		periodicals such as Time, Newsweek, U.S. News and World Report
		Foreign Affairs (a great journal if ever there was one)
		other periodicals, such as Atlantic Monthly, The New Yorker, The
		New Republic, or hey, how about National Geographic
		Infotrac, and other computerized resources in the LRC

	4)  Your most important resource, however, will be the Internet.  If you are
	    not familiar with the Internet or have never surfed the Web, you are in
	    for a treat.  All the information you need on this will be provided in class
	    and in later handouts.

	 5)  What sort of information should you include?  That can vary, depending
	     the country in question.  For a U.S. business rival, such as Japan or South
	     Korea, economic geography may be paramount.  Cultural information, ie:
	     diets and food taboos, religious and/or social customs, and so forth are
	     always important.  (Remember, you don't want the ambassador to commit
	     an embarrassing faux pas, as you may be blamed for it.)
		  On the other hand, for a LDC such as Bangladesh or Egypt, population
	     pressures may be building and leading to a potential crisis, so demographic
	     data may be paramount there.  Just remember the major areas of geography
	     that we will study this quarter (see your chapter titles for a clue) and
	     think accordingly.  Think in terms of:
			basic physical geography, esp. climate and resources
			demographics
			cultural data
			economic data
			political data

	6)  All briefing books are due at 9:00 AM, Friday, February 16, 1996.

	7)  As always, if you have any questions or difficulties, please feel free to
	    come see me in my office or after class.  Good luck.

<P>My interests in chemical education lie in two areas: the use of
multimedia technology in the classroom and laboratory, and the
development of courses in introductory chemistry oriented towards the
chemistry of daily experience. I have been involved with several of
the most innovative groups in the United States using computers in
chemical education. John Amend (<I>J. Chem. Ed.</I>, <B>1990</B>,
67(4), 333, and 67(7), 593), at Montana State University, has
developed a laboratory interface system which has received
enthusiastic responses from University and High School teachers; the
software uses menus to drive the hardware enabling students to write
simple programs to collect their data (forcing them to understand
what is being measured), and quickly perform calculations and data
analysis. Students thus spend their time thinking about how and why
experiments work, and what the results mean. I helped John develop
some new laboratories for the non-science major (i.e. nursing,
business, agriculture) general chemistry course, and was involved in
updating the laboratories through several years of use.<BR>

<BR>

Loretta Jones (now at U. of Northern Colorado) and Stan Smith (<I>J.
Chem. Ed.</I>, <B>1984</B>, 61(10), 864, and 66(1), 8) made the
University of Illinois the leader in the use of interactive computers
and video technology to emphasize materials in lectures, and provide
students with challenging, self paced laboratories. I directed up to
twenty-eight teaching assistants in the teaching of the largest
single general chemistry course at U of I (2000 students per year),
and taught my own students as well. With the script committee at U of
I we developed and I narrated several new videotapes to supplement my
course, and at Montana State I assisted a visiting professor, Ev
Nienhouse of Ferris State College (now retired), in making videotaped
laboratories for a Forensic Science class we offered at night.<BR>

<BR>

While at NC State U. I worked with Alton Banks, who produced the
<U>Periodic</U> <U>Table</U> videodisc; we used the interactive
videodisc lessons developed at U of I at NCSU, and Alton and I used
the Q-System quiz programming developed by Joe Lagowski at the
University of Texas to give weekly quizzes to our students in the
department computer laboratory. I believe computer and video
technologies can be powerful tools to augment lectures and allow
students to discover the beauty and wonder of chemistry. The computer
interface developed by John Amend are now in use in the chemistry
majors laboratories at NCSU. I believe the use of these sorts of
supplements and technologies can be of tremendous value in education.
We have used the interactive videodics lessons here at LCC since
Sept. 1996, and they have received considerable praise from
students.<BR>

<BR>

The teaching of chemistry at universities has largely been oriented
towards the science major; while some schools have developed watered
down versions of such science major classes for nurses or
agricultural students, the general outlook and emphasis of all
classes is much the same as for the science major class. It has been
my experience that students who are not studying sciences or
engineering do not take any chemistry, opting instead largely for
biology (and to a lesser extent physics) if they are required to take
a science class as part of a core curriculum, for instance.<BR>

<BR>

I think it is clear the reason behind this is the meaningfulness, or
sense of reality, that the courses entail. Nearly all of a biology
class involves something you can hold, or visualize; physics involves
motion, inertia, friction, force. These concepts students see
everyday, and while they may not know the fundamental principles or
mathematics behind them, they are tactile 'things' with which
students relate.<BR>

<BR>

Chemistry is very much the same sort of topic- cleaning laundry,
cooking food, perming hair, combustion in a car engine; these are all
things to which students can relate from their everyday life.
Chemistry is intimately involved in such processes, but they tend not
to be related to the principles discussed in lectures.<BR>

I plan to develop a course or series of courses geared towards
non-science students, allowing them to learn chemistry on a more
personal, daily level of experience. Such a course would involve less
math and calculations, and instead focus on how real-life examples
demonstrate the fundamental principles of chemistry; for example,
explosives are perfect cases for gas laws; adhesives demonstrate
intermolecular forces; cooking involves biochemistry and acid/base
chemistry. Sources of this information are readily available ('The
Chemistry of Cooking' by Coenders, 'Chemistry in the Marketplace' by
Selinger, for example), the ideas just need to be melded into the
structure of a course.<BR>

<BR>

The advantage of such a class will be students better informed about
how chemistry affects their lives; they should have gained an
appreciation for the costs and trade-offs involved in living in our
society. Once established, I would expect that enrollments would
increase as students learned of a chemistry class that really teaches
them something about chemistry as they observe it, rather than as a
book tries to explain it. This program would initially be oriented
toward the non-science university student as a science elective or
core course. Of course, the science major courses need to remain
largely calculation oriented, but I believe we should emphasize the
real-life aspects of the chemistry in these classes as well by
starting topics with student's questions (collected early in the
class), and using the concepts to explain the questions.<BR>

<BR>

I also envision the course disassembled into discrete packets which
could be tailored towards primary and secondary students; with a
group of primary and secondary teachers we would construct units that
could be chosen by teachers to illustrate topics such as chemical
waste, detergents, plastics, cooking, drugs, forensic analysis... any
topic of interest. My experience developing, writing, narrating,
producing, and editing videotapes would allow the easy involvement of
video technology in such programs, effectively supplementing the
packets for use by secondary or primary teachers. Over time a library
of lessons, demonstrations, and video resources would develop from
which teachers could select materials to augment their classes.<BR>

<BR>

Summer 1994 I was involved with 'Team Science' (A.J.Banks, J.C.Park,
D.G.Haase, T.Boyette, NSF Symposium for Outstanding Teacher
Enhancement Projects -II. March 15, 1994; 207th National ACS meeting,
San Diego, CA; 'Team Science: An Outreach', A.J.Banks, T.R.Boyette,
D.G.Haase, J.C.Park, R.Kirkley, 13th Biennial Conference on Chemical
Education, Bucknell University, 1994), an outreach program for high
school science, chemistry, and physics teachers; the program brings a
group of teachers to the university from several different counties
in the area for four weeks of all day workshops. The teachers learn
how to use computers, and how to teach with computers; we have many
canned experiments the teachers do using Vernier Software sensors and
software to perform experiments. As the four weeks progress, and the
teachers develop facility using the computers, they then develop
their own experiments for their students to do, and share these with
the other teachers. The most important part of the 'Team Science'
program, however, is that 'Team Science' provides support throughout
the year by bringing eight computers to the high schools several
times throughout the school year. (It is all well and good for the
teachers to learn new computer and teaching skills using computers,
but the effort serves no purpose when the teachers return to their
schools and have no computers.) Thus the program provides the
computers and sensors as well, shuttling them among the schools
during the school year. Clearly, this kind of support for secondary
(and perhaps primary) teachers should be the domain of higher
education.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>About This Service</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B>OnDemand Research</B> is a new and convenient way to stay abreast of changes that affect your investments.
<P>
<B>The research you want is here.</B><BR>
OnDemand Research puts over 250,000 financial reports at your fingertips.
With the push of a button, you can research many of the securities you're thinking of buying, <I>before you invest</I>.
<P>
<B>Earn free reports.</B><BR>
Research reports on a particular company or mutual fund are sold on a per report basis, with each report costing one or more report units. (Most reports cost one unit.)
 Your initial 5 report units are free. You then receive one free report unit for each executed transaction in your account(s) with The Net Investor. Additional report units used over free units earned during any given month will be billed to your brokerage account at the end of the month at the rate of $1.50 per unit. You must be able to cover the debit with available cash in your account within 10 days of month end in order to have continued access to this service.
<P>
<B>Reports can be automatically faxed to you.</B><BR>
Reports you select can be automatically faxed to you within minutes at no additional cost. Simply specify your fax number when ordering documents.

<B>View reports on-line with Adobe Acrobat.</B><BR>
Your reports can be downloaded, viewed on-line, and printed in their original formats
with Adobe Acrobat, the new standard in paperless publishing.
Adobe Acrobat's Portable Document Format files are formatted electronic documents
that can be viewed and printed with an Adobe Acrobat PDF file reader on any computer platform -- Macintosh, Windows, MS-DOS, or UNIX.
Free Acrobat software for reading, navigating, and printing PDF documents
can be downloaded at <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/">Adobe Systems</A>,

<h3>Private Asset Portfolio</h3>

The Private Security & Asset Portfolio allows you to use the PAWWS Portfolio 
Accounting system to keep track of assets held elsewhere. You privately enter the value of your assets,
and post transactions or change their value as often as you'd like.  These assets and transactions
may then be consolidated or reported separately in any of the Portfolio Accounting reports. The Net Investor does not have access to information held in this database.
<p>

<ol>
Example:<br>
You want to track your personal possessions for insurance purposes . You enter these
assets into your PAWWS portfolio by making up your own "ticker" symbol, description
and initial value or cost basis. You then enter individual transactions or reprice the value
of the asset. Because it's a private database, transactions are not accessible by The Net
Investor or PAWWS.  The information is also secured through Netscape's SSL encryption
devices and an application firewall.
</ol>
<P>
<B>Pricing:</B> $5.95 per month ($9.95 per month to non-clients). Includes online stock Price and Volume graphs.

<H2>Personalized Client Service</H2>
<H3><I>Backed by Experience and Stability</I></H3>

The Net Investor is committed to providing you the
best brokerage service anywhere. Our commitment is
drawn from the experience of our parent company,  <a href="/How_phtml/howe.shtml">Howe
Barnes Investments, Inc.</A>, a respected Chicago
brokerage firm and a member of the NYSE since 1915.
The Net Investor's concern about our customers begins
with our <a href="/How_phtml/manage.shtml">senior management</A>, longtime leaders in the
national securities industry.  
<p>
<H3><I>Responsive and Experienced Professionals</I></H3>

The Net Investor trading desk ensures secure,
accurate, and fast transactions.  In addition, you
have direct access by phone or e-mail to a
professional, licensed, non-commission Account
Manager. Your calls are answered by real people -
when it really counts - during trading hours. Our
Account Managers are experienced securities industry
professionals, not order clerks. They are trained in
securities trading, market information resources and
the workings of our Internet site, able to give you
assistance on a broad range of questions. 
<p>
<H3><I>On-going Service</I></H3>

We won't forget about you after the trade is executed.
We are committed to making sure your account is
properly maintained and to addressing any changes,
problems or questions that may arise. Our operations
department (back office) is on site, staffed by long-
term, dedicated employees. We don't have to call
across the country to a third party to handle any
questions or concerns you may have about your account.
Special requests are never a problem.
<p>
<h3><i>The Net Investor Execution Guarantee</i></h3>

Your satisfaction with how we conduct your transaction is
guaranteed. If we ever fail to properly execute your order, we
will refund the commission.

<h3><i>The Net Investor Service Guarantee</i></h3> 

The Net Investor is committed to providing high quality service
as well as low commissions. 
To that aim, we guarantee that one of our professional, non-
commissioned Account Managers will be immediately available to
assist you by telephone during market hours (of the New York
Stock Exchange), or your trade is free. You can also write to us
at <a href="/How_phtml/mailboard.shtml">invest@pawws.com</a> anytime of the day or night. 
<P>
<h3><i>How to Reach Us</i></h3>

If you have any questions or concerns, please call us at 1-800-
638-4250 or e-mail us at <a href="/How_phtml/mailboard.shtml">invest@pawws.com</a>. We enjoy hearing from

<h3>DTN News</h3></center><hr><center><h4>DTN NEWS      02 08/03/95     Blinder Says
He Is Open to Cut Rates</h4></center><hr>
(MktNews) Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alan Blinder indicated Thursday that 
circumstances may arise where a further reduction in short-term interest rates 
is warranted, even if the economy continues on a path toward resumed "trend" 
growth. However, Blinder suggested in a Market News Service interview that, in 
his mind, the conditions are not yet right for taking the federal  funds  rate 
down another notch from the current 5.75% level. 
<p><HR> 
(AP)  Outlet  Communications  Inc. has agreed to a $326 million buyout offer 
from the National Broadcasting Co. in a deal that will add three  television 
stations  to  NBC's  broadcasting  stable,  the  companies  said  Thursday.  A 
competing bidder that had previously  agreed  to  buy  Outlet  for  about  $35 
million  less  agreed  to drop a legal challenge to the deal with NBC. 
<p><HR> 
<p>Newbridge  Networks  (NYSE: NN) announced net earnings for the quarter 
are expected to be approximately US $0.32 per share fully  diluted  compared 
to  net  earnings  of  US$0.36  per share a year ago.  Analysts expected $0.47 
according  to  Zacks  Investment  Research.  Revenues  are  expected   to   be approximately 
$195  million, an increase from revenues of $171 million in the first quarter of the preceding
fiscal year. 
<p><p>Sales in the first quarter were higher than in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
1995 in the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America, but lower in North America 
and Europe.

<center><h4>DTN NEWS      13 08/03/95    News  in 
Brief</h4></center><hr>
<p>Paris (Bloomberg) --  The Bank of France  lopped a larger-than-expected 
half point off the 5- to-10 day securities repurchase rate to 6.5 percent from 
7 percent. Most traders and analysts expected a quarter-point cut. 
<p><HR> 
(AP)  -  The  Senate  Judiciary Committee voted 9-8 to lift  major league 
baseball's exemption from antitrust laws. The bill would allow  the  players 
union  to  sue  in  federal  court  to  block  unilateral  imposition  of work 
conditions by team owners, but it would not affect franchise relocation  rules 
or the minor leagues. 
<p><HR> 
(Bloomberg)  Digital  Equipment  Corp. said Bernhard Auer, the head of its 
personal computer business, resigned effective  immediately,  two  days  after 
Digital posted quarterly earnings below analysts' estimates. 
<p><HR> 
<p>EL MONTE,  California  (UPI)  -  Eight  Thai  nationals  faced  arraignment 
Thursday   on   charges  including  slavery  and  false  imprisonment  for allegedly keeping more
than 60 immigrants as virtual slaves for years behind a barbed wire fence while forcing them to
labor in a garment factory. 
<p><HR> 
(UPI) -  Nervous depositors in Taiwan  crowded into credit cooperatives 
Thursday to withdraw savings a day  after  the  government  announced  it  was 
taking  over a large co-operative in central Taiwan. The government was forced 
to take over all debt and liability of the Fourth Credit Cooperative of  Chang 
Hua after the bank was drained of more than $304 million in four days.

<h3>International Business Machines</h3>
<br>

<b>OVERVIEW</b>
<hr>
If you hear a big "whoosh"  coming from the general direction of Armonk, 
New York, that's just IBM coming up for a gulp of air. After 3 years of 
losses totaling more than $15 billion, the world's biggest computer 
company finally got its head above water in 1994. CEO Louis Gerstner 
continues to tinker with the company to make sure it doesn't sink again. 
To cut costs he has shut plants, sold real estate, and laid off workers.
<p>     Burdened with a bloated bureaucracy that was slow to react to 
the downsizing and networking trends in the computer industry, IBM saw 
sales in its lucrative mainframe and minicomputer business evaporate in 
the early 1990s. So the company began concentrating on networking, 
client/server systems, PCs, and software to boost sales. However, a 
resurgence in high-end products (mainframes, minicomputers, and data-
storage products) is what brought the company back into the black in 
1994. Most analysts predict the resurgence is only temporary, and 
Gerstner continues to work to shift the company's product mix toward PCs 
and software. In 1995 he restructured IBM's sales organization and its 
software business.
<p>     With more than $10 billion in cash in its coffers, IBM may make 
some acquisitions in the near future. In June 1995 software maker Lotus 
Development accepted IBM's $3.52 billion takeover bid.
<p>
<p>
<b>WHEN</b>
<hr>
In 1914 National Cash Register's star salesman, 40-year-old Thomas J. 
Watson, left to rescue the flagging Computing-Tabulating-Recording 
Company. Watson aggressively marketed C-T-R's Hollerith machine (a punch 
card tabulator) and supplied tabulators to the US government during WWI, 
tripling C-T-R's revenues to almost $15 million by 1920.
<p>     Watson then expanded operations to Europe, Latin America, and 
the Far East and in 1924 changed the company name to International 
Business Machines. IBM soon dominated the market for tabulators, time 
clocks, and electric typewriters, becoming the US's largest office 
machinery firm by 1940, with sales approaching $50 million.
<p>     IBM perfected electromechanical calculation (the Harvard Mark I, 
1944) but initially dismissed the potential of computers. When Remington 
Rand's commercial computer (UNIVAC, 1951) began replacing IBM machines, 
IBM quickly responded, using its superior R&D and marketing to build a 
market share near 80% in the 1960s and 1970s; competitors scattered to 
niches on the periphery.
<p>     Triumphs achieved under Thomas J. Watson, Jr. (president in 
1952), included IBM's first computer (the 701, 1952), the STRETCH 
systems (which eliminated vacuum tubes, 1960), and the first compatible 
family of computers (System/360, 1964; System/370, 1970). Accompanying 
innovations included the FORTRAN programming language (1957) and floppy 
disk storage (1971). IBM later moved into mid-range systems (System/38, 
1978; AS/400, 1988). The IBM PC (1981) spawned entirely new PC-related 
industries.
<p>     The shift to open, smaller systems along with greater 
competition in all of IBM's segments caused wrenching change. After 
posting profits of $6.6 billion in 1984, IBM began a slow slide. The 
company began reducing its work force in 1986 and by 1992 cut worldwide 
employment by 100,000 through attrition and early retirement 
inducements. IBM also sold many noncomputer businesses, such as its 
copier division (to Kodak, 1988); Rolm telecommunications (to Siemens, 
1988); and its typewriter, keyboard, personal printer, and supplies 
business (Lexmark, to Clayton & Dubilier, 1991).
<p>     IBM restructured in 1991, and in 1992 the company set up a 
European unit to sell low-cost clones of its own computers. Also in 1992 
the company formed a joint venture with Sears called Advantis to provide 
voice-and-data network services. In 1993 IBM and Groupe Bull entered a 
joint venture to develop software.
<p>     In 1994 IBM sold its Federal Systems unit, which provides 
computer systems and services to the government, to Loral for $1.5 
billion. That same year, in a challenge to Intel's dominance of the 
microprocessor business, IBM agreed to manufacture computer chips 
designed by Cyrix.
<p>     In 1995 several of IBM's highest-ranking executives, including 
chief strategist James Cannavino, left the company as Gerstner continued 
to clean house.

<p>
<B>Take an in-depth look at any of 1,500 mutual funds with Morningstar Mutual Funds reports</B>
<P>
Each Morningstar Mutual Funds report offers a timely one-page mutual-fund profile. Using a report, you can evaluate:<p>
<LI>Written analysis -- Learn which statistics deserve the most attention, what the manager is thinking, and if the fund can help your portfolio.
<P>
<LI>Historical Style Boxes -- Quickly discover if a fund has held fast to its strategy, or if it changes year-by-year.
<P>
<LI>Top 25 Portfolio Holdings -- Review the top stock and bond holdings to find out what's driving a fund's performance.
<P>
<LI>Manager Biography -- Find out who's responsible for a fund's track record.
<P>
<LI>Tax Analysis -- Determine how taxes have affected returns and what taxes may be ahead.
<P>
<LI>Special Securities -- find out if a fund invests in derivatives -- and decide if you want that kind of risk in your portfolio.
<P>
<LI>Performance Graphs -- Now you can chart the growth of $10,000 in a fund and see what happened when the manager changed.
<P>
Along with each single-page report (updated every 20 weeks), we include an extra page that includes the fund's most current star rating, trailing total returns for seven time periods, yield percentage, and more.

<CENTER><B><h2>Online Account Application Process</h2></B></CENTER>
<HR>
<p>
You can open an account directly online, by phone, or call to request an application by postal mail.<br>  
Here are the four simple steps to complete the on-line application:
<p>
      <b>1. Use Netscape or an "SSL Aware" Browser</b>
<p><UL>
<LI> The Net Investor is at a secured Netscape Web server site.   
When you use Netscape or another "SSL aware" browser, such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer, RSA's
SSL encryption protocol protects the information you
send us by scrambling the data.  We require clients to
use their browser in its encrypted mode when
completing the account application or submitting orders. 
<p>
You can purchase Netscape in many computer and software
outlets, or download it directly from <a href="http://home.netscape.com/">Netscape
Communications Corp.'s</a> web site.</UL>
<p>
<b>2.  Register with the PAWWS Financial Network</b>
 <p>  <UL>        
<LI> Before accessing the account application you must
register with PAWWS, our site provider.  There is no cost to register and your name will not be sold or used for solicitation. The PAWWS
registration page asks you for a log-in name and
password, your name, and postal and e-mail addresses.</UL>
<p>     
<b>3.  Complete our online application in less than 10
minutes:</b><ul>
      
     <p>
     <li> Fill in the information about your self and
      your bank, including its name, address and
      account number. We need this information for
      credit references.
      <p>
      <li> If you want to transfer an account or funds
      from another brokerage firm, give us the name of the firm and your account number. The Account Transfer form link will appear after you submit the application on-line.
<p>
</UL>
<b>4.  Mail Us the Required Forms</b><ul>

     <li>Once you have submitted your application, you
      receive on-line a list of other documents that
      require your signature.  Print and sign the
      documents, and then postal mail them to us.
<p></ul>
After we receive your signed documents and your account is funded, you will be notified by e-mail that your account has
been activated for on-line activity.
<p>
<b>Please Note: </b><br> 
Before submitting <b>buy</b> orders, you must have  50% of the order amount on deposit.  The balance is due by the settlement date, which is three business days after the trade date. To sell a security, it must be in negotiable form and on deposit in your account.<P>

<h3>Detail Description of Portfolio Reports</h3>



The PAWWS portfolio system provides detailed reports on your portfolio value and transactions.  The system includes the following reports and services at no cost to Net Preferred and Net Value clients:

<p>

<b>Net Worth Report:</b>  This statement provides the value of securities held by The Net Investor, using 20-minute delayed quotes (or real-time quotes, if you have subscribed to this service). <a href="/How_phtml/netwrth.shtml">Sample Report</A>

<p>



<b>Schedule of Gains and Losses:</b> This report allows clients to keep track of their gains and losses

of individual securities to predict and to minimize their tax burdens. For a given tax year, it's

often possible to offset gains on one security with the losses on another. By keeping track of

gains and losses, this statement helps identify possible offsetting transactions. Accounting jargon

refers to the gain or loss on a sold position as a "realized" gain. The gain or loss on a position

still held is called an "unrealized" gain. Only realized gains are taxable. With this in mind, here's

an example of how you might use the schedule of gains and losses. <a href="/How_phtml/gainloss.shtml">Sample Report</A>

<p>

<ol>

<i>Example:</i>

<br>

First you might like to see your current realized G/L. Set "Begin Date" to the first day of

your fiscal year (perhaps 1/1/95), and "End Date" to today. Make sure the "Include open

positions" button is set on "No", and run the report. If you have a large loss, maybe this is

your opportunity to sell a position with a large gain, and vice versa. Run the report again

after flipping "Include open positions" to "Yes". Now you'll have a list of current

holdings as well, to help you pick possible candidates for sale. Experts usually

recommend against making sales solely for tax reasons, but if you were considering

action anyway, they can become the deciding factor.

</ol>

<p>



<b>Activity/Edit Report: </b> This is a record of all transactions that have taken place in your portfolio.

A red box will appear next to all transactions in your portfolio that you can not modify. A green

box next to a transaction allows you to sell or modify it easily by linking directly to The Net

Investor's order entry screen. <A HREF="/How_phtml/actedit.shtml">Sample Report</A>

<p>



<b>Order/Execution History:</b>  This report allows you see all your orders as well as executions. <a href="/How_phtml/ordexec.shtml">Sample Report</A>

<p>



<b>Asset Allocation Pie Chart:</b>  This chart creates a current asset allocation update of your portfolio

holdings and generates an online graphic displaying asset allocation by issue group.

<h2>PAWWS Portfolio Reporting</h2>

Free to our clients, PAWWS portfolio reporting gives you a simplified version of what professional money managers use to oversee their portfolios. The PAWWS portfolio system gives you:<UL>
<LI> A current valuation of your portfolio using delayed or real-time quotes<I> (subject to real-time quote service subscription)</I>
<LI> Unrealized and realized gain and loss report, Schedule D reporting and tax lot accounting
<LI> History of your transactions and open orders
<LI> Capital adjustments on your holdings, such as splits, mergers and name changes
<LI> Earnings per share, beta ratings and current dividend yields
<LI> Reports from the Portfolio Accounting system can be automatically e-mailed to you at daily, weekly or monthly intervals
<LI> Upload your portfolio information into your favorite personal finance software, such as Quicken or Managing Your Money
<LI> Sub-accounting and account consolidation on all your brokerage accounts with The Net Investor.
<p></UL>
No more re-entering all your transactions, dialing in to update security prices, or trying to keep up with stock mergers and splits.  These features can save your tax preparer time, and save you money, reporting your mutual fund and other investment gains and losses.

<h3>How We Secure Your Account</h3>
<B>Accounts at The Net Investor are carefully protected in several
ways:</B><P>
<li><b>Backed by 80 years of integrity and stability,</b>  <a href="/How_phtml/howe.shtml">Howe Barnes
Investments, Inc.</a> has been doing business in Chicago as a member
of the New York stock exchange since 1915.  Its <a href="/How_phtml/manage.shtml">management</a> and
its desk of experienced traders are dedicated to ensuring that
your transactions are handled carefully and swiftly.
<p>
<li><b>A secure web server site</b> is provided using Netscapes'  server
software. When you use the <a href="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/netscape_products.html">Netscape browser</a>, available on the
Internet or from your local computer store, all of your
transmissions are encrypted (encoded) using  RSA's SSL protocol.
This encryption method is one of the industry standards for
Internet secured transactions. Server authentication is also
provided when you are using the Netscape browser.
<p>
<li><b>Off-line voice verification</b> is used when positive verification
is necessary. If circumstances warrant it, an Account Executive
may require you to use an off-line verification code.  This
password is never submitted over the Internet and may be used for
positive customer identification when conducting a phone, on-line
or e-mail order.
<p>
<li><b>Multiple level password security</b> allows you the option to
change your password as frequently as you like.  Your password into The PAWWS Financial Network can be easily changed through the Utilities function in
the main PAWWS menu.
<p>
<li><b>Your checking and VISA debit card</b> allow you to control the
disbursement of funds. TNI will wire or send checks to you only
after verifying your identity and then only to your name and
address on file, unless you instruct us otherwise in writing.  We often
use a signature guarantee when you submit important written
requests for changes in your account. A verification notice is
sent to you through the postal mail for certain requests.
<p>
<li><b>We have separate computer systems</b> apart from the web servers.
Your account transactions and information are maintained on a
separate database which is reconciled nightly to your PAWWS portfolio
account. 
<p>
<li><b>An extensive system of checks and balances,</b> which are followed by
our Account Executives, order desk and transaction processing
personnel, alert us to any unusual activity occurring in your
account.
<p>
<li><b>Securities in your account are protected up to $10 million.</b> 
Insurance from SIPC covers $500,000, of which $100,000 may be in
cash, with the remainder insured by certain underwriters of
Lloyds of London.

<CENTER><H3>True Price Advantage from The Net Investor</H3></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
<H3>Get More For Your Money</H3>

The Net Investor's True Price Advantage gives you increased access to the NASDAQ stock market, giving you the opportunity to <B>save hundreds of dollars on a trade!</B> Our advanced order
processing technology can mean a better price to you than the National Best Bid/Ask price.  Depending
on market conditions, we can take advantage of the
spread between the bid and ask price. This service is automatically
provided to all our clients on eligible orders.  There is no additional fee or application required.

<H3>How the True Price Advantage Works for You</H3>

<LI> As soon as we receive your eligible order, The Net Investor guarantees you the National Best Bid/Ask on the stock at that
time.  In a matter of seconds, our system automatically searches to find a better price.
<P>
<LI> Your order is checked against outstanding limit orders on the books of a private network of major securities dealers to see if there is a better price.  If there is,
you receive a full or partial execution at the improved price.
<P>
<LI> SelectNet, a national electronic limit order exposure system used by many market makers,  is then searched to find any
additional price improvement. 
<P>
<LI> If the National Best Bid/Ask price moves during this process, and a better price becomes available, this price is used on the
balance of your order that wasn't price improved through our dealer network or SelectNet.
<P>
<LI> For eligible market-type limit orders of 2,000 shares or more, your limit price will be reflected in a market-maker quote, thus exposing your limit order throughout the entire NASDAQ system.
<P>
<OL>In addition to these three steps, clients can also use Instinet to expose their order to large institutions and money managers. 
Instinet is a large New York-based proprietary trading network similar to an anonymous bulletin board for orders.  Instinet
is watched by most money managers and institutional traders who want to  trade without any spread.  The cost
to clients is $.03 per share in addition to the commission on the trade. 
</OL>
<P>
<H3>The Opportunity to Realize Significant Savings</H3>

Here is an example of The Net Investor's True Price Advantage:
<P>

You submit an order to sell 1,000 shares of ABCD at the market - 
<BR>
<OL>
<LI>    The National Best Bid is $8.00.  The National Best Ask is $8.25.
    
<LI>     A member of our dealer network or SelectNet shows a limit order to buy 1,000 shares of ABCD at $8.125.

<LI>      Your order is executed at the improved price of $8.125,  a savings of $125 over the national best bid.
</OL>
 
<H3>Eligible Orders Which Qualify for Our True Price Advantage Service</H3>
<OL>
<LI> The order must be a  market order or market-type limit order:
<BR>
 Market order:  An order to be executed immediately at the current market price<BR>
 Market-type limit order:  A limit order which is executable at the current market price when submitted. Typically
 used to cap the price in case the market moves during the execution process.  
 <P>

<LI> Over 2,700 NASDAQ stocks qualify.
<P>
<LI> Orders must be for a minimum of 100 shares.
<P>
<LI> The difference between the National Best Bid/Ask on the stock must be 1/8 or greater.
<P>
<LI> Orders for over 2,000 shares will receive the <B>personal attention</B> of one of our traders instead of being processed through the system, giving you an even greater opportunity for price improvement.  Market-type limit orders which exceed 2,000 shares will be given market exposure through a market-maker quote.

</OL>
<p>
<H3>Continually Striving to Serve You Better</H3>
<P>
We are continually reviewing which dealers or exchanges offer the best
opportunity for price improvement of any given stock. Howe Barnes' membership
on the New York and Chicago stock exchanges gives it direct
access to the information and facilities it needs to make these
choices.  For NASDAQ stocks, there are always at least three
competing market makers from which to choose.
Howe Barnes does not have an exclusive arrangement with any
"wholesale" order execution firm.  As a result, Howe Barnes has the capability to "shop around" for more competitive pricing.

<H3>Howe Barnes To Launch Unit Trust Focused On Midwest Banks</H3><P>
By Eric Weiner<BR>
<font size=2>Story reprinted from Dow Jones News - September 11, 1996, 13:49 </font>
<P>

	New York (Dow Jones)-- As investors keep a watchful eye on the consolidation trend for Midwestern banks, Howe Barnes Investments Inc. is launching a unit trust focused on bank stocks from that region.<P>

	The trust, to be called HBI Equity Trust, Series 2, will hold about 15 Midwest bank stocks, said Michael E. Sammon, a Howe Barnes senior vice president and manager of the Chicago broker-dealer's banking department.  Sammon is in charge of picking the stocks for the trust.<P>

	Sammon is shooting for an annualized return of 15% to 20%, giving the trust a yield of about 50% over its three-year life.<P>

	Investors can buy into the trust with a minimum purchase of 100 units, at about $15 each.  The company expects to begin the initial public offering this month, according to the prospectus.  Sammon said the trust should raise $5 million to $10 million.<P>

	Throughout the year, analysts have been paying attention to the Midwest as a possible spot for the re-ignition of bank merger activity that has been quiet for most of 1996.<P>

	Following the recently proposed merger of NationsBank Corp. (NB), of Charlotte, N.C., and Boatmen's Bancshares Inc. (BOAT), of St. Louis, several analysts speculated that there will be additional mergers in the area as larger banks try to shore up their Midwestern holdings.<P>

	Beyond the merger speculation, Sammon said the group of stocks from which he will pick have good defensive characteristics and strong fundamentals.  The possible consolidation activity gives the investment a decent underlying upside, he said.<P>

	The HBI Equity Trust is the second of its kind sponsored by Howe Barnes.  In March 1994, the firm launched a three year trust that bought Illinois bank stocks.  The trust, which expires March 17, 1997, will yield between 51% and 52% over its three-year life.<P>

	Besides the broader geographical base, the two trusts are different because this time Sammon will pick stocks based on their real value, rather than their potential as takeover targets.<P>

	"The takeover game goes in spurts," he said.  "We want to take the larger point of view this time when it comes to valuing the stocks.  With a three-year time horizon, I'm confident some things will happen."<P>

<P>

<B>20. CASH ACCOUNT INTEREST</B> 

<P>

a. HBI may pay interest on qualified credit balances (except for

residents of the State of Wisconsin). The rate of interest paid

may be established periodically in relation to prevailing short-term

money market rates and will approximate the rates paid by the

uninsured money market funds.

<P>

b. Interest income will be computed by multiplying qualified credit

balances for each day of the interest computation period by that

day's interest rate and dividing the result by 365 days. Daily

interest will then be totaled and credited to an Account on the

last business day of the month. (The interest computation period

for each month will begin where the preceding month's computation

period ended and will end seven days before the end of the month.)

<P>

c. A &quot;qualified credit balance&quot; is a credit balance

in a Cash Account, excluding the following: (a) balances less

than $1,000, (b) checks received for securities already purchased,

(c) checks which have not cleared the bank, (d) balances pending

settlement of a transaction, and (e) pending dividends. A check

will normally be considered to have cleared the bank at the close

of the 3rd business day after receipt.

<P>

d. Under the Securities Investors Protection Act (SIPA), the Securities

Investors Protection Corporation insures a Customer's funds and

assets up to $500,000 per account, of which $100,000 can be in

the form of cash balances. Cash balances generally are protected

if the funds were deposited for the purpose of purchasing securities.

Cash balances maintained solely for the purpose of earning interest

generally are not covered by the SIPA.

<P>

<B>21. ELECTRONIC RECORDING</B> 

<P>

Customer hereby consents to the taping, or any form of electronic

recording, of telephone and voice communications between the Customer

and representatives of HBI, which HBI may from time to time tape.

<P>
<B>22. ORDER ROUTING AND ORDER FLOW PAYMENT DISCLOSURE
</B>
Consistent with common securities industry practice, Howe Barnes Investments, Inc. receives payment for order flow in the form of either monetary compensation per share (in certain transactions in listed securities traded over the counter and or over the counter securities) or reciprocal business from other dealers or market centers.  Absent specific instructions from you, orders are routed to such dealers or market centers that execute orders at prices at the national best bid and offer (NBBO).  These dealers and market centers also provide an opportunity for execution at prices superior to the NBBO.  Our foremost objective is to obtain the best executions for our clients, regardless of any compensation factor.

<H2>III. MARGIN AND SHORT ACCOUNTS</H2>



<P>

Customers contemplating margin trading should be certain they

understand the operation of a margin account under various market

conditions. Margin trading is not for every Customer, and the

increased leverage of margin privileges may heighten both risks

and rewards. Clients wishing to apply for margin privileges should

read this Section III carefully and discuss any questions with

HBI. Customers should examine their investment objectives, financial

resources and risk tolerance to determine whether margin trading

is appropriate. Margin privileges involve the extension of credit

by HBI to the Customer, secured by the collateral in the Account

and the amount borrowed will appear as a debit balance on which

Customer will be charged interest at varying rates as described

in this Section III.

<P>

All the above provisions of Section II, with respect to cash accounts,

are incorporated herein including, but not limited to, paragraphs

6, 7 and 8 regarding Liens, Pledge of Securities and Other Property,

and Interest, respectively.

<P>

<B>1. MARGIN</B> 

<P>

The Customer shall maintain in all accounts with HBI such positions

and margins as required by all applicable statutes, rules, regulations,

procedures and custom, or as HBI deems necessary or advisable.

The Customer shall promptly satisfy all margin and maintenance

calls.

<P>

<B>2. DISCLOSURES REGARDING LIQUIDATIONS AND COVERING POSITIONS</B>



<P>

The Customer acknowledges that HBI is not obligated to request

additional margin from the Customer in the event the Customer's

account falls below minimum maintenance requirements. More importantly,

there may or will be circumstances where HBI will liquidate securities

and/or other property in the account with or without the Customer's

consent to ensure that minimum maintenance requirements are satisfied.

<P>

<B>3. LIQUIDATIONS AND COVERING POSITIONS</B> 

<P>

HBI shall have the right in accordance with its general policies

regarding margin maintenance requirements to require additional

collateral or the liquidation of any securities and other property

whenever in HBI's discretion it considers it necessary for its

protection including in the event of, but not limited to: the

failure of the Customer to promptly meet any call for additional

collateral; the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or against

the Customer; the appointment of a receiver is filed by or against

the Customer; or attachment is levied against any account of the

Customer or in which the Customer has an interest or; the Customer's

death. In such event, HBI is authorized to sell any and all securities

and other property in any account of the Customer whether carried

individually or jointly with others, to buy all securities or

other property which may be short in such accounts(s), to cancel

any open orders and to close any oral outstanding contracts, all

without demand for margin or additional margin, other notice of

sale or purchase, or other notice or advertisement each of which

is expressly waived by the Customer. Any such sales or purchases

may be made at HBI's discretion on any exchange or other market

where such business is usually transacted or at public auction

or private sale, and HBI may be the purchaser for HBI's own account.

Customer acknowledges that a prior demand, or call, or prior notice

of the time and place of such sale or purchase shall not be considered

a waiver of HBI's right to sell or buy without demand or notice

as herein provided.

<P>

4. <B>STATEMENT OF INTEREST CHARGES</B> 

<P>

(a) Rate of Interest: Interest will be charged to the Account

for credit extended for the purpose of buying or trading or carrying

any securities or for other purposes. The annual rate of interest

charged to the Account will vary depending upon the size of the

debit balance and will be determined in accordance with the following

schedule:

<PRE>

Average Daily			Percentage Added		

Debit Balance			to HBI Base Rate		

$0 - $14,999			2 1/2 %		

$15,000- $49,999		2 %		

$50,000 - $99,999		1 %		

$100,000 &amp; Over			3/4 %  

</PRE>



<P>

The Base Rate charged is based upon current call money rates on

brokers' loans quoted by a majority of the financial institutions

which extend such loans to HBI.

<P>

HBI sets the Base Rate in light of market conditions. The Base

Rate reflects the broker call rate, the prime rate, the Federal

funds rate, and other commercially recognized interest rates.

The interest rate a Customer is charged will increase or decrease

without notice as the Base Rate increases or decreases.

<P>

(b) Adjustment of Rate Without Prior Notice: The annual rate of

interest will change up or down without prior notice in accordance

with shifts in call money rates. If the interest rate is to be

increased for any other reason, Customer will be provided with

at least 30 days written notice prior to such change.

<P>

(c) Debit Balance: The amount of money loaned to Customer (i.e.,

credit extended to or maintained) is represented by Customer's

&quot;debit balance&quot;. A purchase of securities on margin

creates or adds to Customer's debit balance, as do interest charges,

withdrawals of funds, dividend charges, marking-to-market on short

positions, and other charges. Customer's debit balance is reduced

by sales of securities, funds deposited, dividends credited, and

marking-to-market on short positions.

<P>

(d) Determining Average Daily Debit Balance: The &quot;average

daily debit balance&quot; is the sum of the daily debit balances

divided by the number of days on which a debit balance existed.

Days on which the balance is zero, or a credit, will be disregarded

entirely for purposes of the interest computation.

<P>

(e) Method of Computing Interest: Interest is computed on the

basis of a 360-day year in accordance with the formulae below:

<P>

Average Daily Rate of Number of Days on Which Interest Charge

= Debit Balance x Interest x There was a Debit Balance 360 Days.

<P>

Where there has been no change in the interest rate during a calendar

month, the interest charge is computed as of the last day of the

month under the above formula and the charge is added to the closing

debit balance for that month on the first day of the following

month. If there are changes in interest rates during a calendar

month, separate computations, using the above formula, will be

made to cover each period during which a separate interest rate

was in effect. If, during any calendar month, there is a change

in the interest rates in your account, Customer's interest statement

will show the separate interest charges for the respective periods.

<H2>IV. JOINT ACCOUNTS</H2>



<P>

<B>1. HOLDERS</B> 

<P>

If the Account is in the name of more than one Account holder,

all Account holders jointly and severally agree that each of them

shall have authority on behalf of the joint account to buy, sell

(including short sales) and otherwise deal in, through HBI securities

and other property, on margin or otherwise; to receive on behalf

of the Account demands notices, confirmations, reports, statements

of account and communications of every kind; to receive on behalf

of the Account money, securities and property of every kind and

to dispose of same; to make on behalf of the Account agreements

relating to any of the foregoing matters and to terminate or modify

same or waive any of the provisions thereof; and generally to

deal with HBI on behalf of the Account as fully and completely

as if the individual Account holder alone were interested in said

Account, all without notice to the other or others interested

in said Account. HBI is authorized to follow the instructions

of any Account holder in every respect concerning the said Account

and to make deliveries to any Account holder, of any or all securities

in the Account, and to make payments to any Account holder, of

any or all monies at any time or from time to time in the Account

as Account holder may order or direct, even if such deliveries

and/or payments shall be made to an Account holder personally,

and not for the joint account of the undersigned. In the event

of any such deliveries of securities or payments of monies to

any Account holder as aforesaid, HBI shall be under no duty or

obligation to inquire into the purpose or propriety of any such

demand for delivery of securities or payment of monies, and each

Account holder shall not be bound to see to the application or

disposition of the said securities and/or monies so delivered

or paid to any of each Account holder. The authority hereby conferred

shall remain in force until written notice of the revocation addressed

to each Account holder is delivered at HBI's main office.

<P>

<B>2. LIABILITY</B> 

<P>

The liability of each Account holder with respect to said Account

shall be joint and several. Each Account holder further agrees

jointly and severally that all property HBI may at any time be

holding or carrying for any one or more of the account holders

shall be subject to a lien in HBI's favor for the discharge of

the obligations of the joint account to HBI, such lien to be in

addition to and not in substitution of the rights and remedies

each Account holder otherwise would have. It is further agreed

that in the event of the death of any Account holder, the survivor

or survivors shall immediately give the other Account holder(s)

written notice thereof, and HBI may, before or after receiving

such notice, take such proceeding, require such papers and inheritance

or estate tax waivers, retain such portion of and/or restrict

transactions in the Account as may be deemed advisable to protect

HBI against any tax, liability, penalty or loss. The estate of

any Account holder shall be liable and each survivor shall continue

to be liable jointly and severally to HBI for any net debit balance

or loss in said Account in any way resulting from the completion

of transactions initiated prior to the receipt by HBI of written

notice of the death of the decedent Account holder or incurred

in the liquidation of the Account, or the adjustment of any interests

of the Account holder, with respect to the Account.
