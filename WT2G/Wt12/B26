<P>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a nationwide, nonprofit,
nonpartisan organization with nearly 300,000 members dedicated to the principles
of liberty and equality embodied in the Bill of Rights.  Since its founding in
1920, the ACLU has sought to ensure that people whose constitutional or
statutory rights have been denied have an effective means of redress.  The ACLU
has participated directly or as amicus curiae in many of this Court's cases
concerning immunity of public officials, including the President.  See, e.g.,
Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731 (1982).</P>
<P>The ACLU takes no position on the truth or falsity of the allegations of the
Complaint.  Amicus does assert that a President, sued for civil damages for
actions taken outside the scope of his official responsibilities, is not
entitled to an automatic (or nearly automatic) stay of the entire case until he
leaves the presidency.<SUP>2</SUP></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="statement"></A><B>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</B></P>
<P>Respondent alleges that while President Clinton was Governor of Arkansas he
made unwanted sexual advances toward her and that, when she rejected these
advances, she suffered in her employment with the Arkansas state government. 
Respondent also asserts that her initial intention was not to sue.  However,
when an article appeared in the press, which she believed implied that she had
had a consensual sexual relationship with the President while he was Governor,
she &quot;saw herself as held up falsely to public scorn,&quot; Prime Time Live
(ABC television broadcast, June 16, 1994) (transcript attached to Memorandum in
Support of President Clinton's Motion to Dismiss on Grounds of Presidential
Immunity), and, given the discrepancy between this account of the incident and
the account she had given to her friends, believed her friends might believe she
had been untruthful.  In addition, she alleges that the President denied her
account of the incident, further casting doubt on her truthfulness.</P>
<P>The President asserts numerous defenses to these allegations, not the least
of which is to deny respondent's account of the facts.  However, prior to
raising those defenses (and with the court's permission), the President filed a
motion to &quot;dismiss on the basis of Presidential immunity.&quot;  Jones v.
Clinton, 869 F.Supp. 690, 692 (E.D.Ark. 1994).</P>
<P>The district court denied the motion.  Id. at 698.  After reviewing the
historical record and relevant case law, the court found that the Constitution
itself was &quot;silent on all of this&quot; and that there was no dispositive
case law.  The court then summarized its holding with the following observation:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[T]his Court does not believe that a President has absolute immunity from
civil causes of action arising prior to assuming the office.  Nowhere in the
Constitution, congressional acts, or the writing of any judge or scholar, may
any credible support for such a proposition be found.  It is contrary to our
form of government, which asserts as did the English in the Magna Carta and the
Petition of Right, that even the sovereign is subject to God and the law.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id.</P>
<P>After rejecting the broad assertion of immunity, the court next considered a
&quot;limited or temporary immunity from trial.&quot;  Id.  The court first
acknowledged &quot;the necessity to avoid litigation, which might also blossom
through other unrelated civil actions and which could conceivably hamper the
President in conducting the duties of this office . . . [and] could have harmful
effects in connection not only with the President but also with the nation in
general.&quot;  Id.  The court then discussed the specific facts of this case,
finding that respondent's claims did not seem to be &quot;of an urgent nature.&quot;
 Id. at 699.  Relying on the &quot;equity powers of the Court&quot; and
Fed.R.Civ.P. 40, the court ruled that it would &quot;put the case on hold, as
far as trial is concerned.&quot;  869 F. Supp. at 699.  Finally, the court held
that there was &quot;no reason why the discovery and deposition process could
not proceed as to all persons including the President himself.&quot;  Id.</P>
<P>The President appealed and the court of appeals generally affirmed, one
judge dissenting.  Jones v. Clinton, 72 F.3d 1354 (8th Cir. 1996).  Judge
Bowman, on behalf of the majority, held that the burden was on the President to
establish the necessity for delay, either in the form of a rule of law, or in
the specific circumstances of the individual case.  Finding no dispositive
decision of this Court, the court of appeals proceeded to balance the interests
involved.  It did so &quot;`guided by the Constitution, federal statutes, and
history' and . . . informed by public policy.&quot;  Id. at 1358, citing Nixon
v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 747 (1982).  More specifically, the decision below
closely followed the analytic structure used by this Court in Fitzgerald,
another case involving presidential immunity.  Based on this informed balancing
of interests, the court then concluded that &quot;the Constitution does not
confer upon an incumbent President any immunity from civil actions that arise
from his unofficial acts.&quot;  72 F.3d at 1363.</P>
<P>This Court granted the President's petition for a writ of certiorari and the
President, joined by the United States and an amicus group of distinguished law
professors argues that the district court and the court of appeals were in
error.  Each proposes a rule of law that would make it completely or virtually
impossible for any person to pursue a civil suit for damages for actions taken
by a President outside the scope of his official duties while the President
holds office.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="summary"></A><B>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</B></P>
<P>Under Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 756, a President's entitlement to
absolute immunity does not apply to actions taken beyond &quot;`the outer
perimeter' of his official responsibility.&quot;  The question presented here is
whether a claim for damages that would otherwise be permissible under Fitzgerald
should automatically, and in every case, be &quot;deferred&quot; until the
expiration of the President's term in office.<SUP>3</SUP></P>
<P>We respectfully suggest that the answer to that question is no for two
fundamental reasons.  First, the notion of deferring any litigation activity
involving the President for up to eight years in all damage cases is
inconsistent with our nation's deeply held view that no person is above the law.</P>
<P>Second, the argument in favor of an automatic stay in all cases, regardless
of circumstances, undervalues the very real prejudice that such a delay may
create to aggrieved litigants.  Among other things, memories fade and evidence
becomes stale.  The odds of prevailing on even nonfrivolous claims thus
inevitably decline.</P>
<P>In some cases, that price may be inescapable.  In others, it surely is not. 
Trial judges can and should be trusted to balance these competing interests with
due deference to the special burdens faced by the President in fulfilling his
duties.  In particular, a trial court may fully utilize its authority over the
pace and procedures of litigation to minimize the demands on the President.  An
automatic deferral of all litigation would, on the other hand, strip trial
judges of their traditional case management responsibilities and effectively
expand a President's absolute immunity from damages well beyond the carefully
defined limits set forth in Fitzgerald.</P>
<P>The law disfavors immunities.  Accordingly, the burden is upon the party
seeking an immunity to establish its need.  Neither the President nor his amici
acknowledge this well-established rule,<SUP>4</SUP> nor do they seek to satisfy
it except in the most general way -- by emphasizing the importance of allowing
the President to conduct the nation's business without undue distraction.  We
agree with the importance of that interest, as did both courts below.  The
duties of the President of the United States, particularly with respect to
foreign policy, are uniquely demanding.  Presidents are called upon, often at
all hours, to respond to national crises.  But, as both courts below also held,
it simply does not follow that no litigation can ever take place against a

sitting President.</P>
<P>One of the major fears seems to be a threatened avalanche of frivolous
lawsuits motivated by partisan political considerations.  In our view, that fear
is overstated.  Nothing in the historical record supports it.  Trial judges
already have an arsenal of weapons at their disposal to deal with frivolous
lawsuits if they occur.  Finally, if not deterred by the prospect of sanctions,
such lawsuits will be routinely dismissed with little or no demands on the
President's time.</P>
<P>The difficult issue arises in nonfrivolous cases where the stakes are
undeniably higher, both for the President and the opposing litigant.  Even in
this context, however, the demands on a President's time necessarily vary at
different stages of the litigation, and from case to case.  The absolute rule
proposed by the President in this case does not take account of these
differences.  Instead, it effectively obliterates the line between official and
unofficial conduct that this Court carefully established in Fitzgerald as the
basis for a President's absolute immunity.</P>
<P>The President is not like any other litigant.  But, like any other litigant,
the President should still be required to justify a requested delay in the
proceedings by showing that, given the particular phase of the case (e.g.,
motion to dismiss, deposition, interrogatory), the suit will significantly
interfere with his ability to carry out the specific duties of his office then
commanding his attention, and that his ability to carry out those duties cannot
be preserved by a less drastic alternative than a potential eight-year stay. 
The decision below is consistent with that approach and should be affirmed.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="argument"></A><B>ARGUMENT</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>I. THE DISTRICT COURT AND THE COURT OF APPEALS WERE
CORRECT THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS THE BURDEN OF ESTABLISHING THAT, AFTER THE
RESPECTIVE INTERESTS ARE BALANCED, IMMUNITY IS WARRANTED</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The lower courts found that neither the Constitution nor any decision of
this Court provides an authoritative answer to the question presented by this
case.  Those courts also found that, in determining the scope of any claim for
immunity, the court must balance the respective interests with the burden of
establishing the need for immunity on the party seeking immunity.  Jones, 869
F.Supp. at 697-98.  Those conclusions are correct and should be affirmed.</P>
<P>In United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), this Court unanimously held
that the President could be compelled to provide evidence in a pending federal
criminal case under appropriate circumstances.  The Court first held that it was
the province of the courts to determine the scope of any privilege, including
one asserted by the President.  Id. at 703-05.  In determining the scope of any
privilege, the court must balance the competing interests.  Id. at 711-12. 
Furthermore, a generalized interest asserted by the President (in that case,
confidentiality) cannot outweigh the specific interest in providing relevant
evidence in a criminal case.  Id. at 712-13.  The Court also acknowledged the
special care that must be taken in light of the unique position of the
presidency and was careful to limit its holding to criminal cases.  Id. at
712-16.<SUP>5</SUP></P>
<P>In Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478 (1978), the Court rejected the argument
that federal officials were absolutely immune from damages for actions taken
within the scope of their official duties.  The Court held that any person
seeking an immunity has the burden of establishing &quot;that public policy
requires an exemption of that scope.&quot;  Id. at 506.  The Court acknowledged
that some officials could meet that burden and would be allowed absolute
immunity.  438 U.S. at 503-17.</P>
<P>In Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, the Court held that the President was
one of the officials entitled to absolute immunity in some instances. 
Specifically, the Court held that the President was absolutely immune from
damages for actions taken &quot;within the 'outer perimeter' of his official
responsibility.&quot;  Id. at 756.</P>
<P>Noting that &quot;[t]he President occupies a unique position in the
constitutional scheme,&quot; id. at 749, the Court in Fitzgerald concluded that
absolute immunity was warranted for actions taken within the scope of the
President's official responsibilities for two reasons.<SUP>6</SUP>  First, &quot;damages
liability may render an official unduly cautious in the discharge of his
official duties.&quot;  Id. at 752 &amp; n.32.  Second, a suit could &quot;distract

a President from his public duties to the detriment not only of the President
and his office but also the Nation that the Presidency was designed to serve.&quot;
 Id. at 753.</P>
<P>As the President acknowledges, the first rationale does not apply here
because the complaint is based on actions that allegedly took place before he
assumed office.  The concern about distraction is a real one.  However,
Fitzgerald certainly does not hold that an automatic stay is appropriate in all
cases during a President's incumbency.  In many cases, perhaps most, the issue
will not even arise because absolute immunity will attach.  Moreover, United
States v. Nixon suggests that all of the concerns about distraction are
insufficient if balanced against sufficiently weighty concerns.  See also
Section II.A.1.</P>
<P>In short, none of these authorities provides a definitive answer to the
question raised by this case.  In fact, only three clear rules emerge.  First,
in measuring the need for, and scope of, a claim of immunity, the burden of
proof is on the party seeking immunity.  Butz, 438 U.S. at 506.<SUP>7</SUP> 
Second, as all parties recognize, in determining whether to acknowledge a claim
of immunity, the Court must balance the interests of the respective parties and
the public interest.  Third, the problems created by judicial acts that affect
the President's schedule are insufficient, if balanced against other,
sufficiently weighty concerns, to cause the courts to grant an absolute immunity
from participation in court proceedings.  Thus, the structure of analysis
utilized by the lower courts was correct.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>II.  THE DISTRICT COURT AND THE COURT OF APPEALS WERE
CORRECT THAT THE INTERESTS OF THE PRESIDENT, ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIAL, WHEN BALANCED
WITH THE INTERESTS OF RESPONDENT, DO NOT JUSTIFY AN AUTOMATIC DISMISSAL OR STAY
OF THE ENTIRE CASE</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>A. The Interests Of The President</B></P>
<P>The President and his amici suggest two major policy interests to support a
broad immunity in this case:  to prevent the President from being distracted
from the duties of his office and to preserve the separation between the
executive and judicial branches.  As noted, this Court has already held that
neither of these considerations, either separately or in conjunction, prevents
the courts from requiring the occupant of the presidency from providing evidence
in court under appropriate circumstances.  Balancing the relevant factors in
this case, neither factor, either alone or in conjunction with the other, should
require the courts to establish a rule granting an automatic delay of a civil
suit for damages for actions taken outside the scope of presidential
responsibilities.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>1.  Distraction</B></P>
<P>There can be no question that the President, as any defendant, may be called
upon to expend time in his defense.  It also cannot be seriously denied that
there may be occasions when the time required will be substantial and when the
time being spent will divert him from his attention to his duties as President. 
Finally, this diversion may occur at the discovery phase as well as at trial.</P>
<P>There is a strong national interest in ensuring that the President not be
unduly distracted from his responsibilities as President.  The President and his
amici are correct when they suggest that the presidency is a unique office with
uniquely broad responsibility.  Particularly in the area of foreign policy, the
President often speaks for the nation in a way that no other public official
can.  Moreover, foreign policy problems, in particular, are apt to occur at all
hours and Presidents are awakened in the middle of the night to attend to vital
matters affecting the entire nation and even the world.  Foreign policy crises
can be of singular importance, involving matters of war and peace, life and
death.  Thus, the first concern raised by the President -- distracting him from
his duties -- is an important one.</P>
<P>However, this concern can be overstated.  First, the President emphasizes
that the executive branch, unlike the legislative or judicial, is headed by a
single official.  This means, he argues, that he alone must be available to make
decisions 24 hours a day.  Of course, many &quot;presidential&quot; decisions
are made by lower level officials and never even presented to the President. 
Moreover, the same singularity applies to state governors who, within their
sphere of responsibilities, are the lone, final decisionmakers.</P>

<P>The President must be available 24 hours a day, but that does not mean that

Presidents actually work 24 hours a day.  Of course they do not.  All Presidents
do, in fact, sleep, vacation, and engage in nonpresidential social and political
activity.<SUP>8</SUP>  Depending on their personal management styles,
Presidents have worked more or less demanding schedules.  Thus, President Carter
was famous for working long hours, President Reagan for working at a more
relaxed pace.<SUP>9</SUP></P>
<P>Moreover, like the concern for confidentiality in United States v. Nixon,
the concern for the President's time is generalized, not specific.  Although
there will be occasions during litigation when the President is called upon to
expend significant time on his defense, there will also be occasions and even
entire cases when he is not required to spend any substantial time on defense.</P>
<P>Many suits against an incumbent President are likely to be frivolous.<SUP>10</SUP>
 Courts have ample tools at their disposal for quickly dispensing with frivolous
litigation, and it is fair to presume that those tools will be quickly employed
when the President is a defendant.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12, 12(f), 56. 
Furthermore, courts have broad authority to impose sanctions on parties and
lawyers who file lawsuits &quot;for any improper purpose, such as to harass&quot;;
lawsuits that lack evidentiary support&quot;; and lawsuits that are lacking in
legal basis.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 11.  Courts also have the power to award attorneys'
fees, cite parties for contempt, and impose sanctions under their inherent
powers.  Id. (committee comments); Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 (1991).</P>
<P>The President suggests that these devices will be ineffective in preventing
frivolous litigation against a President because those bringing the suit are
often more interested in the publicity than in the result of the action. 
However, the attention paid to those bringing allegations against a President
comes not from the court proceedings, but from the factual allegations
themselves and the media attention surrounding them.<SUP>11</SUP>  Even if the
President is given the kind of immunity he seeks -- a stay of proceedings until
the end of his presidency -- a complainant is free to do what has already been
done in this case:  make public charges and file a complaint.  The complainant
is free to outline the evidence he will put forth at trial.  And he will have
the added advantage that he can rightly say that the President has chosen to
hide behind presidential immunity rather than honestly confront the charges.<SUP>12</SUP>
 The only practical method for dealing with frivolous allegations is swift
action under the Federal Rules to dismiss such cases.</P>
<P>It is in nonfrivolous cases that the plaintiff's interest in redress and the
drain on the President's time are both likely to be maximized.  The President's
solution to that dilemma is to favor a rule in every case granting the President
an automatic stay during the duration of his presidency.  That solution entirely
discounts the plaintiff's interest, however; and although it might be the right
answer in some cases, it should not be the automatic answer in all cases.</P>
<P>The concern about the President's time applies equally in the case of
injunctive relief sought against the President, whether that injunctive relief
is based on actions taken outside or within the scope of his official
responsibilities.  Even with regard to actions taken within the President's
responsibilities, where damages may not be obtained, this Court has implicitly
held that injunctive actions may go forward.  In the immunity cases, the Court
repeatedly cites Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952),
for the proposition that &quot;[i]t is settled law that the separation-of-powers
doctrine does not bar every exercise of jurisdiction over the President . . . .&quot;
 Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 753-54; United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at
707.  But see Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 827 (1992)(Scalia, J.,
concurring).</P>
<P>The continued viability of Youngstown cannot be explained by the notion that
a civil case seeking injunctive relief will invariably require less of the
President's time than a civil case seeking damages.  There will be cases in
which that is so and cases in which it is not.  Thus, the danger of diversion of
the President's attention from matters of state is insufficient, standing alone,
to justify an automatic stay or dismissal of litigation.</P>
<P>Similarly, United States v. Nixon stands for the proposition that despite
the distraction that will inevitably flow, the President can be compelled to
provide evidence, including testimony, in a criminal case.  In this case, the
President and his amici argue that the case against defendant Ferguson should
also be dismissed or stayed because the demands on the President's time as a
potential witness would be so great.  In other words, they argue that in a civil
case, the rule of law should be the opposite from that in Nixon.  Were this
distinction to have value, it could not be as a result of any suggestion that
being a witness in a civil case will inevitably involve more of a demand on the
President's time than being a witness in a criminal case.</P>
<P>Thus, both Youngstown and Nixon must stand for the proposition that
distraction to the President, while relevant, is insufficient, standing alone,
to justify any immunity or stay.  Where the distraction to the President is the
principal factor supporting immunity, the critical issues are how great the
distraction is likely to be, whether that distraction can be mitigated through
less drastic alternatives than a stay, and what impact a stay will have on
plaintiff's competing interests.  By definition, those judgments can only be
made on a case-by-case basis.  Indeed, those judgments should be made at each
phase of each case.  See Section III.</P>
<P>Finally, the President suggests that if this Court were to affirm, it would
signal a change in law and would invite a torrent of litigation, some abusive,
against sitting Presidents.  All parties agree that there have so far been few
such suits filed.  Significantly, however, the fact that there have been some
suits in the past suggests that, contrary to the President's assertion, the
common understanding of history has been that such suits were possible. 
Moreover, the small number of prior cases suggests that the President's fears of
an explosion of nonfrivolous litigation are misplaced.  Jones v. Clinton, 72
F.3d at 1362.<SUP>13</SUP></P>
<P>There is an additional reason suggested by the court of appeals for
rejecting the President's speculative fear of an avalanche of litigation.  A
President only interacts with a limited number of people in his unofficial
capacity.  &quot;Thus, the universe of potential plaintiffs who might seek to
hold the President accountable for his alleged private wrongs via a civil
lawsuit is considerably smaller than the universe of potential plaintiffs who
might seek to hold the President accountable for his official conduct.&quot; 
Id.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>2.  Separation of Powers</B></P>
<P>The President and his amici also argue that presidential immunity is
necessary to preserve the separation of powers.  In particular, the President
argues that if a President moved for a continuance on the ground that he had to
attend to an urgent matter of national interest, and the Court denied the
motion, &quot;the Court would be not merely reviewing the President's
priorities, but conceivably could order the President to rearrange them.&quot; 
Pet.Br. at 30.</P>
<P>We agree that the President should not be treated as an ordinary litigant. 
Substantial deference should be given to his assertion, in a particular context,
that his official duties require additional time or rescheduling of a particular
matter. The history discussed by the President, however, convincingly
demonstrates that the courts have already been, and presumably will continue to
be, sensitive to the President's unique status as a litigant.  Id. at 18, n.17,
at 28, n.25.  See also United States Br. at 25, n.15.</P>
<P>Despite this history, the President suggests that it is improper or at least
unseemly for the courts to be involved in executive matters.  Thus, both he and
his amici challenge the suggestion of the court of appeals that the trial courts
would utilize sound principles of case management to prevent abuse of the
President's time.  More fundamentally, the President argues, any judicial
inquiry into the value of the President's time only highlights the separation of
powers issue.</P>
<P>It is well-settled, however, that the judiciary has not only the power but
the duty to review the actions of the other coordinate branches.  This principle
was established by the Court almost two centuries ago in Marbury v. Madison, 5
U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803).  More recently, in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S.
at 707, this Court applied this principle to President Nixon's attempt to use a
claim of executive privilege to insulate his presidential papers and tapes from
a subpoena.  In rejecting President Nixon's claim, this Court relied on the
Constitution's grant of power to the judiciary, as well as its own holding in
Marbury, in concluding that such an expansive view of separation of powers
principles would &quot;gravely impair the role of the courts under Article III.&quot;
 418 U.S. at 707.</P>
<P>In this case, the concern about interference with the other branches is less
than in Nixon and Marbury.  In those cases, this Court upheld its own authority
to review actions of the executive and legislative branches taken in their
official capacity.  In this case, by contrast, the actions at issue arose before
Mr. Clinton became President, and the dispute concerns scheduling of the
President's time, not review of his official actions.  The interference with
executive functions and the separation of powers concerns are accordingly less.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>B. The Interests Of Plaintiffs</B></P>
<P>Although the President and his amici do not appear to directly address the
question, see, e.g., United States Br. at 21-22, it is clear that, in an
appropriate case, immunity would not shield the President from being subjected
to injunctive relief, even for acts committed at the center of his
responsibilities as President.  See Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer,
343 U.S. 579.  It seems even more clear that the President could be subjected to
injunctive relief for acts committed either before his presidency or committed
during his presidency but irrelevant to his responsibilities.  Thus, for
example, a President would not be permitted to rely on any immunity doctrine,
were his or her spouse to seek dissolution of the marriage; and  a court would
have the authority to resolve issues of child custody and support,
notwithstanding that they affected the occupant of the presidency.  See, e.g.,
Pet.Br. at 42.</P>
<P>Assuming, therefore, that immunity does not automatically prevent a court
from issuing injunctions against the President, whether the underlying issues
arise out of his duties or not, the President's argument in this case appears to
be that any plaintiff's interest in a damages remedy is always significantly
less than any plaintiff's interest in injunctive relief.  See id.  Although this
proposition may often be true, it cannot be said that it is always true. 
Adoption of the President's absolute view of immunity would thus result in some
less important cases, pled to seek injunctive relief, going forward, while other
more important cases, pled to seek damages, are long delayed.  It is difficult
to imagine the justification for such a rule.</P>
<P>In addition, cases seeking damages are often not purely, and sometimes not
even primarily, about money.  The ACLU takes no position on the motives of
respondent in this case.  However, she asserts that her interest in this case is
not in obtaining damages, but in restoring the damage that has been done to her
reputation.  Delay in obtaining damages can be overcome by the devices suggested
by the President, including an award for past action in present dollars or an
award of interest; although to plaintiffs of limited means, that delay may cause
irreparable harm.  Damage to one's reputation cannot be overcome.  If respondent
is correct, both in her version of the events and in her assertion of damage to
her reputation, that damage will continue for the years of the Clinton
Presidency.  In this respect, the harm respondent asserts is continuing harm, as
is the harm asserted when a plaintiff seeks injunctive relief.  Her interest in
repairing the damage she believes has been done to her reputation is no less
important than the interest of many plaintiffs seeking forms of injunctive
relief.  It thus merits no greater immunity.</P>
<P>Moreover, as Judge Beam suggested in his concurrence below, delay in
obtaining relief is not the only important effect of delay.  &quot;Ms. Jones
faces real dangers of loss of evidence through the unforeseeable calamities
inevitable with the passage of time.&quot;  72 F.3d at 1363.  The suggestion by
the United States that testimony can be preserved, United States Br. at 21, of
course applies to only the foreseen calamities, probably a less common category.
 At least one of respondent's claims might be extinguished if she were to
unexpectedly die.  72 F.3d at 1364.</P>
<P>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the ACLU acknowledges that the nation
has an interest in ensuring that the President attend to his awesome
responsibilities.  However, the nation also has an interest in equal justice
under law.  Up to this time, no court has ever held that any person is immune
from suit for damages for actions taken outside official, governmental
responsibilities, even temporally.  Imbler v. Pachman, 424 U.S. 409 (1976),
Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349 (1978)(prosecutors and judges subject to suit
for acts outside their official responsibilities).  The nation has an interest
in ensuring that our system of justice, rightly a matter of national pride, is
available to all of its people, regardless of whether the party is high-born or
low, holds high office or does not.  That interest -- that compelling interest
-- is far more important than the facts of this case.  That interest, combined
with the other interests of plaintiffs seeking redress for harms, compels
rejection of a rule that automatically immunizes the President from civil suits
during the duration of his incumbency.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>III.  THE GRANTING OF IMMUNITY SHOULD BE DECIDED AT EACH
PHASE OF A CASE AND NOT FOR THE CASE AS AN ENTIRETY</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The district court concluded that it would delay the trial of this case but
would not delay the discovery.  The district court was correct in concluding
that the question of a stay or delay of this case should be decided at each
phase and not for the case as a whole.  At the same time, the court of appeals
also correctly held that no particular phase of a case should be given an
automatic stay and that it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to
prejudge the question of delay of trial before that issue is ripe.</P>
<P>The specific facts of this case illustrate the need to look at the
circumstances of each case rather than applying an automatic rule.  The
President asserted in his motion in the district court that, if his immunity
claim were denied, he would be likely to move to dismiss on the grounds of
statute of limitations, laches, and failure to state a claim.  Each of these
bases for a motion to dismiss must be established on the face of the complaint,
and each presents a pure issue of law.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 12.  It will require little
or none of the President's time for his counsel to file and argue those motions.
 If any of those motions are meritorious, the case will be dismissed and will
have required little or no expenditure of time by the President.  Accordingly, a
generalized concern over the President's time provides no basis for dismissing
or adjourning this case prior to resolution of motions to dismiss.</P>
<P>The President and his amici suggest the need for a broader stay by arguing,
correctly, that discovery can be as time consuming, and therefore as
distracting, as trial.  Of course, as suggested above, cases have more phases
than discovery and trial, but even looking solely at the discovery phase, it is
certainly true that some forms of discovery, such as the President's deposition,
would inevitably require a considerable expenditure of his time.  However, other
forms of discovery, such as production of documents, are likely to require
substantially less attention by the President.  The district court has
considerable authority to order that discovery proceed in the manner least
disruptive of the President's time.  For example, as trial courts have in the
past, the district court in this case could require that any questioning of the
President be done by written interrogatories.  Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(c), 31.  The
lower courts' decisions in this case permit the President to seek such relief at
an appropriate stage.  Jones v. Clinton, 72 F.3d at 1362-63.</P>
<P>Both lower courts agreed that no automatic stay should be granted at any
phase of this case.  However, the court of appeals reversed the decision of the
district court to delay trial, finding that the trial court had, in effect,
granted an automatic stay of that phase of the case and had therefore abused its
discretion.  Id. at 1361.  That decision was correct.  The decision concerning
trial is premature.  If the President's alternative bases for moving to dismiss
are meritorious, trial will never occur.  If this case does reach a trial stage,
a decision concerning timing can be made at that time.</P>
<P>In short, the President's request for an absolute rule of temporal immunity
ultimately rests on three flawed propositions:  that suits seeking injunctive
relief will always require less expenditure of time than suits seeking damages,
that plaintiffs seeking damages always have a less compelling need for immediate
relief than plaintiffs seeking injunctive relief, and that all phases of all
cases are equally distracting for a President.  The lower courts properly
rejected these propositions and properly held that questions of temporal
immunity from civil damages should be decided at each phase of each case.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="conclusion"></A><B>CONCLUSION</B></P>
<P>For the reasons stated above, the judgment below denying the President's
request for an automatic stay of all phases of this case for the duration of his
presidency should be affirmed.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="notes"></A><B>NOTES</B></P>
<P>1. Letters of consent to the filing of this brief have been lodged with the
Clerk of the Court pursuant to Rule 37.3.</P>
<P>2. This case arises in the context of allegations of actions, most of which
occurred prior to Mr. Clinton being elected President.  However, the arguments
made by the President would apply equally to actions taken by a sitting
President if those actions were outside the official responsibilities of the
presidency.  Thus, the critical factor is not when the actions occurred, but
whether they were within the President's official responsibilities.</P>
<P>3. Although the motion in the trial court was a motion to dismiss on the

basis of &quot;Presidential immunity,&quot; the President now uses the term &quot;deferral&quot;
rather than &quot;immunity&quot; to describe the relief sought.  Because the
President seeks a per se rule of law to mandate deferral, and relies upon &quot;immunity&quot;
cases such as Nixon v. Fitzgerald, this semantic shift is of no significance. 
The President's request is for a form of immunity, albeit temporal rather than
absolute.  This brief uses the terms &quot;delay,&quot; &quot;deferral,&quot;
and &quot;immunity&quot; interchangeably to reflect the relief sought by the
President.</P>
<P>4. The President does not explicitly address the burdens in cases such as
this.  He argues that the entire case should be delayed until he leaves office. 
Brief for the Petitioner (Pet.Br.) at 10.  The United States argues that the
entire case should be stayed unless respondent can establish &quot;truly
extraordinary circumstances [under which] a stay would not be required.&quot; 
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Support of Petitioner (United States
Br.) at 22.  The law professors argue that the entire case should be delayed
unless respondent establishes an &quot;unusual circumstance [of] compelling
need.&quot;  Brief Amicus Curiae of Law Professors in Support of Petitioner (Law
Professors' Br.) at 16.  All three briefs argue that, to the extent the rule is
less than absolute, this case does not fit the grounds for any exception.</P>
<P>5. In a number of subsequent cases, these principles have been applied and
Presidents have been required to give evidence and even testimony in criminal
cases.  See United States Br. at 25, n.15.</P>
<P>6. In explaining its holding, the Court reviewed the Constitution, history
and the common law.  The Court held that it must weigh &quot;concerns of public
policy, especially as illuminated by our history and structure of our
government.&quot;  457 U.S. at 747-48. With respect to the President, the Court
found that common law provided little guidance and that &quot;the inquiries into
history and policy . . . tend to converge.&quot;  Id. at 748.  No fair
conclusion concerning the outcome of this case can be drawn from the limited and
fragmentary historical evidence.</P>
<P>7. To the extent the President and his amici argue to the contrary, they are
simply wrong.  See Law Professors' Br. at 16, United States Br. at 22.</P>
<P>8. The President suggests that no standards exist or could be developed to
guide the courts in distinguishing &quot;political&quot; from &quot;official&quot;
activities.  Pet.Br. at 32.  That is, of course, incorrect.  For example, the
President himself makes that judgment every time he travels and decides whether
to bill the national committee or the taxpayers for the trip.</P>
<P>9. See e.g. Lou Cannon, President Reagan:  The Role of a Lifetime (Simon and
Schuster, 1991) at 125 (&quot;Reagan wasn't kidding in the slightest when he
told television interviewer Charlie Rose during the 1980 campaign, `Show me an
executive who works long, overtime hours and I'll show you a bad executive'&quot;);
Hedrick Smith, et al., Reagan the Man, the President (MacMillan Publishing,
1980) at 152.</P>
<P>10. &quot;Nixon Ready to Testify,&quot; The National Law Journal, Sept. 29,
1980, at 27:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>According to presidential counsel Lloyd Cutler's office, Mr. Carter hasn't
been named in any suits for personal damages except those in which the president
is cited along with a number of other defendants and quickly dismissed from the
case.  Mr. Ford's lawyer, Dean Burch, of Pierson, Ball &amp; Dowd, of
Washington, D.C., said the former president has been slapped with a number of
suits relating to his pardon of Mr. Nixon, but &quot;[t]o be candid I just refer
them to Justice and don't worry about them.&quot; None of the suits has survived
summary judgment.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11. The President was asked questions about respondent's claims in this suit
during a meeting with a prominent world leader.  Hentoff, &quot;A Day in Court
for Paula Jones,&quot; Washington Post, Nov. 12, 1994, at A25.  This encounter
would likely still have occurred even if there were a rule that suits of this
kind be stayed until the end of a President's term of office.</P>
<P>12. If this Court really wanted to guard against the danger of frivolous
allegations distracting a President, it would have to prohibit citizens from
making public allegations against the President, whether or not they actually

file a complaint or proceed to trial.  But such a rule would clearly violate the
First Amendment.</P>
<P>13. As previously noted, substantial sanctions already exist against the
filing of frivolous lawsuits and such lawsuits will rarely, in any event,
command much of the President's time.  See p.12-13, supra.  The fear that
sitting Presidents will frequently be subject to nonfrivolous litigation for
their private behavior rests on a supposition about the behavior and character
of our Presidents that this Court should not indulge, and that history does not
support.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="interest"></A><B>INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE</B></P>
<P>The interests of amici curiae are set forth in the appendix to this brief.<SUP>1</SUP></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="summary"></A><B>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</B></P>
<P>At issue in this case is no more and no less than (1) whether a mentally
competent, terminally ill person has a liberty interest protected by the
Fourteenth Amendment in choosing to end intolerable suffering by hastening the
timing of an inevitable death, (2) whether a state's interests can justify a
blanket prohibition on physicians providing assistance in the exercise of such a
liberty interest, if it so exists, and (3) whether a state can justifiably grant
certain persons the opportunity to make the choice to hasten death while denying
to other, similarly situated persons the same opportunity.</P>
<P>The right of a competent, terminally ill person to avoid excruciating pain
and embrace a timely and dignified death bears the sanction of history and is
implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. The exercise of this right is as
central to personal autonomy and bodily integrity as rights safeguarded by this
Court's decisions relating to marriage, family relationships, procreation,
contraception, child rearing and the refusal or termination of life-saving
medical treatment. In particular, this Court's recent decisions concerning the
right to refuse medical treatment and the right to abortion instruct that a
mentally competent, terminally ill person has a protected liberty interest in
choosing to end intolerable suffering by bringing about his or her own death.</P>
<P>A state's categorical ban on physician assistance to suicide -- as applied
to competent, terminally ill patients who wish to avoid unendurable pain and
hasten inevitable death -- substantially interferes with this protected liberty
interest and cannot be sustained. Though a state has significant interests in
ensuring that the right at issue here is not abused or misused, an absolute ban
on physician assistance unduly burdens the proper exercise of the right of the
terminally ill to seek freedom from pain through death, especially given the
many less restrictive alternatives which are available to a state and that would
in fact greater serve its claimed interests.</P>
<P>Indeed, states typically and successfully employ less restrictive
alternatives than blanket prohibitions for terminally ill patients depending on
life-sustaining treatment who wish to hasten death. States have recognized the
right of this class of terminally ill patients to escape pain and hasten death
through the termination or refusal of such life support and accompanying
administrations of large and lethal doses of pain-suppressing medication.
Accordingly, a state denies equal protection of its laws when it provides that
one class of persons may exercise this right while others who are similarly
situated for all relevant purposes are wholly denied the opportunity to exercise
the same right for the same reason.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>I.  THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT
PROTECTS THE PERSONAL CHOICE OF A MENTALLY COMPETENT, TERMINALLY ILL INDIVIDUAL
TO TERMINATE UNENDURABLE SUFFERING AND HASTEN INEVITABLE DEATH</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment declares that no State
shall &quot;deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law.&quot; U.S. Const. Amend. XIV. The Due Process Clause has long
been held to contain a substantive component forbidding certain government
actions regardless of procedural fairness. See Planned Parenthood of
Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 846 (1992); Daniels v.
Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 331 (1986).</P>
<P>The content of substantive due process -- i.e., the constitutionally
protected interests comprehended within the term &quot;liberty&quot; -- cannot
be determined by easy reference to any rule, text or historical period. &quot;Neither

the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the
adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive
sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects.&quot; Casey, 505 U.S.
at 848. In the words of Justice Harlan, </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>the full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be
found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere
provided in the Constitution.... It is a rational continuum which, broadly
speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and
purposeless restraints.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Poe v. Ollman, 367 U.S. 497, 543 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting).
Accordingly, in determining the reach of the &quot;least specific and most
comprehensive protection&quot; that is the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of
liberty, courts must employ considered reason and remain &quot;duly mindful of
reconciling the needs both of continuity and of change in a progressive society.&quot;
Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 170, 172 (1952); see also Casey, 505 U.S. at
847-49 (courts must employ &quot;reasoned judgment&quot; to determine the scope
of that &quot;realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter&quot;).</P>
<P>Although the boundaries of substantive due process &quot;are not susceptible
of expression as a simple rule,&quot; Casey, 505 U.S. at 849, this Court has
articulated two basic lines of inquiry for deciding whether a particular right
falls within the liberty provision of the Due Process Clause. First, the Court
has looked to whether the asserted right is &quot;deeply rooted in this Nation's
history and tradition.&quot; Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503
(1977). Second, the Court has consulted the present conscience of the people to
determine whether the asserted right is &quot;implicit in the concept of ordered
liberty,&quot; such that &quot;neither liberty nor justice would exist if [it]
were sacrificed.&quot; Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325-26 (1937).</P>
<P>In this case, either line of inquiry leads to the conclusion that a mentally
competent, terminally ill person's decision to escape unendurable suffering by
choosing to die is entitled to recognition as a constitutionally protected
liberty interest. That is, the right of the terminally ill to find relief from
excruciating pain by hastening death bears the sanction of history.  It is also
entirely consistent with other rights of fundamental personal autonomy that this
Court has found &quot;implicit in the concept of ordered liberty&quot; and thus
embraced by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>A. The Right of a Mentally Competent, Terminally Ill
Person to Choose an End to Suffering by Hastening an Inevitable Death Is Deeply
Rooted in this Nation's History and Tradition.</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Petitioners and their supporting amici contend that history and tradition
support their position, but in doing so they improperly define the practice at
issue here. Although history's view of suicide generally is subject to debate,
this case presents only the narrow question of whether a mentally competent,
terminally ill person has a right to seek an end to intolerable suffering by

hastening an inevitable death.<SUP>2</SUP> Framed in these terms, the
historical analysis appears very different. In fact, there is a strong
historical tradition accepting, and often honoring, terminally ill persons who
choose a timely and dignified death in the face of unrelenting and unendurable
suffering.</P>
<P>This tradition traces back at least as far as the Greek and Roman
philosophers, who accepted suicide where necessary to achieve a dignified death
and to escape from a terminal and incapacitating disease.<SUP>3</SUP> For
example, Plato's Republic sanctioned a choice to die under such circumstances: &quot;If
any man labour of an incurable disease, he may dispatch himself, if it be to his
good.&quot;<SUP>4</SUP> Similarly, the Stoics of Rome, who believed that
freedom must be based on the dictates of the deliberative will rather than
passion or compulsion, embraced suicide as an appropriate response to a terminal
illness whose overpowering physical assaults and demands would otherwise
superimpose itself on the will and usurp the freedom of the sufferer.<SUP>5</SUP></P>
<P>Significantly, neither the Old nor the New Testament prohibits suicide.<SUP>6</SUP>
The notion of suicide as a crime was not introduced until late in Christian
doctrine, and then only as a response to the temptation that martyrdom held for
the early Christians.<SUP>7</SUP> Moreover, despite the Church's general
prohibition on suicide, certain prominent adherents recognized the
appropriateness of choosing death to end intolerable suffering for the
terminally ill. Sir Thomas More, who was later canonized by the Roman Catholic
Church, strongly supported the right of those with incurable diseases to commit
suicide, and in Utopia he depicted the ideal treatment of the terminally ill &quot;full
of continual pain and anguish&quot; as allowing the patient to &quot;despatch
himself out of that painful life, as out of a prison.&quot;<SUP>8</SUP></P>
<P>The origin of suicide as an English common law offense was also
ecclesiastical; thus, the initial penalty was merely the denial of a Christian
burial.<SUP>9</SUP> During feudal times, the penalty was expanded to include
the forfeiture of goods to the suicide's liege lord; later, the Crown declared
suicide a felony, primarily because a felon's goods were then forfeited directly
to the King.<SUP>10</SUP>  The common law, however, has never treated all
suicides alike. Of greatest significance here, it was more lenient from the
outset with those who killed themselves due to an inability to endure the
suffering of disease.<SUP>11</SUP></P>
<P>The crime of suicide, along with the rest of English common law, migrated to
the American colonies, but it never took root even in its more limited form. As
the Ninth Circuit explained: &quot;There is no evidence that any court ever
imposed a punishment for suicide or attempted suicide under common law in
post-revolutionary America. By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in
1868, suicide was generally not punishable, and in only nine of the 37 states is
it clear that there were statutes prohibiting assisting suicide.&quot;
Compassion In Dying v. Washington, 79 F.3d 790, 809 (9th Cir. 1996).</P>
<P>Today, no American jurisdiction criminalizes suicide or attempted suicide.
And while a small majority of states currently criminalize assistance to
suicide, there is no reported American case of a physician criminally punished
for helping a patient commit suicide notwithstanding the fact that assisting the
terminally ill who wish to hasten their deaths has been a time-honored, though
hidden, practice of compassionate physicians.<SUP>12</SUP>  For well over the
past half century, no person (physician or otherwise) has been meaningfully
punished for aiding the terminally ill to end their suffering.<SUP>13</SUP>
This reluctance to prosecute and failure to punish can only be explained by
society's abiding judgment that it has no right to insist on the continued
suffering of the terminally ill, and no right to punish those who honor the
request of the terminally ill by assisting them in ending their agony.<SUP>14</SUP></P>

<P>There is nothing new about the desire of terminally ill patients to end
their suffering by hastening their death. Developments in modern health care
have simply brought into the open a previously private practice that society has
long condoned. Until the early part of this century patients suffering from
incurable conditions overwhelmingly died at home due to the limitations of the
health care system. Their deaths were frequently eased by the ministrations of
alcohol and opiates.<SUP>15 </SUP>Indeed, opiates (including morphine), which
lead to death in excessive doses, were available without prescription until
1914. Thus, terminally ill patients had at their disposal throughout the
Nation's early history the means of hastening death in a certain and gentle
manner when their pain became unendurable.</P>
<P>With the regulation of morphine and other opiates during the last century,
this gentle quitting of a life ravaged by terminal disease was dependent on the
aid of compassionate physicians. The evidence shows that, despite the strictures
of the criminal law, many physicians have long been willing to provide such
assistance.<SUP>16</SUP> They do so in response to an undeniable reality. More
recent advances in medicine have dramatically increased the life span of the
terminally ill; they have also stretched out the &quot;death span,&quot;
prolonging the agony of the end stages of terminal disease, often accompanied by
severe pain, physical deterioration, and unspeakable indignities.</P>
<P>In sum, a review of this nation's history and tradition in fact provides
considerable support for recognition of a constitutionally protected liberty
interest in the choice of the terminally ill to bring an end to their suffering
by hastening an inevitable death.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>B. The Right of a Mentally Competent, Terminally Ill
Person to Choose to End Suffering by Hastening an Inevitable Death Is Implicit
in the Concept of Ordered Liberty.</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The right of the terminally ill to hasten their death and escape intolerable
pain is not only grounded in history, it is also implicit in the very concept of
ordered liberty, as this Court has understood and applied that notion in past
decisions. In particular, the combined force of Planned Parenthood of
Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), and Cruzan v. Director,
Missouri Dept. of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990), leads to the conclusion that the
right of the terminally ill to quit a life burdened by intractable pain in a
gentle and dignified manner is at the core of the liberty interests protected by
the Constitution.</P>
<P>Cruzan and Casey do not stand alone, however. They represent only the latest
examples of an enduring principle that has found expression in numerous cases
over the years. This Court has repeatedly protected from state intrusion a set
of decisions that go to the very essence of what it means to be an individual in
command of a personal history and life course -- decisions relating to marriage,
family relationships, conception, procreation, child rearing, education, and the
refusal or termination of life-saving medical treatment. See Casey, 505 U.S. at
849 (&quot;It is settled now...that the Constitution places limits on a State's
right to interfere with a person's most basic decisions about family and
parenthood, as well as bodily integrity.&quot;) (citations omitted). Review of
this well-settled line of cases reveals the vital presence of three distinct,
though interrelated, components of &quot;liberty,&quot; each of which strongly
supports a finding of constitutional protection for the right of the terminally
ill to hasten inevitable death.</P>
<P>The first and perhaps pre-eminent component of &quot;liberty&quot; protects
the individual's interest in personal dignity and decisional autonomy. See Moore
v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494 (1977); Roe v Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973);
Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967);
Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965); Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S.
158 (1944). These cases develop the central notion that liberty only has meaning
if an individual is able to make central decisions concerning his or her own
life free from significant governmental interference. The decision in Casey
stands as the most recent and most cogent articulation of these principles:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may
make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are
central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of
liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of
the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters
could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion
of the State.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>505 U.S. at 851.</P>
<P>It is beyond dispute that the decision to control the end of one's life when
confronted with terminal illness and intolerable pain is among the most critical
and personal decisions an individual can make. Indeed, given its profound
significance to a person's individual, familial, moral, spiritual and religious
beliefs, it is difficult to view any other life choice as striking more to the
core of personal dignity and autonomy than the decision of a competent and
suffering terminally ill patient concerning how and when to die. Both the
majority and dissents in Cruzan stressed the fundamental nature of the choice at
issue here. See Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 281 (&quot;The choice between life and death
is a deeply personal decision of obvious and overwhelming finality.&quot;); id.
at 310-11 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (&quot;Dying is personal. And it is
profound. For many, the thought of an ignoble end, steeped in decay, is
abhorrent. A quiet, proud death, bodily integrity intact, is a matter of extreme
consequence.&quot;); id. at 343 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (&quot;Choices about
death touch the core of liberty. Our duty, and the concomitant freedom, to come
to terms with the conditions of our own mortality are undoubtedly &quot;so
rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as
fundamental.&quot;... [N]ot much may be said with confidence about death unless
it is said from faith, and that alone is reason enough to protect the freedom to
conform choices about death to individual conscience.&quot;) (citations
omitted).</P>
<P>The second component of &quot;liberty&quot; to be found in this Court's
cases involves bodily integrity. The line of cases supporting this component
arose primarily in the context of medical procedures, and a person's right to
direct the course of his or her own treatment. See Washington v. Harper, 494
U.S. 210 (1990); Winston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753 (1985); Schmerber v. California,
384 U.S. 757 (1966); Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165 (1952); Jacobson v.
Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905). Here the Cruzan decision makes the latest and
most germane statement about the role of bodily integrity in liberty. The
majority in Cruzan explained that this Court's precedents indicate that &quot;a
competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing
unwanted medical treatment,&quot; 497 U.S. at 278, and Justice O'Connor in
concurrence stressed that &quot;our notions of liberty are inextricably entwined
with our idea of physical freedom and self-determination....&quot; 497 U.S. at
287 (O'Connor, J., concurring).</P>
<P>Cruzan clearly stands for the proposition that the bodily integrity
component of liberty, which encompasses the right to direct one's own medical
treatment, is so fundamental that it is to be honored even when the consequence
of the choice is hastening an individual's death. Accordingly, this component of
liberty must extend to persons like the patient-respondents who, with their
lives ending and their bodies wracked with pain, sought the means to preserve
their dignity and control over their bodily integrity by obtaining prescribed
medication to terminate their suffering.<SUP>17</SUP></P>
<P>The third and final component of &quot;liberty&quot; supporting
constitutional protection of the ability to choose a peaceful death is the right
to avoid intolerable suffering. As the United States highlights in its brief
(Govt. Br. in Glucksberg at 14), a liberty interest is surely implicated if the
State itself inflicts severe pain and suffering. See Ingraham v. Wright, 430
U.S. 651, 674 (1977); see also Hudson v. McMillan, 503 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1992). A
liberty interest is also implicated when the state interferes with an
individual's ability to relieve his or her pain, as the United States again
appropriately recognizes. See Govt. Br. in Glucksberg at 14-15; cf. Estelle v.
Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976). Casey acknowledges that the ability to seek
relief from pain is a component of the &quot;liberty&quot; protected under the
Due Process Clause -- especially when the pain at issue is itself integrally
bound up with a decision which implicates the dignity and autonomy interests in
directing one's own life course that are also the province of the Due Process
Clause:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The mother who carries a child to full term is subject to anxieties, to
physical constraints, to pain that only she must bear.... Her suffering is too
intimate and personal for the State to insist, without more, upon its own vision
of the woman's role.... The destiny of the woman must be shaped to a large
extent on her own conception of her spiritual imperatives and her place in
society.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>505 U.S. at 852.</P>
<P>The same principle applies where a state prohibition relegates competent,
terminally ill individuals to continue to suffer acute pain without the option
of a gentle, hastened death. Like the pregnant woman's decision, the decision of
a terminally ill individual to quit life in the face of unendurable pain and
certain death is too intimate, too personal, and too central to the totality and
meaning of that person's life for the State to impose its own philosophical and
moral imperatives upon that decision. Indeed, the personal stories of the
patient-plaintiffs plainly illustrate the extent of the suffering at stake in
these cases.<SUP>18</SUP> The United States properly recognizes this &quot;significant
liberty interest&quot; in its brief, noting that &quot;it persists even at the
point at which avoiding severe pain and suffering coalesces with ending life.&quot;
Govt. Br. in Glucksberg at 16. This view resonates fully with the decision in
Cruzan, which teaches that a liberty interest persists even to the point where
an individual decides to hasten his or her death through the refusal of
life-sustaining treatment.<SUP>19</SUP></P>
<P>These three components of &quot;liberty,&quot; all recognized by this Court
as hallmarks of &quot;the concept of ordered liberty,&quot; forge a strong base
of constitutional support protecting the right of a competent, terminally ill
person to choose to end suffering by gently hastening death. To deny
constitutional protection for this right would undermine concepts of liberty and
autonomy previously recognized as sacrosanct. &quot;Making someone die in a way
that others approve, but he believes a horrifying contradiction of his life, is
a devastating, odious form of tyranny.&quot;<SUP>20</SUP> The right to define
the limits of one's endurance in the face of terminal illness and to embrace a
swifter, more gentle death, should be recognized as an essential component of
liberty under the Due Process Clause.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>II.  A BLANKET PROHIBITION AGAINST AID TO SUICIDE UNDULY
BURDENS THE RIGHT OF THE TERMINALLY ILL TO MAKE RATIONAL END OF LIFE DECISIONS</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If this Court determines that the right of the terminally ill to escape
intolerable pain and suffering through hastening death is a liberty interest
protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, there can be little doubt that the laws
at issue here &quot;operate as a substantial obstacle&quot; to the exercise of
that constitutionally protected personal liberty interest. Casey, 505 U.S. at
895.</P>
<P>Amici acknowledge that the states have a significant interest in the
preservation of life that permits them to regulate, even quite extensively, the
exercise of the right of the terminally ill to choose the time and manner of
their death. Indeed, such regulation is undoubtedly appropriate to ensure the
right at issue here is not misused. This case, however, does not involve
regulation, but prohibition. And, in this context, it is undeniable that an
absolute ban on obtaining assistance from a physician unduly burdens the right
of the terminally ill to escape pain by hastening death. Indeed, for many
terminally ill patients, it precludes it entirely. Furthermore, there are less
restrictive alternatives available that would in fact better serve the interests
claimed by the states in this case.<SUP>21</SUP></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>A. A Blanket Ban on Assistance to Suicide Is a
Substantial Obstacle to the Right of the Terminally Ill to End Their Suffering.</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A state's blanket prohibition against aid in dying unduly burdens the right
of terminally ill individuals to end their suffering and hasten their death,
preventing significant numbers of terminally ill from achieving the release from
suffering that they desire and relegating still others to unacceptable options.
Along with improving and extending life, the advances of modern medicine have
transformed radically the social circumstances of death. Whereas only a
generation ago the vast majority of persons died at home, now approximately 80%
of individuals die in hospitals and long-term care institutions.<SUP>22</SUP>
It is, as a practical matter, impossible for the terminally ill who are
institutionalized to obtain release from suffering unassisted; without aid, they
are unable to obtain the means for a swifter death. Moreover, a state's blanket
prohibition against aid in dying presents an absolute obstacle to those who do
not wish to quit their lives until their terminal illnesses progress to the
point at which they lack the very strength to accomplish suicide unassisted. One
consequence is particularly intolerable. Faced with increasing weakness and loss
of autonomy in the final stages of an illness, terminally ill patients who have
chosen to avoid lengthy and excruciating deaths are often forced to end their
lives prematurely for fear that further loss of strength or intense medical
supervision effectively will deprive them of their choice.</P>
<P>Furthermore, such terminally ill patients often are driven to end their
lives by violent means and entirely alone. Ironically, such violent means are
often legally accessible, whereas the medical means that might allow the patient
to quit life gently are now inaccessible in the absence of a physician willing
to transgress the law. The fear of implicating one's friends or family in crime,
moreover, often induces the terminally ill to carry out their resolve secretly
and alone. The trauma is then magnified for friends and family who must deal not
only with the death, but the gruesome means employed and the fact that their
loved one was forced to meet death unsupported and alone.<SUP>23</SUP></P>
<P>Other terminally ill individuals determined to end their suffering
frequently turn for help to friends or family members, who must then choose
between love and compassion or the dictates of the law.<SUP>24</SUP> Thus,
another cruelty caused by the ban on assistance is that non-physician assisted
suicides are amateurish affairs, always clandestine and often bungled. One
Canadian study of &quot;back-alley euthanasia&quot; among the Vancouver AIDS
population found that one-half of assisted suicides were botched, perversely
increasing -- rather than alleviating -- suffering.<SUP>25</SUP></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>B. The States' Asserted Interests Do Not Justify an
Absolute Ban on Physician Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill.</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In opposition to this right, Washington and New York invoke interests in
preserving human life, precluding undue influence or mistake, safeguarding the
integrity of the medical profession and a concern over the &quot;slippery-slope&quot;
-- i.e., that line-drawing in this area will prove impossible. These interests
and concerns, however legitimate, do not justify an absolute ban on physician
aid in dying for terminally ill persons and should not outweigh the recognized
right of a competent, terminally ill individual to end his or her suffering.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>1.  Interest in Preserving Each Citizen's Life.</B></P>
<P>First, as this Court has determined, a state's interest in the preservation
of every citizen's life, such as that asserted by New York and Washington here,
abstracted from the value that a particular person may place on the continuation
of that life, cannot outweigh a terminally ill individual's choice to end
suffering and quit a life burdened by intractable pain and irreversible
disintegration. Casey, 505 U.S. at 857 (&quot;[A] State's interest in the
protection of life falls short of justifying any plenary override of individual
liberty claims.&quot;).<SUP>26</SUP></P>
<P>Second, the pitiless process by which many terminally ill die -- the
unremitting pain, the erosion of privacy and dignity, the loss of control over
basic bodily functions -- leads some to conclude that the burden of their
corporeal existence degrades the very humanity it was meant to serve. In
choosing to end their suffering, the terminally ill do not repudiate an interest
in life but seek to affirm a meaningful life with a dignified death.<SUP>27</SUP></P>
<P>In these circumstances, a state may not insist that the terminally ill
endure the unendurable in order to promote the state's abstract interest in the
preservation of life. To do so is to appropriate an individual's existence, and
to prolong cruel and unusual torment, for the purpose of proselytizing the
state's preferred philosophical view of life. This a state may not
constitutionally do.<SUP>28</SUP></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>2.  Preventing Undue Influence or Mistake.</B></P>

<P>Washington and New York also rely on their interest in protecting vulnerable
citizens. They argue that the right at issue, if recognized, would be subject to
abuse and mistake -- that requests for aid in dying would be mistakenly granted
to those not terminally ill (because incorrectly diagnosed) or to those whose
request was not truly voluntary (due to undiagnosed depression, lack of
capacity, inadequately treated pain, or undue influence from family or
physician).</P>
<P>These concerns, however, are not unique to the present situation. The risk
of abuse or mistake exists in many medical contexts, including the end-of-life
decisions already condoned by the State. These risks are routinely and
appropriately dealt with through regulation. For example, only an informed
competent adult may consent to an order not to resuscitate, see, e.g., N.Y. Pub.
Health Law &#167;&#167; 2960 et seq. (McKinney's 1993). Similarly, only a
competent principal may appoint a health care agent (who may be a family member)
who has the power to decide not to resuscitate or to terminate life support for
the principal in the event of incapacity. See, e.g., N.Y. Pub. Health Law &#167;2981
(McKinney 1993). Indeed, under applicable state statutes, a finding of
competence is a necessary precondition to the execution of health care
directives.<SUP>29</SUP></P>
<P>If the law permits life-ending actions to be taken on the basis of
competence in other medical contexts, there is no reason to claim that such a
determination is impossible in this setting. Moreover, the recognition of the
right to physician aid-in-dying would better address some of the state's
concerns here. Whereas the current legal regime may lead the terminally ill to
hide their wish for suicide from their doctor for fear that needed pain
medication may be withheld, recognition of the right to physician assistance in
hastening death would encourage frank discussion between the terminally ill
considering suicide and their treating physician. Such discussions necessarily
would raise the issue of the patient's mental state and the pain being
experienced, and lead to  the provision of treatment for depression, where
warranted, or for pain, where all available methods have not been tried.
Furthermore, where family or friends have improperly planted the thought of
suicide, involvement of an objective physician would be salutary.</P>

<P>With respect to the concern over mistaken diagnosis (as with the previous
concerns), safeguards short of an absolute ban can be  crafted to minimize the
likelihood of misdiagnosis to a very small order of probability.<SUP>30</SUP>
Furthermore, the risk is equally present in other end-of-life decisions already
condoned by the state such as the  withdrawal or refusal of life-support by the
terminally ill.<SUP>31</SUP></P>
<P>Furthermore, the state's concerns regarding mistake in the exercise of the
right ignore the consequences of a prophylactic outright ban on the terminally
ill who are unquestionably competent and unquestionably in the end-stage of
terminal disease.</P>
<P>These terminally ill would be left acutely to suffer -- having been
foreclosed, as the United States acknowledges, from the &quot;one humane and
certain route of escape from pain and suffering.&quot; Govt. Br. in Quill at 15.

These individuals, whose lives have already been so horribly compromised, cannot
be forced to such a sacrifice.</P>
<P>Moreover, the current unregulated practice of assisted suicide by the
terminally ill is clearly more subject to the abuse and mistake that concern
petitioners and their amici. Existing back-alley methods provide no safeguards
at all and thus no assurance that diagnosis will be accurate, that depression
will be identified, and that undue influence has not been exercised. Yet, if the
right claimed here is not recognized, certain terminally ill patients who are
incapable of enduring further suffering will resort to self-help or the
back-alley methods currently available with all of their significant risks.</P>
<P>Accordingly, amici urge recognition of the right claimed by respondents.
Amici also support the use of legislative safeguards to ensure that all requests
of the terminally ill for aid in dying are the product of thoughtful and
informed self-determination.<SUP>32</SUP> Petitioners have offered no
persuasive justification to support the need for a total prohibition.<SUP>33</SUP></P>
<P>Indeed, several model statutes for physician assistance to the terminally
ill already exist that incorporate procedural safeguards to screen out
inappropriate cases, including requirements of: witnesses to ensure
voluntariness (neither related to the patient nor involved in his or her
treatment); reasonable waiting periods to preclude rash decisions; confirmation
by a second physician of the terminal diagnosis and that the patient has been
receiving proper palliative care; psychological examination to ensure that the
patient is not suffering from a momentary or treatable depression; and reporting
procedures.<SUP>34</SUP></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>3.  Implicating Doctors in Killing and Slippery-Slope
Arguments.</B></P>
<P>Petitioners and their amici also contend that affirming the decisions below
will lead to the erosion of society's confidence in the medical profession by
implicating physicians in intentional killings. But, as the Second Circuit
correctly noted, the physician assistance sought by patient-plaintiffs in this
case, &quot;the writing of  a prescription to hasten death ..., involves a far
less active role for  the physician than is required in bringing about death
through&quot; the withdrawal of life support. Quill v. Vacco, 80 F.3d 716, 729
(2d Cir. 1996). Accordingly, the right the patient-plaintiffs wished to exercise
in this case implicates doctors in intentionally killing, and risks tarnishing
their image, no more than does the currently sanctioned practice of removing
life-sustaining medical treatment. See Compassion, 79 F.3d at 828 (&quot;Given
the similarity between what doctors are now permitted to do and what the
plaintiffs assert they should be permitted to do, we see no risk at all to the
integrity of the profession.&quot;). Furthermore, since safeguarding of the
right at issue here will permit and encourage candid discussions of all
available options between the terminally ill and their physicians, instead of &quot;criminaliz[ing]
the provision of medical assistance to patients in need,&quot; id. at 827,
recognizing the right of the terminally ill to obtain the relief they seek from
their doctors would foster rather than erode public confidence in the medical
profession.</P>
<P>The other argument raised by petitioners and their supporting amici is that
recognition of the right to physician aid-in-dying urged here would somehow be
uncontainable. These sorts of slippery-slope arguments can be made in opposition
to any constitutional right (and have been leveled against many recently
recognized, including the right to terminate life-sustaining treatment and the
right to abortion). Recognition of any right creates the possibility of its
abuse; but petitioners do not raise any cogent concerns that could not be
addressed in ways that still allow the right to be exercised.</P>
<P>Finally, Petitioners point to the difficulty in defining the category of the
&quot;terminally ill.&quot; In fact, this term has been used (and defined) in &quot;living
will&quot; statutes in effect in 40 states. See Compassion, 79 F.3d at 818 &amp;
nn.77-78 (listing state statutes). While the term is not free from difficulty,
it has proved workable and is not problematically unconstitutionally vague.<SUP>35</SUP></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>III.  BECAUSE TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS ON LIFE SUPPORT
HAVE THE RIGHT TO MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IN HASTENING DEATH, DENYING TERMINALLY ILL
PATIENTS NOT ON LIFE SUPPORT MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IN HASTENING DEATH VIOLATES THE

EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT.</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The arguments supporting the right urged here are further buttressed by the
fact that New York, Washington and most other states, have recognized the right
of a competent, terminally ill patient to choose to end a dehumanizing process
of dying by hastening inevitable death. Indeed, they have recognized the right
to physician assistance in implementing this choice. Most states, however, have
explicitly extended this right only to a limited category of terminally ill
patients: those dependent on life-support, including the provision of
life-sustaining hydration and nutrition, who are permitted to end their
suffering by directing the termination of such treatment even where the express
purpose of such action is to hasten death. Physicians who comply with these
directives are immune from criminal liability. But other terminally ill
patients, also facing imminent death but not undergoing such treatments, are not
granted the right to truncate a dehumanizing and agonizing dying process and to

embrace a swifter death through medical assistance.</P>
<P>The Equal Protection Clause mandates that &quot;all persons similarly
circumstanced shall be treated alike.&quot; Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 252
U.S. 412, 415 (1920). The Second Circuit recognized that, with respect to the
decision to end intolerable suffering by hastening an inevitable death, all
terminally ill persons are similarly situated, whether or not on life support.
But, by denying only those not on life support access to a medical means to
achieve their desired end, &quot;New York law does not treat equally all
competent persons who are in the final stages of fatal illness and wish to
hasten their deaths.&quot; Quill v. Vacco, 80 F.3d 716, 727 (2d Cir. 1996).
Accordingly, New York's laws (and their Washington equivalents) which prohibit
only some terminally ill from obtaining an escape from their pain &quot;are
violative of the Equal Protection Clause.&quot; Id.</P>
<P>Petitioners argue that there is a constitutionally significant distinction
between the withdrawal of medical treatment (even life-sustaining medical
treatment) and the release from suffering sought by the respondents in this
case. In fact, as the United States essentially acknowledges, see Govt. Br. in
Quill at 10, 13, and as the Second Circuit found, see Quill, 80 F.3d at 729-30,
there is no material distinction between the patient's choice in either case or
between the physician's involvement in accomplishing that choice.</P>
<P>In both cases the patient is making the decision to curtail weeks or months
of suffering in the face of further devastation and certain death. Terminally
ill patients who request the discontinuance of life-sustaining treatment, like
the terminally ill patient-plaintiffs who by this action sought to hasten death
by consuming drugs prescribed for this purpose, have made a conscious decision
to die and seek medical assistance to accomplish their desire.<SUP>36</SUP> The
medical assistance required to implement this choice is far greater (both in
terms of quantity of activity and causal nexus to death) than the prescription
of medication to be self-administered by the terminally ill. In the case of the
withdrawal of life support, the physician must remove the medical machinery
sustaining life, monitor the resultant accelerated dying process and administer
morphine or barbiturates to ease the pain that would otherwise  attend such a
death. These medications typically must be administered in doses that in fact
precipitate an even earlier death.<SUP>37</SUP></P>
<P>Thus the Talmudic distinction petitioners press between the allegedly &quot;natural&quot;
death accomplished by withdrawing life-sustaining treatment and the allegedly &quot;unnatural&quot;
deaths sought here, is not sustainable. In both cases the motive force is the
patient's intention to hasten impending and certain death and in both cases the
physician provides the medical assistance to ensure that that desire can be
accomplished in a certain, gentle and medically supervised manner. As the Second
Circuit rightly concluded in Quill, the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment
by the physician is not &quot;passive&quot; assistance to that desire nor does
it allow for a &quot;natural&quot; death. See 80 F.3d at 729.</P>
<P>Petitioner's specious distinction between, and undue emphasis upon, natural
and unnatural deaths has warped treatment decisions made by compassionate
doctors wishing to respond to requests from terminally ill patients who are not
on respirators or receiving artificial nutrition and hydration but who,
nonetheless, have reached the limit of their endurance. In such cases,
physicians sometimes have aided these patients by contriving a death that mimics
those regarded by petitioners as &quot;natural.&quot; This practice, sometimes
referred to as terminal sedation, involves medicating the patient into a
sleep-like state until the patient dies of starvation or dehydration, days or
perhaps weeks later. See AMA Br. in Glucksberg at 10; Resp. Br. in Quill at
section III.B.</P>
<P>Indeed, as part of palliative care for the terminally ill, doctors routinely
have supplied the causal agent of patients' deaths under the doctrine of &quot;double
effect.&quot; Where the terminally ill suffer from intractable pain in the final
stages of disease, doctors sometimes will choose to administer an intravenous
morphine drip that eases suffering by inducing a sleep-like state and also
hastens death by suppressing respiration; as with terminal sedation, death may
be precipitated in a matter of days. Medical ethicists and the Catholic Church
justify action such as terminal sedation and morphine drips on the ground of the
&quot;double effect,&quot; reasoning that the physician's operative intent is to
relieve pain, while death is regarded as a foreseen but unintended consequence.</P>
<P>But the patients at issue in these cases also seek a release from suffering,
and also believe that such relief can only be accomplished by their deaths.
There is no constitutionally cognizable reason that the prescription of
medication to eliminate suffering and achieve a peaceful death can only be
legally permissible where death is accomplished gradually (by starvation,
dehydration or asphyxiation) while the patient is put into a twilight zone that
can last days or weeks. This option, where one is subject to the unknown sensory
experiences and state of consciousness that might attend such a drug induced
coma, while one's loved ones stand vigil for days or weeks, may appear a
monstrous and horrifying prospect to the terminally ill who wish for a certain
and gentle death.</P>
<P>Moreover, the practice of terminal sedation and intravenous morphine drip
places the decision in the hands of doctors rather than patients.<SUP>38</SUP>
Amici urge that the right pressed here -- which is also meant to relieve
suffering by hastening inevitable death -- better serves the needs and autonomy
interests of terminally ill patients.</P>
<P>The distinction urged by Petitioners between the competent terminally ill
who wish to die and those who wish to terminate life-sustaining treatment (or
who are willing to undergo terminal sedation) certainly cannot survive the
heightened scrutiny required when fundamental rights are at stake and, as the
Second Circuit found, its very rationality is difficult to ascertain.<SUP>39</SUP>
In short, because a complete ban on the prescription of medication to competent
terminally ill patients who wish to hasten death does not serve the state's
expressed interest as well as would appropriately drawn regulations, it is
violative of the Equal Protection Clause.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="conclusion"></A><B>CONCLUSION</B></P>
<P>For the foregoing reasons, Amici respectfully request that the judgments of
the Courts of Appeals be affirmed and that the New York and Washington statutes
prohibiting physician-assisted suicide be declared unconstitutional as applied
to competent terminally ill persons requesting such aid to escape unendurable
suffering.</P>

<P>1. Letters of consent to the filing of this brief have been lodged with the
Clerk of the Court pursuant to Rule 37.3.</P>
<P>2. The complaint in the case from Washington asserted the issue in terms of
whether the &quot;Fourteenth Amendment protects the rights of terminally ill
adults with no chance of recovery to make decisions about the end of their
lives, including the right to choose to hasten inevitable death with suitable
physician-prescribed drugs and thereby avoid pain and suffering.&quot; Pet. App.
A17 n.7. The first paragraph of the complaint describing the nature of the
action brought in New York asserted the issue in the same terms.</P>
<P>As the Ninth Circuit noted, following the approach of this Court's abortion
decisions, the liberty interest at stake is not the right to assistance with
suicide but, rather, the right of the terminally ill to hasten their death. If
such a right exists, then the inquiry is whether a complete ban on assistance in
exercising this liberty interest constitutes an undue burden. See Compassion In
Dying v. Washington, 79 F.3d 790, 801-02 (9th Cir. 1996).</P>
<P>3. The Court has considered the moral tradition of the Greeks in assessing
other liberty interests. See Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 130-32 (1973).</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I will not relinquish old age if it leaves my better part intact. But if it
begins to shake my mind, if it destroys its faculties one by one, if it leaves
me not life but breath, I will depart from the putrid or tottering edifice. I
will not escape by death from disease so long as it may be healed, and leaves my
mind unimpaired. I will not raise my hand against myself on account of pain, for
so to die is to be conquered. But I know if I must suffer without hope of
relief, I will depart, not through fear of the pain itself, but because it
prevents all for which I would live.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Quoted in Sherman B. Nuland, How We Die 151 (1993).</P>
<P>6. None of the four suicides recorded in the Old Testament -- Samson, Saul,
Abimelech and Achitophel -- is criticized. See Alfred Alvarez, &quot;The
Background&quot; 12, in M. Babst Battin &amp; David J. Mayo, Suicide: The
Philosophical Issues (1980). The New Testament (Matthew) records the suicide of
Judas Iscariot perfunctorily, &quot;instead of being added to his crimes, it
seems a measure of his repentance.&quot; Id. &quot;In the first years of the
Church, suicide was such a neutral subject that even the death of Jesus was
regarded by Tertullian, one of the most fiery of the early Fathers, as a kind of
suicide.&quot; Id.</P>
<P>7. The Christian church taught that the world was a vale of tears, sin and
temptation, from which death would release the faithful into eternal glory.
Martyrdom afforded certain redemption, and the names of early martyrs were
celebrated and their relics worshiped. The temptation to martyrdom culminated in
the frenzy of the Donatists who, in the fourth and fifth centuries, actively

pursued death. In response, St. Augustine argued in his writings that suicide
was a sin.</P>
<P>These arguments, coupled with the example of the Donatists, convinced the
Church to legislate against suicide. See id. at 25-28.</P>

appears that such cases either have not been prosecuted or have resulted in
acquittal or sentences of probation. See id. In the last decade, of course,
there have been several well-publicized prosecutions. All, so far, have resulted
in jury acquittals. See Jeff Stryker, A Bedside Manner for Death and Dying, N.Y.

<P>14. Indeed, to argue that suicide by persons suffering from terminal illness
is ethically wrong, philosophers and theologians have had to resort to the
concept of God's proprietary claim over his creations. John Locke argued that
suicide was a crime because man does not have absolute dominion over himself;
his being belongs to God and he thus has no right to destroy it. &quot;[M]en
being the workmanship of one omnipotent ... makes all servants of one sovereign
master, sent into the world by his order and about his business -- they are his
property, whose workmanship they are, made to last during his, not another's
pleasure.&quot; John Locke, The Second Treatise of Government, (C.B. Macpherson,
ed.) 9, 17, 21 (1980). The theologian, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, has similarly
stated: &quot;It becomes quite clear that a purely moral judgment on suicide is
impossible, and indeed that suicide has nothing to fear from an atheistic ethic.
The right to suicide is nullified only by the living God.&quot; Quoted in P.
Baelz, &quot;Suicide: Some Theological Reflections,&quot; in Battin &amp; Mayo,
supra, at 75.</P>
<P>However deeply held such religious views may be, they cannot (without more)
be the basis for government regulation. See Casey, 505 U.S. at 850 (explaining
that religious views concerning a liberty &quot;cannot control our decision. Our
obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.&quot;);
id. at 914 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (&quot;[I]n
order to be legitimate, the State's interest must be secular; consistent with
the First Amendment the State may not promote a theological or sectarian
interest.&quot;)</P>
<P>15. Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept. of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 339 n.11
(1990) (Stevens, J., dissenting).</P>
<P>16. See generally Julia Pugliese, Note, Don't Ask-Don't Tell: The Secret
Practice of Physician-Assisted Suicide, 44 Hastings L. J. 1290, 1297-99 (1993);
Timothy E. Quill, Death and Dignity: A Case of Individualized Decision Making,
324 New Eng. J. Med. 691, 694 (1991).</P>
<P>17. Though the United States finds that &quot;Cruzan supports the conclusion
that a liberty interest is at stake in this case,&quot; Govt. Br. in Glucksberg
at 15, it also suggests that this case does not involve Cruzan's interest in &quot;avoiding
invasions of bodily integrity.&quot; Id. at 16. Such a view misses the reality
of those who seek to exercise the right at issue here. Like the
patient-plaintiffs in these cases, dying patients seeking to hasten death are
typically in excruciating pain and often physically incapacitated; frequently
their entire bodily existence is conscripted by the demands and relentless
assaults of an incurable disease. To suggest that such persons' &quot;bodily
integrity&quot; is unaffected if they are denied the opportunity to seek
medication to bring their suffering to an end -- and are thereby forced to
continue an existence which they view as a torment -- evinces a remarkably
hollow conception of the right to bodily integrity. Of course, this Court's
precedents encompass a much fuller conception of bodily integrity. As Casey made
clear when it held that denial of access to the medical procedure of abortion
touches &quot;upon the very bodily integrity of the pregnant woman,&quot; 505
U.S. at 896, this Court has recognized an interference with a liberty interest
whenever persons have particular courses of medical treatment thrust upon them

or denied to them contrary to their interests or consent. See, e.g., Washington,
494 U.S. at 229; Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 24-30; see also Vitek v. Jones, 455 U.S.
480, 494 (1980); Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 600 (1979).</P>
<P>18. Washington notes that respondents and their supporting amici placed
before the Courts of Appeals numerous &quot;anecdotes&quot; of the terminally
ill who wished to hasten their death and avoid painful, undignified and inhumane
endings to their lives. The State of Washington urges that this Court not make
constitutional decisions based on &quot;anecdotes.&quot; See Washington Br. at
18. But these personal stories, though brief and obviously inadequate to portray
essentially indescribable human suffering, are meant to help the Court to
conjure the unimaginable pain and suffering experienced by those who might avail
themselves of the right urged here. As the United States acknowledges (Govt. Br.
in Glucksberg at 18 &amp; n.1), an irreducible core of terminally ill patients
(including an estimated 10% of all cancer patients) cannot obtain relief through
palliative treatment but are trapped in physical agony. In some cases, pain
cannot be controlled even with full and appropriately timed doses of narcotics;
in other cases, the toxic effects of the palliative agents may be intolerable.
See Howard Brody, Assisted Death -- A Compassionate Response to Medical Failure,
327 New Eng. J. Med. 1385 (1992). Moreover, the invocation of the capabilities
of modern palliative medicine ignores the subjective nature of suffering; the
diminished fortitude in the face of suffering when all hope of recovery is gone;
the practical reality that pain can often only be allayed, if at all, at the
cost of mental alertness; and the loss of dignity that accompanies physical
deterioration. In these circumstances (the &quot;anecdotes&quot; that
respondents and their amici place before the Court), compassion and the
Constitution dictate that these terminally ill patients not be denied their wish
for a hastened and gentle death.</P>
<P>19. In Cruzan, this Court noted that the &quot;logic of [prior] cases&quot;
would extend the liberty interest in refusing medical treatment to refusing &quot;the
forced administration of life-sustaining medical treatment, and even of
artificially delivered food and water essential to life.&quot; 497 U.S. at 279.</P>
<P>20. R. Dworkin Life's Dominion: An Argument About Abortion, Euthanasia, and
Individual Freedom at 217 (1993).</P>
<P>21. This Court has not always employed a single test when weighing the
strength of the state's asserted justification for abridging a fundamental
liberty interest. In  Casey, the Court adopted an &quot;undue burden&quot; test
that focussed on whether the challenged regulation placed a &quot;substantial
obstacle&quot; in the path of a woman seeking a pre-viability abortion. In other
contexts, this Court has emphasized the need for narrow tailoring. See, e.g.,
City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. at 499.  Under either formulation, a total ban
on physician-assisted suicide cannot be upheld. As explained below, it clearly
represents a &quot;substantial obstacle&quot; to terminally ill individuals who
wish to end their suffering and it is not narrowly tailored to achieve the
state's asserted interests.</P>
<P>22. See Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 302 (Brennan, J., dissenting); id. at 339-40
(Stevens, J., dissenting) (&quot;People are less likely to die at home, and more
likely to die in relatively public places, such as hospitals or nursing homes.
Ultimate questions that might once have been dealt with in intimacy by a family
and its physician have now become the concern of institutions.&quot;).</P>
<P>23. The ban on physician assistance may not only cause terminally ill
individuals to commit suicide prematurely or preclude a gentle death or one in
the company of friends and family, but it also may frustrate the very desire for
certain death when self-inflicted attempts fail, thereby causing additional and
gratuitous suffering to the tormented patient. See Quill, supra note 16 at
117-20.</P>
<P>24. See, e.g., K. Frederickson, Torn Mother: I Helped Her Pass On, Oregon
Bulletin, May 16, 1994, at A1 (giving account of mother's explanation, after
expiration of statute of limitations, how she finally acceded to daughter's plea
to assist her suicide after months of watching daughter's wasting from bone
cancer in too much pain to endure even her mother's touch).</P>

<P>25. See Clyde H. Farnsworth, Vancouver AIDS Suicides Botched, N.Y. Times,
June 14, 1994, at C12. For example,</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In five cases, victims were unsuccessfully suffocated. In one case, the
people who assisted in the suicide resorted to slitting the victim's wrists with
a razor blade and in another case to shooting him. Two were injected with pure
heroin. Many of the acts of euthanasia took several hours or longer to be
completed. In one case it took four days.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id.; see also Gina Kolata, AIDS Patients Seek Solace in Suicide But Many
Risk Added Pain in Failure, N.Y. Times, June 14, 1994, at C1 (reporting on man
who in trying to bring on a gentle death by smothering his lover with pillow,
asphyxiated him only enough to destroy most of his brain function).</P>
<P>26. In Cruzan, the majority stated</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>we think a State may properly decline to make judgments about the &quot;quality&quot;
of life that a particular individual may enjoy, and simply assert an unqualified
interest in the preservation of human life to be weighed against the
constitutionally protected interests of the individual.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>497 U.S. at 282. Indeed, a state has no other choice. More specifically, a
state cannot make determinations about the worth or quality of an individual's
life and then rely on that determination as a basis for making life or death
decisions. For the terminally ill, the meaning of life and the impact of
physical and psychological agony represent the most personal of judgments that
the state may not usurp.</P>
<P>27. As Justice Stevens noted, an interest in life &quot;includes an interest
in how [one] will be thought of after ... death by those whose opinions mattered&quot;
during life. &quot;How [one] dies will affect how that life is remembered.&quot;
Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 344 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Those enduring a life racked
with pain and utter helplessness may reasonably reject the prospect of a long
vigil where family and friends loyally and lovingly witness their
disintegration. The terminally ill reasonably may assert an interest in being
remembered for how they lived rather than the excruciating, relentless and
lengthy process by which they died.</P>
<P>28. A state may not even use a person's car as a moving billboard to
proselytize its views on life's meaning by insisting that the state's motto
appear on citizens' license plates. See Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977).
In the abortion context, a state may not insist that a woman carry a
not-yet-viable life to term to affirm the state's view of women's role or its
philosophic view of when life begins. Casey, 505 U.S. at 851. Equally, a state
may not promote its view of the sanctity of life by insisting that a terminally
ill individual bear unrelieved suffering rather than hasten death.</P>
<P>29. See generally Compassion, 79 F.3d at 818 (citing numerous statutes).</P>
<P>30. Model regulations have provided that a patient seeking physician
assistance in hastening death receive confirmation by at least two physicians
(or an entire committee of physicians) that they are in the terminal phase of
their illness before such a request will be honored.  See infra p. 22 &amp;
n.34.</P>
<P>31.  The United States argues that an incorrect diagnosis in the case of the
withdrawal of life support does not, as it would here, result in death. See
Govt. Br. in Quill at 14. In support, the United States points to Karen Ann
Quinlan, who lived for years after her life support was disconnected. Id. But
the Government's argument conflates two possibilities of misdiagnosis at stake
in a terminally ill patient's decision to withdraw life-support and hasten
death; dependence on life-support (not at issue in this case) and the terminal
phase of an irreversible disease (which is at issue in this case). Withdrawing
life-support does not lead to death where there has been a misdiagnosis of
dependence on life support. On the other hand, where the misdiagnosis involves
the reversibility of the disease (i.e., whether it is terminal) -- the only
diagnosis at issue here -- a misdiagnosis leading to withdrawal of life support
will lead to a death. In such cases, a person whose condition might have
improved if retained on life support, is removed from life support and allowed
to die. Despite such risks (which can be and are minimized through requirements
of diagnostic confirmation), the right to hasten death through  directing the
discontinuation of life support has been vouchsafed to the terminally ill.</P>
<P>32. The recommendation of the New York State Task Force, relied on heavily
by petitioners and their amici, is instructive in this context. In its 1994
report, When  Death Is Sought; Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in the Medical
Context, the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law unanimously
recommended that New  York's statutory ban on assisting suicide be retained due
to the risk of abuse and mistake if physician-assisted suicide for the
terminally ill was allowed. In support of its recommendation, the New York State
Task Force, like New York and Washington herein, focused on requests that were
or might be made due to untreated pain or depression or undue influence. But
when confronted with the specific issue raised by these cases -- voluntary
requests from the competent and suffering terminally ill -- some Task Force
members endorsed assisted suicide as a means of showing respect for the
autonomy, and compassion for the suffering, of these patients. They preferred,
however, that such patients obtain medical help clandestinely from courageous
doctors willing to violate the law. See id. at 141. Thus, in circumstances
directly and solely at issue here, some members of the Task Force urged that the
New York laws be disobeyed.</P>
<P>33. The briefs of petitioners and their supporting amici rely on anecdotes
(and selective studies -- which are not uncontradicted -- about experiences in
another nation) to argue that regulation could not effectively safeguard the
right claimed here. Notably, these anecdotes do not involve the exercise of the
right to the refusal or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment which has been
effectively regulated. Instead, petitioners and their amici rely largely on
hypothesized scenarios and anecdotes relating to the clandestine exercise of
physician aid in dying, which at present is illegal and entirely unregulated.
Neither these, nor the disputed experience of another nation, provide a
sufficient basis to argue against the right urged here.</P>
<P>34. See Oregon's Death with Dignity Act, Oregon Rev. Stat. &#167;&#167;
127.800-127.995 (1995); Michigan's Model Statue Supporting Aid-in Dying,
appended to the Final Report of the Michigan Commission on Death and Dying
(1994); New York, Senate Bill No. 7986 (May 3, 1994) entitled &quot;Death With
Dignity,&quot; sponsored by New York State Senators Galiber, Leichter,
Markowitz, Smith and Waldon; Washington Senate Bill 5596 (Jan. 27, 1995)
entitled &quot;Terminally Ill Patient Act of 1995.&quot; Of course, the
constitutionality of particular restrictions is not before the Court since the
two state statutes in this case are both total bans.</P>
<P>35. Petitioners point further to the difficulty in distinguishing between a
physician's prescription of lethal medication to be self-administered by a
terminally ill patient and a physician's administration of that medication where
the terminally ill individual is unable to do so. Amici acknowledge that some
terminally ill patients who voluntarily request a hastened and gentle death may,
due to the devastating progress of their disease, be unable physically to ingest
medication without assistance. The question whether the physician's
administration of the medication could be constitutionally prohibited in such a
case is not presently before the Court. Amici, however, agree with the Ninth
Circuit that the crucial question is whether the request is thoughtful and
voluntary and, if so, the terminally ill patient who is physically unable to
administer the medication that would release him from his agonies cannot,
consistent with the Constitution, be prevented from obtaining the necessary aid.
See Compassion, 79 F.3d at 831-32. The fact that the right urged here may one
day properly be expanded to include such a case is no cause for alarm. It bears
no relation to the entirely speculative, nightmare scenarios painted by certain
amici supporting petitioners: that the right urged here -- a right of the
individual against the state for release from the unendurable ravages of
terminal disease -- somehow will metamorphosize into the ability of society to
act against the individual and do away with those whose lives are no longer
valued. Such dark fantasies should be disregarded.</P>
<P>36. See Quill, 80 F.3d at 729 (citing Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 296-97 (Scalia,
J., concurring)).</P>
<P>37. The Second Circuit's discussion on this point bears repeating:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[T]he writing of a prescription to hasten death, after consultation with a
patient, involves a far less active role for the physician than is required in
bringing about death through asphyxiation, starvation and/or dehydration.
Withdrawal of life support requires physicians or those acting at their
direction physically to remove equipment and, often, to administer palliative
drugs which may themselves contribute to death. The ending of life by these
means is nothing more nor less than assisted suicide.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Quill, 80 F.3d at 729.</P>
<P>38. Where a patient requests aid in dying quickly, the patient endangers the
delicate excuse of the &quot;double effect&quot; and a doctor who otherwise
might have employed a morphine drip may demur, afraid of running afoul of the
criminal law. See Thomas A. Preston, Killing Pain, Ending Life, N.Y. Times, Nov.
1, 1994, at A27.</P>
<P>39. Interestingly, the United States suggests that this Court need not be
especially vigilant in reviewing the state's line drawing here because &quot;[t]erminal
illness does not single out any discrete or insular minority; it potentially
affects all Americans.&quot; Govt. Br. in Glucksberg at 31-32. On this basis,
the United States asserts that &quot;there is every reason to believe that the
state legislatures will address the competing interests in an impartial and
unbiased way,&quot; and also contends that &quot;there is no indication that the
political processes are malfunctioning.&quot; Id. at 31 &amp; n.3. This argument
fails, of course, if a fundamental liberty interest is at stake because, in that
circumstance, heightened scrutiny is required regardless of whether a discrete
and insular majority is involved.</P>
<P>Furthermore, as a matter of practice, it is difficult to put faith in the
political processes which have traditionally not acted to safeguard the right of
the terminally ill to escape pain through a gentle, hastened death while
prosecutors, courts and juries have never meaningfully punished anyone for
helping the terminally ill exercise this right. See supra p. 7 &amp; nn.12-13.
This disjunction between the law on the books and the law in enforcement
bespeaks a malfunctioning of the political process.</P>

Constitution. Since its founding in 1920, the ACLU has participated in numerous
cases before this Court. Of particular note here, the ACLU appeared as counsel
in both Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 112 S. Ct.
2790 (1992), and Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept. of Health, 497 U.S. 261
(1990). The ACLU of Washington is a state affiliate of the ACLU and appeared as
amicus curiae before the Ninth Circuit in Compassion In Dying v. Washington.</P>
<P>The <B>National Gray Panthers Project Fund</B> is a civil liberties
advocacy project concerned with social justice for the aging. As advocates for
the aging, the Gray Panthers and their state affiliates of Washington and New
York join in this case, as a friend of the  court, to highlight the right of
individuals to make choices about the quality of their lives.</P>
<P><B>The Japanese American Citizens League (&quot;JACL&quot;)</B> is a
national civil rights organization founded in 1930, committed to strive to
secure justice and equal opportunities for all Americans of Japanese ancestry as
well as for all Americans, regardless of race, creed, color, national origin,
religion, sex, sexual orientation, or disability. The JACL supports legislative
initiatives that provide for the welfare of the broader community. The Pacific
Northwest District of JACL also joins in this amicus brief as a advocate for the
health care needs, as well as the death with dignity needs of its membership and
of the total community, upholding the individual's right to freedom of choice on
those matters that are essential to basic human dignity.</P>

defense of civil liberties is unconditional; it works for the right of
individuals to make personal decisions about their bodies free from unnecessary
government intrusion.  Accordingly, the group defends, among other things, the
right of terminally ill persons to choose the time and manner of their death.</P>
<P>The <B>Hemlock Society USA</B> was formed in 1980 to achieve the
legalization of physician aid in dying for terminally ill, mentally competent
adults.  It has 25,000 members in 80 chapters and community groups throughout
the country.  The New York State and Washington State affiliates joining the
national organization in supporting the right of dying persons to work with
their physicians so that the voluntary request for a hastened death may be part
of the continuum of care available to the terminally ill.</P>
<P>The <B>Euthanasia Research &amp; Guidance Organization (&quot;ERGO!&quot;)</B>,
a non-profit educational corporation organized under the laws of the State or
Oregon, was founded in 1993 to lay the groundwork for the compassionate and just
implementation of a mentally competent terminally ill adult's decision to hasten
death when the law permits it in America.  ERGO promotes safeguards and
guidelines on legal, medical, and ethical issues so that physician aid in dying
will be put into careful practice.  Its goal is to educate and prepare
individuals and institutions, ensuring a smooth transition when the change in

<TITLE>ACLU Press Release -  12/03/96 -- Hawaii Judge OK's Marriage for Three
Lesbian and Gay Couples</TITLE></HEAD>

<H2>Hawaii Judge OK's Marriage for Three Lesbian and Gay Couples</H2>
</CENTER>
<P> <B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>Tuesday, December 3, 1996</B></P>
<P>HONOLULU -- In a closely watched lesbian and gay civil rights case that has
spurred legislative action in more than 30 states and Congress, a Hawaii judge
today paved the way for three lesbian and gay couples to marry, ruling that the
state's denial of marriage licenses violates Hawaii's Constitution. </P>
<P>Circuit Judge Kevin S. C. Chang wrote in his <A HREF="/court/baehr.html">46
page ruling</A> that the state had &quot;failed to present sufficient credible
evidence . . . that the public interest in the well-being of children and
families, or the optimal development of children would be adversely affected by
same-sex marriages.&quot;</P>
<P>The American Civil Liberties Union said the ruling is a historic step toward
giving lesbians and gay men in committed relationships the equal benefits and
responsibilities currently enjoyed by other couples.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;This decision is the first major step toward recognizing that it's
fundamentally unfair to exclude lesbians and gay men from marriage,&quot; said
Matt Coles, director of the ACLU's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project.  &quot;Since
we insist that couples marry to protect their most important relationship -- or
risk losing their homes, inheritances, even contact with their partners during
medical emergencies -- it is simply wrong to deny lesbians and gay couples the
basic right to marry.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;This is a ruling that respects the rights of all people in Hawaii to
marry the person they love,&quot; Coles added.  &quot;As this court recognized,
the freedom to marry is a basic human right that belongs to each individual --
not the state.  The government should not be in the position of arranging our
marriages.  Marriage is a personal decision that belongs to the two consenting
adults in a relationship.&quot; </P>
<P>According to Coles, the case has sparked national interest because marriages
performed in one state are typically recognized by the other 49, or have been
since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down miscegenation laws in 1967.  During the
previous state legislative session, bills barring same-sex marriages were
introduced in some 35 states.  To date, 20 states rejected the anti-gay
marriages bills, while 16 states passed such measures.</P>
<P>Congress and the President also entered the fray during the 104th term,
approving the so-called &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot; designed to exclude
lesbian and gay couples under federal programs and allow states to deny
recognition of same-sex marriages performed in other states.  The ACLU, which
says the law is unconstitutional, has vowed to ultimately challenge it in court.
</P>
<P>But today's ruling, Coles said, is unlikely to have any immediate impact
outside Hawaii.  &quot;People shouldn't plan on hopping over to Honolulu for the
honeymoon just yet,&quot; he advised.  &quot;The state is almost sure to appeal
the case to the Hawaii Supreme Court, and this decision is likely to be stayed
while the appeal goes forward.&quot;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;That means lesbians and gay men won't be able to marry unless and
until the state's highest court makes a final decision affirming this ruling,&quot;
Coles continued.  &quot;The question of whether other states will recognize
Hawaii gay marriages won't arise until then either.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Today's ruling came in response to a case brought in 1991 by two lesbian
couples and one gay male couple after they were denied their applications for
marriage licenses.  </P>
<P>Their case eventually led to a landmark decision by the Hawaii Supreme
Court, which ruled in May 1993 that the state's refusal to issue those licenses
appeared to violate the equal protection guarantee of the Hawaii Constitution. 
The court reasoned that since the plaintiffs would have been allowed to marry
people of the opposite sex, the state's bias against same-sex couples may amount
to unconstitutional discrimination based on sex.</P>
<P>The Hawaii Supreme Court then returned the case to the trial court to
determine whether the state could show a &quot;compelling&quot; reason for
denying the three couples their marriage licenses.   After presiding over eight
days of testimony in September, Chang today concluded that the interests offered
by the state failed to justify the discrimination.</P>
<P>&quot;The state of Hawaii failed to put forth any compelling reason to
persuade the judge not to grant marriage licenses to these three lesbian and gay
couples,&quot; said Vanessa Chong, executive director of the ACLU of Hawaii.  &quot;Absent
any convincing  argument, Judge Chang correctly concluded that lesbian and gay
couples should be given the same freedom to marry that other people in Hawaii
are granted.&quot; </P>
<P>Coles offered a historical outlook on today's ruling: &quot;At one time,
people of different races and people who had been previously married were denied
the right to marry in most of America.  In time, we recognized as a society that
those laws, which were defended as simply preserving 'traditional marriage,'
were unfair.  Laws that don't allow lesbians and gay men to marry are just as
unfair.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<TITLE>ACLU Press Release -  11/14/96 -- ACLU MOVES TO HAVE MARYLAND STATE
POLICE HELD IN CONTEMPT</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">

<CENTER>
<H2>ACLU MOVES TO HAVE MARYLAND STATE POLICE HELD IN CONTEMPT</H2>
</CENTER>
<P> <B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     [<A HREF="#attach">related documents</A>]<BR>Thursday,
November 14, 1996</B></P>
<P>The American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland is asking a federal district
court in Baltimore to hold the Maryland State Police agency in contempt of court
and to impose a $250,000 &quot;conditional civil contempt monetary penalty,&quot;
based upon a showing that state police are violating a 1995 court decree by
continuing a pattern of race discrimination in drug interdiction activities
carried out along the Interstate 95 corridor.  The ACLU motion also seeks
identification by name, address and telephone number of all motorists detained
on I-95 since the start of 1995; extension by one year of court monitoring in
the case; production of MSP investigative and disciplinary files; a year's
extension on MSP record-keeping requirements and expansion of record keeping to
include all motorist stops, in addition to detentions and searches.    </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;This is not an action we relish, and not one we take lightly,&quot;
said ACLU Executive Director Susan Goering.  &quot;But the evidence is
disturbing, and undeniable.  A situation this serious demands serious action.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The court decree alleged to be violated was entered in settlement of a 1993
class-action lawsuit brought by the ACLU on behalf of Robert L. Wilkins and his
family.  Wilkins, an African-American attorney who was stopped, detained, and
searched by state police for no apparent reason, claimed he and his family had
been targeted on the basis of a &quot;racial profile&quot; used by police in
drug interdiction efforts.  MSP steadfastly denied the allegation, but
ultimately agreed to settle the case and to maintain computer records of
motorist searches so as to permit monitoring for any patterns of discrimination.
 Now, relying on computer records generated under the <I>Wilkins</I>
settlement, the ACLU asserts that state police stop and search African-American
and other minority motorists travelling I-95 in numbers grossly disproportionate
to their numbers among motorists.  </P>
<P>Evidence compiled and included in the ACLU papers, covering the period from
January 1995 through September 1996, shows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Three of every four I-95 motorists detained and searched by state police
are black, even though blacks make up only 17.5% of motorists committing traffic
violations on I-95;</LI>
<LI>Only one in every five I-95 motorists detained and searched by state police
is white, even though three-quarters of I-95 motorists committing traffic
violations are white;</LI>
<LI>Troopers patrolling Interstate 95 detain and search black motorists at more
than twice the rate as troopers patrolling other Maryland roadways;</LI>
<LI>More than 70 percent of motorist searches conducted by MSP are fruitless;</LI>
<LI>Statewide, black and white motorists are found with drugs at equal rates:
28.4% of    blacks searched were found with drugs, as compared to 28.8% of
whites searched. </LI></UL>
<P>Temple University Professor John Lamberth, who provided the ACLU with expert
analysis in support of the motion, said in his written report that by
statistical measures the data compiled by the ACLU is so &quot;wildly
significant&quot; that its statistical significance &quot;is literally off the
charts.&quot;  Although MSP officials previously have claimed the racial skewing
in the search numbers is mere &quot;coincidence,&quot; Lamberth and the ACLU
strongly dispute that.  According to Lamberth's report, the &quot;probability
that black drivers are subjected to searches at so high a rate by <I>chance</I>
is less than one in one quintillion.&quot;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The contention that this egregious pattern of race discrimination is
all just a big coincidence insults the intelligence of African Americans and of
all Americans,&quot;  said plaintiff Robert Wilkins, a Harvard Law School
graduate who works as a public defender with the Public Defender Service of the
District of Columbia.  &quot;It is time for Maryland State Police to take a
long, hard look at the way they treat black citizens.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Lawyers representing Mr. Wilkins and the ACLU in the case are William J.
Mertens and Jonathan P. Guy, of the Washington, D.C. law firm Swidler &amp;
Berlin, and ACLU staff counsel Deborah A. Jeon.</P>

<H2>ACLU Asks Court to Affirm Landmark Decision Barring Internet Censorship</H2>
</CENTER>
<P> <B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>Thursday, October 31, 1996<BR><A
HREF="#links">Links to other case materials</A></B></P>
<P>WASHINGTON--The American Civil Liberties Union today filed a motion asking
the Supreme Court to affirm a lower court decision rejecting as unconstitutional
government censorship of the Internet.  </P>
<P>The ACLU's brief, filed today in answer to the government's appeal of the
district court ruling, asks the High Court to issue a &quot;summary affirmance&quot;
--  a finding that the lower court's decision was constitutionally correct and
therefore does not merit further examination.  </P>
<P>&quot;We filed for summary affirmance because we believe the decision is so
clearly correct that such action is warranted,&quot; said Steven R. Shapiro,
Legal Director of the ACLU.  </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;We recognize, however, that summary affirmance is rare when the
constitutionality of a federal statute is called into question,&quot; Shapiro
continued.  &quot;And if the Supreme Court grants review, we are prepared to
vigorously defend the lower court decision.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The so-called Communications Decency Act makes it a crime, punishable by up
to two years in jail and/or a $250,000 fine, for anyone to engage in speech that
is &quot;indecent' or &quot;patently offensive&quot; on computer networks if the
speech can be viewed by a minor.    The ACLU argued -- and a three-judge panel
agreed -- that because there is no way to shield minors alone from online &quot;indecency,&quot;
the CDA amounts to a criminal ban on constitutionally protected communication
among adults.  </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The stakes in this case are undeniably high,&quot; said Christopher
Hansen, the ACLU lawyer who argued the case before the three-judge court in
Philadelphia.  &quot;Whatever the Supreme Court decides will determine the
government's ability to regulate a technology that will undoubtedly serve as the
basis for global communication into the 21st century.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A second brief, filed today by <I>Reno v. ACLU </I> co-plaintiffs <I>American
Library Association et al</I>., makes similar constitutional arguments in favor
of upholding the lower court's decision.  However, while acknowledging that a
request for summary affirmance would be appropriate, the brief states that the
ALA will not oppose a full review by the Court. </P>
<P>&quot;Whatever the Court decides, we will continue to work together with our
colleagues to ensure the best possible outcome for free speech principles,&quot;
said the ACLU's Hansen.</P>
<P>In the brief filed today, the ACLU presents two main arguments for upholding
the trial court's decision: </P>
<P>I.   Given the court's extensive and largely undisputed findings regarding
the nature of cyberspace, the decision is &quot;plainly correct.&quot;</P>
<P>The decision issued in June by the three-judge court contained over 400
separate &quot;findings of fact&quot; (now the official record of the case

before the Court ) about the nature of communication and content in the
cyberspace medium.  Notably, the ACLU's brief points out, 334 of the 409
separate fact- findings adopted by the trial court were derived from
stipulations (mutual agreements as to facts) submitted by the plaintiffs and
defendants.  Thus the majority of the facts necessary to the court's ruling were
not disputed by the government.</P>
<P>Among the court's findings: </P>
<UL>
<LI> the CDA &quot;will almost certainly fail to accomplish the government's
interest in shielding children from pornography on the Internet,&quot; in part
because &quot;nearly half of Internet communications originate outside the
United States.&quot;
</LI>
<LI> the government failed to meet its burden of establishing a compelling
interest in blocking all minors' access to all online communications. 
</LI>
<LI> the record demonstrates numerous alternative means of accomplishing the
government's purpose more effectively and less restrictively than an outright
criminal ban, through parental use of blocking software and the development of
other technology that allows for voluntary screening. 
</LI></UL>
<P>II. The government fails to raise any legitimate argument against summary
affirmance.</P>
<P>In an attempt to convince the Court to review <I>Reno v. ACLU</I>, the
government presents an entirely new  argument in its jurisdictional statement,
not raised in the trial court: that the CDA would apply only to those who &quot;knowingly&quot;
transmit &quot;indecent&quot; communications to a minor.  </P>
<P>But since any online user &quot;knows&quot; that minors have access to the
vast public areas of cyberspace, the ACLU brief argues, all Internet users would
risk prosecution simply by speaking in certain areas such as a news group or
chat room. </P>
<P>In addition, the ACLU brief states, both plaintiff and defendant's arguments
in the lower court assumed that the CDA applied to all online communications
that &quot;might&quot; be viewed by a minor (in contrast to sexually oriented
messages intentionally sent to minors).   Based on that assumption, the
government asserted that the use of a credit card or other means to verify the
age of online users would protect legitimate speakers from prosecution.  The
district court rejected this &quot;safe harbor&quot; defense as economically and
technologically impracticable.</P>
<P>&quot;The government's disappointment with the trial court's decision does
not permit it to reinterpret the statute on appeal and introduce a new argument,&quot;
said Ann Beeson, a member of the <I>Reno v. ACLU</I> legal team.  &quot;If
Congress meant for the CDA to apply only to persons who intentionally send
'indecent' communications  to children, then it is ludicrous for the government

<H2>ACLU Background Briefing<BR><I>Reno v. ACLU</I>: The Road to the Supreme
Court</H2>
</CENTER>
<P> <B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>Thursday, October 31, 1996</B></P>
<P>Following a landmark victory in June for free speech rights in cyberspace,
<I>ACLU v. Reno</I> now awaits Supreme Court action.   </P>
<P><I> ACLU v. Reno </I>(or <I>Reno v. ACLU</I> as the case will now be known
in the Supreme Court) represents the first legal challenge to censorship
provisions of the Communications Decency Act (CDA). </P>
<P>Last spring, a federal court in Philadelphia issued a preliminary injunction
barring the government from enforcing the challenged provisions of the CDA.  The
preliminary injunction opinion makes clear that the lower court agreed with the
ACLU's view that the CDA's ill-conceived effort to censor speech in the unique
medium of cyberspace violates the First Amendment.</P>
<P>The government's decision to appeal the preliminary injunction ruling
presents the Supreme Court with its first opportunity to consider how
traditional free speech principles should be applied to the Internet.  The
Supreme Court's resolution of that question will be critically important to the
future of what one judge described as &quot;the most participatory form of mass
speech yet developed.&quot;</P>
<P>The case has been on an accelerated track from the beginning.  Anticipating
legal challenges and desiring a speedy resolution, Congress wrote into the CDA
an expedited path to the Supreme Court's door.  Because of the special review
provisions, the procedural route to the Supreme Court is somewhat different than
usual.  Following is a &quot;road map&quot; identifying the key players and

describing the process that will unfold as the case makes it way to an ultimate
resolution.</P>
<H2>The Challenge </H2>
<P>The ACLU filed its legal challenge to the CDA on February 8, 1996, the day
it was signed into law by President Clinton.   </P>
<P>The CDA makes it a crime, punishable by up to two years in jail and/or a
$250,000 fine, for anyone to engage in speech that is &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently
offensive&quot; on computer networks if the speech can be viewed by a minor. 
</P>
<P>The ACLU argued in the lower court that the censorship provisions are
unconstitutional becausethey would criminalize expression that is protected by
the First Amendment and because the terms &quot;indecency&quot; and &quot;patently
offensive&quot; are unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. </P>
<P>Several weeks later, a second challenge was filed by nearly 30 plaintiffs,
including the American Library Association. That suit, known as <I>ALA v. DOJ</I>,
was subsequently consolidated with <I>Reno v. ACLU</I>.  Although the two cases
are consolidated and the legal teams are working together, each plaintiff group
has filed separate briefs throughout the case and will continue to do so.</P>
<P>A three-judge panel was appointed to hear the motion for preliminary
injunction, and five days of hearings were scheduled during March and April. 
The panel consisted of Chief Judge Dolores K. Sloviter, Judge Stewart Dalzell,
and Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter.</P>
<P>The preliminary injunction proceedings included five days of live testimony,
written testimony, documentary evidence, and detailed stipulations about the
nature of the online medium. The decision issued by the District Court contained
over 400 separate findings of fact that included  information about the nature
of communication and content in the cyberspace medium. </P>
<H2>The Government's Appeal</H2>
<P>In its appeal, or  Jurisdictional Statement, filed on September 29, the
government must  convince the Court to accept the case for review because of the
substantial constitutional questions involved. </P>
<P>This type of appeal is distinct from a petition for a <I>writ  of
certiorari</I>, the most common method by which the Court is asked to review a
lower court decision.  Because the CDA itself provides for a right of direct
appeal to the Supreme Court, the more common <I>&quot;cert&quot;</I> petition
is not applicable here -- hence the Court will not &quot;grant&quot; or &quot;deny&quot;
<I>cert.</I></P>
<P>In cases of direct appeal, the Supreme Court has three options:  it may
summarily affirm, it may summarily reverse, or it may note probable jurisdiction
and schedule the case for oral argument. </P>
<P><I>Summary affirmance </I>means that the Court has concluded that, based on
the constitutional questions reached in the lower court decision, no further
review is necessary. </P>
<P><I>Summary reversal</I> means that the Court has reviewed the respective
briefs and agrees with a motion that the lower court decision should be
reversed.  (<I>Note</I>: the government has not filed a motion for summary
reversal in this case.)</P>
<P><I>Noting probable jurisdiction</I> means that the Court will schedule the
case for full briefing and oral argument.</P>
<P>The government had 30 days after issuance of the preliminary injunction on
June 11th to file a Notice of Appeal with the District Court.  The government
then had 60 days to file a Jurisdictional Statement with the Supreme Court.  At
the end of that period, government lawyers asked for, and were granted, an
extension of 30 days (to September 29) to file the Jurisdictional Statement.  
</P>
<H2>Plaintiffs' Briefs</H2>
<P>The ACLU and ALA legal teams today filed their responses to the government's
Jurisdictional Statement.  </P>
<P>The ACLU has filed for a <I>motion for summary affirmance</I>, which is a
way of asking the Supreme Court to uphold the preliminary injunction without the
need for any further proceedings.  More specifically, the ACLU will assert that
the factual findings in the lower court decision are so extensive, and its legal
conclusions are so indisputable under clearly established constitutional
principles, that further argument is unnecessary. </P>
<P>According to the ACLU's brief, &quot;summary affirmance is particularly
appropriate at this stage of the proceedings because the three-judge court's
conclusions were driven by extensive, detailed, and largely undisputed factual
findings regarding the technology, sociology and economics of cyberspace.&quot;</P>
<P>The ACLU brief acknowledges that summary affirmance is unusual when a lower
court has enjoined enforcement of a federal statute.  Nevertheless, the brief
argues, it is fully warranted in this case because the government's failure to
challenge the lower court's factual findings and method of constitutional
analysis leaves the Supreme Court without any substantial constitutional issues
to resolve.</P>
<P>Summary affirmance should not be viewed as analogous to denial of  <I>certiorari</I>:
a <I>cert </I>denial says nothing, either positive or negative, about the case.

 In contrast, summary affirmance indicates that the Court has reviewed the facts
and has decided to approve the lower court decision.  The distinction is
important because of the message it sends regarding the constitutional questions
in the case.   </P>
<P>The ALA brief similarly argues that the lower court's ruling is clearly
correct and could be summarily affirmed.  However, recognizing that summary
affirmance is rare in these circumstances, the ALA plaintiffs have taken the
position that they will not oppose full review by the Supreme Court.  </P>
<P>All briefs at this preliminary stage are limited to 30 pages.</P>
<H2>The High Court's Decision: Review or Summary Affirmance?</H2>
<P>After the ACLU and ALA briefs are submitted on October 31, the Court will
consider these documents, along with the government's Jurisdictional Statement 
and the substantial factual record in the case.  A decision about whether to
review or affirm could be issued as early as mid-November, although December is
more likely.  Depending on the Court's action, the case may then proceed as
follows:</P>
<P>I. Summary Affirmance</P>
<P>If the Court grants summary affirmance of the lower court decision, Supreme
Court review is effectively ended and no further argument or briefing will take
place.  A grant of summary affirmance would not only leave the lower court's
preliminary injunction in place, it would legally uphold it.  The case would
then be sent back to the trial court for further proceedings concerning a
permanent injunction.</P>
<P>In this eventuality, the ACLU would ask the same three-judge panel in
Philadelphia to issue a permanent injunction against the censorship law on the
basis of the Supreme Court's affirmance of the preliminary injunction.  The
District Court may then hold further hearings before granting a final
injunction.  Depending on whether the District Court grants or denies the
permanent injunction, either the plaintiffs or the government could appeal the
court's decision.  If so, the case would return to the Supreme Court.</P>
<P>II. Supreme Court Review </P>
<P>If the Court accepts <I>Reno v. ACLU</I> for full review, the Justices will
set a briefing schedule, naming due dates for each of the briefs required by
plaintiffs and defendants and appointing a day for oral argument.  All of these
dates will be scheduled upon acceptance of the case for full review.</P>
<P>As appellants in <I>Reno v. ACLU</I>, government lawyers will be required
to submit the first brief.  The ACLU and ALA teams will then submit their
second, or  <I>answering,</I> briefs.  A third and final brief, the<I> reply</I>
brief, is due from the government in response.  Oral argument will then take
place on the appointed day.</P>
<P>Under the normal briefing schedule, the government's first brief would due
45 days after probable jurisdiction was noted and the case accepted for full
review.  Plaintiffs' briefs would then be due 30 days after the government's
brief was filed.  It is likely that oral argument would take place some time in
late winter or early spring.</P>
<H2>The Plaintiffs</H2>
<P>The 20 <I>ACLU v. Reno</I> plaintiffs represent a wide variety of online
users, content providers, and Internet service providers, including Human Rights
Watch, Planned Parenthood, EFF and EPIC (national cyberspace rights groups),
Critical Path AIDS Project, Wildcat Press (a gay and lesbian publisher) and the
ACLU itself (see attached for a complete list). <I> </I></P>
<P><I> ALA v. DOJ</I> plaintiffs comprise nearly 30 organizations, including
the American Library Association, Internet companies, public interest groups,
commercial and non-commercial content providers, and more than 50,000 individual
Internet users. </P>
<P>Because the government has appealed <I>Reno v. ACLU</I>, they are now
referred to as the <I>appellant</I> and the plaintiffs are now called the <I>appellees</I>.
</P>
<H2>The Defendants</H2>

<P>The ACLU and ALA challenges collectively name as defendants Attorney General
Janet Reno and the United States Department of Justice, as the respective
individual and agency responsible for investigating and prosecuting violations
of the law.  </P>
<H2>Other Legal Challenges</H2>
<P>A third challenge to the CDA was filed in federal district court in New York
in April of this year.  That case, <I>Shea v. Reno</I>, was brought on behalf
of Joseph Shea, editor of an on-line newspaper, The American Reporter.  Shea's
lawyers argued that the law would subject his newspaper to constraints that
print publications do not face and that this posed a threat to the freedom of
the press.  </P>
<P>Following the same procedures as in the Philadelphia case, a three-judge
panel was appointed to hear argument, consisting of Chief Judge Jose A. Cabranes
of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and Judge Leonard B. Sand
and Judge Denise L. Cote of Federal District Court in Manhattan.  </P>
<P>On July 29 of this year, the New York judges joined their Philadelphia
colleagues in unanimously ruling Internet censorship unconstitutional. </P>
<P><I> </I>On October 14, lawyers for the government filed a Jurisdictional
Statement asking the Supreme Court to reserve judgment on the <I>Shea</I> case
until <I>Reno v. ACLU</I> is resolved, either through review or summary
affirmance.  The <I>Shea</I> plaintiffs now have until mid-November to file a
reply brief.  It is not known at this time what legal strategy the <I>Shea </I>lawyers
will pursue.</P>
<H2>The ACLU Legal Team </H2>
<P>Lawyers for the ACLU are Christopher Hansen, Ann Beeson and Marjorie Heins
of the national office; Steven R. Shapiro, the ACLU's national Legal Director;
and Stefan Presser, Legal Director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania.  </P>

<TITLE>ACLU Press Release -  10/16/96 -- ACLU Sues Over CO Policy Of
Confiscating 'Suspicious' Immigration Documents</TITLE></HEAD>

<H2>ACLU Sues Over CO Policy Of Confiscating 'Suspicious' Immigration Documents</H2>
</CENTER>
<P> <B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>Wednesday, October 16, 1996</B></P>
<P>DENVER -- The American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado filed suit today to
challenge a policy of the Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles that instructs
low-level employees to confiscate immigration documents that they suspect are
fraudulent.</P>
<P>The ACLU sued on behalf of Maria Juventina Flores, a legal permanent
resident who immigrated from El Salvador.  She showed her green card when she
applied for a Colorado state identification card for which she was eligible. A
clerk at the Glenwood Springs office of the Motor Vehicle Division believed the
green card was &quot;suspicious&quot; and summarily confiscated it.</P>
<P>In later correspondence with the ACLU, DMV admitted that the confiscated
green card was genuine. The agency cannot return the card, however, because it
has been lost.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The DMV admits our client's green card was genuine, but it still
defends its actions,&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>said Mark Silverstein, ACLU of Colorado Legal Director.  &quot;In a letter
to our client, the DMV explained that 'it is our policy to confiscate documents
that we suspect are fraudulent.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This policy is a recipe for unfair discrimination against thousands of
law-abiding immigrants who, like our client, are living in this state with the
knowledge, consent, and permission of the United States government,&quot;
Silverstein said.  &quot;There is no state or federal law that authorizes
Colorado employees to confiscate immigration documents that are issued by the
federal government.  This is especially true when there is no warrant  and the
employees are acting merely on suspicion.</P>
<P>&quot;The Fourth Amendment forbids unreasonable searches and seizures.  Even
a police officer cannot seize papers or property on the basis of mere suspicion,&quot;
Silverstein continued. &quot;The employees in the Motor Vehicle Division are not
peace officers.  Nor are they the INS. They have no special training that
enables them to determine whether an immigration document is genuine.</P>
<P>&quot;Our client was humiliated and terrified for no good reason,&quot;
Silverstein said.  &quot;She felt powerless and helpless.  She tried to explain
that she could not leave without her green card, but the clerk at the DMV
threatened to have her arrested for trespass.&quot;</P>
<P>According to the ACLU, the clerk gave Ms. Flores a telephone number and told
her to call in two weeks if she wanted to know the status and whereabouts of the
confiscated card. All Ms. Flores ever reached was a recorded message.</P>
<P>Ms. Flores was forced to apply for a replacement green card, a bureaucratic
process that takes 7 to 8 months.  During that time, she was in violation of a
federal criminal statute that requires legal permanent residents to carry their
green cards at all times.</P>
<P>According to Silverstein, Ms. Flores had been planning to travel to El
Salvador to visit her mother, who was very sick.  Ms. Flores had to abandon
those plans, however, because she feared that without her green card, she would
not be able to return to the United States.</P>
<P>&quot;If state employees will be evaluating whether immigration documents
are genuine, the government must be sure they are thoroughly trained and
operating under carefully-drafted guidelines,&quot; Silverstein said.  &quot;This
is especially important as more and more government services are becoming

available only upon proof of immigration status.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;This case demonstrates how easy it is for an untrained state employee
to come to the wrong conclusion,&quot; Silverstein continued.  &quot;Confiscating
green cards is an unjustifiable overreaction.  Colorado should abandon this
unwise, unnecessary, and poorly-drafted policy before more innocent law-abiding
immigrants become victims.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The lawsuit, filed in state district court in Denver, alleges that the
confiscation violated the Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable
seizures as well as the right to due process of law.  It seeks compensation for
Ms. Flores and a declaration that the confiscation policy is unconstitutional.</P>
<P>John Webb of Holme, Roberts &amp; Owen is representing Ms. Flores as an ACLU
cooperating attorney.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>U.S. Judge Bars INS From Denying Hearings to Immigrants</H2>
</CENTER>
<P> <B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>Wednesday, October 9, 1996</B></P>
<P>SEATTLE, Wash. -- In a ruling that affects thousands of immigrants
nationwide who are facing deportation, a federal district court in Seattle
issued a permanent injunction last week against the Immigration and
Naturalization Service for failing to inform individuals of their right to a
hearing prior to deportation.</P>
<P>&quot;This decision reaffirms the fundamental, but often neglected principle
that all persons -- regardles of immigration status -- are protected by the Due
Process Clause, and must be given a fair opportunity to contest accusations
against them,&quot; said Lee Gelernt, a staff attorney with the ACLU's National
Immigrants' Rights Project.</P>
<P>U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour, a Reagan appointee, said that the
INS had violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process clause by failing to properly
inform individuals charged with using false documents that they have a right to
request a hearing in order to rebut those charges. </P>
<P>The judge found that the INS had been using forms and procedures that were &quot;highly
technical,&quot; &quot;legalistic,&quot; and &quot;confusing,&quot; and did not &quot;adequately
apprise [immigrants] of their rights to hearings.&quot;  The judge also found
that since many of the charged individuals were Spanish-speaking, it was &quot;simply
unacceptable&quot; for the INS not to have provided forms in a language other
than English.</P>
<P>&quot;As a result of the INS's misleading and confusing practices, thousands
of non-citizens lost their right to a hearing, which automatically subjected
them to permanent deportation,&quot; Gelernt added.</P>
<P>The ACLU said the ruling should come as welcome relief to many immigrants
who were facing deportation, even though many have long ties to this country, or
are married to U.S. citizens, or have children who are U.S. citizens.</P>
<P>The ruling came in response to a class action lawsuit brought by the ACLU,
the National Immigration Law Center, and others in 1994, after Congress enacted
legislation designed to curb the use of fraudulent documents by immigrants. 
Throughout the litigation, the INS had argued that individuals who had forfeited
their right to a hearing had done so knowingly and voluntarily, a claim the
judge soundly rejected.</P>
<P>The injunction permanently enjoins the INS from continuing its misleading
practices, and requires the agency to provide clear and accessible information
to non-citizens about their right to contest charges of document fraud. 
Individuals who have already been charged will now have the opportunity to
request a hearing.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

Restricting Free Speech in Cyberspace</TITLE></HEAD>

<H3>Joint News Release:<BR>AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION <BR> ELECTRONIC
FRONTIERS GEORGIA<BR>REP. MITCHELL KAYE</H3>
<H2>Groups Challenge Georgia Law Restricting Free Speech in Cyberspace</H2>
</CENTER>
<P> <B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>Tuesday, September 24, 1996</B></P>

<P>ATLANTA--The American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontiers Georgia,
Georgia State Representative Mitchell Kaye and others today filed  a lawsuit
seeking a preliminary injunction against a Georgia statute restricting free
speech in cyberspace.  </P>
<P>At a news conference here, the groups said that the law is
unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because it bars online users from using
pseudonyms or communicating anonymously over the Internet.  The Act also
unconstitutionally restricts the use of links on the World Wide Web, which allow
users to connect to other sites.  </P>
<P>&quot;Fundamental civil liberties are as important in cyberspace as they are
in traditional contexts,&quot; said Ann Beeson, an ACLU national staff attorney
specializing in cyber-rights.  &quot;The right to speak and publish using a
virtual ?nom de plume' has its roots in a long tradition dating back to the very
founding of democracy in this country.&quot;  </P>
<P>The lawsuit is the first such challenge to state cybercensorship laws, the
ACLU said.  The ACLU said it has been monitoring state regulation of the
Internet and that currently,  over 20 states have considered such laws.</P>
<P>&quot;This is the first challenge that we know of to a state statute that
has tried to regulate national -- indeed, international -- communications,&quot;
said attorney Beeson.  &quot;The nature of the Internet makes state regulation
extremely problematical, because it forces everyone in the country to comply
with  one state's law.  If fifty states pass fifty contradictory laws, Internet
users will be virtually paralyzed for fear of violating one or more of those
laws.&quot;  </P>
<P>The complaint includes the assertion that the Commerce Clause of the United
States Constitution bars state regulation of the Internet because it is an
interstate communications medium.  </P>
<P>The suit was filed in U.S. Northern District Court of Georgia Federal Court,
challenging the state law on behalf of 14 plaintiffs (<I>note: see attached for
a list of plaintiffs</I>).  The lawsuit names Governor Zell Miller and state
Attorney General Michael Bowers as defendants.  </P>
<P>The Act was passed by the Georgia General Assembly and became effective on
July 1 of this year.    The law provides criminal sanctions of up to 12 months
in jail and/or up to a $1,000 fine for  violations. </P>
<P>Two of the plaintiffs, Electronic Frontiers Georgia and Georgia State
Representative  Mitchell Kaye (R-Marietta), lobbied against the law before its
passage, and solicited help from the ACLU and others to mount a legal challenge
after it was enacted.  </P>
<P>Electronic Frontiers Georgia (EFGA), a  Georgia-based cyber-liberties
organization, said that the group had supported a letter written by the
co-counsel in the case to state Attorney General Michael Bowers asking him to
clarify the law so that any debate about its meaning could be settled without
litigation.  </P>
<P>&quot;It's clear that no one would want to pass a law that says what this
law says, that simply linking from web site to web site or using a pseudonym is
illegal in Georgia and therefore throughout the Internet,&quot; said Robert
Costner of EFGA. </P>
<P>Rep. Kaye said he became involved in the battle against the law when members
of the House attacked him for maintaining a private web site that they said
might be mistaken for the &quot;official&quot; web site of the Georgia House of
Representatives.  The web site is maintained by the Conservative Policy Caucus
and contains prominent disclaimers that it is not an official government site. 
</P>
<P>&quot;House leaders felt threatened that their voting records were being
published along with political commentary that was not always flattering,&quot;
said Rep. Kaye, a member of the Conservative Policy Caucus.  &quot;Sunshine is
the best government disinfectant, and freedom of speech is a not a partisan
issue.&quot;</P>
<P>Teresa Nelson, executive director of the ACLU of Georgia, said that ACLU was
acting as a plaintiff as well as a litigant in the case in order to protect
visitors to its web site who may wish to access or discuss sensitive information
anonymously or using a pseudonym.   </P>
<P>&quot;These concerns were addressed in the letter to Attorney General
Michael Bowers, requesting a very narrow interpretation of the law. 
Unfortunately, he chose to ignore our request and we have been forced to
litigate to protect confidentiality on the Internet,&quot; Nelson said.</P>
<P>The national ACLU, serving as co-counsel in the Georgia case, is also a
litigant in <I><A HREF="/issues/cyber/trial.html">ACLU v. Reno</A></I>, its
challenge to Internet censorship provisions of the federal Communications
Decency Act. </P>
<P>In June of this year, a federal three-judge panel in Philadelphia granted an
injunction against the CDA, saying that, &quot;as the most participatory form of
mass speech yet developed, the Internet deserves the highest protection from
governmental intrusion.&quot;    The government has appealed that ruling and the
case is now on its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.</P>
<H2>The Complaint</H2>
<P>According to the complaint, the law makes it a crime to use a name that &quot;falsely
identifies&quot; a speaker on the Internet, without distinguishing whether the
person communicating had any intent to deceive or defraud or simply wanted to
keep his or her identity unknown.   </P>
<P>&quot;In some cases, anonymity is a necessary security measure,&quot; said
ACLU attorney Beeson.  &quot;The personal safety of human rights dissidents,
domestic abuse victims, and whistle-blowers would be compromised if they could
not communicate anonymously.&quot;  </P>
<P>Use of pseudonyms or anonymous identities also eliminates the potential for
discrimination and harassment according to gender or ethnicity, Beeson said, and
allows users to access controversial, embarrassing, or sensitive information
without revealing their identity.  She added that in some cases an online &quot;handle&quot;
or  pseudonym is assigned automatically by a commercial  online service such as
Prodigy or Compuserve.</P>
<P>The complaint also states that the law may prohibit web links by making it a
crime to publish information &quot;using&quot;  trade names, logos or other
symbols, again without regard to the nature of the use, and without any
definition of what constitutes &quot;use&quot; on a computer network.  </P>
<P>According to Robert Costner of Electronic Frontiers Georgia, many web sites
include links using trade names or logos as a means of providing information. 
</P>
<P>The EFGA site, he noted, provides a link to the BellSouth web page to assist
other Internet users in contacting BellSouth about a recent rate increase
request for ISDN telephone service.   Given the new technological context of the
Internet and the unique &quot;linking&quot; feature of web pages, Costner
explained, even this type of grass roots news advisory over the Internet could
now be illegal in Georgia.</P>
<H2>The Plaintiffs</H2>
<P>The 14 plaintiffs and organizations named in the suit all expressed concern
that the law would prohibit them -- at risk of jail or fines -- from using
pseudonyms to protect their privacy, communicate sensitive information and
defend themselves against harassment if their identities were known on the Net.
</P>
<P>For instance, the Atlanta Veterans Alliance, a Georgia-based organization
for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered veterans, said the law would risk
disclosure of the identity of AVA members who remain in active military service.
 Such disclosure would likely end their military careers.  </P>
<P>Another plaintiff, Josh Riley, an Atlanta-based realtor, operates two
Internet web sites that contain many links to other web sites of interest, often
using corporate logos and trademarks without specific permission.  His
award-winning web page, www.blackbaseball.com, contains information on the Negro
Baseball Leagues, including links to a site on an HBO movie, &quot;Soul of the
Game.&quot;  </P>
<P>Mr. Riley said he believes it would be impossible as a practical matter to
obtain permission for every link in his site, even though he is confident that
all of the companies and organizations would give permission if they were asked.</P>
<P>Certain plaintiffs also expressed concern that loss of anonymity would put
them and others at risk.  Plaintiff Community ConneXion, an Internet Service
Provider, specializes in providing the highest level of privacy to online users.
 The group recently developed a service known as the Anonymizer, which enables
any Internet user to browse and retrieve documents anonymously.   </P>
<P>Sameer Parekh, President of Community ConneXion, said that organizations and
individuals around the world use their services to protect them from oppressive
governments, invasive marketing databases and harassment online.   He said the
Georgia law may force the group to choose between shutting down its services or
risking prosecution.</P>
<P>Lawyers representing the 14 plaintiffs are: J. Scott McClain (as volunteer
attorney) of the Atlanta firm of  Bondurant, Mixson and Elmore; Ann Beeson and
Christopher Hansen of the national American Civil Liberties Union; and Gerald
Weber, staff attorney with the ACLU of Georgia.</P>

<H2>ACLU Blasts Senate Passage of Anti-Gay Marriage Ban; Calls Vote a &quot;Deplorable
Act&quot; and Vows Legal Challenge</H2>
</CENTER>
<P> <B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>Thursday, September 10, 1996</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>WASHINGTON -- The American Civil Liberties Union today denounced the Senate
for passing a bill designed to ban same-sex marriages, calling the vote a
deplorable act of hostility toward lesbian and gay Americans and pledging to
challenge the measure in court.      </P>
<P>In a separate vote today, the Senate also rejected 49-to-50 legislation to
outlaw employment discrimination  on the basis of sexual orientation.  Despite
its popular and broad support, the Employment Non-Discrimination  Act has been
stifled since its introduction in 1994, but the ACLU and other  gay rights
advocates -- emboldened by the narrowing margin  -- vowed to  press for the
measure again next term.      </P>
<P>&quot;The Senate turned its back on an important measure that would have
ensured fairness in the workplace for all Americans, straight and gay,&quot;
said Matt Coles, director of the ACLU's National Lesbian and Gay Rights Project.
  &quot;Instead, Americans will continue to have to fend for themselves in the
41 states where it is perfectly legal to fire someone simply because of their
sexual orientation.&quot;      </P>
<P>But in the day's major action, the Senate passed by a 85-to-14 vote the
so-called &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot; that would define marriage in
Federal law for the first time as a &quot;union between one man and one woman,&quot;
and allow states to ignore same-sex marriages performed in other states.  The
measure now goes to the President, who has already signaled his intention to
sign it.      </P>
<P>&quot;This vote is a deplorable act of hostility,&quot; Coles said. &quot;It
is one of the worst things any Congress has done to gay Americans. This vote
will go down in history as a low point in our nation's struggle against bigotry.&quot;
      &quot;This bill does nothing to  defend' marriage,&quot; added Coles.  &quot;Its
only purpose and effect is to bash lesbian and gay Americans, and to pick up a
couple of votes along the way.&quot;      </P>
<P>The ACLU said that the measure violates several constitutional guarantees,
and will look to bring a legal challenge if and when a couple has standing under
the law.  No state currently recognizes the right of lesbian and gay couples to
marry.                                       </P>
<P>The anti-gay marriage bill consists of two main parts.  The ACLU said the &quot;Federal&quot;
part of the bill, specifying the gender requirements of spouses, would have the
effect of treating all lesbian and gay couples as strangers under Federal laws
and programs, without any regard to the depth or intimacy of their relationship.
     The second provision of the bill would attempt to carve a &quot;gay
exception&quot; to the Constitution's full faith and credit clause by allowing
states to reject marriages performed in sister states.  That clause requires,
among other things, that the court judgements of one state will be honored by
other states.       </P>
<P>The ACLU, which submitted testimony before the House and Senate on the bill,
said that the provision, as it relates to court rulings on marriage, absolutely
violates the Constitution's full faith and credit clause, and is prepared to
make its arguments in court when the opportunity arises.  The entire bill, the
ACLU added, violates the Fifth Amendment's equal protection guarantee by
branding all same-sex marriages with second-class status.      </P>
<P>&quot;This bill is an unmistakable violation of the Constitution,&quot;
Coles said.  &quot;It ignores core principles of our Constitution, in addition
to creating an unworkable patchwork of government rules about who is and isn't
married.&quot;            </P>
<P>The issue of same-sex marriages have been raised in response to a Hawaii
Supreme Court ruling in May 1993 that strongly suggested that the state's equal
protection guarantee requires Hawaii to grant marriage licenses to lesbian and
gay couples.  Ironically, the case went back to trial today before a state
district judge, but a final decision is not expected until late 1997 or early
1998.        </P>
<P>While many states were already debating responses to the court's expected
ruling (fifteen states have passed laws banning recognition of those Hawaii
marriages), conservative extremists worked with lawmakers to introduce a Federal
bill that would, in effect, preempt those statewide battles and hand
conservatives a political wedge issue.      </P>
<P>The House passed the bill on July 12 with a 342-to-67 margin and sent it to
the Senate, where a bipartisan coalition sought to attach ENDA, the non-bias job
bill, as an amendment to the anti-gay marriage bill.  After pressure from the
coalition and gay rights advocates, Republican leaders agreed to allow the
non-bias measure on the Senate floor for a separate vote.       </P>
<P>Coles concluded: &quot;Congress has knowingly acted on the worst of
political calculations to single out lesbian and gay relationships for naked
mistreatment.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<TITLE>ACLU Press Release -  09/06/96 -- Non-Bias Job Law for Gays Scheduled

<H2>Non-Bias Job Law for Gays Scheduled for Free-Standing Senate Vote on
Tuesday</H2>
</CENTER>
<P> <B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>Friday, September 6, 1996</B></P>
<P>WASHINGTON -- In an unexpected turn of events, Senate leaders announced
Thursday evening that the Employment Non-Discrimination Law will come up for a
floor vote as a free-standing measure next Tuesday, Sept. 10.  The American
Civil Liberties Union, which has been lobbying support for the bill, called the
vote an important step towards ensuring fairness.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;We are on the verge of passing legislation that will finally ensure
fairness for all American workers, regardless of sexual orientation,&quot; said
Matt Coles, director of the ACLU's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project.  &quot;While
we have a lot of work ahead of us in the coming days, the momentum is clearly on
our side.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Majority Leader Trent Lott announced that the bill, known as ENDA, will come
to a  vote on the same day as the ill-named &quot;Defense of Marriage Act,&quot;
a measure that would deny Federal recognition of gay marriages, and allow states
to ignore such marriages performed in other states.  The ACLU and other gay
rights advocates have condemned the bill as unconstitutional, discriminatory,
and election-year gay-bashing.</P>
<P>ENDA, first introduced in 1994, would outlaw employment discrimination based
on sexual orientation, in much the same way that Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, religion and gender.</P>
<P>The ACLU said ENDA would offer basic civil rights protections for lesbian
and gay Americans, who are currently afforded such protections in only nine
states.  In the other 41 states, it is perfectly legal to fire someone solely
because of their sexual orientation.  The ACLU also answered critics of the
measure, who have sought to distort and exaggerate the bill's impact if it
became Federal law.</P>
<P>&quot;When Congress debated the first post-Civil War civil rights bill in
the 1860s, it was attacked as 'special rights',&quot; Coles said.  &quot;When
Congress took up the Civil Rights Act of 1964, opponents said it would destroy

American business and individual freedom of choice.&quot;  </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The truth is that both of those laws were about simple fairness, and
they have made this country a far better place,&quot; added Coles.  &quot;ENDA
is about fairness as well, and when it passes, it too will make this country a
better place.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>ACLU Marks Labor Day With Workplace Rights Video and Report</H2>
</CENTER>
<P> <B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>September 1, 1996</B></P>
<P>Redoubling its efforts to protect the rights of employees in the workplace,
the American Civil Liberties Union today launched its &quot;<A
HREF="/issues/worker/campaign.html">Campaign for Fairness in the Workplace</A>&quot;
with the release of a 12-minute video and a white paper report that documents

how employees are being increasingly spied upon and monitored at work.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The daily abuse of civil liberties in the workplace is a national
disgrace,&quot; said Lewis Maltby, director of the ACLU's Workplace Rights
Project.  &quot;Despite a dramatic increase in workplace surveillance, most
Americans aren't even aware that they are being monitored, let alone that there
are virtually no laws in place to protect them.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The ACLU plans to distribute the video and report to hundreds of labor
unions, lawmakers, and workplace rights activists in order to drum up support
for legislative solutions to the problem.  The first challenge, says the ACLU,
is to make people aware that the problem even exists.</P>
<P>The educational video, &quot;Through the Keyhole: Privacy in the Workplace
-- An Endangered Right,&quot; documents several stories, including a machinist
fired for drinking a beer on his own time, a file clerk who was forced to strip
and take a urine drug test -- only to be fired on the basis of a &quot;false
positive&quot; for marijuana use, and a hotel worker who was secretly videotaped
while dressing and undressing in the men's locker room.</P>
<P>The video suggests strategies for effecting legislation, and includes a
resource booklet with guidelines for drafting model statutes, lobbying
lawmakers, and educating co-workers.</P>
<P>The accompanying report -- an update on the ACLU's &quot;A State of
Emergency in the American Workplace&quot; originally published in 1990 --
documents a significant increase in electronic surveillance, telephone and
computer monitoring, and urine drug testing.  It also warns of a new and
potentially devastating threat to employee privacy: genetic testing.</P>
<P>Among the key findings of the update:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The number of people subject to <B>electronic surveillance</B> at work has
increased from approximately 8 million six years ago to more than 30 million
today.</LI>
<LI>Employers eavesdrop on an estimated 400 million <B>telephone conversations</B>
every year, or more than 750 calls every minute.</LI>
<LI>The percentage of major companies which subject employees to <B>urine drug
tests</B> has climbed from 38 percent six years ago to more than 70 percent
today. </LI>
<LI>Despite strong economic incentives for companies to subject job applicants
to <B>genetic tests</B>, only six states have enacted laws proscribing such
practices.</LI></UL>
<P>The ACLU will be making the report available to the general public through
its World Wide Web site (http://www.aclu.org), where Internet users can also
view a 20-second excerpt of the video.  </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Our nation's workplaces have become a fertile ground for prying eyes
and ears,&quot; Maltby said.  &quot;It's time for people to stand up and demand
that their right to personal privacy be respected.  Employees do not discard
their civil liberties when they punch-in for work.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<TITLE>ACLU Press Release  07/19/96: ACLU Urges FDA to Approve Mifepristone

<H2>ACLU Urges FDA to Approve Mifepristone for Early Medical Abortion:
Statement of Janet Gallagher, Director ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project</H2></CENTER>
<P> <B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>July 19, 1996</B></P>
<P>WASHINGTON -- For more than a decade, American women have been denied the
option of safe and effective nonsurgical abortions because of vocal protests
from anti-choice extremists.  The Food and Drug Administration now has the
opportunity to approve Mifepristone, and provide women with an important new
option of early medical abortions. 
</P>
<P>The ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project calls upon the FDA to act
immediately on the application to approve Mifepristone and make early medical
abortions available to women in this country by the end of the year.   Women
should have access to all surgical and nonsurgical abortion procedures that have
proven safe and effective. 
</P>
<P>Mifepristone has long been established as a safe and effective alternative
to surgical abortions.  Hundreds of thousands of women in other counters have
used Mifepristone for years without major side effects or complications.
Clinical trials held in the U.S. have reached similar conclusions. 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, anti-choice extremists are attempting to mislead the public
with exaggerated and unsubstantiated claims about Mifepristone's safety.  Their
assertions are perhaps best left to the physicians with intimate knowledge of
the medical procedure, but it is worth noting that those claims have been
roundly  rejected by the medical and public health community. 
</P>
<P>These same anti-choice groups who are opposing FDA approval of Mifepristone
have also been trying to criminalize late-term abortion procedures.  The irony
is telling: after doing their best to ban late-term abortion, they are now
directing their efforts to ban early medical abortions.  They are not fooling
anybody with their thinly-veiled agenda. Their opposition to Mifepristone stems
from their strategy to outlaw all abortions. 
</P>
<P>Women who want to avoid surgery should have access to safe and effective
early medical abortions.  The FDA should fulfill their public health mission and
move quickly to approve Mifepristone.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>By a 342- to-67 vote, the House passed a bill that would redefine marriage

in Federal law as a &quot;legal union between one man and one woman,&quot; and 

allow states to ignore same-sex marriages performed in other states.</P>

<P>In testimony submitted to the House and the Senate, which is considering a

similar measure, the ACLU called the proposed legislation &quot;unprecedented,

discriminatory, and unconstitutional&quot; and said it would have the effect of

treating legally married gay couples as strangers under Federal laws and


programs.</P>

<P>&quot;The House today turned its back on a fundamental human right for

political expediency,&quot; said Laura W. Murphy, Director of the ACLU's

National Washington Office.</P>

<P>&quot;This goes beyond legislators saying they are not ready to accept

same-sex marriages,&quot; she said. &quot;This is an unnecessary and

mean-spirited attempt by some in Congress to select out lesbians and gay men for

discriminatory treatment.&quot;  She added that the vote on the same-sex

marriage legislation will be included in the ACLU's biennial civil liberties

ratings for members of Congress.</P>

<P>Murphy termed unacceptable the silence from many traditional civil

libertarians, and, in contrast, pointed to a recent interview with Rep. John

Lewis, Democrat of Georgia. In comments published late last month, Lewis said 

that African-Americans should not, and cannot, legitimately draw a distinction

between their struggle for equal treatment before the law and that of gay men

and lesbians.</P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&quot;Certain rights are basic human rights,&quot; Lewis said. &quot;You

cannot tell individuals they cannot fall in love. Dr. King used to say when

people talking about interracial marriage:  Racists don't fall in love and get

married. Individuals fall in love and get married.'&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The ACLU agreed. &quot;As long as our nation attaches a wealth of economic

and legal benefits to civil marriages, denying those same benefits to lesbians

and gay men is nothing short of outright discrimination,&quot; said Matthew 

Coles, Director of the ACLU's National Lesbian and Gay Rights Project.</P>

<P>In its testimony, which was signed by Murphy and Coles, the ACLU said that a

second provision of the bill would attempt to carve a &quot;gay exception&quot;

to the Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause by allowing states to ignore

marriages performed in any other state.</P>

<P>That clause guarantees that the rights conferred to citizens in one state

will be honored by the other states.</P>

<P>The Full Faith and Credit Clause absolutely requires states to honor the

judgements of other state courts -- including divorce, inheritance and

commercial judgments -- which often take into account marital status.  To that

extent, the bill is an &quot;unmistakable violation of the Constitution,&quot;

Coles said.</P>

<P>The issue of same-sex marriage has been raised in response to a Hawaii

Supreme Court ruling in May 1993 that the denial of marriage licenses to three

lesbian and gay couples appears to violate the state's Equal Rights Amendment. 

The Justices sent the case back to the trial to decide if the state can prove a

&quot;compelling state interest&quot; in denying the marriage licenses.</P>

<P>The trial is now scheduled for September 10. Although legal observers say

the state will have difficulty meeting its burden, a final decision from the

Hawaii Supreme Court is not expected until at least 1997.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&quot;Our efforts now move to the Senate,&quot; said H. Alexander Robinson,

an ACLU legislative representative.  &quot;We challenge the Senate to stand up

for fundamental fairness and avoid the deplorable election-year strategy of

scapegoating lesbian and gay Americans for political gain.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Robinson also noted that an amendment banning workplace discrimination

against gays will likely be introduced next week to the anti-gay marriage bill.

&quot;The addition of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act will give the Senate

an opportunity to demonstrate its support for fairness,&quot; Robinson added.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2> 07/11/96 -- ACLU Criticizes Allies for Jumping Ship on Gay Marriage;
Submits Testimony Calling Bill Unconstitutional, Bad Public Policy</H2></CENTER>
<P> <B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>July 11, 1996</B></P>
<P>WASHINGTON &#150; As a Senate committee examined a bill that would deny
recognition of marriages between lesbian and gay couples, the American Civil
Liberties Union criticized many of its traditional allies, including stalwart
civil rights activists, for jumping ship on this issue of fundamental fairness.</P>
<P>In testimony submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, the ACLU called
the proposed legislation &#150; the so-called Defense of Marriage Act &#150; &quot;unprecedented,
discriminatory, and unconstitutional&quot; and said it would have the effect of
treating legally married gay couples as strangers under Federal laws and
programs.</P>
<P>&quot;We challenge our allies who are supporting this divisive measure to
set aside political expediency and recognize that the right to freely decide
whom to marry is as fundamental a human right as exists,&quot; said Laura W.
Murphy, Director of the ACLU's National Washington Office. She added that the
vote on the same-sex marriage legislation will be included in the ACLU's
biennial civil liberties ratings for members of Congress.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;This goes beyond legislators saying they are not ready to accept
same-sex marriages,&quot; Murphy said. &quot;This is an unnecessary and
mean-spirited attempt by some in Congress to select out lesbians and gay men for

that African-Americans should not, and cannot, legitimately draw a distinction

<P>The ACLU agreed. &quot;As long as our nation attaches a wealth of economic
and legal benefits to civil marriages, denying those same benefits to lesbians
and gay men is nothing short of outright discrimination,&quot; said Matthew
Coles, Director of the ACLU's National Lesbian and Gay Rights Project.</P>
<P>&quot;At this moment, gay men or lesbians can lose their homes to the
government when a partner becomes ill, are barred from intensive care units when
their partners are desperately ill, or lose everything when a partner dies
because society refuses to recognize their relationships,&quot; Coles said.</P>
<P>In its testimony, which was signed by Murphy and Coles, the ACLU said that a
second provision of the bill would attempt to carve a &quot;gay exception&quot;
to the Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause by allowing states to ignore

<P>In a letter to H. Alexander Robinson, an ACLU legislative representative,
Rep. Harry Johnston, a Democrat from Florida, said that &quot;the truth is that
this legislation is a thinly disguised attempt to generate a hot-button
political issue.&quot;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&quot;I have been married for 42 years,&quot; Johnston added, &quot;and
believe that marriage is both a basic human right and a private, personal
decision.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Ruling on &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; Ban on Gay Troops Kicked Back
to Federal District Court</H2>
<H4>Federal Appeals Court Focuses on Equal Treatment Issues Raised by Lambda
and ACLU </H4></CENTER>
<P> <B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>July 1, 1996</B></P>
<P>NEW YORK &#151; A federal appeals court today sent back a challenge to the
Pentagon's two-year-old &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; law and ruled that a
lower court must decide whether the constitution allows the government to treat
lesbians and gay men in the military differently than non-gay servicemembers.</P>
<P>A three-judge panel for the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously
ruled that a ban on sailors and soldiers who identify themselves as gay would be
constitutional only if the government has the right to subject lesbians and gay
men to different rules than those imposed on non-gay servicemembers concerning
speech, relationships, and intimate conduct.</P>
<P>In the case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund, the court ruled on the government's appeal of the
decision last year by U.S. District Court Judge Eugene Nickerson.  The appeals
court vacated Nickerson's ruling and remanded the case back to his Eastern
District Court in Brooklyn, New York.</P>
<P>Lambda Legal Director Beatrice Dohrn said, &quot;We now have the opportunity
to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of a law that prohibits behavior for
lesbians and gay men that is permitted and even commonplace for non-gay people
-- things as simple as holding hands.  The Second Circuit agreed with us that,
if the military's harsher rules for gay people's behavior cannot be justified,
then the entire ban must fall.&quot;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The appeals court did not uphold the law,&quot; said Matthew Coles,
director of the ACLU's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project.  &quot;Instead it
reframed the question.  Today's ruling puts the spotlight where it belongs: on
the unequal treatment of lesbians and gay men.  This is what we've been
challenging from the beginning.  If we're successful again at the lower court,
the entire ban will be declared unconstitutional.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The case challenged the ban on behalf of six service members, none of whom
were facing discharge under the policy.  Nickerson rejected the policy as &quot;Orwellian&quot;
and &quot;inherently deceptive,&quot; and struck it down  on First and Fifth
Amendment grounds.</P>

<P>The American Civil Liberties Union today released its annual summary of the
1995 U.S. Supreme Court term, giving high marks to the Court's historic rulings
on gay rights, women's rights and its protection of free speech.   	</P>
<P>But the ACLU also expressed grave disappointment over the Court's continued
backslide on racial equality and safeguarding the rights of criminal defendants.
   	</P>
<P>The ACLU, which files in more cases before the Supreme Court than any other
organization except the Justice Department, issues a summary at the end of each 
term to examine the Court's handling of civil liberties cases.   	</P>
<P>&quot;In the areas of gay rights and women's rights, the Court has sent a
clear message that neither old practices nor new laws can be justified on the
basis of irrational prejudices or outmoded stereotypes,&quot; said Steven
Shapiro, the ACLU's national legal director, referring to decisions striking
down Colorado's anti-gay Amendment 2 and the all-male policy at the Virginia
Military Institute.    	</P>
<P>&quot;The fact that both these cases were won with solid majorities
represents one of the most significant developments in equal protection law in
many years,&quot; Shapiro added.  	</P>
<P>The Court also continued its strong defense of free speech.  In four
separate cases, the Court strengthened First Amendment protections for
commercial speech, and struck down government restrictions on campaign
contributions, political endorsements, and cable broadcasters.  	</P>
<P>However, for the third year in a row, the Court further eroded the Voting
Rights Act and invalidated four additional minority-majority districts. In
addition, criminal justice took a beating in several cases ranging from
prisoners' rights and civil forfeiture, to traffic stop searches and drug
sentencing profiles. </P>

<TITLE>ACLU Press Release -  06/13/96: ACLU Criticizes Supreme Court's
Continued Assault on Voting Rights Act</TITLE></HEAD>

<H2>ACLU Criticizes Supreme Court's Continued Assault on Voting Rights Act</H2></CENTER>
<P> <B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>Thursday, June 13, 1996</B></P>
<P>WASHINGTON -- The American Civil Liberties Union today criticized the
Supreme Court's two decisions this morning striking down majority-minority
districts, saying that the Court's continued assault on the Voting Rights Act
will have a crippling effect on civil rights. </P>
<P>The Court's 5-4 decisions in Shaw v. Hunt and Bush v. Vera strike down four
more majority- minority congressional districts, three in Texas and one in North
Carolina.  In total, eight majority- minority congressional districts have been
lost since 1993.</P>
<P>&quot;The inevitable consequence of the Court's action will be to produce a
Congress that is increasingly white at a time that the nation is becomingly
increasingly diverse,&quot; according to Laughlin McDonald, director of the
ACLU's Southern Regional Office in Atlanta.</P>
<P>&quot;The Court's continued attack on the Justice Department's enforcement
of the Voting Rights Act will further cripple one of the most effective pieces
of civil rights legislation that this country has ever enacted,&quot;  McDonald
said.</P>
<P>In last year's redistricting case from Georgia, the Court held that the
state faces a heavy burden of justification whenever race is the &quot;predominant&quot;
factor in redistricting.  Today's decisions invite even more reverse
discrimination claims by making it easier to trigger judicial strict scrutiny
and harder to satisfy it.</P>
<P>The decision from Texas, where incumbency also played an important role in
how the district lines were drawn, indicates that the Court will be quick to
find evidence of racial gerrymandering even in &quot;mixed motive&quot; cases. 
Today's decision from North Carolina indicates that &quot;bizarrely&quot; shaped
districts will rarely be upheld under a strict scrutiny test that was originally
developed to deal with invidious racial discrimination but that now is applied
to legislative efforts to remedy that discrimination.</P>
<P>&quot;In the name of racial neutrality, today's rulings perpetuate an
unfortunate double standard,&quot; said Steven R. Shapiro, the ACLU's national
legal director.  &quot;Minority districts that are not drawn with geographical
precision are likely to be struck down.  White districts that are just as oddly
shaped are tolerated as nothing more than politics as usual.  That result
promotes neither justice nor equality,&quot; he added.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>06/02/96: Visions of Liberty, #1</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><BLOCKQUOTE><IMG
SRC="/graphics/vision.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<P><I>by Ira Glasser, ACLU Executive Director</I></P>
<P>NEW YORK: June 2, 1996 -- Today, we inaugurate a regular, weekly cyberspace
column focusing on civil liberties in America.  Why a column, why now, why here?
 	</P>
<P>The answer to &quot;why a column&quot; can be found in its title, &quot;Visions
of Liberty.&quot;  The title comes from a book of the same name that I wrote in
1991 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights.  In it, I tried
to tell the story of liberty: how and why the Bill of Rights was invented; how
the courts acquired the independence and power to interpret the Bill of Rights
and apply it in a way that keeps most of us free; and how the Bill of Rights was
expanded, both by subsequent constitutional amendments and Supreme Court
decisions, to include those who were at first left out.  	</P>
<P>But the story of liberty is not just about courts and lawsuits; it is also
and primarily a story of individual people, many stories actually, full of
conflict and drama and excitement, of individuals who claimed their rights,
often at great personal risk, and who were at first denied and sometimes
punished; who nonetheless fought on -- sometimes, it seemed, unreasonably -- but
whose persistence and stamina helped establish many of the rights that protect
us all today.    	</P>
<P>People like Benjamin Bache, the grandson of Benjamin Franklin, who risked
arrest and government-incited mob reprisals for exercising freedom of the press
during America's infancy; Dred Scott, a runaway slave whose case first tested --
unsuccessfully - the constitutionality of slavery; Myra Bradwell, who in 1873
dared to challenge a ban on women practicing law; Homer Plessy, a man with one
black great grandparent who challenged racial segregation on America's railroads
in 1896; John Scopes, tried as a criminal in 1925 for teaching the theory of
evolution in a Tennessee classroom; Fred Korematsu, jailed in his own country
during World War II because his ancestors were Japanese; Rosa Parks, who sat
down in 1955 in a white-only seat on a public bus; and Oliver Brown, who, with
his 7-year old daughter Linda, challenged racial segregation in public schools
in the early 1950s.  	</P>
<P>End of story?  Not hardly.  Today, and every day, we find similar stories: a
man in Colorado who challenges that state's attempt to cut off rights for gay
people; a couple in Mississippi who resist the majority's attempt to force
unwelcome religious beliefs on their small children in public school; a pregnant
teenager and her parents in Nebraska fighting against the state's intrusion into
their family's right to decide whether she should bear a child; and a variety of
people challenging a new federal law imposing censorship here on the Internet.  
 	</P>
<P>All of these cases involve efforts by individuals to assert their rights
against the majority.  For	liberty means that, even in a democracy, the majority
cannot be allowed to rule everything, that people have certain rights -- are
born with rights -- that no majority should be able to take away.  	</P>
<P>But because the majority is powerful -- especially in a democracy -- rights
are usually vulnerable and fragile, a tenuous road hacked through a jungle of
power, which, left unattended, always retakes the road.  This column, I hope,
will help illuminate the pathways to liberty through that ever-encroaching
jungle.  	</P>
<P>As to &quot;why here&quot;: whether you're reading this column on a World
Wide Web page, or in America Online, or from a sheet of recycled paper printed
with laser-jet ink, the answer lies in the myriad technological advances that
enable me to reach you through this new medium.  For if the Internet is like a
new printing press, then we have the opportunity to reach each other without
owning a newspaper or a television station.  	</P>
<P>Why now?  Because we are living through a period of rapid and fundamental
economic, technological and social change.  And we know from other, similar
historical periods, that such changes often create fear and anxiety.  When
people are afraid and anxious, they are especially vulnerable to scapegoating. 
They read in the papers or hear on the radio about the crime rate, unemployment,
and inflation and they say it's those immigrants, it's those gay people, it's
those women, it's those blacks, it's those flag-burners, it's those teenagers.</P>
<P>The problems that worry people require long-term solutions, but politicians
are reluctant to talk about long-term solutions because they don't operate in
the long-term.  They worry about next November and how to get elected.  So
they're always looking for short-term solutions, and sometimes not even that. 
They're looking for quick fixes that make them appear responsive to the anger
and the fear and if they have to scapegoat whole categories of people and sell
out everyone's civil liberties, well, that's what they'll do.  	</P>
<P>And that's &quot;why now.&quot;  This column will be devoted to connecting
the dots between the older stories of liberty and those taking place today, to
illustrating the visions of liberty that lead to rights we too often take for
granted, to linking our own rights with those who have exercised them a bit
earlier than the rest of us.  Their struggle, as always, is our struggle, even
though we don't always realize it.</P>

Previously, the Administration had said that althoughthe President opposed same-sex marriage, he  had not yet decided what actionto take on the legislation introduced by Republicans in Congress.<P>  "It is particularly ironic that the Clinton Administration would makethis announcement only days after the U.S. Supreme Court made the promiseof the Constitution real for lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans," said MatthewColes, Director of the ACLU's National Lesbian and Gay Rights Project. "OnMonday, the Supreme Court ruled that laws that single out lesbians and gayAmericans for second-class status --  like the so-called Defense of MarriageAct --  violate the basic guarantees of our Constitution."<P>  Last week, the ACLU submitted a statement before a House subcommitteehearing on the legislation, calling the bill a "deplorable act of hostilityunworthy of the United States Congress."<P>  The Constitution Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee heldhearings last Wednesday to consider the bill, which would deny recognitionof future marriages between same-sex couples by redefining marriage in Federallaw as a "legal union between one man and one woman."  That would have theeffect of treating legally married gay couples as strangers under all Federallaws and programs, from Medicaid through the tax code.<P>  A second provision of the bill would attempt to carve a "gay exception"to the Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause by allowing states toignore same-sex marriages performed in any other state.  That clause guaranteesthat the rights of people in one state will be honored by the other states. Congress has invoked its power to say what effect other state laws haveon only four occasions -- and only when it sought to promote uniformity amongthe states.  <P>  "This legislation would, like the now discredited Colorado amendment,treat lesbians and gay men differently simply out of hostility or fear,"said Laura W. Murphy, Director of the ACLU's Washington National Office.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><A HREF="/graphics/toolbar.map"><IMGSRC="/graphics/toolbar.gif" ISMAP="ISMAP" BORDER="0"></A></CENTER><P><CENTER></CENTER><H6><CENTER><I>Copyright 1996, The American Civil LibertiesUnion</I></CENTER></H6></BODY></HTML>

"That tradition should not be disturbed. This bill throws it on the trash heap for no reason other than to belittlethe relationships of lesbian and gay citizens."<P>    The Constitution Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee heldhearings Wednesday to consider a bill introduced last week that would denyrecognition of future marriages between same-sex couples by redefining marriagein Federal law as a "legal union between one man and one woman."  That wouldhave the effect of treating legally married gay couples as strangers underall Federal laws and programs, from Medicaid through the tax code.<P>    A second provision of the bill would attempt to carve a "gay exception"to the Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause by allowing states toignore same-sex marriages performed in any other state.

To that extent, it is an "unmistakable violation of theConstitution," said Coles in the statement submitted jointly with Laura W.Murphy, Director of the ACLU's Washington National Office.  <P>   "The United States Supreme Court has ruled again and again that theFull Faith and Credit Clause obligates every state to respect the judgementsof other states, including judgements of divorce," they added.    The ACLUalso attacked the same provision as "very bad policy." <P>"This is one nation," the statement continued.   "It does not make senseto say to Americans that the existence of their marriages depends on whichstates they travel through on vacation, or which states their employer transfersthem  to Americans have a right to go from state to state, and giving upone's most central, most intimate relationship should not be the price ofexercising it."<P>    The bill, entitled the "Defense of Marriage Act," was drafted in closeassociation with radical conservative groups who have sought to elevate themarriage issue into presidential politics. A similar bill was introducedin the Senate last Wednesday.<P>    The issue over same-sex marriages have been raised in response toa Hawaii Supreme Court ruling in May 1993 that the denial of marriage licensesto three lesbian and gay couples may violate the state's Equal Rights Amendment. The Justices sent the case back to the trial court, to decide if the statecan prove a "compelling state interest," in denying marriage to same sexcouples.<P>    The case will go to trial in August later this year, and a final decisionfrom the state supreme court is not expected until 1997.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><A HREF="/graphics/toolbar.map"><IMGSRC="/graphics/toolbar.gif" ISMAP="ISMAP" BORDER="0"></A></CENTER><P><CENTER></CENTER><H6><CENTER><I>Copyright 1996, The American Civil LibertiesUnion</I></CENTER></H6></BODY></HTML>

<CENTER><H2>ACLU Says Religious Liberty Sidelined
In Suspension of Basketball Star
</center></h2>
<p>
<STRONG>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>
Wednesday, March 13, 1996</STRONG>
<p>
In suspending star  player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf  for his refusal to stand
during the playing of the national anthem, the National Basketball
Association has sidelined religious liberty as well.  According to news
reports, Abdul-Rauf, who converted to Islam in 1991, has said that the Koran
states nothing should come between him and Allah.  
<p>
The N.B.A.'s action raises serious legal issues under the anti-discrimination
laws, which generally forbid discrimination against employees on the basis of
religious belief.  Those laws reflect a fundamental national commitment to
the principle of religious freedom, which is also embodied in the First
Amendment to the United States Constitution.  
<p>
Fifty years ago, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnett,  the
Supreme Court recognized the fundamental right to religious liberty when it
held that Jehovah's Witness schoolchildren could not be penalized when they
refused  to salute the American flag for religious reasons.  In an opinion
noted for its eloquence, Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote, "If there is one
fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high
or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism,
religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or
act their faith therein."
<p>
While the N.B.A. is not the government, it is regrettable that they have
placed marketing and public relations principles above the very principles
honored in the singing of the national anthem and the raising of the flag.

<CENTER><H2>Mississippi Mother's School Prayer Challenge Goes to Trial</H2></CENTER>
<p>

<STRONG>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>
March 4, 1996</STRONG>
<p>
Oxford, Mississippi -- Trial begins today in a major school prayer case
brought by a Mississippi mother seeking to stop unconstitutional and coercive
religious practices in her children's public school.  U.S. District Court
Judge Neal B. Biggers, Jr. will preside over the trial.  
<p>
The lawsuit, filed on December 20, 1994 by People For the American Way and
the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi, asks the federal court to
halt the unconstitutional practices of the Pontotoc County public schools,
which have included spoken prayers broadcast over the school intercom and in
classrooms and religious Bible studies classes for grades K through 12.
<p>
"If religious liberty means anything, it means that public schools can not
preach religion and indoctrinate students," said David Ingebretsen, executive
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi.  "This case is
not about keeping religion away from students, but ensuring that no student
is forced to practice a particular religion against his or her will."
<p>
"This case is about religious freedom, plain and simple," said People For the
American Way President Tom Andrews.  "This nation was founded by people
seeking the right to practice their religion not according to the dictates of
the state but according to the dictates of their own conscience. Today we
will be in the courtroom with Lisa Herdahl and her family because we firmly
believe that the Constitution is on the side of religious liberty.  And we
will be outside the courtroom as well, making the case for religious freedom
to the citizens of this community and to citizens all across the country."
<p>
The plaintiff in the case, Lisa Herdahl, brought suit after school officials
rejected her request to discontinue the unconstitutional practices and her
five children in the Pontotoc County schools, ages 5 to 15 , became the
subject of ridicule and harassment for not attending Bible classes or
participating in classroom prayers.
<p>
Her 7-year-old son, Jason, has been taunted by other students ever since his
second-grade teacher put headphones over his ears to block out the prayers
recited over the school intercom.  Her son David, 11, was branded an
"atheist" and "devil worshipper" by fellow students after a teacher told the
class that David didn't participate in Bible class because he doesn't believe
in God.
<p>
On April 18, 1995, Judge Biggers issued a preliminary injunction ordering
school officials to halt vocal prayers and Bible readings over the school
intercom and vocal prayers in classrooms during the school day.  
<p>
On February 22, 1996, Judge Biggers rejected the school district's assertions
that Mrs. Herdahl had no standing to challenge the religious Bible classes
being taught in the county schools.  Mrs. Herdahl's attorneys documented
during the discovery process that the Bible class teachers, who are selected
and paid by a group of local Protestant churches, are chosen in part for
their personal "salvation experience" and have reported to the church
committee on the number of students "saved" during the classes.
<p>
Mrs. Herdahl and her family have been subjected to harassment and
vilification -- both locally and from national leaders such as U.S. Speaker
of the House Newt Gingrich -- since she asked school officials to put an end
to the unconstitutional practices.
<p>
"My kids and I have been harassed for standing up for our religious freedom,"
said Mrs. Herdahl, who is a Christian.  "I've never tried to stop anyone
else's children from praying or reading the Bible in school or anywhere else.
But I don't believe that any students should be forced to choose between
going along with some official prayer or having to stand out and be
ostracized. That's not what public schools should be about in America."
<p>
People For the American Way and the ACLU of Mississippi are both nonpartisan
organizations dedicated to protecting constitutional liberties and defending
the separation of church and state.

ACLU Expresses Concerns on TV Rating Scheme;
Says "Voluntary" System is Government-Backed Censorship 
</h2>
</center>
<b>
<p>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
Thursday, February 29, 1996</b>
<p>
WASHINGTON -- The American Civil Liberties Union today expressed serious
concerns about the federal government's heavy-handed attempt to force a
content rating scheme on the television industry.  
<p>
Both President Clinton and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich met with
broadcast executives today to discuss implementation of a "voluntary"
television content rating system.  
<p>
However, the ACLU said that any content rating system adopted would not be
voluntary at all in light of the recently passed V-chip law and the
high-profile White House and Congressional "requests" for meeting with
television executives.  The ratings system endorsed today by the television
industry would be used in conjunction with the V-Chip, automatically blocking
programs that receive certain, adverse ratings.
<p>
"Today's activity will only undermine the ability of parents to exercise
control over their children's viewing," said Daniel E. Katz, ACLU Legislative
Counsel. "Rather than support the development of independent private rating
systems and technology, the President and Congress will force the
broadcasters to comply with a singular, federally-controlled rating system."
<p>
Marjorie Heins, director of the ACLU's Arts Censorship Project, said that
"the ACLU is collecting information and talking with producers, writers and
directors who will be harmed by the V-Chip legislation."
<p>
The ACLU opposed the V-Chip provision of the Telecommunications Act when it
was before Congress, arguing that -- contrary to what the legislation's
backers claimed -- it would actually shut out families from the process of
deciding what television programming is acceptable for their children.
Rather, the ACLU said, the V-Chip would empower bureaucrats and television
executives to make decisions for parents.
<p>
"Would the V-chip's automatic censors block out such 'violent' dramas as
'Schindler's List,' 'Roots,' or 'Gone With theWind?'" Katz said. "Would
producers make a television mini-series about the bloody Civil War, which
very likely would be blocked as too violent, or pass on such a project for
fear of censorship?"

ACLU Says Immigration Bill Is Unconstitutional, 
                       Unwise and Un-American
</h2>
</center>
<b>
 Statement of Gregory T. Nojeim,  Legislative Counsel <br>
ACLU Washington National Office 
<p>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
Tuesday, February 27, 1996
</b>
<p>  
WASHINGTON -- The House and Senate are scheduled to vote shortly on the most
wide-ranging set of immigration proposals in decades.  Much of the attention
has focused on the provisions that would reduce the number of newcomers
allowed to enter the country each year.  The most dangerous and troubling
aspects of the bills, however, evaded scrutiny : their dire effect on civil
liberties.
<p>  
    The immigration bills are unconstitutional, unwise and un-American.
 First, the bill would threaten the privacy rights of all Americans.
 Embedded in the legislation are provisions that would establish a single
federal computer registry to create a file of every single worker in the
United States. Every hiring decision would have to be cleared by this
government computer. This will not only lead to a serious infringement on our
privacy rights, but will cost taxpayers millions or billions of dollars, as
well as cause many Americans to be denied jobs improperly because of
data-entry errors.  For example, even a 1 percent error rate in the system
will cause 650,000 Americans to be categorized as unauthorized to work in
their own country.
<p>  
    The bill would also dangerously expand the government's power to listen
to our private conversations by dramatically expanding the list of federal
offenses used to authorize wiretaps. In 1994 alone, approximately two million
innocent conversations were intercepted through electronic surveillance.
 Congress should be working to minimize wiretaps, not the other way around.
<p>  
    Secondly, the House bill would visit a vestige of the McCarthy era on all
Americans. It would allow the government to deport aliens on the basis of
secret evidence. This provision is unconstitutional. Like citizens, aliens
have the right to see the evidence offered by the government against them.
Under the House bill, Americans would be barred from bring to the U.S.
speakers from abroad if they belonged to  an group that the government has
branded as "terrorist." This is a blatant attempt at governmental control of
the "marketplace of ideas" in the United States.
<p>  
    Third, the bill would violate due process.  The bill contains numerous
provisions that would eliminate some of the most basic protections of
judicial review and access to legal counsel guaranteed by the Fifth
Amendment's Due Process clause.  By imposing unreasonable time limits and
summary procedures, the bill would make it virtually impossible for someone
fleeing persecution to apply for asylum.  
<p>  
    If enacted, the bill would create two separate standards of due process:
one for citizens, another for non-citizens.  We should remind the sponsors of
this legislation that the Bill of Rights guarantees due process to all
"persons," and not just "citizens."
<p>  
    Fifth, if the Senate bill becomes law, local police untrained in
immigration enforcement would carry out the duties of the Border Patrol in
"immigration emergencies" involving a "mass influx" of aliens. This would
almost certainly result in more claims of abuse of constitutional rights
along the border. Untrained police would be even more likely than the Border
Patrol to detain Americans and authorized aliens based on their accents or
because they "look foreign."
<p>  
    The Senate bill would unnecessarily erect barriers to claims of
immigration-related employment discrimination. It would encourage the
practice of some employers to demand documents such as a "green card" from
their workers -- including U.S. citizens in some cases -- as evidence of
employment authorization.
<p>  
     Finally, both bills would tear apart American families and punish
hardworking immigrants.  The bill would shut the doors to 2.4 million people
who are the family members of Americans -- the parents, siblings and children
of U.S. citizens and residents.   In addition, the proposed legislation would
bar immigrant families, even those who have lived and worked in this country
for years, from receiving Social Security, Food Stamps and other benefits.
 Will children of immigrant parents be denied inoculations?    What does this
mean for elderly people currently receiving Social Security?  And what does
this bill mean for pregnant mothers who need health care assistance?
<p>  
    These proposals are based on fear and misunderstanding, not on the best
interest of the United States or the principles contained in our
Constitution.  They violate our country's history, and the history of
immigrants who have enabled America to grow and prosper.  We urge Congress to
honor our tradition and values, and vote against this bill.

"ACLU Argues Against State Funding of Religious Schools"
</h2>
</center>
<b>
<p>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
Monday, February 26, 1996
</b>
<p>  
MADISON -- On Tuesday, February 27, 1996 beginning at 1:30 p.m. the Wisconsin
Supreme Court in Madison will hear arguments for and against religious school
choice in a case that has national importance. 
<p>  
After the Wisconsin Legislature and Governor Tommy G. Thompson approved a
provision in the state budget bill that will  provide taxpayer dollars to
religious schools who accept qualified low income children, the American
Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin Foundation, with the assistance of the
national ACLU and Americans United for Separation of Church and State filed a
legal challenge.  The challenge was brought on behalf of 14 parents and
clergy who seek to defend religious liberty.
<p>  
The Governor with special counsel Ken Starr is defending the proposal.   The
Wisconsin Supreme Court accepted the case as an original action, bypassing
lower state courts, in August.  The Court granted the ACLU's motion for a
preliminary injunction later in August.  The proposal has been on hold since
then. 
<p>  
At  oral arguments, the ACLU's lead attorney Jeffrey Kassel will tell the
Court that the proposed funding scheme violates the Wisconsin State
Constitution and the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  The proposed
funding scheme would send taxpayer funds directly to religious schools which
have admitted their religious purpose.  In many instances religious schools
could receive more state funds per choice pupil than the school actually
charges for tuition.   National ACLU legal director Steven R. Shapiro,
ACLU/WIF's legal director Peter M. Koneazny and volunteer attorney Melanie
Cohen,  and Americans United's legal director Steven G. Green are assisting
in the representation of the ACLU's parent and clergy clients.

 ACLU Says Court Case Exposes America's Dirty Little Secret:
          The Criminal Justice System is Racially Biased
</h2>
</center>
<b>
<p>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
Monday, February 26, 1996
</b>
<p>  
     WASHINGTON -- The United States Supreme Court case United States v.
Armstrong, being argued here today, may provide the critical first step in
identifying a major source of racial discrimination in the nation's criminal
justice system -- the selective prosecution of African Americans.
<p>  
     The case comes not a moment too soon. The time has come for America to
admit to its "dirty little secret" that has so contaminated the nation's
criminal justice system. Ours is a racially biased, two-tiered system; one
for blacks and one for whites.
<p>  
     Beginning with the street level enforcement of state and federal
criminal laws, and ending with the meting out of the death penalty, African
Americans are disproportionately targeted, stopped, arrested, prosecuted,
sentenced to long mandatory prison terms and executed.  Indeed, in the nearly
30 years since the Kerner Commission warned that America was moving toward
"two societies, one black, one white - separate and unequal," our nation's
criminal justice system has made it a tragic reality.
<p>  
     Although the Armstrong case presents the narrow legal issue of whether
federal prosecutors in Los Angeles must disclose their charging criteria in
crack cocaine cases, the broader implications for the criminal justice system
are compelling:  whether federal prosecutors engage in a racially biased
decision-making process that results in selectively prosecuting African
Americans more harshly than whites.
<p>  
     The raw statistics cited in the Armstrong case that involve prosecutions
in Los Angeles are troubling indeed:
<p>  
-- The federal public defender's office in Los Angeles discovered that of the
24 crack cocaine cases closed out in 1991, all of the defendant's were
African American.
<p>  
--  Moreover, between 1991 and 1993 the federal public defender represented
53 defendants in crack cocaine cases, none were white.
<p>  
-- In contrast, from 1990 to 1992, 222 white defendants charged with crack
cocaine offenses were prosecuted in state court; thus, effectively avoiding
the harsh sentences required under the federal sentencing guidelines. 
<p>  
     The statistics alone certainly suggest that racial discrimination runs
rampant in the Los Angeles criminal justice system.  Although identifying
racial discrimination patterns is important, it alone does not solve the
problem.  To effectively purge the criminal justice system of racial bias, it
is critical to first expose the sources that foster racial discrimination.
 The Armstrong case may  provide the procedural vehicle for identifying these
sources.
<p>
       Indeed, the Court's decision in Armstrong may be the pivotal first step
in the attempt to eliminate racial bias in the criminal justice system.
 Requiring federal prosecutors to disclose their charging criteria for
bringing crack cocaine cases in federal court will likely resolve whether
prosecutors engage in a race-based decision-making charging process that has
a disparate impact on African Americans.  The Court must not avoid this
unique opportunity to strike a blow against racial discrimination in the
criminal justice system.  In a friend of the court brief filed with the NAACP
Legal Defense and Education Fund, the ACLU has strongly urged the Supreme
Court to affirm the lower court judgment ordering the federal prosecutor in
Los Angeles to disclose the criteria for prosecuting crack cocaine cases in
federal court versus state court.
<p>  
     It would be remiss, however, to simply discuss the Armstrong case
without acknowledging the other factors that contribute to racial bias in the
criminal justice system.  Nothing has contributed more significantly to the
racial disparity in the nation's criminal justice system than the so-called
"War on Drugs."
<p>  
     In the name of fighting this "war," our nation has increasingly employed
an ineffective militaristic approach to addressing the social problem of
illicit drug use.  As this failed "war" escalates, civil liberties crumble in
a misguided mission to conquer the perceived enemy--primarily people of color
and the poor. 
<p>  
     The results are disturbing, but not unexpected:  racial sentencing
disparity where Blacks and Hispanics are charged with and receive sentences
at or above the mandatory minimum more often than Whites arrested on the same
charges as is seen in the Armstrong case; unwarranted uniformity in
sentencing, ironically resulting in low level participants receiving more
time than so called "drug kingpins"; and an exploding prison population,
overwhelming minority, due to the proliferation of mandatory minimum
sentencing schemes.
<p>  
     These factors have produced these troubling statistics:
<p>  
     -- African Americans comprise 13 percent of the monthly drug users in
the U.S., but 39 percent of those arrested for drug offenses.
<p>  
     -- On any given day, almost one in three black men between the ages of
20-29 are in prison or jail, on probation or parole.
<p>  
     -- Although 13 percent of the U.S. population is African American, more
than 90 percent of all defendants prosecuted in federal court are African
American.
<p>  
     -- African Americans receive harsh prison sentences; whites convicted of
 similar offenses receive misdemeanor probation.
<p>  
     -- Over 60 percent of federal prisoners are drug offenders.
<p>  
     A significant contributing factor to the racial disparity can be traced
to the racial bias associated with drug sentencing.  Racial bias in drug
sentencing is most profoundly demonstrated in the irrational and unwarranted
disparity in federal cocaine law sentencing.  Under current federal
sentencing guidelines, persons convicted of crack cocaine offenses are
punished 100 times more severely than those convicted of powder cocaine
offenses.  For example, simple possession of more than five grams of crack is
a felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for a first time
offender, while possession of the same amount of powder cocaine is a
misdemeanor requiring no jail time.
<p>  
     The Armstrong case provides another example of the actual impact of this
is unwarranted disparity.  In federal court under the sentencing guidelines,
one of the defendants, if convicted, could receive a sentence of 35 years to
life in prison. Conversely, if convicted in state court for the same crack
cocaine offense, the same defendant would face three to 10 years.  Given the
obvious and significant differences between federal and state sentences for
crack cocaine offenses, it strains credulity to suggest that it was pure
coincidence that all 24 crack cocaine cases that the federal prosecutors
brought in federal court involved black defendants.
<p>  
     The disparate and devastating impact of the current federal sentencing
scheme on the African American community is well documented.  Nationwide
statistics compiled by the U.S. Sentencing Commission confirm the disparity:
 in 1993, 88 percent of those sentenced federally for crack cocaine
distribution were African American, while only 4.1 percent of the defendants
were white.  It is also worth noting that a majority of the nation's reported
crack cocaine users are White, but the "war on drugs" has been
disproportionately targeted at inner city Black communities.
<p>  
     In 1995, the United States Sentencing Commission arrived at the same
opinion and stated that the "federal sentencing data leads to the inescapable
conclusion the Blacks comprise the largest percentage of those affected by
the penalties associate with crack cocaine."  Acknowledging the overwhelming
evidence against maintaining the irrational federal cocaine sentencing
guidelines, the Sentencing Commission recommended amending its guidelines to
reflect a one-to-one ratio at the current levels set for powder cocaine.
 Unfortunately, for the first time in the Commission's history, the Congress
and the President rejected the Sentencing Commission's recommendation and
reinstated the illogical sentencing structure--a structure that places
African American's in a class that is separate, but unequal.   
<p>  
     Mandatory minimum sentencing schemes in addition to the federal
sentencing guidelines targeted at drug offenses have also had a disparate
impact on minorities.  As a result, our nation's prison population is
exploding--mostly with minorities.  Black and Hispanics combined now
represent nearly 90 percent of all offenders sentenced to state prison for
drug offenses.  The root of this problem lies in the fact that mandatory
minimum sentences are disproportionately applied to minorities.  A 1992 study
of federal court cases found that, where a mandatory minimum could apply
black offenders were 21 percent more likely and Hispanic offenders 28 percent
more likely than whites to receive at least the mandatory minimum prison
sentence.  Given these striking statistics  impacting exclusively on
minorities, it is difficult not to wonder whether the "war on drugs" has
driven the nation back to the ugly days of Dred Scott.
<p>  
     The incendiary issue of racial bias in the criminal justice system
cannot be not be ignored and must be addressed head-on.  The Armstrong case
represents a critical opportunity for the Supreme Court to establish the
procedural mechanism by which one can seek to identify the sources
contributing to racial disparity.  The Court must not be inhibited in this
endeavor due to the potential for discovering that federal prosecutors
contribute to racial disparity in the criminal justice system by engaging in
selective prosecution tactics in crack cocaine cases the disproportionately
target African Americans.  Justice Louis Brandeis' words in Olmstead v.
United States should provided the Court some resolve:  "Our Government is the
potent, the omnipresent teacher . . . If the Government becomes a lawbreaker,
it breeds contempt for the law."

Litigation Analysis:
United States v. Armstrong
<p>
ACLU Urges Court to Purge Criminal Justice System of Racial Bias
</h2>
</center>
<b>
<p>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
February 26, 1996
</b>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- In a strictly legal sense, the case of U.S. v. Armstrong,
argued today before the U.S. Supreme Court, appears to involve a  narrow
procedural issue:  under what circumstances must a federal prosecutor reveal
to the defense her reasons for bringing a prosecution. But in a larger sense,
this case presents the Court with the opportunity to address one of this
country's most troubling and insidious problems: pervasive racial bias in the
administration of our criminal justice system.
<p>
     The overrepresentation of young African American males in the jails and
prisons of the United States has been the subject of continuing media
coverage.  As has been widely reported, on any given day, almost one in three
black men between the ages of 20-29 are in prison or jail or on probation or
parole. The statistics in California, where the Armstrong prosecution arose,
are even more disturbing. Earlier this month, a study by the Center on
Juvenile and Criminal Justice found that nearly 40 percent of African
American men in their twenties in California are under some from of criminal
justice control. This compares to only 5 percent among white males of the
same age.
<p>
     Charges of racial bias by civil rights advocates, criminal defense
attorneys and social scientists are typically met with strong denials from
law enforcement officials and prosecutors, who argue that these disparities
are the unfortunate but inevitable function not of discrimination, but of the
higher crime rate in the inner cities. The importance of the Armstrong
litigation is that it may, depending on the Supreme Court's ruling, provide
some answers to this long-simmering debate by opening up to public scrutiny a
critical stage of the criminal justice process -- the charging stage.
Prosecutors have enormous discretion in deciding whom to prosecute. If the
race of a suspect, in fact, influences the charging decision, then the whole
process is vulnerable to constitutional attack. 
<p>
     A federal prosecutor's decision to prosecute a crack cocaine offense --
the offense involved in Armstrong -- is especially consequential because of
the harshness of federal penalties compared to state penalties.   If
Armstrong were convicted under federal law, he would face a 10-year mandatory
sentence. If prosecuted under state law, the same defendant could receive as
little as jail time and probation.  
<p>
     The raw statistics upon which the Armstrong case is based suggest a
pattern of selective prosecution based on race:
<p>
-- In Los Angeles, where the Armstrong litigation arose, not a single white
offender has been      convicted of a crack cocaine offense in the federal
courts since 1986, when Congress      enacted stiff new penalties.  
<p>
-- Between 1990 and 1992, over 200 white crack dealers were prosecuted by the
state      authorities in Los Angeles, a period during which the federal
authorities prosecuted not      one white defendant for crack.
<p>
-- Between 1991 and 1993, of the 53 defendants represented by the federal
public defender's      office, none were white.
<p>
Moreover, this pattern is not confined to the Los Angeles area.  According to
a 1992 survey by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, only minorities were
federally prosecuted for crack in seventeen states and many cities, including
Boston, Denver, Chicago, Miami, and Dallas.  In New York, the state most
heavily hit by the crack epidemic, only three whites were convicted in
federal court for crack distribution.  Nationwide, about 96% of crack
defendants in federal court are nonwhite.  
<p>
WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT HIDING IN ARMSTRONG?
<p>
     The defendants in Armstrong are minorities who have been charged by the
U.S. Attorneys Office in Los Angeles  with crack distribution.   When their
attorneys filed a motion for discovery suggesting that race was a significant
charging factor, the federal trial judge was moved by the strength of the
statistical evidence and expressed concern that the "government hasn't
offered any explanation at all as to why persons being brought to Federal
court for these drug offenses all are black."   When the government could not
explain the statistical disparity, the judge ordered the government to reveal
the criteria it used "in deciding which of these cases will be filed in state
court versus Federal court."   The government then offered some of its
criteria, but the court still found its explanation wanting, and concluded
that the government had failed to make clear, "if there is any criteria for
bringing this case and others like it in Federal court." 
<p>
     Armstrong is now before the U.S. Supreme Court because the government
continues to resist divulging its criteria for charging these defendants
under federal law.
<p>
     The American public has the right to know whether blacks and other
minorities are being selectively and unconstitutionally subjected to federal,
rather than state, charges in crack prosecutions.   As the NAACP Legal
Defense and Education Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union, reminded
the Court in an amicus brief filed on behalf of the defendants:
<p>
     "This case once again brings the issue of racial discrimination in the
criminal justice system      to the forefront.  As this Court has previously
recognized, even the appearance of      discrimination has a corrosive effect
on public confidence in the administration of justice.       The actual
existence of discrimination is obviously incompatible with our most basic
     notions of due process and equal protection."
<p>
BEYOND ARMSTRONG
<p>
       During the past decade, numerous state and federal courts established
task forces charged with evaluating the treatment of racial and ethnic
minorities in the courts.  Each of the task forces concluded that racial
bias, both overt and unconscious, continues to cause not only prosecutors,
but also police and judges, to treat minorities differently and more harshly
than their white counterparts.  This occurs at every point that discretion is
exercised, whether it be at the arrest, charging, bail, jury selection or
sentencing stage.  The conclusion of the Florida Supreme Court Racial and
Ethnic Bias Study Commission is typical: 
<p>
     "In short, the reality is that African-Americans are being treated
differently at several      stages of the justice system.  When the object is
punishment -- detention, formal      adjudication, or commitment --
minorities get more; when what is being handed out is      informal
processing or diversion, minorities get less  This differential treatment
results, at      least in part, from racial and ethnic bias on the part of
enough individual police officers,      prosecutors, and judges to make the
system operate as if it intended to discriminate      against non-whites."
<p>
     It is critical that immediate steps be taken to eradicate racial bias
from our criminal justice system.  But we will not be able to rise to this
challenge if the government withholds from us the information necessary to
determine whether or not discretion is being exercised fairly. We hope the
Supreme Court will agree.

             ACLU Names Two New Legislative Counsels
</h2>

<p>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
Friday, February 23, 1996
</b>
<p>
     WASHINGTON -- The American Civil Liberties Union has appointed two new
legislative counsels in its Washington National Office. Joining the staff are
Mark Kappelhoff, who will work on criminal justice issues, and Daniel E.
Katz, who will be responsible for covering several First Amendment issues.
<p>
     The appointments, announced by Laura W. Murphy, Director of the
Washington National Office, maintain the ACLU's primacy in these key areas of
civil liberties advocacy.
<p>
     "Beneath the rhetorical facade of the Contract with America, and the
Presidential campaign debate, are proposals to fundamentally alter the
liberties protected by the Bill of Rights," Murphy said. "I am glad we have
two more talented and committed individuals to fight the erosion of these
rights."
<p>
     Prior to joining the ACLU, Mr. Kappelhoff served as a Visiting Assistant
Professor of Law at the American University, Washington College of Law. He
taught in the nationally recognized clinical law program in which law
students represent indigent adult and juvenile clients before courts in
Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia.
<p>
     Mr. Kappelhoff's primary legislative responsibilities at the ACLU will
include issues involving criminal justice and civil rights such as the
omnibus crime bills, race-based sentencing disparities, civil asset
forfeiture, police brutality, prisoner rights; mandatory minimum sentencing,
search and seizure, drug testing and juvenile justice.
<p>
     Mr. Katz, although new to the legislative counsel position, is quite
familar with the ACLU Washington office. Prior to his appointment, he served
as a legal fellow working on First Amendment issues. Before that, he was a
legal fellow at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press in
Arlington, VA., where he monitored developments in news media law and advised
reporters about their First Amendment rights.
<p>
     Among the specific issues Mr. Katz will be watching are school prayer,
television violence, school vouchers, flag desecration, political advocacy
restrictions on nonprofit organizations and government funding of religious
organizations.
<p>
     Mr. Katz received his Juris Doctor degree from the University of Florida
College of Law, where he was a member of the Florida Law Review. An article
he authored, "Speak No Evil, Think No Evil: The Florida Hate Crime Law," was
published in the law review.
<p>
     Mr. Kappelhoff received his Bachelor of Science degree from St. John's
University in Minnesota and his Juris Doctor degree from American
University's Washington College of Law. While attending law school he was a
member of the American University Law Review and authored an article titled
"Is there a Right to Privacy?"
<p>
     Prior to becoming an attorney, Mr. Kappelhoff spent several years on the
legislative staff of Representative Gerry Sikorski. He began his legal career
as an Association in the D.C. law office of Kutak, Rock & Campbell. A strong
advocate of public interest law, he worked for several years as an Assistant
Public Defender in Montgomery County, Maryland.

ACLU Background Briefing:
     Supreme Court to Review ACLU Challenge 
to Censorship Provisions of the 1992 Cable Act</h2>
</center>
<b>
<p>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
Thursday, February 15, 1996
</b>
<p>
	WASHINGTON, D.C.--Next Wednesday, February 21, the Supreme 
Court will hear arguments in the consolidated cases of  Denver Area 
Educational Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. (DAETC) and 
American Civil Liberties Union  v. FCC and the United States, and 
Alliance for Community Media v. FCC and the United States. 
<p>
	Counsel for the ACLU and the other petitioners will argue 
that Section 10 of the 1992 Cable Act, implemented by the FCC and 
the United States, violates First Amendment freedoms because it 
authorizes and requires censorship of so-called "indecency" on 
cable television access channels under vague standards and lacks 
essential procedural safeguards against incursions on free speech.  
<p> 
	The case arises from a hastily tacked-on  amendment to the 
1992 Cable Act known as Section 10, in which Congress, led by 
Senator Jesse Helms, authorized cable operators to
prohibit programming they "reasonably believe" to be indecent, or 
to place such programming on segregated channels that must be 
blocked until the subscriber requests access in writing.  Section 
10 also authorized cable operators to prohibit programming on 
public, educational and governmental (PEG) access channels that is 
"sexually explicit" or "solicits or promotes unlawful conduct."
<p>
	This case is of particular interest in light of the ACLU's 
week-old challenge to the indecency provisions of the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996.   While it is not possible to 
predict precisely how the outcome of  ACLU and DAETC v. FCC  will 
affect the litigation against government efforts to censor the 
Internet, it is certain that this case is an important milestone in 
the ongoing struggle to preserve freedom of speech in all forms of 
electronic communication.
<p>	
<b>	Prior Proceedings</b>
<p>
	This case began during the rulemaking period following the 
passage of the 1992 Cable Act, when the ACLU, DAETC, the Alliance, 
and other civil liberties groups submitted detailed comments to the 
FCC arguing that Section 10 could not be implemented in a manner 
consistent with the Constitution. The FCC rejected the arguments 
and issued regulations implementing the law.  
<p>
	The ACLU and DAETC petitioned the Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia Circuit for review, with the Commission and 
the United States as respondents.  The government conceded in oral 
argument that if Sections 10(a) and 10(b) were found to involve 
"state action," they would violate the First Amendment.  A panel of 
the court unanimously struck down Sections 10(a) and (c) of the 
law, and found serious constitutional questions regarding Section 
10(b).  (Note: The provisions of Section 10 are described further 
below as well as in the text of the brief.) 
<p>
	However, the full D.C. Circuit vacated the panel's judgment, 
reheard the case en banc and sustained Section 10 and the 
regulations over the dissent in whole or in part of four of the 
court's eleven judges. The majority concluded -- in an 
unprecedented holding -- that the court could avoid addressing a 
constitutional challenge to a content-based statute regulating 
protected speech because the regulations only authorize, rather 
than command, censorship by private cable operators, and because 
these private acts cannot be attributed to government. 
<p>
	In her dissenting opinion joined in full by Judge Tatel, 
Judge Wald pointed out that Sections 10(a) and 10(b) must be 
considered together as part of one scheme regulating leased access 
programming, which, rather than "restore" editorial control to 
cable operators, requires them either to ban or block "indecent 
programming" and as such is clearly subject to First Amendment 
scrutiny.  Judge Wald concluded, joined also by Judge Rogers, that 
Sections 10(a) and 10(b) unconstitutionally cause a deprivation of 
First Amendment rights because of the undue burden on both speakers 
and listeners.  The regulations are clearly not the least 
restrictive means of achieving the asserted compelling interest, 
Judge Wald found, because of the ready availability of less 
restrictive means, such as the existing lockbox requirement.
<p>
	Additionally, Judge Wald found that 10(c), with its 
governmentally imposed definitions of disfavored speech and its 
erection of a separate scheme to regulate such speech, clearly 
constitutes governmental action and is not the least restrictive 
means of achieving the asserted compelling interest.
<p>
	The Supreme Court agreed to review the case, to address the 
questions whether a law can evade constitutional scrutiny by 
delegating censorship of a specified category of expression to 
private companies; and whether the "indecency" standard is too 
vague and subjective for a law regulating constitutionally 
protected speech.  
<p>
<b>	The Petitioner: Denver Area Educational Telecommunications 
Consortium (DAETC)</b>
<p>
	Since 1989, DAETC has operated a cable TV programming 
service, formerly known as the 90's Channel, now known as Free 
Speech TV, which has offered programming with strong political and 
social themes.   Free Speech TV currently reaches more than 4 
million cable homes on leased access and other channels.  Its 
programming is often controversial and otherwise unavailable, and 
discusses topics including the Persian Gulf war, environmental 
contamination, AIDS, racism, U.S.-Cuba relations, art censorship, 
union organizing, the status of recent immigrants, gay rights, 
feminism, the Palestinian uprising, issues of concern to Native 
Americans, prostitution, and prison conditions.
<p>
	An important part of DAETC's programming on certain of these 
topics inextricably deals with sexuality, such as a program segment 
about an organization that seeks to demystify gynecology by showing 
women how to perform their own pelvic exams, the controversy 
surrounding a Robert Mapplethorpe photography exhibit, and 
documentary-style footage from a lesbian and gay pride parade.  
<p>
	Some of DAETC's socially useful programming would be swept up 
in Section 10's broad definition of "indecency."   If Section 10 
stands, the very concept of leased and public access will crumble, 
because for the first time cable operators will have the power to 
censor these formerly independent access channels, and viewers will 
be denied access to the independent voices that can be heard on 
diverse programming such as Free Speech TV. (Note:  DAETC has 
produced a 7-minute tape illustrating Free Speech TV's programming, 
available in VHS or 3/4 format.  See below for information on how 
to obtain a copy.)  
<p>	

<b>	Section 10 of the 1992 Cable Act: Background</b>
<p>
	In 1984, to "assure that cable communications provide...the 
widest possible diversity of information sources and services to 
the public," Congress passed the Cable Communication Policy Act.  
This Act required cable operators to set aside channels for leased 
access programming that they were forbidden to censor.  
<p>
	The Act also recognized that public access or PEG channels 
were required by many local cable franchise agreements, and 
prohibited cable operators from interfering with the editorial 
content of public access programming.  In essence, cable operators 
were not First Amendment "speakers" but simply conduits for free 
speech by citizens on public and leased access channels.
The 1984 Act also required operators to provide lockboxes that 
enable a subscriber to block any cable channel during selected 
periods.  This provision remains in effect.
<p>
	In 1992, Congress once again focused on the cable industry, 
this time primarily to promote diversity through temporary rate 
re-regulation, to address customer service practices, and to 
implement "must-carry" rules requiring cable transmission of 
broadcast television.
<p>
	On the last legislative day before the Senate approved this 
bill, Senator Jesse Helms and then-Senator Wynche Fowler offered 
two floor amendments that collectively became Section 10, entitled 
"Children's Protection from Indecent Programming on Leased Access 
Channels."  
<p>
<b>	Section 10: The Details:</b>
<p>
	Section 10, which was never sent to a committee and was never 
the subject of any hearings or findings, established a censorship 
scheme with four interlocking parts:
<p>
	 	Section 10(a) authorized cable operators to ban what 
they "reasonably believe describes or depicts sexual or excretory 
activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by 
contemporary community standards."
<p>
	 	Section 10(b) required the FCC to prescribe rules 
requiring cable operators that have not voluntarily prohibited 
programming under 10(a) to segregate all "indecent" leased access 
programming on channels that must remain blocked until 30 days 
after a subscriber requests access in writing.  Programmers must 
"certify in writing whether their shows are "indecent."
<p>
	 	Section 10(c) applies to public, educational and 
government (PEG) access channels and authorizes cable operators to 
ban "any programming which contains obscene materials, sexually 
explicit conduct" or "material that solicits or promotes unlawful 
conduct."   If  the operator does not ban PEG programming, it may 
cablecast the programming without blocking.
<p>
	 	Section 10(d) eliminates cable operators' immunity from 
liability for access programming that "involves obscene material."  
Taken together with the other provisions, it virtually compels 
cable operators to censor any access programming that might 
approach the definition of obscenity (a much narrower concept than 
"indecency.")  Given that many cable operators, such as Time 
Warner, will not want to risk prosecution, and in any event have no 
fondness for access channels, the end result will be a massive 
amount of censorship by cable operators and the loss of independent 
and innovative programming.  
<p>
	Before Section 10's enactment, federal law and many state and 
local laws prohibited cable operators from interfering in any 
manner with programming on access channels, regardless of content, 
because access channels' very raison d'etre is to establish a forum 
in which persons other than large media companies can speak to the 
public in one of the nation's most important forms of 
communication.  
<p>
<b>	Section 10 is Unconstitutional</b>
<p>
	Senator Helms attempted, through Section 10, to craft 
anti-"indecency" laws that would escape First Amendment scrutiny by 
placing censorship authority largely in the hands of the cable 
operators and imposing stiff penalties for failure to censor 
"indecent" programming.  But such a joint enterprise between 
government and private actors is subject to constitutional 
scrutiny.  And when subjected to well-settled First Amendment 
standards, Section 10 fails.  
<p>

<b>	 	Section 10 Encourages Content-Based Censorship and 
Therefore  is Subject to Constitutional Review </b>
<p>
		Congress cannot authorize cable operators to censor 
"indecent" speech on access channels any more than it can authorize 
cable operators to censor speech by African Americans or socialists 
or speech opposing reduction of welfare grants.  The fact that 
cable operators are private companies does change the 
constitutional standard because the companies may censor only under 
the authority of Congress.  All statutes are subject to 
constitutional review. 
<p>

<b>	 	Section 10 is not the least restrictive means of 
screening minors from "indecent" material</b>
<p>
		Congress' existing requirement of lockboxes already 
satisfies the government's asserted interest in protecting children 
from "indecency," particularly in light of cable's status as an 
invitee in the home for which the user pays a monthly fee. In the 
brief hours that the amendment was considered, Senator Helms failed 
to present evidence that lockboxes are no longer a sufficient means 
of facilitating parental protection of children, or to consider any 
other less restrictive alternatives, such as blocking programming 
on subscriber request.
<p>

<b>	 	Cable programmers are entitled to free speech 
protections </b>
<p>
		Section 10 requires programmers to certify that they 
will identify "any programming that is indecent" on pain of a 
draconian array of sanctions that include financial penalties and 
disqualification from access programming in the future.  Cable 
programmers engage in and transmit speech, and as such are entitled 
to the protections of the speech and press provisions of the First 
Amendment.  The levying of fines and other penalties, not to 
mention the direct censorship by cable operators, will undoubtedly 
have a chilling effect on free speech.  
<p>

<b>	 	The law authorizes censorship under impermissibly vague 
standards  </b>
<p>

		Given Section 10's extraordinarily sweeping definition 
of "indecency," the law imperils speech of substantial artistic, 
literary, scientific, medical, educational and social importance: 
speech that is protected not only for adults but for teenagers as 
well.  Cable operators, faced with fines and other penalties, will 
be strongly inclined to censor any speech that they might 
"reasonably believe" to be "patently offensive," according to 
"community standards." 
<p>

<b>	 	The law is impermissibly underinclusive, because it 
blocks only speech by leased access programmers.  </b>
<p>
		Irrationally, even though a cable operator is required 
to block a purportedly "indecent" leased access program, the 
operator is entirely free to cablecast that same program on one of 
its own cable channels.
<p>
<b>	Conclusion</b>
<p>
	The leased access cable medium represents a vital and unique 
environment for protected speech that is seriously endangered by 
the unconstitutional provisions of the 1992 Cable Act.   
Just as government-sanctioned clearcutting of forest lands  has 
contributed to soil erosion and endangered wildlife habitats, the 
recent concentration of the broadcast and cable mediums (through 
so-called deregulation), coupled with broad censorship schemes, is 
eroding the public's access to a diversity of information sources 
and putting constitutionally protected speech in jeopardy.  
<p>
	The indecency standard is so impossibly vague and undefinable 
that it will undoubtedly create an environment in which any 
"questionable" programming will be axed.  Whether acting  through 
direct legislation or in partnership with private industry, 
government does not have the right to cut down the Constitution.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
Thursday, February 8, 1996 </b>
<p>
        
 RENO -- The case of Pat Lee, a McQueen High student disciplined for
 publishing an underground newspaper, was settled on Wednesday, February 7, at
 a meeting between attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union and the
 Washoe County School District. 
<p> 
 According to the agreement, the School District will withdraw its request to
 have Pat Lee transferred to another high school.  Lee has agreed to submit a
 retraction and apology to the official school paper.  And, both parties
 agreed that it is in the best interest of all concerned that Lee will perform
 a positive service that will utilize his talents and benefit McQueen High
 School and the District.  
 <p>
 The matter was to go before a school district hearing officer on Friday.
  However, with the aid of a mediator, they arrived at a mutually acceptable
 resolution.  
 <p>
 ACLU cooperating attorney Patrick Gilbert stated, "We are pleased to have
 been able to work this out with the school district.  The agreement probably
 saved the town a lot of money.  And, Pat Lee gets to go back to McQueen High
 with his First Amendment rights."

Test Case Challenge to the Military's Ban on Gays Argued Before Federal Appeals Court in New York
</h2>
</center>
<b>
<p>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
Tuesday, January 16, 1996</b>
<p>
NEW YORK   Moving closer to a widely anticipated ruling by the United
States Supreme
Court, a constitutional challenge to the Clinton Administration's ban on gays
in the military was
argued today before a  federal appeals court in New York. 
</p>

<p>  The case, Able v. USA, is the first case to directly challenge the law
barring lesbians and gay
men from openly serving in the military.  Brought on behalf of six service
members, the lawsuit
contends that the so-called &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; legislation is
discriminatory, based on prejudice,
and in violation of free speech and equal protection. 
</p>

<p>  &quot;It's shocking that, in 1995, the government is still arguing that it can
discriminate against
lesbians and gay men simply because some harbor biases against us,&quot; said
Beatrice Dohrn, legal
director of Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, which brought the case
jointly with the
American Civil Liberties Union.  &quot;The government admits that the ban isn't
about the ability of
lesbians and gay men to serve.  The question now is, does the Constitution
allow the government to
force us into the closet, because that's where many prefer us to remain.&quot;
</p>

<p>  &quot;This ban, like its predecessor, is at war with the most basic assumptions
of our Constitution,&quot;
said Matthew Coles, director of the ACLU's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project.
  &quot;Laws designed to
discriminate, with no justification except to coddle some people's
prejudices, can not pass
constitutional muster and must be struck down.&quot;
</p>

<p>  Arguments in the case were heard before a three-judge panel of the Second
Circuit Court of
Appeals comprised of Judge Wilfred Feinberg, a Johnson appointee, Judge
Pierre N. Leval, a Clinton
appointee, and Judge John M. Walker, Jr., a Bush appointee.  The appeal was
initially scheduled for
argument on Dec. 19th, but one of judges assigned to hear the case recused
himself at the last minute
in order to avoid any appearance of partiality.
</p>

<p>  The challenge is on appeal from a federal district court in Brooklyn, which
dealt a major blow
to the military's new ban in March.  The lower court ruled that the law
violated the First and Fifth Amendments, and was based solely on the fears
and prejudices of heterosexual troops. 
</p>

<p>  &quot;Congress may not enact discriminatory legislation because it desires to
insulate heterosexual
service members from statements that might excite their prejudices,&quot; wrote
Judge Eugene Nickerson
in a sharply-worded decision striking down the ban.   &quot;The Supreme Court has
held that the First Amendment will not countenance the proscription of the
expression of an idea because others find
it repugnant.&quot;
</p>

<p>  The current ban -- which subjects lesbians and gay servicemembers to
discharge if they say or
do anything that reflects their sexual orientation -- marked the first time
the military's discriminatory
policy was codified into law.  
</p>

<p>  Signed by President Clinton in November 1993 as  a &quot;political compromise&quot;
with Congress,  the
law sought to modify the previous 1981 guidelines, under which 17,000 service
members were
discharged, at a cost of $500 million to taxpayers, according to a study
issued by the General
Accounting Office.
</p>

<p>  But the new ban has done very little to change how service members become
the subject of
discharge proceedings when fellow officers suspect that they are gay or
lesbian, say military
observers.  In fact, the text of the regulations remains largely unchanged.
</p>

<p>  In place of guidelines stating that &quot;homosexuality is incompatible with
military service,&quot; the
current law holds that open lesbians and gay men pose &quot;an unacceptable threat
to the high standards
of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence
of military capability.&quot;
</p>

<p>  The six plaintiffs in the case come from a variety of ranks and military
branches: Lieutenant
Colonel Jane Able (a pseudonym), Petty Officer Robert Heigl, First Lieutenant
Kenneth Osborn,
Sergeant Steven Spencer, Lieutenant Richard von Wohld, and Seaman Werner
Zehr.  They were not
facing discharge proceedings when the case was brought
</p>

<p>  Although a ruling in this case is not likely to be handed down for several
months, the U.S.
Supreme Court --which has never before examined the issue -- is expected to
take up the law as early
as next year.  Another case in Virginia, Thomasson v. Perry, in which the
ACLU and Lambda filed
an amicus brief, is also making its way up through the courts, as is Phillips
v. Perry in Washington
State.
</p>

<p>  &quot;The military's ban on gays is explicit government-sanctioned prejudice,&quot;
said Lambda's Dohrn. 
&quot;We are determined to end this chapter of American history.  Policies based
on prejudice should
never be given the power of law.&quot;
</p>

<p>  &quot;In America, we don't pass laws that single out one group of citizens for
discrimination in order
to make another group more comfortable,&quot; said the ACLU's Coles.  &quot;But that is
what this law does:
it keeps lesbians and gay men, who are every bit as capable as heterosexuals,
out of the military just
because the government thinks they make some heterosexuals nervous.  That is
not acceptable.&quot;

December 19, 1995; Civil Rights Groups File Suit Against Santa Monica And LA Police For Widespread Violation of Miranda Rule

Civil Rights Groups File Suit Against Santa Monica And LA Police For Widespread Violation of Miranda Rule</h2>
</center>
<b>
<p>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
December 19, 1995<p></b>

     The ACLU Foundation of Southern California, on behalf of California
Attorneys for Criminal Justice, Criminal Courts Bar Association and two
individuals, filed a major lawsuit [California Attorneys for Criminal Justice
v. Butts 95-8634 IH] in U. S. District Court today, charging the Santa Monica
and Los Angeles police departments with extensive violation of the Miranda
rule which says police must not question suspects in their custody after they
have invoked their right to legal counsel.
<p>
     "Los Angeles and Santa Monica police departments treat the Miranda
warning with a wink and a grin," said Mark Rosenbaum, legal director of the
ACLU Foundation of Southern California. "This is the Dirty Harry school of
interrogation."
<p>
     In its 1966 decision in Miranda vs. Arizona, the U.S. Supreme Court said
that in-custody interrogation of criminal suspects "exacts a heavy toll on
individual liberty and trades on the weakness of individuals."  As a result,
officers must give the familiar Miranda warning before questioning.  If a
person asks to see a lawyer, all questioning must cease.  Officers are
violating Miranda by continuing to question after a suspect asks for a
lawyer.  
<p>
     Last November, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, for the third time in three
years, that police may not ignore the right of an in-custody suspect to
remain silent and seek legal counsel, reversing a tendency of the high court
to favor police and prosecutors.
<p>
     The lawsuit seeks to enjoin the Los Angeles and Santa Monica Police
departments from the unlawful policy and practice of evading Miranda, by
continuing to question suspects after they have requested counsel and the
right to remain silent.  The suit charges that not only have police in these
departments violated the Miranda rule, but they have done so with the full
knowledge and consent of department leadership.
<p>
     "The invocation of Miranda is a clear and unambiguous signal for the
police to cease any and all interrogation," said Vicki Podberesky,a member of
the Board of Governors of California Attorneys for Criminal Justice. "There
is evidence to suggest that police improperly cajole individuals to answer
questions, by misinforming them that answers made outside Miranda will not be
used  against them in court when the contrary is true."
<p>
     The complaint, filed in federal court, quotes a defendant officer
telling a suspect, "I don't trust anything that anybody tells me after
they've talked to an attorney...As far as I'm concerned, they really mess up
the system."
<p>
     Criminal Courts Bar Association President Rickard Santwier said, "We are
asking the court to require those who have sworn to enforce the laws to at
least follow the law."
<p>
     Attorneys said that police must be trained to uphold Miranda, and
disciplined if they violate the rule.  Because Miranda violations are
widespread, attorneys said that results of this lawsuit will influence police
policy and practice nationally.

<center><h2>New York Federal Appeals Court Postpones
Test Case Challenge to Military's Ban on Gays</h2>

<P>
<b>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
December 19,1995</b>
<p>
NEW YORK - A test case challenge to the military's ban on lesbians and gay
men was postponed today when a federal appeals court judge excused himself
from the case.
<p>
The case, Able v. USA, is the first case to challenge in its entirety the law
banning lesbians and gay men from openly serving in the armed forces.
Brought jointly by the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund on behalf of six servicemembers, the lawsuit
contends that the so-called "don't ask, don't tell" legislation is
discriminatory, based solely on prejudice, and in violation of free speech
and equal protection.
<p>
Although the case was scheduled for argument today, Judge Guido Callabresi
recused himself from the appeal this morning to avoid any appearance of
partiality.  While Dean of the Yale Law School, Callabresi was among 119
legal scholars who signed onto a March 1993 letter that voiced constitutional
concerns about the military's ban.  Government lawyers had raised the issue
to the court's clerks in a letter dated today.
<p>
Apparently, the two other members on the panel, Judges Pierre N. Leval and
Wilfred Feinberg, will remain on the case, A new hearing date will likely be
announced in early January after a replacement is selected.

</h2>
</center>
<br>
<b>
<P>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
September 27, 1995</b>
<P>
     WASHINGTON -- As in September 1994, the Supreme Court has surely not yet
filled its docket of criminal, habeas and capital cases. In light of past
years' trends, however, one can make some reasonable judgments about the
subjects that interest the Court, which are likely to surface in matters
granted certiorari when the 1995 Term opens, and about the probable
disposition of some of the  matters already pending. 
<P>
     At this point, the Justices have agreed to hear two death penalty habeas
cases; both raise significant questions. In Thompson v. Keohane, the Court
will decide whether a state court's determination that a defendant was not in
"custody" for purposes of Miranda's protections poses a legal or a factual
issue. 
<P>
     If upheld, the Ninth Circuit's characterization of the issue as factual
would largely insulate findings on custody from federal review since the
habeas statute accords a presumption of correctness to state court findings
of fact in most situations. By contrast, purely legal questions and mixed
questions of law and fact have traditionally received de novo examination in
habeas.  Decisions of the past decade declining to pin the "fact" label on
such critical determinations as the voluntariness of a confession suggest
that the Court may hold the line against this latest attempt to curtail
federal scrutiny of state convictions. 
<P>
     Lonchar v. Thomas, the other capital appeal on the docket, involves an
Eleventh Circuit holding vacating a stay because the petitioner had engaged
in abusive conduct by consistently waiting until the eleventh hour to seek
judicial relief. The primary legal issue presented is whether a first habeas
petition, as opposed to a subsequent filing, may be rejected for this reason.
<P>
     The prisoner's apparent mental illness complicates matters, as does the
fact that he has admittedly asserted his claims solely in order to delay
execution long enough for the legislature to consider replacing electrocution
by lethal injection -- so that the might donate his organs after death.
Lonchar's idiosyncratic motive may well dispose the Court against him. On the
merits, however, he ought to win since no decision has ever blocked an
initial petition on the grounds of misuse of the writ. 
<P>
     Whatever the results in Thompson and Lonchar, it is fair to say that the
Rehnquist Court has recently softened its generally implacable stance toward
habeas. Last Term, for example, the justices ruled in O'Neal v. McAninch that
a habeas court in "grave doubt" whether a trial error was harmless must grant
the writ, thereby placing the burden of proof on the state to establish lack
of prejudice. 
<P>
     Notably, Justice Breyer's opinion elevated the role of habeas in
avoiding imprisonment of the innocent over the usually emphasized interest in
ensuring the finality of convictions. The same concern animated two other
1994 Term decisions: Schlup v. Delo, which rejected the state's effort to
create a very stringent standard of miscarriage of justice, sufficient to
surmount procedural barriers to habeas review, and Kyles v. Whitley, which
granted the writ in a fact-bound case where the prisoner may very well have
been framed. 
<P>
     Ironically, the Court is becoming more receptive to habeas just when the
new Republican Congress seeks to cripple it once and for all. The House and
Senate bills passed this spring contain provisions calling for very strong
deference to determinations by state courts of pure or mixed questions of
law. 
<P>
     If enacted, such legislation would essentially moot the Thomas question
since it would render unimportant the distinction between legal and factual
issues. More significant, it would overrule Brown v. Allen (1953), the
landmark decision which established the principle that habeas courts must
independently determine and apply federal constitutional standards. And it
would do so notwithstanding the Court's refusal, twice during the last three
years (in Wright v. West (1992) and Withrow v. Williams (1993), to abandon
Brown. 
<P>
     A third case that implicates civil liberties concerns is Rutledge v.
United States. It poses the question whether the double jeopardy clause bars
entering judgments of conviction and concurrent sentences on two counts --
engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise (CCE) and conspiring to possess
with intent to distribute a controlled substance -- where the conduct
underlying the conspiracy constitutes a necessary element of the CCE charge. 
<P>
     Rutledge is important less in itself than as a sign that the Court has
not relinquished its interest in double jeopardy. The last decade has
produced numerous decisions in the area, some protective of defendants' rights and others not. 
<P>
     Additional fields that have recently occupied the Court's attention
include both search and seizure and mens rea requirements in federal crimes.
Although the justices have not agreed to hear any such cases thus far, they
are likely to do so later this Term. 
<P>
     And if historical trends persist, the Fourth Amendment will continue to
shrivel -- as it did last Term, when the Court sustained suspicionless drug
tests of high-school athletes (Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton (1995))
and held that the exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence seized on
account of a warrant that had been quashed and remained in the computer
because of an error by court employees (Arizona v. Evans (1995)). By
contrast, in any future decisions on criminal intent, the Court will probably
reject the notion of strict liability -- as it has done in a number of
decisions in the past few years. 
<P>

ACLU Challenges Public Funding of Religious Schools in Wisconsin;
        Suit Seeks to Stop Vouchers Before School Year
</h2>

<br>
<b>
<P>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
August 1, 1995</b>
<P>
     MADISON, WI -- Acting on behalf of parents and religious groups, the
American Civil Liberties Union today filed suit in Dane County Circuit Court
challenging Wisconsin's school vouchers law, which would, if upheld, provide
public funding to parochial schools. 
<P>
     Today's lawsuit challenges a law signed on July 26 by Gov. Tommy
Thompson that would expand  the state's "Schools Choice" program to include
religious schools. The law would provide direct state aid to religious
schools -- including grades kindergarten through 12th -- who would then use
that state taxpayer money to support religious education. The ACLU lawsuit
marks the first legal challenge to a state school vouchers program brought in
the continental United States.
<P>
     "This law crosses the line the U.S. Supreme Court has drawn limiting
government assistance to religious education," said Peter Koneazny, Legal
Director of the ACLU of Wisconsin.  "We are seeking to block this law because
we believe in religious freedom, as provided by the U.S. and the Wisconsin
state constitutions."
<P>
     In the lawsuit, the ACLU cited a section of the Wisconsin Constitution
that promises that tax money will not be used to fund religious schools and
that no person "shall be compelled to support any place of worship, or to
maintain any ministry without consent."
<P>
     "In drafting this country's constitution, the founders understood that
religious freedom is guaranteed by keeping government out of religion," said
Steven R. Shapiro, Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union.
<P>
     Chris Ahmuty, Executive Director of the ACLU of Wisconsin Foundation,
said he hopes the court will rule on the injunction before school is set to
begin.
<P>
     "It is unfortunate that a program with such serious constitutional
problems was rushed through the legislature and signed so hastily," Ahmuty
said. "The governor knew this program would instantly be challenged in court,
yet he seemed to have given little thought to the inconvenience and
disruption this may cause Wisconsin parents and children."
<P>
     The action was brought today by 12 individual taxpayers, including
parents and religious leaders, who oppose the program on religious freedom
grounds.  The plaintiffs will also file a motion asking the court to issue an
injunction delaying any payments to religious schools until the courts can
rule on the constitutional issues.
<P>
     In a similar challenge last year, the Puerto Rican Supreme Court struck
down a school voucher program that provided any family with an annual income
of less than $18,000 to a $1,500 voucher that could be used to subsidize the
cost of private school tuition, including parochial school. In its decision
on November 30, 1994, the Court held that the program violated a provision of
the Puerto Rican Constitution that prohibits the use of public funds to
support private schools.  While the Court did not explicitly address the
federal constitution's Establishment Clause, it found that a voucher program
is a form of government support.
<P>
     The plaintiffs in today's challenge are represented by the Peter
Koneazny of the ACLU of Wisconsin; Steven R. Shapiro, Legal Director of the
national American Civil Liberties Union, and Steven Green, Legal Director of
Americans United for Separation of Church and State.  Lead counsel on the
case are attorneys Jeffrey Kassel and Melanie Cohen of the Madison law firm
of LaFollette & Synykin.

<b>
<P>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
August 1, 1995</b>
<P>
      WASHINGTON -- In written testimony submitted to the two House
subcommittees holding Waco hearings, the American Civil Liberties Union has
asked Congress to create a national commission to comprehensively review
federal law enforcement policies and practices.
<P>
     "There has been an enormous growth of federal law enforcement over the
years so that federal police now comprise close to 10 percent of the nation's
law enforcement," the ACLU testimony said. "These federal officers work in 53
separate federal agencies in which law enforcement officers have the
authority to carry firearms and make arrests.
<P>
     "This represents an enormous expansion in recent years," the ACLU said,
"of both personnel and jurisdiction. What is lacking, however, is systematic
oversight and review of federal law enforcement practices."
<P>
      The ACLU and nine other organizations had requested creation of a
national commission in a January 1994 letter to President Clinton. Among the
issues the ACLU suggests need review by a commission are:
<P>
       -- The appropriate use of para-military and strike force units or
tactics.
       -- The use of "no knock" and "dynamic entry" tactics
       -- The use of unreliable informants and the process of verifying their
allegations.
       -- Apparent presentation of misleading and inaccurate information by
federal agents in an effort to obtain a warrant.
       -- Inadequate process for investigating complaints of misconduct and
apparent failure to appropriately discipline federal agents who have acted
improperly.
<P>
      According to the ACLU, the new commission would be similar to the
Wickersham Commission appointed by President Hoover in 1929. The Wickersham
Commission report stimulated major law enforcement reforms, including curbing
the use of the "third degree" to extract confessions. Another model cited by
the ACLU is the Citizens Advisory Panel recently created by Immigration and
Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner to advise her regarding
the problem of abuse by Border Patrol agents.
<P>
      The ACLU concluded that the Waco hearing and other hearings "have been
useful in highlighting ongoing questions about federal law enforcement
practices."
<P>
       "The next step," the ACLU said, "should be creation of a mechanism
that could begin to review these practices at issue here in a systematic
way."

<b>
<P>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
July 26, 1995</b>
<P>
       PITTSBURGH --  Jane Doe, who in early June sued the Peters Township
School District to stop planned graduation prayers, said today that she has
decided to discontinue the case.
<P>
      The suit resulted in an agreement on the eve of graduation that the
school district would cancel a planned invocation and benediction.  At the
graduation, however, four students read the planned invocation, a sectarian
prayer, raising public controversy.
<P>
     In her statement, Jane Doe expressed the hope that the district will
continue to recognize, as it did in the court-approved agreement, "that
scheduled student prayer [is] not appropriate at "high school commencement
ceremon[ies] . . . and other school ceremonies."  In explaining why she
decided to discontinue the suit, Ms. Doe said: 
<P>
          "To pursue this issue further would require lengthy legal dealings.
I           do not wish to involve the four student speakers any more, as
they           are all starting new lives in college.  It is my hope that as
they           continue their education, they will encounter persons of
diverse           viewpoints --  religious and otherwise -- which may give
them a new           perspective on the issue."
<P>
     The American Civil Liberties Union, which has been representing Ms. Doe
and her daughter, expressed support for the decision.  Witold Walczak, the
ACLU-Pittsburgh's Executive Director, called Ms. Doe a "very courageous woman
who stood tall for an important constitutional principle in the face of
tremendous opposition."  Walczak cautioned, however, that the discontinuance
should not be misinterpreted by school districts as a retreat by the ACLU on
the issue of graduation school prayer: "The Pittsburgh Chapter of the ACLU
has sued school districts successfully in each of the past three years to
stop student-led graduation prayers, and, if necessary, we will continue to
file similar suits in the future to stop this unconstitutional practice."   
<P>
     In response to the school district's claim that the students were only
exercising their free speech rights, Walczak replied: "Commencement exercises
are not platforms for free speech -- school districts routinely prohibit and
censor hate speech, comments critical of the school, vulgarity and anything
else that may be an embarrassment at graduation.  Peters is no different:
freedom of speech is not a quality normally encouraged at Peters Township
commencements, where student speeches are carefully scrutinized ahead of time
and proper behavior and dress are defined and monitored to an extreme degree.
Under these circumstances, permitting prayer is giving preferential treatment
to religious speech, which is a violation of the constitutional ban on
promoting religion."  
<P>
     Walczak said he hopes to have another opportunity in the near future to
litigate the tension between free speech and separation of church and state:
"Student speakers, properly placed on the program for secular reasons, may
make personal expressions of faith.  They may not, in the name of free
speech, engage the audience in a group religious exercise, such as prayer."
<P>
       Jane Doe:Statement Closing The School Prayer Case.
<P>
     Peters Township School District, in signing the original
     agreement, agreed that scheduled student prayer was not
     appropriate at the school commencement ceremony.
<P>
     We assume that having recognized this fact this year, district
     officials will continue to recognize it in future commencements
     and other school ceremonies.  The school districts surrounding
     Peters Township showed this spring that commencements can
     feature meaningful welcomes, farewells and advice to graduates
     without prayers.  These included such school districts as Upper
     St. Clair, Mt. Lebanon, Canon-McMillan, Bethel Park and
     Washington.
<P>
     As a result of this legal action, important issues have been raised
     and will continue to be discussed in this community. 
     Consciousness has certainly been heightened about the proper
     respect for all persons' religious beliefs.  We look to the
     Ministerium and the school district to continue the discussion in

       ACLU Plans to Appeal Reversal of Juvenile Hall Lawsuit

<P>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
July 25, 1995</b>
<P>
     SAN DIEGO -- Saying that it was profoundly disappointed, the ACLU of San
Diego and Imperial County today said the Fourth Distrcit California Court of
Appeals has overturned a 1992 San Diego Superior Court ruling ordering San
Diego County to improve conditions at its Juvenile Hall.
<P>
      The ACLU said that even though the Appellate District three-judge panel
agreed that the conditions at the jail were harmful, it unanimously sided
with the County Board of Supervisors who challenged the Superior Court's
authority to order improvements at the Juvenile Hall facility.
<P>
      The ACLU and the San Diego Volunteer Lawyer Program, which had filed a
lawsuit in 1990 asking the court to require the country to limit the
population of the facility and to improve conditions there, said today that
they would soon file a motion for a rehearing with the appellate court. If
that motion is denied, they said, they will appeal the case to the California
Supreme Court.
<P>
       "This appellate decision is a profound disappointment with untold
ramifications for the thousands of children, most not convicted of any crime,
detained at Juvenile Hall," said Linda Hills, Executive Director of the ACLU
of San Diego and Imperial Counties.
<P>
       In its decision, the State Appeal Court found that "...the trial
court's statement of decision accurately portrays conditions at juvenile hall
as they existed at the time of trial. The appeals court also agreed that
every day the community "...loses valuable opportunities to protect itself
from future harm because ... we have not devoted more resources to the
services provided at juvenile hall." 
<P>
        Nevertheless, the panel said its only disagreement with the Superior
Court decision was its conclusion that courts are competent to provide a
remedy for such lost opportunities. "We," the appeal court said, "are not." 
<P>
         Jordan Budd, staff counsel of the ACLU of San Diego and Imperial
Counties, said the appeal court "has abdicated its responsibility to
safeguard the constitutional interests of the young people of San Diego
County."
<P>
          "We disagree that the courts have no role to play in correcting the
situation at Juvenile Hall," Budd said. "We will appeal the decision and hope
a higher court will breathe life back into the constitutional rights at
stake.
<P>
          "The decision renders the Constitution a dead letter with regard to
these young people,' Budd added. "It is wrong and it is tragic."
<P>
           Timothy Taylor of the San Diego Volunteer Lawyer Program said that
"legal standards of review require that appellate courts must defer to
factual findings of the trial court. It is disappointing that the appeal
court based its ruling on how Judge O'Neill expressed himself rather than on
evidence of unconstitutional violations of the rights of children whose last
refuge is the courts."
<P>
        Superior Court Judge O'Neill ruled in October 1992 that the county
must take affirmative steps to improve Juvenile Hall, including:
<P>
        -- a population cap of 395 in the facility and caps on the number of
children per room.
<P>
        -- mandatory ratios of staff to residents.
<P>
        -- improved screening and evalution of suspected mental illness.
<P>
        -- a maximum of 15-day period in which minors may be held before
beginning court ordered treatment.
<P>
        In addition, the court ordered the county to begin long-term plans
for structural and funding measures to bring about the improvements.

"ACLU To Sue To Block State Funding of Religious Schools"

<P>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
July 5, 1995</b>
<P>
MILWAUKEE -- The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin (ACLU/WI) and
the national ACLU today announced that they will challenge the expansion of
the current Milwaukee private school choice program to include religious day
schools.  The ACLU seeks to defend religious liberty by preventing a
violation of the principle of separation of church and state. 
<P>
The state budget soon to be signed by Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson would
provide direct aid to K-12 religious schools who would then use taxpayer
dollars to fund their mission of religious education.  The budget removes the
prohibition against religious schools participating in the current
non-sectarian private school choice program. 
<P>
Under the new plan, which is to be implemented in the 1995-96 school year,
approximately 7,000 students could attend religious schools in Milwaukee at
taxpayer expense.  The amount of their subsidy would equal the amount spent
per pupil by the Milwaukee Public Schools.  Students currently attending MPS,
a current choice school, or, if in grades K-3, a religious school in the City
of Milwaukee, will be allowed apply to religious schools for admission.  
<P>
The ACLU/WI will sue on behalf of a group of Milwaukee plaintiffs who object
to the proposed subsidy because any violation of the principle of separation
of church and state is offensive to religious liberty.
<P>
     The lead counsels in the case will be ACLU/WI Foundation volunteer
attorneys Jeffrey Kassel and Melanie Cohen from the Madison law firm of
LaFollette & Sinykin.  Also, representing the plaintiffs will be ACLU/WIF
legal director Peter M. Koneazny and national ACLU legal director Steven R.
Shapiro.  
<P>
"This case is about religious liberty," said Chris Ahmuty, Executive Director
of the ACLU of Wisconsin Foundation, "It is a mistake to characterize this as
a debate about anything else.  As a supporter of quality education for all
children, the ACLU objects to funding religious schools with taxpayer dollars
period.  We cannot sacrifice religious liberty on the altar of an unproven
experiment that confers a direct benefit on any religious faith, sect or
cult." 
<P>
     The ACLU anticipates filing the case shortly after Governor Thompson
signs the budget, and the July 15 deadline for religious schools to indicate
their intention to participation in the program. 
<P>
     In another development the ACLU/WIF is also filing an amicus brief in a
case pending at the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in
which the plaintiffs have challenged the current non-sectarian private school
choice program because it does not allow for the participation of religious
schools.  On March 14, 1995 federal district judge John W. Reynolds decided
that, "The present state of First Amendment law compels this court to hold
that the plaintiffs's request to expand the current Choice Program to make
tuition reimbursements directly payable to religious private schools who
admit eligible Choice Program schoolchildren would violate the Establishment
Clause."  The ACLU/WI maintains that there is no significant difference
between the plaintiffs' request in the pending case on appeal and the
proposal in the state budget.

ACLU of VA Warns Schools About Prayers at Graduation Ceremonies
Says It Will Sue Those That Do Not Follow The Law</h2>

<P>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>
June 6, 1995</b>
<P>
     RICHMOND, VA -- The ACLU of Virginia is sending letters today to every
public school superintendent in Virginia, advising them not to allow
organized prayers at their upcoming graduation ceremonies.
<P>
     The ACLU said it is particularly concerned that without other guidance,
schools will follow the advice contained in the Preliminary Guidelines on
Religious Activity in Public Schools, a document that was distributed by the
State Board of Education this spring.
<P>
      Although these guidelines have not yet been officially adopted, they
contain erroneous advice on so-called class-initiated prayers and
individually initiated prayers at graduation ceremonies that could be
followed by graduation planners.
<P>
      In the case of class-initiated prayers, the ACLU says it will sue any
school that violates Gearon v. Loudoun County, the 1994 decision from the
Alexandria Federal District Court banning all formal prayers at graduation
programs, whether organized by students or school administrators. The
Preliminary Guidelines ignore Gearon and advise schools that formal prayers
are acceptable on graduation programs when the senior class votes to have
them and the prayers are delivered by students.
<P>
      Individually initiated prayers by a student speaker may be permissible,
the ACLU said, but only in instances where the school has completely
relinquished control over the student's speech. The ACLU warns schools not to
edit, approve or even review such speeches in advance because of the danger
of the appearance of endorsement of any prayer which may be part of them. If
a school wishes to maintain its traditional role in determining the content
of student speeches, it must not allow prayers to be part of the speech.
<P>
(The text of the two-page letter to superintendents will be available in
Constitution Hall soon.)

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
May 25, 1995</b>
<P>
BUCKHANNON, WV -- The West Virginia Civil Liberties Union goes to court on
Tuesday, May 30, in Clarksburg to argue that schools should not be used as a
site for local merchants to distribute bibles.
<P>
The Upshur County school board decided in February to allow local religious
groups to set up tables in all the county's schools to distribute Bibles.
Several parents and students complained to the West Virginia Civil Liberties
Union, said Hilary Chiz, Executive Director of the statewide affiliate of the
national ACLU.
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Irene Keeley ruled in favor of the students and
parents, granting a preliminary injunction to halt the distribution plan on
February 24. A hearing on the case is scheduled for Tuesday, May 30.
<P>
"We don't have a problem with Bibles being distributed on private property,
or even in the Kroger parking lot," said Chiz. "But once anyone crosses that
threshhold and tries to use the schools, they violate the Establishment
Clause of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
<P>
"There is no reason to bring stacks of Bibles into the schools," Chiz said.
"The school libraries already have copies that are made available to anyone.
This plan is clearly just another way to get to students, who are easy
targets for religious extremists because they are all in one place --
school."
<P>
The West Virginia Civil Liberties hopes the ruling will permanently halt the
Bible distribution plan. The students and parents are represented by WVCLU
cooperating attorneys Bob Bastress and Allan Karlin of Morgantown.

<h2>First International Survey of Prayer in Schools Finds That World's Major Countries Reject State- Sanctioned School Prayer</h2>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<b>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
May 16, 1995<P></b>

    LOS ANGELES -- A school prayer amendment to the U.S. Constitution being
pushed by conservative groups and Republicans would put the United States
squarely at odds with most of the world's nations, according to an
international survey issued today by the ACLU of Southern California.
<P>
     Only two of 72 countries surveyed currently have school prayer policies
such as those proposed by conservative religious groups and political leaders
in Washington, the ACLU researchers found in what is believed to be the first
international survey ever conducted.
<P>
     Moreover, the proposal to reinstate state-sanctioned prayer in American
public schools contradicts an international trend toward greater separation
of religion and public education. The plan to amend the Constitution to
permit state-sanctioned prayer is expected to advance this week with release
of a legislative proposal by the conservative Christian Coalition.
<P>
     The ACLU study also noted that the traditional American insistence on
strict guarantees of freedom to choose one's religious beliefs without
government interference has resulted in the United States having the highest
levels of professed religious faith of any industrialized nation.
<P>
      "Our nation's spiritual health is founded on the right of both persons
and groups to practice and worship as they see fit," said the Reverend James
Lawson of the Holman United Methodist Church. "To mandate how people may
invoke the deity is inherently un-American. Attempts to force students to
pray are wrong. People of faith must unite in opposing attempts to force one
religious point of view in our public classrooms."
<P>
     Rabbi Allen Freehling of University Synagogue said: "Attempts to
Christianize the American public classroom ostracizes not only non-Christian
children, but Christian children with different religious customs and
beliefs. There is no such thing as completely ecumenical prayer or meditation
because of the different ways that people approach God. State-mandated school
prayer excludes and divides students. Those who profess freedom of religion
cannot support prayer in schools."
<P>
      The proposal by the Christian Coalition and Republican congressional
leadership is in stark contrast with recent actions in other countries to
separate church and state. For example, the ACLU survey found that Colombia
and South Africa have both moved forcefully to end state-mandated school
prayer since 1991. Colombia changed its constitution in 1991 to favor strict
separation of church and state, although the issue remains the subject of
divisive internal controversy.
<P>
     In South Africa, the new racially integrated government of President
Nelson Mandela has moved quickly to abolish mandatory school prayer and Bible
readings. Meanwhile, Mexico and Venezuela -- both strongly Roman Catholic
nations -- have continued to hold firmly against pressures to dilute
guarantees against imposing religion on school children through
state-sanctioned prayer.
<P>
     "There is a very strong message here that the American system works and
that it permits a strong, vibrant religious life in this country that could
not continue if the government meddles in this most personal of all issues,"
said Allan Parachinin, the ACLU of Southern California's public affairs
director who conducted the new survey.
<P>
     "Our findings about international practices governing state-sanctioned
school prayer show that even many countries with state religions or
fundamentalist governments do not go as far as to impose state-sanctioned
prayer on school children."
<P>
     Of 72 countries surveyed by the ACLU in December 1994 and January 1995,
only 11 nations retain any practice of state-sanctioned school prayer.
However, nine of those countries -- Finland, Greece, Libya, Nepal, Pakistan,
Saudi Arabia, Romania and Thailand -- either have state religions or
populations that are virtually homogeneous in terms of religious preference.
<P>
      Only two countries with any semblance of religious or racial
diversity--Great Britain and Sweden--permit state-sanctioned school prayer.
And in Great Britain, the practice has recently become controversial as
conservatives have sought to reinvigorate the status of the Church of England
as the country's official religion.
<P>
       Indeed, many countries where single religions dominate national life
have steered a careful course around imposing prayer in the schools. These
nations include Iran, Italy and Israel.
<P>
       Among other countries that reject state-sanctioned school prayer are
Egypt, Bahrain, Argentina, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iraq, Japan, Lebanon,
Kuwait, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Syria
and the United Arab Emirates.
<P>
       The survey also found that the six most diverse provinces of Canada,
including all portions of the country that enjoy signficant racial diversity,
reject state-sanctioned school prayer. Two Canadian provinces, Saskatchewan
and Newfoundland, permit school prayer but under circumstances that stop
short of expecting all children to participate in recitation of a single
prayer each day.
<P>
      "The vast majority of the major countries of the world, including
Western Europe, Central America and Asia, have rejected state-sponsored
prayer in their public school systems," the ACLU study concluded. "For
advocates of religious faith, the record of the United States speaks for
itself.
<P>
      "America chose a very different approach to religion, with the Founders
recognizing that, for religion to flourish here as they indended, the state
would have to stay out of it. Other countries have not chosen this path, but
still the vast majority of them have overwhelmingly endorsed the idea that
the public schools should not become houses of worship or put the stamp of
government approval on particular forms of worship."

<h2>ACLU Launches
<P>Letter to President<p></h2>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<b>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
May 15, 1995<p></b>
     This week, the Christian Coalition is expected to unveil a
set of legislative proposals marketed as a "Contract with the
American Family."  Its centerpiece is reported to be a proposed
constitutional amendment to protect "religious expression" in the
public schools.
<P>
     The American Civil Liberties Union urges you to reject this
proposal to tamper with the Constitution -- America's original
contract with the American family.
<P>
     The First Amendment has protected both religion and
religious liberty for 204 years.  It has permitted religion to
flourish in America as nowhere else.  Americans are among the
most religious people in the world.  In terms of per capita time
spent on religious devotion, money contributed and church
attendance, the United States ranks higher than any advanced
industrial nation.  According to a recent public opinion poll,
the United States ranked as one of the two highest nations in the
percentage of its population that believed in God.  The notion
that religion is failing in America, and needs the government's
assistance, is demonstrably false.
<P>
     Moreover, the United States enjoys a wide degree of
religious diversity with comparatively little religious
divisiveness.  The reason for this is the First Amendment, which
reflects the wisdom of keeping religion and politics separate. 
Without such separation, people of different religious beliefs
inevitably end up competing for government assistance and
support.  The mixture is inflammable.
<P>
     More than two hundred years ago, Thomas Jefferson
demonstrated how the government's intervention into the private
sphere of religious belief would, as he put it, be harmful to
both religion and religious freedom.  In a speech to the Virginia
House of Delegates, he declared that religion and religious
liberty would only flourish if the state had no authority to
adopt an official opinion in matters of religion.  Two centuries
of history has proved him right.
<P>
     Now comes an extreme proposal from the Christian Coalition
to overturn what has worked so well for so long.  We must resist
their radical overtures and renew our faith in the First
Amendment, which has served us so well.  True conservatives ought
to be conserving this 18th-century principle, instead of
radically transforming it.  If we move in the direction urged by
the Christian Coalition, we will likely plunge this country into
the kind of religious/political disputes that have so often
racked other countries.
<P>
     We urge you to keep several points in mind as you consider
this proposal:
<P>
     1.  Religious expression in public schools is already
protected by the First Amendment.
<P>
     If a child in public school wishes to say grace before
eating a meal in the school cafeteria, or carry a bible to school
to read in between classes, she has the right now under the First
Amendment to do so.  That is religious freedom.
<P>
     But if the school conducts an official grace before meals so
that every student in the cafeteria is subjected to it whether
she believes in it or not, that is not permitted by the First
Amendment because it reflects official government endorsement or
sponsorship of religion, and imposes religious beliefs on
children whose families may not share them.  This is true even if
the grace ceremony is "student initiated."  Individual rights
means that any student can say grace, but no student can be
subjected to a religious ceremony because the majority outvotes
her.  That is not religious freedom.  
<P>
     The Christian Coalition says it wants to protect "religious
expression" for individual students.  If so, no constitutional
amendment is needed because the First Amendment already protects
such individual expression.  A constitutional amendment is
required only if one wishes to overturn Supreme Court decisions
that have prevented the government, through its schools, from
imposing religious beliefs and ceremonies upon all students. 
That is the Christian Coalition's real agenda, as Pat Robertson's
writings make plain.  When the Christian Coalition says it only
wishes to protect individual religious expression, it is not
telling the truth.
<P>
     Individual students may express their religious beliefs now. 
But the public schools may not be turned into a church for a few
minutes each day so that the government, or a majority of
students, can impose religious ceremonies on all students.  That
is the right line to draw, and it is a line that the Christian
Coalition wants to erase.
<P>
     2.  Whose prayer will be said?
<P>
     If the Christian Coalition has its way, and school-wide
ceremonies are allowed to be conducted in public schools, whose
prayers will be dominant, and who will decide?
<P>
     Will Jewish children be required to submit to Christian
ceremonies?
<P>
     Will Moslem children be made to listen to Catholic rituals?
<P>
<P>
     Will Baptist parents be pleased if their children are
required to sit through Muslim ceremonies?
<P>
     Or will children of minority religions in any given school
be separated from their peers in order to permit the majority to
have its way?
<P>
     And whose forms of prayer will predominate?
<P>
     Muslims bow to Mecca several times a day.
<P>
     Pentecostals stand when praying.
<P>
     Catholics and Episcopalians kneel.
<P>
     Bahai refuse to bow their heads.
<P>
     Presbyterians bow their heads.
<P>
     Getting the government involved in making these choices is a
prescription for conflict.  Either religion will be drained of
all meaning in an attempt to avoid conflict or divisiveness will
be inevitable.  Either way, as Jefferson knew, it will be bad for
religion and bad for religious freedom.
<P>
     Most Americans who favor prayer in public schools imagine
their own form of prayer.  But will they be happy if their
children are forced to submit to forms of prayer that are not
their own?  
<P>
     3.  Getting the government off our backs.
<P>
     If there is any arena of the American family's life that
should be immunized from government interference it is religion
and the religious upbringing of children.  That is exclusively a
parental right.  Traditional family values require that the
government stay out of such parental prerogatives, and not use
the public schools to erode them.  Yet the Christian Coalition
proposes to amend the Constitution to allow the government to
tell American families how, when, where, whether and with whom
their children should pray?  What could be more inappropriate,
more radically intrusive?  That is why the Christian Coalition's
proposals are anything but conservative; they represent nothing
less than a radical intrusion of big brother government into the
American family's religious life.  
<P>
     The Christian Coalition calls its proposal a "Contract with
the American Family."  It should more accurately be called "The
Government Knows Best Act of 1995."
<P>
     Prayer should remain in the private domain.  As the apostle
Matthew wrote:
<P>
               And when thou prayest, thou shalt
               not be as the hypocrites are: for
               they love to pray ... in the
               streets, that they may be seen ... 
               But, thou, when thou prayest, pray
               to thy Father, which is in private
               ...
<P>
     The rights of individual students to freedom of religious
expression is already protected by the First Amendment.  What the
Christian Coalition wants is government-assisted prayer,
government-endorsed religion.  But the government that is given
the power to assist religion, also acquires the power to destroy
it.  And the government that assists one citizen's religion
hinders another citizen's religion.
<P>
     The Christian Coalition's proposal is dangerous and radical,
and diverts us from real problems the government should address.  
<P>
     We urge you to reject it.
<P>
     We urge you to conserve the First Amendment.
<P>
     We urge you to go about the proper business of government. 
Certainly we have enough real problems without manufacturing new
ones.

ACLU of Texas Files Lawsuit Defending Religious Freedom for Prisoners</h2>
</center>
<P>
<br>
<b>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
April 19, 1995</b>
<P>
      AUSTIN -- The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas announced today
that it was filing a lawsuit on behalf of 13 prisoners whose religious
freedom have been violated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
<P>
     "All people everywhere have a fundamental right to spiritual sustenance
and guidance," said ACLU cooperating attorney J. Patrick Wiseman, who is
handling the lawsuit. "It is a freedom no government ought to deny. But those
in prison have particular needs, and it is particularly distressing that, in
our free society, the State of Texas is denying these plaintiffs the freedom
of conscience we all hold so dear."
<P>
     The plaintiffs in the ACLU lawsuit practice various religions, including
Native American religion, Wiccan and Muslim. The suit alleges that the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice has deprived the plaintiffs of their religious
freedom guaranteed by the free speech and free exercise clauses of the First
Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
<P>
     Each plaintiff has been denied access to various religious materials,
many have had religious literature and articles destroyed or confiscated.
Some have been denied the right to perform religious rituals -- the Muslims
have been denied the right to attend Islamic services, the Native Americans
have been denied the right to grow their hair long, including the placing of
a plaintiff, Iron Thunderhorse, in solitary confinement and confiscating his
typewriter for his refusal to cut his hair.
<P>
     Plaintiff Ruby Mathews has been denied the right to study Wiccan redes,
religious literature written in runes, letters of the Ancient Germanic
alphabet, as well as other Wiccan religious literature.
<P>
      "Religious freedom, the ability to choose one's own spiritual path, is
at the core of our basic American liberties," said Jay Jacobson, the
Executive Director of the ACLU of Texas. "The history of mankind is so filed
with evidence of the evil caused by religious oppression and intolerance that
we could not turn away from this case.
<P>
      "As James Madison stated," Jacobson continued, "'The religion then of
every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and it
is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate. This right is
in its nature an unalienable right. We maintain therefore that in matters of
Religion, no man's right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society and
that Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance.'"
<P>
      The suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District, Austin
Division, names the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, the Texas Board of
Corrections and Institutional Division Director Wayne Scott as defendants and
Louis Armijo, David Davis, Larry Gagniere, Alvin Goodwin, Alvin Harrison,
Keith Jones, Noah Martinez, Ruby Mathews, Alex Montana, Dewayne Thomas, Iron
Thunderhorse, Patric Warner, and Charles Watkins as plaintiffs. Plaintiffs
come from institutions in Amarillo, Huntsville, Midway, Gatesville, Tennessee
Colony, Lockhard, Beeville, Brazoria and Beaumont.

<h2>ACLU of Texas Files A Complaint Against Santa Fe ISD</h2></center>
<p>
<br>
<b>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</br>
April 4, 1995</b>
<p>
HOUSTON -- The ACLU of Texas, acting on behalf of parents and students in
Santa Fe, today filed a complaint against Santa Fe ISD for numerous
violations of the First Amendment's prohibition against government
establishment of religion.
<P>
The complaint, filed in Federal Court in Galveston, Texas, alleges that the
School District permitted, supervised or condoned the following activities:
<P>
1. Denominational prayer at school graduation.
2. Distribution of Bibles at the schools by the Gideons.
3. Grade school teacher-led prayers.
4. A teacher's belittling of a student's religion during a history class.
5. A teacher's distribution of flyers to students announcing a Baptist
Revival.
6. Junior High School Christian Club meetings during school hours and teacher
sponsorship.
7. Teacher-led religious songs during class time (a third grade student,
whose parents did not wish him to participate, was put outside the classroom
and left unattended).
8. Baccalaureate services at the High School gym, conducted by a Minister
selected by the school administration.
9. Prayers conducted at school sports events.
<P>
All of these activities, the ACLU said, have the primary effect of advancing
Christianity by Santa Fe ISD, in violation of the First Amendment. Plaintiffs
are seeking injunctive relief prohibiting the defendants from continuing to
sponsor and endorse religious practices at Santa Fe schools. Plaintiffs also
seek monetary damages and injunctive relief protecting them from retaliation
by the defendants.

<P>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
March 31, 1995</b>
<P>
JUDGE LED PRAYER CALLED UNCONSTITUTIONAL
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama today filed a lawsuit to
stop religious practices led or initiated by judges in Alabama's
courtrooms. Filed against Etowah County Circuit Court Judge Roy S. Moore,
the suit calls his penchant for displaying religious symbols and inviting
clergy to lead the court in prayer a constitutionally forbidden violation
of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution, as well as
Alabama's own constitution. 
<P>
"The Plaintiffs are asking for a courtroom that is open to all citizens,"
said Joel L. Sogol , ACLU of Alabama Co-operating Attorney.  "No one
should have to pass a religious test to receive justice in a courtroom." 
The suit is being brought in the name of the Alabama Freethought
Association and other individuals whose reside in Moore's circuit. The
suit was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of
Alabama.  Judge Moore regularly opens his court with prayer, led by either
a member of the clergy or a layperson. The prayers are explicitly
Christian. 
<P>
In addition, Moore prominently displays a wood carving of the Biblical Ten
Commandments in his courtroom.  Following complaints about judge-led
prayer in Alabama's courtrooms, Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Sonny
Hornsby's office advised the judges under his jurisdiction of the problems
of the practice and let each judge decide what he or she would do. Judge
Moore is one of several judges who chose to continue sponsoring prayer in
his courtroom. 
<P>
 "Such practices have been ruled unconstitutional endorsements of religion
by the US Supreme Court and recently in the 4th and 11th Federal Circuits
in cases from North Carolina and Georgia." said Sogol.  "The Judge is a
representative of government authority acting upon a captive audience,
forcing them to participate in, or sit through, his particular form of
religious worship. Prosecutors, defendants, juries, witnesses and
spectators are all powerless to object for fear of prejudicing the Judge
against them. This is clearly a violation of both religious endorsement
and religious liberty." 
<P>
The suit asks for a removal of the religious symbols from the courtroom
and a permanent order enjoining Judge Moore from "leading, conducting or
promoting the recitation of prayers in the courtroom."  "We expect a
favorable decision," said Sogol, "and we hope both the Judge and the
Governor will abide by the law." 
<P>
Representing the ACLU in this lawsuit are James Tucker of the ACLU of
Alabama, Joel Sogol of Tuscaloosa , and Robert Skitol of Drinker Biddle
and Reath in Washington, DC.

Federal Judge Strikes Down "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"
 Six Lesbian and Gay Servicemembers Win Lawsuit</h2>

<b>
<P>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
March 30, 1995</b>
<P>
       (NEW YORK, March 30) -- In a major blow to the current law barring
open lesbians and gay men from serving in the armed forces, a federal
judge today ruled in favor of six servicemembers who sued the federal
government in the first direct constitutional challenge to the so-called
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" law. 
<P>
       "Our victory today is enormously gratifying," said Matthew Coles,
director of the ACLU's national Lesbian and Gay Rights Project. "But in no
way is it the end of this story. We will not stop this fight until we have
finally struck down this law that denies freedom of speech and equal
protection to lesbian and gay servicemembers." 
<P>
        "Today's ruling is a decisive setback to a policy that is based
solely on prejudice and antipathy towards gays," said Beatrice Dohrn,
legal director at Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund. "This ruling
underscores what we already know. Open lesbians and gay men serve our
nation's defense well, and they do so without harming military
capability." 
<P>
       Judge Eugene Nickerson of the federal district court for the
Eastern District of New York, ruled that, "The Supreme Court has held that
the First Amendment will not countenance the proscription if the
expression of an idea because others find that idea repugnant." 
<P>
       "This principle applies with particular force where, as here,
heterosexuals find the mere idea of homosexual orientation disagreeable
based largely on irrational stereotypes." 
<P>
      "It [is] demeaning and unworthy of a great nation to base a policy
on pretense rather than truth," he said. 
<P>
       The case, Able v. U.S.A., was filed jointly by Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union on
behalf of six lesbian and gay servicemembers. The lawsuit contended that
the legislation adopted by Congress and signed into law by President
Clinton in 1993 is discriminatory, based on prejudice, and in violation of
the free speech and equal protection rights of the plaintiffs. 
<P>
       The current law, which subjects lesbians and gay servicemembers to
discharge if they say or do anything that reflects their sexual
orientation, marked the first time the military's discriminatory policy
was codified by Congress into law.  Enacted in November 1993 as a
political "compromise," the policy sought to modify the previous
guidelines, issued in 1981, under which nearly 17,000 servicemembers were
discharged, at a cost of $500 million to tax payers. 
<P>
       But the current law, according to military observers, does little
to change the Pentagon's longstanding policy to discharge lesbian and gay
servicemembers. In fact, the language remains largely unchanged. Rather
than a policy based on the belief that "homosexuality is incompatible with
military service," the current law holds that open lesbians and gay men
pose an "unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and
discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military
capability." 
<P>
       The lawsuit was filed on behalf of two active servicemembers and
four reservists who come from a variety of ranks across military branches:
U.S. Army Reserves Colonel Jane Able (a pseudonym), U.S. Coast Guard Petty
Officer Robert Heigl, U.S. Army Reserves Captain Kenneth Osborn, U.S. Army
Reserves Sergeant Steven Spency, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Richard
von Wohld, and U.S. Navy Seaman Werner Zehr. In addition to the ACLU and
Lambda, the plaintiffs were assisted by cooperating attorneys from the New
York-based law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell. 
<P>
       During the four-day trial that began on March 13, 1995, the
plaintiffs presented six witnesses including Laurence J. Korb, former
Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Reagan Administration; Retired
Major General Vance Coleman, who served from 1942 to 1989; and Retired
Brigadier General Evelyn P. Foote, who served nearly 30 years.  The
witnesses testified in support of plaintiffs' claim that the policy's
rationale is "utterly lacking in empirical fact or reasonable data ," but
is instead based solely on prejudice. The government did not produce any
witnesses to defend the military's policy. 
<P>
      "We are prepared for the government's probable appeal," said the
ACLU's Coles. "We are confident that a higher court will uphold the rights
of lesbians and gay men to serve openly in our nation's armed forces." 
<P>
      "The decision will hold up on appeal because laws based on
prejudice are never constitutional," said Lambda's Dohrn. "We will
continue to fight the military's ban on lesbian and gay servicemembers
until the policy is overturned."
<P>

           Ban on Gays in the Military Goes On Trial;

<br>
<b>
<P>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
March 12, 1995</b>
<P>
     (NEW YORK, March 12, 1995) -- The trial in Able et al v.
U.S.A., the first and only direct constitutional challenge to the
government's current law barring lesbians and gay men from openly
serving in the military, will begin Monday, March 13, in federal
District Court in Brooklyn. Opening statement will begin at 9
a.m., followed by the testimony of expert witnesses, which will
continue through Wednesday. Closing arguments are scheduled for
Thursday.
<P>
     The lawsuit, filed jointly by the American Civil Liberties
Union and Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund on behalf of
six servicemembers, contends that the legislation adopted by
Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in 1993, is
discriminatory, based on prejudice and in violation of the free
speech and equal protection rights of the plaintiffs.
<P>
     "The new ban is a shocking example of the government's
willingness to cave in to anti-gay antipathy," said Beatrice
Dohrn, Lambda's Legal Director. "This policy relies solely on
prejudice. Lesbians and gay men have made, and always will make,
an invaluable contribution to our nation's defense. Our
plaintiffs should be allowed to serve our country openly and
honestly."
<P>
     "This is the last bastion of officially sanctioned
government prejudice in America," said Matthew Coles, Director of
the American Civil Liberties Union's national Lesbian and Gay
Rights Project. "It violates our clients' constitutional rights
and must be struck down."
<P>
     The current ban, known misleadingly as "Don't Ask, Don't
Tell," marked the first time the military's discriminatory policy
was codified by Congress into law. Enacted in November 1993 as a
"political compromise," the policy bars lesbians and gay men from
service if they say or do anything that reflect their sexual
orientation. Although the government now admits that gays are as
capable as heterosexuals, the policy holds that open gay men and
lesbians pose "an unacceptable risk to the high standards of
morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the
essence of military capability."
<P>
     But the current policy, which took effect on February 28,
1994, merely continued the military's longstanding policy to
discharge lesbian and gay servicemembers. Under the previous
guidelines, issued in 1981, the Pentagon held that homosexuality
was "incompatible with military service." Nearly 17,000
servicemembers were discharged under those rules.
<P>
     The lawsuit is filed on behalf of six lesbian and gay
servicemembers, two active and four reservist, who come from a
variety of ranks across the different branches of the military.
They are: Colonel Jane Able, Petty Officer Robert Heigl, First
Lieutenant Kenneth Osborn, Sergeant Steven Spencer, Lieutenant
Richard von Wohld and Seaman Werner Zehr.
<P>
     Since it is known that they are gay men or lesbians, the six
plaintiffs will face immediate discharge proceedings if the law
is upheld. A federal appeals court has ordered that the
preliminary injunction, blocking the government from proceeding
to discharge the plaintiffs, will expire on March 31, 1995, and
that Judge Eugene Nickerson should issue his final ruling in the
case before that date.
<P>
     At trial, attorneys for Lambda and the ACLU -- along with
cooperating attorneys from the law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell
-- will argue that the current statute and regulations create an
elaborate system under which all lesbian and gay servicemembers
are not judged by their fitness and ability to serve, but are
instead subject to discriminatory treatment because of the
perceived prejudices of others.
<P>
     The plaintiffs will show that the policy's rationale is
"utterly lacking in empirical fact or reasonable data," and that
Congress ignored government-sponsored studies that prove that
allowing open lesbians and  gay men to serve would not hurt
military effectiveness. They will also show that the
Congressional record was edited to disguise the fact that the
only basis for the military's ban is antipathy and prejudice
toward  lesbians and gay men.
<P>
     Expert witnesses for the plaintiffs include:
<P>
     -- Dr. Lawrence J. Korb, the former Pentagon official under
the Reagan Administration, will testify that he was directed to
implement the 1981 version of the ban despite his view that it
was unjustified.
<P>
     -- Dr. Robert MacCoun, the author of Rand Corporation's
government-commissioned report on gays in the military, will
testify that sexual orientation has no impact on unit cohesion or
military effectiveness.
<P>
     -- Major General Vance Coleman will testify about the
parallels between the arguments made in support of the current
statute, and the arguments made a generation ago to oppose racial
integration of the armed services.
<P>
<P>
     -- Dr. Pepper Schwartz, a Professor of Sociology at the
University of Washington and an expert on human sexuality, will
address the common stereotypes of lesbian and gay sexuality, and
the relationship between sexual orientation and military
effectiveness.
<P>
     -- Brigadier General Evelyn P. Foote will testify about
military discipline, chain of command,  and unit cohesion, and
how they all serve to temper bias and prejudice.
<P>
The trial is scheduled to begin Monday, March 13 at the federal
courthouse in Brooklyn, 225 Cadman Plaza East, at 9:00 A.M. in

<b>
<P>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
March 12, 1995</b>
<P>
     "Tomorrow we will go to court on behalf of six ordinary,
capable people who wish only to serve their country.  But because
of officially sanctioned government prejudice, they cannot be here
today. The law we are challenging prohibits them from saying or
doing anything that shows they are gay. These aren't people who
seek the limelight. They have brought this case because federal law
says they can't tell their closest friends they had a date to see
a movie the night before.  Starting tomorrow, we will begin a trial
before a U.S. District Court Judge to strike down this law that
denies freedom of speech and equal protection to our clients.
<P>
     "The armed services are the largest employer in America.  This
policy denies people who are able and willing to serve their
country the opportunity to do so -- not on the basis of merit or
ability, but because others might be uncomfortable by their
presence. The most shocking thing about this case is that the
government admits this.  It admits that lesbians and gay men are
just as good as soldiers and sailors and it admits that the only
reason for the policy is that some heterosexuals are uneasy. That
is pure and simple prejudice. It cannot be the basis for law in the
United States of America, where we value fairness and merit above
all.
<P>
     "The Constitution protects all Americans.  All Americans have
the right to freedom of speech provided by the First Amendment and
to equal protection under the law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth
Amendment. The policy must be struck down because it defies the
very principles of fairness upon which this country was founded."

<b>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
March 12, 1995</b>
<P>
Americans should be judged by what they do, not who they are. 
Able v. USA challenges one of the most sweeping, basic,
government sponsored affronts to that principal.  This process
began with the intention of eliminating discrimination based on
sexual orientation.  It ended in the enactment of a law that
could not be clearer in its differential and unfair treatment of
lesbian and gay servicemembers.  
<P>
Let's be clear about the terms of the Act and regulations we are
challenging:  they do not punish particular acts or behavior
fairly and even-handedly.  Rather, they take aim at lesbian and
gay sexual orientation, and subject to discharge those who say or
do anything that indicates that they are gay.  
<P>
This policy works in very ironic ways.  For instance, those who
are NOT lesbian or gay are granted the freedom to participate in
activities that if undertaken by our clients, would result in
their discharge. We're talking about anything from frequenting
gay social events, reading gay literature,  putting your arm
around your football buddy, or dancing with your college
roommate, to private, non-criminal off-base, off duty sex. 
Heterosexuals are free to do these things, as well as to proclaim
their sexual orientation and even to brag about their sexual
exploits to anyone they wish.  
<P>
We intend, in this lawsuit, to demonstrate for once and for all
that every justification offered in support of this or any other
ban boil down to one thing -- antipathy toward lesbians and gay
men. Lesbians and gay men have made and always will make an
invaluable contribution to our nation's defense.  The time has
come to allow lesbians and gay men to serve openly and honestly. 
They should not be forced to hide.
<P>
At trial, we will show that tried and true principals of military
leadership would make fast work of dealing with the so-called
"disruption to good order and discipline" which the government
alleges would result, if the ban were lifted.  As Dr. Lawrence
Korb pointed out in his deposition in this case: "Military people
are wonderful about following orders.  Give an order.  They'll
make it work."  We look forward to the court giving that order.
<P>

<h2>
Federal Appeals Court to Hear Challenge to NJ Ban on Graduation Prayer</h2>
</center>
<P>
<br>
<b>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
January 20, 1995</b>
<P>
     The Black Horse Pike School District's appeal of an injunction
against any form of prayer at its graduation ceremonies, secured by the
American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey on behalf of a 1993
graduating student, will be heard on Monday, January 23, by the federal
Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. 
<P>
     The case began when the Black Horse Pick school district permitted
the senior class to vote on whether it wanted a prayer delivered during
the commencement ceremonies. The class was also allowed to vote on whether
the prayer would be delivered by a student or a clergy person. 
<P>
     In granting a preliminary injunction against that activity, the Third
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that schools could no sooner delegate the
function of presenting prayer to students than present prayer by selecting
a clergy person. Both activites, the court ruled, amount to public-school
sponsorship of prayer at a school-sponsored event; both have the same
effect on students who do not share the same or any religious beliefs. 
<P>
     A permanent injunction against organized graduation prayers in the
district was issued in March 1994 by District Court Judge Joseph E.
Irenas. The school district appealed to the Third Circuit. 
<P>
     "This case involves issues that go to the very heart of the First
Amendment," said James Katz, the ACLU's volunteer attorney who will argue
the case for the plaintiffs. 
<P>
     "Courts have long ago held that the First Amendment requires strict
neutrality of public institutions in regard to religion," added Mr. Katz,
of the Haddonfield firm of Tomar, Simonoff, Adourian & O'Brien. 
<P>
"This requirement cannot be abrogated by having students sponsor prayer at
a school-sponsored graduation or by having a student lead the prayer as
the school officials have proposed. 
<P>
     "The fundamental rights of religious freedom were never intended to
be submitted to a majority vote," Katz said.
<P>

<TITLE>Model Letter on Late Term Abortion</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="/graphics/repro.gif"></P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">MODEL LETTER TO STATE OR FEDERAL LEGISLATOR </H2>
<P><I><FONT SIZE="+1">Use your browser's copy function to paste this letter
into an e-mail to your member of congress, or paste it into a word processing
application and fax or mail to your federal or state representatives.</FONT></I></P>
<HR>
<P>Dear [legislator]:</P>
<P>As your constituent, I am writing to urge you to oppose any bans on
so-called &quot;partial-birth abortions.&quot;  This term is unrecognized by the
medical community and wholly invented by abortion opponents to mislead the
public.  The actual abortion procedure they appear to have in mind is known to
the medical community as &quot;dilation and extraction&quot; (D&amp;X) or &quot;intact
dilation and evacuation&quot; (IDE).</P>
<P>Women confronting catastrophic pregnancies must have all safe options
available, including D&amp;X, a procedure that is safest for some women in some
circumstances.  Many women have come forward to explain why D&amp;X was the
safest way to resolve their tragedies.  Vikki Stella, whose fetus was fatally
impaired, explained to Congress, &quot;As a diabetic . . . this surgery was . .
.  safer for me than induced labor or a c-section, since I don't heal as well as
other people.&quot;  Because the surgery preserved her fertility, she was able
to bear another child.  An arbitrary ban on one surgical technique is senseless
and dangerous: its only consequence would be to channel women from safer to
riskier abortion procedures.    </P>
<P>Legislators should not regulate medicine in a way that will undermine the
safety of patients.  Decisions about the best surgical techniques for abortion
are best left in the hands of doctors, patients, and their families.</P>
<P>Nearly 90 percent of all abortions in this country occur within the first 12
weeks of pregnancy.  Instead of banning procedures that protect those women who
do need abortions later in pregnancy, we should work to ensure that women
seeking abortions can get them quickly without being delayed by legal or
financial barriers.   </P>
<P>In 1992 the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed the constitutional right
to abortion; anti-choice groups merely stepped up their attacks in response. 
Their latest tactic is the attempt to ban specific abortion procedures.  I urge
you to oppose all bans on &quot;partial-birth abortions,&quot; &quot;D&amp;X 
abortions,&quot; or any other safe abortion procedure.  Please don't turn back
the clock to the days of illegal, back-alley abortions by punishing doctors who
help women end their pregnancies safely.</P>
<P>Sincerely,</P>
<P>[Your name and address]</P>

<TITLE>ACLU in Congress: &quot;Partial-Birth Abortions&quot;: Criminalizing a
Necessary Medical Procedure</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="/graphics/repro.gif"></P>
<P>ACLU ANSWERS</P>
<H2>&quot;Partial-Birth Abortions&quot;:  Criminalizing a Necessary Medical
Procedure</H2>
<P>January 1996</P>
<H3>BACKGROUND </H3>
<P>Since 1995, the ACLU and its pro-choice allies have fought a pitched battle
against congressional attempts to ban a particular abortion procedure. 
Anti-choice forces targeted so-called &quot;partial-birth abortions&quot; -- a
term unknown to the medical community and invented solely as a propaganda ploy
to provoke legislators and the public.  </P>
<P>The abortion procedure they appear to be referring to is known as &quot;dilation
and extraction&quot; (D&amp;X) or &quot;intact dilation and evacuation&quot;

(IDE).  Doctors perform a D&amp;X abortion when it is the safest and least
traumatic option for the patient.  In some instances, doctors recommend D&amp;X
as a lifesaving operation because of grave pregnancy complications.   Other
times, D&amp;X offers women the best chance of preserving their health,
including their future fertility.</P>
<P><I><B>Federal Efforts to Ban the Procedure</B></I></P>
<P>During the 104th Congress, anti-choice forces waged a major effort to pass
the &quot;Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995.&quot; The bill, which
represented Congress's first attempt ever to ban a particular medical procedure,
would have outlawed the abortion method and criminalized doctors who performed
it. </P>
<P>Representative Charles Canady (R-FL) sponsored the bill in the House and
Senator Robert Smith (R-NH) sponsored the Senate version.  Both houses of
Congress passed the bill, but President Clinton vetoed the legislation in April
1996.  Anti-choice forces spent the remainder of the term trying to override the
veto.  In the closing days of the 104th Congress, proponents of the ban garnered
the necessary two-thirds vote in the House, but the Senate failed to override by
a slim 57-to-41 margin.</P>
<P>In his veto message, the President said that he would sign the bill if it
were amended to add an exception for &quot;serious health consequences.&quot; 
Some members of Congress who opposed the measure also called for such an
exception.  Despite this focus on the lack of a health exception, the bill had a
number of other constitutional flaws.  It failed to provide an adequate life
exception, applied to both non-viable and viable fetuses, and was worded so
vaguely as to cover a broad range of other procedures.</P>
<P>The ban's supporters will try again to win its passage in the current 105th
Congress.  They have introduced S. 6 (&quot;The Partial Abortion Act of 1997&quot;),
which is very similar to the ban passed by the 104th Congress.  And some members
who previously opposed the ban have signaled an interest in pursuing a
compromise.</P>
<P><I><B>State Efforts to Ban the Procedure</B></I></P>
<P>While the federal debate raged over the &quot;Partial-Birth Abortion Ban
Act,&quot; states saw significant activity in this area as well.  Like the
federal bill, most of the state legislative proposals in 1996 sought to
criminalize the procedure.  Moreover, they had narrow life exceptions, made no
exception for health, applied to both viable and non-viable fetuses, and were
vaguely worded.</P>
<P>Overall, 17 states in recent years had proposals introduced in their
legislatures.  Three states -- Michigan, Ohio, and Utah -- enacted measures
criminalizing D&amp;X abortions.  Pro-choice groups succeeded in blocking bills
in the remaining 14 states, including: California, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky,
Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington.  </P>
<P>Already, during the first weeks of the 1997 legislative sessions, &quot;partial-birth
abortion&quot; bans are under consideration in at least twenty states.</P>
<H3>TALKING POINTS</H3>
<P>Banning D&amp;X abortions would jeopardize the health and lives of women by
denying them a safe and necessary medical procedure.   Anti-choice forces have
attempted to distort D&amp;X by employing the most graphic images and terms. 
But surgery, almost by definition, is unpleasant and difficult to describe. 
</P>
<P>What is important is that D&amp;X is often the safest option available to
women undergoing second- or third-trimester abortions.</P>
<P>According to doctors who perform or have observed the procedure, D&amp;X
carries fewer health risks than alternative procedures.  D&amp;X is also less
physically stressful and less toxic than other alternative methods.  In
addition, D&amp;X is the best procedure in some circumstances for preserving a
woman's ability to bear children in the future.</P>
<P>Legislators should not regulate medicine in a way that undermines the safety
of patients.  Lawmakers are not trained to make medical decisions and should not
intrude into the practice of medicine.  They should leave decisions about the
best surgical techniques for abortion in the hands of doctors, patients, and
their families.</P>
<H3>ACLU POSITION</H3>
<P>The ACLU opposes attempts to ban so-called &quot;partial-birth abortions&quot;
as an unconstitutional threat to the lives and health of women.  As the Supreme
Court has consistently recognized, a woman seeking the abortion of a non-viable
fetus has the right to choose the safest option available.  The state cannot ask
a woman to compromise her health or life by denying her a specific medical
procedure.  Similarly, a woman seeking a post-viability abortion in order to
save her life or preserve her health must be allowed to choose the safest
available medical procedure.  </P>
<H3>FACTS &amp; QUOTES</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Nineteen weeks into my pregnancy, an ultrasound indicated that there
was something wrong with our baby.... Our little baby had a very advanced,
textbook case of hydrocephalus.... My doctors, some of the best in the country,
recommended the [D&amp;X] procedure.... Because the trauma to my body was
minimized by this procedure, I was able to become pregnant again.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

the bill banning so-called &quot;partial-birth abortions.&quot;)</P>
<H4>2. Bans Endanger Women's Health and Safety</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;It is unconscionable for Congress to force a physician to
potentially jeopardize a patient's health and ignore his or her best medical
judgment.  A woman in tragic circumstances should have the right to make her own

<H4>3. Keep Government Out of the Operating Room</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The college finds it very disturbing that Congress would take any

<H4>4. Abortions After the First Trimester Are Not Common</H4>
<P><I>Nearly 90 percent of all abortions in the United States occur within the
first trimester (12 weeks) of pregnancy.  Of all abortions in this country, 99
percent occur within the first 20 weeks.  Only 6/100ths of one percent take
place past 24 weeks, meaning that third-trimester abortions are extremely rare. 
There are approximately 600 or fewer third-trimester abortions performed by any
method in the United States annually.</I></P>

<TITLE>Giving Up My Baby: Coreen Costello</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="/graphics/repro.gif"></P>
<H2>Giving Up My Baby</H2>
<P><I>By Coreen Costello</I></P>
<P>Those who want Congress to ban a controversial late-term abortion technique
might think I would be an ally.  I was raised in a conservative, religious
family.  My parents are Rush Limbaugh fans.  I'm a Republican who always
believed that abortion was wrong.</P>
<P>Then I had one.</P>
<P>It wasn't supposed to be that way.  My little girl, Katherine Grace, was
supposed to have been born in the summer.  The births of my two other children
had been easy, and my husband and I planned a home delivery.</P>
<P>But disaster struck in my seventh month.  Ultrasound testing showed that
something was terribly wrong with my baby.  Because of a lethal neuromuscular
disease, her body had stiffened up inside my uterus.  She hadn't been able to
move any part of her tiny self for at least two months.  Her lungs had been
unable to stretch to prepare them for air.</P>
<P>Our doctors told us that Katherine Grace could not survive, and that her
condition made giving birth dangerous for me -- possibly even life-threatening. 
Because she could not absorb amniotic fluid, it had gathered in my uterus to
such dangerous levels that I weighed as much as if I were at full term.</P>
<P>I carried my daughter for two more agonizing weeks.  If I couldn't save her
life, how could I spare her pain?  How could I make her passing peaceful and
dignified?  At first I wanted the doctors to induce labor, but they told me that
Katherine was wedged so tightly in my pelvis that there was a good chance my
uterus would rupture.  We talked about a Caesarean section.  But they said that
this, too, would have been too dangerous for me.</P>
<P>Finally we confronted the painful reality:  our only real option was to
terminate the pregnancy.  Geneticists at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los
Angeles referred us to a doctor who specialized in cases like ours.  He knew how
much pain we were going through, and said he would help us end Katherine's pain
in the way that would be safest for me and allow me to have more children.</P>
<P>That's just what happened.  For two days, my cervix was dilated until the
doctor could bring Katherine out without injuring me.  Her heart was barely

beating.  As I was placed under anesthesia, it stopped.  She simply went to
sleep and did not wake up.  The doctor then used a needle to remove fluid from
the baby's head so she could fit through the cervix.</P>
<P>When it was over, they brought Katherine in to us.  She was wrapped in a
blanket.  My husband and I held her and sobbed.  She was absolutely beautiful. 
Giving her back was the hardest thing I've ever done.</P>
<P>After Katherine, I didn't think I would have more children.  I couldn't
imagine living with the worry for nine months, imagining all the things that
could go wrong.  But my doctor changed that.  &quot;You're a great mother,&quot;
he told me.  &quot;If you want more kids, you should have them.&quot;  I feel
very blessed because I went on to have another child, Tucker James, who is now
seven months old.</P>
<P>I still have mixed feelings about abortion.  But I have no mixed feelings
about proposals to ban the surgical procedure I had, called intact dilation and
evacuation.  As I watched the Senate debate its proposed bill on C-Span, I was
sick at heart.  Senator after senator talked about the procedure I underwent as

if they had seen one, and senator after senator got it wrong.  Katherine was not
cavalierly pulled halfway out and stabbed with scissors, as some senators
described the process.</P>
<P>I had one of the safest, gentlest, most compassionate ways of ending a
pregnancy that had no hope.  I will probably never have to go through such an
ordeal again.  But other women, other families, will receive devastating news
and have to make decisions like mine.  Congress has no place in our tragedies.</P>

<H2>Congress Plays Doctor</H2>
<P><I>By Allan Rosenfield</I></P>
<P>When the House took the unprecedented step last week of passing a bill that
would outlaw a specific and safe surgical procedure, the so-called partial birth
abortion, it set a dangerous precedent by inappropriately intruding into the
clinical practice of medicine.</P>
<P>Medical decisions should be based on scientific evidence gleaned from
laboratory and clinical evaluation. Procedures should be judged on safety,
effectiveness, availability and affordability. Such decisions should not fall
within the purview of ideology and politics.  </P>
<P>In considering abortion, doctors examine the best data available, consider
the patient's specific medical circumstances and, in consultation with the fully
informed patient, decide on the best procedure. In declaring illegal the
so-called partial birth abortion procedure, the House and Senate trampled on
these criteria.</P>
<P>Indeed, the bill demonstrates why Congress should never supersede
professional medical judgment. As the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, which fought this bill, points out, partial birth abortion is not
found in any medical dictionary; foes of abortion coined the term. </P>
<P>The procedure, known medically as dilatation and extraction, is a variant of
dilation and evacuation, the most common abortion method in the second
trimester. Dilation and extraction, rarely performed, is generally limited to
pregnancies that are in the 20th to 24th weeks; very few are performed
afterward. Dilation and evacuation is the preferred method because medical data
indicate that it has the lowest complication rate of any method usable in the
second trimester. In any case, fewer than 1.5 percent of all abortions take
place after 20 weeks; most are done within 12 weeks.</P>
<P>The anguished decision to use dilation and extraction is usually reached
when a woman's life or health would be jeopardized if the pregnancy is continued
or if there is a fetal abnormality incompatible with life. These abnormalities
can be horrific -- for example, a fetus with no brain or with the brain outside
the skull.</P>
<P>Although proponents of the legislation described the procedure in luridly
graphic terms, the bill is vague in defining a partial birth abortion. The
language is so imprecise that many D and E's, as doctors call them, could
arguably meet the definition. This could force the small pool of physicians who
perform second-trimester abortions to use techniques that are less safe for fear
of prosecution.</P>
<P>It is unconscionable for Congress to force a physician to potentially
jeopardize a patient's health and ignore his or her best medical judgment. A
woman in tragic circumstances should have the right to make her own decision, in
consultation with her physician -- not her legislator.</P>
<P>What legislatures and courts can decide is whether a class of practices
should be lawful. Thus, in Roe v. Wade and later decisions the Supreme Court
established the legality of abortion. To protect Americans from unethical
research, Congress has required the establishment of review boards and informed
consent. And while Congress requires consent before sterilization for Medicaid
patients, it does not ban or mandate a specific procedure. </P>
<P>No issue is more controversial than abortion. But since abortion is legal,
perhaps we can at least agree that members of Congress are simply not equipped
to make pronouncements about surgical procedures. Wisely, President Clinton has
promised to veto the bill.</P>

<TITLE>ACLU in Congress: Testimony of J. Courtland Robinson</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="/graphics/repro.gif"></P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">STATEMENT OF J. COURTLAND ROBINSON 
</H2>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"> JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, SCHOOL OF HYGIENE AND PUBLIC
HEALTH</H3>

<P> I would like to thank the Chairman and the members of the subcommittee for
inviting me to be here today. My name is J. Courtland Robinson, associate
professor on the full-time faculty in the Department of Gynecology and
Obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and a joint
appointment with the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health.   I have
been involved in all aspects of reproductive health care for women for over 40
years, including complete obstetrical care, abortion, special oncologic and
gynecological care, with an extra interest in family and sterilization. I am
here on behalf of the National Abortion Federation, the national professional
association of abortion providers.  
</P>
<P>My experience with abortion began in the 1950's, when as a house officer at
the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City, I watched women die
from abortions that were poorly done. Over a 5-year period when in training at
the medical center, many women died before our eyes. Many survived only with
aggressive pelvic surgery. On occasion, we did save the very sick.   These are
not events learned from books, but reality that I painfully experienced and
witnessed. This experience with poorly performed abortions was further extended
during my 11 years as a medical missionary with the Presbyterian Church while  I
worked and taught in Korea.  
</P>
<P>In 1971 at Baltimore City Hospital, we were already doing legal first and
second trimester abortions before the Roe versus Wade decision came down. We did
about 1,000 a year. Thirty percent were second trimester. At that time, the
method of management of second-trimester abortions was saline induction. When
the saline did not work, it was often my task to carry out an evacuation in
order to meet the patient's needs in a safe and timely manner. I have performed
abortions in different settings, and have performed second-trimester abortions
using different techniques, depending upon the clinical situation.  
</P>
<P>When a woman is faced with a need to terminate a pregnancy, the physician
can manage the surgical procedure using a number of techniques, hypotonic
glucose, saline, urea, prostoglandins, potossin, suction, D&amp;C, D&amp;E. We
have used different techniques over the years as our skill and understanding of
basic physiology has become clearer. As in all of medicine we develop techniques
which are more appropriate, study the long-term impacts, and determine which is
safer. The physician needs to be able to decide, in consultation with the
patient, and based on her specific physical and emotional needs, what is the
appropriate methodology. The practice of medicine by committee is neither good
for patients or for medicine in general.  
</P>
<P>This legislation appears to be about something you are referring to as
partial-birth abortion. I now am beginning to learn a little about what you
think it means, but I did not know it until a few days ago. Never in my career
have I heard a physician who provides abortions refer to any techniques as a
partial-birth abortion. That, I suspect, is because the name did not exist until
someone who wanted to ban abortions made it up. Medically, we do not do
partial-birth abortion. There is no such thing.  
</P>
<P>When an intact fetus is removed in the process of abortion, as is sometimes
done, fetal demise is induced either by an artificial medical means or through
the combination of steps taken as the procedure is begun. Thus, in no case is
pain induced to the fetus. If neurologic development at the stage of the
abortion being performed even made this possible, which in the vast majority of
cases it does not, analgesia and anesthesia given to the women neutralizes any
pain that may be perceived by the fetus.  
</P>

<P>So when I read in your legislation that you seek to, `Ban an abortion in
which the person performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living
fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery,' my reaction is that
you are banning something that does not happen. To say partially vaginally
delivers is vague, not medically oriented, just not correct. In any normal
second-trimester abortion procedure done by any method, you may have a point at
which a part, an inch of  cord, for example, of the fetus passes out of the
cervical os, before fetal demise has occurred. This does not mean you are
performing a partial birth.  
</P>
<P>I have seen the sketches that have been passed around. I have read your
description of a particular physician's method of performing this procedure, a
method by the way which is not at all common. It represents a particular
surgical decision by that physician, one which works in his practice. The
sketches in any case are not particularly correct. They may in a very technical
sense represent an approximation of what occurs in some cases, but they do not
represent medical or scientific accuracy. Rather, they are designed to be
upsetting and inflammatory for the lay person. They do not advance medical
practice.  
</P>
<P>The words of the legislation are equally inflammatory. No one doing this
procedure is partially delivering a fetus. So then, I have to wonder what you
are trying to ban with this legislation. It sounds to me as if you are trying to
leave any late abortion open to question, to create a right of action, and in
fact, a criminal violation. To force doctors to affirmatively prove that they
have not somehow violated such a law.   I know that a number of physicians who
have performed abortions for years who are experts in the field, look at this
legislation and do not understand what you mean or what you are trying to
accomplish. It seems as if this vagueness is intentional. I, as a physician, can
not countenance a vague law that may or may not cut off an appropriate surgical
option for my patient.  
</P>
<P>Women present to us for later abortions for a number of reasons, including
congenital anomalies, of which I have a few pictures if necessary. I can tell
you from my long experience that women do not appear and ask for any abortion,
particularly those that I saw die in the 1950's, particularly a later abortion,
cavalierly or lightly. They want an answer. It is a serious and difficult
decision and has been for centuries for women to make. It is not my place to
judge my patient's reason for ending a pregnancy, or to punish her because
circumstances prevented her from obtaining an abortion earlier.   It is my place
to treat my patient, a woman with a pregnancy she feels certain she cannot
continue, to the best of my ability. That includes selecting the most
appropriate surgical technique using my skill and knowledge developed from
experience, to determine what method is safest for this woman at all times and
in all circumstances. </P>
<P>Sometimes, as any doctor will tell you, you begin a surgical procedure
expecting that it will go one way, only to discover that a unique demand, the
case requires you to do something different. Telling a physician that it's
illegal for him or her to adapt a certain surgical method for the safety of  the
patient is absolutely criminal and flies in the face of the standards for the
quality of medical care.   For many physicians, this law would amount to a ban
on D&amp;E entirely, because they would not undertake a surgery if they were
legally prohibited from completing it in the best way they saw fit at the time
the procedure was being done. Because the law itself is so vague and bizarre,
leaving them to wonder whether they are open to prosecution or not.   This means
that by banning this very rare technique, you end up banning D&amp;E,
essentially recognized as the safest method of performing second-trimester
abortions. That means that women will probably die. I know. I have seen it
happen.  
</P>
<P>With all due respect, the Congress of the United States is not qualified to
stand over my shoulder in the operating room and tell me how to treat my
patient. If we are to allow women of this country the right to decide when and
whether to bear children, we, as their doctors, must be allowed to be doctors
and treat them to the best of our abilities and according to their sense of
personal control. Thank you. </P>

WASHINGTON -- The 104th Congress presented the
ACLU's Washington Office with its most formidable challenge
ever as the new leadership introduced a relentless
stream of anti-civil liberties proposals, and the Clinton
Administration and Democratic minority either capitulated, or
came up with bad proposals of their own.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
The ACLU was able to block passage of some of
Congress' worse excesses. Other bills passed and were signed
into law only to be challenged by the ACLU in court. And
some of the battles, such as on juvenile justice and organized
school prayer, never made it to the House or Senate floors
although they were fiercely fought in Congressional
committees.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Following is a list of key actions of the 104th Congress:

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">F</FONT>lag Amendment </b> - Both the House and Senate voted on a
proposal to amend the Constitution to include a
prohibition against desecration of the flag. In the House,
the measure was approved by a vote of <A HREF="House_HJRes79.html">312 to 120</A>. In the
Senate, proponents failed by a vote of <A HREF="Senate_SJRes31.html">63 to 36</A>,
three votes short of the 66 -- or two-thirds of
the Senate -- needed to approve a constitutional amendment.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>nternet Censorship</b> - As part of a major overhaul of the
nation's telecommunications industries, both the House and
Senate approved major new censorship schemes for the
Internet. The Senate adopted its version, the so-called
Communications Decency Act, by a vote of <A HREF="Senate_S652.html">84 to 16</A>. A
similar censorship scheme was adopted in the House on a
vote of <A HREF="House_HR1555.html">256 to 149</A> as part of its version of
telecommunications reform. The final bill incorporated much 
of both provisions and passed overwhelmingly with only five
senators and 16 representatives registering opposition.
Minutes after President Clinton signed the legislation, the
ACLU challenged its constitutionality in <A HREF="/issues/cyber/hmcl.html">Reno v. ACLU.</A>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>riminal Justice</b> - The counter-terrorism legislation included
a provision that virtually strips federal courts of their traditional
power and responsibility to enforce the Bill of Rights in
criminal justice cases. The measure severely limits the right of
habeas corpus that is the critical vehicle through which death
row and other prisoners may seek federal court review of their
convictions and sentences. An attempt in the Senate to preserve habeas failed
by a vote of <A HREF="Senate_S735A.html">35 to 64</A>. A similar attempt in the House
failed by a vote of <A HREF="House_HR2703A.html">135 to 283.</A>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>ounter-terrorism</b> - The bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal
Building lifted from obscurity a Clinton Administration
proposal to increase the powers of law enforcement in the
name of fighting terrorism. The measure gave the government
the power to use secret evidence to deport immigrants
it accuses of being "terrorists" and to exclude aliens merely because they
are
members of a disfavored foreign group. The bill won approval
in the Senate by a vote of <A HREF="Senate_S735.html">91 to 8</A> and a vote of <A HREF="House_HR2703.html">293
 to 133</A> in
the House.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">R</FONT>eproductive Rights</b> - In one of the most highly charged
issues of the 104th Congress, both the House and the Senate
approved legislation pushed by anti-choice extremists that
would have, for the first time, imposed criminal and civil
penalties on physicians who perform a rarely used late-term
abortion procedure. President Clinton vetoed the legislation,
which had won approval by the House on a vote of <A HREF="House_HR1833.html">288 to
139</A>. The Senate approved the bill by a vote of <A HREF="Senate_HR1833.html">54 to 44</A>.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>elfare reform</b> - With bipartisan support and the
endorsement of President Clinton, the House and Senate
approved legislation that preyed on the limited rights of vulnerable groups
including children, immigrants, the poor and the
elderly in the name of welfare reform. The bill also eroded
free speech for not-for-profit organizations, violated the
separation of church and state, and damaged privacy rights by
establishing a de facto national identification system. The
legislation passed the House on a vote of <A HREF="House_HR3734.html">256 to 170</A>; the
Senate approved the measure with a vote of <A HREF="Senate_HR3734.html">74 to 25</A> .

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT>chool vouchers</b> - One of the top items on the new leadership's 
agenda for this Congress was the passage of legislation that
would force local governments to fund religious and other
private educational schools through cash vouchers to students.
The House voted <A HREF="House_HR2546.html">241 to 177</A> to establish a pilot voucher
program in the District of Columbia. Although a majority of
Senators favored the voucher program, opponents were
able to block the bill through a filibuster. A motion to end the
filibuster failed on a vote of <A HREF="Senate_HR2546.html">44 to 56</A>, four votes short of
the
60 needed to end debate.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>edical privacy</b> - Hidden within the massive health care
reform bill approved by Congress in the stampede for an
August recess was a deceptively labeled provision that further
eroded the privacy rights of all Americans. The provision,
known as "administrative simplification," gives government and
businesses access to confidential medical information about
individuals without their consent and establishes a unique
health identification number for every patient, health provider,
health plan and employer. The medical privacy provisions of
the bill never came up for a separate vote, but the Senate approved the
health care measure on a vote of <A HREF="Senate_HR3103.html">98 to 0</A>. Earlier, the House
had rejected by a vote of <A HREF="House_HR3103.html"></A>198 to 226 an alternative version of
the bill that would have deleted the anti-privacy provisions.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>ational ID Card</b> - One of the most pervasive themes of the
104th Congress has been proposals to establish a national
identification system as a means of tracking undocumented
workers, so-called deadbeat dads and to monitor health
insurance information. Various database schemes have been
included in bills as diverse as immigration, welfare reform and
health insurance. Since these proposals have been buried in
much larger legislation, it was often difficult to determine the
position of members of Congress. In the House, however, an
attempt to eliminate a national ID system from the immigration
bill failed by a vote of <A HREF="House_HR2202A.html">159 to 260.</A> A similar attempt in the
Senate failed by a vote of <A HREF="Senate_S1664.html">46 to 54</A>.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>iretapping</b> - Although the interception of innocent conversations
in federal law enforcement wiretaps is already at record levels, Congress
has been repeatedly asked to give the FBI even greater
authority to wiretap. Proposals have ranged from providing
$500 million to the nation's phone companies to finance a
retrofit of their systems to make it easier for the FBI to
wiretap to permitting law enforcement agencies to use more
"roving" wiretaps (without specifying which phone is to be
tapped), and more "emergency" wiretaps (without obtaining
a prior court order). 
<p>
Congress partially funded the retrofit proposal, but rejected
other wiretapping proposals. In the Senate, an amendment 
to authorize more wiretaps without a prior court order was
rejected by a vote of <A HREF="Senate_S735A4.html">28 to 52</A>. A second amendment to give
the government increased authority to use roving wiretaps
passed on a vote of <A HREF="Senate_S735A2.html">77 to 19.</A>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>mmigration</b> - Seeking to capitalize on a wave of anti-immigration initiatives,
both the House and Senate passed bills that
represented the most draconian and divisive immigration
proposals in decades. Included were provisions that would strip the courts of
jurisdiction over illegal and abusive INS actions and erect enormous and
virtually insurmountable barriers for most people seeking political asylum. 
The House even approved a bill that would have effectively denied public
education to American citizen children of undocumented immigrants. The Senate
voted <A HREF="Senate_HR2202.html">97 to 3</A> to accept one version of the legislation; the
House approved a
harsher version by a vote of <A HREF="House_HR2202.html">333 to 87</A>. The President signed
the immigration legislation in September.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">H</FONT>IV in the Military</b> - Congress approved the 1996 defense
appropriations bill that, as one of its provisions, would have
forced the military to discharge HIV-positive service
members. Months later -- in an astonishing reversal -- 
Congress quickly repealed the measure. The original
appropriations legislation passed in the House by a vote of
<A HREF="House_S1124.html">287 to 129</A> and in the Senate by a vote of <A HREF="Senate_S1124.html">56 to 34</A>.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>ampaign Finance Reform</b> - In a sign of widespread
disillusion with the political process, both the House and
Senate considered versions of campaign finance reform that
the ACLU believed to be unconstitutional infringements of
free speech provisions of the First Amendment.
In the Senate, a motion to end a filibuster against
the bill failed by a vote of <A HREF="Senate_S1219.html">54 to 36</A>, six votes short of the
60
needed to end debate. In the House, campaign finance was
rejected by a vote of <A HREF="House_HR3820.html">259 to 162</A>.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT>ame-Sex Marriage</b> - In what the ACLU termed a "deplorable act of
hostility," both the House and the Senate adopted a measure
that would deny federal recognition of marriages between
lesbian and gay couples. In addition to redefining the Federal
definition of marriage, the bill would create a "gay exception"
to the Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause by allowing
states to ignore same-sex marriages performed in any other
state. The House vote in favor of the bill was <A HREF="House_HR3396.html">342 to 67</A>; the
Senate approved it by a vote of <A HREF="Senate_HR3396.html">84 to 15</A>. President Clinton
signed
the legislation.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">E</FONT>mployment Discrimination</b> - Building on efforts to establish the right to be
free from discrimination in employment, a bipartisan coalition of Senators
introduced the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1996, which would have
outlawed discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation. In a vote
hailed as a  victory for equality, the Senate fell only two votes short of
passage, setting the stage for the 105th Congress. The vote was <A HREF="Senate_S2056.html">49 
to 50</A>; there was no vote in the House.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">G</FONT>overnment Funding of Religious Institutions</b> - Included
in the welfare overhaul was a provision that could force state
governments, under threat of lawsuits, to contract with
religious institutions, including houses of worship, to provide
taxpayer-funded social services, even if they are delivered in a
proselytizing environment. This, too, was a recurring theme in
the 104th Congress where opponents of religious liberty
repeatedly sought to pass provisions to lower the wall of
separation between church and state. In the Senate, the provisions were
inserted into the welfare bill by a vote of <A HREF="Senate_S1956.html">67 to 32</A>. There
was no separate vote on the provisions in the House.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">P</FONT>risoners Rights</b> - Swept into law as a virtual footnote to a
huge appropriations bill, the so-called Prison Litigation
Reform Act stripped the federal courts of much of their power
to correct even the most egregious prison conditions. The Act
prohibited prison officials from settling lawsuits by agreeing to
make changes in unconstitutional prison conditions. There was
so little opposition to the Act that it never faced separate
votes in either the House or the Senate. The appropriations
bill that included the PLRA was approved by a vote of <A HREF="House_HR3019.html">209 to 206</A>
in the House; the a vote of Senate passed the bill on <A HREF="Senate_HR3019.html">79 to 21</A>.


<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT>entencing Guidelines</b> - In a groundbreaking act, the U.S.
Sentencing Commission found that there was no justification
or sound scientific basis for the disparity in sentencing
between those convicted of selling and using crack cocaine
compared to those who sell or use powder cocaine and
recommended that Congress end the 100-to-1 disparity in
sentencing. For the first time in the history of the Commission,
Congress rejected the Commission's recommendations. In the House, the
recommendations were rejected by a vote of <A HREF="House_HR2259.html">332 to 83</A>. The
Senate never voted on the Commission's recommendations.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">E</FONT>nglish Only</b> - One of the wedge issues of the political
season was legislation that would bar, with few exceptions,
the federal government from speaking in any language other
than English. The bill would also strike Voting Rights Act
provisions prohibiting the states from discriminating against
language minorities and requiring some jurisdictions with many
limited English speaking voters to provide bilingual ballots. The House
approved the legislation by a vote of <A HREF="House_HR123.html">259 to 169</A>, but the
Senate never took up the bill.

<HR>
<P>FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</P>
<P>This case came on for trial before the Honorable Kevin S.C. Chang on
September 10, 1996. Plaintiffs Ninia Baehr, Genora Dancel, Tammy Rodrigues,
Antoinette Pregil, Pat Lagon, and Joseph Melillo were represented by attorneys
Daniel R. Foley, Evan Wolfson and Kirk H. Cashmere. Defendant Lawrence H. Miike
was represented by Deputy Attorney Generals Rick J. Eichor and Lawrence Goya.
The Court having reviewed all the evidence admitted at the trial and having
considered the arguments and other written -l- submissions of counsel for the
parties and the briefs filed by the amicus curiae, hereby makes the following
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.</P>
<P>FINDINGS OF FACTS</P>
<P>I. THE PARTIES</P>
<P>1.  At all times relevant herein, Plaintiffs Ninia Baehr, Genora Dancel,
Tammy Rodrigues, Antoinette Pregil, Pat Lagon and Joseph Melillo (hereinafter

collectively referred to as &quot;Plaintiffs&quot;) were or are residents of the

City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>2.  Defendant Lawrence H. Miike (&quot;Defendant&quot;) is a resident of the
City and County of Honolulu. State of Hawaii. Defendant Miike is sued in his
official capacity as Director of Department of Health, State of Hawaii. [When
this lawsuit was commenced, John Lewin was the Director of Department of Health,
State of Hawaii. Thereafter, pursuant to Rule 43(c) of the Hawaii Rules of
Appellate Procedure, Defendant Miike was automatically substituted for Defendant
Lewin when he assumed the position of the Director of Department of Health,
State of Hawaii. A Notice of Substitution of Parties was also filed by defense
counsel on April 23, 1996.]
</P>
<P>II. RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY</P>
<P>3. Plaintiffs filed their Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief (&quot;Complaint&quot;)
on May 1, 1991.</P>
<P>4. In pertinent part, Plaintiffs' Complaint alleges that on or about
December 17, 1990, Defendant and his agent denied the applications for marriage
licenses presented by Plaintiffs Baehr and Dancel, Plaintiffs Rodrigues and
Pregil and Plaintiffs Lagon and Melillo, respectively, solely on the ground that
the couples are of the same sex. Plaintiffs sought a judicial declaration that
the construction and application of Hawaii Revised Statutes (&quot;HRS&quot;)
572-1 to deny an application for a license to marry because an applicant couple
is of the same sex is unconstitutional.</P>
<P>5. Defendant filed an Amended Answer to Complaint on June 7, 1991. In

pertinent part, Defendant admitted that Plaintiffs Baehr and Dancel, Plaintiffs
Rodrigues and Pregil and Plaintiffs Lagon and Melillo applied for marriage
licenses on December 17, 1990, and that the couples applications for marriage
licenses were denied by Defendant through his agent on the ground that the
couples are of the same sex.</P>
<P>6. On July 9, 1991, Defendant filed a Motion For Judgement on the Pleading
which sought a dismissal of the lawsuit. Defendant asserted, in pertinent part,
that Plaintiffs in their Complaint had failed to state a claim against Defendant
upon which relief could be granted.</P>
<P>7. A hearing was held on Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings on
September 3, 1991.</P>
<P>8. An Order Granting Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleading was
filed on October 1, 1991. A Judgment in favor of Defendant and against
Plaintiffs was also filed on October 1, 1991. 9. Plaintiffs filed their Notice
of Appeal to the Supreme Court of the State of Hawaii on October 17, 1991.</P>
<P>10. In Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 852 P.2d 44 (1993), the Hawaii Supreme
Court vacated the circuit courts order and judgment in favor of Defendant and
remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings. In pertinent
part, the Hawaii Supreme Court directed the following.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>On remand, in accordance with the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard, the
burden will rest on [Defendant] to overcome the presumption that HRS 572-1 is
unconstitutional by demonstrating that it furthers compelling state interests
and is narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgments of constitutional rights.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CITE>Id</CITE>., 74 Haw. at 583 (citations omitted).</P>
<P>11. On May 17, 1993, Defendant filed a motion for reconsideration or
clarification to the Hawaii Supreme Court.</P>
<P>12. On May 27, 1993, the Hawaii Supreme Court granted Defendant's motion for
reconsideration, or, in the alternative, for clarification in part, and
clarified the mandate on remand as follows.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Because, for the reasons stated in the plurality opinion filed in the
above-captioned matter on May 5, 1993, the circuit court erroneously granted
Lewin's motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the plaintiffs'
complaint, the circuit court's order and judgment are vacated and the matter is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with the plurality opinion. On
remand, in accordance with the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard, the burden
will rest on [Defendant] to overcome the presumption that HRS 572-1 is
unconstitutional by demonstrating that it furthers compelling state interests
and is narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgments of constitutional rights.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Baehr v. Lewin 74 Haw. 530, 852 P.2d 44 (1993), reconsideration and
clarification granted in part, 74 Haw. 645, 852 P.2d 74 (1993) (citations
omitted).</P>
<P>13. An Order of Early Assignment to Trial Judge was filed on May 5, 1995.</P>
<P>14. On July 13, 1995, Defendant Director of Health's Motion for Reservation
of Questions to the Supreme Court of Hawaii and for Stay Pending Appeal, or, in
the alternative for Stay Pending the Action of The Commission on Sexual
Orientation and the Law and of The Eighteenth Legislature filed on July 5, 1995,
was granted in part, and the trial in the above-captioned case was rescheduled
from September 25, 1995 to July 15, 1996. See Order Denying Defendant Director

of Health's Motion for Reservation of Questions to the Supreme Court of Hawaii
and for Stay Pending Appeal, and Granting Alternative Motion for Stay of Trial
Pending the Action of The Commission on Sexual Orientation and the Law and of
The Eighteenth Legislature filed on September 7, 1995.</P>
<P>15. A Notice of Change of Responsible Deputy was filed on April 18, 1996,
which stated that responsibility for handling of the case on behalf of the
Defendant had been changed to Deputy Attorney General Rick J. Eichor.</P>
<P>16. Following a status conference with counsel on April 19, 1996, a
Stipulation to Continue Trial Date and Order was filed on May 9, 1996. As a
result, the trial in the above-captioned case was continued from the week of
August 1, 1996 to September 10, 1996.</P>
<P>III. DEFENDANT'S POSITION</P>
<P>17. The directive of the Hawaii Supreme Court is clear. Pursuant to the
mandate of the Supreme Court, Defendant has the burden of proof in this case.
Id.</P>
<P>18. Defendant's First Amended Pretrial Statement was filed on May 13, 1996.
In pertinent part, Defendant stated the following.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[A]ll that remains is for the State to show that there is a compelling State
interest to deny Plaintiff marriage licenses because they are of the same sex
and that this compelling interest is narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary
abridgments of constitutional rights.</P>
<P>The following substantial and compelling state interests will he shown:</P>
<P>a. That the State has a compelling interest in protecting the health and

a marital setting. . . .</P>
<P>c. That the State has a compelling interest in securing or assuring

<P>d. That the State has a compelling interest in protecting the State's public
fisc from the reasonably foreseeable effects of State approval of same-sex
marriage in the laws of Hawaii. . . .</P>
<P>e. That the State has a compelling state interest in protecting civil
liberties, including the reasonably foreseeable effects of State approval of
same-sex marriages, on its citizens.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Defendant's First Amended Pretrial Statement at pages 2-4.</P>
<P>19. Defendant's Pre-Trial Memorandum was filed on September 6, 1996. In
pertinent part, Defendant asserted the following.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The State of Hawaii has a compelling interest to promote the optimal
development of children. . . . It is the State of Hawaii's position that, all
things being equal, it is best for a child that it be raised in a single home by
its parents, or at least by a married male and female. . . .</P>
<P>The marriage law furthers the compelling state interest of securing or
assuring recognition of Hawaii marriages in other jurisdictions. . . .</P>
<P>The marriage law furthers the compelling state interest in protecting the
public fisc from the reasonably foreseeable effects of approval of same-sex
marriage.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Defendant's Pre-Trial Memorandum at pages 1, 2 and 4.</P>
<P>20. Defense counsel acknowledged Defendant's burden of proof and, in
pertinent part, stated the following in his Opening Statement. &quot;The State
has a compelling interest in promoting the optimal development of children. . .
. It is the State's policy to pursue the optimal development of children, to
unite children with their mothers and fathers, and to have mothers and fathers
take responsibility for their children.&quot; Trial Transcript (&quot;Tr.&quot;)
9/10/96. pages 4-5.</P>
<P>IV. DEFENDANT'S WITNESSES</P>
<P>21. Defendant presented testimony from the following expert witnesses: (1)
Kyle D. Pruett, M.D.; (2) David Eggebeen, Ph.D.; (3) Richard Williams, Ph.D.:
and (4) Thomas S. Merrill, Ph D.</P>
<P>22. Dr. Kyle Pruett is an expert in the field of psychiatry, specializing in
child development. Beginning in 1981 and continuing for a ten-year period, Dr.
Pruett conducted a longitudinal study of fifteen families with young children
with regard to the developmental competence of children raised primarily by
their fathers in intact families. At the end of his study, Dr. Pruett found that
children raised by families with primarily paternal care in the early months and
years of life are competent and robust in their development, and are not sources
of clinical concern.</P>
<P>23. In pertinent part, Dr. Pruett found that there were unique paternal
contributions made by a father which had a positive effect on the following: (1)
a child's self-esteem and feelings of being loved and important to the family;
(2) a child's ability to cope with frustration and discouragement; (3) a child's
interest in generative or creative matters; and (4) a child's gender
flexibility.</P>

<P>24. However, Dr. Pruett also stated that the unique or non-replicable
contributions offered by a father (and the unique contributions offered by a
mother) are &quot;small&quot;, in comparison to the contributions that parents
make together to their children.</P>
<P>Tr. 9/10/96, page 84. Dr. Pruett conceded that the beneficial results
described above are not essential to being a happy, healthy and well-adjusted
child. Tr. 9/10/96, pages 86-87.</P>
<P>25. Dr. Pruett testified that biological parents have a predisposition which
helps them in parenting children. The predisposition is based upon the following
factors: (1) chromosomal or genetic contributions; (2) the parents' choice and
timing of conception or procreation; (3) the physical changes to the mother's
body and the father's observations and interaction with those changes; (4)
immediate bonding upon the child's birth; and (5) a predisposition to sacrifice
and make one's self secondary to the needs of the child.</P>
<P>26. Dr. Pruett also expressed his belief that children which are adopted or
are the result of assisted reproduction live in a &quot;burden[ed] system.&quot;
Tr. 9/10/96, pages 58, 62.</P>
<P>27. Dr. Pruett stated that same-sex relationships do not provide the same
type of learning model or experience for children as does male-female parenting,
because there is an overabundance of information about one gender and little
information about the other gender. Tr. 9/10/96, page 63.</P>
<P>28. Nevertheless, Dr. Pruett also stated that same-sex parents can, and do,
produce children-with a clear sense of gender identity. Tr. 9/10/96, pages 106.</P>
<P>29. Dr. Pruett stated the following with respect to raising children in a
same-sex marriage environment.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. And in comparing same sex parenting with opposite sex parenting, which is
more likely to pose greater developmental difficulties for children?</P>
<P>A. In terms of probability, same-sex marriages are more likely to provide a
more burdened nurturing domain.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Tr. 9/10/96, page 63.</P>
<P>30. It is Dr. Pruett's opinion that most children are more likely to reach
their optimal development being raised in an intact family by their mother and
father. According to Dr. Pruett, this family configuration presents the fewest
burdens on child development. Tr. 9/10/96, page 63.</P>
<P>31. However, Dr. Pruett also stated that single parents, gay fathers,
lesbian mothers and same-sex couples have the potential to, and often do, raise
children that are happy, healthy and well-adjusted. Tr.  9/10/96, page 69.</P>
<P>32. Dr. Pruett testified that single parents, gay fathers, lesbian mothers,
adoptive parents, foster parents and same-sex couples can be, and do become,
good parents. Tr. 9/10/96, page 71. Significantly, Dr. Pruett knows the
foregoing to be true based on his clinical experience. Tr. 9/10/96, page 72.</P>
<P>33. More specifically, Dr. Pruett stated that parents' sexual orientation
does not disqualify them from being good, fit, loving or successful parents. Tr.
9/10/96, page 72.</P>
<P>34. Dr. Pruett agreed that, in general, gay and lesbian parents are as fit
and loving parents as non-gay persons and couples. Tr. 9/10/96, page 73.</P>
<P>35. Same-sex couples have the same capability as different-sex couples to
manifest the qualities conducive to good parenting. Tr. 9/10/96, page 75.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dr. Pruett testified as follows.</P>
<P>Q. And you've seen same-sex couples that have those qualities [to being good
parents]?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. And have made good parents?</P>
<P>A. And have made good parents, yes.</P>
<P>Q. And good parents as a couple?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Tr. 9/10/96, page 75.</P>
<P>36. Dr. Pruett also agreed that same-sex couples should be allowed to adopt
children, provide foster care and to take children in and raise and care for
them. Tr. 9/10/96, page 73.</P>
<P>37. Importantly, Dr. Pruett testified that the quality of the nurturing
relationship between parent and child could, and would, outweigh any limitation
or burden imposed on the child as a result of having same-sex parents. Tr.
9/10/96, page 79.</P>
<P>38. Finally, when questioned regarding research performed by Charlotte
Patterson regarding children raised by samesex couples, Dr. Pruett expressed his
agreement with the general conclusions reached by Dr. Patterson. Tr. 9/10/96,
pages 132-133.</P>
<P>More specifically, Dr. Pruett agreed with the following conclusions, that
gay and lesbian parents &quot;are doing a good job&quot; and that &quot;the kids
are turning out just fine.&quot; Tr. 9/10/96, pages 133-134.</P>
<P>Dr. Pruett was not surprised by Dr. Patterson's conclusions. In fact, they
are what he expected to see, and although Dr. Pruett questions Dr. Patterson's
research methodology, he is not aware of any data, research or literature which
disputes Dr. Patterson's findings and conclusions. Tr. 9/10/96, pages 132-134.</P>
<P>39. Dr. David Eggebeen is an expert in the field of sociology with a special
emphasis in demographics related to family and children.</P>
<P>40. In pertinent part, Dr. Eggebeen testified regarding changes or trends
which have occurred in partnering, child bearing and labor force behavior in the
United States. For example, Dr. Eggebeen testified regarding the following
facts: (1) the marriage rate in the U.S. population has declined over the past
twenty years; (2) the median age of marriage for women in the U.S. population
has risen over the past twenty years; (3) the annual divorce rate in the U.S.
population has increased over the past approximate thirty years; (4) the number
of young adults currently cohabiting has increased over the past eight years;
(5) the birth rate for women in the U.S. population has decreased over the past
twenty years; (6) the number of proportionate births to non-married women in
certain racial groups has increased over the past thirty years; and (7) the
number of women in the labor force in the U.S. population and the number of
working mothers with children under the age of six has increased dramatically
over the past thirty years.</P>
<P>41. Based on his studies of the changes referred above, Dr. Eggebeen
testified as follows.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[C]hildren are going through fundamental changes in the structure of
childhood and what we're seeing today is children today are living in very
different circumstances than was evident or the case in the past. It's common
today to find children in single parent families. It's common today to find
children in single parent families. It's common today to find children living
with a mother who never married. It's common today to find children in remarried
families. It's common today to find children in dual earner families where both
parents participate in the type of work. It is common or getting common to find
children whose parents never married and they're cohabiting.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Tr. 9/11/96, pages 32-33.</P>
<P>42. However, Dr. Eggebeen also testified that, as of 1990, almost six out of
ten children in the United States are living in families where their parents are
married and both of the parents are biological parents of the child.</P>
<P>43. Dr. Eggebeen explained further that &quot;. . . children have gone
through substantial changes in their lives. . . [T]here is greater diversity in
living arrangements and family --- in families that children live today in the
'9Os. However, a substantial percentage of children remain or will spend their
childhood in . . . traditional kinds of family structures.&quot; Tr. 9/11/96,
page 38.</P>
<P>44. Based on his research, Dr. Eggebeen concluded that marriage is a &quot;gateway
to becoming a parent,&quot; and marriage is synonymous with having children. Tr.
9/11/96, page 42.</P>
<P>45. However, Dr. Eggebeen also testified that individuals get married
without intending to have children, or marry and are biologically unable to have
children. Further, the absence of the intent or the ability to have children
does not weaken the institution of marriage.</P>
<P>In fact, Dr. Eggebeen recognized that people marry and want to get married
for reasons other than having children; that those reasons are valuable and
important; and that regardless of children, it is beneficial to society for
adults to marry. Dr. Eggebeen testified that individuals should not be
prohibited from marriage simply because they cannot have children.</P>
<P>Tr. 9/11/96, pages 55-57.</P>
<P>46. Dr. Eggebeen testified that children raised in a single parent home are
at a &quot;heightened risk&quot;, as compared to children raised in a married
couple family. Tr. 9/11/96, page 43. According to Dr. Eggebeen, children in a
single parent family are at greater risk  for the following: (1) poverty or
economic hardship; (2) poor academic performance; (3) behavior problems and
conduct disorders; and (4) premarital or teenage birth for girls.</P>

<P>47. Dr. Eggebeen stated that remarriage or cohabiting with a step-parent
does not lessen or eliminate the risks to children from single parent families.
&quot;[C]hildren in a remarriage family. . . do not seem to perform any
differently than children who remain in single parent families and therefore
their performance or the risk of poor outcomes is about the same as is for
children in single parent families.&quot; Tr. 9/11/96, page 46.</P>
<P>48. Dr. Eggebeen suggested that the lack of improvement in risk factors in
remarriage or step-parent families may be attributable to &quot;the role
ambiguity of step parent relationships,&quot; characteristics which a
step-parent brings to the family and which adversely affect the children or the
absence of a biological relationship with the children. Tr. 9/11/96, pages
46-48. With respect to the latter, Dr. Eggebeen related the story of Cinderella
and her evil stepmother. Tr. 9/11/96, page 48.</P>
<P>49. Dr. Eggebeen equates a same-sex couple with children to a step-parent
situation with all of the above-described risk factors. Specifically, Dr.
Eggebeen testified that &quot;same-sex marriages where children [are] involved
is by definition a step parent relationship,&quot; because there is one parent
who is not the biological parent of the child. Tr. 9/11/96, pages 49.</P>
<P>50. However, Dr. Eggebeen conceded that there are some situations involving
a same-sex couple which would not fit the classic step-parent scenario. For
example, a situation involving a same-sex couple that sought and received
reproductive assistance and in which the non-biological parent was fully
involved from the beginning of the planning process, was present throughout the
nine month period and at birth, and thereafter, raised the child as though they
were the biological parents of the child. Tr. 9/11/96, pages 114-115.</P>
<P>51. Dr. Eggebeen also testified that single parents, adoptive parents,
lesbian mothers, gay fathers and same-sex couples can create stable family

environments and raise healthy and well-adjusted children. Tr. 9/11/96, page 82.</P>
<P>52. It is Dr. Eggebeen's opinion that gay and lesbian couples can, and do,
make excellent parents and that they are capable of raising a healthy child. Tr.
9/11/96, page 83.</P>
<P>53. Dr. Eggebeen agrees that gay and lesbian parents should be allowed to
adopt children and serve as foster parents. </P>
<P>Tr. 9/11/96, page 85.</P>
<P>54. Dr. Eggebeen testified that cohabiting same-sex couples are less stable
than married couples. However, the sole basis for Dr. Eggebeen's conclusion is a
chart taken from the book entitled <I>American Couples</I>, co-authored by
Pepper Schwartz, Ph.D.  The chart which summarizes approximately twenty year old
information is Defendant's Exhibit Q, and depicts a comparison of the
percentages of married, gay and lesbian couples, respectively, which had stayed
together or broken up over periods of time.</P>
<P>Dr. Eggebeen testified that Exhibit Q is the best data that he could find
which proves that gay and lesbian couples have substantially higher break up
rates over time than married different sex couples. Tr. 9/11/96, pages 73-74.
Dr. Eggebeen admitted that he has done limited research on the subject of same
sex couples and gay and lesbian parenting, and agrees that Charlotte Patterson
and Pepper Schwartz are experts in the fields.  Tr. 9/11/96, pages 131-132.</P>
<P>55. Finally, and importantly, Dr. Eggebeen stated that children of same-sex
couples would be helped if their families had access to or were able to receive
the following benefits of marriage: (1) state income tax advantages; (2) public
assistance; (3) enforcement of child support, alimony or other support orders;
(4) inheritance rights; and (5) the ability to prosecute wrongful death actions.
Dr. Eggebeen also agreed that children of same-sex couples would be helped if
their families received the social status derived from marriage. Tr. 9/11/96,
pages 89-92.</P>
<P>56. Dr. Richard Williams is an expert in the field of psychology with
special expertise in qualitative and quantitative research and research methods,
statistical analysis and construction of research studies.</P>
<P>57. Dr. Williams was asked by defense counsel to review and analyze studies
of children raised by gay and lesbian parents.  He reviewed approximately twenty
to thirty studies, and eventually selected nine studies to critique.</P>
<P>58. At trial, Dr. Williams presented commentary regarding nine research
studies which defense counsel anticipated that Plaintiffs' expert witnesses
would rely upon for their testimony and opinions in this case.</P>
<P>Dr. Williams' general criticism of the nine studies included the following:
(1) there was non-representative sampling of heterosexual, gay and lesbian
parents; (2) inadequate sample size was employed; and (3) comparison groups used
in the studies were not comparable in terms of household make up. Dr Williams
also presented specific criticism as to each of the nine referenced studies .</P>
<P>59. The testimony of Dr. Williams is not persuasive or believable because of
his expressed bias against the social sciences, which include the fields of
psychology and sociology.</P>
<P>For example, Dr. Williams believes that a majority of the studies in the
social sciences have theoretical or methodological flaws. Tr. 9/12/96, pages
71-72. According to Dr. Williams, modern psychology is so flawed that no fix,
reconciliation or overhaul can correct it. Tr. 9/12/96, page 70.</P>
<P>60. Further, even assuming that research studies are conducted properly, Dr.
Williams still doubts the ultimate value of psychology and other social
sciences. Tr. 9/12/96, page 73.</P>
<P>61. At times, Dr. Williams expressed severe views. For example, Dr. Williams
believes that there is no scientific proof that evolution occurred. Tr. 9/12/96,
page 80.</P>
<P>62. Finally, Dr. Williams admitted that his critique of studies regarding
gay and lesbian parenting is a minority position.</P>
<P>Tr. 9/12/96, pages 74-75.</P>
<P>63. Defendant's last witness was Thomas Merrill, Ph.D. Dr. Merrill is an
expert in the field of psychology, including the areas of human development,
gender development and relationships relative to children and their development.</P>
<P>64. Dr. Merrill is a psychologist in private practice in Honolulu, Hawaii.
His clinical experience with families involving one or two gay or lesbian
parents is limited. Dr. Merrill has not testified as an expert in Family Court
cases which involved the sexual orientation of a parent or a same-sex couple and
the custody of a child. He has not participated in or conducted any study which
focused on the children of gay and lesbian parents. Tr. 9/13/96, page 36.</P>
<P>65. Dr. Merrill examined the issue of same-sex versus opposite sex parent
and child development for the first time as a result of his retention in this
case. Tr. 9/13/96, page 35.</P>
<P>66. In pertinent part, Dr. Merrill testified that the parental relationship
is an important learning model for children and that it is significant to have
opposite sex parents for a child's learning. Tr. 9/13/96, pages 12-13.</P>
<P>67. Dr. Merrill stated that different-sex parents are important because both
parents serve as models and as objects for a child's learning and development.
Dr. Merrill explained as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We interact with -- and when I say identify, we measure and develop ourself
in relationship to our same gender parent. We also identify our relationship
with our opposite sex parents and there are different developmental stages where
that relationship with the opposite sex parent is equal to or more important
than our development -- our relationship at the moment with the same gender
parent.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Tr. 9/13/96, page 13.</P>
<P>68. According to Dr. Merrill, although replacement of a biological parent is
certainly possible, as in the case of remarriage and adoption, it would result
in the presence of a different influence on the child and the child's

developmental outcome may be different. Tr. 9/13/96, pages 20-21.</P>
<P>69. Dr. Merrill testified that same-sex parents do provide a learning
experience for a child. However, Dr. Merrill stated that there is insufficient
information regarding the effects of being raised by gay or lesbian parents on
the development of a child. Tr. 9/13/96, page 22.</P>
<P>As a result, Dr. Merrill has no opinion regarding the development of
children in a family with same-sex parents.  Specifically, he cannot say whether
or not children raised in a same-sex family environment will develop to be
healthy, well-adjusted adults. Tr. 9/13/96, page 38.</P>
<P>70. At the close of his direct examination, Dr. Merrill presented the
following opinions.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. In your opinion, to a reasonable degree of psychological probability, in
what family structure are children most likely to reach their optimal
development?</P>
<P>A. Children are most apt to reach their optimal level of development as
exhibited in terms of their adjustment as adults in a family in which there is a
limited amount of strife, a maximum amount of nurturing, a maximum amount of
support, a maximum amount of guidance, a maximum amount of leadership, and a
very strong and intimate bond between parents and child.</P>
<P>Q. And does the presence of the mother and father improve the likelihood
that there will be a strong bond?</P>
<P>A. That would be a significant part of the maximum optimum environment in
which to raise a child, yes.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Tr. 9/13/96, pages 32-33.</P>
<P>71. Dr. Merrill testified that the sexual orientation of a parent is not an
indication of parental fitness. Tr. 9/13/96, page 46.</P>
<P>72. Dr. Merrill also agreed that gay and lesbian couples with children do
have successful relationships. Tr. 9/13/96, page 46.</P>
<P>73. On one occasion, Dr. Merrill was retained by two attorneys to do a
custody evaluation in a case involving a same-sex relationship on the mother's
side. In part, he was asked to address children's development issues. Dr.
Merrill testified that the fact that there was a same-sex relationship on the
mother's side was not an issue and did not affect his evaluation in the case.
Tr. 9/13/96, page 34.</P>
<P>74. Finally, and in pertinent part, Dr. Merrill testified as follows.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. Now, doctor, do you think the children, regardless of whether they have a
mother and a father, male-female parents, single parents, adoptive parents, gay
and lesbian parents, same gender parents, should have the same opportunity in
society to reach their optimum development, each child?</P>
<P>A. Yes, I do.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Tr. 9/13/96, page 45.</P>
<P>Dr. Merrill further stated that children should not be denied benefits, such
as health care, education and housing based on the status of their parents.
Opposite-sex, same-sex, single and adoptive parent status should not be a basis
to deny benefits to children. Tr. 9/13/96, page 46.</P>
<P>V. PLAINTIFFS' WITNESSES</P>
<P>75. Although Plaintiffs do not have the burden of proof in this case, they
nevertheless presented testimony from the following expert witnesses: (1) Pepper
Schwartz, Ph.D; (2) Charlotte Patterson, Ph.D.; (3) David Brodzinsky, Ph.D; and
(4) Robert Bidwell, M.D.</P>
<P>76. The court found the testimony of Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Brodzinsky to be
especially credible.</P>
<P>Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Brodzinsky are well-qualified individuals. See
Plaintiffs' Exhibits 1 and 2, respectively.</P>
<P>At trial, each of them testified in a knowledgeable, informative and
straightforward manner worthy of belief. In general, the expert opinions of Dr.
Schwartz and Dr. Brodzinsky appear to be well-founded based on their significant
research and analysis, and their clinical and professional experience,
respectively.</P>
<P>77. Dr. Schwartz is an expert in sociology and interdisciplinary studies of
sexuality with a special expertise in gender and human sexuality, marriage and
the family, and same-sex relations in parenting and research. She testified, in
pertinent part, to the following.</P>
<P>78. Initially, Dr. Schwartz discussed her book, <I>American Couples</I>.
Dr. Schwartz specifically addressed a chart taken from the book and relied upon
by Defendant. According to Dr Schwartz, the data contained in Defendant's
Exhibit Q represents the following: (1) that there is a substantially higher
break up rate for all three kinds of couples (gay men, lesbian and cohabitors)
than there is for married couples; and (2) married couples have an advantage
that keeps them together longer than other kinds of couples. Tr. 9/16/96, pages
47-48.</P>
<P>79. Dr. Schwartz noted that the data presented in <I>American Couples</I>
was collected in the late '70s and up until 1980 or 1981. Since that time, there
have been significant changes in society. For example, the entry of AIDS into
gay male life and society, has made people more cautious and less likely to have
multiple partners and more desirous of settling down. Gay men, in particular,
have been hardest hit by the disease and it has made monogomy and couplehood
more attractive.</P>
<P>Additionally, there is now a trend in which people contemplate and want to
be more serious, to make families and to engage in long-term committed
relationships. This is a large change from the attitudes of the late '70s and
early '80s. Tr. 9/16/96, page 54-56.</P>
<P>80. Dr. Schwartz testified that heterosexual and homosexual people want to
get married. Tr. 9/16/96, pages 58-59,</P>
<P>65. The doctor stated specifically:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[T]hey want companionship, they want love, they want trust, they want
someone who will be with them through thick and thin. They're looking for a live
and a love partner. . . . [I]n our own [culture] it's an aspiration for --- for
intimacy and security. And that is the definition of marriage as people first
and primarily think of it.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Tr. 9/16/96, page 59.</P>
<P>81. Dr. Schwartz stated that same-sex couples can, and do, have successful,
loving and committed relationships. Tr. 9/16/96, page 129.</P>
<P>82. Dr. Schwartz also identified practical, economic, legal, social and
psychological benefits of marriage and reasons for people to marry. Tr. 9/16/96,
pages 59-65.</P>
<P>83. Dr. Schwartz testified that the sexual orientation of parents is not an
indicator of parental fitness. Tr. 9/16/96, page 128.</P>
<P>84. Dr. Schwartz also testified that gay and lesbian parents and same-sex
couples are as fit and loving parents, as non-gay persons and different-sex
couples. Tr. 9/16/96, page 127.</P>
<P>85. Dr. Schwartz believes that the primary quality of parenting is not the
parenting structure, or biology, but is the nurturing relationship between
parent and child. Tr. 9/16/96, page 129.</P>
<P>86. Dr. Schwartz also believes that children should not be denied benefits
and protections because of the status of their parents. Tr. 9/16/96, pages
129-130.</P>
<P>87. Dr. Schwartz has the following opinions.</P>
<P>First, there is no reason related to the promotion of the optimal
development of children why same-sex couples should not be permitted to marry.
Tr. 9/16/96, page 130.</P>
<P>Second, allowing same-sex couples to marry would not have a negative impact
on society or the institution of marriage. Dr. Schwartz testified, &quot;[T]here
would be no dishonor and no ultimate fragility to the institution [of marriage]
by including gays and lesbians.&quot; Tr. 9/16/96, pages 130-131. </P>
<P>Third, allowing same-sex couples to marry would have a positive impact on
society and the institution of marriage. Dr. Schwartz stated the following.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I think that marriage is really a high state of hope and effort for people.
I think when we deny it to people we say that --- that there's some other
location for love and raising children and that we're not as concerned about
these kids' welfare or in some ways we don't think it would be good for them to
be in a married home. It's not that those children don't exist, it's not that
those families don't exist, they do.</P>
<P>To me, I think that most Americans believe in marriage strongly. I believe
by taking other people into the fold and asking that they behave as responsible
to their children to give them support to have both rituals to enter into their
relationships and legal complications by exiting them, that we shore up how
important we think marriage is.  I think it --- I think it in no way undermines
it and I think it strengthens it by our insistence about how important it is and
why we hope this will be available for all families.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Tr. 9/16/96, pages 131-132.</P>
<P>88. Dr. Charlotte Patterson is an expert in the field of psychology of child
development with a special expertise in lesbian and gay parenting and the
development of children of lesbian and gay parents. She testified, in pertinent
part, to the following.</P>
<P>89. Dr. Patterson is a professor at the University of Virginia. She has
completed two studies regarding the children of lesbian and gay parents.</P>
<P>90. The first study is known as the Bay Area Family Study. The study
involved thirty-seven families, all of which had at least one child between the
ages of four and nine. In every case, the children had either been born to women
who identified themselves as lesbian at the time of the study, or who adopted
children early in life. Data in the Bay Area Family Study was collected in 1990
and 1991.</P>
<P>91. According to Dr. Patterson, the main result of the Bay Area Family Study
was a conclusion that the particular group of children, when compared to
available norms, appeared to be developing in a normal fashion. Tr. 9/17/96,
pages 23-24.</P>

<P>However, Dr. Patterson also noted a finding that the children of the lesbian
mothers sample were more likely to express that they felt (within a normal
range) symptoms of stress in their lives, as compared to children in the normal
sample. The children who described symptoms of stress also said that they felt
an overall sense of well-being about themselves in their lives.  Although she
has two plausible explanations, Dr. Patterson does not have a definitive
interpretation or explanation for the above finding. Tr. 9/17/96, page 25.</P>
<P>Dr. Patterson agreed that the sample group of lesbian mothers in the Bay
Area Family Study, when considering ethnic background, education, income, and
other socioeconomic factors is not representative of women and all mothers in
America. Tr. 9/17/96, pages 81-84.</P>
<P>92. Dr. Patterson's second study is known as the Contemporary Family Study.
The study involved eighty families who conceived a child using the resources of
the Sperm Bank of California. and all of which had at least one child that was
at least five years old at the time of the study. Fifty-five of the families
were headed by lesbian mothers. The remaining twenty-five families were headed
by heterosexual parents. Most of the data for this study was collected in 1994
and 1995.</P>
<P>93. The three main conclusions of the Contemporary Family Study are as
follows: (1) as a group, the children born as a result of donor insemination
were developing normally; (2) sexual orientation of the parents was not a good
predictor of how well children do in terms of a child's well-being and
adjustment; and (3) irrespective of their parents' sexual orientation, children
who live in a harmonious family environment had better reports from parents and
teachers. Tr. 9/17/96, pages 36-37.</P>
<P>94. Based on her studies and review of other research, Dr. Patterson
testified as follows. A biological relationship between parent and child is not
essential to raising a healthy child. The quality of parenting which a child
receives is more important than a biological connection or the gender of a
parent.</P>
<P>Tr. 9/17/96, pages 42-43.</P>
<P>95. According to Dr. Patterson, there is no data or research which
establishes that gay fathers and lesbian mothers are less capable of being good
parents than non-gay people and which supports denying gay people the ability to
adopt and raise children. Tr. 9/17/96, page 52.</P>
<P>96. Dr. Patterson believes that gay and lesbian people and same-sex couples
are as fit and loving parents as non-gay people and different-sex couples.
Further, sexual orientation is not an indicator of parental fitness. Tr.
9/17/96, pages 53-54.</P>
<P>97. Dr. Patterson testified that same-sex couples can, and do, have
successful, loving and committed relationships. Tr. 9/17/96, pages 54.</P>
<P>98. Dr. Patterson presented the following opinion.  There is no reason
related to the promotion of the development of children why same-sex couples
should not be permitted to marry.</P>
<P>Tr. 9/17/96, page 55.</P>
<P>99. Dr. David Brodzinsky is an expert in the fields of psychology and child
development with a special expertise in adoption and other forms of
nonbiological parenting and the development of children raised by nonbiological
parents.</P>
<P>100. Dr. Brodzinsky counsels children and families in a clinical setting and
also has an academic appointment at Rutgers University. In the academic setting,
Dr. Brodzinsky does research, teaches, directs a program on counseling foster
children and does clinical supervision. He has been at Rutgers University since
1974.</P>
<P>Dr. Brodzinsky serves as a consultant to several adoption agencies in New
Jersey and New York and is a founding director of the Adoption Institute, a
newly formed nonprofit organization, whose mission is to provide information and
education and promote research regarding adoption and adoption practices. In the
past ten to fifteen years, he has conducted research and written extensively on
the psychology of adoption, foster care, stress and coping in children.</P>
<P>101. In his clinical practice, Dr. Brodzinsky has worked with gay and
lesbian parents. He has provided counseling over the years to approximately
forty families headed by same-sex parents and same-sex couples. In pertinent
part, Dr. Brodzinsky testified as follows.</P>
<P>102. Dr. Brodzinsky stated the following with respect to the following
question: &quot;Are there advantages to being raised by one's biological
parents?&quot;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The issue is not the structural variable, biological versus nonbiological,
one parent versus two parent. Those are kind of --- they hide, I think, really
what is going on. The issue is really the process variables, how children are
cared for, is the child provided warmth, is the child provided consistency of
care, is the child provided a stimulated environment, is the child given
support.  Those are the factors we can call, for lack of a better way of saying

it, sensitive care-giving which transcend whether you're a single parent, two
parent, biological, nonbiological.  The research shows that --- that those are
the factors that carry the biggest weight. And when you take a look at
structural variables, there's not all that much support that structural variable
in and of themselves are all that important.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Tr. 9/18/96, page 42.</P>
<P>103. Dr. Brodzinsky noted that same-sex parent adoptions occur and it is his
opinion that same-sex parent adoptions should be allowed. Tr. 9/18/96, page 49.
Dr. Brodzinsky explained as follows.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. As an expert in adoption and as a psychologist, do you believe that gay
men and lesbians, same-sex couples, should be continue to be allowed to adopt
children?</P>
<P>A. Absolutely.</P>

<P>Q. Why?</P>
<P>A. Because they are able to provide, like heterosexual couples or single
parents, warm and loving environments. They're --they're adopting children now.
They're doing a good job of it. Obviously, you know, when we --- when a person
seeks to adopt, there is an evaluation. It would be the same kind of an
evaluation. We would exclude a gay or lesbian individual for the same reason
that we would exclude a heterosexual individual. That is, if they had a
significant emotional problems or some other kind of factor that we felt, as --
as, you know, agency consultants, you know, would not -- would not predict well
to a child's well-being.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Tr. 9/18/96, pages 56-57.</P>
<P>104. Dr. Brodzinsky testified that the research shows that same-sex couples
and different-sex couples can be highly competent care-givers. The sexual
orientation of parents is not an indicator of parental fitness. Tr. 9/18/96,
page 50.</P>
<P>105. According to Dr. Brodzinsky, the primary quality of good parenting is
not the particular structure of the family or biology, but is the nurturing
relationship between parent and child. Tr. 9/18/96, page 63.</P>
<P>106. Dr. Brodzinsky believes that children adopted by same-sex couples are
not at any increased risk for behavioral or psychological problems. Tr. 9/18/96,
page 50.</P>
<P>107. Dr. Brodzinsky expressed his strong view regarding the issue of whether
there is a best family environment to raise children.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Q. Now, the State's arguments seem to suggest that we somehow need to
identify a best family for children, or as between mothers and fathers, we have
to pick a best parent. What's your position on that?</P>
<P>A. I find that offensive truthfully. I find it offensive because it tends to
suggest that there's only one way of being a parent.  It excludes all
nonbiological parenting which would be adoptive parenting, stepparenting, foster
parenting, parenting by gay and lesbians. It suggests that if there are some
additional issues that come with some of these nontraditional families that
should be reason for excluding rather than taking that information and using it
not in a punitive way but in a proactive, kind of supportive way to help
families deal with the inevitable issues that come up in life. And there are
going to be some unique issues in varying forms of family. But to talk about one
form of family that is best, I find that, you know, truthfully offensive and a
distortion of the research literature. And that's really why I'm here, you know,
to make sure that message comes across.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Tr. 9/18/96, pages 58-59.</P>
<P>108. Finally, it is Dr. Brodzinsky's opinion that there is no reason related
to the promotion of the development of children why same-sex couples should not
be permitted to marry. Tr. 9/18/96, page 63.</P>
<P>109. Dr. Robert Bidwell is an expert in pediatrics with a subspecialty in
adolescent medicine. Dr. Bidwell is the Director of Adolescent Medicine at
Kapiolani Medical Center and is also employed at the University of Hawaii
Department of Pediatrics with the John A. Burns School of Medicine. Dr. Bidwell
teaches medical students and pediatric residents in training, provides patient
care, and practices adolescent medicine and general pediatrics at Kapiolani
Medical Center.</P>
<P>110. In his clinical practice, Dr. Bidwell has treated children of same-sex
parents. He has provided medical services to hundreds of children with families
which included a single gay or lesbian parent or same-sex parents. In pertinent
part, Dr. Bidwell testified as follows.</P>
<P>111. Dr. Bidwell described the best environment to raise a healthy,
well-adjusted child or adolescent as being one in which &quot;there's all those
things that we associate with family, which is love and nurturance and guidance,
protection, safety.&quot; Tr. 9/19/96, pages 27-28.</P>
<P>112. According to Dr. Bidwell, gay and lesbian parents and same-sex couples
can, and do, provide an environment for their children. Tr. 9/19/96, page 29.</P>
<P>113. Dr. Bidwell testified that gay and lesbian parents and same-sex couples
raise children that are just as healthy and well-adjusted as those raised by
different-sex couples. Tr. 9/19/96, page 38.</P>
<P>114. Dr. Bidwell conceded- that he has worked with adolescents and teen-aged
children living in a same-sex family environment that have experienced
embarrassment, distress or a &quot;difficult time&quot; because their family &quot;is
not the same as the majority of families that surround them.&quot; However, the
doctor also described the situation as a phase in the child's development. He
said the following.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What's been reassuring to me is that -- that this has been a phase in their
development, that I do not know of any teenager who has not gotten through this
phase intact as a healthy adolescent. And, yes, I think there was pain. I think
that there may have been tears from time to time, wishing that things were
different. But I think it's -- I mean it's what we call growing up.  I mean
there are many different kinds of families. And all of our parents are different
in some way from what we would like to see. . . .</P>
<P>So I think my experience has been for the same -- has been the same for the
children of gay and lesbian parents, is that they may go through a rough time.
And not all of them do.  Remarkably, most of them, they make their
accommodations. They find ways to deal with it. But they get through these
periods. And if anything, I think they grow stronger through that experience.
They learn about life. They learn about diversity. And the research -- and
although I'm not a heavy-duty research person, I do look at the research.  The
research confirms that -- that teenagers get through this period.</P>
<P>But I guess to get back to your question, yes, there is a special experience
for these young people, and sometimes it's painful. But it doesn't do
developmental damage to these kids. If anything, it creates strength and
promotes growth.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Tr. 9/19/96, pages 30-32.</P>
<P>115. Finally, Dr. Bidwell believes that children of samesex parents would
benefit, with respect to their health, development and adjustment, if their
parents were married. Tr. 9/19/96, page 38.</P>
<P>VI. SPECIFIC FINDINGS</P>
<P>116. The following are specific findings of fact for this case based on the
credible evidence presented at trial.</P>
<P>117. Defendant presented insufficient evidence and failed to establish or
prove any adverse consequences to the public fisc resulting from same-sex
marriage.</P>
<P>118. Defendant presented insufficient evidence and failed to establish or
prove any adverse impacts to the State of Hawaii or its citizens resulting from
the refusal of other jurisdictions to recognize Hawaii same-sex marriages or
from application of the federal constitutional provision which requires other
jurisdictions to give full faith and credit recognition to Hawaii same-sex
marriages. See Article IV, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution (The Full Faith
and Credit Clause).</P>
<P>119. Defendant presented insufficient evidence and failed to establish or
prove the legal significance of the institution of traditional marriage and the
need to protect traditional marriage as a fundamental structure in society.</P>
<P>120. There is a public interest in the rights and wellbeing of children and
families. See H.R.S. Chapters 571 and 577.</P>
<P>121. A father and a mother can, and do, provide his or her child with unique
paternal and maternal contributions which are important, though not essential,
to the development of a happy, healthy and well-adjusted child.</P>
<P>122. Further, an intact family environment consisting of a child and his or
her mother and father presents a less burdened environment for the development
of a happy, healthy and well-adjusted child.</P>
<P>There certainly is a benefit to children which comes from being raised by
their mother and father in an intact and relatively stress free home.</P>
<P>123. However, there is diversity in the structure and configuration of
families. In Hawaii, and elsewhere, children are being raised by their natural
parents, single parents, stepparents, grandparents, adopted parents, hanai
parents, foster parents, gay and lesbian parents, and same-sex couples.</P>
<P>124. There are also families in Hawaii, and elsewhere, which do not have
children as family members.</P>
<P>125. The evidence presented by Plaintiffs and Defendant establishes that the
single most important factor in the development of a happy, healthy and
well-adjusted child is the nurturing relationship between parent and child.</P>
<P>More specifically, it is the quality of parenting or the &quot;sensitive
care-giving&quot; described by David Brodzinsky, which is the most significant
factor that affects the development of a child.</P>
<P>126. The sexual orientation of parents is not in and of itself an indicator
of parental fitness.</P>
<P>127. The sexual orientation of parents does not automatically disqualify
them from being good, fit, loving or successful parents.</P>
<P>128. The sexual orientation of parents is not in and of itself an indicator
of the overall adjustment and development of children.</P>
<P>129. Gay and lesbian parents and same-sex couples have the potential to
raise children that are happy, healthy and welladjusted.</P>
<P>130. Gay and lesbian parents and same-sex couples are allowed to adopt
children, provide foster care and to raise and care for children.</P>
<P>131. Gay and lesbian parents and same-sex couples can provide children with
a nurturing relationship and a nurturing environment which is conducive to the
development of happy, healthy and well-adjusted children.</P>
<P>132. Gay and lesbian parents and same-sex couples can be as fit and loving
parents, as non-gay men and women and differentsex couples.</P>
<P>133. While children of gay and lesbian parents and samesex couples may
experience symptoms of stress and other issues related to their non-traditional

family structure, the available scientific data, studies and clinical experience

presented at trial suggests that children of gay and lesbian parents and
same-sex couples tend to adjust and do develop-in a normal fashion.</P>
<P>134. Significantly, Defendant has failed to establish a causal link between
allowing same-sex marriage and adverse effects upon the optimal development of
children.</P>
<P>135. As noted herein, there is a benefit to children which comes from being
raised by their mother and father in an intact and relatively stress-free home.</P>
<P>However, in this case, Defendant has not proved that allowing same-sex
marriage will probably result in significant differences in the development or
outcomes of children raised by gay or lesbian parents and same-sex couples, as
compared to children raised by different-sex couples or their biological
parents.</P>
<P>In fact, Defendant's expert, Kenneth Pruett, agreed, in pertinent part, that
gay and lesbian parents &quot;are doing a good job&quot; raising children and,
most importantly, &quot;the kids are turning out just fine.&quot;</P>
<P>136. Contrary to Defendant's assertions, if same-sex marriage is allowed,
the children being raised by gay or lesbian parents and same-sex couples may be
assisted, because they may obtain certain protections and benefits that come
with or become available as a result of marriage. See Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw.
530, 560-561, 852 P.2d 44, 59 (1993), for a list of noteworthy marital rights
and benefits.</P>
<P>137. In Hawaii, and elsewhere, same-sex couples can, and do, have
successful, loving and committed relationships.</P>
<P>138. In Hawaii, and elsewhere, people marry for a variety of reasons
including, but not limited to the following: (1) having or raising children; (2)
stability and commitment; (3) Pmne1onal closeness (4) intimacy and monogamy; (5)
the establishment of a framework for a long-term relationship; (6) personal
significance; (7) recognition by society; and (8) certain legal and economic
protections, benefits and obligations. See Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 560-561,
852 P.2d 44, 59 (1993) for a list of noteworthy marital rights and benefits.</P>
<P>In Hawaii, and elsewhere. gay men and lesbian women share this same mix of

reasons for wanting to be able to marry.</P>
<P>139. Simply put, Defendant has failed to establish or prove that the public
interest in the well-being of children and families, or the optimal development
of children will be adversely affected by same-sex marriage.</P>
<P>140. If any of the above findings of fact shall be deemed conclusions of
law, the Court intends that every such finding shall he construed as a
conclusion of law.</P>
<P>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</P>
<P>1.  This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties to
this action. Venue is proper in the First Circuit Court. HRS 603-21.5 and
603-36.
</P>
<P>2.   The trier of fact determines the credibility of a witness and the
weight to be given to his or her testimony. In pertinent part, the trier of fact
may consider the witness' demeanor and manner while on the stand, the character
of his or her testimony as being probable or improbable, inconsistencies, patent
omissions and discrepancies in his or her testimony or between the testimony of
other witnesses, contradictory testimony or evidence, his or her interest in the
outcome to the case and other factors bearing upon the truthfulness or
untruthfulness of the witness' testimony. Younq Ah Chor v. Dulles, 270 F.2d 338!
341 (9th Cir., 1959); and Nani Koolau Co. v. Komo Construction, Inc., 5 Haw.
App. 137, 139-140, 681 P.2d 580, 584 (1984). In a non-jury trial, the
credibility of a witness is a matter for the trial court to determine and the
court can accept or reject the testimony of a witness in whole or in part. Lee
v. Kimura, 2 Haw. App. 538, 544, 634 P.2d 1043, 1047-1048 (1981).
</P>
<P>3.  Defendant's burden in this case is to &quot;overcome the presumption
that HRS 572-1 is unconstitutional by demonstrating that it furthers a
compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to avoid unnecessary
abridgements of constitutional rights.&quot;
</P>
<P>Baehr, 74 Haw. 530, 583, 852 P.2d 44, 74 (1993) citing Naqle v. Board of
Education, 63 Haw. 389, 392, 629 P.2d 109, 111 (1987) and Holdman v. Olim, 59
Haw. 346, 349, 581 P.2d 1164, 1167 (1978).</P>
<P>4. There is no fundamental right to marriage for same sex couples under
article I, section 6 of the Hawaii Constitution. Marriage is a state-conferred
legal status which gives rise to certain rights and benefits. Baehr v. Lewin, 74
Haw. 530, 557 and 560-561, 852 P.2d 44, 57 (1993).</P>
<P>5. The Department of Health, State of Hawaii, has the exclusive authority to
issue licenses to marriage applicants.</P>
<P>Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 560, 852 P.2d 44, 59 (1993).</P>
<P>6. There are certain rights and benefits which accompany the state-conferred
legal status of marriage See Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 560-561, 852 P.2d 44,
59 (1993) for a list of noteworthy marital rights and benefits.</P>
<P>7. If Plaintiffs, and other same-sex couples, were allowed the
state-conferred legal status of marriage, they would be conferred with these and
other marital rights and benefits.</P>
<P>8. HRS 572-1, on its face and as applied, regulates access to the status of
marriage and its concomitant rights and benefits on the basis of the applicants'
sex. As such, HRS ?572-1 establishes a sex-based classification. Baehr v. Lewin,
74 Haw. 530, 572, 852 P.2d 44, 64 (1993).</P>
<P>9. Sex is a &quot;suspect category&quot; for purposes of equal protection
analysis under article I, section 5 of the Hawaii Constitution. Consequently,
HRS 572-1 is subject to the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; test. Baehr v. Lewin, 74
Haw. 530, 580, 852 P.2d 44, 67 (1993).</P>
<P>10. Defendant, rather than Plaintiffs, carries a heavy burden of
justification. Nachtwey v. Doi, 59 Haw. 430, 435, 583 P.2d 955, 959 (1978)
citing San Antonio School District v. Rodriquez, 411 U.S. 1, 16-17, 93 S.Ct.
1278, 1288, 36 L.Ed.2d 16, 33 (1973).</P>
<P>11. Specifically, HRS 572-1 is presumed to be unconstitutional and the
burden is on Defendant to show that the statute's sex-based classification is
justified by compelling state interests and the statute is narrowly drawn to
avoid unnecessary abridgments of constitutional rights. Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw.
530, 583, 852 P.2d 44, 67 (1993), reconsideration and clarification granted in
part, 74 Haw. 645, 646, 852 P.2d 74 (1993).</P>
<P>12. Article IV section 1 of the U.S. Constitution provides, in pertinent
part, that all states must recognize the &quot;public acts, records and judicial
proceedings of every other state.&quot;</P>
<P>Whether other states will recognize or avoid recognizing same-sex marriages
which take place in Hawaii and the consequences to Hawaii residents of other
states' recognition or non-recognition of same-sex marriage (and all of the
rights and benefits associated with marriage) is an important issue.</P>
<P>However, except for asking the court to take judicial notice of the Defense
of Marriage Act, P.L. 1-4-199 (&quot;DOMA&quot;), Defendant introduced little or
no other evidence with regard to this significant issue of comity and same-sex
marriage, conflictof-laws, and/or the effects, if any, of the Full Faith and
Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</P>
<P>13. Except for the affidavit testimony of Kenneth K. M. Ling and Michael L.
Meaney, which provided statistical, budgetary and operational information
regarding the Family Court of the First Circuit Court and the Child Support
Enforcement Agency, State of Hawaii, respectively Defendant presented little or
no other evidence which addressed how same-sex marriage would adversely affect
the public fisc. Defendant did not offer any testimony which explained the
significance of the above and Defendant did not specifically explain or
establish how same-sex marriage would adversely impact the Family Court or the

Child Support Enforcement Agency.</P>
<P>14. Defendant presented meager evidence with regard to the importance of the
institution of traditional marriage, the benefits which that relationship
provides to the community and, most importantly, the adverse effects, if any,
which same-sex marriage would have on the institution of traditional marriage
and how those adverse effects would impact on the community and society. The
evidentiary record in this case is inadequate to thoughtfully examine and decide
these significant issues.</P>
<P>15. Finally, Defendant's argument that legalized prostitution, incest and
polygamy will occur if same-sex marriage is allowed disregards existing statutes
and established precedent [for example, State v. Mueller, 66 Haw. 616, 671 P.2d
1351 (1983) (upholding ban on prostitution)] and the Supreme Court's
acknowledgment of compelling reasons to prevent and prohibit marriage under
circumstances such as incest. Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 562 n.19, 852 P.2d
44, 59 n.19 (1993).</P>
<P>16. In Dean v. District of Columbia, 653 A.2d 307 (D.C.App. 1995), two
homosexual males filed a complaint against the District of Columbia which sought
an injunction to require the Clerk of the Superior Court to issue them a
marriage license. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the
District of Columbia. On appeal, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
affirmed the trial court's order granting summary judgment.</P>
<P>In the Dean case, Judge Ferren wrote a lengthy opinion concurring in part
and dissenting in part, and in which the majority joined in part.</P>
<P>Judge Ferren would have reversed summary judgment and remanded the case for
trial to decide (1) the level of scrutiny constitutionally required, and (2)
whether the District of Columbia has demonstrated a compelling or substantial
enough governmental interest to justify refusing plaintiffs a marriage license.
The portion of Judge Ferren's opinion which deals with the question of whether
the District of Columbia could demonstrate at trial a substantial or compelling
state interest is useful and informative. In pertinent part, Judge Ferren wrote
the following.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[I]f the government cannot cite actual prejudice to the public majority from
a change in the law to allow same-sex marriages . . . then the public majority
will not have a sound basis for claiming a compelling, or even a substantial,
state interest in withholding the marriage statute from same-sex couples; a mere
feeling of distaste or even revulsion at what someone else is or does, simply
because it offends majority values without causing concrete harm, cannot justify
inherently discriminatory legislation against members of a constitutionally
protected class - as the history of constitutional rulings against racially
discriminatory legislation makes clear.</P>
<P>Suppose, on the other hand, that scientifically credible &quot;deterrence&quot;
evidence were forthcoming at trial, so that either the heterosexual majority or
the homosexual minority would be prejudiced in some concrete way, depending on
whether the marriage statute was, or was not, available to homosexual couples.
In that case, the ultimate question of whose values should be enforced, framed
in terms of what a substantial or compelling state interest really is, would
pose the hardest possible question for the court as majority and minority
interests resoundingly clash.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Dean at 653 A.2d at 355-356 (1995) (footnotes omitted).</P>
<P>17. In this case, the evidence presented by Defendant does not establish or
prove that same-sex marriage will result in prejudice or harm to an important
public or governmental interest.</P>
<P>18. Defendant has not demonstrated a basis for his claim of the existence of
compelling state interests sufficient to justify withholding the legal status of
marriage from Plaintiffs.</P>
<P>As discussed hereinabove, Defendant has failed to present sufficient
credible evidence which demonstrates that the public interest in the well-being
of children and families, or the optimal development of children would be
adversely affected by same-sex marriage. Nor has Defendant demonstrated how
same-sex marriage would adversely affect the public fisc, the state interest in
assuring recognition of Hawaii marriages in other states, the institution of
traditional marriage, or any other important public or governmental interest.</P>
<P>The evidentiary record presented in this case does not justify the sex-based
classification of HRS 572-1.</P>
<P>Therefore, the court specifically finds and concludes, as a matter of law,
that Defendant has failed to sustain his burden to overcome the presumption that
HRS 572-1 is unconstitutional by demonstrating or proving that the statute
furthers a compelling state interest.</P>
<P>19. Further, even assuming arguendo that Defendant was able to demonstrate
that the sex-based classification of HRS 572-1 is justified because it furthers
a compelling state interest, Defendant has failed to establish that HRS 572-1 is
narrowly tailored to avoid unnecessary abridgments of constitutional rights.

<H2>IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT</H2>
<H2>FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND</H2>
<H4>ROBERT L. WILKINS, et al., <BR>Plaintiffs,</H4>
<P>v.    </P>
<H4>MARYLAND STATE POLICE, et al.,<BR>Defendants.</H4>
<P>Civil Action No. CCB-93-468</P>
<HR>
<H4>MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR ENFORCEMENT OF SETTLEMENT
AGREEMENT AND FOR FURTHER RELIEF</H4>
<H4>I. Introduction</H4>
<P>After months of negotiations mediated by the Court, the parties to this case
reached a settlement which was approved by this Court on January 5, 1995.  <I>See</I>
Settlement Agreement, attached hereto as Exhibit 1.  The Agreement concerned
plaintiffs' 1993 claim that Maryland State Police routinely used race in drug
interdiction activities conducted on Maryland roadways, in violation of the
Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, 42 U.S.C. &#167;1983, Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, and Maryland common law.  <I>See</I> Complaint, attached
hereto as Exhibit 2.  Defendants denied using race in motorist stops, but agreed
that MSP would explicitly prohibit such discrimination in the future, would
conduct officer training, and would maintain computer records tracking motorist
detentions and searches to enable the agency, the Court and the plaintiffs to
monitor compliance.  Data covering the first 21 months of the  monitoring
period, from January 1995 through September 1996, now has been filed with the
Court and supplied to the plaintiffs.  </P>
<P>As set forth below, this data shows a disturbing pattern of continuing
racial discrepancies, in violation of the non-discrimination policy and the
Settlement Agreement.  Accordingly, plaintiffs ask the Court to find defendants
to be in contempt of court, and to impose a conditional civil contempt monetary
penalty in the amount of $250,000, payable to the Court.  Plaintiffs further
request that, pursuant to the contempt citation, the Court order:  1)  that
jurisdiction over the case for monitoring purposes be extended for one year,
from January 1998 through December 1998; 2) that MSP provide plaintiffs with
names, addresses, and telephone numbers for all motorists searched along the
I-95 corridor since January 1995; 3) that MSP's record-keeping obligations be
extended by one year, until December 1998, and be expanded to include motorist
stops in addition to motorist searches and detentions; and 4) that MSP produce
to the Court and the plaintiffs all investigative and disciplinary records
reflecting any actions taken by the agency to enforce the policy of
non-discrimination established under the <I>Wilkins</I> settlement.   </P>
<H4>II. Enforcement Standards</H4>
<P>The Settlement Agreement authorizes enforcement &quot;in the United States
District Court for the District of Maryland by any of the parties acting alone
or in concert, or by the American Civil Liberties Union, as representative of
the Plaintiffs.&quot;  Agreement at &#182;1.  Further, the Agreement specifies: 
&quot;If after July 1, 1995, Plaintiffs, on the basis of the computer records
provided by Defendant Maryland State Police or through other means, make a <I>reasonable
showing</I> that there is a pattern and practice of making stops on the basis of
race,&quot; the Court's jurisdiction shall be extended and plaintiffs shall be
entitled to additional injunctive relief.  <I>Id.</I> at &#182;10 (emphasis
added).  In addition, plaintiffs may show a violation, and therefore seek relief
under the Settlement Agreement &quot;by showing that there is a pattern and
practice of MSP stops conducted on the basis of  race, for which Maryland State
Police could be held liable under 42 U.S.C. &#167;1983.&quot;  Agreement at &#182;11.
 Relief available upon plaintiffs' showing of a violation includes  any and all
&quot;relief available for violating an injunction[.]&quot; <I>Id.</I>   The
plaintiffs clearly satisfy the enforcement standards set forth in the Agreement.
 The evidence presented in this Memorandum demonstrates, in an unequivocal
fashion, that notwithstanding the Agreement, MSP continues to engage in a
pattern and practice of making stops on the basis of race. </P>
<H4>III.  Plaintiffs' Monitoring Efforts</H4>
<P>Plaintiff Robert L. Wilkins and the American Civil Liberties Union have
collected, organized and analyzed data submitted by the Maryland State Police to
the Court and the ACLU for the period from January 1995 through September 1996. 
The data shows that more than one- third of all MSP drug interdiction activities
involving motorists occur along Interstate 95, north of Baltimore, in Harford,
Cecil, and Baltimore Counties.(1)  MSP's drug interdiction team, the &quot;Special
Traffic Interdiction Force (STIF)&quot;(2) works exclusively on this I-95 &quot;corridor.&quot;(3)
 Because the Interstate 95 corridor is a focus of MSP interdiction efforts and
because racial disparities in MSP data for this area are glaring, plaintiffs
have focused their monitoring there.</P>
<P>In focusing on this corridor, plaintiffs have monitored:</P>
<OL>
<LI>overall MSP activity along the Interstate 95 corridor;(4)</LI>
<LI>STIF activity in this area through March of 1996;(5) and</LI>
<LI>detentions and searches conducted by  individual troopers who were active
in    drug interdiction efforts along I-95.</LI></OL>
<P>The following troopers have conducted motorist searches in sufficient
numbers to prompt individual monitoring as part of plaintiffs' I-95 monitoring:</P>
<DL>
<DT></DT>
<DD>John E. Appleby</DD>
<DD>Bernard Donovan(6)</DD>
<DD>Melvin Fialkewicz</DD>
<DD>John R. Greene</DD>
<DD>Steven L. Hohner</DD>
<DD>David Hopp</DD>
<DD>David B. Hughes</DD>
<DD>Michael T. Hughes</DD>

<DD>James E. Nolan</DD>
<DD>Paul J. Quill</DD>
<DD>Christopher Tideberg</DD>
<DD>Ernest S. Tullis</DD>
<DD>John Wilhelm</DD></DL>
<P>To assess the significance of racial disparities in the MSP data, plaintiffs
have measured the data by two methods:  First, plaintiffs have contrasted
defendants' search data with the benchmark percentages of African-American and
other minority motorists traveling and violating traffic laws along the relevant
segment of Interstate 95.  Second, racial breakdowns for MSP searches conducted
on I-95 have been compared with those for searches conducted by MSP on other
Maryland roadways.  By both measures, the racial disparities are extraordinary
and surely make out a &quot;reasonable showing&quot; of a racially-based pattern
and practice.</P>
<H4>A. Determination of Population Benchmarks</H4>
<P>Early last spring, plaintiffs' counsel asked MSP to cooperate with a &quot;stationary
survey&quot; of the racial composition of motorists traveling Interstate 95 in
northeastern Maryland.  <I>See </I>March 11, 1996 letter from Deborah A. Jeon
to Betty S. Sconion, attached hereto as Exhibit 8.  MSP counsel would not
consent to this survey, and even threatened to arrest ACLU surveyors.  <I>See</I>
March 22, 1996 letter from Betty S. Sconion to Deborah A. Jeon, attached hereto
as Exhibit 9.  Working under the supervision of Dr. John Lamberth, plaintiffs
instead conducted a &quot;rolling&quot; traffic survey of motorists and traffic
law violators traveling the relevant portion of I-95.(7)  The methodology and
detailed results of the rolling survey are fully set forth in the report of
Sarah E. Cushman and Christopher Kosmides, attached hereto as Exhibit 11. Survey
results for I-95 motorists and traffic law violators are as follows:</P>

<P>Racial breakdowns in search data reported by MSP for the Interstate 95
corridor differ dramatically from those for motorist searches reported by state

<P><B>IV. MSP Records Reveal a Striking Pattern and Practice of Racial
Discrimination in Drug Interdiction Activities Conducted Along the Interstate 95
Corridor.</B></P>
<P>As set forth in Tables 1 through 16, attached hereto as Exhibit 12, MSP data
reveals a striking and consistent pattern of racially disparate searches
conducted by troopers patrolling Interstate 95.(9)   When the I-95 search data
is contrasted with data on racial identity of motorists violating traffic laws
on I-95, the racial disparities in MSP searches are undeniable.</P>

<P>The racial discrepancies between MSP search data and population benchmarks
are yawning.  Indeed, the percentages for blacks and whites in these two groups
are nearly inverted.  Statistical analysis only confirms the obvious problem. 
<I>See </I>Report of John Lamberth, Ph.D., attached as Exhibit 13.  The
comparative disparity between black motorists stopped and searched by MSP and
blacks subject to stop for violating traffic laws is 316.6%, and encompasses
34.6 standard deviations.  <I>See </I>Lamberth Report at p. 8.  Only about one
in every six I-95 motorists is African American, yet three out of every four
motorists searched by state police were black.</P>
<P>MSP officials have contended to the media that this pattern of
discrimination is mere &quot;coincidence.&quot;  <I>See </I>&quot;State police
I-95 drug unit found to search black motorists 4 times more often than white,&quot;
<I>The Sun</I>, May 23, 1996, attached hereto as Exhibit 14.  Such an
explanation begs reason.   As calculated by Dr. Lamberth, the odds that
three-quarters of MSP detainees would be black by happenstance are about one in
a <I>quintillion</I>.(10)  Lamberth Report at p.8. </P>
<P>MSP's own data demonstrates that this racial distortion is unnecessary to
successful drug interdiction.  Comparison of I-95 search data with that for
other Maryland roadways reveals that troopers patrolling I-95 search black
motorists at more than double the rate that troopers do elsewhere in the state. 
 Yet the rates at which troopers uncover contraband on motorists are nearly the
same on and off I-95.  Lamberth Report at p.8.  Even more significant, MSP data
shows that statewide, police find contraband on black and white motorists at
equal rates.  Blacks were found in possession of contraband in 28.4% of
searches, whereas whites were found with contraband 28.8% of the time.(11)  <I>Id.</I>
   </P>
<H4>V. Immediate Relief is Necessary.</H4>
<H4> A. Citation and Penalty for Civil Contempt</H4>
<P>Defendants have continued to rely upon race in drug interdiction efforts in
blatant disregard of the Settlement Agreement, despite their awareness that the
Court and the plaintiffs are monitoring their actions.  Maryland State Police
have had notice, trainings, and ample warning about the illegality of their
conduct.  Plaintiffs and ACLU counsel have attempted to work with defendants and
their counsel to facilitate enforcement of the Agreement and the non-
discrimination policy in this case, yet have been met with resistance at every
stage.  First, MSP officials withheld computer records from plaintiffs for
nearly a year in an attempt to hamper plaintiffs' enforcement efforts, finally
producing the records only after the Court imposed a penalty for their not
having done so earlier.  Next, defendants rebuffed plaintiffs' effort to
cooperate in conducting a traffic survey, suggesting that ACLU volunteers would
be arrested if they attempted to conduct the survey without the State's consent.
 At the same time, MSP officials unreasonably refused to stipulate  to use of
traffic survey results from southernmost New Jersey (less than 20 miles north of
the relevant segment of Interstate 95 in Maryland,) thus forcing plaintiffs to
undertake the enormous effort of duplicating this survey in Maryland.  And
according to sources within the agency, drug interdiction trainings conducted by
MSP officials pursuant to the Settlement have included gratuitous insults toward
the ACLU and plaintiffs' counsel, while stressing that MSP officials admit no
wrongdoing in connection with their law enforcement practices and that the
agency is going along with monitoring efforts <I>not</I> because there is any
problem but only because it is being forced to do so by the Court and the ACLU.
</P>
<P>The seriousness of MSP's violation cannot be gainsaid.  Racial
discrimination in law enforcement results in denial of liberty on the basis of
race.  It encourages and reinforces the stereotype that African Americans and
other minorities are more likely to be criminals than are whites.  It
fundamentally undermines and subverts the Constitutional principle that all
citizens are due equal protection of  the law.  </P>
<P>It is imperative, therefore, that the Court send a message condemning MSP's
unabated pattern of discrimination.  Plaintiffs ask that defendants be held in
contempt of court as a result of their continuing violation of the Settlement
Agreement.(12)  To give teeth to this citation, plaintiffs suggest that the
Court impose a conditional civil contempt monetary penalty in the amount of
$250,000, payable to the Court.  Defendants could purge the violation and obtain
return of the funds by showing by a date certain (<I>e.g.</I>, December 31,
1997) that the racial disparities in their drug interdiction activities have
been substantially eliminated.  <I>See International Union, UMWA v. Bagwell</I>,
114 S.Ct. 2552, 2558-59 (1994); <I>Hicks on Behalf of Feiock v. Feiock</I>, 485
U.S. 624, 633 (1985).   </P>

<H4>B. Extension of Jurisdiction and Record Keeping</H4>
<P>The Agreement prescribes that upon plaintiffs' &quot;reasonable showing&quot;
of a pattern and practice of race discrimination in MSP searches and detentions,
the Court's jurisdiction and       defendants' record-keeping obligations
automatically will be extended for one year.(13)  Plaintiffs submit that they
have met the &quot;reasonable showing&quot; standard, and thus that this Court's
jurisdiction and defendants' record-keeping obligations should be extended
through December 1998.</P>
<H4>C. Further Identifying Information on I-95 Motorists</H4>
<P>Also upon plaintiffs' showing of a pattern and practice of racially
disproportionate searches, MSP must supply (under seal) &quot;further
identifying information&quot; on individual motorists affected by the practice. 
Accordingly, plaintiffs now ask the Court to order defendants promptly to
provide the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all motorists detained
and/or searched along Interstate 95 from January 1995 to date.  This information
is sought for each entry listed in Exhibit 15 hereto, as well as for  I-95
searches conducted since September 1996.  Plaintiffs additionally request that
all future quarterly reports include &quot;further identifying information&quot;
for those motorists searched along the I-95 corridor.</P>
<H4>D. Expansion of Required Reporting to Cover I-95 Stops</H4>
<P>The foregoing amply demonstrates that there exists within the MSP a pattern
and practice of conducting stops and searches on the basis of race.  It also
strongly suggests that MSP engages in a discriminatory pattern and practice in
initiating stops, which stops may or may not result in a search.  The <I>Wilkins</I>
Agreement, and the non-discrimination policy implemented by MSP pursuant to the
Agreement, prohibit racial discrimination in motorist stops.  To date the MSP
has not provided the information that would allow an incontrovertible
determination of this issue: the racial identity of every motorist stopped by
the MSP.  Accordingly, plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court order MSP
to provide stop information, with the same frequency and with the same level of
detail, as the stop and search data.  Further, plaintiffs request that the Court
order MSP to produce historical stop data -- for the period from January 1995 to
date -- and take measures to protect such data from destruction.(14)</P>
<H4>E. Production of MSP Investigative and Disciplinary Files</H4>
<P>As an aspect of the <I>Wilkins</I> settlement, defendants agreed that &quot;MSP
will enforce the [non-discrimination] policy through appropriate investigation
and disciplinary action.&quot; Agreement at &#182;6. In order for the plaintiffs
to determine if defendants have complied with this provision of the Agreement,
plaintiffs must review MSP investigative and disciplinary files for those
troopers shown by MSP records to have engaged in interdiction activities in a
racially discriminatory manner during the monitoring period.(15)  Accordingly,
plaintiffs ask that the Court order MSP to produce to the plaintiffs any and all
files and documents reflecting any general investigative and/or disciplinary
actions taken by MSP to enforce the non-discrimination policy, any actions
involving the Special Traffic Interdiction Force (including all documents
pertaining to the 1996 alteration of the STIF,) and any actions specifically
involving the following troopers:  John E. Appleby, Bernard Donovan, Melvin
Fialkewicz, John R. Greene, Steven L. Hohner, David B. Hughes, Michael T.
Hughes, Steven O. Jones, James Nolan, Paul J. Quill, Christopher Tideberg,
Ernest S. Tullis, and John Wilhelm.</P>
<H4>VI. Conclusion</H4>
<P>For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs request that the Maryland State Police
agency be cited for civil contempt, and that additional relief be granted as
described above.</P>
<P>Respectfully submitted,</P>

<P>Counsel for the Plaintiffs</P>
<H4>Notes</H4>
<P>1.  For the period from January 1995 through September 1996, MSP troopers
reported a total of 2,372 motorist detentions and searches state-wide.  Of
these, 823 searches (34.7%) occurred north of Baltimore along Interstate 95, in
Harford, Cecil, and Baltimore Counties, according to MSP records. </P>
<P>2.  As publicized by the Maryland State Police, the Special Traffic
Interdiction Force is or was a specialized team of troopers trained and solely
focused upon drug interdiction activity along Interstate 95.  See &quot;In Drug
Fight, Police Now Take to the Highway,&quot; <I>New York Times,</I> March 5,
1995, attached hereto as Exhibit 3.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that
until late spring of 1996, the STIF was composed of six white troopers:  John E.
Appleby, Bernard Donovan, Steven L. Hohner, James E. Nolan, Paul J. Quill, and
John Wilhelm.  During June of 1996, however, the STIF reportedly was cut from
six to three members.  See &quot;Md. State Police Reduce I-95 Drug-Search Team,&quot;<I>Washington
Post</I>, June 29, 1996, attached hereto as Exhibit 4.  Approximately one month
prior to this change, a nationally-circulated <I>Associated Press</I>
investigative analysis using the data generated under the Wilkins Agreement
(covering the period from January 1995 through September 1995), reported that
STIF members searched African-American motorists four times as often as they did
whites.  See, e.g., &quot;Md. drug squad searches more blacks than whites,&quot;
<I>USA Today</I>, May 24, 1996, attached hereto as Exhibit 5.  It was widely
reported that the Wilkins data, the <I>Associated Press</I> expose, and
attendant publicity were factors in MSP's decision to alter the STIF.  See,
e.g., &quot;State police cuts I-95 drug search team in half,&quot; <I>Sunday
Star</I>, June 30, 1996, attached hereto as Exhibit 6.</P>
<P>Plaintiffs are not certain which of the six members were removed from the
STIF, except that Cpl. John Appleby was one of the three removed.  Reportedly,
Appleby has since been charged with felony theft in connection with his drug
interdiction activities, and has been suspended from his employment with the
Maryland State Police pending prosecution.  See &quot;Maryland Trooper Charged
With Taking Planted Cash,&quot; <I>Washington Post</I>, September 20, 1996,
attached hereto as Exhibit 7.  </P>
<P>3.  As used by plaintiffs in connection with their settlement enforcement
efforts, the terms &quot;Interstate 95 corridor&quot; and &quot;I-95 corridor&quot;
refer to the section of Interstate 95 running north of Baltimore City, through
Baltimore, Harford, and Cecil Counties, to the Delaware state line.</P>
<P>4.  In monitoring I-95 corridor activity, plaintiffs simply separated out
data recording searches and detentions conducted on Interstate 95, north of
Baltimore, from other MSP data. In compiling Interstate 95 corridor data,
plaintiffs counted every entry reported by state police in which the location
was identified as Interstate 95 (north of Baltimore City) and the County was
listed as Harford, Cecil, or Baltimore County.  All but a handful of these were
coded by MSP with the number &quot;62&quot;; The remaining few bore the code &quot;55&quot;.
 As set forth in the Certification of Sarah E. Cushman, attached to the Lamberth
 Report as Exhibit B, all of this sorting was performed by computer, using a
Microsoft Excel program.</P>
<P>5.  STIF activity was monitored only through March of 1996 due to the
reported changes made to the team in late spring and plaintiffs' uncertainty as
to the team's membership following this action.</P>
<P>6.  Although Trooper Donovan did not report substantial activity along I-95,
he was nevertheless included in plaintiffs' individual monitoring due to his
membership on the STIF.</P>
<P>7.  Because the rolling survey provided information about traffic law
violators (<I>i.e.,</I> persons fairly subject to being stopped by police)  as
well as general motorist numbers, it actually supplied more apt data for
plaintiffs' purposes than the stationary survey would.  The ACLU rolling survey
was patterned after a 1993 study conducted 19 miles north of the Maryland study
area, on the New Jersey Turnpike.  Like the Maryland survey, the New Jersey
survey was conducted under the direction of Dr. Lamberth, by the Gloucester
County Public Defender's Office.  The methodology and results of the New Jersey
study were approved by the Superior Court of New Jersey in <I>State of New
Jersey v. Pedro Soto, et al.</I>, March 4, 1996, attached hereto as Exhibit 10. 
Indeed, the <I>Soto </I>Court relied upon results of the traffic violator
survey to suppress evidence seized by New Jersey State Police in 19 criminal
cases in which searches were challenged as tainted by racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>As one might expect given the close proximity of the study areas for the New
Jersey and Maryland surveys, the results of the two surveys are nearly the same.
 In anticipation of this outcome, prior to undertaking a separate survey of the
Maryland highway (and to address MSP's stated concerns about the unsafety of a
stationary survey) plaintiffs' counsel asked MSP counsel to stipulate to use of
the New Jersey survey results to approximate racial breakdowns of Maryland I-95
motorists.  But MSP counsel refused to so stipulate.  </P>
<P>8.  For purposes of this analysis, &quot;non-Interstate 95 search data&quot;
includes all motorist searches reported by MSP from January 1995 through
September 1996, <I>except</I> those conducted along the Interstate 95 corridor,
north of Baltimore, in Harford, Cecil, or Baltimore Counties.</P>
<P>9.  Of all troopers individually monitored by plaintiffs, only Trooper David

Hopp reported searches in numbers not grossly disproportionate by race.  <I>See
</I>Exhibit 12, at Table 8.</P>
<P>10.  A quintillion is defined as a cardinal number represented (in the
United States) by a one followed by 18 zeros.  This substantially exceeds a
billion, which is a thousand million (a one with nine zeros),  a trillion, which
is a million million (a one with 12 zeros), and a quadrillion, which is a one
followed by 15 zeros.</P>
<P>11.  That is, 311 of 1,096 black motorists searched, statewide, by Maryland
State Police were  found to be in possession of a controlled dangerous substance
(CDS) while 331 of 1,148 white motorists searched, statewide, were found with
CDS.  Lamberth Report at p.8.</P>
<P>12.  The only express restriction upon relief available upon proof of
violation of the Agreement is the statement that &quot;[t]he relief under this
Agreement is limited to relief available for violating an injunction, and
specifically does not include money damages for individuals who are stopped.&quot;
<I>Id.</I> at  &#182;11.  A contempt citation such as that sought by plaintiffs
certainly is a remedy available upon proof that an injunction has been violated.</P>
<P>13.  The Agreement anticipated that the year's extension would run from July
1997 through June 1998.  However, due to defendants' prior violation of the
Settlement by their failure to produce required computer records, jurisdiction
previously was extended through December 1997.  <I>See </I>March 6, 1996 Order.
 Thus, the year's extension now sought will run from January 1998 through
December 1998.</P>
<P>14.  Even if MSP does not maintain a database of stop data comparable to
that maintained for search data under the <I>Wilkins</I> Agreement, plaintiffs
are informed and believe that defendants record certain stop data (with racial
identifiers) in the form of traffic ticket records.  Thus, production of the
ticket records will provide plaintiffs with stop information, at least for those
motorists who are issued traffic citations.  </P>
<P>15.  Although plaintiffs are only now seeking enforcement of the Settlement
Agreement, the information underlying plaintiffs' case has been in defendants'
hands throughout the monitoring period.  Indeed, for much of the period MSP had
far more meaningful access to the data for purposes of analyses, as the agency
maintained the data in computer record form, while withholding the computer
records from the plaintiffs.  Furthermore, in related litigation, ACLU counsel
previously submitted data compilations and raised concerns about patterns of
racial discrimination emerging in drug interdiction activities conducted along
Interstate 95.  <I>See </I>Exhibit 16, Affidavit of Deborah A. Jeon, filed
March 6, 1996 in <I>Carter, et al. v. Maryland State Police, et al.,</I> Case
No. 03-C-96-000156 (Balt.Co.Cir.Ct.).  Given these circumstances (to say nothing
of publicity generated by the Associated Press investigation), defendants can
scarcely claim  lack of notice about potential problems warranting
investigation.  </P>

<H2>REPORT OF JOHN LAMBERTH, PH.D.</H2>
<P>I, John Lamberth, am the immediate past Chairman of the Department of
Psychology and the past Director of the Division of Social Psychology at Temple
University, in Philadelphia.  I have been on the Temple faculty in the
Department of Psychology since 1973.</P>
<P>I have had extensive professional and academic experience with the design
and use of statistically valid surveys, random sampling techniques, and the
analysis of statistically-based measures of significance derived from survey,
census, and sample data.(1)  I have been qualified as an expert witness in
statistics , surveying, and social psychology in the United States District
Courts for New Jersey and Virginia, and in state courts in New Jersey,(2)
Pennsylvania, and Virginia.  I make this report in connection with the case<I>Wilkins
v. Maryland State Police</I>, Civil Action No. CCB-93-483.  Counsel for Mr.
Wilkins have retained me to design and conduct a study and analysis of  the 
incidence and significance of police searches along the I-95 corridor in Cecil,
Harford, and Baltimore Counties.  The overall goal of the study was to determine
if Maryland State Police stop and search black(3) motorists at a rate
disproportionate to their numbers on the highway.</P>
<P>Toward this end, I have assisted in the design and conduct of a study to
test the proposition that the Maryland State Police patrolling Interstate 95
search black motorists in significantly higher numbers, as measured
statistically, than one would expect given:</P>
<P>(a) the racial composition of the population of motorists on I-95; </P>
<P>(b) the racial composition of the population of motorists on I-95 who
violate traffic   laws; and</P>
<P>(c) the racial composition of motorists detained and searched by Maryland
State Police on roadways outside the I-95 corridor.</P>
<H4>I. DATA SOURCES UPON WHICH THIS STUDY IS BASED</H4>
<H4>A. Data Supplied By The Maryland State Police</H4>
<P>Pursuant to a Settlement Agreement approved by the Court in January 1995,
the Maryland State Police (MSP) has supplied the ACLU with data concerning
searches of motorists they have conducted from January 1995 through September
1996.  These data have been organized and summarized by the ACLU, then provided
to me in summary form.  See Exhibit B, attached hereto.  The data summaries list
the total number and location of searches, the name of the trooper who conducted
each search, and racial breakdowns for the searches reported by MSP.  </P>
<H4>B. Data Gathered By The ACLU</H4>
<P>I designed and assisted in implementation of a plan to gather statistically
appropriate data on the population of motorists on I-95 in Cecil, Harford, and
Baltimore Counties, north of Baltimore City.  The &quot;rolling survey&quot;,
carried out by the ACLU, was to determine the racial composition of motorists on
the highway and the racial composition of those motorists on the highway who
were violating traffic laws.(4)  </P>
<P>Observers rode in cars at a constant 55 or 65 miles per hour (depending upon
the posted speed limit) northbound from the White Marsh exit of I-95 (exit 67)
to the last exit in Maryland (Elkton - exit 109) before the toll.  They then
stopped to rest or gas up for approximately 10 minutes and then proceeded
southbound to the White Marsh exit.(5)  They were instructed to count the cars
that passed them and classify them as traffic violators (i.e., speeders) and to
count the cars they passed (i.e., non-speeders) and classify them as
non-violators, unless they were violating some other traffic law.  They were
also to classify each car as to the race of its driver.</P>
<P>There were a total of 21 traffic observation sessions conducted on days and
at times randomly selected by me, in accordance with professionally established
and accepted procedures and methods.  Sessions were conducted only during the
12-hour period from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., as during these times the days were
light enough to allow accurate counting.(6)  </P>
<P>From the beginning of this study I have assumed that the racial composition
of the population of travellers on I-95 would be materially the same as the
population of traffic violators.  I have made that assumption based upon the
proposition that blacks and persons of other races (1) are supposed to enjoy
equality before the law;  (2) are not materially different in motor, neural, and
perceptual skills as they bear on the capacity to drive; and (3) the testimony
of New Jersey State Police officers who in the case of <I>State of New Jersey
v. Pedro Soto, et al.</I>, all testified that blacks drive indistinguishably
from whites.  As demonstrated in the traffic survey, this assumption has proven
to be valid.</P>
<P>I have carefully reviewed both the design of the traffic survey and the
reports from that survey.  I consulted in the course of the survey with the
supervisors in charge.  On these bases, I am confident that the results of the
survey accurately describe the racial population of the highway surveyed.  </P>
<H4>II.  SUMMARY OF THE CONTENTS OF EACH DATA SOURCE</H4>
<H4>A. Traffic Survey Results</H4>
<P>Five thousand seven hundred and forty one cars were surveyed in the 21
sessions comprising approximately 42 hours.  In the vast majority of cases,
96.8%, it was possible to identify the race of the driver of the vehicle.  Nine
hundred and seventy three, or 16.9% of the cars, had black drivers.  Four
thousand three hundred and forty one, or 75.6% of the cars, had white drivers. 
The great majority of drivers -- 5,354 of 5,741, or 93.3% -- were violating
traffic laws and thus were eligible to be stopped by State Police.  Of the
violators, 17.5% were black, and 74.7% were white.  Overall results of the
traffic survey and the count of violators are shown in Table 1.</P>

<P>These results are consistent with the work I did in the case of <I>State of
New Jersey v. Pedro Soto, et al.</I>, in which we conducted both a rolling
survey and a stationary survey to determine motorist and violator populations on
the southernmost segment of the New Jersey Turnpike (which ends 19 miles from
the northern terminus of I-95 in Maryland.)  There, 98% of the drivers were
violating traffic laws and 15% of the violators were black.  While I would not
expect I-95 in northern Maryland and the southern portion of the New Jersey
Turnpike to have identical numbers of minority motorists and violators, the
similar percentages discerned in the surveys support and confirm their
reliability.</P>
<H4>B. The Record Of Searches By The Maryland State Police</H4>
<H4>1. Interstate 95 Corridor Data</H4>
<P>Between January 1995 and September 1996, the Maryland State Police reported
searching 823 motorists on I-95, north of Baltimore.  See Exhibit B.  Of these,
600, or 72.9%, were black.  Id.   Six hundred and sixty-one, or 80.3%, were
black, hispanic, or other racial minorities. Id.  Only 19.7% of those searched
in this corridor were white. Id.  Most of the I-95 searches -- 646, or 85.4% --
were conducted by 13 troopers.(7)   Search breakdowns for those troopers are
listed in Table 2.</P>

<P><B> </B>With the exception of David Hopp,  all of these troopers are
searching blacks and other minority motorists at much higher rates than these
motorists travel on the highway.  The trooper (other than Hopp) with the lowest
percentage of black searches still searched blacks at nearly twice the rate they
were found to travel the highway.  The trooper with the highest percentage of
black searches searched only blacks.  Ten of the 13 troopers searched minority
motorists at least 80 percent of the time.</P>
<H4>2. MSP Data From Outside the I-95 Corridor</H4>
<P>Data reported by MSP for motorist searches conducted outside the I-95
corridor is markedly different from that reported by troopers patrolling I-95. 
As shown in Table 3, 63.7 percent of motorists searched by MSP troopers working
outside the I-95 corridor are white, as compared with only 19.7% of motorists
searched by troopers along I-95.  Black motorists travelling I-95 are searched
by state police more than twice as often as are black motorists travelling other

<H4>3. Statewide Data on Drug &quot;Finds&quot; Through Motorist Searches</H4>
<P>The total number of motorist searches reported statewide by MSP during the
time period is 2,372.  In only 666, or 28.1%, of these searches was contraband
found.  Overall &quot;find&quot; rates were about the same for searches
conducted on I-95 and those conducted elsewhere in the state.  That is, of 823
searches conducted along the I-95 corridor, a controlled dangerous substance was
recovered in 246, or 29.9% of the time, while on roadways outside the I-95
corridor, CDS was recovered in 420 of 1,549 searches, or 27.1% of the time. 
Even more importantly, &quot;find&quot; rates were the same statewide for
searches of black and white motorists: According to MSP data, contraband was
recovered in 311 of 1,096 searches (28.4%) of black motorists, and in 331 of
1,148 searches (28.8%) of white motorists.</P>
<H4>III. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</H4>
<P>The data concerning the searches carried out by Maryland State Police along
the I-95 corridor is extremely revealing.  The State Police conducted a total of
823 searches in this area, finding some reason to arrest the driver of the car
in only 246 (29.9%) of the searches.  In 70 percent of the cases the search was
fruitless.  Of the 823 searches, in 600 (72.9%) of them, the person searched was
black, and in 661 of them (80.3%), the person searched was a racial minority.</P>
<P>For purposes of this analysis, the proper statistical comparison contrasts
the 72.9% of blacks searched to the 17.5% of traffic law violators who were
black.(8)  This assumes that blacks, once stopped by police, behave in a similar
manner to any other motorist stopped by the police.</P>
<P>The accepted convention for statisticians to conclude that a difference is
real and not chance is the finding that if the same study was done many times,
the present results would occur only five times out of a hundred.  This .05
level is determined by computing the number of standard deviations that the
observed result differs from the expected.  The .05 level of statistical
significance  is reached at about two standard deviations.  The probability
drops to one in 100 when 2.58 standard deviations is reached.</P>
<P>Here, the difference between 17.5% of blacks who are eligible to be stopped
and the 72.9% of blacks searched by state police encompasses 34.6 standard
deviations.  The absolute disparity is 55.4% and the comparative disparity is
316.6%.  An important alternative comparison contrasts the 72.9% rate of black
searches on I-95 to the 32% of black searches on other Maryland roadways.  The
absolute disparity in these figures is 40.9%, and the comparative disparity is
128%.  This difference encompasses 20.45 stardard deviations.  </P>
<P>Such statistical significance is literally off the charts.  It means, in
layman's terms,  the probability that black Interstate 95 drivers are subjected
to searches at so high a rate by <I>chance</I> is less than one in one
quintillion.  It is wildly significant by statistical measures.</P>
<H4>IV. CONCLUSION</H4>
<P>The evidence examined in this study reveals dramatic and highly
statistically significant disparities between the percentage of black Interstate
95 motorists legitimately subject to stop by Maryland State Police and the
percentage of black motorists detained and searched by MSP troopers on this
roadway.  While no one can know the motivations of each individual trooper in
conducting a traffic stop, the statistics presented herein, representing a broad
and detailed sample of highly appropriate data, show without question a racially
discriminatory impact on blacks and other minority motorists from state police
behavior along I-95.  The disparities are sufficiently great that, taken as a
whole, they are consistent with and strongly support the assertion that the
Maryland State Police are targeting the community of black motorists for stop,
detention, and investigation within the Interstate 95 corridor.</P>
<P>John Lamberth, Ph.D. </P>
<HR>
<P>1.  For a full recitation of my credentials, employment and experience,
please refer to my curriculum vitae attached hereto as Exhibit A.</P>
<P>2.  Of particular significance to the <I>Wilkins</I> case, I served as an
expert for the Gloucester County Public Defender's Office in <I>State of New
Jersey v. Pedro Soto, et al.</I>, a case referred to below.  There, the Superior
Court of New Jersey relied upon expert survey and analytical work I performed to
suppress evidence seized by New Jersey State Police in 19 consolidated criminal
prosecutions.  The Court there concurred in my opinion that state police
unlawfully relied upon race in stopping and searching motorists on the New
Jersey Turnpike, thus tainting the evidence.</P>
<P>3.  The generic term &quot;black&quot; is used in this report to identify
people who may be African- American.</P>
<P>4.  I initially requested that a stationary traffic survey also be carried
out, primarily to confirm general population numbers ascertained through the
rolling traffic survey which was conducted. However, plaintiff's counsel
informed me that their request to carry out such a survey was denied by the
Maryland State Police.</P>
<P>5.  On eight occasions, either the weather and traffic conditions were
sufficiently favorable or the surveyors did not stop at the northern terminus of
the survey, and there was still some time in the two hour period designated for

the survey.  On these occasions, a &quot;half pass&quot; was executed.  That is,
the surveyors drove northward for half of the time remaining in the two-hour

survey period and then drove southward for the other half of the time remaining.
 While this technically oversamples the southern part of the roadway, as a
practical matter it had almost no effect.  On the eight sessions when the half
pass was executed, 16.7% of the highway population was counted as black, and
during the sessions when no half pass was executed, 17% of the population on the
highway was counted as black.</P>
<P>6.  A complete description of the survey is found in &quot;American Civil
Liberties Union of Maryland I-95 Corridor Traffic and Violator Survey&quot; by
Sarah E. Cushman and Christopher E. Kosmides, appended to plaintiffs' Memorandum
as Exhibit 11.</P>
<P>7.  Here, I include only troopers who have reported conducting 10 or more
searches in the 21-month period.</P>
<P>8.  An ideal comparison would be the percentage of black traffic law
violators to the percentage of blacks <I>stopped</I> by the Maryland State
Police.  Stop data has not been made available by MSP however.  In the absence
of that, the percentage of blacks searched provides a rough approximation of the

percentage of blacks stopped, given the fact that in 70% of the cases the search
turned up no contraband.  As set forth below, the difference between the
percentage of blacks travelling I-95 and the percentage of blacks searched is
highly statistically significant.</P>

<H4>APPENDIX</H4>
<HR>

<P>Pursuant to Rule 18.6 of the Rules of the Supreme Court, appellees American
Civil Liberties Union, et al., respectfully move for summary affirmance of the
preliminary injunction order entered by the three-judge district court on June
12, 1996.</P>
<H4><A NAME="introduction"></A>INTRODUCTION</H4>
<P>The government appeals from a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement
of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA), which is Congress' first
attempt to regulate the content of communications in the democratizing, global
medium of cyberspace.<A HREF="#1">1</A>  International computer networks like
the Internet represent a revolution in human communication that has been
compared by some to the development of the printing press.  The Internet allows
millions of average citizens around the globe to communicate, publish, and
exchange information on a vast array of subjects with a worldwide and virtually
limitless audience.  The Internet thus embodies the values that underlie the
First Amendment by nurturing the robust exchange of ideas and equalizing the
distribution of information.</P>
<P>The CDA would stifle this promising new medium.  The CDA makes it a crime,
punishable by up to two years in prison, for anyone to use online computer
communications to transmit or &quot;display in a manner available to minors&quot;
any material that is &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently offensive.&quot; 
The three-judge district court correctly enjoined these provisions based on
detailed factual findings that are not disputed on appeal and that will be
described in more detail below.<A HREF="#2">2</A>  ACLU v. Reno, 929 F.Supp.
824 (E.D.Pa. 1996), reproduced as Appendix A of the government's Jurisdictional
Statement.  Four findings of the lower court, however, are worth particular
emphasis.</P>
<P>First, the three-judge court found that the Internet is &quot;the most
participatory marketplace of mass speech that . . . the world has yet seen.&quot;
 J.S.App. 141a.  The empowering and noninvasive nature of the Internet make it a
very different medium than radio or television.  Second, use of the Internet is
growing exponentially and, in part because of that increased use, the technology
that governs the Internet is continuously and rapidly evolving.  Third, given
the current state of technology, there is no way for the vast majority of
Internet users to distinguish between adults and minors in their audience and,
even in those parts of the Internet where it might be technologically possible,
it is economically infeasible for many speakers, including the plaintiffs in
this case.  For these speakers, the only way to ensure that minors do not have
access to speech that might later be deemed &quot;indecent&quot; by a criminal
jury is to eliminate such speech from the Internet entirely.  Fourth, less
restrictive alternatives already exist that empower parents to make private

decisions within the family about what materials their children should see.  The

CDA, conversely, is uniquely ill-suited to shield children from sexually
explicit material on the Internet precisely because it is a global
communications medium.  The record reveals that at least 40% of the speech now
on the Internet originates overseas and the general consensus is that this
percentage is growing.  That speech can be accessed as easily as speech that
originates domestically but, as the lower court found, and the government
concedes, that speech is beyond the reach of our domestic criminal law.</P>
<P>Based on these findings, the three-judge court reached the unanimous
conclusion that the inevitable effect of the CDA would be to deprive adult
Internet users of their right to send and receive constitutionally protected
speech that deals with sexual issues.  Because that result so clearly violates
the First Amendment under this Court's well-established jurisprudence, the
decision below can and should be summarily affirmed.</P>
<H4><A NAME="statement"></A>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</H4>
<P>This case involves the government's attempt to regulate a new technology
that will serve as the basis for global communication in the twenty-first
century. Unfortunately, Congress held no hearings about the nature of the
Internet before it enacted the CDA.  The sad but predictable result is that
Congress drafted a statute that is both ineffective and unconstitutional, as the
lower court found after engaging in the detailed factual inquiry that Congress
chose not to do.</P>
<P><B>A.  The Statutory Framework</B></P>
<P>The criminal provisions challenged in this action are embodied in two
sections of the CDA.  Section 223(a)(1)(B) applies to &quot;telecommunications
devices,&quot; a term that is nowhere defined in the Act but that the parties
have agreed includes a modem.</P>
<P>J.S.App. 6a-7a n.5.  Under &#167;223(a)(1)(B), anyone who transmits an &quot;indecent&quot;
communication, &quot;knowing that the recipient of the communication is under 18
years of age,&quot; now faces felony charges.  The term &quot;indecent&quot; is
also undefined in the statute.<A HREF="#3">3</A></P>
<P>Section 223(d)(1) applies to &quot;interactive computer services,&quot; a
phrase that is defined in the CDA.  See 47 U.S.C. &#167;230(e)(2).  In contrast

to the indecency provision, this section of the statute makes it a crime to &quot;send&quot;
or &quot;display in a manner available&quot; to any person under eighteen any
communication that, &quot;in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently
offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory
activities or organs.&quot;<A HREF="#4">4</A></P>
<P>Throughout the district court proceedings, the government made very little
effort to defend the constitutionality of these criminal provisions, standing
alone.  Instead, the government's constitutional defense primarily relied on the
so-called &quot;safe harbor&quot; provisions set forth in &#167;223(e)(5) of the
Act.  Section 223(e)(5)(A) creates an affirmative defense for anyone who &quot;has
taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions under the
circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors to [prohibited]
communications . . . .&quot;  Section 223(e)(5)(B) creates an affirmative
defense for anyone who &quot;has restricted access to such communication by
requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account, adult access code, or
adult personal identification number.&quot; At trial, much of the evidence
concerned the meaning, scope, and practical impact of these so-called defenses.</P>
<P><B>B.  The Plaintiffs</B></P>
<P>The ACLU plaintiffs represent a wide variety of online users, content
providers, and service providers.  The subject matter of plaintiffs' speech
ranges from human rights, censorship, and pornography, to the discussion of
lesbian and gay issues, safer sex, and rape in prison.<A HREF="#5">5</A>  The
ALA plaintiffs also include a wide variety of speakers, including the American
Library Association, trade groups such as the American Publishers Association,
and service providers such as America Online, Microsoft, Compuserve and Prodigy.
 None of the plaintiffs are pornographers, as that term is commonly understood,
but all of them provide</P>
<P>online speech that is sexually oriented or contains vulgar words.  J.S.App.
61a, &#182;123.  Many of the ACLU plaintiffs are individuals or nonprofit
organizations with limited budgets; some rely heavily on volunteer labor.<A
HREF="#6">6</A>  Many also believe that the information and ideas they convey
online about sexual issues are valuable, not harmful, for older minors.<A
HREF="#7">7</A></P>
<P>For example, plaintiff Critical Path AIDS Project, Inc. (Critical Path)
maintains a web site that offers a wide variety of information about AIDS and
safer sex.  Kiyoshi Kuromiya, Director of Critical Path, testified:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Because most cases of AIDS are transmitted through sexual contact, the
information must deal with descriptions of risky sexual activity.</P>
<P>In order to ensure that readers understand the materials, it often must be
written using street or colloquial language rather than clinical language in
order to be understood by most lay persons . . . . In my view, the information
that Critical Path provides saves lives of both teenagers and adults and any
attempt to censor or restrict the free flow of this life-saving information
would be a critical public health mistake.<A HREF="#8">8</A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Plaintiff Wildcat Press, a publisher of gay and lesbian literature,
publishes two electronic magazines on the World Wide Web that are written by and
for gay and lesbian youth.  Patricia Nell Warren testified that the YouthArts
e-zines &quot;provide a creative forum for many youth to discuss their coming
out, their experiences with gay life and their sense of their own identity . . .
. Many of the contributors openly discuss sex and sexuality, often using slang
common to their age group.&quot;  Decl. of Patricia Nell Warren, at 9, &#182;&#182;21,
23.</P>
<P>Plaintiff Stop Prisoner Rape (SPR), a nonprofit organization dedicated to
combating the rape of prisoners and providing assistance to survivors, has a web
site that contains a variety of textual and graphical documents concerning
prisoner rape, including a number of testimonials and excerpts of letters from
survivors of prisoner rape.  Decl. of Stephen Donaldson.  Plaintiff American
Civil Liberties Union has a feature on its web site that allows users to access
this Court's decision in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978),
including the transcript of George Carlin's &quot;seven dirty words&quot;
monologue that was deemed &quot;indecent&quot; for radio broadcast during
daytime hours by the FCC.<A HREF="#9">9</A>  Other plaintiffs include Human
Rights Watch, an international human rights monitoring organization that uses
the Internet to distribute reports and to communicate about human rights issues
such as &quot;torture, rape, mutilation, execution, and mass murder;&quot;<A
HREF="#10">10</A> Justice on Campus, which provides an online information
clearinghouse on free speech issues on college campuses; and John Troyer, who
maintains The Safer Sex Page, a web site with information on safer sex that
includes explicit language and pictures, and an online discussion forum in which
users can comment on subjects such as condom brands, masturbation, and how to
talk about safer sex with a partner.</P>
<P>The government has consistently refused to say that plaintiffs' speech is
not covered by the CDA.  As the lower court noted, &quot;The Government has not
by motion challenged the standing of any plaintiff in either case, and we harbor
no doubts of our own on that point.&quot;  J.S.App. 12a n.9; see also id. at
107a (Dalzell, J.).</P>
<P><B>C.  Factual Findings By The Three-Judge District Court</B></P>
<P>The preliminary injunction proceedings included five days of testimony,
documentary evidence, and detailed stipulations.  The decision issued by the
three-judge court contained over four hundred separate findings of fact that
included information about the nature of communication and content in the
cyberspace medium, the ability of users to restrict access to unwanted material,
and the impracticality of the statutory defenses.  Notably, 334 of the 409
separate fact-findings adopted by the trial court were derived from stipulations
the parties filed with the court.  J.S.App. 12a-30a, &#182;&#182;1-43; App. &#182;&#182;70-356.
 Thus, the majority of the facts necessary to the court's holding were not
disputed by the government, and are not disputed on appeal.  J.S.App. 11a-12a.</P>
<P><B>1.  The Nature Of The Medium</B></P>
<P>The findings of fact established that the online medium is a &quot;unique
and wholly new medium of worldwide human communication.&quot;  Id. at 46a, &#182;81.
 The Internet is a giant, global communications network that connects
innumerable smaller computer networks.  Id. at 12a, &#182;1.  While difficult to
estimate due to rapid growth, the Internet is believed to connect over 9,400,000
host computers worldwide and as many as 40 million people.  Id. at 13a, &#182;3.
 Indeed, only about 60% of the Internet's host computers are currently located

in the United States.  Id.  Thus, the medium allows &quot;literally tens of
millions of people . . . to exchange information.  These communications can
occur almost instantaneously, and can be directed either to specific
individuals, to a broader group of people interested in a particular subject, or
to the world as a whole.&quot;  Id. at 13a-14a, &#182;4.</P>
<P>The court also found that the evidence &quot;showed significant differences
between Internet communications and communications received by radio or
television.&quot;  Id. at 49a, &#182;89.  Communications on the Internet do not &quot;`invade'
an individual's home or appear on one's computer screen unbidden.&quot;  Id. at &#182;88.
 Rather, the receipt of information on the Internet &quot;requires a series of
affirmative steps more deliberate and directed than merely turning a dial.&quot;
 Id. at &#182;89.  The Internet is also distinct because it is &quot;not
exclusively, or even primarily, a means of commercial communication.&quot;  Id.
at 43a, &#182;75.  In addition, &quot;[t]he start-up and operating costs
entailed by communication on the Internet are significantly lower than those
associated with use of other forms of mass communication.&quot;  Id. at 44a, &#182;76.</P>
<P>There are a variety of ways in which users can communicate in cyberspace. 
See generally id. at 21a-25a, &#182;&#182;22-32.  Electronic mail, or e-mail,
allows an online user to address and transmit a message to one or more people, &quot;comparable
in principle to sending a first class letter.&quot;  Id. at 21a, &#182;23.  In
addition, there are a wide variety of online discussion forums that allow groups
of users to discuss and debate subjects of interest.  The three most common
methods for online discussion are mail exploders or &quot;listservs,&quot;
USENET newsgroups, and chat rooms.  &quot;Mail exploders,&quot; or &quot;listservs,&quot;
allow online users to subscribe to mailing lists that discuss particular
subjects of interest.  Subscribers send an e-mail message to the &quot;list,&quot;
and the &quot;mail exploder&quot; automatically and simultaneously sends the
message to all of the other subscribers on the list; subscribers can reply to
the message by sending a response to the list.  Id. at 22a, &#182;24.</P>
<P>The second type of forum for online discussion occurs on &quot;USENET
newsgroups . . . [which] are among the most popular and widespread applications
of Internet services, and cover all imaginable topics of interest to users.&quot;
 Id. at 23a, &#182;25.  Unlike mail exploders, online users need not &quot;subscribe&quot;
to newsgroups in advance in order to participate.  Rather, the newsgroups are
huge databases of messages arranged according to subject matter, and online
users may access or send a message to any newsgroup at any time.  Id. at
22a-23a, &#182;25.  There are newsgroups on more than 15,000 different subjects;
&quot;[c]ollectively, almost 100,000 new messages (or `articles') are posted to
newsgroups each day.&quot;  Id. at 24a, &#182;26.</P>
<P>Third, chat rooms, or &quot;Internet Relay Chats,&quot; allow &quot;individuals
on the Internet [to] . . . engage in an immediate dialog, in `real time,' with
other people on the Internet . . . . IRC is analogous to a telephone party line,
using a computer and keyboard rather than a telephone.&quot;  Id. at &#182;27. 
There are thousands of different chat rooms available, &quot;in which
collectively tens of thousands of users are engaging in conversations on a huge
range of subjects.&quot;  Id.</P>
<P>Finally, one of the most well-known methods for communicating information

online is the &quot;World Wide Web,&quot; which allows users to publish
documents, or &quot;web pages,&quot; that can then be accessed by any other user
in the world.  See generally id. at 25a-32a, &#182;&#182;33-48.  Most web
documents contain &quot;links,&quot; which are &quot;short sections of text or
image which refer to another document.&quot;  Id. at 27a, &#182;36.  When
selected by the user, the &quot;linked&quot; document is automatically
displayed, wherever in the world it is actually stored.  Id.  &quot;These links
from one computer to another, from one document to another across the Internet,
are what unify the web into a single body of knowledge, and what makes the Web
unique.&quot;  Id. at 28a, &#182;39.  Ease of access, the court found, has been
the key to the tremendous success of the Web.</P>
<P>In considering the diversity of communication and material available through
the online medium, the district court noted that &quot;[i]t is no exaggeration
to conclude that the content on the Internet is as diverse as human thought.&quot;
 Id. at 42a, &#182;73.</P>
<P>The diversity of content is possible &quot;because the Internet provides an
easy and inexpensive way for a speaker to reach a large audience, potentially of
millions.&quot;  Id. at 44a, &#182;76.  The Internet is thus a &quot;never-ending
worldwide conversation,&quot; id. at 146a (Dalzell, J.), in which users &quot;may
speak or listen interchangeably.&quot;  Id. at 46a, &#182;79.</P>
<P><B>2.  The Scope Of The CDA's Criminal Prohibitions</B></P>
<P>In addition to the information described in plaintiffs' declarations, the
court found that a wide variety of other communications with sexual content, or

containing vulgar words, would be potentially subject to the CDA.  Indeed, the
government did not dispute this point:  although it attempted to paint the CDA's
main target as &quot;pornography,&quot; it acknowledged that artistic and
political material with serious value could be prosecuted.  The government's own
witnesses testified that the magazine Vanity Fair, with a nude cover photo of
the actress Demi Moore, would be potentially indecent in some communities,
Schmidt testimony, Tr. Vol. IV, at 138-39, as would a political discussion that
included the sentiment &quot;Fuck the CDA,&quot; Olsen testimony, Tr. Vol. V, at
53-53.  See also J.S.App. 99a (Buckwalter, J.); id. at 119a (Dalzell, J.).  The
court also found that library card catalogues, artworks such Francesco
Clemente's &quot;Labyrinth,&quot; material from contemporary films such as
Leaving Las Vegas, and reproductions of ancient Indian sculptures, are all
within the CDA's broad proscriptions.  See J.S.App. 42a-47a, &#182;&#182;74-75,
78, 85; 71a, 76a-77a.</P>
<P>Conversely, while there was no dispute during the preliminary injunction
proceedings that some sexually explicit material is available on the Internet,
id. at 74a, &#182;&#182;82-84, it is not &quot;the primary type of content on
this new medium.&quot;  Id. at &#182;83. While so-called search engines, used to
help computer users find information on the web, &quot;can accidentally retrieve
material of a sexual nature through an imprecise search,&quot; the court found
many factors that decreased the likelihood of such an &quot;accident:&quot;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A document's title or a description of the document will usually appear
before the document itself . . . and in many cases the user will receive
detailed information about a site's content before he or she need take the step
to access the document.  Almost all sexually explicit images are preceded by
warnings as to the content.  Even the Government's witness, Agent Howard
Schmidt, Director of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, testified
that the &quot;<I>odds are slim</I>&quot; that a user would come across a
sexually explicit site by accident.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at &#182;88 (emphasis added).</P>
<P><B>3.  The Impracticality Of The Statutory Defenses</B></P>
<P>After hearing extensive testimony on precisely this issue, the three-judge
court found that it is currently impossible for most online speakers to
determine who may ultimately read their messages, or to identify and screen out
minors from the wide variety of forums over which they may communicate in
cyberspace.  See generally id. 49a-58a, &#182;&#182;90-116.  Thus, the court
found that &quot;[o]nce a provider posts content on the Internet, it is
available to all other Internet users worldwide.&quot;  Id. at 47a, &#182;85.</P>
<P>Moreover, for the vast areas of cyberspace comprehended by e-mail, mail
exploders, newsgroups, and chat rooms, &quot;[t]here is no effective way to
determine the identity or the age of a user who is accessing material.&quot; 
Id. at 49a, &#182;90.  The court found that verification of a credit card number
over the Internet &quot;is not now technically possible.&quot;  Id. at 53a, &#182;97.
 Off-line credit card verification, in addition to &quot;significantly
delay[ing] the retrieval of information on the Internet,&quot; id. at 54a, &#182;101,
would impose a significant economic cost on noncommercial entities.  For
example, Critical Path testified that its web site has been accessed 3,300 times
daily.  The court concluded that &quot;[i]f Critical Path must pay a fee every
time a user initially enters its site, then, to provide free access to its
non-commercial site, it would incur a monthly cost far beyond its modest
resources.&quot;  Id. at &#182;100.</P>
<P>The court acknowledged that the government did offer &quot;very limited
evidence&quot; regarding age verification systems on the World Wide Web that are
used for accessing &quot;commercial pornography sites&quot;; however, that
evidence &quot;was not based on personal knowledge.&quot;  Id. at 55a, &#182;103.
 Moreover, the court found that the burdens imposed by such systems &quot;make
them effectively unavailable to a substantial number of Internet content
providers.&quot;  Id. at 56a, &#182;107.  In addition, free and anonymous access
to speech on the Internet is often critical, so that requiring payment and proof
of identity and age will deter substantial numbers of their audience, both adult
and minor, from accessing important and even life-saving communications.  Id. at
61a, &#182;121.  In sum, the court found that the &quot;defenses&quot; provided
by the CDA under 47 U.S.C. &#167;223(e)(5)(B) -- use of verified credit cards,
adult access codes, and the like, to screen out minors -- &quot;are effectively
unavailable for non-commercial, not-for-profit entities.&quot;  Id. at &#182;122.</P>
<P>The court also found that there is no currently available technology to
implement a possible &quot;good faith&quot; defense under &#167;223(e)(5)(A) of
the CDA through self-labeling or &quot;tagging&quot; of possibly &quot;indecent&quot;
or &quot;offensive&quot; messages.  It thus rejected the government's
suggestions that a &quot;consensus among speakers&quot; might soon emerge &quot;to
use the same tag to label `indecent' material,&quot; and that the industry might
develop computer software &quot;that recognizes the tags and takes appropriate
action when it notes tagged speech.&quot;  Id. at 57a-58a, &#182;&#182;113-14. 
The court found these speculations concerning future technological developments
insufficient to sustain a law that criminalizes speech today.  Id. at 58a, &#182;114.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the court found, the task of determining which material to tag
indecent &quot;would be extremely burdensome for organizations that provide
large amounts of material.&quot;  Id. at 57a, &#182;110.  For example, &quot;[t]he
Carnegie Library would be required to hire numerous additional employees to
review its online files at an extremely high cost to its limited budget.&quot; 
Id.  Similarly, &quot;it would be impossible for . . . Critical Path to review
all of its material because it has only one full and one part-time employee.&quot;
 Id.  The inevitable result, as the court found, is that given the current state
of technology, &quot;[m]any speakers who display arguably indecent content on
the Internet&quot; -- including political and artistic discussion, and &quot;information
regarding protection from AIDS, birth control, or prison rape&quot; -- would
have to &quot;choose between silence and the risk of prosecution&quot; if the
CDA were not preliminarily enjoined.  Id. at 61a, &#182;&#182;122-123.</P>
<P><B>4.  The Availability Of Less Restrictive Alternatives That Empower
Parents To Make Decisions For Their Own Families</B></P>
<P>Finally, there is undisputed evidence in the trial record about the variety
of voluntary measures available to restrict minors' access to online
communications that their parents may consider unsuitable for them.  Id. at
32a-42a, &#182;&#182;49-73. User-based software that blocks content can be
tailored to reflect the parents' values and the age and maturity of the child. 
As the court found, &quot;[t]he market for this type of software is growing, and
there is increasing competition among software providers to provide products.&quot;
 Id. at 35a, &#182;54.  In addition, &quot;America Online, Microsoft Network,
and Prodigy all offer parental control options free of charge to their members.&quot;
 Id. at 41a, &#182;69.</P>
<P><B>D.  The Decision Below</B></P>
<P>Following the court's findings of fact, all three judges agreed that, given
the facts about the online medium, plaintiffs had established a likelihood of
success on their claim that the challenged CDA provisions violate the First
Amendment becausethey are substantially overbroad and insufficiently tailored to
satisfy strict scrutiny.<A HREF="#11">11</A></P>
<P>Chief Judge Sloviter began her opinion by emphasizing that the CDA was not
simply a regulatory scheme; instead, &quot;we are dealing with criminal
provisions, subjecting violators to substantial penalties.&quot;  Id. at 64a. 
Rejecting the government's reliance on the statutory defenses to narrow the
broad reach of the statute, she noted:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A wealth of persuasive evidence, referred to in detail in the Findings of
Fact, proved that it is either technologically impossible or economically
prohibitive for many of the plaintiffs to comply with the CDA without seriously
impeding their posting of online material which adults have a constitutional
right to access.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 73a (Sloviter, C.J.); id. at 84a (Buckwalter, J.); id. at 113a
(Dalzell, J.).</P>
<P>Judge Dalzell also noted that &quot;the Supreme Court's First Amendment
jurisprudence compels us to consider the special qualities&quot; of the
cyberspace medium.  Id. at 872.  As Judge Dalzell explained:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I . . . have no doubt that a Newspaper Decency Act, passed because Congress
discovered that young girls had read a front page article in the New York Times
on female genital mutilation in Africa, would be unconstitutional . . . .  Nor
would a Novel Decency Act, adopted after legislators had seen too many
pot-boilers in convenience store book racks, pass constitutional muster . . . .
There is no question that a Village Green Decency Act, the fruit of a Senator's
overhearing of a ribald conversation between two adolescent boys on a park
bench, would be unconstitutional . . . . A Postal Decency Act, passed because of
constituent complaints about unsolicited lingerie catalogues, would also be
unconstitutional . . . . In these forms of communication, regulations on the
basis of decency simply would not survive First Amendment scrutiny.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 144a.  Judge Dalzell further observed that the Internet is an even
more &quot;speech-enhancing medium than print, the village green, or the mails.&quot;
 Id.  Because the CDA &quot;would necessarily reduce the speech available for
adults on the medium,&quot; it is &quot;constitutionally intolerable.&quot;  Id.</P>
<H4><A NAME="argument"></A>ARGUMENT</H4>
<P>The decision below is so clearly correct under well-established law that
this Court need not engage in plenary review.<A HREF="#12">12</A>  All six
federal judges that have reviewed the CDA have concluded that it is
unconstitutional.  The government itself has indicated that the CDA may be
unconstitutional absent the statutory defenses.<A HREF="#13">13</A>  Indeed,
the government has come close to conceding that CDA is at least in part
unconstitutional even with the defenses.<A HREF="#14">14</A></P>
<P>Summary affirmance is particularly appropriate at this stage of the
proceedings because the three-judge court's conclusions were driven by
extensive, detailed, and largely undisputed factual findings.  These facts
establish that there is currently no feasible way to identify and screen minors
from access to most areas of the Internet.  Consequently, the CDA presently
operates as a total ban on &quot;indecent&quot; but constitutionally protected
speech, a result clearly foreclosed by this Court's decisions in Butler v.
Michigan, 352 U.S. 380 (1957), and Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115
(1989).</P>
<P>Plaintiffs acknowledge that this case is an important one.  But summary
disposition is appropriate, even in cases of high import, when the decision
below is &quot;so obviously correct as to warrant no further review.&quot; 
Stern, Gressman, Shapiro &amp; Geller, Supreme Court Practice at 401.  In the
present case, this Court's decisions in Butler, Sable, and Denver Area
Educational Area Television Consortium v. FCC (DAETC) , 518 U.S.    , 116 S.Ct.
2374 (1996), establish without question that a statute imposing what amounts to
a criminal ban on a broad range of expression that is constitutionally protected
for adults flatly violates the First Amendment.</P>
<P>Finally, summary affirmance is appropriate for prudential reasons.  This is
the first case presented to the Court that directly addresses the application of
traditional free speech principles to the rapidly evolving medium of online

communications.  Only last Term In DAETC, Justice Souter cautiously observed
that &quot;[i]n my own ignorance I have to accept the real possibility that `if
we had to decide today . . . just what the First Amendment should mean in
cyberspace, we would get it fundamentally wrong.'&quot;  Id. at 2402, quoting
Lessig, &quot;The Path of Cyberlaw,&quot; 104 Yale L.J. 1743, 1745 (1995); see
also 116 S.Ct. at 2403 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part).  Appellees respectfully submit that this Court does not &quot;ha[ve] to
decide&quot; that issue today.  Instead, it can and should focus on the factual
record developed below and, based on that record, summarily affirm.</P>
<P><B>II.   GIVEN THE THREE-JUDGE COURT'S EXTENSIVE, LARGELY UNDISPUTED
FACTUAL FINDINGS REGARDING THE TECHNOLOGY AND ECONOMICS OF CYBERSPACE, THE
DECISION BELOW IS PLAINLY CORRECT</B></P>
<P>Plaintiffs recognize that summary affirmance of a lower court order
preliminarily enjoining a federal statute would be unusual.  It is, nonetheless,
fully warranted on this record.  As the three-judge court found, because there
is no way to shield minors alone from online &quot;indecency&quot; in the vast
majority of contexts, the CDA amounts to a criminal ban on constitutionally
protected communication among adults.  This Court has frequently held that a
statute that reduces adults to reading and seeing only what is fit for children
cannot be sustained under the First Amendment.</P>
<P>Indeed, this Court has never upheld a criminal ban on indecent speech, even
under the guise of protecting children.  See Butler, 352 U.S. 380 (invalidating
a conviction for distribution of indecent publications); Bolger v. Youngs Drug
Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 74 (1983)(striking down a ban on mail
advertisements for contraceptives because &quot;[t]he level of discourse
reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be suitable for
a sandbox&quot;);  Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas, 390 U.S. 676
(1968)(invalidating ordinance banning sexually explicit motion pictures); FCC v.
Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. at 750 (upholding noncriminal time-channeling
rules against indecency in broadcast); Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. at
128 (striking down indecency ban in phone communications); DAETC v. FCC, 116
S.Ct. 2374 (striking down two of three indecency regulations for cable
television, and upholding permissive regulation that allows, but does not
require, broadcasters to ban indecency from leased access channels).</P>
<P>The government cannot persuasively challenge the lower court's findings, and
has not attempted to do so.  Nor has it asked this Court to reverse any of its
well-established First Amendment rules.  To the contrary, the government does
not quarrel with the legal standard -- strict scrutiny -- used by lower court in
this case.  J.S. at 15; see also J.S. App. 67a.  On this record, therefore, the
government has failed to present the Court with any substantial constitutional
issue to resolve.</P>
<P>Before the three-judge court, the government's effort to avoid the seemingly
inescapable conclusion that the CDA is unconstitutional under Butler and its
progeny rested entirely on its proposition that some of the CDA &quot;safe
harbor&quot; defenses might work, at least some of the time, for some cyberspace
speakers.  The trial court finding that those defenses were not technologically
or economically available for the vast majority of online content providers,
including most of the plaintiffs, effectively disposes of that argument in this
Court.  See generally pp.12-14, supra.  Specifically, the lower court found that
&#167;223(e)(5)(B)'s credit card and age verification defenses were effectively
unavailable for the vast majority of communications and speakers in cyber-space.
 As to the &quot;good faith&quot; provision of &#167;223(e)(5)(A), the lower
court found that the government's proposal that &quot;tagging&quot; or
self-rating might provide a defense is &quot;purely hypothetical and offers no
currently operative defense to Internet content providers.&quot;  Id. at 79a
(Sloviter, J.).</P>
<P>In addition to the findings establishing the technical infeasibility and
economic burden of the defenses, many other factors supported the trial court's
conclusion that the CDA is not the least restrictive means of accomplishing the
government's asserted compelling interest in protecting the physical and
psychological well-being of minors.  First, the court held that the global
nature of the medium made the CDA an imprecise and ineffective tool for
achieving the government's purpose:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[T]he CDA will almost certainly fail to accomplish the Government's interest
in shielding children from pornography on the Internet.  Nearly half of Internet
communications originate outside the United States, and some percentage of that
figure represents pornography.  Pornography from, say, Amsterdam will be no less
appealing to a child on the Internet than pornography from New York City, and
residents of Amsterdam have little incentive to comply with the CDA.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 882 (Dalzell, J.).</P>
<P>Second, in contrast to the facts establishing the ineffectiveness of the
CDA, the preliminary injunction record is replete with evidence of alternative
means of accomplishing the government's purpose more efficiently and less
restrictively than through an outright criminal ban -- for example, through
parental use of blocking software and the development of additional mechanisms
for screening content on a voluntary basis.  See generally pp.14, supra.  In
addition,</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;[t]he Government can continue to protect children from pornography on
the Internet through vigorous enforcement of existing laws criminalizing
obscenity and child pornography.&quot;  J.S.App. 145a (Dalzell, J.).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Third, as Judge Sloviter noted, it is unclear on this record that the
government has a compelling interest in blocking all minors' access to all
online communications that would fit within the CDA's capacious &quot;indecency&quot;
and &quot;patent offensiveness&quot; standards.  Id. at 72a.  Judge Sloviter
thus questioned whether the government had met its burden of justifying
restrictions so broad that it could well become criminal in many communities to
permit older teenagers online access to the hit play &quot;Angels in America,&quot;
news articles on female genital mutilation, or safer sex information.  Id. at
70a.  Under these facts, the CDA clearly fails strict scrutiny, which demands
that &quot;the benefit gained [by a content-based restriction] must outweigh the
loss of constitutionally protected rights.&quot;  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347,
363 (1976).</P>
<P>The Court's ruling last Term in DAETC fully supports this conclusion.  No
Justice in that case questioned the continued vitality of the principles set
forth in Butler and Sable.  To the contrary, the Court explicitly followed
Butler and Sable in invalidating the only portion of the 1992 Cable Act<A
HREF="#15">15</A> which (like the CDA) mandated censorship:  the requirement in
&#167;10(b) of the Act that &quot;indecent&quot; programming on leased access
channels be scrambled until subscribers requested unscrambling.  Even though the
&#167;10(b) restriction was far less draconian than the criminal penalties under
the CDA, it was unconstitutional because the government had not met its burden
of demonstrating that mandated scrambling was the least burdensome means
available to accomplish its goal of protecting minors.  116 S.Ct. at 2390-2394
(plurality opinion); id. at 2396-97 (Kennedy &amp; Ginsburg, JJ., concurring in
part and dissenting in part).  As Justice Breyer wrote for the plurality:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>No provision, we concede, short of an absolute ban, can offer certain
protection against assault by a determined child.  We have not, however,
generally allowed this fact alone to justify &quot;reduc[ing] the adult
population . . . to . . . only what is fit for children.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 2393, quoting Sable, 492 U.S. at 128; Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products
Corp., 463 U.S. at 73, and Butler, 352 U.S. at 383.</P>
<P>In striking down the mandatory provision, the DAETC plurality considered the
&quot;benefits [the requirement] is likely to achieve,&quot; noting that &quot;where,
as here, the record before Congress . . . provides no convincing explanation,
this Court has not been willing to stretch the limits of the plausible . . . in
order to justify laws that impose significant restrictions upon speech.&quot; 
116 S.Ct. at 2394.  Because of the global nature of the online medium, the CDA
is even less effective than the mandatory scrambling provisions of the Cable Act
struck down by the Court in DAETC, thus warranting summary affirmance of the
preliminary injunction in this case.</P>
<P>Of the other Cable Act provisions at issue in the DAETC case, the Court
invalidated &#167;10(c)(permitting cable operators to forbid indecency on public
access channels), and upheld &#167;10(a)(giving operators similar control over
leased access programming).  Both provisions were permissive; no government
mandate -- much less a criminalization of protected speech -- was at issue. 
Even so, &#167;10(c) failed to satisfy First Amendment standards.<A HREF="#16">16</A></P>
<P>The DAETC plurality also reaffirmed the principle that the particular
qualities of the medium must be considered in determining the appropriate level
of First Amendment protection.  Justice Souter wrote, &quot;Our indecency cases
since Pacifica have likewise turned as much on the context or medium of the
speech as on its content.&quot;  Id. at 2401 n.2.  In Sable, for example, the

challenged ban on indecency was struck down in part because it &quot;involved a
communications medium, telephone service, that was significantly less likely to
expose children to banned material, was less intrusive, and allowed for
significantly more control over what comes in the home.&quot;  See 116 S.Ct. at
2388 (Breyer, J.).  Even in the cable television context, Justices Thomas,
Rehnquist, and Scalia had no doubt in DAETC that &quot;under our current
jurisprudence, Congress could not impose a total ban on the transmission of
indecent programming.&quot;  Id. at 2423, citing Sable, 492 U.S. at 127.  A
fortiori, then, certainly the government cannot justify a complete ban in the
even less invasive, and more empowering, technology of the Internet.  Yet that
is exactly what Congress accomplished in the CDA -- a criminal ban on speech in
the most democratizing and unintrusive medium that the world has yet created.</P>
<P>Thus, the application of clear legal principles to the factual findings
regarding the online medium supports summary affirmance in this case.</P>
<P><B>II.  NONE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S OTHER ARGUMENTS JUSTIFY NOTING PROBABLE
JURISDICTION AT THIS STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS</B></P>
<P>In its jurisdictional statement, the government fails to raise any
legitimate argument against summary affirmance.  First, as discussed above, the
government's argument that the overbreadth of the CDA is not &quot;substantial,&quot;
J.S. at 21-25, does not comport with the facts.<A HREF="#17">17</A></P>
<P>Second, to cure the obvious overbreadth of the CDA, the government suggests
that the trial court should have upheld &#167;223(d)'s display provision to the
extent that it applies to &quot;commercial Web sites.&quot;  J.S. at 26.  But
the trial court in this case and in the Shea case correctly declined to perform
such &quot;radical surgery.&quot;  Shea, 930 F.Supp. at 923.  As Judge Sloviter
wrote:  &quot;It is clear from the face of the CDA and from its legislative
history that Congress did not intend to limit its application to commercial
purveyors of pornography.&quot;  J.S.App. 75a; see also H.R.Rep.No. 458, 104th
Cong., 2d Sess. 113, 191 (1996).  Among other things, Congress intentionally
banned material under the CDA that lacks prurient appeal and that has serious
value.</P>
<P>Thus, narrowing the CDA's application to &quot;commercial web sites&quot;
would ban not only &quot;commercial pornographers&quot; from the Internet, but
would criminalize &quot;a broad range of material from contemporary films, plays
and books showing or describing sexual activities . . . to controversial art and
photographs.&quot;<A HREF="#18">18</A>  J.S.App. at 76a-77a. In addition, given
the explicit application of the statute to libraries and educational
institutions, the government's suggestion would require more than creative
re-drafting.  See &#167;230(e)(2); &#167;223(f)(a).  The Shea court similarly
declined the invitation &quot;to usurp Congress' legislative functions&quot;
with an interpretation that &quot;fl[ies] in the face of a clear congressional
intent to apply the statute's proscriptions to commercial and non-commercial
content providers alike.&quot;  930 F.Supp. at 949-50.</P>
<P>Third, the government creates a smokescreen to hide the overwhelming
unconstitutionality of all of the CDA's provisions by attempting to distinguish
&#167;223(a)(1)(B) and &#167;223 (d)(1)(A) from &#167;223(d)(1)(B).  J.S. at
20-21.  For several reasons, the smokescreen should not divert the Court.  Most
significantly, the government did not present the argument below.  See Holly
Farms Corp. v. NLRB, 517 U.S.    , 116 S.Ct. 1396, 1402 n.7 (1996)(declining to
entertain argument that petitioners had failed to advance previously, because
the Court &quot;generally do[es] not address arguments that were not the basis
for the decision below&quot;), quoting Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v.
Epstein, 516 U.S.    , 116 S.Ct. 873 n.5 (1996).  Until it reached this Court,
the government never suggested that any of the CDA's provisions would apply only
to the direct and intentional communication of indecency to a specific person
known to be a minor.  To the contrary, both the government and the plaintiffs
proceeded below on the assumption that each of the challenged provisions in the
CDA applied to all online communications that might be seen by any minor.  The
government therefore relied on &quot;safe harbor&quot; defenses that the
district court found to be constitutionally inadequate.  The government's
disappointment with those findings does not permit it to reinterpret the statute
on appeal.</P>
<P>In any event, the government's effort to draw distinctions between the
challenged provisions of the CDA is not supported by a fair reading of the
statute when viewed as a whole.  Section 223(a)(1)(B) and &#167;223(d)(1)(A)
suffer from the same Butler and Sable problems of overbreadth that are fatal to
&#167;223(d)(1)(B)'s &quot;display&quot; provision.  Every online speaker in the
publicly accessible areas of cyberspace (including the World Wide Web,
newsgroups, mailing lists, and chat rooms) would have to reduce his or her
speech to that which is suitable only for minors in order to avoid criminal
penalties under any of the provisions.  Specifically, &#167;223(d)(1)(A) makes
it a crime to &quot;knowingly use[] an interactive computer service to send to a
specific person or persons under 18 years of age&quot; any material that is &quot;patently
offensive.&quot;  It does not require that the defendant &quot;know&quot; that
the recipient is a minor, but rather only requires that the defendant &quot;knowingly
use[] an interactive computer service.&quot;  Thus, any use of an interactive
computer service to communicate in the vast public areas of cyberspace could
result in the sending of &quot;patently offensive&quot; material &quot;to a
specific person . . . under 18.&quot;  Similarly, &#167;223(a)(1)(B) makes it a
crime to &quot;make[], create[], or solicit[], and initiate[] the transmission
of&quot; any indecent material &quot;knowing that the recipient of the
communication is under 18 years of age.&quot;  The user &quot;knows&quot; that
minors have access to the vast public portions of cyberspace; thus, the user
risks prosecution under &#167;223(a)(1)(B) because simply by speaking in these
spaces the user may have knowingly &quot;initiat[ed] the transmission&quot; of
indecent material to a person under eighteen.</P>
<P>Moreover, Congress clearly applied the &quot;safe harbor&quot; defenses of &#167;223(e)(5)
to all three provisions of the CDA.<A HREF="#19">19</A>  If &#167;223(a)(1)(B)
and &#167;223(d)(1)(A) were meant to apply only to persons who intentionally
communicated indecent or patently offensive material to a particular person they
knew to be a minor, it would be nonsensical for such defendants to assert &#167;223(e)(5)(A)'s
&quot;good faith&quot; defense, or &#167;223(e)(5)(B)'s &quot;verified credit
card&quot; defense, to avoid prosecution.<A HREF="#20">20</A>  Thus, contrary
to the government's new interpretation in its Jurisdictional Statement, all
three provisions of the CDA potentially affect communications between adults,
and will have a serious chilling effect on online communication.<A HREF="#21">21</A></P>
<P>The fourth argument the government makes for plenary review is that the
Court should take the case to consider whether the CDA is unconstitutionally
vague.  J.S.App. 86a-87a (Buckwalter, J.); id. at 80a (Sloviter, C.J.).  But the
Court may summarily affirm without reaching the vagueness issue.  It was the
CDA's overbreadth and its failure to meet strict scrutiny that was the
dispositive issue both in this case and in Shea.  In addition, as discussed
above, given the new and evolving medium of cyberspace, it may be premature for

the Court to rule on whether, in the context of the online medium, the &quot;indecency&quot;
and &quot;patently offensive&quot; provisions provide adequate guidance for
millions of speakers to avoid criminal prosecution.<A HREF="#22">22</A></P>
<P>Finally, the government argues that plenary review is appropriate because &quot;[i]n
light of the rapid development and innovative capabilities of all components of
the Internet industry, there is every reason to expect that technological steps
will occur swiftly if the CDA's indecency restrictions are upheld.&quot;  But,
as Judge Sloviter wrote, &quot;I can imagine few arguments less likely to
persuade a court to uphold a criminal statute than one that depends on future
technology.&quot;  J.S.App. 82a.  In addition, the expansion of existing
industry alternatives to empower parents to control Internet content -- rather
than somehow legitimizing the CDA -- merely illustrates that less restrictive
alternatives to the CDA's draconian ban are clearly available and, therefore, as
the trial court correctly held, the CDA fails strict scrutiny.</P>

<H4><A NAME="notes"></A>NOTES</H4>
<P><A NAME="1"></A>1 The CDA was enacted as Title V of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996, Pub.L.No. 104-104, &#167;502, 110 Stat. 56, 133-35.  The CDA will
be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;223(a) to (h), and it is those cites that
appellees will use throughout this brief.</P>
<P><A NAME="2"></A>2 A separate challenge to &#167;223(d), filed in the
Southern District of New York, also resulted in a preliminary injunction from a
three-judge court on July 29, 1996.  Shea v. Reno, 930 F.Supp 916 (S.D.N.Y.
1996).  The government has suggested that the Shea case be held pending the
outcome of this case; ACLU appellees agree.</P>
<P><A NAME="3"></A>3 Section 223(a)(1)(B) also prohibits the transmission of &quot;obscene&quot;
communications.  That prohibition has not been challenged in this case.</P>
<P><A NAME="4"></A>4 Plaintiffs also challenged &#167;&#167;223(a)(2) and
(d)(2), which make it a crime to &quot;knowingly permit&quot; use of a
telecommunications facility for expression prohibited by &#167;&#167;223(a)(1)(B)
or 223(d)(1).</P>
<P><A NAME="5"></A>5 For a fuller description of the plaintiffs, see The
Parties' Stipulations in Preparation for the Preliminary Injunction Hearing, at
&#182;&#182;70-356, adopted as findings of the trial court, J.S.App. 12a n.9. 
Those paragraphs are reproduced in the Appendix to this motion.  See also
J.S.App. at 42a-48, &#182;&#182;74-78, 85.</P>
<P><A NAME="6"></A>6 See J.S.App. 44a, &#182;76.</P>
<P><A NAME="7"></A>7 Id. at 71a (Sloviter, C.J.)(&quot;[P]laintiffs presented
testimony that [their] material . . . may be critically important for certain
older minors.  For example, there was testimony that one quarter of all new HIV
infections in the United States is estimated to occur in young people between
the ages of 13 and 20, an estimate the government made no effort to rebut&quot;).</P>
<P><A NAME="8"></A>8 Decl. of Kiyoshi Kuromiya, at 3-5, &#182;13, &#182;15, &#182;16.
 Direct testimony at trial was presented by declaration.  J.S.App. 5a.</P>
<P><A NAME="9"></A>9 Decl. of Barry Steinhardt.  The ACLU also hosts
unmoderated online discussion groups, including a &quot;free speech zone,&quot;
that allow citizens to discuss and debate a variety of civil liberties issues.</P>
<P><A NAME="10"></A>10 App. at 6a, &#182;89.</P>
<P><A NAME="11"></A>11 Although the judges jointly issued findings of fact and
conclusions of law, and agreed that the CDA fails strict scrutiny and is
unconstitutionally overbroad, each of the three judges issued a separate
opinion.  Judge Buckwalter and Judge Sloviter also held that the CDA was
unconstitutionally vague; Judge Dalzell disagreed.</P>
<P><A NAME="12"></A>12 This Court has stated that &quot;[a] summary
disposition affirms only the judgment of the court below, and no more may be
read into our action than was essential to sustain that judgment.&quot; 
Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 784 n.5 (1983); see generally Stern,
Gressman, Shapiro &amp; Geller, Supreme Court Practice 215-221, &#167;&#167;4.28-4.29
 (7th ed. 1993).</P>
<P><A NAME="13"></A>13 Shea, 930 F.Supp at 941 (&quot;The Government concedes
that &#167;223(d), standing alone, is not constitutionally defensible&quot;).</P>
<P><A NAME="14"></A>14 See J.S. at 14, noting that &#167;223(d)(1)(B) &quot;raises
more difficult questions,&quot; and arguing for a narrowing construction &quot;[e]ven
if one or more of the CDA's restrictions were unconstitutional in some of their
applications . . . .&quot;</P>
<P><A NAME="15"></A>15 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition
Act of 1992, 106 Stat. 1486, 47 U.S.C. &#167;532.</P>
<P><A NAME="16"></A>16 Section 10(a) was upheld in large part because the
First Amendment interests of cable operators were enhanced by returning to them
some measure of editorial control over leased access channels.  DAETC, 116 S.Ct.
at 2385-87.  In dissenting from the plurality's striking of &#167;10(b) and &#167;10(c),
Justices Thomas, Rehnquist, and Scalia rejected a First Amendment jurisprudence
that was less protective of the electronic than of the print media, agreed with
Justices Kennedy and Ginsburg that strict scrutiny was appropriate, and only
differed with the other Justices as to the relative strengths of the competing
free speech interests asserted by cable programmers and cable operators.  116
S.Ct. at 2422, 2429.  In the present case, it is difficult to draw lines between
speakers and content providers, Internet Service Providers, and listeners on the
Internet, since many users engage in several roles simultaneously.  More
importantly, the CDA does not enhance (or restore) anyone's free speech rights.</P>
<P><A NAME="17"></A>17 See generally pp.12-14, supra.  See also the ALA
Plaintiffs' Response to the Government's Jurisdictional Statement for a
discussion of the government's misstatement of the factual record.</P>

<P><A NAME="18"></A>18 Nor, said Judge Sloviter, could the statute's
overbreadth be cured by the government's suggestion that it probably would not
prosecute &quot;works of serious literary or artistic merit,&quot; for that
would &quot;require a broad trust indeed from a generation of judges not far
removed from the attacks on James Joyce's Ulysses as obscene . . . . The bottom
line is that the First Amendment should not be interpreted to require us to
entrust the protection it affords to the judgment of prosecutors.&quot;  Id. at
83a.</P>
<P><A NAME="19"></A>19 Section 223(e)(5) provides &quot;a defense to a
prosecution under subsection (a)(1)(B) or (d)&quot; (emphasis added).</P>
<P><A NAME="20"></A>20 In addition, the problem of coercion and enticement of
minors via computer, which would appear to be the rationale for any provision
covering intentional communications to minors, was already covered elsewhere in
the CDA, at &#167;508, codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167;2422(b).  Plaintiffs do not
challenge that provision.</P>
<P><A NAME="21"></A>21 The government's new argument also ignores the scope of
the &quot;indecency&quot; and &quot;patently offensive&quot; prohibitions, which
includes a vast amount of material that has social value -- indeed, that may be
life-saving -- for older minors.  See generally pp.4-7 &amp; n.7, 10-12, supra,
and Appendix.</P>

<P><A NAME="22"></A>22 See generally pp.4-7, supra.  Contrary to the
government's assertion, however, the vagueness holding of the lower court is not
precluded by this Court's decisions in DAETC.  Unlike the CDA, the statute at
issue in that case did not impose criminal sanctions, involved an entirely
different medium, and did not raise questions about the viability of applying
local community standards in a global medium.  As Judge Buckwalter pointed out,
&quot;In statutes that break into relatively new areas, such as this one, the
need for definition of terms is greater, because even commonly understood terms
may have different connotations or parameters in this new context.&quot; 
J.S.App. 101a.</P>

<H1><A NAME="FIRST">FIRST AMENDMENT</A></H1>
<H1>A.  Freedom of Expression</H1>
<P>In 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 64 U.S.L.W. 4313 (May 13,
1996)(9-0), the Court unanimously struck down a Rhode Island statute that
prohibited liquor price advertising.  The case is the latest in a series of
cases providing enhanced constitutional protection for commercial speech.  All
nine justices agreed that the challenged ban was &quot;more extensive than
necessary&quot; to serve the state's interest in promoting temperance and thus
failed the fourth prong of the Central Hudson test traditionally applied to
commercial speech.  Four members of the Court were prepared to go even further,
arguing that a state's paternalistic effort to regulate behavior by withholding
information should always be subject to strict First Amendment scrutiny, whether
or not commercial speech is involved.  The ACLU submitted an amicus brief
arguing that the Rhode Island statute was unconstitutional.</P>
<P>In Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. Federal Election
Commission, 64 U.S.L.W. 4663 (June 26, 1996)(7-2), seven members of the Court
agreed that the Colorado Republican Party could not constitutionally be
sanctioned for a campaign expenditure &quot;in connection with&quot; the 1986
senatorial campaign that exceeded the limits set in the Federal Election
Campaign Act, 2 U.S.C. &#167;441a(d)(3).  The Court disagreed, however, on the
proper rationale.  Justices Breyer, O'Connor and Souter concluded that the
expenditure limits were unconstitutional as applied because there was no
evidence in this record that the party's expenditures were coordinated with the
candidate.  Justices Kennedy, Rehnquist and Scalia took the position that even
coordinated party expenditures could not be limited under the First Amendment
and, thus, would have stricken the statute as unconstitutional on its face. 
Justices Thomas, Rehnquist and Scalia were also prepared to invalidate the
challenged provision on its face.  They argued that party expenditure limits are
unconstitutional even if viewed as contributions to the candidate since they
regarded the risk of corruption in these circumstances as minimal.  The ACLU
submitted an amicus brief arguing that the expenditure limits were
unconstitutional as applied and on their face.</P>
<P>In O'Hare Truck Service , Inc. v. City of Northlake, 64 U.S.L.W. ____ (June
28, 1996)(7-2), the Court held that independent government contractors, like
government employees, are protected by the First Amendment.  Accordingly, their
contract with the government cannot be terminated on the basis of their
political affiliation except in the rare circumstances where political
affiliation is relevant to the job they perform.  The ACLU represented the
government contractor in this case.</P>
<P>In Board of County Commissioners v. Umbehr, 64 U.S.L.W. ____ (June 28,
1996)(7-2), the Court held that independent government contractors are also
protected against retaliatory action because they exercise their freedom of
speech to criticize government officials.  Adopting the familiar Pickering test
that applies to government employees, the Court held that the free speech rights
of government contractors must be balanced against the government's interest in
the efficient performance of government services.  The Court thus specifically
rejected the holding of several lower courts that independent contractors had no
First Amendment rights.  The ACLU submitted an amicus brief urging the Court to
recognize the First Amendment rights of government contractors.</P>
<P>In Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium (DAETC) v. FCC, 64
U.S.L.W. ____ (June 28, 1996), a divided Court issued a fragmented decision
striking down two provisions of a 1992 federal law designed to regulate &quot;indecency&quot;
on cable, while upholding a third.  In contrast to the D.C. Court of Appeals,
all nine justices agreed that the federal law had to be analyzed under the First
Amendment despite the fact that it purports to leave at least some censorship
decisions in the hands of private cable operators.  By a 7-2 vote, the Court
upheld &#167;10(a) of the Act, which &quot;permits&quot; cable operators to ban &quot;indecent&quot;
programming from leased access channels.  But, by a 6-3 vote, the Court struck
down &#167;10(b) of the Act, which requires cable operators to &quot;segregate
and block&quot; any &quot;indecent&quot; programming allowed on lease access
channels.  In the Court's view, the requirement that all &quot;indecent&quot;
programming be confined to a single leased access channel that must be blocked
unless subscribers affirmatively request access is more restrictive than
necessary to serve the government's interest in protecting children.  Finally,
by a 5-4 vote, the Court also struck down &#167;10(c) of the Act, which permits
cable operators to ban &quot;indecent&quot; programming from public access
channels.  The Court distinguished &#167;10(c) from &#167;10(a) primarily by
emphasizing the differences between public and leased access in terms of their
history and purpose.  As Justice Kennedy pointed out in his opinion concurring
in part and dissenting in part, the plurality opinion (written by Justice
Breyer) is perhaps most remarkable for its explicit refusal to define the
constitutional standard applicable in this context.  The ACLU represented DAETC
in this case.</P>
<H1><A NAME="FOURTH">FOURTH AMENDMENT</A></H1>
<P>In Ornelas v. United States, 64 U.S.L.W. 4373 (May 28, 1996) (8-1), the
Court ruled that determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause under
the Fourth Amendment involve mixed questions of law and fact that are subject to
de novo review on appeal.  Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Rehnquist
explained that independent appellate review helps to ensure consistency and
clarity in the applicable legal rules.  The ACLU submitted an amicus brief
arguing in favor of the position ultimately adopted by the Court.</P>
<P>In Whren v. United States, 64 U.S.L.W. 4409 (June 10, 1996)   (9-0), the
Court unanimously rejected the claim that the Fourth Amendment bars &quot;pretextual&quot;
searches.  Accordingly, the Court held that the police may stop a car for a
traffic violation and search for drugs even if it is clear that but for the
desire to search for drugs (without probable cause) the police would not have
stopped the car for the traffic violation.  If this practice leads to
discriminatory enforcement, Justice Scalia wrote, the motorist's only recourse
it to seek relief under the Equal Protection Clause.  The ACLU submitted an
amicus brief arguing that pretextual searches violated the Fourth Amendment.</P>
<H1><A NAME="FIFTH">FIFTH AMENDMENT</A></H1>
<H1>A.  Double Jeopardy</H1>
<P>In Rutledge v. United States, 64 U.S.L.W. 4238 (Mar. 27, 1996)(9-0), a
unanimous Court held that double jeopardy principles bar the government from
using the same criminal agreement to prosecute a defendant for conspiracy to
distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;846, and for conducting a
continuing criminal enterprise in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;848.  In reaching
this conclusion, the Court specifically rejected the government's contention
that the defendant had not been punished twice for the same offense because he
was sentenced to two concurrent life sentences.</P>
<P>In United States v. Ursery, 64 U.S.L.W. 4565 (June 24, 1996)  (8-1),the
Court ruled that civil forfeiture is not punishment for purposes of the Double
Jeopardy Clause, and thus the government may seek criminal prosecution and civil
forfeiture in separate proceedings arising out of the same offense.  Writing for
the majority, Chief Justice Rehnquist relied on the historic fiction that civil
forfeiture proceedings are against the property rather than the person.  The
ACLU submitted an amicus brief urging the Court to apply the Double Jeopardy
Clause in these circumstances.</P>
<H1><A NAME="SIXTH">SIXTH AMENDMENT</A></H1>
<H1>A.  Trial By Jury</H1>
<P>In Lewis v. United States, 64 U.S.L.W. 4581 (June 24, 1996)   (7-2), the
Court held that a criminal defendant who is charged with multiple offenses is
not entitled to a jury trial so long as the maximum penalty for each offense
does not exceed six months.  In an opinion written by Justice O'Connor, the
majority rejected the argument that the maximum penalty for each offense should
be &quot;aggregated&quot; in determining whether the jury trial right applies. 
Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion described the majority's reasoning as &quot;one
of the most serious incursions on the right to trial by jury in the Court's
history . . . .&quot;  Id. at 4583.  He nonetheless concurred in the result
because the trial judge in this case had assured the defendant before trial that
he would not be sentenced to more than six months even if he was convicted of
more than one offense.  The ACLU submitted an amicus brief arguing that the
defendant was entitled to a jury trial.</P>

<H1><A NAME="SEVENTH">SEVENTH AMENDMENT</A></H1>
<P>In Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 64 U.S.L.W. 4263 Apr. 23,
1996)(9-0), the Court unanimously concluded that questions concerning the scope
of a patent, as opposed to whether or not the patent has been infringed, are
properly decided by a judge rather than a jury.  The Court reached this
conclusion based on historical practice and &quot;the relative interpretive
skills of judges and juries . . . .&quot;  Id. at 4267.</P>
<P>In Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., 64 U.S.L.W. 4607 (June 24,
1996)(5-4), the Court held that, under Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64
(1938), a federal court in a diversity action should apply state law rules for
reviewing the appropriateness of a jury award, with one caveat.  In federal
court, it is the trial court not the appellate court that must apply the
substantive rule imposed by state law.  The appellate court is then limited to
reviewing the trial court's determination under an abuse of discretion standard
because of the Seventh Amendment's general injunction against &quot;re-examin[ing]&quot;
jury findings.</P>
<H1><A NAME="DEATH">DEATH PENALTY</A></H1>
<P>In Tuggle v. Netherland, 64 U.S.L.W. 3315 (October 30, 1995)(9-0), the Court
summarily reversed a death sentence that had been based on two aggravating
circumstances, one of which was declared invalid on appeal.  The lower courts
had held that the remaining, valid aggravating circumstance was sufficient to
uphold the death sentence, citing Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862 (1983).  In a
per curiam opinion, however, the Court ruled that the existence of a valid
aggravating circumstance did not justify imposition of the death penalty when
the invalidated circumstance led the jury to consider misleading or otherwise
tainted evidence in a state that requires the jury to balance aggravating
circumstances against mitigating circumstances.</P>
<P>In Loving v. United States, 64 U.S.L.W. 4390 (June 3, 1996) (9-0), the Court
unanimously upheld the President's power to define the aggravating circumstances
that entitle a court-martial to impose the death penalty on a member of the
armed forces.  The Court concluded that Congress had delegated this power to the
President, and that the delegation did not violate separation of powers.  Four
members of the Court joined in a concurring opinion by Justice Stevens that
expressly left open the question of whether military courts have jurisdiction to
try capital crimes that are not service-related.  Justice Thomas also wrote a

separate opinion questioning whether military courts are subject to the same
Eighth Amendment rules that apply to civilian courts in capital cases.  The ACLU
submitted an amicus brief supporting Loving's separation of powers claim.</P>

p.13.</P>
<H1><A NAME="REPRODUCTIVE">REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS</A></H1>
<P>In Janklow v. Planned Parenthood, 64 U.S.L.W. 3725 (Apr. 29, 1996), the
Court denied South Dakota's petition for certiorari to review an Eighth Circuit
decision striking down the state's parental notification law as an undue burden
on the right of minors to obtain abortions.  Justices Rehnquist, Scalia and
Thomas wrote an opinion dissenting from the denial of certiorari, which produced
a responsive opinion from Justice Stevens.  The exchange of opinions reveals a
deep rift within the Court on the proper standard for reviewing facial
challenges in abortion cases.</P>
<P>In Leavitt v. Jane L., 64 U.S.L.W. 3834 (June 17, 1996)       (5-4), the
Court summarily reversed a Tenth Circuit ruling that had struck down provisions
of a Utah law governing abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy on the theory that
those provisions could not be severed from other provisions of the same law
governing abortions prior to 20 weeks, which had been ruled unconstitutional. 
The Court then remanded the case to the Tenth Circuit to determine, for the
first time, whether the post-20 week provisions could survive constitutional
scrutiny under Casey.  The Court itself did not express any opinion on the
ultimate constitutionality of the challenged provisions.  The ACLU was
co-counsel for the plaintiffs in the case.</P>

<H1><A NAME="ELEVENTH">ELEVENTH AMENDMENT</A></H1>
<P>In Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 64 U.S.L.W. 4167 (Mar. 27,
1996)(5-4), a bitterly divided Court struck down a provision of the Indian
Gaming Regulatory Act that permitted tribes to sue a state in federal court if
the state failed to negotiate in good faith about the creation of new casinos on
Indian lands.  The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice Rehnquist, held
that the Eleventh Amendment protects the states against suit in federal court,
and that Congress may not override that protection except when acting pursuant
to its Fourteenth Amendment powers.  The majority also held that the existence
of a &quot;detailed remedial scheme&quot; under the statute, id. at 4175,
precluded an injunctive suit against individual state defendants under Ex Parte
Young.  In a lengthy dissent, Justice Souter disputed the majority's
understanding of both the Eleventh Amendment and Ex Parte Young.</P>
<H1><A NAME="EQUAL">EQUAL PROTECTION</A></H1>
<P>In United States v. Armstrong, 64 U.S.L.W. 4305 (May 13, 1996)(8-1), the
Court ruled that evidence that all 24 crack cases &quot;closed&quot; by the
Federal Public Defenders Office in the Central District of California during
1991 involved black defendants was insufficient to entitle the black defendants
in this case to discovery on their selective prosecution claim.  Rather, the
Court held, defendants were first required to show that other &quot;similarly
situated&quot; white defendants had not been prosecuted for the same crime.  The
majority opinion, written by Chief Justice Rehnquist, did not further explain
what &quot;similarly situated&quot; means in this context.  Justice Stevens'
dissent focused on the racially disparate impact of the federal drug laws,
especially regarding crack cocaine.  The ACLU submitted an amicus brief
supporting defendants' request for discovery in this case.</P>
<P>In Romer v. Evans, 64 U.S.L.W. 4353 (May 20, 1996)(6-3), the Court struck
down an amendment to the Colorado Constitution, so-called Amendment 2, which
both repealed all state and local laws that protected lesbians and gays against
discrimination and prohibited their future reenactment.  The majority opinion,
written by Justice Kennedy, first rejected as &quot;implausible&quot; the
state's claim that Amendment 2 was merely designed to withhold &quot;special
rights&quot; from gays and lesbians.  Id. at 4354.  Second, the Court held,
Amendment 2 could not survive minimum scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause
because &quot;it lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state interests.&quot;
 Id. at 4356.  As the Court explained:  &quot;[I]ts sheer breadth is so
discontinuous with the reasons offered for it that the amendment seems

<P>In United States v. Virginia, 64 U.S.L.W. 4638 (June 26, 1996)(7-1), the
Court ruled that the exclusion of women from VMI, a state-run military college,
violates equal protection.  The majority opinion, written by Justice Ginsburg,
found that the state had failed to provide &quot;an exceedingly persuasive
justification&quot; for its male-only admissions policy.  In particular, the
Court rejected the two justifications that the state had put forward.  First,
the Court held that VMI could not be justified as part of a comprehensive state
plan to provide diverse educa tional opportunities for Virginia students.  As
Justice Ginsburg noted, &quot;[h]owever `liberally' this plan serves the State's
sons, it makes no provision whatever for its daughters.&quot;  Id. at 4645. 
Second, the Court concluded that VMI's unique educational attributes would not
be destroyed by the admission of women.  Finally, the Court held that the
state's creation of a separate educational program for women who were denied
admission to VMI did not remedy the equal protection violation since the program
offered to women could not match the program, prestige or resources available to
male students at VMI.  The ACLU submitted an amicus brief supporting the
challenge to VMI's exclusion of women.</P>

<P>In Wood v. Bartholomew, 64 U.S.L.W. 3267 (Oct. 10, 1995)</P>
<P>(5-4), the Court summarily reversed a Ninth Circuit decision holding that
the prosecution's failure to supply the defense with the polygraph results of a
key witness violated due process because it &quot;might have&quot; affected the
defense's preparation for trial.  In a per curiam opinion, the Court ruled that
such speculation did not justify a writ of habeas corpus when the prosecution's
case was otherwise overwhelming and when trial counsel conceded that the
withheld polygraph results would not have altered his trial strategy.</P>
<P>In Cooper v. Oklahoma, 64 U.S.L.W. 4255 (April 16, 1996)      (9-0), the
Court unanimously held that the due process clause prohibits a state from
requiring a criminal defendant to prove his incompetence by clear and convincing
evidence.  The Court had previously held that a state may shift the burden of
proving incompetence to the defendant.  The Court nevertheless saw a significant
difference between a &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; standard and a &quot;clear
and convincing evidence&quot; standard.  As the Court pointed out, under
Oklahoma's heightened standard, the state &quot;may proceed with a criminal
trial after a defendant has shown that his is more likely than not incompetent.&quot;
 Id. at 4257.</P>
<P>In BMW of North America v. Gore, 64 U.S.L.W. 4335 (May 20, 1996)(5-4), the
Court struck down a $2 million punitive damage award as &quot;grossly excessive&quot;
and thus in violation of the Due Process Clause.  The majority reached this
conclusion by evaluating the award against three constitutional &quot;guideposts&quot;:
 (1) the reprehensibility of the underlying conduct; (2) the ratio between the
punitive damage award and the actual damages suffered by the plaintiff; and (3)
the civil and criminal sanctions available for similar misconduct.  In a
separate concurrence, three members of the majority also pointed out the lack of
any effective state law mechanism to channel the jury's discretion.</P>

<P>In Richards v. Jefferson County, 64 U.S.L.W. 4405 (June 10, 1966)(9-0), the
Court unanimously held that a litigant cannot be bound by the judgment in an
earlier case when the litigant never received notice of the earlier case and was
not adequately represented in it.  Writing for the Court, Justice Stevens also
made it clear that the question of adequate representation in an earlier
proceeding must be strictly construed because, as a general principle, &quot;the
State may not deprive individual litigants of their own day in Court.&quot;  Id.
at 4408.</P>
<P>In Montana v. Egelhoff, 64 U.S.L.W. 4500 (June 13, 1996)      (5-4), the
Court rejected the due process claim of a Montana murder defendant who had been
barred by a Montana statute from introducing evidence that he was drunk at the
time the crime was committed.  Writing for a four-member plurality, Justice
Scalia held that the Montana evidentiary rule did not offend &quot;fundamental
notions of justice&quot;; to the contrary, he concluded, it was consistent with
the prevailing common law practice.  Justice Ginsburg concurred in the result,
but on a different theory.  In her view, the Montana statute was not an
evidentiary rule but instead redefined the elements of the crime so that the
defendant's sobriety was irrelevant.  Nothing in the due process clause, she
wrote, prevents a state from punishing a drunk defendant as severely as a sober
one.  The principal dissent, written by Justice O'Connor, argued that Montana
had unconstitutionally barred the defendant from presenting his defense.</P>

<P>In Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 64 U.S.L.W. 4088 (Feb. 21, 1996)(9-0), the
Court unanimously struck down a North Carolina taxing scheme under the Commerce
Clause.  Under the invalidated statute, North Carolina residents who owned

shares in out-of-state corporations were required to pay a higher tax than North

Carolina residents who owned shares of equal value in-state corporations.  The
Court noted that state laws that facially discriminate against interstate
commerce are presumptively invalid.  The Court also reiterated that any state
justification for such discriminatory treatment is subject to strict scrutiny.</P>

<P>In Lewis v. Casey, 64 U.S.L.W. 4587 (June 24, 1996)(8-1), the Court reversed
significant portions of an injunction designed to provide Arizona prisoners with
meaningful &quot;access to the courts.&quot;  Narrowly interpreting its prior
ruling in Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817 (1977), the Court held that even the
total absence of a prison law library does not violate the Constitution unless
an individual prisoner can show that he or she was effectively barred from
pursuing a &quot;nonfrivolous&quot; legal claim as a result, and thus suffered
an &quot;actual injury.&quot;  Id. at 4589.  The Court also held that a
system-wide injunction is inappropriate absent proof of system-wide problems. 
Finally, the majority suggested that the Constitution only protects a right of
access to the Court and not a right to &quot;discover grievances&quot; or &quot;to
litigate effectively once in court.&quot;  Id. at 4589.  Four members of the
Court dissented from this last limitation on Bounds, as well as from the
principle that the right of access to court depends on a threshold determination
that the prisoner's claim is nonfrivolous.  Only Justice Stevens, however,
broadly dissented from the majority's restrictive interpretation of prisoners'
rights.  The ACLU represented the plaintiff prisoners in this case.</P>

<P>In Morse v. Republican Party of Virginia, 64 U.S.L.W. 4207 (Mar. 27,
1996)(5-4), the Court ruled that the decision by Virginia's Republican Party to
impose a $35 registration fee for participation in the nominating convention
where it chose its candidate for U.S. Senator was subject to preclearance under
&#167;5 of the Voting Rights Act.  In separate plurality opinions, Justices
Stevens and Breyer relied heavily on the White Primary Cases as justification
for their interpretations of the Voting Rights Act.  The Court also held that
individual voters are entitled to bring suit under &#167;10 of the Voting Rights
Act, which bars imposition of a poll tax.  The ACLU submitted an amicus brief
supporting the challenge in this case under both sections 5 and 10.</P>
<P>In Bush v. Vera, 64 U.S.L.W. 4452 (June 13, 1996)(5-4), the Court declared
three majority-minority districts in Texas unconstitutional on the ground that
race was a &quot;predominant&quot; factor in the way that the districts were
drawn, and that the use of race in drawing the districts was not &quot;narrowly
tailored&quot; to avoid a violation of &#167;2 of the Voting Rights Act (which
prohibits the &quot;dilution&quot; of minority voting strength) because the new
districts were not &quot;compact.&quot;  The plurality opinion, written by
Justice O'Connor, concluded that race was a &quot;predominant&quot; factor
despite substantial evidence that incumbency protection also played an important
role in the Texas redistricting plan.  The four dissenters all disagreed with
the Court's use of strict scrutiny in these challenges to majority-minority
districts.  Justice Stevens also disputed the Court's evaluation of the factual
record and the role that race played in the state's redistricting decisions. 
Justice Souter emphasized the significant confusion that has been created by the
Court's voting rights jurisprudence.  </P>
<P>In Shaw v. Hunt, 64 U.S.L.W. 4437 (June 13, 1996)(5-4), the Court struck
down the 12th Congressional District in North Carolina as an unconstitutional
racial gerrymander.  Extending its 1993 holding in Shaw I, the Court held that
the &quot;bizarre&quot; shape of the majority-minority district disregarded
traditional redistricting practices and thus triggered strict scrutiny.  As in
Vera, Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion held that the challenged
district could not be justified as a response to a general history of racial
discrimination in North Carolina, nor could its &quot;bizarre&quot; shape be
justified by reliance on &#167;2 of the Voting Rights Act.  Justice Stevens
ended his dissenting opinion by observing:  &quot;I [do not] see how our
constitutional tradition can countenance the suggestion that a State may draw
unsightly lines to favor farmers or city dwellers, but not to create districts
that benefit the very group whose history inspired the Amendment that the Voting
Rights Act was designed to implement.&quot;  Id. at 4452.  The ACLU submitted an

<P>In Wisconsin v. City of New York, 64 U.S.L.W. 4153 (Mar. 20, 1996)(9-0), the
Court unanimously rejected the claim that the Constitution required the
Secretary of Commerce to make a statistical adjustment for the conceded
undercount in the 1990 census, which disproportionately disfavored minorities. 
Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist held that any disproportionate
racial impact was not intentional (and thus did not trigger the Equal Protection
Clause), and that the strict scrutiny required in intra-state districting cases
to justify any departure from the one person, one vote rule did not apply to the
census.  Rather, the Court ruled, the critical question is whether the
Secretary's decision on how to conduct the census, bears a &quot;reasonable
relationship&quot; to the constitutional goal of &quot;an actual enumeration.&quot;
 Id. at 4158.  Here, the Court found that standard had been met.  The ACLU

<P>In Dalton v. Family Planning Services, 64 U.S.L.W. 3622 (March 18,

1996)(9-0), the Supreme Court unanimously ruled, in a per curiam opinion, that
the Eighth Circuit had gone too far in invalidating &quot;in its entirety&quot;
an Arkansas law that denied public funding for abortions except when necessary
to save the mother's life.  The Court assumed, without deciding, that the Eighth
Circuit was correct in holding that the Arkansas law conflicted with the 1994
Hyde Amendment, which extended federal medicaid funding to abortions resulting
from an act of rape or incest.  But, the Court held, the Arkansas law should
only have been invalidated to that extent.  For example, the Court pointed out,
the Hyde Amendment has no relevance to state programs that are not supported by
federal funds.  Because there is no conflict in that instance, the Court held,
there should be no preemption.</P>
<P>In Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 64 U.S.L.W. 4625 (June 26, 1996)  (5-4), the

a role for the FDA in approving medical devices, does not preempt common law
tort actions when those medical devices are defective.  The majority opinion by
Justice Stevens relied, in part, on the rule that a congressional intent to
preempt state law must be clearly expressed, especially in a traditional field
of state regulation, like health and safety.</P>

Rehabilitation Act of 1973 because the text of the statute does not explicitly
waive the federal government's sovereign immunity.  In reaching this result,
Justice O'Connor's majority opinion largely ignored the statute's purpose and
history.  Justice Stevens, who dissented, responded by noting:  &quot;When
judge-made rules [of statutory construction] require Congress to use its
valuable time enacting and reenacting provisions whose original intent was clear
to all but the most skeptical and hostile reader, the rules should be discarded.&quot;

<P>In O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp., 64 U.S.L.W. 4243 (April 1,

is replaced by someone &quot;substantially younger,&quot; id. at 4244, creates
an inference of discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,
even if the replacement employee is also over 40 and thus within the statute's
protected class.  As Justice Scalia summarized the Court's holding:  &quot;The
fact that one person in the protected class has lost out to another person in
the protected class is . . . irrelevant, so long as he has lost out because of
his age.&quot;  Id. (emphasis in original).</P>

appeal.  Relying heavily on its prior decision in Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S.

<P>In Thompson v. Keohane, 64 U.S.L.W. 4027 (Nov. 29, 1995)</P>
<P>(7-2), the Court concluded that the determination of whether a suspect is &quot;in
custody&quot; during a police interrogation, and therefore entitled to Miranda
warnings, is a mixed question of fact and law rather than a purely factual
judgment.  Accordingly, the Court held, a state court's judgment on the &quot;in
custody&quot; question is not entitled to a presumption of correctness but,
instead, must be subject to de novo review by a federal court in habeas
proceedings.</P>
<P>In Lonchar v. Thomas, 64 U.S.L.W. 4245 (April 1, 1996)(9-0), the Court
unanimously held that a first federal habeas petition cannot be dismissed based
on &quot;abuse of the writ&quot; grounds even if it was filed at the eleventh
hour, as in this case.  Instead, the Court held, the Habeas Rules require a
finding, not made here, that the prisoner's delay in filing the petition &quot;prejudiced&quot;
the state by impairing its ability to respond.  The Court also unanimously ruled
that it was wrong to deny a stay of execution in this capital case, although the
Court split 5-4 on its reasoning.  Writing for five members of the Court,
Justice Breyer took the position that the standard for denying a stay and
dismissing a first petition were necessarily the same in a capital case -- i.e.,
required a showing of prejudice -- or else the execution would inevitably moot
the petition.  Writing a separate concurrence for four members of the Court,
Chief Justice Rehnquist argued that a stay could be denied on a finding that a
delayed petition represented an abuse of the writ regardless of prejudice (and
despite the fact that denial of a stay would result in execution of the
prisoner), but that no finding of abuse was made below.</P>
<P>In Gray v. Netherland, 64 U.S.L.W. 4531 (June 20, 1996)       (5-4), the
Court held that a death row inmate was not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus
based on the state's failure to provide him with adequate notice of the evidence
it intended to use at the penalty phase of his trial.  Writing for the majority,
Chief Justice Rehnquist characterized the proposition that due process requires
adequate notice in these circumstances as a &quot;new rule&quot; of law that
could not be applied for the first time in a habeas proceeding.  The majority
also concluded that the record was inadequate to determine whether Gray's claim
that the state had misrepresented the evidence it intended to rely on during the
penalty phase was adequately preserved.  On this latter issue, therefore, the
case was remanded for further proceedings.  Justice Ginsburg's dissent rejected
the majority's effort to bifurcate Gray's due process claim.  She further argued
that &quot;[t]here is nothing 'new' in a rule that capital defendants must be
afforded a meaningful opportunity to defend against the state's penalty phase
evidence.&quot;  Id. at 4540.</P>
<P>In Felker v. Turpin, 64 U.S.L.W. ____ (June 28, 1996)(9-0), the Court
reviewed recently enacted provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act of 1996, which altered both the procedures and substantive standards
governing successive habeas petitions.  The Court unanimously concluded that
nothing in the Act precluded the Court from exercising its original jurisdiction
to hear habeas claims.  Thus, despite the fact that the Act eliminated the
Court's certiorari jurisdiction over certain adverse decisions by the lower
courts in successive habeas cases, the Court decided that it did not have to
reach the ultimate constitutional question of whether Congress could entirely
eliminate the Court's appellate jurisdiction over a category of cases without
violating Article III.  On the other hand, the Court held that the restrictive
substantive standards adopted by Congress in the Act for successive habeas
petitions also &quot;inform[ed the Court's] consideration of original habeas
petitions.&quot;  Id. at ____.  Applying these new restrictive standards, the
Court then denied petitioner's request for habeas relief.  The ACLU filed an
amicus brief arguing, as the Court ultimately found, that the new Act did not
deprive the Court of its original jurisdiction in habeas cases.</P>

<P>In Libretti v. United States, 64 U.S.L.W. 4005 (Nov. 7, 1995)(8-1), the
Court ruled that a federal district judge need not inquire into the factual
basis for a criminal forfeiture agreement because forfeiture relates to
sentencing rather than guilt and Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f) is therefore inapplicable. 
The Court similarly ruled that a defendant could waive his statutory right to a
jury determination on the forfeiture issues under Fed.R.Crim.P. 31(e) by
entering a guilty plea even if the plea agreement did specifically refer to the
jury trial right.  In reaching this conclusion, six justices of the Court
rejected the argument that the Sixth Amendment would require a jury trial on
forfeiture even in the absence of a statute.</P>
<P>In Bailey v. U.S., 64 U.S.L.W. 4039 (Dec. 6, 1995)(9-0), a unanimous Court
held that mere possession of a gun is not enough to trigger the enhanced
penalties provided in 18 U.S.C. &#167;924(c)(1) for any person who &quot;uses or
carries a firearm&quot; while committing a &quot;crime of violence or drug
trafficking crime.&quot;  Rather, the government must show that the gun was &quot;actively
employed&quot; by the defendant.  This showing, however, can be made in a
variety of ways.  As Justice O'Connor explained:  &quot;The active-employment
understanding of 'use' certainly includes brandishing, displaying, bartering,
striking with, and most obviously, firing or attempting to fire, a firearm.&quot;

<P>In Neal v. United States, 64 U.S.L.W. 4077 (Jan. 22, 1996) (9-0), the Court

LSD crimes, could not reduce the mandatory minimum established by Congress.  The
Court's opinion also stressed the importance of stare decisis in statutory

<P>In Koon v. United States, 64 U.S.L.W. 4512 (June 13, 1996) (9-0), the Court
unanimously ordered a review of the sentence imposed on the two police
defendants in this well-publicized case.  The Court also unanimously ruled that
the district court's decision to give the defendants a shorter sentence than the
federal sentencing guidelines would normally provide was subject to review under
an abuse of discretion standard rather than the de novo review that the Ninth
Circuit applied in this case.  The case was nevertheless remanded for
resentencing since all nine justices agreed that at least some of the factors
relied on by the district court for its &quot;downward departure&quot; were an
abuse of discretion (although they disagreed on which ones).  </P>
<P>In Melendez v. United States, 64 U.S.L.W. 4525 (June 17, 1996)(7-2), the
Court held that a district judge can impose a sentence below the statutory
minimum only with the prosecutor's consent under 18 U.S.C. &#167;3553(e), and
that a motion by federal prosecutors to impose a lower sentence than the
Sentencing Guidelines would normally require is not sufficient to waive the

deadline stipulated in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c).  The dissent
argued that a district judge always has &quot;inherent authority&quot; to
prevent the conviction of an innocent defendant.  The majority, however,
rejected the contention that a district court's inherent authority allowed it to
disregard an unambiguous federal rule, at least in the circumstances of this

been forfeited after her husband, who jointly owned the car, had used it to

state may seize property used for illegal purposes (so long as it has not been
stolen) even if the owner was unaware of the manner in which the property was

authority&quot; to deny an alleged drug dealer the right to participate in a
civil forfeiture proceeding (and thus uphold the government's right to seize the
property) merely because the alleged drug dealer is a fugitive from parallel
criminal proceedings.  At the same time, the Court reserved judgment on whether
the legislature could accomplish the same result through a properly drawn

suggested that the notion of associational was appropriate only in equitable
cases and not when individual damages were sought.  Nevertheless, the Court
concluded that this limitation on associational standing was a judicially
created prudential rule that was not mandated by Article III.  Thus, it could be
overridden by Congress.</P>
<P>In Quackenbush v. Allstate Insurance Co., 64 U.S.L.W. 4379 (June 3,
1996)(9-0), a unanimous Court ruled that a district order remanding an
arbitration case to state court on abstention grounds is appealable under the
collateral order doctrine (even though most remand orders are non-appealable). 
On the merits, the Court then ruled that abstention has different consequences
in an action for damages than in an action for injunctive relief.  In the latter
case, it may justify dismissal of the federal court proceeding; in the former
instance, it can at most justify a stay of the federal court proceedings.  Since
this was a damages action, dismissal was therefore inappropriate.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>Brief Of Respondents Warner Jackson Et Al.
</p>

<p>Statement Of The Issues
</p>


<p>	In this brief, the Jackson Respondents address the two issues that they raised in their complaint filed in the Dane County Circuit Court:
</p>
<p>I.	Does the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, as expanded by the 1995-96 Budget Act (&quot;the Amended Choice Program&quot;), violate Article I, sec. 18, of the Wisconsin Constitution by providing state funds to support religious education?
</p>
<p>II.	Does the use of state funds to support religious schools under the Amended Choice Program violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution?
</p>
<p>In addition, the Respondents address the following issue that the Court has asked the parties to discuss:
</p>
<p>III.	Does the Amended Choice Program violate Article X of the Wisconsin Constitution by establishing a competing system of publicly funded schools whose educational program includes sectarian instruction?
</p>

<h3> 	INTRODUCTION
</h3>
<p>	&quot;...nor shall any money be drawn from the treasury for the benefit of religious societies, or religious or theological seminaries.&quot;  Wis. Const. Article I, sec. 18.
</p>
<p>	With this declaration, the framers of the Wisconsin Constitution and the people of this state who ratified it sought to ensure that public funds would not be used to support religious education.  This fundamental constitutional principle reflects not a hostility to religion or religious education, but a recognition that religious liberty is threatened when the government pays for religious activities.  This same elemental principle is also reflected in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
</p>
<p>	The principal issue in this case is whether the dramatically expanded Milwaukee Parental Choice Program violates Article I, sec. 18, and the First Amendment by providing state funds directly to religious schools.  The new Program effectively transfers taxpayer dollars directly from the state to Protestant, Jewish, Catholic and Muslim schools to support not just secular education but the full range of religious activities at the schools.
</p>
<p>	The Jackson Respondents are concerned citizens, parents and members of the clergy from diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds.  Many of them have children in the Milwaukee public schools.  All are taxpayers in the State of Wisconsin.  They oppose the state's use of public funds, derived in part from their taxes, to pay for religious school tuition and for education that promotes particular religious beliefs.
</p>
<p>	The Court now has received four briefs supporting the Amended Choice Program -- one from the Governor's special counsel on behalf of the State of Wisconsin, one from the Attorney General, and one each from intervenors Parents for School Choice and Marquelle Miller.  Although they differ in emphasis, the briefs share a number of themes:
</p>
<p>     -	The defenders of the Choice Program insist that the expanded Choice Program does not provide direct payments to religious schools.  That argument may charitably be described as wishful thinking.  Under the statute, parents must &quot;restrictively endorse the [Choice Program] check for the use of the private school.&quot;   Sec. 119.23(4), Stats.  When a religious school deposits the Choice Program checks that parents have endorsed for its use, funds will be transferred directly from the state treasury to the school's bank account.  As one of the amicus briefs has succinctly observed, &quot;Any suggestion that this benefit is not provided directly to religious institutions requires a deliberate suspension of disbelief.&quot; 
</p>
<p>     -	 The Program's supporters also insist that any benefits to religious schools will be attenuated and incidental.  &quot;[P]arents and families,&quot; they say, are the &quot;real beneficiaries&quot; of the Program.  Brief of Additional Parties Marquelle Miller et al. (&quot;Miller Intervenors' Brief&quot;), p. 43.  There is no question, of course, that parents and children receive a benefit under the Choice Program.  That does not mean, however, that the schools do not receive very real and substantial benefits.  If the Amended Choice Program is implemented, the participating religious schools likely will receive millions of dollars in state funds.  That is not an &quot;attenuated&quot; or &quot;incidental&quot; benefit by any stretch of the imagination.
</p>
<p>	All of the Choice Program supporters' briefs, moreover, ignore a key fact that bears directly on the question of whether participating schools receive only an &quot;incidental&quot; benefit from the Amended Choice Program.  State aid payments to participating schools under the Program are not limited to the actual tuition charged by the schools.  A majority of participating religious schools will receive more from the state than they would from the parents if the parents paid the tuition from their own funds.  See Agreed Upon Statement of Facts,  30.  Even if tuition payments could be characterized as a mere incidental benefit to a school, payments in excess of tuition indisputably provide a direct and substantial benefit to the schools and, in the case of religious schools, to the religious organizations that sponsor them.
</p>
<p>     -	The Choice proponents draw on various elements of several U.S. Supreme Court decisions to buttress their claim that the Program does not violate the Establishment Clause.  Yet not a single one of the cases on which they rely involved a program that remotely resembles the Choice Program.  At most, the state and the intervenors can offer only their prediction that the U.S. Supreme Court would overrule Committee for Public Education &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756 (1973), and uphold the Choice Program.  Yet the Court has never questioned its holding in Nyquist and relied on it quite recently in Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village Sch. Dist. v. Grumet, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 2487 (1994).
</p>
<p>	This case is not about the quality of education provided by the Milwaukee Public Schools or whether the Choice Program is good public policy.  Nor is it about the value of religious education.  Rather, the dispositive issue is whether state funds can be used to pay for education at religious schools.  Because the religion clauses of both the state and federal constitutions and the uniformity clause of the state constitution prohibit this massive funding of religious education, this Court should declare the Amended Choice Program unconstitutional.
</p>
<h3> 	FACTS
</h3>
<p>	For the reasons discussed in the accompanying Motion to Strike and in accordance with the Court's August 17, 1995 order directing the parties to prepare an Agreed Upon Statement of Facts, the Respondents' discussion of the facts is limited to those facts included in the Agreed Upon Statement of Facts filed with the Court and facts as to which the Court may take judicial notice.
</p>
<p>The Original Choice Program.  In the spring of 1990, the Wisconsin Legislature created the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program (the &quot;Choice Program&quot;), which is codified at section 119.23, Stats.  The Original Choice Program provided that &quot;any pupil in grades kindergarten to 12 who resides within the city [of Milwaukee] may attend, at no charge, any nonsectarian private school located in the city,&quot; as long as certain requirements were met.  See Sec. 119.23(2)(a), Stats. (1993-94) (emphasis added).
</p>
<p>	From 1990 to 1994, the Choice Program was open to 1% of the membership of the Milwaukee Public School district.  For the 1994-95 school year, that percentage was raised to 1.5% -- approximately 1,460 students.  See Sec. 119.23(2)(b)1., Stats. (1993-94); Agreed Upon Statement of Facts,  8.  To take part in the program, a student's family income cannot exceed 1.75 times the federal poverty level.  See Sec. 119.23(2)(a)1., Stats.  As originally enacted, no more than 49% of a private school's total enrollment could consist of pupils attending under the Choice Program.  See Sec. 119.23(2)(b)2., Stats. (1989-90).  That percentage was increased to 65 percent by 1993 Wis. Act 16, sec. 2300.
</p>
<p>	Under the Original Choice Program, the Superintendent paid participating private schools an amount equal to the per-pupil student aid provided to the Milwaukee public schools.  See Sec. 119.23(4), Stats. (1993-94).  For the 1994-95 school year, that amount was approximately $3,209.  See Agreed Upon Statement of Facts,  10.   The moneys disbursed under the Choice Program are appropriated from general purpose revenues, see secs. 20.005(3)(fu) and 119.23(4), Stats., which consist primarily of general taxes collected by the state.  See sec. 20.001, Stats.
</p>
<p>The Amended Choice Program.  The 1995-96 Budget Act, 1995 Wis. Act 27, which Governor Thompson signed into law July 26, 1995, substantially expanded the Choice Program.  Most significantly, the Act eliminated the prohibition on participation by religious schools in the Choice Program:
</p>
<p>		SECTION 4002.  119.23(2)(a)(intro.), 2. and 3. of the statutes are amended to read:
</p>
<p>		119.23(2)(a)(intro.) Subject to par. (b), beginning in the 1990-91 school year, any pupil in grades kindergarten to 12 who resides within the city may attend, at no charge, any nonsectarian private school located in the city if all of the following apply: ...
</p>
<p>1995 Wis. Act 27, sec. 4002, amending sec. 119.23(2)(a), Stats.
</p>
<p>	In addition, the Budget Act also enlarged the number of students who can participate in the Choice Program.  As many as 7% of the Milwaukee school district's pupil population would have been able to participate in the Program during the 1995-96 school year, and up to 15 percent of the student population will be eligible beginning in 1996-97.  See id., sec. 4003, repealing and recreating sec. 119.23(2)(b), Stats.  Based on the 1995-96 Milwaukee School District estimated pupil population of 98,370 students (see Agreed Upon Statement of Facts,  12), nearly 7,000 students could have participated in the expanded Choice Program in the 1995-96 school year, with up to 15,000 students potentially taking part in later years.  The Act also repealed the restriction in the Original Program limiting a private school's enrollment to 65 percent Choice Program students.  See 1995 Wis. Act 27, sec. 4003.
</p>
<p>	The Budget Act amended the method by which the State Superintendent pays tuition to private schools participating in the Choice Program.  Rather than making the check payable to the school as under the Original Program, the Superintendent will now make checks payable to the pupil's parent or guardian.  The checks are sent not to the parents, however, but directly to the private school.  The parents then must &quot;restrictively endorse the check for the use of the private school&quot;:
</p>
<p>		SECTION 4006m.  119.23(4) of the statutes is amended to read:
</p>
<p>		119.23 (4) Upon receipt from the pupil's parent or guardian of proof of the pupil's enrollment in the private school, the state superintendent shall pay to the private school parent or guardian, from the appropriation under s. 20.255 (2) (fu), an amount equal to the total amount to which the school district is entitled under s. 121.08 divided by the school district membership, or an amount equal to the private school's operating and debt service cost per pupil that is related to educational programming, as determined by the department, whichever is less.  The state superintendent shall pay 25% of the total amount in September, 25% in November, 25% in February and 25% in May.  The department shall send the check to the private school.  The parent or guardian shall restrictively endorse the check for the use of the private school.
</p>
<p>1995 Wis. Act 27, sec. 4006m, amending sec. 119.23(4), Stats.
</p>
<p>	There are no limitations on how private schools, including religious schools, may use the funds they receive under the Choice Program.  The funds may be used to support all of the educational functions of the school, including religious education, and they may be used to maintain, repair or construct facilities, including facilities used for religious purposes.  See Agreed Upon Statement of Facts,  28.  As under the Original program, funds paid to schools under the Amended Choice Program are drawn from general purpose revenues.  See sec. 119.23(4), Stats., as amended by 1995 Wis. Act 27, sec. 4006m.
</p>
<p>	The amount of money a school will receive under the Amended Choice Program is not predetermined.  Participating schools will receive the lesser of the amount of per-pupil state aid to the Milwaukee public schools under sec. 121.08, Stats., or &quot;an amount equal to the private school's operating and debt service cost per pupil that is related to educational programming, as determined by the department.&quot;  Id.  The per-pupil state aid provided to MPS under sec. 121.08 for the 1995-96 school year is approximately $3,667.  See Agreed Upon Statement of Facts,  29.
</p>
<p>	Under the Amended Choice Program, participating schools must allow students to opt-out of &quot;religious activities.&quot;  The amended statute provides that:
</p>
<p>	A private school may not require a pupil attending the private school under this section to participate in any religious activity if the pupil's parent or guardian submits to the pupil's teacher or the private school's principal a written request that the pupil be exempt from such activities.
</p>
<p>Sec. 119.23(7)(c), Stats., created by 1995 Act 27, sec. 4008.  Students attending a religious school under the Choice Program who have not opted-out may participate, at state expense, in the full-range of religious activities offered by the school.
</p>
<p>The Participating Schools.  There are 122 private schools in the city of Milwaukee that would have been eligible to participate in the Amended Choice Program during the 1995-96 school year.  See Agreed Upon Statement of Facts,  24.  Of those, 89 are sectarian and 33 are nonsectarian.  Id.,  25.  Approximately 84 percent of the pupils who attended private schools during the 1994-95 school year attended religious schools.  Id.,  26.
</p>
<p>	The parties have provided the Court, as part of the Agreed Upon Statement of Facts, the mission statements and other written materials prepared by many of the religious schools that notified the Superintendent of Public Instruction of their intent to participate in the Amended Choice Program during the 1995-96 school year.  Id.,  27, Exhibit E.  Those materials make clear that religion is a pervasive part of each student's educational experience at these schools.  The participating schools announce forthrightly that their mission is religious and that religious doctrine will be instilled in their students:
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;Oklahoma Avenue Lutheran School is an integral part of the ministry of Oklahoma Avenue Lutheran Church.&quot;  Exhibit E to Agreed Upon Statement of Facts, p. 535.
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;The mission of St. Leo and St. Rose Catholic schools is to share in the parish evangelization effort through providing quality Catholic education in grades pre-kindergarten through eight.&quot;  Id. at 720.
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;The continuing purpose of St. Matthew Ev. Lutheran Church and School is to go and tell the pure Gospel of Jesus Christ for the conversion of unbelievers and the strengthening of believers in faith and Christian living.&quot;  Id. at 750.
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;St. Paul's Lutheran School exists to:
		-assist parents in training children in God's ways,
		-teach God's Word to children, and
		-make disciples of children.&quot;  Id. at 790.
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;We believe our school exists to carry out the Savior's command to `go and make disciples&quot; (Matthew 28:19).  Consequently, our school's primary reason for existence is to be a tool for bringing young souls to faith in Jesus....&quot;  Id. at 275 (Fairview Lutheran School).
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;A prospective student whose parents are not members of a church will be considered as mission prospects.  Christ Lutheran Church/School considers it a responsibility to teach the Word of God to those who have not heard this blessed Word.&quot;  Id. at 198.
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;The objectives of the [Clara Muhammad School] are:
	1.	To foster within each student the principle of submissions to the will of Allah (God) as the essential element in achieving human excellence.&quot; Id. at 227.
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;Holy Redeemer Christian Academy is an integral part of the ministry of Holy Redeemer Church of God in Christ.&quot;  Id. at 399.
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;As a Catholic high school, [Divine Savior Holy Angels High School] is dedicated to promoting the beliefs and traditions of the Catholic Church.&quot;  Id. at 234.
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;The Yeshiva Elementary School of Milwaukee was initiated by members of the Orthodox Jewish Community with the following objectives as their goals:  
</p>
<p>	To teach elementary school children Torah and Mitzvos in accordance with the ideals and aspirations of Torah as espoused by the G'Dolei Yisroel in order to provide the excellence in Orthodox Jewish Education which will prepare our children to attend the finest seminaries, Yeshivas and institutions of Jewish higher learning.&quot;  Id. at 966.
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;The function of St. Bernadette Day School is to provide for Christian individuals opportunities for growth in faith, for formation, for development.&quot;  Id. at 614.
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;First and foremost Garden Homes Lutheran Church conducts and maintains a Christian elementary school to assist Christian parents in the training and nurturing of their children in the Word of God.&quot;  Id. at 316.
</p>
<p>	As the schools' literature emphasizes, one of the primary means by which these schools accomplish their religious missions is by integrating the religious and secular aspects of the schools' educational programs.
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;In keeping with the purpose of our school, our curriculum is taught in the setting of God's Word.  Religion is not only taught as a subject, but our teachers have been trained to integrate God's Word across the curriculum. ...  Our curriculum offerings place Christ as the focal point for all study.&quot;  Id. at 414, 417 (The Lutheran Chapel of The Cross Church and School).
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;Each class is taught by a dedicated Christian teacher who believes in Biblical concepts of salvation.  Teachers strive to build into the curriculum a philosophy of Christian living that includes moral and spiritual values.&quot;  Id. at 471 (Milwaukee Junior Academy (Seventh-day Adventist)).
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;Emmaus Lutheran Church and School is a Christian institution, NOT a private school.  The Holy Gospel is the center of our curriculum.&quot;  Id. at 259.
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;[E]verything that confronts the child in the educational program offered by St. Matthew Ev. Lutheran School will be presented in the light of His inspired, inerrant word of truth and power.&quot;  Id. at 750.
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;The children will be thoroughly trained in the fundamental subject areas needed for a successful life here on this earth.  It is our aim that these subjects be taught in accordance to Scripture and that all things related to the children's educational life be permeated with God's Word.&quot;  Id. at 792 (St. Paul's Lutheran School).
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;Christian teachings are fostered in all classes, but especially in the religion program.&quot;  Id. at 106 (All Saints Catholic Elementary School).
</p>
<p>   *	At St. Veronica Catholic Elementary School, &quot;Christian-Centered Education&quot; means &quot;Integrating Catholic faith in all academic areas.&quot;  Id. at 841.
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;The students of St. Alexander's are not only taught the basic truths of their religion; they are also exposed to the Christian attitudes and ideologies which pervade their school environment.&quot;  Id. at 553.
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;The message of Jesus is taught in religion classes and other curricular areas. ... Because of the nature of a Catholic school, religion is taught daily as part of the curriculum.  Catholic values are also incorporated into all other aspects of the curriculum.&quot;  Id. at 614, 617 (St. Bernadette School).  
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;The Bible forms the core and center upon which all instruction is based.  Each day is opened with a devotion followed by instruction in Christian doctrine and Bible study.  Our school gives due instruction in all branches of academics, which are required by the State of Wisconsin.  All subjects are taught by a Christian teacher in the light of God's Word, emphasizing God's love for all men through Jesus.&quot;  Id. at 131 (Bethlehem Lutheran School).
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;All subject areas in our school are Christ-centered.&quot;  Id. at 323 (Gospel Lutheran School).
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;We Believe...that the Christian School, where every subject is taught from the Christian point of view, related to the teachings of Christianity and permeated with the spirit of Christianity, can be more successful in leading children to a vital Christian life than any other agency, except the Christian home.&quot;  Id. at 534 (Oklahoma Avenue Lutheran School).
</p>
<p>   *	&quot;We teach all the traditional subjects, but we teach them differently--from a Christian perspective.&quot;  Id. at 526 (Mount Olive Lutheran School).
</p>
<p>	As noted above, the Amended Choice Program pays participating schools the lesser of the schools' per-pupil costs or the amount of the per-pupil state aid provided to MPS under sec. 121.08, Stats., which in the 1995-96 school year is approximately $3,667.  See Agreed Upon Statement of Facts,  29.  The tuition charged by a majority of the religious schools that have applied to participate in the Amended Choice Program, however, is less than either of those amounts.  See id.,  30.  As a result, a majority of the participating religious schools will receive more money from the state for each participating pupil than they charge in tuition.  
</p>
<p>	Holy Cross School, for example, charges tuition of $1,475, while its &quot;actual cost of education&quot; is $2,446 per student.  See id., Exhibit E, p. 388.  Emmaus Lutheran School charges $1,080 tuition to church members and $1,350 nonmembers, though its annual expenditures exceed $2,000 per pupil.  Id. at 261.  Mother of Good Counsel School reports that its tuition ($1,370 for parish members, $1,940 for nonmembers) &quot;covers just half the cost of educating MGC students.&quot;  Id. at 489, 497.  Mount Olive Lutheran School states that the tuition charged even to non-members is &quot;substantially less than our per pupil cost.&quot;  Id. at 526.
</p>
<p>	Many religious schools depend on subsidies from their sponsoring churches to make up the difference between tuition and operating expenses.  Bethlehem Lutheran School, for example, reports that &quot;Bethlehem Lutheran Church subsidizes nearly 50% of the cost per student.&quot;  Id. at 130.  Mount Olive Lutheran School states that &quot;Mount Olive Congregation provides the major support since the focus of our school is Christian education.&quot;  Id. at 526.  St. Catherine School says that it &quot;is partially subsidized by the parish at large.&quot;  Id. at 663.   Because the Amended Choice Program pays schools more than what they charge in tuition, the Program relieves the churches that sponsor the schools of at least part of the cost of subsidizing the difference between tuition received and the actual cost of education.
</p>

<h3>	ARGUMENT
</h3>
<p>I.	THE AMENDED CHOICE PROGRAM VIOLATES ARTICLE I, SECTION 18, OF THE WISCONSIN CONSTITUTION.
</p>
<p>	Long before the United States Supreme Court held that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment is binding on the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court recognized that Article I, sec. 18, of the Wisconsin Constitution prohibits &quot;the drawing of any money from the state treasury for the benefit of any religious school.&quot;  State ex rel. Weiss v. District Bd., 76 Wis. 177, 215, 44 N.W. 967 (1890).  Even after the states were required to adhere to Establishment Clause dictates, this Court continued to apply Article I, sec. 18, independently and more strictly than its federal counterpart, particularly when public funding of religious education is at issue.  Indeed, this Court need not even reach the Establishment Clause issues in this case because Article I, sec. 18, of the Wisconsin Constitution provides an independent basis for deciding the case.
</p>
<p>	Two of section 18's four clauses are at issue here.   The &quot;benefits&quot; clause (&quot;nor shall any money be drawn from the treasury for the benefit of religious societies, or religious or theological seminaries&quot;) has been discussed extensively in the Choice supporters' briefs and will be discussed first here.  The &quot;compelled support&quot; clause (&quot;nor shall any person be compelled to attend, erect or support any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry, without consent&quot;), though not addressed in any of those briefs, provides an additional ground for concluding that the Amended Choice Program violates Article I, sec. 18, of the Wisconsin Constitution. 
</p>
<h4>		A.	The Amended Choice Program violates the benefits clause of Article I, sec. 18.
</h4>
<p>	As early as its 1890 decision in Weiss, this Court determined that the framers of the Wisconsin Constitution intended Article I, sec. 18, to establish a strict separation of church and state.  In Weiss, Roman Catholic parents objected to the reading of a Protestant Bible in the Edgerton public schools.  The Court said that the history of the Wisconsin Constitution requires that Article I, sec. 18, be construed to provide a particularly rigorous separation of church and state:  &quot;Wisconsin, as one of the later states admitted into the Union, having before it the experience of others, and probably in view of its heterogeneous population, ... probably furnished a more complete bar to any preference for, or discrimination against, any religious sect, organization, or society than any other state in the Union.&quot;  76 Wis. at 207-08.  
</p>
<p>	The Weiss Court held that religious instruction in a public school rendered the school a &quot;religious seminary&quot; as that term is used in Article I, sec. 18.  Id. at 215.   Because the school district received state funds to support the school, the Court concluded that Article I, sec. 18, was violated by the use of treasury funds to benefit that &quot;religious seminary.&quot;  Id. 
</p>
<p>	The first modern case to consider whether the use of public funds to benefit religious organizations violates the Wisconsin Constitution, State ex rel. Reynolds v. Nusbaum, 17 Wis. 2d 148, 115 N.W.2d 761 (1962), is also the Wisconsin case most similar to this action.  At issue in Reynolds was a statute that required school boards to provide private school students with free transportation to and from the nearest public school.  Fifteen years earlier, in Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1 (1947), the U.S. Supreme Court had held that a New Jersey law permitting parental reimbursement for the cost of children's bus transportation to parochial schools did not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  Citing its earlier decision in Weiss, the Court held that Art. I, sec. 18, mandates a more rigid separation of church and state than the First Amendment, especially when the expenditure of public funds is involved.  &quot;[W]e deem that the First amendment provision, which prohibits laws `respecting an establishment of religion,' lends itself to more flexibility of interpretation than the provision contained in the last clause of sec. 18, art. I of the Wisconsin constitution.&quot;  17 Wis. 2d at 165.
</p>
<p>	The Court's analysis of the benefits clause in Reynolds establishes the framework for analyzing the constitutionality of the Amended Choice Program.  The Court first held that elementary and secondary schools operated by religious organizations are &quot;religious seminaries&quot; within the meaning of the clause:
</p>
<p>		We construe &quot;religious societies&quot; to be synonymous with religious organizations, and, under the stipulated facts, practically all of the nonpublic schools, whose pupils are to be transported under the attacked act, are operated by religious organizations.  Furthermore, at the time of the adoption of our constitution in 1848, the word &quot;seminaries&quot; was synonymous with academies or schools. ...  Therefore, inasmuch as some religious instruction is given in all of the approximately 500 nonpublic schools operated by religious organizations or sectarian groups, ... these parochial schools constitute &quot;religious seminaries&quot; within the meaning of sec. 18, art. I, Wisconsin constitution.
</p>
<p>Id. at 156.  The Court next held that providing transportation to parochial school students is a benefit to the parochial schools themselves:
</p>
<p>	[I]t is fair to assume that a considerable number of pupils attending these schools will be afforded transportation under the new act if its validity is upheld.  Those parochial schools, which now pay part or all of the cost of transportation of their pupils out of their school funds, stand to benefit financially by the operation of the new act.  Others stand to gain through increased enrollment.  Such an increase of enrollment is a benefit to these parochial schools.
</p>
<p>Id. (emphasis added).
</p>
<p>	The Court concluded that these benefits to parochial schools are impermissible under Article I, sec. 18.  It did not matter, the Court said, that parochial school pupils were provided transportation only to the nearest public school.  Id. at 163.  Nor did it matter that the legislature's declared purpose was to promote the safety and welfare of the students.  &quot;It could also be argued with equal plausibility that a direct grant in aid of public funds to parochial schools promotes the general welfare of the pupils of such schools because it aids in their education.&quot;  Id. at 160.
</p>
<p>	The Court also rejected the argument that providing transportation to parochial school students was constitutional because it &quot;entails no more expenditure of public funds than would be required if these pupils were to attend public school.&quot;  Id. at 160.
</p>
<p> 	[T]his same argument would sustain the use of public funds to pay salaries of parochial school teachers or other direct operating expenses of such schools.  Considering the objective sought by the framers of our state constitution in including the provisions of sec 18, art. I, we are certain that the determination of whether religious schools receive a benefit from public funds is not dependent on whether the overall cost to the public treasury would be less or greater by reason of the operation of such schools than would be the case if all the pupils thereof were to attend public schools.
</p>
<p>Id. at 160 (emphasis added).  
</p>
<p>	Under the Amended Choice Program, public funds will go directly to religious schools.  While the check from the state is made payable to the parent, the Superintendent of Public Instruction must, by law, send the check to the school, and the parent must, by law, &quot;restrictively endorse the check for the use of the private school.&quot;  Sec. 119.23(4), Stats., as amended by 1995 Wis. Act 27, sec. 4006m.  Once received by the school, the money may be used for any purpose, including purposes specifically forbidden by Reynolds such as teachers salaries and operating expenses.  The school also may use state funds for capital improvements such as renovating or building offices, classrooms or chapels.  See Agreed Upon Statement of Facts,  28. 
</p>
<p>	The Choice proponents assert that the Amended Choice Program provides a direct benefit only to parents and that the benefits to the religious schools are only &quot;indirect and incidental.&quot;  See, e.g., Governor's Brief at 31.  State payment of private school tuition undoubtedly does provide a significant benefit to parents.  It does not follow, however, that those payments do not also provide a direct and substantial benefit to the schools.  As Reynolds illustrates, a state program that provides direct benefits to parents and students may also provide an impermissible benefit to schools as well.  When a program will provide millions of dollars to private schools, it is difficult to understand how that program can be said to provide only an &quot;indirect and incidental&quot; benefit to those schools. 
</p>
<p>	Furthermore, state payments to participating religious schools under the Amended Choice Program are not limited to the tuition actually charged by the schools.  The parties have stipulated that the tuition charged by a majority of the religious schools is less than the amount of state payment they would receive under the Amended Choice Program.  See Agreed Upon Statement of Facts,  30.  Most religious schools participating in the Choice Program will receive more from the state under the Program than they would receive from the students' parents if the parents paid tuition from their own funds.
<p>	
	The primary beneficiaries of state payments that exceed tuition are not the parents -- payment of the tuition alone would allow their children to receive a private school education.  Every dollar paid by the state to a participating school that exceeds the actual tuition charged by that school provides a direct and substantial benefit to the school and, in the case of a religious school,  to the religious organization that sponsors it.  Even if it were possible to characterize the tuition portion of state aid as only an &quot;indirect and incidental&quot; benefit to a school, it is impossible to characterize payments in excess of tuition as anything but a direct and substantial benefit to the school.
</p>
<p>	The Choice supporters also argue that state funds will flow to religious schools only as a result of parents' decision to send their children to those schools.  See Governor's Brief at 32.  But that was also the case in Reynolds -- the religious schools there benefited from taxpayer-funded busing only as a result of parents' decisions to send their children to religious schools.  That fact had no bearing on the Court's decision that the busing program provided an impermissible benefit to the schools under Article I, sec. 18.
</p>
<p>	That rationale, moreover, would justify any state aid program to religious organizations that based the amount of aid on the number of the organization's members.  Under such a program, state aid would flow to the organization only as a result of individuals' choices to join the organization.  Yet surely the Choice proponents do not contend that the state may make per-capita grants to churches simply because funds would be provided to the churches only as a result of such individual choices.
</p>
<p>	The Governor also contends that another parental choice is interposed between the state and religious schools -- &quot;the school gets nothing,&quot; he argues, &quot;until the parent decides to endorse the check.&quot;  Governor's Brief at 21, 32.  The implication is that the parent is free to decide whether to endorse the check to the school or to use the funds for other purposes.  The Amended Choice Program gives parents no such choice.  By law, the parent &quot;shall restrictively endorse the check for the use of the private school.&quot;  Sec. 119.23(4), Stats., as amended by 1995 Wis. Act 27, sec. 4006m (emphasis added).
</p>
<p>	The fact that state funds will flow to religious schools only because parents have chosen to send their children to those schools is wholly irrelevant under Article I, sec. 18.  Under the Amended Choice Program, state treasury funds will be used to benefit religious schools in a manner that cannot reasonably be described as merely incidental.  For that reason, the Amended Choice Program violates the benefits clause of Article I, sec. 18, of the Wisconsin Constitution.
</p>
<h4>	B.	The Amended Choice Program is unconstitutional under this Court's long line of post-Reynolds cases.
</h4>
<p>	Reynolds was not this Court's last word on the benefits clause of Article I, sec. 18.  Nothing in those later cases undermines Reynolds' validity, however, or provides any basis for upholding the Amended Choice Program.
</p>
<p>	In State ex rel. Warren v. Reuter, 44 Wis. 2d 201, 170 N.W.2d 790 (1969), the Court upheld a state appropriation to the Marquette School of Medicine.  The Court found that the medical school was an independent nonsectarian institution that was no longer under the control of Marquette University.  Id. at 224-25.  The Court rejected the argument that the appropriation nevertheless violated Article I, sec. 18, because Marquette University, a Catholic institution, derived some incidental benefits through its joint programs with the medical school.  Reynolds did not prohibit such incidental benefits to religious schools, the Court said -- it prohibited legislation whose primary effect is the advancement of religion.  Id. at 226-27.  The Court contrasted the case with the private school transportation aid at issue in Reynolds, where &quot;the primary effect was a benefit to private schools....&quot;  Id. at 227.
</p>
<p>	Three years later, the Court struck down a law providing state funds to pay tuition at the Marquette University dental school.  State ex rel. Warren v. Nusbaum, 55 Wis. 2d 316, 198 N.W.2d 650 (1972) (&quot;Nusbaum I&quot;).  The Court held that the state aid violated the federal Establishment Clause because there was a possibility that the funds would be used for the university's operating costs other than those of the dental school, and that any program that violated the Establishment Clause necessarily violated Article I, sec. 18, as well.  Id. at 325, 332-33.  The Court added in dictum that a &quot;proper contract&quot; which truly restricted the use of state funds to secular dental education would not violate the benefits clause because the dental school was a wholly secular unit of the university and the university as a whole would derive only an incidental benefit from such a contract.  Id. at 333-35.
</p>
<p>	The Amended Choice Program presents an even more compelling violation of Article I, sec. 18, than the funding at issue in Nusbaum I.  The state funding in Nusbaum I was directed at a purely secular program within a religious institution, but was unconstitutional nevertheless because the funds might be used for religious purposes.  Under the Choice Program, in contrast, there is not even an attempt to direct state funds towards secular education.  To the contrary, it is undisputed that state funds will be used for religious as well as secular education.  Indeed, any attempt to limit Choice Program funds to secular education would effectively bar virtually all parochial schools from participating in the Program because their secular and religious programs are inextricably intertwined. 
</p>
<p>	In State ex rel. Warren v. Nusbaum, 64 Wis. 2d 314, 219 N.W.2d 577 (1974) (&quot;Nusbaum II&quot;), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a law that required school districts to contract with private special educational institutions to provide services to children with exceptional needs if those services were not available from public agencies.  Under that law, the governing board, faculty, student body and teachings of the private special education service could not be &quot;chosen or determined by any religious organization or for any sectarian purpose.&quot;  Id. at 321.  Given that limitation, the Court held that the primary effect of the legislation was not to benefit religious organizations.  Id. at 325-26.
</p>
<p>	The Governor contends the Amended Choice Program &quot;is even more clearly constitutional than the neutral contract approved in Nusbaum II, which involved direct aid to religious organizations.&quot;  Governor's Brief at 55.  But the Court in Nusbaum II upheld the contracts precisely because they did not involve aid to religious education.  64 Wis. 2d at 325-26.  It emphasized that under the challenged statute, &quot;the legislature has gone to great lengths to insure that the inculcation of religious tenets shall not take place.&quot;  Id. at 325.  The Court pointed out that any contract with an entity whose governing board or faculty was controlled by a religious organization would be &quot;challengeable in a later action under the statute and the constitutional amendments.&quot;  Id. at 326.  Nothing in the Amended Choice Program, in contrast, limits &quot;the inculcation of religious tenets&quot; by participating schools or excludes schools whose governing boards and faculties are &quot;chosen or determined by any religious organization or for any sectarian purpose.&quot;
</p>
<p>	The Choice supporters contend that the &quot;opt-out&quot; provision of the amended Choice Program minimizes the Program's benefit to religion.  The opt-out provision does not cure this infirmity; if anything, it makes it worse.  Newly enacted sec. 119.23(7)(c), Stats., provides that &quot;[a] private school may not require a pupil attending the private school under this section to participate in any religious activity if the pupil's parent or guardian submits ... a written request that the pupil be exempt from such activities.&quot;  The opt-out provision serves only to emphasize that students attending religious schools under the Choice Program who have not opted out of religious activities may participate in the full range of religious activities at their schools, with their tuition paid by the state. 
</p>
<p>	Nusbaum II provides a test for determining when state aid has the unconstitutional primary effect of benefitting religion for purposes of the benefits clause of Article I, sec. 18.  It is a test that none of the Choice proponents acknowledge or apply to the facts of this case:
</p>
<p>		Aid may normally be thought of as having the primary effect of advancing religion when it flows to an institution in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission or when it funds a specifically religious activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting.
</p>
<p>Id. at 325.  In a later decision, the Court explained why elementary and secondary schools operated by religious organizations meet that test:
</p>
<p>		In contrast to the ... line of decisions involving colleges and universities, the [United States Supreme] Court has generally held that elementary and secondary schools are pervasively sectarian.  The basis of this distinction is that the very purpose of many elementary and secondary schools is to provide an integrated secular and religious education.  The schools are often devoted to the inculcation of religious values.
</p>
<p>State ex rel. Wisconsin Health Facilities Authority v. Lindner, 91 Wis. 2d 145, 156-57, 280 N.W.2d 773 (1979) (citations omitted).
</p>
<p>	The religious schools that have applied to participate in the Choice Program are &quot;institution[s] in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of [their] functions are subsumed in the religious mission.&quot;  Nusbaum II, 64 Wis. 2d at 324.  Their mission statements and other literature quoted above (see supra, pp. 9-12) and reproduced in Exhibit E to the Agreed Upon Statement of Facts demonstrate beyond question that the sectarian schools participating in the Choice Program are not only religious in name, but are also pervasively religious in practice.
</p>
<p>	It is entirely appropriate, of course, for religious teachings to permeate the curriculum and activities of schools operated by religious organizations.  What is neither appropriate nor constitutional, however, is for the State of Wisconsin to provide funding for that religious education.
</p>
<h4>		C.	The Court's decision in King v. Village of Waunakee does not preclude an independent analysis of Article I, sec. 18.
</h4>
<p>	All of the Choice proponents contend that the Court's decision King v. Village of Waunakee, 185 Wis. 2d 25, 517 N.W.2d 671 (1994), marked the demise of any independent interpretation of Article I, sec. 18, by this Court.  Nothing in that case, however, altered the well-established analysis that the Court has applied to public funding issues under the benefits clause.
</p>
<p>	The issue in King was the constitutionality of a nativity scene owned by the village of Waunakee that the village displayed in a park during the holiday season.  The display cost the village about $500 a year to maintain and operate.  In a 5-2 decision, the Court held that the display did not violate the Establishment Clause or Article I, sec. 18.
</p>
<p>	The majority decision did not address the benefits clause other than to observe summarily that no money was drawn from the treasury for the benefit of any religious societies.  185 Wis. 2d at 53.  That conclusion is explained by the fact that the display was owned by the village, rather than by any religious organization.  The funds expended by the village did not relieve any religious organization of the expense of maintaining or operating the display.  The Court also characterized the village's $500 annual expenditure as de minimus.  Id. at 56.
</p>
<p>	The Choice Program, in contrast, will provide public funds to private schools operated by religious organizations.  The tens of millions of public dollars that will flow to religious schools under the Choice Program in the coming years are not de minimus by even the most generous standard.
</p>
<p>	The Choice proponents note that the Court said in King that it agreed with the court of appeals' statement that Wisconsin courts interpret Article I, sec. 18, &quot;in light of United States Supreme Court cases interpreting the Establishment Clause&quot; and that this Court had not &quot;elaborated&quot; on the statement in Reynolds that the Establishment Clause &quot;lends itself to more flexibility of interpretation&quot; than the religious benefit clause of the Wisconsin Constitution.  Id. at 55.  While this Court may not have &quot;elaborated&quot; on that statement, it twice has stated, in cases decided after Reynolds, that &quot;the additional language `nor shall any monies be drawn from the treasury for the benefit of religious societies' renders the clause more prohibitive than the First Amendment....&quot;  Lindner, 91 Wis. 2d at 163; see also Reuter, 44 Wis. 2d at 227.
</p>
<p>	In King, moreover, the Court reached its conclusion that the nativity display was constitutional &quot;even assuming that [Article I, sec. 18] may be `less flexible' than the First Amendment.&quot;  185 Wis. 2d at 54.  As the Governor's brief in opposition to the preliminary injunction motion acknowledged (at p. 30), &quot;the court's broader statements concerning the scope of the religion clauses are in some technical sense dictum.&quot;   As a recent discussion of King observed, &quot;if the court had intended to overrule Reynolds, it would not have cited Reynolds and would not have based its decision on the assumption that Reynolds continues to be valid precedent.&quot;  Gordon, &quot;How vast is King's realm?&quot;, Wisconsin Lawyer 18, 21 (Aug. 1995).
</p>
<p>	The Governor suggests that any interpretation of the benefits clause that is more prohibitive than the federal Establishment Clause &quot;would risk creating painful friction between the religious benefits clause and the federal Free Exercise Clause....&quot;  Governor's Brief at 53-54.  That fear is unfounded.  The Free Exercise Clause does not require a state to fund religious activities.  State constitutional restrictions on providing state funds to religious organizations do not conflict with any right guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause of the federal constitution.  See infra, pp. 44-50.  
</p>
<p>	The Governor, the Attorney General and the intervenors all contend that Article I, sec. 18, of the Wisconsin Constitution means nothing more and nothing less than what the United States Supreme Court declares at any given time to be the meaning of the Establishment Clause.  This Court has a long tradition, however, of interpreting Article I, sec. 18, as a vital and independent declaration of this state's commitment to religious liberty, including the explicit prohibition on state funding of religious schools.  While this Court may &quot;look to&quot; federal Establishment Clause cases for guidance in interpreting Article I, sec. 18, this Court has never said that any state funding program that is constitutional under the Establishment Clause necessarily is constitutional under the Wisconsin Constitution.
</p>
<p>	Regardless of whether the U.S. Supreme Court in some future case might find a school voucher program constitutional under the Establishment Clause, this Court must decide whether the Choice Program is constitutional under the Wisconsin Constitution.  To give effect to the plain language of the benefits clause of Article I, sec. 18, the Court should reaffirm that that language means exactly what it says -- that state treasury funds cannot be used to support religious school education because that confers an impermissible benefit on the religious schools.
</p>
<h4>	D.	The Amended Choice Program violates the compelled support clause of Article I, sec. 18.
</h4>
<p>	The second clause of Article I, sec. 18, provides that no person &quot;shall...be compelled to attend, erect or support any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry, without consent...&quot;  The Amended Choice Program violates the compelled support clause because it compels taxpayers to support places of worship and to maintain ministries without their consent.
</p>
<p>	In State ex rel. Weiss v. District Bd., supra, this Court held that Bible readings in the public schools violated the compelled support clause as well as the benefits clause.  The Court found that reading of the Bible in public schools is &quot;worship&quot; and that, as a result, the school room in which Bible readings occurred was a &quot;place of worship&quot; within the meaning of Article I, sec. 18.   Weiss, 76 Wis. at 211-13.  It rejected the school district's argument that a &quot;place of worship should be confined to some church edifice, or place where the members of a church statedly worship.&quot;  Id. at 213.
</p>
<p>	The Bible reading violated the compelled support clause because the objecting plaintiffs, as taxpayers of the school district, were &quot;compelled to aid in the erection of the school building in question, and also to aid in the support of the school maintained therein.&quot;  Id.  &quot;Being thus compelled to aid in such erection and support, they have a legal right to object to its being used as a `place of worship.'&quot;  Id.  It did not matter, the Court said, that &quot;only a small fraction of the school hours is devoted to such worship....&quot;  Id.  That &quot;in no way justifies such use as against an objecting tax-payer.&quot;  Id.  
</p>
<p>	The Amended Choice Program similarly compels taxpayers to &quot;support [a] place of worship...without consent.&quot;  Many, if not most, of the religious schools that will participate in the Choice Program include religious worship as part of their daily activities.  See, e.g., Exhibit E to Agreed Upon Statement of Facts, pp. 106, 131, 154, 332, 353, 400, 414, 508.  If a brief daily Bible reading renders a public school classroom a &quot;place of worship&quot; under Article I, sec. 18, there can be no doubt that a parochial school operated by a religious organization, in which religious and secular instruction are intertwined and daily prayer is an integral part of the educational program, is likewise a &quot;place of worship&quot; under the state constitution.  
</p>
<p>	Nor can there be any doubt that under the Amended Choice Program, tax funds will be used to &quot;support&quot; these &quot;places of worship.&quot;  The parties have stipulated that a participating religious school may use state funds received under the Choice Program &quot;for any purpose the school deems appropriate, including, among other things, the payment of salaries and expenses of employees affiliated with the school's religious mission, the purchase of literature and other materials identified with the school's religious mission, and the maintenance and construction of facilities used for religious purposes.&quot;  Agreed Upon Statement of Facts,  28.
</p>
<p>	The Amended Choice Program also runs afoul of the compelled support clause because many, if not most, of the religious schools are viewed by their sponsoring religious organization as an integral part of the organization's religious ministry.  See supra, pp. 9-11.  As a result, Wisconsin taxpayers will be &quot;compelled to ... maintain [a] ministry&quot; without their consent when their tax dollars are used to support religious schools.
</p>
<p>	The Court in Weiss explained that one of the reasons that the Wisconsin Constitution prohibits sectarian instruction in district schools is that &quot;the child of the Jew, or Catholic, or Unitarian, or Universalist, or Quaker should not be compelled to listen to the stated reading of passages of scripture which are accepted by others as giving the lie to the religious faith and belief of their parents and themselves....&quot;  76 Wis. at 198.  As the amicus brief filed by the Wisconsin Jewish Conference and the Milwaukee Jewish Council for Community Relations poignantly illustrates, that same concern explains why taxpayers cannot be compelled under the Choice Program to support religions that are hostile to their own beliefs.  Many of the Christian religious schools that have applied to participate in the Program frankly admit that their mission is to proselytize students and their families and to convert them to their faith.  This means that state taxes paid by Jewish, Muslim and other religious minority taxpayers, as well as by taxpayers who hold no religious beliefs, will fund attempts to convert children to the Christian faith.
</p>
<p>		If the challenged legislation is implemented, Wisconsin Jews and other religious minorities will see their State tax dollars used to fund core religious programs which are antithetical -- and in some cases actively hostile -- to their own most personal religious beliefs. ...
	. . . 
		Surely, few state acts could send more disturbing tremors of dj vu throughout the American Jewish community that to force that community to watch their own State tax dollars used to fund a religious school which openly announces to the State that it will use those State funds to aggressively proselytize anyone who is not a Christian.
</p>
<p>Amicus Curiae Brief of the Milwaukee Jewish Council for Community Relations and the Wisconsin Jewish Conference in Support of a Preliminary Injunction, p. 4 (emphasis in original).
</p>
<p>	Payment of state treasury funds to religious schools under the Amended Choice Program will provide substantial benefits not only to the participating schools but to the sponsoring religious organizations for which those schools constitute a vital part of their ministry.  For that reason, the Amended Choice Program violates the compelled support clause as well as the benefits clause of Article I, sec. 18, of the Wisconsin Constitution.
</p>
<h3>II.	THE CHOICE PROGRAM VIOLATES THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT.
</h3>
<p>	The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion....&quot;  Under that provision, the U.S. Supreme Court has struck down virtually every form of financial aid to parochial schools at the elementary and secondary level.  In addition to its state constitutional infirmities, the Choice Program violates the fundamental constitutional guarantee of separation of church and state created by the Establishment Clause.
</p>
<p>	The Supreme Court decisions prohibiting state aid to parochial schools are based on the pervasively sectarian nature of elementary and secondary religious schools.  Virtually every aspect of parochial education includes religious training of some kind.  It is impossible to isolate and then fund the secular activities of parochial schools without funding their religious mission as well.
</p>
<p>	The very purpose of many of these schools is to provide an integrated secular and religious education; the teaching process is, to a large extent, devoted to the inculcation of religious values and beliefs.  Substantial aid to the educational function of such schools, accordingly, necessarily results in aid to the sectarian school enterprise as a whole.  &quot;[T]he secular education those schools provide goes hand in hand with the religious mission that is the only reason for the schools' existence.  Within the institution, the two are inextricably intertwined.&quot;  
</p>
<p>Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U.S. 349, 366 (1975) (citations and footnote omitted), quoting Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 657 (1971) (opinion of Brennan, J.); accord, School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 384 (1985).
</p>
<p>	Accordingly, the Supreme Court consistently has invalidated aid programs that provide unrestricted benefits to religious schools or that help fund the instructional process.  Examples of aid programs found unconstitutional have included construction and repair grants for parochial schools, Committee for Public Education &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756 (1973); tuition reimbursement for parents, Id., Sloan v. Lemon, 413 U.S. 825 (1973); salary supplements for parochial school teachers, Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra; and instructional equipment and materials that can be used for religious purposes, Wolman v. Walter, 433 U.S. 229 (1977); Meek v. Pittenger, supra.
</p>
<p>	The U.S. Supreme Court case involving an aid program most similar to the Choice Program is Nyquist.  One of the New York programs challenged in Nyquist was a tuition reimbursement program that provided unrestricted grants of $50 to $100 per child as reimbursement to low-income parents who sent their children to private schools, the great majority of which were religious schools.  The Court first observed that because there was no effective means of guaranteeing that the grants would be used exclusively for secular purposes, &quot;[t]here can be no question that these grants could not, consistently with the Establishment Clause, be given directly to the sectarian schools....&quot;  413 U.S. at 780.
</p>
<p>	The Court then held that the fact that the program provided reimbursement to the parents rather than direct payment to the schools made no difference:
</p>
<p>	[I]f the grants are offered as an incentive to parents to send their children to sectarian schools by making unrestricted cash payments to them, the Establishment Clause is violated whether or not the actual dollars given eventually find their way into the sectarian institutions.  Whether the grant is labeled a reimbursement, a reward, or a subsidy, its substantive impact is still the same.

<p>	In a case decided the same day as Nyquist, the Court rejected the argument that Pennsylvania's private school tuition reimbursement law was constitutional because the law authorizes grants to all parents of children in private schools and that it cannot be assumed that the parents will spend the money on religious school tuition.
</p>
<p>		Our decision...is not dependent upon any such speculation.  Instead we look to the substance of the program, and no matter how it is characterized the effect remains the same.  The State has singled out a class of its citizens for a special economic benefit.  Whether that benefit be viewed as a simple tuition subsidy, as an incentive to parents to send their children to sectarian schools, or as a reward for having done so, at bottom its intended consequence is to preserve and support religion-oriented institutions. ...  We hold that Pennsylvania's tuition grant scheme violates the constitutional mandate against the &quot;sponsorship&quot; or &quot;financial support&quot; of religion or religious institutions.
</p>
<p>Sloan v. Lemon, 413 U.S. at 832-33.
</p>
<p>	The Choice Program is indisputably unconstitutional under Nyquist.  Both involve aid to low income students who attend private schools, whether sectarian or nonsectarian.  In both cases, the great majority of the schools that stand to benefit from the aid are sectarian.  The only significant distinctions between the Choice Program and the New York program provide additional evidence of the Choice Program's unconstitutionality -- under the Choice Program, the money does flow directly to the schools, and the amount of the payment, even after taking into account two decades of inflation, not only is much greater under the Choice Program but will in most cases exceed tuition.
</p>
<h4>	A.	Nyquist remains good law.
</h4>
<p>	The Choice proponents would have this Court consign Nyquist to the dustbin of constitutional history.  Notwithstanding their protestations, Nyquist remains the law.
</p>
<p>	The U.S. Supreme Court cited Nyquist with approval as recently as 1994.  See Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village Sch. Dist. v. Grumet, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 2487 (1994).  Just last year, United States District Judge John Reynolds also relied on Nyquist when he held that the Establishment Clause prohibited any expansion of Wisconsin's Choice Program to include religious schools.  Miller v. Benson, 878 F. Supp. 1209 (E.D. Wis.), vacated as moot, 68 F.3d 163 (7th Cir. 1995).
</p>
<p>	In 1993, the Miller Intervenors sued the State of Wisconsin in federal court, alleging that the exclusion of religious schools from the original pre-Budget Act version of the Choice Program deprived them of their free exercise and equal protection rights.  Rejecting those arguments, Judge Reynolds observed that &quot;No case has overruled Nyquist's prohibition on tuition grants and unrestricted direct subsidies to religious schools.&quot; 878 F. Supp. at 1215. 
</p>
<p>	The Choice proponents read far more into the Supreme Court's post-Nyquist decisions -- Mueller, Witters, Zobrest and Rosenberger -- than is warranted.  In Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388 (1983), a 5-4 Court upheld a Minnesota statute that allowed state taxpayers to deduct from their state income tax expenses incurred in providing tuition, textbooks and transportation for their children attending elementary or secondary schools.  The Court found that the deduction did not have the primary effect of advancing the sectarian aims of the religious schools.  It noted that &quot;the tax deduction is available for educational expenses incurred by all parents, including those whose children attend public schools and those whose children attend nonsectarian private schools or sectarian schools.&quot;  Id. at 397.
</p>
<p>		In this respect, as well as others, this case is vitally different from the scheme struck down in Nyquist.  There, public assistance amounting to tuition grants was provided only to parents of children in non-public schools.  This fact had considerable bearing on our decision striking down the New York statute at issue; we explicitly distinguished both Allen and Everson on the grounds that &quot;[in] both cases the class of beneficiaries included all schoolchildren, those in public as well as those in private schools.&quot;
</p>
<p>Id. at 398.  
</p>
<p>	But more significantly, the Mueller Court distinguished the passive nature of the tax deduction from the tuition reimbursements in Nyquist and Sloan, which it viewed as actively subsidizing religious education.  Id. at 396 n.6, 399.  Unlike reimbursements involving the actual transfer of public funds, the tax deduction provided merely an &quot;attenuated financial benefit[]&quot; to the religious schools.  Id. at 399.  The Court reaffirmed that &quot;the direct transmission of assistance from the State to the [religious] schools themselves&quot; would be unconstitutional.  Id. 
</p>
<p>	In Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for the Blind, 474 U.S. 481 (1986), the Court upheld the payment of vocational educational assistance funds to a blind student attending a Bible college.  The Court said that it was &quot;well settled...that the State may not grant aid to a religious school, whether cash or in kind, where the effect of the aid is that of a direct subsidy to the religious school from the State.&quot;  Id. at 487 (internal quotations omitted).  &quot;Aid may have that effect,&quot; the Court said, &quot;even though it takes the form of aid to students.&quot;  Id.
</p>
<p>	As in Mueller, the Court in Witters found the program constitutional in large part because it was available to students attending both public and private schools and is &quot;in no way skewed towards religion.&quot;  Id. at 487-88.  The Court viewed the program primarily as providing vocational assistance to the disabled student, rather than one in which &quot;any significant portion of the aid expended under the Washington program as a whole will end up flowing to religious education.&quot;  Id. at 488.  Under the Amended Choice Program, in contrast, &quot;a significant portion of the aid expended&quot; will &quot;end up flowing to religious education.&quot; 	
</p>
<p>	More recently, in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 113 S.Ct. 2462 (1993), the Court held that a school district may provide a sign-language interpreter under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to a student at a Roman Catholic high school.  Once again, the Court noted that the assistance was available to students attending both public and private schools.  Id. at 2467.  For that reason, the Court said, the IDEA &quot;creates no financial incentive for parents to choose a sectarian school....&quot;  Id.   Moreover, the Court observed, under the IDEA, &quot;no funds traceable to the government ever find their way into sectarian schools' coffers.&quot;  Id. at 2467-68.
</p>
<p>	The Choice Program supporters can take no comfort in Mueller, Witters or Zobrest.  Unlike the programs at issue in those cases, the Choice Program is available only to students attending private schools.  Three-fourths of those private schools are religious, and over eighty percent of the private school students in Milwaukee attend religious schools.  The great majority of the state aid under the Choice Program will flow to religious organizations.  Millions of dollars of &quot;funds traceable to the government&quot; will &quot;find their way into sectarian schools' coffers.&quot;  Zobrest, 113 S.Ct. at 2468. The express purpose of the Budget Act, moreover, was to expand the Choice Program to religious schools.  As a result, the Amended Choice Program now creates a powerful &quot;financial incentive for parents to choose a sectarian school....&quot;  Id. at 2467.
</p>
<p>	The most recent U.S. Supreme Court decision on state funding of religious activities, Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 115 S.Ct. 2510 (1995), reinforces the continuing vitality of Nyquist's holding.  In Rosenberger, a 5-4 majority of the Court held that the University of Virginia would not violate the Establishment Clause if it used money from a student activities fund to pay printing bills for a Christian student group.  The Court found it significant that the funds were derived from an activity fee imposed on students, rather than a tax designed to raise revenue, and that the money was paid directly to the printer. 
</p>
<p>	Our decision, then, cannot be read as addressing an expenditure from a general tax fund.  Here, the disbursements from the [student activity] fund go to the private contractors for the cost of printing....  This is a far cry from a general public assessment designed and effected to provide financial support for a church.
</p>
<p>Id. at 2522.  Justice O'Connor, who supplied the crucial fifth vote, also observed that in light of these distinctions, the Court's decision did not &quot;signal[] the demise of the funding prohibition in Establishment Clause jurisprudence.&quot;  Id. at 2528 (O'Connor, J., concurring).
</p>
<p>	Unlike the student activity fees in Rosenberger, the funds for the Choice Program come directly from general tax revenues deposited in the state treasury.  These state funds flow directly to religious institutions where they will support religious activities.  Nothing in Rosenberger even remotely suggests that the Choice Program is constitutional.
</p>
<h4>	B.	The facial neutrality of a governmental program does not eliminate Establishment Clause concerns.
</h4>
<p>	The Choice proponents make the &quot;neutrality&quot; of the Choice Program a centerpiece of their argument.  &quot;A program that neutrally benefits sectarian and nonsectarian institutions alike,&quot; they argue, &quot;cannot have the primary effect of advancing religion.&quot;  Governor's Brief at 36.  While neutrality certainly is a factor in the Supreme Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence, the Court has made it clear that neutrality alone does not insulate a program from constitutional infirmity.
</p>
<p>	In Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589 (1988), for example, the Court expressly rejected the proposition advanced by the Governor here that a program that neutrally benefits sectarian and nonsectarian institutions cannot have the primary effect of advancing religion.
</p>
<p>		Of course, even when the challenged statute appears to be neutral on its face, we have always been careful to ensure that direct governmental aid to religiously affiliated institutions does not have the primary effect of advancing religion.  One way in which direct government aid might have that effect is if the aid flows to institutions that are &quot;pervasively sectarian.&quot; ... The reason for this is that there is a risk that direct government funding, even if it is designated for specific secular purposes, may nonetheless advance the pervasively sectarian institution's &quot;religious mission.&quot;
</p>
<p>Id. at 609-10.  Similarly, in Roemer v. Board of Public Works, 426 U.S. 736 (1976), the Court said:
</p>
<p>	The Court has taken the view that a secular purpose and a facial neutrality may not be enough, if in fact the State is lending direct support to a religious activity.  The State may not, for example, pay for what is actually a religious education, even though it purports to be paying for a secular one, and even though it makes its aid available to secular and religious institutions alike.
</p>
<p>Id. at 747.
	
	Most recently, in Rosenberger, the Supreme Court once again affirmed that neutrality of a program alone does not guarantee its constitutionality.  While holding that a state university's use of student activity fees to pay a religious organization's printing bill would not violate the Establishment Clause, the Court stated that its decision cannot be read as approving a government funding scheme in which, &quot;even under a neutral program that includes nonsectarian recipients, the government is making direct money payments to an institution or group that is engaged in religious activity.&quot;  115 S.Ct. at 2523.  As Justice O'Connor observed in her concurring opinion, the Court's decision in Rosenberger &quot;neither trumpets the supremacy of the neutrality principle nor signals the demise of the funding prohibition in Establishment Clause jurisprudence.&quot;  Id. at 2528 (O'Connor, J., concurring).
</p>
<h4>	C.	Even indirect aid to religious organizations may violate the Establishment Clause.
</h4>
<p>	This Court likewise should reject the Choice proponents' argument that the expanded Choice Program  is constitutional because it provides only an indirect benefit to religious schools as a result of private decisions of individual parents.  As a factual matter, that is not correct.  Under the Program, state funds pass instantaneously through the hands of parents to the private schools.  The Choice Program payments are &quot;direct contributions which are merely routed through the parents to the schools, ... in lieu of payment by the parents.&quot;  Nyquist, 413 U.S. at 785-86.  That is no indirect or attenuated benefit to the school -- it is a direct subsidy that serves to &quot;advance [a] pervasively sectarian institution's `religious mission.'&quot;  Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. at 610.
</p>
<p>	Moreover, even if this Court were to view the Choice Program as providing only an indirect benefit to sectarian schools, the Supreme Court has never adopted the distinction between direct and indirect aid as a dispositive rule.  To the contrary, in Nyquist and Sloan, the Court found that tuition grants violated the Establishment Clause even though the funds were paid to the parents and did not flow directly to the religious schools.  As the district court stated in the contemporaneous case of Wolman v. Essex, 342 F. Supp. 399, 415-16 (S.D. Ohio), aff'd mem. 409 U.S. 808 (1972):
</p>
<p>	Payment to the parent for transmittal to the denominational school does not have a cleansing effect and somehow cause the funds to lose their identity as public funds....  Since the parents serve as mere conduits of public funds, the State retains a responsibility for insuring that the public moneys provided and which retain their public character throughout the transaction, are used for constitutionally permissible ends and continue to be so used.
</p>
<p>	In 1985 -- two years after it decided Mueller -- the Court reaffirmed the holdings in Nyquist and Sloan, explaining that the &quot;differences in form [in Nyquist and Sloan] were insufficient to save programs whose effect was indistinguishable from that of a direct subsidy to the religious school.&quot;  Ball, 473 U.S. at 394.  The Court expressly stated that an &quot;indirect subsidy&quot; will still &quot;evoke[] Establishment Clause concerns when the public funds flow to `an institution in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission....'&quot;  Id. at 394 n.12, quoting Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 743 (1973).
</p>
<p>	The determinative factor in recent decisions has not been the direct or indirect nature of the aid but whether the benefit to religion is attenuated and insubstantial.  See Rosenberger, 115 S.Ct. at 2524 (&quot;Any benefit to religion is incidental&quot;); Zobrest, 113 S.Ct. at 2467-69.  As the Court reaffirmed in Witters, state aid still may have an impermissible effect &quot;even though it takes the form of aid to students or parents.&quot;  474 U.S. at 487.
</p>
<p>	The Miller Intervenors correctly recognize that the distinction between &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot; aid is not dispositive, in part because it is a &quot;feature easily manipulated by a state legislature.&quot;  Miller Intervenors' Brief at 46.  That is precisely what the Wisconsin legislature attempted here, when it changed the Choice Program's payment mechanism from a check payable to the school to a check payable to the parents which they must endorse over to the school.  That sort of legislative legerdemain cannot have any constitutional significance.
</p>
<p>	To the State of Wisconsin, however, this change in payment mechanism apparently makes all the difference between a constitutional program and an unconstitutional one.  In the federal court litigation in Miller v. Benson, the state argued (and persuaded the district court) that the Original Choice Program would be unconstitutional if it included religious schools:
</p>
<p>		The choice statute grants a payment of money directly from the state to the private school.  If the program included sectarian private schools, tax funds would be transferred from the state treasury to sectarian schools to directly support the teaching of religious doctrine. 
</p>
<p>Now, of course, the state (through both the Governor, who asserts that he represent the state's position here, and the Attorney General, who represented the state in Miller) contends that including religious schools in the Choice Program is not unconstitutional.  The only explanation for that abrupt about-face is that the state believes that the change in payment mechanism is dispositive.  The other elements of the amended Program that the state now finds so important -- the neutrality of the program and the fact that state funds go to the schools as a result of parental choice -- have not changed.
</p>
<p>	The U.S. Supreme Court has never accepted the general principles on which Choice proponents rely as dispositive.  It has, however, specifically and unequivocally prohibited the sort of state funding for religious education that the Choice Program provides to parochial schools in Milwaukee.  For that reason, the Amended Choice Program violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment in addition to violating Article I, sec. of the Wisconsin Constitution.
</p>
<h3>III.	EXCLUDING RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS FROM THE CHOICE PROGRAM DOES NOT VIOLATE THE FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT.
</h3>
<p>	Alone among the Choice Program supporters, the Miller Intervenors contend that the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment requires that the Choice Program include religious schools.  They contend that the Original Program was (and continues to be) unconstitutional because it purposefully discriminates against religion.  State funding for private education that excludes religious schools, the Miller Intervenors claim, requires them to waive their free exercise rights as a condition of accepting the benefits of publicly funded private education.
</p>
<p>	The Miller Intervenors' free exercise arguments are without merit.   The Original Choice Program does not make any religious practice unlawful or exclude any religious (or nonreligious) parent from participating in the Program because of his or her faith.  Some parents, like those represented here by Parents for School Choice, want to send their children to religious schools for reasons other than their religious beliefs.  Other parents, like many of the Jackson Respondents, are devoutly religious people who believe that enrolling their children in public schools best conforms to their beliefs.  But regardless of how any particular individual interprets or responds to the demands of his or her religious faith, the Original Choice Program treats all parents the same.  
</p>
<p>	In Brusca v. Missouri, 332 F. Supp. 275 (E.D. Mo. 1971), aff'd, 405 U.S. 1050 (1972), the district court, in a decision summarily affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court, rejected the argument that a state's refusal to fund religious education discriminated against parents who wished to send their children to parochial schools.
</p>
<p>	We find nothing arbitrary or unreasonable in the determination of the State to deny its funds to sectarian schools or for religious instruction....  All children of every and no religious denomination have the same right to attend free secular public schools maintained by tax funds.
</p>
<p>Id. at 279.  The Original Choice Program similarly reflects a decision by the State of Wisconsin to fund only secular education, while allowing children of all faiths or no faith to attend those schools.
</p>
<p>	The mere fact that the state funds only secular programs or limits the application of public monies to secular providers or for secular purposes does not translate into purposeful discrimination against religion.  The Original Choice Program is no different in this respect from a host of state and federal programs that prohibit the use of public funds for religious purposes while allowing all individuals, religious and nonreligious, to participate equally in the programs.  See, e.g., Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. at 609-10 (holding that funds under the federal Adolescent Family Life Act may not be used for religious purposes even though religiously affiliated entities may participate in the program); Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672 (1971) (barring church-affiliated colleges from using federal funds for religious purposes).   If the Free Exercise Clause requires that the government allow neutrally available funds to be used for religious purposes, then every one of these programs is unconstitutional.
</p>
<p>	The Miller Intervenors rely heavily on the Supreme Court's recent decision in Rosenberger, where the Court found that a state university had discriminated against the petitioners based on the religious content of their speech.  The Rosenberger Court reaffirmed, however, the constitutionality of maintaining such distinctions with respect to the funding of religious entities.  115 S.Ct. at 2522-23.  Thus, the fact that the state funds only secular programs or limits the application of public monies to secular providers or for secular purposes does not amount to purposeful discrimination against religion.
</p>
<p>	The Miller Intervenors also have failed to show that they have suffered any substantial burden on their religious practices.  They do not allege that their religious beliefs require that they send their children to religious schools or that the state's failure to pay for a religious education somehow compels them to act contrary to their religious beliefs.   The mere failure of the state to pay for the enhancement of an individual's religious faith cannot be equated with the imposition of a substantial burden on that person's religious practice.  As the Court explained in Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass'n, 485 U.S. 439 (1988):
</p>
<p>	[T]his Court has repeatedly held that indirect coercion or penalties on the free exercise of religion, not just outright prohibitions, are subject to scrutiny under the First Amendment.  Thus, for example, ineligibility for unemployment benefits, based solely on a refusal to violate the Sabbath, has been analogized to a fine imposed on Sabbath worship.  Sherbert [v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 404 (1963).]  This does not and cannot imply that incidental effects of governmental programs, which may make it more difficult to practice certain religions but which have no tendency to coerce individuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs, require government to bring forward a compelling justification for its otherwise lawful actions.  The crucial word in the constitutional text is &quot;prohibit&quot;:  &quot;For the Free Exercise Clause is written in terms of what the government cannot do to the individual, not in terms of what the individual can exact from the government.&quot;
</p>
<p>Id. at 450-51, quoting Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 412 (Douglas, J., concurring) (emphasis added); accord, Bob Jones University v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 603-04 (1983) (holding that a denial of benefits &quot;will inevitably have a substantial impact on the operation of private religious schools, but will not prevent those schools from observing their religious tenets.&quot;).  As the court held in Brusca:
</p>
<p>	[A] parent's right to choose a religious private school for his children may not be equated with the right to insist that the state is compelled to finance his child's non-public school education in whole or in part in order that he may obtain a religious education.
</p>
<p>332 F. Supp. at 277.
</p>
<p>	In a case raising a similar issue under the rubric of the Equal Protection clause, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that parents' constitutional right to send their children to private schools if they choose, recognized in cases such as Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), imposes any obligation on the states to fund private schools.
</p>
<p>	In Pierce, the Court affirmed the right of private schools to exist and to operate; it said nothing of any supposed right of private or parochial schools to share with public schools in state largesse, on an equal basis or otherwise.  ...  It is one thing to say that a State may not prohibit the maintenance of private schools and quite another to say that such schools must, as a matter of equal protection, receive state aid.
</p>
<h2>Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455, 462 (1973). 
</h2>
<p>	Because the decision not to fund sectarian education does not impose a substantial burden on the Miller Intervenors' religious practice, it cannot have the effect of imposing an unconstitutional condition -- the waiver of a free exercise right -- on the acceptance of the benefit of participating in the Original Choice Program.  &quot;A government regulation that indirectly and incidentally calls for a choice between securing a governmental benefit and adherence to religious beliefs is wholly different from governmental action or legislation that criminalizes religiously inspired activity or inescapably compels conduct that some find objectionable for religious reasons.&quot;  Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 706 (1986).
</p>
<p>	&quot;The fact that the government cannot exact from [a citizen] a surrender of one iota of [his] religious scruples does not, of course, mean that [he] can demand of government a sum of money, the better to exercise them.&quot;  Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. at 412 (Douglas, J., concurring).  The Miller Intervenors concede that the State of Wisconsin would not have violated their free exercise rights had it limited state funding to only secular public education.  See Miller Intervenors' Brief at 14.  The restriction in the Original Choice Program limiting participation in the Program to secular schools no more impairs the Miller Intervenors' free exercise rights than would the state's decision to fund only public education.
</p>
<h3>IV.	THE AMENDED CHOICE PROGRAM VIOLATES ARTICLE X OF THE WISCONSIN CONSTITUTION.</h3>
<p>	
	In Article X of the Wisconsin Constitution, the framers required that the legislature establish a system of primary and secondary instruction that was to be free and uniform.   The comprehensive nature of the educational system established in Article X, along with the history of that provision and of education in Wisconsin, demonstrates the framers' intent that the district school system described in Article X be the state's only system of publicly-supported primary and secondary education.  The Amended Choice Program undermines this goal by creating an alternative system composed of publicly-funded private schools that competes with the public schools for students and funds -- schools that are beyond the reach of the taxpayers who support them, the Superintendent of Public Instruction and, the Choice proponents contend, the Constitution.
</p>
<h4>		A.	Davis v. Grover Is Not Dispositive.
</h4>
<p>	The Choice proponents contend that any Article X issues raised by the Choice Program were resolved definitively in Davis v. Grover, 166 Wis.2d 501, 480 N.W.2d 460 (1992), and that the Court need not re-examine them here.  Those arguments ignore the substantial differences between the Original Choice Program at issue in Davis and the Amended Choice Program now before the Court.
</p>
<p>	The Davis decision repeatedly emphasized that the Choice Program was experimental, limited in scope, and carefully monitored by the state.  See 166 Wis.2d at 512, 513, 533, 534, 539, 546.  Specifically, the Court noted that the Program was open only to one percent of the school district's membership, which amounted to no more than 1,000 students.  Id. at 515.  The Program also was limited to nonsectarian schools and participating schools could enroll no more than 49% of their total enrollment under the Program.  Id. at 514-15.
</p>
<p>	The Amended Choice Program is a drastic departure from that &quot;narrowly defined and carefully monitored&quot; Program.  Id.  It no longer is limited to nonsectarian schools.  Choice students no longer need make up a minority of a participating schools' students; under the Amended Program, 100 percent of a school's pupils may be publicly funded Choice Program students.  Nor is the Amended Program limited to one percent of the MPS pupil population; instead, up to 15 percent of the MPS membership -- nearly 15,000 students -- will be able to participate next year.  Indeed, with 15,000 students, the Choice Program will have more students than all but a handful of the state's school districts. 
</p>
<p>	The Amended Choice Program is no longer experimental.  The reporting and information gathering requirements upon which the Court relied in Davis to find the Original Program to have been experimental now have been repealed.  See 1995 Wis. Act 27, Sec. 4007m.  The expanded Choice Program will remain in effect indefinitely.
</p>
<p>	Given the limited number of students eligible to participate in the Original Program, the Court in Davis found that the Program did not constitute &quot;an abandonment of the public school system.&quot;  166 Wis. 2d at 533.  With up to 15,000 MPS students about to be diverted from public schools under the Amended Choice Program, that conclusion no longer is true.
</p>
<p>	The small-scale, experimental Choice Program considered in Davis bears little resemblance to the Program now before the Court.  The Court should take a fresh look at the Article X issues raised by the Choice Program in light of the extensive changes to the Program.
</p>
<h4>		B.	Article X prohibits public funding of primary and secondary education at private schools.
</h4>
<p>	Article X, sec. 3, is &quot;a limitation upon the broad power of the state to educate its citizens through the establishment and operation of schools.&quot;  Zweifel v. Joint Dist. No. 1, 76 Wis.2d 648, 658, 251 N.W.2d 822 (1977).  The legislature is not free to adopt whatever educational system it chooses.  &quot;The limitations are precisely stated:  District schools, uniformity, and free tuition for certain ages.&quot;  Id.
</p>
<p>	Just as the legislature may not refuse to establish district schools, it cannot disband those schools or allow them to deteriorate.  See Davis, 166 Wis. 2d at 557 (Abrahamson, J., dissenting).  Indeed, Article X, sec. 3, and the constitutional guarantee of a free education in district schools would mean little if the state could undermine public schools by paying for children to attend private schools.
</p>
<p>	One of the principle aids in interpreting the Wisconsin Constitution is a &quot;historical analysis of the constitutional debates and of what practices were in existence in 1848....&quot;  Buse v. Smith, 74 Wis. 2d 550, 568, 247 N.W.2d 141 (1976).  The history of the Wisconsin Constitution demonstrates that the framers intended that the district schools be the only system of publicly financed primary and secondary education in Wisconsin.  The adoption of Article X reflects their belief that educating the public was a core function of the state.  See Kukor v. Grover, 148 Wis.2d 469, 488, 436 N.W.2d 568 (1989).  Education, it was believed, was integral to the protection of liberty and democracy and should be provided by the state free to all of its citizens:
</p>
<p>	[A] general system of education was the only system on which we could depend for the preservation of our liberties.
</p>
<p>Id., quoting Journals and Debates, Constitutional Convention (1847-48), at 238.  The framers also believed that providing public education that was free from sectarian beliefs would foster equality, attract people of diverse religions and ethnic backgrounds, and prevent divisiveness.  See Weiss, 76 Wis. at 198.  
</p>
<p>	The creation of a single system of public education was a reaction to the &quot;patchwork&quot;  system of schools that existed when the constitution was adopted and reflected the framers' commitment to a system of district common schools.  At that time, virtually all schooling was private.  37 O.A.G. 347, 349 (1948).   Article X and the creation of a single state-supported school system represent the framers' rejection of private schools as the primary means of educating the state's citizens.  They represent as well the rejection of the mixed public and private funding of primary and secondary schools.  Davis, 166 Wis. 2d at 557 (Abrahamson, J., dissenting).
</p>
<p>	The debates over the funding of the schools also demonstrate the intent to create an exclusive system of publicly financed primary and secondary instruction.  During the constitutional convention of 1847-48, the framers hotly debated the extent to which the state should fund the schools.  Kukor, 148 Wis.2d at 488.  They decided that the best way to safeguard the quality of the schools was to fund them through taxation which, they believed, would ensure public interest in the schools.  See id. at 489.  The framers feared that apathy on the part of the public would cause the public schools to decline, with private schools rising &quot;on their ruins.&quot;  Id., quoting Journals and Debates at 335.  By giving the public a direct pecuniary interest in the public schools, the framers hoped to preserve those schools and prevent the dominance of private schools.  
</p>
<p>  	Early case law is also instructive.  In Curtis's Administrator v. Whipple, 24 Wis. 350 (1869), the Court struck down a law that authorized the Town of Jefferson to raise a tax to support a private school.  In his concurring opinion, Justice Paine explained that the educational system prescribed in the constitution was the only public instruction to be supported by taxation.
</p>
<p>	Our constitution provides for a general system of public free schools, for normal schools, incorporated academies, and a state university.  These are all to be supported largely by taxation.  And from the general and extensive character of the provisions upon this subject, I think there is some implication that this system was designed to be exclusive, and to furnish the only public instruction which was to be supported by taxation.
</p>
<p>Id. at 359-60 (Paine, J., concurring)   Justice Paine's opinion made explicit what is implicit in the Constitution: the district school system designed in Article X was meant to be the only publicly funded system of primary and secondary education in the state.
</p>
<p>	The Court's decisions in Manitowoc v. Manitowoc Rapids, 231 Wis. 94, 285 N.W. 403 (1939) and State ex rel. Warren v. Reuter, supra, do not compel a different conclusion.  In Manitowoc, the Court held that Article X, sec. 3, did not prohibit the state from providing a free education to those over the age 20 or under the age of 4.  Reuter involved state funding of a private medical school, not primary or secondary schools, and raised no Article X, sec. 3, issues.  Because those cases did not involve public funding of primary or secondary instruction, and because the schools at issue in those cases that received public funding did not duplicate services that were constitutionally mandated by Article X and provided by public primary and secondary schools, they are irrelevant to this case.  For the same reason, the Choice proponents' analogies to programs through which the state contracts with private organizations to provide specialized services to public school students also fail.
</p>
<p>	Unlike the vocational schools in Manitowoc and the medical school in Reuter, the Choice Program directly competes with the public primary and secondary schools for students and funds.  See Agreed Upon Statement of Facts, at  34.  The Program undermines the purpose of Article X by effectively replacing the public schools with competing publicly funded private schools.  The Program does not merely provide students with a &quot;choice&quot; of educational opportunities; it advances private schools at the expense of the public schools.  Moreover, it deprives the public of a voice in the operation of schools that they support with their taxes and exempts the participating schools from the accountability and oversight requirements that the framers believed essential.
</p>
<p>	While the legislature may provide educational opportunities beyond those that are constitutionally required, the means chosen to accomplish that goal may not violate the Constitution.  See Buse, 74 Wis.2d at 567-68.  The Amended Choice Program violates Article X, sec. 3, by creating a competing school system composed exclusively of private schools that supplants the system of district schools prescribed in Article X, sec. 3.
</p>
<h4>		C.	The Amended School Choice Program violates Article X, sec. 3's requirements of a uniform education free from sectarian instruction.
</h4>
<p>	Relying on Davis, the Choice proponents contend that private schools are not &quot;district&quot; schools subject to Article X, sec. 3.  In Davis, the Court rejected the argument that a private school that accepts any public money is a district school.  See 166 Wis.2d at 540.  Under the Program at issue in Davis, however, no school could receive more than half of its funds from the state.  Under the Amended Choice Program, in contrast, a private school's entire enrollment may consist of Choice students and the school may be supported entirely by state funds.  This Court need not overrule Davis to conclude that &quot;private&quot; primary and secondary schools that may receive the majority of their funds from tax dollars are &quot;district&quot; schools subject to Article X, sec. 3.
</p>
<p>	If Article X, sec. 3, does apply, it is beyond dispute that the Choice Program schools do not meet the constitutional requirements of educational uniformity and freedom from sectarian instruction.  The uniformity requirement applies to the character of instruction in the schools, which must be &quot;as uniform as practicable.&quot;  Kukor, 148 Wis.2d at 492.  While private schools are subject to certain basic curricular requirements, see sec. 118.165, Stats., those requirements fall short of the extensive obligations that public schools have under sec. 121.02, Stats.  As a result, &quot;the character of instruction and the educational training that is provided to pupils who attend the participating private schools and MPS will not necessarily be the same.&quot;  Agreed Upon Statement of Facts, at  35.
</p>
<p>	This conclusion is underscored with respect to the religious schools that will participate in the Choice Program.  The religious education that students receive through the Choice Program will be of a entirely different character than the secular education that students receive in the public schools of this state.
</p>
<p>	Expanding the Choice Program to include religious schools also violates Article X, sec. 3's prohibition on sectarian education in the district schools.  That provision, read in the context of the history and purpose of the Constitution -- including Article I, sec. 18 -- prohibits state-supported religious education, which the framers saw as divisive and incompatible with the principles of equality and religious liberty.  See Weiss, 76 Wis. at 198.  The state legislature cannot avoid the constitutional prohibition on state-supported religious instruction by paying for students to attend religious schools as an alternative to public schools. 
</p>
<p>	Article X, sec. 3, applies whenever the legislature allows primary and secondary schools to receive a majority of their support from public funds.  If the Court finds that Article X, sec. 3, permits the large-scale public funding of private primary and secondary schools provided under the Amended Choice Program, the schools participating in the Program should be held to the same standards of uniformity and freedom from sectarian instruction as all other publicly supported primary and secondary schools in the state.
</p>

<h3>	CONCLUSION
</h3>
<p>	Both the state and federal constitutions prohibit the massive state funding of religious education provided by the Amended Choice Program.  For the reasons stated above, the Court should find the Amended Choice Program unconstitutional.

<H1>PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY IN THE WORKPLACE
</H1>
<P>Many of the basic rights we all take for granted are not protected when we
go to work.  In fact, the ACLU receives more complaints about workplace rights
violations than about any other issue.  The 12-minute video Through the Keyhole
sheds some light on one particularly important issue: the right to employee
privacy, and how it is violated by employers through hidden surveillance,
unwarranted drug testing and &quot;lifestyle discrimination.&quot;
</P>
<P>These abuses occur because there are so few laws that protect workers'
privacy rights.  But you can help change that by supporting the Campaign for
Fairness in the Workplace:<BR>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Call the ACLU's Campaign for Fairness in the Workplace at 1-800-775-ACLU.
<BR>We will send you ACLU publications on workplace privacy, sample letters to
editors and legislators and more information on how you can help
</LI>
<LI>Show the video to your friends, family and co-workers<BR>Feel free to make
copies and share the video with others

<P>Many civil liberties victories have been won with the help of people like
you. If you believe the right to privacy should be respected at work, you can
help it happen. With the right balance of persuasion and action, we won't have
to check our civil liberties at the company gate or office door.

<HR>
<H1>YOUR RIGHTS STRIPPED
</H1>
<P>Back in 1928, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis wrote that the right most
valued by the American people was &quot;the right to be left alone.&quot;
Private businesses, particularly those whose employees are not unionized, are
not limited by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights which address only state
action. They are free to violate employee privacy &amp;emdash; and not leave you
alone at all.
</P>
<P>There are many ways privately owned businesses can strip their employees of
their privacy rights:
</P>
<P>American businesses routinely <I>monitor the telephone calls</I> of an
estimated one million employees every  year. Although monitoring is done &quot;in
the course of business,&quot; employers don't have to warn workers, and they can
listen in for up to five minutes in some instances to determine if the call is a
work-related call or not. Secret telephone monitoring invades the privacy of
both the worker and the other person on the line.
</P>

<P>Brad Fair's story shows how humiliating hidden <I>video surveillance</I>
can be. Many other employees are also monitored through their audio headsets, so
that supervisors can hear every word exchanged during the course of a
transaction &amp;emdash; as well as &quot;off the cuff&quot; remarks employees
make to each other, or even to themselves.
</P>
<P>Many employees are subjected to intrusive <I>physical searches</I> of their
person, office or possessions in the workplace. Companies usually claim to do
this on a random basis to deter theft. Increasingly, some companies use imposter
employees as spies to keep their eye on workers.
</P>
<P>An estimated two million employees every year are required to take
<I>written personality tests</I> that probe into the most intimate aspects of
their lives including hygiene habits, sexuality and family relationships.
</P>
<P><I>Drug testing</I> and <I>lifestyle discrimination</I>, as experienced by
Collette Clark, Dan Winn and many other employees, are other ways companies can
pry into the personal lives of their employees.
</P>
<P>Only a small percentage of the American workforce is protected from these
serious invasions of privacy. Federal, state and local government employees, and
contract workers (senior executives, academics, performers, athletes and a few
others) benefit from some degree of legal protection. Many labor unions have
fought hard to protect their members' privacy rights in collective bargaining
agreements &amp;emdash; but less than 20% of the American workforce is
unionized. A few states have enacted limited laws protecting privacy in the
private sector. But the vast majority of Americans do not enjoy civil liberties
protection at work.
</P>
<H1>WORKPLACE PRIVACY DENIED
</H1>
<P>Brad Fair, who worked for a Boston-area hotel restaurant, was shocked to
discover that his employer had installed hidden cameras in the men's locker
room, videotaping employees as they dressed and undressed before and after their
shifts.  Management  claimed they suspected that employees were using and
selling drugs, but nothing illegal was ever discovered.
</P>
<P>Although Brad did find a new job, he remained angry about the hidden
cameras. &quot;It's not a problem to have cameras in the hotel, but if you hide
the camera that means you don't want people to know what you are doing. It was
very sneaky. I can't imagine anyone having a good feeling about working for an
employer that is spying on them.&quot;
</P>
<P>Instead of the promotion Collette Clark was hoping for at the Southern
California utilities company where she worked for years, she got a pink slip
after testing false-positive for marijuana. Although her employer agreed the
test results were inaccurate, company policy dictated employees testing positive
for drugs had to be dismissed. With assistance from the local ACLU, Collette got
her job back &amp;emdash; along with an apology from her employer.
</P>
<P>Collette now says she will never submit to mandatory workplace drug testing
again. &quot;If my qualifications are not good enough, if my okay is not enough,
if you can't believe me...no. Job performance should speak for itself.&quot;
</P>
<P>Dan Winn worked at a Midwest factory for six years when he was abruptly
dismissed. Dan Winn was observed drinking a beer with his supervisor one evening
after work. Although company policy prohibited alcohol use by its employees at
any time, only Dan was fired; his supervisor was not.
</P>
<P>Dan believes the lifestyle policy firing was a mere pretext for punishing
his labor organizing at the non-unionized factory. Nevertheless, he considers
lifestyle discrimination to be detrimental and bad for morale.  &quot;You are
constantly afraid somebody is looking over your shoulder into your personal
life. That puts a lot of pressure on an employee. I guess it could cause a
productivity drop.&quot;
</P>
<P>What happened to Brad, Collette and Dan is still happening all over the
country.
</P>
<P>It's time to put a stop to these unfair practices.

<H1>THE RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES 
</H1><IMG SRC="/graphics/bpline.gif">
<P>When the United States became a nation more than 200 years ago, the Founders
 formulated a Constitution that structured the new society as a majoritarian 
democracy.  They later added a Bill of Rights to protect individuals from the 
tyranny of the majority.  But in the 18th century, when the Constitution and 
Bill of Rights were ratified, government was viewed as the only major threat  to
individual rights.  The Founders could not have imagined back then that,  one
day, concentrations of corporate power would exist on a scale rivaling,  and in
some cases exceeding, governmental power. 
</P>
<P>Today, most Americans are more vulnerable to having their rights violated by
 their employers than the early Americans were to having their rights violated 
by the government.  Yet because the Constitution does not limit their 
authority, private employers are free to violate the civil liberties of their 
employees.  Nationwide, the ACLU receives more complaints about abuses by 
employers than about abuses by the government: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>In California, Sibi Sorkoa was denied a job because he refused to answer 
questions about his sex life on a &quot;psychological test.&quot;  At least two
million  job applicants are required to take such tests every year.<BR> 
<BR> 
</LI>
<LI>In Pennsylvania, George Geary was fired because he pointed out serious 
safety defects in his employer's products.  At least 200,000 Americans are 
unjustly fired every year.<BR> 
<BR> 
</LI>
<LI>In Indiana, Janice Bone was fired because she smoked cigarettes in her own 
home.  At least 6,000 American companies now attempt to regulate off-duty 
smoking and other private behavior.<BR> 
</LI></UL>
<P>The American Civil Liberties Union believes that such abuses can only be 
prevented by extending, into the private workplace, the protections  guaranteed
in the Bill of Rights. Certainly, we recognize that employers have  every right
to expect workers to do their jobs.  But employees are also  entitled to the
same freedoms on the job that they enjoy off the job. 
</P>
<P>Here are the ACLU's answers to some questions frequently asked by the public
 about the rights of American employees. 
</P>
<H3>Q: If the Constitution doesn't apply to the private workplace, what does? 
</H3>
<P>A: The vast majority of American employees, of whom there are 60 million in 
all,  are governed by a doctrine called &quot;employment at will.&quot;  This
doctrine, a  relic of 19th century anti-labor laws, gives employers the
unfettered right  to fire workers at any time, for any reason, whether grave or
frivolous.   Indeed, one can be fired for no reason at all.  An estimated
200,000  employees, at least, are unjustly fired in the United States each year.

</P>
<P>It is the prevalence of the employment-at-will doctrine that empowers 
employers to impose unwarranted urine tests and intrusive &quot;personality&quot;
and  &quot;integrity&quot; tests on their employees.  The power to fire at will
permits  employers to suppress their employees' right to free speech. 
</P>
<H3>Q: Are there <EM>any</EM> laws that protect employees' rights? 
</H3>
<P>A: There are federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination against 
individuals on the bases of race, religion, sex, national origin, age and 
disability.  However, these laws require only that employees be treated 
equally.  Employers are, therefore, free to do whatever they wish to their 
employees as long as they do so in a non-discriminatory manner. 
</P>
<P>A few other federal and state laws provide some protection against specific 
abuses, such as urine testing, polygraph testing and retaliation against 
whistle blowers.  But these laws are extremely limited.  The fundamental  human
rights of free expression, privacy and due process are still largely 
unprotected in the American workplace. 
</P>
<H3>Q: Does the employment-at-will doctrine apply to all employees? 
</H3>
<P>A: No.  There are three broad categories of employees who are not governed
by  employment-at-will: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Government employees:</B> Federal, state and local government workers
are  protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, which prohibit the 
government from depriving any person of &quot;life, liberty or property&quot;
without  due process of law.  These employees are considered to have a property 
interest in their jobs, and the right to due process places significant 
restrictions on arbitrary dismissals unrelated to job performance.  Some 
additional protection is provided by federal, state and local civil service 
laws.<BR> 
<BR> 
</LI>
<LI><B>Union members:</B> Virtually all collective bargaining agreements
between labor  unions and employers stipulate that unionized employees can be
fired only for  just cause, and only after a hearing before a neutral
arbitrator.  However,  less than 20 percent of American workers belong to unions
today, since union  membership has been declining for years.<BR> 
<BR> 
</LI>
<LI><B>Contract employees:</B> Senior executives, academics, performers,
athletes and  some other well-situated employees, whose numbers are so small as
to be  insignificant, work under individual employment contracts that provide 
protection against unjust dismissal.<BR> 
</LI></UL>
<H3>Q: Can employers legally search their employees' lockers, desks and urine
looking for contraband? 
</H3>
<P>A: The Fourth Amendment, which protects the privacy of citizens from  &quot;unreasonable
searches and seizures,&quot; gives some protection to public sector  employees
against their employers' prying eyes.  In general, a government  employer cannot
search the person or belongings of an employee in the absence  of any suspicion
that the particular employee has done something illegal.   With respect to urine
testing for drugs, however: The U.S. Supreme Court has  ruled that government
employees can be required to take such tests, even if  the employer does not
suspect drug use, if the person's job is &quot;safety  sensitive,&quot; or
involves carrying a weapon or having access to classified  information.  (See
ACLU <A HREF="pbp5.html">Briefing Paper #5</A>, &quot;Drug Testing in the
Workplace.&quot;) 
</P>
<P>Private sector employees, on the other hand, have virtually no protection 
against even the most intrusive practices.  In all but a handful of states,  an
employee can be required to submit to a urine test even where nothing  about the
employee's job performance or history suggests illegal drug use.   If the
employee refuses, he or she can be terminated without legal recourse.  
Employees can be subjected to &quot;sniff&quot; searches by dogs and searches of
their  lockers, desks, purses, and even their cars if they park in the company 
parking lot.  Both job applicants and employees can be required to answer 
extremely intrusive questions about their private lives and personal beliefs  on
&quot;psychological,&quot; &quot;personality&quot; and &quot;integrity&quot;
tests. 
</P>
<P>The advent of computer technology has made possible even more sophisticated 
forms of spying in the workplace.  More and more employees are being  subjected
to electronic surveillance through video display terminals,  observation by
hidden cameras installed in work areas and locker rooms, and  monitored
telephone calls.  With few exceptions, these increasingly  widespread practices
are legal. 
</P>
<H3>Q: What can be done to protect the privacy rights of employees? 
</H3>
<P>A: The ACLU believes that both state and federal legislation should be 
enactedto extend privacy rights to private sector employees. 
</P>
<P>In recent years, some positive strides have been made.  In 1988, Congress 
passed the Employee Polygraph Protection Act, which ended decades of &quot;lie 
detector&quot; abuse in the private workplace.  The Act outlaws most random and 
pre-employment polygraph testing, which in past years had led to an estimated 
300,000 workers per year being branded liars.  (See ACLU <A HREF="pbp4.html">Briefing
Paper #4</A>,  &quot;'Lie Detector' Testing.&quot;) 
</P>
<P>Several states -- Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Rhode Island
 and Vermont -- have enacted legislation that protects employees from 
indiscriminate urine testing.  Two states -- Massachusetts and Rhode   Island --
restrict &quot;paper and pencil honesty&quot; tests.  Connecticut is the only
state  that has a law prohibiting &quot;electronic surveillance, including video
 surveillance, of any area designed for the health and comfort of employees or 
for safeguarding of their possessions.&quot; 
</P>
<P>The ACLU has developed model statutes to protect employees from unfair urine
 testing and electronic surveillance, and is actively lobbying for their 
passage in state legislatures throughout the country.  The ACLU is also  urging
Congress to amend the Employee Polygraph Protection Act to cover so-called paper
and pencil &quot;integrity&quot; tests. 
</P>
<H3>Q: Can employers discriminate on the basis of employees' lifestyles? 
</H3>
<P>A: One of the emerging issues in the American workplace is the attempt by 
employers to control certain private habits and proclivities of their  employees
that have no relationship to job performance.  Fat people are  victims of
lifestyle discrimination, and a growing number of companies are  refusing to
hire smokers -- even those who smoke only in their homes.  A few  employers
exclude people with high cholesterol levels, or high blood  pressure, and those
who engage in such risky hobbies as scuba diving and hang  gliding.  Others
impose lifestyle restrictions: One Oregon company bars  workers who fail to
participate in the company's exercise program from  attending company picnics; a
Pennsylvania company prohibits its managers from  riding motorcycles! 
</P>
<P>The driving force behind this trend is economics: Employers concerned about 
the escalating costs of employee health insurance are attempting to cut costs 
by firing and/or refusing to hire people whose lifestyles appear to place  them
at risk of illness or injury.  But if reducing health care costs is  accepted as
a legitimate reason for employers to regulate the off-the-job  conduct of their
employees, then virtually every aspect of our private lives  could be subject to
employer control.  This would be Big Brotherism at its  worst. 
</P>
<H3>Q: What can be done to prevent lifestyle discrimination? 
</H3>
<P>A: The ACLU believes that, just as legislation has been needed to prevent 
other violations of civil liberties in the workplace, legislation is also
necessary  to prevent lifestyle discrimination.  Just as federal, state and
local laws  exist to prohibit employment discrimination based on race, gender,
ethnicity,  religion and, in some places, sexual preference, new laws are needed
to  protect against discriminatory practices based on employees' private 
lifestyle preferences and habits. 
</P>
<P>Fourteen states have recently enacted laws that restrain employers from 
prohibiting legal activities as a condition of employment.  For example, 
Colorado law makes it &quot;a discriminatory or unfair employment practice for
an  employer to terminate the employment of any employee due to that employee's 
engaging in any lawful activity off the premises of the employer during 
nonworking hours....&quot;  Other states are considering bills that prohibit 
employment discrimination based on off-duty smoking.  The ACLU supports these 
efforts. 
</P>
<H3>Q: Should employers ever have the right to discipline their employees? 
</H3>
<P>A: Absolutely.  Employers have the right to expect an honest day's work for
a  day's pay.  They have the right to expect that their workers will not be 
drunk, drugged, or too fatigued to perform their jobs.  They have the right  to
set performance standards and expect those standards to be met.  They also  have

the right to discipline and dismiss employees for just cause. 
</P>
<P>Even if all the protective laws described in this briefing paper were passed
 in every state, employers would still retain the right to discipline and 
dismiss any employee whose job performance was lacking. 
</P>
<H3>Q: But wouldn't recognition of civil liberties in the workplace damage the 
 American economy? 
</H3>

<P>A: There is no conflict between free enterprise and civil liberties in the 

workplace.  Free enterprise should not be taken to mean that every  corporation
is a sovereign republic unto itself, whose only law is the whim  of the current
CEO.  Employers must be free to decide what products to make  (or stop making),
what factories to operate and where to locate those  factories, what prices to
charge, and how many workers to hire.  But they can  make such decisions without
trampling on their employees' rights to free  speech, privacy and due process. 
</P>
<P>The fact is that employers in most other Western industrialized nations, as 
well as in Japan, are required by law to respect the rights of their  employees.
 Nonetheless, those employers' businesses survive and prosper.   Moreover,
several American employers, including some of the nation's most  successful
corporations, already guarantee their employees' civil liberties  without
affecting the bottom line of profits.  Those employers believe that  respecting
employees' rights boosts morale and, thus, raises corporate  performance. 

</P>
<P>It is ironic that the United States, with its long professed  respect for 
individual rights, has not yet extended Bill of Rights protections to the 
largest remaining group of forgotten citizens -- American workers.  It is  time
to right that wrong.

<h1>LIE DETECTOR TESTING
</h1>
<img src="../graphics/bpline.gif">
<p>During the past decade, more than two million private sector employees
each year were asked to take a &quot;lie detector&quot; test.  Based on these tests,
approximately 300,000 workers annually were branded liars and fired,
disciplined or not hired as a result.
</p>
<p>Despite the claims of &quot;lie detector&quot; examiners, there is no machine that
can detect lies with any degree of accuracy.  The &quot;lie detector&quot; does not
measure truth-telling; it measures changes in blood pressure, breath rate
and perspiration rate, but those physiological changes can be triggered
by a wide range of emotions such as anger, sadness, embarrassment and
fear.  In addition, a variety of medical conditions such as colds,
headaches and neurological and muscular problems can distort the results. 
Indeed, as an American Medical Association expert testified during public
hearings before Congress, &quot;the [lie detector] cannot detect lies much
better than a coin toss.&quot;
</p>
<p>The ACLU has long favored protective legislation against indiscriminate
&quot;lie detector&quot; testing in the American workplace, not only because it is
unreliable, but also because it is an extreme invasion of privacy.  For
example, in order to establish &quot;normal&quot; physiological reactions of the
person being tested, &quot;lie detector&quot; examiners ask questions that purposely
embarrass, frighten and humiliate workers.  An ACLU lawsuit in l987
revealed that state employees in North Carolina were routinely asked to
answer such questions as &quot;When was the last time you unintentionally
exposed yourself after drinking?&quot; and &quot;Who was the last child that got you
sexy?&quot; Polygraphs have been used by unscrupulous employers to harass union
organizers and whistle-blowers, to coerce employees into &quot;confessing&quot;
infractions they did not commit, and to falsely implicate fellow
employees.
</p>
<p>For all of the above reasons, the ACLU strongly supported passage of the
Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 (EPPA).  As a result of the new
law, most employees will no longer be forced to endure a humiliating and
invasive process or have their jobs jeopardized by a machine that does
not work.
</p>
<p>Here are the ACLU's answers to some questions frequently asked by the
public about &quot;lie detector&quot; testing and their rights under the new law.
</p>
<h3>Q: What does the Employee Polygraph Protection Act do?
</h3>
<p>A: The EPPA, with some exceptions, prohibits the use of &quot;lie detectors&quot; by
private sector employers involved in or affecting interstate commerce.  In
the law, the term &quot;lie detector&quot; includes polygraphs, deceptographs, voice
stress analyzers and &quot;any other similar device that is used...for the
purpose of rendering a diagnostic opinion regarding the honesty or
dishonesty of an individual.&quot; The ban applies to all random, and most
pre-employment, testing and will eliminate about 80 percent of the testing
done in the private sector in the past.  The EPPA does not prohibit drug
tests or written honesty tests.
</p>
<p>Under the EPPA, employers may not require, request, suggest or cause any
employee or applicant to submit to a &quot;lie detector&quot; test, nor may they
discharge, discipline or discriminate against any employee or job
applicant for refusing to take such a test, for &quot;failing&quot; such a test, or
for filing a complaint or exercising any other rights conferred by the
legislation.  The EPPA also requires employers to post a notice informing
employees of the Act's provisions in a conspicuous place at the work
site.
</p>
<h3>Q: Are there any exceptions to the ban on &quot;lie detectors&quot;?
</h3>
<p>A: Yes.  The EPPA permits &quot;lie detector&quot; testing in certain circumstances:
<ul>
<li>The Act permits &quot;lie detector&quot; testing of federal, state and local
government employees.<br>
<li>The federal government may administer &quot;lie detector&quot; tests to certain
government contractors engaged in national security-related activities.<br>
<li>Private security firms and companies that manufacture and distribute
pharmaceuticals are permitted to test certain job applicants.<br>
<li>Any employer may administer &quot;lie detector&quot; tests in connection with an
ongoing investigation of an economic loss or injury to his/her business on
these conditions: The employee under suspicion must have had access to the
property, and the employer must state in writing the basis for a
reasonable suspicion that the employee was guilty.
</ul>
<p>Department of Labor regulations, which can be obtained from your local
Wage and Hour Division of the U. S. Department of Labor, explain in detail
what categories of employees or potential employees can be tested and
under what circumstances.
</p>
<h3>Q: Does the EPPA protect those employees it permits to be tested from the 
worst abuses and misuses of the &quot;lie detector&quot; test?
</h3>
<p>A: Yes, even those employees the EPPA allows to be tested are afforded a wide
range of rights.  Under the Act, the results of the &quot;lie detector&quot; test
cannot be the sole basis for an employer's action against an employee. 
Secondly, during all phases of the testing, the employee is granted the right: 
<ul>
<li>to stop the test at any time,<br>
<li>not to be asked questions in a degrading or needlessly intrusive manner,<br>
<li>not to be asked questions about beliefs, opinions or affiliations in
the areas of religion, racial matters, politics, sexual behavior, or the
lawful activities of labor organizations,<br>
<li>to decline to take the test based on evidence that a medical or 
psychological condition might cause abnormal test responses.
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, before the test is administered, the employee to be tested
must be given the following information in writing: 1) the date, time and
location of the test, and notice of the right to consult with legal
counsel or an employee representative before each phase of the test; 2) a
list of all questions to be asked during the test; 3) the nature and
characteristics of the tests and of the instruments involved; 4) the
design of the testing area -- whether it has a two-way mirror, a camera,
or any other device through which the test can be observed; 5) notice
that either the employee or the employer may, with the other's knowledge
and consent, make a recording of the test.
</p>
<p>During the test, the examiner may not pose any questions that were not
presented in writing to the employee before the test.  And after the
test, before any adverse action can be taken, the employer must further
interview the employee on the basis of the test results and provide him or
her with a written copy of the test results.
</p>
<h3>Q: Who has access to &quot;lie detector&quot; test results?
</h3>
<p>A: The EPPA prohibits the disclosure of test results to anyone other than the
employer who ordered the test, the employee, a court, government agency,
arbitrator or mediator pursuant to court order.  Moreover, old test
results cannot be divulged to a prospective employer.
</p>
<h3>Q: What effect does the EPPA have on existing state and local laws?
</h3>
<p>A: More restrictive state laws or collective bargaining agreements will take
precedence over the new federal law.  For information about the law in
your state or city, contact your local ACLU office -- we are listed in the
telephone directory.  Detailed questions may be addressed to your local
Wage and Hiring Division of the U. S. Department of Labor.
</p>
<h3>Q: How can I assert my rights under the EPPA?
</h3>

<p>A:: Your rights as an employee under the EPPA can be asserted and enforced in
two ways: through legal action brought by the Secretary of Labor, or
through a private lawsuit initiated by you as a wronged employee or
prospective employee.
</p>
<p>The Secretary of Labor is the federal official in charge of implementing
and enforcing the EPPA.  On being notified by you of a violation of the
Act, the Secretary can bring an action in federal court for injunctive
relief and civil penalties.  If the Secretary's case is proved, the court
may order the offending employer to stop the unlawful use of &quot;lie
detector&quot; tests, and to reinstate you with back pay.  The court may also
fine the employer up to $10,000.  The U. S. Department of Labor has
regional offices throughout the country to which you can report an abuse,
and they are listed in the telephone directory.
</p>
<p>The EPPA also authorizes private civil actions in state or federal court,
but such a legal action must be filed within three years of the alleged
violation.  If you win a lawsuit, the employer must reinstate or hire you
with back pay, as may have to pay f or your costs and legal fees.  If you
are contemplating bringing a lawsuit, call your local ACLU for advice.
</p>
<h3>Q: Since the EPPA does not cover government employees, what protection do
they 
have from &quot;lie detector&quot; abuse?
</h3>
<p>A: Government employees have not been subjected to &quot;lie detector&quot; tests to
the same extent as private sector employees; 98 percent of the estimated
two million &quot;lie detector&quot; tests given each year in the recent past were
administered in the private sector.  Government employees are less likely
to be asked to take such tests because they are protected by civil service
rules, by the constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable searches
and self-incrimination, and by state laws in some states.  These 
protections, however, are not as complete as those afforded by the 
EPPA.  The ACLU continues to lobby Congress to extend EPPA protections to 
government employees, and to represent those employees in court against &quot;lie
detector&quot; abuse.
</p>
<h3>Q: If employers cannot use &quot;lie detectors,&quot; what can they do to combat
employee dishonesty and theft?
</h3>
<p>A: First of all, there is no convincing evidence that widespread use of &quot;lie
detector&quot; tests in the workplace actually reduced dishonesty and theft. 
Those states that restricted &quot;lie detector&quot; testing for a number of years
do not have a higher rate of employee theft than states that allowed it.
</p>
<p>Second, employers have a variety of alternative techniques at their
disposal that are not overly intrusive.  They can do what good managers
have been doing all along -- check references before hiring, maintain good security and inventory controls and, above all, treat workers fairly.

<title>Lifestyle Discrimination</title>

<h2> Lifestyle Discrimination in the Workplace:<br>
    Your Right to Privacy Under Attack
</h2>
<hr width=80%>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>The word &quot;privacy&quot; means many different things to different people. One
widely accepted meaning, however, is the right to be left alone.  The framers
of our Constitution and Bill of Rights certainly embraced that meaning,
especially with regard to the sanctity of  family life.  This cherished right
is now under attack, but the government is not the primary culprit.  Private
employers are using the power of the paycheck to tell their employees what
they can and cannot do in the privacy of their own homes.  The American Civil
Liberties Union believes that what a person does during non-working hours
away from the workplace should not be the basis for discrimination.
</p>
<h3>Q: What causes employers to engage in lifestyle discrimination?
</h3>
<p>A: The driving force behind this trend is economics, in particular the rising
cost of health care benefits provided by employers.  Health care costs for
employers are increasing almost three times as fast as inflation.  Several
factors are contributing to the high cost of health insurance, but the only
factor employers have substantial control over is their employees.  Under the
pressure of economic considerations, employers may very well try to regulate
every health-related aspect of their employees' lives, including diet,
hobbies, sleep habits and even childbearing.
</p>
<h3>Q: Who is affected by lifestyle discrimination?
</h3>
<p>A: Several groups have been targeted by employers and subjected to
discriminatory practices, both on the job and during pre-employment
screening.  Those most frequently discriminated against are smokers and
people who are overweight.  A 1988 survey taken by the Administrative
Management Society revealed that six percent of employers (about 6,000
companies) were discriminating against off-duty smokers.  That figure has
almost certainly risen.  It is more difficult to quantify the number of
companies who discriminate against overweight people because this is seldom
an official corporate policy, but the evidence suggests that such
discrimination is at least as common.  Other targeted groups are: people with
hypertension or high serum cholesterol levels, social drinkers, sports
enthusiasts and, potentially, people who are genetically prone to contracting
certain debilitating diseases.
</p>
<h3>Q: Why shouldn't employers be allowed to keep their costs down by hiring
employees who won't generate high medical bills?
</h3>
<p>A: Employers' desire to keep their health care insurance costs down is
understandable, but it is unclear that employers can save much by engaging in
lifestyle discrimination.  For example, the Bureau of National Affairs
reported in 1987 that 95 percent of companies that banned smoking reported no
financial savings.  Furthermore, even if there were significant savings, the
price would be too high.  To permit such discrimination allows, in effect,
the banning of  perfectly capable workers from any type of employment --
thus, denying them the opportunity to earn a living for themselves and their
families.  Permitting employers to act as &quot;health police&quot; will not solve our
nation's health care crisis; it will only destroy the private lives of
working Americans.
</p>
<h3>Q: Why shouldn't employers be able to restrict their employees' &quot;high-risk&quot;
activities?
</h3>
<p>A: Virtually every lifestyle choice we make has some health-related
consequence. 
Where do we draw the line as to what an employer can regulate?  Should an
employer be able to forbid an employee from going skiing? or riding a
bicycle? or sunbathing on a Saturday afternoon?  All of these activities
entail a health risk.  The real issue here is the right of individuals to
lead the lives they choose.  It is very important that we preserve the
distinction between company time and the sanctity of an employee's private
life.  Employers should not be permitted to regulate our lives 24 hours a
day, seven days a week.
</p>
<h3>Q: Can't employers just charge a premium to employees whose activities raise
the cost of health insurance?
</h3>
<p>A: Often, an employer claims to be charging &quot;unhealthy&quot; employees a premium
over
the &quot;normal&quot; rate, while some employers claim to be giving their &quot;healthy&quot;
employees a discounted rate.  Either way, however, some employees are
required to pay more for health insurance than others.
</p>
<p>This may not be wrong in principle, but the employer should be able to
justify surcharges imposed on an employee whose lifestyle is deemed
&quot;unhealthy&quot; with sound actuarial data.  The employer should be able to
demonstrate that an employee's behavior increases the employer's health care
costs by a measurable amount.  The employer should also be required to show
that the surcharge is not discriminatory -- that is, does not fall
disproportionately on racial minorities or other protected groups.
</p>
<h3>Q: What is the ACLU doing about it?
</h3>
<p>A. The ACLU has found that state legislation is the best method for
protecting
workers' private lives.  Two states have already passed comprehensive laws
against lifestyle discrimination, and 21 other states have laws that provide
partial protection.  Our goal is the enactment, _in every state_, of statutes
that protect all working Americans from discrimination based on their off-
duty activities.
</p>
<h3>Q: Isn't this creating a &quot;civil right&quot; to drink and smoke?
</h3>
<p>A: Not at all.  The ACLU does not oppose smoking bans in public buildings, in
the workplace or in locations where non-smokers may be subjected to secondary
smoke.  We object only to bans on smoking, drinking, diet and hobbies in a
person's own home.
</p>
<h3>Q: Isn't the ACLU just fronting for the tobacco lobby?
</h3>
<p>A: No.  Lifestyle discrimination legislation is supported by a wide variety
of
civil rights groups and labor organizations, as well as by a majority of
Americans.  A 1992 National Consumers League poll showed that 84 percent of
Americans believe that an employer does not have the right to refuse to hire
an overweight person.  Ninety-three percent believe that an employer does not
have the right to base employment decisions on whether an employee smokes
after work, and ninety-six percent say it is inappropriate to base employment
decisions on whether a person drives a motorcycle.

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">WORKPLACE DRUG TESTING</H1>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION BRIEFER</H3>
<P>Today, in many industries, drug tests have become as routine as filling out
a job application &#151; even though the vast majority of the workers tested are
not suspected of drug use.</P>
<P>According to the American Management Association, the number of companies
with drug testing programs increased by more than 300 percent between 1987 and
1994. Millions of American workers are tested yearly.</P>
<P>Random drug testing is pervasive, but is it fair? Are the tests accurate? Do
they deter or prevent drug use? The ACLU's answer to all three questions is: no.
</P>
<P>Employers have the right to expect their employees not to be high, drunk or
asleep on the job. But they should not have the right to require employees who
are not suspected of using drugs, to prove their innocence by providing a urine
specimen on demand.</P>
<P>THAT IS NOT THE AMERICAN WAY.</P>
<HR>
<H3>DRUG TESTING IS AN INVASION OF THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY</H3>
<P>However routine such tests have become, a drug test is still a search &#151;
and searches raise privacy concerns. First, the specimen collection process
itself often involves direct or indirect observation to prevent tampering by the
employee. Direct observation involves the presence of a monitor during the act
of urination. One employee described her ordeal:</P>

<P><BR>&quot;I was given a container in which to urinate. I waited for the
attendant to turn her back before pulling down my pants, but she told me she had
to watch everything I did. I am a forty-year-old mother of three: nothing I have
ever done in my life equals or deserves the humiliation, degradation and
mortification I felt.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Even indirect observation can be degrading. Typically, employees must remove
all outer garments, and urinate into a toilet where the water supply has been
turned off. </P>
<P>A second search takes place in the lab. Urine analysis reveals not only the
presence of illegal drug by products, but also many other physical and medical
conditions &#151; medication for hypertension, epilepsy or diabetes; a genetic
predisposition to heart disease or cancer; pregnancy. In fact, at the time of
the drug test, employees are usually required to fill out forms listing all of
the medications they are currently taking &#151;a clear invasion of privacy.</P>

<P><BR>In the late 1980s, the Washington, D.C. police department admitted that
it routinely subjected urine specimens taken for drug tests from female police
officers and other female employees to pregnancy testing as well &#151; without
the employees' knowledge or consent. </P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>THERE IS NO WORKPLACE DRUG EPIDEMIC</H3>
<P>Claims of billions of dollars lost in productivity every year due to
employee drug use are based on media exaggeration and guesswork, not on
empirical evidence. </P>
<P>Drug abuse in the workplace affects a relatively small percentage of
workers: in 1987 &#151; the decade in which most drug testing programs were
established &#151; only eight percent of all adults (age 26 and older) reported
using drugs during the previous month. The percentage of adults who used drugs
in the workplace was much lower. </P>
<P>A 1994 National Academy of Sciences report concluded that &quot;illicit
drugs have never been used at work by a large proportion of the work force.&quot;
The report found workplace drug use &quot;ranges from a modest to a moderate
extent,&quot; and noted that much of reported drug use &quot;may be single
incidents, perhaps even at events like office parties.&quot;</P>
<H3>DRUG TESTS MAKE MISTAKES</H3>
<P>Although urine testing technology is improving, it's still faulty. Sometimes
the laboratory accidentally switches samples; sometimes the equipment is not
clean, sometimes the test itself fails to distinguish between legal and illegal
substances. Depronil, a prescription drug used to treat Parkinson's Disease,
shows up as amphetamine on the standard drug test. Over-the-counter,
anti-inflammatory drugs like Ibuprofen have shown up positive on the marijuana
test. Even the poppy seeds found in baked goods can produce a positive result &#151;
wrongly suggesting morphine, opium or heroin use.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>Even a small margin of error translates into a substantial number of
injustices. If one million tests are performed in a year (a conservative
estimate), and .05 percent of those tests yield false positive results (also a
conservative estimate), that translates into 50,000 mistakes &#151; people who
may be fired from their jobs, or not offered jobs for which they are qualified.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>DRUG TESTS AREN'T WORK RELATED</H3>
<P>Random drug tests are also unfair because they're not work-related.
Urinalysis does not and cannot measure impairment on the job. Unlike a
breathelyzer test for alcohol, a positive test for, say, cocaine only reveals
that a drug was ingested at some time in the past. It doesn't show when or how
much of the drug was taken. Nor does it distinguish between occasional or
habitual use.</P>
<P>Drug testing is designed to detect and punish conduct that is usually
engaged in off-duty and off the employer's premises &#151; that is, in private.
Employers who conduct random drug tests on workers who are not suspected of
using drugs are policing private behavior that has no impact on job performance.</P>
<H3>SAFETY TESTING FOR PILOTS, TRAIN ENGINEERS AND TRUCK DRIVERS</H3>
<P>It may seem logical to test transportation workers, but it isn't. First,
employee impairment due to on-duty drug use in safety sensitive jobs is
extremely rare. Never has a commercial airline accident been traced to a pilot
under the influence of drugs. And ironically, in one of those rare cases where
an accident was related to drug impairment &#151; the fatal 1994 collision of
two Amtrak trains in Maryland &#151;  good management supervision would have
been a wiser approach than drug testing. The National Transportation Safety
Board determined the train engineer had a long and well-known history of alcohol
abuse. Had his supervisors adequately observed his behavior on the morning of
the crash, they could have removed him from service &#151; and saved 16 lives.
Obviously, drug tests after the fact cannot prevent accidents, nor do random
tests prevent accidents since they don't address the specific problem a
particular employee might have.</P>
<H3>WORKPLACE DRUG TESTING PROGRAMS DON'T DETER DRUG USE</H3>
<P>A decade of testing has failed to prove its value as a deterrent. After an
exhaustive review of the scientific literature, the National Academy of Sciences
found &quot;there is as yet no conclusive scientific evidence from properly
controlled studies that employment drug-testing programs widely discourage drug
use or encourage rehabilitation.&quot;</P>

<P>Computer-assisted performance tests measure impairment in hand-eye
coordination and response time. Performance tests reveal if someone is unfit for
work, whether the problem is substance abuse, fatigue or physical illness. For
years, NASA has tested astronauts and pilots with this method, but it is still
not widely used.</P>
<P>Employee assistance programs (EAPs) help employees experiencing temporary
emotional, health, financial or substance abuse problems that affect job
performance.  Company supervisors refer troubled employees to the EAP counselors
who decide what type of intervention is needed: EAP staff support, referral to
inpatient treatment, attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous
meetings, etc.  In this context, counselors might recommend periodic urinalysis
with the employee's consent as one way of keeping him or her &quot;clean.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>STATES THAT PROTECT EMPLOYEES FROM RANDOM DRUG TESTING</H3>
<P>Only a handful of states, Montana, Iowa, Vermont and Rhode Island, ban
testing that is not based on individualized suspicion. Minnesota, Maine and
Connecticut permit not-for-cause testing, but only of employees in
safety-sensitive positions. These laws also require confirmation testing, lab
certification and test result confidentiality. Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland,
Nebraska, Oregon and Utah regulate drug testing in some fashion; laws in Florida
and Kansas protect government employees' rights, but not those in the private
sector. Only in California, Massachusetts and New Jersey have the highest courts
ruled against some forms of drug testing on state constitutional or statutory
grounds. However, the vast majority of U.S. workers cannot refuse a drug test
without risk of losing their jobs. </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><BR><FONT SIZE="+3">IS DRUG TESTING CONSTITUTIONAL?</FONT></P>
<P>Unfortunately, the courts have not always agreed with the ACLU's position
that random workplace drug testing is an unconstitutional violation of the right
to privacy. </P>
<P>In 1989, after several years of conflicting decisions in federal courts, the
U.S. Supreme Court issued its first rulings on the drug testing of government
employees. One case reviewed the post-accident testing of railway workers,
including workers not directly implicated in the accident; a second case
involved the random testing of U.S. Customs Service officers.  Although the
Court conceded that urinalysis is a search under the Fourth Amendment, it held
that because of the country's drug problem &#151; and because these particular
employees were in &quot;safety sensitive&quot; occupations &#151; the government
had a &quot;special need&quot; that outweighed employees' privacy rights.</P>
<P>Today, employees who are engaged directly in transportation work, carry a
weapon, have access to highly classified information, or hold some other &quot;
safety sensitive&quot; position, can be subject to drug testing without cause.</P>
<P>Since the Fourth Amendment doesn't apply to private companies, private
sector employees and job applicants have even less legal protection than their
public sector counterparts. Lawsuits based on state constitutions and statutes
have produced mixed results. For the most part, unless restricted by a
collective bargaining agreement, private employers have almost unlimited
authority to implement drug testing programs in their workplaces.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>The ACLU, along with other privacy advocates and many labor unions, combats
unfair workplace drug testing on many fronts &#151; in the courts, in Congress
and state legislatures, and in the arena of public opinion. This briefer is just

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">ELECTRONIC MONITORING</H1>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION BRIEFER</H3>
<P>Employers love to keep tabs on their workers. A 1996 survey conducted by the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign showed that 67% of the Fortune 500
companies surveyed used investigative services to collect or verify personnel
information. Not all workplaces need call on the help of outside investigators
to track employees, however: stunning technological advances over the past
decade have made it affordable and effortless for companies to keep an
unblinking eye on their workers, from punch in to quitting time.</P>
<P>Workplace technology is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it is a boon that
helps workers do their jobs faster and more efficiently and an aid to management
who can strategize and allocate resources for increased productivity. But too
often, the ever-improving technology only serves to surveil, intimidate and
disempower workers, reducing them to mere task-fulfilling machines. At the same
time, technology frustrates management's goals by creating a hostile climate
that undermines the very productivity it is supposed to promote.</P>
<P>THAT IS NOT THE AMERICAN WAY.</P>
<HR>
<H3>HOW EMPLOYERS MONITOR THEIR WORKERS</H3>
<P>With the partial exception of personal oral communication, employees have no
rights to privacy at work. Employers can read workers' e-mail, videotape them,
read personal items on computers and even eavesdrop on some phone calls, without
the workers' consent &#151; or knowledge.</P>
<P>Wireless and digital <I>surveillance systems</I>  allow for secret video
and audio monitoring. <I>Keystroke monitoring</I> measures employee activity
and idle time.
<I>Headphones</I> and <I>audio monitors</I> can record every word an employee
utters: official business, side comments made to neighboring workers, or even to
oneself. <I>Data storage systems</I> on computer hard drives as well as e-mail
and voice mail can store information an employee thinks has been deleted.
Sophisticated <I>infrared technology</I> even lets companies track an
employee's whereabouts in the office.</P>
<H3>MONITORING IS LEGAL COMPANY POLICY</H3>
<P>Constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure apply in
government, but not private sector workplaces.  Whether employers are benevolent
and enlightened concerning workers' privacy or tyrannical and invasive is up to
them, except in those few states where legislation has been passed protecting
privacy. Whatever the policy, companies should inform their workers, through
employee handbooks or memos, of their information collecting procedures, and how
this information is used. However, under current law, a company is not required
to do so.</P>
<H3>MONITORING IS A PRIVACY ISSUE</H3>
<P>Electronic monitoring of employees is a privacy issue because it often goes
beyond legitimate management concerns and ends up undermining workers' dignity.
Recently, postal workers in New York City were horrified to discover their
employers had installed video cameras in the restroom stalls. Female workers at
a large northeastern department store discovered a hidden video camera installed

<P>Besides enabling such invasions of an individual's most intimate privacy,
electronic monitoring can be exerted as a means of control over employees. Quite
frequently an employee doesn't know he or she has been monitored &#151; and only
finds out during an evaluation or disciplinary proceeding. Employees typically
do not have access to the data collected electronically nor the means to correct
misleading or faulty information. They also may have no control over which third
parties, such as creditors, insurance agencies and landlords   are made privy to
their personal data by their employer.</P>

<P>Although the 1986 Electronic Communication Privacy Act (an amendment of
Title II of the 1968 Omnibus Control and Safe Streets Act) prohibits employers
from eavesdropping on employees' personal calls, there is no restriction on the
amount of time it takes to determine if the call is personal or not: within that
unspecified time, often up to five minutes,  a listener can hear a lot of
information both the employee and the other person on the line might prefer to
keep private! And there are no legal means to limit how often an employer can
listen in on a worker's phone calls.</P>
<H3>ELECTRONIC MONITORING AFFECTS ALL EMPLOYEES</H3>
<P>While electronic monitoring methods are often associated with the clerical,
service and support positions that rely heavily on computer and telephone
equipment, professionals are just as vulnerable to the unblinking eye of the
technological monitor. Because e-mail and voice mail technology allow for
indefinite data storage, an employee can not be sure private information
transmitted electronically will not fall under a supervisor's scrutiny at a
later date. </P>
<H3>MONITORING NEGATIVELY AFFECTS EMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY</H3>
<P>While it is difficult to calculate the extent to which employee absenteeism,
illness or job-related stress is caused by the presence of electronic workplace
monitoring, employees who already work under stressful conditions experience
diminished productivity when they feel &quot;Big Brother&quot; is watching. It
is not surprising that countries like Japan, Germany and Sweden, who do not use
secret monitoring, provide service, quality and productivity that are among the
best in the world. Many enlightened corporations in the United States who place
a premium on employee comfort and satisfaction benefit from high productivity
and low turnover rates. Unfortunately, there are many companies who do not
choose to adopt such policies. </P>
<H3>HOW EMPLOYEES CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES</H3>
<P>Given the fact that employers listen in on more than 400 million calls a
year and the sharp increase in the use of electronic surveillance equipment, it
is wise to be prudent when on company time. Some employers designate specific
telephones for personal use only, which under the 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and
Safe Streets Act cannot be monitored. However, it is sound advice for employees
to avoid writing, saying, or sending any electronic correspondence that they
would not wish to be seen or heard by their co-workers or supervisors. Legally
enforceable rights against electronic monitoring can exist only where companies
adopt a policy against electronic monitoring &#151; either by voluntary internal
decision or under the mandate of new state laws.</P>

<P>Only a fraction of the American workforce is protected from secret
electronic monitoring.  With the exception of Connecticut, which does not allow
monitoring &quot;in areas designated for the health or personal comfort of
employees,&quot; not a single state legislature has enacted protective
legislation.  A federal bill which would have reduced monitoring abuses, The

<P>In general, public employees have more protection against &quot;unfair&quot;
monitoring than private sector employees., especially when it comes to physical
searches of person or property.  The constitutional right to due process, which
applies only to government employees, does not prevent monitoring, but it does
confer the right to challenge dismissals, demotions or other adverse personnel
actions based on monitoring that's irrelevant to job performance, or that
targets certain workers unfairly.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
government employees, however, constituted only 16.5%   percent of the American
workforce in 1995, the last year where data was available.</P>
<P>Unionized employees may be protected from secret monitoring by their
collective bargaining agreements.  But fewer than 20 percent of the American
workforce is unionized.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>LAWS HAVE HELPED IN THE PAST</H3>
<P>During the 20th century, many labor laws were enacted to ensure that workers
are treated fairly and justly. Congress passed laws  prohibiting discrimination
against women and minorities in the private sector (Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act); and requiring a minimum wage (the Fair Labor Standards Act of
1938). Legislation has also been enacted to ensure employees' right to organize
unions (The National Labor Relations Act of 1935) and to receive prior notice of
expected plant closings (the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
of 1989). The Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 placed a sweeping ban on
the use of invasive, often faulty, employee lie detector tests. </P>
<P>Today, restrictions on electronic monitoring by employers must be enacted if
employee privacy and dignity are to be protected.</P>
<HR>
<P>The ACLU's Task Force for Civil Liberties in the Workplace (also known as
the Workplace Rights Project) runs the Campaign for Fairness in the Workplace.
This Campaign undertakes to educate the public about workplace privacy issues
and lobby for workplace privacy legislation. Because Congress and the Supreme
Court have declined to rule on the several workplace privacy issues in the past,
the ACLU is focusing on legislative change at the state level. </P>
<P>The Task Force has drafted model statutes for workplace privacy which
stipulate the rights and responsibilities of both employer and employee. The
statute on electronic monitoring recommends employers notify workers of company
monitoring practices, provide employee access to the data and the means to see
and copy reports as well as rectify incorrect or misleading information.
Likewise, the model statute also requires data collection be limited to

information relevant to work performance, curtails third-party disclosure of

data and ensures a grievance procedure for employees. </P>

<title> American Civil Liberties Union Briefing Paper Number 5</title>
<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<img src="../graphics/bphead.gif">
<h1> DRUG TESTING IN THE WORKPLACE
</h1>
<img src="../graphics/bpline.gif">
<p>There was a time in the United States when your business was also your
boss's business.  At the turn of the century, company snooping was
pervasive and privacy almost nonexistent.  Your boss had the right to know
who you lived with, what you drank, whether you went to church, or to
what political groups you belonged.  With the growth of the trade union
movement and heightened awareness of the importance of individual rights,
American workers came to insist that life off the job was their private
affair not to be scrutinized by employers.
</p>
<p>But major chinks have begun to appear in the wall that has separated life
on and off the job, largely due to the advent of new technologies that
make it possible for employers to monitor their employees' off-duty
activities.  Today, millions of American workers every year, in both the
public and private sectors, are subjected to urinalysis drug tests as a
condition for getting or keeping a job.
</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union opposes indiscriminate urine testing
because the process is both unfair and unnecessary.  It is unfair to force
workers who are not even suspected of using drugs, and whose job
performance is satisfactory, to &quot;prove&quot; their innocence through a
degrading and uncertain procedure that violates personal privacy.  Such
tests are unnecessary because they cannot detect impairment and, thus, in
no way enhance an employer's ability to evaluate or predict job
performance.
</p>
<p>Here are the ACLU's answers to some questions frequently asked by the
public about drug testing in the workplace.
</p>
<h4>Q: Don't employers have the right to expect their employees not to be high on
drugs on the job?
</h4>
<p>A: Of course they do.  Employers have the right to expect their employees not
to be high, stoned, drunk, or asleep.  Job performance is the bottom line:
If you cannot do the work, employers have a legitimate reason for firing
you.  But urine tests do not measure job performance.  Even a confirmed
&quot;positive&quot; provides no evidence of present intoxication or impairment; it
merely indicates that a person may have taken a drug at some time in the
past.
</p>

<h4>Q: Can urine tests determine precisely when a particular drug was used?
</h4>
<p>A: No. Urine tests cannot determine when a drug was used.  They can only
detect the &quot;metabolites,&quot; or inactive leftover traces of previously
ingested substances.  For example, an employee who smokes marijuana on a
Saturday night may test positive the following Wednesday, long after the
drug has ceased to have any effect.  In that case, what the employee did
on Saturday has nothing to do with his or her fitness to work on
Wednesday.  At the same time, a worker can snort cocaine on the way to
work and test negative that same morning.  That is because the cocaine has
not yet been metabolized and will, therefore, not show up in the person's
urine. 
</p>
<h4>Q: If you don't use drugs, you have nothing to hide -- so why object to
testing?
</h4>
<p> A: Innocent people do have something to hide: their private life.  The
&quot;right to be left alone&quot; is, in the words of the late Supreme Court
Justice Louis Brandeis, &quot;the most comprehensive of rights and the right
most valued by civilized men.&quot;
</p>

<p>Analysis of a person's urine can disclose many details about that person's
private life other than drug use.  It can tell an employer whether an
employee or job applicant is being treated for a heart condition,
depression, epilepsy or diabetes.  It can also reveal whether an employee
is pregnant.
</p>
<h4>Q: Are drug tests reliable?
</h4>
<p>A: No, the drug screens used by most companies are not reliable.  These tests
yield false positive results at least 10 percent, and possibly as much as
30 percent, of the time.  Experts concede that the tests are unreliable. 
At a recent conference, 120 forensic scientists, including some who
worked for manufacturers of drug tests, were asked, &quot;Is there anybody who
would submit urine for drug testing if his career, reputation, freedom or
livelihood depended on it?&quot; Not a single hand was raised.
</p>
<p>Although more accurate tests are available, they are expensive and
infrequently used.  And even the more accurate tests can yield inaccurate
results due to laboratory error.  A survey by the National Institute of
Drug Abuse, a government agency, found that 20 percent of the labs
surveyed mistakenly reported the presence of illegal drugs in drug-free
urine samples.  Unreliability also stems from the tendency of drug screens
to confuse similar chemical compounds.  For example, codeine and Vicks
Formula 44-M have been known to produce positive results for heroin, Advil
for marijuana, and Nyquil for amphetamines.
</p>
<h4>Q: Still, isn't universal testing the best way to catch drug users?
</h4>
<p>A: Such testing may be the easiest way to identify drug users, but it is also
by far the most un-American.  Americans have traditionally believed that
general searches of innocent people are unfair.  This tradition began in
colonial times, when King George's soldiers searched everyone
indiscriminately in order to uncover those few people who were committing
offenses against the Crown.  Early Americans deeply hated these general
searches, which were a leading cause of the Revolution.
</p>
<p>After the Revolution, when memories of the experience with warrantless
searches were still fresh, the Fourth Amendment was adopted.  It says that
the government cannot search everyone to find the few who might be guilty
of an offense.  The government must have good reason to suspect a
particular person before subjecting him or her to intrusive body searches. 
These longstanding principles of fairness should also apply to the private
sector, even though the Fourth Amendment only applies to government
action.
</p>
<p>Urine tests are body searches, and they are an unprecedented invasion of
privacy.  The standard practice, in administering such tests, is to
require employees to urinate in the presence of a witness to guard against
specimen tampering.  In the words of one judge, that is &quot;an experience
which even if courteously supervised can be humiliating and degrading.&quot;
Noted a federal judge, as he invalidated a drug-testing program for
municipal fire-fighters, &quot;Drug testing is a form of surveillance, albeit a
technological one.&quot;
</p>
<h4>Q: But shouldn't exceptions be made for certain workers, such as airline
pilots, who are responsible for the lives of others?
</h4>
<p>A: Obviously, people who are responsible for others' lives should be held to
high standards of job performance.  But urine testing will not help
employers do that because it does not detect impairment.
</p>
<p>If employers in transportation and other industries are really concerned
about the public's safety, they should abandon imperfect urine testing and
test performance instead.  Computer-assisted performance tests already
exist and, in fact, have been used by NASA for years on astronauts and
test pilots.  These tests can actually measure hand-eye coordination and
response time, do not invade people's privacy, and can improve safety far
better than drug tests can.
</p>
<h4>Q: Drug use costs industry millions in lost worker productivity each year.  
Don't employers have a right to test as a way of protecting their investment?
</h4>
<p>A: Actually, there are no clear estimates about the economic costs to
industry resulting from drug use by workers.  Proponents of drug testing
claim the costs are high, but they have been hard pressed to translate
that claim into real figures.  And some who make such claims are
manufacturers of drug tests, who obviously stand to profit from
industry-wide urinalysis.  In any event, employers have better ways to
maintain high productivity, as well as to identify and help employees with
drug problems.  Competent supervision, professional counseling and
voluntary rehabilitation programs may not be as simple as a drug test, but
they are a better investment in America.
</p>
<p>Our nation's experience with cigarette smoking is a good example of what
education and voluntary rehabilitation can accomplish.  Since 1965, the
proportion of Americans who smoke cigarettes has gone down from 43 percent
to 32 percent.  This dramatic decrease was a consequence of public
education and the availability of treatment on demand.  Unfortunately,
instead of adequately funding drug clinics and educational programs, the
government has cut these services so that substance abusers sometimes have
to wait for months before receiving treatment.
</p>
<h4>Q: Have any courts ruled that mandatory urine testing of government employees
is a violation of the Constitution?
</h4>
<p>A: Yes.  Many state and federal courts have ruled that testing programs in
public workplaces are unconstitutional if they are not based on some kind
of individualized suspicion.  Throughout the country, courts have struck
down programs that randomly tested police officers, fire-fighters,
teachers, civilian army employees, prison guards and employees of many
federal agencies.  The ACLU and public employee unions have represented
most of these victorious workers.
</p>
<p>In Washington, D.C., for example, one federal judge had this to say about
a random drug testing program that would affect thousands of government
employees: &quot;This case presents for judicial consideration a wholesale
deprivation of the most fundamental privacy rights of thousands upon
thousands of loyal, law-abiding citizens....&quot;
</p>
<p>In 1989, for the first time, the U. S. Supreme Court ruled on the
constitutionality of testing government employees not actually suspected
of drug use.  In two cases involving U. S. Customs guards and railroad
workers, the majority of the Court held that urine tests are searches, but
that these particular employees could be tested without being suspected
drug users on the grounds that their Fourth Amendment right to privacy was
outweighed by the government's interest in maintaining a drug-free
workplace.
</p>
<p>Although these decisions represent a serious setback, the Court's ruling
does not affect all government workers, and the fight over the
constitutionality of testing is far from over.
</p>
<h4>Q: If the Constitution can't help them, how can private employees protect 
themselves against drug testing?
</h4>
<p>A: Court challenges to drug testing programs in private workplaces are
underway throughout the country.  These lawsuits involve state
constitutional and statutory laws rather than federal constitutional law. 
Some are based on common law actions that charge specific, intentional
injuries; others are breach of contract claims.  Some have been
successful, while others have failed.  Traditionally, employers in the
private sector have extremely broad discretion in personnel matters.
</p>
<p>In most states, private sector employees have virtually no protection
against drug testing's intrusion on their privacy, unless they belong to a
union that has negotiated the prohibition or restriction of workplace
testing.  One exception to this bleak picture is California, in which the
state constitution specifies a right to privacy that applies, not only to
government action, but to actions by private business as well.
</p>

<p>In addition to California, seven states have enacted protective legislation
that restricts drug testing in the private workplace and gives employees
some measure of protection from unfair and unreliable testing: Montana,
Iowa, Vermont and Rhode Island have banned all random or blanket drug
testing of employees (that is, testing without probable cause or
reasonable suspicion), and Minnesota, Maine and Connecticut permit random
testing only of employees in &quot;safety sensitive&quot; positions.  The laws in
these states also mandate confirmatory testing, use of certified
laboratories, confidentiality of test results and other procedural
protections.  While they are not perfect, these new laws place significant
limits on employers' otherwise unfettered authority to test and give
employees the power to resist unwarranted invasions of privacy.
</p>

<p>The ACLU will continue to press other states to pass similar statutes and
to lobby the U.S. Congress to do the same.

<title>'95 Review by The Bill of Rights </title>

<center>
<H2>Review of 1994 Court Term - By the Amendments</H2></CENTER>
<center>
<H3>FIRST AMENDMENT</H3>
</center>
<h4> Freedom of Expression</h4>

In United States v. National Treasury Employees Union, 63
U.S.L.W. 4133 (Feb. 22, 1995)(6-3), the Court struck down a
federal ethics law that, among other things, prohibited all
federal employees from accepting any "honoraria" for any speech,
article or appearance, whether or not it was related to their job
responsibilities.  In an important passage, the majority held
that a broad prophylactic rule affecting the free speech rights
of more than 1.7 million people must be supported by more than
speculation, even in the public employment context.  The Court
also reaffirmed its prior holding that a restriction on payment
for speech is a restriction on speech itself and, therefore,
triggers First Amendment scrutiny.  The dissenters argued that a
"nexus" requirement should be read into the statute.  The
majority, however, concluded, that it was up to Congress to
rewrite the statute as it saw fit.  The ACLU was co-counsel for
plaintiffs challenging the statute.
<P>
In McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 63 U.S.L.W. 4279
(April 19, 1995)(7-2), the Court invalidated a Ohio law that
banned the distribution of any anonymous campaign literature. 
The law was challenged in this case by an Ohio parent who had
been fined $100 for distributing anonymous fliers in opposition
to a proposed school tax referendum.  Writing for the majority,
Justice Stevens noted the long tradition of anonymous political
literature including, most notably, the Federalist Papers.  The
majority then rejected the state's argument that it should be
given greater latitude in regulating campaign literature than
other forms of political speech.  To the contrary, Justice
Stevens wrote, &quot;[n]o form of speech is entitled to greater
constitutional protection than Mrs. McIntyre's.&quot;  Id. at 4283. 
Finally, the Court held that the state's interest in preventing
fraud and libel, while legitimate, were insufficient to justify
the statute's &quot;extremely broad prohibition.&quot;  Id. at 4284.  The
ACLU represented petitioner in the Supreme Court.
<P>
In Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 63 U.S.L.W. 4319 (April 19,
1995)(9-0), the Court unanimously ruled that a 1935 federal
statute that prohibits any mention of alcoholic content on beer
labels violates the First Amendment.  Applying its familiar
commercial speech test, the Court held that the challenged
statute did not directly advance its asserted interest in
limiting strength wars because of &quot;the overall irrationality of
the government's regulatory scheme,&quot; id. at 4323.  The Court
further noted that the restriction on beer labels &quot;is not
sufficiently tailored to its goal,&quot; id., since the government
could, if it chose, directly limit the alcoholic content of beer. 
In an important footnote, the Court rejected the notion that the
government has greater latitude in regulating commercial speech
about social harmful activity.  Such regulations, the Court said,
must satisfy the same standard of review as other regulations of
commercial speech.  Id. at 4321 n.2.  The Court also appeared to
back away significantly from earlier statements, most notably in
Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico,
478 U.S. 328, 346 (1986), suggesting that the government can ban
promotional advertising whenever it can ban the underlying
activity.  The decision in Coors represents the latest in a
series of recent decisions that have provided enhanced
constitutional protection for commercial speech.
<P>
In Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group
of Boston (GLIB), 63 U.S.L.W. 4625 (June 19, 1995)(9-0), a
unanimous Court held that the private sponsors of Boston's St.
Patrick's Day Parade could not be required to include a contin-
gent of gay marchers in their parade.  The Massachusetts courts
had ruled that GLIB's exclusion violated the state's public
accommodations law, which prohibits discrimination on the basis
of sexual orientation.  The Supreme Court reversed.  Writing for
the Court, Justice Souter noted that a parade is an expressive
event and that its sponsors, like any other First Amendment
speaker, have the right to determine the message they wish to
convey.  The ACLU supported the First Amendment claim of the
private sponsors in its amicus brief.  However, the ACLU also
argued that the First Amendment issues would be different if the
government had sponsored the parade, and that the question of
government sponsorship required further consideration by the
lower courts.  The Supreme Court avoided this second question by
holding that the issue of state action had not been properly
preserved.
<br> <a href="hurley.html">Summary of Argument in ACLU amicus brief</a>
<P>
In Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 63 U.S.L.W. 4644 (June
21, 1995)(5-4), the Court upheld a 30 day ban on direct mail from
lawyers to accident victims or their families.  The majority
opinion, written by Justice O'Connor, stressed the historic role
of the states in regulating the legal profession and the
heightened privacy interest of recent accident victims.  The
majority opinion also emphasized that the justification for the
Florida rule was supported by actual evidence rather than mere
speculation.<br>
<h4> The Establishment Clause</h4>
<P>
In Capitol Square Review Board v. Pinette, 63 U.S.L.W. 
(June 29, 1995)(7-2), the Court upheld the right of the Ku Klux
Klan to place a cross in a public park bordering the statehouse
in Columbus, Ohio.  As the majority noted, the park was a
traditional public forum that had long been used by residents of
Columbus for all sorts of speech activities, including the
placement of other religious displays during the holiday season. 
Under these circumstances, seven members of the Court concluded
that there was no violation of the Establishment Clause in
allowing the Klan display.  Significantly, however, five members
of the Court, reaffirmed that the appropriate Establishment
Clause question is whether a reasonable person would perceive
that the state had endorsed a religious message, expressly
rejecting the effort by four members of the Court to further
dilute the constitutional standard governing the separation
between church and state.  The ACLU supported the Klan's free
speech rights in this case.<br> <a href="pinet.html">Summary of Argument in ACLU amicus brief</a>  <BR>
<P>
In Rosenberger v. The University of Virginia, 63 U.S.L.W.
(June 29, 1995)(5-4), the Court held that a student
religious journal was entitled to the same subsidy from student
activity funds that the University provided to student secular
journals.  Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy stressed the
University's obligation to be &quot;viewpoint-neutral&quot; once it made
the decision to subsidize student speech.  As a matter of free
speech law, the ACLU shares that position.  However, our amicus
brief concluded that the Establishment Clause forbid the direct
funding of religious activity on the facts of this case.  The
majority's response was to emphasize that the funding in the case
went to the printer rather than directly to the religious
activity.  That distinction without a difference has potentially
serious consequences for future litigation over school vouchers.

<h4>Statement of the Case</h4>
<p>This case challenges the constitutionality of an injunction
issued by the Massachusetts courts requiring the South Boston
Allied War Veterans Council ("the Council"), as sponsors of the
1993 Boston St. Patrick's Day Parade, to permit an identifiable
contingent of gay and lesbian marchers to participate in the
Parade.[1] The injunction was issued by the Superior Court,
Pet.Cert. at B1-B-29, and affirmed by the Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court. Id. at C1-C26. The Massachusetts courts based
their rulings on an interpretation of the state's public
accommodations law, and a finding that the injunction would not
interfere with the Council's First Amendment rights.
</p>
 <p>    Given the heated nature of this controversy, it is ironic to
note that the St. Patrick's Day Parade began in the 19th century
as a response to efforts by nativist bigots, the "Know-Nothings,"
to exclude Irish Catholics from full participation in the July
4th Independence Day Parade.[2] The celebration of St. Patrick's
Day as an Irish-American alternative to a nativist Independence
Day was aided in Boston by the practice of linking St. Patrick's
Day to Evacuation Day, the official commemoration of George
Washington's first victory over the British during the
Revolutionary War -- his tactical use of artillery to force the
evacuation of the City of Boston in 1776.[3]
</p>
 <p>    Until 1947, the Parade was jointly organized by the South
Boston Citizens Association and the City of Boston. In 1947,
however, Mayor Curley granted the Veterans Council authority to
organize the parade, which it has done ever since. Pet.Cert. at
B8-B9. The Parade has now evolved into a massive event with over
20,000 participants and 700,000 spectators that winds through the
traditional Irish ethnic strongholds of South Boston, replete
with commercial, political and ethnic displays.
</p>
 <p>    Combining St. Patrick's Day with Evacuation Day gave the
celebration an official sanction and led to broad governmental
support for the Parade ranging from proclamations by the governor
urging the citizenry to observe the day, to intense participation
by public officials in the planning and administration of the
Parade, to actual taxpayer subsidies of the event.
</p>
 <p>    The extensive nature of the city's involvement with the St.
Patrick's Day Parade is detailed in the trial court's opinion:</p>
<dl>
     <dd>     Up through the 1992 Parade, the City provided
          the use of its official seal, printing
          services, and direct funding to participants
          and sponsors. Until 1993, the City provided
          approximately twenty-five percent of the
          Parade's total costs through the Office of
          Business and Cultural Development. The City
          also identified and contacted potential
          participants and disseminated information
          regarding the Parade.
<br>
Pet.Cert. at B17 (footnote omitted).[4]
</dl>
 <p>    Beginning in 1992, the Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bi-
sexual Group of Boston (GLIB) has sought permission each year
from the Council to march as an identifiable contingent in the
Boston Parade. That permission has been consistently denied and
GLIB has responded with a series of lawsuits.
</p>
 <p>    This litigation involves the 1993 Parade. In ruling in favor
of GLIB, the Massachusetts courts rejected the Council's argument
that forced inclusion of identifiable gay and lesbian marchers in
the St. Patrick's Day Parade was inconsistent with the message
the Parade sponsor wished to convey. Instead, the trial court
found that the 1993 Parade was not intended to convey any
coherent message. Pet.Cert. at B25.[5] Thus, the court reasoned,
the forced inclusion of gay and lesbian marchers did not pose a
significant threat to the sponsor's First Amendment rights. Id.
In the absence of such a threat, the court held that the state
public accommodations law controlled. Because state law bans
discrimination based on sexual orientation, the Massachusetts
courts ordered the Council to admit GLIB to the 1993 Parade.[6]
</p>
  <p>   As a result of this judicial action, the 1993 Parade
included a contingent of gay and lesbian marchers. When the 1993
injunction was made permanent and similar restrictions were
placed on the 1994 Parade, however, the Parade was cancelled. In
its place, the Council organized a motorcade of over 800 cars
protesting the injunction. In 1995, the Council explicitly
characterized the St. Patrick's Day Parade, which it once again
organized, as a protest against the prior decision of the
Massachusetts courts. On this basis, the Parade's sponsors
recently persuaded a United States district judge to issue
declaratory relief forbidding the City of Boston to require the
presence of gay and lesbian marchers in the sponsor's amended
version of the 1995 Parade. South Boston Allied War Veterans
Council v. The City of Boston, No 94-11402-MLW (D.Mass. January
17, 1995).
</p>
   <h4>                    Summary of Argument</h4>

<p>     This case implicates at least four sets of potentially
conflicting legal rights. First, gays and lesbians who wish to
march openly in celebration of St. Patrick's Day Parade have an
undoubted First Amendment right to assemble publicly in order to
assert that they are integral members of the Irish community.
E.g., Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496 (1939); Edwards v. South
Carolina, 372 U.S. 229 (1963); Gregory v. Chicago, 394 U.S. 111
(1969); Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147 (1969); Forsyth
County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 2395
(1992).
</p>
 <p>    Second, the Parade's sponsors have an undoubted First
Amendment right to assert that homosexuals should not be viewed
as full members of the Irish community and to resist official
pressure to say otherwise. E.g., Miami Herald Publishing Co., v.
Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974); Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705
(1977).
</p>
   <p>  Third, all parties have an undoubted First and Fourteenth
Amendment right to be treated equally by the government as
speakers regardless of their views or their sexual orientation.
E.g., Grosjean v. American Press, 297 U.S. 233 (1936); Chicago
Police Dep't v. Mosely, 408 U.S. 92 (1972).
</p>
   <p>  Finally, gays and lesbians are entitled under Boston's local
civil rights laws to nondiscriminatory access to all places of
public accommodation. Mass Gen. L. ch. 272, section 98 (1992).
</p>
   <p>  Ordinarily, the potential for conflict between and among the
parties' legal rights would be avoided by authorizing each side
to mount its own parade, with government remaining aloof except
to maintain order.[7] Here, however, separate parades and
complete governmental neutrality are evidently not practicable,
because each side vigorously maintains that inclusion in, or
exclusion from, the St. Patrick's Day celebration is essential to
its message. Since the opposing parties wish to use a unique
public forum to deliver mutually exclusive messages at the same
time, Boston has been placed in the difficult but inescapable
role of necessarily determining whose rights will prevail.
</p>
  <p>   To the extent that the Parade can appropriately be
characterized as government sponsored, the First and Fourteenth
Amendments prohibit any effort by the state to exclude marchers
because of their sexual orientation or the content of their
message. E.g., Schact v. United States, 398 U.S. 58 (1970);
Minneapolis Star & Tribune v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue, 460
U.S. 575 (1983); Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481
U.S. 221 (1987); Simon & Schuster v. New York State Crime Victims
Board, 502 U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 501, (1991). Furthermore, that
sponsorship may be formal or informal. For example, if Boston
elects to delegate perennial control over the Parade to the same
nominally private group, and supports that specially favored
group with significant state assistance, a state action finding
may well be appropriate. Of. Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co.,
500 U.S. 614 (1991); Adickes v. S.H. Kress, 398 U.S. 144 (1970);
Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461 (1953).
</p>
  <p>   On the other hand, if the Parade cannot fairly be described
as a government-sponsored event, a different set of
constitutional principles apply. Under these circumstances, the
Council's use of a traditional public forum for a parade is an
expressive event whose message is necessarily determined by the
parade's sponsors and not by the government. As an expressive
event, moreover, it follows that the parade sponsors have a
constitutional right to exclude marchers whose message conflicts
with the message the sponsors desire to convey. Cf. Wooley v.
Maynard, 430 U.S. 705; Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. Public
Utility Comm'n of California, 475 U.S. 1 (1986); West Virginia
State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943).
</p>
   <p>  While Boston may respond to a given sponsor's exclusionary
behavior by granting supplemental permits to allow excluded
marchers to organize a competing parade, once a private group has
been duly authorized to sponsor a parade, the government may
neither reject nor redefine the sponsor's message, even when the
message the sponsor wishes to convey is an ugly one of bigotry
and intolerance. Cf. R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 504 U.S. ___,
112 S.Ct. 2538 (1992).
</p>
 <p>    Thus, the lower courts erred in applying the state's public
accommodations law and rejecting the Council's First Amendment
claim if the 1993 Parade is regarded as a privately sponsored
event, as the courts below evidently assumed.[8] At the outset,
the Supreme Judicial Court should not have deferred, using the
"clearly erroneous" standard, to the factual finding of the trial
court that the Parade lacked a message. Pet.Cert. at B24, C15.
Appellate courts must exercise de novo review over the record as
a whole when a trial court's findings are contrary to the
exercise of a First Amendment right. Bose Corp. v. Consumers
Union, 466 U.S. 485 (1984).
</p>
 <p>    More fundamentally, the First Amendment demands that the
sponsors of a parade be afforded broad deference in defining the
message of their parade. When the parade's sponsors asserted an
incompatibility between their intended message and the inclusion
of a contingent of gay and lesbian marchers, the First Amendment
rights of the sponsors were on a collision course with the wishes
of the excluded marchers. Once that collision is acknowledged,
the First Amendment requires that it be resolved in favor of the
private sponsor of the parade.
</p>
 <p>    While this Court has quite properly upheld anti-
discrimination provisions that bar large multi-purpose
organizations like eating clubs, labor unions, business groups
and service organizations from denying access to women and racial
minorities, a parade is an ephemeral association whose only
purpose is communication. As with political parties, when an
association's dominant purpose is expressive, the state may not
force its members to associate against their will, especially
when such forced association would alter the desired message. See
Tashjian v. Republican Party, 479 U.S. 208 (1986). See also
Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 627 (1984), id.
at 631-38 (O'Connor, J., concurring); Democratic Party of the
United States v. Wisconsin, 450 U.S. 107, 122 (1981) (freedom to
associate for the advancement of one's views "necessarily
presupposes the freedom to identify the people who constitute the
association, and to limit the association to those people only");
Eu v. San Francisco Democratic Committee, 489 U.S. 214 (1989).
</p>
  <p>   It is not clear, however, that the courts below accurately
characterized the allegedly private nature of the sponsorship of
the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Boston. Given the erroneous
assumption of the courts below that the First Amendment rights of
a private sponsor would not be violated by forcing the inclusion
of marchers bearing an unwanted message, the Massachusetts courts
were not compelled to explore the precise nature of the Parade's
sponsorship.[9] But, if this Court rules that the First Amendment
rights of a private parade sponsor would be violated by state-
mandated inclusion of marchers bearing an unwanted message,
whether or not the sponsorship is truly private becomes an issue
of critical importance.
</p>
  <p>   Throughout its history, the Boston Parade has been closely
bound up with the simultaneous celebration of a Massachusetts
civic holiday -- Evacuation Day -- commemorating George
Washington's first victory in the Revolutionary War. Indeed,
until 1992, Boston openly granted its official imprimatur to the
celebration of the combined holiday, including (but not limited
to) a significant subsidy with taxpayer funds. The Parade's
administration has been, and remains, closely tied to the Boston
City government. Finally, for the past half-century, the permit
for the Parade has been routinely allocated to the same nominally
private sponsor. See p.2, supra.
</p><p>
     Because the nature of the Parade's sponsorship was not fully
explored below, we respectfully suggest that the case be remanded
for fact-finding and an initial legal consideration of the scope
of governmental involvement in the sponsorship and administration
of Boston's St. Patrick's Day Parade. See Smith v. Allwright, 321
U.S. 649 (1944); Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461; Edmonson v.
Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614.

<h4>Footnotes:</h4>
<p>
[1] The Question Presented for review is whether petitioners can
be compelled to including "in their privately organized Parade, a
message the petitioners deemed unwarranted and antiethical."
Pet.Cert at i.</p>
<p>
[2] Much of the history discussed in this brief is derived from
Larry W. Yackle, "Parading Ourselves: Freedom of Speech at the
Feast of St. Patrick," 73 B.U. L.Rev. 791 (1993).
</p><p>
[3] The only connection between General Washington's victory and
Irish pride was the use of "St. Patrick" as the password for the
Revolutionary troops on the crucial day.
</p><p>
[4] According to the trial court, Boston apparently provides city
assistance of this sort to other parades as well. Id.
</p><p>
[5] The trial court emphasized that the Boston Parade has been
broadly inclusive and its opinion contains a long list of civic
and commercial organizations that marched in the 1992 Parade.
Pet.Cert. at 6-7. It is also undisputed, however, that the
Council has excluded from the Parade at least two other groups in
addition to GLIB: the Ku Klux Klan and ROAR, a local anti-busing
organization. Id. at B7.
</p><p>
[6] A similar order was entered with regard to the 1992 Parade.
GLIB v. City of Boston, No. 92-1518 (Suffolk County SuperCt.
March 11, 1992)(Zobel, J.).
</p><p>
[7] For example, courts have imposed a shared access plan in
connection with sidewalk demonstrations in the vicinity of St.
Patrick's Cathedral in New York City during Gay Pride Week.
Opposing groups of 25 demonstrators alternate at 30 minute
intervals. Olivieri v. Ward, 801 F.2d 602, 607 (2d Cir.), cert.
denied, 480 U.S. 917 (1986).
</p><p>
[8] The reach of Massachusetts' public accommodations law is, of
course, solely an issue for the state courts. Only if the state
construction causes a violation of federal rights is the issue
before this Court. Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins,  447 U.S.
74 (1980).
</p><p>
[9] This Court followed a similar analytical path in Cousins v.
Wigoda, 419 U.S. 477 (1975), electing to dispose of the
substantive issue without first determining the precise status of
the parties.

<h4>                QUESTION PRESENTED FOR REVIEW
</h4>
<p>Whether the temporary, unattended display of a Ku Klux Klan cross on a
public forum open to all other political and religious expression violates
the Establishment Clause solely because the public forum is in proximity
to the seat of government. 
</p>
<h4>                      SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
</h4>
<p>     The Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment and
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to
permit the temporary unattended display of a Ku Klux Klan cross in a
traditional public forum that is open to other political and religious
symbols -- even if that forum is near the state of government -- absent
any special indicia of endorsement. 
</p>

<p>     1. The State's discriminatory refusal to permit the display of the Ku
Klux Klan cross in a traditional public forum where the State has
permitted other secular and religious symbols violates the Free Speech and
Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment. 
</p>
<p>     In this case, the State has singled out the Ku Klux Klan and has
refused to permit the Klan to display its cross in the Capitol Square
forum. The cross is symbolic of the Klan's view about politics and
religion. 
</p>
<p>     The record establishes that the denial was based upon the
controversial communication of a controversial speaker. On that record,
the State clearly discriminated among political and religious symbols.
Moreover, the discrimination was unlawfully accomplished by means of
standardless procedures permitting the exercise of unbridled discretion. 
</p>
<p>     The State's only response to the claim of discrimination is that the
Board relied upon the Establishment Clause; however, this explanation
rings hollow given the State's tolerance of other religious symbols at the
same site. 
</p>
<p>     2. Given the facts of this case, both courts below correctly held
that no reasonable observer could conclude that the Ku Klux Klan display
of its cross on the Capitol Square public forum constituted an endorsement
or appearance of endorsement of religion. 
</p>
<p>     The State erroneously insists that, because of the inherent power of
an unattended cross as a symbol, the Establishment Clause automatically
bans from the Capitol Square forum the unattended display of the Klan
cross at any location at any time under any circumstances. This flat ban
is wrong as a matter of law precisely because it forecloses consideration
of all relevant facts and circumstances. 
</p>
<p>     The State's contention that the Establishment Clause flatly bans all
symbols alleged to be &quot;purely religious&quot; precludes the application of the
&quot;reasonable observer&quot; standard set forth by this Court in County of
Allegheny v. Greater Pittsburgh ACLU, 492 U.S. 573 (1989) and followed by
the courts below. While the State claims that banning the Klan cross is
necessary to serve its interest in obeying the Establishment Clause, it
ignores its parallel obligation to fulfill the requirements of the Free
Speech and Free Exercise Clauses. These interests must be reconciled on a
case-by-case basis by use of the &quot;reasonable observer&quot; standard. 
</p>
<p>     The State fails to acknowledge that providing a public forum is not
an endorsement of the speech thereon. It also ignores the distinction,
recognized in Allegheny, between private religious expression in a public
forum and government religious expression. 
</p>
<p>     3. Privately sponsored displays of religious symbols cannot be
excluded from a quintessential public forum even at the seat of
government, absent some indicia of state endorsement. Indeed, the defining
characteristic of a public forum is that the state may not discriminate
against speech on the basis of content. 
</p>
<p>     Respondents do not quarrel with the endorsement test under the
Establishment Clause as it has been developed by this Court. But,
endorsement cannot be presumed from the mere fact of private speech in a
public forum. Yet, without this inference, there is no plausible claim of
endorsement on the facts of this case, as both lower courts found. The
judgment below should therefore be affirmed.

<h4>STATEMENT OF THE CASE
</h4>
<p>The University of Virginia recognizes and provides facilities and services
to a wide range of student activities, known as &quot;Contracted Independent
Organizations&quot; (CIOs).  Most CIOs may also apply for student activity
funds, which are derived from an annual $14 student activity fee. 
</p>
<p>&quot;The purpose of the student activity fee is to provide financial support
for student organizations that are related to the educational purpose of
the University .... [T]he monies collected by the University of funding
student activities are public funds.  The University of Virginia
recognizes and provides facilities and services to a wide range of student
activities, known as &quot;Contracted Independent Organizations&quot; (CIOs).  Most
CIOs may also apply for student activity funds, which are derived from an
annual $14 student activity fee. hich must be administered in a manner
consistent with the educational purposes of the University as well as with
State and Federal law.&quot; 
</p>
<p>-- Rosenberger v. The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia,
793 F.Supp. 175, 180 (W.D.Va. 1992), aff'd, 18 F.3d 269 (3d Cir. 1994). 
</p>
<p>Pursuant to its guidelines, however, the University does not fund either
&quot;religious organizations&quot;[2] or &quot;religious activities.&quot;[3] If a student
organization is not disqualified on religious or other grounds, and its
goals are deemed generally &quot;consistent with the educational purposes of
the University,&quot; the University then examines the group more closely,
including investigation of possible discriminatory conduct, to decide if
the group should receive funding.  J.A. 71, paragraph 8. 
</p>
<p>The plaintiffs publish a student journal called &quot;Wide Awake:  A Christian
Perspective at the University of Virginia.&quot;  Although not affiliated with
any religious institution, the journal is pervasively and concededly
sectarian: its announced purpose is &quot;to challenge Christians to live, in
word and deed, according to the faith they proclaim[,] and to encourage
students to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ
means,&quot;  Rosenberger, 18 F.3d at 272.  There is no dispute that &quot;Wide
Awake&quot; is a religious activity within the meaning of the University's
funding guidelines.  Id. at 273.  Accordingly, although it is a CIO with
access to University computers, printers, and other publication equipment,
id., its application for direct funding was denied.[4]
</p>
<p>Petitioners challenged the funding denial on free speech, free exercise,
and equal protection grounds.  The federal district court, ruling on the
cross motions for summary judgement, rejected all three claims.  793 F.
Supp. 175.  The court concluded that the student activity fund was a
nonpublic forum and the religious exclusion was reasonable and
viewpoint-neutral; that the funding denial did not substantially burden
petitioners' freedom of religion; and that no &quot;discriminatory intent&quot; was
shown with respect to alleged disparate funding of religious groups.  Id.
at 178-83.  Without fully addressing the Establishment Clause issue, the
district court did note that the University's refusal to fund religious
groups because of church-state concerns was &quot;reasonable.&quot;  Id. at 181. 
</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, but gave more
scrupulous consideration to petitioners' free speech claims.  the court of
appeals concluded that the religious exclusion was a viewpoint-based
unconstitutional condition which could be upheld only if narrowly drawn
and justified by a compelling state interest.  18 F.3d at 277-83.[5] The
Fourth Circuit held that the Establishment Clause constituted such a
compelling interest because direct government funding of religious
activities like &quot;Wide Awake&quot; would violate two of the three prongs of the
test set forth by this Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971). 
</p>
<p>First, according to the court of appeals, funding would have a primary
effect of advancing religion because &quot;it would be difficult to view
awarding SAF monies to &quot;Wide Awake&quot; as anything but state sponsorship --
and therefore advancement -- of religious belief .... Using public funds
to support a publication so clearly engaged in the propagation of
particular religious doctrines would constitute a patent Establishment
Clause violation.&quot;  18 F.3d at 285.  Second, funding religious activities
would foster excessive government entanglement with religion, both because
of its &quot;potentially divisive political effect&quot; and because it would &quot;send
an unmistakably clear signal that the University of Virginia supports
Christian values.&quot;  Id. at 286.[6]
</p>
<p>The petition for certiorari followed.
</p>

<h4>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
</h4>
<p>This case presents a conflict between free speech and Establishment Clause
principles.  Under ordinary circumstances, government is barred from
requiring relinquishment of constitutional rights as a condition of access
to benefit programs.  Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972). 
</p>
<p>In addition, the Free Speech Clause requires viewpoint neutrality in the
government's distribution of subsidies or other benefits.  Regan v.
Taxation with Representation, 461 U.S. 540, 548 (1983).  thus, although
government may choose to subsidize one constitutionally protected activity
and not another, Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), it may not base
its decisions ont he viewpoints or ideas expressed by those seeking funds. 
This is particularly true for government programs that themselves support
free speech: universities, public fora, subsidies for scientific research
or the arts. 
</p>
<p>To the extent that religious expression is to be considered a &quot;viewpoint&quot;
for purposes of the speech clause, Lamb's Chapel, 113 S.Ct. at 2147-48,
such expression cannot ordinarily be denied government benefits, such as
access to meeting space, that are made available to other &quot;viewpoints.&quot; 
Under a viewpoint analysis, as the Fourth Circuit has held, the
University's exclusion of &quot;religious activities&quot; from funding eligibility
prima facie violates the principle of viewpoint neutrality. or under an
unconstitutional conditions analysis is presumptively defective int hat it
requires a sacrifice of expressive freedom for the sake of a government
benefit.[7]
</p>
<p>The Establishment Clause, however, prohibits direct government funding of
religion.  Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589 (1988); Committee for Public
Ed. and Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756 (1973); Walz v. Tax
Comm'n, 397 U.S. 664 (1970).  Contrary to the Fourth Circuit's reasoning,
this is not because government funding necessarily implies endorsement. 
Indeed, it is a corollary of the principle of viewpoint neutrality that
government subsidies, especially in the area of free expression, no more
imply endorsement or sponsorship than does the government's maintenance of
public fora where all can speak, or public libraries where authors of
myriad viewpoints, from Marx to Madonna, are represented. 
</p>
<p>The Establishment Clause bars direct funding of religion for reasons
independent of implied endorsement.  Levying taxes to support religion was
the main abuse that the framers in drafting the Establishment Clause
sought to prevent.  The Clause is unique in recognizing that government
subsidy of religion through coercive taxation violates fundamental rights
of individual conscience.  When government funding for religion is
involved, therefore, the Establishment Clause is best understood as a
constitutionally ordained exception to the doctrines of unconstitutional
conditions and viewpoint neutrality.  Any other rule would, at the very
least, require the Court to reexamine nearly a half-century of cases
holding that the Establishment Clause forbids direct aid to parochial
education even though the state simultaneously supports a secular, public
education system.  In our view, such a drastic departure from precedent is
both unwarranted and unwise. 
</p>
<p>Petitioners argue that there is no meaningful difference between direct
funding and other benefits to which the University admits religious groups
are entitled:  meeting space, use of University facilities, even tax
exemption and credits.  But, as this Court explained in Walz, direct
payments differ materially from indirect and incidental forms of
assistance.  Indirect aid, ranging from police and fire services to tax
credits, does not require discretionary decisionmaking or the active,
affirmative transfer of government funds to church coffers.  In our
contemporary world, there is no way to sever religion from all forms of
government assistance, nor is such absolute separation constitutionally
required.  But direct subsidies are qualitatively different, and violate
the core meaning of the Establishment Clause, as the taxpayer standing
cases recognize.  See Valley Forge v. Americans United, 454 U.S. 464, 479
(1982). 
</p>
<p>A rule against direct financial support of religions activity does not
mean that no student publication or group that receives University funds
can address the question of religion, mount plays or art exhibits that
reflect religious issues, or print any articles written from a religious
viewpoint.  The Establishment Clause prohibits direct funding only of
pervasively sectarian activity, such as religious worship, training, and
proselytizing.  That the line-drawing may be difficult in some cases does
not m ean that it cannot be accomplished.  If the law were otherwise, the
Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses themselves would become
meaningless.  For every case involving either clause initially requires a
determination whether the activity in question is in fact religion. 
</p>

<hr width=60%>
</center>
<p>[1] Letters of consent to the filing of this brief have been lodged with
the Clerk of the Court pursuant to Rule 37.3. 
</p>
<p>[2] The University's guidelines define &quot;religious organization&quot; as &quot;an
organization whose purpose is to practice a devotion to an acknowledged
ultimate reality or deity.&quot;  Rosenberger, 18 F.3rd 269, 271 n.2 (3rd. Cir.
1994).  Fraternities and sororities, &quot;political&quot; organizations, and groups
with exclusionary membership policies are also ineligible for funding. 
</p>
<p>[3] The guidelines define &quot;religious activity&quot; as &quot;an activity which
primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about a deity
or an ultimate reality.&quot;  18 F.3rd at 271 n.2.  Other excluded
expenditures are &quot;honoraria or similar fees, . . . social entertainment
and related expenses, . . . philanthropic contributions and activities;
and . . . political activities.&quot;  Id. at 271. 
</p>
<p>[4] Because &quot;Wide Awake's&quot; funding application was denied, it was not
subjected to the post-approval process of determining how much financial
aid it should receive.  This process involves an evaluation of &quot;(1) the
size of the group; (2) the University-wide benefits conferred by the
group's activities; and (3) the group's financial self-sufficiency.&quot; 
Rosenberger 18 F.3rd at 271.  If an organization is approved for financial
aid, the University pays its cost directly after reviewing vouchers
submitted by the group and determining that the expenditures are proper. 
Id. 
</p>
<p>[5] The court did not view public forum analysis as necessary or
appropriate, given the factual context -- &quot;content-based discrimination
relating to government-generated burdens or benefits.&quot;  18 F.3rd at 287. 
</p>
<p>[6] The Fourth Circuit viewed the free exercise claim as &quot;abandoned,&quot; 18
F.3rd at 277 n.23; and disposed of the equal protection argument on the
ground that petitioners &quot;fail[ed] to argue discriminatory intent as a
matter of law.&quot;  Id at 288. 
</p>
<p>[7] Alternatively, to the extent that the religious expression in this
case is deemed excludable from University funding because of its religious
subject matter, Cornelius v, NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educ. Fund, Inc., 473
U.S. 788, 806 (1985), the decision not to fund the expressive activity at
issue would be impermissible even in a nonpublic forum unless demonstrably
reasonable, and in a traditional public forum or its equivalent would
violate the free speech guarantee unless justified by a compelling
governmental interest.

<center>
<H2>Review of 1994 Court Term - By the Amendments</H2></CENTER>
<center>
<H3>ELEVENTH AMENDMENT</H3>
</center>
     In Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp., 63 U.S.L.W.
4009 (Nov. 14, 1994)(5-4), the Court ruled that the Eleventh
Amendment does not extend to a bistate railway created by New
Jersey and New York through an interstate compact approved by
Congress.  Writing for the majority, Justice Ginsburg emphasized
the Port Authority's financial independence and the fact that
neither New York nor New Jersey was responsible for any judgments
against the Port Authority.  She also noted that the Port
Authority could not have been created without the approval of
Congress and thus it was not purely a creature of the states. 
Justice O'Connor's dissent argued that the critical issue was
control, not financial independence, and that New York and New
Jersey retained sufficient control over the Port Authority's
operations to justify application of the Eleventh Amendment.

<H4>Habeas Corpus</H4>

     In Schlup v. Delo, 63 U.S.L.W. 4089 (Jan. 23, 1995)(5-4),
the Court considered the proper standard for showing "actual
innocence" in order to support a second habeas petition alleging
ineffective assistance at trial and the constitutional failure of
the prosecution to produce exculpatory evidence at trial.  The
lower courts had held that the defendant was barred from bringing
a successive petition unless he could show "by clear and con-
vincing evidence that but for a constitutional error, no reason-
able juror would have found" the defendant guilty.  Finding this
standard too stringent, the majority ruled that it is sufficient
for the defendant to show that it is more likely than not that no
reasonable juror would have convicted in light of all the
evidence now available.  Once this showing of "actual innocence"
is made, the Court held, the defendant is entitled to raise his
claims of constitutional error in a successive petition.
 <P>
     In Duncan v. Henry, 63 U.S.L.W. 3560 (Jan. 23, 1995)(8-1),
the Court rejected the habeas corpus claim of a state prisoner
who had objected to the admissibility of certain evidence at
trial on the ground that it was a "miscarriage of justice" but
who had not explicitly raised any federal constitutional claim. 
The majority held, as a result, that Henry had not exhausted his
state remedies because his federal due process claim had not been
"fairly presented" to the state courts.  In a lone dissent,
Justice Stevens argued that "[t]he new rule the Court announces
today is hypertechnical and unwise."  Id. at 3561.
  <P>
     In O'Neal v. McAninch, 63 U.S.L.W. 4126 (Feb. 21, 1995)
(6-3), the Court ruled that a writ of habeas corpus should be
issued if the habeas court is in "grave doubt" as to whether or
not a constitutional violation that occurred during trial was
harmless error.  In effect, this places the burden of proof on
the state to prove harmless error rather than on the habeas
petitioner to prove prejudice.  The majority opinion by Justice
Breyer is particularly remarkable for its emphasis on the role of
habeas corpus in avoiding imprisonment of the innocent.  This
marks a dramatic shift in tone from the Court's recent habeas
decisions, which predominantly emphasized the state's interest in
finality.  The ACLU submitted an amicus brief in support of the
habeas petitioner, largely on the grounds ultimately adopted by
the Court.
<br> <a href="oneal.html">Summary of Argument in ACLU amicus brief</a>
<P>
     In Goeke v. Branch, 63 U.S.L.W. 3688 (Mar. 20, 1995)(9-0), a
unanimous Court summarily reversed an Eighth Circuit decision
holding that Missouri could not deny a convicted murderer the
right to appeal because she fled following her conviction absent
some evidence of prejudice to the appellate process.  In a per
curiam opinion, the Supreme Court concluded that the due process
principle announced by the Eighth Circuit was, at the very least,
a new rule that could not be applied in a habeas proceeding under
Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989), and that the Teague claim
had not been waived by the state.  The Supreme Court's opinion
also strongly suggested that it disagreed with the lower court's
view of the due process clause.
 <P>
     In Garlotte v. Fordice, 63 U.S.L.W. 4476 (May 30, 1995)      
(7-2), the Court held that a prisoner who is serving consecutive
sentences may challenge the validity of the first sentence in a
habeas corpus proceeding even after that sentence has expired so
long as the prisoner is still serving the second sentence and
thus "in custody" for purposes of the habeas corpus statute.
 <P>

<H4>Rico</H4>

     In United States v. Robertson, 63 U.S.L.W. 4386 (May 1,
1995)(9-0), the Court unanimously upheld, in a per curiam
opinion, a RICO indictment alleging that defendants had engaged
in a criminal enterprise involving a gold mine in Alaska that
purchased equipment out of state, hired workers out of state, and
shipped approximately 15% of its ore out of state.  According to
the Court, these allegations were sufficient to establish that
the enterprise "engaged in . . . interstate" commerce, which is
one of RICO's jurisdictional predicates.


<H4>Federal Criminal Law</H4>

     In United States v. Shabani, 63 U.S.L.W.4001 (Nov. 1, 1994)
(9-0), the Court unanimously held that the federal drug conspir-
acy statute, 21 U.S.C.  846, can be violated without any proof
that the defendant engaged in an overt act in furtherance of the
conspiracy.  The defendant argued that, absent an overt act
requirement, the statute punished criminal thoughts rather than
criminal deeds.  Justice O'Connor's opinion rejected that argu-
ment, however, noting that criminal conspiracies had been
regarded as prohibited acts, in and of themselves, since the
early nineteenth century.
 <P>
     In United States v. X-Citement Video, 63 U.S.L.W. 4019 (Nov.
29, 1994)(7-2), the Court interpreted the federal child pornog-
raphy statute to require proof that the defendant "knew" that one
of the performers engaged in explicit sexual conduct was a minor. 
The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice Rehnquist, con-
ceded that its construction of the statute was "ungrammatical." 
Nevertheless, the Court concluded that a literal reading of the
law -- which would require the government to prove only that the
defendant knowingly transported the material in interstate
commerce -- would produce "absurd" results.  In justifying its
decision, the Court relied on the general presumption that
criminal statutes contain a scienter requirement.  The Court also
noted that a contrary construction of the statute would raise
serious constitutional questions.  Justices Scalia and Thomas
dissented.
 <P>
     In Hubbard v. United States, 63 U.S.L.W. 4393 (May 15,
1995)(6-3), the Court held that 18 U.S.C.  1001, which prohibits
false statements to a "department or agency of the United
States," could not be used to prosecute false statements to the
Bankruptcy Court because the Bankruptcy Court could not fairly be
construed as a "department or agency of the United States" under
the statute.  In adopting this construction of the statute, the
Court expressly overruled its prior decision in United States v.
Bramblett, 348 U.S. 503 (1955).  The Court's decision is perhaps
most interesting as part of its ongoing, internal dialogue about
the meaning and significance of stare decisis.
<P>
     In United States v. Aguilar, 63 U.S.L.W. 4637 (June 21,
1995), the Court upheld, by an 8-1 vote, the conviction of a
federal district judge for disclosing a wiretap in violation of
18 U.S.C.  2232(c).  Writing for the majority, Chief Justice
Rehnquist rejected the defendant's argument that the statute
could not apply since the wiretap had, in fact, expired by the
time the disclosure was made.  By a 6-3 vote, however, the Court
reversed the defendant's conviction for obstruction of justice
under 18 U.S.C.  1503.  According to the Court,  1503 requires
some "nexus" to judicial proceedings and, thus, did not reach the
defendant's false statements to an FBI agent.  
<P>



<H4>Federal Rules of Evidence</H3>

 In Tome v. United States, 63 U.S.L.W. 4046 (January 10,
1995)(5-4), the Court held that the federal hearsay exception
that permits prior statements by a witness to rebut a charge of
recent fabrication does not apply to statements made after the
motive for fabrication arose.  The evidentiary dispute occurred
in the context of a sexual abuse trial.  In his first Supreme
Court opinion, Justice Breyer dissented on the ground that the
majority's rule unduly restricted the flexibility of trial judges
to make judgments about relevancy.
<P>
In United States v. Mezzanatto, 63 U.S.L.W. 4060 (Jan. 18,
1995)(7-2), the Court held that statements made by a defendant
during plea negotiations could be introduced by the prosecution
for impeachment purposes if, prior to the plea negotiations, the
defendant knowingly waived his right to have such statements
deemed inadmissible under the federal rules.  The defendant had
argued that the rule of inadmissibility was unwaivable.  The
Court disagreed.  However, five members of the court (three in
concurrence and two in dissent) expressly noted that more serious
questions would be raised if the prosecution attempted to use the
defendant's statements as part of the government's case-in-chief.


<H4> Immigration</H4>

     In Stone v. INS, 63 U.S.L.W. 4294 (April 19, 1995)(6-3), the
Court ruled that filing a timely motion for reconsideration of a
deportation decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals does not
toll the 90 day time limit for seeking judicial review of the
decision.

<H4>Arbitration</H4>

     In Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos., Inc. v. Dobson, 63 U.S.L.W.
4079 (Jan. 18, 1995)(7-2), the Court held that an Alabama state
rule invalidating predispute arbitration agreements was preempted
by the Federal Arbitration Act, which the Court construed to
apply whenever a contract "in fact" involved interstate commerce. 
In Justice Breyer's first majority opinion, the Court further
held that the reference to interstate commerce in the Arbitration
Act was meant to be as broad as the Commerce Clause itself.
<P>
     In Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 63 U.S.L.W.
4195 (Mar. 6, 1995)(8-1), the Court ruled that punitive damages
were available in an arbitration between a private investor and a
securities dealer.  The dealer had relied on the fact that the
underlying arbitration agreement referred to New York State law,
which does not permit punitive damages in arbitration.  The Court
nevertheless refused to enforce this ban on the theory that it
was not clearly stated in the contract and it was therefore
"unlikely" that plaintiffs had "any idea that by signing a
standard-form agreement to arbitrate disputes they might be
giving up an important substantive right."  Id. at 4198.
<P>
     In First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 63 U.S.L.W.
4459 (May 22, 1995)(9-0), held that the question of whether a
dispute over the arbitrator's jurisdiction is itself arbitrable
or must be resolved in court depends upon the intent of the
parties as expressed in the original arbitration agreement.
<P>

<H4>Jurisdiction and Justiciabilty</H4>

In Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 63
U.S.L.W. 4005 (Nov. 8, 1994)(9-0), the Court unanimously ruled
that the settlement of a case while it is pending on appeal may
moot the appeal but it does not, ordinarily, justify an order
vacating the decision below.  Construing its previous decision in
United States v. Munsingwear, 340 U.S. 36 (1950) the Court held
that an order vacating the lower court decision is appropriate
when mootness occurs "through happenstance," thus denying the
losing party any chance to pursue its appeal.  By contrast, a
party that settles a case effectively waives its right to
appellate review and thus there is no unfairness in allowing the
lower court decision to stand.  Finally, the Court noted, a
stipulation in the settlement providing for vacatur is insuffi-
cient to overcome this general rule.
 <P>
In Federal Election Comm'n v. NRA Political Victory Fund, 63
U.S.L.W. 4027 (Dec. 6, 1994)(7-1), the FEC filed a petition for
certiorari from a ruling of the D.C. Court of Appeals that the
composition of the FEC violated separation of powers because it
included nonvoting members from the Senate and House.  In an
opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, however, the Court concluded
that only the Solicitor General could petition for certiorari
under these circumstances, that the FEC lacked authority to file
its own petition, and that the Solicitor General's effort to
ratify the FEC's filing after-the-fact was untimely and thus
invalid.
<P>
In Anderson v. Green, 63 U.S.L.W. 4162 (Feb. 22, 1995)(per
curiam), the Court ruled that a challenge to California's system
of providing new residents to the state with lower AFDC payments
than residents who had lived in the state for one year or longer
was not ripe since the program could not go into effect without a
federal waiver and the initial federal waiver had been struck
down as invalid in a parallel litigation.  Having concluded that
the controversy was no longer ripe, the Court then vacated the
Ninth Circuit decision, which had enjoined enforcement of the
statute as unconstitutional.  The ACLU was co-counsel for
plaintiffs challenging the statute.
<P>
In Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 63 U.S.L.W. 4189 (March
1, 1995)(9-0), the Court unanimously held that the issue of
whether a county can be held liable for the decisions of one of
its officials in a  1983 action on the theory that the official
exercises final policymaking authority for the county is not a
proper subject for an interlocutory appeal even if, as here,
other defendants are pursuing an interlocutory appeal on the
question of qualified immunity.  Justice Ginsburg's opinion
specifically rejected the notion of pendent appellate jurisdic-
tion that several lower courts had adopted, including the
Eleventh Circuit in this case.  The ACLU submitted an amicus
brief supporting plaintiff's position on the merits, which were
never reached by the Court because of its jurisdictional holding.
<P>
 In Johnson v. Jones, 63 U.S.L.W. 4552 (June 12, 1995)(9-0),
the Court unanimously ruled that a government defendant who seeks
summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity is entitled
to take an interlocutory appeal on the question of whether his
conduct violated clearly established law but is not entitled to
take an interlocutory appeal on the question of whether he
committed the acts alleged in the complaint.  Writing for the
Court, Justice Breyer held that the "I didn't do it" defense did
not justify an exception to the general rule against interlocu-
tory appeals in the federal system.
<P>
 In Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., 63 U.S.L.W. 4544 (June 12,
1995)(8-0), the Court unanimously ruled that a federal district
court has broad discretion to stay a declaratory judgment action
during the pendency of a parallel state court proceeding.  The
Court's decision rested squarely on the unique characteristics of
the Declaratory Judgment Act.  As Justice O'Connor noted: "We
have repeatedly characterized the Declaratory Judgment Act as 'an
enabling Act, which confers a discretion on the Court rather than
an absolute right on the litigant.'"  Id. at 4547.

<blockquote>
<h4>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
</h4>
<p>Prior to Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967), most courts
understood that constitutional error in a criminal case could never be
&quot;harmless&quot; and always warranted relief, either on direct review or in
federal habeas corpus.  That understanding changed after Chapman, where
the Court held that some constitutional errors at trial could be ignored
if it could be said with relative assurance that they had no effect on the
ultimate verdict. 
</p>
<p>In rationalizing this fundamental change in constitutional
jurisprudence, Chapman weighed the costs of automatic reversal against the
risks of erroneous conviction and concluded that the system could tolerate
some additional risk.  To ensure that the idea of harmless error remained
within close bounds, however, the Court held that no error could be
considered harmless unless the prosecution demonstrated, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that the error had not influenced the verdict. 
</p>
<p>The careful balance articulated in Chapman remained the governing
rule for more than two decades until last Term's decision in Brecht v.
Abrahamson, 113 S.Ct. 1710, which relaxed the standard for determining
harmless error in habeas corpus cases pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 2254. 
Under Brecht, constitutional trial error can be held harmless if it had no
&quot;substantial&quot; effect on the verdict within the meaning of the benchmark
harmless error case, Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750 (1946). 
This standard, of course, created a greater risk of erroneous conviction
than the previously applicable Chapman rule. 
</p>
<p>Now, the risk of erroneous conviction has been increased still
further by the decision of the Sixth Circuit in this case to shift the
burden of proof with respect to harmless error to the prisoner.  The
circuit decision misapprehends the very nature of the decision the Court
made in Brecht and, in so doing, scrambles the doctrine worked out by the
combination of Brecht, Chapman, and Kotteakos in a way that threatens the
bedrock objectives of the criminal justice system:  accurate
determinations of guilt or innocence. 
</p>
<p>Shifting the burden of proof with respect to harmless error is out
of step with this Court's habeas decisions generally.  Those decisions
have justified various procedural barriers to the federal forum as efforts
to conserve scarce federal judicial resources and to respect legitimate
state interests.  The burden allocation the circuit court has adopted does
not streamline or expedite the processing of claims in habeas corpus, but
impedes the federal courts' ability to adjudicate properly preserved
claims on the merits. 
</p>
<p>In Brecht, this Court altered the standard by which federal habeas
corpus courts judge harmless error, but did not disturb the traditional
understanding that the burden of demonstrating that error was harmless
lies with the party who stands to benefit from an affirmative
determination:  the respondent. 
</p>
<p>As justification for this decision, the circuit court erroneously
relied on a single sentence in this Court's opinion in Brecht.  On close
examination, that sentence will not bear the weight the circuit attaches
to it.  Indeed, read as a whole, the Brecht opinion makes clear that the
Court in that case did not alter the settled norm regarding burdens of
proof. 
</p>
<p>The preservation of the burden on the respondent harmonizes the
framework for harmless error analysis in habeas corpus cases under 28
U.S.C. Section 2254 with practice under the federal harmless error
statute, 28 U.S.C. Section 2111; the relevant rule, Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a);
and, indeed, the very decision to which Brecht looked for primary
guidance:  Kotteakos.  It also reconciles Brecht with this Court's cases
on the effects of procedural default. 
</p>
<p>The conventional allocation of the burden of proof to the state is
supported by solid, practical analysis.  It advances the accuracy of
criminal judgements, comports with ordinary expectations regarding the
allocation of burdens in constitutional litigation, and assigns
responsibility to the party with the incentive and capacity to develop the
relevant guidance and arguments. 
</p>
<p>A reallocation of the burden of proof with respect to harmless
error would complicate and confuse the determination of the merits of
claims in habeas corpus, distorting the habeas courts' understanding and
exposition of federal constitutional rights.  Those distortions would not
be offset by any practical benefits.  Both the federal courts and state
authorities would find their work more, not less, burdensome.

<img src="../graphics/rbline.gif" width=95%><br>
<h4>                       Statement of Case
</h4>
<p>     Respondent Town &amp; Country Electric Inc. Is a large nonunion
electrical contractor based in Wisconsin. In early September, 1989, Town &amp;
Country was awarded a contract to perform electrical renovation work at
the Boise Cascade paper mill in International Falls, Minnesota. Respondent
subsequently learned that it was required to employ at least one
Minnesota-licensed electrician for every two unlicensed electricians
working at the job site. In order to meet this requirement, respondent
engaged a temporary employment agency. Respondent made clear, however,
that applicants had to be &quot;able to work a merit&quot; -- meaning nonunion --
shop, and applicants who contacted the agency were specifically asked
whether they would work nonunion. 
</p>
<p>     On September 7, two Town &amp; Country officials arrived in Minneapolis
for a day of interviews. They interviewed a nonunion electrician who had a
scheduled appointment, but did not hire him. The other dozen or so
electricians present did not have scheduled appointments, although one,
Malcolm Hansen, was told by the receptionist that he could be interviewed
anyway. The applicants were all told that the job was nonunion, but
nevertheless expressed interest in the work. 
</p>
<p>     Town &amp; Country officials then asked an agency official how these
particular applicants knew of the job openings. &quot;I think they're union,&quot;
the agency official said, whereupon Town &amp; Country refused to do any
further interviews. Hansen protested, having already been told to report
for an interview. Town and Country relented, and Hansen was hired,
beginning work five days later. On the job site, he solicited his
co-workers to join the union, and subsequently was fired. 
</p>
<p>     The applicants who were denied interviews were members of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and had been authorized by
the union to work nonunion jobs in order to organize employees. Two of the
applicants were paid union organizers; the remainder were not union
employees. At least some of the applicants expected to receive financial
support from a union fund established to reimburse pay differentials
incurred by union members who were &quot;salting&quot; nonunion jobs in order to
organize the workforce. Nothing in the record suggests that on September
7, when respondent refused to interview these applicants, it knew that
they had any kind of financial relationship with the union, or that they
had applied for the jobs essentially at the behest of the union. 
</p>
<p>     The Board found that the respondent fired Hansen because of his
organizational activities on behalf of the union. The Board further found
that respondent's refusal to interview union members, as well as the
discriminatory discharge of Hansen, violated section 8(a)(3) of the NLRA,
which prohibits employers from discrimination that &quot;discourage[s]
membership in any labor organization.&quot; The Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit denied enforcement of the Board's order, holding that the
discharged workers were not &quot;employees&quot; under section 2(3) of the Act
because they were &quot;under the control&quot; of the union or expected
compensation from the union. 
</p>
<h4>                      Summary of Argument
</h4>
<p>     This case raises a question of statutory construction essential to
the right of workers to organize and to exchange information about unions
with co-workers: whether section 2(3) of the National Labor Relations Act,
29 U.S.C. section 152(3), excludes from its protection job applicants and
employees whose organizing activity is encouraged or compensated by a
union. In the real world of nonunion workplaces, the issues before the
Court are these: Can an employer refuse to interview an applicant who is a
union member and has been encouraged by the union to work a nonunion job?
Can an employer refuse to interview an applicant who is a union staff
member and expects reimbursement from the union for any pay differential
incurred by working a nonunion job? And, can an employer fire an otherwise
satisfactory worker who is also a paid union organizer? 
</p>
<p>     The clear and unambiguous language of section 2(3) of the NLRA
includes &quot;any employee,&quot; other than a few exceptions not relevant here.
And this Court has consistently recognized that job applicants, as well as
those who have been hired, fit comfortably within this provision. Nothing
in the language of that section supports respondent's contention that an
employee loses his protection under section 2(3) -- protection explicitly
designed to prevent employers from retaliating against union members in
the hiring and firing process -- because of his financial or associational
relationship with the union. On the contrary, as the National Labor
Relations Board reasonably found, when Congress intended to exclude
particular categories of workers from the protective scope of section
2(3), it explicitly provided for that result in the language of the Act. 
</p>
<p>     The Board deals at length with the appropriate deference that is due
an administrative agency's reasonable interpretation of an unambiguous
statute. We agree that the statute is unambiguous. In addition, however,
the legislative purpose of the NLRA supports the Board's reading of the
statutory text. The NLRA was intended to facilitate self-organization,
which this Court has recognized as &quot;the central purpose of the Act.&quot;
Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177, 193 (1941). In pursuit of this
goal, Congress established face-to-face communication between one employee
and another at the job site as the central way for workers to receive
information about unions and to effectuate their right to self-organize.
Through the personal encounter with co-workers at the job site, workers
obtain the knowledge that they need to make informed and free decisions
about whether to choose or reject a union. It is a kind of knowledge and
interaction that cannot be duplicated from other sources, whether the
union, the media or literature. 
</p>
<p>     This Court has repeatedly affirmed the primacy of face-to-face
communication between co-workers on the job to achieve the statutory goal
of self-organizing, and a half-century of law concerning the organizing
process has been built on the centrality of this workplace encounter
between employees. To deprive employees of union resources that they need
to engage in self-organization would have a chilling effects on rights
explicitly protected under the Act. 
</p>
<p>     The decision below rips an exception out of the protective fabric of
the Act that would thus &quot;inevitably operate[] against the whole idea of
the legitimacy of organization.&quot; Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. at
185. Furthermore, because the rule of exclusion adopted by the court below
is neither self-defining nor well-defined, it will inevitably invite
abuses during the hiring and screening processes that this Court has
repeatedly condemned. It also jettisons the traditional balancing test
that this Court has employed when weighing the employee's right to speak
and associate against the employer's managerial and property interests. 
</p>
<p>     In such a balance, the employer's interest must be carefully defined.
Respondent in this case has put forward no legitimate interest to justify
the withholding of statutory protection. The only asserted interest on
this record is the employer's preference not to hire union sympathizers --
whether members, staff or paid organizers -- because they are in conflict
with his desire to maintain a nonunion workplace. Unlike a nonemployee
union organizer who seeks access to an employer's property, the employee
organizers in this case seek only to be treated equally in the hiring and
firing process with their nonunion colleagues. A conflict between these
union sympathizers and the employer can be said to exist only if union
organizing is incompatible with the employer's right to run his business.
That premise, however, has been definitively rejected by both Congress and
this Court.

<h4>                      Summary of Argument
</h4>
<p>     Affirmance of the decision below that race-conscious redistricting is
always subject to strict scrutiny without regard to bizarre shape and that
the state had no compelling interest in complying with the Voting Rights
Act or in remedying past discrimination would render constitutionally
suspect or invalidate most of the congressional, state, and local
redistricting plans in the South as well as in other parts of the nation.
A generation of litigation and administrative action under the Act would
be set aside that Congress, national administrations of both parties, and
this Court have endorsed as appropriate efforts to remedy the exclusion of
minorities from the political process. Existing majority-minority
districts would be invalidated and given the fact that minorities have
been elected almost exclusively in majority-minority districts,
legislative bodies at the national, state, and local levels would become
primarily white. 
</p>
<p>     The consideration of race in redistricting is not per se suspect and
is different from consideration of race in the allocation of scare
employment of contractual opportunities where an independent claim of
entitlement exists. Any racial groups may complain if its voting strength
has been abridged, but a non-dilutive race-conscious redistricting plan
injures no one. Congress has sanctioned the use of majority-minority
districts and has concluded that they do not isolate voters or increase
racial tension.

<p>Most federal agency contracts must contain a subcontractor compensation
clause, which gives a prime contractor a financial incentive to hire
subcontractors certified as small businesses controlled by socially and
economically disadvantaged individuals, and requires the contractor to
presume that such individuals include minorities or any other individuals
found to be disadvantaged by the Small Business Administration (SBA). The
prime contractor under a federal highway construction contract containing
such a clause awarded a subcontract to a company that was certified as a
small disadvantaged business.  The record does not reveal how the company
obtained its certification, but it could have been by any one of three
routes: under one of two SBA programs-known as the 8(a) and 8(d) programs--or
by a state agency under relevant Department of Transportation regulations.
Petitioner Adarand Constructors, Inc., which submitted the low bid on the
subcontract but was not a certified business, filed suit against respondent
federal officials, claiming that the race-based presumptions used in
subcontractor compensation clauses violate the equal protection component of
the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.  The District Court granted
respondents summary judgment.  In affirming, the Court of Appeals assessed
the constitutionality of the federal race-based action under a lenient
standard, resembling intermediate scrutiny, which it determined was required
by Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, and Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC,
497 U.S. 547.

<h4>Held:</h4>
<p>
The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.
16 F.3d 1537, vacated and remanded.
Justice O'Connor delivered an opinion with respect to Parts I, II, III-A,
III-B, III-D, and IV, which was for the Court except insofar as it might be
inconsistent with the views expressed in Justice Scalia's concurrence,
concluding that:</p>
<blockquote><p>
1. Adarand has standing to seek forward-looking relief.  It has met the
requirements necessary to maintain its claim by alleging an invasion of a
legally protected interest in a particularized manner, and by showing that it
is very likely to bid, in the relatively near future, on another Government
contract offering financial incentives to a prime contractor for hiring
disadvantaged subcontractors.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.
555, 560.  Pp. 7-10.,/p>
<p>
2. All racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local
governmental actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict
scrutiny.  Pp. 10-29; 34-37.
<blockquote>
<p>(a) In Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, a majority of the Court
held that the Fourteenth Amendment requires strict scrutiny of all race-based
action by state and local governments.  While Croson did not consider what
standard of review the Fifth Amendment requires for such action taken by the
Federal Government, the Court's cases through Croson had established three
general propositions with respect to governmental racial classifications.
First, skepticism: &quot;`[a]ny preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must
necessarily receive a most searching examination,'&quot; Wygant v. Jackson Board
of Ed., 476 U.S. 267, 273-274.  Second, consistency: &quot;the standard of review
under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those
burdened or benefited by a particular classification,&quot; Croson, supra, at 494.
And third, congruence: &quot;[e]qual protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment
area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment,&quot; Buckley v. Valeo,
424 U.S. 1, 93.  Taken together, these propositions lead to the conclusion
that any person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any
governmental actor subject to the Constitution justify any racial
classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the
strictest judicial scrutiny.  Pp. 10-23.
<p>
(b) However, a year after Croson, the Court, in Metro Broadcasting, upheld
two federal race-based policies against a Fifth Amendment challenge.  The
Court repudiated the long-held notion that &quot;it would be unthinkable that the
same Constitution would impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government&quot; than
it does on a State to afford equal protection of the laws, Bolling v. Sharpe,
347 U.S. 497, 500, by holding that congressionally mandated &quot;benign&quot; racial
classifications need only satisfy intermediate scrutiny.  By adopting that
standard, Metro Broadcasting departed from prior cases in two significant
respects.  First, it turned its back on Croson's explanation that strict
scrutiny of governmental racial classifications is essential because it may
not always be clear that a socalled preference is in fact benign.  Second, it
squarely rejected one of the three propositions established by this Court's
earlier cases, namely, congruence between the standards applicable to federal
and state race-based action, and in doing so also undermined the other two.
Pp. 23-25.
<p>
(c) The propositions undermined by Metro Broadcasting all derive from the
basic principle that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect persons, not
groups.  It follows from that principle that all governmental action based on
race--a group classification long recognized as in most circumstances
irrelevant and therefore prohibited--should be subjected to detailed judicial
inquiry to ensure that the personal right to equal protection has not been
infringed.  Thus, strict scrutiny is the proper standard for analysis of all
racial classifications, whether imposed by a federal, state, or local actor.
To the extent that Metro Broadcasting is inconsistent with that holding, it
is overruled.  Pp. 25-29.
<p>
(d) The decision here makes explicit that federal racial classifications,
like those of a State, must serve a compelling governmental interest, and
must be narrowly tailored to further that interest.  Thus, to the extent that
Fullilove held federal racial classifications to be subject to a less
rigorous standard, it is no longer controlling.  Requiring strict scrutiny is
the best way to ensure that courts will consistently give racial
classifications a detailed examination, as to both ends and means.  It is not
true that strict scrutiny is strict in theory, but fatal in fact.  Government
is not disqualified from acting in response to the unhappy persistence of
both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against
minority groups in this country.  When race-based action is necessary to
further a compelling interest, such action is within constitutional
constraints if it satisfies the &quot;narrow tailoring&quot; test set out in this
Court's previous cases.  Pp. 34- 36.
</p></blockquote><p>
3. Because this decision alters the playing field in some important respects,
the case is remanded to the lower courts for further consideration.  The
Court of Appeals did not decide whether the interests served by the use of
subcontractor compensation clauses are properly described as &quot;compelling.&quot;
Nor did it address the question of narrow tailoring in terms of this Court's
strict scrutiny cases.  Unresolved questions also remain concerning the
details of the complex regulatory regimes implicated by the use of such
clauses.  Pp. 36-37.
Justice Scalia agreed that strict scrutiny must be applied to racial
classifications imposed by all governmental actors, but concluded that
government can never have a &quot;compelling interest&quot; in discriminating on the
basis of race in order to &quot;make up&quot; for past racial discrimination in the
opposite direction.  Under the Constitution there can be no such thing as
either a creditor or a debtor race.  We are just one race in the eyes of
government. Pp. 1-2.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
O'Connor, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion
with respect to Parts I, II, III-A, III-B, III-D, and IV, which was for the
Court except insofar as it might be inconsistent with the views expressed in
the concurrence of Scalia, J., and an opinion with respect to Part III-C.
Parts I, II, III-A, III-B, III-D, and IV of that opinion were joined by
Rehnquist, C. J., and Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., and by Scalia, J., to the
extent heretofore indicated; and Part III-C was joined by Kennedy, J. Scalia,
J., and Thomas, J., filed opinions concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment.  Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, J.,
joined. Souter, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg and Breyer,
JJ., joined.  Ginsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Breyer, J.,
joined.

<h4>November 9, 1995
</h4>
<h4>Re: Claims of Abraham Ahmad and Family<br> Under the Federal Tort Claims Act     
</h4>
<h4>Dear Sirs and Madams:
</h4>
<p>     This letter serves as a joint claim for damages under the Federal Tort
Claims Act filed on
behalf of Abraham Ahmad, his wife Martina Ahmad, and their minor children,
Sanna and Nesreen Ahmad.  The Ahmads' claims arise out of the actions of
various unknown employees of the United States Department of Justice, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Custom Service, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms during the period of April 19 to 21, 1995.  Specifically, the
claims concern the detention and mistreatment of Mr. Ahmad by these employees
in the aftermath of the explosion of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on April 19, 1995.
</p>

<p>     During the three days following the bombing, various employees of the
foregoing federal
agencies committed a number of tortious acts against Mr. Ahmad, with severe
consequences for
both Mr. Ahmad and his family.  As more fully described below, while
attempting to travel to
Jordan to visit his family, Mr. Ahmad was stopped by United States
authorities solely because of
his ethnicity.  From Wednesday through Friday he was detained by various
government officials,
first in Chicago, then in London, Virginia, and back in Oklahoma City.  He
was repeatedly
questioned, photographed, and fingerprinted.  He was deprived of food and
sleep, and denied
permission to call his family.  In London, he was strip-searched and then
paraded through a
crowded airport in handcuffs.  His luggage was unconstitutionally searched
without his permission and he was identified to the public and the media as a
suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing. During this three-day period Mr. Ahmad
was subjected to, inter alia, false arrest, false
imprisonment, abuse of process, invasion of privacy, injury to reputation,
and defamation.(1) 
Other members of the Ahmad family were also directly subjected to an invasion
of privacy.(2)
</p>

<p>     Mr. Abraham Ahmad seeks a sum certain of $1,013,350 for his personal
injuries, loss of
property, and pain and suffering as a result of this tortious conduct.  In
addition, Martina, Sanna,
and Nesreen Ahmad seek a sum certain of $305,850 each for the personal
injuries and pain and
suffering they experienced as a result of both the invasion of their privacy
and the torts committed against Abraham Ahmad.  The claimants believe that
such sums are fully justified under the circumstances; nevertheless, they are
willing to discuss settlements for different sums.  Finally, Mr. Ahmad seeks
an acknowledgment from the federal government that it is impermissible, and a
violation of the right to equal protection of the laws, to detain a person in
connection with a criminal investigation solely because of his ethnicity, and
without any evidence whatsoever of any culpability on his part.
</p>

<p>     Because of the complexity of this matter -- the number of claimants, the
number of federal
agencies involved, and the variety of causes of action -- the Ahmads are
submitting their claims
through this letter, rather than on Standard Form 95.  The remainder of this
letter details all of the information sought by Standard Form 95.
Nevertheless, upon request by any agency, claimants will be happy to
supplement the record with a completed Standard Form 95.
</p>

<h4>Federal Agencies Involved
</h4>

<p>     Tortious acts were committed against Mr. Abraham Ahmad and his family by
unknown
employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, the United States Customs Service, the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the
Department of Justice.  Notice of the Ahmads' claims is being submitted to
each of these five
agencies, as well as the Department of the Treasury (as the parent agency for
the Customs Service and the BATF) and the Office of the United States
Attorney for the Western District of
Oklahoma.

<h4>Dates of Tortious Conduct
</h4>
<p>April 19 - 21, 1995
</p>

<h4>Basis of Claim
</h4>

<p>     Abraham Ahmad is a naturalized American citizen who has lived in
Oklahoma since 1982. 
On April 19, 1995 he had planned to travel to Amman, Jordan to visit
relatives and to deal with a
family emergency.  He was scheduled to fly first to Chicago, then on to Rome,
and finally from
Rome to Amman.  The actions of a number of federal employees prevented him
from completing his trip.
</p>

<p>     Mr. Ahmad's flight out of Oklahoma City was scheduled to depart at 10:43
a.m.  He and
his family left their house about 9 a.m. to run a few errands before heading
to the airport.  They
arrived at the airport a little after 10 a.m.  At no point that day was Mr.
Ahmad anywhere near the
Murrah building.  In fact, to the best of his recollection, he had not been
in the vicinity of the
Murrah Building in over a year.
</p>

<p>     Mr. Ahmad brought five bags with him to the airport: two hand bags to be
carried with
him and three large suitcases to be checked.  Mr. Ahmad checked the suitcases
at the American
Airlines counter, paid an excess baggage fee, said goodbye to his family, and
left for Chicago.
</p>

<p>     Mr. Ahmad's flight arrived in Chicago at 12:30 p.m.  He was scheduled to
depart for
Rome on an Alitalia flight at 3:30 p.m.  Because Mr. Ahmad was considering an
export venture
with his brothers (whom he planned to see in Amman), he stopped by the
customs office to obtain some information about the import/export business.
He read some of the information he received, prayed, and then around 2 p.m.
headed toward the gate for his Alitalia flight.  Near the gate area he saw a
television monitor broadcasting a news report about the bombing in Oklahoma
City.  This was the first he learned of the explosion of the Murrah Building.
</p>

<p>     While Mr. Ahmad was watching the news report he was approached by two or
three
federal employees, who he believes were from the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS). 
On information and belief, these INS employees stopped Mr. Ahmad solely
because he was an
Arab American traveling from Oklahoma City.  They instructed him to come with
them, took him
to a small room, and began to question him.  Mr. Ahmad answered all of their
questions.
</p>

<p>     Mr. Ahmad's hand bags and papers were taken by the government employees
and
searched.  The government employees did not ask Mr. Ahmad for permission to
search his bags
and he did not offer them permission to do so.
</p>

<p>     Other federal employees came into the interview room.  Mr. Ahmad
estimates that there
were five federal employees in the room with him, from both the INS and the
United States
Customs Service (Customs).  In addition, there were guards posted outside the
door.  
</p>

<p>     Mr. Ahmad definitely perceived that he was not free to leave.  At one
point he attempted
to stand to respond to a question by one INS agent, when another officer
ordered him to sit down
and not to move.  When Mr. Ahmad told them he was afraid he was going to miss
his flight, they
told him: &quot;Don't worry about it.  We'll get you another one.&quot;  
</p>

<p>     Mr. Ahmad's questioning in this first room continued for approximately
an hour and a
half.  Then he was escorted by at least five federal employees to another
room for fingerprinting. 
Federal officers stayed with him even when he went to a bathroom to wash his
hands after
fingerprinting.  
</p>

<p>     Mr. Ahmad was then taken to another room and told to wait there.  He was
guarded by
two federal officers, one inside the room and one outside.  After waiting for
approximately thirty
minutes, two agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrived
and took him to yet
another room for further questioning and photographing.  The FBI agents,
accompanied by two
or three other federal employees, questioned him for approximately two hours,
repeating many of the same questions he had already answered.  They again
went through his hand bags and asked him questions about their contents.  The
FBI agents seized two tubes of caulking Mr. Ahmad was carrying to repair the
sink in his father's house in Jordan.  They paid him four dollars for the
caulk and gave him a receipt.  
</p>

<p>     Finally, at around 7:00 or 8:00 p.m., after Mr. Ahmad had been detained
for five to six
hours in Chicago, the FBI agents told him they were sorry and that they were
going to get him
another ticket to Jordan.  The government agents then booked him on a British
Airways flight
from Chicago to London's Heathrow Airport and then on a Royal Jordanian
Airlines flight from
Heathrow to Amman.  The departure time for the latter flight was so soon
after the scheduled
arrival time for the British Airways flight that it would have been
impossible for Mr. Ahmad to
make the connection.  When Mr. Ahmad explained this to the government agents
they told him
not to worry about it; he could deal with any problem in London.  They then
returned his hand
bags and papers and took him to the door of his British Airways airplane.
Thus, he was
effectively in detention until at least the moment he boarded his flight.
</p>

<p>     Mr. Ahmad's mistreatment did not end with his departure from Chicago.
As he had
predicted, his flight arrived at Heathrow Airport on the morning of April 20
too late to make his
connecting flight to Amman.  He then learned that the next flight to Jordan
was not for two days. 
Because Mr. Ahmad has a brother who lives in London, he figured he could stay
with him during
the interim.  However, he never got a chance to visit his brother, because he
was detained by
British authorities and denied permission to enter the country.  On
information and belief, all of
the wrongful treatment Mr. Ahmad experienced in London -- described in the
following
paragraphs -- occurred as a result of instructions from and at the behest of
unknown employees of the United States government in the United States.  As
such, it is actionable under the Federal
Tort Claims Act.
</p>

<p>     When Mr. Ahmad attempted to pass through British immigration control, he
was forced to
wait for approximately twenty minutes.  Then approximately six or seven
British government
personnel approached him and ordered him to come with them.  They took him to
a small room
and ordered him to remove all of his clothes.  For a Muslim, appearing naked
before strangers is
sinful and offensive.  Although he was not physically touched during this
strip search, he was
ordered to bend over for a visual inspection.  After his clothes were
thoroughly searched, he was
allowed to redress.
</p>

<p>     Because Mr. Ahmad was tired, scared, and hungry, he asked for something
to eat.  This
request was denied, though he was given some coffee to drink.  He asked if he
could call his
family to let them know that he was all right and that he would not be
arriving in Jordan as
scheduled.  This request was denied.  He invoked his right as a U.S. citizen
to meet with an
American consular official, but he was not permitted to do so.  His hand bags
were taken from
him without his permission.  He would not see them again until Friday
afternoon back in the
United States.
</p>

<p>     Mr. Ahmad was not questioned by the British authorities, but he was held
for
approximately four hours.  After that time, the head of the British
authorities said to him: &quot;You
are under arrest.  You have to go back to the United States.&quot;  Mr. Ahmad was
then handcuffed to
be taken to another location.  He asked to have his jacket placed over his
hands to hide the
handcuffs, but this request was also denied.  He was then paraded through the
airport so that
other passengers could see him in handcuffs and taken to another small room
to await his flight
back to the United States and the arrival of the FBI.  He was given a notice
by British
Immigration authorities refusing him permission to enter the United Kingdom
as a transit
passenger on the grounds that his &quot;exclusion from the United Kingdom is
conducive to the public
good.&quot;  (A copy of this notice is attached to this letter.)  
</p>

<p>     After being confined in this new room for one to two hours, Mr. Ahmad
was informed
that his flight was ready.  He was again marched through the airport in
handcuffs, this time
surrounded by approximately fourteen government agents.  He boarded the plane
in handcuffs and was greeted by stares and whispers from the other
passengers.  Mr. Ahmad was guarded by one British officer and two FBI agents
the entire flight.  He was too embarrassed to use the restroom on the
airplane, knowing that he would have to walk through the plane in handcuffs
and
accompanied by a guard to get to the restroom.
</p>

<p>     The airplane landed at Dulles Airport in Virginia at 6:00 or 7:00 p.m.
on Thursday
evening, April 20.  Mr. Ahmad was instructed not to move until all the other
passengers had
disembarked.  Then, three FBI agents entered the plane to take Mr. Ahmad out.
The agents led
him to a bus right outside the plane where approximately another fifteen
agents were waiting for
him.  Mr. Ahmad was then taken to a government office at the airport, where
he was
refingerprinted and rephotographed.  Mr. Ahmad was then taken to a darkened
van and
transported approximately forty-five minutes to an unknown destination.
</p>

<p>     During the ride in the van, Mr. Ahmad was handed two pieces of paper.
The first was a
form authorizing the FBI to search his luggage.  Mr. Ahmad was reluctant to
sign the form, but
eventually agreed to sign after first appending a statement to the effect
that: &quot;The FBI in Chicago
questioned me for about six hours, and they searched my bags, found nothing
and they told me to go, because they had nothing on me.&quot;  Such an
authorization was not voluntary and, in any event, was ineffective because,
as discussed above, Mr. Ahmad's hand baggage had already been searched
improperly without his permission and, as discussed below, it also appears
that his checked luggage had already been searched prior to the time he
signed the authorization form. 
</p>

<p>     The second form handed to Mr. Ahmad was a statement of his rights.  This
form confused
Mr. Ahmad, because, despite what he had been told by British authorities,  he
had been led to
understand that he was not under arrest.  An FBI agent confirmed that Mr.
Ahmad was not under
arrest, but that he needed to know his rights and the system.  Mr. Ahmad
asked: &quot;If that is true,
why did no one tell me my rights in Chicago?&quot;
</p>

<p>     Mr. Ahmad was taken to a building at an unknown location, presumably in
Virginia.  He
was again told to wait in a room.  Shortly, two FBI agents and two agents
from the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) entered the room, showed him their
badges, and began to question him.  They questioned Mr. Ahmad for
approximately two hours.  Many of the questions concerned the contents of his
checked luggage and the questions revealed that the government agents were
familiar with the contents of that luggage.  This clearly indicates that Mr.
Ahmad's checked baggage had been searched before the time he was asked to
sign the authorization to search in the van.(3)
</p>
<p>     The FBI and BATF agents questioned Mr. Ahmad until 11:00 or 12:00 at
night.  They
then offered to put him up in a room in the FBI building for the night.  Mr.
Ahmad said that he
would rather go home to his wife and children, but they replied that there
were no further flights
to Oklahoma City that evening and they might have more questions for him the
next day.  Feeling he had no other choice, Mr. Ahmad agreed to stay at the
FBI building.  Mr. Ahmad believes that his room was monitored by video
camera, so that he was under surveillance the entire night.  The agents
permitted him to use the telephone so that he could call his family in
Jordan; presumably this call was monitored as well.
</p>

<p>     The next day, Friday April 21, the agents returned to ask Mr. Ahmad some
further questions. 
They returned his hand bags to him and reviewed their contents with him to
make sure that he had all his stuff.  Mr. Ahmad signed a voucher for the
return of his bags.  Subsequently, Mr. Ahmad realized that three videotapes
that had been in these bags had been removed by the FBI.  He asked the FBI
agents about them and was assured that they would be returned.  To date, the
FBI has not restored the videotapes to Mr. Ahmad.
</p>

<p>     Around 3:00 p.m. Mr. Ahmad and the FBI agents left to go to National
Airport.  Two FBI
agents accompanied him on a Northwest Airlines flight to Memphis, Tennessee.
While waiting
for their connecting flight in Memphis, Mr. Ahmad overheard two men
discussing press reports
that Middle Eastern men had been arrested in Chicago and London for the
bombing of the Murrah building.  He realized that they were talking about him
and for the first time realized that the public had been given information
linking him to the bombing.
</p>

<p>     The connecting flight to Oklahoma City did not arrive until 10:00 p.m.
Friday evening. 
Mr. Ahmad and the agents traveling with him were met at the airport by two
other FBI agents. 
Mr. Ahmad was taken downstairs and questioned for approximately another
fifteen minutes by
one of the agents.  The FBI agent then told Mr. Ahmad that he would have to
return for a
polygraph examination.(4)  The FBI agent also instructed Mr. Ahmad that he
should not leave his
home without informing the FBI of his whereabouts.  After another half hour
or forty-five minutes
of delay, the agents drove Mr. Ahmad to his home.  For the first time in
three days he was not in
government custody.
</p>

<p>     While all of the above was happening directly to Mr. Ahmad, a number of
additional
tortious acts were being committed out of his presence.  These include the
following:
</p>

<p>     First, as already discussed, his checked baggage was searched without
his permission.
</p>

<p>     Second, some unknown employee of the Justice Department apparently
obtained a
warrant for Mr. Ahmad's detention as a material witness in connection with
the explosion at the
Murrah Building.  Given that there was absolutely no information linking Mr.
Ahmad in any way
to the bombing, this warrant could not have been supported by probable cause.
A knowing
application for a warrant without valid probable cause would constitute an
abuse of process and
represent an additional tortious act committed against Mr. Ahmad.
</p>

<p>     Third, FBI agents came to the Ahmad home and questioned Martina Ahmad
extensively
on April 19 and 20.  The agents tried to convince Mrs. Ahmad that her husband
had hidden
information from her and misled her about his plans by telling her that Mr.
Ahmad had flown to
London rather than to Jordan.  Although Mrs. Ahmad's brother was present for
much of this
interrogation, some of the questioning was conducted by a male agent without
the presence of any male relative.  This violated Mrs. Ahmad's religious
beliefs, under which a Muslim woman is
forbidden  to be in the presence of an unrelated male, unless her husband,
father, or brother is also present.  Both for this reason and because of the
nature of the interrogation, Mrs. Ahmad was extremely upset by this
questioning.
</p>

<p>     Finally, on information and belief, one or more unknown federal
employees, revealed
information about Mr. Ahmad's detention and his purported link to the bombing
to the press and
or the public.  These false comments and improper release of information led
to a rash of
defamatory press reports, a tidal wave of press harassment of the other
members of the Ahmad
family, and hostile and abusive behavior by the Ahmads' neighbors and other
local residents. 
Reporters started to show up at the Ahmad house on Thursday in such numbers
that Martina
Ahmad had to call the police to remove them from the yard.  People drove by
shouting obscenities and threw trash in the Ahmads' yard.  Eventually, Mrs.
Ahmad had to take her daughters to a friend's apartment to escape the media
and public onslaught.  This invasion of privacy has had consequences for the
mental health of the Ahmad family that continue to this day.
</p>

<p>     Mr. Ahmad eventually made the trip to Jordan that had been prevented by
his unlawful
detention in April.  He brought his daughter Sanna with him to shield her
from lingering hostility
in Oklahoma City.  She remains there today.  When Mr. Ahmad returned to the
United States on
September 16, he was stopped by two or three Customs officers in Chicago,
including one who
had questioned him in April.  The Customs officers took him aside for an
intensive search of his
luggage.  For twenty or thirty minutes, they combed through his belongings
piece by piece.  They
found nothing.
</p>


<h4>Property Loss and Economic Injuries
</h4>

<p>     Mr. Ahmad experienced a number of losses of property and instances of
economic damage
as a result of the foregoing misconduct, for some of which he has already
received compensation from the government (as noted below).  These economic
injuries include the following:
</p>

<p><b>1.  Lost value of plane ticket for round-trip travel to Amman, Jordan and
incidental air-travel
expenses:</b> compensation received.  (Mr. Ahmad has received reimbursement for
the cost of a new one-way ticket to Amman, plus the fee for changing the date
of his return flight, as well as
reimbursement for the fee he had paid for excessive checked baggage.)
</p>

<p><b>2.  Loss of use of contents of checked luggage:</b> estimated value of $700
(because Mr. Ahmad had been planning a two month trip to Jordan, he had
packed virtually all of his clothes in his three checked suitcases.  The
government did not return these suitcases to him until early July, two and a
half months after the bombing.  Because of the delay in the return of his
luggage, Mr. Ahmad had to buy replacement items for use during the interim.)
</p>

<p><b>3. Loss of earnings:</b> estimated value of $4,000 (Mr. Ahmad had to leave his
job in order to travel
to Jordan to deal with family matters.  Because his trip was postponed for
two and a half months
as a result of his detention, his return to the workforce has been delayed by
a comparable amount of time.  The estimate is based upon his wage rate at his
last place of employment, but will be adjusted once Mr. Ahmad establishes a
wage rate in a new position.)
</p>

<p><b>4. Increased telephone bills resulting from Mr. Ahmad's detention and the
postponement and
rescheduling of his trip to Jordan:</b> estimated value of $1,000.
</p>

<p><b>5. Cost of travel to Mexico and Jordan for Ahmad children:</b> estimated value of
$1,800  (In order
to escape some of the harassment and attention and to relieve some of their
elder daughter's
anxiety and fear (discussed below), Mr. and Mrs. Ahmad took their daughters
to stay with Mrs.
Ahmad's family in Juarez, Mexico for a period of time following Mr. Ahmad's
detention.  Then
Mr. Ahmad took his oldest daughter, Sanna, with him on his delayed trip to
Jordan, where she
remains at the present time.)
</p>

<p><b>6. Loss of three videotapes:</b> substantial sentimental value (As noted above,
the FBI has never
returned three videotapes taken from Mr. Ahmad's luggage.  Each is the only
copy of an Ahmad
family home movie.  While these tapes have only a nominal economic value,
they have substantial sentimental value which must be factored into the
calculation of personal injuries.)
</p>


<h4>Personal Injuries 
</h4>

<p>     All four members of the Ahmad family(5) sustained personal injuries and
experienced
substantial pain and suffering as a result of the tortious conduct described
above.  Mr. Ahmad is
entitled to compensation for his loss of liberty during his three days of
unlawful detention, as well
as for the injury to his reputation resulting from his unjustified linkage to
a heinous crime.  In
addition, each member of the Ahmad family is entitled to compensation for the
cost of present and future treatment for the psychological effects of their
experiences, as well as compensation for the pain and suffering and extreme
emotional distress they experienced as a result of the actions of federal
government employees.  These injuries are briefly described in this section.
No amount of money could fully compensate Abraham Ahmad and his family for
these injuries.  Nevertheless, an overall value for these claims is given in
the &quot;Amount of Claim&quot; section below.
</p>

<p>     <b>Loss of Liberty:</b>  For three days, Mr. Abraham Ahmad was effectively held
in government
custody.  At no time was he free to leave or go someplace other than where
government agents
wished him to go.  At all times (except possibly for the flight from Chicago
to London) he was
accompanied by government agents or under their active surveillance.  He was
deprived of food
and sleep, was periodically handcuffed, and was forced to submit to a
complete strip search and
visual body inspection.  
</p>

<p>    <b> Injury to Reputation:</b> Mr. Ahmad's reputation was severely damaged when
his name was
associated with the bombing of the Murrah building.  Prejudice against Arab
Americans is already great in this country without having one's name
associated with a vicious terrorist act.  Millions of Americans watched
television reports concerning Mr. Ahmad's detention in Chicago and London.
This image meshed neatly with many Americans preconceptions, encouraged by
many commentators, that the bombing had the markings of a Middle Eastern
terrorist attack.  The Ahmads' neighbors were encouraged to find suspicion in
Mr. Ahmad's past behavior, including even his contribution to the local Heart
Fund.  Presumably based on information provided by United States government
employees, Mr. Ahmad was denied admission to the United Kingdom as an
undesirable person, which may have repercussions for his future travel to
that country or elsewhere in the European Community.  While the dignity and
graciousness Mr. Ahmad exhibited during the period immediately following his
detention did much to restore his reputation, the damage to his good name was
substantial and tragic.
</p>

<p>    <b> Pain and Suffering and Emotional Distress:</b> All four members of the Ahmad
family have
experienced substantial pain and suffering and emotional trauma as a result
of their mistreatment.  It would be impossible to describe fully the
emotional consequences they have experienced.  Mr. Ahmad experienced extreme
feelings of fear during his detention, as well as intense embarrassment and
humiliation during his strip search, when he was forced to appear in public
in handcuffs, and when he learned that he had been publicly identified with
the bombing.  Martina Ahmad was traumatized when, as a result of her
husband's initial detention, she was questioned extensively at her home by
male FBI agents, in violation of her religious principles that prohibit her
from being alone with a man without the presence of a male relative.  In
addition, Mrs. Ahmad and the two girls feared for the well-being of their
husband and father.  They also feared for their own safety when they were
hounded by the press and passersby at their home.  Both Abraham and Martina
Ahmad have found that they have had difficulty eating and sleeping since this
experience.  Abraham Ahmad has experienced nightmares and Martina Ahmad now
feels unsafe in Oklahoma City and wants to move.  Their elder daughter,
Sanna, continues to fear that the police are going to come back and take her
daddy away.  Finally, all members of the family are experiencing the pain of
family separation, because Sanna is now living with relatives in Jordan to
shield her from continuing public attention and hostility.
</p>

<p>   <b>  Medical Treatment and Counseling:</b>Because Mr. Ahmad is currently
unemployed, the
Ahmad family has not been able to afford private medical treatment or
counseling.  They have
received some preliminary counseling from a licensed professional counselor
at Project Heartland, a state agency set up to assist the victims of the
Murrah building explosion.  The counselor, Gary Flynn, believes that all four
members of the Ahmad family have been traumatized by this experience.  He
observed the symptomatology of Post Traumatic Stress in each member of the
family and recommends a minimum of six months to a year or more of weekly
individual, family and relationship counseling.  A second counselor, who
accompanied Mr. Flynn on his visit to the Ahmad family, concurs in his
diagnosis and recommended course of treatment and recently has begun to
provide counseling to the Ahmad family.  A full year of the recommended
counseling would cost approximately $23,400 for the entire family, or $5,850
for each family member.
</p>

<h4>Witnesses
</h4>

<p>     Apart from the Ahmad family itself, the principal witnesses to the
events described above
are the unknown federal government employees who were responsible for Mr.
Ahmad's
mistreatment, as well as any British or Italian authorities who participated
in these activities.  Mr.
Ahmad and his family do not have names and addresses for these employees.  In
addition,
numerous media reports concerning Mr. Ahmad's detention should be available.
Finally, friends
of the Ahmad family, as well as doctors and counselors can provide
information concerning the
injuries suffered by the family as a result of these events.  Names of such
witnesses can be
provided upon request.
</p>


<h4>Amount of Claims
</h4>

<p>     The Ahmad family has not attempted to apportion their claims among the
various federal
agencies involved, because they believe that these agencies are jointly and
severally responsible for their injuries.  In addition to the amounts
identified in the previous sections, Mr. Ahmad seeks $1,000,000 for his loss
of liberty, injury to reputation, and pain and suffering, while the other
members of the Ahmad family seek $300,000 each for the pain and suffering and
emotional distress they experienced.  The following table summarizes the
total sum certain sought by each claimant:

</p>


<h4>Conclusion
</h4>

<p>     The Ahmad family is interested in obtaining a prompt and fair resolution
of their claims, so
that they can put this unfortunate incident behind them.  To that end, we
stand ready to provide
any additional information we can to assist in the investigation of these
claims.  Similarly, it would assist us in evaluating any settlement offer if
you would identify for us the various government employees involved in these
events and share with us the fruits of your investigation into these claims.
We would be happy to meet with representatives of any or all of the federal
agencies involved to discuss an amicable resolution of this matter.

<h4>ENDNOTES:
</h4>

<p>1 - Although defamation is not actionable under the Federal Tor Claims Act
(FTCA), Mr. Ahmad
may recover up to $50,000 from the Attorney General for injury caused by an
investigative or law enforcement officer employed by the Department of
Justice pursuant to 31 U.S.C. section 3724. Mr. Ahmad asks that this claim be
considered along with his claims pursuant to the FTCA.
</p>


<p>2 - In addition, these same unknown employees of the aforementioned federal
agencies violated
Mr. Ahmad's constitutional rights to due process, to equal protection, and to
be free form
unlawful searches and seizures, under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the
United States
Constitution.  If it becomes necessary to initiate litigation to resolve the
Ahmad family's tort
claims, Mr. Ahmad may also seek relief for these constitutional violations
through a Bivens action against the responsible federal employees.
</p>


<p>3 - Mr. Ahmad's checked bags had been sent to Rome, the second connection
point on his
original itinerary.  It is unclear whether the search of his checked baggage
occurred in Italy or the
United States and whether it was physically carried out by American or
Italian authorities. 
Nevertheless, on information and belief, the search of these bags was carried
out under
instructions from and at the behest of federal employees in the United States
and thus is actionable under the Federal Tort Claims Act.
</p>


<p>4 - Later, after Timothy McVeigh had been identified as the principal suspect
in the bombing, the
FBI decided not to conduct the polygraph examination of Mr. Ahmad.
</p>


<p>5 - Mr. Ahmad's relatives in Jordan also experienced severe emotional
distress and pain and
suffering as a result of his detention.  When they learned that their
son/brother had been detained by government authorities for three days, they
feared that he had been beaten and tortured.

<blockquote>
<h4>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
</h4>
<p>The court of appeals decided that Chambers County, Alabama, lacks
any &quot;general law enforcement authority.&quot;  Pet. App. 34a.  Because the
County has no law enforcement authority, the court reasoned, it was
impossible for Sheriff James Morgan to be the final law enforcement
official of the County.  Id.  By so holding, the court effectively
immunized Chambers County from the consequences of Sheriff Morgan's
actions. 
</p>
<p>The court of appeals was able to reach its conclusion only by
ignoring the county-based law enforcement scheme that is clearly
established under Alabama law.  Although the court of appeals held that
state law provides instruction on the scope of Section 1983 liability, it
failed to consider whether county sheriffs actually function as state or
county officials.  When Alabama law is examined with respect to its system
of law enforcement, it is clear that Chambers County provides law
enforcement for the county and that Sheriff Morgan is the final
policymaker for law enforcement in that county.

<h1>WE WON!
</h1>
<p>
<center>
<img src="../graphics/rbline.gif">
<h3>   The <font color="ff0033" size=+2>ACLU</font> continues to score significant victories<br>
 in state and federal courts across the country.<br>
Here are summaries of some recent triumphs:
</h3>
<img src="../graphics/rbline.gif">
</center>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Drug Testing on Campus
</h4>
<p>In November 1993, the ACLU of Colorado won its 1984 challenge to
the University of Colorado's requirement that all students wanting
to participate in intercollegiate athletics submit to urinalysis at
their annual physical, as well as to random urine tests throughout
the academic year, whether or not they were suspected of using
drugs.  The Colorado Supreme Court held that the program violated
both the Fourth Amendment's privacy guarantees and the equivalent
section of the state constitution.  In May 1994, the U.S. Supreme
Court declined to review, letting the lower court ruling stand.  
</p>
<p>     On May 5, the ACLU of Oregon won vindication under the Fourth
Amendment for James Acton, who was dismissed from his junior high
school football team two years ago for refusing a drug test.  The
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said: Concerns about
student drug use notwithstanding, &quot;we also understand the concern
of our forebears and the importance of the protections given by the
constitutional provisions which prohibit unreasonable searches and
seizures.&quot;  
</p>
<h4>Foster Care Reform
</h4>
<p>The Children's Rights Project, representing all foster children in
Washington, D.C. plus thousands of other abused and neglected
children about whom the District receives reports each year,
proved, in a lawsuit brought in 1989, that the District's child
welfare system was &quot;in a state of ongoing crisis as severe as that
experienced by many of the homes from which the system is removing
children.&quot; In 1991, the federal District Court declared the system
illegal and irreparably harmful to the children it was supposed to
protect.  Sweeping reforms negotiated by the ACLU have been in
process since; however, District officials appealed that portion of
the decision holding them liable for the system's failings.  In
late 1993, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the
liability ruling, and in January 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court
declined to review.  The ACLU continues to monitor District
compliance with the reform order.
</p>
<h4>Mother-To-Be Rescued
</h4>
<p>On February 22, the Superior Court of Pennsyvania threw out
criminal charges brought against Michelle Kemp for delivering a
controlled substance to her fetus.  The law under which Kemp was
charged, said the Court, was not intended to apply in utero.  The
Women's Rights Project and the Greater Pittsburgh ACLU Chapter
represented Kemp.  Significantly, the Court was unpersuaded by the
state's invocation of Pennsylvania's Abortion Control Act, which
defines an &quot;unborn child&quot; as a human being at conception. 
</p>
<h4>Gays in the Military 
</h4>
<p>On April 4, the Lesbian and Gay Rights Project obtained a
preliminary injunction from a federal District Court in New York
blocking the government's discharge of six service members who are
plaintiffs in an ACLU challenge to the &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot;
policy.  The ACLU acted when the government notified one of our
clients of his imminent discharge, two days after learning that he
was a plaintiff in the case.  The injunction protects the six
plaintiffs' military status until their case is decided.
</p>
<h4>Prisoners' Rights
</h4>
<p>On March 18, the National Prison Project reached an historic
settlement in a Rhode Island lawsuit that was initiated in 1974. 
Back in 1977, the federal District Court declared the entire state
prison system unconstitutional, ordered remediation of the system's
overcrowded, unhealthy and unsafe conditions and appointed an
overseer to monitor compliance with that order.  Over the years,
the state was held in contempt several times for noncompliance. 
The settlement compels the state to bring conditions in its prisons
up to constitutional standards.
</p>
<h4>Freedom for &quot;Mariel Cuban&quot;
</h4>
<p>After fleeing to these shores from Cuba in 1980, Alexis Barrera-
Echavarria spent nine years in various federal prisons -- refused
repatriation by the Cuban government and considered &quot;dangerous&quot; by
the U.S., although he had not been charged with a crime. 
Echavarria challenged his incarceration, supported by the
Immigrants' Rights Project and the ACLU of Southern California as
friends-of-the-court.  On March 31, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit held that even excludable aliens are entitled to
due process and cannot be preventively detained for long periods
without trial. 
</p>
<h4>Voting Rights Victory
</h4>
<p>The Southern Regional Office and the NAACP, after triumphing when
a federal District Court created a majority black Congressional
district that elected James Clyburn, South Carolina's first black
Member of Congress since Reconstruction, have now won their appeal
of redistricting plans for the state house and senate on behalf of
a coalition of African Americans.  The U.S. Supreme Court agreed
that the lower court had failed to adequately evaluate those plans
under the racial fairness standards of the Voting Rights Act.  The
state is now poised to create approximately nine additional
majority black house districts in time for the 1994 elections.
</p>
<h4>Abortion Funding In Idaho
</h4>
<p>In a 1993 lawsuit filed by the Reproductive Freedom Project, the
ACLU of Idaho and Planned Parenthood, a state trial court declared
unconstitutional, under Idaho's constitution, a rule that
prohibited state funding for abortions unless two physicians
certified that the procedure was necessary to save a woman's life.
&quot;While the state is not constitutionally required to provide
financial assistance for pregnancy care,&quot; held the court, &quot;once it
decides to do so generally, it must proceed in a neutral manner. 
It may not pick and choose ... especially where the choosing may
invade a woman's constitutionally protected right.&quot; The state has
not appealed.

<br>
<br>
</center>
</p>
<blockquote>
<img src="../graphics/rbline.gif" width=95%><br>
<h4>	Statement of the Case
</h4>

<p>	The superseding indictment is in five counts.  Each charges the defendant Jake Baker with having violated 18 U.S.C. 875(c) by transmitting in interstate and foreign commerce communications containing a threat to injure (or, in one instance, to kidnap) another person.  All of the communications referred to in the superseding indictment are e-mail (electronic mail) messages exchanged early in December 1994 with the pseudonymous Arthur Gonda at an address in Toronto.  E-mail is an electronic transmission system through which persons can privately communicate with each other via desktop computers.
</p>
<p>  	The original charge against Mr. Baker was based in part on pornographic fiction that he openly posted on a portion of the Internet called &quot;alt.sex.stories.&quot;  The superseding indictment is based entirely on private messages exchanged with Gonda, copies of which were obtained from Mr. Baker (or with his cooperation) once he was under investigation. 
</p>
<p>	In these messages, Mr. Baker confided to Gonda that he increasingly thought about acting out his sadistic sexual fantasies.  Taken in context, as defendant's brief indicates, these thoughts themselves may have been mostly fantasy.  In any event, the first four counts of the indictment are based in effect on Mr. Baker's saying to Gonda that he has thought (or, in count four, dreamed) about perpetrating abduction, rape, mutilation, and murder.  The fifth count relies on an exchange in which Gonda and Mr. Baker talk about getting together, perhaps to enact their fantasies, &quot;[i]f not next week, or in January, then defin[ite]ly sometime in the Summer.&quot;
</p>
<p>	Thus the indictment depends on reading the word &quot;threat&quot; in 875(c) to include any expression to anyone of an apparent desire to commit a particular type of crime, without regard to whether there is an imminent danger that the crime actually will be committed.  This is not what the term &quot;threat&quot; usually means. Moreover, this reading of the statute is incompatible with the principle of free speech incorporated in the First Amendment.  

<h4>	Argument
</h4>
<h4>I.   THE STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO THE DEFENDANT IN THE INDICTMENT DO NOT CONSTITUTE &quot;THREATS&quot; INDICTABLE UNDER 18 U.S.C. 875(c).
</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>	(a)<i> The Meaning of &quot;Threat&quot;</i>
</p>
<p>	Ordinarily, in legal usage, the term &quot;threat&quot; refers to the expression of a real or apparent intent to injure which operates either (1) to compel someone to act or abstain from a particular act, or (2) otherwise to induce fear on the part of the auditor or those to whom the immediate auditor can be expected to relay the threat. See, generally, &quot;Threats &amp; Unlawful Communications,&quot; 86 C.J.S. 1 et seq.; &quot;Extortion, Blackmail, and Threats,&quot; 31A Am.Jur.2d 3,  49-73. On 18 U.S.C. 875(c), in particular, see Anno., 34 A.L.R. Fed. 785. 
</p>
<p>
	General dictionaries sometimes define &quot;threat&quot; to refer in a figurative sense to any &quot;indication of impending evil&quot; (Oxford English Dictionary); but doom-saying as such is not usually prohibited by law, and threats typically have been the object of legal restraint only insofar as they are apt unjustifiably to coerce or to create apprehension on the part of auditors.  Thus, &quot;[t]here are two basic types of threat statutes....  The first type punishes threats to compel action or inaction by a person against his or her will.   The second... punishes threats used to frighten rather than coerce.&quot;  31A Am.Jur.2d 49, at 619.
</p><p>
	Both kinds of threats involve immediate harm.  The first kind of coercive manipulative threat interferes with the freedom of choice or autonomy of the person to whom the threat is directed. The second kind of fear-inducing or terroristic threat creates anxiety and disruption.
</p><p>
	(b)<i> The Meaning of &quot;Threat&quot; in 18 U.S.C. 875(c)</i>
</p>
<p>	When first enacted in 1934, the statute now codified at 18 U.S.C. 875 punished only interstate transmission of threats designed to extort money or other things of value.  The statute was amended in 1939 to include threats to injure the person of another without an intent to extort.  See United States v. Heller, 579 F.2d 990, 995-98 (6th Cir. 1978); United States v. Pennell, 144 F.Supp. 317, 318-19 (N.D. Calif. 1956).  Thus, under the present statute, the threat need not be coercive; it is sufficient that it induces apprehension.  The harm that is the touchstone of whether a threat in the sense of 875(c) exists is &quot;fear of violence&quot; and &quot;the disruption that fear engenders.&quot;  R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 2546, 120 L.Ed.2d 305, 321 (1992).  In this respect, for purposes of 875(c), &quot;a threat is not a state of mind in the threatener; it is an appearance to the victim.&quot;  United States v. Cox, 957 F.2d 264, 266 (6th Cir. 1992), quoting United States v. Holzer, 816 F.2d 304, 310 (7th Cir.), vacated on other grounds, 484 U.S. 807 (1987).
</p>
<p>	This emphasis on the auditor's response accounts for certain odd features of the law relating to threats under 875(c), on which the Government's proposed jury instruction in the present case relies: 
<blockquote>
<p>	1. Neither an actual intent nor the present ability to carry out the threat are said to be required. United States v. Holder, 302 F.Supp. 296, 300 (D. Mont. 1969), aff'd per curiam, 427 F.2d 715 (9th Cir. 1970).  Threatening to kill a non-existent hostage would constitute a sufficient threat if the context made it credible.  See United States v. Cooper, 523 F.2d 8 (6th Cir. 1975), although actually a case under 18 U.S.C. 875(b).
</p>
<p>	2. In most circuits, the accused does not even have to intend that the recipient fear that the threat will be carried out.  The Ninth Circuit requires &quot;specific intent.&quot; United States v. Twine, 853 F.2d 676, 679-81 (9th Cir. 1988).  Elsewhere, including the Sixth Circuit, the question is whether the defendant reasonably should have known that his statement would be perceived as a serious expression of an intent to injure.  It is sufficient, in other words, that a defendant who should have known better created the apprehension of injury.  United States v. DeAndino, 958 U.S. 146 (6th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 2997, 120 L.Ed.2d 874 (1992).  Accord, United States v. Darby, 37 F.3d 1059 (4th Cir, 1994).  For a similar interpretation of cognate statutes, see United States v. Smith, 928 F.2d 740 (6th Cir. 1991); United States v. Vincent, 681 F.2d 462, 464 (6th Cir. 1982).  Thus, it can be said of 875(c), as it has been said of 18 U.S.C. 786, which prohibits mailing communications containing threats, that the &quot;true gravamen of the offense&quot; is not the defendant's &quot;subjective intent,&quot; but rather the making of a threat which disrupts &quot;the recipient's sense of personal safety and well-being.&quot;  United States v. Bellrichard, 994 F.2d 1319, 1323-24 (8th Cir. 1993), quoting United States v. Manning, 923 F.2d 83, 86 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 111 S.Ct. 2860, 115 L.Ed 2d 1027 (1991).
</p>
</p>	3. It is not required that the defendant induce fear on the part of the person he proposes to injure.  That person need not know of the threat.  The threat does not have to reach the person threatened.  See Seeber v. United States, 329 F.2d 572 (9th Cir. 1964).  It is said to be sufficient to show that the threat was likely to induce fear that the defendant would act according to its tenor.  United States v. Holder, supra, 302 F.Supp. at 301.  This has been said, however, in cases in which the defendant was more or less open about the threat.  In Holder, for instance, the defendant phoned the F.B.I., threatening to cut off someone's head.   Similarly, in United States v. Schroeder, 902 F.2d 1469 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 867 (1990), a threat conveyed through an Assistant U.S. Attorney was held to be sufficient.
</p></blockquote>
<p>	In Schroeder, moreover, the defendant threatened a whole class of people.  The court held that a specific individual does not have to be the target of the threat: a threat focused on a class of people at a particular location may suffice.  See also United States v. Cox, 957 F.2d 264, 266 (6th Cir. 1992), where the threat also was to hurt a &quot;lot of people&quot; at a defined location.  Besides prompting possible fear on the part of people who are the target of the treat, such open threats (like those against public officials) provoke the employment of substantial governmental resources to prevent their fulfillment and, even before that, to ascertain whether a genuine danger indeed exists.  See Kent Greenawalt, Speech, Crime, &amp; the Uses of Language 91, 291 (Oxford University Press 1989).
</p>
<p>	These rules make sense only insofar as threats are the type that provoke anxiety and disruption and so have immediate social costs.  They make no sense at all applied to a case like the present in which the alleged &quot;threat&quot; takes the form of the private confidential communication of morbid fantasies and desires.  Mr. Baker's messages amounted to an ongoing personal conversation -- intimate, secret, and undivulged -- the antithesis of the open threats at issue in prior case law.  They were communications the intended and likely effect of which was to gratify the recipient, not to disquiet.
<p>
	(c)<i> The Meaning of &quot;Threat&quot; in the Indictment</i>
</p>
<p>	The Government's case against Mr. Baker depends on taking out of context rules meant to be applied to certain kinds of threats and applying them mechanically to a very different type of statement. In this respect, the indictment goes beyond existing law.  It assumes that the expression of sadistic thoughts constitutes a threat, no matter what the context in which uttered.   The notion of &quot;threat&quot; underlying the indictment differs from that in previous reported cases under 875(c), which uniformly assume that a threat is supposed to intimidate or induce apprehension in the minds of persons who can be expected to become aware of it.  Here, in contrast, the messages in question served only to titillate their intended audience. </p>

<p>	Without a coercive or anxiety-inducing threat, there is no immediate harm.  The only conceivable harm is the possibility that the speaker will act on his desires.  If anything, such a &quot;threat&quot; constitutes a form of inchoate preparatory crime, but without the requirements of firmness of purpose and of a specific act or agreement that are supposed to prevent other inchoate crimes (such as attempt and conspiracy) from amounting purely to thought-crimes. As shown in the next section of this brief, treating such a declaration of intention or desire as criminal per se would violate the First Amendment.  The statute should not be construed to do so: it is a &quot;cardinal principle&quot; that a statute should be interpreted, where possible, to avoid questions about its constitutional validity.  Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288, 348 (1936)(Brandeis J., concurring).

<h4>II.  READING 18 U.S.C. 875(c) TO COVER THE STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO THE DEFENDANT IN THE INDICTMENT WOULD BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE GUARANTEE OF FREE SPEECH CONTAINED IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT.</h4>
<p>	Threats often are communicated through forms of expression normally protected by the First Amendment.  Nevertheless, at least certain kinds of threats are not regarded as the sort of speech which the First Amendment renders immune from proscription.  See Doe v. University of Michigan, 721 F.Supp. 852, 862 (E.D.Mich. 1989); see also John T. Nockleby, &quot;Hate Speech in Context: The Case of Verbal Threats,&quot; 42 Buff. L. Rev. 653, 661 (1994). 
</p><p>	There is disagreement about why this is so, about whether such threats should be regarded as speech at all (as opposed to constitutionally unprotected conduct), or whether they are speech, but nonetheless so harmful or valueless as to be subject to legal restriction.  Thus, Professor Kent Greenawalt has proposed a taxonomy of threats, at least some of which (such as &quot;manipulative&quot; as opposed to &quot;unconditional threats&quot; and &quot;warning inducements&quot;) would fall outside the scope of the First Amendment because they are ways of doing things, not asserting things. See K. Greenawalt, Speech, Crime, &amp; the Uses of Language, esp. at 66-68, 90-109, 249-59, 290-92 (Oxford University Press 1989); see also Greenawalt, &quot;Criminal Coercion and Freedom of Speech,&quot; 78 Nw.U. L. Rev. 1081 (1984); Greenawalt, &quot;Speech and Crime,&quot; 1980 Am. B. Found. Research J. 645. On the other hand, this way of classifying threats has been criticized on the ground that the First Amendment applies to all forms of speech; in certain circumstances speech may be harmful and therefore subject to regulation because of its unacceptable results, but not because it constitutes &quot;conduct&quot; or a &quot;performative utterance&quot; entirely beyond the purview of the First Amendment. See, especially, Franklyn S. Haiman, &quot;Speech Acts&quot; and the First Amendment 10-20 (Southern Illinois University Press 1993); see also F.S. Haiman, Speech and Law in a Free Society (University of Chicago Press 1981), and Haiman's &quot;Comments&quot; on Greenawalt in 78 Nw.U. L. Rev. 1125 (1984); cf. C. Edwin Baker, Human Liberty and Freedom of Speech 62-65 (Oxford University Press 1989).
</p><p>	As a practical matter, either view requires distinguishing genuine (unprotected) threats from constitutionally protected utterances that may be labeled &quot;threats&quot; by a misguided prosecutor. See Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 707 (1969): &quot;a statute such as this one, which makes criminal a form of pure speech, must be interpreted with the commands of the First Amendment clearly in mind.  What is a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech.&quot;  And how the distinction is drawn will depend in turn on the reasons certain types of threats are unprotected despite the fact that they involve &quot;pure speech.&quot;
</p><p>	In R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992), Justice Scalia's majority opinion gives as &quot;the reasons why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment&quot; the countervailing objectives of &quot;protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption that fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur.&quot;  112 S.Ct. at 2546, 120 L.Ed.2d at 321. 
</p><p>	These potential harms are not talismanic: the extent to which they actually warrant restricting speech requires careful analysis.   But the opinion in R.A.V. at least provides an authoritative sketch or checklist of possibly relevant factors.
</p><p>	Neither of the first two reasons mentioned in R.A.V. obtains where, as in the present case, the allegedly threatening statements were made in private communications under circumstances extremely unlikely to produce either fear or disruption.  The only conceivable basis for treating Mr. Baker's statements as subject to prosecution is the objective of protecting individuals &quot;from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur.&quot;  112 S.Ct. at 2546, 120 L.Ed 2d at 321. 
</p><p>	This is a case of &quot;pure speech.&quot;  No immediate harm results from the expression of a desire to commit a crime.  The only warrant for proscribing such expression is the possibility that it will produce harm, should the speaker act on his desire, in the future.  An assertion of intent or desire unattended by any immediate harm is an utterance falling within the broad range of communications to which the First Amendment applies.  Cf. K. Greenawalt, Speech, Crime, &amp; The Uses of Language, supra, at 91.  This conclusion is confirmed by Watts v. United States, supra, which treated expression of an intent to harm the president as an utterance falling, at least prima facie, within the scope of the First Amendment.
</p><p>	In United States v. Kelner, supra, the Second Circuit held that, in order to satisfy First Amendment concerns, the word &quot;threat&quot; in 18 U.S.C. 875(c) must be read to require a threat that &quot;on its face and in the circumstances in which it is made is so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific as to the person threatened, as to convey a gravity of purpose and imminent prospect of execution....&quot; 534 F.2d at 1027.  Application of this test to the &quot;threats&quot; Mr. Baker is alleged to have made would require dismissing the indictment, even if they had been made openly under circumstances apt to induce disquiet and disruption.  It clearly requires dismissing the indictment, given the context in which his supposititious &quot;threats&quot; were uttered.
</p><p>	In Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47 (1919), the Supreme Court held that restrictions on speech cannot be justified merely on the basis that speech may have adverse consequences in the future.  That speech may produce some future harm is not in itself sufficient to warrant its suppression.  It is precisely in such cases, where the harm is not immediate, that regulation of speech is limited to utterances presenting an imminent danger of substantive evil.  &quot;Fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free speech....  To justify suppression of free speech there must be reasonable ground to fear that serious evil will result if free speech is practiced.  There must be reasonable ground to believe that the danger apprehended is imminent.&quot;  Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 376-77 (1927) (Brandeis J., concurring). 
</p><p>	In a case where a speaker urges others to violate the law, the constitutional guarantee of free speech will not permit proscription of such advocacy except where it &quot;is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to induce or produce such action.&quot;  Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447 (1969).  The danger must be clear.  It must be present.  It must be immediately likely to be realized.  It must be imminent.  
</p><p>	Whatever danger the messages in the present case even arguably embody does not approximate what is required to justify criminal prosecution.  The conversation at issue consisted primarily of general references to the thoughts and ideas of each participant.  The limited discussion of future deeds -- besides appearing to constitute an attempt to further arouse rather than to impart sincere intentions -- in any event described actions that were decidedly nonspecific and expressly not imminent.  Mr. Baker discussed, for example, what he &quot;want[s] to do,&quot; what he &quot;need[s] to do,&quot; what he would &quot;love to&quot; do, and what the two might consider doing &quot;[i]f not next week, or in January, then defin[ite]ly sometime in the Summer.&quot;  To glean from this conversation reasonable grounds to expect imminent danger is wholly unfounded.
</p>
<p>	Cases like Brandenburg deal with encouraging others to violate the law.  But the principles enunciated therein also are applicable a fortiori to the expression of a desire or intent to violate the law oneself.  Otherwise, there would be punishment for mere thought or, more precisely, for giving voice to one's thoughts.   Punishment for the expression of thought without the imminence of further harm is incompatible with the first principles of a free society.  It is punishment for the expression of a distasteful idea.  Without immediate harm or the imminent likelihood of some further harm of proper concern to government, punishing the expression of distasteful ideas amounts to the proscription of thought.  &quot;The notion of thought-crimes is not consistent with that of a free society.&quot; P.J. Fitzgerald, Criminal Law and Punishment 97 (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1962).
 </p><h4>	Conclusion
</h4>
<p>	The indictment in this case extends the term &quot;threat&quot; in 18 U.S.C. 875(c) beyond its generally accepted meaning and represents an effort to penalize thought and expression protected by the First Amendment.  Amicus therefore urges that the indictment be dismissed.

<blockquote>
<p>Respondent was arrested by Phoenix police during a routine traffic
 stop when a patrol car's computer indicated that there was an
 outstanding misdemeanor warrant for his arrest.  A subsequent
 search of his car revealed a bag of marijuana, and he was charged
 with possession.  Respondent moved to suppress the marijuana as
 the fruit of an unlawful arrest, since the misdemeanor warrant had
 been quashed before his arrest.  The trial court granted the motion,
 but the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the exclusion-
 ary rule's purpose would not be served by excluding evidence ob-
 tained because of an error by employees not directly associated with
 the arresting officers or their police department.  In reversing, the
 Arizona Supreme Court rejected the distinction between clerical
 errors committed by law enforcement personnel and similar mis-
 takes by court employees and predicted that the exclusionary rule's
 application would serve to improve the efficiency of criminal justice
 system recordkeepers.

<h4>Held:</h4>
<p>
  1.  This Court has jurisdiction to review the State Supreme
Court's decision.  Under Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, when a
state-court decision fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law,
or to be interwoven with federal law, and when the adequacy and
independence of any possible state-law ground is not clear from the
opinion's face, this Court will accept as the most reasonable expla-
nation that the state court decided the case the way it did because
it believed that federal law required it to do so.  This standard for
determining whether a state-court decision rests upon an adequate
and independent state ground was adopted (1) to obviate the unsat-
isfactory and intrusive practice of requiring state courts to clarify
their decisions to this Court's satisfaction and (2) to provide state
judges with a clearer opportunity to develop state jurisprudence
unimpeded by federal interference and yet preserve the federal law's
integrity.  Michigan properly serves its purpose and should not be
disturbed.  State courts are free both to interpret state constitu-
tional provisions to accord greater protection to individual rights
than do similar provisions of the United States Constitution and to
serve as experimental laboratories.  However, in cases where they
interpret the United States Constitution, they are not free from the
final authority of this Court.  In this case, the State Supreme Court
based its decision squarely upon its interpretation of federal law
when it discussed the appropriateness of applying the exclusionary
rule, and it offered no plain statement that its references to federal
law were being used only for the purpose of guidance and did not
compel the result reached. 
</p>
<p>
  2.  The exclusionary rule does not require suppression of evidence
seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment where the erroneous
information resulted from clerical errors of court employees.  The
exclusionary rule is a judicially created remedy designed to safe-
guard against future violations of Fourth Amendment rights through
its deterrent effect.  However, the issue of exclusion is separate
from whether the Amendment has been violated.  The Amendment
does not expressly preclude the use of evidence obtained in violation
of its commands, and exclusion is appropriate only where the rule's
remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served.  The same
framework that this Court used in United States v. Leon, 468 U. S.
897, to determine that there was no sound reason to apply the
exclusionary rule as a means of deterring misconduct on the part of
judicial officers responsible for issuing search warrants applies in
this case.  The exclusionary rule was historically designed as a
means of deterring police misconduct, not mistakes by court employ-
ees.  See id., at 916.  In addition, respondent offers no evidence that
court employees are inclined to ignore or subvert the Fourth Amend-
ment or that lawlessness among these actors requires application of
the extreme sanction of exclusion.  See ibid.  In fact, the Justice
Court Clerk testified that this type of error occurred only once every
three or four years.  Finally, there is no basis for believing that
application of the exclusionary rule will have a significant effect on
court employees responsible for informing the police that a warrant
has been quashed.  Since they are not adjuncts to the law enforce-
ment team engaged in ferreting out crime, they have no stake in
the outcome of particular prosecutions.  Application of the exclusion-
ary rule also could not be expected to alter an arresting officer's
behavior, since there is no indication that the officer here was not
acting reasonably when he relied upon the computer record.

<H2>ACLU Participation Before the Supreme Court for the 1996 Term -- Summaries
of Argument</H2>
<H3><A NAME="abrams"></A>ABRAMS, et al, v. JOHNSON, et al </H3>
<P>No. 95-1425  (direct in support of appellants) </P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>The district court abused its equitable powers in completely redrawing the
congressional map of Georgia. The powers of the federal courts must be adequate
to the task of fashioning remedies for violations, but those powers are limited.
Any remedy must be related to the conditions that are found to offend the
Constitution.</P>
<P>In the area of redistricting, deference by federal courts to state policy
choices is especially compelling. That is true because the states have primary
responsibility for apportionment. Then a district court must act in the
legislature's stead, it must accomplish its task circumspectly, and in a manner
that is free from any taint of arbitrariness or discrimination.</P>
<P>The district court ignored the state's traditional interest in preserving
the core of existing districts. It completely relocated the Eleventh District
and placed it in the northeast Atlanta corridor because it felt that was a
better location for the district. The court also drastically reconfigured other
districts, including the Third, the Eighth, and the Tenth.</P>
<P>The court's plan moved incumbents and pitted them against each other in a

number of districts in disregard for the state's traditional policy of avoiding
contests between incumbents. Two of the three dislocated incumbents were black,
and only these two were placed in new districts with other incumbents.</P>
<P>The court's plan shifted nearly a third of the state's population into new
districts. Least-change plans proposed by the parties and amici showed that it
was possible to draw far less disruptive plans that at the same time cured the
constitutional defects in the prior plan.</P>
<P>The court eliminated two of the three majority black districts in the
existing plan, despite its acknowledgment of the legislature's decision to
create a second majority black district after the 1990 census. The court's
justification for refusing to draw a second majority black  district was that
Georgia's minority population was not geographically compact. The legislature,
however, in enacting its first plan was of the view that the black population
was sufficiently compact to constitute a majority in a second congressional
district.</P>
<P>Proposed remedial plans were also submitted by the parties and amici which
showed that a compact second majority black district can be drawn in Georgia
while adhering to the state's traditional districting principles.</P>
<P>As long as a state does not subordinate-traditional redistricting principles
to race, it may intentionally create majority-minority districts, and may
otherwise take race into consideration, without being subjected to strict
scrutiny.</P>
<P>The court's plan violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Blacks in
Georgia are geographically compact. As appears from various plans submitted to
the district court, it is clearly possible to draw two reasonably compact
majority black congressional districts in the state.</P>
<P>Blacks are also politically cohesive, while their preferred candidates are
usually defeated by whites voting as a bloc. As the lower court found, a
district containing approximately 55% of black registered voters was necessary
to avoid dilution of minority voting strength.</P>
<P>The district court's plan is retrogressive in violation of Section 5. The
court's plan reduced the number of majority black districts from the levels in
the third legislative plan (which had three of eleven) and the first legislative
plan (which had two of eleven), to only one of eleven in a state that is 27%
black. Minorities admittedly have fewer electoral opportunities under the court
ordered plan than under any of these pre-existing plans.</P>
<P>The court used the 1982 plan as a benchmark for measuring retrogression. The
1982 plan was not only malapportioned but contained ten districts while the 1992
plan contains eleven. The ten seat 1982 plan by definition cannot serve as a
reasonable benchmark by which to evaluate the court's eleven seat plan. The most
appropriate benchmarks for determining retrogression are either the state's
initial eleven seat plan containing two majority black districts, or the state's
policy and goal of creating two majority black districts. Using either of these
benchmarks, the court ordered plan would violate the retrogression standard of
Section 5.</P>
<P>The court's plan does not comply with one person, one vote. Congressional.
redistricting is held to even stricter standards than legislative redistricting.
The total deviation among districts in the district court's plan is 0.35%. Plans
with lower overall deviations were submitted to the court by the United States
(0.19%) and by appellants (0.29 %). Other district courts have had no difficulty
in drafting or approving plans with zero deviations.</P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="arizonans"></A>ARIZONANS FOR OFFICIAL ENGLISH, et al., v. STATE
OF ARIZONA, et al.</H3>
<P>No. 95-974  (amicus in support of respondents)</P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>Article 28 of the Arizona Constitution is unlike any other law ever
challenged on First Amendment grounds in this Court.  It is a sweeping
injunction against speech in any language other than English, harming vital
First Amendment interests of the public without any record evidence of a
compelling, substantial or even rational justification.</P>
<P>On its face, Article 28 explicitly suppresses a vast body of pure speech.
Its sweep affects virtually every transaction between non-English speakers and
every branch of state and local government in Arizona. Its injunction against
speech is indiscriminate and ex ante: it effectively precludes non-English
speaking Arizonans, whatever their circumstances and needs, from communicating
and interacting with their governments, including state and local legislators
and their aides, even if the public employees and officials are willing and able
to use non-English languages. It attempts to coerce compliance with a linguistic
orthodoxy in a manner which actually undermines, rather than promotes, national
unity. The extraordinary nature of this law -- whose proscriptions are so
remarkably broad and sweeping as to defy the usual First Amendment categories of
content and viewpoint neutrality -- warrants strict judicial scrutiny.</P>
<P>Petitioners contend that Article 28 should not be subject to any meaningful
scrutiny, because it merely governs the State's speech in &quot;internal
operations&quot; over which the government has virtually complete control.
However, limiting this case to government control over us speech, internal or
other-wise, ignores the most important participants in this First Amendment
equation: the non-English speaking members of the public, joint stakeholders in
the communications banned by Article 28, who will no longer be able to
communicate and interact with the government on an almost limitless range of
subjects. Article 28, therefore, strikes at the core of participatory democracy
and undermines a fundamental value of the First Amendment -- the facilitation of
self governance essential to a democratically organized society.</P>
<P>These burdens, moreover, are selectively and discriminatorily imposed,
purposefully falling on a discrete and historically disadvantaged segment of the
public -- comprised almost exclusively of ethnic minorities and immigrants --
who are thereby excluded from virtually all communications with government
regardless of their importance to the individual.</P>
<P>This case, therefore, is not controlled by the Court's public employee or
government speech cases. Pickering v.  Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563 (1968),
and its progeny have all concerned the protection afforded to speech initiated
by a particular employee (such as a presentation to the board of education, a
complaint to co-workers about working conditions, or writings or speeches to the
public). In contrast, Article 28's ban interferes with interactive
communications between citizens and their government, and thus directly
infringes the First Amendment rights of the public as well as those of public
employees or officials. Moreover, unlike Pickering, the State does not assert
any employment-related justification for Article 28.</P>
<P>Nor does Article 28 embody the government's interest in communicating a
particularized message or viewpoint such as the advisability of abortion (<A
HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cases/89-1391.html">Rust v. Sullivan, 50
0 U.S. 173 (1991)</A>) or the political nature of particular films (Meese v.
Keene, 481 U.S. 465 (1987)). Rather, it bars an entire medium of speech
irrespective of its substantive content or message.</P>

<P>Furthermore, even assuming the government may under certain circumstances
restrict public employees from using non-English languages in the course of
their duties, Article 28's indiscriminate reach is fatally overbroad. It bars
non-English communications not only by Maria-Kelley Yniguez, but also by elected
officials communicating with their constituencies, by judges performing marriage
ceremonies, and by public teachers, academics, and librarians in and out of the
classroom.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the Court's consideration of the constitutionality of Article

28 cannot be constrained by the mechanical application of public employee speech

cases nor by the general proposition that the government has significant control

over the content of its own speech. Rather, Article 28 must be examined in light

of, and subject to searching scrutiny consistent with, the multiple First
Amendment interests directly and substantially affected by its sweeping ban.
Under this standard -- indeed, even under a less rigorous standard of review -- 
the asserted justifications for Article 28 are unpersuasive.</P>
<P>Although Petitioners assert that Article 28 will make the government more
efficient, the State of Arizona has stipulated that its administrative
efficiency and operational effectiveness is enhanced, not impeded, by its
employees' ability to use non-English languages in the course of their duties.
Indeed, independent of the State's stipulation, Article 28 undermines the
asserted governmental interest in ensuring that its communications are &quot;neither

<P>The general social goals Petitioners advance also fail to withstand

reasonably, tailored to enhance English proficiency: it indiscriminately
penalizes all non-English speakers by preventing them from interacting and
communicating with government regardless of their circumstances or needs. Most
importantly, Article 28 does not foster by &quot;persuasion and example&quot;
the goal of national unity. See West Virginia State Board of Education v.
Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 640-42 (1943). Rather, Article 28 is an
unconstitutionally coercive measure which categorically disenfranchises a
discrete, disadvantaged and vulnerable segment of the population. Ultimately,
its imposition of a rigid linguistic orthodoxy not only suppresses
constitutionally protected communication in non-&quot;official&quot; languages,

<P><A HREF="/court/blessing.html">Blessing v. Freestone <I>amicus</I> brief</A></P>
<P><A NAME="summary"></A>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>Although the word &quot;federalism&quot; does not appear in the
Constitution, there is no doubt that it is crucial to the American
constitutional system.  Federalism refers to the division of powers between the
national and the state governments.  Under our constitutional system, each has
its own sphere of authority and responsibility.  Properly understood, therefore,
federalism is as much about preserving the power and responsibility of the
federal government as it is about preserving the power and responsibility of the
states.</P>
<P>Petitioner emphasizes one aspect of federalism:  safeguarding state
governments from federal encroachments.  The Tenth Amendment's limits on
Congress and the Eleventh Amendment's restrictions on the federal judicial power
reflect this constitutional concern.  See, e.g., Seminole Tribe of Florida v.
Florida, 517 U.S.    , 116 S.Ct. 1114 (1996); New York v. United States, 505
U.S. 144 (1992).</P>
<P>Petitioner, however, ignores the other aspect of federalism:  protecting the
interests of the national government.  The single most important constitutional
provision concerning federalism is found in Article VI:  &quot;The Constitution,
and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and
all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United
States, shall be the Supreme Law of the Land.&quot;  In short, federalism is
also, in major part, about ensuring the supremacy of federal law.  Sterling v.
Constantin, 287 U.S. 378, 397 (1932); see also U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v.
Thornton, 514 U.S.    ,    , 115 S.Ct. 1842, 1872 (1995)(Kennedy, J.,
concurring)(emphasizing that federalism is about protecting both state
sovereignty and the interests of the national government).</P>
<P>There is no doubt that &#167;1983 was meant to empower the federal courts to
review state and local actions to ensure their compliance with federal law. 
During the debates preceding enactment of ?1983, one Congressman and Senator
after another so declared.  Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess. 321 (1871)(remarks
of Rep. Stoughton); see also id. at 374-76 (remarks of Rep. Lowe); id. at 459
(remarks of Rep. Coburn); id. at 609 (remarks of Sen. Pool); id. at 687 (remarks
of Sen. Surz); id. at 691 (remarks of Sen. Edmunds).  Likewise, this Court has
often recognized the critical importance of federal court review in assuring
state compliance with the Constitution and laws of the United States.  See,
e.g., Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225 (1972).</P>
<P>Contrary to petitioner's argument in this case, Ex Parte Young and Maine v.
Thiboutot are not at war with federalism, they are essential to its
preservation.  It is through suits against state officers pursuant to Ex Parte
Young that state compliance with federal law is achieved.  As the Court noted in
Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 105
(1984)(Pennhurst II):  &quot;Our decisions repeatedly have emphasized that the
Young doctrine rests on the need to promote the vindication of federal rights.&quot;
 Id. at 105.  Or, as the Court explained in Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 68
(1986):  &quot;[T]he availability of prospective relief of the sort awarded in
Ex Parte Young gives life to the supremacy clause.&quot;</P>
<P>Likewise, it is through Maine v. Thiboutot that suits can be brought,
pursuant to &#167;1983, to ensure state and local compliance with federal
statutes.  Thus, after again reviewing the legislative history of &#167;1983 in
Maine v. Thiboutot, the Court concluded that &quot;there can be no doubt that [&#167;1983]
was intended to provide a remedy, to be broadly construed, against all forms of
official violation of federally protected rights.&quot;  448 U.S. at 5, quoting
Monell v. New York City Dep't of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 700-701 (1978).</P>
<P>Petitioner's brief is breathtaking in its willingness to disregard this
Court's well-established jurisprudence and impose new restrictions on federal
court jurisdiction.  For all practical purposes, petitioner seeks to overrule Ex
Parte Young by contending that the Eleventh Amendment bars all suits, including
suits for injunctive and declaratory relief, where it is the state that is the
real party in interest.  Pet.Br. at 25.  In Young itself, the State of Minnesota
was the real party in interest:  the injunction against Edward Young was to
prevent the enforcement of a state statute.  Indeed, in virtually every case,
suits pursuant to Ex Parte Young are brought to enjoin enforcement of a state
law or policy; ultimately, the state is the real party in interest in all these
cases.  In addition, petitioner expressly calls for this Court to overrule its
decision in Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1.  Pet.Br. at 30-48.</P>
<P>The radical changes urged by petitioner would dramatically upset the
allocation of power between the national and state governments by allowing
states to violate federal law with impunity.  Instead of promoting federalism,
the changes urged by petitioner would do exactly the opposite and would abandon
the framers' plan for a national government supreme over the states.</P>

<P><A HREF="/court/jones.html">Clinton v. Jones <I>amicus</I> brief</A></P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>Under Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 756, a President's entitlement to
absolute immunity does not apply to actions taken beyond &quot;the 'outer
perimeter' of his official responsibility.&quot; The question presented here is
whether a claim for damages that would otherwise be permissible under Fitzgerald
should automatically, and in every case, be &quot;deferred&quot; until the
expiration of the President's term in office.</P>
<P>We respectfully suggest that the answer to that question is no for two
fundamental reasons. First, the notion of deferring any litigation activity
involving the President for up to eight years in all damage cases is
inconsistent with our nation's deeply held view that no person is above the law.</P>
<P>Second, the argument in favor of an automatic stay in all cases, regardless
of circumstances, undervalues the very real prejudice that such a delay may
create to aggrieved litigants. Among other things, memories fade and evidence
becomes stale. The odds of prevailing on even nonfrivolous claims thus
inevitably decline.</P>
<P>In some cases, that price may be inescapable. In others, it surely is not.
Trial judges can and should be trusted to balance these competing interests with
due deference to the special burdens faced by the President in fulfilling his
duties. In particular, a trial court may fully utilize its authority over the
pace and procedures of litigation to minimize the demands on the President. An
automatic deferral of all litigation would, on the other hand, strip trial
judges of their traditional case management responsibilities and effectively
expand a President's absolute immunity from damages well beyond the carefully
defined limits set forth in Fitzgerald.</P>
<P>The law disfavors immunities. Accordingly, the burden is upon the party
seeking an immunity to establish its need. Neither the President nor his amici
acknowledge this well established rule, nor do they seek to satisfy it except in
the most general way -- by emphasizing the importance of allowing the President
to conduct the nation's business without undue distraction. We agree with the
importance of that interest, as did both courts below. The duties of the
President of the United States, particularly with respect to foreign policy, are
uniquely demanding. Presidents are called upon, often at all hours, to respond
to national crises. But, as both courts below also held, it simply does not
follow that no litigation can ever take place against a sitting President.</P>
<P>One of the major fears seems to be a threatened avalanche of frivolous
lawsuits motivated by partisan political considerations. In our view, that fear
is overstated. Nothing in the historical record supports it. Trial judges
already have an arsenal of weapons at their disposal to deal with frivolous
lawsuits if they occur. Finally, if not deterred by the prospect of sanctions,
such lawsuits will be routinely dismissed with little or no demands on the
President's time.</P>
<P>The difficult issue arises in nonfrivolous cases where the stakes are
undeniably higher, both for the President and the opposing litigant. Even in
this context, however, the demands on a President's time necessarily vary at
different stages of the litigation, and from case to case. The absolute rule
proposed by the President in this case does not take account of these
differences. Instead, it effectively obliterates the line between official and
unofficial conduct that this Court carefully established in Fitzgerald as the
basis for a President's absolute immunity.</P>
<P>The President is not like any other litigant. But, like any other litigant,
the President should still be required to justify a requested delay in the
proceedings by showing that, given the particular phase of the case (e.g.,
motion to dismiss, deposition, interrogatory), the suit will significantly
interfere with his ability to carry out the specific duties of his office then
commanding his attention, and that his ability to carry out those duties cannot
be preserved by a less drastic alternative than a potential eight-year stay. The
decision below is consistent with that approach and should be affirmed.</P>

<H3><A NAME="edwards"></A>EDWARDS, et al, v. BALISOK</H3>
<P>No. 95-1352  (amicus in support of respondent) </P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>In Heck v. Humphrey, 114 S. Ct. 2364 (1994), this Court held that a state
prisoner cannot bring a damages action under 42 U.S.C.  1983 for constitutional
violations leading to his conviction, if success in that action would
necessarily imply the invalidity of his outstanding criminal conviction. The
Court in Heck also reaffirmed its holding in Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539
(1974), that a prisoner may bring a damages action for use of unconstitutional
prison disciplinary procedures in depriving him of good time credits, if the
unconstitutionality of those procedures does not necessarily vitiate the denial
of good time, and the action therefore does not call into question the
lawfulness of the prisoner's continuing confinement.</P>
<P>The courts of appeals have uniformly followed Heck and held that a prisoner
may not bring a section 1983 damages action for wrongful disciplinary procedures
if success in that action would necessarily result in restoration of the
prisoner's good time. Conversely, if the claim is simply for using the wrong
procedures, and does not necessarily implicate the loss of good time, the action
may proceed under Section 1983. This was the rule applied by the court of
appeals below.</P>
<P>Petitioners propose a radically new rule that would require this Court to
abandon both Heck and Wolff. Petitioners' proposed rule is unintelligible and
would defy easy or consistent application in the lower courts. It is unsupported
by either the language or the legislative history of Section 1983 or 28 U.S.C.
Section 2254. Petitioners' arguments in support of their proposed rule are

policy arguments about the optimal scope of section 1983, and are properly
addressed to Congress rather than this Court.</P>
<P>The Court should decline petitioners' invitation to abandon Heck and Wolff.
It should hold, consistent with those cases, that a state prisoner may bring an
action under &#167; 1983 for a deprivation of procedural due process in a prison
disciplinary proceeding, as long as success in that action would not necessarily
result in restoration of good time credits taken in that proceeding. It should
then affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, because respondent's success
in his &#167; 1983 action would not necessarily result in restoration of his
good time.</P>
<P>A fortiori, a former state prisoner who has completed his sentence, like
amicus Gotcher, may directly seek damages under &#167; 1983 for wrongful
deprivation of good time credits, since the restoration of good time cannot
possibly result from the &#167; 1983 action. Because such a person is not in
custody, and therefore cannot invoke federal habeas corpus jurisdiction to seek
restoration of his credits, damages under &#167; 1983 are the only federal
remedy for the violation of his federal constitutional rights. Absent the
possibility of proceeding under the more specific habeas corpus statute, the
plain language of &#167; 1983 grants the former prisoner a cause of action for
damages for wrongful deprivation of good time credits.</P>
<P>Finally, Heck left undisturbed Wolff's holding that a state prisoner may
seek prospective injunctive relief from unconstitutional prison disciplinary
procedures. A claim for such relief does not call into question the lawfulness
of the plaintiff's continuing confinement.</P>

<H3><A NAME="idaho"></A>STATE OF IDAHO, et al, v. COEUR d'ALENE TRIBE, et al.</H3>
<P>No. 94-1474  (amicus in support of respondents)</P>
<P><A HREF="coeur.html">Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe Brief</A></P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>The Tribe's claims against Idaho state officials for declaratory and
injunctive relief fall squarely within the exception to the Eleventh Amendment
articulated by the Court in Ex Parte Young.</P>
<P>Under the Young doctrine, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar a federal
court from adjudicating a claim for prospective declaratory and injunctive
relief against state officials who allegedly act contrary to federal law. Here,
the Tribe claims that Idaho state officials, by regulating and administering the
land in question, are violating federal law.</P>
<P>They are intruding on property rights conferred on the Tribe by a federal
statute. The relief sought by the Tribe is prospective, as opposed to
retrospective, in nature. It seeks to prevent further violations of its property
rights. It does not seek damages or restitution for past wrongs, nor does it
seek to rescind a past transfer of property.</P>
<P>Idaho state officials argue that the Young doctrine does not apply to this
action, or to any action involving real property. More specifically, they
contend that real property actions against state officials should be barred by
the Eleventh Amendment because such suits actually seek to adjudicate the
state's interest in or right to properly and cannot resolve title disputes. They
further contend that they are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity in this
action because Idaho has a greater right to the disputed property than the Tribe
and the Tribe can bring suit against Idaho to quiet title in state court.</P>
<P>Idaho state officials' arguments should be rejected. First, the Young
doctrine has been used repeatedly to enforce real and personal properly rights
where, as here, the right to possess the property is founded in federal law or
the deprivation of the property raises federal constitutional or statutory

concerns. See, e.g., Meigs v. M'Clung's Lessee,13 U.S. (9 Cranch.) 11 (1815);
United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196 (1882); Poindexter v. Greenhow, 114 U.S. 270
(1884); Pennoyer v. McConnaughy,140 U.S.1 (1891); Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U.S. 137
(1897); Goltra v. Weeks, 271 U.S. 536 (1926); Florida Dep't of State v. Treasure
Salvors, Inc., 458 U.S. 670.</P>
<P>Creation of a real property exception to the Young doctrine would not only
require the Court to overrule 200 years of jurisprudence, but would also
seriously jeopardize the federal constitutional right to enjoy, own and dispose
of property without undue governmental interference. Those deprived of such a
right would not be able to bring suit in federal court to seek vindication.</P>
<P>Second, as this Court has repeatedly recognized, all actions using the Young
doctrine are actions seeking to adjudicate a state's interests or rights.
Pennhurst State School &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89,101-02 (1984);
Kentucky v.  Graham, 473 U.S.159,166 (1985). Real property actions are no
different.</P>
<P>Third, the fact that such suits cannot resolve title disputes is largely
irrelevant. Here, as against the state officials, plaintiffs only seek cessation
of those of Idaho's regulatory powers that are harmful to the Tribe. Should a
court find in favor of plaintiffs and Idaho subsequently wishes to assert its
ownership of the property, it may pursue its own remedies. Lee,106 U.S. at 222;
Tindal,167 U.S. at 223.</P>
<P>Fourth, the fact that the state officials may ultimately prevail on the
merits is also irrelevant. A determination of the merits in order to determine
Eleventh Amendment immunity is patently improper. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458
U.S. at 699-700 (Stevens, J.); id. at 703 (White, J.).</P>
<P>Finally, the availability of a state forum does not deprive a federal court
of jurisdiction. Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S.167 (1961); Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S.
241 (1967). To hold otherwise would mean that federal courts would no longer be
the paramount protectors of federal rights. Each individual state legislature
could prevent federal courts from adjudicating such rights by enacting some sort
of remedial scheme.</P>
<P>Thus, because the Eleventh Amendment does not bar the Tribe's claims against
the Idaho state officials, the decision of the Ninth Circuit must be affirmed.</P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="kansas"></A>STATE OF KANSAS v. HENDRICKS</H3>
<P>No. 95-1649  (amicus in support of respondent) </P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>

<P>Initially, the Petitions in this case raised potentially broad and
fundamental issues concerning the scope of a state's constitutional authority to
commit an individual involuntarily to a psychiatric hospital. In its opening
Brief, the State of Kansas has substantially narrowed the issues presented to
this Court.</P>
<P>There no longer appears to be any dispute about two fundamental issues.
First, the State concedes that the Act is a civil, not criminal, statute and
that substantive due process in three specific ways: The individual committed
must be mentally ill; he must be dangerous; and finally, he must receive
treatment. Each of the State's concessions are compelled by this Court's prior
decisions. Second, the State concedes its interest in protecting society could
have been met within its existing laws.</P>
<P>The State could have sentenced Respondent Leroy Hendricks to a total of 45
to 180 years under sentencing laws in existence at the time he was sentenced.
Furthermore, the State could have sought commitment of Mr. Hendricks to a mental
health facility for treatment under applicable laws while he was serving his
prison sentence. If found to be mentally ill, Mr. Hendricks could have received
treatment. The State took neither of these actions.</P>
<P>The remaining disputed issues, while less sweeping and fundamental, are
nevertheless important ones. First, the State expends considerable effort to
suggest the applicability of a rational relationship test rather than a strict
scrutiny test, claiming that involuntary civil commitment does not implicate a
fundamental liberty interest. To the contrary, this Court has long recognized
that indefinite, involuntary civil commitment in a psychiatric hospital
implicates the most basic and essential fundamental liberty interest. Under
substantive due process analysis, this Court has required that involuntary civil
commitment statutes be carefully limited and narrowly tailored to preclude
commitment of those individuals to whom the states' legitimate and compelling
purposes of commitment are inapplicable. Involuntary civil commitment is
designed to treat these individuals who are mentally ill and protect society
from those who are dangerous. Thus, in prior substantive due process cases
involving involuntary civil commitment, the Court has applied a heightened due
process scrutiny standard of review to measure the purposes of commitment.</P>
<P>Second, the State of Kansas in its Brief proposes to replace the Act's
constitutionally defective definition with a new definition of &quot;mental
abnormality.&quot; The State's proposed definition, however, also suffers from a
number of significant defects. In rewriting the statute so that it only reaches
individuals with psychiatric diagnoses, the State ignores the language of the
statute, its legislative history and the authoritative interpretation of the Act
by the State's highest court. The State's newly proposed definition cannot
satisfy the constitutional mental illness requirement that would permit
commitment. Finally, the real purpose in adopting this Act was to extend
incarceration for sex offenders who already have been sentenced, and not to
provide bona, fide treatment for persons who are mentally ill. The structure of
the statute and its legislative history demonstrate that treatment is simply a
pretext for what really is continuing punishment for sex offenders beyond the
time they lawfully may be confined.</P>

<H3><A NAME="lopez"></A>LOPEZ, et al., v. MONTEREY COUNTY, CALIFORNIA et al.</H3>
<P>No. 95-1201 (amicus in support of appellants)</P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>This case involves the appeal of a three judge district court's order that
is totally at odds with Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167;
1973c. Section 5 requires that, with respect to covered jurisdictions, the
Attorney General or the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia preclear any changes affecting voting prior to their implementation.
Id. Amici curiae fully agree with appellants that the three judge district court
(the &quot;district court&quot;) radically subverted Section 5's mandate when it
dissolved an injunction that had prohibited Monterey County, a covered
jurisdiction, from implementing an unprecleared, at-large voting plan for the
election of municipal judges in the County. See Clark v. Roemer, 500 U.S. 64b,
652-54 (1991) (requiring that courts enjoin the implementation of covered,
unprecleared voting changes absent &quot;extreme&quot; circumstances). The
district court's error was compounded by the fact that, prior to its order,
Monterey County had sought to obtain preclearance for the plan from the District
Court of the District of Columbia but abandoned that effort, stipulating that it
was &quot;unable to establish that [the at-large plan]. . . did not have the
effect of denying the right to vote to Latinos in Monterey County due to [its]
retrogressive effect. . . .&quot; (J.A.126) The district court thus sanctioned
the use not only of an unprecleared election plan but one for which Monterey
County had stipulated it could not obtain preclearance.</P>
<P>We understand that appellants will fully address the district court's error
in dissolving its injunction against Monterey County's implementation of the
unprecleared plan and its violation of the standards set forth in Clark v.
Roemer, supra. This brief of amici curiae focuses on another egregious error:
the district court's unwarranted refusal to extend an interim plan, already in
place, that includes two majority-Latino districts and remedies the County's
violation of the Voting Rights Act.</P>
<P>The district court failed to meet its remedial obligation because of its
fundamental misreading of this Court's decision in Miller v. Johnson,115 S. Ct.
2475 (1995). The district court read Miller to constrain a court's authority to
remedy a Section 5 violation by implementing any plan that includes
majority-minority districts, if race was a &quot;significant factor&quot; in the
plan. As a result, the district court departed from well-settled federal law
requiring that court-ordered plans be district-based and abdicated its
obligation to devise an interim plan that would not cause the retrogression of
Latino voting strength. Instead, the district court sanctioned the
implementation of the unprecleared at-large plan that the County acknowledged it
could not show to be non-retrogressive. (Motion to Dismiss or Affirm of
Intervenor Stephen A. Sillman (&quot;Sillman Motion&quot;) App. 4a; see J.A.
I26)</P>
<P>Nothing in Miller justifies this perverse result. Race, of course, will be a
&quot;significant factor&quot; in any plan designed to remedy a violation of
Section 5 and to assure adequate protection of a minority group's voting rights.
Miller held only that a districting plan based &quot;predominantly&quot; on race
was subject to strictly, and even then, that it would be lawful if narrowly
tailored to meet a compelling state interest. Moreover, under Miller, race will
not be deemed the predominant purpose behind a plan absent proof at the plan
disregards traditional redistricting principles. In refusing to extend the
interim plan, the district court did not attempt to make findings on any of
these matters. Indeed, even its conclusion that race was a &quot;significant
factor&quot; in the design of the plan was reached without holding any
evidentiary hearing.</P>
<P>These circumstances require reversal of the district court and make it
imperative that this Court clarify that Miller is not an obstacle to a lower
court's obligation, where it has found a violation of the Voting Rights Act, to
implement a properly drawn, district-based remedial plan that protects minority
voting rights.</P>
<P>Finally, the district court erroneously believed that a federal court was
forbidden from fashioning an appropriate district-based remedial plan if it
involved any departure from state law. This Court should re-affirm its decision
in Conner v. Finch, 431 U.S. 407 (1977), that, while a court should be aware of
and attempt to comply with-state law and policies to the extent possible in
crafting a remedial plan, state law cannot be an absolute barrier to the
effective enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.</P>

<H3><A NAME="mckenna"></A>McKENNA, et al, v. TWIN CITIES AREA NEW PARTY</H3>
<P>No. 95-1608  (amicus in support of respondent)</P>
<P>INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>The body of the Constitution sets forth a sophisticated blueprint for
complex democratic governance. The text is, however, virtually silent about how
to elect the government. The critical task of defining, and preserving, the
right to participate in democratic politics has fallen to the amendment process,
and to this Court.</P>
<P>No fewer than twelve constitutional amendments describe the constitutional
prerequisites for a vigorous, self governing republic of political equals. The
structure of the First Amendment mirrors the life cycle of a democratic idea,
uniting for the first time in a single document the substantive preconditions
for a democratic polity -- freedom of thought, freedom of speech and press,
freedom of assembly and association, and freedom to petition for redress of
grievances. The Fourteenth Amendment assures membership in the democratic
polity, guaranteeing state citizenship and equal protection of the laws to all &quot;persons.&quot;
Indeed, of the seventeen amendments since the adoption of the Bill of Rights,
eleven have dealt with democratic governance. If one excludes the two

Prohibition amendments, since 1791 the only amendments that have not dealt with
implementing democratic ideals have been the Eleventh (reinstating state
sovereign immunity); the Thirteenth (abolishing slavery); the Sixteenth
(authorizing the income tax); and the Twenty-seventh (regulating congressional
compensation). Moreover, the arc of the twelve &quot;democracy&quot; amendments
could not be clearer -- a steady expansion of constitutional protection of the
right to vote, the right to run for office, and the right to associate freely
for the advancement of political ideals.</P>
<P>A similar dynamic underlies the democracy decisions of this Court. After an
uncertain beginning caused, in part by the lack of an explicit provision
protecting democracy in the text of the original Constitution itself, the Court
has recognized that an amalgam of constitutional amendments, anchored in the
First and Fourteenth, provide powerful support for five formidable lines of

precedent that converge in this case to hold Minnesota's absolute ban on fusion
candidacies unconstitutional.</P>
<P>First, the Court has provided effective protection for the right to vote.
Beginning with decisions defending the right to vote against both overt and
sophisticated racial discrimination, the Court has carefully mapped the
substantive contours of the right to cast an equal, and effective, ballot. Most
recently, in Burdick v. Takushi, 505 U.S. 428 (1992), the Court rejected
attempts to analogize voting to a pure act of self-expression. Instead, the
Court insisted on treating voting as a genuine exercise of power, enabling an
individual to register a binding preference for a candidate, and to instruct the
successful candidate about how to carry out the governmental function.
Minnesota's absolute refusal to permit fusion candidacies impinges directly on
the Burdick Court's insistence that voting be equated with a genuine exercise of
political power.</P>
<P>Second, recognizing that organized political parties are integral to the
exercise of political power, the Court has both protected the right to form new
political parties, and has required that a political party wishing to
participate formally in the electoral process demonstrate a minimum modicum of
popular support. Under the Court's precedents, just as the Burdick Court equated
the act of voting with an exercise of power, a political party seeking formal
access to the ballot must do more than merely express an idea; it must
demonstrate a minimal capacity to perform as the vehicle for the exercise of
political power. Minnesota's absolute refusal to permit fusion candidacies
severely restricts the ability of new political parties to develop such a power
base, relegating third parties to marginal vehicles for the expression of
protest.</P>
<P>Third, recognizing that formal political parties are vessels of power, the
Court has sought to protect the integrity and internal stability of political
parties from internal implosion and external subversion. Minnesota's absolute
ban on fusion candidacies goes far beyond the protective devices approved by
this Court, since it applies even when both parties, and the candidate, wish to
mount a fusion candidacy.</P>
<P>Fourth, the Court has understood that a political party, as an organization
dedicated to affecting the allocation of political power, must enjoy substantial
autonomy to carry out a strategic agenda for action. Minnesota's absolute ban on
fusion candidacies places obvious roadblocks to the strategic autonomy of both
major and minor parties. Major parties cannot accept the ballot support of
defined aspects of the electorate needed to enhance the potential for victory.
Third parties cannot forge formal electoral alliances designed to open the road
to power.</P>
<P>Fifth, when the legislature has imposed rules that act to insulate the major
political parties from effective political competition, this Court has attempted
to protect the market in political power from unfair restraints on free
political trade. Minnesota's absolute ban on fusion candidacies is a classic
technique to prevent third parties from evolving into genuine competitors for
power.</P>
<P>Thus, viewed from the perspective of a voter wishing to support a fusion
candidate; a major party wishing to expand its electoral base; a minor party
wishing to forge an electoral alliance; or a candidate wishing to embrace an
additional constituency, an absolute ban on fusion candidacies cannot withstand
constitutional scrutiny.</P>

<P><A HREF="mlb.html">M.L.B. v. S.L.J., et al Brief</A></P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>One of the most fundamental rights that can be adjudicated in a court of law
is the right inherent in a parent's relationship with his or her child. With a
level of care that is appropriate given the stakes involved, Mississippi law
provides not for an unreviewable decision by a single judge in parental
termination cases, but for a two-tiered process of judicial decision-making. The
initial decision is made by a single Chancery Court Judge, elected by the voters
and sitting without a jury, but there is a right of appeal for those parents who
are aggrieved by that decision and who wish it reviewed by an appellate court.
Just as Mississippi could not, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, limit
that appeal to those whose financial income exceeds some specific amount, it
cannot limit it to those who can pay over $2,000 in advance, while denying it to
those who cannot.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the Mississippi Supreme Court has done that in this case.
Whatever the constitutional propriety of that sort of practice in other types of
civil cases, its imposition in this case -- involving the termination of the
fundamental rights encompassed by the relationship between a parent and her
child -- is clearly unconstitutional.</P>
<P>A significant line of precedent from this Court has applied the Fourteenth
Amendment to protect the rights of citizens, no matter their financial
condition, to pursue fundamental legal interests through existing avenues in
state judicial systems. This initially was developed in the context of criminal
appeals, beginning with Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956), which held that
a citizen could not be precluded from an appeal available to others simply
because he or she could not afford to pay for a transcript of the trial. This
line of precedent has since included not only felony cases such as Griffin, but
also misdemeanor appeals such as that in Mayer v. City of Chicago, 404 U.S.193
(1971), which held that a transcript must be provided for an indigent defendant
appealing a conviction punished by a $500 fine with no jail time. The rationale
of these precedents also has been applied by this Court in a civil case, Boddie
v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371 (1971), where fundamental rights were at issue, and
has played a part in this Court's resolution of a civil appeal involving the
interests of impoverished appellants. Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56 (1972). In
a separate line of precedent, this Court has held that fundamental rights are
implicated when a parent's relationship with his or her children is threatened
through a state court parental termination proceeding. Lassiter v. Department of
Social Services, 452 U.S.18, 24 (1981); Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753
(1982).</P>
<P>The existing avenues in Mississippi's judicial system include the right of
appeal in parental termination cases, but a transcript is required if a parent
wishes -- as does the petitioner -- to challenge the termination on evidentiary
grounds. If the petitioner could afford the appeal, including the transcript, it
certainly would be a meaningful appeal. The Mississippi Supreme Court carefully
reviews the findings in termination cases and has reversed a fairly high
percentage of the termination decisions it has reviewed in reported cases.</P>
<P>The present case is a perfect example of the importance of this sort of
review in Mississippi. The complaint did not allege any sort of abuse or
criminal conduct by the petitioner and the evidence was subject to serious
dispute. Yet the Chancery Judge's written opinion did not discuss or cite any of
the evidence and did not give any reasons, other than reciting the statutory
language, for the termination. Just as the appeal of right in Mississippi
represents the best and last hope for wealthier parents whose parental rights
have been terminated, the appeal would be the best and last hope for people like
the petitioner, if only they had access to it.</P>
<P>Given the fundamental nature of parental rights, and given that Mississippi
law authorizes an appeal from decisions of a Chancery Court judge in termination
cases, it violates both the Due Process and the Equal Protection Clauses of the
Fourteenth Amendment to open this appeal only to those who have sufficient
wealth to pay the amounts that were charged here, while closing it to those who
do not.</P>
<P>By requiring over $2000 in advance for the appeal in this case and by
refusing to consider the petitioner's contention that she cannot pay it, the
Mississippi Supreme Court has acted in disregard of these principles.</P>
<P>While the interest of a parent in the relationship with his or her child is
one of the most important that can be adjudicated in a court of law -- certainly
more important than the interest involved in the misdemeanor cases in which this
Court has required that poor people be granted access to existing appeals and
given trial transcripts where necessary -the State's pecuniary interest in
saving money by not permitting these appeals is negligible. The number of
parental termination appeals in Mississippi is rather small, particularly when
compared to the large number of in forma pauperis felony and misdemeanor appeals
in the State. There will be little financial burden on the State if those who
cannot now afford it are allowed to appeal parental terminations along with
those who can. Moreover, a ruling in the petitioners favor by this Court will
not open the floodgates to demands on state treasuries from impecunious
appellants in other types of civil cases. There are few interests arising in
civil litigation more important than the interest implicated in parental
termination cases, and the petitioner can prevail here based on the importance
of that interest without the need for any broad holding that in forma pauperis
appeals are constitutionally required in all civil cases.</P>
<P>Thus, the Mississippi Supreme Court's decision is not supported by an
interest sufficient to ,justify the refusal to consider in forma pauperis
appeals in parental termination cases such as this one.</P>

<H3><A NAME="ohio"></A>STATE OF OHIO v. ROBINETTE</H3>
<P>No. 95-891  (amicus in support of respondent) </P>
<P><A HREF="robinette.html">State of Ohio v. Robinette Brief</A></P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>This Court's cases recognize that &quot;[s]treet encounters between citizens
and police officers are incredibly rich in diversity.&quot; Terry v. Ohio, 392
U.S. 1,13 (1968). Ignoring that diversity, the petitioner argues that this case
should be treated no differently than an encounter between the police and a
citizen walking down the street. Such an encounter is deemed to be an &quot;arm's
length&quot; meeting. Absent some restraining action by the officer, the law
presumes that the citizen is free to answer the officer's questions or walk
away, and that the average person is aware of these options and thus has not
been seized under the Fourth Amendment.</P>
<P>The court below correctly recognized that this constitutional paradigm is
inapposite when the police stop a motorist on the highway. Under these
circumstances, a seizure has unquestionably occurred. Moreover, once a seizure
has occurred (as in respondent's case), the encounter between the police and
citizen is no longer a balanced meeting. The nature of the confrontation not
only may cause &quot;substantial anxiety&quot; for the motorist, Delaware v
Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 657 (1979), the officer's conduct and discretion also
dictate the pace and resolution of the encounter. Unlike the pedestrian free to
ignore an approaching officer, a motorist seized by the police is not positioned
to know the lawful limits of the officer's authority, nor the existence of his
own right to leave or terminate the seizure. Accordingly, the totality test of
the consensual encounter cases is unsuited for judging the legality of an
officer's continued questioning of a motorist subject to police seizure.</P>
<P>This Court's cases also reveal that bright-line rules are appropriate to
delineate the constitutional boundaries of traffic stops. Many of the Court's
affirmative rules in motorist seizure cases expand the power of the police to
advance officer safety or to provide guidance to the officer in the field.</P>
<P>On the other hand, bright-line rules that restrict police authority are
proper when there is the potential for the abuse of police discretion. The court
below correctly announced a clear rule to check the substantial discretion
afforded officers who execute traffic detentions.</P>
<P>The ruling below upholds a fundamental principle of this Court's
investigative detention cases. The investigative practices used by officers
during traffic stops must be strictly tied to the reasons which justify the
detention. Once the purpose for the traffic stop has been satisfied, questioning
a motorist. about matters unrelated to the stop, absent just cause, is
unreasonable. Finally, the decision below will protect the liberty, privacy and
security interests of thousands of innocent motorists who otherwise would be
delayed in their travel plans and asked to surrender the privacy of their
automobiles and luggage without good cause.</P>

<H3><A NAME="reno"></A>RENO, et al, v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BOARD</H3>
<P>Nos. 95-1455 &amp; 95-1508  (amicus in support of appellants)</P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>The appeal of this declaratory judgment action under Section 5 of the Voting
Rights Act presents two separate issues: (1) whether the district court erred in
holding that the Bossier Parish School Board carried its burden of proving a
lack of discriminatory purpose in enacting its redistricting plan, and (2)
whether a violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act provides an
independent basis for denying preclearance under Section 5. Amici agree that, in
this case, it is unnecessary for the Court to reach the second issue, because
the district court majority clearly erred in applying the purpose prong of
Section 5, and its decision must be reversed on that basis. In the event,
however, that the Court reaches the second issue, this amici brief is submitted
to describe the context and legislative history of amended Section 2 which
clearly demonstrate Congress' intent to assure that a voting change violating
Section 2 of the Act would not be required to receive preclearance under Section
5 of the Act. To avoid repetition of the arguments in the principal briefs, the
amici brief is limited to this latter issue, as to which amici have a special
interest based on their involvement as counsel in past Section 5 cases that have
addressed this issue. See Georgia v. Reno, 881 F Supp. 7 (D.D.C. 1995)
(three-judge court); Texas v. United States, 1995 WL 769160 (D.D.C.1995)
(three-judge court).</P>
<P>The legislative history of the 1982 amendments and extension of the Voting
Rights Act show that Congress intended for the results standard of Section 2 to
apply to Section 5 preclearance. Congress was well aware of the limitations of
the retrogression standard of Beer v. United States, 425 U.S. 130 (1976), when
it extended and amended the Act in 1982. The Senate Report that accompanied the
amendments provides that &quot;[i]n light of the amendment to section 2, it is
intended that a section 5 objection also follow if a new voting procedure so
discriminates as to violate section 2.&quot; S. Rep. No. 417, 97th Cong., 2d
Sess. 12 n.31 (1982).</P>
<P>The principal cosponsors of the 1982 amendments, Senator Kennedy and
Representative Sensenbrenner, reiterated on the floors of the Senate and House
during the legislative debates that &quot;where there is a section 5 submission
which is not retrogressive, it would be objected to only if the new practice
itself violated the Constitution or amended section 2.&quot; 128 Cong. Rec.
57095 (daily ed. June 16,1982) (remarks of Sen. Kennedy);128 Cong. Rec. H3841
(daily ed. June 23, 1982) (remarks of Rep. Sensenbrenner). Representative
Edwards, a sponsor of the final bill and chair of the House subcommittee with
jurisdiction over the extension of the Act, concurred with Representative
Sensenbrenner's interpretation of the bill. 128 Cong. Rec. H3840-41.</P>
<P>Congress also acted with knowledge of the Attorney General's then
established practice of denying preclearance to changes which violated other
provisions of the Act. When Congress reenacts a statute and voices its approval
of an administrative or other interpretation of the statute, as it did in the
Senate Report, Congress is treated as having adopted that interpretation, and
the courts are bound by it.</P>
<P>The Senate Report is entitled to greater weight than any other of the
legislative history This Court has described the Senate Report as being &quot;the
authoritative source&quot; for construction of the 1982 amendments to the Act.
Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 IF.S. 30, 43 n.7 (1986). It has been the established
practice of the Court, moreover, to examine the applicable committee reports to
determine congressional intent and the meaning of specific provisions of the
Voting Rights Act, particularly Section 5, where the statute itself was silent
or ambiguous.</P>
<P>While Congress did not amend Section 5, it did amend the Voting Rights Acts
and provided that amended Section 2 was to apply to preclearance. It is common
for Congress to add a provision to an act and apply it to a second provision of
the same act without changing the language of the second provision.</P>
<P>Some voting changes are not amenable to analysis under a retrogression
standard. A change from appointed to elected county commissioners, for example,
would be covered by Section 5, but it might be difficult to determine the effect
of such a change based upon a retrogression analysis. In other cases, there may
be no practice or procedure at all that can be used as a benchmark for
determining retrogression, e.g., where a newly incorporated college district or
municipality selects for the first time a method of conducting elections. Under
the circumstances, a voting plan which fairly reflects the strength of the
minority community as it exists would furnish the logical and appropriate basis
for comparison.</P>
<P>The application of Section 2 to preclearance would not cause a major or
disruptive change in the administration of Section 5. The Attorney General has
administered the statute in such a manner in the past. The purpose or effect
standards would continue to apply and dispose of the vast majority of submitted
voting changes. It would make very little sense from the standpoint of public
policy and conserving judicial resources to allow violations of one section of
the Voting Rights Act (Section 2) to be approved by another (Section 5). Such a
result would undercut the enforcement mechanisms and the overall purpose of the
Act. The evidence shows that Congress intended to correct the anomalies of Beer
by applying Section 2 to Section 5 preclearance.</P>

<H3><A NAME="robinson"></A>ROBINSON v. SHELL OIL COMPANY</H3>
<P>No. 95-1376  (amicus in support of petitioner) </P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>The language of Title VII requires an interpretation that covers retaliation
against former employees. Section 704(a) requires only that an employment
relationship be linked to the retaliatory conduct. The necessary link need not
be that of current employment. Section 701(f) does not exclude former employees,
although it does contain express exclusions as to certain groups.</P>
<P>The denial of benefits earned during covered employment, but taking effect
after the end of such employment, violates the statute, as this Court held in
Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding, 467 U.S. 69 (1984).</P>
<P>The policy of Title VII precludes an interpretation that will render its
anti-retaliation provisions meaningless. The Fourth Circuit's decision leaves
the discriminating employer free to retaliate against any employee who has left
its employment for nondiscriminatory reasons, whether voluntary or involuntary.
The lack of protection against retaliation will cause current employees not to
seek the protections of Title VII, and will cause them to refuse to provide
truthful testimony in support of a Title VII claim, since doing so could result
in, among other things, loss of post-employment benefits and the inability to
obtain a decent job in the future. Leaving former employees without recourse
against retaliation would profoundly frustrate the goals of Title VII.</P>

<P>No. 95-1065 (amicus in support of respondents)</P>
<P><A HREF="schenck.html">Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network Brief</A></P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>There is no dispute in this case about the governing legal standard, which
was announced by this Court only two years ago in Madsen, 114 S.Ct. 2516. It is
also undisputed that the Second Circuit applied the Madsen standard when it
concluded that the challenged provisions of the preliminary injunction &quot;burden
no more speech than necessary to serve a significant government interest,&quot;
id. at 2525.</P>
<P>Petitioners purport to be applying the Madsen standard, as well, in
challenging the preliminary injunction. Ultimately, however, their argument
rests on the untenable proposition that any injunction in this case that goes
beyond a ban on trespass and harassment automatically burdens &quot;more speech
than necessary.&quot; That argument is flawed for at least three reasons.</P>
<P>First, it is inconsistent with Madsen itself, where this Court upheld an
injunction that contained anti-trespass and anti-harassment provisions along
with a 36-foot buffer zone. Second, it ignores extensive findings by the
district court of physical obstruction, intimidation, harassment, crowding,
grabbing, and screaming; of a continuation of these problems even after entry of
the more limited temporary restraining order; and of the inability of the police
to assure access to the clinics without some back-off provisions and a
prophylactic buffer zone. Third, it mischaracterizes the significant state
interest in this case, which is not merely about protecting the property rights
of clinic owners but, even more significantly, about ensuring safe and unimpeded
access to reproductive health services that have a constitutional status of
their own.</P>
<P>To be sure, the Madsen standard is a serious one and ought to be seriously
applied. Any injunction that distances protestors from the object of their
protest raises profound constitutional issues under the First Amendment for all
the reasons that this Court articulated in Madsen. Indeed, the amici
organizations that have joined in this brief are most often on the side of those
challenging such restrictions. But it has never been the law that the First
Amendment guarantees the right to protest in any manner one chooses, or to use
the occasion of a protest to physically harass, intimidate or obstruct one's
ideological opponents. To the contrary, this Court has repeatedly held that the
First Amendment does not immunize unlawful conduct merely because the persons
engaging in that conduct have an ideological motivation. Wisconsin v. Mitchell,
506 U.S., 113 S. Ct. 2194 (1993).</P>
<P>As petitioners correctly point out, even content-neutral injunctions against
speech are disfavored. Petitioners also correctly note that any injunction
impinging on speech, even indirectly, must be narrowly drawn and tailored to the
particular circumstances. However, contrary to petitioners' argument, those
principles cannot resolve this controversy unless they are grounded in the
facts. Assessed in light of the facts, the preliminary injunction in this case
burdens no more speech than necessary to achieve significant government
interests.</P>
<P>It is important to remember that before this case began, plaintiffs were
victimized by a series of mass blockades that severely disrupted reproductive
health services in the area, and that even petitioners concede were clearly
illegal. During the 18 months that the TRO was in place, clinic driveways and
entrances continued to be blocked, and clinic patients and staff continued to be
surrounded, followed, harassed, and obstructed.</P>
<P>Under these circumstances, the 15-foot buffer zone created by the
preliminary injunction was a measured and incremental response to an ongoing
problem that threatened the health, welfare and safety of patients, staff and
demonstrators. Like the buffer zone in Madsen, it was directed at the conduct of
the protestors, not their message. Unlike Madsen, it left the protestors on the
same side of the street as the clinics they were picketing. Thus, even more than
in Madsen, the protestors' chants could still easily be heard and their signs
could still easily be read.</P>
<P>Petitioners' challenge to the cease and desist provision is similarly
misguided. Amici fully acknowledge and have frequently advocated the importance
of face-to-face communication. But the right to engage someone on the street in
a political dialogue does not include the right to crowd, surround, badger, and
obstruct, which is how the distinct court described the behavior of the
defendants in this case.</P>

<H3><A NAME="vacco"></A>VACCO v. QUILL and WASHINGTON v. GLUCKSBERG</H3>
<P>Nos. 95-1858 and 96-110 (amicus in support of respondents)</P>
<P><A HREF="/court/quill.html">Vacco v. Quill <I>amicus</I> brief</A></P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>At issue in this case is no more and no less than (1) whether a mentally
competent, terminally ill person has a liberty interest protected by the
Fourteenth Amendment in choosing to end intolerable suffering by hastening the
timing of an inevitable death, (2) whether a state's interests can justify a
blanket prohibition on physicians providing assistance in the exercise of such a
liberty interest, if it so exists, and (3) whether a state can justifiably grant
certain persons the opportunity to make the choice to hasten death while denying
to other, similarly situated persons the same opportunity.</P>
<P>The right of a competent, terminally ill person to avoid excruciating pain
and embrace a timely and dignified death bears the sanction of history and is
implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. The exercise of this right is as
central to personal autonomy and bodily integrity as rights safeguarded by this
Court's decisions relating to marriage, family relationships, procreation,
contraception, child rearing and the refusal or termination of life-saving
medical treatment. In particular, this Court's recent decisions concerning the
right to refuse medical treatment and the right to abortion instruct that a
mentally competent, terminally ill person has a protected liberty interest in
choosing to end intolerable suffering by bringing about his or her own death.</P>
<P>A state's categorical ban on physician assistance to suicide -- as applied
to competent, terminally ill patients who wish to avoid unendurable pain and
hasten inevitable death -- substantially interferes with this protected liberty
interest and cannot be sustained. Though a state has significant interests in
ensuring that the right at issue here is not abused or misused, an absolute ban
on physician assistance unduly burdens the proper exercise of the right of the
terminally ill to seek freedom from pain through death, especially given the
many less restrictive alternatives which are available to a state and that would
in fact greater serve its claimed interests.</P>
<P>Indeed, states typically and successfully employ less restrictive
alternatives than blanket prohibitions for terminally ill patients depending on
life-sustaining treatment who wish to hasten death. States have recognized the
right of this class of terminally ill patients to escape pain and hasten death
through the termination or refusal of such life support and accompanying
administrations of large and lethal doses of pain-suppressing medication.
Accordingly, a state denies equal protection of its laws when it provides that
one class of persons may exercise this right while others who are similarly
situated for all relevant purposes are wholly denied the opportunity to exercise
the same right for the same reason.</P>

<H3><A NAME="us"></A>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. LANIER </H3>
<P>No. 95-1717  (amicus in support of petitioner) </P>
<P><A HREF="/court/lanier.html">United States v. Lanier <I>amicus</I> brief</A></P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>The majority below erred in holding that deprivations of the constitutional
right to bodily integrity can never be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. 242. Moreover,
its interpretation of the legislative history of 242 was inconsistent with this
Court's decision in Screws. The language of 242 on its face reaches all willful
deprivations of constitutional rights if accomplished under color of law. As
construed in Screws, this means any right &quot;made definite by decision or
other rule of law,&quot; 325 U.S. at 103. By 1989, the right to be free of
coerced sexual assaults by government officers had been made definite through a
series of Supreme Court and appellate decisions establishing the contours of
sexual privacy and bodily integrity under the Fourteenth Amendment.</P>
<P>The substantive liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment has long been understood to encompass bodily integrity and
autonomous decision-making in the private sphere of family life. Central to the
substantive due process concept has been the zone of intimate decision-making
that encompasses choices about reproduction and sexuality. Accordingly, where

the assault is sexual, and particularly where sexual favors are demanded by
officers sufficiently powerful to coerce those under their control into
submission, the right to bodily integrity is violated.</P>
<P>Here, as elsewhere, it is necessary to draw a line between the trivial and
the nontrivial. As Judge Friendly said many years ago and, as this Court has
repeated many times since, &quot;[n]ot every push or shove&quot; violates the
Constitution. Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028,1033 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 414
U.S. 1033 (1973). However, the necessity of line drawing is not unique to this
context -- juries are often asked to decide whether force is excessive or
unreasonable -- and does not, by itself, render a statute unconstitutionally
vague.</P>
<P>Once a defendant's conduct has been shown to be serious and substantial,
however, the right to be free of sexual acts coerced by government officers
should not depend upon whether the officer's conduct &quot;shocks the
conscience.&quot; Under these circumstances, sexual privacy and bodily integrity
are necessarily invaded when a government official makes acquiescence to his
grabbings, gropings, or rapes the price of employment or fair treatment in
court. Thus, in this case the &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; language in the
jury instructions, if anything, imposed an unduly rigorous burden on the
prosecution, and helped the defendant. Although &quot;conscience-shocking,&quot;
standing alone as a legal test, would be troublesome in its vagueness and
subjectivity, in this instance the instructions taken as a whole were both
specific and accurate, informing the jury that the assaults must be &quot;of a
serious and substantial nature&quot; for criminal liability to attach, and
enumerating several objective factors for the jury to consider. Like the
majority below, this brief focuses on the legal issues and does not take any
position on the sufficiency of the evidence.</P>
<P>In addition to violating his victims' sexual privacy and bodily integrity,
the defendant also deprived them of their rights under the Equal Protection
Clause. That is, Lanier's crimes violated both due process and equal protection
guarantees. Although the Justice Department chose to go forward only on a
substantive due process theory, this Court should make clear that a pattern of
coercive and physically abusive, quid pro quo sexual harassment by government
officials violates equal protection rights under both 18 U.S.C. 242, if done
with specific intent, and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.</P>

<P>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a nationwide, nonprofit,
nonpartisan organization with nearly 300,000 members dedicated to the principles
of liberty and equality embodied in the Constitution and this nation's civil
rights laws.  The Arizona Civil Liberties Union is one of its statewide
affiliates.  This case raises issues of special importance to the ACLU because
petitioner has called into question both <I>Maine v. Thiboutot</I>, 448 U.S. 1
(1980), and <I>Ex Parte Young</I>, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), two of the principal
vehicles for civil rights litigation in this country.  We urge the Court to
affirm the decision below, and to reject petitioner's view that state officials
cannot be held accountable in federal court for violating federal law.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="statement"></A><B>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</B></P>
<P>This action for declaratory and injunctive relief was brought on behalf of
custodial parents and their children.  It challenges the failure of Arizona
officials to comply with the mandates of Title IV-D of the Social Security Act,
42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 651-69.  Pursuant to Title IV-D, the federal government
provides Arizona with funding for child support programs.  In return, Arizona is
obligated to provide certain child support services designed, <I>inter alia</I>,
to recover child support payments from delinquent parents.  As described by the
lower court, the federally mandated services include a system  for the &quot;establishment
of paternity, enforcement of support orders, and parent locator services.&quot; 
<I>Freestone v. Cowan</I>, 68 F.3d 1141, 1143 (9th Cir. 1995).</P>
<P>The complaint filed by respondents in this case alleges that Arizona
officials were not in fact providing the services that federal law requires. 

Specifically, the complaint sets forth the individual stories of several mothers

who, despite repeated attempts, could not obtain the mandated Title IV-D
services from Arizona officials.  It also recites statistics to show that the
particular problems identified in the complaint are serious and widespread.</P>
<P>Petitioner moved to dismiss on the grounds that the parents and children who
initiated this suit have no private right of action to enforce the federal
mandates.  The district court agreed with petitioner, treating it as a motion
for summary judgment.  The court of appeals reversed, holding that Congress did
not intend to foreclose private enforcement of Title IV-D.</P>
<P>In this Court, petitioner presses three arguments:  (1) there is no private
right of action under the traditional standards for resolving that issue, most
recently articulated in <I>Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass'n</I>, 496 U.S. 498
(1990), and <I>Suter v. Artist M.</I>, 503 U.S. 347 (1992); (2) this Court
should reverse or sharply limit the holding in <I>Maine v. Thiboutot</I>, 448
U.S. 1, that 42 U.S.C. &#167;1983 provides a private right of action to enforce
federal statutory rights as well as federal constitutional guarantees; and (3)
this Court should reverse or sharply limit the holding in <I>Ex Parte Young</I>,
209 U.S. 123, that the Eleventh Amendment does not prohibit federal courts from
requiring state officials to comply with federal law.</P>
<P><I>Amici</I> agree with respondents that a private right of action exists
to enforce Title IV-D under the standards of <I>Wilder</I> and <I>Suter</I>. 
However, this brief focuses on petitioner's challenge to <I>Maine v. Thiboutot</I>
and <I>Ex Parte Young</I>.  If successful, that challenge would dramatically
alter legal structure established by this Court over the last century to enforce
rights created by federal law.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="summary"></A><B>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</B></P>
<P>Although the word &quot;federalism&quot; does not appear in the
Constitution, there is no doubt that it is crucial to the American
constitutional system.  Federalism refers to the division of powers between the
national and the state governments.  Under our constitutional system, each has
its own sphere of authority and responsibility.  Properly understood, therefore,
federalism is as much about preserving the power and responsibility of the
federal government as it is about preserving the power and responsibility of the
states.</P>
<P>Petitioner emphasizes one aspect of federalism:  safeguarding state
governments from federal encroachments.  The Tenth Amendment's limits on
Congress and the Eleventh Amendment's restrictions on the federal judicial power
reflect this constitutional concern.  See, e.g., <I>Seminole Tribe of Florida
v. Florida</I>, 517 U.S. __, 116 S.Ct. 1114 (1996); <I>New York v. United
States</I>, 505 U.S. 144 (1992).</P>
<P>Petitioner, however, ignores the other aspect of federalism:  protecting the
interests of the national government.  The single most important constitutional

provision concerning federalism is found in Article VI:  &quot;The Constitution,

and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and
all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United
States, shall be the Supreme Law of the Land.&quot;  In short, federalism is
also, in major part, about ensuring the supremacy of federal law.  <I>Sterling
v. Constantin</I>, 287 U.S. 378, 397 (1932); see also <I>U.S. Term Limits, Inc.
v. Thornton</I>, 514 U.S. __,  __, 115 S.Ct. 1842, 1872 (1995)(Kennedy, J.,
concurring)(emphasizing that federalism is about protecting both state
sovereignty and the interests of the national government).</P>
<P>There is no doubt that &#167;1983 was meant to empower the federal courts to
review state and local actions to ensure their compliance with federal law. 
During the debates preceding enactment of ?1983, one Congressman and Senator
after another so declared.  Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess. 321 (1871)(remarks
of Rep. Stoughton); <I>see also id</I>. at 374-76 (remarks of Rep. Lowe); <I>id</I>.
at 459 (remarks of Rep. Coburn); <I>id</I>. at 609 (remarks of Sen. Pool); <I>id</I>.
at 687 (remarks of Sen. Surz); <I>id</I>. at 691 (remarks of Sen. Edmunds). 
Likewise, this Court has often recognized the critical importance of federal
court review in assuring state compliance with the Constitution and laws of the
United States.  <I>See, e.g., Mitchum v. Foster</I>, 407 U.S. 225 (1972).</P>
<P>Contrary to petitioner's argument in this case, <I>Ex Parte Young</I> and
<I>Maine v. Thiboutot</I> are not at war with federalism, they are essential to
its preservation.  It is through suits against state officers pursuant to <I>Ex
Parte Young</I> that state compliance with federal law is achieved.  As the
Court noted in
<I>Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman</I>, 465 U.S. 89, 105
(1984)(<I>Pennhurst II</I>):  &quot;Our decisions repeatedly have emphasized
that the
<I>Young</I> doctrine rests on the need to promote the vindication of federal
rights.&quot;  <I>Id</I>. at 105.  Or, as the Court explained in <I>Green v.
Mansour</I>, 474 U.S. 64, 68 (1986):  &quot;[T]he availability of prospective
relief of the sort awarded in
<I>Ex Parte Young</I> gives life to the supremacy clause.&quot;</P>
<P>Likewise, it is through <I>Maine v. Thiboutot</I> that suits can be
brought, pursuant to &#167;1983, to ensure state and local compliance with
federal statutes.  Thus, after again reviewing the legislative history of &#167;1983
in
<I>Maine v. Thiboutot</I>, the Court concluded that &quot;there can be no doubt
that [&#167;1983] was intended to provide a remedy, to be broadly construed,
against all forms of official violation of federally protected rights.&quot; 
448 U.S. at 5, quoting
<I>Monell v. New York City Dep't of Social Services</I>, 436 U.S. 658, 700-701
(1978).</P>
<P>Petitioner's brief is breathtaking in its willingness to disregard this
Court's well-established jurisprudence and impose new restrictions on federal
court jurisdiction.  For all practical purposes, petitioner seeks to overrule
<I>Ex Parte Young</I> by contending that the Eleventh Amendment bars all suits,
including suits for injunctive and declaratory relief, where it is the state
that is the real party in interest.  Pet.Br. at 25.  In <I>Young</I> itself,
the State of Minnesota was the real party in interest:  the injunction against
Edward Young was to prevent the enforcement of a state statute.  Indeed, in
virtually every case, suits pursuant to <I>Ex Parte Young</I> are brought to
enjoin enforcement of a state law or policy; ultimately, the state is the real
party in interest in all these cases.  In addition, petitioner expressly calls
for this Court to overrule its decision in <I>Maine v. Thiboutot</I>, 448 U.S.
1.  Pet.Br. at 30-48.</P>
<P>The radical changes urged by petitioner would dramatically upset the
allocation of power between the national and state governments by allowing
states to violate federal law with impunity.  Instead of promoting federalism,
the changes urged by petitioner would do exactly the opposite and would abandon
the framers' plan for a national government supreme over the states.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>I.  THE COURT SHOULD REJECT PETITIONER'S INVITATION TO
REVERSE OR SHARPLY LIMIT THE HOLDING OF <I>MAINE v. THIBOUTOT</I></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>A.  <I>Maine v. Thiboutot</I> Was Correctly Decided</B></P>
<P>Petitioner argues that this Court should reverse the holding of <I>Maine v.
Thiboutot</I> and hold instead that &#167;1983 either provides no private right
of action to enforce federal statutory guarantees, or that it provides a private
right of action only to enforce constitutional provisions and statutes that
provide for the enforcement of &quot;equal or civil rights.&quot;  Because
<I>Thiboutot</I> was correctly decided, petitioner's argument should be
rejected.</P>
<P>Section 1983 provides a cause of action for the &quot;. . . deprivation of
any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws . . .&quot;
 In the 1960s, this Court was increasingly presented with suits alleging
violations of &quot;laws&quot; independent of or in addition to constitutional
violations.  By 1979, the Court had decided many such cases, as all Justices
then on the Court acknowledged.  See <I>Thiboutot</I>, 448 U.S. 1, 6, and at
26, 30-33 (Powell, J., dissenting); <I>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights
Organization</I>, 441 U.S. 600, 644-46 (1979)(Powell, J., concurring), 660-63
(White, J., concurring); and 673-74 (Stewart, J., dissenting).</P>
<P>In some cases, the Court simply reached the merits without discussing the
applicability of &#167;1983.  In other cases, the Court supported its holding by
noting that &#167;1983 provided a cause of action for violations of federal
statutes as well as constitutional provisions.  For example, in <I>Greenwood v.
Peacock</I>, 384 U.S. 808, 829-30 (1966), the Court said that state officials
could be held liable under &#167;1983 &quot;not only for violations of rights
conferred by federal equal civil rights laws, but for violations of other
federal constitutional and statutory rights as well.&quot;  In <I>Edelman v.
Jordan</I>, 415 U.S. 651, 675 (1974), then-Justice Rehnquist, writing for the
Court, said that &quot;suits in federal court under &#167;1983 are proper to
secure compliance with the provisions of the Social Security Act,&quot; citing
<I>Rosado v. Wyman</I>, 397 U.S. 397 (1970).  See also <I>Quern v. Jordan</I>,
440 U.S. 332, 337 (1979).  In <I>Owen v. City of Independence</I>, 445 U.S.
622, 649 (1980), the Court said that the question under &#167;1983 was whether
the defendants had conformed to the Constitution &quot;and statutes.&quot;</P>
<P>This view was relatively uncontroversial until 1979, when a debate began
among the Justices of this Court on the scope of the &quot;and laws&quot;
portion of &#167;1983.  Relying primarily on legislative history from the
nineteenth century, three Justices in <I>Chapman</I>, led by Justice Powell,
argued that &quot;and laws&quot; meant &quot;and equal or civil rights laws.&quot;
 441 U.S. at 623.  In response, four Justices argued that the phrase &quot;and
laws&quot; contained no such qualifiers.  Id. at 646, 672.</P>
<P>The debate that surfaced in <I>Chapman</I> was settled in <I>Thiboutot</I>,
only one year later.  By a vote of 6-3, the Court held that the phrase &quot;and
laws&quot; in &#167;1983 meant exactly what it said and was not limited to &quot;equal
or civil rights laws.&quot;  The <I>Thiboutot</I> Court relied upon:  (1) the
plain language of the Act, (2) its prior decisions, and (3) the legislative
history of &#167;1983.  Because in each case the Court's view was correct,
petitioner's challenge to <I>Thiboutot</I> should be rejected.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>1.  Plain Language Of &#167;1983</B></P>
<P>First and foremost, the plain language of &#167;1983 contains no
limitations.  The statute has no modifying phrase that can fairly be read to
limit either the constitutional<SUP>2</SUP> or statutory provisions for which a
cause of action is created.</P>
<P>The phrase &quot;Constitution and laws&quot; was hardly unfamiliar to
Congress.  Its first appearances are in Article III, &#167;2 (&quot;The judicial
Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this
Constitution, the Laws of the United States . . .&quot; ) and the Supremacy
Clause ( &quot;This Constitution and the Laws of the United States, which shall
be made in Pursuance thereof. . . shall be the supreme law of the Land . . . .&quot;),
Article VI, cl. 2.  Alexander Hamilton used the phrase in The Federalist Papers.
 Federalist Nos. 78 and 80 (539 J. Cooke ed. 1961).  In 1801, Congress enacted a
short-lived predecessor to the federal question jurisdictional statute which,
like its current version, used the phrase.  Act of Feb. 13, 1801, &#167;11, 2
Stat. 89, 92; <I>repealed by</I> Act of March 8, 1802, &#167;1, 2 Stat. 132. 
The phrase also appears in <I>McCulloch v. Maryland</I>, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.)
316, 426 (1819), and <I>Cohens v. Virginia</I>, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 391-92
(1821).</P>
<P>Based on this history, it is reasonable to assume that Congress knew what it
was doing when it referred, in &#167;1983, to rights secured by the &quot;Constitution
and laws&quot; of the United States, and that it used those terms in their
ordinary sense. Certainly, that was this Court's conclusion in numerous cases
culminating in <I>Thiboutot</I>, but not limited to it.  Even if the text were
less clear, such a consistent interpretation of the congressional language is
entitled to respect.<SUP>3</SUP></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>2.  Legislative History Of &#167;1983</B></P>
<P>Section 1983 has its origins in &#167;1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, ch.
31, 14 Stat. 27, which provided that African-American citizens would have the &quot;same
right&quot; as white citizens &quot;to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be
parties, and give evidence, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey
real and personal property.&quot;  Section 3 of that Act gave the federal courts
jurisdiction to enforce those rights.</P>
<P>In 1871, Congress expanded the Act by creating a private right of action
that was not limited to the enumerated rights from the 1866 law; instead, it
provided for suit concerning &quot;any rights, privileges, or immunities secured
by the Constitution of the United States.&quot;  17 Stat. 13.<SUP>4</SUP>  In
1874, Congress changed the language again to its current version, which now
protects &quot;any rights . . . secured by the Constitution and laws . . .&quot;
 Rev.Stat. &#167;1979.<SUP>5</SUP></P>
<P>Congress also created two jurisdictional statutes in 1874.  The district
court jurisdictional statute, Rev.Stat. &#167;563(13), was consistent with &#167;1983
and provided jurisdiction for violations of laws as well as the Constitution. 
The circuit court jurisdictional statute provided jurisdiction only for &quot;any
law providing for equal rights.&quot;  Rev.Stat. &#167;629 (16).<SUP>6</SUP> 
In 1911, Congress merged the two jurisdictional statutes into the present &#167;1343(3),
providing jurisdiction for any &quot;Act of Congress providing for equal rights
. . .&quot;  Judicial Code of 1911, ch. 231, &#167;24, 36 Stat. 1087, 1091.</P>
<P>Petitioner's argument that the phrase &quot;and laws&quot; in &#167;1983
should be limited to &quot;laws providing for equal rights&quot; rests on two
basic premises, both of which were also advocated by Justice Powell in <I>Chapman</I>
but rejected by the full Court in <I>Thiboutot</I>.  First, petitioner argues
that the revision of the statutes in 1874 was supposed to be technical, not
substantive. 
<I>Chapman</I>, 441 U.S. at 625; <I>Thiboutot</I>, 448 U.S. at 16-18.  Second,
petitioner contends that &#167;1983, and its two jurisdictional counterparts,
Rev.Stat. &#167;563(13)(district court jurisdiction without limitation) and &#167;629(16)(circuit
court jurisdiction limited to &quot;equal rights&quot;),<SUP>7</SUP> should be
interpreted to have the same meaning despite their different language. 
Furthermore, petitioner argues that the meaning that should be ascribed to all
three statutes is the limited one of &#167;629(16) rather than the more
expansive one found in the other two statutes and the corresponding criminal
statutes.  See also <I>Chapman</I>, 441 U.S. at 635 (Powell, J.).  Both
premises of petitioner's argument are flawed.</P>
<P>Specifically, there is ample evidence in the legislative history that
Congress recognized it was expanding &#167;1983 when it added the phrase &quot;and
laws&quot; in 1874.  <I>Chapman</I>, 441 U.S. at 664, n.40 (White, J.
concurring).  Representative Lawrence's comment that &#167;1983 would be applied
more broadly than its predecessor in a &quot;few cases,&quot; id., both supports
the notion that the language change was intentional and reflects the fact that,
in 1874, there were only a &quot;few&quot; statutory rights that could be
protected by &#167;1983.  See Rev. Stats. &#167;&#167;2259, 2289, 2319, 2320,
3194, 3199.  In addition, Congress rejected a proposal offered by Representative
Willard which would have required that any provision of the Revised Statutes be
interpreted identically to earlier, differently worded provisions.  2 Cong.Rec.
648 (1874); <I>see also Hamilton v. Rathbone</I>, 175 U.S. 414 (1899); <I>Vietor
v. Arthur</I>, 104 U.S. 498, 500 (1881); <I>McDonald v. Hovey</I>, 110 U.S.
619, 629 (1883); <I>Deffeback v. Hawke</I>, 115 U.S. 392, 402 (1885); Endlich,
A Commentary on the Interpretation of Statutes 65 (1888).<SUP>8</SUP></P>
<P>Whether one characterizes the 1874 change as &quot;technical&quot; or not,
the language of &#167;1983 is clear and unambiguous, especially when compared to
the narrower language used by Congress when it defined the jurisdiction of the
circuit courts. Significantly, moreover, the first draft of &#167;1983 contained
the narrower language of the 1871 Act; it was changed for the final draft. 
Title LXXIII, Chap. VII, &#167;190 (Draft of 1872).  Under analogous
circumstances, this Court has repeatedly held that the Revised Statutes of 1874
must be seen as having changed the law where the plain language so dictates. 
<I>See United States v. Bowen</I>, 100 U.S. 508, 513 (1880)(&quot;when the
meaning is plain, the courts cannot look to the statutes which have been revised
to see if Congress erred in that revision . . .&quot;); <I>Hamilton v. Rathbone</I>,
175 U.S. at 419-21 (&quot;prior acts may be resorted to, to solve, but not to
create an ambiguity&quot;)(emphasis in original); <I>Continental Casualty Co.
v. United States</I>, 314 U.S. 527, 530 (1942).</P>
<P>In addition, after 1874, Congress recognized that it had inadvertently made
some 253 substantive errors.  Those were corrected in 1877 and again in 1878. 
18 Stat. 1433-36; 19 Stat. 240 (1877).  Section 1983 was not among those
corrected, though other provisions of both of the jurisdictional statutes were
modified.  <I>See</I> R. Dwan and E. Feidler, &quot;The Federal Statutes: 
Their History and Use,&quot; 22 Minn.L. Rev. 1008, 1014 (1938); M. Price and H.
Bitner, Effective Legal Research 29 (3d ed. 1969); Comment, &quot;Section 1983
and the Private Enforcement of Federal Statutes:  A New Frontier for the Civil
War Legislation,&quot; 18 Willamette L.Rev. 433 (1982).</P>
<P>Petitioner's second premise -- that &#167;1983 and &#167;1343 must be read
identically -- is equally flawed.  There is simply no reason to suggest that &#167;&#167;1983
and 1343(3) need be read identically.  <I>See generally Chapman</I>, 441 U.S.
at 660-63 (White, J., concurring).  It is entirely logical, as this Court
ultimately held, to assume that Congress chose to limit the availability of &#167;1343
to actions seeking to enforce equal rights laws while providing jurisdiction
over other statutory &#167;1983 actions only where the requisite amount in
controversy under &#167;1331 was met.  Such a choice presumably would have been
based either on the theory that suits claiming infringements of the equal rights
guarantees are less amenable to pecuniary valuation than other actions, see <I>Hague
v. CIO</I>, 307 U.S. 496, 529 (1939), or on the theory that suits claiming such
violations should be heard regardless of the amount in controversy.<SUP>9</SUP></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>3.  Petitioner's Proposed Alternatives To <I>Thiboutot</I></B></P>
<P>Petitioner suggests two &quot;interpretations&quot; of &#167;1983 to replace
the holding in <I>Thiboutot</I>.  First, she suggests that &#167;1983 should be
read to create a private right of action only where another statute creates a
private right of action.  Pet. Br. at III.A.  This would, of course, make &#167;1983
entirely superfluous.<SUP>10</SUP>  Undeterred, petitioner argues that making &#167;1983
superfluous would be a harmless act because an implied private right of action
exists to enforce constitutional rights,<SUP>11</SUP> and because other
statutes would create private rights of action where Congress intended they
exist.  Whether this Court would be causing harm or not by essentially repealing
&#167;1983 is irrelevant.  As petitioner admits, the key question is

congressional intent and it is elemental that this Court should not lightly
presume that Congress intended to pass totally meaningless statutes. Indeed, in
light of the history of &#167;1983, for this Court to find that Congress did not
intend it to have any meaning would be a most remarkable holding.</P>
<P>Second, petitioner suggests that &#167;1983 be limited to creating a private
cause of action to enforce &quot;equal or civil rights.&quot;  Pet.Br. at III.B.
 Primarily for the reasons stated above, this argument is unpersuasive.  Any
lingering doubt was removed when this Court recently reaffirmed its holding in
<I>Thiboutot</I> rejecting that argument.  Specifically, in <I>Dennis v.
Higgins</I>, 498 U.S. 439 (1991), the Court stated that &quot;[a] broad
construction of &#167;1983 is compelled by the statutory language, which speaks
of deprivations of `any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the
Constitution and laws.'  Accordingly, we have `repeatedly held that coverage of
[&#167; 1983] must be broadly construed.'&quot;  Id. at 443.  <I>Dennis</I>
further noted:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>the Court has never restricted the section's scope to the effectuation of
[equal rights].  Rather we have given effect to its broad language, recognizing
that &#167;1983 &quot;provides a remedy to be broadly construed, against all
forms of official violation of federally  protected rights.  <I>Monell v. New
York City Dept. of Social Services</I>, 436 U.S. 658, 700-701 (1978).  Thus we
have refused to limit the phrase 'and laws' in &#167;1983 to civil rights or
equal protection laws.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 445; <I>Livadas v. Bradshaw</I>, 512 U.S.  __, __, 114 S.Ct. 2068,
2083 (1994).  To accept petitioner's argument would be to reject the statements
in Dennis.  Alternatively, it would require that the Court hold that there was
an implied limitation on the &quot;and laws&quot; portion of &#167;1983 that did
not exist in the &quot;Constitution&quot; portion.</P>
<P>Petitioner suggests one other rationale for adopting this interpretation.<SUP>12</SUP>
 It would, she argues, &quot;bring[] &#167;1983 into harmony with the Court's
most recent interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment.&quot;  Pet.Br. at 43.  Of
course, &#167;1983 does not abrogate the Eleventh Amendment.  <I>Quern v.
Jordan</I>, 440 U.S. at 341.  Thus, restricting &#167;1983 is not necessary to
protect the values of the Eleventh Amendment.  Instead, this argument is really
a thinly disguised second attempt to limit or reverse <I>Ex Parte Young</I>
and, for the reasons stated in Point II of this brief, should be rejected.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>B.  The Standards Required For Violating The Principles
Of <I>Stare Decisis</I> Have Not Been Met</B></P>
<P>&quot;The Court has said often and with great emphasis that `the doctrine of
stare decisis is of fundamental importance to the rule of law.'&quot;  <I>Patterson
v. McLean Credit Union</I>, 491 U.S. 164, 172 (1989), quoting <I>Welch v. Texas
Dep't of Highways and Public Transportation</I>, 483 U.S. 468, 494 (1987).  It
has also said that &quot;any departure from the doctrine of stare decisis
demands special justification.&quot;  <I>Arizona v. Rumsey</I>, 467 U.S. 203,
212 (1984).  <I>See Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida</I>, 116 S. Ct. 1114 (&quot;`the
evenhanded predictable, and consistent development of legal principles . . .
reliance on judicial decisions, and . . . the actual and perceived integrity of
the judicial process' counsel strongly against reconsideration of our precedent.&quot;
<I>See also Planned Parenthood v. Casey</I>, 505 U.S. 833, 867 (1992).</P>
<P>In asking this Court to overrule <I>Maine v. Thiboutot</I>, petitioner is
asking this Court to overrule a question of statutory interpretation.  As this
Court has frequently observed, however, &quot;[c]onsiderations of stare decisis
have special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in
the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative power is
implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have done.&quot;  <I>Patterson</I>,
491 U.S. at 172-73.  <I>See also Seminole Tribe</I>, 116 S.Ct. at 1127. 
Congressional intent is, therefore, key.</P>
<P>Even prior to the <I>Thiboutot</I> decision, Congress had unmistakably
expressed its view that &#167;1983 provided a broad right to enforce federal
statutes.  During the passage of 42 U.S.C. &#167;1988, Congress repeatedly noted
its approval of the view that &#167;1983 provided for a private right of action
to enforce statutes as well as constitutional rights.  For example, the Senate
report indicated that the bill would result in the award of fees for &quot;redressing
violations of the Federal Constitution or laws by officials . . .&quot; 
S.Rep.No. 94-1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 4, <I>reprinted in</I> 5 U.S. Code
Cong. and Admin. News 5908, 5911 (1976)(emphasis added).  Sponsors of the bill
agreed.  &quot;Under applicable judicial decisions, Section 1983 authorizes
suits against State and local officials based on Federal <I>statutory as well
as</I> constitutional rights.&quot;  122 Cong.Rec. 35122 (1976)(Rep.
Drinan)(emphasis added).  &quot;This legislation is intended to cover cases
based on both constitutional and
<I>statutory</I> rights . . .&quot;  122 Cong.Rec. 33315 (1976)(Sen.
Abourezk)(emphasis added); 122 Cong. Rec. 33314 (1976)(Sen. Kennedy).  And,
during the debate over &#167;1983, congressional supporters approvingly cited
cases based on non-equal rights statutes, such as the Social Security Act, as
well as statutes providing for equal or civil rights.  Id.; <I>Thiboutot</I>,
448 U.S. at 9-10; Note, &quot;The Application of Section 1983 to the Violation
of Federal Statutory Rights:  <I>Maine v. Thiboutot</I>,&quot; 30 De Paul
L.Rev. 651 (1981).</P>
<P>Since <I>Thiboutot</I>, Congress has reaffirmed its intent that &#167;1983
be interpreted to permit a private right of action to enforce federal statutes
in several ways.  First, Congress rejected bills introduced in 1981, 1985, and
1987, that would have limited &#167;1983 precisely as urged by petitioner.<SUP>13</SUP>
 Indeed, in <I>Thiboutot</I>, this Court invited Congress to change the law if
it thought the Court's interpretation of congressional intent in error.  448
U.S. at 8.  Congress' express refusal to do so is surely some indication of
Congress' agreement with the interpretation in <I>Thiboutot</I>.</P>
<P>Second, in 42 U.S.C. &#167;1320a-2, passed in response to the decision in
<I>Suter v. Artist M.</I>, 503 U.S. 347, Congress indicated its view that a
private right of action did and should exist in Social Security Act cases.  In
that statute, Congress sought to reestablish private right of action law as it
existed prior to <I>Suter</I>, law that included the holding in Thiboutot. 
Whatever the precise meaning of the post-Suter statute,<SUP>14</SUP> it
represents a clear re-endorsement of <I>Thiboutot</I>.  Thus, far from viewing
<I>Thiboutot</I> as error, Congress has indicated agreement with its holding.</P>
<P>Another principal factor relevant to stare decisis is whether the decision
has proved unworkable or, in the alternative, has been relied upon.<SUP>15</SUP>
 Not only has <I>Thiboutot</I> not proven unworkable, but a decision reversing
it would cast doubt on dozens of this Court's own cases,<SUP>16</SUP> and
hundreds of lower court cases, a situation that would create massive (and
unnecessary) chaos.</P>
<P>In short, petitioner's attack on <I>Maine v. Thiboutot</I> would promote
instability in the law.  The doctrine of <I>stare decisis</I> is designed to
have precisely the opposite effect.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>II.  THE COURT SHOULD REJECT PETITIONER'S INVITATION TO
REVERSE OR SHARPLY LIMIT THE HOLDING OF <I>EX PARTE YOUNG</I></B></P>
<P>Because this suit alleges that petitioner is violating federal law in her
capacity as Director of the Arizona Department of Economic Security, she is
stripped of any Eleventh Amendment immunity under <I>Ex Parte Young</I>, 209
U.S. 123, and the federal courts have jurisdiction to provide declaratory and
injunctive relief.</P>
<P><I>Edelman v. Jordan</I>, 415 U.S. 651, is directly on point.  <I>Edelman</I>
was a class action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the
Director of the Illinois Department of Public Aid for allegedly violating
federal mandates that applied to the program of Aid to the Aged, Blind, and
Disabled.  In other words, like this case, <I>Edelman</I> involved a class
action suit against the state official responsible for complying with federal
standards in a federally funded program.  This Court, in an opinion by
then-Justice Rehnquist, carefully distinguished between retroactive relief that
would run against the state treasury and thus was barred by the Eleventh
Amendment, and prospective relief against the state official that had been
allowed pursuant to <I>Ex Parte Young</I>.  The Court declared:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Ex parte Young</I> was a watershed case in which this Court held that
the Eleventh Amendment did not bar an action in the federal courts seeking to

enjoin the Attorney General of Minnesota from enforcing a statute claimed to
violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  This
holding has permitted the Civil War Amendments to the Constitution to serve as a
sword, rather than merely as a shield, for those whom they were designed to
protect.  But the relief awarded in <I>Ex parte Young</I> was prospective only;
the Attorney General was required to conform his future conduct of that office
to the requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>415 U.S. at 664.</P>
<P>As in <I>Edelman</I>, respondents here are seeking only prospective relief
to ensure that the Director of the Arizona Department of Economic Security
conforms the future conduct of her office to the requirements of federal law. 
<I>Edelman</I> expressly held that suits for such prospective relief are not
barred by the Eleventh Amendment, even if compliance with the federal court
order would impose costs on the state.</P>
<P>Petitioner offers two reasons why the Eleventh Amendment bars this suit: 
the injunctive relief would run against the state as the real party in interest,
and the case fits within the exception to <I>Ex Parte Young</I> recognized in
<I>Seminole Tribe v. Florida</I>, 116 S.Ct. 1114.  As discussed below, neither
of these claims has merit.  Indeed, if either were followed, the ability to

ensure state compliance with federal law would be greatly diminished, if not
eviscerated, thus undermining one of the basic principle of federalism.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>A.  Injunctive And Declaratory Relief Against State
Officers Is Not Barred, Even If The State Government Is The &quot;Real Party In
Interest&quot;</B></P>
<P>Petitioner claims that &quot;the Eleventh Amendment bars a suit against

State officers when the `state is the real, substantial party in interest' and
the officer is being sued merely as a representative of the State.&quot; 
Pet.Br. at 25.  Petitioner cites <I>Ford Motor Co. v. Dep't of Treasury of
Indiana</I>, 323 U.S. 459, 463-64 (1945), as authority for this proposition. 
<I>Ford Motor Co.</I>, however, involved a claim for money damages, not
injunctive or declaratory relief.  <I>Ford Motor Co.</I> was a federal court
suit brought by a taxpayer for a refund of state taxes that had been paid under
protest.  <I>Ford Motor Co.</I> held only that suits for retroactive money
damages against state officers are barred when the state is the real party in
interest and the state treasury will be paying the sum.  The Court said:  &quot;[W]hen
the action is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state, the state
is the real, substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its
sovereign immunity from suit even though individual officials are nominal
defendants.&quot;  <I>Id</I>. at 464.  The case did not involve a claim for
prospective injunctive or declaratory relief.</P>
<P>In fact, no Supreme Court case ever has held that injunctive or declaratory
relief against state officers is barred because the state is the real party in
interest.  Quite the contrary, this Court frequently has recognized that suits
against officers are allowed precisely so that there is a mechanism to ensure
state compliance with federal law.  In <I>Perez v. Ledesma</I>, 401 U.S. 82
(1971), this Court explained:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Ex parte Young</I> was the culmination of efforts by this Court to
harmonize the principles of the Eleventh Amendment with the effective supremacy
of rights and powers secured elsewhere in the Constitution . . . . [The
enactment of &#167;1983 and &#167;1331, creating general federal question
jurisdiction], together, after 1908, with the decision in <I>Ex parte Young</I>,
established the modern framework for federal protection of constitutional rights
from state interference.  That framework has been strengthened and expanded by
subsequent acts of Congress and subsequent decisions of this Court.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Id</I>. at 106-07 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part).</P>
<P>Suits pursuant to <I>Ex Parte Young</I> clearly are not barred, as
petitioner contends, because the injunctive or declaratory relief is ultimately
directed against the state government.  In <I>Ex Parte Young</I> itself, the
suit was brought against the Attorney General of Minnesota to enjoin the
enforcement of an allegedly unconstitutional state law.  The State, of course,
was the &quot;real party in interest.&quot;  This Court has expressly recognized
that reality, but nonetheless concluded that such prospective relief is
essential to ensure the supremacy of federal law.  For example, in <I>Pennhurst
II</I>, this Court said that &quot;the injunction in <I>Young</I> was
justified, <I>notwithstanding the obvious impact on the State itself . . . .</I>&quot;
465 U.S. at 104 (emphasis added).  As the Court observed, &quot;the <I>Young</I>
doctrine has been accepted as necessary to vindicate federal rights and hold
state officials responsible to `the supreme authority of the United States,'&quot;
<I>id</I>. at 105, quoting <I>Ex Parte Young</I>, 209 U.S. at 160.</P>
<P>Indeed, every time a state officer is sued pursuant to <I>Ex Parte Young</I>
to enjoin the enforcement of an unconstitutional state law or regulation, the
state is the real party in interest.  Petitioner's position would bar all such
suits and thus effectively overrule <I>Ex Parte Young</I>.  There would be no
way to bring suit in federal court to ensure state compliance with federal law
and to uphold the supremacy of the federal government over the states.  The
state itself, of course, could not be sued in federal court because of the
Eleventh Amendment.  Petitioner's position also would bar suits against the
officers.  The doors of the federal courts would be closed, except for the
relatively remote chance of Supreme Court review of a state court decision.</P>
<P>This Court often has rejected exactly that possibility and has emphasized
the importance of federal courts being available to hear suits against state
officers to ensure compliance with federal law.  The Court has said that &quot;the
doctrine of <I>Ex Parte Young</I> seems indispensable to the establishment of

constitutional government and the rule of law.&quot;  <I>Perez v. Ledesma</I>,
401 U.S. at 110 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part),
quoting C. Wright, Handbook of the Law of Federal Courts 186 (2d ed. 1970). 
Likewise, Justice Souter recently explained:  &quot;<I>Young</I> provided, as
it does today, a sensible way to reconcile the Court's expansive view of
immunity expressed in
<I>Hans</I> with the principles embodied in the Supremacy Clause and Article
III . . . . [T]he rule we speak of under the name of <I>Young</I> is so far
inherent in the jurisdictional limitation imposed by sovereign immunity as to
have been recognized since the Middle Ages.&quot;  <I>Seminole Tribe v. Florida</I>,
116 S.Ct. at 1178-79 (Souter, J., dissenting).</P>
<P>Justice Souter explained the crucial significance of suits pursuant to <I>Ex
Parte Young</I> in upholding the supremacy of federal law when he stated:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The decision in <I>Ex parte Young</I>, and the historic doctrine it
embodies, thus plays a foundational role in American constitutionalism, and
while the doctrine is sometimes called a &quot;fiction,&quot; the long history
of its felt necessity shows it to be something much more estimable . . . . A
rule of such lineage, engendered by such necessity, should not be easily
displaced, if indeed it is displaceable at all, for it marks the frontier of the
enforceability of federal law against sometimes competing state policies.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Seminole Tribe</I>, 116 S.Ct. at 1180.</P>
<P>Petitioner's position would completely displace <I>Ex Parte Young</I>.  No
mechanism would exist for federal courts to review state laws, no matter how
egregious they are in violating federal law and even the Constitution.  By
petitioner's theory, all federal court review of the constitutionality of state
laws, even when accomplished pursuant to <I>Ex Parte Young</I>, is barred
because the state is the real party in interest.  Petitioner simply fails to
recognize that ensuring the supremacy of federal law is an essential aspect of
federalism and that gutting <I>Ex Parte Young</I> in the manner that petitioner
advocates would undermine a cornerstone of American government.<SUP>17</SUP></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>B.  Seminole Tribe v. Florida Creates A Narrow Exception
To <I>Ex Parte Young</I></B></P>
<P>Petitioner offers an alternative argument as to why this case is barred by
the Eleventh Amendment:  &quot;[t]he principles in <I>Seminole Tribe</I> bar a &#167;1983
action in this case.&quot;  Pet. Br. at 26.  In <I>Seminole Tribe</I>, this
Court declared that &quot;[w]here Congress has prescribed a detailed remedial
scheme for the enforcement against a State of a statutorily created right, a
Court should hesitate before casting aside those limitations and permitting an
action against a state officer based upon <I>Ex parte Young</I>.&quot;  116
S.Ct. at 1132.</P>
<P>At the outset, it should be noted that <I>Seminole Tribe</I> is clearly
distinguishable from this case.  <I>Seminole Tribe</I> did not involve, as does
this action, a suit brought pursuant to &#167;1983.  Rather, the suit in <I>Seminole
Tribe</I> was brought under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which expressly
allowed suits against states to be brought in federal court.  This, of course,
was the provision declared unconstitutional in the first part of the majority's
opinion in <I>Seminole Tribe</I>.  Thus, <I>Seminole Tribe</I> did not present
the situation posed in this case:  a suit under the express language of &#167;1983
authorizing suits against state officers to halt violations of &quot;laws&quot;
of the United States.  Indeed, this is evidenced by the fact that the Court
nowhere mentions &#167;1983 or its availability to enforce federal statutes, but
instead cites <I>Schweiker v. Chilicky</I>, 487 U.S. 412, which concerns suits
brought directly under the Constitution.</P>
<P>Even prior to <I>Seminole Tribe</I>, this Court had recognized that &#167;1983
suits to enforce a federal statute are precluded when there are &quot;comprehensive
enforcement mechanisms&quot; in the law demonstrating &quot;congressional intent
to preclude the remedy of suits under &#167;1983.&quot;  <I>Middlesex County
Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Ass'n</I>, 453 U.S. at 20.  A fair
reading of <I>Seminole Tribe</I>, therefore, is that the limitation on &#167;1983
suits announced in <I>Middlesex County</I> now also applies to suits against
state officers brought pursuant to other federal statutes.</P>
<P>Not surprisingly, this is exactly how lower federal courts have interpreted
the exception to <I>Ex Parte Young</I> discussed in <I>Seminole Tribe</I>. 
The Seventh Circuit, for example, cited <I>Seminole Tribe</I> and <I>Middlesex
County</I> as establishing the same proposition, that &quot;[w]hen Congress
crafts particular remedies for particular wrongs, the presumption is that these
are the exclusive remedies and that such limitations as they embody are not to
be generally circumvented by extending a more generally worded statute over the

subject of the more specific one.&quot;  <I>McDonnell v. Cisneros</I>, 84 F.3d
256, 261 (7th Cir. 1996)</P>
<P>This interpretation of <I>Seminole Tribe</I> is consistent, as well, with
other efforts by this Court to reconcile the Eleventh Amendment and &#167;1983. 
For example, in <I>Will v. Michigan Department of State Police</I>, 491 U.S. 58
(1989), the Court held that state governments are not persons and may not sued
under &#167;1983 in state courts.  Although the Eleventh Amendment has no
application in state court litigation, the Court interpreted &#167;1983 to be in
accord with the principles of the Eleventh Amendment.</P>
<P>Similarly, the holding of <I>Seminole Tribe</I> that <I>Ex Parte Young</I>
does not permit suits against state officers under a federal law that embodies a
comprehensive enforcement mechanism, is best understood as an effort to bring
Eleventh Amendment law into line with the &#167;1983 rule announced in <I>Middlesex
County</I>.  That holding, however, does not doom this suit.  To the contrary,
it is perfectly clear under <I>Middlesex County</I> that the suit against
petitioner would be permissible.  In <I>Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and
Housing Authority</I>, 479 U.S. 418, this Court held that a comprehensive
enforcement mechanism should be deemed to exist only if there is an &quot;express
provision or other specific evidence from the statute itself that Congress
intended to foreclose&quot; litigation. 
<I>Id</I>. at 423.  <I>Wright</I> further ruled that administrative remedies

alone do not preclude &#167;1983 litigation absent a more specific congressional

intent to prohibit &#167;1983 suits.  Here, the only mechanisms to enforce Title

IV-D are administrative and there is no specific congressional intent to bar &#167;1983
litigation.</P>
<P>Thus, <I>Seminole Tribe</I> did no more than to extend the <I>Middlesex
County</I> exception from &#167;1983 suits to suits against state officers
brought under other statutory provisions.  In other words, when state officers
are sued pursuant to <I>Ex Parte Young</I>, the <I>Middlesex County</I>
exception means that such suits are barred if there is a comprehensive
enforcement mechanism as defined in
<I>Middlesex County</I> and <I>Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing
Authority</I>.  Because there is no comprehensive scheme in this case, <I>Ex
Parte Young</I> remains the only avenue available to respondents to secure
compliance with federal law.  Nothing in <I>Seminole Tribe</I> supports
petitioner's claim that this sole avenue should now be closed.  The Court should
emphatically reject petitioner's invitation to turn civil rights enforcement
back one hundred years.</P>

<P>1. Letters of consent to the filing of this brief have been lodged with the
Clerk of the Court pursuant to Rule 37.3.</P>
<P>2. It is not clear whether petitioner would have the Court also limit the
constitutional rights that can be enforced pursuant to &#167;1983 and thereby
reverse <I>Monroe v. Pape</I>, 365 U.S. 167 (1961), and <I>United States v.
Classic</I>, 313 U.S. 299 (1941). At one point, petitioner appears to suggest
precisely that, thus further reinforcing the truly radical scope of petitioner's
argument.  Pet.Br. at 36 n.19.</P>
<P>3. &quot;[O]ur acceptance of the plain terms of [&#167;1983] and analogous
criminal proscriptions has been consistent, and for over a century Congress has
not acted to rectify any purported error in our construction of these
provisions.&quot;  <I>Chapman</I>, 441 U.S. at 658-59 (White, J. concurring).</P>
<P>4. Section 16 of the 1870 Act, governing criminal penalties, expanded
previous law and made it a crime to conspire to deny any right secured by the
Constitution &quot;or laws.&quot;  Ch. 114, 16 Stat. 140; <I>Chapman</I>, 441
U.S. at 651 (White, J., concurring).  <I>See also United States v. Price</I>,
383 U.S. 787 (1966); <I>United States v. Classic</I>, 313 U.S. 299.  That
language, in what is now 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;241, 242, has been interpreted
consistently with the identical language in &#167;1983.  Petitioner does not
indicate if she believes a modifier should also be implied in &#167;&#167;241
and 242, thus overruling
<I>Price</I>, <I>Classic</I>, and similar cases, as well as <I>Thiboutot</I>.
 See <I>Chapman</I>, 441 U.S. at 662-63 (White, J. concurring).</P>
<P>5. Because they are identical for purposes of this case, Rev.Stat. &#167;1979
will be referred to by its present designation, &#167;1983.</P>
<P>6. The criminal statutes continued to prohibit violations of rights under
the &quot;Constitution or laws.&quot;  <I>Chapman</I>, 441 U.S. at 661 (White,
J. concurring).</P>
<P>7. Hereinafter, &#167;&#167;563(13) and 629(16), unless explicitly so cited,
will be referred to by the section given them after merger, &#167;1343.</P>
<P>8. The 1874 Revisions explicitly repealed all prior statutes.  Rev.Stat. &#167;5596;
2 Cong.Rec. 2713 (1874).  <I>See also</I> 7 Cong.Rec. 1137 (1878)(in
interpreting the Revised Statutes of 1874, &quot;the courts cannot look back to
the original and be governed by that, because the original act has been repealed
. . .&quot;)(Sen. Christiancy).  When a later significant revision of federal
law was proposed, Congress adopted the opposite approach and refused to &quot;have
it absolutely replace all the laws of the United States as was done by the
Revised Statutes in 1874.&quot;  67 Cong.Rec. 12074 (1926)(Rep. Fitzgerald).</P>
<P>9. Since the 1908 elimination of a jurisdictional amount requirement in
federal question cases, this debate is irrelevant.  28 U.S.C. &#167;1331.  See
Pub.L.No. 96-486, &#167;2(a), 94 Stat. 2369 (1980).</P>
<P>10. She also suggests the need to adhere to the plain statement rule.  Pet.
Br. at III.A.  Of course, in <I>Thiboutot</I>, this Court held that &#167;1983
is a plain statement of Congress' intent.</P>
<P>11. In support, petitioner cites <I>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of
Federal Bureau of Narcotics</I>, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), a case establishing a
private right of action to sue federal officials, not state officials, for
violation of constitutional rights. This Court has never explicitly held that an
implied right of action exists to sue state officials for violation of
constitutional rights.  It has never had to -- &#167;1983 provides that cause of
action.  It is only by seeking to render &#167;1983 meaningless that petitioner
must ask this Court to reach the issue of an implied cause of action.</P>
<P>12. Petitioner also emphasizes that &#167;1983 does not create a cause of
action unless there is a &quot;right . . . secured.&quot;  She argues that this
somehow requires the plain statement of a cause of action in the underlying
substantive statute.  Instead, the &quot;right . . . secured&quot; language
connotes that the right is mandatory.  <I>See Pennhurst State School and
Hospital v. Halderman</I>, 451 U.S. 1 (1981)(<I>Pennhurst I</I>).  No section
of the Constitution has an express right of action, yet many sections have been
held by the Court to &quot;secure&quot; rights that are enforceable through &#167;1983.
 <I>See Chapman</I>, 441 U.S. at 613 n.29 (referring to rights &quot;protected
by the Constitution and hence secured by it&quot;)(citations omitted).  Thus, to
adopt petitioner's argument, the Court would either have to hold that &quot;secured&quot;
means something different when it refers to the Constitution than when it refers
to laws, or that the Constitution does not &quot;secure&quot; any rights and &#167;1983

<P>CONCLUSION</P>
<HR>
<P>INTEREST OF AMICUS <SUP>1</SUP></P>
<P>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a nationwide, nonprofit,
nonpartisan organization with nearly 300,000 members.  The ACLU was founded over
seventy-five years ago to preserve and protect the fundamental principles of the
Bill of Rights.</P>
<P>It has appeared in numerous cases seeking to vindicate the deprivation of
federally protected rights.  Amici believe that if federal courts are to remain
the paramount protectors of such rights, the doctrine enunciated by the Court in
Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), must be reaffirmed.  We respectfully submit
this brief in the hope of assisting the Court as it considers the important
issues presented by this case.</P>
<P>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</P>
<P>In 1991, the Coeur d'Alene Indian Tribe (the &quot;Tribe&quot;) filed suit
in the United States District Court for the District of Idaho against the State
of Idaho, several state agencies and several state officials, including the
members of the state Board of Land Commissioners.  It sought quiet title to all
submerged lands within the boundaries of its reservation, including Lake Coeur
d'Alene, and declaratory and injunctive relief precluding state agencies and
officials from regulating and interfering with its possession of the disputed
property.  The Tribe claimed title to the land pursuant to unextinguished
aboriginal rights and an Executive Order, signed by President U. S. Grant on
November 8, 1873, and ratified by Congress in 1891.  Coeur d'Alene Tribe of
Idaho v. Idaho, 42 F.3d 1244, 1247 (9th Cir. 1994).</P>
<P>Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b), Idaho moved to dismiss the Tribe's
complaint, arguing that the Tribe's action was barred by the Eleventh Amendment
and that the Tribe had failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted.
 By Order dated July 20, 1992, the district court granted Idaho's motion,
dismissing the Tribe's suit in its entirety.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">1 Letters of consent to the filing of this brief have been
lodged with the Clerk of the Court pursuant to Rule 37.3.</FONT></P>
<P>The district court concluded that the Eleventh Amendment barred all claims
against Idaho and its agencies, and the claims for quiet title and declaratory
relief against the state officials.  Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho v. Idaho, 798
F.Supp. 1443, 1446-9 (D. Idaho 1992).  The court reasoned that the state
officials were entitled to immunity with respect to the quiet title and
declaratory relief claims because they were the functional equivalent of damages
claims against Idaho.  Id. at 1448-49, citing Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651
(1974).  Although the district court found that the officials were not entitled
to sovereign immunity with respect to the Tribe's claims for injunctive relief,
it nevertheless dismissed them after finding, as a matter of law, that Idaho had
a right to possess the land at issue.  798 F.Supp. at 1452.</P>
<P>The Tribe appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.  42 F.3d at 1247-48.  It agreed

that the Eleventh Amendment bars all claims against Idaho and its agencies, as
well as the quiet title claim against the officials.  It found, however, that
the Eleventh Amendment did not bar the Tribe's claims for declaratory or
injunctive relief against the officials.  Relying on this Court's plurality
decision in Florida Dep't Of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U.S. 679
(1982), it held that these claims were not claims for monetary damages, but only
sought to preclude future violations of federal law and were therefore
permissible under Ex Parte Young and its progeny.</P>
<P>It further found that it was conceivable that the Tribe could prove facts
that would entitle it to the relief that it sought.  Thus, it reversed the
district court's dismissal of the injunctive claims against the state officials
and remanded the case back to the district court.<SUP>2</SUP>  42 F.3d at 1257.</P>
<P>This Court granted certiorari on April 16, 1996.  This brief is limited to
the question of whether the Eleventh Amendment bars the Tribe's action against
the state officials for declaratory and injunctive relief.</P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>The Tribe's claims against Idaho state officials for declaratory and
injunctive relief fall squarely within the exception to the Eleventh Amendment
articulated by the Court in Ex Parte Young.  Under the Young doctrine, the
Eleventh Amendment does not bar a federal court from adjudicating a claim for
prospective declaratory and injunctive relief against state officials who
allegedly act contrary to federal law.  Here, the Tribe claims that Idaho state
officials, by regulating and administering the land in question, are violating
federal law.  They are intruding on property rights conferred on the Tribe by a
federal statute.  The relief sought by the Tribe is prospective, as opposed to
retrospective, in nature.  It seeks to prevent further violations of its
property rights.  It does not seek damages or restitution for past wrongs, nor
does it seek to rescind a past transfer of property.</P>
<P>Idaho state officials argue that the Young doctrine does not apply to this
action, or to any action involving real property.  More specifically, they
contend that real property actions against state officials should be barred by
the Eleventh Amendment because such suits actually seek to adjudicate the
state's interest in or right to property and cannot resolve title disputes. 
They further contend that they are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity in
this action because Idaho has a greater right to the disputed property than the
Tribe and the Tribe can bring suit against Idaho to quiet title in state court.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">2 Between the Ninth Circuit's issuance of its opinion and
this Court's granting of certiorari, the United States filed suit against the
State of Idaho on behalf of the Tribe, seeking to quiet title to approximately a
third of the land covered by the Tribe's suit.  United States v. Idaho, No.
94-0328 (D. Idaho)(complaint filed July 21, 1994).</FONT></P>
<P>Idaho state officials' arguments should be rejected.  First, the Young
doctrine has been used repeatedly to enforce real and personal property rights
where, as here, the right to possess the property is founded in federal law or
the deprivation of the property raises federal constitutional or statutory
concerns.  See, e.g., Meigs v. M'Clung's Lessee, 13 U.S. (9 Cranch.) 11 (1815);
United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196 (1882); Poindexter v. Greenhow, 114 U.S. 270
(1884); Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U.S. 1 (1891); Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U.S.
137 (1897); Goltra v. Weeks, 271 U.S. 536 (1926); Florida Dep't of State v.
Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U.S. 670.</P>
<P>Creation of a real property exception to the Young doctrine would not only
require the Court to overrule 200 years of jurisprudence, but would also
seriously jeopardize the federal constitutional right to enjoy, own and dispose
of property without undue governmental interference.  Those deprived of such a
right would not be able to bring suit in federal court to seek vindication.</P>
<P>Second, as this Court has repeatedly recognized, all actions using the Young
doctrine are actions seeking to adjudicate a state's interests or rights. 
Pennhurst State School &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 101-02 (1984); 
Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 166 (1985).  Real property actions are no
different.</P>
<P>Third, the fact that such suits cannot resolve title disputes is largely
irrelevant.  Here, as against the state officials, plaintiffs only seek
cessation of those of Idaho's regulatory powers that are harmful to the Tribe. 
Should a court find in favor of plaintiffs and Idaho subsequently wishes to
assert its ownership of the property, it may pursue its own remedies. Lee, 106
U.S. at 222; Tindal, 167 U.S. at 223.</P>
<P>Fourth, the fact that the state officials may ultimately prevail on the
merits is also irrelevant.  A determination of the merits in order to determine
Eleventh Amendment immunity is patently improper.  Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458
U.S. at 699-700 (Stevens, J.); id. at 703 (White, J.).</P>
<P>Finally, the availability of a state forum does not deprive a federal court
of jurisdiction.  Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167 (1961); Zwickler v. Koota, 389
U.S. 241 (1967).  To hold otherwise would mean that federal courts would no
longer be the paramount protectors of federal rights.  Each individual state
legislature could prevent federal courts from adjudicating such rights by
enacting some sort of remedial scheme.</P>
<P>Thus, because the Eleventh Amendment does not bar the Tribe's claims against
the Idaho state officials, the decision of the Ninth Circuit must be affirmed.</P>
<P>ARGUMENT</P>
<P>I. THE COURT SHOULD NOT CREATE A REAL PROPERTY EXCEPTION TO EX PARTE  YOUNG</P>
<P>In Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, this Court formally acknowledged the
fiction that has permitted litigants to sue states in federal courts for
violations of federally protected rights.  While recognizing that suits against
states seeking to enjoin state action violative of federally protected rights
were barred by the Eleventh Amendment, the Court ruled that suits against the
state officials responsible for the unlawful acts were not barred.3  The Court
reasoned that, in their capacity as sovereigns, states were incapable of
authorizing acts that infringe on rights secured by federal constitutional and
statutory law, and thus unable to impart immunity to those they entrust with
their implementation.  Id. at 159.</P>
<P>If the act which the state Attorney General seeks to enforce be a violation
of the Federal Constitution, the officer, in proceeding under such enactment,
comes into conflict with the superior authority of that Constitution, and he is
in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is
subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct.</P>
<P>Id. at 159-60.</P>
<P>Today, it is widely recognized that the doctrine annunciated in Young is &quot;indispensable
to the establishment of constitutional government and the rule of law.&quot;  C.
Wright, Law of Federal Courts 312 (5th ed. 1994).  See also Erwin Chemerinsky,
Federal Jurisdiction 393 (2d ed. 1994).  The Young doctrine establishes the
power of federal courts to enforce federal law against state legislative and
executive actions.  It maintains the supremacy of the United States Constitution
and federal statutory law in the face of state policy or action that threatens
federal instrumentalities or federal programs or is in defiance of
constitutional inhibitions.  See Pennhurst State School &amp; Hosp. v.
Halderman, 465 U.S. at 105 (&quot;the Young doctrine rests on the need to
promote the vindication of federal rights&quot;); Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64,
68 (1985)(&quot;[r]emedies designed to end a continuing violation of federal law
are necessary to vindicate the federal interest in assuring the supremacy of
that law&quot;).</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">3 Although Ex Parte Young involved the deprivation of a
constitutional right, there is no doubt that the doctrine established by that
case applies also to federal statutory violations.  See Worcester County Trust
Co. v. Riley, 302 U.S. 292, 297 (1937)(&quot;[g]enerally suits to restrain
action of state officials can . . . be prosecuted only when the action sought to
be restrained is without the authority of state law or contravenes the statutes
or Constitution of the United States&quot;); Almond Hill School v. United States
Dep't of Agriculture, 768 F. 2d 1030, 1034 (9th Cir. 1985)(&quot;a state cannot
authorize its officials to act in violation of federal statutory law&quot;).</FONT></P>
<P>Idaho state officials and their amici urge the Court to adopt a real
property exception to Ex Parte Young.  They claim that, at least in the real
property context, principles of federalism outweigh the rights of individuals to
litigate federal constitutional or statutory deprivations in federal court.  In
essence, the state officials and their amici ask the Court to rule that some
federal rights are more supreme, and consequently, more worthy of protection
than others.  Their arguments should be rejected.  The Constitution does not
prioritize protected rights; neither should the Court.  The right to protect
real property from unconstitutional takings or takings that violate federal
statutory rights should not be relegated to second-class status.</P>
<P>A.  The Court Has Repeatedly Sanctioned The Use Of The Officer Suit Doctrine
In Actions Seeking Possession Of Real Property</P>

<P>Since its inception in jurisprudence, the officer suit doctrine has been
used repeatedly to maintain the supremacy of real and personal property rights
where the right to possess the property is grounded in federal law or the
deprivation of the property raises federal constitutional or statutory concerns.
 Although Young was not decided until 1908, justification for the doctrine
actually dates back nearly as far as the doctrine of sovereign immunity itself. 
As early as the 13th century, English common law courts distinguished between
the King and his servants when applying the doctrine of sovereign immunity.  See
Louis L. Jaffe, &quot;Suits Against Governments and Officers:  Sovereign
Immunity,&quot; 77 Harv. L.Rev. 1, 9 (1963).</P>
<P>This Court acknowledged its existence in the first cases concerning the
application of the doctrine of sovereign immunity to the conduct of state
officials.</P>
<P>Although not a property case, Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 22 U.S.
(9 Wheat.) 738 (1824), is viewed as the Court's first acknowledgment of the
doctrine.  In Osborn, the Court upheld the issuance of an injunction preventing
Ohio's tax collectors from levying a tax against the Bank of the United States
pursuant to an unconstitutional state law.  Id. at 860-71.  In so doing, it
rejected defendants' argument that, because they were state officials acting
pursuant to state law, the case was barred by the Eleventh Amendment. 
Recognizing the need to maintain the supremacy of federal law, the Court stated
that, &quot;if the law of the State of Ohio be repugnant to the constitution, or
to a law of the United States made in pursuance thereof . . . [it can] furnish
no authority to those who took, or to those who received, the money for which
the suit was instituted.&quot;  Id. at 859.  Stripped of their state authority,
the defendants were little more than bank robbers who had taken money &quot;by
violence.&quot;  Id. at 741.  See United States v. Peters, 9 U.S. (5 Cranch.)
115 (1809)(applying officer suit doctrine to a suit involving title to proceeds
of the sale of a vessel condemned as a prize of war).</P>
<P>In the property context, the doctrine initially was used to permit
adjudication of suits against military officials for possession (as opposed to
title) of real property which federal or state governments had seized for
military purposes.  In each suit, the Court recognized that although the
government was not named as a party defendant, the Court was being asked to
adjudicate its right to possess the disputed property.</P>
<P>In Meigs v. M'Clung's Lessee, 13 U.S. 11, for example, the Court adjudicated
a dispute between plaintiffs and military officials in which plaintiffs sought
possession of land on which the United States government had erected a garrison
at great expense.  Although the officials asserted as a defense that they
occupied the land at the behest of the United States government, the Court
stated that the &quot;the United Sates cannot have intended to deprive [the
plaintiff] of [his land] by violence, and without compensation.&quot;  Id. at
18.</P>
<P>In United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, the Court held that it had
jurisdiction to adjudicate a suit brought by General Robert E. Lee's son to oust
federal officials from Arlington, property that had been seized by the United
States government pursuant to an order of the Secretary of War.  Although
defendants ultimately conceded that the Secretary's order was unconstitutional,
they claimed that they were entitled to sovereign immunity because they occupied
the land at the request of the United States.  Id. at 204.  In rejecting this
defense, the Court cited to those Amendments to the Constitution which stated &quot;[t]hat
no person * * * shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due
process of law, nor shall private property be taken for public use without just
compensation.&quot;  It then reasoned that if it had the power to protect
against the seizure of life and liberty by the government through the issuance
of writs of habeas corpus to individual government officials, it must also have
the right to protect against the seizure of property by the government without
just compensation.  Id. at 218.</P>
<P>No man in this country is so high that he is above the law.  No officer of
the law may set that law at defiance, with impunity . . . . It is the only
supreme power in our system of government, and every man who, by accepting an
office, participates in its functions, is only the more strongly bound to submit
to that supremacy, and to observe the limitations it imposes . . . .</P>
<P>Id. at 220.4</P>
<P>The Court soon moved away from the military context.  In White v. Greenhow,
114 U.S. 307 (1885), it held that an action against the treasurer of the City of
Richmond, Virginia, for the recovery of personal property seized for delinquent
taxes, was not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  Because the state statute
pursuant to which the treasurer had taken the property was unconstitutional, the
action could not be characterized as one against the state for purposes of
sovereign immunity.  Id. at 316-17, citing Poindexter v. Greenhow, 114 U.S. 270.</P>
<P>Relying on Osborn, the Court in Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U.S. 1, ruled
that it could enjoin Oregon state officials from selling land to which the
plaintiff claimed title pursuant to a contract with the state.  The Court
ultimately concluded that the state legislation authorizing the state officials
to sell the property was unconstitutional in that it impaired the state's
contractual obligations.  Because the state could not authorize its officials to
commit unconstitutional acts, it could not immunize them from liability for the
commission of such acts.  Id. at 10.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">4 In their amicus brief, the Council of State Governments,
et al., wrongly assert that Lee and other cases cited herein are really due
process cases and hold that the officer suit fiction is unavailable if
plaintiffs may seek relief in another forum, such as a state court.  Brief of
the Council of State Governments, et al. (&quot;Council's Brief&quot;) at 15-18.
 Such an argument ignores the plain language of these decisions.  In none of
these cases does the Court rule that the existence of a state remedy deprives a
federal court of jurisdiction.  Instead, it repeatedly asserts that the officer
suit fiction is available to maintain the supremacy of federal law in the face
of state action that violates federally protected rights.  See, e.g., Lee, 106
U.S. at 218-20.</FONT></P>
<P>In Tindal v. Wesley, 167 U.S. 204, the Court rejected defendants' sovereign
immunity defense in an action seeking to recover possession of real property
which the State of South Carolina allegedly had seized without affording
plaintiffs due process or providing them with just compensation.  Defendants
argued that, because they had taken possession of the property on behalf of the
state, a suit against them was a suit against the state and barred by the
Eleventh Amendment.  Relying on Lee, the Court stated that &quot;[the] Eleventh
Amendment gives no immunity to officers or agents of a State in withholding the
property of a citizen without authority of law.&quot;  167 U.S. at 222.  See
Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 58 (1897)(Eleventh Amendment did not bar action to
restrain state officials from seizing wines and liquors pursuant to state liquor
dispensary law where it was alleged that state law was unconstitutional).</P>
<P>In 1908, citing Osborn, Lee, Pennoyer, and Tindal, the Court issued its
decision in Ex Parte Young, itself a property case.  In Young, shareholders of
the Northern Pacific Railway Company sought an injunction preventing Minnesota's
attorney general from enforcing legislation setting rates for the transportation
of passengers and commodities within Minnesota.  Plaintiffs contended that the
rates were so low that they were confiscatory and amounted to a deprivation of
property without due process.  209 U.S. at 127-132.  The defendant claimed that
he was entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity because plaintiffs' action was
really against the state.  In rejecting this defense, the Court stated:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The act to be enforced is alleged to be unconstitutional; and if it be so,
the use of the name of the state to enforce an unconstitutional act to the
injury of complainants is a proceeding without the authority of, and one which
does not affect, the state in its sovereign or governmental capacity.  It is
simply an illegal act upon the part of a state official in attempting, by the
use of the name of the state, to enforce a legislative enactment which is void
because unconstitutional.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 159.  See also Public Service Co. v. Corboy, 250 U.S. 153
(1919)(state drainage commissioner not entitled to sovereign immunity in an
action to enjoin him from diverting water from a river where state law
authorizing diversion was allegedly unconstitutional); Goltra v. Weeks, 271 U.S.
536 (using the officer suit doctrine to permit adjudication of a case alleging
that a United States officer had seized a fleet of towboats and barges leased to
plaintiff in violation of plaintiff's due process rights); Ickes v. Fox, 300

U.S. 82 (1937)(using officer suit doctrine in an action to enjoin the Secretary
of the Interior from enforcing an order, the wrongful effect of which would have
deprived plaintiffs of property rights acquired under Congressional acts, state
laws and government contracts).</P>
<P>Because the officer suit doctrine had also been used to remedy common law
torts arising under state law,<SUP>5</SUP> the Court in Larson v. Domestic &amp;
Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682 (1949), clarified that the rule of law set
forth in Lee and Tindal only applied to those real property disputes raising
federal constitutional or statutory concerns.  More specifically, the Court
found that while a state could not authorize state officials to violate federal
law, it could authorize them to commit a common law tort.  Thus, state officials
who committed common law torts were entitled to sovereign immunity, unless that
tort also amounted to a violation of a federal constitutional or statutory
right.<SUP>6</SUP>  Id. at 693, 695.  See Malone v. Bowdoin, 369 U.S. 643
(1962) (holding that federal court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate land
dispute with federal government because plaintiffs did not allege a violation of
federal constitutional or statutory rights).</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">5 See, e.g., Brown v. Huger, 62 U.S. (21 How.) 305
(1859)(action against military officer to recover possession of the military
arsenal at Harper's Ferry, a suit which plaintiff ultimately lost on the
merits); Grisar v. McDowell, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 363 (1868)(suit against a
military officer for possession of land set aside for military purposes, another
suit which plaintiff ultimately lost on the merits).</FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P>In 1972, Congress passed the Quiet Title Act, 28 U.S.C. ??1346(f), 1402(d)
and 2409(a), in which the United States waived sovereign immunity with respect
to real property disputes.  Consequently, the officer suit doctrine was no
longer necessary to resolve such controversies with the federal government.  See
Block v. North Dakota, 461 U.S. 273 (1983).  In 1982, however, the Court
affirmed its holdings in Lee and Tindal as they applied to property disputes
involving state governments.  In Florida Dep't of State v. Treasure Salvors,
Inc., 458 U.S. 670, it held that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar the issuance
of an arrest warrant requiring state officials to turn over property obtained
from a sunken ship.  The state could not authorize the officers to retain
possession of the property without raising &quot;a substantial constitutional

<P>Thus, the basic principle that in appropriate circumstances federal courts
will exercise their equity power against state officials to protect property
rights secured and activities authorized by paramount federal law is firmly
embedded in our jurisprudence.</P>
<P>B.  The Arguments Of The Idaho State Officials And Their Amici On Behalf Of
A Real Property Exception To Ex Parte Young Are Without  Merit</P>
<P>Idaho state officials and their amici would have this Court overrule almost
200 years of jurisprudence to adopt a real property exception to the Young
doctrine.  They claim that such an exception should be made because suits
against state officers for possession of disputed property are really suits
against the state.  Brief for the Petitioner (&quot;Pet. Brief&quot;) at 12-26;
Council's Brief at 11-14.  They further argue that because it is the state who
ultimately claims title to the land, such suits could never ultimately resolve
the dispute before the court, i.e., which of the litigants has better title. 
Brief of the Amici States of California, et al. (&quot;States' Brief&quot;) at
15; Council's Brief at 19-26.  Each contention is without merit.</P>
<P>With respect to the first, real property disputes are no different than any
other suit in which the Young doctrine is employed.  All such suits seek to
adjudicate a state's interests or rights.  Although they may not seek to
adjudicate a state's right to possess real property, they could seek to
adjudicate a state's right to personal property, see, e.g., Spruytte v. Walters,
753 F.2d 498 (6th Cir. 1985)(applying Young doctrine to prisoner's claim to a
paperback dictionary); Demery v. Kupperman, 735 F.2d 1139 (9th Cir.), cert.
denied, 469 U.S. 1127 (1985)(applying Young doctrine to suit against state
officer who had allegedly conspired to revoke plaintiff's medical license); or
they could contest the state's right to promulgate certain laws, see, e.g.,
American Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Opelousas v. Dent, 982 F.2d 917 (5th Cir.
1993)(using officer suit doctrine in action seeking declaration that a state
statute prohibiting the sale of insurance was unconstitutional); practices, see,
e.g., Armstead v. Coler, 914 F.2d 1464 (11th Cir. 1990)(applying Young doctrine
to case in which mentally retarded patients challenged state's failure to
provide them with appropriate services); or procedures.  See, e.g., Hoohuli v.
Ariyoshi, 741 F.2d 1169 (9th Cir. 1984)(using Young doctrine in suit challenging
state system of disbursing benefits to those who had descended from aboriginal
inhabitants).</P>
<P>This Court has long recognized that &quot;an official-capacity suit is, in
all respects other than name . . . a suit against the [government] entity.&quot;
 Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 166 (1985).  As the Court stated in
Pennhurst, Ex Parte Young is &quot;an important exception to [the] general rule&quot;
that a suit against state officials that is in fact a suit against a State is
barred.  Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 101-02.  See Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U.S. at
685 (Stevens, J.) (&quot;[t]here is a well-recognized irony in Ex Parte Young;
unconstitutional conduct by a state officer may be `state action' for purposes
of the Fourteenth Amendment yet not attributable to the State for purposes of
the Eleventh&quot;).</P>
<P>With respect to the second contention, the fact that adjudication of a
property dispute against state officials will not quiet title to the land in
question is largely irrelevant.  For the last 100 years, this Court has held
that the fact that a federal court may not have the power to adjudicate the
state's title to property does not prevent it from adjudicating who has right to
physical possession of that property.  Lee, 106 U.S. at 222; Tindal, 167 U.S. at
223-24; Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U.S. at 697 (Stevens, J.).</P>
<P>Moreover, as this Court noted in Tindal, a state does not have to stand by
while the federal action moves forward.  Like any other litigant who feels that
its rights are being threatened, a state may always intervene.  Should it choose
not to, it may &quot;bring any action that may be appropriate to establish and
protect whatever claim it has to the premises in dispute.&quot;  167 U.S. at
223.  See Lee, 106 U.S. at 222 (noting that &quot;the government is always at
liberty, notwithstanding any such judgment, to avail itself of all the remedies
which the law allows to every person, natural or artificial&quot; to quiet its
title to the land in question).</P>
<P>The argument of the state officials, however, should be rejected for a
third, more important reason.  To preclude federal courts from adjudicating real
property disputes that raise federal law concerns will seriously jeopardize the
federal constitutional right to enjoy, own and dispose of property without undue
governmental interference.  It could very well result in the subjugation of
federal law to unconstitutional state policies, practices and laws.  As the
plurality noted in Treasure Salvors, Inc.:</P>
<P>If a statute of the State of Florida were to authorize state officials to
hold [property] in circumstances such as those presented in this case, a
substantial constitutional question would be presented.  In essence, the State
would have authorized state officials to retain property regardless of the
manner in which it was acquired, with no duty to provide compensation for a
public taking.  If the Constitution provided no protection against such
unbridled authority, all property rights would exist only at the whim of the
sovereign.</P>
<P>458 U.S. at 697 (Stevens, J.).  See Osborn, 22 U.S. at 847 (to deny
jurisdiction in cases raising questions of federal law would result in the
untenable assertion that &quot;the agents of a State, alleging the authority of
a law void in itself, because repugnant to the constitution, may arrest the
execution of any law in the United States&quot;).</P>
<P>It will also result in the prioritization of federal constitutional and
statutory rights.  A real property exception to the Young doctrine essentially
proclaims that while all rights might be supreme, some are more supreme, and
worthy of protection, than others.  Federal courts will be able to protect
against the deprivation of life and liberty without due process, but unable to
prevent the deprivation of property without due process or just compensation.</P>
<P>This Court previously has refused to create such a hierarchy of rights. 
See, e.g., Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 552 (1972)(citing
interdependence between right to liberty and right to property), Dolan v. City
of Tigard, 512 U.S.  , 114 S.Ct. 2309, 2320 (1994)(acknowledging that the
Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment is as much a part of the Bill of Rights as
the First and Fourteenth Amendments).  It should not do so now.</P>
<P>II.  THE NINTH CIRCUIT PROPERLY HELD THAT THE ELEVENTH AMENDMENT DOES NOT
PRECLUDE A FEDERAL COURT FROM ADJUDICATING THE TRIBE'S CLAIM AGAINST  THE  IDAHO
 STATE  OFFICIALS</P>
<P>The Tribe's claims against Idaho state officials fall squarely within the
exception to the Eleventh Amendment created by Lee, Tindal, Ex Parte Young and
Treasure Salvors, Inc.  The Eleventh Amendment does not bar a federal court from
adjudicating a claim for prospective injunctive relief against state officials
who are allegedly acting contrary to federal law.</P>
<P>Here, the Tribe seeks an injunction enjoining the Idaho state officials from
violating rights allegedly secured to it by an executive order ratified as a
federal statute.  Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho v. Idaho, 42 F.3d at 1247.  See
Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, 414 U.S. 661, 667 (1974)(Indian
property rights are federal rights).  The fact that the state officials, in
administering and maintaining the disputed land, may be acting in a manner
consistent with a state statute does not deprive a federal court of
jurisdiction.  See States' Brief at 8-9.  As the Ninth Circuit stated:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Because federal law preempts state law, if the property at issue in this
case belongs to the Tribe pursuant to federal law, the Officials must conform
their actions to that federal law in spite of state statutes that purport to
regulate the property as belonging to the states.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>42 F.3d at 1251.<SUP>7</SUP></P>
<P>The relief sought by the Tribe against the state officials is prospective
injunctive relief, consistent with the principles annunciated by this Court in
Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651.  In Edelman, the Court ruled that the Young
doctrine only applied to official capacity suits seeking prospective, as opposed
to retrospective, relief.  Subsequent Supreme Court decisions explained that the
Young doctrine was not designed to compensate victims for loss, but to prevent
future unlawful acts.  See Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 105-06; Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416
U.S. 232, 238 (1974).  They also explained that the fact than an injunction
requiring state officials to conform their future conduct to the requirements of
federal law may have an ancillary effect on the state treasury does not make it
impermissible.  Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 337 (1979).</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">7 Defendants wrongfully analogize this case to one in which
state officers are acting pursuant to &quot;admittedly constitutional&quot;
state statutes.  Pet. Brief at 32.  The Tribe has never conceded the lawfulness
of the state statutes at issue.</FONT></P>
<P>Here, the Tribe seeks an injunction prohibiting Idaho state officials from
taking any action in the future that violates its rights to the use and
occupancy of the land in question.  Complaint at 9.  As the Ninth Circuit noted,
the Tribe &quot;is not seeking damages or restitution for past wrongs nor is it
seeking to rescind a past transfer of property.&quot;  42 F.3d at 1254-55.  See
Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U.S. at 698-9 (Stevens, J.)(plaintiff's request for
possession of disputed property was permissible relief because it did not seek &quot;an
attachment of state funds and would impose no burden on the state treasury . . .
. [it] is not asserting a claim for damages against either the State . . . or
its officials&quot;).</P>
<P>That the Tribe's claims are based, in part, on an Executive Order issued in
1873 does not make the relief it seeks retrospective.  The continuing act of
holding the Tribe's property can be characterized as an ongoing violation of
federal law.  See John F. Duffy, &quot;Sovereign Immunity, the Officer Suit
Fiction, and Entitlement Benefits,&quot; 56 U.Chi.L. Rev. 205, 303 n.45 (1989). 
Pursuant to this Court's decision in Quern, the fact that requiring state
officials to cede possession of the property to the Tribe may have an effect on
Idaho's treasury is immaterial.  See Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267 (1977).</P>
<P>Despite the above, Idaho state officials and their amici argue that the
Tribe's claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment because Idaho has a stronger
legal entitlement to the property than does the Tribe.  Pet. Brief at 18-26;
States' Brief at 15-16.<SUP>8</SUP>  As this Court has held, a determination of
the merits in order to determine Eleventh Amendment immunity is patently
improper.  Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U.S. at 700 (Stevens, J.)(&quot;[i]n
making the determination [that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar the execution
of the arrest warrant], the court of appeals improperly adjudicated the State's
right to the artifacts&quot;).  See id. at 703 (White, J.)(merging a
determination on the merits of the validity of State's claim with resolution of
the jurisdiction issue &quot;is equivalent to asserting that suits against a
state are permitted by the eleventh amendment if the result is that the state
loses&quot;), citing Florida Dep't. of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 621 F.2d
at 1352 (Rubin, J, dissenting).  &quot;The possibility that a defendant will
ultimately prevail on the merits does not clothe that defendant in Eleventh
Amendment immunity.&quot;  Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho v. Idaho, 42 F.3d at
1251.  See Scheuer, 416 U.S. at 238.<SUP>9</SUP></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">8 In fact, the state amici go as far as to assert that the
Ex Parte Young fiction should not apply to claims that are &quot;frivolous or
insubstantial.&quot;  States' Brief at 15.  There are a variety of devices to
combat frivolous or unsubstantial allegations short of an Eleventh Amendment
jurisdictional bar.  These devices include motions to dismiss for failure to
state a claim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and motions for sanctions pursuant to
Fed.R.Civ.P. 11.</FONT></P>
<P>Idaho state officials also argue that they are entitled to Eleventh
Amendment immunity because the Tribe already has an adequate remedy under state
law.  They claim that the Tribe may bring a quiet title action against Idaho in
state court pursuant to a quiet title law enacted by Idaho's legislature.  Pet.
Brief at 26 n.6; States' Brief at 12-13; Council's Brief at 15-19.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">9 The Treasure Salvors, Inc. decision has been interpreted
as holding that the existence of the Eleventh Amendment immunity depends on
which party to the litigation has a &quot;colorable&quot; claim to the disputed
property.  If the state has a colorable claim, then it is entitled to sovereign
immunity.  See Pet. Brief at 19-20, 23-26.  Amici respectfully suggest that this
interpretation of the Treasure Salvors, Inc. decision is incorrect.  A decision
as to which party's claim is more &quot;colorable&quot; necessarily involves a
determination of the merits.</FONT></P>

<P>This argument must be rejected for a number of reasons.  First, this is not
a procedural due process case.  Thus, the fact that the State may provide the
Tribe with a procedural due process remedy is irrelevant.  Cf. Parratt v.
Taylor, 451 U.S. 527 (1981); Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113 (1990).</P>
<P>Second, the availability of a state forum does not deprive a federal court
of jurisdiction.  As the Court noted in Monroe v. Pape:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is no answer that the State has a law which if enforced would give
relief.  The federal remedy is supplementary to the state remedy, and the latter
need not be first sought and refused before the federal one is invoked.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>365 U.S. 167, 183 (1961).  See Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. at 248, quoting
Robb v.Connolly, 111 U.S. 624, 637 (1884) (&quot;escape from [adjudication of a
constitutional claim] is not permissible merely because state courts also have
the solemn responsibility, equally with the federal courts ` . . . to guard,
enforce, and protect every right granted or secured by the Constitution of the
United States'&quot;).</P>
<P>Should the Court adopt the arguments of the defendant state officials and
hold otherwise, federal courts would no longer be the paramount protectors of
federal constitutional rights.  Each state legislature could prevent those
federal courts within its jurisdiction from adjudicating federally protected
rights by enacting some sort of state remedial scheme.  As this Court has
repeatedly recognized, however, Congress intended, with the passage of the 1871
Civil Rights Act, to &quot;`interpose the federal courts between the States and
the people, as guardian of the people's federal rights.'&quot;  Patsy v. Florida
Board of Regents, 457 U.S. 496, 503 (1982), quoting Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S.
225, 242 (1972).  See Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 472-73 (1974).<SUP>10</SUP></P>
<P>Lastly, under the guise of an immunity argument, the amici of the Idaho
state officials claim that general equitable principles require a court to
abstain from adjudicating this action.<SUP>11</SUP>  Citing Younger v. Harris,
401 U.S. 37 (1971), they argue that a federal court should refuse to exercise
jurisdiction over the Tribe's claims because &quot;the relief sanctioned by the
court of appeals&quot; could result in the ejection of the public from the
disputed land, Council's Brief at 12-15, 19-20, &quot;anarchy,&quot; id. at 24,
and &quot;confrontation which breaches the peace.&quot;  Id. at 25.  See States'
Brief at 9-10.</P>
<P>First, Younger does not apply in this case.  In Younger, the Court held that
federal courts must abstain from adjudicating actions that will impermissibly
interfere with ongoing state court proceedings.  401 U.S. at 41.  Here, there is
no ongoing state court proceeding with which this action could interfere.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">10 The fact that the United States may bring suit on behalf
of the Tribe as its trustee also does not deprive a federal court of
jurisdiction.  As this Court has noted, there may be circumstances where the
United States is either unable or unwilling to bring such a suit because of a
conflict of interest or a lack of resources or political will.  See Arizona v.
San Carlos Apache Tribe, 463 U.S. 545, 560 n.10 (1983); Blatchford v. Native
Village of Noatak, 501 U.S. 775, 784-5 (1991)(Blackmun, J., dissenting); see
also 28 U.S.C. ?1362.  In this case, for example, although the United States has
filed an action on behalf of the Tribe, it only seeks to quiet title to
approximately a third of the land covered by this suit.  See United States v.
Idaho, No. 94-0328 (D. Idaho)(complaint filed July 21, 1994).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">11 Defendants also argue that this case is analogous to
Oregon v. Hitchcock, 202 U.S. 60 (1906), and Louisiana v. Garfield, 211 U.S. 70
(1908), real property disputes against the United States government involving
questions of federal statutory interpretation in which the Court refused to
employ the officer suit fiction.  Pet. Brief at 32-34.  Defendants are wrong. 
The Court refused to adjudicate these suits because they essentially sought to
review discretionary acts by the executive, a co-equal branch of government and,
therefore, presented what today would be called &quot;political questions.&quot;
 See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 208-29 (1962).</FONT></P>
<P>Second, the argument of amici presupposes that the Tribe will prevail and
that it will take certain actions after it has won the right to control the
disputed property.  Nothing in the history of the Young doctrine suggests that
state officers are entitled to sovereign immunity because plaintiffs might win.</P>
<P>Finally, in Lee, a case also involving access to land held by the government
for the benefit of the public, this Court rejected a similar argument, stating:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The fact that the property, which is the subject of this controversy, is
devoted to public uses, is strongly urged as a reason why those who are so using
it under the authority of the United States shall not be sued for its
possession, even by one who proves a clear title to that possession.  In this
connection many cases of imaginary evils have been suggested, if the contrary
doctrine should prevail.  Among these are a supposed seizure of vessels of war,
invasions of forts . . . . Hypothetical cases of great evils may be suggested by
a particularly fruitful imagination in regard to almost every law upon which
depends the rights of the individual or of the Government, and if the existence
of laws is to depend upon their capacity to withstand such criticism, the whole
fabric of the law must fail.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>106 U.S. at 217.</P>
<P>Thus, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar the Tribe's claims against the
defendant state officials for injunctive and declaratory relief.</P>
<P>CONCLUSION</P>
<P>For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the court of appeals should be
affirmed.</P>

<P>CONCLUSION</P>
<HR>
<P>INTEREST OF AMICI <SUP>1</SUP></P>
<P>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a nationwide, nonprofit,
nonpartisan organization with nearly 300,000 members dedicated to the principles
embodied in the Bill of Rights.  The ACLU of Ohio is one of its statewide
affiliates.  Since its founding in 1920, the ACLU has frequently appeared before
this Court, both as direct counsel and as amicus curiae.  In particular, the
ACLU has participated in many cases involving the Fourth Amendment.  Because
this case addresses an important Fourth Amendment question, its proper
resolution is a matter of significant concern to the ACLU and its members.</P>
<P>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</P>
<P>The facts are not contested.  On August 3, 1992, Deputy Roger Newsome of the

Montgomery County Sheriff's Department was on drug interdiction patrol on
Interstate 70 when he stopped respondent, Robert Robinette, for speeding through
a construction zone.  Following his usual practice, Newsome had already decided
to issue respondent a verbal warning before even approaching respondent's car. 
Pet. App.2.</P>
<P>After obtaining respondent's driver's license and determining that there
were no outstanding warrants or violations, Newsome asked respondent to exit his
vehicle and stand between his car and Newsome's cruiser.  Newsome then activated
his cruiser's video camera to videotape the encounter with respondent.  As he
had planned from the outset, Newsome warned respondent about speeding and
returned his driver's license.  This did not, however, end the encounter. 
Rather, Newsome continued:  &quot;One question before you get gone [sic]:  are
you carrying any illegal contraband in your car? Any weapons of any kind, drugs,
anything like that?&quot; <SUP>2</SUP>  Pet.App.2.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">1 Letters of consent to the filing of this brief have been
lodged with the Clerk of the Court pursuant to Rule 37.3.</FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P>Respondent gave a negative reply to Newsome's inquiry about contraband. 
Newsome nevertheless asked for permission to search respondent's car. 
Respondent testified at the suppression hearing that he was shocked at Newsome's
request to search the car and &quot;automatically&quot; answered &quot;yes.&quot;
 Newsome testified that he routinely asked permission to search the cars of
motorists he had stopped.  Pet.App.2-3; J.A.18-20, 26-27.  After searching
respondent's car, Newsome found a small amount of marijuana and a pill, later
identified as methylenedioxy methamphetamine, which was the basis for
respondent's arrest and indictment under Ohio Rev. Code Ann.&#167;2925.11(A)(Supp.
1996).  Pet.App.3.</P>
<P>The trial judge denied respondent's motion to suppress the evidence found in
his car but the court of appeals reversed.  The appellate court ruled that &quot;a
reasonable person in [respondent's] position would not believe that the
investigative stop had been concluded, and that he or she was free to go, so
long as the police officer was continuing to ask investigative questions.&quot; 
Because there was no reasonable suspicion to continue detaining respondent, the
court of appeals held that the consent obtained from respondent was the fruit of
an unlawful detention.  Pet.App.17-18.</P>
<P>The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the appellate court's ruling.  The court
concluded that the search was invalid &quot;since it was the product of an
unlawful seizure.&quot;  Id. at 4.  It found that &quot;the entire chain of
events, starting when Newsome had [respondent] exit the car and stand within the
field of the video camera, was related to the questioning of [respondent] about
carrying contraband.&quot;  This questioning &quot;was not related to the
initial speeding stop and . . .  was not based on any specific or articulable
facts that would provide probable cause for the extension of the scope of the
seizure of [respondent and his passenger.]&quot;  Id. at 6-7.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">2 Newsome also questioned respondent about luggage inside
respondent's car.</FONT></P>
<P>The court explained that &quot;[m]ost people believe that they are validly
in a police officer's custody as long as the officer continues to interrogate
them.&quot;  To secure the constitutional rights of motorists seized by the
police, the court below ruled that &quot;citizens stopped for traffic offenses
be clearly informed by the detaining officer when they are free to go after a
valid detention, before an officer attempts to engage in a consensual
interrogation.  Any attempt at consensual interrogation must be preceded by the
phrase `At this time you legally are free to go' or by words of similar import.&quot;
 Id. at 9.</P>
<P>In this Court, the state and its amici contend that the court below erred in
imposing a bright-line rule for judging whether respondent's detention continued
at the time that Deputy Newsome requested and obtained consent to search the
car. Petitioner argues that a totality of the circumstances test is the correct
standard for determining whether the encounter between respondent and Newsome
was consensual vel non.</P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>This Court's cases recognize that &quot;[s]treet encounters between citizens
and police officers are incredibly rich in diversity.&quot;  Terry v. Ohio, 392
U.S. 1, 13 (1968).  Ignoring that diversity, the petitioner argues that this
case should be treated no differently than an encounter between the police and a
citizen walking down the street.  Such an encounter is deemed to be an &quot;arm's
length&quot; meeting.  Absent some restraining action by the officer, the law
presumes that the citizen is free to answer the officer's questions or walk
away, and that the average person is aware of these options and thus has not
been seized under the Fourth Amendment.</P>
<P>The court below correctly recognized that this constitutional paradigm is
inapposite when the police stop a motorist on the highway. Under these
circumstances, a seizure has unquestionably occurred.  Moreover, once a seizure
has occurred (as in respondent's case), the encounter between the police and
citizen is no longer a balanced meeting. The nature of the confrontation not
only may cause &quot;substantial anxiety&quot; for the motorist, Delaware v.
Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 657 (1979), the officer's conduct and discretion also
dictate the pace and resolution of the encounter.  Unlike the pedestrian free to
ignore an approaching officer, a motorist seized by the police is not positioned
to know the lawful limits of the officer's authority, nor the existence of his
own right to leave or terminate the seizure.  Accordingly, the totality test of
the consensual encounter cases is unsuited for judging the legality of an
officer's continued questioning of a motorist subject to police seizure.</P>
<P>This Court's cases also reveal that bright-line rules are appropriate to
delineate the constitutional boundaries of traffic stops.  Many of the Court's
affirmative rules in motorist seizure cases expand the power of the police to
advance officer safety or to provide guidance to the officer in the field.  On
the other hand, bright-line rules that restrict police authority are proper when
there is the potential for the abuse of police discretion.  The court below
correctly announced a clear rule to check the substantial discretion afforded
officers who execute traffic detentions.</P>
<P>The ruling below upholds a fundamental principle of this Court's
investigative detention cases.  The investigative practices used by officers
during traffic stops must be strictly tied to the reasons which justify the
detention.  Once the purpose for the traffic stop has been satisfied,
questioning a motorist about matters unrelated to the stop, absent just cause,
is unreasonable.  Finally, the decision below will protect the liberty, privacy
and security interests of thousands of innocent motorists who otherwise would be
delayed in their travel plans and asked to surrender the privacy of their
automobiles and luggage without good cause.</P>
<P>ARGUMENT</P>
<P>I. THE CONSENSUAL ENCOUNTER CASES REST ON THE PREMISE THAT THE ORDINARY
POLICE-CITIZEN ENCOUNTER IS AN &quot;ARM'S LENGTH&quot; MEETING.  THE REASONING
OF THOSE CASES IS INAPT WHEN AN OFFICER CONTINUES TO QUESTION A CITIZEN  SEIZED 
FOR  A  TRAFFIC  STOP</P>
<P>Fourth Amendment interests are not triggered unless a &quot;search&quot; or &quot;seizure&quot;
has occurred.  Not every encounter between an officer and a citizen is a
seizure.  This Court's cases establish that &quot;a seizure does not occur
simply because a police officer approaches an individual and asks a few
questions.&quot;  Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 434 (1991); Florida v.
Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 497-98 (1983)(plurality opinion).  If the reasonable person
would feel &quot;free to disregard the police and go about his business,&quot;
California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 628 (1991), or &quot;feel free to decline
the officers' requests or otherwise terminate the encounter,&quot; Bostick, 501
U.S. at 436, no seizure has occurred and no reasonable suspicion is required to
justify the officer's conduct.  Whether a person has been seized depends upon
the totality of the circumstances surrounding the encounter.  Id. at 439-40
(rejecting a per se rule deciding the seizure issue on the fact that the
police-citizen encounter took place on a bus); Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U.S.
567, 569 (1988)(rejecting a bright-line rule for determining whether a police
chase constitutes a seizure).</P>
<P>Thus, the police may approach a person and ask questions, INS v. Delgado,
466 U.S. 210, 216 (1984); seek to examine a person's identification or travel
documents, Bostick, 501 U.S. at 437; Delgado, 466 U.S. at 216; Royer, 460 U.S.
at 501; United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 557-58 (1980)(opinion of
Stewart, J.); pursue a pedestrian as he runs down the street, Chesternut, 486
U.S. at 576; and request consent to search a person's luggage, Bostick, 501 U.S.
at 437; Royer, 460 U.S. at 501. None of these encounters will trigger Fourth
Amendment scrutiny provided &quot;the police do not convey a message that
compliance with their requests is required.&quot;  Bostick, 501 U.S. at 435;
accord Chesternut, 486 U.S. at 574 (police chase not a seizure because it &quot;would
not have communicated to the reasonable person an attempt to capture or
otherwise intrude upon [Chesternut's] freedom of movement&quot;).</P>
<P>Although not mentioned by petitioner or its amici, all of the Court's
consensual encounter cases have a common trait:  each involved persons at
liberty to come and go as they please.  The status of the individual is crucial
because the Court has decided that, as a matter of law, the typical
police-citizen encounter will not constitute a seizure even though few persons
actually exercise their right to ignore the police.  This constitutional norm
rests on two related premises.  First, the reasonable, innocent person <SUP>3</SUP>
will normally cooperate with the police and sees the ordinary police-citizen
encounter as an &quot;arm's length&quot; meeting designed to serve the community
at-large.  Second, a contrary rule would bar many valid law enforcement
practices, particularly &quot;the need for police questioning as a tool in the
effective enforcement of the criminal laws.&quot;  Mendenhall, 446 U.S. at 554
(opinion of Stewart, J.).</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">3 The test for determining whether a seizure has occurred
is an objective standard that &quot;presupposes an innocent person.&quot; 
Bostick, 501 U.S. 501 U.S. at 438 (emphasis in original); Chesternut, 488 U.S.
at 574 (the reasonable person test is an objective standard, which &quot;ensures
that the scope of Fourth Amendment protection does not vary with the state of

mind of the particular individual being approached&quot;).  Thus, respondent's

subjective belief, elicited on cross-examination at the suppression hearing, see
J.A.29, that he was free to leave the encounter after Newsome returned his
driver's license, is not decisive. See also Hodari D., 499 U.S. at 628 (the
seizure standard &quot;is an objective one:  not whether the citizen perceived
that he was being ordered to restrict his movement, but whether the officer's
words and actions would have conveyed that to a reasonable person&quot;).</FONT></P>

<P>In contrast to the Mendenhall-Royer-Bostick line of cases, the Court has
recognized that the objective intrusion, authority of the police, and potential
for the abuse of discretionary power involved whenever a motorist is stopped and

questioned by the police, raise distinct Fourth Amendment issues.  Whenever a
police officer stops a motorist in transit, a seizure has occurred.  Stopping a

vehicle and detaining its occupants is a seizure under the Fourth Amendment &quot;even
though the purpose of the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite
brief.&quot;  Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. at 653.  A traffic stop interrupts a
motorist's &quot;freedom of movement,&quot; is annoying and time consuming, and
often generates &quot;substantial anxiety,&quot; even for the law-abiding
motorist who has not committed a crime.  Id. at 657.  Similarly, when a motorist
is stopped and questioned at a sobriety roadblock or other official checkpoint,
a seizure has occurred.  Michigan Dep't of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444,
447 (1990); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 556 (1976).</P>
<P>The authority of the police, the dynamics surrounding a traffic stop and
common sense have led this Court to declare that &quot;[c]ertainly few motorists
would feel free to either to disobey a directive to pull over or to leave the

scene of a traffic stop without being told they might do so.&quot;  Berkemer v.
McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 436 (1984).<SUP>4</SUP>  Because of the &quot;unsettling
show of authority&quot; and &quot;substantial anxiety&quot; associated with
traffic stops, Prouse, 440 U.S. at 657, police officers may not approach or
signal a motorist in transit to stop and listen to their questions as they can a
pedestrian.  &quot;Stopping or diverting an automobile in transit . . . is
materially more intrusive than a question put to a passing pedestrian, and the
fact that the former amounts to a seizure tells very little about the
constitutional status of the latter.&quot;  Mendenhall, 446 U.S. at 556-57
(opinion of Stewart, J.).</P>
<P>This Court's cases also recognize that police seizures of motorists differ
from questions put to pedestrians in another way.  Because &quot;[v]ehicle stops
for traffic violations occur countless times each day,&quot; Prouse, 440 U.S. at
659, and every motorist is subject to a &quot;multitude of applicable traffic
and equipment regulations,&quot; id. at 661, -- rules which are not applicable
to pedestrians -- police officers have substantial discretion when deciding
which motorists to stop and how each stop will be resolved.  In this case, for
example, Deputy Newsome gave respondent a verbal warning, although he could have
issued a speeding ticket.  The average motorist is aware of this discretionary
authority, which adds to the tension of the typical traffic stop.  Because an
officer might abuse his or her authority either in deciding which motorists to
stop or how those stops will be resolved, this Court has imposed constitutional
rules for motorist detentions that are not applicable to police-pedestrian
encounters.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">4 Many states have laws against resisting or fleeing from
an officer's lawful order to stop.  See, e.g., Fla.Stat. &#167;316.1935 (Supp.
1996); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &#167;2921.331 (1994); Nev.Rev.Stat.Ann. &#167;484.348
(Supp. 1995); Wash.Rev. Code &#167;46.61.021 (West Supp. 1996); 75 Pa.Cons.
Stat.Ann. &#167;3733 (West Supp. 1995).</FONT></P>
<P>For example, in Prouse, the Court ruled that a discretionary spot-check to
verify a motorist's driver's license and registration was unconstitutional.  &quot;This
kind of standardless and unconstrained discretion is the evil the Court has
discerned when in previous cases it has insisted that the discretion of the
official in the field be circumscribed, at least to some extent.&quot;  Id. at
661.  Accordingly, Prouse ruled that, absent reasonable suspicion that a
motorist has committed a traffic violation or some other offense, randomly
detaining a motorist to examine driving documents is unreasonable under the
Fourth Amendment.  Id. at 663.  See also United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422
U.S. 873 (1975)(border patrol agents may stop a vehicle near the border and
question its occupants only if there is reason to suspect that the car may
contain illegal aliens).</P>
<P>Similarly, in Sitz and Martinez-Fuerte, although the Court rejected Fourth
Amendment challenges to a sobriety checkpoint and an interior Border Patrol
permanent checkpoint, respectively, it stressed, inter alia, the standardized
procedures that governed each seizure.  In Sitz, all vehicles passing through
the sobriety checkpoint were stopped and drivers were briefly examined for signs
of intoxication.  496 U.S. at 447.  Because all drivers approaching the
checkpoint were stopped, the seizure did not afford the police the unchecked
discretion inherent in the random stops at issue in Prouse.  Sitz, 496 U.S. at
454. <SUP>5</SUP>  Likewise, in Martinez-Fuerte, the Court emphasized that
permanent checkpoints run by the Border Patrol were not as intrusive on the
motoring public as a random roving-patrol. At a fixed checkpoint, motorists &quot;are
not taken by surprise&quot; by the presence of the police.  428 U.S. at 559. 
Moreover, because of the &quot;regularized manner in which established
checkpoints are operated . . . field officers may stop only those cars passing
the checkpoint [which leaves less] room for abusive or harassing stops of
individuals than there was in the case of roving-patrol stops.&quot;  Id. <SUP>6</SUP></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">5 See 4 Wayne F. LaFave, Search And Seizure &#167;10.8(d)
at 706 (3d ed. 1996)(&quot;[T]he manner in which the [sobriety] checkpoint is
operated must be such that motorists `realize that they have been stopped as
part of a routine checkpoint operation' and not singled out&quot;)(footnote
omitted).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">6 See LaFave, supra, &#167;10.8(d) at 696 (a central theme
of Martinez-Fuerte is that &quot;a police procedure is less threatening to
Fourth Amendment values when the discretionary authority of the police (and thus
the risk of arbitrary action) is kept at an absolute minimum&quot;)(emphasis
added).</FONT></P>
<P>As the Court's cases illustrate, there are sound reasons why pedestrian
encounters and motorist seizures are controlled by different Fourth Amendment
rules.  When a citizen is approached by the police on the street, inside an
airport terminal, or while sitting on a bus, the law operates on the assumption
the person remains free to go about his or her business and ignore the officer
unless the officer indicates that compliance with his demands is required.
<SUP>7</SUP>  Simply stated, the Fourth Amendment treats the typical

police-citizen encounter as a balanced meeting:  the officer is free to question
the citizen, but the citizen is free to walk away from the officer.  The arm's
length nature of the encounter explains why the Court has repeatedly declared
that a person's refusal to cooperate with an officer does not justify, even
momentarily, a detention.  Nor does a refusal to listen or answer an officer's
inquiry provide reasonable grounds to detain.  Bostick, 501 U.S. at 437;
Delgado, 466 U.S. at 216-17; Royer, 460 U.S. at 498 (plurality opinion).</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">7 Cf. Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47 (1979)(when police have
no suspicion of criminality and appellant refused to identify himself and
angrily asserted that the police had no right to stop him, the police
unreasonably seized appellant when they detained and frisk him for
identification).</FONT></P>
<P>In contrast, a motorist seized by the police is not positioned to ignore the
officer or his questions.  Once a seizure has occurred, the encounter is no
longer balanced and the officer dictates the pace and circumstances of the
confrontation.  The atmosphere and objective intrusion of the seizure may create
fear and distress for many law-abiding motorists.  Where a police-citizen
confrontation begins in a climate of &quot;substantial anxiety,&quot; Prouse,
440 U.S. at 657, and is controlled by the discretion of the officer in the
field, the totality of the circumstances test of the consensual encounter cases
is inapt because it is designed to assess the perspective of citizens at liberty
to come and go as they please.  Unlike a person free to ignore an inquiring
officer, a motorist seized by the police is not positioned to know the lawful
limits of the officer's authority, nor the extent of the his own right to leave
or terminate the seizure. <SUP>8</SUP></P>
<P>The claim pressed by the dissent of Justice Sweeney below, Pet.App.13-14,
that this case turns entirely on the issue of consent, is plainly wrong.  The
issue of whether respondent was lawfully &quot;seized&quot; at the time Deputy
Newsome requested consent to search is a distinct question from whether he
validly &quot;consented&quot; to the search.  Because respondent was unlawfully
seized at the time he gave consent to search, the validity of the search turns
on whether the consent has been purged of the taint of the illegal seizure.
<SUP>9</SUP>  That determination requires the consideration of three factors: 
the temporal proximity of the illegal seizure and the consent; the presence of
intervening circumstances; and the purpose and flagrancy of the official
misconduct.  Taylor v. Alabama, 457 U.S. 687, 690 (1982), quoting Brown v.
Illinois, 422 U.S. 590, 603-04 (1975).  The prosecution bears the burden of
proving that evidence obtained as a direct result of an illegal seizure is
admissible.  Id.</P>

590, 601-02 (1975)] hold that statements given during a period of illegal
detention are inadmissible even though voluntarily given if they are the product
of the illegal detention and not the result of an independent act of free will&quot;);
see also Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434 (noting that if a seizure took place without
reasonable suspicion, drugs found in Bostick's suitcase after a consent search &quot;must
be suppressed as tainted fruit&quot;); id. at 447 (Marshall, J., dissenting)(If
a person &quot;was unlawfully seized when the officers approached him and
initiated questioning, the resulting search was likewise unlawful no matter how
well advised [the person] was of his right to refuse it&quot;).</FONT></P>
<P>Here, the continued illegal detention of respondent and the consent to
search were intimately connected in time and circumstance.  Respondent gave
consent instantly; the continued illegal detention and consent were
hand-in-glove.  As the court below concluded:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[T]here was no time lapse between the illegal detention and the request to
search, nor were there any circumstances that might have served to break or
weaken the connection between one and the other.  The sole purpose of the
continued detention was to illegally broaden the scope of the original
detention.  [Respondent's] consent clearly was the result of his illegal
detention, and was not the result of an act of will on his part.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Pet.App.7.  Put simply, there was no &quot;demonstrably effective break in
the chain of events leading from the illegal [seizure] to the [consent].&quot; 
Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. at 611 (Powell, J., concurring in part).  This case
therefore is easily distinguishable from Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218
(1973).  In Bustamonte, the Court held that a consent search may still be
constitutional even though an officer failed to inform a person of their right
to refuse such a search.  Id. at 248-49.</P>
<P>Here, respondent's claim is that his consent invalid because it was
inextricably tied to his illegal detention.</P>
<P>II.  BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE OBJECTIVE INTRUSION AND THE RISKS AND
INTERESTS INVOLVED FOR BOTH THE OFFICER AND MOTORIST, BRIGHT-LINE RULES DO
CONTROL MOTORIST SEIZURES</P>
<P>Due to the attendant circumstances and interests at stake for both the
officer and the motorist, this Court has adopted bright-line rules to outline
the initiation and permissible scope of motorist detentions.  The ruling below
fits neatly within the framework of the Court's prior motorist seizure cases.</P>
<P>&quot;Bright-line fourth amendment rules come in two forms.&quot;  Albert W.
Alschuler, &quot;Bright Line Fever and the Fourth Amendment,&quot; 45
U.Pitt.L.Rev. 227, 242 (1984).  Many of this Court's bright-line rules expand
the power of the police during motorist detentions, while other bright-line
rules check the discretion of the police.  Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106
(1977)(per curiam), is an example of the former category.  Mimms held that an
officer may exercise discretion to order a driver, validly stopped for a traffic
violation, to exit his or her vehicle even absent any particularized suspicion
that the driver is presently armed and dangerous.  This bright-line rule was
justified by the twin rationales of officer safety and the minimal intrusion
involved for the motorist who has already been lawfully seized.  Id. at 110-11.</P>
<P>Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032 (1983), and New York v. Class, 475 U.S. 106
(1986), are additional examples of categorical rules articulated by the Court
that expand the authority of the police during traffic stops.  In Long, officers
on patrol in a rural area observed Long's car travelling erratically and
speeding.  After the officers saw the car drive into a ditch, they stopped to
investigate.  When Long, who appeared to be intoxicated, headed toward his car
to produce his vehicle registration, the officers followed and observed a large
hunting knife inside the car.  After a frisk of Long's person revealed no
weapons, an officer searched the inside of the car for other weapons.  The
search revealed a quantity of marijuana.  463 U.S. at 1034.</P>
<P>Prior to Long, the Court had not approved an investigative search of a car
without probable cause to believe that contraband or evidence of a crime was
within the vehicle.  Yet, Long held that a protective search of the passenger
compartment is permissible when police have a reasonable belief that an occupant
of a car is dangerous and may gain immediate control of weapons.  Id. at 1050. 
This expansion of police authority was justified by the recognition that
motorist seizures &quot;are especially fraught with danger to police officers,&quot;
and that &quot;suspects may injure police officers and others by virtue of their
access to weapons, even though they may not themselves be armed.&quot;  Id.
<SUP>10</SUP></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">10 While Long noted that its ruling &quot;does not mean
that police may conduct automobile searches whenever they conduct an
investigative stop,&quot; 463 U.S. at 1050, n.14 (emphasis in original), they
are free to do so when they have &quot;the level of suspicion identified in
Terry.&quot;  Id.</FONT></P>
<P>In New York v. Class, 475 U.S. 106, the question before the Court was
whether &quot;a police officer may reach into the passenger compartment of a
vehicle to move papers obscuring the VIN [Vehicle Identification Number] after
its driver has been stopped for a traffic violation and has exited the car.&quot;
 Id. at 107.  In Class it was &quot;undisputed that the police officers had no
reason to suspect that [Class'] car was stolen, that it contained contraband, or
that [Class] had committed an offense other than the traffic violations.&quot; 
Id. at 108.  And the Class Court recognized that an officer's reaching into a
car to move the papers covering the VIN was a search under the Fourth Amendment.
 Id. at 111.</P>
<P>Despite the absence of probable cause justifying a search, the Class Court
ruled that the search of the Class' vehicle was reasonable.  Relying on the
reasoning of Mimms, the Court identified three factors that made the search
constitutional:  the search promoted the safety of the officers; the search was
minimally intrusive; and the search stemmed from directly observing Class commit
a traffic violation.  Id. at 115.  Consequently, a police search may be &quot;piggy-backed&quot;
onto a traffic stop whenever there is a need to move objects obscuring the VIN.</P>
<P>Finally, in New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454 (1981), an officer stopped a
car for speeding.  While requesting identification from the occupants of the
vehicle, the officer smelled the odor of burnt marijuana.  After ordering the
occupants out of the car, the officer searched the passenger compartment,
including the pocket of a jacket belonging to Belton.  Inside the pocket was
cocaine.  The search raised an issue that had generated conflicting results in
the lower courts, namely, the proper scope of a search of the interior of a car
incident to a lawful arrest of its occupants.</P>
<P>Emphasizing the need for a bright-line rule to guide to officers in the
field, Belton ruled that &quot;when a policeman has made a lawful custodial
arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident
of that arrest, search the passenger compartment [and any closed containers
therein] of that automobile.&quot;  Id. at 460 (footnote omitted).  The ruling
in Belton, like the definitive rulings in Mimms, Long and Class, augmented the
power of officers conducting traffic detentions.</P>
<P>In comparison to the affirmative rules discussed above which extend police
power, bright-lines sometimes work to check police discretion.  As noted, the
result in Prouse is a classic example of a peremptory rule that reduces the
power to search and seize.  When there is a &quot;`grave danger' of abuse of
discretion,&quot; 440 U.S. at 662, the Prouse Court reaffirmed that categorical
rules are necessary to check the discretion of officers who might use their
authority to undermine Fourth Amendment interests. <SUP>11</SUP>  The same
concerns are extant in this case.</P>
<P>Every law-abiding motorist will sometime commit a traffic violation.  As
Justice Stevens has properly noted, &quot;to be law abiding is not necessarily
to be spotless, and even the most virtuous can be unlucky.&quot;  Sitz, 496 U.S.
at 465 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Thus, even the most innocent motorist faces
the likelihood of being seized for a traffic violation.  When such a seizure
occurs, the officer not only controls the pace and scope of the seizure, <SUP>12</SUP>
the officer also retains substantial discretion in deciding how and when the
seizure will end.  The ruling below announces a sensible and easily administered
safeguard to restrain the considerable discretion held by officers during
traffic stops.</P>

<P>Just as this Court acknowledged few motorists would feel free to disobey a
police signal to stop or to depart the scene of a traffic stop &quot;without
being told they might do so,&quot; Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. at 436, the
court below wisely concluded that an equally small number of motorists will be
aware of the legal limits of an officer's authority during a traffic seizure:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Most [motorists] believe that they are validly in a police officer's custody
as long as the officer continues to interrogate them.  The police officer
retains the upper hand and the accouterments of authority.  That the officer
lacks legal license to continue to detain them is unknown to most citizens, and
a reasonable person [who has been seized for a traffic violation] would not feel
free to walk away as the officer continues to address him.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CITE>Pet.App.9.</CITE></P>
<P>The consequence of the petitioner's position is manifest:  according to
petitioner, officers should be afforded the discretion to continue questioning
otherwise innocent motorists about matters unrelated to a traffic stop even when
there is no reasonable suspicion to justify continuing the seizure.  The fact
that many thousands of innocent motorists will be subjected to this police
power, or will not object to officer's search of their cars, <SUP>13</SUP> is
beside the point.  As Justice O'Connor declared last Term, &quot;evenhanded
treatment [is] no substitute for the individualized suspicion requirement.&quot;
 Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S.    ,    , 115 S.Ct. 2386, 2398
(1995)(dissenting opinion).  &quot;Protection of privacy, not evenhandness, was
[for the Framers] and is now the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment.&quot;  Id.
at 2399.</P>
<P>In sum, a review of this Court's motorist seizure cases indicates that
bright-line rules which expand police power to search and seize are often
appropriate constitutional norms to promote officer safety and provide guidance
to officers in the field.  But bright-line rules cut both ways.  This Court's
cases equally reveal that definitive rules which restrain police power are
proper where there is the potential for the abuse of police discretion.  The
court below properly announced a clear rule to control the discretion of the
officer in the field, &quot;at least to some extent.&quot;  Prouse, 440 U.S. at
661.  A contrary ruling -- to allow an officer to continue questioning an
innocent motorist about matters unrelated to the traffic stop when there is no
cause for such interrogation -- sanctions the very evil condemned in Prouse.

<P>III.  THE INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES OF THE POLICE DURING TRAFFIC STOPS MUST
BE STRICTLY TIED TO THE REASONS WHICH JUSTIFY THE DETENTION.  ONCE THE PURPOSE
FOR THE TRAFFIC STOP HAS BEEN SATISFIED, CONTINUED QUESTIONING OF MOTORISTS
ABOUT MATTERS UNRELATED TO THE STOP, ABSENT JUST CAUSE, IS UNREASONABLE</P>
<P>When considering challenges to police intrusions that occur in the context
of a motorist detention, the Court has always looked to the reasonableness
component of the Fourth Amendment.  As stated in Prouse, 440 U.S. at 654, &quot;the
permissibility of a particular law enforcement practice is judged by balancing
its intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against its
promotion of legitimate governmental interests.&quot;  Traditionally, the
reasonableness standard demands, &quot;at a minimum,&quot; that intrusions by
the police &quot;be capable of measurement against `an objective standard,'
whether this be probable cause or a less stringent test [of suspicion].&quot; 
Id. (footnotes omitted); Acton, 115 S.Ct. at 2402 (O'Connor, J., dissenting)(&quot;history
and precedent establish that individualized suspicion is `usually required'
under the Fourth Amendment (regardless of whether a warrant and probable cause
are also required)&quot;).</P>
<P>The definitive statement of the Fourth Amendment's objective standard for
judging the legality of intrusions falling short of an arrest or full search was
announced in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. at 19-20:  &quot;[I]n determining whether
the seizure and search were `unreasonable' our inquiry is a dual one -- whether
the officer's actions was justified at its inception, and whether it was
reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the
interference in the first place.&quot;  The ruling below, which requires an
officer to signal the termination of the stop before continuing to question a
motorist about matters outside of the scope of the valid detention, sustains the
principles required by this Court's rulings for evaluating the legality of
motorist seizures.</P>
<P>Motorists enjoy significant interests in automobile travel that are
protected by the Fourth Amendment.  Prouse, 440 U.S. at 662-63.  Where, however,
an officer has reasonable grounds that a traffic violation or other offense is
in progress, a limited detention is proper.  Under this Court's precedents,
while the police are not necessarily required to utilize the &quot;least
restrictive means&quot; available in completing an investigative stop, <SUP>15</SUP>
they must ensure that the stop &quot;be temporary and last no longer than
necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.&quot;  Royer, 460 U.S. at 500
(plurality opinion); accord, Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. at 881 (&quot;the stop and
inquiry must be `reasonably related in scope to the justification for their
initiation'&quot;), quoting Terry, 392 U.S.29; cf. Sharpe, 470 U.S. at 685-86
(investigative detention of motorist must be brief and police must diligently
pursue a means of investigation that will likely confirm or dispel their
suspicions quickly).</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">15 See United States v. Sharpe, 470 U.S. 675, 687 (1985).</FONT></P>
<P>The ruling below advances the constitutional command required of all
temporary seizures, including traffic stops, that an officer's investigative
practices &quot;must be `strictly tied to and justified by' the circumstances
which render its initiation permissible.&quot;  Terry, 392 U.S. at 19 (citations
omitted).  Indeed, the decision below follows a long line of lower court rulings
that have held that the police, in the context of a valid traffic stop, may not
question a motorist about matters unrelated to the traffic stop, unless there is
independent cause for such questioning. <SUP>16</SUP></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">16 See, e.g., United States v. McSwain, 29 F.3d 558 (10th
Cir. 1994) (once trooper realized that reasons for traffic stop were
unwarranted, the stop should have terminated and trooper's questions and request
for driver's license of motorist violated the Fourth Amendment); United States
v. Walker, 933 F.2d 812, 817 (10th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 1168
(1992)(holding that when a defendant, stopped for speeding, established to the
police officer that he had a license and was entitled to operate the vehicle,
the officer's further detention for questioning about guns and drugs was
illegal); United States v. Thomas, 863 F.2d 622, 628-629 (9th Cir. 1988)(where
suspect at a traffic stop had satisfied the reasonable suspicion giving rise to
the stop, continued detention for questioning about a gun was illegal); United
States v. Ramos, 42 F.3d 1160, 1163 (8th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct.
2015 (1995)(stating that, if the driver provides no inconsistent answers and no
objective circumstances supply a police officer with additional suspicion, the
officer should not expand the scope of the stop); State v. Washington, 623 So.
2d 392, 397 (Ala.Crim.App. 1993)(once the defendant signed his speeding ticket,
he should have been released by the detaining officer absent further reasonable
suspicion; further questioning quickly evolved into an illegal detention);
United States v. Obasa, 15 F.3d 603, 607 (6th Cir. 1994)(holding that once the
circumstances giving rise to a stop are resolved, the detainee must be
released); Colorado v. Redinger, 906 P.2d 81 (Col.Sup.Ct. 1995)(&quot;[w]hen . .
. the purpose for which the investigatory [traffic] stop was instituted has been
accomplished and no other reasonable suspicion exists to support further
investigation, there is no justification for continued detention and
interrogation of citizens&quot;)(footnote omitted); and United States v. Kelley,
981 F.2d 1464, 1470 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 2427 (1993)(asserting
agreement with the Tenth Circuit that &quot;extensive questioning about matters
wholly unrelated to the purpose of a routine traffic stop may violate the Fourth
Amendment&quot;)(dicta).  See also LaFave, supra, &#167;9.2(f) at 53, n.143 &amp;
61-62 (&quot;[I]f a person is stopped on suspicion that he has just engaged in
criminal activity, but the suspect identifies himself satisfactorily and
investigation establishes that no offense has occurred, there is no basis for
further detention, and the suspect must be released&quot;).<BR><BR>Concerning
petitioner's claim that a motorist in respondent's shoes is no longer subject to
seizure after his driver's license has been returned, Professor LaFave has
reasoned as follows:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">T[his] conclusion is hard to swallow.  Given the fact that
[a motorist] quite clearly ha[s] been seized when his car was pulled over, the
return of [his driving papers] hardly manifests a change in status when it was
immediately followed by interrogation concerning other criminal activity.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">LaFave, supra, &#167;9.3(a) at 112 (footnote omitted).</FONT></P>
<P>The position of petitioner conflicts with the demands of this Court's Fourth
Amendment holdings that investigative seizures be &quot;strictly circumscribed
by the exigencies which justify its initiation.&quot;  Terry, 392 U.S. at 26. 
When the police have reasonable suspicion (but not probable cause) of criminal
activity, the balancing formula used by the Court provides sufficient
flexibility for an officer to conduct her investigation in a manner that is &quot;likely
to confirm or dispel their suspicions quickly, during which time it was
necessary to detain the defendant.&quot;  Sharpe, 470 U.S. at 686.  When an
officer is &quot;diligently pursu[ing]&quot; her investigation, United States v.
Place, 462 U.S. 696, 709 (1983), this Court will not subject an officer's
conduct to &quot;unrealistic second-guessing&quot; on alternative means of
investigation.  Sharpe, 470 U.S. at 686-87.</P>
<P>On the other hand, when the reasons for commencing the investigation have
been satisfied, further intrusions and interrogation are unreasonable.  In the
context of a traffic stop, once the purpose for the stop has been fulfilled and
no additional grounds for continuing the seizure exist, questioning a motorist
about matters unrelated to the stop violates the cardinal rule that an officer's
conduct be &quot;reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which
justified the interference in the first place.&quot;  Terry, 392 U.S. at 20.</P>
<P>Here, once Deputy Newsome had determined that respondent was lawfully on the
road and would be issued a verbal warning for speeding, the purposes for
stopping respondent were completed.  Instead of terminating the seizure at this
point, and without any suspicion of criminality, Newsome continued his &quot;routine&quot;
of questioning respondent about guns and contraband. <SUP>17</SUP>  There was
no nexus between this questioning and the reasons for stopping respondent.  It
was, as the court below correctly observed, &quot;a fishing expedition for
unrelated criminal activity.&quot;  Pet.App.10.  Newsome's questions were not
justified by a reasonable belief that contraband was inside respondent's
vehicle.  Rather, they were part of a carefully scripted routine designed to
exploit the vulnerable status of a motorist subjected to a police seizure. 
Accordingly, Deputy Newsome's conduct exceeded the permissible bounds of a valid

traffic stop.  Once the purposes for the stop were satisfied, any further
interrogation of respondent, absent reasonable cause, was an unlawful and
arbitrary continuation of respondent's seizure and thus unreasonable under this
Court's precedents. <SUP>18</SUP></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">17 Deputy Newsome testified at the suppression hearing that
it was his routine practice to ask permission to search a motorist's car during
traffic stops.  J.A.22. The appellate court below was obviously aware of
Newsome's &quot;routine.&quot;  See Pet.App.18, citing Ohio v. Retherford, 639
N.E.2d 498, 503 (Ohio Ct.App. 1994).  In Retherford, the court stated:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">As a result of Deputy Newsome's testimony in this case, and
of testimony in other cases currently pending before this court, it has become
clear to us that some police agencies in Ohio are instructing their officers to
routinely ask for the consent of individuals stopped for traffic violations to
search their vehicles and its contents for drugs, weapons, or large sums of
money, even when the officer has little or no suspicion that the occupants of
the vehicle are engaged in criminal activity whatsoever, or that the vehicle
itself contains any contraband (footnote omitted).</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">18 The Solicitor General, as amicus curiae, claims that the
ruling below imposes a &quot;burdensome and mechanical requirement of formal
notification upon law enforcement officers.&quot;  Brief for the United States
at 23 (footnote omitted).  This is a surprising statement for at least two
reasons. First, the requirement of notifying a motorist that the seizure is over
is certainly no more &quot;burdensome&quot; or &quot;mechanical&quot; than the
self-described &quot;technique&quot; that Deputy Newsome uses whenever he makes
a traffic stop. See Ohio v. Retherford, 639 N.E.2d at 502:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">[W]hen asked why he felt the need to ask Retherford for her
consent to search her vehicle, Deputy Newsome replied, &quot;[m]ore so for any
other reason the fact that I need the practice, to be quite honest.&quot; 
Deputy Newsome further testified that, in 1992 alone, he asked for consent to
search a vehicle incident to a traffic stop &quot;approximately 786 times . . .
give or take a few.&quot;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Second, the requirement of notification will only be &quot;burdensome&quot;
when officers want to question a motorist, who is otherwise constitutionally

entitled to depart the scene, about matters unrelated to the officer's seizure

of the motorist.  If an officer's conduct and inquiries are reasonably related

to the purposes of the stop -- in other words, if the officer obeys the holdings
of this Court's precedents -- there will be no additional or &quot;burdensome&quot;
notification requirements because the seizure will have been terminated and no
arbitrary questions about drugs, guns or contraband will be asked unless there
is good reason for such questions.</P>
<P>IV.  THE RULING BELOW WILL PROTECT THE PRIVACY, LIBERTY AND SECURITY
INTERESTS OF MILLIONS OF INNOCENT MOTORISTS WHO OTHERWISE WOULD BE DELAYED IN
THEIR TRAVEL PLANS AND ASKED TO SURRENDER THE PRIVACY OF THEIR AUTOMOBILES AND
LUGGAGE WITHOUT  GOOD  CAUSE</P>
<P>Petitioner and its amici suggest that the ruling below is without
constitutional basis and imposes a rigid, unnecessary burden on law enforcement
officers.  In their view, a notification requirement serves no legitimate Fourth
Amendment interests.</P>
<P>This assessment is gravely mistaken.  The ruling below will help discourage
what many innocent motorists have already experienced -- an arbitrary,
suspicionless accusation and intrusion.</P>
<P>One Ohio appellate court that reviewed the testimony of Deputy Newsome and
other law enforcement officers describing how and why they request consent to
search the vehicles of motorists stopped for routine traffic violations did not
mince words when it commented:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What is obviously troubling about these cases is that hundreds, and perhaps
thousands of Ohio citizens are being routinely delayed in their travel and asked
to relinquish to uniformed police officers their right to privacy in their
automobiles and luggage, sometimes for no better reason than to provide an
officer the opportunity to &quot;practice&quot; his drug interdiction technique.
 While we recognize the importance of drug interdiction, we are shocked by what
we believe to be an unjustified and egregious intrusion upon the privacy rights
of the citizens of Ohio.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Ohio v. Retherford, 639 N.E.2d at 503-04.  The citizens of Ohio are not the
only innocent motorists who have been subjected to a capricious police practice.
 Instances of innocent motorists being stopped for minor traffic violations and
subjected to police accusation, questioning and search extending far beyond
constitutional limits are easy to find:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>George Karnes, [a business man from California was stopped outside
Allentown, Pa. for speeding.  After issuing a ticket, Trooper Thomas Skrutski]
asked to search [Karnes'] car, but Karnes said no . . . . But the trooper didn't
let Karnes go. He called K-9 officer Edward Kowalski, who arrived with his drug
detection dog about 20 minutes later . . . . [Kowalski] also asked Karnes to
allow a search.  But Karnes refused, so Kowalski brought out his drug dog. 
Twice the dog sniffed its way around the car, detecting no drugs.  Finally --
two and a half hours after the initial stop -- the troopers let Karnes go.
<SUP>19</SUP></P>
<P>In Maryland . . . Trooper Hughes pulled over a rental car that he said was
speeding [on] Interstate 68. The car carried four black men on their way back
from a relative's funeral in Chicago to Washington, D.C.  When Hughes asked to
search the car, [an occupant] identified himself as a Washington, D.C. public
defender who was trying to make a 9:30 a.m. court appearance . . . . Denied
permission [to search], the trooper detained the men for nearly an hour while a
drug-sniffing dog was summoned.  The dog found nothing, and the men were sent on
their way with a $105 speeding ticket. <SUP>20</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Police videotapes of roadside searches by sheriff deputies of Volusia
County, Florida reveal what many innocent motorists have experienced after being
stopped for traffic violations that rarely result in tickets being issued:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The tapes revealed a pattern -- one that fairly represents procedures used
on the interstate -- in which deputies stop minority motorists for flimsy
reasons, then trick them or coerce them into allowing their vehicles to be
searched.</P>
<P>Deputies set up the motorists by using a subtle but sophisticated -- and
effective -- psychological tool. They question them in friendly, conversational
tones:  Where is the motorist going? Where has the motorist been? Whom is the
motorist visiting?</P>
<P>After telling them they can leave, the deputies suddenly ask if they are
carrying drugs, weapons or explosives and whether they will consent to a search.</P>
<P>Most people want to cooperate with police -- either out of fear or respect. 
Their inclination is to allow cops to search their vehicles . . . . [One
motorist], who is black, calmly answered the officer's questions.  There was no
obvious reason to suspect her as a drug dealer and no legitimate reason to
search her car.  The deputy lectured her on the proper use of the emergency lane
and told her she was free to go.  Then he pulled that oh-by-the-way routine and
searched her car.  [No drugs or cash were found] . . . .</P>
<P>Motorists who stand up for their rights and refuse permission to search,
still are detained by deputies.  [Another police tape] showed a video in which a
security guard, who is black, refused a deputy's request to search his car.  The
deputy called for a police dog that &quot;alerted&quot; to drugs and the car was
searched. No drugs or cash were found. <SUP>21</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Although officers often seek consent searches as a part of their &quot;routine&quot;
practice or &quot;technique,&quot; the experience for the innocent motorist is
no routine matter.  A consent search by a Maryland state trooper of a car
stopped for speeding went as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Using a screwdriver and a flashlight, [the trooper] loosened door
panels, raised the dashboard, looked into the exhaust pipe, checked the spare
tire and inspected under the hood . . . . [The search] took about 30 minutes. 
[The trooper] found nothing and then called for a trained German shepherd to
sniff around.  It too found nothing.&quot; <SUP>22</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Even those who agree to let police search their car may be in for more than
they expected.  Craig Kirby, a 30-year-old Alabama textile worker, was stopped
in July 1990 as he drove on I-10 through Jefferson Davis Parish in southwestern
Louisiana.  When the officer asked him whether he could search the car, Kirby
said:  &quot;Fine.&quot;  The next thing he knew, Kirby was spread-eagled
against the side of his car.  The officer searched his luggage and trunk and
looked under his hood and dashboard.  But the search didn't stop there.  The
officer, Kirby said, made him drive to a gas station, where he had mechanics
take apart his spare tire.  The officers also disassembled his seats, he said. 
They found no drugs and told Kirby he was free to go.  The ordeal lasted an hour
and a half. <SUP>23</SUP></P>

<P>Members of this Court have expressed strong disapproval of suspicionless
intrusions that may affect thousands or millions of innocent persons.  This
Court has also acknowledged that many citizens &quot;find a greater sense of
security and privacy in traveling in an automobile than they do in exposing
themselves by pedestrian or other modes of travel.&quot;  Prouse, 440 U.S. at
662.  If petitioner prevails, millions of innocent travelers may experience,
subject to the discretion of the officer in the field, an arbitrary police &quot;technique&quot;
that threatens their liberty, privacy, and security every time their vehicle is
stopped for a traffic infraction.  That result cannot be reconciled with the
Fourth Amendment's &quot;most basic, categorical protection:  its strong
preference for an individualized suspicion requirement, with its accompanying
antipathy toward personally intrusive, blanket searches of mostly innocent
people.&quot;  Acton, 115 S.Ct. at 2404 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">24 Acton, 115 S.Ct. at 2403 (O'Connor, J., dissenting)(&quot;[A]
suspicion-based search regime is not just any less intrusive alternative; the
individualized suspicion requirement has a legal pedigree as old as the Fourth
Amendment itself, and it may not be easily cast aside in the name of policy
considerations&quot;); Mimms, 434 U.S. at 122 (Stevens, J., dissenting)(&quot;[T]o
eliminate any requirement that an officer be able to explain the reasons for his
actions signals an abandonment of effective judicial supervision of this kind of
seizure and leaves police discretion utterly without limits.  Some citizens will
be subjected to this minor indignity while others -- perhaps those with more
expansive cars, or different bumper stickers, or different-colored skin -- may
escape it entirely&quot;); cf. Illinois v. Krull, 480 U.S. 340, 365
(1987)(O'Connor, J., dissenting) (noting a significant difference between an
invalid search warrant that targets only one person and a legislature's illegal
authorization of suspicionless searches that &quot;may affect thousands or
millions and will almost always affect more than one&quot;).</FONT></P>

<P>CONCLUSION</P>
<HR>
<P>INTEREST OF AMICI <SUP>1</SUP></P>
<P>The American Civil Liberties Union (&quot;ACLU&quot;) is a nationwide,
nonpartisan, nonprofit organization with nearly 300,000 members dedicated to the
principles of individual liberty embodied in the Bill of Rights.  The New York
Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) is one of its statewide affiliates.</P>
<P>The ACLU was founded in 1920.  For more than 75 years, it has steadfastly
defended the First Amendment rights of unpopular speakers and has appeared
before this Court in numerous First Amendment cases arguing against unjustified
restrictions on speech.  Most notably, the ACLU served as counsel in Hague v.
CIO, 307 U.S. 496, 515 (1939), which first articulated the principle that &quot;[w]herever
the title of streets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in
trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for
purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing
public questions.&quot;</P>
<P>For more than three decades, the ACLU has also been in the forefront of the
battle for reproductive rights.  In 1971, the ACLU served as counsel in United
States v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. 62 (1971), the first abortion case argued in this
Court.  Three years later, the ACLU established its Reproductive Freedom
Project.  Since then, the ACLU has participated in virtually every major
abortion case in this Court either as direct counsel or as amicus curiae.</P>
<P>This case, of course, involves the right to protest outside abortion
clinics.  It has therefore been cast by some as a clash between the First
Amendment and reproductive rights.  The ACLU believes that dichotomy is a false
one and that the proper resolution of the case must preserve both rights.  To
that end, we respectfully submit this brief in the hope of assisting the Court
in drawing the proper constitutional lines.</P>

injunctive relief entered here narrowly and properly restricts the conduct of
parties who have repeatedly harassed and violated the rights of patients and
clinic workers, while leaving those parties ample avenues for free expression.</P>
<P>INTRODUCTION</P>
<P>This case arose following a series of mass blockades at reproductive health
care facilities in upstate New York.<SUP>2</SUP>  Petitioners do not defend the
legality of those blockades.  Nor do they defend their right to physically
obstruct, harass, or intimidate medical patients and staff.  Instead,
petitioners would like to recharacterize their conduct in more traditional First
Amendment terms.  The record, however, contains numerous instances of these
illegal activities, as both lower courts found.</P>
<P>Petitioners nonetheless challenge two provisions of a preliminary injunction
that was issued by the district court only after lengthy hearings clearly
demonstrated that an earlier temporary restraining order had failed to prevent
the very activities that petitioners now concede are illegal.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">2 These facilities are sometimes referred to in the briefs
as abortion clinics.  In fact, several of the facilities offer comprehensive
medical services.  For example, plaintiff Alexander Women's Group is located
inside Genesee Hospital, a full service acute care hospital in Rochester, New
York.</FONT></P>
<P>The first provision prohibits demonstrations within 15 feet of the doorway
or driveway of designated reproductive health care facilities, and of persons or
vehicles entering or leaving those facilities.  The second provision authorizes
two &quot;sidewalk counselors&quot; to enter this &quot;buffer zone&quot; and
engage in face-to-face communication with any person they choose.  But, if the
person they are addressing indicates a desire to be left alone, the &quot;sidewalk
counselors&quot; must &quot;cease and desist&quot; and rejoin the other
demonstrators 15 feet away.<SUP>3</SUP></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">3 The full text of the preliminary injunction is set out as
an appendix to the district court opinion.  Pro-Choice Network of Western New
York v. Project Rescue Western New York, 799 F.Supp. 1417, 1440-41 (W.D. N.Y.
1992)(&quot;Pro-Choice I&quot;).  The first challenged provision is &#167;1(b)
of the injunction; the second is &#167;1(c).</FONT></P>
<P>Petitioners contend that these provisions violate the First Amendment yet
ignore the extensive factual record of obstruction, harassment and intimidation
that made this injunction necessary.  This Court should not be misled by that
tactic.  The First Amendment issues raised by this case cannot be resolved in a
vacuum.  To the contrary, a careful review of the facts is indispensable
precisely because of the important First Amendment principles that petitioners
have invoked.</P>
<P>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</P>
<P>The plaintiffs in this case include several doctors, a pro-choice
organization, and a group of health care providers who offer family planning,
gynecological, and abortion services at their health care facilities, which are
primarily located in Buffalo and Rochester, New York.  Plaintiffs filed their
complaint on September 24, 1990, and simultaneously sought a temporary

restraining order against a planned blockade that defendants had announced for
September 28.  Each of the individual named defendants had previously been
arrested for illegal activities at one or more of plaintiffs' facilities.<SUP>4</SUP></P>
<P>On September 26, 1990, the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing,
and on September 27 issued the requested TRO.  The TRO enjoined defendants from
blockading plaintiffs' facilities and from &quot;physically abusing or
tortiously harassing&quot; people entering or leaving those facilities.  It also
contained &quot;buffer zone&quot; and &quot;cease and desist&quot; provisions
that were later modified at the preliminary injunction stage in response to
evidence of inadequacies in the original order and that, as modified, are now
before this Court.</P>
<P>Specifically, the TRO barred demonstrations within 15 feet of any person
entering or leaving an abortion facility but did not create a buffer zone around
the entrances or driveways of those facilities.  Similarly, it allowed &quot;sidewalk
counseling&quot; by two defendants subject to a cease and desist provision if
the person being counseled &quot;want[ed] to leave, or walk away.&quot;  It did
not, however, specify how far the &quot;sidewalk counselors&quot; must then back
off.<SUP>5</SUP></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">4 For example, Paul Schenck, one of two petitioners in this
Court, was arrested and convicted on three occasions.  One of those convictions
was for chaining himself to other named defendants inside a Buffalo abortion
facility.  See Second Amended Complaint, &#182;17.  The second petitioner in
this Court, Dwight Saunders, was arrested and convicted for participating in a
1989 blockade at another Buffalo abortion facility.  Id. at &#182;20.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">5 The full text of the TRO is set out in the Second
Circuit's en banc opinion.  Pro-Choice Network v. Schenck, 67 F.3d 377, 382 n.1
(2d Cir. 1995)(&quot;Schenck&quot;).</FONT></P>
<P>Defendants initially complied with the TRO and conducted a peaceful
demonstration rather than a blockade on September 28, 1990.  Unfortunately,
defendants' compliance with the TRO lasted only about a month.<SUP>6 </SUP>
While they did not resume their earlier blockading tactics, defendants again
began to congregate in the entrances and driveways of abortion facilities in
large numbers, preventing automobiles from entering or in some cases even
finding the driveways.  They also, in the guise of &quot;sidewalk counseling,&quot;
surrounded and harassed people entering and leaving the facilities.<SUP>7</SUP></P>
<P>The preliminary injunction hearing spanned 11 days in March and April 1991. 
In granting the injunction, the district court considered additional evidence
introduced at five contempt hearings held in 1991.  Based on this evidence, the
district court found that defendants were continuing to engage in what the
district court described as &quot;constructive blockades.&quot;  Although
defendants no longer barricaded entrances or chained themselves inside abortion
clinics, they still crowded cars, screamed, pushed, grabbed, and generally &quot;forc[ed]
patients to run a gauntlet of harassment and intimidation in the hope that the
patients [would] turn away before entering&quot; plaintiffs' clinics. 
Pro-Choice I, 799 F.Supp. at 1424.<SUP>8</SUP></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">6 Defendants consented to a continuation of the TRO pending
a final decision on plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion.  Pro-Choice I,
799 F.Supp. at 1423.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">7 The resumption of these activities is described in the
testimony of several witnesses during the preliminary injunction hearing.  See,
e.g., Tr. 64-66 (Helen Dalley); Tr.177-78 (Deborah Warnes); Tr.283, 357
(Elizabeth Sholes); Tr.540 (Marilyn Buckham).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">8 It is abundantly clear in both the district court
opinion, Pro-Choice I, 799 F.Supp. at 1424, and the Second Circuit's en banc
opinion, Schenck, 67 F.3d at 383, that the term &quot;constructive blockade&quot;
refers to physically aggressive and constitutionally unprotected conduct of the
sort described above.  It does not refer to the persuasiveness or effectiveness
of petitioners' constitutionally protected speech.  In that sense, the term &quot;constructive
blockade&quot; is an unfortunate one.  Obstruction, harassment and intimidation
can be characterized as a &quot;constructive blockade&quot; only in comparison
to defendants' even more extreme activities that literally shut the clinics
down.</FONT></P>
<P>According to the district court, &quot;[d]emonstrators frequently and
routinely congregate[d] in or near the driveway entrances to the facility
parking lots in order to impede and obstruct access to the facilities.&quot; 
Id.  They &quot;crowd[ed] around people trying to enter the facilities in an
intimidating and obstructing manner, and grab[bed], push[ed] and shove[d] the
patients, patient escorts and staff.&quot;  Id.  In addition, the district court
found that &quot;sidewalk counselors&quot; &quot;harass[ed], badger[ed],
intimidat[ed] and yell[ed] at the patients and patient escorts in order to
dissuade them from entering&quot; the clinics.  Id. at 1425.  Moreover, they &quot;continue[d]
to do so even after the patients and patient escorts signal[led] their desire to
be left alone.&quot;  Id.<SUP>9</SUP></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">9 In light of these findings, the district court's
statement that defendants' &quot;demonstrations are usually peaceful in nature,&quot;
id. at 1423, must be placed in context.  A nonviolent demonstration can still
cross the line from constitutionally protected protest to unprotected
harassment, intimidation and obstruction. For example, one witness testified
that &quot;counselors&quot; would sometimes follow patients for &quot;several
hundred feet along sidewalks or through parking lots,&quot; often &quot;pushing,
shoving, grabbing,&quot; or causing other &quot;fairly serious bodily contact .
. . forcing patients to run a kind of gauntlet . . . .&quot;  Tr.263-64
(Elizabeth Sholes).  The same witness described the &quot;sidewalk counseling&quot;
experience in these terms:  &quot;It's pretty vehement, and it's very scary. 
The content of the message is not even the issue.  It's the sheer proximity of
total strangers getting in your path . . . and the whole thing is very
frightening.&quot;  Tr.301.</FONT></P>
<P>Not surprisingly, the district court found that these activities impeded the
movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and that such activity seriously
jeopardized the health and safety of clinic patients and staff.  In particular,
&quot;[t]he presence of numerous demonstrators in the driveway entrances
intimidate[d] and impede[d] the drivers of cars seeking access to the parking
lots of the facilities and create[d] a danger both to the occupants of the cars
and the demonstrators themselves.&quot;  Id. at 1424.  Also, the district court
found that defendants' &quot;activity cause[d] stress and sometimes even
physical injury to the patients, patient escorts and medical staff, and
disrupt[ed] the atmosphere necessary for rendering safe and efficacious health
care.&quot;  Id.</P>
<P>As the district court recognized, these problems are especially acute in
this context because of &quot;uncontradicted testimony that the risks associated
with an abortion increase if the patient suffers from additional stress and
anxiety.&quot;  Id. at 1427.  &quot;Often times&quot; this heightened anxiety
required patients to reschedule their abortion procedures.  &quot;This delay can
[also] increase the risks associated with an abortion.&quot;  Id.<SUP>10</SUP> 
Finally, the district court found that &quot;[l]ocal law enforcement has been
unable to respond effectively to plaintiffs' complaints about `pro-life'
demonstrators harassing patients and blocking access to the clinics.&quot;  Id.
at 1426.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">10 As the district court explained:  &quot;For some women
who elect to undergo an abortion, clinical medical personnel prescribe and
insert a device known as a pre-abortion laminaria to achieve cervical dilation. 
In these instances, timely removal of the laminaria is necessary to avoid
infection, bleeding and other potentially serious complications.  If a woman
returning to have the laminaria removed finds that her access to the clinic

entrance is blocked or impeded, or if she becomes so distressed by the `sidewalk

counselors' that she cannot undergo surgery, the above-mentioned complications
may result.&quot;  Id.</FONT></P>
<P>The preliminary injunction issued by the district court responded to these
very specific findings.  It adopted the terms of the TRO with three important
modifications.  It added a 15-foot buffer zone around clinic driveways and
entrances in response to evidence that the TRO had not succeeded in keeping the
driveways and entrances clear for ingress and egress.  It provided that &quot;sidewalk
counselors&quot; who are told to back off must rejoin the other demonstrators 15
feet away in response to evidence that the more ambiguous cease and desist
provision in the TRO had not succeeded in curbing harassment by &quot;sidewalk
counselors.&quot;  And it elaborated on the ban against tortious harassment in
the TRO by prohibiting &quot;sidewalk counselors&quot; from &quot;grabbing,
touching, pushing, shoving or crowding persons entering or leaving&quot;
abortion clinics, all of which had been revealed in the record.</P>
<P>Only two of the fifty named defendants appealed to the Second Circuit.  The
original panel unanimously upheld most of the provisions of the preliminary
injunction.  However, by a 2-1 vote, the panel struck down the 15-foot buffer
zone around clinic entrances and clinic patients, as well as the cease and
desist provision applicable to &quot;sidewalk counselors.&quot;  Pro-Choice
Network v. Schenck, 67 F.3d 359 (2d Cir. 1994).</P>
<P>The portion of the panel decision invalidating these two provisions was then
reversed in a 13-2 en banc opinion.<SUP>11</SUP>  Schenck, 67 F.3d 377.  The
principal opinion for the court was written by Judge Oakes and signed by nine
members of the Second Circuit.  Applying the test announced by this Court in
Madsen v. Women's Health Center, 514 U.S. , 114 S.Ct. 2516 (1994),<SUP>12</SUP>
the en banc court concluded that both challenged provisions were content-neutral
and restricted &quot;no more speech than was necessary&quot; to serve the
significant governmental interests in medical safety, public safety and access

to abortions.  Schenck, 67 F.3d at 387.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">11 The only two dissenting votes were cast by the majority
members of the original panel whose decision was overruled.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">12  The district court did not have the benefit of this
Court's opinion Madsen when it issued the preliminary injunction.  Its analysis
of the preliminary injunction as a time, place and manner restriction was
consistent with then prevailing law.  Pro-Choice I, 799 F.Supp. at 1432-37.</FONT></P>
<P>In reviewing the buffer zone, Judge Oakes emphasized that demonstrators &quot;can
still picket, carry signs, pray, sing or chant in full view of people going into
the clinic or just passing by.&quot;  Id. at 389.  Furthermore, Judge Oakes
noted, the ability of two &quot;sidewalk counselors&quot; to approach persons on
an individualized basis &quot;ensures that the injunction does not hamper
[defendants'] message, only its intimidating method of demonstration.&quot;  Id.</P>
<P>Likewise, Judge Oakes concluded that the cease and desist provision was not
designed &quot;to suppress speech because of the anxiety its content produces in
its audience . . . but rather to provide a vulnerable group of medical patients
with some relief from the duress caused by unwelcome physical proximity to an
extremely vocal group of demonstrators.&quot;  Id. at 391-92.</P>
<P>Echoing this approach, Judge Winter's concurring opinion, signed by ten
members of the Second Circuit, stressed that &quot;the First Amendment does not,
in any context, protect coercive or obstructionist conduct that intimidates or
physically prevents individuals from going about ordinary affairs.&quot;  Id. at
394.  Judge Meskill's dissent described this principle as &quot;unassailable.&quot;
 Id. at 408.  His disagreement with the majority dealt much more with the
majority's characterization of the record than with its characterization of the
law.</P>
<P>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</P>
<P>There is no dispute in this case about the governing legal standard, which
was announced by this Court only two years ago in Madsen, 114 S.Ct. 2516.  It is
also undisputed that the Second Circuit applied the Madsen standard when it
concluded that the challenged provisions of the preliminary injunction &quot;burden
no more speech than necessary to serve a significant government interest,&quot;
id. at 2525.</P>
<P>Petitioners purport to be applying the Madsen standard, as well, in
challenging the preliminary injunction.  Ultimately, however, their argument
rests on the untenable proposition that any injunction in this case that goes
beyond a ban on trespass and harassment automatically burdens &quot;more speech
than necessary.&quot;  That argument is flawed for at least three reasons.</P>
<P>First, it is inconsistent with Madsen itself, where this Court upheld an
injunction that contained anti-trespass and anti-harassment provisions along
with a 36-foot buffer zone.  Second, it ignores extensive findings by the

district court of physical obstruction, intimidation, harassment, crowding,
grabbing, and screaming; of a continuation of these problems even after entry of
the more limited temporary restraining order; and of the inability of the police
to assure access to the clinics without some back-off provisions and a
prophylactic buffer zone.  Third, it mischaracterizes the significant state
interest in this case, which is not merely about protecting the property rights
of clinic owners but, even more significantly, about ensuring safe and unimpeded
access to reproductive health services that have a constitutional status of
their own.</P>
<P>To be sure, the Madsen standard is a serious one and ought to be seriously
applied.  Any injunction that distances protestors from the object of their
protest raises profound constitutional issues under the First Amendment for all
the reasons that this Court articulated in Madsen.  Indeed, the amici
organizations that have joined in this brief are most often on the side of those
challenging such restrictions.  But it has never been the law that the First
Amendment guarantees the right to protest in any manner one chooses, or to use
the occasion of a protest to physically harass, intimidate or obstruct one's
ideological opponents.  To the contrary, this Court has repeatedly held that the
First Amendment does not immunize otherwise unlawful conduct merely because the
persons engaging in that conduct have an ideological motivation.  Wisconsin v.
Mitchell, 506 U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 2194 (1993).</P>
<P>As petitioners correctly point out, even content-neutral injunctions against
speech are disfavored.  Petitioners also correctly note that any injunction
impinging on speech, even indirectly, must be narrowly drawn and tailored to the
particular circumstances.  However, contrary to petitioners' argument, those
principles cannot resolve this controversy unless they are grounded in the
facts.  Assessed in light of the facts, the preliminary injunction in this case
burdens no more speech than necessary to achieve significant government
interests.</P>
<P>It is important to remember that before this case began, plaintiffs were
victimized by a series of mass blockades that severely disrupted reproductive
health services in the area, and that even petitioners concede were clearly
illegal.  During the 18 months that the TRO was in place, clinic driveways and
entrances continued to be blocked, and clinic patients and staff continued to be
surrounded, followed, harassed, and obstructed.</P>
<P>Under these circumstances, the 15-foot buffer zone created by the
preliminary injunction was a measured and incremental response to an ongoing
problem that threatened the health, welfare and safety of patients, staff and
demonstrators.  Like the buffer zone in Madsen, it was directed at the conduct
of the protestors, not their message.  Unlike Madsen, it left the protestors on
the same side of the street as the clinics they were picketing.  Thus, even more
than in Madsen, the protestors' chants could still easily be heard and their
signs could still easily be read.</P>
<P>Petitioners' challenge to the cease and desist provision is similarly
misguided.  Amici fully acknowledge and have frequently advocated the importance
of face-to-face communication.  But the right to engage someone on the street in
a political dialogue does not include the right to crowd, surround, badger, and
obstruct, which is how the district court described the behavior of the
defendants in this case.</P>
<P>ARGUMENT</P>
<P>I. THE FIRST AMENDMENT PRINCIPLES THAT GOVERN THIS CASE ARE WELL-ESTABLISHED
AND LEAVE AMPLE ROOM FOR  PETITIONERS'  POLITICAL  PROTEST</P>
<P>Petitioners have presented this case as a basic test of the right to engage
in political protest on the street.  It is not.  The preliminary injunction
undeniably limits petitioners' ability to engage in the sort of obstruction,
intimidation and harassment that the record reveals, but such unlawful activity
has never been protected by the First Amendment, nor should it be.  Petitioners
have also suggested that, because this case involves abortion, First Amendment
principles have been sacrificed on the altar of political correctness.  That
argument, too, is entirely without merit.  Indeed, it is probably backwards. 
This preliminary injunction would not have aroused the same level of controversy
if the defendants were white supremacists who had repeatedly engaged in similar
acts of obstruction, intimidation and harassment directed at blacks trying to
register to vote.</P>
<P>Stripped of its rhetoric, this case is much more about facts than law.  The
evidence that defendants have overstepped the bounds of lawful political protest
is substantial.  The evidence that defendants have been prevented from
delivering their anti-abortion message is virtually non-existent.  Amici's view
of the record, therefore, is very different from petitioners' view.  By
contrast, there is much less disagreement over the broad First Amendment
principles that govern this case.  It is nonetheless helpful to restate those
principles because they necessarily shape the argument that follows.</P>
<P>Most fundamentally, petitioners' First Amendment right to demonstrate on the
public streets is beyond dispute.  That right has been recognized at least since
Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496, and is integral to our notions of democratic
self-government.</P>
<P>The right to protest on the public streets, moreover, cannot be limited or
abridged because of the content of petitioners' message.  Police Dep't of
Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92 (1972); Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455 (1980).  In
addition, petitioners have the right to convey their message to its intended
audience, see, e.g., Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229 (1963), which in
this case consists of clinic patients and staff.</P>
<P>Speech does not lose its First Amendment protection in a public forum
because it is vituperative, Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1 (1949), or
because it would be regarded as &quot;offensive&quot; by some, Texas v. Johnson,
491 U.S. 397 (1989), or because it seeks to &quot;persuade to action, not merely
to describe facts,&quot;  Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 537 (1945).  To the
extent that Judge Winter's opinion below can be read to suggest that First
Amendment speech should be judged by its effect on the &quot;timid,&quot;
Schenck, 67 F.3d at 396, we disagree.  This Court has properly rejected broad
restrictions on speech premised on the reaction of the most vulnerable audience.
 Cf. Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380 (1957).</P>
<P>On the other hand, the fact that one is engaged in expressive activity does
not immunize otherwise unlawful activity.  Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 113 S.Ct.
2194.  Such unlawful activity may be enjoined.  Still, any injunction limiting
expressive activity raises serious First Amendment concerns, Carroll v.
President and Comm'rs of Princess Anne, 393 U.S. 175 (1968), even if the
restraint is content-neutral and the limitation on speech is incidental.</P>
<P>The question of how extensive the record of unlawful activity must be to
justify an injunction inevitably depends on the seriousness of the unlawful
activity and the scope of the injunction.  Isolated, unlawful acts do not
justify a broad injunction against speech, NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware, 458 U.S.
886 (1982).<SUP>13</SUP>  But this case involves neither isolated unlawful acts
nor a broad injunction against speech.  Rather, the challenged order was
designed to protect ingress and egress from abortion clinics that had been
repeatedly blocked, and to protect patients and staff that had been repeatedly
harassed, over an extended period of time.  Even under these circumstances,
however, an injunction &quot;must burden no more speech than is necessary,&quot;
Madsen, 114 S. Ct. at 2525, to survive First Amendment scrutiny.</P>

<P>In making this judgment, the site of the protest may sometimes be relevant. 
What is permissible in a public park may not be permissible outside a school,
Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104 (1972), or a medical facility.<SUP>14</SUP></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">13 In stark contrast to the preliminary injunction here,

the permanent injunction in Claiborne Hardware prohibited the NAACP from, inter
alia, &quot;picketing or patroling&quot; any of plaintiffs' stores and from &quot;persuading&quot;
customers not to patronize plaintiffs' businesses.  458 U.S. at 893.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">14 Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's view in Sabelko v. City
of Phoenix, 68 F.3d 1169, 1172 (9th Cir. 1995), petition for cert. filed, 64
U.S.L.W. 3625 (Mar. 5, 1996)(No. 95-1415), this premise does not lead to the
conclusion that the public streets outside a health care facility should no

longer be regarded as a public forum.  This Court's cases are clearly to the
contrary.  E.g., United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171 (1983).</FONT></P>
<P>This regulatory principle is a limited one, however, and cannot be stretched
to support the claim that speech is entitled to diminished constitutional
protection whenever its message is targeted at specific individuals rather than
at the public as a whole.  As the AFL-CIO correctly points out in its amicus
brief, First Amendment activity frequently relies on targeted speech in a
variety of contexts from political protests to labor pickets to student
demonstrations to civil rights boycotts.  See, e.g., Thornhill v. Alabama, 310
U.S. 88, 99 (1940).</P>
<P>As a matter of principle, therefore, we agree with the AFL-CIO that
demonstrators should not be required to address the public as a whole if the
object of their protest is more narrowly focused.  But, unlike the AFL-CIO, we
do not read Judge Winter's opinion as going so far.  Rather, we read it as
standing for the less troublesome proposition that physically &quot;coercive and
obstructionist&quot; behavior, Schenck, 67 F.3d at 396, is more intimidating
when directed at individuals than at a crowd, even in the context of a political
protest. If our interpretation is incorrect, we share the concerns expressed by
the AFL-CIO in its amicus brief.</P>
<P>Likewise, we agree with the AFL-CIO that individuals walking down the street
should not be regarded as a &quot;captive audience&quot; for First Amendment
purposes even if they are the intended targets of protest.  Indeed, amici
believe that there are significant dangers to applying the &quot;captive
audience&quot; doctrine to a quintessential public forum.  As this Court has
often observed, all of us are subject to unwanted messages as soon as we venture
outside our homes.  Rowan v. Post Office Dep't, 397 U.S. 728, 738 (1970).  But
the fact that a message is unavoidable should not mean that it is inescapable. 
Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 21 (1971).  The First Amendment protects
listeners as well as speakers.  The latter have a right to deliver their
message; the former have a right to walk away without having to run a &quot;gauntlet
of harassment.&quot;  Pro-Choice I, 799 F.Supp. at 1424.<SUP>15</SUP></P>
<P>In short, amici do not endorse all of the Second Circuit's reasoning and
language, particularly with regard to the captive audience doctrine and the
significance of targeted protests.  However, we continue to believe that the
preliminary injunction issued by the district court is consistent with the First
Amendment in light of this record and should be upheld.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">15 When clinic patients and staff are physically prevented
from &quot;walking away&quot; they are, in a very literal sense, &quot;captives&quot;
of the hostile demonstrators who stand in their path.  The 15-foot buffer zone
imposed by the district court was a response to that problem.  The buffer zone,
however, does not prevent the demonstrators from delivering their message. 
Indeed, their continued ability to do so is critical to the First Amendment
analysis in this case.  The &quot;captive audience&quot; doctrine, by contrast,
is designed to silence the message altogether out of respect for the listener's
privacy interests.  Thus, Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298 (1974),
upheld a ban on all political advertising on city buses.  Similarly, Frisby v.
Schultz, 487 U.S. 474 (1988), upheld a ban on all residential picketing. 
Applying the &quot;captive audience&quot; doctrine to this case, as it was
applied in Frisby, would mean that petitioners could not even engage in a silent
vigil outside of the clinics.  No one has sought that relief, and it would be
indefensible under the First Amendment.  For similar reasons, the notion that
individuals can invoke the &quot;captive audience&quot; doctrine whenever &quot;they
have been sought out [by protestors] at a particular location they can avoid
only at a cost,&quot; Schenck, 67 F.3d at 396, stretches the &quot;captive
audience&quot; doctrine much too far.  Among other things, it could be used to
challenge every labor picket.  This Court should not endorse that result, nor
does this case require it.</FONT></P>
<P>II. THE 15-FOOT BUFFER ZONE COMPORTS WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND EQUITABLE
STANDARDS SET FORTH IN MADSEN</P>
<P>A.        The Injunction Followed Extensive Evidentiary Hearings And Rested
Upon Findings Of Obstruction, Harassment, Repeated Disobedience Of The Temporary
Restraining Order, And Limited Capacity Of The Police To Maintain Unimpeded 
Access  To The  Clinics</P>
<P>Prior to issuing the injunction, the district court found that &quot;[t]he
demonstrators [would] crowd around people trying to enter the [health care]
facilities in an intimidating and obstructing manner, and grab, push and shove
the patients, patient escorts and staff.&quot;  Pro-Choice I, 799 F.Supp. at
1424.  It further found that &quot;[d]emonstrators frequently and routinely
congregate[d] in or near the driveway entrances to the parking lots in order to
impede and obstruct access to the facilities,&quot; id., and that &quot;[o]n
some occasions the drivers of and occupants of the cars trying to enter the
clinic parking lots [were] so intimidated or confused by the demonstrators that
they [left] the area thereby causing those occupants seeking health care to
suffer a delay in obtaining such care.&quot;  Id.</P>
<P>The record thus supported the district court's concern that a simple
injunction directing defendants not to obstruct ingress to and egress from the
medical facilities, as the TRO provided, was ineffective without the more
specific protection of a buffer zone.  Id. at 1434.  Indeed, even before the
events in question, the obstruction of vehicular or pedestrian traffic
constituted a violation of New York Penal Law &#167;240.20(5)(disorderly
conduct).  Yet neither this Penal Law provision nor the TRO deterred the
obstructive activities of defendants.  Additionally, the district court found
that &quot;[l]ocal law enforcement ha[d] been unable to respond effectively to
plaintiffs' complaints about `pro-life' demonstrators harassing patients and
blocking access to the clinics.&quot;  Pro-Choice I, 799 F.Supp. at 1426.  The
court noted that &quot;[d]efendants participate[d] in their `rescue' activities
on a continual basis and the local police [did] not have the resources necessary
to monitor the situation constantly.&quot;  Id.</P>
<P>Finally, five of the individual defendants were adjudged by the district
court to have violated the temporary restraining order.  Pro-Choice Network v.
Project Rescue, 828 F. Supp. 1018, 1028-29 (W.D.N.Y. 1993)(&quot;Pro-Choice II&quot;).
 And, as the court further found, many of those associated with Project Rescue
were &quot;arrested on more than one occasion for harassment, yet persist[ed] in
harassing and intimidating patients, patient escorts and medical staff.&quot; 
Pro-Choice I, 799 F.Supp. at 1425.</P>
<P>On the record, therefore, there was ample basis for the district court to
conclude that its earlier, more general injunctive provisions were ineffective,
and that the original 15-foot buffer around individuals (but not clinic and
driveway entrances) had failed to stop these defendants from their physically
obstructive and unlawful behavior.</P>
<P>B.  The Buffer Zone Provision Was Not Directed At The Content Of
Petitioners' Speech</P>
<P>This Court has emphasized that injunctions directed at the content of
expression bear a &quot;heavy presumption of invalidity,&quot; Bantam Books,
Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 70 (1963), and can only be sustained in the most
&quot;exceptional cases,&quot; Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697 (1931).  In this
case, however, the injunction is not directed at the content of petitioners'
expression but at their obstructive behavior.</P>
<P>By its terms, the injunction does not focus on the content of petitioners'
speech.  And there is nothing in the record to suggest that, in issuing the
injunction, the district court wished to suppress petitioners' message.<SUP>16</SUP></P>
<P>As this Court explained in Madsen, in language that is equally applicable
here:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[T]he [trial] court imposed restrictions on petitioners incidental to their
antiabortion message because they repeatedly violated the court's original
order.  That petitioners all share the same viewpoint regarding abortion does
not in itself demonstrate that some invidious content- or viewpoint-based
purpose motivated the issuance of the order.  It suggests only that those in the
group whose conduct violated the court's order happen to share the same opinion
regarding abortions being performed at the clinic. In short, the fact that the
injunction covered people with a particular viewpoint does not itself render the
injunction content or viewpoint based.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>114 S.Ct. at 2523-24 (emphasis in original).<SUP>17</SUP></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">16 The cease and desist provision is also not the
equivalent of a content-based &quot;heckler's veto.&quot;  See pp.28-29, infra.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">17 By contrast, the ordinance at issue in Sabelko v. City
of Phoenix, 68 F.3d 1169, contains a &quot;cease and desist&quot; provision that
applies to all persons engaged in &quot;demonstration activity,&quot; regardless
of whether they have engaged in prior unlawful conduct, but does not apply to
anyone else.  Id. at 1170 n.1.  Thus, it is not a general harassment statute
but, instead, an ordinance targeted specifically at protestors.  Such
selectivity in an ordinance raises serious issues of content discrimination
under Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312 (1988).</FONT></P>
<P>C.  The Buffer Zone Is Necessary Both To Ensure Access To The Health Care
Facilities And To Protect The Health, Safety, And Reproductive Choices Of Women 
Undergoing  Medical Treatment</P>
<P>The buffer zone order in this case rests upon three interests that this
Court recognized as &quot;significant&quot; in Madsen.  114 S.Ct. at 2526. 
First, the district court and the court of appeals found the buffer zone
necessary to ensure unobstructed physical access to the health care facilities. 
Pro-Choice I, 799 F.Supp. at 1433; Schenck, 67 F.3d at 389.  Second, both the
district and appellate courts concluded that the buffer zone was necessary to
protect a serious and identifiable threat to the health and safety of women
seeking medical treatment in these facilities.  Id.  Third, the provision was
needed to ensure women's access to reproductive and family planning services,
including abortion.  Madsen, 114 S.Ct. at 2526.<SUP>18</SUP>  On the record in
this case, each of these interests can stand independently as &quot;significant&quot;
justifications for the buffer zone requirement.  In combination, they are more
than &quot;sufficient to justify an appropriately tailored injunction.&quot; 
Id.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">18 Although this interest in reproductive choice
represents, in some sense, a more particularized articulation of the interests
in physical access to clinics and to a safe medical environment, the fact that
the medical service at issue has specific constitutional protection adds weight
to the reasons supporting the injunction.  There is no question that there is a
substantial, indeed a compelling interest in securing fundamental rights against
coercive interference by private parties.  See Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191,
198-99 (1992)(upholding 100-foot ban on electioneering outside of polling places
because of history of intimidation); see also 42 U.S.C. &#167;1985 (private
conspiracies to deny civil rights can be redressed in an action for damages or
injunctive relief).</FONT></P>
<P>As previously described, the record reveals that defendants' behavior
seriously obstructed pedestrian and vehicular movement into and out of the
health care facilities, Pro-Choice I, 799 F.Supp. at 1424; that such obstructive
behavior -consisting in part of surrounding women who were trying to enter and
leave the clinics -- was so menacing that it jeopardized the health and safety
of those women, id. at 1427; and that such obstructive and menacing behavior was
so persistent that it required the creation of a pedestrian lane or buffer zone
to allow persons and automobiles to enter and leave the clinics safely, id. at
1434.</P>
<P>Given the plain necessity for some sort of buffer zone in response to
defendants' repeated unwillingness to cease their obstructive conduct in the
absence of such a bright line, a 15-foot limit is hardly excessive. 
Significantly, petitioners have not identified even a single instance in which
the 15-foot buffer zone will place them across the street from any of the
clinics covered by the preliminary injunction.  (This contrasts, of course, with
the 36-foot buffer zone upheld in Madsen, which did place the demonstrators
across the road from the clinic in that case.)</P>
<P>Petitioners criticize the &quot;one-size-fits-all nature&quot; of the
15-foot buffer zone.  We agree that any injunction affecting speech must be
tailored to the geography of the particular demonstration sites.  Once again,
however, petitioners' argument ignores the record.  The 15-foot buffer zone was
not created randomly or arbitrarily.  Rather, the 15-foot distance was chosen to
ensure a safe turning radius for cars entering driveways that had previously
been overwhelmed by demonstrators, and to ensure safe passage for patients and
staff arriving by foot who had previously been forced to walk a &quot;gauntlet
of harassment.&quot;  See TRO Hearing, September 26, 1990.  In choosing this
distance as an appropriate one, the district court was fully aware that none of
the demonstrators would be forced across the street at any of the sites involved
in this case.<SUP>19</SUP>  Contrary to petitioners' assertion, therefore, the
15-foot buffer zone is site specific in this very practical and critical sense.
<SUP>20</SUP></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">19 Diagrams of each of the clinic sites were included in
the record at the preliminary injunction hearing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">20 In addition to providing for a 15-foot buffer zone in
front of the health care facilities, the injunction requires a floating 15-foot
buffer zone around each &quot;person or vehicle seeking access to or leaving&quot;
the clinics.  Petitioners criticize the &quot;floating buffer zone&quot; on the
ground that it fails to specify how far from a clinic a floating buffer zone may
reach.  Pet.Br. at 17.  In a specific Statement of Clarification, the district
court has already indicated that the &quot;floating zone&quot; would only apply &quot;at
the sites chosen for demonstrations,&quot; J.A.29, i.e., in the immediate
vicinity of the clinics.  That limitation is sound, but still vague.  The Second
Circuit responded to this concern by suggesting that &quot;[t]his is exactly the
type of issue that is best left to case-by-case adjudication by the district
court.&quot;  Schenck, 67 F.3d at 389 n.4.  Defendants, however, have a due
process right to know in advance what conduct is proscribed by the preliminary
injunction.  Amici do not believe the Second Circuit's assurance that the
district court &quot;will apply a reasonable geographic scope to the phrase
`seeking access or leaving,'&quot; id., is sufficient.  Since the Second Circuit
has already ordered a remand, id. at 391, this Court should direct the district
court to impose specific distances governing the reach of the &quot;floating
buffer zone&quot; requirements at each facility.</FONT></P>
<P>D.  The Injunction Preserves Petitioners' Ability To Convey Their Message In
A Meaningful  And  Effective Way</P>
<P>The 15-foot zone provides defendants with an opportunity to engage in a full
range of expressive activity.  Some representatives of the defendant
organizations can engage in individualized, face-to-face communication with
women entering the clinics in an effort to persuade them, on a personal level,
that abortion is wrong.  They can do so in immediate proximity to the targets of
their expression and without regard to the 15-foot buffer -- unless and until
they are told that their continued presence is unwelcome.  At the same time,
others from the defendant groups can gather with like-minded individuals and
stage a demonstration or carry placards at any location at least 15 feet from
the clinics.  In so doing, anti-choice activists can demonstrate, by the force
of their numbers, how many people support their message.  Moreover, inasmuch as
these demonstrations or placard-carrying events can be held as close as 15 feet
from the clinics, they remain well within sight and sound of the targets of the
messages conveyed by the defendants.  See Madsen, 114 S.Ct. at 2527 (one of the
factors the Court considered in upholding a 36-foot buffer zone was that &quot;[p]rotestors
standing across the narrow street from the clinic can still be seen and heard
from the clinic parking lots&quot;).</P>
<P>For these reasons, the 15-foot zone is valid under the standard articulated
by this Court in Madsen.  The requirement rests on an ample record supporting
its necessity.  And, especially when read in conjunction with the provision
allowing &quot;sidewalk counseling,&quot; the injunction provides defendants
with a full range of opportunities to engage in a variety of expressive
activities at appropriate locations.  So understood, the buffer zone cannot be
found to &quot;burden more speech than necessary.&quot;</P>
<P>III. THE PROVISIONS OF THE INJUNCTION RELATING TO &quot;SIDEWALK COUNSELING&quot;
COMPORT WITH THE APPROACH OF THE COURT IN COHEN v. CALIFORNIA AND, AS
INTERPRETED BY THE SECOND CIRCUIT, SATISFY THE MADSEN STANDARD</P>
<P>As noted, &#167;1(c) of the injunction allows for individualized,
face-to-face communication between the defendants and those entering or leaving
the targeted medical facilities.  By permitting two &quot;sidewalk counselors&quot;
to communicate directly with each patient, notwithstanding the 15-foot buffer
zone, the injunction provides petitioners with a range of expressive
opportunities.</P>
<P>Section 1(c) also provides, however, that a person who does not want to be
counseled, &quot;who wants to leave or walk away . . . shall have an absolute
right to do [so] and in such event, the persons seeking to counsel that person
shall cease and desist from counseling that person.&quot;  As explained by the
district court, this provision will only be enforced if the targeted person or
group &quot;indicates, either verbally or non-verbally, that they do not wish to
be counseled . . . .&quot;  Pro-Choice I, 799 F.Supp. at 1434.  Based on the
record and as so construed, &#167;1(c) was amply justified.  The extensive
evidence of harassment by &quot;sidewalk counselors&quot; supported the court's
conclusion that without a specific back-off requirement these &quot;counselors&quot;
would continue to crowd, follow, and otherwise harass clinic patients and staff.<SUP>21</SUP></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">21 The court of appeals acknowledged the potential
vagueness inherent in the text of &#167;1(c) and directed the district court, on
remand, to modify formally the language of the injunction to provide that the &quot;cease
and      desist&quot; requirement will only be triggered when the targets of &quot;sidewalk
counseling&quot; &quot;indicate[] either verbally or non-verbally that they do
not wish to be counseled.&quot;  Schenck, 67 F.3d at 391.  Although this
modification represents a significant improvement in the text of the provision,
amici believe that the provision should be further improved and any ambiguity in
its operation additionally reduced by limiting it to circumstances where the
target indicates verbally that she or he does not wish to be counseled.  Such a
modification would eliminate any potential misunderstanding created by nonverbal
communication.</FONT></P>
<P>This Court has long recognized that there is no authority to silence a
speaker merely because the expression may be distasteful to an unwilling
listener or observer.  Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. at 21; Erznoznik v. City of
Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 210 (1975).  In Cohen, Justice Harlan carefully
explored this issue and the competing societal concerns:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[M]uch has been made of the claim that Cohen's distasteful mode of
expression was thrust upon unwilling or unsuspecting viewers, and that the State
might therefore legitimately act as it did in order to protect the sensitive
from otherwise unavoidable exposure to [his] crude form of protest.  Of course,
the mere presumed presence of unwitting listeners or viewers does not serve
automatically to justify curtailing all speech capable of giving offense . . . .
 While this Court has recognized that government may properly act in many
situations to prohibit intrusion into the privacy of the home of unwelcome views
and ideas which cannot be totally banned from the public dialogue . . . we have
at the same time consistently stressed that &quot;we are often `captives'
outside the sanctuary of the home and subject to objectionable speech&quot;</P>
<P>. . . . The ability of government, consonant with the Constitution, to shut
off discourse solely to protect others from hearing it is, in other words,
dependent upon a showing that substantial privacy interests are being invaded in
an essentially intolerable manner.  Any broader view of this authority would
effectively empower a majority to silence dissidents simply as a matter of
personal predilections.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>403 U.S. at 21 (citations omitted).  Thus, the solution to the problem of
unwanted expression offered by Justice Harlan in Cohen was that those offended
by a particular statement &quot;could effectively avoid further bombardment of
their sensibilities simply by averting their eyes&quot; and walking away.  Id.</P>
<P>If the injunction in this case had prohibited representatives of Project
Rescue from even approaching persons entering the clinics without permission on
the theory that Project Rescue's message was objectionable to women who were
seeking abortions, such a provision would have run afoul of the concerns
articulated in Cohen.  See also Madsen, 114 S. Ct. at 2529, quoting Boos v.
Barry, 485 U.S. at 322.  But the injunction here is not nearly so restrictive. 
It permits defendants to approach and communicate with those entering the
medical facilities, even if their message is disagreeable to the clinics'
patients and staff.  However, the injunction provides that, when those who are
personally confronted in a face-to-face physical encounter with &quot;sidewalk
counselors&quot; indicate that they have heard enough and do not want to be &quot;harass[ed],
badger[ed], intimidate[d]&quot; or surrounded by people yelling in their ear,
Pro-Choice I, 799 F. Supp. at 1425, the &quot;counselors&quot; must stop their
pursuit, back off, and return to the demonstration area or else approach a
different person.</P>
<P>Petitioners continue to insist that &quot;sidewalk counselors&quot; should
have no obligation to retreat even when requested to do so by an unwilling
listener who is seeking to walk away.  But petitioners fail to cite any case
upholding the right to harass, intimidate or obstruct individuals walking down
the street, for an entire city block, after they have asked to be left alone. 
At its heart, the &quot;cease and desist&quot; provision is directed at this
sort of behavior.  It is intended to permit individuals to follow Justice
Harlan's suggestion in Cohen and walk away.  Nothing in Madsen can fairly be
read as deviating from the &quot;walk away&quot; approach urged by the Court in
Cohen.<SUP>22</SUP></P>
<P>Contrary to petitioners' claims, the &quot;cease and desist&quot; measure
does not create a &quot;heckler's veto&quot; of the sort previously condemned by
the Court.  See, e.g., Forsyth County v. The Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123
(1992).  A &quot;heckler's veto&quot; is an attempt to prevent a speaker from
communicating with the public at large merely because one or more individuals
are offended by the speaker's message.  In this case, by contrast, the cease and
desist provision merely permits patients and staff to walk away from a
face-to-face confrontation with &quot;sidewalk counselors&quot; whose
willingness to engage in acts of physical harassment and intimidation is amply
demonstrated in this record.<SUP>23</SUP>  The rebuffed &quot;street counselor&quot;
is in no way prevented from communicating with the public or with other possibly
more receptive recipients of his message.  Thus, the &quot;street counselor&quot;
can continue to communicate in the demonstration site area -- a mere 15 feet
from the clinic entrance -- and can approach any other pedestrian.  So
understood, the &quot;cease and desist&quot; provision creates no more of a
heckler's veto than does a person who refuses to accept an unwanted leaflet from
a sidewalk pamphleteer or who hangs up the telephone in response to an unwelcome
caller, or an individual who asks the post office not to deliver unwanted mail
to her home.  See Rowan v. U.S. Post Office, 397 U.S. at 736-37.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">22 Madsen involved a prohibition against all face-to-face
uninvited speech.  Although the Madsen Court recognized -- as did Cohen -- that
&quot;citizens must tolerate insulting and even outrageous speech,&quot; 114

S.Ct. at 2529, nothing in Madsen suggests that protestors can claim First
Amendment protection when they surround or obstruct citizens trying to walk away
from an unwanted message by proceeding unimpeded toward their intended
destination.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">23 The Second Circuit stressed that the cease and desist
provision is intended to &quot;provide a vulnerable group of medical patients

with some relief from the duress caused by unwelcome physical proximity to an
extremely vocal group of demonstrators,&quot; Schenck, 67 F.3d at 392, and &quot;not
. . . to suppress speech because of the anxiety its content produces in the
audience.&quot;  Id. at 391.  This interpretation is consistent with the
contempt proceedings brought under this provision.  E.g., Pro-Choice Network v.
Walker, 994 F.2d 989, 992 (2d Cir. 1993).  Thus, we do not believe the cease and
desist provision can fairly be construed, or has been applied, to prohibit a &quot;sidewalk
counselor&quot; from politely and unobtrusively asking a patient to reconsider
her initial refusal to talk.  If there is any ambiguity in that regard, this
Court can clarify it.  It bears emphasis again, however, that this record does
not reflect such innocent activity.</FONT></P>

<P>Pursuant to Rule 37.4, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the
ACLU of Tennessee respectfully move this Court for leave to file the attached
brief amicus curiae in support of petitioner.  Counsel for petitioner has
consented to this filing; counsel for respondents has refused to consent.</P>
<P>The American Civil Liberties Union is a nationwide,  nonprofit, nonpartisan
organization with nearly 300,000 members committed to the principles of liberty
and equality embodied in the Constitution and this nation's civil rights laws. 
The ACLU of Tennessee is one of its state affiliates.</P>
<P>This case involves issues of critical importance and longstanding interest
to the ACLU and its members.  The ACLU's Women's Rights Project has fought sex
discrimination in the workplace for more than two decades; likewise, the ACLU's
Reproductive Freedom Project has vigorously defended the constitutional right to
individual autonomy in matters of sexuality, procreation, and family life. 
Since its inception, the ACLU has also defended the due process rights of
criminal defendants, including the essential right to be given fair notice of
what conduct is considered a crime.</P>
<P>Because the resolution of this case touches upon all of these issues, we
respectfully request leave to file the attached amicus curiae brief supporting
reversal of the judgment below.</P>

<P>The interest of amici is set forth in the accompanying motion for leave to
file this brief amicus curiae.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="statement"></A><B>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</B></P>
<P>Beginning in 1989, the defendant David Lanier, a Tennessee chancery court
judge, engaged in a pattern of gross sexual abuse of female employees and
litigants that involved a range of physical assaults, including two rapes. 
Although the Sixth Circuit was divided on its view of the governing law, it was
united in its view of defendant's behavior.  Chief Judge Merritt's majority
opinion described it as &quot;reprehensible.&quot; United States v. Lanier, 73
F.3d 1380, 1394 n.13 (6th Cir. 1996)(en banc).  Judge Keith, dissenting,
characterized this as &quot;one of the most deplorable cases to come before the
Court since I have served on the federal bench.&quot;  Id. at 1399.</P>
<P>Even a brief review of the facts is sufficient to explain this reaction. 
Sandra Sanders was a youth services officer whom defendant had hired and who was
required by her job to consult with defendant on a weekly basis.  During one of
those meetings in 1989 the defendant grabbed and squeezed Sanders' breasts.
Sanders did not complain immediately; she did demand an apology shortly
afterwards.  In response, Lanier began to complain about her work, and
eventually demoted her by removing her supervisory authority.  Id. at 1404
(Daughtrey, J., dissenting).</P>
<P>In the fall of 1990, the defendant began to grab, touch, and squeeze his
secretary, Patty Mahoney, on her breasts and buttocks.  The assaults were a
daily occurrence, and the defendant would not stop despite Mahoney's protests. 
On one occasion he offered job privileges if she would have sex with him.  The
day that Mahoney finally resigned, the defendant lifted her off the floor, slid
her body against his, and pressed his pelvis against her.  Id.</P>
<P>During 1990, the defendant twice orally raped Vivian Archie, who was
involved in a custody case in his court.  Both of these rapes were brutal and
caused Archie physical pain and injury. Using his power over her custody
situation and his ability to find her employment, he coerced Archie into
returning to his chambers after the first rape.  There he sexually assaulted her
again by forcing his penis into her mouth, causing her to cry, gag, choke, and
partially suffocate.  Id. at 1405-06.</P>
<P>In March 1991, the defendant (while clothed in judicial robes) assaulted
another secretary, Sandy Attaway, by pushing his erect penis against her
buttocks in his judicial chambers.  When Attaway shouted at him to stop,
defendant told her to lower her voice because there were people in the
courtroom.  Three months later, Attaway was fired because &quot;things were not
working out.&quot; Id. at 1406.  After firing her, defendant told Attaway that &quot;they
would have gotten along fine if she had liked to have oral sex.&quot; Id.</P>
<P>In the fall of 1991, the defendant sexually assaulted Fonda Bandy, an
employee of a drug free housing initiative, who was meeting with him in the hope
that he would refer clients to her program.  He grabbed her breasts and crotch,
then told her she &quot;would have all the clients that she wanted&quot; if she
would return. Id. at 1407.</P>
<P>Two points are notable about these incidents.  First, Lanier's actions were
not ordinary assaults and batteries.  His various touchings, grabbings, and
rapes were not only physically abusive; they were also distinctly sexual.  His
assaults on these women thus invaded not only their bodily integrity -- but
their sexual privacy and autonomy.</P>
<P>Second, these were not ordinary rapes and sexual assaults. All were
committed not just under color of law, but by force of the particular authority
of a judge demanding sexual favors in exchange for employment or fair treatment
in his court -- essentially requiring that these women prostitute themselves or
suffer severe adverse consequences.</P>
<P>The defendant was indicted in eleven counts for violating 18 U.S.C. &#167;242,
which makes criminal all willful deprivations of &quot;rights, privileges, or
immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United
States.&quot;  The &quot;right, privilege, or immunity&quot; on which the
government relied was the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive due process
guarantee of bodily integrity -- specifically, the right to be free of sexual
assault.</P>
<P>The trial court accordingly charged the jury that the right &quot;not to be
deprived of liberty without due process of law&quot; includes the &quot;right to
be free from willful sexual assault,&quot; but that &quot;not every unjustified
touching or grabbing by a state official&quot; violates the Constitution.  The
court instructed that &quot;the physical abuse must be of a serious and
substantial nature that involves physical force, mental coercion, bodily injury
or emotional damage which is shocking to one's consci[ence].&quot;<SUP>1</SUP></P>
<P>The jury convicted Lanier of two felony and five misdemeanor violations of &#167;242.
 A Sixth Circuit panel affirmed the convictions, but the full court of appeals
reheard the case and reversed.  United States v. Lanier, 73 F.3d 1380.  The en
banc majority, in an opinion by Chief Judge Merritt, ruled that the right to
bodily integrity, including freedom from sexual assault, had not been made
sufficiently definite by decisions of this Court to fall within the
proscriptions of &#167;242, as construed in Screws  v. United States, 325 U.S.
91 (1945).  Indeed, the majority read the history of &#167;242 to reflect a
legislative intent contrary to the broad language actually adopted by Congress
when it enacted &#167;242.  Thus &#167;242 refers on its face to the deprivation
of &quot;any rights&quot; protected by the Constitution. Judge Merritt
concluded, however, that Congress intended to criminalize only deprivations of &quot;contract,
property, and equal protection&quot; rights.  73 F.3d at 1384-87.</P>
<P>Given the explicit holding of Screws, see &#167;I, infra, the Sixth Circuit
majority did acknowledge that &#167;242 also covers rights &quot;specifically
stated in the Constitution&quot; and &quot;well-established procedural due
process rights like the right to be tried before being punished by law
enforcement officers.&quot;  73 F.3d at 1392.  The majority did not explain how
this concession, compelled by Screws, could be reconciled with its reading of
the legislative history.  Furthermore, the majority held the right to be free
from sexual abuse by a judge acting in his official capacity had not been made
sufficiently specific by prior Supreme Court decisions to support a conviction
under &#167;242.  73 F.3d at 1392.  The majority thus read out of &#167;242 any
possibility that the constitutional rights to which it refers could include
bodily integrity.  Finally, the majority held that the trial court's reference
to a &quot;shocking to the conscience&quot; standard in its jury instructions
gave the jurors too much discretion to follow their personal predilections.  Id.
at 1389.</P>
<P>Judges Wellford and Nelson concurred in part and dissented in part.  Id. at
1394, 1397.  Contrary to the majority, they believed that the right to bodily
integrity protected individuals against rapes committed by government officers
using their governmental powers.  As Judge Nelson noted, Vivian Archie &quot;was
so clearly deprived of her liberty&quot; through psychological coercion and
physical restraint &quot;that the applicability of the statute strikes me as
self-evident.&quot;  Id. at 1398.  With regard to the five misdemeanor
convictions, however, Judges Wellford and Nelson did not believe that the
defendant's conduct rose (or sank) to the level of constitutional harm.</P>
<P>Judges Keith, Jones, and Daughtrey dissented.  Id. at 1399, 1400, 1403. 
They believed that previous Supreme Court and lower court decisions had
sufficiently &quot;made specific,&quot; within the meaning of Screws, &quot;the
right to be free from invasions of bodily integrity that shock the conscience.&quot;
 Id. at 1401 (Jones, J., dissenting).  Judge Daughtrey argued, in fact, that &quot;[s]exual
assault . . . must be considered one of the most blatant and serious invasions
of the protected right to bodily integrity.&quot;  Id. at 1412.  And she
protested the majority's narrow reading of &#167;242's legislative history,
arguing that the court &quot;would have us ignore the clear language of the
statute.&quot;  Id. at 1408.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="summary"></A><B>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</B></P>
<P>The majority below erred in holding that deprivations of the constitutional
right to bodily integrity can never be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. &#167;242. 
Moreover, its interpretation of the legislative history of &#167;242 was
inconsistent with this Court's decision in Screws.  The language of &#167;242 on
its face reaches all willful deprivations of constitutional rights if
accomplished under color of law.  As construed in Screws, this means any right &quot;made
definite by decision or other rule of law,&quot; 325 U.S. at 103.  By 1989, the
right to be free of coerced sexual assaults by government officers had been made
definite through a series of Supreme Court and appellate decisions establishing
the contours of sexual privacy and bodily integrity under the Fourteenth
Amendment.</P>
<P>The substantive liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment has long been understood to encompass bodily integrity and
autonomous decisionmaking in the private sphere of family life.  Central to the
substantive due process concept has been the zone of intimate decisionmaking
that encompasses choices about reproduction and sexuality. Accordingly, where
the assault is sexual, and particularly where sexual favors are demanded by
officers sufficiently powerful to coerce those under their control into
submission, the right to bodily integrity is violated.</P>
<P>Here, as elsewhere, it is necessary to draw a line between the trivial and
the nontrivial.  As Judge Friendly said many years ago and, as this Court has
repeated many times since, &quot;[n]ot every push or shove&quot; violates the
Constitution.  Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028, 1033 (2d Cir.), cert. denied,
414 U.S. 1033 (1973).  However, the necessity of line drawing is not unique to
this context -- juries are often asked to decide whether force is excessive or
unreasonable -- and does not, by itself, render a statute unconstitutionally
vague.</P>
<P>Once a defendant's conduct has been shown to be serious and substantial,
however, the right to be free of sexual acts coerced by government officers
should not depend upon whether the officer's conduct &quot;shocks the
conscience.&quot;  Under these circumstances, sexual privacy and bodily
integrity are necessarily invaded when a government official makes acquiescence
to his grabbings, gropings, or rapes the price of employment or fair treatment
in court.  Thus, in this case the &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; language in
the jury instructions, if anything, imposed an unduly rigorous burden on the
prosecution, and helped the defendant.  Although &quot;conscience-shocking,&quot;
standing alone as a legal test, would be troublesome in its vagueness and
subjectivity, in this instance the instructions taken as a whole were both
specific and accurate, informing the jury that the assaults must be &quot;of a
serious and substantial nature&quot; for criminal liability to attach, and
enumerating several objective factors for the jury to consider.  Like the
majority below, this brief focuses on the legal issues and does not take any
position on the sufficiency of the evidence.</P>
<P>In addition to violating his victims' sexual privacy and bodily integrity,
the defendant also deprived them of their rights under the Equal Protection
Clause. That is, Lanier's crimes violated both due process and equal protection
guarantees.  Although the Justice Department chose to go forward only on a
substantive due process theory, this Court should make clear that a pattern of
coercive and physically abusive, quid pro quo sexual harassment by government
officials violates equal protection rights under both 18 U.S.C. &#167;242, if
done with specific intent, and 42 U.S.C. &#167;1983.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>I. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRONEOUSLY NARROWED  THE  SCOPE 
OF &#167;242</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, this Court rejected a vagueness
challenge to criminal convictions under 18 U.S.C. &#167;242.  It ruled that the
statute's broad terms, criminalizing all willful deprivations of &quot;rights,
privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of
the United States,&quot; were not unduly vague for two reasons:  First, the &quot;rights,
privileges, or immunities&quot; in question must be &quot;made definite by
decision or other rule of law&quot; before criminal liability can attach, 325
U.S. at 103; second, &#167;242's specific intent or willfulness requirement
precluded the statute's being used as &quot;a trap for law enforcement agencies
acting in good faith.&quot;  Id. at 104.  In other words, the specific intent
required by the Act is an intent to deprive a person of a right which has been
made specific either by the express terms of the Constitution or laws of the
United States or by decisions interpreting them.</P>
<P>Id.<SUP>2</SUP></P>
<P>For fifty years, therefore, Screws has been understood to mean that the
broad reach of &#167;242 is adequately cabined, for purposes of fair notice to
criminal defendants, by the requirements that they must have specifically
intended to deprive their victims of constitutional rights, and that those
rights must have been &quot;made definite&quot; by express constitutional
language or judicial exposition. As the Sixth Circuit itself explained in United
States v. Epley, 52 F.3d 571, 576 (6th Cir. 1995), &quot;`[o]nce a due process
right has been defined and made specific by court decisions, that right is
encompassed by &#167;242'&quot; (quoting United States v. Stokes, 506 F.2d 771,
774-75 (5th Cir. 1975)). See also Williams v. United States, 341 U.S. 97, 101-02
(1951)(Screws construed &#167;242 closely to avoid vagueness; detectives'
coercion of confession was plainly unconstitutional &quot;[w]hatever the school
of thought concerning the scope and meaning of the Due Process Clause&quot;);
United States v. Reese, 2 F.3d at 880-81 (explaining Screws in course of
affirming &#167;242 convictions of police officers who used excessive force).</P>
<P>The court below implicitly assumed that the notion of evolving
constitutional rights is necessarily at odds with the due process requirement
that a defendant have notice of what conduct is criminally proscribed.  As
Screws makes clear, however, the vagueness concern under &#167;242 is whether a
right has been made sufficiently definite prior to defendant's action.  If so,
it does not matter whether our understanding of that right has evolved since &#167;242
was enacted.  On this latter issue, Screws merely embodies a theory of
constitutional interpretation that this Court has embraced at least since
McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819). That is, although the
fundamental principles set out in the Constitution and Bill of Rights do not
change, our understanding of how those principles apply necessarily evolves with
changing social conditions:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[I]n determining whether a provision of the Constitution applies to a new
subject matter, it is of little significance that it is one with which the
framers were not familiar.  For in setting up an enduring framework of
government they undertook to carry out for the indefinite future and in all the
vicissitudes of the changing affairs of men those fundamental purposes which the
instrument itself discloses.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 316 (1941).  Just as the right to
participate in a primary election, at issue in Classic, may not have been
specifically envisioned by the framers, so in Screws, as in the present case,
the concept of bodily integrity may have been little developed a century ago but
today is understood as a fulcrum of personhood and liberty.</P>
<P>Even more to the point, this Court in Screws decidedly did not limit the
broad reach of &#167;242, as the court of appeals majority apparently thought it
should have, to encompass only contract, property, and equal protection rights,
or only rights &quot;specifically stated in the Constitution.&quot; The Sixth
Circuit majority ignored both the holding and reasoning of Screws, as well as
the plain language of &#167;242, when it read bodily integrity and freedom from
sexual assault out of the statute's reach.  Instead, the court mistakenly
imposed a rigidly narrow interpretation on &#167;242 that essentially negates
any evolution in judicial understanding of the &quot;rights, privileges, or
immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United
States.&quot;  This approach is not only inconsistent with Screws and United
States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 793, 803 (1966), but it violates the first rule
of statutory construction:  fidelity to the actual language of a law.  See,
e.g., Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 178-79 (1987); Norman J. Singer,
2A Sutherland Statutory Construction &#167;46.01 (5th ed. 1992); Lanier, 73 F.3d
at 1408 (Daughtrey, J., dissenting)(citing United States v. Winters, 33 F.3d
720, 721 (6th Cir. 1994)(Merritt, C.J.), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 1148 (1995)). 
If, as the Sixth Circuit majority thought, Congress passed &#167;242
inadvertently and really only intended the law to apply to property, contract,
and equal protection rights, Congress has had more than 100 years in which to
amend the statute to correct its &quot;error.&quot;</P>
<P>The Sixth Circuit went on to rule that, even assuming a right to bodily
integrity was potentially within the broad terms of &#167;242, it had not been &quot;made
definite&quot; within the meaning of Screws because no Supreme Court decisions
on fundamentally similar facts could be found.  73 F.3d at 1392, 1393 (&quot;[a]s
we interpret the `make specific' requirement, the Supreme Court must not only
enunciate the existence of a right, it must also hold that the right applies to
a factual situation fundamentally similar to the one at bar&quot;).  The
majority erroneously rejected the dissenters' contentions that Screws permits
consideration of lower court precedents, and that a right has been made definite
when its contours and underlying principles are judicially articulated even if
no judge has yet penned a decision that is &quot;on all fours&quot; factually
(or close to it) with the case at hand.</P>
<P>Regarding the level of judicial authority needed to &quot;make definite&quot;
a constitutional right, there is some force to the majority's contention that
relying on lower court decisions risks different rules in different circuits. 
But the alternative -refusing to remedy constitutional violations of criminal
magnitude until the Supreme Court has ruled in a case with similar facts --
creates a far more serious problem of underenforcement.  And this is especially
so in egregious cases. For, as Judge Nelson explained, requiring a Supreme Court
decision on &quot;fundamentally similar&quot; facts would lead to the anomalous
result that, for example, government officials &quot;could acquire by
prescription a right to make sex slaves of litigants or prospective litigants,&quot;
73 F.3d at 1399, simply because the Supreme Court had not been presented with
that fact situation.<SUP>3</SUP></P>
<P>More importantly, however, existing Supreme Court precedents have
established the contours of the substantive due process right to sexual privacy
and bodily integrity, and appellate decisions from a variety of circuits have
specified that the right encompasses freedom from sexual coercion by government
officers.  See &#167;II, infra.  Screws' &quot;made definite&quot; standard does
not demand factual identity so long as a reasonable state actor would be on
notice that his conduct invaded constitutional rights as explicated in relevant
precedents.  Cf. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987) (&quot;clearly
established&quot; standard for 42 U.S.C. &#167;1983 qualified immunity
determinations does not require that &quot;the very act in question has
previously been held unlawful,&quot; but only that &quot;[t]he contours of the
right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand
that what he is doing violates that right . . . . [I]n the light of pre-existing
law the unlawfulness must be apparent&quot;).  Here, Supreme Court and appellate
decisions prior to 1989 put Lanier on notice that his grossly oppressive
practice of forcing himself sexually on employees and litigants subject to his
official powers violated their constitutional rights to bodily integrity and
sexual privacy.</P>

AND RAPE COERCED BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AS THE PRICE OF A JOB OR THE  CUSTODY

<P>This Court recognized as early as Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923),
and Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), that the &quot;liberty&quot;
protected by the Due Process Clause has substantive as well as procedural
elements.  Meyer and Pierce established that fundamental decisions about
childrearing and family life were part of that substantive liberty.  In Rochin
v. California, 342 U.S. 165 (1951), the Court added the right of bodily
integrity or autonomy to the concept of substantive due process.  Although
Rochin itself involved the use of unconstitutionally obtained evidence in a
criminal trial, its substantive due process/ bodily integrity holding has formed
the basis for civil rights actions at least since Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d
1028.  See, e.g., Wilson v. Northcutt, 987 F.2d 719, 722 (11th Cir. 1993);
Maldonado v. Josey, 975 F.2d 727, 730-31 (10th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113

Shillingford v. Holmes, 634 F.2d 263, 265 (5th Cir. 1981).<SUP>4</SUP></P>
<P>This Court's more recent decisions have emphasized that the substantive
liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment embraces both bodily integrity and
sexual self-determination. These cases have established protection for
decisionmaking about intimate aspects of private life, including reproduction,
marriage, and living choices.  See Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 481-82
(1965); id. at 499-500 (Harlan J., concurring)(marital privacy); Loving v.
Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967)(choice of mate); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S.
438, 453 (1972)(sexual privacy for individuals, married or single); Roe v. Wade,
410 U.S. 113 (1973)(reproductive choice); Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431
U.S. 494, 503 (1977)(living arrangements; sanctity of extended family); Carey v.
Population Services, Int'l, 431 U.S. 678, 684-86 (1977)(reproductive autonomy). 
As the Court summarized the doctrine in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern
Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 847-51 (1992), there is a &quot;realm of
personal liberty which the government may not enter&quot;; this encompasses &quot;basic
decisions about family and parenthood . . . as well as bodily integrity,&quot;
and &quot;intimate and personal choices . . . central to personal dignity and
autonomy.&quot;<SUP>5</SUP>  See also Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. , , 114
S.Ct. 807, 812 (1994)(substantive due process embraces matters relating to &quot;marriage,
family, procreation, and the right to bodily integrity&quot;).<SUP>6</SUP></P>
<P>As Casey and Albright make clear, the core of substantive due process as it
has developed since Meyer and Pierce is the set of privacy rights revolving
around marriage, family, reproduction, bodily integrity, and sexuality.  It
follows that when &quot;serious and substantial&quot; physical assaults by
government officers are explicitly sexual (whether the grabbing be of female
breasts, male genitals, or the buttocks of either sex), the Fourteenth
Amendment's substantive liberty is doubly implicated. That is, the invasion of
bodily integrity is compounded by the violation of sexual autonomy.  Moreover,
unlike nonsexual coercion, which may sometimes be justified by dangerous
circumstances or unruly suspects, there is never a justification for a
government officer to force himself sexually on individuals subject to his
official power and control.</P>
<P>Thus, in Doe v. Taylor Independent School Dist., 15 F.3d at 455, the court
of appeals found that sexual misconduct by a public school teacher violated his
student's due process rights &quot;to be free from sexual abuse and violations
of her bodily integrity&quot; and, furthermore, that those rights were clearly
established in 1987.  As the Fifth Circuit explained:  &quot;No reasonable
public school official in 1987 would have assumed that he could, with
constitutional immunity, sexually molest a minor student.&quot;  Id.  Unlike
corporal punishment, which invades bodily integrity but does not always amount
to a constitutional violation (or even a tort), there is no legitimate basis for
a state actor to inflict physical sexual injury on a child, and never has been. 
Id. at 461 (Higginbotham, J., concurring).</P>
<P>Similarly, Stoneking II, 882 F.2d at 726-27, upheld a due process claim
against a public school teacher and supervisory officials for repeated sexual
assaults on a student.<SUP>7</SUP> Like the Fifth Circuit in Doe, the Third
Circuit in Stoneking II held that the plaintiff's constitutional right to &quot;freedom
from invasion of her personal security through sexual abuse, was
well-established at the time the assaults upon her occurred&quot; in 1980-85. 
Id. at 726.  Indeed, given that sexual molestation of a student is never
justified, the court found that her due process right was established under the
bodily integrity standard of Rochin -- well before Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S.
651, announced that corporal punishment of public school students also
implicated the Fourteenth Amendment.  Stoneking II, 882 F.2d at 727.  See also
Searles v. Septa, 990 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir. 1993)(unlike claim based on
governmental negligence, right to be free of sexual coercion was
well-established by 1980s); Maldonado v. Josey, 975 F.2d at 730-31 (same).</P>
<P>There is no reason to believe that the right recognized in these cases for
public school students is not equally applicable to victims of sexual coercion
by law enforcement officers or judges.  Although minors are generally more
vulnerable than adults, the coercive effect may in fact be greater in some
circumstances where the target of sexual demands by government officers is an
adult.  A police officer's or prison guard's physical ability to overpower a
victim, or a judge or other government officer's power to control employment,
entitlements, or legal outcomes, may -- as the present case makes clear -produce
an effect even more dramatic and intimidating than a public school officer's
sexual victimization of a pupil.</P>
<P>In any event, the due process right to be free of sexual coercion by state
actors other than teachers seemed sufficiently self-evident by the 1980s that
the appellate courts simply assumed it in United States v. Davila, 704 F.2d 749
(5th Cir. 1983)(affirming the criminal conviction of immigration officers for
coercing sexual favors), and United States v. Brummett, 786 F.2d 720 (6th Cir.
1986)(affirming sentence on conviction for conspiracy to commit sexual assault).

Taylor Independent School Dist., 15 F.3d 443, that district court correctly
ruled that sheriff's rape of criminal suspect violated suspect's &quot;substantive
due process right to bodily integrity&quot;).</P>
<P>In other nonschool contexts, appellate courts have specifically recognized
freedom from sexual coercion as the basis for constitutional claims under 42
U.S.C. &#167;1983, the civil analog to &#167;242.  Dang Vang v. Vang Xiong X.
Toyed, 944 F.2d 476, 479 (9th Cir. 1991), affirmed a &#167;1983 judgment against
a state official who used his governmental powers to coerce sexual favors from
immigrants and thus violated &quot;their constitutional right to be free from
sexual assault.&quot;  In Canedy v. Boardman, 16 F.3d 183, 185 (7th Cir. 1994),
the court of appeals held that a male inmate had stated a &#167;1983 claim for
invasion of privacy and bodily integrity based on strip searches by female
guards.  See also Gilson v. Cox, 711 F.Supp. 354, 356 (E.D.Mich. 1989)(male
prisoner stated due process/bodily integrity claim against female guard who
allegedly grabbed his genitals and buttocks on several occasions).</P>
<P>In sum, coerced sex under color of official authority, whether amounting to
oral rape as in the case of Vivian Archie, or to required submission to sexual
assaults as a condition of employment, as in the case of Lanier's other victims,
was by 1989-91 a well-established violation of the constitutional rights of
sexual autonomy and bodily integrity.</P>

INSTRUCTION, STANDING ALONE, WOULD BE TOO VAGUE TO SUPPORT A CRIMINAL
CONVICTION, THE TRIAL COURT'S CHARGE ON THE RIGHT TO BODILY INTEGRITY WAS
SUFFICIENTLY SPECIFIC AND DETAILED TO GUIDE  THE JURY'S  DELIBERATIONS</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This Court and others have sometimes described deprivations of the right to

bodily integrity in terms of conduct that is &quot;arbitrary or
conscience-shocking,&quot; Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 128 (1992);
see also Rochin, 342 U.S. at 172, or that sufficiently &quot;offend[s] those
canons of decency and fairness which express the notions of justice of
English-speaking peoples . . .&quot;  Id. at 169.  In 1973, Judge Friendly
adopted the Rochin &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; language as a standard that
&quot;points the way&quot; toward determining when excessive force by government
officers amounts to a due process violation, Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d at 1033,
although he also articulated specific factors to guide a court or jury in making
the judgment.<SUP>8</SUP>  Courts have used these Johnson factors, or variants,
in excessive force cases ever since -- though less frequently since Graham v.
Connor and Whitley v. Albers held that many such claims would now be adjudicated
under the Fourth or Eighth Amendments rather than the Fourteenth.  See n.4,
supra.</P>
<P>In Collins v. Harker Heights, this Court referred interchangeably to conduct
that is &quot;conscience-shocking&quot; or &quot;arbitrary in a constitutional
sense&quot; in rejecting a substantive due process claim based on negligent
maintenance of municipal facilities, 503 U.S. at 128.  But the Court's unanimous
opinion did not make clear whether government conduct must necessarily &quot;shock
the conscience&quot; in order to violate any aspect of the Due Process Clause. 
See the debate between the Third Circuit majority and dissent on this point in
Fagan v. City of Vineland, 22 F.3d 1296, 1303-05 (3d Cir. 1994)(en
banc)(maintaining that Collins explicitly adopted a &quot;shocks the conscience&quot;
test for substantive due process claims, or at least those involving physical
injuries); id. at 1309-13 (Cowen, Becker, Scirica &amp; Lewis, JJ.,
dissenting)(arguing that the Supreme Court has never established the Rochin &quot;shocks
the conscience&quot; &quot;catch phrase&quot; as a necessary element of
substantive due process violations).  Certainly, though, for claims arising out
of the Fourteenth Amendment liberty interests in marriage, sexual privacy, and
reproductive freedom, there has never been a &quot;shocks the conscience&quot;
limitation on the scope of substantive due process rights.<SUP>9</SUP></P>
<P>There can be little question that a legal standard that allowed juries to
impose criminal liability based solely on whether the defendant's conduct &quot;shocks
the conscience&quot; would raise very serious constitutional issues.  In a case
where that was the sum total of the jury's instructions, there would be much
force to Judge Merritt's concern that the standard is too vague and subjective
to provide individuals with fair notice, or juries with sufficient guidance, as
to where the lines of criminal liability should be drawn under &#167;242.  See
Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. at 392-94; Gumz v. Morrissette, 772 F.2d 1395, 1407
(7th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1123 (1986)(Easterbrook, J., concurring)
(&quot;`shocks the conscience' . . . is a vague standard -- if it can be called
a `standard' at all -- inviting decisionmakers to consult their sensibilities
rather than objective circumstances&quot;);<SUP>10</SUP> Lanier, 73 F.3d at
1389 (&quot;`[s]hocks the conscience' is too indefinite to give notice of a
crime&quot;).<SUP>11</SUP></P>
<P>Indeed, in Rochin itself, two justices, while agreeing that the state's
conduct in the case was unconstitutional, criticized the looseness of the
language used by the majority.  See 342 U.S. at 174 (Black, J., concurring); id.
at 177 (Douglas, J., concurring).</P>
<P>But in this case, the &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; language in the jury
instruction is not a basis to reverse the convictions, for two reasons.  First,
it did not stand alone; it merely modified in two places a charge that was
otherwise sufficiently detailed and objective to guide the jury.  The
instruction, taken as a whole as it must be,<SUP>12</SUP> adequately charged
the jurors that not &quot;every unjustified touching or grabbing by a state
official&quot; violates the Constitution, and that they could not convict unless
they found the defendant's abuse to be &quot;of a serious and substantial nature
that involves physical force, mental coercion, bodily injury, or emotional
damage . . .&quot;  See n.1, supra. Moreover, the court enumerated five
objective factors (some of them variants on the factors set out in Johnson v.
Glick) for the jurors to consider in deciding whether Lanier's sexual assaults
were indeed &quot;of a serious and substantial nature.&quot;<SUP>13</SUP>  Id.</P>
<P>This type of instruction is typical in constitutional cases, and is no more
vague than instructions that delineate for juries the standards and factors to
consider in determining whether a search or seizure is &quot;reasonable&quot; or
whether prison officials' actions violate &quot;contemporary standards of
decency&quot;; see Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 8 (1992) (quoting Estelle v.
Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976)).  The fact that juries must draw lines in
virtually all cases involving constitutional rights does not invalidate their
judgments so long as the instructions as a whole give them accurate and
sufficient guidance with respect to the essential elements of the crime.<SUP>14</SUP>
 See Baker v. Delo, 38 F.3d 1024, 1026 (8th Cir. 1994)(no plain error in jury
instruction on excessive force); United States v. Reese, 2 F.3d at 880-87
(upholding specific intent and excessive force instructions); United States v.
Bigham, 812 F.2d 943, 948-49 (5th Cir. 1987)(rejecting challenge to jury charge
in &#167;242 assault prosecution where excessiveness was not an issue because no
force was justified under the circumstances); United States v. Dise, 763 F.2d at
589-92 (affirming sufficiency of &#167;242 charge on willfulness and freedom
from bodily restraint).  Compare Romano v. Howarth, 998 F.2d 101, 106 (2d Cir.
1993)(instruction on defendants' state of mind in Eighth Amendment excessive
force case which simply told jury to &quot;look to all the surrounding
circumstances&quot; did not give  adequate guidance).<SUP>15</SUP></P>
<P>Second, the &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; language added to the
instruction in this case helped rather than hurt the defendant by narrowing the
range of bodily invasions or sexual assaults for which he could be convicted. 
Read in context, as it must be, the &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; reference
was plainly intended to reinforce the notion, stated earlier in the same
sentence, that defendant's conduct was required to be &quot;serious and
substantial&quot; in order to violate the right of bodily integrity, and that
this requirement was not to be taken lightly.  Because the &quot;shocking to
one's conscience&quot; modifier at the end of the instruction on bodily
integrity reduced rather than expanded the likelihood of conviction, Lanier
cannot credibly complain about it; indeed, he did not even object to the
instruction at trial, perhaps for precisely this reason.  For the future, trial
courts might be well advised to avoid the &quot;conscience-shocking&quot;
language altogether in jury instructions, certainly where sexual coercion is
involved; but in this case, its inclusion is hardly grounds for reversal.<SUP>16</SUP></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>IV.  THE DEFENDANT'S ACTIONS ALSO VIOLATED THE EQUAL
PROTECTION CLAUSE</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Although the Justice Department prosecuted Lanier only on substantive due
process grounds, and cannot change its theoretical horses in midstream, this
Court should make clear that on the facts as found by the jury, Lanier's conduct
also constituted sexual harassment in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. 
Physically abusive, quid pro quo sexual harassment, particularly of the
repellent and persistent nature manifested in this case, undoubtedly constitutes
sex discrimination.  See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. ,  , 114
S.Ct. 367, 370-71 (1993); Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64
(1986).  Putting aside differences not relevant here, the standard for sex
discrimination is fundamentally the same whether under 42 U.S.C. &#167;2000e,
the statute at issue in Harris and Vinson, or under the Equal Protection Clause.<SUP>17</SUP></P>
<P>This Court has repeatedly recognized that constitutional rights are not
limited to one per customer.  See Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U.S. 56, 70 (1992)(&quot;[c]ertain
wrongs affect more than a single right and, accordingly, can implicate more than
one of the Constitution's commands&quot;); United States v. James Daniel Good
Real Property, 510 U.S.   ,  , 114 S.Ct. 492, 499 (1993)(&quot;[w]e have
rejected the view that the applicability of one constitutional amendment
preempts the guarantees of another&quot;). The only exception to this principle
appears to be where, as in Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, a specific
constitutional provision sets an objective standard of conduct (there, &quot;reasonableness&quot;)
to guide government officials, which is preferable to the less definitive and
objective standard underlying substantive due process.  See Albright v. Oliver,
114 S.Ct. at 820 (Souter, J., concurring).</P>
<P>In the present case, however, in contrast to Graham, two wholly separate
constitutional principles give rise to two wholly separate types of
constitutional harm.  Lanier's assaults and demands for sex as a condition of
employment or fair treatment in court violated the women's personal autonomy in
the most intimate part of their lives, see &#167;II, supra, but they also
deprived the women of their ability to work or otherwise interact with
government officials free of sex-discriminatory hostility and abuse.  The latter
rights are dignitary rather than physical; they relate to fairness, equality,
and economic opportunity rather than sexual privacy and bodily harm.  They have
fundamentally different constitutional roots and thus form a separate ground for
liability under equal protection principles.</P>

<P>1. The entire charge, in relevant part, read:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Each count in this indictment charges the defendant deprived the victim
named in that count of her right not to be deprived of liberty without due
process of law, specifically her right to be free from willful sexual assault. 
The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution guarantees that no person can be
deprived of liberty by the government without due process of law.  Included in
the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment is the concept of personal
bodily integrity and the right to be free of unauthorized and unlawful physical
abuse by state intrusion. Thus, this protected right of liberty provides that no
person shall be subject to physical or bodily abuse without lawful justification
by a state official acting or claiming to act under the color of the laws of any
state of the United States when that official's conduct is so demeaning and
harmful under all the circumstances as to shock one's conscious [sic].  Freedom
from such physical abuse includes the right to be free from certain sexually
motivated physical assaults and coerced sexual battery.  It is not, however,
every unjustified touching or grabbing by a state official that constitutes a
violation of a person's constitutional rights.  The physical abuse must be of a
serious and substantial nature that involves physical force, mental coercion,
bodily injury or emotional damage which is shocking to one's conscious [sic].</P>
<P>In making this determination, you should consider the nature and the
duration of the alleged abuse, the reason or motivation for any physical
contact, the context in which the alleged events occurred, intimidation or
force, the extent of any injuries and the effect of the defendant's alleged
action.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Tr. 1876-77.</P>
<P>2. Specific intent under Screws does not mean that the defendant must have
had in mind the precise constitutional provision[s] that he was infringing, but
that he &quot;at least act[ed] in reckless disregard of constitutional
prohibitions or guarantees.&quot;  325 U.S. at 106.  See United States v. Reese,
2 F.3d 870, 881, 885 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 928 (1994)(citing
United States v. Ehrlichman, 546 F.2d 910, 921 (D.C. Cir. 1976), cert. denied,
429 U.S. 1120 (1977)); United States v. Dise, 763 F.2d 586, 588-89 (3d Cir.),
cert. denied, 474 U.S. 982 (1985).</P>
<P>3. See also Doe v. Taylor Independent School Dist., 15 F.3d 443, 455 (5th
Cir.)(en banc), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 70 (1994)(&quot;`[t]here has never been
a section 1983 case accusing welfare officials of selling foster children into
slavery; it does not follow that if such a case arose, the officials would be
immune from damages liability'&quot;)(quoting K.H. ex rel. Murphy v. Morgan, 914
F.2d 846, 851 (7th Cir. 1990)).</P>
<P>4. Many post-Johnson v. Glick cases would now be litigated under the Fourth
Amendment's &quot;reasonableness&quot; standard (for pre-arrest investigatory
seizures), or the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause (for
post-conviction excessive force claims). See Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396
&amp; n.10 (1989); Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 327 (1986).  Post-arrest but
pre-conviction brutality claims continue to be analyzed under the Due Process
Clause, see Graham, 490 U.S. at 396 n.10, as do excessive force claims where the
government officers' pre-arrest conduct does not amount to a seizure.  See Bella
v. Chamberlain, 24 F.3d 1251, 1257 (10th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 898
(1995); Landol-Rivera v. Cruz Cosme, 906 F.2d 791, 796 (1st Cir. 1990); Wilson
v. Northcutt, 987 F.2d at 722.</P>
<P>5. Even under the view of substantive due process articulated by this Court
in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 191-92 (1986), the right to be free from
serious sexual abuse committed by government officials is surely &quot;implicit
in the concept of ordered liberty,&quot; and &quot;deeply rooted in the Nation's
history and tradition.&quot;</P>
<P>6. The Court meanwhile has continued to recognize that physical brutality,
excessive confinement, and forced medical interventions, whether or not sexual
in nature, may also violate substantive due process.  See Graham v. Connor, 490
U.S. at 396 n.10 (excessive force in non-seizure or post-seizure situations
remains subject to Due Process Clause); Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 673
(1977)(corporal punishment implicates due process); Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S.
307, 315-16 (1982) (involuntary confinement); Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dep't
of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 278 (1990)(medical self-determination); Washington v.
Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 221-22 (1990)(forced drug treatment).</P>
<P>7. The teacher allegedly &quot;fondled and kissed [a student's] breasts,
inserted his fingers into her vagina, exposed himself to her and forced her to
handle his genitals, and occasionally compelled her to have oral sex.&quot; 
Stoneking v. Bradford Area School Dist., 856 F.2d 594, 599 n.8 (3d Cir. 1988)(&quot;Stoneking
I&quot;), vacated on other grounds, 489 U.S.1062 (1989).</P>
<P>8. The oft-quoted language from Johnson reads:  &quot;Not every push or
shove, even if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge's chambers,
violates a prisoner's constitutional rights.  In determining whether the
constitutional line has been crossed, a court must look to such factors as the
need and the amount of force that was used, the extent of injury inflicted, and
whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore
discipline, or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing
harm.&quot;  481 F.2d at 1033.</P>
<P>9. The same is true of the Fourteenth Amendment liberty interests in medical
autonomy and freedom from involuntary confinement.  See n.6, supra.</P>
<P>10. Gumz, which applied a variant of the Johnson v. Glick factors to an
excessive force/arrest claim, was overruled on the basis of Graham v. Connor in
Lester v. City of Chicago, 830 F.2d 706 (7th Cir. 1987).</P>
<P>11. See also Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358 (1983); Bouie v. City of
Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 362-63 (1964).</P>
<P>12. See Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U.S. 141, 146-47 (1973); United States v.
Reese, 2 F.3d at 883 (&quot;the district court's formulation of [the elements of
a statutory crime] is reviewed for abuse of discretion . . . . An abuse of
discretion in this context occurs where the jury instructions taken as a whole
are misleading or inadequate to guide the jury's deliberations&quot;); Martin v.
Thomas, 973 F.2d 449, 454 (5th Cir. 1992)(&quot;[o]n appeal, we review the
charge as a whole and reverse only if the jury is misled as to the substantive
law&quot;).</P>
<P>13. The jurors were told to consider &quot;the nature and the duration of
the alleged abuse, the reason or motivation for any physical contact, the
context in which the alleged events occurred, intimidation or force, the extent
of any injuries and the effect of the defendant's alleged action.&quot;  Tr.
1877.</P>
<P>14. This does not mean, of course, that in some cases a judgment could not
be reversed for insufficient evidence -- a decidedly different matter than
invalidating a jury charge or the constitutional standard it articulates. 
Because the majority below rejected the prosecution's reliance on a substantive
due process theory, it never addressed the sufficiency of the evidence.  Nor
does this brief.  However, if the jury charge in this case is sustained, then it
is also fair to assume that the jury found that defendant's conduct was both
willful, and sufficiently serious and substantial, to justify conviction on 7
out of 11 counts in the indictment.</P>
<P>15. For typical jury instructions in civil rights cases, see 2 Devitt,
Blackmar &amp; O'Malley, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions &#167;27.07 (4th
ed. 1987 &amp; Supp. 1996)(criminal cases); and 3 Devitt, Blackmar &amp; Wolff,
Federal Jury Practice and Instructions &#167;&#167;103.01-.08 (4th ed. 1987 &amp;
Supp. 1996)(civil cases).  As the Court in Reese points out, constitutional
standards articulated in &#167;1983 civil suits may appropriately be used in &#167;242
criminal cases, 2 F.3d at 884; see also United States v. Bigham, 812 F.2d at 948
(though level of culpable intent varies, same substantive standard applies to
deprivation of rights under &#167;1983 and &#167;242).</P>
<P>16. If the Court believes that the instruction, taken as a whole, does
require reversal, then remand for a new trial rather than dismissal of the
charges is the appropriate remedy.</P>
<P>17. See, e.g., Annis v. County of Westchester, 36 F.3d 251, 254 (2d Cir.
1994); Andrews v. City of Philadelphia, 895 F.2d 1469, 1478-79, 1483 &amp; n.4
(3d Cir. 1990); Starrett v. Wadley, 876 F.2d 808, 814 (10th Cir. 1989).  For 42
U.S.C. &#167;1983 sexual harassment cases before 1989, see Lipsett v. University
of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881 (1st Cir. 1988); Bohen v. City of East Chicago, 799
F.2d 1180 (7th Cir. 1986); and other cases cited in Starrett, 876 F.2d at 814.</P>

<h4>	INTEREST OF THE <i>AMICI</i>
</h4>
<p>	Amici are a variety of bar associations and other organizations from across the country that are deeply concerned with and affected by Colorado's Amendment 2.  Amici include the State Bar of Arizona, Colorado Bar Association, Connecticut Bar Association, Delaware State Bar Association, The Florida Association of Women Lawyers, Illinois State Bar Association, Kansas Bar Association, Maine State Bar Association, Massachusetts Bar Association, Minnesota Women Lawyers, State Bar of Montana, Women's Law Section, New Jersey State Bar Association, The New Mexico Women's Bar Association, New York County Lawyers' Association, Oregon State Bar, Vermont Bar Association, and the State Bar of Wisconsin, Individual Rights Section.  Each bar association amicus has a strong interest in ensuring its ability to adopt and enforce, or to support the adoption and enforcement of, ethical canons and codes of professional conduct prohibiting discrimination of all kinds in the judicial process and in the provision of legal services.  The discriminatory effects of enactments like Colorado's Amendment 2 directly threaten these interests by prohibiting bar associations and their members from adopting and enforcing anti-discrimination provisions in their respective states and, in the case of integrated bar associations, from adopting and enforcing such measures within the associations themselves. 
</p>
<p>	Amici also include several national organizations dedicated to the preservation of open and effective government, the protection of civil and constitutional rights, and the adoption and enforcement of laws prohibiting arbitrary discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  The national amicus organizations include the Society of American Law Teachers, Common Cause and People for the American Way.
</p>
<p>	Amici have the consent of the parties to file this brief.  Letters of consent have been filed separately in this Court.  A complete list of amici and their statements of interest are set forth in Appendix A.  
</p>
<h4>	INTRODUCTION
</h4>
<p>	Blacks and Jews, along with farmers, smokers, joggers and redheads, can seek protection against discrimination from the Colorado legislature, executive departments, courts and the many state and local &quot;agencies, branches, subdivisions and departments&quot; that exercise governmental power.  As a result of Amendment 2, lesbians and gay men cannot.  The question presented by this case is whether it is constitutional for Colorado to reconfigure the process of government in this fashion.
</p>
<p>	For petitioners that is an easy question:  States possess the power to organize their political system in any manner a majority of their citizens support on any issue, provided only that no one is denied the vote and that the rights of certain constitutionally recognized &quot;suspect classes&quot; are protected.  Any other result, say petitioners, would not only infringe upon a state's prerogatives in our federal system, but would propel the process of popular government down a hopelessly slippery slope of special interest challenges to majority rights.
</p>
<p>	Amici submit that this argument is fundamentally misdirected.  This lawsuit is not about slippery slopes, but about level playing fields.  It is not about the right of the people of Colorado, acting through established channels of political expression and representation, to enact or refuse to enact legislation on particular issues.  Rather, it is about their asserted right to place roadblocks in the path of particular individuals in order to impede their ability to participate on even terms in the process by which political issues are adjudicated.
</p>
<p>	No &quot;breathtaking&quot;  or &quot;revolutionary&quot;  principles need be established to protect the right to a fair political process.  Nor does its recognition do &quot;profound violence&quot;  to the majority's right to allocate governmental power and to prevail after a fair fight.  To the contrary, equality of participation in the political process is inherent in the concept of equal protection and should be far less controversial than the often divisive &quot;class&quot;-based analysis that is central to much equal protection jurisprudence.
</p>
<h4>	SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
</h4>
<p>	1.	The political branches ordinarily control the division and exercise of governmental power and resources.  So long as the process of government is not compromised, courts rarely have a role to play in second-guessing the judgments of the people or their elected representatives.  However, where the process itself &quot;malfunctions,&quot; the basic premise of political legitimacy is called into question and a more active form of judicial review is necessary.  See John H. Ely, Democracy and Distrust 103 (1980).
</p>
<p>	2.	There are two principal situations in which such a malfunction occurs.  The first is where laws disadvantage &quot;discrete and insular minorities.&quot;  The second is where legislation &quot;restricts [the] political process[]&quot; itself.  United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938).  The former may be a more familiar aspect of equal protection jurisprudence, but it is no more important on that account.  Indeed, if anything can be said to be inherent in the concept of equal protection, it is that the ordinary channels for seeking &quot;protection of the laws&quot; should remain open to all on an equal basis.  Specifically, amici submit that under the Equal Protection Clause states may not deny particular individuals equal access to the regularly-established, ongoing processes of government.  
</p>
<p>	3.	The right of citizens to participate in those processes on an equal footing  the right to vote, the right to be represented in a republican form of government, the right to seek legislation or petition the government for redress of grievances  is a core democratic value that has been &quot;inferred&quot; from the structure and traditions of our democratic system.  See, e.g., Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 562 (1964).  That right is not defined, but effectuated, by the right to cast an effective ballot.  Id. at 565.  
</p>
<p>	4.	Equal political participation can be denied not only by interference with the right to vote, but also by interference with the structure of the legislative process.  Creating a two-tier system in which a class of people is singled out and subjected to a more onerous process for seeking to protect their interests violates those individuals' rights to equal protection to the same extent as laws diluting the effectiveness of particular citizens' votes.  Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 391 (1969); Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 568.
</p>
<p>	5.	The right to a fair political process is entirely separate from the outcome of that process.  Government action typically benefits some people while burdening others.  It is precisely because this is so that states are prohibited from disabling any particular group of people from equal access to the process by which the political distribution of such burdens and benefits is resolved.  Laws dealing with a particular issue (e.g., fair housing or trout fishing) do not raise an equal protection issue merely because they disproportionately affect particular individuals.  On the other hand, a law which on its face simply makes it harder for a certain identified class of people to participate in the process of day-to-day government stands on a very different constitutional footing.  Such an arrangement offends equal protection of the laws regardless of whether those whom it subordinates are a so-called &quot;suspect class.&quot;  
</p>
<p>	6.	The right of individuals to equal participation in the political process is not at stake where the disadvantaged class can be identified only by reference to its position on a particular matter.  The concept of an &quot;independently identifiable group&quot; neatly captures the notion that equal protection extends to individuals who are identifiable apart from their views on a particular issue.  Thus, a law making employment rights generally a matter of state, rather than local, concern would not deny equal protection, whereas a law making the employment rights of smokers or people with blue eyes a matter of exclusive state concern would.
</p>
<p>	7.	Petitioners err in asserting that the right to equal process is excessively broad, or that recognizing it would fundamentally reorder the relationship between majority and minority rights.  To the contrary, recognizing that everyone has a claim to participate on equal terms in seeking the protection of the laws will have no effect upon the vast majority of legislation (and other governmental action) which has nothing to do with process.  Moreover, nothing prohibits a state from allocating power as it sees fit so long as it does not do so in a manner that singles out particular citizens and makes it more difficult for them, alone, to achieve political success. 
</p>
<h4>	ARGUMENT
</h4>
<h4>I. EQUAL ACCESS TO THE POLITICAL PROCESS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM.
</h4>
<p>	Amici and petitioners begin at a common point:  Our constitutional system relies principally upon the electorate and the political branches of government to make decisions and determine policy  to allocate benefits and impose burdens.  Within broad limits, the courts have only a minimal role to play in superintending the decisions of these political branches.  The fact that the government &quot;sometimes generates outcomes with which we disagree&quot; does not give rise to a claim for judicial intervention.  See Ely, supra, at 103.
</p>
<p>	However, the assumption on which this &quot;default system&quot; operates is that the institutions of government are structured and function &quot;so as to represent fairly all of the people.&quot;  Id. at 117 (quoting Kramer v. Union Free School Dist. No. 15, 395 U.S. 621, 627-28 (1969)).  When that assumption does not hold, i.e., &quot;when the challenge . . . is in effect a challenge [to] this basic assumption&quot; itself, the &quot;assumption can no longer serve as the basis for presuming constitutionality.&quot;  Id.
</p>
<p>	There are essentially two such situations.  They are the ones identified by Justice Stone in his famous footnote four in Carolene Products:
</p>
<p><blockquote>	It is unnecessary to consider now whether legislation which restricts those political processes which can ordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation, is to be subjected to more exacting judicial scrutiny under the general prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment than are most other types of legislation. . . .
</p>
<p>	Nor need we enquire whether similar considerations enter into the review of statutes directed at particular religious . . . or national . . . or racial minorities . . . whether prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities, and which may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry.</blockquote></p>
<p>
304 U.S. at 152 n.4 (citations omitted).
</p>
<p>	Stone's concern with laws that disadvantage &quot;discrete and insular minorities&quot;  what are now more commonly referred to as &quot;suspect classes&quot;  has become a primary focus of equal protection jurisprudence.  However, his concern about &quot;legislation which restricts the political processes&quot; is equally important. 
</p>
<p>	The notion that constitutional government rests on the fairness of the political process is scarcely novel, or recent.  In fact, the particular genius of James Madison and the other architects of the Constitution was to focus intently upon the process by which successive governments would be selected and, once chosen, how they would represent the people who elected them.  See Ely, supra, at 77-82.
</p>
<p>	The cornerstone of the system created by the framers, of course, is the principle of majority rule.  Indeed, one of the driving factors behind the American Revolution was the perceived tyranny of English rule in which power was exercised by a few, from afar.  However, the framers also recognized that tyranny could be imposed on minorities by the majority.  As Hamilton put it succinctly in the ratification debates:  &quot;Give all power to the many, they will oppress the few.  Give all power to the few, they will oppress the many.&quot;   See also The Federalist No. 51, at 323 (James Madison) (Mentor ed., 1961) (&quot;It is of great importance . . . not only to guard the society against the oppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of the society against the injustice of the other part.&quot;).
</p>
<p>	The framers understood that unfettered exercise of majority will, especially at the point of fashioning constitutive arrangements governing day-to-day affairs,  would not only jeopardize the rights of minorities, it would threaten the integrity and stability of our constitutional system.  Obviously, a majority could use its numerical power to grant unequal benefits to itself or impose unequal burdens on a minority.  Even more dangerous, however, was the possibility that a majority would fix the very process of government to ensure its own perpetual dominance or at least the perpetual subordination of a disfavored minority.  See Robert Dahl, A Preface to Democratic Theory 11-17 (1956). 
</p>
<p>	Hence, a central preoccupation of the constitutional debates was how to prevent these temporary majorities from restricting or foreclosing the political prospects of minorities.  See The Federalist No. 10 (James Madison).  The solution has been described as &quot;a compromise between the power of majorities and the power of minorities, between the political equality of all adult citizens on the one side and the desire to limit their sovereignty on the other.&quot;  Dahl, supra, at 4.  
</p>
<p>	One of the most important means used by the framers to mediate between majority and minority interests was to structure a political process that would be duly responsive to each.  As Dean Ely describes the outcome of that compromise, the Constitution leaves</p>
<p><blockquote> the selection and accommodation of substantive values . . . almost entirely to the political process . . . . [T]he document is overwhelmingly concerned, on the one hand, with procedural fairness in the resolution of individual disputes (process writ small), and on the other, with . . . process writ large  with ensuring broad participation in the processes and distributions of government.</blockquote></p>
<p>Ely, supra, at 87 (citations omitted).
</p>
<p>	The framers also believed that they could keep majorities from abusing minorities by assuring that the tools of power were both indirect and decentralized.  A decentralized, representative system would protect minorities because majorities would be coalitions of various smaller groups that would be apt to change often as different issues took on relatively greater importance.  The need to build coalitions also would lead to compromise as groups would agree to make concessions on one issue in order to gain support for another.  
</p>
<p>	However clear the framers' goals may have been, implementing them was another matter.  Id. at 80-81.  By the mid-nineteenth century, it had become increasingly evident that these mechanisms were not sufficient to protect minority interests since majorities tended to endure and representatives often failed to represent minority interests.  Therefore, some greater measure of protection was necessary to ensure that government would not simply ignore minority rights.
</p>
<p>	The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment reflects the most important attempt to resolve this continuing dilemma.  At its most basic level, the Clause commands the States to represent the interests of minorities (as well as majorities) by extending to all persons the equal protection of the laws.  As Justice Jackson put it in his famous concurrence in Railway Express Agency v. New York, 336 U.S. 106, 112 (1949), &quot;there is no more effective guaranty against arbitrary and unreasonable government than to require that the principles of law which officials would impose upon a minority must be imposed generally.&quot;  See also Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dep't of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 300 (1990) (&quot;the Equal Protection Clause . . . requires the democratic majority to accept for themselves and their loved ones what they impose on you and me.&quot;) (Scalia, J., concurring).  These formulations suggest  as does the very language of the clause, &quot;equal protection of the laws,&quot; not &quot;protection of equal laws&quot;  a concern with process and structure at least as much as with substance or outcomes.

<p>	This case, also, is about process rather than outcomes.  The central vice of Amendment 2 is that it creates a permanent structural alteration of the process of government in Colorado for gay men, lesbians and bisexuals.  Only they must clear a unique hurdle  a constitutional amendment  to secure protection against discrimination.  
</p>
<p>	That is a &quot;malfunction&quot; of government which undermines the &quot;basic assumption&quot; upon which deference to the political process rests.  In Dean Ely's words, the political process is &quot;undeserving of trust&quot; when </p>
<p><blockquote>
(1) the ins are choking off the channels of 
political change to ensure that they will stay in and the outs will stay out, or (2) though no one is actually denied a voice or a vote, representatives beholden to an effective majority are systematically disadvantaging some minority out of simple hostility or a prejudiced refusal to recognize commonalities of interest, and thereby denying that minority the protection afforded other groups by a representative system.</blockquote></p>
<p>
Ely, supra, at 103.  In such a circumstance, a &quot;more searching&quot; judicial review is not merely appropriate, it is necessary.  In fact, such review is not only a function well-suited &quot;to the capabilities of the courts,&quot; but is also one &quot;which will not likely be performed elsewhere if the courts do not assume it.&quot;  Alexander Bickel, The Least Dangerous Branch 24 (1962).
</p>
<h4>II. THIS COURT HAS RECOGNIZED A RIGHT OF EQUAL POLITICAL PARTICIPATION WHICH INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, THE RIGHT TO VOTE.
</h4>
<p> 	The right to vote has been identified as a critical aspect of the right to effective political participation.  This Court has considered various aspects of that right, including vote dilution,  ballot access restrictions,  gerrymandering,  and voter qualifications,  among others.  However, the Court also has expressed unmistakable concern with efforts to corrupt the political process by creating a two-tier legislative structure in which certain individuals must traverse a more burdensome path to advance or protect their interests.  See, e.g., Hunter, 393 U.S. at 389-91; Washington v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 474 75 (1982).
</p>
<blockquote><h4>A. 	The Right to Vote Is Part of a Broader Right.
</h4></blockquote>
<p>	Petitioners contend that the Colorado Supreme Court erred in concluding that there is a right of political participation that extends beyond the &quot;right to vote,&quot; as such.  (Pet. Br. at 25-28.)  But that excessively narrow reading simply is not sustainable.  It ignores not only the language and holdings of specific cases, but also the articulated premises on which they rest.
</p>
<p>	If the right to vote were the only aspect of political participation protected by the Equal Protection Clause, it would have been sufficient to stop with cases like Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections, 383 U.S. 663 (1966), Carrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89 (1965), and Kramer, 395 U.S. 621 (1969), in which certain individuals literally were &quot;fenced out&quot; of the political process by being denied the franchise.  The Court, however, has made it clear that equal protection in the political process demands more than mere access to a voting booth.  Indeed, as the Colorado Supreme Court observed, in cases such as Reynolds v. Sims no one was denied the vote.  Evans v. Romer, 854 P.2d 1270, 1277-78 (Colo. 1993) (en banc).  Rather, the equal protection issue was presented by the inability of certain citizens to have an equal and effective opportunity to influence the outcome of the legislative process because of the way electoral districts were drawn.   Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 561-68.  
</p>
<p>	In fact, Reynolds directly refutes petitioners' claim that &quot;voting&quot; is the end-point right, rather than being supportive of a broader right to effective participation through equal process.  The Court scarcely could have been more explicit:
</p>
<p><blockquote>	[E]ach and every citizen has an inalienable right to full and effective participation in the political processes of his State's legislative bodies.  Most citizens can achieve this participation only as qualified voters . . . . Full and effective participation by all citizens in state government requires, therefore, that each citizen have an equally effective voice in the election of members of his state legislature.</blockquote></p>
<p>
377 U.S. at 565 (emphasis added); see also Board of Estimate v. Morris, 489 U.S. 688, 701 (1989) (aim of equal protection is to provide fair and effective representation for all citizens); Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 30 (1968) (all qualified voters have the right &quot;to cast their votes effectively&quot;); Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 141-42 (1971). 
</p>
<p>	Not only are petitioners mistaken about the existence (and dimension) of a political participation right, they overlook the fact that this right is rooted in the very majoritarian principles upon which they rely.  In fact, assuring effective participation by all citizens in the process of government makes true majority rule possible and reinforces its legitimacy. 
</p>
<p>	In short, voting is not merely an end in itself, but is one of the means by which the broader right to fair process is effectuated.  There is no principled reason why &quot;all people, one process&quot; is not as much a part of equal protection as &quot;one person, one vote.&quot;
</p>
<blockquote><b>B. 	Principles Recognized by This Court in Hunter, Seattle School District and Gordon Support the Existence of a Right to Equal Participation in the Political Process.
</b></blockquote>
<p>	Amendment 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause because it purposefully restricts effective access by gays, lesbians and bisexuals to the regular channels through which anti-discrimination and other political interests normally are pursued in our republican system of government.  It does that in much the same way that malapportioned state legislatures once created a &quot;legislative straight jacket&quot;  for residents of more populous districts:  by jiggering the process and thereby, in Judge Leventhal's words, &quot;keeping the 'ins' in and the 'outs' out.&quot;  Harold Leventhal, Courts and Political Thickets, 77 Colum. L. Rev. 345, 380 (1977).
</p>
<p>	Colorado seemingly does not take issue with this characterization.  In fact, its brief all but concedes that if Asians or Catholics were substituted for homosexuals, lesbians and bisexuals in Amendment 2 it would be unconstitutional, without more, under cases such as Hunter and Seattle School District.  The difference, say petitioners, is that the Fourteenth Amendment has a special solicitude for, e.g., Asians and Catholics that it does not extend to other socially-identified groups, such as gays and lesbians, the elderly or the disabled.
</p>
<p>	We believe that this argument should be rejected as applied to the right to participate equally in the political process.  The proposition that government may not place extra obstacles in the path of any particular group of citizens in seeking to advance their political interests is hardly a radical notion.  To the contrary, it appeals to the very idea of equality of opportunity  not outcome  that democratic government and equal protection of the laws embody.  See supra pp. ____.  It should be far less controversial than Justice Stone's alternative paradigm of &quot;discrete and insular&quot; minorities, which can invite the type of resentment that often accompanies such class-based differentiation.  See, e.g., Michael J. Klarman, The Puzzling Resistance to Political Process Theory, 77 Va. L. Rev. 747, 748, 783 (1991) (a political process theory that relies solely on the &quot;access&quot; prong of Carolene Products &quot;can avoid controversial value choices in identifying appropriate occasions for judicial review&quot;).
</p>
<p>	The decision below does not represent a radical departure from established constitutional principles.  To the contrary, it is a legitimate heir to Justice Harlan's concurrence in Hunter v. Erickson, in which he identified the absence of a &quot;neutral principle&quot; for affording access to the political process as the critical vice which rendered Akron's city charter amendment constitutionally infirm under the Equal Protection Clause.  Petitioners' bald assertions notwithstanding, both Hunter and Seattle School District are explicable in process, as well as &quot;suspect class,&quot; terms, as the decision below properly points out.  Evans, 854 P.2d at 1279-81.  Thus, for example, Hunter focused substantial attention on Akron's selective deviation from neutral principles in its city charter amendment by &quot;plac[ing] special burdens on racial minorities within the governmental process.&quot;  393 U.S. at 391. 
</p>
<p>	The same observations can be made about Amendment 2.  It places &quot;special burdens&quot; upon a particular group of individuals (&quot;minorit[y]&quot;) in the &quot;governmental process.&quot;  Thus, the sole question is whether the racial character of the group singled out in Hunter was critical to the result.  While some parts of the opinion undeniably focus on that fact, petitioners unfairly denigrate this Court's articulation of a broader principle that, if applied here without the slightest alteration, would be dispositive of this case.  As Justice White stated for the Court, while Akron unquestionably was free to require plebiscites generally it could</p>
<blockquote><p> no more disadvantage any particular group 
by making it more difficult to enact legislation in its behalf than it may dilute any person's vote or give any group a smaller representation than another of comparable size.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Hunter, 393 U.S. at 393 (citations omitted).
</p>
<p>	That observation is particularly significant in light of Justice Harlan's concurrence.  His opinion carefully delineated the broad latitude enjoyed by state and local governments to disadvantage particular groups (even specially protected &quot;suspect&quot; ones) with regard to the outcome of the legislative process.  Id. at 393-95.  The Akron charter amendment, however, was not directed at outcomes.  More fundamentally, it was not grounded in the kind of &quot;neutral principles&quot; that alone ensure &quot;a just framework within which the diverse political groups in our society may fairly compete.&quot;  Id. at 393.  Instead, the Akron law simply disadvantaged certain citizens seeking to protect their basic political interests against discrimination.
</p>
<p>	Nearly fifteen years later, in the Seattle School District case, the Court identified Justice Harlan's &quot;neutral principles&quot; formulation as the &quot;simple but central principle&quot; underlying Hunter.  458 U.S. at 469-70.  The initiative at issue in that case also was directed at racial minorities and the Court discussed that fact at length.  However, as it did in Hunter, the Court described the vice of the law in more general terms.  Specifically, the opinion noted that laws which &quot;make it more difficult for every group in the community to enact comparable laws . . . 'provid[e] a just framework within which the diverse political groups in our society may fairly compete.'&quot;  Id. at 470.  Washington's initiative, however, did &quot;'not attemp[t] to allocate governmental power on the basis of any general principle'&quot; but, rather, simply burdened the rights of specific citizens.  Id. (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 395 (Harlan, J., concurring)).  
</p>
<p>	Two additional cases, decided within six weeks of each other, further illuminate these issues.  In James v. Valtierra, 402 U.S. 137 (1971), the Court upheld a California referendum that required local voters to approve new low-income public housing projects.  In so doing, the Court declined to extend the category of suspect classes to encompass low-income people pursuing their political interest in taxpayer-financed housing.  Shortly thereafter, in Gordon v. Lance, 403 U.S. 1 (1971), the Court upheld constitutional and statutory provisions requiring super-majority approval of increases in bonded indebtedness after concluding that  unlike Hunter  the West Virginia provisions &quot;applied equally to all bond issues for any purpose&quot; and did not burden the rights of any &quot;independently identifiable group.&quot;  Id. at 5.  The majority in the Colorado Supreme Court interpreted Gordon as having adopted a neutral principles view of Hunter.  Evans, 854 P.2d at 1281-82.  By contrast, both the dissent and petitioners claim that James is controlling, whereas Gordon is irrelevant.  See Pet. Br. at 21-22, 23 n.13; Evans, 854 P.2d at 1298-99 (Erickson, J., dissenting).
</p>
<p>	Plainly, James approached Hunter as a &quot;suspect class&quot; case and declined appellee's invitation to apply heightened scrutiny to a &quot;class&quot; of low-income residents.  That was how the parties briefed and presented the issue to the Court.   The Court was not asked to consider the application of any political process right.  Thus, the invitation which amici ask the Court to accept here  to embrace Hunter's concern with process-based discrimination  simply was not extended in James.
</p>
<p>	Gordon involved no race, or other suspect class, issue.  In fact, it was decided by the West Virginia Supreme Court solely as a voting case controlled by decisions such as Reynolds, Kramer, and Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1 (1964).  See Lance v. Board of Educ., 170 S.E.2d 783, 786-90 (W. Va. 1969).  Hunter was not even mentioned.
</p>
<p>	This Court found the voting cases unpersuasive.  See Gordon, 403 U.S. at 4-5.  Instead, the Court analyzed the issues under Hunter. That would have been peculiar if petitioners' characterization of James were correct since, under their approach, Hunter would have been utterly irrelevant.   Thus, the Court's focus on Hunter, at a minimum, acknowledges that Hunter and Gordon are part of the same &quot;family&quot; of cases.  Since Gordon plainly had nothing to do with race, the perceived relationship must turn on the right of political participation.
</p>
<p>	The Court distinguished Hunter on the ground that the West Virginia law, unlike Akron's city charter amendment, &quot;applie[d] equally to all bond issues for any purpose&quot; and did not &quot;single[] out&quot; any particular group for unique disadvantages in the political process.  Id. at 5.  Thus, the Court observed that it could &quot;discern no independently identifiable group or category that favors bonded indebtedness over other forms of financing.  Consequently, no sector of the population may be said to be 'fenced out' from the franchise because of the way they will vote.&quot;  Id. (emphasis added).  Under those circumstances, the Court held that equal protection was not violated.
</p>
<p>	While Gordon referred to the fact that the ordinance in Hunter involved a racial classification, nothing in its analysis turned on that observation.  Rather, the Court's suggestion that the West Virginia provisions would have been held unconstitutional if there had been some &quot;independently identifiable group&quot; that &quot;favor[ed] bonded indebtedness&quot; strongly implies that the critical issue for constitutional purposes was the existence vel non of discrimination against a particular group, not whether the group discriminated against was entitled to special consideration under the Equal Protection Clause.  See id.  That implication was made manifest two pages later in the Court's statement of the controlling constitutional principle:  &quot;We conclude that so long as [laws] do not discriminate against or authorize discrimination against any identifiable class they do not violate the Equal Protection Clause.&quot;  Id. at 7 (emphasis added). 
</p>
<p>	Amici do not claim that Gordon is controlling here.  What we contend is that this Court has recognized the importance of maintaining equal access to the process of government and that this case falls squarely within the category of constitutional wrongs  identified by the Court in Hunter and confirmed by it in Gordon and Seattle School District  in which the fatal vice is the absence of a &quot;neutral principle&quot; for configuring access to the political process. 
</p>
<h4>III. AMENDMENT 2 VIOLATES THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE BY DEPRIVING AN INDEPENDENTLY IDENTIFIABLE GROUP OF CITIZENS OF EQUAL PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCESSES OF GOVERNMENT.
</h4>
<p>	In addition to denying the existence of a right of political participation, petitioners contend that states are free to allocate governmental authority and jurisdiction as they see fit with respect to any &quot;issue.&quot;  Pet. Br. at 11, 26, 27.  Thus, for example, petitioners suggest that the Constitution does not prevent a state from making such issues as education or employment rights matters of statewide, as opposed to local, jurisdiction.  Pet. Br. at 28, 31.  Similarly, on their view, a law banning smoking or hunting is not subject to constitutional challenge merely because it disadvantages individuals who wish to smoke or hunt.
</p>
<p>	Amici do not quarrel with those propositions.  However, Amendment 2 is not about issues and it is not about outcomes.  It is about the rights of people, to wit, gay men, lesbians and bisexuals, and about erecting obstacles which selectively disable them from effectively protecting their legal interests through the process of government.  That is a far different, and narrower, right than petitioners' unhelpful caricature of the decision below suggests. 
</p>
<p>	Specifically, amici submit that Amendment 2 is constitutionally infirm because it singles out one group from among the many that might seek protection against discrimination in, e.g., housing, employment or public accommodation and alters, for that group alone, the process for obtaining such protection.  While states surely are free to allocate legal authority and jurisdiction as they see fit with respect to issues such as fair housing (or, for that matter, farming, smoking or trout fishing), it is another matter to selectively disable a particular group of citizens from seeking to protect their rights in the same forums and manner in which such issues are addressable by everyone else. 
</p>
<h4>A. 	Individuals, Not Issues
</h4>
<p>	The &quot;political process&quot; cases  from Harper to Reynolds to Hunter to Gordon  speak in terms of individuals, not issues.  For purposes of their analysis it makes no difference whether the challenged inhibition rests on military status,  property ownership  or race.   It is the fact that the political and legal access of particular people has been discriminatorily restricted that is critical.
</p>
<p>	Petitioners and their amici attempt to depict this case as if the issue were the allocation of governmental authority among state and local officials and courts, or the power of the people to legislate directly through initiatives or referenda.  Pet. Br. at 27-28, 31; see also ER/NSR Br. at 8-11.  But that argument is simply miscast.  There is no doubt that the people of Colorado could, if they chose, make non-discrimination in housing a subject of statewide concern, repealing all contrary local ordinances in the process.  What they may not do, however, is allow local jurisdictions (or the state legislature and executive) to create, and courts to apply, laws protecting the housing rights of parents, truck drivers, veterans and the disabled, while foreclosing the ability of gay men, lesbians and bisexuals to seek the same protections in the same forums.  See Seattle School District, 458 U.S. at 478-79.  Petitioners' repeated use of the term &quot;group right&quot; (although intended pejoratively) suggests that they understand this important distinction.  See Pet. Br. at, e.g., 10, 25, 28. 
</p>
<p>	Petitioners and ER/NSR also assert that the appropriate question to be considered is simply whether those who oppose a piece of legislation and those who favor it are treated equally.  (Pet. Br. at 27.)  However, that argument misses the heart of what is unconstitutional about Amendment 2.  The pertinent issue is not whether groups seeking competing outcomes or holding opposing opinions must travel along identical routes in the political process, but whether all groups seeking the same kind of legislative protections must travel along identical routes.  Contrary to petitioners' argument, it is only when a state treats some people differently from others in the process of seeking identical kinds of legislative benefits that the state targets people, rather than issues or outcomes, and thereby violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  If disabled people or truck drivers or heterosexuals in Colorado want to be protected by non-discrimination laws, they may go to some court (if applicable anti-discrimination laws already exist) or to some state or local legislative body (if they do not) and seek that protection.  Gay men, lesbians and bisexuals  and they alone  may not.  That distinction violates their right to equal protection of the laws in the most direct sense.   
</p>
<h4>B. 	&quot;Independently&quot; Identifiable
</h4>
<p>	Gordon refers to &quot;independently identifiable group[s]&quot; as the proper touchstone for determining whether a law affecting process denies equal protection.  That is a useful formulation since it captures both the nature and the limits of the right in question.
</p>
<p>	Gordon's reference to a group that is &quot;independently&quot; identifiable is striking and cannot have been accidental.  A group is independently identifiable where it can be described without reference to any particular issue.  Thus, for example, in  Gordon, people who favored bonded indebtedness demonstrably were disadvantaged by West Virginia's super majority voting requirement.  Yet, as the Court explained, that fact did not make them a protectable class for equal protection purposes since (a) the same voting requirements applied to all forms of bonded indebtedness for any &quot;purpose&quot; (&quot;whether for schools, sewers or highways&quot;) and (b) the affected group was not identifiable except by reference to its position on that issue.  403 U.S. at 5.  
</p>
<p>	By contrast, gay men and lesbians  like Hispanics, Army officers, skiers and smokers  are identifiable apart from particular issues that affect their rights.  Thus, for example, it is perfectly comprehensible to speak of &quot;Hispanics&quot; or &quot;veterans,&quot; as such, without relating that identity to any underlying issue, such as housing, jobs or bonded indebtedness.  
</p>
<p>	Some groups, of course, are defined in whole or in part by a specific activity.  Thus, unlike blacks or redheads, &quot;farmers&quot; are a class defined by an occupation, &quot;poker players&quot; by a certain recreational activity and &quot;vegetarians&quot; by their diet.  Many laws make it harder for such groups to protect their interests in the activity which defines the class  a law repealing municipal option legislation for poker clubs, for example.  If such laws go no further than to regulate the &quot;definitional&quot; activity there is no basis for special equal protection concern.  Put otherwise, a class defined by an activity is not  as to regulation of that activity   independently identifiable.
</p>
<p>	This distinction is important.  As noted previously, were Colorado to adopt a constitutional amendment prohibiting cities from regulating smoking, the mere fact that smokers thereby would be disadvantaged in seeking to protect their desire to smoke does not, in our view, raise special concerns under the Equal Protection clause.  However, if the people of Colorado, in a fit of anti smoker hysteria, went further and precluded smokers from seeking legislation to protect them from arbitrary or malicious discrimination in housing, education or employment, such concern would be appropriate since the affected class (&quot;smokers&quot;) is unrelated to (i.e., is  independent of) the subject matter of the prohibition (i.e., housing, jobs or education).
</p>
<p>	That is, of course, the vice of Amendment 2.  Unlike all of the other groups (e.g., blacks, or veterans, or hunters or the elderly) who may seek anti discrimination legislation from local or statewide lawmaking bodies in Colorado, gay men and lesbians may not.  Moreover, even assuming arguendo that the group identified by Amendment 2 is a class defined by a particular activity  as opposed to being merely descriptive of a personal trait, such as being Hispanic or left-handed or deaf  the referendum is not limited to the activity (love and physical intimacy among people of the same gender) that defines the class but, instead,  flatly disables gays and lesbians from seeking any form of anti discrimination protection from any branch or agency of Colorado's state or local government.
</p>
<h4>C. 	Process, Not Outcome
</h4>
<p>	Petitioners say that this case is about slippery slopes.  See Pet. Br. at, e.g., 12, 36-37.  Amici submit that it is about level playing fields.  Far from involving any extraordinary redefinition of our federal system or limiting the rights of majorities to prevail, the result below and the principle on which it rests are quite narrow.  Only process, not outcome, is at issue. 
</p>
<p>	It is, instead, Amendment 2 that is &quot;extraordinary.&quot;  Pet. Br. at 9.  The Amendment creates a system in which gays, lesbians and bisexuals are singled out and subjected to a special and more onerous process in seeking to protect their political interests.  Moreover, the preclusion is permanent.  Put simply, Amendment 2 is a process-based obstacle course that only gays, lesbians and bisexuals are required to negotiate. 
</p>
<p>	There may, of course, be close cases.  Constitutional issues are rarely clear-cut and lawyers tend to be both creative and tenacious.  But tomorrow's difficult case is no justification for failing to deal correctly with today's easy one.  See Keller v. State Bar, 496 U.S. 1, 15-16 (1990).  Amendment 2 is, to borrow Justice Frankfurter's phrase, an &quot;uncouth&quot;  law.  The idea of placing obstacles in the path of particular citizens in order to deprive them of an equal opportunity to protect their interests through the political process is a particularly pernicious form of discrimination because it contradicts the idea that we all ought to play by the same rules and &quot;may the best person win.&quot;  When one group must run farther or surmount higher barricades to reach the same point, the contest itself is unacceptably corrupted.
</p>
<p>	Ending the debate now and for the future by taking certain people's rights off the table of political discourse is not merely poor practice  it denies those people the ability to obtain &quot;equal protection of the laws.&quot;  Well-settled principles recognize that equal protection is violated when certain people are &quot;fenced out&quot; of the process.  Carrington, 380 U.S. at 94.  The same is true when their political effectiveness is &quot;diluted.&quot;  Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 555.  The result should not be different merely because the &quot;fencing out&quot; and &quot;dilution&quot; take place at a different point in the process.  Amendment 2 is the ultimate exercise in group gerrymandering.  As such, it goes too far and is unconstitutional.
</p>
<h4>  	CONCLUSION
</h4>
<p>	For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Colorado Supreme Court should be affirmed.

</p>
<p>In the course of holding that respondent company committed -unfair
 labor practices- when it refused to interview or retain 11 job appli-
 cants because of their union membership, the National Labor
 Relations Board determined that all of the applicants were protected
 -employee[s]- as that word is defined in the National Labor Rela-
 tions Act, 29 U. S. C. 152(3), even though they intended to try to
 organize the company if they were hired and would have been paid
 by the union while they set about their organizing.  The Eighth
 Circuit reversed, holding that the statutory word -employee- does
 not cover (and therefore the Act does not protect from antiunion
 discrimination) those who work for a company while a union simul-
 taneously pays them to organize that company. 

<h4>Held:</h4>

<p>A worker may be a company's -employee,- within the terms of
 the National Labor Relations Act, even if, at the same time, a union
 pays that worker to help the union organize the company. 
 Pp. 3-13.</p>
<blockquote>
  (a) The Board may lawfully interpret 152(3)'s language-i.e.,
-[t]he term `employee' shall include any employee, and shall not be
limited to the employees of a particular employer, unless this
subchapter explicitly states otherwise--to include company workers
who are also paid union organizers.  The Board's broad, literal
reading of ``employee'' is entitled to considerable deference as the
interpretation of the agency created by Congress to administer the
Act.  See, e.g., Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U. S. 883, 891.  More-
over, several strong general arguments favor the Board's position. 
First, the Board's decision is consistent with the Act's language,
particularly the ``any employee'' phrase, which is broad enough to
include, under the ordinary dictionary definitions of -employee,-
those company workers whom a union also pays for organizing. 
Second, the Board's interpretation is consistent with several of the
Act's purposes-such as protecting employees' right to organize for
mutual aid without employer interference and encouraging and
protecting the collective-bargaining process-and with the legislative
history.  Third, the Board's reading is consistent with this Court's
decisions.  See, e.g., ibid.  Finally, 186(c)(1) also seems specifically
to contemplate the possibility that a company's employee might also

(b) Respondent company's agency law argument-that a paid
union organizer is controlled by the union and therefore must be
considered the servant (i.e. the -employee-) of the union alone-fails
because the Board's interpretation of ``employee'' is consistent with
the common law of agency, which recognizes that a person may be
the servant of two masters at one time as to one act.  The com-
pany's practical argument-that Congress could not have meant to
include paid union organizers as -employees- under the Act in light
of the potential for harm to an employer that such workers might
pose-suffers from several serious problems and is thus unconvinc-

</font></center>
<blockquote><font size = +2>A</font> constitutional amendment to prohibit desecration of the flag is expected to be reintroduced in both the House and the Senate as soon as Thrusday, February 13. Although we've been able to defeat similar proposals in the past, our margins are becoming increasingly thinner. In 1995, for example, a flag desecration amendment passed in the House and failed by only three votes in the Senate. This year, the amendment returns to the national stage backed by an increasingly sophisticated and expensive advertising campaign.

<center><font face="Arial" size="+2" color="#000080">Oppose This Legislation</font></center>
<p>
<img src = "/graphics/redstar.gif">The proposed constitutional amendment would do irreparable violence to our right to free speech and undermine the very principles for which the American flag stands. Those who favor the proposed amendment say they do so in honor of the flag. But in proposing to unravel the First Amendment, they desecrate what the flag represents, and what millions of Americans have died to defend.

<p>
<img src = "/graphics/redstar.gif">Unlike many other issues that bedevil our community, flag burning or desecration is an extremely rare occurrence. A constitutional amendment would, therefore, be the very definition of a solution in search of a problem.

<p>
<img src = "/graphics/redstar.gif">Unlike what some would have us believe, opposition to a flag desecration amendment is neither Democratic or Republican, liberal or conservative. Both in the Supreme Court and in Congress, officials opposing measures to "protect the flag" have fallen across the ideological spectrum. Justice Antonin Scalia, one of the Supreme Court's most conservative members, has consistently opposed similar measures while conservative Senators Robert Bennett of Utah and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky joined Edward Kennedy and Paul Wellstone in voting against a flag amendment in 1995.


<p><center><font face="Arial" size="+2" color="#000080">TAKE ACTION NOW!</font></center>


<p>A flag desecration amendment is expected to be reintroduced in the House and Senate as soon as Thursday, February 13. Proponents have promised speedy action on the proposal, possibly as early this Spring. If we hope to prevail once again, we must immediately begin to voice our support for the First Amendment and against any amendment to the Constitution that would ban flag desecration.

<h4>Question Presented
</h4>
<p>Whether a State's denial to newer bona fide residents of AFDC benefits
equal to those granted to longer-term residents is unconstitutional. 
</p>
<h4>Summary of Argument
</h4>
<p>California's statute, enacted with the unconstitutional purpose of
deterring in-state migration, impermissibly treats new bona fide residents
as second-class citizens by denying them AFDC benefits equal to those
granted to longer-term California residents who are otherwise equally
needy.  Two families with identical needs, identical resources, and
identical numbers of hungry mouths to feed are granted different amounts
of money solely because one of them has recently moved across state lines. 
</p>
<p>This discrimination is unconstitutional.  The fundamental right of
interstate travel and migration forbids a state from treating new
residents differently from old residents in order to discourage their
entry or to penalize them for their entry if they cross state lines
anyway.  Depriving new residents of basic subsistence payments that are
granted to longer-term residents constitutes such a penalty on the right
to travel and deterrent to its exercise.  Thus the only question in this
case is whether the State may escape its constitutional obligation to
treat new and old residents equally where it grants new residents the
dollar amount of AFDC benefits they would have received in their prior
state of residence. 
</p>
<p>The answer must be no.  Under this Court's governing precedents barring
discrimination against those who migrate across state lines, the
California law is subject to exacting scrutiny for any of three reasons. 
First, it was enacted with an avowed purpose long deemed invalid by this
Court: the purpose of fencing out needy indigents.  Second, it penalizes
the exercise of the right to travel by depriving newer families of the
ability to obtain basic necessities for survival.  As the district court
found, granting new indigent residents AFDC benefits at the level of their
prior state of residence affords them a fraction of the AFDC benefits a
longer-term Californian in identical circumstances would have received -
up to 80% less, if onegrates from Mississippi, or 45-70% less if one
migrates from Louisiana, Oklahoma or colorado as Plaintiffs did.  Third,
the California statute thus has, as intended, a powerful deterrent effect
on interstate movement. 
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the statute is subject to strict scrutiny, which it cannot
survive.  Its goal of fencing out indigents is impermissible.  And had the
Legislature genuinely intended to save money by the residency provision,
as the State now argues, far less discriminatory means were available: the
claimed savings from this provision amount to the equivalent of only 76
cents per existing AFDC recipient per month. 
</p>
<p>Even if the statute were deemed not to trigger strict scrutiny by
impermissibly burdening the right to travel, it nonetheless violates the
Equal Protection Clause under rationality review.  For no permissible
rational basis supports the distinction between new residents and old
residents or the distinctions among new residents that California has
drawn based upon prior states of residence.  As the district court found,
new residents do not have lesser needs than longer-term residents.  Nor do
new residents migrating from Mississippi need 80% less to live in
California than new residents migrating from Alaska.  This Court's
precedents make clear that, even if saving money is permissible goal, it
may not be realized on the backs of new residents alone. 
</p>
<p>Finally, the California law also violates the Privileges and Immunities
Clause of Article IV because it unjustifiably discriminates against new
bona fide residents by treating them as Louisianians, Oklahomans, or other
out-of-staters rather than as citizens of California. 
</p>
<p>This Court need not reach the merits of these questions, however, as the
case is moot.  Since the ruling below, the Ninth Circuit, in a separate
action, has vacated one of the federal waivers necessary to implement the
state law.  Thus, no live case or controversy now exists and the case
should be dismissed as moot.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="shapiro"></A>From Federalism to the Future</H2>
<H3>Statement of Steven R. Shapiro, ACLU Legal Director</H3>
<P>The upcoming Supreme Court Term is likely to feature an intriguing mix of
the old and the new.</P>
<P>The Court's docket is already loaded with cases raising fundamental
questions of federal-state relations that date back to the founding of the
Republic.  However, before the year is over the Court is also likely to address
the constitutional meaning of the information superhighway and its futuristic
implications for human communication.</P>
<P>The ACLU, once again, is in the midst of these battles.</P>
<P>In particular, the ACLU represents a group of plaintiffs that successfully
challenged the constitutionality of the Communications Decency Act.  The CDA,
which was enacted by Congress last year, purports to regulate &quot;indecency&quot;
on the Internet.  In fact, it threatens to stifle the Internet in its infancy by
reducing adults to reading and seeing only what is fit for children (ironically
determined, under the law, by everyone but the children's parents).</P>
<P>The Court, of course, may still decline jurisdiction in <I>Reno v. ACLU</I>.
But assuming it accepts the case for review, the Court will be confronted with
the delicate task of devising constitutional rules for a technology that is
still evolving and largely unknown.  Justice Breyer's role in crafting the
plurality opinion last year in <I>DAETC v. FCC</I> suggests that he will once
again play a pivotal role. What remains to be seen is whether the Court will be
willing to follow his pragmatic approach for a second time and figure out a way
to resolve the case without setting forth a definitive constitutional standard.</P>
<P>The Court faces a different, but no less daunting First Amendment problem in
<I>Turner Broadcasting Co. v. FCC</I>, which will be the first argument when
the Court reconvenes on October 7th.</P>
<P>The applicable standard was established by the Court in a prior ruling two
years ago. Now, the Court must decide whether the evidence establishes that the
so-called &quot;must-carry&quot; rules are necessary to preserve the economic
viability of local broad-cast stations or, instead, an undue intrusion into the
editorial prerogatives of cable operators.  Lurking behind these fact-specific
questions, however, is the enormously important issue of what role government
can and should play as access to the mass media is increasingly controlled by
fewer and fewer gatekeepers.</P>
<P>The Court has also plunged itself into the contentious debate over the &quot;right
to die&quot; by agreeing to review two cases striking down state bans on
physician-assisted suicide. The cases arise out of Washington State, <I>Washington
v. Glucksberg</I>, and New York, <I><A HREF="/court/96sum.html#vacco">Vacco v.
Quill</A></I>.</P>
<P>The federalism issues on this year's docket are more technical; still, their
outcome could have far-reaching consequences.  The Court's 1994 decision in <I>United
States v. Lopez</I> marked the first time in 50 years that a federal statute had
been struck down under the Commerce Clause.  Last year, in <I>Seminole Tribe of
Florida v. Florida</I>, the Court ruled that Congress could not rely on its
Commerce Clause powers to override the Eleventh Amendment immunity of states. 
This year, the high profile question is whether the Brady Act unconstitutionally
infringes upon the Tenth Amendment by requiring state and local officials to
assist in checking the background of prospective handgun purchasers.  That
question will be resolved by the Court's decision in <I>Printz v. U.S.</I> and<I>Mack
v. U.S.</I></P>
<P>Two other federalism cases on the Court's docket also have potential
significance for the civil rights community.  The narrow issue in

<A HREF="/court/96sum.html#blessing"><I>Blessing v. Freestone</I></A> is
whether individual parents can sue the states that fail to pursue child support
payments under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.  At least some amici,
however, have used the case to raise the far larger issue of whether 42 U.S.C. &#167;1983
-- the principal vehicle for litigating civil rights claims in federal court --
can ever be used to challenge the violation of a federal statute by state
officials.</P>
<P>Similarly, in <A HREF="/court/96sum.html#idaho"><I>Idaho v. Coeur D'Alene
Tribe</I></A>, the narrow question is whether the Eleventh Amendment bars an
injunction against state officials in a property dispute between the tribe and
the state.  Here, too, the lurking concern is that the case may become a vehicle
for a broader reconsideration of the <I>Ex Parte Young</I> doctrine, which has
traditionally permitted injunctive suits against state officials who act
unconstitutionally even when the Eleventh Amendment bars suits against the state
itself.</P>
<P>In addition to its role as both client and lawyer in <I>Reno v. ACLU</I>,
the ACLU is serving as direct counsel in four other cases that have already been
accepted for review.</P>
<P>One of those cases,<A HREF="/court/96sum.html#abrams"><I> Abrams v.
Johnson</I></A>, challenges the validity of a judicial redistricting plan which
reduces the number of minority congressional districts in Georgia from three to
one. In addition, the ACLU is co-counsel in
<I>Young v. Fordice</I>, which raises the question of whether a dual
registration scheme adopted by Mississippi after enactment of the Federal &quot;motor
voter&quot; law was subject to preclearance by the Justice Department under
Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. There are two other voting rights cases on
the Court's docket as well, <A HREF="/court/96sum.html#reno"><I>Reno v.
Bossier Parish School Board</I></A>, and
<A HREF="/court/96sum.html#lopez"><I>Lopez v. Monterey County</I></A>. </P>
<P>The Court's recent decisions have already done significant damage to the
Voting Rights Act.  What is yet to be resolved is whether that trend will
continue or whether the full Court is now willing to build on Justice O'Connor's
observation last year that the Voting Rights Act remains a constitutional
exercise of congressional power that has important value as a means of ensuring
equal participation in the political process.</P>
<P>The ACLU is also direct counsel in <A HREF="/court/96sum.html#mlb"><I>M.L.B.
v. S.L.J.</I></A>, which raises the question of whether a mother can be barred
from appealing the termination of her parental rights because she cannot afford
a payment of more than $2,000 demanded by the state as the cost of preparing a
trial transcript.  The ACLU is direct counsel in <I>Young v. Harper</I>, as
well, a due process case on behalf of a prisoner whose participation in a
supervised release program was abruptly terminated by prison officials without
any hearing or allegations of misconduct.</P>
<P>Finally, the ACLU has submitted amicus briefs in a dozen other cases already
on the docket for the 1996 Term.  In <A HREF="/court/96sum.html#arizonans"><I>Arizonans
for Official English v. Arizona</I></A>, the ACLU has argued that an
English-only provisions in the Arizona Constitution violates the basic
principles of representative government embodied in the First Amendment.  In
<A HREF="/court/96sum.html#schenck"><I>Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network</I></A>,
the ACLU has supported (with minor reservations) the terms of an injunction
designed to preserve access to abortion clinics in western New York given a
record of past obstruction.  In <A HREF="/court/96sum.html#clinton"><I>Clinton
v. Jones</I></A>, the ACLU has opposed the President's request for complete
immunity from all civil litigation during his term in office.  In
<A HREF="/court/96sum.html#us"><I>United States v. Lanier</I></A>, the ACLU
has supported use of the federal civil rights laws to criminally prosecute a
state court judge for sexual assault.  And, in
<A HREF="/court/96sum.html#kansas"><I>Kansas v. Hendricks</I></A>, the ACLU
has taken the position that the state should not use its mental hospitals as a
form of preventive detention for sexually violent criminals who have completed
their prison sentence.</P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="askin"></A>Back to Basics: How A Five-Member Majority Distorts
Modern Constitutional Principles</H2>
<H3>Statement of Frank Askin, ACLU General Counsel</H3>
<P>This annual briefing is a time for both looking forward and looking back. 
While my colleagues will concern themselves this morning mainly with an
examination of specific matters on the Court's 1996 docket, I want to address
what I see as a dangerous shift in the constitutional jurisprudence that the
Court has followed for more than half a century.</P>
<P>This shift most directly affects cases dealing with race and affirmative
action, but also has implications for other issues involving fairness, equity
and equal protection of the laws.</P>
<P>For a significant part of this century, the advent of a new Supreme Court
term has been a time of hope for racial and ethnic minorities and other segments
of the population with limited clout in the political arena, but who were able
to turn to the federal courts for protection of their rights.  Unfortunately,
that is no longer the case.  The sea change is exemplified by last term's 5 to 4
decision in, <I>Shaw v. Hunt</I>, the North Carolina congressional districting
case.</P>
<P>Speaking for a 5-member majority, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote that the
Constitution requires &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; of all racial classifications.
 He then applied that principle to invalidate districts drawn for the purpose of
facilitating the election of African-Americans to Congress.  In so doing, the
Chief Justice engaged in a judicial sleight of hand that contorts into
unrecognizableness the doctrine he claimed to invoke.</P>
<P>The modern doctrine of &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; of legislative enactments
alleged to violate constitutional norms is traceable to Chief Justice Stone's
1938 opinion in <I>United States v. Carolene Products</I>.</P>
<P>The case involved a federal statute forbidding the interstate shipment of &quot;filled
milk.&quot;  It was the beginning of the period when the Roosevelt Court was
abandoning its former economic due process doctrines.  The opinion by Stone,
upholding the constitutionality of the legislation, has often been cited as
ushering in a new era in constitutional law.  In it, he articulated the modern
principle that strict scrutiny of legislation was appropriate only when laws
infringed on certain kinds of individual rights unlikely to be protected by the
political process. </P>
<P>In the famous footnote number 4 (called &quot;the most celebrated footnote
in constitutional law&quot; by former Justice Lewis Powell), Stone began to
construct a theory to distinguish types of legislative enactments that required
strict judicial review from those that were entitled to deference by unelected
judges.   </P>
<P>In setting aside the lower court's ruling that the filled-milk statute was
unconstitutional, the Chief Justice explained that such economic legislation
need only be rationally related to some public health objective. Furthermore, he
wrote, courts should assume, until it was demonstrated otherwise, that such
legislative judgments were rationally based upon facts within the knowledge and
experience of the legislators.  If the electorate was dissatisfied with the
political judgments of their elected officials, it could respond at the polls.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Stone wrote, certain types of legislation were not
entitled to this presumption of constitutionality.  Chief among these were laws
that came within a specific prohibition of the Bill of Rights, since those
rights could not be subjected to revision or dilution by a political majority. 
</P>
<P>Furthermore, Stone's footnote continued, &quot;more searching judicial
inquiry&quot; might be appropriate in regard to statutes that were &quot;directed
at&quot; specific religious, national or racial minorities.  It was here that
Stone appended the often-quoted phrase that legislation prejudicial to &quot;discrete
and insular minorities may be a special condition that tends seriously to
curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily relied upon to
protect minorities.&quot;  Therefore, such enactments &quot;may call for a more
searching judicial inquiry.&quot;</P>
<P>It is most ironic that this Stone dictum has now been twisted to undermine
the rights of the &quot;discrete and insular minorities&quot; that the &quot;strict
scrutiny&quot; doctrine was designed to protect.  That irony was deftly exposed
by the dissenting opinion of Justice  Stevens in the North Carolina case. 
Chiding Rehnquist's opinion for applying &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; at the
behest of white voters to a district crafted to provide opportunity for
African-Americans to elect a Representative, Justice Stevens succinctly
observed:</P>
<P>&quot;A majority's attempt to enable the minority to participate more
effectively in the process of democratic government should not be viewed with
the same hostility that is appropriate for oppressive and exclusionary abuses of
political power.&quot;  </P>

<P>Justice Stevens was merely reminding his colleagues of the reasons for Chief
Justice Stone's </P>
<P>1938 footnote.  It had nothing whatsoever to do with invalidating
legislation that might benefit racial minorities.  It had everything to do with
making sure that the political process worked for everyone.  Chief Justice
Rehnquist and his four concurring colleagues have turned constitutional law (and
constitutional history) on its head.</P>
<P>Even more startling is the fact that less than two weeks after the North
Carolina decision, Justice Scalia, one of the five members of the <I>Shaw</I>
majority, invoked the <I>Carolene Products</I> principle in dissenting from the
decision requiring the Virginia Military Academy to admit women.  Scalia
objected to the holding in the VMI case that Virginia had to demonstrate an &quot;exceedingly
persuasive justification&quot; -- something less than strict scrutiny -- for its
gender discrimination.  Apparently oblivious to the inconsistency of his
positions, Scalia remonstrated the majority that women who wanted to attend VMI
were clearly not a &quot;discrete and insular minority,&quot; a status he had
been quite willing to assign to white voters just two weeks earlier.</P>
<P>While recognizing that the votes may no longer be there, the ACLU will
continue to point out to the Court -- as well as to the public at large -- the
fundamental constitutional principles so thoughtfully articulated by Chief
Justice Stone nearly 60 years ago.  Our democratic system, if it is to work for
all, must not only guarantee the political rights of the majority but must also
protect the rights of disempowered minorities to equal protection of the laws

and to first-class citizenship.</P>
<P>We consider those principles so immutable that we do not believe they can be
destroyed by a transitory majority.  We shall continue to remind the Court of
Chief Justice Stone's wisdom until it has been restored to its proper place in
the constitutional firmament.  The Court will have the opportunity to do that in
several cases this term -- most notably in the Georgia redistricting case,<I>Abrams
v. Johnson</I>.</P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="berger"></A>Developments in Criminal Justice</H2>
<H3>Statement of Vivian Berger, ACLU General Counsel</H3>
<P>Among the big news on the legislative front in recent months was the signing
into law of the so-called Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of
1996, which contained a major overhaul of the habeas corpus statutes. Relatedly,
among the big news from the Court in the 1995 Term was the surprising decision
to grant immediate review to a case arising under the Act,<I> Felker v. Turpin</I>.</P>
<P>Over the objection of four justices, who voiced dismay at their colleagues' &quot;unseemly
haste,&quot; the Court agreed to decide the validity of a bar on appeal and
certiorari from a Court of Appeals determination whether to permit the filing of
a second or successive petition. (In their novel &quot;gatekeeper&quot; role,
the circuit courts must deny such authorization unless the applicant makes a
prima facie showing that he fulfills the rigorous requirements of the new
provision governing successors.)</P>
<P>Notwithstanding its advance billing as a major ruling on the Act's
constitutionality, <I>Felker</I> easily and unanimously rejected a claim that
the prohibition on appellate review improperly restricted the Court's
jurisdiction and impermissibly suspended the writ.  The justices' conclusion
flowed directly from the finding that the statute did not curtail their power to
issue original writs -- a position advanced by ACLU.</P>
<P>The opinion was more interesting, and troubling, for what Chief Justice
Rehnquist said about how the Court would employ this power.  Noting the Act's
stringent substantive limitations on successive petitions (among other things,
in most instances the facts underlying the claim must suffice to establish
clearly and convincingly that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable judge
or jury would have convicted on the underlying crime), the Chief Justice stated
obliquely: &quot;Whether or not we are bound by these restrictions, they
certainly inform our consideration of original habeas petitions.&quot;  Swiftly
denying Felker's petition, he made plain that the Court will not serve as an end
run for prisoners around the Act's draconian strictures on multiple filings.</P>
<P>The Court's other habeas decisions arose under the former law.  They
highlight well the changes wrought by the new statute.</P>
<P><I>Thompson v. Keohane</I> held that the issue of whether a suspect is &quot;in
custody&quot; for purposes of questioning under Miranda presents a mixed
question of law and fact, subject to independent review by habeas courts.  As
discussed below, the Act arguably creates a more deferential standard for review
of such claims.</P>
<P><I>Lonchar v. Thomas</I> held that the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing
an eleventh-hour petition -- the defendant's first -- on ad hoc &quot;equitable&quot;
grounds based on his tardiness in filing.  A one-year limitations provision
contained in the Act will essentially moot the matter of delay, although the
sympathetic tone of the five-member majority opinion by Justice Breyer may lend
some comfort to habeas advocates.</P>
<P>Finally, <I>Gray v. Netherland</I> (which was, like <I>Felker</I> and <I>Lonchar</I>,
a capital case) relied on the recent jurisprudence of retroactivity, launched by
the Court in 1989 in <I>Teague v. Lane</I>, to dismiss the petitioner's
contention that the state denied him the opportunity to defend himself by
reneging on a promise to introduce only limited proof of his previous offenses
at the penalty trial.  Disingenuously casting the claim as one of a broad
constitutional entitlement to notification of the state's evidence, Chief
Justice Rehnquist wrote for five members of the Court that it would require a
new rule to establish that right -- and such a rule could not be announced in
the context of habeas.  The 1996 statute arguably displaces <I>Teague</I> and
its numerous progeny as a source of retroactivity law.</P>
<P>While the docket for the upcoming Term does not yet include any habeas
matters, the Act fairly bristles with questions of interpretation as well as

constitutionality.  A number of these already occupy the lower courts.  Thus, we

can predict with confidence that cases arising under the Act will shortly move
to the Court's front burner. Pressing issues include the following: </P>
<P>(1)  To what extent, if at all, do the general provisions of chapter 153 of
the Act apply to petitions filed before April 24, 1996, the date of enactment? 
A special chapter 154, governing only capital cases in states that create a
mechanism for appointing and compensating counsel in state post-conviction
proceedings, expressly covers pending matters; the rest of the Act is silent on
the subject of retrospectivity.</P>
<P>(2)  What effect do the Act's statutes of limitations (ordinarily a year;
six months in chapter 154) have on defendants whose time had nearly or fully
expired prior to April 24?</P>
<P>(3)  Does any limitations period violate the Suspension Clause?</P>
<P>(4)  Has the Act replaced the longstanding, fundamental rule (probably
constitutionally required), calling for independent review by federal courts of
both legal and &quot;mixed&quot; questions, with a deferential standard of
review?  The pertinent text, muddy at best, denies relief except as to claims
whose adjudication in state court &quot;resulted in a decision that was contrary
to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established [f]ederal
law, as determined by the Supreme Court ....&quot;  This same language appears
to embody a non-retroactivity rule similar to <I>Teague'</I>s, which raises the
question whether <I>Teague</I> doctrine has any remaining applicability.</P>
<P>The Court, without any help from Congress, seriously retrenched on
prisoners' rights in a different setting in <I>Lewis v. Casey</I>.  This ACLU
litigation involved a class action brought on behalf of inmates claiming that
inadequate legal research facilities deprived them of access to the courts, in
violation of <I>Bounds v. Smith</I> (1977).  The Ninth Circuit upheld an
injunction mandating detailed, systemic changes in prison law libraries and in
legal assistance programs.</P>
<P>All of the justices agreed that the relief ordered was overbroad since the
trial court's findings did not support it.  But instead of simply reversing the
judgment on this ground, Justice Scalia and four of his colleagues insisted on
announcing broad restrictions on the <I>Bounds</I> right.  Most egregiously,
they disclaimed suggestions in <I>Bounds</I> that the state must enable
prisoners &quot;to discover grievances&quot; and &quot;litigate effectively once
in court.&quot;  In light of another significant piece of legislation -- the
1996 Prison Reform Litigation Act -- signed two days after the habeas bill, the
Court's docket of prison cases will likely expand in the near future.</P>
<P>One more matter deserves brief mention.  The Court has already taken two
Fourth Amendment cases, <I>Maryland v. Wilson</I> and <I>Ohio v. Robinette</I>.
 <I>Wilson</I> presents the issue whether an officer's automatic right to
require the driver to exit his vehicle during a stop extends to a passenger.  In
<I>Robinette</I> (in which ACLU has filed a brief supporting the defendant),
the state contests the lower courts' holding that a citizen detained for traffic
offenses must be told when she is free to go -- or else, any &quot;consent&quot;
to search or &quot;consensual&quot; interrogation will be viewed as the fruit of
an illegal seizure.  Given the Court's dismal record in this area, the chance of
defense victories is slim.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ferguson"></A>Remedies for Racial Discrimination</H2>
<H3>Statement of James E. Ferguson, II, ACLU General Counsel</H3>
<P>Last year, before the 1995 Term of the Supreme Court began, many of us in
the civil rights community felt that despite its alarming rhetoric and rulings
during the previous year, there was still hope that remedies for racial
discrimination could be preserved.</P>
<P>We were optimistic and we were wrong.</P>
<P>During the 1995 Term, the Court delivered two more eulogies for
majority-minority districting as a remedy for redressing racial discrimination
under the Voting Rights Act. Both <I>Shaw v. Hunt</I> and <I>Bush v. Vera</I>
provided the Court an opportunity to provide guidance to lower courts,
legislatures and litigants as to when majority-minority districts are
permissible and what standards are to be followed in determining their validity
under the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act.</P>
<P>But instead of providing much-needed guidance, the Court added further
confusion to voting rights and racial  jurisprudence by simply declaring without
reasoned analysis that race was the &quot;predominant&quot; factor in the
drawing of the districts.</P>
<P>Either a cursory look or a close analysis easily reveals that race was one
of many factors that explained the dimensions and the dynamics of the doomed
districts in North Carolina and Texas. Traditional legislative and political
concerns such as protection of incumbents and creation of communities of
interest indisputably played a significant role in determining the ultimate
configuration of the districts in question.  </P>
<P>Nonetheless, the Majority struck down the districts, claiming that race was
the &quot;predominant&quot; factor, without providing any clear rules or

practical guidelines that legislators or courts can follow in future cases in
determining whether race was a &quot;predominant&quot; factor or simply a
significant factor along with other significant factors.</P>
<P>More disturbing than the majority's failure to provide guidance, however, is
the majority's willingness to discard, ignore and radically revise established
principles of decision making to reach a predetermined result. </P>
<P>In the line of districting cases beginning with the first <I>Shaw</I> case,
the majority has abandoned the established principle of standing that a
plaintiff must show that he or she suffered actual injury. None of the
plaintiffs in these cases have shown actual injury as a result of the
redistricting process. They have simply claimed that race was a motivating
factor in the drawing of their own districts. The majority has radically relaxed
the standing requirements by allowing the plaintiffs -- white voters -- to bring
their claim upon a showing that they were placed in a district with a racial
makeup not to their liking.</P>
<P>As Justice Stevens said in his dissent in <I>Shaw</I> II, &quot; ... the
majority's explanation of why these plaintiffs have standing to bring this
challenge is unconvincing ... they do not claim that they have been shut out of
the electoral process on account of race, or that their voting power has been
diluted as a consequence of race-based districting.</P>
<P>&quot;The injury that these plaintiffs have suffered, to the extent that
there has been injury at all, stems from the integrative rather than the
segregative effects of the State's redistricting plan,&quot; Stevens pointedly
concluded.</P>
<P>Just as the majority was willing to dispense with standing requirements, it
also utilized a loose standard for the application of strict scrutiny to the
racial remedies involved in these cases. It is beyond dispute that the objective
of the redistricting plans involved in these cases was to increase the political
participation of minorities who had previously been excluded from the political
process or had their strength diluted as a result of racial discrimination.</P>
<P>No one contended in any of these cases that the Government's intent or
objective was to segregate or disadvantage any racial group.  Nor was it
contended that the Government's action actually harmed any racial group.  Even
so, the Court applied strict scrutiny in its analysis in these cases.  By so
doing, the majority made it impossible for any of the plans to survive.</P>
<P>In its zeal to declare ours a color-blind society, the Court equated the
objectives in this case with the most insidious discrimination of the past where
race was used to segregate and excluded African-Americans and other minorities
from access and benefits accorded to the majority.</P>
<P>A rigid application of strict scrutiny in cases like these -- where the
Government's objective is to correct past invidious discrimination -- will lead
to results where the doctrine has the effect of denying rather than protecting
rights.</P>
<P>If the majority's abrogation of historically established decision-making
principles were only a matter of abstract jurisprudence, there would be no great
cause for concern because a future reconstituted, less judicially active court

could return to normalcy.</P>
<P>But the alarming reality is that the Court's failure to protect the
political gains achieved by African-Americans and other minorities since the
passage of the Voting Rights Act signals a return to a Congress that is
disproportionately white and does not reflect the makeup of America and return
to state legislatures and local elected bodies that do not reflect the presence
of African-Americans and other minorities.</P>
<P>Only a handful of African-American Congress members have been elected from
majority white districts in the entire history of the Nation. As of 1994, 36 of
the 39 black congressional representatives were elected from minority districts.
 Only three were elected from majority white districts.  These stark facts
provide dramatic refutation of the majority's make-believe &quot;color-blind&quot;
society.</P>
<P>The majority's activism in finding creative ways to avoid remedies that take
race into account can be contrasted with the Court's reluctance to allow a
criminal defendant to obtain the necessary information to challenge racially
selective prosecutions based upon the disproportionate impact of crack cocaine
prosecutions upon African-American males in <I>United States v. Armstrong</I>.</P>
<P>The Armstrong defendants filed a motion seeking discovery or dismissal on
the grounds that they were selected for prosecution because they are
African-American.  The District Court in the Ninth Circuit agreed with the
defendants and dismissed the indictment when the prosecution refused to provide
discovery which might have aided the defense in establishing its claims.</P>
<P>The Supreme Court disagreed and, in his dissent, Justice Stevens noted the
disparity between the penalties for crack cocaine and powder cocaine and the
disparate impact that such sentencing guidelines had upon African-American
defendants.</P>
<P>There is no longer reason for optimism that the majority on the Supreme
Court will relent in its hostility toward racial remedies. Perhaps there is some
solace to be found in the fact that the Court's current docket does not provide
much opportunity for the Court to further erode the doctrines that have
historically protected African-Americans and other minorities.</P>
<P>There are, however, three Voting Rights cases on the docket, which are
likely to result in some fine tuning of the unworkable, unmanageable approach
firs enunciated in <I>Shaw</I> I.  </P>
<P><I>Abrams v. Johnson</I> challenges the redrawn districts in Georgia
pursuant to the <I>Miller v. Johnson</I> case decided two terms ago. <I>Lopez
v. Monterey County</I> involves a Section Five pre-clearance issue. <I>Reno v.
Bossier Parish School Board</I> involves the application of <I>Shaw</I>
principles to local redistricting plans.</P>
<P>The record of the majority in cases involving race demonstrates that the
Court will do no good.  We can only hope that the Court will not do further
harm.</P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="hansen"></A>The Future of Free Speech</H2>
<H3>Statement of Chris Hansen, ACLU Senior Staff Counsel</H3>
<P>The Supreme Court is likely this year to determine the principles of free
speech that will be applied to the Internet.</P>
<P>The Internet continues to expand at a geometric rate, pushing toward a
future when it could fully realize its potential as the most democratic, most
powerful medium of communications ever created.  Thus, the Court's consideration
and ruling promises to be extraordinarily important in setting the free speech
principles that will apply in the 21st Century.</P>
<P>The case, <I>ACLU v. Reno</I> -- or <I>Reno v. ACLU</I>, as it is now
known -- is a challenge to the federal Communications Decency Act (CDA). The CDA
makes it a crime, punishable by up to two years in jail, for anyone to engage in
speech that is &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently offensive&quot; on
computer networks if the speech can be seen by a minor. The Act applies to all
aspects of cyberspace: E-mail (individual messages sent by computer), newsgroups
such as those in Usenet (places where individuals can post comments on specific
topics), chat rooms (real time conversations by computer) and the World Wide Web
(a source of sites with information about various topics).</P>
<P>Congress, having drafted and passed the CDA, recognized that its potential
repercussions were so profound that it wrote into the law an expedited path to
the Supreme Court's door.</P>
<P>The ACLU took up that legal gauntlet and filed its challenge to the CDA on
February 8, 1996 -- the day it was signed into law by President Clinton -- on

behalf of 20 individuals and organizations that communicate and provide
information via the Internet. In addition to the ACLU itself, the case was filed
on behalf of Human Rights Watch, Planned Parenthood, EFF and EPIC (national
cyberspace rights groups), the Critical Path AIDS Project Web page (information
about safer sex practices and AIDS treatment), Wildcat Press and Youth Arts News
(gay publisher and sponsor of an electronic newsletter by gay and lesbian
teens).</P>
<P>Several weeks later, a second suit was filed by more than 20 corporate and
trade organizations, including the American Library Association and computer
industry giants Microsoft, AOL, Prodigy, Apple, CompuServe.  That suit, <I>ALA
v. Reno</I>, was subsequently consolidated with <I>Reno v. ACLU</I>.</P>
<P>Collectively, the plaintiffs alleged that, because the nature of cyberspace
made it either technologically or economically impossible to screen potential
readers by age, all speakers in cyberspace would have to reduce their speech to
the level found acceptable for the most vulnerable minor.   </P>
<P>For this reason, the plaintiffs said, the CDA violated the First Amendment,
and the rights of their member organizations by criminalizing speech that, at a
minimum, was constitutionally protected for adults.  </P>
<P>Plaintiffs also alleged that the CDA was overbroad; vague; violated the
rights of minors (particular older minors) to engage in and gain access to
protected speech; and would effectively prohibit anonymous speech and access to
speech.</P>
<P>A three-judge panel was appointed to hear the motion for preliminary
injunction, and six days of trial were scheduled during March and April of this
year.  The panel consisted of Chief Judge Dolores K. Sloviter, Judge Stewart
Dalzell, and Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter, who heard the initial request for a TRO
when the suit was filed.</P>
<P>At the hearing, the Internet was literally as well as figuratively on trial,
as the judges were presented with an online demonstration of the workings of the
World Wide Web. Specifically, the judges were given evidence of the enormous
quantity of valuable speech, both for minors and adults that would be
effectively criminalized under the CDA. In addition, the judges were told that
even if such censorship were constitutional, it would be technically infeasible
to comply with the CDA.</P>
<P>On June 11, the court granted the motion for preliminary injunction,
unanimously declaring the CDA unconstitutional. The opinion of the Court begins
with 123 lengthy &quot;Findings of Fact&quot; describing the nature of
cyberspace and the destructive effect of the CDA. Following are three separate
opinions by each of the judges. </P>
<P>Judge Dalzell, speaking in glowing terms of the unique nature of the
Internet, called it &quot;the most participatory form of mass speech yet
developed,&quot; one that &quot;deserves the highest protection from government
intrusion.&quot;  </P>
<P>Addressing the ACLU's argument that the &quot;indecency&quot; and &quot;patently
offensive&quot; provisions of the CDA were impermissibly vague, Judge Buckwalter
wrote: &quot;I continue to believe that the word ?indecent' is
unconstitutionally vague and I find that the terms ?in context' and ?patently
offensive' are also so vague as to violate the First and Fifth Amendments.&quot;
</P>
<P>Summing up her opinion, Chief Judge Sloviter wrote: &quot;The bottom line is
that the First Amendment should not be interpreted to require us to entrust the
protection it affords to the judgment of prosecutors.  Prosecutors come and
go...The First Amendment remains to give protection to future generations as
well.&quot;</P>
<P>The extensive findings of fact in this case, as well as the case material
itself, now become part of the record in <I>Reno v. ACLU</I>. This leaves us in
an excellent position to demonstrate to the Supreme Court the unique nature of
the Internet, as the Court decides whether this most democratic communications
medium is to be given the same broad free speech protections given to print.
</P>
<P>After the decision in the ACLU case, a three-judge court in New York
unanimously declared the CDA unconstitutional in a similar case, <I>Shea v.
Reno</I>. The government has appealed both decisions and filed its
Jurisdictional Statement in the ACLU case. As a next step on that path, by the
end of this month the ACLU plans to file a motion for summary affirmance of the
lower court decision on the grounds that the factual findings are so extensive
and so indisputable that further argument is unnecessary.  </P>
<P>How are the justices likely to act? </P>
<P>No one, of course, knows, but in a related decision, <I>Denver Area
Educational Telecommunications Consortium v. FCC</I>, the Court addressed the
constitutionality of FCC regulations concerning &quot;indecency&quot; on cable
TV, striking down two of the three provisions.  In doing so, the Court was
widely split.  The plurality found that the pace of changing technology made it
difficult to set definitive First Amendment rules in high tech areas. Indeed,
Justice Breyer's opinion expressly suggested that, given the rapid changes, the
Court ought to be particularly cautious in the area of the Internet.   </P>
<P><I>Reno v. ACLU</I> will thus test the Court's desire to follow its own
suggestions and move cautiously with the potentially destructive effect of the
CDA on the innovative nature of cyberspace, the very quality that makes it so
exciting and so powerful.</P>
<P>The courts have thus far recognized that, in the absence of heavy-handed and
ill-conceived government regulation, cyberspace is destined to become the most
important means of communication into the next century. But before every
American can participate, the Justices must affirm our right to free speech.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

 v.<br>
 NATIONAL TREASURY EMPLOYEES UNION</font></h3>

</center>
<br>
<blockquote>
<img src="../graphics/rbline.gif" width=95%><br>
<h4>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
</h4>
<p>I. Section 501(b) of the Ethics Reform Act -- the &quot;honoraria&quot; ban --
prohibits any of the three million civilian executive branch employees
from accepting any compensation for off-duty articles, speeches, or
appearances, regardless of their subject matter or the identity of the
payor. Section 501(b) both focuses its financial burden only on speech (as
opposed to other income-producing activities) and sweeps broadly,
encompassing a wide range of arbitrarily selected expressive activities,
from drama reviews to religious lectures. 
</p>
<dl><dd>A. There can be no doubt that the ban implicates serious First Amendment
concerns both by singling out and penalizing certain forms of speech, and
by making it more expensive and thus more difficult for employees to
engage in covered forms of expressive activity. The ban has reduced and in
many cases eliminated any incentive to write articles or speak publicly.
Under settled precedent of this Court, such a restriction targeting speech
significantly burdens the exercise of First Amendment rights. 
</p>
<dd>B. The constitutionality of restrictions on the speech of public employees
is traditionally measured by the balancing test set forth in Pickering v.
Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563 (1968), which seeks to accommodate &quot;the
interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of
public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting
the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.&quot;
Id. at 568. Under that case and its progeny, where the government imposes
burdens on the off-duty, nonwork-related speech of its employees, it must
make a strong showing that its interest in promoting governmental
efficiency is threatened and that its restriction on speech is no broader
than is reasonably necessary to protect its interests. 
</dl>
<p>The government's persistent attempts to derive a more deferential
standard of review from United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75
(1947), are unavailing. If anything, the ban's singling out of speech for
regulation suggests that the application of a more rigorous standard of
review than usually governs in the public employment context is
appropriate. See Minneapolis Star and Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of
Revenue, 460 U.S.575 (1983). But in any case, subsequent precedent of this
Court undermines the government's effort to use Mitchell to skew the
Pickering balance in its favor. 
</p>
<dl><dd>C. Under any meaningful standard of scrutiny, Section 501(b) is
unconstitutional. The ban both singles out compensation for expressive
activity without adequate justification and encroaches upon far more
speech than may reasonably be considered necessary to protect the asserted
interest in government integrity. In fact, the ban's irrational scope and
lack of any real or perceived justification have actually led to the
undermining of the credibility of government ethical standards in general,
in the view of administration officials and numerous experts. 
</dl>
<p>The government has not shown that speech by career executive
branch employees with no nexus to government employment raises any action
or apparent impropriety. It points to no history of abuse from employees'
receipt of &quot;honoraria&quot; or to any expressed congressional concern about
such activity. Congress' focus, as even the government admits, was on the
potential for abuse in the receipt of honoraria, as traditionally defined,
by Members of Congress from special interest groups. The reports cited by
the government as the basis for the enactment of the ban merely
recommended an extension to all three branches of a prohibition on
acceptance of the type of honoraria historically subject to abuse. 
</p>
<p>The government has similarly failed to justify the ban as a
prophylactic measure necessary to avoid a risk of circumvention or the
administrative difficulties of a narrower ban. The ban is, first, not even
a genuine &quot;prophylactic&quot; measure, for it is riddled with exceptions and
exclusions. Second, there has been no showing of significant enforcement
problems with prior regulations and certainly no showing that the ban with
its odd permutations would be any easier to administer. But finally, and
most importantly, the government has not shown that ban of this breadth is
necessary to meet a serious problem of abuse, as is required of
prophylactic rules affecting First Amendment rights. The government's
speculation concerning what Congress &quot;could have&quot; thought that the public
&quot;could have&quot; considered a threat is not sufficient justification under any
of this Court's current jurisprudence, including the Hatch Act cases. In
fact, the absence of any clearly articulated need for the ban -- any
documented potential for abuse or history of congressional or public
concern -- stands in sharp contrast to the well-documented record
supporting the Hatch Act. 
</p>
<p>II. While adherence to the precise remedial formulation adopted by the
court below is not crucial to the vindication of respondents' First
Amendment rights, the remedy the court of appeals fashioned, contrary to
the government's arguments, was appropriate and consistent with this
Court's jurisprudence. The court properly invalidated Section 501(b)
insofar as it limited the speech of executive branch employees -- those as
to whom a constitutional defect had been shown -- while leaving intact
those applications to other branches that had not been challenged and that
raise &quot;quite different considerations.&quot; Per App. 14a. 
</p>
<p>There is no merit to the government's argument that the court of appeals
was required to identify and define the circumstances in which there would
exist a constitutionally adequate &quot;nexus&quot; between the subject matter of
the expression or the character of the payor, and devise a remedy on that
basis. As the court of appeals recognized, the drafting of an appropriate
nexus test -- one that prohibits receipt of compensation only where it
would create a real or apparent conflict with federal employment -- is a
task more properly left to Congress.

APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL OF
CALIFORNIA SECOND APPELLATE DISTRICT
</b></center><br>
<img src="../graphics/rbline.gif" width=100%><br><p>
BRIEF FOR APPELLANT
<p>
INTRODUCTION
<p>                   
          Appellant appeals from a judgment of the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, State of California, entered October 22, 1969 (A. 26), affirming a judgment of conviction entered by the Municipal Court of the Los Angeles Judicial District, State of California, on September 27, 1968 (A. 8). Appellant was charged with "engaging in tumultuous and offensive conduct" in violation of the California disturbing-the-peace statute, section 415 of the California Penal Code (A. 1). The said Municipal Court, sitting without a jury, found Appellant guilty, and sentenced Appellant to thirty days in county jail (A. 8).
<p>         
          Upon appeal to the Appellate Department of the Superior Court the judgment was reversed on January 20, 1969 (A. 10). Thereafter State petitioned for rehearing or certification to the Court of Appeal. The Appellate Department granted rehearing (A. 12), and the matter was orally argued for a second time. On May 23, 1969, the Appellate Department once again reversed the judgment of conviction (A. 13). The State again petitioned for certification to the Court of Appeal. The Appellate Department granted the petition and issued an order certifying the cause to be transferred to the California Court of Appeal (A. 23). The Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, ordered such transfer (A. 25), heard the case on appeal, and affirmed the judgment of conviction (A. 26). Appellant filed a Petition for Rehearing before the Court of Appeal, and said Petition was denied on November 13, 1969 (A. 36). Appellant then filed a Petition for Hearing before the California Supreme Court, and said Petition was denied on December 17, 1969 (A. 36). It is of some significance to note that the Petition for Hearing was denied by the California Supreme Court by a 4-to-3 vote, with Chief Justice Traynor, and Justices Peters and Tobriner dissenting (A. 36).
<p>         
<b>OPINIONS BELOW</b>
<p>                 
          The trial judge in the Municipal Court did not render a written opinion. The Appellate Department of the Superior Court in reversing the judgment of conviction rendered an unreported Memorandum Opinion and Judgment on January 20, 1969 (A. 10). Upon rehearing, the Appellate Department of the Superior Court on May 23, 1969, in once again reversing the judgment of conviction, rendered a second unreported  Memorandum Opinion and Judgment (A. 13). The Court of Appeal, in affirming the judgment of conviction, rendered an opinion (A. 26), which has been reported in 1 Cal. App. 3d 94, 81 Cal. Rptr. 503 (1969).
<p>         
<b>JURISDICTIONAL GROUNDS</b>
<p>                   
Appellant was convicted of violation of section 415 of the California Penal Code. After reversal by the Appellate Department of the Superior Court (see Introduction), the conviction was ultimately affirmed by the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, State of California, on October 22, 1969. Petition for Rehearing before the Court of Appeal was denied on November 13, 1969 (A. 36). In view of the fact that the California Supreme Court thereafter declined to hear the case by denying Appellant's Petition for Hearing (A. 36), the judgment of the said Court of
Appeal constitutes a judgment rendered by the highest court of the State of California in which a decision can be had within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. section 1257. (American Railway Express Co. v. Levee, 263 U.S. 19, 68 L. Ed. 140 (1923).) The California Supreme Court denied Appellant's Petition for Hearing on December 17, 1969 (A. 36), and the time for bringing this appeal is measured from the date of such denial. (American Railway Express Co. v. Levee, supra.) The validity of section 415 of the Califomia Penal Code was drawn in question on the ground of its
being repugnant to the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and both the trial court (A. 21) and the Court of Appeal (A. 30) rendered decision in favor of the validity of said section 415. It follows, therefore, that an appeal will lie before this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. section 1257(2). Notice of Appeal to this Court was filed in the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, State of California, on February 20, 1970. The case was docketed in this Court on March 5, 1970 (see Appendix, cover). Jurisdiction was postponed to the hearing of the case on the merits, and the case was transferred to the appellate docket and placed on the summary calendar on June 22, 1970 (A. 37).
<p>          
<b>CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY
PROVISIONS INVOLVED</b>
<p>        
The constitutional provisions involved are the First and Fourteenth Amendments, U.S. Const., Amend. I, Amend. XIV, Sec. 1.
<p>         
The statutory provision involved is that portion of section 415, California Penal Code, relating to "offensive conduct." Section 415 reads in its entirety as follows:
<p><blockquote>         
        "Disturbing the peace; noise; use of public streets of unincorporated town for offensive conduct, horse racing, or shooting; indecent language; punishment
<p>         
 "Every person who maliciously and willfully disturbs the peace or quiet of any neighborhood or
person, by loud or unusual noise, or by tumultuous or offensive conduct, or threatening, traducing, quarreling, challenging to fight, or fighting, or who, on the public streets of any unincorporated town, or upon the public highways in such unincorporated town, run any horse race, either for a wager or for amusement, or fire any gun or pistol in such unincorporated town, or use any vulgar, profane, or indecent language within the presence or hearing of women or children, in a loud and boisterous manner, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction by
any Court of competent jurisdiction shall be punished by fine not exceeding two hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in the County Jail for not more than ninety days, or by both fine and imprisonment, or either, at the discretion of the Court." (Enacted 1872. As amended Code Am. 1877-8, c. 299, p. 117,  1.)
</blockquote><p>
<b>QUESTIONS PRESENTED</b>
<p>
 1. Can one who publicly exhibits in writing the words "Fuck the Draft" be denied the guarantees of freedom of speech under the First and Fourteenth Amendments on the ground that the exhibition of such writing "had a tendency to incite others to violent behavior or to disturb the peace" (A. 29) where the trial court found that: "No evidence was offered by the People indicating or tending to indicate that Defendant either engaged in or threatened any acts of violence, or was about to engage in any such acts, or that Defendant by his conduct incited anyone else to any acts of violence, or that any persons observing Defendant engaged in or threatened, or were about to engage in acts of violence " (A. 19) ?
<p>         
 2. Is it a denial of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to sentence the Appellant to 30 days in jail on the ground that his exhibition in writing of the words "Fuck the Draft" "had a tendency to incite others to violent behavior or to disturb the
peace" (A. 29) in view of the finding of the trial court that there was no evidence "that any persons observing Defendant engaged in or threatened, or were about to engage in acts of violence" (A. 19)?
<p>
 3. Can the expression of words stating a political opinion be punished, notwithstanding the First and Fourteenth Amendments, on the ground that such expression creates a tendency that others will respond with violent behavior, where there is an absence of any evidence of a likelihood that such a violent response would in fact occur?
<p>
 4. Does the so-called "fighting words" exception to First Amendment protection apply where the words expressed are critical of a political institution ( i.e., the Selective Service System) and not of any individual persons to whom the expression may be addressed, or to any other individual persons?
<p><blockquote>
   a. Can such words be considered to be "likely to provoke the average person to retaliation, and thereby cause a breach of the peace"?
<p>
   b. Even if violent retaliation by persons viewing the words were likely, does this justify silencing the speaker in the absence of proof that the police are incapable of controlling such violent retaliation?
</blockquote><p>
 5. Are the words "Fuck the Draft" obscene in a constitutional sense?
<blockquote><p>
   a. Does the dominant theme of these words taken as a whole appeal to a prurient interest in sex?
<p>
   b. Are these words patently offensive because they affront community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters?
<p>
   c. Are these words utterly without redeeming social value?
<p>
   d. Can these words be regarded as obscene if the answer to either a, b or c of this Question 5 is "No"?
<p></blockquote>
 6. If the words "Fuck the Draft" are not obscene in a constitutional sense, may their expression nevertheless be punished, despite the First and Fourteenth Amendments, on the ground that non-obscene profanity is offensive to others?
<p>
 7. Can non-obscene speech (and particularly speech expressing a political point of view) ever be abridged simply because others find the expression offensive?
<p>
 8. Is there a "non-speech element" which justifies abridging Appellant's freedom of speech by reason of the fact that he expressed himself in the corridor of a public building when his physical presence and demeanor in such corridor (as distinguished from the words he expressed) was neither illegal, nor objected to by any authorities?
<p>
 9. Is a criminal statute which punishes speech as a form of "offensive conduct" without specifying which forms of speech will constitute such "offensive conduct" unconstitutionally overbroad in its chilling effect on freedom of speech?
<p>
 10. If the answer to Question 9 is "yes," is the statute rendered constitutionally valid by a judicial construction which limits its application to speech where there is a tendency that the audience for such speech might so object to the speech as to resort to violence, but under such construction speech may be punished even though there is no likelihood that such violence will in fact occur?
<p>
 11. Is a statute as described in Questions 9 and 10 unconstitutionally vague?
<p>
<b>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</b>
<p>
 While in the courthouse corridor outside Division 20 of the Los Angeles Municipal Court, Appellant wore a jacket upon which were inscribed the words "Fuck the Draft" (A. 18). Also inscribed on the jacket were the words "Stop War" and two "peace symbols" (A. 19). Women and children were present in said corridor (A. 18). Appellant neither engaged in, threatened, nor incited any acts of violence (A. 19), nor were any other persons in the said corridor engaged in, threatening, or about to engage in acts of violence (A. 19). Appellant at no time caused the emission of any loud or unusual noises (A. 19). Appellant testified that by wearing the jacket as thus inscribed the public was made aware of the depth of feeling against the draft shared by himself and his friends (A. 19-20), and that he had no wish to vex, annoy, or injure others (A. 20).
<p>
 Appellant was charged with "engaging in tumultuous and offensive conduct" in violation of section 415 of the Penal Code. He was convicted, and sentenced to 30 days in county jail (A. 8).
<p>
 The constitutional issues here raised were first raised at trial on Appellant's motion to suppress evidence on constitutional grounds (A. 4). They were raised once again after the evidence was admitted on Appellant's motion for entry of judgment of acquittal under California Penal Code section 1118 (A. 7). In each instance the trial court expressly held that Appellant could be convicted of violation of Penal Code section 415 without abridging his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments (A. 20-21), and that section 415 is not invalid on its face in that it is neither unconstitutionally vague (A. 21) nor unconstitutionally overbroad (A. 21). In addition, the trial court held that the words "Fuck the Draft" are "obscene" within the constitutional meaning of that word (A. 20).
<p>
The same constitutional issues were briefed and argued at each succeeding proceeding in this case. See generally the Court of Appeal's discussion of Appellant's position (A. 26-35).
<p>
<b>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</b>
<p>
Appellant was clearly engaging in speech, and such speech is entitled to First and Fourteenth Amendment protection because it neither contained nor was it accompanied by any of the elements which this Court has heretofore recognized as justifying abridgment of freedom of speech.
 <p>
There was no threat of violence such as to justify abridgment of Appellant's speech. The Settled Statement makes clear that there was no likelihood of violence either from Appellant or from anyone viewing his words. The trial court erroneously held that no violence potential need be
shown in order to convict for the use of words which constitute "offensive conduct." This in itself requires reversal. But even under the construction adopted by the Court of Appeal it is clear that a mere "tendency" that violence might result from some unidentified bystanders is too remote a danger to justify abridgment of speech (Argument I A (1)).
<p>
Even if there were a likelihood of violence by those opposing Appellant's speech, this in itself would not justify vitiating Appellant's First Amendment rights, at least in the absence of a showing that the police were unable to restrain those who would resort to violence (Argument I A (2)).
<p>
The so-called "fighting words" doctrine is not here applicable because there was no showing of a likelihood that a breach of the peace would result from Appellant's words, and further because Appellant's words were not "fighting words" in the sense of attacking or criticizing those to whom the words were being addressed (Argument I A (3)).
<p>
Appellant's words were not "obscene" in the constitutional sense as this Court has defined obscenity in that the dominant theme of the words "Fuck the Draft" does not appeal to a prurient interest in sex, the words are not patently offensive by reason of affronting contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters, and the words are not utterly without redeeming social value (Argument I B).
<p>
There were no time, place or manner "non-speech" elements justifying the denial of First and Fourteenth Amendment protection for Appellant's speech. Appellant had every right to be where he was, his manner was neither loud nor unruly, and the only objection by the authorities was to Appellant's speech itself (Argument I C).
<p>
The fact that Appellant's speech may have been offensive to some persons does not justify the abridgment of his speech. The First Amendment is equally applicable to offensive and non-offensive speech (Argument II A).
<p>
Fundamental First Amendment theory requires protection for speech such as that employed by Appellant. A free marketplace of ideas, or democratic dialogue, is essential for a self-governing people to be able to make informed decisions (Argument II B (1) (a)).
<p>
The democratic dialogue would not function properly if the state could censor the form ( i.e., particular words chosen to express an idea) of speech even if there were no censorship of the ideas conveyed. In this case if Appellant had expressed himself in a more polite manner the self-
governing people would not have been apprised of the depth of feeling against the draft shared by Appellant and his friends. More fundamentally, if the state could censor the emotive content of speech, even though it did not censor the intellectual content, the state could thereby to
a large extent determine to which members of the public a given speech will appeal, and could thus largely influence whether a particular idea will prevail in the marketplace. For this reason it is clear that speech to be protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments need not be "polite"
(Argument II B (I) (b)).
<p>
 Profanity has become a vital ingredient in the language of dissent as used by many young people, and by many members of minority groups. If the use of such words were to be legally proscribed, the language of dissent, and hence the democratic dialogue, would be severely inhibited (Argument II B ( I ) (c)).
<p>
 Furthermore, society at large now tolerates and even rewards the use of the word "fuck" in the arts and in motion pictures. It would be ludicrous to jail Appellant for the use of a word which appears in seven out of the ten best-selling works of fiction, and which is generally accept-
able to a large segment of society (Argument II B (1) (d)).
<p>
 It may not be argued that those who viewed Appellant's words constituted a "captive audience" since at most they were required to fleetingly glance at such words. If such a casual and fleeting contact by an unwilling audience justifies abridgment of speech, then street-corner speakers, radio and television broadcasters and many others whose statements may be offensive to some listeners could be silenced, and the democratic dialogue would be stultified. In this regard, it adds nothing analytically to refer to the "shock" effect of Appellant's words, since this is but a different label for highly offensive words, and offensiveness per se does not vitiate First Amendment rights (Argument II B (I) (e)).
<p>
Freedom of speech is also important as an end in itself, in that it serves the function of self-fulfillment. This is true of four-letter words both for literary and psychological reasons (Argument II B (2)).
<p>
Finally, freedom of speech serves a safety-value function, as men are less inclined to resort to violence to achieve given ends if they can freely express themselves verbally with respect to such ends. The cathartic effect of four-letter-word speech is confirmed by psychological authorities (Argument II B (3)).
<p>
Section 415 of the California Penal Code, as construed by the California courts, is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Under the Court of Appeal's construction, if there is a mere possibility that someone might be offended by given words and might therefore resort to violence, such words may constitute "offensive conduct" within the meaning of the statute. This is both overly vague and overbroad in applying an impermissible standard. The construction of section 415 by the California Supreme Court in a subsequent case does not save the statute from vulnerability both on grounds of vagueness and overbreadth (Argument III).

<P><TT>
PHILADELPHIA -- A federal appeals court has declared unconstitutional a New
Jersey school district's policy of allowing high school seniors to vote on
whether to include a prayer in graduation ceremonies, Reuter reports.          
 </TT></P>
<P><TT>The ruling by the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upholds a lower
court injunction against the policy of the Black Horse Pike Regional Board of
Education in Camden County, New Jersey.            </TT></P>
<P><TT>The prayer policy was never implemented, Reuter said, because it had
been blocked earlier by restraining orders on the grounds it blurred the line
between church and state.            </TT></P>
<P><TT>&quot;We're quite pleased with the decision,&quot; said David Rocah,
staff attorney for American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, which sought to
block the policy. &quot;The decision comes just in time for the public school
graduation season.&quot;            </TT></P>
<P><TT>The school board adopted its policy in 1993 in the wake of a Supreme
Court decision invalidating a public school's practice of including a prayer in

its graduation ceremony, Reuter said.            </TT></P>
<P><TT>The New Jersey board said it was not endorsing prayer, but that
students could decide through a senior class vote on the issue.            </TT></P>
<P><TT>However, the appeals court said in its ruling that turning the decision
over to students still violated principles of church-state separation.          
 </TT></P>
<P><TT>&quot;Although the state's involvement here is certainly less evident,
the student referendum does not erase the state's imprint from this graduation
prayer,&quot; it said.            </TT></P>
<P><TT>Attorneys for the school board could not be reached for comment.       
   </TT></P>
<P><TT>Rocah said Friday's ruling was in conflict with a ruling by the Fifth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which could set the stage for the Supreme Court
to resolve the issue.</TT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>FACTS</B></P>
<P>18.  In September 1994, plaintiff [the young woman], who at the time was 15
years old, became aware that she was pregnant.  [The young woman] had not
questioned the absence of her menstrual period immediately, because her periods
were consistently irregular.  On Monday, September 26, she informed her parents,
plaintiffs Connie and Carl Scott, that she was pregnant as a result of sexual
relations with her boyfriend [the boyfriend].  Together the plaintiffs decided
to have [the young woman] consult a physician and to consider her options. </P>
<P>19.  Defendants [the boyfriend] and his mother and stepfather Kathy and John
Tull had become aware of the pregnancy on the afternoon of September 26 because
Kathy had [the young woman] take two home pregnancy tests at the Tulls' house. 
Later that evening, Kathy and John Tull made an unsolicited visit to the Scotts'
home.  The Tulls informed the Scotts of their desire to help raise [the young
woman]'s child, even though [the young woman] had not yet decided whether or not
she would carry her pregnancy to term.  </P>
<P>20.  On Tuesday, September 27, plaintiff [the young woman] was examined by
Dr. Carol Weckmuller at the Blair Medical Group.  The family's regular doctor
was on vacation at the time.  [The young woman] was accompanied by her mother
Connie Scott.  Based on a physical examination, Dr. Weckmuller informed [the
young woman] and Connie Scott that she estimated that [the young woman] was

twenty-three weeks pregnant.  Dr. Weckmuller advised [the young woman] where she
could get an abortion, should that be her choice.  [The young woman] informed
defendant Kathy Tull, by telephone, of the developments that day.</P>
<P>21.  On Wednesday, September 28, [the young woman] spoke at length with her
family about her options.  After extensive deliberation, [the young woman]
decided to seek an abortion.</P>
<P>22.  On Wednesday, September 28, [the young woman] made an appointment by
telephone for an abortion.  During the phone call, [the young woman] spoke to a
clinic employee, who asked her a series of questions and then explained the
abortion procedure to her.  Connie Scott also talked to the employee and gave
her additional information.  [The young woman] then spoke again with the clinic
employee, who asked again whether [the young woman] really wanted an abortion. 
[The young woman] replied yes, and scheduled an appointment.</P>
<P>23.  Early that evening, [the boyfriend] came over to [the young woman]'s
house.  [The young woman] told him that she planned to have an abortion.  He was
upset, saying she was killing a baby.  Mid-evening, Kathy Tull called the

Scotts, screaming and saying such upsetting things that Connie Scott hung up the
telephone. </P>
<P>24.  Shortly thereafter someone pounded on the Scotts' door.  Carl Scott
went to answer the door, but before he could open it, defendant [the boyfriend]
kicked the door, causing it to hit Carl in the eye and [the young woman] across
the face.  Present with [the boyfriend] at the Scott home were, among others,
Kathy and John Tull, another Tull family member, and several of [the
boyfriend]'s friends. They were screaming, calling the Scotts &quot;baby killers&quot;
and other derogatory names, pulling [the young woman], and hitting Carl.  Connie
Scott called the police to the house because of the violence against her family.
 When the police arrived, including defendants Willis, Lager, Thallas, and
Scherer, [the boyfriend] struck Officer Lager and was arrested.  Kathy Tull
assaulted Connie Scott by kicking her in the stomach.  Kathy Tull was not
arrested.  Two officers asked [the young woman] if she had made an appointment
for an abortion, to which she responded, yes. </P>
<P>25.  At least one deputy from the Sheriff's Department, defendant Officer
Darrell Howard, arrived at the scene separately.  He tried to give [the young
woman] a manila envelope containing anti-abortion literature.  Earlier that day,
Officer Howard, who is active in the anti-choice movement in Blair, had met with
the Tulls at their home apparently for the purpose of preventing [the young
woman] from obtaining an abortion.  </P>
<P>26.  After the altercation, the plaintiffs and [the young woman]'s younger
brother went to their cousins' house for the night.  The plaintiffs had earlier
told the police that they would be staying at their cousins' home in Blair that
night and had given the officers their cousins' address.  </P>
<P>27.  That same day, September 28, without [the young woman]s' consent,
defendant Kathy Tull discussed [the young woman]'s pregnancy and abortion plans

with defendants Bagby and Jordan apparently for the purpose of preventing [the

young woman] from obtaining an abortion.  Defendants Bagby and Jordan
cooperated, by writing a letter stating that &quot;any elective abortion could
potentially cause medical and emotional damage to the mother at any stage of
pregnancy&quot; and that an abortion at twenty-three weeks &quot;could be
harmful&quot; to [the young woman].  (Emphasis added.)  Neither Bagby nor Jordan
had ever examined or spoken with [the young woman].  The letter did not state
that an abortion at twenty-three weeks is legal and is accepted medical
practice, nor did it note that carrying to term and delivering a child could
also be harmful to [the young woman].  Kathy Tull then took the letter to the
Blair police station.  Attached as Exhibit A is a copy of that letter.</P>
<P>28.  At around 12:30 a.m. on Thursday, September 29, the plaintiffs were
awakened by police at their cousins' house.  More than ten law enforcement
vehicles surrounded the house.  Present were members of the City of Blair Police
Department, including defendants Lager, Thallas, and Scherer, as well as county
officers, including defendants Deemer, Hillman, and Emswiler.  The police took
[the young woman] into custody.  They did so for the purpose of preventing [the
young woman] from obtaining an abortion.  </P>
<P>29.  The Scotts were told that [the young woman] was being taken into
protective custody.  The police offered the Scotts little explanation as to why
[the young woman] was being taken into custody except to show them the letter
from defendants Bagby and Jordan, and to say that defendant John E. Samson, the
County Attorney, had directed them to take [the young woman] into custody.  The
police told the Scotts there would be a hearing at 9 a.m. that morning, and
advised them to get an attorney.  They did not inform the plaintiffs where they
were taking [the young woman] or what they would do with her.  The plaintiffs
were extremely frightened and confused by the police removing [the young woman]
in the middle of the night to an undisclosed place for an undefined purpose.</P>
<P>30.  [the young woman] was taken by the police to the Blair police station. 
[The young woman] was at the police station for several hours.  During this
time, the police did not give her written notice of the reasons she was taken
into custody.  During this time, [the young woman] also noticed anti-choice
materials on one of the lockers in the station.  </P>
<P>31.  After several hours at the police station, [the young woman] was
transported to the home of a foster family who were strangers to her.  At
approximately 3:30 a.m., plaintiffs Connie and Carl Scott received a call from
Deborah Bales, whom they did not know, but who identified herself as being with
the Nebraska Department of Social Services.  Ms. Bales informed the Scotts that
[the young woman] was safe and urged them to get an attorney.</P>
<P>32.  Early Thursday morning, September 29, plaintiffs Connie and Carl Scott
sought and obtained counsel.  Their attorney was informed by defendant County
Attorney Samson that no hearing would be held that day because there were no
judges in town.  Plaintiffs Connie and Carl Scott were not told when a hearing
would be held, nor were they given the option of going to another town to appear
before a judge in order to avoid further delay.</P>
<P>33.  On Thursday morning, defendant County Attorney John Samson interrogated
[the young woman].  [The young woman] was alone throughout the questioning, even
though defendant Samson knew that she was under eighteen years of age and that
her parents were available.  Defendant Samson further knew that the Scotts had
retained counsel.  Defendant Samson also refused Deborah Bales' requests that he
release [the young woman].  Instead, he filed a baseless petition with the
Washington County Juvenile Court under the child protection law, alleging that
[the young woman] was in a situation dangerous to life or limb or injurious to
her health.  The only stated reasons for the petition were that plaintiffs
Connie and Carl Scott &quot;had made arrangements&quot; for [the young woman] to
obtain an abortion and that defendant Bagby had provided a letter to law
enforcement officials stating that an elective abortion could be harmful to [the
young woman].  A copy of the petition is attached as Exhibit B.</P>
<P>34.  On Thursday, September 29, the Scotts discovered that fliers had been
posted all over Blair stating that plaintiffs Carl and Connie Scott were &quot;murderers.&quot;
 Members of [the boyfriend]'s family and his friends were responsible for
posting the fliers.</P>
<P>35.  On Friday morning, September 30, another physical examination was
scheduled for [the young woman] in Omaha.  Connie and Carl Scott were permitted
to accompany [the young woman] to this appointment.  Deborah Bales drove the
Scotts to the appointment.  Upon completion of the examination, the doctor
informed the Scotts that he believed [the young woman] was in her twenty-seventh
week of pregnancy.</P>
<P>36.  On Friday afternoon, September 30, the Honorable F.A. Gossett, III, of
Juvenile Court of Washington County held a hearing regarding [the young woman]. 
No guardian ad litem or attorney was ever appointed to represent [the young
woman]'s interests. </P>
<P>37.  At the hearing, County Attorney Samson filed an Amended Petition
alleging that [the young woman] was in a situation dangerous or injurious to her
health or morals and that she was being neglected by her parents.  The only
evidence offered by defendant Samson to support [the young woman]'s detention
was the letter from defendants Bagby and Jordan (Ex. A), who had never examined
or spoken to [the young woman], stating that they believed an abortion at
twenty-three weeks could be harmful to [the young woman], and information given
to law enforcement that [the young woman] and her parents were going to leave on
Thursday, September 29, to explore the possibility of an abortion.  A copy of
the Amended Petition is attached as Exhibit C.  A copy of the transcript of the
hearing is attached as Exhibit D.  </P>
<P>38.  At the hearing, counsel for Connie and Carl Scott stated that, in light
of the morning examination, his clients now believed that an abortion was no
longer an option for [the young woman].</P>
<P>39.  The petition filed by defendant County Attorney Samson stated that the
allegations against plaintiffs Connie and Carl Scott were based on reports to &quot;Law
Enforcement.&quot;  The Scotts did not, however, receive written notification of
the investigation from the state Department of Social Services.  Nor were any of
the other procedures typically associated with a child abuse or neglect
investigation followed, such as the appointment of a guardian ad litem for [the
young woman].</P>
<P>40.  Upon consideration of the Amended Petition, Judge Gossett stated that
[the young woman] should not have been removed from the Scotts' custody.  Judge
Gossett ordered that the temporary placement of [the young woman] with the
Department of Social Services be terminated, and further ordered that [the young
woman] be released to the custody of her parents &quot;on the condition that no
abortion shall be performed on the subject's unborn child without further order
of the Court.&quot;  The order provides that any violation of its terms is
punishable as contempt.   A copy of the Order is attached as Exhibit E.  In
light of their impression that an abortion was no longer a possibility, Connie,
Carl and [the young woman] stipulated to the order.  At no time did [the young
woman] have independent counsel, although the decision whether or not to
continue the pregnancy was [the young woman]'s alone.</P>
<P>41.  Subsequent to the hearing, [the young woman] obtained protective orders
from the District Court of Washington County against Kathy Tull and [the
boyfriend] prohibiting them from harassing [the young woman] and entering the
Scott home.  These orders became permanent on October 14, 1994, and are still in
effect.</P>
<P>42.  After the incident, [the boyfriend] tried repeatedly to contact [the
young woman].  His friends followed [the young woman] when she left the house in
Blair.  [The young woman] was threatened with assault.  [The young woman] became
afraid to leave the house alone.  School in Blair became so threatening that
[the young woman] was tutored at home.  [The young woman] was so upset by the
events that she had to seek the advice and support of a counselor.  Connie and
Carl Scott were also harassed.  Because of the trauma to their family caused by
these events and the ongoing harassment, Connie and Carl Scott decided to move
from Blair.  They wanted [the young woman] to be able to return to school and
again be with peers.  Despite the move and passage of time, [the young woman]
continues to have nightmares.</P>
<P>43.  Subsequent to the events, [the boyfriend] pleaded guilty to assaulting
a police officer at the Scotts' house and was placed on probation for one year.</P>
<P>44.  In December 1994, [the young woman] gave birth to a baby, whom she is
raising in [the young woman]'s parents' home.</P>
<P>45.  On September 22, 1995, the plaintiffs served upon defendants Washington
County, John E. Samson, Darrell Howard, Kevin Willis, City of Blair, Joseph
Lager, Nicholas Thallas, Bernd Scherer, and John Doe I-VII tort claim notices in
the form required and provided in such cases by the laws of the State of
Nebraska concerning claims of trespass, intentional infliction of emotional
distress, invasion of privacy and interference with the rights to reproductive
choice, family integrity, due process, and freedom from illegal search and
seizure as guaranteed by the Nebraska Constitution.  </P>
<P>46.  Pursuant to the laws of the State of Nebraska, on April 24, 1996, after
having received no response to the tort claim notices, plaintiffs served the
relevant governing bodies with a notice withdrawing the tort claims from their
consideration.</P>
<P>47.  The risk of mortality from abortions performed after twenty weeks
gestation is no greater than that from childbirth.  Abortions performed up to
twenty weeks gestation are safer than childbirth.</P>
<P>48.  Law enforcement officers have a duty to a juvenile and her family,
before removing a juvenile from her home and family without a warrant or order
of the court, to determine that the juvenile is seriously endangered in her
surroundings and that immediate removal appears to be necessary for the juvenile
protection.</P>
<P>49.  At all times relevant to this complaint, officers of the Washington
County Sheriff's Department received inadequate training or no training at all
with regard to investigations of allegations of child abuse or neglect and the
legal requirements and procedures for removing juveniles from their homes.</P>
<P>50.  At all times relevant to this complaint, officers of the City of Blair
Police Department received inadequate training or no training at all with regard
to investigations of allegations of child abuse or neglect and the legal
requirements and procedures for removing juveniles from their homes.</P>
<P>51.  Upon information and belief, neither Wayne Flora nor Arnie Svenningsen,
although having knowledge of his officers' involvement in the seizure of [the
young woman], did not discipline any of such officers for their involvement.</P>
<P>52.  Upon information and belief, Chief of Police Marvin Doeden, although
having knowledge of his officers' involvement in the seizure of [the young
woman], did not discipline any of such officers for their involvement.</P>
<P><B>CLAIMS FOR RELIEF</B></P>
<P>53.  The allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 52, inclusive, are
repeated as if again set forth at length.</P>
<P>54.  By, among other things, violently trespassing into the plaintiffs'
home, assaulting [the young woman], Connie, and Carl Scott, obtaining and
providing a letter to law enforcement officials misrepresenting the danger of
abortion to [the young woman], awakening and taking [the young woman] into
custody in the middle of the night, removing her from her parents, holding her
in a police station and placing her with total strangers for over 36 hours,
interrogating [the young woman], then fifteen years of age, without counsel or
her parents present, delaying the appearance before a judge for over 29 hours
while refusing to release [the young woman], filing and pursuing a petition and
amended petition alleging that [the young woman]'s consideration of her
constitutional right to have an abortion was injurious to her and reflective of
parental neglect and lacking any evidence of abuse or neglect under Nebraska
law, prohibiting [the young woman] from attending her pre-scheduled and urgent
appointment for an abortion, and through ongoing harassment, the defendants,
willfully participating in joint activity, have interfered with and infringed
and continue to interfere with and infringe plaintiff [the young woman]'s right
to reproductive choice in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United
States Constitution.</P>
<P>55.  By, among other things, violently trespassing into the plaintiffs'
home, assaulting [the young woman] and Carl Scott, obtaining and providing a
letter to law enforcement officials misrepresenting the danger of abortion to
[the young woman], awakening and taking [the young woman] into custody in the
middle of the night, removing her from her parents, holding her in a police
station and placing her with total strangers for over 36 hours, interrogating
[the young woman], then fifteen years of age, without counsel or her parents
present, delaying the appearance before a judge for over 29 hours, while
refusing to release [the young woman], filing and pursuing a petition and
amended petition alleging that [the young woman]'s consideration of her
constitutional right to have an abortion was injurious to her and reflective of
parental neglect and lacking any evidence of abuse or neglect under Nebraska
law, prohibiting [the young woman] from attending her pre-scheduled and urgent
appointment for an abortion, and through ongoing harassment, the defendants,
willfully participating in joint activity, have interfered with and infringed
and continue to interfere with and infringe the plaintiffs' right of family
integrity in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States
Constitution.</P>
<P>56.  By, among other things, taking [the young woman] into custody in the
middle of the night, removing her from her parents, holding her in a police
station and placing her with total strangers for over 36 hours, interrogating
[the young woman], then fifteen years of age, without counsel or her parents
present, filing and pursuing a petition and amended petition alleging that [the
young woman]'s consideration of her constitutional right to have an abortion was
injurious to her and reflective of parental neglect and lacking any evidence of
abuse or neglect under Nebraska law, delaying the appearance before a judge for
over 29 hours, while refusing to release [the young woman], the defendants,
willfully participating in joint activity, deprived the plaintiffs of their
liberty without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to
the United States Constitution.</P>
<P>57.  By, among other things, forcibly and without consent, entering the
Scotts' residence, entering the residence where the plaintiffs were staying,
taking [the young woman] into custody, forcibly removing her from home and her
parents without a judicial warrant or order, probable cause, or any exigent
circumstances excusing the absence of a warrant, the defendants, willfully
participating in joint activity, violated the plaintiffs' rights in violation of
the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</P>
<P>58.  By, among other things, establishing a custom, policy and practice of
failing to train police officers about the investigations of allegations of
child abuse or neglect and the legal requirements and procedures for removing
juveniles from their homes, in deliberate indifference to the likely resulting
violations of family integrity and liberty, Washington County, through its
Sheriff, and the City of Blair, through its Chief of Police, caused [the young
woman] to be removed from her family in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth
Amendments to the United States Constitution.  </P>
<P>59.  By, among other things, removing [the young woman] from her family in
the middle of the night and detaining her, based only on a letter of a physician
and his assistant who had never seen [the young woman] which misrepresented the
danger of abortion to [the young woman], and in disregard of her constitutional
right to decide whether to have an abortion, and for the purpose of preventing
her from having an abortion, defendants John Samson, Darrell Howard, Kevin
Willis, James Deemer, Richard Hillman, Julie Emswiler, Joseph Lager, Nicholas
Thallas, and Bernd Scherer, acting in concert and outside the scope of their
official authority, subjected [the young woman] to false arrest and
imprisonment.</P>
<P>60.  By, among other things, removing [the young woman], then fifteen years
old, from her family in the middle of the night and by detaining her, based only
on a letter of a physician and his assistant who had never seen [the young
woman] which misrepresented the danger of abortion to [the young woman], and in
disregard of her constitutional right to decide whether to have an abortion, and
for the purpose of preventing [the young woman] from having an abortion and from
conferring with her family, all of which has lead to humiliating, disabling and
debilitating emotional injury for the Scott family, defendants John Samson,
James Deemer, Julie Emswiler, Richard Hillman, Darrell Howard, Joseph Lager,
Nicholas Thallas, Bernd Scherer, and Kevin Willis, acting in concert and outside
the scope of their official authority, intentionally inflicted emotional
distress upon plaintiffs.</P>

<P>61.  By, among other things, removing [the young woman] from her family in
the middle of the night and detaining her, based only on a letter of a physician
and his assistant who had never seen [the young woman] which misrepresented the
danger of abortion to [the young woman], and in disregard of her constitutional
right to decide whether to have an abortion, and for the purpose of preventing
[the young woman] from having an abortion and from conferring with her family,
defendants John Samson, Darrell Howard, Kevin Willis, James Deemer, Richard

Hillman, Julie Emswiler, Joseph Lager, Nicholas Thallas, and Bernd Scherer,
acting in concert and outside the scope of their official authority,
substantially interfered with the Scotts' seclusion, in a manner that would be
highly offensive to a reasonable person, and thus intruded upon plaintiffs'
privacy.</P>
<P>62.  By, among other things, removing [the young woman] from her family in
the middle of the night and detaining her, based only on a letter of a physician
and his assistant who had never seen [the young woman] which misrepresented the

dangers of abortion to [the young woman], in disregard of [the young woman]'s
constitutional right to an abortion, and without an allegation of immediate
harm, defendants John Samson, Darrell Howard, Kevin Willis, James Deemer,
Richard Hillman, Julie Emswiler, Joseph Lager, Nicholas Thallas, and Bernd
Scherer breached their affirmative duty to [the young woman] and her family to
disrupt the family only after ensuring the juvenile is seriously endangered and
to address any allegations of abuse with the least restraint on [the young
woman]'s freedom, thereby causing [the young woman] to suffer harm to her rights
of reproductive choice and causing violations of the Scotts' rights of family
integrity and liberty, and emotional injury, and thus rendering defendants
liable in negligence.</P>
<P>63.  By, among other things, violently trespassing into the plaintiffs' home
and assaulting and battering [the young woman], Connie, and Carl Scott,
defendants [the boyfriend], Kathy Tull and John Tull intentionally injured,
intimidated and interfered with [the young woman] because she sought to obtain
services in a facility that provides reproductive health services, including
counseling about abortion, in violation of the Freedom of Access to Clinic
Entrances Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 248.</P>
<P>64.  By, among other things, forcibly taking [the young woman] into custody
on September 29, and holding her for more than 36 hours, defendants John Samson,
Joseph Lager, Nicholas Thallas, Bernd Scherer, James Deemer, Richard Hillman and
Julie Emswiler intentionally interfered with [the young woman] because she
sought to obtain services in a facility that provides reproductive health
services, including counseling about abortion, in violation of the Freedom of
Access to Clinic Entrances Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 248.</P>
<P>65.  By, among other things, intentionally kicking in the door of the
Scotts' home, causing it to hit Carl Scott in the eye and [the young woman]
across the face, and pulling, hitting, kicking and injuring [the young woman],
Carl Scott and Connie Scott, defendants [the boyfriend] and Kathy Tull assaulted
and battered the plaintiffs.</P>
<P>66.  By, among other things, willfully, forcibly, and without consent,
entering upon the Scotts' property and kicking in their door on the night of
September 28, 1994, defendants [the boyfriend], Kathy Tull and John Tull
trespassed upon the Plaintiffs' property.</P>
<P>67.  By, among other things, obtaining and providing the above letter and
making other statements to law enforcement officials, which caused such law
enforcement officials to take [the young woman] into custody unlawfully in the
middle of the night, remove her from her parents, hold her in a police station
and place her with total strangers for over 36 hours, defendant Kathy Tull is
liable for the false arrest and imprisonment of plaintiff [the young woman].</P>
<P>68.  By, among other things, willfully, forcibly, and without consent,
entering upon the Scotts' property and kicking in their door on the night of
September 28, 1994, providing confidential medical information to third parties,
obtaining and providing a letter to law enforcement officials that
misrepresented the danger of abortion to [the young woman] and caused law
enforcement to intrude upon the home where [the young woman] was staying and
remove her from her family, and by interfering with [the young woman]'s right to
bodily integrity and autonomy with respect to her childbearing decisions and the
Scott family's right to family privacy and integrity, defendants [the
boyfriend], Kathy Tull and John Tull intruded upon plaintiffs' solitude.</P>
<P>69.  By, among other things, misusing information about [the young woman],
without ever examining her or speaking to her, to provide a misleading letter to
law enforcement officials, which caused such law enforcement officials to take
[the young woman] into custody unlawfully in the middle of the night, remove her
from her parents, hold her in a police station and place her with total
strangers for over 36 hours, defendants K.C. Bagby and James Jordan are liable
for the false arrest and imprisonment of plaintiff [the young woman].</P>
<P>70.  By, among other things, violently trespassing onto plaintiffs'
property, assaulting [the young woman], Carl and Connie Scott, calling them &quot;baby
killers,&quot; obtaining and providing a letter to law enforcement officials
that  misrepresented the danger of abortion to [the young woman] and caused such
law enforcement officials to take [the young woman] into custody in the middle
of the night, remove her from her parents, hold her in a police station and
place her with total strangers for over 36 hours, all of which, in addition to
continuing harassment, has resulted in injury to all plaintiffs including
interference with [the young woman]'s bodily autonomy regarding her decision
whether to continue her pregnancy, and all of which has led to humiliating,
disabling and debilitating emotional injury for the Scott family including, but
not limited to, [the young woman]'s inability to leave her house alone and to
continue her education at Blair High School, and the Scott family's decision to
move out of town, defendants [the boyfriend], Kathy Tull, John Tull, K.C. Bagby,
and James Jordan have intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon
plaintiffs.</P>
<P>71.  As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing actions by the
Defendants, the plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer damages.</P>

<P>I.  Declare that the seizure of plaintiff [the young woman], removal from
her family, placement in police and foster custody and interference with her
right to reproductive choice and plaintiffs' right of family integrity were
unconstitutional and tortious;</P>
<P>II.  Award plaintiffs compensatory and punitive damages, including but not
limited to damages available pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 248(c)(1)(B);</P>
<P>III.  Award plaintiffs reasonable attorneys' fees and the costs of this
action, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 248(c)(1)(B), and
any other applicable law; and </P>
<P>IV.  Award such further or other relief as the Court deems just and proper.</P>
<P>DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL</P>
<P>Plaintiffs demand trial by jury of all issues triable by jury in Lincoln,

<p>MEMORANDUM OF LAW SUBMITTED BY AMICUS CURIAE,
 AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF PENNSYLVANIA,
 IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
</p>
<p>	The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a national, non-profit organization dedicated exclusively to the preservation and promotion of civil rights and civil liberties.  The organization numbers about 300,000 members nationwide, approximately 10,000 of whom reside in Pennsylvania.  The ACLU has appeared in hundreds of cases before the United States Supreme Court in both representational and amicus curiae capacities.  The ACLU is presently involved in countless  civil liberties cases throughout the United States.  
</p>
<p>	Mr. Abu-Jamal's Motion For Preliminary Injunction claims that he has been and is being punished for publishing a book, Live From Death Row, that is highly critical of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections ("DOC").  Plaintiff asserts that since the publication of his book, the DOC has retaliated against him by prohibiting contact with the media and placing him on disciplinary segregation.  The latter sanction was imposed ostensibly for violating a policy forbidding "private businesses."  The DOC is interpreting the policy as a prohibition on any fee-for-publication arrangement.
</p>
<p>	Mr. Abu-Jamal's allegations against the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (hereafter "DOC") raise serious issues relating to freedom of expression.  As an organization dedicated not only to protecting First Amendment freedoms, but also opposed to the death penalty, ACLU members have a keen interest in reading accounts of the conditions on death row, such as Mr. Abu-Jamal's book, Live From Death Row.  If Mr. Abu-Jamal's allegations are true, the DOC's policy of prohibiting receipt of fees for any publication and prison officials' punishment of the Plaintiff as a result of the book severely chills free expression.  Such a chill works to the great disadvantage of the general public by suppressing prisoners' artistic expressions, as well as valuable information about the operation of Pennsylvania's prisons.  
</p>
<p>	A statement of the ACLU's views may be of aid to the Court in considering the Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction.  The ACLU argues below that prohibiting financial compensation  for the publication of  Live From Death Row, and punishing Mr. Abu-Jamal with disciplinary segregation for receiving compensation, violates the First Amendment to the U. S. Constitution.  This is so even in the absence of evidence that the policy or the punishment were retaliatory.  If a retaliatory motive can be proven, the constitutional violation is simply compounded.  Furthermore, although prison officials have some leeway in restricting contact with the media, uneven application of such a policy or a retaliatory motive render any consequential restrictions unconstitutional.
</p>

<h4>I.	THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO ACQUIRE INFORMATION ABOUT PRISON LIFE PRECLUDES CORRECTIONS' OFFICIALS FROM RESTRICTING A PRISONER'S RIGHT TO PUBLISH BOOKS AND COMMUNICATE WITH THE MEDIA ABSENT A SUBSTANTIAL SECURITY INTEREST THAT IS CONTENT-NEUTRAL.
</h4>
<p>	Plaintiff's Motion For Preliminary Injunction asserts claims which, if proven, raise serious concerns not only about Mr. Abu-Jamal's free speech rights, but also about the First Amendment rights of the public to receive information about Pennsylvania's prisons.  The potential recipients of expression, like the general public and news media, have a legally cognizable interest in receiving the written works of prisoners in order to learn about conditions within the Commonwealth's prisons.  Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 728 (1976).    The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the First Amendment right of the public to "read and hear" information.  Treasury Union Employees. ___ U.S. ___, ___, 115 S. Ct 1003, 1020 (1995).  Receiving information about prison life is important to ACLU members.
</p>
<p>	The public typically knows very little about life behind prison walls.  What happens behind those walls, however, is of vital public interest:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>                                 		[T]he conditions in the nation's prisons are a matter that is both newsworthy and of great public importance.  As THE CHIEF JUSTICE has commented, we cannot "continue ... to brush under the rug the problems of those who are found guilty and subject to criminal sentence . . . .  It is a melancholy truth that it has taken the tragic prison outbreaks of the past three years to focus widespread public attention on this problem."  Burger, Our Options are Limited, 18 Vill. L. Rev. 165, 167 (1972).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 831 n.7 (1974).   Today, as corrections budgets swallow larger and larger chunks of the public treasury, general knowledge about what actually happens behind those walls becomes increasingly important.
</p>
<p>	The public acquires information about prison life through media reports, interpersonal communications with prisoners, and accounts written, sung and drawn by inmates themselves.  Additionally, many great works of music, art and literature, and some not so great, have been created by people behind bars.  In the field of literature, Martin Luther King's Letter From Birmingham Jail, Henri Charriere's Papillon and the works of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn stand out.  Many of the famous southern blues artists spent time in jail.  Not only have these musicians and writers enriched our culture, but they have helped to inform public debate about corrections and the criminal justice system. 
</p>
<p>	The First Amendment right of the public to receive information from prisoners precludes prison officials from interfering unduly with outgoing correspondence and access to the media.  Vigorous enforcement of this right by the courts is essential to guarantee that the voices of future King's, Charriere's and Solzhenitsyn's will be heard, and that the taxpayers of Pennsylvania have information about the operation of the Commonwealth's prisons.
</p>

<h4>	A. 	Restrictions on Outgoing Prisoner Mail Are Subject to a Higher Level of Scrutiny than Other Infringements on Prisoners' Rights.
</h4>

<p>	Prisoners have a constitutional right to communicate with the outside world by mail.  Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401 (1989); Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396 (1974). 
While the Supreme Court has curtailed many prisoners' rights in recent years, see, e.g., Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987) (applying "reasonableness standard" to correspondence between inmates), the right of prisoners to send mail to the outside world has retained greater respect and protection.  In Thornburgh v. Abbott, the Court extended Turner's "reasonableness" standard of review to incoming general mail.  The Court expressly left in place, however, a higher standard for outgoing correspondence: 
<blockquote>		
                                [T]he logic of our analyses in [Procunier v.]Martinez [416 U.S. 396 (1974)] and Turner requires that Martinez be limited to regulations concerning outgoing correspondence. . . .  The implications of outgoing correspondence for prison security are of a categorically lesser magnitude than the implications of incoming materials.  490 U.S. at 413 (italics added).  Accord, Bieregu v. Reno, No. 94-5719, Slip Op. at 18 (3d Cir. July 11, 1995)  (opening and reading legal mail "chills protected expression and may inhibit the inmate's ability to speak, protest and complain openly, directly and without reservation with the court"). 
</blockquote>
<p>	In the context of cases involving the right of media access, the Supreme Court has recognized the importance of protecting this right of prisoners to send out information about life in prison.  In  Houchins v. KQED, Inc., 438 U.S. 1 (1978) , the Court stated as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>		[The government] cannot prevent respondents from learning about jail conditions in a variety of ways, albeit not as conveniently as they might prefer. [The news media and public] have a First Amendment right to receive letters from inmates criticizing jail officials and reporting on conditions.
</blockquote>
<p>Id. at 15.  Similarly, in Pell the Court held that it is clear that the medium of written correspondence affords inmates an open and substantially unimpeded channel for communication with persons outside the prison, including representatives of the news media.
</p>
<p>417 U.S. at 824.  Writing and sending a book manuscript or a demo tape of songs to a publisher is a form of constitutionally protected expression.  Such communication is practically and legally indistinguishable from other outgoing correspondence.  Although the Third Circuit has not ruled on the issue, some courts have accorded communication with the media the same confidentiality and protection as is given to legal mail.  Guajardo, 580 F.2d at 759; Taylor v. Sterrett, 532 F.2d 462, 481-82 (5th Cir. 1976); Travis v. Lockhart, 607 F. Supp. 1082 (E.D. Ark. 1985); Burton v. Foltz, 599 F. Supp. 114 (E.D. Mich. 1984).  These courts have held that mail to the media is essential to protect not only the interests of the inmates, but also the interest of the public in learning about prison conditions.  Restrictions on such outgoing correspondence are more difficult to justify because the dangers "of [such] outgoing correspondence for prison security are of a categorically lesser magnitude" than the dangers posed by other prisoner contacts with the outside world.  Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 413.  
</p>
<p>	Even if the heightened standard applied to legal mail is not extended to media contacts, prison officials can justify restrictions on prisoners' First Amendment right to communicate by mail with the media and publishing houses only if they satisfy the Martinez test: the restrictions must  (1) "further an important or substantial governmental interest [in security, order or rehabilitation] unrelated to the suppression of expression"; and (2) "the limitation of First Amendment freedoms [must be] no greater than is necessary or essential to the protection of the particular governmental interest involved."  416 U.S. at 413.
<h4>	
	B.	Restrictions on a Prisoner's Access to the Media Cannot Be Imposed Discriminatorily or Be Motivated by a Desire to Suppress the Contents of Inmate Communication Simply Because it Is Critical of Prison Officials.
</h4>
<p>	Prisoners also have a First Amendment right of access to the media.  Pell, 417 U.S. at 822.  The Court has permitted some reasonable restrictions on this right.  See, e.g., Houchins, 438 U.S. 1 (1978) (news media have no special right of access to prisons over and above that of other persons); Pell, 417 U.S. 817 (1974) (upholding constitutionality of rule prohibiting press from interviewing "specific individual inmates"); Saxbe v. Washington Post Co., 417 U.S. 843 (1974) (upholding constitutionality of regulation prohibiting some face-to-face press interviews).    At a minimum, however, any restrictions must be imposed in a non-discriminatory and content neutral manner, and must provide alternative channels of communication if face-to-face press interviews are restricted.  Pell, 417 U.S. at 827-28.
</p>
<p>	"Content-neutrality" has a peculiar meaning in prisoners' rights law.  Regulations and practices in prison generally must "further an important governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression."   Turner, 482 U.S. at 413 (emphasis added).  Although the Court repeatedly speaks of the need for regulation of First Amendment rights "without regard to the content of the expression," Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 415, quoting Turner, 482 U.S. at 90, drawing "distinctions between publications on the basis of their potential implications for prison security" is considered "neutral" and, therefore,  permissible content-based censorship.  Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at  415.  
</p>
<p>	Impermissible "content-based" censorship in the prison setting entails suppression or discouragement of "unflattering or unwelcome opinions."  Martinez, 416 U.S. at 413; Andolina, 826 F.2d at 1268.  The Thornburgh Court elaborated on this impermissible type of censorship: 
</p>
<p>		In Martinez, the regulations barred writings that "unduly complain" or "magnify grievances," express "inflammatory political, racial, religious or other views," or are "defamatory" or "otherwise inappropriate."  We found in Martinez that "[t]hese regulations fairly invited prison officials and employees to apply their own personal prejudices and opinions as standards for prisoner mail censorship," and that the purpose of the regulations had not been found "unrelated to the suppression of expression."  The regulations at issue in Martinez , therefore, were decidedly not "neutral" in the relevant sense.
</p>
<p>Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 416 n.14 (citations omitted).  In other words, disapproval of expression in the absence of any significant governmental interest in security, order or rehabilitation is prohibited.
</p>
<h4>II.	THE DOC'S POLICY OF PROHIBITING PRISONERS FROM RECEIVING PAYMENT FOR THE PUBLICATION OF BOOKS VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT.
</h4>
<p>	The DOC's placement of Mr. Abu-Jamal on disciplinary segregation because publication of his book for profit violated a DOC policy against operating "private businesses" is unconstitutional.  The DOC may, consistent with the U.S. Constitution,  prohibit inmates from engaging in a business or profession, French v. Butterworth, 614 F.2d 23, 24 (1st Cir. 1980), but it may not extend that policy to encompass the publication of a book, such as Live From Death Row, about matters of public concern.
</p>
<p>	Regardless whether the DOC's motivation was illicit,  Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v.  Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, ___, 112 S. Ct. 501. 509 (1991) ("[i]llicit legislative intent is not the sina quo non of a violation of the First Amendment"), application of the policy prohibiting "private businesses" to prevent  inmates from receiving financial remuneration for the publication of written materials is unconstitutional.  The DOC's overbroad application of the policy effectively penalizes inmates for publishing constitutionally protected material. 
</p>
<p>	Even though the DOC did not (nor could it) actually prohibit Mr. Abu-Jamal from publishing the book, penalizing him for receiving financial remuneration from the publisher is similarly unconstitutional.   United States v. National Treasury Employees Union, ___ U. S. ___, 115 S. Ct. 1003 (1995);   Simon &amp; Schuster, supra; Andolina, 826 F.2d at 868.  In National Treasury Employees Union the Court held unconstitutional a law that prohibited federal employees from accepting any compensation for making speeches or writing articles.  Id.  Even though the law neither prohibited speech, per se, nor drew content-based distinctions, the financial penalty was ruled unconstitutional:
<blockquote>
		[The law's] prohibition on compensation unquestionably imposes a significant burden on expressive activity.  See Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v.  Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105 (1991); see also Arkansas Writers' Project , Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 227-231 (1987); Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575 (1983).  Publishers compensate authors because compensation provides a significant incentive toward more expression.  By denying respondents that incentive, the honoraria ban induces them to curtail their expression if they wish to continue working for the Government.
</blockquote>
<p>___ U. S. at ___, 115 S. Ct. at 1014 (citations in original) (footnote omitted).  See also, id. at 1020 (O'Connor, concurring) (recognizing that imposition of financial burdens has a direct effect on incentives to speak).  
</p><p>	Likewise, in striking down New York's "Son of Sam law," which escrowed the profits of publications by criminals, the Court recognized that financial burdens "operate as a disincentive to speak" and are, therefore, constitutionally suspect. Simon &amp; Schuster, 502 U.S. at ___, 112 S. Ct. at 508 - 09.  
</p><p>	
In this case, the DOC's application of a policy against private businesses to prohibit prisoners from receiving remuneration for publishing books is unconstitutional under both National Treasury Employees Union and Simon &amp; Schuster.  Similarly, punishing inmates for receiving such payment is also unconstitutional.  As the Third Circuit stated in holding unconstitutional the punishment of an inmate who wrote a letter critical of the prison,  it is immaterial that the officials did not interfere directly with the mailing of the letter.  If prison officials cannot censor unflattering statements made in letters to outsiders, they also may not punish an inmate for the contents of such letters.
</p>
<p>Andolina, 826 F.2d at 1268.  Punishing an inmate for profiting from a publication can no more be tolerated than interfering directly with the dissemination of constitutionally protected expression.
</p>
<p>	An injunction against continued application of the policy will not affect the DOC's security interests.  If the introduction of currency into the prison is a security concern, a more narrowly tailored policy can be implemented restricting the amount of money that may actually enter the prison.  Although it is difficult to conceive of a situation whereby prison officials could show a compelling interest in security to justify prohibiting profits, they could still do so on a case by case basis.  Application of the policy to all prisoner publications is, however, unjustifiable and unconstitutional.
</p>
<p>	Accordingly, this court should enjoin the DOC's application of the policy prohibiting private business to publication for profit and declare that Mr. Abu-Jamal's thirty day sentence to disciplinary segregation for violating the policy was unconstitutional.
</p>
<h4>III.	ANY DOC ACTIONS AGAINST MR. ABU-JAMAL THAT WERE TAKEN IN RETALIATION FOR THE PUBLICATION OF LIVE FROM DEATH ROW ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
</h4>
<p>	If Plaintiff proves that the DOC disapproved of Live From Death Row and retaliated against him because of it, both the segregation sentence and the prohibition on access to media are unconstitutional.  White v. Napoleon, 897 F.2d 103, 111-12 (3d Cir. 1990) ("Retaliation for the exercise of constitutionally protected rights is itself a violation of rights secured by the Constitution. . . ."); Millhouse v. Carlson, 652 F.2d 371, 373 (3d Cir. 1981).  Even the withdrawal of privileges that enjoy no independent constitutional protection, such as housing in general population, Sandin v. Connor, 63 U.S.L.W. 4601 (U.S. June 19, 1995) (30 day disciplinary segregation sentence does not raise due process claim), become unconstitutional when inflicted in retaliation for the exercise of a constitutionally protected right.  White, 897 F.2d at 106 (institution of disciplinary process); Andolina, 826 F.2d at 1267 (30 days disciplinary segregation); Millhouse, 652 F.2d at 372 (transfer to less desirable housing); Flanagan v. Shively, 783 F. Supp. 922, 931 (M.D. Pa. 1992) ("Transfer to another institution is a violation of plaintiff's rights only if ordered in retaliation for his exercise of constitutional rights") (citations omitted). 
</p>
<p>	Similarly, if defendants' conduct was motivated by a disapproval of the book, any relatively disadvantageous treatment of Mr. Abu-Jamal is unconstitutional.  Andolina v. Brooks, 826 F.2d 1266, 1268 (3d Cir. 1987) ("may not punish inmates for statements made in letters to outsiders, even if the same statement would be grounds for punishment if made orally to prison guards"), quoting McNamara v. Moody, 606 F.2d 621, 624 (5th Cir. 1979).  In Main Road v. Aytch, the Third Circuit ruled that the First Amendment prohibits prison officials from granting or denying a prisoner's interviews with the press based on the expected content of that interview.  522 F.2d 1080 (3d Cir. 1975).  The court stated, in relevant part, that the
</p>
<p>		First Amendment precludes [a prison official] from regulating, through the grant or denial of permission for prisoners to talk with reporters, the content of speech which reaches the news media, unless the restriction bears a substantial relationship to a significant governmental interest.
</p>
<p>Id. at 1086-87.  See also,   Kimberlin v. Quinlan, 774 F. Supp. 1 (D.D.C. 1991) ("if [prison] officials were motivated by a purpose to keep Kimberlin from speaking to the press because of the content of his expected communications [e.g., about vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle's alleged marijuana use], their conduct violated a well established right...."), rev'd on other grounds, 6 F.3d 789 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (plaintiff failed to meet heightened pleading standard that is applicable whenever officials' state of mind at issue), vacated and remanded in light of Johnson v. Jones, 67 U.S.L.W. 4556 (U.S. June 12, 1995) (No. 93-2068). 
</p>
<p>	Therefore, evidence that the defendants' actions were motivated either by a desire to punish Mr. Abu-Jamal for writing Live From Death Row or by an effort to suppress the criticism contained therein renders the prohibition on media contact unconstitutional.  If that is the case, this Court should enjoin the ban on media contact.  Moreover, unless such illicit conduct is penalized appropriately, the chill on future expression by Mr. Abu-Jamal and other prison writers will be palpable.
</p>
<h4>IV.	CONCLUSION
</h4>
<p>	Regardless whether Mr. Abu-Jamal can prove that DOC officials acted with the illicit purpose of retaliating against him for writing Live From Death Row or in an effort to suppress the criticism contained in the book, the DOC policy prohibiting financial remuneration for publishing a book is unconstitutional.  If Mr. Abu-Jamal proves that DOC officials retaliated against him for publishing the book, or to suppress discussion of it, then the prohibition on media interviews also is unconstitutional.

<blockquote>
<p>Appellees claim in this litigation that Louisiana's
congressional redistricting plan (Act 1) is a racial gerrymander
that violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection
Clause.  While their claim's primary focus is District 4, a
majority-minority district, appellees live in District 5. The
District Court invalidated Act 1, and the State and the United
States, which had precleared Act 1 pursuant to its authority
under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, appealed directly to this
Court.
</p>
<h4>Held:
</h4>
<p>Appellees lack standing to challenge Act 1. This Court has
recognized that a generalized grievance against allegedly
illegal governmental conduct is insufficient to provide
standing, see, e.g., Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans
United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464,
and has applied that rule in the equal protection context, see
Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 755.  Thus, appellees' position
that &quot;anybody in the State&quot; can state a racial gerrymander claim
is rejected, and they must show that they, personally, have been
subjected to a racial classification.  Appellees, however, have
pointed to no evidence tending to show that they have suffered
personal injury, and review of the record has revealed none.
Assuming arguendo that the evidence here is sufficient to state
a claim under Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. ___, with respect to
District 4, it does not prove that the State Legislature
intended District 5 to have a particular racial composition.
Similarly, the fact that Act 1 affects all Louisiana voters by
classifying each of them as a member of a particular
congressional district does not mean that every voter has
standing to challenge Act 1 as a racial classification.  The
Court's holding in Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, that an
individual has the right not to be excluded from a jury on
account of race does not support appellees' position.  A juror
so excluded has personally suffered the race-based harm
recognized in Powers, and it is the fact of personal injury that
appellees have failed to establish here.  Pp. 5-11.  
</p>
<p>862 F. Supp.  119, vacated and remanded.

which Souter, J., joined.  Stevens, J., filed an opinion

<P>CONCLUSION</P>
<HR>
<H4>PRELIMINARY STATEMENT</H4>
<P>This appeal and cross-appeal arise out of a final judgment and permanent
injunction entered by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New
York (Nickerson, J.) on March 30, 1995.  See Joint Appendix (JA) 200A.  The
opinion was reported at 880 F. Supp. 968 (E.D.N.Y. 1995).  The government
appeals the district court's determination that 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(b)(2), part
of the recently-enacted &quot;Policy concerning homosexuality in the armed
forces,&quot; violates plaintiffs' constitutional rights to free expression and
equal protection.  JA 162.  Plaintiffs cross-appeal from the determination that
they lack standing to challenge 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(b)(1) on the same grounds. 
JA 147.</P>
<H4>STATEMENT OF SUBJECT MATTER AND APPELLATE JURISDICTION</H4>
<P>The district court had subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167;
1331.  After the entry of judgment, the government filed a timely notice of
appeal on May 24, 1995, and the plaintiffs filed a timely notice of cross-appeal
on June 6, 1995.  JA 201 &amp; 204.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28
U.S.C. &#167; 1291.</P>
<H4>STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES</H4>
<P>1.  Does 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654 (the &quot;Act&quot;), which directly and
purposefully punishes statements and expressive behavior on the basis of their
content and viewpoint, violate the First Amendment?
</P>
<P>2.  Does the classification created by the Act, which singles out for
special punishment lesbians and gay men whose sexual orientation becomes known
through their statements or behavior, violate the equal protection clause?
</P>
<P>3.  May plaintiffs challenge the portion of the Act that addresses &quot;homosexual
acts,&quot; &#167; 654(b)(1), as well as the portion that addresses &quot;statements,&quot;
&#167; 654(b)(2)?
</P>
<H4>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</H4>
<P><B>A. NATURE OF THE CASE</B></P>
<P>Plaintiffs, a lesbian and five gay men serving in the armed forces, brought
this suit on March 7, 1994, to challenge the entire Act and its Department of
Defense implementing directives (the Directives) -- a pervasive scheme that
restricts their speech and behavior 24 hours a day, seven days a week, on or off
duty, on or off base -- on First Amendment and equal protection grounds. 
Amended Complaint (JA 94).(1)  The challenged scheme, accurately dubbed &quot;Don't
Ask, Don't Tell,&quot; implements Congress's purpose of keeping all lesbian and
gay service members anonymous and hidden by providing for the discharge of any
lesbian or gay man who says or does anything that would allow other service
members to discover their non-heterosexual orientation.  Plaintiffs contend that
the scheme rests entirely on irrational and illegitimate purported
justifications, and that therefore its restrictions on expression and behavior
cannot survive any level of constitutional scrutiny.  The Act certainly cannot
survive the exacting scrutiny required by governing First Amendment law, under
which defendants bear the burden of proof.</P>
<P>The important constitutional issues raised here cannot be answered simply by
invoking the talismans of &quot;homosexual acts&quot; and &quot;military
effectiveness.&quot;  Although the government attempts to ground the entire
policy in an alleged need to prohibit &quot;homosexual acts,&quot;(2) neither
Congress nor the government has ever even articulated any reason why the Act
might be necessary (1) to punish private, consensual sexual behavior which is
not punished when engaged in by heterosexuals and (2) to punish sexual
misconduct -- sexual harassment, sexual assault, oral or anal sex, etc. -- more
severely when engaged in by lesbians and gay men than they are when engaged in
by heterosexuals.  Likewise, underneath the &quot;military effectiveness&quot;
concerns emphasized by defendants, one finds no assertions that gay people are
not good soldiers, nor any other supposed incapacity on their part, but instead
the fear that heterosexuals will disrupt military operations if they know they
are serving alongside lesbians and gay men.  This Court must look behind the
mantra of eradicating &quot;homosexual acts&quot; -- the (imaginary) need for
which the government simply presumes -- and vague references to &quot;military
effectiveness&quot; and examine whether Congress in fact had

constitutionally-sufficient, legitimate grounds for adopting the Act.</P>
<P><B>B. THE REGULATORY SCHEME AT ISSUE</B></P>
<P><B>1. The History of the Act</B></P>
<P>From the 1940s until 1993, various Department of Defense (&quot;DoD&quot;)
policies aimed to keep gay men and lesbians out of the armed services.  The
policy that immediately preceded the Act, in effect from 1981 to 1993, intended
&quot;to keep homosexuals out of the service&quot; and was explicitly based on
the belief that &quot;homosexuality is incompatible with military service.&quot;
 Memorandum from Deputy Secretary of Defense W. Graham Claytor, Jr., announcing
promulgation of 1981 DoD Directive 1332.14 (Plaintiffs' Trial Exhibit 160); 32
C.F.R. &#167; 41, app. A, pt. 1(H) (1992).  As Senator Nunn summarized in 1993, &quot;[u]nder
our current law and regulations, gay men and lesbians are not permitted to serve
in the armed forces of the United States.&quot;  S. Hrg. 103-845 at 2 (Joint
Trial Exhibit (JX) 1, Vol.1).</P>
<P>Early in 1993, President Clinton proposed lifting that ban and &quot;ending
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation&quot; in military personnel
policy, Memorandum from President Clinton to Secretary of Defense, dated January
29, 1993 (JA 1680), a move that triggered intense political debate about whether
the ban should be maintained, altered, or abolished.  The Act is the result of
that political process.  Its provisions were initially announced by President
Clinton on July 19, 1993, see Remarks Announcing the New Policy on Gays and
Lesbians in the Military (JA 2281), and were later enacted as part of the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994.</P>
<P>General Colin Powell, testifying before the Senate Committee on Armed
Services, accurately pinpointed the governing terms of the 1993 debate:  </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>On the one hand are those who believe that homosexuals should be allowed to
openly serve. . . .  On the other hand are those of us who believe that the
presence of open homosexuality would have an unacceptable detrimental and
disruptive impact on the cohesion, morale, and esprit of the Armed Forces.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>S. Hrg. No. 103-845 at 707-08 (JA 247-48) (emphasis supplied); see also id.
at 708 (JA 247-48) (General Powell making clear that, in contrast, &quot;[h]omosexuals
over history who have been willing to keep their orientation private have been
successful members&quot; of military teams and concern is not about, for
example, &quot;homosexuals seducing heterosexuals&quot;).  Similarly, President
Clinton's announcement of the provisions that became the Act emphasized that
opponents of completely lifting the prior ban were &quot;clearly focused not on
the conduct of individual gay service members, but on how non-gay service
members feel about gays in general and, in particular, those in the military
service&quot; if their orientation becomes known.  JA 2281.  See also Office of
the Secretary of the Defense, Summary Report of the Military Working Group (JA
1692) (&quot;The MWG found that the presence of open homosexuals in a unit
would, in general, polarize and fragment the unit. . . .  This phenomenon occurs
whether or not homosexual acts are involved.&quot;)(3)</P>
<P>The legislative record establishes that the Act, rather than addressing any
inherently harmful behavior, stems from the fear that communication of a gay or
lesbian identity -- through either behavior or statements -- may trigger
displeasure or even disruptive reactions in others, and therefore pose &quot;an
unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline,
and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability,&quot; 10 U.S.C. &#167;
654(a)(15).  As Judge Nickerson found, JA 188-90, the congressional hearings and
reports are replete with discussion emphasizing that the danger feared by those
in favor of the Act came from the possibility that gay and lesbian service
members might allow others to know their sexual orientation, as non-gay service
members do.(4)</P>
<P>The legislative history also makes clear why military leaders and members of
Congress feared the communication that a service member was gay:  because of the
anticipated negative reaction of others.  See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 103-112 at 278
(JA 701) (behavior or statements that signify a gay identity are &quot;too far
away from the norm&quot; and, because of the reaction of fellow service members,
will assertedly &quot;undercut[] the cohesion of the group&quot;); id. at 280
(JA 703) (General Schwarzkopf testifying that &quot;polarization&quot; and &quot;morale
br[eak]down&quot; among others occur if it &quot;be[comes] known in a unit that
someone [is] openly homosexual&quot;);  id. (Lieutenant General Waller
testifying about other members' discomfort if asked to serve with &quot;an
individual who is openly homosexual&quot; on &quot;a 24 hour basis, day in and
day out&quot;); S. Hrg. No. 103-845 at 170 (JX-1, Vol.1) (Senator Warner's
opinion that fully lifting the ban &quot;[w]ould compel the U.S. military to
accept openly and acknowledge the existence of a class of people whose lifestyle
is found by many Americans to be unacceptable&quot;); id. at 539 (JX-1, Vol.2)
(Lieutenant John Burnham stating that forcing heterosexuals to serve &quot;in
often intimate conditions with open homosexuals would be distinctly
uncomfortable to the point of distraction&quot;; in contrast, &quot;[w]hen
homosexuals are exceedingly discreet about their lifestyle there has been no
effect on the  Pledger testifying that &quot;I do not think there is any
physical or mental or any other difference in their capabilities compared with
the heterosexual.  But as we have been talking about all day, it is the
attitudes of the majority of the heterosexuals and their reactions&quot; that
creates the problem); id. at 584 (JA 231) (Captain David Wolf testifying that
with &quot;someone who is not only homosexual but is openly homosexual . . . the
members of the Marine Corps . . . abhor that lifestyle, or simply will not
accept that person as a member of a team&quot;).</P>
<P>Thus, unlike its predecessor DoD policies, the Act is not based on the
notion that gay men and lesbians are, in some way, innately or inevitably &quot;incompatible
with military service.&quot;  Compare 32 C.F.R. &#167; 41, app. A, pt. 1(H)
(1992) with 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654.  Whereas prior policies deemed gay people
unfit because homosexuality was believed to be a mental illness, or because gay
people were thought to pose some distinct security risk, any assertions that
lesbians and gay men are less capable have now been abandoned.(5)  As former
Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and high-ranking military officials conceded
before Congress, gay men and women are capable of serving, have served, and are
serving in the military with distinction.  S. Hrg. No. 103-845 at 612, 702 &amp;
707 (JA 240, 244 &amp; 247) (testimony of General Schwarzkopf, Secretary Aspin,
General Powell).  The President emphasized that &quot;there is no study showing
[gay men and lesbians] to be less capable or more prone to misconduct than
heterosexual soldiers.&quot;  Remarks Announcing New Policy (JA 2281).</P>
<P>Nor is the Act, notwithstanding its repeated references to &quot;acts&quot;
and &quot;conduct,&quot; the result of the military's or lawmakers' concern
about any purported harm to the military mission that might be caused by the
sexual behavior of gay men and lesbians.  The legislative history is devoid of
any effort to claim that, for example, private, off-base, off-duty sexual
behavior by a gay soldier with someone unconnected to the military would imperil
military capability.  Unable to offer any rationale for the Act's blanket
punishment of any and all &quot;homosexual acts&quot; qua acts, the government
merely asserts the conclusory and circular need to prevent these acts.  See
Gov't Br. at 35; see also 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(a)(13) (asserting, without
explanation, that &quot;[t]he prohibition against homosexual conduct . . .
continues to be necessary&quot;).</P>
<P>Moreover, any sexual behavior that might cause harm to the military's work
-- including sexual assault, sexual harassment, fraternization, and &quot;conduct
unbecoming an officer&quot; -- is addressed on a sexual orientation-neutral
basis by the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and DoD regulations that
exist separate and apart from the Act.  See DoD Directive 1332.14 Part (k) &amp;
Part 2 (1994) (JA 327-39 &amp; 332-41); 10 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 880-1, 890-93,
920, 921, 928 &amp; 933-34.(6)  Sexual misconduct such as sexual harassment or
private, consensual oral or anal sex triggers a discretionary review for a
heterosexual service member that could well preserve the service member's
military career.  See DoD Directive 1332.14 Part 1(K)(1)(a) (JA 327-28) (&quot;[a]
member may be separated for misconduct when it is determined under the guidance
set forth in section A of part 2 that the member is unqualified for further
military service by reason of&quot; disciplinary infractions, a pattern of
misconduct, or commission of a serious offense).  The review process applicable
to misconduct not involving lesbians or gay men is guided by the fact that &quot;[t]here
is a substantial investment in the training of persons enlisted or inducted into
the Military Services&quot;; factors such as the member's service record and &quot;potential

for advancement or leadership&quot; must be considered.  Id. at Part 2(A)(2)(a) &amp;
(d) (JA 332-33).  On the other hand, the very same behavior would require a
mandatory discharge for a lesbian or gay service member under the Act.  10

U.S.C. &#167; 654(b)(1).</P>
<P><B>2. The Requirements of the Act and Directives</B></P>
<P>Although the legislative history shows that preventing the communication
that a service member is gay or lesbian is the purpose behind the entire policy,
the Act and Directives are written to draw attention away from that purpose.  By
confusingly defining terms like &quot;homosexual act&quot; and &quot;homosexual
conduct&quot; to include statements and expressive conduct as well as intimate
conduct, the Act and Directives try to make it appear as if sexual conduct is
the focus of the Act -- for some unarticulated reason -- when in fact
communication of a lesbian or gay identity is the policy's real target.</P>

<P>The Act mandates that &quot;[a] member of the armed forces shall be
separated&quot; if one or more of three findings is made:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(1) that the &quot;member has engaged in, attempted to engage in, or
solicited another to engage in a homosexual act or acts&quot; -- with &quot;homosexual
act&quot; expansively defined as &quot;any bodily contact, actively undertaken
or passively permitted, between members of the same sex for purposes of
satisfying sexual desires&quot; or &quot;any bodily contact which a reasonable
person would understand to demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in&quot;
such sexual acts;(7)</P>
<P>(2) that the &quot;member has stated that he or she is homosexual or
bisexual, or words to that effect&quot;; or</P>
<P>(3) that the &quot;member has married or attempted to marry a person known
to be of the same biological sex.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(b) &amp; (f)(3).(8)  Thus, any act or statement that
could reveal a service member's gay identity to others will result in discharge.</P>
<P>The Act provides that a service member who has made one of  the covered
statements or engaged in any of the covered behavior may avoid discharge if he
or she demonstrates certain facts, including that he or she does not have a &quot;propensity
or intent to engage in homosexual acts.&quot;  10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(b)(1)(E)
(emphasis supplied).  Although the government now tries to portray this as a
device that permits some open lesbians and gay men to remain in the service, the
terms of the statute itself and its legislative history show that it was
designed to retain only heterosexuals.  </P>
<P>The statute defines a &quot;homosexual&quot; as &quot;a person, regardless
of sex, who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or
intends to engage in homosexual acts, and explicitly includes the terms `gay'
and `lesbian'.&quot;  10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(f)(1) (emphasis supplied).  Thus, to
remain in the service the member must prove that he or she is really not gay or
lesbian.  See JA 182-83.  As the Senate report explains:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>[O]nce the government introduces evidence that the member has stated that he
or she is a homosexual, the burden shifts to the member and remains with the
member throughout the proceeding to demonstrate that he or she is not a
homosexual as defined in the statute. . . . [A] member cannot rebut the
presumption simply through a promise to adhere to military standards of conduct
in the future nor can the member rebut the presumption by a statement to the
effect that he or she has a propensity towards homosexuality but has not acted
on it. . . . [T]he member bears the burden of persuading the fact-finder by a
preponderance of the evidence that the rebuttal is more credible than the
original statement (e.g., by proving that the original statement was made in
jest).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>S. Rep. No. 103-112 at 294 (JA 717) (emphasis supplied).  See also S. Hrg.

103-845 at 746 (JA 252) (Secretary Aspin answering &quot;Correct&quot; to
Senator Bryan's query &quot;So, the rebuttable presumption is a rebuttable
presumption that the individual then, in effect, would carry the burden of
establishing that he or she was not homosexual?&quot;).(9)  That the Department
of Defense has deemed &quot;propensity&quot; to &quot;indicate a likelihood that
a person engages in or will engage in homosexual acts&quot; does not provide any
additional precision or make the presumption rebuttable by a lesbian or gay
service member.(10)  Instead, the &quot;rebuttable presumption&quot; allows a
service member who is in fact heterosexual, but who said otherwise or engaged in
a &quot;homosexual act,&quot; to remain in the military, see 10 U.S.C. &#167;
654(b)(1)(E),(11) while a member whose true homosexuality has been revealed must
be discharged.  Thus it cannot be the &quot;acts&quot; themselves that are the
military's concern; for if that were true all who participated in them would be
punished.  Rather, the root purpose of the scheme is to eliminate from the
military lesbian and gay members who become known, whether through acts or
otherwise.</P>

<P><B>C. PROCEEDINGS IN THE COURT BELOW</B></P>
<P>Plaintiffs filed this action on March 7, 1994, shortly after the February 28
effective date of the Directives, seeking a declaration that the Act and
Directives are unconstitutional and a permanent injunction against their
enforcement.  JA 94.  In response to the threat of discharge proceedings based
on plaintiffs' statements about their sexual orientation, the district court
enjoined the government from taking any adverse action against plaintiffs based
on their self-identification as lesbian or gay.  JA 35 &amp; 66.  On September
14, 1994, the district court denied the government's motion to dismiss
plaintiffs' free expression and equal protection claims.  JA 71, reported at 863
F. Supp. 112 (E.D.N.Y. 1994).  The government appealed the preliminary
injunctions to this Court, which ordered that they stay in effect until March
30, 1995, and remanded for trial.  JA 83, reported at 44 F.3d 128 (2d Cir.
1995).</P>
<P><B>D. THE ORDERS APPEALED FROM</B></P>
<P>The government appeals from the district court's final order, dated March
30, 1995, in which the court held that the Act and Directives violate
plaintiffs' rights to freedom of expression under the First Amendment and equal
protection under the Fifth Amendment.  JA 162.  The court analyzed the Act and
Directives, their legislative history, and the additional evidence presented at
trial and concluded that the policy is a content-based restriction on &quot;important,
not trivial, speech&quot; -- the expression of a gay or lesbian sexual
orientation.  JA 172.  The court found this burden on speech unjustified under
the deferential First Amendment standard propounded in Brown v. Glines, 444 U.S.
348, 355 (1980), because the justifications found in the legislative history
boil down to &quot;heterosexual animosity towards homosexuals [which] is by its
terms based on irrational prejudices.&quot;  JA 190.  The court also found that
even if the purpose of the Act were not illegitimate, the First Amendment &quot;surely
would require a legislative finding that the consequences of disclosure would be
infinitely more serious than anything revealed in the record before Congress.&quot;
 JA 196-97.  The government's argument that the so-called &quot;rebuttable
presumption&quot; provision redeems the policy was rejected, the court finding
the policy's &quot;semantic gymnastics&quot; to be &quot;nothing less than
Orwellian&quot; and the presumption to be an &quot;ignis fatuus&quot; for gay
and lesbian service members.  JA 181-82.  </P>
<P>The court also held that the Act violates equal protection under the
fundamental rights prong because it failed to serve a &quot;substantial
government interest&quot; which would support the differential burden on
plaintiffs' First Amendment rights.  JA 198-99.  As in the First Amendment
analysis, the court held that the Act could not be justified by the &quot;desire[]
to insulate heterosexual servicemembers from statements that might excite their
prejudices.&quot;  JA 199.</P>
<P>Plaintiffs cross-appeal from the district court's order entered on March 14,
1995, in which the court held that plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the &quot;acts&quot;
provision of the policy because they had not alleged that they could identify
third-party participants who would engage in sexual behavior with them.  JA 147.
 </P>
<P><B>E. STANDARD OF REVIEW</B></P>
<P>This Court reviews the constitutional standards that govern plaintiffs'
claims and applications of those standard to the record de novo.  Bose Corp. v.
Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S. 485 (1984); United States v.
Bianco, 998 F.2d 1112, 1120 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1644
(1994).  The district court's &quot;[f]indings of fact, whether based on oral or
documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.&quot; 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).</P>
<P>Because the district court found standing to challenge 10 U.S.C. &#167;
654(b)(1) lacking based upon the complaint and undisputed factual evidence, this
Court reviews the standing issue de novo.  Rent Stabilization Ass'n v. Dinkins,
5 F.3d 591, 594 (2d Cir. 1993).</P>
<H4>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</H4>
<P>1.  The Act is designed to keep lesbian and gay service members from
communicating their sexual orientation to others through statements or behavior.
 This content- and viewpoint-based suppression of a particular message -- that a
soldier or sailor is gay or lesbian -- raises First Amendment concerns of the
highest magnitude and is presumptively unconstitutional.  See Simon &amp;
Schuster v. New York State Crime Victims Board, 502 U.S. 105, 115 (1991); United
States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310, 318 (1990). </P>
<P>The government seeks to silence those with a gay or lesbian identity to

avoid a feared negative reaction on the part of disapproving heterosexuals,
which will assertedly cause some disruption within military units.  Such worry
about the reaction of others, however, is a constitutionally-illegitimate basis
for government action, even when the government speculates that intense feelings

and possible disturbance among the listeners will result.  See Texas v. Johnson,
491 U.S. 397, 414 (1989).</P>
<P>Moreover, were defendants somehow to establish that Congress's and the
military's worries about &quot;unit cohesion&quot; and &quot;homosexual acts&quot;
reflect a legitimate government interest, the government still cannot satisfy
its burden of proof to justify the Act's censorship.  The government has not
shown, under the most lenient First Amendment standard that could conceivably
apply, that the Act's sweeping prohibition on protected expression &quot;restrict[s]
speech no more than is reasonably necessary to protect a substantial government
interest.&quot;  Brown v. Glines, 444 U.S. 348, 355 (1980).</P>
<P>2.  The Act creates a classification that disadvantages some service members
based upon their sexual orientation:  (1) gay men and lesbians may not express
their identity, whereas heterosexuals can speak freely of their sexual
orientation; (2) any and all same-sex sexual behavior triggers discharge for gay
men and lesbians, whereas much opposite-sex sexual behavior is wholly
unregulated by the military; and (3) sexual misconduct by gay men and lesbians
is punished more severely -- by discharge -- than the same type of misconduct by
a heterosexual, which triggers more lenient, case-by-case discretionary review. 
This classification violates plaintiffs' right to equal protection because it
cannot satisfy even rational basis review.  The government's acquiescence to the
perceived antipathy of the majority is constitutionally-illegitimate support for
this differential treatment, see Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S.
432, 448 (1985), and the government has not rationally tied this classification
to any legitimate state interest.</P>
<P>3.  The constitutionality of 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654 (b)(1) is properly before
this Court.  Plaintiffs have standing to challenge this restriction on &quot;homosexual
acts&quot; because they are presently and directly injured by its differential
punishment of same-sex sexual behavior and any other behavior that might reveal
a gay sexual orientation; they are also injured by the stigma of such ongoing
discriminatory treatment.  Moreover, were plaintiffs only to have standing to
challenge &#167; 654 (b)(2), the constitutionality of (b)(1) would still be
before the Court, because the government itself relies on the &quot;acts&quot;
restriction as the foundation for its purported need to punish statements.   4. 
Neither principles of exhaustion nor judicial deference bar the federal courts
from carefully examining the merits of plaintiffs' claims.  The district court
correctly understood its role in assessing whether Congress had complied with
constitutional imperatives.  </P>
<H4>ARGUMENT</H4>
<P><B>I. THE ACT AND DIRECTIVES PUNISH THE EXPRESSION OF A LESBIAN OR GAY
IDENTITY WITHOUT SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION, VIOLATING PLAINTIFFS' FIRST AMENDMENT
RIGHTS                   </B></P>
<P><B>A. The Elements Of A Cognizable First Amendment Claim Are Easily
Established Here.       </B>   </P>
<P>To present a free speech claim, a plaintiff must show that (1) state action
has burdened (2) speech or other expression protected by the First Amendment. 
See, e.g., Simon &amp; Schuster v. Crime Victims Board, 502 U.S. 105, 118 (1991)
(because statute burdened constitutionally-protected expression, onus shifted to
government to attempt to justify the infringement).  In this instance, both
elements -- constitutional protection and the government burden -- are readily
established.</P>
<P>A verbal or written &quot;state[ment] that [one] is a homosexual or
bisexual, or words to that effect,&quot; 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(b)(2), is
constitutionally-protected pure speech.  As the district court held, </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[s]peech is worthy of First Amendment protection not only when it
contributes to the &quot;marketplace of ideas&quot; or assists in the search for
&quot;truth,&quot; but also when it articulates &quot;the premise of individual
dignity and choice upon which our political system rests.&quot;  Cohen v.
California, 403 U.S. 15, 24 (1971).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>JA 173.  See also Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group
of Boston, 115 S. Ct. 2338, 2346 (1995) (identifying and celebrating &quot;members'
identity as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual descendants of the Irish
immigrants&quot; constitutes expression protected by the First Amendment).</P>
<P>This protected expression is severely burdened by the Act.  Any service
member's statement that he or she is gay or bisexual, to a family member, a
doctor, a superior, the newsmedia, or anyone else, in private or in public,
triggers the punitive apparatus of the Act.  10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(b)(2).(12) 
For example, plaintiffs' statements about their sexual orientation in this
litigation constitute fully-sufficient grounds for separation.  Id.  Moreover,
the Act's burden is not limited to those who speak or who communicate a gay
identity through expressive behavior, for it exerts a profound chilling effect
on others as well, erecting such a severe penalty that the pressure to remain
silent about anything which might reflect a gay or lesbian identity is
exceedingly strong.  This is exactly what the Department of Defense and Congress
sought:  to keep gay men and lesbians silent about their identity.  See supra at
___.  The Act's legislative history, and the government's efforts to justify the
Act by pointing to others' discomfort with gay service members who openly
express that characteristic, firmly establish that here the government has not
merely burdened expression &quot;incidental[ly],&quot; cf. United States v.
O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 375-77 (1968), but has intentionally aimed to chill, and
if that fails punish, speech.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the limitation on speech imposed by the Act is content- and
viewpoint-based -- the most constitutionally-suspect type of burden.  &quot;A
statute is presumptively inconsistent with the First Amendment if it imposes a .
. . burden on speakers because of the content of their speech.&quot;  Simon &amp;
Schuster at 115.  As the Supreme Court recently emphasized:</P>
<P>When the government targets not [just] subject matter but particular views
taken by speakers on a subject, the violation of the First Amendment is all the
more blatant.  See R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 391 (1992).  Viewpoint
discrimination is thus an egregious form of content discrimination.  The
government must abstain from regulating speech when the specific motivating
ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the
restriction.  See Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37,
46 (1983).</P>
<P>Rosenberger v. University of Virginia, 63 U.S.L.W. 4702, 4705 (June 29,
1995).(13)  The Act burdens protected expression, but only if the expression
comes from someone who is truthfully expressing a gay, lesbian, or bisexual
identity.  Heterosexuals identifying themselves as such, or even stating in jest
or mimicry &quot;I am gay,&quot; are not to be punished.  See supra at ___. 
Thus, the &quot;perspective of the speaker,&quot; Rosenberger, improperly lies
at the heart of this punitive provision.</P>
<P>The government argues that it punishes lesbian or gay service members who
express their sexual orientation because of the information their words evince,
and not because they have spoken.  The cases relied on by the government in
support of this argument reveal its inapplicability here.  In Pruitt v. Cheney,
963 F.2d 1160 (9th Cir. 1992), and Ben-Shalom v. Marsh, 881 F.2d 454 (7th Cir.
1989), the policy in issue proclaimed that homosexuality per se was &quot;incompatible
with military service,&quot; 32 C.F.R. &#167; 41, app. A, pt. 1(H) (1992), and
sought to bar from service all gay men and lesbians, whether they hid their
identity or not.  Thus, the service members' speech in those cases was used as
evidence of their prohibited sexual orientation.  Pruitt, 963 F.2d at 1163 (&quot;Pruitt
was discharged . . . for being a homosexual&quot;); Ben-Shalom v. Marsh, 881
F.2d at 462 (&quot;it is the identity that makes [Ben-Shalom] ineligible&quot;).
 </P>
<P>Under the new policy, however, sexual orientation itself &quot;is not a bar
to continued service,&quot; Directive 1332.14 Part (H)(1)(a) (JA 323), it is the
statement or revelation that is prohibited.  See supra __.  Thus, this is not a
case like Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 113 S. Ct. 2194, 2201 (1993), where speech was
used as one piece of evidence &quot;to establish the elements of a crime or to
prove motive or intent.&quot;  Nor is it a case like Wayte v. United States, 470
U.S. 568, 610-11, 614 (1985), where the government &quot;`did not overtly punish
protected speech,'&quot; but used the defendant's &quot;self-reporting&quot; of
a criminal violation as a basis for deciding to prosecute and for securing a
conviction for that violation.(14)  The government's reliance on such cases is
misplaced, for the Act and Directives intentionally and directly punish
expression of a lesbian or gay sexual orientation; the orientation itself is no
longer prohibited and acts are prohibited only because they are one means of
communicating a non-heterosexual orientation.</P>
<P>The burden on the free expression rights of lesbian and gay men is not
limited by the so-called &quot;rebuttable presumption&quot; provision.  Lesbians
and gay men are put to the burden of rebutting the presumption because they have
spoken and they can escape discharge only by showing their statements were
untrue -- that they are not lesbian or gay.  The government's suggestion that
some who are truly lesbian or gay can rebut the presumption and serve openly is
contradicted by the terms of the Act, the implementing directives, and the
legislative history.  See supra __.(15) </P>
<P><B>B. Because The Government Has Not Even Met The Minimum Standard Required
By Brown v. Glines, The Act And Directives Should Be Struck Down As
Unconstitutional.                        </B></P>
<P>In Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828 (1976), and Brown v. Glines, 444 U.S. 348
(1980), the Supreme Court developed a test for assessing whether certain
military infringements upon First Amendment rights are justified:  does the
military's infringement &quot;restrict speech no more than is reasonably
necessary to protect [a] substantial government interest[?]&quot;  Brown, 444
U.S. at 355.</P>
<P>This general standard for free expression claims in the military arose out
of cases in which &quot;there [was] no claim that the military authorities

discriminated in any way&quot; based upon speakers' &quot;supposed . . . views,&quot;
Greer, 424 U.S. at 838-39, and the challenged regulations were not specifically
aimed at &quot;the suppression of free expression,&quot; Brown, 444 U.S. at 354.
 This case, involving intentional, across-the-board content- and viewpoint-based
message suppression warrants much more searching review than those neutral,
non-censorial regulations demanded.  See Rosenberger v. University of Virginia,
63 U.S.L.W. at 4705 (&quot;[d]iscrimination against speech because of its
message is presumed to be unconstitutional&quot;); supra at __.  To sustain this
policy, the government should be required to show that it promotes a compelling
state interest and is the least restrictive way to further that interest.  See
Simon &amp; Schuster, 502 U.S. at 118; Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S.
115, 126 (1989).</P>
<P>But even under the Brown standard, the least stringent First Amendment test
that could conceivably apply here, the Act and Directives are unconstitutional. 
The interests proffered by the government for the Act's censorship are not
legitimate state interests nor have they been shown to be substantial. 
Moreover, the Act's prohibition on expression is far too sweeping to be &quot;no
more than is reasonably necessary,&quot; for any purported purpose, legitimate
or not.  Brown at 355.(16)</P>
<P><B>1. The Government's Worries About Unit Cohesion, Privacy and Sexual
Tension All Amount To Illegitimate Rationales For The Act, Because They Are
Based On The Hostile Reaction Of Others To &quot;Disagreeable&quot; Expression.</B></P>
<P>&quot;If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is
that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because
society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.&quot;  Texas v.
Johnson, 491 U.S. at 414.  Thus, any attempt to justify a limitation on
expression with a fear of discomfort among those who might hear is
constitutionally illegitimate.  See Simon &amp; Schuster, 502 U.S. at 118
(government cannot legitimately claim &quot;any state interest in suppressing
[expression] out of solicitude for the sensibilities&quot; of others); Healy v.
James, 408 U.S. 169, 187-88 (1972) (government &quot;may not restrict speech or
association simply because it finds the views expressed by any group to be
abhorrent&quot;).</P>
<P>This remains true even if the government fears not merely discomfort, but
antagonism and disruption.  &quot;[C]onstitutional rights may not be denied
simply because of hostility to their assertion or exercise.&quot;  Watson v.
Memphis, 373 U.S. 526, 535 (1963).  See also Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. at 409
(government cannot merely speculate that &quot;expression of a provocative idea
will incite a riot&quot; and censor speech on that basis); Cox v. Louisiana, 379
U.S. 536 (1965) (&quot;heckler's veto&quot; cannot defeat First Amendment
rights).</P>
<P>To rationalize its line between lesbian or gay sexual orientation when it is
secret versus acknowledged, see supra at __, the scheme challenged here relies
on &quot;morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion.&quot;  10 U.S.C. &#167;
654(a)(6) &amp; (15).  Morale, order and cohesion will assertedly diminish,
however, not because an openly lesbian soldier is not upbeat, prepared to follow
orders, and able to bond with her comrades, but because those comrades will be
unhappy if they know about her &quot;controversial&quot; sexual orientation.(17)
 There is not the slightest suggestion that such anticipated negative reactions
stem from any inability of gay soldiers to do their jobs or any greater
likelihood of misconduct by gay service personnel.  See supra at __.  As the
district court concluded, JA 190-91, in adopting this scheme, the military and
Congress were motivated simply by &quot;solicitude for the sensibilities&quot;
of those reached by gay service members' expression; in other words, their
motive was precisely that which the Constitution does not allow.  Simon &amp;
Schuster, supra; Texas v. Johnson, supra.</P>
<P>That illegitimate purpose is not rehabilitated by describing the discomfort
of heterosexuals as stemming from lesser &quot;perceived privacy&quot; or
greater &quot;sexual tension&quot; once the communication has occurred.  Gov't
Br. at 38-39.  As the district court pointed out, any privacy reduction and
tension escalation occur only in the minds (or subconsciouses) of other service
member:  &quot;After passage of the Act the showers, the latrines and the

barracks became no more private than they were before.&quot;  JA 190.  Indeed,

the Military Working Group's report on privacy conceded, &quot;Knowing [that
someone has revealed a gay identity] is everything. . . .  [N]ot knowing
preserves the heterosexual's perception of privacy.&quot;  Executive Summary of
Privacy in the Military at 2 (JA 1715).(18)  Subjective discomfort with other
people because they are different from oneself is, however, an impermissible
justification for government action.  See Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center,
473 U.S. at 448-49; Simon &amp; Schuster, supra.</P>
<P>Similarly, to say that potential disruption of the service by heterosexuals
who do not like lesbians and gay men stems from moral or religious precepts
(Gov't Br. at 50) is not to legitimize it.  See Kingsley v. Regents, 360 U.S.
684, 688 (1959) (rejecting argument that censorship justified where expression &quot;portrays
a relationship which is contrary to moral standards [and] the religious precepts
. . . of [the] citizenry&quot;).(19)  Neither patriotism nor opposition to
fascism has succeeded in legitimizing fear of disorder and censorship in
response to flag burning or strong rhetoric.  See Texas v. Johnson, supra;
Terminiello v. City of Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 14 (1948) (Jackson, J., dissenting).
 Even very real anguish felt by those with far more cause than the government
can conjure here -- such as the families of victims of violent crime -- has been
rejected as a constitutionally-impermissible justification for silencing
discomforting words.  Simon &amp; Schuster, 502 U.S. at 118.</P>
<P>In addition to the fact that protecting the sensibilities of others is not a
legitimate purpose, the record here cannot support the existence of a
substantial government need, as required by Brown.  The evidence that others'
reaction to openly gay service members would, in fact, hinder unit cohesion or
any other aspect of the work of the armed forces is equivocal at best; the
possibility that any hindrance would be significant is far more doubtful.  As
the district court found, the Military Working Group and congressional hearings
elicited much opinion that some disruption would result, but most such
conclusions were unsupported in any way; the others, only with stray anecdotes. 
JA 188-89.  By contrast, the objective study commissioned by the Department of
Defense concluded that &quot;although some disruptions might result from having
acknowledged homosexuals in the military,&quot; &quot;the experience of

analogous organizations . . . suggests that any increase is likely to be quite

small.&quot;  RAND Report at xxiv (JA 779); see also id. at 312 (JA 1112) (&quot;if
there is an effect, it is most likely to involve social cohesion rather than
task cohesion&quot;; &quot;task cohesion rather than social cohesion&quot;
influences performance).</P>
<P>Nor can the government show that, were some unrest to result, the Act's
restrictions on expression are &quot;reasonably necessary&quot; to counter any
disruption within the ranks, as required by Brown.  Military culture demands
rigid obedience to the chain-of-command; that culture increases the ability of
military leaders to obtain successful job performance despite what any
individual soldier may feel about his colleagues, including their sexual
orientation.  The RAND Report found that its research and &quot;the military's
own experiences with blacks</P>
<P>. . . suggest that a new policy [allowing gay individuals to serve openly]
could be successfully implemented&quot; without harm to the military mission. 
Id. at 392 (JA 1192).(20)  As the district court concluded: </P>
<P>Even if the First Amendment were to tolerate the prohibition of a truthful
self-identification by a homosexual because it offends the sensibilities of some
heterosexuals[,] it surely would require a legislative finding that the
consequences of disclosure would be infinitely more serious than anything
revealed in the record before Congress.  Even General Otjen conceded that the
Services would fulfill their mission if homosexuals were permitted to reveal
their orientation.  See Deposition of General Otjen, Ex. PX-19 at p. 139 </P>
<P>. . . .  See also Testimony of Gen. Calvin Waller, S. Hrg. 103-845, Ex. JX-1
at p. 401 (&quot;If the ultimate decision is to allow openly declared
homosexuals to serve in the Armed Forces, I am confident that the military

leadership, as well as the military personnel, will salute and make the best of
that situation.&quot;)</P>
<P>JA 196-97.</P>
<P>While the government may use &quot;reasonable predictions of harm . . . to
justify the punishment of isolated incidents of employee speech,&quot; Jeffries
v. Harleston, 52 F.3d 9, 13 (2d Cir. 1995) (emphasis supplied), it may not
impose an across-the-board ban on speech by whole categories of persons without
far greater justification.  National Treasury Employees Union, 63 U.S.L.W. 4133,
4137 (U.S. Feb. 22, 1995).  Like the federal statute struck down in National
Treasury &quot;[t]he sweep of [the Act's restrictions on speech] makes the
Government's burden heavy.&quot;  63 U.S.L.W. at 4137.  Because the Act
restricts a whole category of expression for a large group of federal employees,
whether the expression is connected in any way with their jobs or not, it has a
&quot;widespread impact&quot; on public servants' freedom of speech which &quot;gives
rise to far more serious concerns&quot; than an ordinary executive decision or
ordinary congressional enactment.  Id.  Thus, the government's reliance on
individual employee cases (Gov't Br. at 41-42) is misplaced.(21)</P>
<P><B>2. Neither The Asserted Need To Prevent &quot;Homosexual Acts,&quot; Nor
The Effectiveness of Preventing Such Acts By Punishing Expression, Has Ever Been
Shown.</B></P>
<P>The government also posits the prevention of &quot;homosexual acts&quot; as
justification for the Act.  See Gov't Br. at 33-36.  This purported basis fails
for three distinct reasons.  First, as shown above, the congressional record
shows that this was not the purpose of the policy at all; the terms of the
policy and its legislative history show that the military has no purpose
unrelated to communication for regulating acts by lesbians and gay men
differently from the acts of heterosexuals.  The true purpose and effect of the
Act is not to address acts but expression.  See supra at __.  Indeed, the
government now candidly concedes that its rationale for distinctly regulating &quot;acts&quot;
when engaged in by lesbians and gay men is the possibility that others will
learn of them and threaten to disrupt the military mission.  See Gov't Br. at
36-37; see also S. Hrg. 103-845 at 299 (JX-1) (Dr. Darryl Henderson testifying
that &quot;homosexual acts&quot; will have no effect on unit cohesion if they
are kept secret); H. Hrg. 103-19 at 50 (JX-3) (Secretary Aspin testifying that &quot;even
though you are not doing anything other than making it [lesbian or gay identity]
public, that does affect unit cohesion.&quot;)</P>
<P>Second, the censorial purpose and reactions of others aside, neither
Congress nor the military has produced any evidence, or even any explanation, as
to how sexual acts of whatever sort could have a more negative impact on
military performance when engaged in by lesbians and gay men than when engaged
in by heterosexuals.  The sole thread on which the &quot;homosexual acts&quot;
justification appears to hang is the congressional &quot;finding&quot; that &quot;[t]he
prohibition against homosexual conduct is a long-standing element of military
law that continues to be necessary in the unique circumstances of military
service.&quot;  10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(a)(13).  Yet a declaration that something
has been done for a long time and a conclusory statement that it is still
necessary can hardly amount to proof of a substantial government need. 
Tellingly, the government admits that gay and lesbian soldiers are no more
likely than heterosexuals to participate in sexual misconduct, see JA 178; S.
Rep. No. 103-112 at 279 (JA 702).(22)  Third, were Congress somehow to have
shown, based on legitimate considerations, that sexual acts engaged in by
lesbians and gay men are more detrimental, there is no evidence that singling
out openly gay and lesbian members for punishment is a &quot;reasonably
necessary&quot; means of preventing any such &quot;harm.&quot;</P>
<P>In sum, the Act and Directives punish any expression of a lesbian or gay
identity in order to prevent the possibility that heterosexual service members
will feel discomfort and cause disruption.  But the First Amendment does not
tolerate the silencing of some based on the antipathies of others.  In addition
to the illegitimacy of the government's purpose here, the district court
correctly found the record's support of any practical need to be insubstantial
and that, in any event, the Act was not &quot;reasonably necessary&quot; even
crediting the government's concerns.</P>

<P><B>II. THE ACT AND DIRECTIVES ARE NOT RATIONALLY RELATED TO ANY PERMISSIBLE

STATE PURPOSE, VIOLATING PLAINTIFFS' RIGHTS TO EQUAL PROTECTION</B></P>
<P>Plaintiffs will be discharged if their sexual orientation becomes known
through any statements or behavior, 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(b)(2), while
heterosexual service members who let others know of their sexual orientation are
not subject to the Act or any other regulation at all.  Plaintiffs will be
discharged if they engage in any sexual activity with a person of the same
gender.  10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(b)(1).  Heterosexuals who engage in the same
sexual acts, on the other hand, are not subject to the Act and its mandatory
discharge provision; their acts are either allowed, or, if they constitute
assault, sexual harassment, oral or anal sex, or some other form of sexual
misconduct, they are given the benefit of a case-by-case discretionary review
which takes into account their entire service record, the military resources
already invested in their training, and their future leadership potential.  See
DoD Directive 1332.14 at Part (2)(A)(2) (1994) (JA 332-33); supra at __.  Thus,
the scheme challenged here creates a classification that discriminates on the
basis of sexual orientation.</P>
<P>Even though classifications along the the lines of sexual orientation
warrant heightened scrutiny,(23) and the differential treatment of protected
First Amendment expression likewise triggers heightened review, the level of
scrutiny is not dispositive here.  The lowest level of equal protection scrutiny
requires &quot;a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and
some legitimate governmental purpose.&quot;  Heller v. Doe, 113 S. Ct. 2637,
2642 (1993).  This test embodies two elements, each of which must be satisfied: 
&quot;(1) Does the challenged legislation have a legitimate purpose?, and (2)
Was it reasonable for the lawmakers to believe that use of the challenged
classification would promote that purpose?&quot;  Western and Southern Life Ins.
Co. v. State Board of Equalization, 451 U.S. 648, 668 (1981).</P>
<P>The specific application of the rational basis standard depends upon whether
there is evidence of an illegitimate state purpose.  The Constitution flatly
prohibits government action that endorses or capitulates to fear about or
antipathy toward any group.  See Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S.
432, 448 (1985) (&quot;mere negative attitudes, or fear, . . . are not
permissible bases&quot; for government action); Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429,
433-34 (1984) (&quot;[p]rivate biases may be outside the reach of the law, but
the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect&quot;; &quot;[t]he
effects of . . . prejudice, however real,&quot; cannot &quot;support a denial of
constitutional rights&quot;); U.S. Dep't of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528,
534 (1973) (&quot;a bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular
group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest.&quot;)  Thus, it is
not legitimate for the government to discriminate against lesbian and gay
service members simply because other service members do not like them, and may
react badly to being around them.  See Pruitt v. Cheney, 963 F.2d 1160 (9th Cir.
1991) (reversing dismissal of plaintiff's equal protection challenge to the
1981-1993 military policy on homosexuality and remanding for a determination of
whether the justifications for the policy were unconstitutionally based on
prejudice.)  As the district court concluded, &quot;heterosexual animosity
towards homosexuals is by its terms based on irrational prejudices.&quot;  JA
190.</P>
<P>If the record shows that a classification was adopted to foster an
impermissible purpose, or if the government advances such a purpose in defending
the classification, the impermissible purpose must be cast aside as failing the
first prong of the rational basis test and the reviewing court must also be more
skeptical in its second prong analysis of any legitimate goals the government
proffers.  It is, after all, only &quot;absent some reason to infer antipathy&quot;
that the &quot;Constitution presumes that . . . even improvident decisions will
eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that judicial intervention
is generally unwarranted.&quot;  Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 97 (1979)
(emphasis supplied); see also FCC v. Beach Communications, 113 S. Ct. 2096, 2101
(1993) (same).  This skepticism leads courts to refrain from making up new
possible purposes for the classification which the state has not advanced,
Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 448; to reject neutrally-worded rationales that turn out
to be nothing more than pale descriptions of government capitulation to
prejudice or other improper interests, id. at 449; and to insist firmly that
proffered rationales be more than hypothetical, that they have some &quot;footing
in the realities of the subject addressed.&quot;  Heller, 113 S.Ct. at 2643; see
also Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 448.(24)</P>
<P>The government's justifications for the Act's targeting and differential
treatment of openly lesbian and gay service members are threefold:  (1) that it
prevents the commission of &quot;homosexual acts&quot;; (2) that it prevents
deterioration in &quot;unit cohesion&quot; and &quot;morale&quot;; and (3) that
it enhances &quot;privacy&quot; and reduces &quot;sexual tension.&quot;  Because
none of these purported justifications provides a legitimate and rational basis
for the Act's discrimination, the Act violates equal protection.</P>
<P>As shown above, preventing sexual acts is not the purpose of the Act and
Directives and, in any event, the government offers no explanation for treating
the same sexual acts differently when engaged in by lesbians and gay men as
opposed to heterosexuals.  The government's central argument regarding the
prevention of everything it calls &quot;homosexual acts&quot; -- that it may
validly prohibit sexual misconduct in the military -- does not respond to
plaintiffs' equal protection challenge.  The issue here is not whether the
government can prohibit oral or anal sex, sexual assault, fraternization, or any
other type of sexual misconduct,(25) but whether it can have two different sets
of prohibitions that have drastically different consequences which depend on the
sexual orientation of the individual involved.  Similarly, as to private,
consensual sex that is not prohibited by the UCMJ, the question here is whether
the government can decide to prohibit private sex for some and not others, and
have the applicability of the prohibition turn on sexual orientation.  The short
of it is that the &quot;homosexual acts&quot; rationale is not a rationale at
all, because the government never answers the only question posed:  what is the
explanation for the decision to treat lesbians and gay men differently, and far
more harshly, when they engage in the same acts as heterosexuals?</P>
<P>The government's other justifications for unequally punishing gay service
members are similarly unavailing.   Faithful to the line of reasoning adopted by
Congress, the government argues that the ban on openly gay service members
promotes &quot;unit cohesion&quot; because the presence of those known to be gay
could upset heterosexual service members who do not like lesbians and gay men
enough that those heterosexuals could impair the functioning of military units. 
See S. Rep. No. 103-112 at 279-80 (JA 702-703); supra at __.  As the district
court concluded, the unit cohesion rationale treats &quot;a statement of
homosexual status . . . in itself [as] an evil because heterosexuals would not
like to hear it and would react so as to damage unit cohesion.&quot;  JA 188. 
Thus, the proffered goal of promoting &quot;unit cohesion&quot; turns out to be
nothing more than catering to the hostility of others.  Likewise, the concern
about &quot;good order and discipline&quot; proves to be a neutral-sounding way
of saying that the government fears heterosexual service members will so dislike
openly gay members that they will not work with them.  Similarly, beneath
concerns about &quot;privacy&quot; and &quot;sexual tension&quot; are nothing
more than the government's belief that heterosexuals might be upset if they have
to share accommodations with openly gay men or lesbians.   The government also
cannot explain how any possibility of distraction caused by sexual attraction is
rationally addressed by the Act's differential treatment.  No attempt is made to
limit &quot;sexual tension&quot; generated by heterosexuals -- there are no
regulations at all against romantic and even sexual relationships between
heterosexuals of the same rank who serve together.(26)  But in the name of
preventing sexual tension, all openly lesbian or gay service members are
discharged without regard to whether they have done anything to generate &quot;sexual
tension.&quot; </P>
<P>As under the First Amendment, describing anti-gay animosity as based on
religious, moral or ethical views likewise does not transform government
accommodation of it into a legitimate state purpose for equal protection
analysis.  See Marks v. City of Chesapeake, 883 F.2d 308, 313 (4th Cir. 1989)
(finding government action ratifying citizens' religious and moral objections to
fortune teller illegitimate).  Indeed, experience teaches that prejudice
frequently is defended with religious and moral justifications.  See e.g.,
Moreno, 413 U.S. at 535 n.7 (ban on food stamps to &quot;hippie&quot; households
originally defended on moral grounds); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 3 (1967)
(racial segregation said to be ordained by the Almighty).</P>
<P>Nor can forecasting dire consequences if the prejudices of others are
ignored legitimate capitulation to bias.  See Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 449 (purpose
was to protect mentally disabled from potential violence at the hands of
neighborhood children); Palmore, 466 U.S. at 431 (purpose was to protect
children from harmful psychological effects of attitudes of those who disapprove
of parents' relationship).  Constitutional rights do not disappear when those
who seek to deny them become ugly and threaten lawlessness; if they did, the
promise of &quot;equal protection&quot; would be hollow indeed.  See Cooper v.
Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 17 (1958).  As the district court found:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Even if defendants do believe that heterosexual servicemembers will be so
upset by a coworker's mere statement of homosexuality as not to work
cooperatively in the unit, such a belief does not justify a discriminatory
policy.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>JA 199.  Equal protection of the law, at the rational basis level, makes few
demands on government.  If it ceases to make the demand that antipathy play no
role in law, we will have admitted that equality before the law is no longer
even a cherished ideal.</P>

barrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit. . . . [and therefore
plaintiffs] need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but for the
barrier in order to establish standing.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Associated General Contractors, 113 S. Ct. at 2303.  See also Williams v.
Lambert, 46 F.3d 1275, 1279 (2d Cir. 1995).</P>
<P>Thus, a plaintiff challenging governmental action directed at a particular
group of persons meets constitutional standing requirements if &quot;(1) there
exists a reasonable likelihood that the plaintiff is in the disadvantaged group,
(2) there exists a government-erected barrier, and (3) the barrier causes
members of one group to be treated differently from members of the other group.&quot;
 Comer v. Cisneros, 37 F.3d 775, 793 (2d Cir. 1994). In this case, plaintiffs
are in the group disadvantaged by the policy; the &quot;acts&quot; provision of
the policy is part of an Act of Congress, enforced by Department of Defense
regulations; and the policy punishes plaintiffs and not heterosexuals.</P>
<P>Plaintiffs also have standing under the First Amendment to challenge the
policy's &quot;acts&quot; provision because it chills expressions of their
sexual orientation.  To avoid the risk of punishment, plaintiffs must avoid any
&quot;bodily contact,&quot; such as hugging or hand-holding, which might
identify them as gay or lesbian.  See supra at 12-13.(27)  Thus, so long as the
Act remains in effect, plaintiffs are suffering continuous injury to their First
Amendment freedoms.  See Adult Video Ass'n v. Barr, 960 F.2d 781, 785 (9th Cir.
1992) (&quot;[w]ith respect to the argument of an unconstitutional chill, Adult
Video has alleged an actual injury&quot; sufficient to establish standing; &quot;`[t]o
the extent the provisions require [the plaintiff] . . . to exercise
self-censorship, [the plaintiff is] required to exercise self-censorship today'&quot;),
reversed and remanded, Reno v. Adult Video Ass'n, 113 S. Ct. 3028 (1993), on
remand, 41 F.3d 503 (9th Cir. 1994) (reinstating standing opinion).(28)</P>
<P>To challenge the &quot;acts&quot; provision, plaintiffs are not required to
allege that they have identified specific third parties who will participate
with them in any of the acts.  For its contrary conclusion, the district court
relied on FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990), a case involving a law
which prohibited issuing a license to anyone who resided with an individual who
had been denied a license.  Plaintiffs in that case apparently were unable to
offer anything to show any likelihood that they would ever actually be denied a
license under the &quot;residing with&quot; provision of the challenged law. 
But the plaintiffs here have alleged that they wish to participate without fear
of punishment in acts forbidden by the policy, and those acts include virtually
any form of even arguably sexual conduct, including handholding and hugging. 
Given the breadth of the Act and plaintiffs' expressed wishes, it can hardly be
said that the possibility of finding another to participate is so doubtful that
the Act's prohibition is not the cause of an injury.  See Eisenstadt v. Baird,
405 U.S. 438 (1972) (finding standing to challenge a statute limiting the sale
of contraceptives to married persons without allegations as to existence of
third parties to enage in sexual acts); Regents of the University of California
v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 280 n.14, 98 S. Ct. 2733, 2743 n.14 (1978) (finding
standing to challenge medical school's race-based admissions policy without
allegations as to whether school would admit plaintiff).  Moreover, the Act
forbids any &quot;attempt&quot; to engage in any &quot;homosexual acts.&quot; 
10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(b)(1).  So by its very terms, plaintiffs need not have a
willing partner to violate the Act.</P>
<P>Considering plaintiffs' entire challenge to the Act works no prejudice on
the government because the government made it clear prior to the Court's ruling
on standing and throughout this litigation that its defense of the statute
relied solely on the legislative record and the three administrative board
hearings regarding the rebuttable presumption.  See, e.g., Letter from Margaret
Plank to Judge Nickerson dated February 12, 1995 (E.D.N.Y. Docket No. 103);
Gov't Br. at 41 n.23 (&quot;discovery and trial were irrelevant&quot; to
plaintiffs' claims).  Similarly, plaintiffs' evidentiary submissions would not
have changed if their entire challenge had been considered by the district
court.  In these circumstances, plaintiff's interest in and need for a full and
fair determination of the constitutional claims raised and pursued from the
start of this litigation is compelling.(29)</P>
<P>Because the record is complete and, as this Court has noted, &quot;the
important questions raised in this case should not be left unanswered by the
courts any longer than necessary,&quot; (JA 92), this Court should rule on the
merits of plaintiffs' challenge to the &quot;acts&quot; provision, &quot;[r]ather
than remand the case which would entail further delay,&quot; Brown &amp;
Williamson Tobacco Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 710 F.2d 1165, 1172 (6th Cir.
1983).  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2106 (appellate courts may consider claims &quot;as
may be just under the circumstances&quot;); McComb v. Utica Knitting Co., 164
F.2d 670, 674 (2d Cir. 1947) (determining issue rather than remanding even
though district court made no findings).</P>
<P><B>2. The Constitutionality Of 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(b)(1) Is Before This

Court, Because The Government's Asserted Justification For Its Limitation Of
Plaintiffs' Expression Rests On Its Purported Need And Ability To Punish &quot;Homosexual
Acts&quot; Under Section (b)(1)</B></P>
<P>The government's primary defense of the &quot;statements&quot; portion of
the Act asserts that the provision is necessary as an indicator that a member
might violate the separate prohibitions on &quot;acts.&quot;  Gov't Br. at 33-36
(&quot;use of a member's statement of homosexuality under the challenged policy
is justified by the need to prevent acts.&quot;)(30)  But if the &quot;acts&quot;
portion of the Act is not constitutional, the government's attempt to justify
the statements portion as a method of implementing it must fail as well.  See,
e.g., Commonwealth v. Wasson, 842 S.W.2d 487 (Ky. 1993) (court ruling on
challenge to solicitation charge necessarily reviewed constitutionality of
underlying offense); People v. Uplinger, 58 N.Y.2d 936, 460 N.Y.S.2d 514, 515,
447 N.E.2d 62 (1983) (same).  Thus, the constitutionality of the &quot;acts&quot;
provision is squarely before this Court regardless of plaintiffs' standing to
challenge it directly, by virtue of the government's defense of the &quot;statements&quot;
provision. </P>
<P><B>B. Both The District Court And This Court Have Correctly Rejected The
Government's Argument That Plaintiffs Cannot Bring Their Constitutional Claims
In Federal Court Without Undergoing A Futile Administrative Proceeding That
Could Not Provide Them With The Relief They Seek</B></P>
<P>The government has already argued to this Court, on its appeal of the
preliminary injunction orders, that exhaustion of administrative remedies is
required here.  This Court implicitly rejected that argument, addressing the
merits of the preliminary injunction orders and remanding the case for trial. 
JA 83-92.  That implicit rejection is now the law of the case.  See, e.g.,
Thomas v. Bible, 983 F.2d 152, 154-55 (9th Cir. 1993); In re PCH Assoc., 949
F.2d 585, 592 (2d Cir. 1991).</P>
<P>In any event, the government's exhaustion argument is without merit. 
Exceptions to the general exhaustion requirement that have been recognized and
applied by this Court in the context of the military include situations where:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(1) available remedies provide no &quot;genuine opportunity for adequate
relief&quot;; (2) irreparable injury may occur without immediate judicial
relief; (3) administrative appeal would be &quot;futile&quot;; and (4) in
certain instances a plaintiff has raised a &quot;substantial constitutional
question.&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Guitard v. United States Sec'y of the Navy, 967 F.2d 737, 741 (2d Cir. 1992)
(citing Von Hoffburg v. Alexander, 615 F.2d 633, 638 (5th Cir. 1980)).  Each of
these exceptions applies here.  </P>
<P>&quot;Administrative remedies that are inadequate need not be exhausted.&quot;
 Coit Independence Joint Venture v. Federal Savings and Loan, 489 U.S. 561, 587
(1989).  See also Riley v. Ambach, 668 F.2d 635, 641 (2d Cir. 1981) (&quot;`[E]xhaustion
is not required if the only available administrative remedy is plainly
inadequate'&quot;) (quoting Patton v. Dumpson, 498 F. Supp. 933, 940 (S.D.N.Y.
1980)).  In this action, plaintiffs seek to have the Act and Directives declared
facially unconstitutional and enjoined in all their applications.  The
administrative review boards and boards of military corrections simply do not
have the power or competence to do that.  See Steffan v. Cheney, 733 F. Supp.
115, 119-120 (D.D.C. 1989) (not requiring exhaustion because administrative body
&quot;not empowered to change the Naval regulations excluding homosexuals&quot;).
 Even if plaintiffs were able to rebut the presumption in an isolated discharge
proceeding -- which their acknowledged sexual orientation precludes them from
doing under the terms of the Act and Directives, see supra at __, -- the relief
would be inadequate.  Plaintiffs would still have to continue to live under the
restrictions of the separate &quot;policy concerning homosexuality&quot; which
severely restricts their speech and behavior while freely permitting the same
for heterosexuals.</P>
<P>Exhaustion is also not required here because the irreparable injuries
imposed by the Act would accrue to plaintiffs during, and would be compounded
by, the administrative discharge processes.  See Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347,
373 (1976) (&quot;The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods
of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury&quot;); Paulsen v. County

of Nassau, 925 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir. 1991) (same); see also Coit Independence,
489 U.S. at 587 (exhaustion not required where harms accrue throughout the
challenged process).(31)</P>
<P>In addition, the futility of requiring these plaintiffs, who have
acknowledged their sexual orientation, to go through the administrative process
supports the district court's decision to hear their claims.  Likewise, the
incontrovertibly &quot;substantial&quot; nature of plaintiffs' constitutional
claims waives any necessity of exhaustion here.  See Guitard, 967 F.2d at 741;
see also Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 489-91 (1965) (judicial restraint
unjustified with respect to substantial First Amendment claims).  In sum, the
circumstances of this case bring it squarely within all of the exceptions to the
general exhaustion requirement, any one of which would justify excusing
exhaustion.  </P>
<P><B>C. The District Court, Cognizant Of Principles Of Judicial Deference,
Properly Performed Its Duty To Review the Constitutionality Of The Act; This
Court Must Likewise Undertake Meaningful Constitutional Review And, In So Doing,
Will Find That The Legislation Exceeds The Bounds Of The First And Fifth
Amendments.</B></P>
<P>The district court correctly recognized that &quot;judgments of Congress and
the military&quot; on military matters are entitled to judicial deference.  JA
174.  However, the lower court also appropriately emphasized that &quot;that
does not mean . . . courts are not competent or should abdicate their
responsibility to review the constitutionality&quot; of military-related
decisions.  Id.  Judge Nickerson specifically abjured any determination as to
the &quot;wisdom&quot; of the Act, id. (JA 175), instead focusing on whether the
record before Congress and the defendants' explanation of that record provided a
legitimate and sufficient basis for the legislation's restrictions.</P>
<P>Contrary to the impression left by the government's brief, &quot;deference&quot;
cannot possibly mean that a federal court ruling on a constitutional challenge
is barred from looking behind the factual assertions in congressional &quot;findings,&quot;
see 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(a), and making an assessment, under the governing
constitutional standard, of those findings' support and legitimacy.  See FCC v.
League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364, 387 n.18 (1984) (&quot;`[w]ere it
otherwise, the scope of freedom of speech . . . would be subject to legislative
definition and the function of the First Amendment as a check on legislative
power would be nullified'&quot;); Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 129
(1989) (&quot;whatever deference is due legislative findings [does] not
foreclose our independent judgment of the facts bearing on an issue of
constitutional law&quot;).  Additionally, because Congress made no &quot;findings&quot;
at all with respect to the necessity of burdening speech as the means to further
any purportedly legitimate interest, there was nothing to which the court could
or should defer on that point.  The government not only exaggerate deference,
but also ignores that it bears the burden to satisfy the exacting level of
scrutiny that applies, in particular, to plaintiffs' First Amendment claim.  See
supra at [1st A section].</P>
<P>The military context and purported national security concerns do not save
the Act from careful judicial scrutiny, for  Congress is not free to &quot;disregard
the Constitution when it acts in the area of military affairs.&quot;  Rostker v.
Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 67 (1981); see also United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258,
263-64 (1967) (striking down statute barring any member of a Communist
organization from employment in defense facility; emphasizing that &quot;military
capability&quot; or &quot;`war power' cannot be invoked as a talismanic
incantation to support any exercise of congressional power which can be brought
within its ambit&quot;); Anderson v. Laird, 466 F.2d 283, 294 (D.C. Cir.), cert.
denied, 409 U.S. 1076 (1972).  Indeed, when a &quot;national security&quot;
interest is claimed, government action often creates &quot;greater jeopardy to
constitutionally protected speech.&quot;  United States v. United States Dist.
Ct., 407 U.S. 297, 313 (1972).</P>
<P>The district court made emphatically clear that its only &quot;task [was] to
determine the constitutionality of the policy adopted by Congress&quot; and that
it made that determination by examining the &quot;record before Congress,&quot;
as reflected in the legislative history and illuminated in this litigation.  JA
195-96.  That appropriate constitutional review is all that plaintiffs request. 
&quot;Men and women of the Armed Forces do not leave constitutional safeguards
and judicial protection behind when they enter military service.&quot;  Weiss v.
United States, 114 S. Ct. 752, 769 (1994) (Ginsburg, J., concurring).</P>
<H4>CONCLUSION</H4>
<P>For all of the foregoing reasons, this Court should declare 10 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;
654(b)(1) &amp; (2) and their implementing directives unconstitutional.</P>

<P>Dated: September 27, 1995</P>
<HR>
<H4>Notes</H4>
<P>1.  Cases challenging parts of the Act are now before the United States
Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth Circuits.  Thomasson v. Perry, 1995
WL 470185 (E.D. Va. June 8, 1995), rehearing in banc ordered sua sponte (4th

Cir. Sept. 20, 1995); Philips v. Perry, 883 F. Supp. 539 (W.D. Wash. 1995),
appeal pending (9th Cir.).</P>
<P>2.  The government's use of the term &quot;homosexual acts&quot; obscures
the fact that there are no uniquely &quot;homosexual&quot; acts; there are acts
(associational, sexual, casual, or otherwise) that might be labeled &quot;homosexual&quot;
when engaged in by gay or lesbian individuals, but they are the very same acts
that heterosexuals do.  Indeed, no other military law, apart from the policy
challenged in this case, differentiates between acts engaged in by persons of
the same sex and acts engaged in by persons of different sexes.  See infra at
__.</P>
<P>3.  The Military Working Group, consisting of representatives from each
branch of the military, was formed to provide one of the two reports requested
by Secretary of Defense Aspin during the 1993 debates about gay men and lesbians
in the service.  The second report was commissioned from the National Defense
Research Institute of the RAND Corporation (&quot;RAND&quot;) &quot;to provide
an objective source of information on the issue.&quot;  Letter of Secretary
Aspin to Senator Nunn (May 4, 1993) (JA 1681).  After extensive analysis, RAND
concluded that any special policy with regard to gay and lesbian service members
was unnecessary, that sexual orientation should be treated as &quot;not germane&quot;
to any aspect of military personnel policy, and that all service members should
be subject to exactly the same, sexual orientation-neutral standards of
professional conduct.  See RAND, Sexual Orientation and U.S. Military Personnel
Policy:  Options and Assessment (&quot;RAND Report&quot;) at xvii-xxviii
(Executive Summary) (JA 788-99) &amp; Appendix A (Illustrative Standard of
Professional Conduct) (JA 1208-1209).</P>
<P>4.  See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 103-112 at 278 (JA 701) (quoting General Powell
on concern about &quot;the presence of open homosexuality&quot;); id. at 280 (JA
703) (quoting General H. Norman Schwarzkopf's opinion that &quot;the
introduction of an open homosexual into a small unit immediately polarizes that
unit&quot;); S. Hrg. No. 103-845 at 163 (JX-1, Vol.1) (Senator Lott stating that
issue before Congress is whether or not to &quot;allow[] homosexuals and
lesbians to openly serve&quot;); id. at 433 (JX-1, Vol.2) (Lieutenant General
Calvin Waller testifying that &quot;if the individual proves to be a liar, a
thief, [or] in my opinion also, openly homosexual, then you are not going to
have the same kind of trust, confidence and faith in that particular small
section&quot;); id. at 550 (JX-1, Vol.2) (Senator Cohen stressing &quot;[b]ut
you have gays in the military right now.  The question is one of openness.&quot;);
id. at 780 (JA 269) (testimony of General John P. Otjen, chair of Military
Working Group, that disruption is caused &quot;when somebody identifies
themselves as a homosexual&quot;). </P>
<P>5.  The district court's opinion catalogued this abandonment of prior
rationales:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The legislative record shows that the Act and the Directives are not
premised on these beliefs.  Defendants do not contend that the new policy was
enacted in response to a finding that gay men and lesbians have physical or
psychological defects rendering them unfit to serve, pose security risks, or are
more likely than heterosexuals to violate a code of conduct or other rules
generally.  See Defendants' Responses to Plaintiffs' Requests for Admission, Ex.
PX-13 at pp. 5-8.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>JA 176-77.</P>
<P>6.  In particular, the UCMJ makes no distinction between oral or anal sex
(both of which are sometimes called &quot;sodomy&quot;) involving partners of
the same sex versus partners of different sexes -- its terms prohibit oral or
anal sex for any couple.  10 U.S.C. &#167; 925.</P>
<P>7.  The second half of this definition of &quot;homosexual act&quot;
constitutes one of the significant drafting changes from the prior DoD policy. 
The expansion of &quot;homosexual act&quot; to include any non-sexual bodily
contact understood by an observer to signal homosexuality illuminates the Act's
focus on communication of a sexual orientation other than heterosexual.</P>
<P>The enormous range of sexual and non-sexual behaviors encompassed by this
definition of &quot;homosexual acts&quot; includes same-sex hand-holding,
dancing, hugging, kissing, and any affectionate contact, if interpreted to carry
with it some meaning about gay sexual orientation.  10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(f)(3). 
The definition also covers the gamut of sexual behavior, from same-sex
hand-to-genital contact to and including same-sex oral or anal sex, which is
already forbidden for all couples, same- or opposite-sex, by UCMJ article 125. 
10 U.S.C. &#167; 925.</P>
<P>8.  The Directives repeat the same three bases for discharge, adding to the
confusion by subsuming all three -- &quot;homosexual acts,&quot; statements
indicating a gay orientation, and marriage or attempted marriage -- under the
label &quot;homosexual conduct.&quot;  See DoD Directive 1332.14 (1994) (JA
304).</P>
<P>9.  See also S. Hrg. No. 103-845 at 747 (JX-1, Vol.3) (Senator Aspin
explaining that &quot;[t]he presumption is, if they say it, they are gay&quot;);
id. (Secretary Aspin answering &quot;Yes, sir&quot; to Senator Bryan's query &quot;[T]hey
would then have the burden to disprove that, in effect?&quot;).</P>
<P>10.  The government never asserts that a lesbian or gay service member could
disprove such a &quot;propensity&quot; or &quot;likelihood&quot; by making
claims about past conduct or promises about future conduct; moreover, any such
assertion would contradict the governing terms of the statute as well as its
legislative history.  Nor does the government ever articulate any other
purported means by which a lesbian or gay man could &quot;rebut&quot; a &quot;propensity&quot;
or &quot;likelihood.&quot;</P>
<P>11.  See also S. Hrg. No. 103-845 at 783 (JA 270):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Senator GLENN. . . . [W]hat if you had a case now, let us say you have a
member of the military who is married and has some kids, and had never indicated
or never said he was gay or anything, but he confides to somebody, hey, I was
over in the Gulf and I was away from my family and there was this guy, and we
had a relationship, and it was homosexual, and he tells somebody this.  But that
was over there, and I am back home now and back with the family, and that is
that</P>
<P>. . . .  Now that was a homosexual act he is talking about.  Would that
bounce him out?</P>
<P>Ms. GORELICK.  That could.  And it could also fall within this provision . .
. where the separation authority could find . . . that that conduct was a
departure from the member's usual behavior and is unlikely to reoccur, and a
number of other factors.  The separation authority could find that, and could
further find that the continued presence of that person is consistent with
proper discipline and good order.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>12.  The &quot;statements&quot; provision of the Act, as interpreted by the
Directives, also covers expressive behavior beyond a verbal or written
statement.  The prohibited &quot;statement&quot; is defined as &quot;[l]anguage
or behavior that a reasonable person would believe was intended to convey the
statement that [the] person engages in, attempts to engage in, or has a
propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts&quot; -- i.e., according to
the contorted semantics of this regulatory scheme, see 10 U.S.C. &#167;
654(f)(1) (definition of &quot;homosexual&quot; &quot;gay&quot; and lesbian&quot;),
language or behavior that amounts to a statement that one is gay or lesbian. 
DoD Directive 1332.30 at 1-2 (JA 364) (emphasis supplied).  In addition, as
explained above, the Act defines &quot;homosexual acts&quot; to include any &quot;bodily
contact&quot; that &quot;a reasonable person would understand to demonstrate&quot;
that a service member is gay or lesbian.  10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(f)(3)(B).</P>
<P>Because these provisions covering expressive behavior are specifically
defined in terms of the behavior's communication of a message and the behavior
is being proscribed &quot;because it has expressive elements,&quot; all of that
regulated behavior is likewise fully protected by the First Amendment.  Texas v.
Johnson, 491 U.S. at 406 (emphasis in original).</P>
<P>13.  The government's argument that a claim of &quot;military disruption&quot;
extinguishes general principles of First Amendment review is unfounded.  In
Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401 (1989), relied on by the government, the
court upheld prison regulations allowing wardens to restrict incoming
publications because the regulations were intended to address legitimate prison
security concerns and the purpose was &quot;unrelated to the suppression of
expression.&quot;  490 U.S. at 415-16.  The government also argues that the
court in Ethredge v. Hail, 56 F.3d 1324. 1327 (11th Cir. 1995), did not review
the administrative order at issue under First Amendment standards because the
military claimed that the order was needed to prevent disruption.  In fact, the
order -- which prohibited on-base display of certain types of bumper stickers --
passed constitutional muster because the court found it to be viewpoint neutral,
not because the government invoked the spectre of &quot;military disruption.&quot;
</P>
<P>14.  Even in Wayte, where the speech was used as evidence and not punished
in and of itself, the Court required the government to meet the First Amendment
standard for incidental limitations on expression; showing that expression was
used as evidence did not foreclose First Amendment review.  470 U.S. at 611.</P>
<P>Also inapposite is Jews for Jesus,Inc. v. Jewish Community Relations Council
of New York, Inc., 968 F.2d 286, 295 (2d Cir. 1992), cited by the government, in
which the application of laws prohibiting discrimination in public
accommodations on the basis of religion was upheld because the laws were &quot;plainly
aimed at conduct . . . not speech.&quot;</P>
<P>15.  The district court correctly concluded that the three examples of
service members purportedly rebutting the presumption cited by the government
suggest not that the statute allows homosexuals to rebut the presumption, but
rather that the law either did not apply to those members or was not applied
according to its terms.  JA 184-85.  See also S. Hrg. 103-845 at 194 (JX-3) (DoD
General Counsel Gorelick testifying that successful &quot;rebuttal&quot; cases
involved service members who brought in sexual partners and roommates to testify
that members were, in fact, heterosexual).</P>
<P>Moreover, the injury of discharge -- solely for expression -- that those
speak will suffer, and the chilling effect to which many others will succumb,
remain just as serious First Amendment infringements regardless of whether some
lucky, completely arbitrary few are saved from separation by an improper
application of the &quot;rebuttable presumption.&quot;</P>
<P>16.  None of the cases invoked by the government have upheld a provision
suppressing speech as broadly as the Act does.  The regulation at issue in Brown
v. Glines, for example, applied only to the circulation of petitions on-base and
did not regulate the content or viewpoint of the petitions.  444 U.S. at 349. 
The limitations on political campaign activities at issue in Greer v. Spock did
not curtail service members' speech off base and were &quot;evenhandedly applied&quot;
with no particular message or position singled out for suppression.  424 U.S. at
839.  Likewise, the neutral regulation governing apparel that was upheld in
Goldman v. Weinberger, 475 U.S. 503, 508 (1986), expressly limited its effect to
service members &quot;while performing their military duties.&quot;  In both
Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733 (1974) and Blameusen v. Andrews, 630 F.2d 538 (7th
Cir. 1980), the restrictions on speech were individualized determinations and
were upheld on the basis of concerns about the service members' failure to
follow orders.</P>
<P>17.  See supra at __; see also S. Hrg. No. 103-845 at 403 (JA 224)
(Lieutenant General Calvin Waller asserting that &quot;if you allow [open
homosexuality] you are going to see that the good young men and young women that
we currently have will say I do not want to be a part of that kind of force&quot;);
id. at 599 (JA 235) (General Schwarzkopf claiming that &quot;[a] military leader
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>. . . known as a homosexual is unable to effectively command or lead his or
her soldiers because of a loss of respect and trust in his or her abilities&quot;);
139 Cong. Rec. S11192 (Sept. 9, 1993) (JA 766) (Senator Nunn pointing to &quot;declared&quot;
versus &quot;private&quot; line and &quot;how open homosexuality affects other
people . . . in the unit&quot;).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>18.  Despite the argument that &quot;privacy&quot; concerns are unique to
the issue of known gay men and lesbians, opponents of racial integration
expressed equally strong aversion to the idea of serving and living in close
physical proximity to African-Americans.  &quot;[T]he major concerns among white
soldiers seemed to be the prospects of intimate physical contact with blacks&quot;
such as &quot;shar[ing] dormitor[ies].&quot;  RAND Report at 184 (JA 983). </P>
<P>Moreover, the separation of service members by gender is irrelevant to the
present &quot;privacy&quot; argument, because lesbians, gay men and
heterosexuals are all socialized in a society that separates its members by
gender, but not by sexual orientation.  Trial Testimony of Dr. Pepper Schwartz
at 133-36 (E.D.N.Y. Docket No. 147) (gay and non-gay people grow up together in
a society where they live, shower, exercise and share toilet facilities in
proximity all the time.)</P>
<P>19.  In addition, grounding a law applicable to all Americans on the
religious beliefs of some would violate the Establishment Clause.  See Stone v.
Graham, 449 U.S. 39, 40-43 (1980); McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 429-53
(1961).</P>
<P>20.  Whatever the similarities or differences between discrimination based
on sexual orientation and race, there is no doubt that the military's last
predictions of violent reaction were unfounded, and what negative reactions did
occur were handled through chain of command and leadership to make the military
an exemplary equal-opportunity employer when it comes to race.  RAND Report at
165-70 &amp; 183-86 (JA 964-970 &amp; 982-985).</P>
<P>21.  For example, in Jeffries, far from addressing an across-the-board
discharge policy applicable to thousands, the government action at issue was an
individualized employment decision which only limited plaintiff's term in a
purely ministerial position, and, as this Court emphasized, plaintiff was &quot;still
a tenured professor&quot; and &quot;the defendants have not sought to silence
him.&quot;  52 F.3d at 14 (emphasis supplied).</P>
<P>22.  While the government asserts that lesbian and gay service members
engage in more homosexual sexual misconduct than heterosexuals do, (Gov't Br. at
25), this does not change the fact that lesbian and gay service members are not
more likely than heterosexuals to engage in any prohibited sexual misconduct in
the first place. See Trial Testimony of Dr. Schwartz at 127 (E.D.N.Y. Docket No.
147) (lesbians and gay men no more likely to engage in acts that constitute
sodomy under UCMJ than heterosexuals).  </P>
<P>The government's position merely underscores its targeting of behavior that
reveals a particular sexual orientation -- homosexual -- and not the behavior
itself.  Indeed, many more heterosexuals are prosecuted each year for UCMJ
sodomy violations than lesbians or gay men.  <B>(cite).</B></P>
<P>23.  Classifications based on sexual orientation ought to receive heightened
judicial scrutiny because they meet the Supreme Court's criteria for elevated
equal protection scrutiny:  (1) lesbians and gay men have historically been
subjected to &quot;purposeful unequal treatment,&quot; see, e.g., Cleburne, 473
U.S. at 441; (2) there is a lack of relation between sexual orientation and the
&quot;ability to perform or contribute to society,&quot; id.; and (3) lesbians
and gay men are in a position of relative political powerlessness within the
majoritarian, legislative political sphere, see, e.g., San Antonio Independent
School District v. Rodriquez, 411 U.S. 1, 28 (1973).  Because the Act's
classification fails even rational basis equal protection review, however,

plaintiffs discuss only the application of that test.</P>
<P>24.  Compare, e.g., Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 448 (stringent application of
rationality requirement to other purported interests where government &quot;was
concerned with the negative attitude of the majority&quot;) and Moreno, 413 U.S.
at 534-38 (stringent application where Congress had apparently relied on
illegitimate &quot;`purpose to discriminate against hippies'&quot;), with FCC v.
Beach Communications, 113 S.Ct. 2096 (1993) (cursory review of cable television
regulation where no suggestion of illegitimate goal behind distinction at issue)
and Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635 (1986) (cursory review of food stamp
restriction where no evidence of any improper interest).</P>
<P>25.  Thus, cases cited by the government addressing only privacy and due
process claims (Gov't Br. at 21) are irrelevant.  Moreover, earlier cases, such
as Beller v. Middendorf, 632 F.2d 788 (9th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 452 U.S.
905 (1981), explicitly relied on the prejudices of heterosexual service members
(that they &quot;despise/detest&quot; homosexuality), a rationale which cannot
survive the Supreme Court's subsequent holdings in Cleburne, 473 U.S. 432 and
Palmore, 466 U.S. 429.  See Pruitt, 963 F.2d at 1165.  While Falk v. Secretary
of the Army, 870 F.2d 941 (2d Cir. 1989), relied on by the government, involved
the military's regulations as to same-sex sexual conduct, it was not only not an
equal protection challenge, it was not a constitutional challenge at all.</P>
<P>26.  Under the UCMJ's &quot;General Article,&quot; 10 U.S.C. &#167; 934,
only service members of different ranks can be punished for having a
relationship, and then only if the facts of the case show &quot;conduct
prejudicial to good order and discipline or of a nature to discredit the armed
forces.&quot;  See, e.g., U.S. v. Johans, 20 M.J. 115 (C.M.A. 1985), cert.
denied, 474 U.S. 850 (1985) (consensual and private sex between male officer and
a female enlisted member not under his supervision held not violative of the &quot;General
Article.&quot;) </P>
<P>27.  &quot;The Act proscribes and deters Plaintiffs from, in their everyday
lives, . . . engaging in behavior encompassed within 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(b)(1)
that would otherwise be consistent with their obligations as service members and
with other rules and regulations promulgated by defendants.&quot;  Amended
Responses to Interrogatories at 15 (JA 130).</P>
<P>28.  As to both the equal protection and First Amendment claims, plaintiffs
do not have to wait for actual enforcement of the Act against them (and
certainly not application of every subsection) to show injury in fact.  See
Virginia v. American Booksellers Assoc., 484 U.S. 383, 393 (1988) (&quot;We are
not troubled by the pre-enforcement nature of this suit. . . .  plaintiffs have
alleged an actual and well-founded fear that the law will be enforced against
them.  Further, the alleged danger of this statute is, in large measure, one of
self-censorship; a harm that can be realized without an actual prosecution&quot;);
Sequoia Books, Inc. v. Ingemunson, 901 F.2d 630, 634 (7th Cir. 1990) (facial
First Amendment challenge founded on distinct and palpable injury in fact, where
plaintiff brought pre-enforcement action based upon law's pressure to
self-censor), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 959 (1990).</P>
<P>29.  Plaintiffs indisputably brought this action as a challenge to the
entirety of &#167; 654, they made this clear in the Complaint and the Amended
Complaint (see Complaint &#182;&#182; 19-21 (E.D.N.Y. Docket No. 1); Amended
Complaint &#182;&#182; 20-22 (JA 100-101)) and throughout the district court
proceedings.  That plaintiffs' preliminary injunction request, and the
government's unsuccessful appeal of the resulting injunctions, focused on one
aspect of the case -- three plaintiffs' imminent discharge for statements
violating &#167; 654(b)(2) -- says nothing about the nature of the case as a
whole or other injuries under the Act that plaintiffs are suffering on an
ongoing basis.  Under these circumstances, there is no basis for stripping
plaintiffs of their full constitutional claim.  See Akins v. Bd. of Gov. of
State Colleges and Univ., 840 F.2d 1371 (7th Cir.) (plaintiffs did not abandon
particular claim for relief where submission mentioned claim), vacated on other
grounds, 488 U.S. 920 (1988).</P>
<P>30.  Moreover, the statute itself ties &quot;statements&quot; to &quot;acts,&quot;
and Congress explicitly attempted to justify all aspects of Section 654 by
asserting that &quot;homosexual acts&quot; are destructive of &quot;morale, good
order and discipline, and unit cohesion,&quot; 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654(a)(15). </P>
<P>31.  In addressing the issue of irreparable injury, the government confuses
the administrative regulations challenged under the First Amendment in Brown v.
Glines, 444 U.S. 348 (1980) and Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828 (1976), and the
administrative proceedings which a plaintiff may or may not have to exhaust in
order to bring a claim in federal court.  Gov't Br. at 15-16.  Thus, for
example, in Brown, plaintiff challenged a regulation requiring prior approval
before petitioning members of Congress, but plaintiff was not required to
exhaust military remedies for his claim that this regulation violated his First
Amendment rights.  Brown, 444 U.S. at 352 n.6.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1>GUARDIAN OF LIBERTY: AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION
</H1>
<img src="../graphics/bpline.gif">         
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union is the nation's foremost advocate of
individual rights -- litigating, legislating, and educating the public on
a broad array of issues affecting individual freedom in the United States. 
This is a general introduction and history to the ACLU, the first in a
series of briefing papers.  Other briefing papers, produced by the ACLU
Office of Public Education, explain the organization's position on a range
of specific civil liberties issues.
<P>
The American system of government is built on two basic, counterbalancing
principles: 1) that the majority of the people, through democratically
elected representatives, governs the country and 2) that the power of even
a democratic majority must be limited to insure individual rights.  In
every era of American history, the government has tried to expand its
authority at the expense of individual rights.  The American Civil
Liberties Union exists to make sure that doesn't happen, and to fight back
when it does.
<P>
The ACLU is not a public defender like Legal Services or Legal Aid.  It
does not handle criminal cases or civil disputes or choose sides according
to financial criteria.  Nor do we take political sides; we are neither
liberal nor conservative, Republican nor Democratic.  The ACLU is a
nonprofit, nonpartisan, 275,000-member public interest organization
devoted exclusively to protecting the basic civil liberties of all
Americans, and extending them to groups that have traditionally been
denied them.  In its almost seven decades in existence, the ACLU has
become a national institution, and is widely recognized as the country's
foremost advocate of individual rights.
<P>


<h3>THE ACLU MANDATE</h3>
<br>
The mission of the ACLU is to assure that the Bill of Rights -- amendments
to the Constitution that guard against unwarranted governmental control --
are preserved for each new generation.  To understand the ACLU's purpose,
it is important to distinguish between the Constitution and the Bill of
Rights.  The Constitution itself, whose bicentennial we celebrated in
1987, authorizes the government to act.  The Bill of Rights limits that
authority.


<h3>What rights are guaranteed in the Bill of Rights?</h3>

<b>First Amendment rights:</b>  These include freedom of speech, association and
assembly, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion, including the
strict separation between church and state.
<P>
<b>Equal protection of the law:</b>  The right to equal treatment regardless of
race, sex, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, age, physical
handicap, or other such classification.  These rights apply to the voting
booth, the classroom, the workplace and the courts.
<P>
<b>Due process of law:</b>  The right to be treated fairly when facing criminal
charges or other serious accusations that can result in such penalties as
loss of employment, exclusion from school, denial of housing, or cut-off
of benefits.
<P>
<b>The right to privacy:</b>  The right to a guaranteed zone of personal privacy
and autonomy which cannot be penetrated by the government or by other
institutions, like employers, with substantial influence over an
individual's rights.
<P>
<b>Expanding those protections:</b>  Although some segments of our population
have traditionally been denied these rights, the ACLU works to extend
protection to racial minorities, homosexuals, mental patients, prisoners,
soldiers, children in the custody of the state, the handicapped, and
Native Americans.


<h3>A BRIEF HISTORY</h3>

When Roger Baldwin founded the ACLU in 1920, civil liberties were in a
sorry state.  Citizens were sitting in jail for holding antiwar views.
U.S. Attorney General Palmer was conducting raids upon aliens suspected of
holding unorthodox opinions.  Racial segregation was the law of the land
and violence against blacks was routine.  Sex discrimination was firmly
institutionalized; it wasn't until 1920 that women even got the vote. 
Constitutional rights for homosexuals, the poor, prisoners, mental
patients, and other special groups were literally unthinkable.  And,
perhaps most significantly, the Supreme Court had yet to uphold a _single_
free speech claim under the First Amendment.
<P>
<i>&quotWe must remember that a right lost to one is lost to all.  The ACLU
remembers and it acts.  The cause it serves so well is an imperative of
freedom.&quot --- William Reece Smith, Jr., former president, American Bar
Association</i>
<P>
The ACLU was the first public interest law firm of its kind, and
immediately began the work of transforming the ideals contained in the
Bill of Rights into living, breathing realities.  Some highlights:
<p>

<b>1920: The Palmer Raids</b>
<br>
In its first year the ACLU worked at combating the deportation of aliens
for their radical beliefs (ordered by Attorney General Palmer), opposing
attacks on the rights of the Industrial Workers of the World and trade
unions to hold meetings and organize, and securing release from prison for
the hundreds sentenced during the war for expression of antiwar opinions.
<P>

<b>1925: The Scopes Case</b>
<br>
When Tennessee's new anti-evolution law became effective in March 1925,
the ACLU at once sought a test of the statute's attack on free speech and
secured John T. Scopes, a young science teacher, as a plaintiff.  Clarence
Darrow, a member of the Union's National Committee and an agnostic,
headed the ACLU's volunteer defense team.  Scopes was convicted and fined
$100.  On appeal, the Tennessee Supreme Court upheld the statute but
reversed the conviction.
<P>
<b>1933: The Ulysses Case</b><br>
Federal Judge John M. Woolsey in New York
rendered a historic anticensorship decision that admitted James Joyce's
Ulysses into the U.S. after a long legal battle supported by the ACLU.
<P>

<b>1939: Mayor Hague</b><br>
Mayor Frank (&quotI Am the Law&quot) Hague of Jersey City claimed the right to
deny free speech to anyone he thought radical.  The ACLU took Hague to the
Supreme Court, which ruled that public places such as streets and parks
belong to the people, not the mayor.
<P>
<b>1942: Japanese Americans</b><br>
Two and half months after Pearl Harbor, 110,000 Japanese Americans,
two-thirds of whom were citizens, were evacuated from their West Coast
homes and relocated in a series of inland U.S. concentration camps.  The
episode was a national tragedy, rightfully called by the ACLU &quotthe worst
single wholesale violation of civil rights of American citizens in our
history.&quot The strongest voices against evacuation and relocation came from
the ACLU affiliates on the West Coast.
<P>

<I>&quotThe ACLU's 60-year guardianship of the Bill of Rights
has done much to advance the cause of working men and
women.&quot----Douglas Fraser, former president, United Auto Workers</I>
<P>

<b>1950: Loyalty Oaths</b><br>
During the Cold War era after World War II, Congress and many state
legislatures passed loyalty-oath laws requiring one group or another,
particularly public school teachers, to swear that they were not
Communists or members of any "subversive organizations." Throughout the
decade the ACLU fought a running battle against the government's
loyalty-security program.
<P>
<b>1954: School Desegregation</b><br>
On May 17, 1954, in Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court
issued its historic decision that segregation in public schools violates
the 14th Amendment.  The ACLU joined the legal battle that resulted in the
Court's decision.
<P>
<b>1960: Civil Rights Movement</b><P>
From the first lunch counter sit-in in 1960 through the freedom rides and
later mass marches, the ACLU supported the civil rights movement's goal of
equality and its means of achieving that goal through peaceful
demonstrations.
<P>
<I>&quotWe in business applaud and share the ACLU's
commitment to preserving the fundamental principles
which have made this country work for over 200
years.&quot----John H. Filer, former chairman, Aetna Life and Casualty</I>
<P>

<b>1973: Impeach Nixon</b><br>
The ACLU was the first major national organization to call for the 
impeachment of President Richard Nixon.  The Union listed six grounds for 
impeachment affecting civil liberties -- specific, proved violations of 
the right of political dissent; usurpation of Congressional war-making 
powers; establishment of a personal secret police that committed crimes; 
attempted interference in the trial of Daniel Ellsberg; distortion of the 
system of justice; and perversion of other federal agencies.
<p>
<b>1973: Abortion Decriminalized</b><br>
In Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, the Supreme Court held that the
constitutional right to privacy encompasses a pregnant woman's decision
whether to bear a child or have an abortion.  The ruling struck down state
laws that had made the performance of an abortion a criminal act.  The
ACLU was and remains active in the courts to protect that right.

<p>
<b>1981: Creationism in Arkansas</b><br>
In Arkansas, 56 years after Scopes, the ACLU challenged a statute that
called for the teaching of the biblical story of creation as a &quotscientific
alternative&quot to the theory of evolution.  The statute, which
fundamentalists saw as a model for other states , was ruled
unconstitutional by U.S. District Judge William R. Overton. 
Creation-science, he said, was not science but religion, and could not
constitutionally be required by state law.
<p>

<b>1982: Voting Rights Extended</b><br>
More than 15 months of grassroots lobbying by the ACLU and other groups
paid off when the Senate, following the example of the House,
overwhelmingly voted to renew the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
<P>
<b>1987: Block Bork</b><br>
The ACLU, changing a 51-year-old policy of neutrality on Supreme Court
candidates, mounted a national campaign to defeat the nomination of Judge
Robert Bork.  Bork, the ACLU said, posed an extraordinary threat to
fundamental liberties guaranteed by the Bill of Rights, and to the role
of the Supreme Court as the guardian of those rights.  A majority of
Senators agreed and rejected his nomination.
<P>

<b>1989: Fall-out From Attacks </b><br>
Months after the ACLU had been attacked by George Bush during the
presidential election campaign, 50,000 new members signed up in a surge of
support for the organization.
<P>
<b>1993: Resurgence of the Radical Right</b><br>
Though the end of the Reagan-Bush era brought improved prospects for civil
liberties at the federal level, numerous right-wing extremists saw
opportunities for local organizing.  The ACLU opposed the agenda of school
boards dominated by extremists and challenged  anti-choice anti-gay ballot
initiatives.
<P>

<b>Today: Staying the Course</b><br>
The ACLU confronts both traditional and new threats to civil liberties on
many fronts.  Advanced technologies presage new systems that have the
capacity to either diminish or expand rights.  Meanwhile, our society's
most intractable problems remain age-old ones: racism, sexism, homophobia
and religious intolerance.  The ACLU's mission remains realizing the
promise of the Bill of Rights for all and expanding the reach of its
guarantees to new areas.


<h3>HOW THE ACLU CHOOSES ITS CASES </h3>


The ACLU is frequently asked "Why did you defend that person or that group
-- Nazis in Skokie, Illinois, the Ku Klux Klan, the Black Panthers?" The
ACLU defends the _right_ of people to express their views, not the views
that they express.  And historically, the people whose opinions are the
most controversial or extreme are those whose rights are most often
threatened.  Believing that once the government is empowered to violate
one person's rights it can use that power against everyone, the ACLU works
to stop the erosion of civil liberties before its too late.
<P>
The ACLU cannot take on every worthy case.  Instead, our lawyers select
cases that will have the greatest impact, cases that will have the
potential to break new ground and to establish new precedents that will
strengthen the freedoms we all enjoy.

<h3>HOW THE ACLU WORKS </h3>

The ACLU is a 50-state network of staffed affiliate offices in most major
cities, more than 300 chapters in smaller towns, and regional offices in
Denver and Atlanta.  Work is coordinated by a national office in New York,
aided by a legislative office in Washington that lobbies Congress.  The
ACLU has more than a dozen national projects devoted to specific civil
liberties issues: AIDS, arts censorship, capital punishment, children's
rights, education reform, lesbian and gay rights, immigrants' rights, 
national security, privacy and technology, prisoners' rights, reproductive
freedom, voting rights, women's rights and workplace rights.
<P>
The ACLU has more than 60 staff attorneys, who collaborate with at least
2,000 volunteer attorneys in handling close to 6,000 cases annually --
making the Union the largest public interest law firm in the nation.  The
ACLU appears before the U.S. Supreme Court more than any other
organization except the U.S. Department of Justice.
<P>
<i>&quotSo long as we have enough people in this country
willing to fight for their rights, we'll be called a
democracy.&quot--- ACLU founder Roger Baldwin</i>
<P>
The ACLU is governed by an 84-member Board of Directors which has one
representative from each state affiliate and 30 at-large members elected
by the affiliate and national boards.  The affiliate boards, in turn, are
elected by all ACLU members within the state.  On a day-to-basis, each
affiliate is autonomous and makes its own decisions about which cases to
take and which issues to emphasize.  They collaborate with the national
office in pursuit of common goals.
<P>

<h3>THE FINANCIAL PICTURE</h3>

The ACLU is supported by annual dues and contributions from its members,
plus grants from private foundations and individuals.  The ACLU does not
receive any government funding.
<P>
If you believe your civil liberties have been violated, contact the local
ACLU office listed in your telephone directory.  For more information, or

<blockquote>
<p>Respondent University of Virginia, a state instrumentality,
authorizes payments from its Student Activities Fund (SAF) to
outside contractors for the printing costs of a variety of
publications issued by student groups called -Contracted
Independent Organizations(CIOs). The SAF receives its money from
mandatory student fees and is designed to support a broad range
of extracurricular student activities related to the
University's educational purpose.  CIOs must include in their
dealings with third parties and in all written materials a
disclaimer stating that they are independent of the University
and that the University is not responsible for them.  The
University withheld authorization for payments to a printer on
behalf of petitioners' CIO, Wide Awake Productions (WAP), solely
because its student newspaper, Wide Awake: A Christian
Perspective at the University of Virginia, primarily promotes
or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an
ultimate reality,as prohibited by the University's SAF
Guidelines.  Petitioners filed this suit under 42 U.S.C. 1983,
alleging, inter alia, that the refusal to authorize payment
violated their First Amendment right to freedom of speech.
After the District Court granted summary judgment for the
University, the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the
University's invocation of viewpoint discrimination to deny
third-party payment violated the Speech Clause, but concluding
that the discrimination was justified by the necessity of
complying with the Establishment Clause.
</p>
<h4>Held:
</h4>
<p>1. The Guideline invoked to deny SAF support, both in its terms
and in its application to these petitioners, is a denial of
their right of free speech.  Pp. 7-16.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) The Guideline violates the principles governing speech in
limited public forums, which apply to the SAF under, e.g., Perry
Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 46-47.
In determining whether a State is acting within its power to
preserve the limits it has set for such a forum so that the
exclusion of a class of speech there is legitimate, see, e.g.,
id., at 49, this Court has observed a distinction between, on
the one hand, content discrimination--i.e., discrimination
against speech because of its subject matter-which may be
permissible if it preserves the limited forum's purposes, and,
on the other hand, viewpoint discrimination--i.e., discrimination
because of the speaker's specific motivating ideology, opinion,
or perspective--which is presumed impermissible when directed
against speech otherwise within the forum's limitations, see
id., at 46.  The most recent and most apposite case in this area
is Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508
U.S. __, __, in which the Court held that permitting school
property to be used for the presentation of all views on an
issue except those dealing with it from a religious standpoint
constitutes prohibited viewpoint discrimination.  Here, as in
that case, the State's actions are properly interpreted as
unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination rather than
permissible line-drawing based on content: By the very terms of
the SAF prohibition, the University does not exclude religion as
a subject matter, but selects for disfavored treatment those
student journalistic efforts with religious editorial
viewpoints.  Pp. 7-11.
</p>
<p>(b) The University's attempt to escape the consequences of
Lamb's Chapel by urging that this case involves the provision of
funds rather than access to facilities is unavailing.  Although
it may regulate the content of expression when it is the speaker
or when it enlists private entities to convey its own message,
Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173; Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263,
276, the University may not discriminate based on the viewpoint
of private persons whose speech it subsidizes, Regan v. Taxation
with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540, 548.  Its argument
that the scarcity of public money may justify otherwise
impermissible viewpoint discrimination among private speakers is
simply wrong.  Pp. 11-14.
</p>
<p>(c) Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here.
The Guideline at issue has a vast potential reach: The term -
promotesas used there would comprehend any writing advocating a
philosophic position that rests upon a belief (or nonbelief) in
a deity or ultimate reality, while the term -manifestswould
bring within the prohibition any writing resting upon a premise
presupposing the existence (or nonexistence) of a deity or
ultimate reality. It is difficult to name renowned thinkers
whose writings would be accepted, save perhaps for articles
disclaiming all connection to their ultimate philosophy.  Pp. 14
-16.
</p></blockquote>
<p>2. The violation following from the University's denial of SAF
support to petitioners is not excused by the necessity of
complying with the Establishment Clause.  Pp. 16-25.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) The governmental program at issue is neutral toward
religion.  Such neutrality is a significant factor in upholding
programs in the face of Establishment Clause attack, and the
guarantee of neutrality is not offended where, as here, the
government follows neutral criteria and even-handed policies to
extend benefits to recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints,
including religious ones, are broad and diverse, Board of Ed.
of Kiryas Joel v. Grumet, 512 U.S. __, __.  There is no
suggestion that the University created its program to advance
religion or aid a religious cause.  The SAF's purpose is to open
a forum for speech and to support various student enterprises,
including the publication of newspapers, in recognition of the
diversity and creativity of student life.  The SAF Guidelines
have a separate classification for, and do not make third-party
payments on behalf of, religious organizations,and WAP did not
seek a subsidy because of its Christian editorial viewpoint; it
sought funding under the Guidelines as a student . . .
communications . . . grou[p]. Neutrality is also apparent in the
fact that the University has taken pains to disassociate itself
from the private speech involved in this case.  The program's
neutrality distinguishes the student fees here from a tax levied
for the direct support of a church or group of churches, which
would violate the Establishment Clause.  Pp. 16-21.
</p>
<p>(b) This case is not controlled by the principle that special
Establishment Clause dangers exist where the government makes
direct money payments to sectarian institutions, see, e.g.,
Roemer v. Board of Public Works, 426 U.S. 736, 747, since it is
undisputed that no public funds flow directly into WAP's coffers
under the program at issue.  A public university does not
violate the Establishment Clause when it grants access to its
facilities on a religion-neutral basis to a wide spectrum of
student groups, even if some of those groups would use the
facilities for devotional exercises.  See e.g., Widmar, 474
U.S., at 269.  This is so even where the upkeep, maintenance,
and repair of those facilities is paid out of a student
activities fund to which students are required to contribute.
Id., at 265.  There is no difference in logic or principle, and
certainly no difference of constitutional significance, between
using such funds to operate a facility to which students have
access, and paying a third-party contractor to operate the
facility on its behalf.  That is all that is involved here: The
University provides printing services to a broad spectrum of
student newspapers.  Were the contrary view to become law, the
University could only avoid a constitutional violation by
scrutinizing the content of student speech, lest it contain too
great a religious message.  Such censorship would be far more
inconsistent with the Establishment Clause's dictates than would
governmental provision of secular printing services on a
religion-blind basis.  Pp. 21-25.  
</p></blockquote>
<p>18 F.3d 269, reversed.
</p>
<p>Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which
Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor, Scalia, and Thomas, JJ., joined.
O'Connor, J., and Thomas, J., filed concurring opinions.

<title> American Civil Liberties Union Briefing Paper Number 7</title>
<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<img src="../graphics/bphead.gif">
<h1>Reproductive Freedom:  The Rights of Minors
</h1>
<img src="../graphics/bpline.gif">
<p>A pregnant woman's constitutional right to choose between childbirth and
abortion was established in 1973 by the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> ruling.  All women, including those under 18, are entitled to
a safe, legal abortion.  But in many states, a young woman may have a
very difficult time exercising that right because laws require that she
first notify her parents or obtain their consent.
</p>
<p>Of the more than one million teenage pregnancies that occur in the United
States each year, over 80 percent are unintended.  Nearly all pregnant
teens are unwed, and some 40 percent of them choose abortion.
</p>
<p>Ideally, a teenager should be able to tell her parents about her
pregnancy, obtain their love and support and arrive at critical decisions
about her future through family discussions.  The majority of pregnant
teenagers do tell at least one parent about their pregnancies.  However,
some teenagers cannot tell their parents.  Some are members of broken
families; some are victims of incest or other forms of family abuse; some
have run away from home, often for good reason.
</p>
<p>The need to reinforce family relationships is the reason most often cited
to justify state laws requiring parental notification or consent before
abortion.  But such laws are unnecessary for stable and supportive
families, and they are ineffective and cruel for unstable, troubled
families.  Such laws cannot transform abusive families into supportive
ones, nor can they reduce the alarmingly high rate of teenage pregnancy. 
Instead, they only add to the crushing problems faced by pregnant
teenagers: They create delays that increase the medical risks of abortion
and effectively eliminate the option of abortion for many minors. 
Tragically, those minors in greatest need of confidential medical care are
often the very ones whose access to care is delayed.
</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union opposes parental consent and
notification laws on the grounds that they infringe upon minors'
constitutional rights and serve no useful purpose.  To prevent unwanted
pregnancy from being a dangerous condition for teenagers, we must ensure
that young women have access to confidential counseling, contraception and
abortion services, as well as prenatal care.  At stake are young women's
lives, safety, health and dignity.
</p>
<p>Here are the ACLU's answers to questions frequently asked by the public
about the reproductive rights of minors.
</p>
<h3>Q: How many states have passed laws that restrict teenagers' access to
abortion?
</h3>
<p>A: Thirty-one states have passed legislation, as of 1989, restricting
teenagers' access to abortion.  These laws require teenagers under 18 to
either notify their parents before seeking an abortion or obtain parental
consent.  Some states do not currently enforce the laws because they have
been ruled unconstitutional by a federal or state court, or they resemble
laws declared unconstitutional.
</p>
<p>Eleven states continue to enforce parental notification or consent laws,
and others are considering enacting new laws.
</p>
<h3>Q: How do these laws work?
</h3>
<p>A: The laws vary.  Some states require a physician or a physician's agent to
notify at least one parent of a minor seeking abortion, either in person,
by telephone, or in writing.  Other states require a physician or his/her
agent to obtain parental consent.  Health care providers who fail to meet
state requirements can lose their licenses to practice or even face
criminal penalties.
</p>
<h3>Q: What's the difference between a consent and a notification law?
</h3>
<p>A: <b>Parental consent</b> laws require one parent or both parents to give written
permission before their daughter can obtain an abortion.  <b>Parental
notification</b> requires that one or both parents be notified in advance of
their daughter's abortion.  Although notification laws technically do not
permit parents to veto their daughter's decision, some states either
require that one parent sign a form or impose a waiting period between
notification and the abortion.  While consent and notification
requirements differ, the result is the same: Young women's abortions are
delayed or obstructed because of governmental interference.
</p>
<h3>Q: What's wrong with parental notification or consent laws?
</h3>
<p>A: Parental notification or consent laws can expose a teenager from an
abusive or otherwise dysfunctional family to emotional trauma and physical
danger, and many young women who avoid telling their parents about their
plans to terminate an unwanted pregnancy come from such families.
</p>
<p>Courts have found that teenagers who want to keep their pregnancies a
secret almost always have sound reasons.  And family counseling experts
have testified that forced communication frequently has disastrous
results.  Indeed, where abortion is concerned, privacy can be a life or
death matter for teenagers.
</p>
<p>Confidentiality has also proven crucial to the effective delivery to
minors of several other health care services, including treatment for
venereal disease and drug and alcohol abuse, prenatal care and
contraception.  Minors often shun such services if they fear that their
privacy will not be respected.  Thus, most states have passed laws
<i>guaranteeing</i> a minor's right to receive confidential care in these areas.
</p>
<h3>Q: Whatever parents' reactions might be, it's <i>their</i> daughter -- so don't
they have the right to be involved?
</h3>
<p>A: No.  Although parents have interests in their children's well-being, in
the case of pregnancy a teenager's privacy rights must be paramount.  When
there is a reason to expect an extremely abusive parental reaction to a
young woman's unplanned pregnancy, her right to privacy must come first
since she is in the best position to know whether she is in danger.  A
legislature that is unfamiliar with a young woman's particular situation
is <i>not</i> in a position to force her to involve her parents.
</p>
<h3>Q: What types of family situations lead teenagers to seek a confidential
abortion?
</h3>
<p>A: The situations are well documented and surprisingly common.  Some
teenagers fear that a parent will respond to the news of her pregnancy
with physical or sexual abuse.  Sometimes, the news could place both a
mother and daughter at risk of violence by an enraged father.  Some young
women fear the news will exacerbate a parent's psychiatric or physical
illness, drug or alcohol abuse, or troubled relationships with other
family members.  Some teenagers are runaways and dare not risk returning
to their troubled homes.
</p>
<h3>Q: Can a teenager, suddenly faced with the choice between childbirth and
abortion, really make a responsible decision?
</h3>
<p>A: Yes.  The American Psychological Association has found that minors are
usually able to make intelligent, informed decisions about pregnancy. 
Even young women from severely troubled families often show great maturity
and sensitivity when seeking confidential birth services.  During one
abortion rights trial, clinic and court personnel testified that minors
accurately assess their family circumstances and base their decisions on
mature analysis and judgement.
</p>
<p>In any event, doctors are required to obtain informed consent from every
patient facing surgery, which ensures that an abortion would not be
performed on any woman incapable of giving consent.
</p>
<h3>Q: Don't laws restricting abortion also contain alternatives for mature
minors or those who fear parental reprisals?
</h3>
<p>A: Yes.  Most state laws requiring parental notification or consent allow a
pregnant minor to go to court and request permission for a confidential
abortion (that is, without parental involvement).  But this process
usually requires a teenager to make an appointment with the court, travel
some distance, and either find an attorney or plead her own case before
one or more court officials.
</p>
<p>This procedure, called a judicial bypass, is costly and humiliating and
traumatizing.  Teenagers must reveal detailed personal information to as
many as 20 or more strangers on staff in the court system.  In small
communities, word may get back to parents, thus defeating the purpose of
the bypass, which is to ensure privacy.  This anxiety-producing judicial
process is a heavy burden to place on young women who are simply seeking
health services.
</p>
<p>Another problem is that the bypass discriminates against the poor.  Young
women who lack financial resources and supportive families -- that is,
those most in need of help -- are the least likely to be able to navigate
the complicated bypass process.  For such teenagers, the complexities and
delays involved may cancel out the option of safe and legal abortion.
</p>
<h3>Q: Aren't legal delays justified when a teenager might risk physical and
emotional harm by having an abortion?
</h3>
<p>A: Actually, delays increase the risk of harm.  The longer a teenager waits
to terminate a pregnancy, the greater the risk to her health. 
Furthermore, childbirth is more risky at all stages of pregnancy than
abortion.  Statistics compiled by the federal Centers for Disease Control
and other sources indicate that the risk of death from childbirth is, on
average, 24 times higher than the risk of death from abortion at up to 12
weeks of pregnancy.  Teenagers are more likely than adults to suffer
medical complications attributable to childbirth.
</p>
<p>Access to legal abortion in the United States has dramatically improved
women's health.  Abortion is not only one of the safest surgical
procedures available, it is generally safer for teenagers than for adults. 
Moreover, a recent government study found that unmarried, sexually active
teenage girls who chose abortion experienced no emotional damage; rather,
they gained a sense of control over their lives.
</p>
<h3>Q: What are the consequences, besides increased health risks, of restricting
teens' access to abortion?
</h3>
<p>A: Laws that restrict access to abortion by requiring parental involvement
increase teenage birth rates.  For example, according to testimony in the
reproductive freedom case, <i>Hodgson v. Minnesota</i>, the Minneapolis birthrate
rose 38.4 percent among mothers aged 15 to 17 after enforcement of a
parental notification law.  The birthrate for 18 to 19 year-old women, who
were not affected by the law, rose only .3 percent during the same
period.
</p>
<p>Having little education, few skills and responsibility for a child they
may not have wanted, teenage mothers and their children are seven times
more likely to slide into poverty.  According to national estimates,
children born to teenage mothers in 1987 will receive more than $5.5
billion in federal welfare payments over a 20-year period.  And because
children born to teenagers are often unwanted, those children may suffer
severe psychological and educational disadvantages.  As for the minors
themselves, their entire adult lives are often limited, if not ruined, by
government laws that effectively force them into motherhood.
</p>
<h3>Q: Do restrictions on minors affect the reproductive choices of other women?
</h3>
<p>A: Yes, abortion restrictions directed at minors affect the reproductive
rights of all women.  These rights are rooted in the privacy principle --
that is, choices about childbearing are personal, private, and none of the
government's business.  When government invades the realm of privacy to
limit the reproductive freedom of teenagers, it undermines the privacy
principle and threatens the privacy rights, not only of all women, but of
all Americans.
</p>
<h3>Q: What can be done to provide genuine help for teenagers and, thus, reduce
their need for abortion?
</h3>
<p>A: States can and should provide confidential reproductive health services
and counseling programs that are accessible to teenagers before they
become pregnant.  These programs should dispense candid information about
sexuality, reproduction, contraception, and the importance of family
support and communication.  Such programs could not only reduce the number
of unwanted teen pregnancies, but they could also strengthen family bonds
and prevent family crises that are precipitated by teenage pregnancies.
</p>
<p>Most important, a teenager should be afforded the security of knowing she
can assume the adult role of motherhood if and when she, not the
government, chooses.  Reproductive freedom -- including the right to
confidential contraception, abortion and prenatal care services -- is
essential to this goal.  Intrusive state laws that claim to encourage
family communication, while clearly undermining the best interests of
families, ill serve teenagers.  Those laws interfere with the right of
private decision-making and do nothing to stem the high rate of unwanted
teenage pregnancies.
</p>
<p>The ACLU, in cooperation with other organizations, will continue to
provide legislative advocacy and information to the public, aimed at
securing reproductive freedom for all women.  This includes minors, who
are entitled to the same rights of privacy guaranteed to all citizens by
the Constitution.

</h3>
<p>		&quot;It is not the policy of the law to punish those unsuccessful threats which it is not presumed would terrify ordinary persons excessively; and there is so much opportunity for magnifying or misunderstanding undefined menaces that probably as much mischief would be caused by letting them be prosecuted as by refraining from it.&quot;
</p>
<p>The People v. B. F. Jones, 62 Mich. 304 (1886).
</p>

<h4>	I. Introduction</h4>
<p>	This is a criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 875(c).  Defendant Jake Baker (Baker) is charged in a superseding indictment with five counts of transmitting threats to injure or kidnap another, in electronic mail (e-mail) messages transmitted via the Internet.   Now before the Court is Baker's motion to quash the superseding indictment.  For the reasons that follow, the motion will be granted.
</p>
<h4>
II. Background</h4>
<p>	The e-mail messages that form the basis of the charges in this case were exchanged in December, 1994 between Baker in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and defendant Arthur Gonda (Gonda), who sent and received e-mail through a computer in Ontario, Canada.  Gonda's identity and whereabouts are unknown.  The messages excerpted in the superseding indictment are drawn from a larger e-mail exchange between Gonda and Baker began on November 29, 1994, and ended on January 25, 1995.  The specific language of the messages excerpted in the superseding indictment will be discussed in detail below.  They all express a sexual interest in violence against women and girls.
</p><p>
	Baker first appeared before a United States Magistrate Judge on a criminal complaint alleging violation of 18 U.S.C.  875(c), on February 9, 1995.  The complaint was based on an FBI agent's affidavit which cited language taken from a story Baker posted to an Internet newsgroup entitled &quot;alt.sex.stories,&quot; and from e-mail messages he sent to Gonda.  The story graphically described the torture, rape, and murder of a woman who was given the name of a classmate of Baker's at the University of Michigan.  The &quot;alt.sex.stories&quot; newsgroup to which Baker's story was posted is an electronic bulletin board, the contents of which are publicly available via the Internet.  Much of the attention this case garnered centered on Baker's use of a real student's name in the story.   The e-mail messages exchanged between Gonda and Baker were private, and not available in any publicly accessible portion of the Internet.   
</p><p>
	Baker was arrested on the complaint and warrant on February 9, 1995, and detained overnight.  The complaint and warrant is dated the same day.  The following day, February 10, 1995, after holding a hearing a Magistrate Judge ordered Baker detained as a danger to the community.  His detention was affirmed by a United States District Judge later that day.  On March 8, 1995, this Court held a hearing on Baker's motion to be released on bond, and ordered that a psychological evaluation of Baker be performed.  The psychological evaluation was received on March 10, 1995.  The  evaluation concluded that Baker did not pose a threat, and the Court ordered him released that day. 
</p><p>
	On February 14, 1995 the government charged Baker with violating 18 U.S.C.  875(c) in a one count indictment based on unspecified communications transmitted in interstate and foreign commerce from December 2, 1994 through January 9, 1995.  Presumably included in the communications was the story Baker posted.  On March 15, 1995, the government charged Baker and Gonda in a superseding indictment with five counts of violating 18 U.S.C.  875(c).  The story on which the initial complaint was partially based is not mentioned in the superseding indictment, which refers only to e-mail messages exchanged between Gonda and Baker.   The government has filed a bill of particulars identifying who it perceives to be the objects of the allegedly threatening transmissions, as well as witness and exhibit lists.
</p><p>
	Baker, who is named in all five of the superseding indictment's counts, has filed a motion seeking dismissal of all the counts of the superseding indictment.  He contends that application of 18 U.S.C.  875(c) to the e-mail transmissions pushes the boundaries of the statute beyond the limits of the First Amendment.  The government  responds that the motion must be denied because the First Amendment does not protect &quot;true threats,&quot; and because whether a specific communication constitutes a true threat is a question for the jury.
</p><h4>
III. The Law</h4>
<p>	Eighteen U.S.C.  875(c) reads:
</p><blockquote>
	Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
</blockquote>
<p>
The government must allege and prove three elements to support a conviction under  875(c): &quot;(1) a transmission in interstate [or foreign] commerce; (2) a communication containing a threat; and (3) the threat must be a threat to injure [or kidnap] the person of another.&quot;  United States v. DeAndino, 958 F.2d 146, 148 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 2997 (1992).  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, like most others, has held that  875(c) requires only general intent.  Id. at 149.   But see, United States v. Twine, 853 F.2d 676 (9th Cir. 1988) (finding a specific intent requirement in  875(c)). 
</p><p>
  Because  875(c) is a general intent crime, 
intent must be proved by &quot;objectively looking at the defendant's behavior in the totality of the circumstances,&quot; rather than by &quot;probing the defendant's subjective state of mind.&quot;  DeAndino, 958 F.2d at 149.  The Sixth Circuit has also held that &quot;a specific individual as a target of the threat need not be identified.&quot;  United States v. Cox, 957 F.2d 264, 266 (6th Cir. 1992).  Even so, the threat must be aimed as some discrete, identifiable group.  See id. (involving threat to &quot;hurt people&quot; at a specific bank); United States v. Lincoln, 589 F.2d 379 (8th Cir. 1979) (involving letters threatening to kill judges of the Eighth Circuit, under 18 U.S.C.  876).  The threat need not be communicated to the person or group identified as its target.  See United States v. Schroeder, 902 F.2d 1469, 1470-71 (10th Cir.), cert. denied,, 498 U.S. 867 (1990) (affirming  875(c) conviction for a threat against people at a post office made to an Assistant United States Attorney); United States v. Kosma, 951 F.2d 549, 555 (3rd Cir. 1991) (listing cases in which threats against the President were made to third persons, under 18 U.S.C.  871).
</p><p>
	Because prosecution under 18 U.S.C.  875(c) involves punishment of pure speech,  it necessarily implicates and is limited by the First Amendment.  Although the Supreme Court has not addressed the constitutionally permissible scope of  875(c), it has considered a similar statute concerning threats against the President, 18 U.S.C.  871(a),  in Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705.  In Watts, the Supreme Court recognized that:
</p><blockquote>
	a statute such as this one, which makes criminal a form of pure speech, must be interpreted with the commands of the First Amendment clearly in mind.  What is a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech.
</blockquote>
<p>
Id. at 707.  Under Watts, to pass constitutional muster the government must initially prove &quot;a true 'threat.'&quot;  Id.  Factors mentioned in Watts as bearing on whether a specific statement can be taken as a true threat include the context of the statement, including whether the statement has a political dimension; whether the statement was conditional; and the reaction of the listeners.  Id.   Watts also makes clear that the question of whether a statement constitutes a true threat in light of the First Amendment is distinct from the question of the defendant's intent:  &quot;whatever the 'willfulness' requirement implies, the statute initially requires the Government to prove a true 'threat.'&quot;  Id. 
</p><p>
	The distinction between the two questions of whether a statement is a &quot;true threat&quot; for the purposes of First Amendment limitation, and the intention of the statement's maker, is important but unfortunately often confused.  The confusion results from too loose a use of the phrase &quot;true threat.&quot;  
</p><p>
	The only extended discussion of the constitutional dimension of the &quot;true threat&quot; requirement with regard to  875(c) is found in United States v. Kelner, 534 F.2d 1020 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1022 (1976).  In Kelner, the Second Circuit drew on Watts to illuminate the constitutional limits of a prosecution under  875(c):
</p><blockquote>
		The purpose and effect of the Watts constitutionally-limited definition of the term &quot;threat&quot; is to insure that only unequivocal, unconditional and specific expressions of intention immediately to inflict injury may be punished--only such threats, in short, as are of the same nature as those threats which are . . . &quot;properly punished every day under statutes prohibiting extortion, blackmail and assault without consideration of First Amendment issues.&quot;  Watts, 402 F.2d at 690.  </blockquote>
<center>
<hr width=60%>
</center>
<p>	So long as the threat on its face and in the circumstances in which it is made is so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific as to the person threatened, as to convey a gravity of purpose and imminent prospect of execution, the statute may properly be applied.  This clarification of the scope of 18 U.S.C.  875(c) is, we trust, consistent with a rational approach to First Amendment construction which provides for governmental authority in instances of inchoate conduct, where a communication has become &quot;so interlocked with violent conduct as to constitute for all practical purposes part of the [proscribed] action itself.&quot;
Kelner, 534 F.2d at 1027 (quoting T. Emerson, The System of Freedom of Expression, 329 (1970)).  Cf. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447 (1969) (&quot;the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.&quot;)
</p><p>
	The government argues that the standard announced in Kelner is &quot;far more stringent&quot; than the governing standard in the Sixth Circuit.  For the Sixth Circuit &quot;true threat&quot; standard, the government refers the Court to United States v. Lincoln, 462 F.2d 1368, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 952 (1972).  In citing Lincoln for the &quot;true threat&quot; standard, the government confuses the constitutional &quot;true threat&quot; requirement with the statutory intent requirement.  In relevant part, Lincoln reads:
</p><blockquote>
		This Court therefore construes the willfulness requirement of the statute to require only that the defendant intentionally make a statement, written or oral, in a context or under such circumstances wherein a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily harm upon or take the life of the President, and that the statement not be the result of mistake, duress, or coercion.  The statute does not require that the defendant actually intend to carry out the threat.
</blockquote><p>
Lincoln, 462 F.2d at 1368 (quoting and adopting standard from Roy v. United States, 416 F.2d 874, 877-78 (9th Cir. 1969)) (emphasis added).  Lincoln addresses the statute's intent requirement, and adopts the Ninth Circuit's formulation of the intent required.   It does not speak to the constitutional &quot;true threat&quot; requirement imposed by the First Amendment and elucidated in Watts and Kelner.  United States v. Glover, 846 F.2d 339, 343-44 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 982 (1988) and United States v. Vincent, 681 F.2d 462, 464 (6th Cir. 1982), also cited by the government, quote the same language from Roy and also address the statutory intent requirement rather than the constitutional limits of the statute.  None of these cases indicate that a different constitutional standard for prosecution under  875(c) applies in the Sixth Circuit than in the Second Circuit. 
</p><p>
	The confusion between the two requirements is understandable, because the phrase &quot;true threat&quot; has been used in the context of both requirements.  Both the Ninth and Seventh Circuits have stated that the government must meet the Roy general intent standard in order to make out a &quot;true threat.&quot;  Melugin v. Hames, 38 F.3d 1478, 1484 (9th Cir. 1994) (under Alaska statute AS 11.56.510(a)(1)); United States v. Khorrami, 895 F.2d 1186, 1193 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 986 (1990).  That the phrase &quot;true threat&quot; has been used to describe both the statutory intent requirement and the constitutional  &quot;unconditional, unequivocal, immediate and specific&quot; requirement does not imply that the two requirements are identical, or that any statement which meets the intent requirement may be prosecuted under  875(c) without running afoul of the First Amendment.  Typically, in the cases focussing on the intent requirement, there is no dispute that the statement satisfies the constitutional standard, and the defendant seeks dismissal or reversal of his conviction on the ground that he or she lacked the requisite intent.  See, e.g., United States v. Lincoln, 462 F.2d at 1369 (&quot;[a]pellant contends that the statute is violated only when a threat is uttered with a willful intent to carry it out.&quot;); United States v. Hoffman, 806 F.2d 703, 712 (7th Cir. 1986) (concluding that &quot;it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that Hoffman intended the letter as a serious expression of his intent to harm the President.&quot;) (quoted in Khorrami, 895 F.2d 1186).   
</p><p>
	Kelner's standard for a prosecution under 18 U.S.C.  875(c) is not only constitutionally required, but also is consistent with the statute's legislative history.  The law which was eventually codified as 18 U.S.C.  875(c) was first passed in 1932, Pub. L. No. 72-274 (1932), and criminalized use of the mail to transmit a threat to injure or kidnap any person (or to injure a person's property or reputation), or to accuse a person of a crime or demand ransom for a kidnapped person.  Id.  The communication had to be sent &quot;with intent to extort . . . money or any thing of value&quot; to fall under the act.  Id.  A motivating factor for passage of the 1932 act was the kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh's son, and the concomitant use of the mail to convey the kidnappers' threats and demands.  H.R. Rep. No. 602, 72d Congress, 1st Sess. (1932).
</p><p>
	The act was addressed to the constitutionally unproblematic case, like the Lindbergh case, identified in Kelner: &quot;where a communication has become 'so interlocked with violent conduct as to constitute for all practical purposes part of the [proscribed] action itself.'&quot;  Kelner, 534 F.2d at 1027.  The act was modified in 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-231 (1934), as increasingly sophisticated criminals had taken to using means other than the mail, such as the telephone and telegraph, to transmit their threats.  S. Rep. No. 1456, 73d Congress, 2d Sess. (1934).  As modified, it applied to threats transmitted &quot;by any means whatsoever,&quot; but still required extortionate intent.  Pub. L. No. 73-231 (1934).  In 1939 the act, Pub. L. No. 76-76 (1939), was expanded to apply to threats to kidnap or injure that were not made with extortionate intent.  Id.  The act's expansion was prompted by the recognition that many threats &quot;of a very serious and socially harmful nature&quot; were not covered by the existing law because &quot;the sender of the threat did not intend to extort money or other thing of value for himself.&quot;  H.R. Rep. No. 102, 76th Congress, 1st Sess. (1939).  An example of such a threat mentioned in the in the Report was one directed to a governor, threatening to blow up the governor's home if certain defendants in a criminal case were not released.  As modified, while an &quot;extortionate&quot; intent was no longer required, the act was still intended to address threats aimed at accomplishing some coercive purpose, such as the release of the defendants in the given example.  The modified statute still targets threats which, like the example, are unlikely to offend the constitutional standard articulated in Kelner.
</p><p>
	Threats aimed at achieving some coercive end remain the typical subject of more contemporary cases.  In Cox, for instance, the defendant's truck was repossessed while it contained items of his personal property.  The defendant telephoned the bank that had had the truck repossessed and stated &quot;I tell you what, you all better have my personal items to me by five o'clock today or it[']s going to be a lot of hurt people there.&quot;  Cox, 957 F.2d at 265.  The threat was designed to effect the return of the defendant's property, it targeted the people at the bank, and it was found not to be conditional (in part because his property could not have been returned by the five o'clock deadline).  It falls within Kelner's requirement of a threat that is &quot;so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific as to the person threatened, as to convey a gravity of purpose and imminent prospect of execution.&quot;  534 F.2d at 1027.   
</p><p>
	Similarly, in Schroeder, the defendant had sued the government for denial of employment preference under a veterans benefit program.  902 F.2d at 1470.  After losing his civil suits, the defendant called an Assistant United States Attorney and threatened to shoot people at a post office if he did not obtain satisfaction from the government; he stated that &quot;the government either gives [him] money or people would get hurt.&quot;  Id.  Schroeder involves an explicitly extortionate threat aimed at people in post offices.  Although the case appears to strain the constitutional standard, particularly with regard to the requirement of immediacy, the defendant did not raise a constitutional challenge on appeal.
</p><p>
	While coercive or extortionate threats are paradigmatic subjects of a prosecution under 18 U.S.C.  875(c), a threat which is neither coercive nor extortionate may still satisfy the constitutional test from Kelner; indeed, Kelner itself involved a non-coercive threat to assassinate the PLO leader Yasser Arafat. Kelner, 534 F.2d at 1025.  See also, DeAndino, 958 F.2d at 146 (regarding threat that defendant was going to &quot;blow [the victim's] brains out,&quot; and the victim was &quot;going to die.&quot;)  Nevertheless, a coercive or extortionate threat is particularly likely to be a constitutionally prosecutable &quot;true threat&quot; because it is particularly likely to be intimately bound up with proscribed activity.
</p><p>
	Another important factor in analyzing a threat under 18 U.S.C.  875(c) is the recipient of the communication in question.  As the Sixth Circuit stated in Lincoln (in the context of  871(a)), the statutory general intent element requires that &quot;a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of an intent to inflict bodily harm&quot; or kidnap a person.  462 F.2d at 1368.   Thus in Cox, the Sixth Circuit looked to the reaction of the recipient of the defendant's telephone call, as well as that of the person to whom the defendant asked to speak.   Cox, 957 F.2d at 266.  In Schroeder, the appropriate focus in considering the defendant's statements is how they would be interpreted by the Assistant United States Attorney who heard them, and by those to whom we could foreseeably relay them.  A statement which would not be interpreted by any foreseeable recipient as expressing a serious intention to injure or kidnap simply is not a threat under the statute.  While it is not necessary that the statement prosecuted under 18 U.S.C.  875(c) be communicated to the would-be target of the alleged threat, the statement must be evaluated in light of foreseeable recipients of the communication.
</p><p>
	Evaluating a statement charged under 18 U.S.C.  875(c) in light of its foreseeable recipients is consistent with the aims of the statute and the First Amendment.  In the case of a coercive or extortionate threat, the maker of the statement obviously cannot achieve his or her end if the recipient of the statement does not take it as expressing a serious intention to carry out the threatened acts.  If the coercive or extortionate threat is likely to be taken seriously by its recipient, then the threat is &quot;so interlocked with violent conduct as to constitute for all practical purposes part of the [proscribed] action itself.&quot;  Kelner, 534 F.2d at 1027.  A communication containing an alleged non-coercive threat may be regulated consonant with the First Amendment, under the analysis in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 120 L.Ed.2d 305, 321 (1992), in order to &quot;protect[] individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption that fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur.&quot;  If the alleged threat would not be interpreted by its foreseeable recipients as a serious expression of an intention to do the &quot;threatened&quot; acts, it does not implicate fear of violence or the disruption that fear engenders, and does not suggest a real possibility that the &quot;threatened&quot; violence will occur.  The statement thus would not be a &quot;true threat&quot; for the purposes of the First Amendment.
</p><p>
	Whether or not a prosecution under  875(c) encroaches on constitutionally protected speech is a question appropriately decided by the Court as a threshold matter.  In the context of the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C.  2381 et seq., which makes it a crime knowingly or willfully to advocate the overthrow or destruction of the United States government by force or violence, the Supreme Court has held that &quot;[w]hen facts are found that establish the violation of a statute, the protection against conviction afforded by the First Amendment is a matter of law&quot; requiring a judicial determination.  Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494, 513 (1951) (construing Act as codified at 18 U.S.C. (1946 ed.)  11, 54 Stat. 671).  In the context of  875(c), the Second Circuit has recognized that &quot;[m]ost cases are within a broad expanse of varying fact patterns which may not be resolved as a matter of law, but should be left to a jury,&quot; but has said that where the factual proof of a &quot;'true' threat&quot; is &quot;insufficient as a matter of law,&quot; the indictment is properly dismissed before reaching the jury.  United States v. Carrier, 672 F.2d 300, 306 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1139 (1982).  Although the government argues that &quot;whether a statement is a true threat is to be decided by the trier of fact,&quot; it recognizes that where &quot;the language set forth . . . is so facially insufficient that it cannot possibly amount to a true threat,&quot; the Court may properly dismiss the indictment.  Id.; accord Kosma, 951 F.2d at 555; United States v. Gilbert, 884 F.2d 454, 458 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1082 (1990); United States v. Howell, 719 F.2d 1258, 1260 (5th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1228 (1984); Lincoln, 589 F.2d at 382.  Whether the language set forth in the superseding indictment could possibly constitute a &quot;true threat&quot; must be determined in accord with Kelner's articulation of the constitutional requirement of a threat which on its face and in the circumstances in which it is made is so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific as to the person threatened, as to convey a gravity of purpose and imminent prospect of execution.
</p><p>
Kelner, 534 F.2d at 1027.  Whether or not Baker actually intended to carry out the actions described in the communications is irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry.

<h4>	IV. The Communications</h4>
<p>
	The government characterizes the e-mail dialogue between Gonda and Baker in December, 1994 as reflecting &quot;the evolution of their activity from shared fantasies to a firm plan of action.&quot;  The government's characterization of the ongoing dialogue suggests that at least some of the counts in the superseding indictment should be dismissed; messages constituting &quot;shared fantasies&quot; fall short of the Kelner standard of an unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific threat conveying an imminent prospect of execution and therefore are not &quot;true threats&quot; unprotected by the First Amendment.
</p><p>
	As the Court construes the law as discussed above, the constitutional standard enunciated in Kelner requires, at the very least, that a statement charged under  875(c) contain some language construable as a serious expression of an intent imminently to carry out some injurious act.  The language of the statement must be considered as it would be interpreted by the foreseeable recipients of the communication containing it.  Statements expressing musings, considerations of what it would be like to kidnap or injure someone, or desires to kidnap or injure someone, however unsavory, are not constitutionally actionable under  875(c) absent some expression of an intent to commit the injury or kidnapping.   In addition, while the statement need not identify a specific individual as its target, it must be sufficiently specific as to its potential target or targets to render the statement more than hypothetical.  
</p><p>
	Before addressing the specific language quoted in the indictment, several observations pertain to all of the government's charges.  First, all of the language for which Baker is charged was contained in private e-mail messages he sent to Gonda.  The messages were not available in any publicly accessible part of the Internet, and there is no allegation that they were ever distributed in any format, electronic or hardcopy, to anyone other than Gonda.  Nothing in these private messages suggests that they would be further distributed.  It is only as a result of this prosecution and the ensuing publicity that the content of the messages has been publicly aired.
</p><p>
	The focus of the inquiry here, therefore, is how a reasonable person would expect Gonda to interpret the e-mail messages.  Gonda's identity is entirely unknown; &quot;he&quot; could be a ten year old girl, an eighty year old man, or a committee in a retirement community playing the role of Gonda gathered around a computer.   All that is known about Gonda is that he used a computer account based in Ontario, Canada, and that he apparently enjoyed exchanging with Baker what he referred to in an e-mail message dated January 3, 1995, as &quot;REAL sex talk&quot; concerning violence against women and girls.  The language referred to by the government clearly does not constitute threats of a coercive or extortionate nature.  It would be patently unreasonable after reading his messages to think that Baker's communications caused their only foreseeable recipient, Gonda, to fear violence, or caused him any disruption due to fear of violence.  Of the grounds for prosecution of threats identified in R.A.V., the only one that could apply here is protection from the possibility that threatened violence will occur.  ___ U.S. at ___, 120 L.Ed.2d at 321. 
</p><p>
	The government characterizes the communications between Gonda and Baker as evolving into &quot;a firm plan of action.&quot;  Section 875(c), though, does not address planning crimes, per se, but transmitting threats to injure or kidnap.  At oral argument, the government agreed the exchange between Gonda and Baker could be characterized as an exchange between coconspirators.  In order to prove the existence of a conspiracy, generally, the government must prove an agreement between two or more people to act together in committing an offense, and also an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.  E.g., United States v. Reifsteck, 841 F.2d 701, 704 (6th Cir. 1988); 18 U.S.C.  371; Sixth Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions  3.01A, 3.04.  The charges here could not support a conspiracy prosecution because no overt act is alleged.  The only actions involved in this prosecution are speech--&quot;the outward expression of what a person thinks in his mind.&quot;  Vance v. Judas Priest, et al., 1990 WL 130920, *28 (Nev. Dist. Ct. 1990).  In an e-mail exchange not quoted in the superseding indictment,  Baker and Gonda discuss sharing their thoughts, a classically protected activity.  Baker had said to Gonda, in part: &quot;I'd love to meet with you.  There's no one else I can share my thoughts with.&quot;  On November 29, 1994, Gonda responded in part: &quot;I would really love to meet with you.  I find that I am going insane trying to keep all these thoughts to myself. . . maybe we could even try to pick up some chicks and share our thoughts with them. . . what do you think?&quot;
</p><p>
	Even if Gonda and Baker were conspiring, it does not follow that they are guilty of transmitting a threat to injure or kidnap under 18 U.S.C.  875(c).  Section 875(c) is not simply a conspiracy statute minus the overt act requirement.  In order to be constitutionally sanctionable, the statements Baker made must meet Kelner's &quot;unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific&quot; standard.  As Justice Brandeis wrote:
</p><blockquote>
	Fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free speech. . .  To justify suppression of free speech there must be reasonable ground to fear that serious evil will result if free speech is practiced.  There must be reasonable ground to believe that the danger apprehended is imminent.
Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 376 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring). 
</blockquote>
<h4>	A.</h4>
<p>	Count I charges Baker and Gonda with transmitting a threat to injure, and quotes from three e-mail messages.  In the first message quoted, dated December 1, 1994, Baker responds to a message he had received from Gonda:
</p><blockquote>
	I highly agree with the type of woman you like to hurt.  You seem to have the same tastes I have.  When you come down, this'll be fun!
<p>
<p>	Also, I've been thinking.  I want to do it to a really young girl first.  13 or 14.   There innocence makes them so much more fun --- and they'll be easier to control.  What do you think?  I haven't read your entire mail yet.  I've saved it to read later, in private.  I'll try to write another short phantasy and send it.  If not tomorrow, maybe by Monday.  No promises.
</blockquote>
<p>On December 2, Gonda responded:
</p>
<blockquote>	I would love to do a 13 or 14 year old.  I think you are right...not only their innocence but their young bodies would really be fun to hurt.  As far as being easier to control...you may be right, however you can control any bitch with rope and a gag...once tey are tieed up and struggling we could do anything we want to them...to any girl.  The trick is to be very careful in planning.  I will keep my eye out for young girls, and relish the fantasy...BTW  how about your neighbour at home, youm may get a chance to see her...?...?
</blockquote>
<p>
The same day, Baker responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>	True.  But young girls still turn me on more.  Likely to be nice and tight.  Oh.they'd scream nicely too!
</p>
<p>	Yeah. I didn't see her last time I was home.  She might have moved.  But she'd be a great catch.  She's real pretty.  with nice long legs. and a great girly face ... I'd love to make her cry ...
</p></blockquote>
The bill of particulars identifies the targets of these statements as:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>	13 and 14-year old girls who reside in Defendant Jake Baker's neighborhood in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and teen-age girls who reside in Defendant Jake Baker's neighborhood in Boardman, Ohio.
</blockquote>
<p>	This Count falls short of the constitutional &quot;true threat&quot; requirement.  As an initial matter, it does not refer to a sufficiently specific class of targets.  The more limited class identified in the bill of particulars is not apparent from the face of the communications.  Nothing in the exchange quoted in Count I implicitly or explicitly refers to 13 or 14 year old girls in Ann Arbor, nothing in the exchange identifies Boardman, Ohio (Baker's actual home) as the &quot;home&quot; referred to, and nothing in the exchange allows one to determine that the neighbor discussed is a teen-age girl.  In reality, the only class of people to whom the messages can be taken to refer is 13 or 14 year old girls, anywhere.  This class is too indeterminate to satisfy Kelner's requirement of specificity as to the person threatened, even under the liberal interpretation given the requirement by some courts.  Cf. Schroeder, 902 F.2d at 1470 (targeting people at an unidentified post office).
</p><p>
	As to the content of the messages, Baker's discussing his &quot;tastes&quot; in the first paragraph of his December 1 message does not involve any identifiable threatened action.  In the second paragraph of the December 1 message, he expresses a desire &quot;to do it to&quot; a 13 or 14 year old girl.  Even assuming that more context would clarify the phrase &quot;to do it to,&quot; the second paragraph also fails to mention an intention to do anything.  Rather, it seeks Gonda's reaction to Baker's desire, asking: &quot;What do you think?&quot;  Discussion of desires, alone, is not tantamount to threatening to act on those desires.  Absent such a threat to act, a statement is protected by the First Amendment.
</p><p>
	As to Baker's message of December 2, the first paragraph again discusses a predilection toward &quot;young girls,&quot; and what it would be like, presumably, &quot;to do it to&quot; &quot;young girls.&quot;  It does not mention any intention to act in accordance with the expressed predilection.  The second paragraph responds to Gonda's question about a neighbor &quot;at home.&quot;  It says &quot;she'd be a great catch,&quot; but expresses no intention to &quot;catch&quot; her, and indicates a desire to &quot;make her cry,&quot; but, again, expresses no intention to take any action in accordance with that desire.  It is not constitutionally permissible under Kelner to infer an intention to act on a desire from a simple expression of the desire.  The intention (whether or not actually held) must itself be expressed in the statement.  Count I fails to meet this standard, and must be dismissed.
</p>
<h4>	B.</h4>
<p>	Counts II and III are based on the same statement made by Baker in an e-mail message dated December 9, 1994, and charge Baker with making a threat to kidnap and a threat to injure, respectively.  The statement for which Baker is charged in the two counts reads:
</p><blockquote>
<p>	I just picked up Bllod Lust and have started to read it.  I'll look for &quot;Final Truth&quot; tomorrow (payday).  One of the things I've started doing is going back and re-reading earlier messages of yours.  Each time I do. they turn me on more and more.  I can't wait to see you in person.  I've been trying to think of secluded spots. but my knowledge of Ann Arbor is mostly limited to the campus.  I don't want any blood in my room, though I have come upon an excellent method to abduct a bitch ---
</p>
<p>	As I said before, my room is right across from the girl's bathroom.  Wait until late at night.  grab her when she goes to unlock the dorr.  Knock her unconscious. and put her into one of those portable lockers (forget the word for it). or even a duffle bag.  Then hurry her out to the car and take her away ... What do you think?
</p></blockquote>
The bill of particulars identifies the target of the statement as: &quot;Female college students who lived in Defendant Jake Baker's dormitory at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan.&quot;  Apart from concerns about equating Baker's online persona with his real person, the class of would-be targets here is identified with sufficient specificity.
</p><p>
	Presumably, the government offers this statement as a threat to carry out the &quot;method to abduct&quot; it describes.  Under Kelner, discussion of a method of kidnapping or injuring a person is not punishable unless the statement includes an unequivocal and specific expression of intention immediately to carry out the actions discussed.  Baker's e-mail message cannot reasonably be read as satisfying this standard.  As in Count I, the language with which Baker is charged here lacks any expression of an intention to act, and concludes with a request for Gonda's reaction: &quot;What do you think?&quot;  Discussing the commission of a crime is not tantamount to declaring an intention to commit the crime.  To find an expression of unequivocal intention in this language would require the drawing of an inference not grounded in any specific language of the statement and would exceed the bounds of the First Amendment.  Counts II and III must be dismissed.
</p>
<h4>	C.</h4>
<p>	Count IV charges Baker and Gonda with transmitting a threat to injure.  The Count is based on a message from Gonda to Baker, and Baker's response.  Both e-mail messages are dated December 10, 1994.  Gonda wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>	Hi Jake.  I have been out tonight and I can tell you that I am thinking more and more about 'doing' a girl.  I can picture it so well...and I can think of no better use for their flesh.  I HAVE to make a bitch suffer!
</p>
<p>	As far as the Teale-homolka killings, well I can think of no tastier crimes...BTW have you seen any pictures of the girls?  You have to see these cunts!  They must have been so much fun...please let me know any details that I cannot get here.  I would love to see what you think about it....
</p>
<p>	As far as the asian bitch story, there is only one possible ending....
</p></blockquote>
<p>Baker responded:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>	Are tastes are so similar.  it scares me :-)  When I lay down at night. all I think of before I sleep is how I'd torture a bitch I get my hands on.  I have some pretty vivid near dreams too.  I wish I could remember them when I get up.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The bill of particulars identifies the target of these statements as:
</p>
<blockquote>	<p>Women who were the subject of Defendant Jake Baker's E-mail transmissions and Internet postings, including -- but not limited to -- Jane Doe, whose true name is known to Defendant Jake Baker and this Honorable Court.
</blockquote></p>
<p>
	This Count presents the weakest of all the government's charges against Baker.  While the government identifies the class of targets here as women Baker discussed on the Internet, there is nothing in the language quoted here to so limit the class.  In addition, since Baker's e-mail often refers simply to &quot;a girl,&quot; a class composed of women Baker discussed in his e-mail and stories essentially is a class composed of any woman or girl about whom Baker has ever thought.  Such a class is obviously not sufficiently specific.
</p><p>
	With regard to the content of Baker's communication, Baker's statement here consists only of an expression of his thoughts before sleeping and of &quot;near dreams&quot; he cannot remember upon waking.  To infer an intention to act upon the thoughts and dreams from this language would stray far beyond the bounds of the First Amendment, and would amount to punishing Baker for his thoughts and desires.  Count IV must be dismissed.
</p>
<h4>	D.</h4>
<p>	Count V charges Baker and Gonda with transmitting a threat to injure.  It is based on an exchange between Gonda and Baker on December 11-12, 1994.  On December 11, Gonda wrote to Baker:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>	It's always a pleasure hearing back from you...I had a great orgasm today thinking of how you and I would torture this very very petite and cute south american girl in one of my classes...BTW speaking of torture, I have got this great full length picture of the Mahaffy girl Paul Bernardo killed, she is wearing this short skirt!
</p></blockquote>
<p>The same day, Baker responded:
</p>
<p><blockquote>	Just thinking about it anymore doesn't do the trick ... I need TO DO IT.
</blockquote></p>
<p>The next day, Gonda wrote:
</p>
<p><blockquote>	My feelings exactly!  We have to get together...I will give you more details as soon as I find out my situation...
</p></blockquote>
<p>Baker responded:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>	Alrighty then.  If not next week. or in January.  then definatly sometime in the Summer.  Pickings are better then too.  Although it's more crowded.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The bill of particulars identifies the target of these statements, as in Count IV, as:
</p><blockquote>
<p>
	Women who were the subject of Defendant Jake Baker's E-mail transmissions and Internet postings, including -- but not limited to -- Jane Doe, whose true name is known to Defendant Jake Baker and this Honorable Court.
</p></blockquote>
<p>	This Count, too, fails to meet Kelner's constitutional &quot;true threat&quot; standard.  The class of potential targets, as discussed with regard to Count IV, is far too vague.  As to the content of the communications, Baker indicates his &quot;need TO DO IT.&quot;  Like his earlier statements, this language indicates a desire to do something.  While use of the word &quot;need&quot; indicates a strong desire, it still falls short &quot;unequivocal, unconditional and specific expression of intention immediately to inflict injury,&quot;  Kelner, 534 F.2d at 1027; &quot;needs&quot; go unmet everyday.  Baker next indicates, at most, an intention to meet Gonda at some indefinite point in the future--in the next week, month, or several months later.  This statement does not express an unequivocal intention immediately to do anything.  Also, nothing in the language on which the Count is based indicates any intention to commit specific acts if Baker and Gonda ever were to meet.  Like the preceding four Counts, Count V fails to state a charge under  875(c) that can survive a First Amendment challenge, and must be dismissed.  This prosecution presents the rare case in which, in the government's words, &quot;the language set forth . . . is so facially insufficient that it cannot possibly amount to a true threat.&quot;
</p>
<h4>	V. Coda</h4>
<p>	This case in its initial stage generated a good deal of public interest.   Now that the case will be concluded by an order rather than by a jury verdict, it is important to assure the public that such a conclusion is not by fiat.  In United States v. Carrier, 672 F.2d 300, 306 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1139 (1982), while the Second Circuit said &quot;that whether words used are a true threat is generally best left to the triers of fact,&quot; it went on to say &quot;[o]nly where the factual proof is insufficient as a matter of law should the indictment be dismissed.&quot;  This is such a case.  The communications which form the basis of the superseding indictment, the many preceding and subsequent communications, the names of the witnesses and the general nature of their testimony, and the exhibits are all in the record.  All of this evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, leads to one inevitable conclusion: based on the applicable rules of law there is no case for a jury because the factual proof is insufficient as a matter of law.  The government's enthusiastic beginning petered out to a salvage effort once it recognized that the communication which so much alarmed the University of Michigan officials was only a rather savage and tasteless piece of fiction.  Why the government became involved in the matter is not really explained in the record.   	Baker is being prosecuted under 18 U.S.C.  875(c) for his use of words, implicating fundamental First Amendment concerns.  Baker's words were transmitted by means of the Internet, a relatively new communications medium that is itself currently the subject of much media attention.  The Internet makes it possible with unprecedented ease to achieve world-wide distribution of material, like Baker's story, posted to its public areas.  When used in such a fashion, the Internet may be likened to a newspaper with unlimited distribution and no locatable printing press--and with no supervising editorial control.  But Baker's e-mail messages, on which the superseding indictment is based, were not publicly published but privately sent to Gonda.  While new technology such as the Internet may complicate analysis and may sometimes require new or modified laws,  it does not in this instance qualitatively change the analysis under the statute or under the First Amendment.  Whatever Baker's faults, and he is to be faulted, he did not violate 18 U.S.C.  875(c).  The case would have been better handled as a disciplinary matter, as the University of Victoria proceeded in a similar situation,  despite whatever difficulties inhere in such a course.   What the Court said at the conclusion of oral argument bears repeating: &quot;[T]he Court is very skeptical, and about the best thing the government's got going for it at this moment is the sincerity of purpose exhibited by [the Assistant United States Attorneys prosecuting the case].  I am not sure that sincerity of purpose is either synonymous with a good case under the law, or even the exercise of good judgment.&quot;

<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Motivated by the discovery that athletes were leaders in the
student drug culture and concern that drug use increases the
risk of sportsrelated injury, petitioner school district
(District) adopted the Student Athlete Drug Policy (Policy),
which authorizes random urinalysis drug testing of students who
participate in its athletics programs.  Respondent Acton was
denied participation in his school's football program when he
and his parents (also respondents) refused to consent to the
testing.  They then filed this suit, seeking declaratory and
injunctive relief on the grounds that the Policy violated the
Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and the Oregon Constitution.
The District Court denied the claims, but the Court of Appeals
reversed, holding that the Policy violated both the Federal and
State Constitutions.
</p>
<h4>Held:
</h4>
<p>The Policy is constitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth
Amendments.  Pp. 5-19.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) State-compelled collection and testing of urine constitutes
a &quot;search&quot; under the Fourth Amendment.  Skinner v. Railway Labor
Executives' Assn., 489 U.S. 602, 617.  Where there was no clear
practice, either approving or disapproving the type of search at
issue, at the time the constitutional provision was enacted, the
&quot;reasonableness&quot; of a search is judged by balancing the
intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against
the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.  Pp. 5-7.
</p>
<p>(b) The first factor to be considered in determining
reasonableness is the nature of the privacy interest on which
the search intrudes.  Here, the subjects of the Policy are
children who have been committed to the temporary custody of the
State as schoolmaster; in that capacity, the State may exercise
a degree of supervision and control greater than it could
exercise over free adults.  The requirements that public school
children submit to physical examinations and be vaccinated
indicate that they have a lesser privacy expectation with regard
to medical examinations and procedures than the general
population.  Student athletes have even less of a legitimate
privacy expectation, for an element of communal undress is
inherent in athletic participation, and athletes are subject to
preseason physical exams and rules regulating their conduct.
Pp. 7-11.
</p>
<p>(c) The privacy interests compromised by the process of
obtaining urine samples under the Policy are negligible, since
the conditions of collection are nearly identical to those
typically encountered in public restrooms.  In addition, the
tests look only for standard drugs, not medical conditions, and
the results are released to a limited group.  Pp. 11-14.
</p>
<p>(d) The nature and immediacy of the governmental concern at
issue, and the efficacy of this means for meeting it, also favor
a finding of reasonableness.  The importance of deterring drug
use by all this Nation's schoolchildren cannot be doubted.
Moreover, the Policy is directed more narrowly to drug use by
athletes, where the risk of physical harm to the user and other
players is high.  The District Court's conclusion that the
District's concerns were immediate is not clearly erroneous, and
it is self-evident that a drug problem largely caused by
athletes, and of particular danger to athletes, is effectively
addressed by ensuring that athletes do not use drugs.  The
Fourth Amendment does not require that the &quot;least intrusive&quot;
search be conducted, so respondents' argument that the drug
testing could be based on suspicion of drug use, if true, would
not be fatal; and that alternative entails its own substantial
difficulties.  Pp. 14-18.

<blockquote>
</p>
<p>In proceedings on Robert O'Neal's federal habeas corpus petition
challenging his state-court convictions for murder and other
crimes, the Sixth Circuit assumed that O'Neal had established
constitutional &quot;trial&quot; error with regard to one of the jury
instructions, but disregarded that error on the ground that it
was &quot;harmless.&quot;  After setting forth the harmlessness standard
normally used by federal habeas courts-whether the error had a
&quot;substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining
the jury's verdict,&quot; see, e.g., Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S.
___, ___-the Sixth Circuit stated that the habeas petitioner
must bear the &quot;burden of establishing&quot; whether the error was
prejudicial under that standard.  As a practical matter, the
court's burden-of-proof statement apparently means that the
petitioner must lose if a reviewing judge is in grave doubt
about the effect on the jury of this kind of error, i.e., if, in
the judge's mind, the matter is so evenly balanced that he or
she feels in virtual equipoise as to the error's harmlessness.
</p>
<h4>Held:
</h4>
<p>When a federal habeas court finds a constitutional trial error
and is in grave doubt about whether the error had a &quot;substantial
and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's
verdict,&quot; the error is not harmless, and the petitioner must
win.  Pp. 3-12.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) The foregoing legal conclusion rests upon three
considerations.  First, it is supported by precedent.  See,
e.g., Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 764-765; Chapman
v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24.  Brecht, supra, at ___, and
Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 116, distinguished.  The
State's view that appellants' &quot;burden&quot; of showing &quot;prejudice&quot; in
civil cases applies to habeas proceedings fails to take into
account the stakes involved in a habeas proceeding.  Unlike the
civil cases cited by the State, the errors being considered by a
habeas court occurred in a criminal proceeding, and therefore,
although habeas is a civil proceeding, someone's custody, rather
than mere civil liability, is at stake.  Moreover, precedent
suggests that civil and criminal harmless-error standards do not
differ in their treatment of grave doubt as to the harmlessness
of errors affecting substantial rights.  Compare, e.g., Fed.
Rule Crim.  Proc.  52(a) with Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.  61.
Second, the Court's conclusion is consistent with the basic
purposes underlying the writ of habeas corpus.  A legal rule
requiring issuance of the writ will, at least often, avoid the
grievous wrong of holding a person in custody in violation of
the Constitution and will thereby both protect individuals from
unconstitutional convictions and help to guarantee the integrity
of the criminal process by assuring that trials are
fundamentally fair.  In contrast, although denying the writ in
cases of grave uncertainty would help protect the State's
interest in the finality of its judgments and would promote
federal-state comity, such a rule would also virtually guarantee
that many, in fact, would be wrongly imprisoned or executed, and
would tell judges who believe individuals are quite possibly
being held in unlawful custody that they cannot grant relief.
Third, the rule adopted herein has certain administrative
virtues: It is consistent with the way that courts have long-
treated important trial errors and avoids the need for judges to
read lengthy records to determine prejudice in every habeas
case.  These factors are not determinative, but offer a
practical caution against a rule that, in respect to precedent
and purpose, would run against the judicial grain.  Pp. 4-10.
</p>
<p>(b) Contrary to the State's argument, there is nothing in the
language of the habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C. 2254(a), that
tells a court to treat a violation as harmless when it is in
grave doubt about harmlessness.  Indeed, there is no significant
support for either side in any of the language of the relevant
statutes or Rules.  In these circumstances, the Court properly
undertakes the foregoing examination, looking first to the
considerations underlying its habeas jurisprudence, and then
determining whether the proposed rule will advance or inhibit
these considerations by weighing the marginal costs and benefits
of its application on collateral review.  See Brecht, supra, at
___.  Pp. 10-12.  
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<img src="../graphics/rbline.gif" width=95%><br>
<p>After 501(b) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 was amended
to prohibit a Member of Congress, federal officer, or other
Government employee from accepting an honorarium for making an
appearance or speech or writing an article, respondents-
including individual members of, and a union representing, a
class composed of all Executive Branch employees below grade GS-
16 who, but for 501(b), would receive honoraria-filed a suit
challenging the statute as an unconstitutional abridgment of
their freedom of speech.  The speeches and articles for which
respondents had received honoraria in the past concerned matters
such as religion, history, dance, and the environment; with few
exceptions, neither their subjects nor the persons or groups
paying for them had any connection with respondents' official
duties.  In granting respondents' motion for summary judgment,
the District Court held 501(b) unconstitutional insofar as it
applies to Executive Branch employees and enjoined the
Government from enforcing it against any such employee.  The
Court of Appeals affirmed, emphasizing, inter alia, that the
Government's failure as to many respondents to identify some
sort of nexus between the employee's job and either the
expression's subject matter or the payor's character undercut
its proffered concern about actual or apparent improprieties in
the receipt of honoraria.
</p>
<h4>Held:
</h4>
<p>Section 501(b) violates the First Amendment.  Pp. 9-26.  
</p>
<dl><dd>(a) The honoraria ban imposes the kind of burden that abridges 
speech under the First Amendment.  Where, as here, Government 
employees seek to exercise their right as citizens to comment 
on matters of public interest, and are not attempting simply to 
speak as employees upon personal matters, the Government must 
be able to satisfy a balancing test of the type set forth in 
Pickering v. Board of Ed.  of Township High School Dist., 391 
U.S. 563, 568, in order to maintain a statutory restriction on
the employees' speech.  See Civil Service Comm'n v. Letter 
Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 564.  However, because 501(b) 
constitutes a wholesale deterrent to a broad category of 
expression by a massive number of potential speakers, the 
Government's burden here is even greater than it was in 
Pickering and its progeny, which usually involved individual 
disciplinary actions taken in response to particular government
employees' actual speech.  Specifically, the Government must 
show that the interests of both potential audiences and a vast 
group of present and future employees in a broad range of 
present and future expression are outweighed by that 
expression's &quot;necessary impact on the actual operation&quot; of
the Government, Pickering, 391 U.S., at 571.  Although 501(b)
neither prohibits any speech nor discriminates among speakers
based on the content or viewpoint of their messages, its
prohibition on compensation unquestionably imposes a significant
burden on respondents' expressive activity by inducing them to
curtail their expression if they wish to continue their
employment.  Moreover, the ban imposes a far more significant
burden on them than on the relatively small group of lawmakers
whose past receipt of honoraria assertedly motivated its
enactment.  The large-scale disincentive to expression also
imposes a significant burden on the public's right to read and
hear what Government employees would otherwise have written and
said.  Pp. 9-15.
</p>
<dd>(b) The Government has failed to show how the interests it
asserts to justify 501(b) are served by applying the honoraria
ban to respondents.  United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S.
75, distinguished.  Although the asserted concern that federal
officers not misuse or appear to misuse power by accepting
compensation for their unofficial and nonpolitical writing and
speaking activities is undeniably powerful, the Government cites
no evidence of misconduct related to honoraria by the vast rank
and file of federal employees below Grade GS-16.  The limited
evidence of actual or apparent impropriety by Members of
Congress and high-level executives cannot justify extension of
the honoraria ban to that rank and file, an immense class of
workers with negligible power to confer favors on those who
might pay to hear them speak or to read their articles.
Moreover, while operational efficiency is undoubtedly a vital
governmental interest, several features of the text of the ban
and of the pertinent regulations cast serious doubt on the
Government's submission that Congress perceived honoraria as so
threatening to the efficiency of the entire federal service as
to render the ban a reasonable response to the threat.  First,
the total exemption of payments for &quot;any series of appearances,
speeches, or articles&quot; unrelated to the employee's official
duties or status from 505(3)'s definition of &quot;honorarium&quot;
undermines application of the ban to individual speeches and
articles with no nexus to Government employment.  Second, the
definition's limitation of &quot;honoraria&quot; to payments for
expressive activities, as opposed to other services that a
Government employee might perform in his or her spare time,
requires a justification far stronger than the mere speculation
about serious harms advanced by the Government.  Finally, the
regulations' exclusions from the coverage of the statutory terms
&quot;appearance, speech or article&quot; of a wide variety of
performances and writings that would normally appear to have no
nexus with an employee's job are more consistent with the
presumption that the federal work force consists of dedicated
and honorable civil servants than with the honoraria ban's
dubious application not merely to policymakers, whose loss of
honoraria was offset by a salary increase, but to all Executive
Branch employees below Grade GS-16.  Pp. 15-22.
</p>
<dd>(c) Insofar as the judgment below grants relief to senior
federal executives who are not parties to this case, it is
reversed as overinclusive.  However, in light of this Court's
obligation to avoid judicial legislation and its inability to
correctly identify the exact terms of any nexus requirement that
Congress would have adopted in a more limited honoraria ban, the
Court refuses to modify the remedy further by crafting such a
nexus requirement.  Pp. 23-25.

<title> American Civil Liberties Union Briefing Paper Number 6</title>
<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>

<h1> "ENGLISH ONLY"
</h1>
<img src="../graphics/bpline.gif">
<center><h2>From its inception, the United States<br>
 has been a multilingual nation.</h2></center>
<p>At the time of the nation's founding, it was commonplace to hear as many as
20 languages spoken in daily life, including Dutch, French, German and
numerous Native American languages.  Even the Articles of Confederation
were printed in German, as well as English.  During the 19th and early
20th centuries, the nation's linguistic diversity grew as successive waves
of Europeans immigrated to these shores and U.S. territory expanded to 
include Puerto Rico, Hawaii and the Phillipines.
</p>
<p>Just as languages other than English have always been a part of our 
history and culture, debate over establishing a national language dates 
back to the country's beginnings.  John Adams proposed to the Continental 
Congress in 1780 that an official academy be created to &quot;purify, 
develop, and dictate usage of,&quot; English.  His proposal was rejected as 
undemocratic and a threat to individual liberty.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, restrictive language laws have been enacted periodically
since the late 19th century, usually in response to new waves of
immigration.  These laws, in practice if not in intent, have punished
immigrants for their foreignness and violated their rights.
</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, again during a period of concern about new
immigration, a movement arose that seeks the establishment of English as
the nation's official language.  The &quot;English Only&quot; movement promotes the
enactment of legislation that restricts or prohibits the use of languages
other than English by government agencies and, in some cases, by private
businesses.  The movement has met with some success, &quot;English Only&quot; laws
having been passed in several states.  And, for the first time in the
nation's history, an English Language Amendment to the Constitution has
been proposed.
</p>
<p>The ACLU opposes &quot;English Only&quot; laws because they can abridge the rights
of individuals who are not proficient in English, and because they
perpetuate false stereotypes of immigrants and non-English speakers.  We
believe, further, that such laws are contrary to the spirit of tolerance
and diversity embodied in our Constitution.  An English Language Amendment
to the Constitution would transform that document from being a charter of
liberties and individual freedom into a charter of restrictions that 
limits, rather than protects, individual rights.
</p>
<p>Here are the ACLU's answers to some questions frequently posed by the
public about &quot;English Only&quot; issues.
</p>
<h3>Q: What is an &quot;English Only&quot; law?
</h3>
<p>A: &quot;English Only&quot; laws vary.  Some state statutes simply declare English as
the &quot;official&quot; language of the state.  Other state and local edicts limit
or bar government's provision of non-English language assistance and
services.  For example, some restrict bilingual education programs,
prohibit multilingual ballots, or forbid non-English government services
in general -- including such services as courtroom translation or
multilingual emergency police lines.
</p>
<h3>Q: Where have such laws been enacted?
</h3>
<p>A: Sixteen states have &quot;English Only&quot; laws, and many others are considering
such laws.  In some states, the laws were passed decades ago during
upsurges of nativism, but most were passed within the last few years.  The
&quot;English Only&quot; states are Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado,
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska,
North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.
</p>
<h3>Q: What are the consequences of &quot;English Only&quot; laws?
</h3>
<p>A: Some versions of the proposed English Language Amendment would void almost
all state and federal laws that require the government to provide services
in languages other than English.  The services affected would include:
health, education and social welfare services, job training, translation
assistance to crime victims and witnesses in court and administrative
proceedings; voting assistance and ballots, drivers' licensing exams, and
AIDS-prevention education.
</p>
<p>Passage of an &quot;English Only&quot; ordinance by Florida's Dade County in 1980,
barring public funding of activities that involved the use of languages
other than English, resulted in the cancellation of all multicultural
events and bilingual services, ranging from directional signs in the
public transit system to medical services at the county hospital.
</p>
<p>Where basic human needs are met by bilingual or multilingual services, the
consequences of their elimination could be dire.  For example, the
Washington Times reported in 1987 that a 911 emergency dispatcher was
able to save the life of a Salvadoran woman's baby son, who had stopped
breathing, by coaching the mother in Spanish over the telephone to
administer mouth-to-mouth and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation until the
paramedics arrived.
</p>
<h3>Q: Do &quot;English Only&quot; laws affect only government services and programs?
</h3>
<p>A: &quot;English Only&quot; laws apply primarily to government programs.  However, such
laws can also affect private businesses.  For example, several Southern
California cities have passed ordinances that forbid or restrict the use
of foreign languages on private business signs.
</p>
<p>Some &quot;English Only&quot; advocates have opposed a telephone company's use of
multilingual operators and multilingual directories, Federal
Communications Commission licensing of Spanish-language radio stations,
and bilingual menus at fast food restaurants.
</p>
<h3>Q: Who is affected by &quot;English Only&quot; laws?
</h3>
<p>A: &quot;English Only&quot; campaigns target primarily Latinos and Asians, who make up
the majority of recent immigrants.  Most language minority residents are
Spanish-speaking, a result of the sharp rise in immigration from Latin
America during the mid-1960s.
</p>
<p>While the overwhelming majority of U.S. residents -- 96 percent -- are
fluent, approximately ten million residents are not fluent in English,
according to the most recent census.
</p>
<h3>Q: How do &quot;English Only&quot; laws deprive people of their rights?
</h3>
<p>A: The ACLU believes that &quot;English Only&quot; laws are inconsistent with the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  For example, laws that
have the effect of eliminating courtroom translation severely jeopardize
the ability of people on trial to follow and comprehend the proceedings. 
&quot;English Only&quot; laws interfere with the right to vote by banning bilingual
ballots, or with a child's right to education by restricting bilingual
instruction.  Such laws also interfere with the right of workers to be 
free of discrimination in workplaces where employers have imposed &quot;speak
English only&quot; rules.
</p>
<p>In 1987, the ACLU adopted a national policy opposing &quot;English Only&quot; laws
or laws that would &quot;characterize English as the official language in the
United States...to the extent that [they] would mandate or encourage the
erosion&quot; of the rights of language minority persons.
</p>
<h3>Q: What kinds of language policies were adopted with regard to past
generations of immigrants?
</h3>
<p>A: Our nation was tolerant of linguistic diversity up until the late 1800s,
when an influx of Eastern and Southern Europeans, as well as Asians,
aroused nativist sentiments and prompted the enactment of restrictive
language laws.  A 1911 Federal Immigration Commission report falsely
argued that the &quot;old&quot; Scandinavian and German immigrants had assimilated
quickly, while the &quot;new&quot; Italian and Eastern European immigrants were
inferior to their predecessors, less willing to learn English, and more
prone to political subversion.
</p>
<p>In order to &quot;Americanize&quot; the immigrants and exclude people thought to be
of the lower classes and undesirable, English literacy requirements were
established for public employment, naturalization, immigration and
suffrage.  The New York State Constitution was amended to disfranchise
over one million Yiddish-speaking citizens.  The California Constitution
was similarly amended to disfranchise Chinese, who were seen as a threat
to the &quot;purity of the ballot box.&quot;
</p>
<p>Ironically, during the same period, the government sought to &quot;Americanize&quot;
Native American Indian children by taking them from their families and
forcing them to attend English-language boarding schools, where they were
punished for speaking their indigenous languages.
</p>
<p>The intense anti-German sentiment that accompanied the outbreak of World
War I prompted several states, where bilingual schools had been
commonplace, to enact extreme language laws.  For example, Nebraska passed
a law in 1919 prohibiting the use of any other language than English
through the eighth grade.  The Supreme Court subsequently declared the law
an unconstitutional violation of due process.
</p>
<p>Today, as in the past, &quot;English Only&quot; laws in the U.S. are founded on
false stereotypes of immigrant groups.  Such laws do not simply disparage
the immigrants' native languages but assault the rights of the people who
speak the languages.
</p>
<h3>Q: Why are bilingual ballots needed since citizenship is required to vote,
English literacy is required for citizenship, and political campaigns are
largely conducted in English?
</h3>
<p>A: Naturalization for U. S. citizenship does not require English literacy for
people over 50, and/or who have been in the U. S. for 20 years or more. 
Thus, there are many elderly immigrant citizens whose ability to read
English is limited, and who cannot exercise their right to vote without
bilingual ballots and other voter materials.  Moreover, bilingual campaign
materials and ballots foster a better informed electorate by increasing
the information available to people who lack English proficiency.
</p>
<h3>Q: Doesn't bilingual education slow immigrant children's learning of English,
in contrast to the &quot;sink or swim&quot; method that was used in the past?
</h3>
<p>A: The primary purpose of bilingual programs in elementary and secondary
schools, which use both English and a child's native language to teach all
subjects, is to develop proficiency in English and, thus, facilitate the
child's transition to all-English instruction.  Although debate about
this approach continues, the latest studies show that bilingual education
definitely enhances a child's ability to acquire the second language. 
Some studies even show that the more extensive the native language
instruction, the better students perform all around, and that the
bilingual method engenders a positive self-image and self-respect by
validating the child's native language and culture.
</p>
<p>The &quot;sink or swim&quot; experience of past immigrants left more of them
underwater than not.  In 1911, the U. S. Immigration Service found that 77
percent of Italian, 60 percent of Russian, and 51 percent of German
immigrant children were one or more grade levels behind in school
compared to 28 percent of American-born white children.  Moreover, those
immigrants who did manage to &quot;swim&quot; unaided in the past, when agricultural
and factory jobs were plentiful, might not do so well in today's
&quot;high-tech&quot; economy, with its more rigorous educational requirements.
</p>
<h3>Q: But won't &quot;English Only&quot; laws speed up the assimilation of today's
immigrants into our society and prevent their isolation?
</h3>
<p>A: In fact, contrary to what &quot;English Only&quot; advocates assume, the vast
majority of today's Asian and Latino immigrants are acquiring English
proficiency and assimilating as fast as did earlier generations of
Italian, Russian and German immigrants.  For example, research studies
show that over 95 percent of first generation Mexican Americans are
English proficient, and that more than 50 percent of second generation
Mexican Americans have lost their native tongue entirely.
</p>
<p>In addition, census data reveal that nearly 90 percent of Latinos five
years old or older speak English in their households. And 98 percent of
Latinos surveyed said they felt it is &quot;essential&quot; that their children
learn to read and write English &quot;perfectly .&quot; Unfortunately, not enough
educational resources are available for immigrants -- over 40,000 are on
the waiting list for over-enrolled adult English classes in Los Angeles. 
&quot;English Only&quot; laws do not increase resources to meet these needs.
</p>
<p>The best insurance against social isolation of those who immigrate to our
nation is acceptance -- and celebration -- of the differences that exist
within our ethnically diverse citizenry.  The bond that unites our nation
is not linguistic or ethnic homogeneity but a shared commitment to 
democracy, liberty, and equality.

<br>
<blockquote>
<p>     Under Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), 49
Stat. 627, as amended, 42 U.S.C. section 601 et seq., the Federal
Government partially reimburses States for welfare programs that
either comply with all federal prescriptions or receive a waiver
from the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). 42 U.S.C.
section 1315. California seeks to change its AFDC program by
limiting new residents, for the first year they live in
California, to the benefits paid in the State from which they
came. See Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code Ann. section 11450.09 (West
Supp. 1994). Green and other new residents who receive AFDC
benefits challenged the constitutionality of this California in a 
federal court action; they maintain that the payment differential
between new and long-term residents burdens interstate migration
and thus violates the right to travel recognized in Shapiro v.
Thompson, 394 U.S. 618 (1969), and its progeny. The United States
District Court for the Eastern District of California enjoined
the payment differential, Green v. Anderson, 811 F. Supp. 516,
523 (1993), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit affirmed. Green v. Anderson, 26 F. 3d 95 (1994). We
granted California's petition for certiorari. 513 U.S. ___
(1994). We now find, however, that no justiciable controversy is
before us, because the case in its current posture is not ripe.
</p>
<p>     The California statute provides that the payment
differential shall not take effect absent receipt by the State of
an HHS waiver. See Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code Ann. section
11450.03(b) (West Supp. 1994). HHS originally granted a waiver,
which was in effect when the District Court and Court of Appeals
ruled. But &quot;ripeness is peculiarly a question of timing,&quot; and &quot;it
is the situation now rather than the situation at the time of the
[decision under review] that must govern.&quot; Regional Rail
Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 140 (1974). After the
Court of Appeals ruled in this case, it vacated the HHS waiver in
a separate proceeding, concluding that the Secretary had not
adequately considered objections to California's program. Beno v.
Shalala, 30 F. 3d 1057, 1073-1076 (CA9 1994). The Secretary did
not seek this Court's review of the Beno decision. California
acknowledges that even if it prevails here, the payment
differential will not take effect. Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-6. Absent
favorable action by HHS on a renewed application for a waiver,
California will continue to treat Green and others similarly
situated the same way it treats long-term California residents.
The parties have no live dispute now, and whether one will arise
in the future is conjectural. See Hall v. Beale, 396 U.S. 45
(1989) (per curiam) (after this Court noted probable
jurisdiction, Colorado legislature reduced to two months
challenged six-month residency requirement for voting in
presidential elections; revival of controversy consequently
because too speculative to warrant Court's passing on substantive
issues).
</p>
<p>     In view of the impediment to dispositive adjudication, we
direct the vacation of prior judgments in this case. As we
explained earlier this Term, in deciding whether to disturb prior
judgments in a case rendered nonjusticiable, we have inquired,
pivotally, &quot;whether the party seeking relief from the judgment
below caused the [nonjusticiability] by voluntary action.&quot; U.S.
Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 515 U.S. ___
(1994) (slip op., at 7). Unlike settlement, see ibid, or a losing
party's decision to forgo appeal, see Korcher v. May, 484 U.S.
72, 88 (1987), California's loss of the federal approval
necessary to implement its program was not voluntary. Vacatur is
appropriate, therefore, to &quot;clea[r] the path for future
relitigation of the issues between parties and [to] eliminat[e] a
judgment, review of which was prevented through happenstance.&quot;
United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 86, 40 (1950).
</p>
<p>    Accordingly, the judgment of the United States Court of
Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded to that court with
directions to order the vacation of the District Court's judgment
and the dismissal of the case.
</p>
<p>It is so ordered.

<h3>                      PRELIMINARY STATEMENT</h3>
</center><P>
<pre>
     1. This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief
challenging provisions of the "Communications Decency Act of
1996" (the challenged provisions are referred to hereinafter as
"the Act").  One provision imposes criminal penalties for
"indecent" but constitutionally protected telecommunications to
individuals under the age of 18; another criminalizes the use of
any "interactive computer service" to "send" or "display in a
manner available" to a person under 18 any communication that
"depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities
or organs."  The plaintiffs, providers of and users of computer
communication systems, assert that the Act is unconstitutional on
its face and as applied because it criminalizes expression that
is protected by the First Amendment; it is also impermissibly
overbroad and vague; and it is not the least restrictive means of
accomplishing any compelling governmental purpose.

     2.  In addition, plaintiffs assert that the Act violates the
constitutional right to privacy encompassed in the First, Fourth,
Fifth, and Ninth Amendments because it criminalizes private
"e-mail" computer correspondence to or among individuals under
the age of 18 if the correspondence is deemed "patently
offensive" or "indecent."

     3.  Plaintiffs further assert that the Act in effect
prohibits the right to anonymous speech, guaranteed by the First
Amendment, for vast portions of the computer networks.

     4.  Finally, plaintiffs American Civil Liberties Union,
Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., and others also
assert that 18 U.S.C.  1462(c), both before and after amendment,
is unconstitutional on its face because it violates the First
Amendment by criminalizing the distribution or reception of any
information via "any express company or other common carrier, or
interactive computer service" of "information . . . where, how,
or of whom, or by what means any" "drug, medicine, article, or
thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion . . .
may be obtained or made."

                      JURISDICTION AND VENUE

                              FACTS

Enactment of "Indecency" Standard for Cyberspace Communications

28.  In February, 1996, Congress adopted and the President
signed the Act.  In relevant part, the Act provides:
     "Section 502.  Obscene or Harassing Use of
     Telecommunications Facilities Under the Communications
     Act of 1934.

     Section 223 (47 U.S.C. 223) is amended--          (1) by striking subsection (a) and inserting in     lieu thereof:     (a) Whoever --          "(1) in interstate or foreign communications ...

          "(B) by means of a telecommunications device
     knowingly --
               "(I) makes, creates, or solicits, and
               "(ii) initiates the transmission of,

          any comment, request, suggestion, proposal,
          image, or other communication which is
          obscene or indecent knowing that the
          recipient of the communication is under 18
          years of age regardless of whether the maker
          of such communication placed the call or
          initiated the communication; ...

     (2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility under
   his control to be used for any activity prohibited by
paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used for such
activity,

     shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or
     imprisoned not more than two years, or both."

(emphasis added)  This provision appears in the United States

Code as 47 U.S.C.  223(a)(1)(B) (hereinafter the "indecency"
provision).

     29.  Subsection (h)(1) of  502(2) of the Act provides that
"the use of the term  telecommunications device' in this section
     (A) shall not impose new obligations on broadcasting
     station licensees and cable operators covered by
     obscenity and indecency provisions elsewhere in this
     Act; and

     (B) does not include the use of an interactive computer
     service."

Because "interactive computer service" is defined broadly in the
Act (see below), the definition of "telecommunications device" to
exclude any "interactive computer service" leaves entirely
uncertain the meaning and scope of the statutory prohibitions for
computer communications.

     30.  Section 502(2) of the Act adds to 47 U.S.C.  223, in
pertinent part:
          "(d) Whoever --
          (1) in interstate or foreign communications
     knowingly

          (A) uses an interactive computer service to send
     to a specific person or persons under 18 years of age,
     or

          (B) uses any interactive computer service to
     display in a manner available to a person under 18
     years of age,

          any comment, request, suggestion, proposal,
          image, or other communication that, in
          context, depicts or describes, in terms
          patently offensive as measured by
          contemporary community standards, sexual or
          excretory activities or organs, regardless of
          whether the user of such service placed the
          call or initiated the communication; or

          (2) knowingly permits any telecommunications
     facility under such person's control to be used for an
     activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent
     that it be used for such activity,

     shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or
     imprisoned not more than two years, or both."
(emphasis added).  This provision appears in the United States
Code as 47 U.S.C.  223(d)(1)(hereinafter the "patently offensive"
provision).

     31.  Subsection (h)(2) of  502(2) of the Act provides that
"[t]he term `interactive computer service' has the meaning
provided in section 230(f)(2)."  Section 230(f)(2) defines
"interactive computer service" to mean
     "any information service, system, or access software
     provider that provides or enables computer access by
     multiple users to a computer server, including
     specifically a service or system that provides access
     to the Internet and such systems operated or service
     offered by libraries or educational institutions."

     32.  The provisions described in this section became
effective immediately upon passage of the Act.

     33.  No definition is given in the Act for the term
"indecent."  The Federal Communications Commission, however, has
interpreted the prohibition of "indecent" radio and television
broadcasts under 18 U.S.C.  1464 to cover communications that
"depict or describe, in terms patently offensive as measured by
contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual
or excretory activities or organs."  The Commission has ruled
that this definition includes the use of common Anglo-Saxon
street terms for sexual or excretory functions, as well as sexual
innuendos and double entendres.  In addition, the Commission has
ruled that communications with substantial literary, artistic,
political, scientific, or other educational or social value, may
be "patently offensive" or "indecent."

     34.  The Act contains two provisions that appear to
establish partial defenses to criminal liability.  Section 502
adds to 47 U.S.C.  223 a new subsection (e), which provides that
"[i]n addition to any other defenses available by law:
     (1)  No person shall be held to have violated
     subsection (a) or (d) solely for providing access or
     connection to or from a facility, system, or network
     not under that person's control, including
     transmission, downloading, intermediate storage, access
     software, or other related capabilities that are
     incidental to providing such access or connection that
     does not include the creation of the content of the
     communication."
Various exceptions to this defense are set out in subsections
(e)(2), (3), and (4), for conspiracies, co-ownership situations,
and employer liability.

     35.  In addition, new 223 U.S.C.  223(e)(5) provides a
defense for any person who
     "(A) has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective,
     and appropriate actions under the circumstances to
     restrict or prevent access by minors to a communication
     specified in such subsections, which may involve any
     appropriate measures to restrict minors from such
     communications, including any method which is feasible
     under available technology; or

     (B) has restricted access to such communication by
     requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account,
     adult access code, or adult personal identification
     number."
New  223(e)(6) permits the Federal Communications Commission to
"describe measures which are reasonable, effective, and
appropriate to restrict access to prohibited communications under
subsection (d)," but does not authorize the Commission to enforce
the Act or approve such measures.

     36.  Section 509 of the Act may provide a different defense
to liability.  Section 509 adds a new section,  230, to Title 47
of the United States Code.  Section 230(c)(1) provides:
     "No provider or user of an interactive computer service
     shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any
     information provided by another information content
     provider."
This section appears to conflict with new 47 U.S.C.  223(e),
which only provides a defense if a "facility, system, or network"
on which "indecent" or "patently offensive" material appears is
not under the "control" of the person who provides access.

     37.  Before passing this Act, Congress made no findings
about alternative, less restrictive means of accomplishing the
goals of the Act.

The Nature of the Online Medium

     38.  Online services use computers, phone lines, and modems
to connect users to networks that allow them to communicate with
thousands of other users throughout the world, and to access
extensive information databases from a variety of sources.  Most
online services offer a package of services that can include:
electronic mail to transmit private messages to one or a group of
users or to an established mailing list on a particular topic;
chat rooms that allow simultaneous online discussions; discussion
groups in which users post messages and reply to online "bulletin
boards"; informational databases; and access to the Internet.

     39.  Textual, audio, and video files can all be exchanged
through computer communications networks if the user has the
right computer hardware and software.

     40.  The Internet is the largest online network in the
world.  It links a large number of smaller networks set up by
universities, industry, nonprofit organizations, and government.
While estimates can only be approximations due to rapid growth,
the Internet is believed to connect at least 59,000 computer
networks, 2.2 million computers, 159 countries, and 40 million
users.  The Internet has no centralized distribution point.

     41.  Many users are connected to the Internet through an
Internet Service Provider (ISP).  ISPs provide connections,
software, and tools for using the Internet.  Like the large
commercial online services, ISPs also often host online
discussion groups and chat rooms that are housed and maintained
through the ISP's computers.

     42.  Some businesses and institutions have a direct
connection to the Internet, which means they are part of the vast
network of computers that comprise the Internet.  Many
universities in the United States are directly connected to the
Internet and provide accounts on their participating computer to
students, faculty, and staff.

     43.  Some online services provide content as well as access
to computer networks.  That is, in addition to providing the
technical ability to subscribers to send and receive information
and messages, some online services create their own information
databases.

     44.  Electronic mail, or e-mail, is the most basic online
communication.  Users are given a personal e-mail address that
allows them to exchange messages or files with other persons and
organizations that have Internet e-mail addresses.

     45.  "Gopher" is a popular way to create and access
databased information on the Internet.  Gopher is a menu-driven
program that allows the user to "gopher" through multiple layers
of menus to search for information on a particular topic.  A
"gopher site" is a database that provides content associated with
a particular person or organization.  As a reference service,
gopher sites often include links to related gopher sites that are
associated with other organizations or persons.

     46.  The "World Wide Web" (Web) is a popular way to create
and access databased information on the Internet.  The World Wide
Web contains sophisticated graphics and audio files in addition
to text files.  Web sites are databases that provide content
associated with a particular person or organization; they allow
users to link instantly to other documents and Web sites by
clicking on highlighted words in the text of the document being
viewed.

     47.  "Online discussion groups" are hosted by online
services or by particular networks connected to the Internet.
The host sets up a section on the network devoted to the
discussion of a particular issue and any other online user with
access to the host network can post messages on the topic by
sending an e-mail message to the discussion group.  Users can
also post responses to particular messages.

     48.  "Online mailing lists," or "listservs" are e-mail
distribution lists.  Internet users subscribe to online mailing
lists by sending messages from their own e-mail addresses.  Any
subscriber can then send a message that is distributed to all the
other subscribers on the list.

     49.  "Chat rooms" are sections provided by online services
and some computer bulletin board systems in which online users
can engage in simultaneous live interactive online discussion.

     50.  Online discussion groups, chat rooms, and online
mailing lists are sometimes moderated by someone not necessarily
connected with the online service provider.  Many of these
"moderators" are volunteers who simply are interested in a
particular topic.  The moderators review incoming messages before
they are posted to determine whether the messages are related to
the subject matter of the group or conform to other standards set
up by the moderator.

     51.  "Computer bulletin board systems" (BBSs) are online
networks that are independent of the Internet and that usually
cater to people interested in specialized subject matter or to
people from a particular geographic region.  Subscribers dial
directly from their computers into the BBS host computer.  BBSs
often offer e-mail services among users, online discussion
groups, and information databases.

     52.  A user with access to the Internet may use most gopher
sites and Web sites without providing further identification or
paying an additional fee.  A user with access to newsgroups,
online discussion groups, online mailing lists, and chat rooms
may generally use particular services without providing further
identification or paying an additional fee.

     53.  "Cyberspace" refers to the combination of all of the
online communications systems described above.

     54.  Nobody owns cyberspace, and the ability of anyone to
control what goes into or through online networks varies widely
depending on the nature of the system.  Anyone can purchase the
necessary equipment to get online or to create her own web page.

     55.  Users of online systems are also content providers
(that is, they are publishers), because they can transmit and
distribute their own communications and can create a permanent
archive of information accessible by other users.  There is no
limit to the number of people on either side of the sending or
receiving end of computer communications.

     56.  Online communications are interactive.  This means, in
part, that users of online systems must seek out with specificity
the information they wish to retrieve and the kinds of
communications they wish to engage in.  It also means that users
can easily respond to the material they receive or view online.

     57.  Online systems provide users with a multitude of
options for controlling and limiting, if desired, the kinds of
information they access through online networks.  Commercial
online services like American Online, Prodigy, and CompuServe
provide features to prevent children from accessing chat rooms
and to block access to some kinds of newsgroups based on
keywords, subject matter, or specific newsgroup.  They also offer
screening software that automatically blocks messages containing
certain words, and tracking and monitoring software to determine
which resources a particular online user (e.g., a child) has
accessed.  They also offer children-only discussion groups that
are closely monitored by adults.

     58.  Online users can also purchase special software
applications to control access to online resources.  These
applications allow users to block access to certain resources, to
prevent children from giving personal information to strangers by
e-mail or in chat rooms, and to keep a log of all online activity
that occurs on the home computer.

     59.  Once information is posted to an international online
network like the Internet, it is not possible to allow only
residents of a particular region or country to access that
information; the information becomes available to anyone in the
world who has access to the online network.  There is currently
no technological method for determining with specificity the
geographic location from which users access or post to online
systems.

     60.  Online users are given a password and user name which
they must use in order to sign onto their online service.  While
some users use their full proper name as their online user name,
many users have online names that are pseudonyms.  These users
therefore may send, view, and receive online communications
anonymously.

     61.  There are forums for both "public" and "private"
communications in cyberspace.  E-mail and online mailing lists
are private communications between specified persons or group of
persons.  Only the intended recipients of an e-mail message
receive the message; in this sense e-mail is like regular mail.
Similarly, only subscribers to an online mailing list should
receive the messages posted to that mailing list.  Web sites,
gopher sites, online discussion groups, and chat rooms, by
contrast, are public because anyone with online access can access
them or participate in them at any time.  These forums are the
public libraries and public squares of cyberspace.


Relationship of the Plaintiffs To the Act

American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)

     62.  In addition to its legal advocacy to uphold the Bill of
Rights, plaintiff ACLU has long devoted considerable resources to
public education about civil liberties.  Since 1993, the ACLU's
public education efforts have included extensive online resources
that offer electronic copies of ACLU publications, reports, court
briefs, news releases, and other material related to the ACLU's
legal, legislative, educational and advocacy work.

     63.  The ACLU maintains its extensive online resources
through America Online and the Internet's World Wide Web.  Many
of the ACLU's online databases contain material of social value
that contains sexual subject matter or vulgar language.  Examples
include copies of ACLU court briefs in cases involving obscenity,
arts censorship, and discrimination against gays and lesbians.
Indeed, the ACLU has posted the text of the "seven dirty words"
comic monologue which the Supreme Court ruled "indecent" in the
1978 Pacifica case, and which the Court itself reproduced as an
appendix to its opinion.

     64.  The ACLU also hosts unmoderated online discussion
groups that allow citizens to discuss and debate a variety of
civil liberties issues.  These services allow online users to
express their uncensored views on civil liberties issues and to
interact with ACLU staff or featured speakers.  Many of the
communications in the ACLU's discussion groups have sexual
content or vulgar language; for example, a discussion of
masturbation in the context of the firing of former Surgeon
General Jocelyn Elders; the content of Howard Stern's
best-selling book, Private Parts; a discussion of why the word
"fuck" has such expressive power; and a discussion of the defense
of pornography and other erotic expression under the First
Amendment.

     65.  The ACLU does not moderate its interactive services
because such editing or censorship would be antithetical to the
ACLU's belief in freedom of speech.  Furthermore, the ACLU
considers minors to be an important audience for its online
resources.  The ability of minors to participate in chat rooms or
discussion groups with other minors and with adults is a vital
part of their education.  It is particularly important that
minors be able to access information about their rights and to
learn about and debate controversial issues.  Thus, for the
reasons discussed in this Complaint, the ACLU does not currently
intend to self-censor any of its online communications as a
result of the Act.

     66.  The ACLU's web site is hosted by a private company that
has expressed concern about the material on the ACLU's site for
fear that it would be held liable under the Act.  The company has
not yet decided what action, if any, to take as a result of this
concern.

     67.  In addition to its own online resources, ACLU staff and
members use other online services such as e-mail, outside
discussion groups, and online mailing lists as an important
low-cost method of communicating and sharing documents and
information with each other and with those outside of the ACLU.
Some of this material is also sexually explicit or contains
vulgar language or descriptions of the human body or human
reproduction.

     68.  Through its online resources, the ACLU distributes
information to and receives information from its affiliates,
clients, members, and the public, regarding how women can obtain
abortions or abortifacient drugs or devices, and when doctors can
perform abortions, including how to contact specific abortion
providers, who performs specific abortion procedures, where to
obtain specific abortifacient drugs and devices, when specific
abortion procedures may be used, and the legal restrictions on
obtaining and performing abortions in different states.

     69.  The ACLU also mails out information to and receives
information through the mails from its affiliates, clients,
members, and the public, regarding how women can obtain abortions
or abortifacient drugs and devices, and when doctors can perform
abortions, including how to contact specific abortion providers,
who performs specific abortion procedures, where to obtain
specific abortifacient drugs and devices, when specific abortion
procedures may be used, and the legal restrictions on obtaining
and performing abortions in different states.

     70.  The ACLU also gives out and receives information over
the telephone and via FAX from its affiliates, clients, members,
and the public, regarding how women can obtain abortions or
abortifacient drugs and devices, and when doctors can perform
abortions, including how to contact specific abortion providers,
who performs specific abortion procedures, where to obtain
specific abortifacient drugs and devices, when specific abortion
procedures may be used, and the legal restrictions on obtaining
and performing abortions in different states.

Human Rights Watch (HRW)

     71.  Plaintiff HRW uses online services to communicate with
human rights activists and others in the field and to distribute
its human rights reports worldwide through a gopher site on the
Internet.  HRW's online resources include testimony from victims
of forced trafficking in prostitution in Thailand and India,
reports on systematic rape in Bosnia, and reports of sexual abuse
of female prisoners in the United States.  These and other
reports contain graphic language and subject matter.  In the view
of HRW, online communication is a powerful new way for human
rights activists, dissidents and others to communicate and
organize away from the watchful eyes of oppressive governments.

     72.  For example, a July 1995 report on slavery in Pakistan
detailed tortures that are used to intimidate bonded laborers.
That report discusses tortures that include beating of the
genitals and rape.

     73.  HRW believes that the use of graphic language and
descriptions is necessary to convey the true horror of human
rights abuse.  Removal of material considered "indecent" or
"patently offensive" from direct victim testimony in HRW's human
rights reports would greatly diminish its effectiveness in
advocating for an end to human rights abuses.

     74.  HRW believes that minors as well as adults are
interested in its online information, and that it is important
for the success of the human rights movement that minors have
access to this information.  Thus, for the reasons discussed in
this Complaint, HRW currently does not intend to self-censor any
of its online communications as a result of the Act.

Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC)

     75.  EPIC maintains its public online resources through a
site on the web and through an online mailing list to which any
person with an Internet electronic mail address may subscribe.
On average, 500 people visit the Web site each day.

     76.  EPIC's electronic resources include materials
concerning free speech, censorship, and privacy issues.  Because
of the nature of these issues, some of the materials necessarily
use sexually explicit speech or vulgar language.  For example,
the EPIC web site contains the text of the Supreme Court's
opinions in FCC v. Pacific Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), and
Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), both of which contain
common four letter words.

     77.  EPIC's web site also contains the text of poems written
by subscribers of America Online and removed from that system by
America Online management on the grounds that they contain
"vulgar or sexually oriented language."  EPIC makes such
information available in order to illustrate the potential
effects of attempts to regulate online speech and expression.

     78.  EPIC believes minors to be an important audience for
its online resources.  EPIC staff frequently receive inquiries
from high school students seeking information for research
projects.  EPIC staff refer these students to EPIC's web site as
a potential source of relevant information.

     79.  Thus, for the reasons discussed in this Complaint, EPIC
does not currently intend to self-censor its online
communications as a result of the Act.

Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)

     80.  Since its inception in 1990, EFF has devoted
considerable resources to educating the public about civil
liberties and legal issues as they arise in cyberspace.
Throughout EFF's existence, it has initiated and/or moderated
several online forums, including a forum on the WELL (a
California-based conferencing system and Internet Service
Provider), on Usenet (two online discussion groups or
"newsgroups") and on America OnLine.  EFF also has its own
computer site on the Internet.

     81.  EFF's public education efforts include the maintaining
of extensive online resources both on forums it runs with online
service providers, and on its own Internet site.  These resources
include articles, court cases, legal papers, news releases,
newsletters, and excerpts from public discussions related to the
EFF's legal, legislative, educational, and advocacy work.  EFF
also publishes a "home page" on the web which is accessible to
anyone with a user account on another site on the global
Internet, as well as anyone who uses an online service provider
that includes a "Web browser" among its services.

     82.  EFF also maintains eight online mailing lists, both for
specific civil-liberties and activist activities, and for
informing the public about its activities.  The primary mailing
list has a subscriber base of approximately 7,500 individuals.

     83.  EFF's web page normally receives between 70,000 to
80,000 hits per day (a hit is an instance of individual access).
The site normally transmits the equivalent of 120 million to 140
million words per day.

     84.  Since virtually all interactions on the Internet or
other computer networks have a significant communicative element
to them, EFF's policy positions and the discussion forums it
sponsors strongly emphasize freedom-of-speech concerns, including
concerns about the contours of obscenity law and liability and
about the scope of the Federal Communications Commission's
jurisdiction to regulate so-called "indecency."  In discussing
what the Supreme Court, in the absence of a definition of
indecency, might consider to be indecent, EFF must refer in
detail to such texts as the George Carlin comedy monologue that
was the subject of the litigation in FCC v. Pacifica, to the
transcripts of Howard Stern broadcasts, and to literary works
such as those of Allen Ginsberg and James Joyce.  EFF's web site
also provides "links" that enable users to visit other sites that
contain discussions and examples of "indecent" material.

     85.  EFF believes it is important for minors to be able to
educate themselves about the legal and constitutional structures
that frame freedom of speech online.  Some EFF members are
minors.  This Act would radically restrict access by EFF members
who are minors to constitutionally protected material that they
could legally be given in a library or bookstore.

     86.  Thus, for the reasons discussed in this Complaint, EFF
does not currently intend to self-censor its online
communications as a result of the Act.

     87.  Nearly all of EFF's approximately 3,500 members use
online communications.  EFF members both receive and transmit
information through a variety of online communications.  EFF
members do not wish to be required to self-censor "indecent"
speech in order to avoid prosecution.

Journalism Education Association (JEA)

     88.  JEA is one of the largest national organizations of
high school journalism teachers and publication advisors.  It has
almost 1,600 members.  JEA members increasingly use online
communications as part of instruction in high school journalism
classes or as part of teaching research methods for students who
write for school publications.

     89.  JEA believes that access to online communications is
essential for the education of high school students.

     90.  JEA members attempt to give students the skills to
enable them to engage in independent online research.  When
students do online research directed or supervised by JEA
members, but on computers that are not at the school or that are
at the school but not being operated by a teacher, it is not
possible for JEA members to ensure that students do not access
material that might come within the definition of the Act.

     91.  Many high school students are sufficiently mature to be
able to handle material that some might consider "indecent" or
"patently offensive."  Thus, it might not only be acceptable but
also important for some students, under the supervision of JEA
members, to access information about, for example, war crimes in
Bosnia which might include graphic descriptions of rape.

     92.  If the Act goes into effect, JEA members fear they will
be prosecuted if they fail to censor material that some people
believe should be censored under the Act.

     93.  Section 223(f)(1) provides that "[n]o cause of action
may be brought in any court or administrative agency against any
person on account of activity that is not in violation of any law
punishable by criminal or civil penalty, and that the person has
taken in good faith to implement a defense authorized under this
section or otherwise to restrict or prevent the transmission of,
or access to, a communication specified in this section."

     94.  JEA members do not know if this section would protect
them from liability for violation of First Amendment rights if
they unnecessarily restricted access to important protected
speech not covered by the Act.

     95.  JEA also sues on behalf of their minor students.  The
students wish to retain their right to access constitutionally
protected information and ideas.

Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)

     96.  CPSR, a nonprofit organization of computer
professionals,  maintains a site on the World Wide Web.  CPSR
also maintains several listservs and hosts several online
discussion groups.  Board of Director discussions take part
online and board votes are sometimes taken online.  CPSR also
maintains two newsgroups which are not moderated.

     97.  CPSR's web site is linked to a number of other Web
sites, gophers and other computer networks.  Many of the sites
with which CPSR's site is linked appear to contain information
that is of medical or health value but that might be considered
indecent or patently offensive.  Other linked sites contain other
information that might also be considered indecent or patently
offensive.

     98.  One of the listservs, which is also a CPSR working
group, is called "Cyber Rights."  People who participate in Cyber
Rights often discuss issues of censorship and the application of
indecency rules to cyberspace.  Some of this discussion is frank
and uses strong language and/or quotes matters that have been
censored.  Other listservs and discussion groups also discuss
issues of censorship and contain strong language.

     99. Minors have access to the computer communications of
CPSR.  CPSR believes that it is important that social
responsibility be promoted among young people who are learning to
use online resources and that access to the CPSR resources would
advance this goal.  CPSR does not wish to restrict its online
resources to adults only.

     100.  Thus, for the reasons discussed in this Complaint,
CPSR does not currently intend to censor its online
communications as a result of the Act.

     101.  As computer professionals, CPSR members engage in a
great deal of interaction through various computer networks.
This includes e-mail, participation in listservs, participation
in discussion groups, and use of various sites on computer
networks.  CPSR members fear prosecution as a result of their use
of computer online communications.

National Writers Union (NWU)

     102.  Plaintiff NWU maintains a site on the World Wide Web,
as do several of its leaders.  It also maintains an online
archive of NWU-related documents, and offers two online mailing
lists to which any person, whether or not an NWU member, may
subscribe.  Some of the material on the NWU's various web sites
and mailing lists contains sexually explicit subject matter or
vulgar words -- for example, heated debates about homosexuality,
and back issues of the NWU's newsletter, which include explicit
articles about censorship, obscenity and indecency law, and gay
rights.

     103.  Many NWU members use computers to communicate with
each other via private e-mail, to exchange information, and to
post literary work.  Some of this material is sexually explicit
or contains vulgar words.  Human sexuality and the human body
have always been important subjects of literature and journalism
and, as writers, NWU members naturally address these subjects.

     104.  For example, one NWU member, Robert B. Chatelle,
maintains a web page that contains links to erotic fiction that
he has written.

     105. The NWU and its members and leaders believe that minors
should continue to have access to the NWU web site and other
online resources. Thus, for the reasons discussed in this
Complaint, NWU and some of its members do not currently intend to
self-censor any of their online communications as a result of the
Act.  Other members would self-censor in order to avoid the risk
of prosecution.

ClariNet Communications Corp. (ClariNet)

     106.  Plaintiff ClariNet Communications Corp. publishes an
electronic newspaper known as the "ClariNet e.News" in Usenet
format, which includes news articles, columns, and financial
information.  The news articles are taken from the same wire
services from which print newspapers obtain their stories but,
unlike some print newspapers, ClariNet does not censor the
articles.  ClariNet has published articles that use common
Anglo-Saxon four letter words.  It has also published articles
that explicitly describe rapes and sexual assaults.  Some of
these descriptions are more explicit than the same stories in
most print newspapers.

     107.  ClariNet also publishes a humor newsgroup in Usenet
format at rec.humor.funny and on the Web.  Some of the jokes
include vulgar language or sexually explicit material.  For
instance, some of the jokes discuss sexual acts including oral
sex.  Some jokes also use strong and explicit language.

     108.  ClariNet believes that many minors have an interest in
reading the articles and jokes it publishes and that minors do
read the material published by ClariNet.

     109.  With regard to its newspaper, which is available
primarily through educational institutions, corporations, and
Internet service providers, ClariNet depends on the providers to
institute a method to obtain access.  Because of the vagueness of
the statutory defenses, ClariNet does not know if the access
systems used by the providers would constitute a defense to
liability.

     110.  For the reasons discussed in this Complaint, ClariNet
does not currently intend to censor its news articles as a result
of the Act.  With regard to its humor newsgroup, ClariNet is
unsure what it will do to avoid liability.

Institute for Global Communications (IGC)

     111. Plaintiff IGC provides Internet web sites, access to
the Internet, and other online services primarily to nonprofit
organizations.  It serves approximately 400 nonprofit groups,
including SIECUS (the Sex Information and Education Council of
the United States), the Family Violence Prevention Fund, Stop
Prisoner Rape, Human Rights Watch, Pacifica Radio (disseminator
of the original "dirty words" comic monologue), and numerous
women's rights groups whose online communications deal with
sexual subject matter, reproduction, rape, and domestic violence.
It also serves approximately 15,000 other groups, including
approximately 500-600 schools, providing access to online
services.

     112.  IGC also sponsors online discussion groups.  IGC does
not moderate these groups but is aware that topics have included
gay and lesbian sex and erotica, AIDS and HIV treatment, women's
health, and violence against women; many of the participants are
minors.

     113. IGC does not have the resources to monitor the vast
amount of information that is published and communicated through
its networks.  Nor would it be consistent with IGC's function to
monitor and censor the content of communications that it
facilitates.  IGC has no way to determine whether or not minors
have gained access to specific sites on its network, nor does it
wish to restrict access to adults.

     114.  IGC does not understand whether the defenses provided
by the statute would protect it from criminal prosecution.

Stop Prisoner Rape (SPR)

     115.  Plaintiff SPR maintains an extensive World Wide Web
site on the Internet that contains, among other things, graphic
and uncensored accounts of actual rapes, written by the victims
themselves.  The purpose of SPR is to provide education,
information, and advocacy regarding sexual assaults in the
nation's prisons, jails, juvenile facilities, and other detention
sites.  It provides encouragement and advice to survivors, as
well as counseling and legal support.  In 1995, "Impact Online,"
which gives awards for outstanding non-profit Internet sites,
named the SPR site the best on the web for prison issues and one
of the 30 best non-profit sites.

     116. SPR believes that the graphic and uncensored nature of
the information on its web site is essential to its goal of
educating the public and combating the persistent problem of
prisoner rape.

     117. SPR believes that minors do access its web site, and
believes it is essential to allow this access to continue.
Minors are among the victims of prisoner rape and are in fact
well-known and abundantly described in published literature on
the subject to be particularly singled out as targets for sexual
assault precisely because of their youth.  Status as a minor is
one of the surest demographic indicators of likely targeting for
sexual assault of a prisoner in a facility which also includes
adults.  A significant portion of the SPR site contains
recollections of individuals who were raped as minors while
incarcerated with adults or in juvenile detention centers.  The
sharing of these experiences is invaluable to the many minors who
have been imprisoned or who may be imprisoned and fear prison
rape.

     118.  Thus, for the reasons discussed in this Complaint, SPR
does not currently intend to self-censor its online
communications as a result of the Act.

AIDS Education Global Information System (AEGIS)

     119. Plaintiff AEGIS, through its free computer bulletin
board system, offers vital information about HIV and AIDS to
people in many parts of the world who have no other access to
educational material about the disease.  Much of the information
in AEGIS is necessarily sexually explicit because HIV/AIDS is a
sexually transmitted disease.  Documents available from the AEGIS
bulletin board include but are not limited to materials from the
Center for Disease Control, Gay Men's Health Crisis, AIDS
Treatment News, and Body Positive Online Magazine.

     120. In addition to its archived material, AEGIS sponsors
many online discussion groups for people with AIDS or HIV.
Discussion groups are offered in Dutch, French, Spanish, and
German, in addition to English.  Persons with HIV/AIDS use these
online forums to share experiences with other victims of the
disease.  Medical, social welfare, and other public interest
professionals also use the online forums to distribute
information about the disease and to answer questions posed by
users.  Discussions in these groups are often sexually explicit.

     121.  AEGIS believes that it is essential to be able to use
explicit language and pictures in its online communications and
discussion groups.  The information literally saves lives and
must be communicated in terms that are not ambiguous or overly
scientific and that all audiences can understand.  Teenagers as
well as adults need to have access to the archived information
and online forums sponsored by AEGIS.  Many teenagers are
sexually active.  They are entitled to information that could
save their lives, presented in a factual and descriptive form
that is easily comprehended.

     122. Many people, including people who fear that they may be
infected with HIV/AIDS, use AEGIS to get information about the
disease because they can do so anonymously.  AEGIS does not want
to screen to prevent minors from gaining access to its resources
because such screening would infringe upon the privacy and
anonymity of all users of the system.  Moreover, AEGIS does not
have the resources to monitor its online resources to screen out
content that is "indecent" or "patently offensive," and any such
screening process would undermine the educational and health
goals of AEGIS's online services.  Thus, for the reasons
discussed in this Complaint, AEGIS has not yet decided what
changes to make, if any, as a result of the Act.

BiblioBytes

     123. Plaintiff BiblioBytes produces electronic books for
sale over the World Wide Web, including romance novels, erotica,
classics, adventure, and horror stories.  Some of these
electronic publications contain language that is sexually
explicit or vulgar or describes sexual or excretory activities or
organs.  One example of a current title in this category is
Harlan Ellison's collection of short stories, Love Ain't Nothing
But Sex Misspelled.  Several of the stories in that collection
include sexually explicit language and deal with events such as
abortion and prostitution.  Another example of a current title
that contains sexually explicit language is John Anderson's book,
Panaflex X, which is a fictional account of a woman trying to get
out of the pornography industry.

     124. BiblioBytes believes that many minors have an interest
in reading the books that BiblioBytes makes available online.

     125.  BiblioBytes now requires a credit card for purchase of
its electronic books.  BiblioBytes is unsure if this process,
which probably screens out most but not all minors, is sufficient
to avoid liability under the Act.  For the reasons discussed in
this Complaint, BiblioBytes does not currently intend to take any
additional steps to self-censor its online communications as a
result of the Act.

Queer Resources Directory

     126.  Plaintiff Queer Resources Directory (QRD) is one of
the largest online distributors of gay, lesbian, and bisexual
resources on the Internet.  QRD is accessed approximately one
million times a month and is distributed through several
co-servers around the world.  QRD contains links to online media;
events; cultural information; business, legal, political and
workplace issues; and gay, lesbian, and bisexual organizations.
The topics covered include parenting, families, marriage, youth
organizations, religion, and HIV/AIDS.  Some of the material is
sexually explicit; for example, discussions of safer sex and
human sexuality, and publications such as Hothead Paisan (a
satiric comic book about the adventures of a homicidal lesbian
terrorist) and Cuir Underground (a magazine covering events and
people in the leather and fetish community).

     127.  QRD does not wish to restrict minors from having
access to its system.  In fact, much of the material in QRD would
be valuable to gay and lesbian teenagers who are struggling with
feelings of confusion or isolation, as well as to straight youth
who want information about homosexuality.  In addition, QRD
believes that it is essential that people be able to access its
system anonymously.

     128.  QRD has not made a decision on what procedures to
institute, if any, should this statute not be enjoined.  QRD
supports the use of voluntary Internet blocking software as an
alternative to government regulation.

Critical Path AIDS Project, Inc.

     129.  Plaintiff Critical Path AIDS Project, Inc. provides
free Internet access to individuals in the Philadelphia area and
also operates a bulletin board, electronic mailing lists and a
Web site devoted to providing HIV/AIDS treatment information for
persons with AIDS and safer sex information for those at risk of
contracting AIDS.  Critical Path's online resources include AIDS
prevention and treatment information in eight different Asian
languages, which reach youths and adults at risk for AIDS in some
of the most underserved communities in the nation.  Critical Path
also offers web subsites to such nonprofit groups as We the
People (a large multiracial organization of HIV-positive
individuals), Prevention Point (a needle exchange program), Fight
the Right (a political action network), and will soon be
providing a subsite to the Youth Health Education Project, a
safer sex outreach organization specifically targeted to
teenagers.  In the fall of 1995 Critical Path was receiving about
10,000 access requests per day for information on its system from
all over the world.

     130.  The Critical Path AIDS Project web page links directly
or indirectly to thousands of databases in all 50 states and many
countries, thereby permitting users to access communications and
retrieve documents from the far reaches of the world, without
leaving the Critical Path web site.

     131.  Much of the material on Critical Path's web site and
bulletin board is necessarily sexually explicit.  It is
critically important as a matter of physical as well as emotional
health that teenagers have access to the information that
Critical Path provides.

     132.  Thus, for the reasons discussed in this Complaint,
Critical Path does not currently intend to self-censor its online
communications as a result of the Act.

     133.  Because of the vagueness of the defenses provided in
the statute, Critical Path is unsure if it would be criminally
liable for some of the communications posted by others for which
it provides access.

Wildcat Press, Inc.

     134.  Plaintiff Wildcat Press, Inc. is a small independent
publishing company specializing in classic gay and lesbian
literature that promotes its publications by providing free
excerpts through its World Wide Web site.  Wildcat Press
maintains high literary standards and has exhibited at the
American Booksellers Association Convention.

     135.  Some of the material in Wildcat Press's publications
is sexually explicit or contains vulgar language.  For example,
the 1974 novel The Frontrunner tells the story of a loving
relationship between a young athlete and his coach during the
days after the Stonewall Rebellion and before the AIDS crisis.
The sequel to that book, Harlan's Race, published in 1990,
follows one of the characters from The Frontrunner as he reflects
on the changes in the sexual behavior of the gay community
brought on by AIDS.

     136.  Wildcat Press sponsors the YouthArts Project which
publishes two online youth magazines, "YouthArts East" and
"YouthArts West," with support from students at the University of
Pennsylvania and University of Southern California.  The online
magazines publish poetry, fiction, essays, fine art, and
photography by teenagers and are targeted to an audience of
teenagers.  Some of the material is sexually explicit.  Teenagers
can obtain the magazine over the Web.

     137. Wildcat Press wishes to continue communicating with all
interested readers, regardless of age.  Wildcat Press believes
that teenagers, especially gay and lesbian youth, are not harmed
by but benefit from providing content to and obtaining access to
the YouthArts Project.

     138.  Thus, for the reasons discussed in this Complaint,
Wildcat Press does not currently intend to self censor its online
communications as a result of the Act.

Declan McCullagh dba Justice on Campus

     139.  Plaintiff Declan McCullagh began Justice on Campus, a
World Wide Web archive of information on student free speech
issues, in the fall of 1995.  Justice on Campus receives about
150 visits to its web site daily.  Although the site is housed on
a private computer in Cambridge, Massachusetts attached to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology network, McCullagh
maintains editorial control over communications posted on the
site.  Since many students, including college students, are under
the age of 18, McCullagh believes that a substantial number of
minors visit the web site.  Justice on Campus has been recognized
as serving an important educational purpose, and its materials
are assigned reading in one course at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.

     140.  Some of the communications on the Justice on Campus
site are sexually explicit or contain vulgar language.  For
example, in the context of its free speech discussion, Justice on
Campus reproduced the texts of communications by students at
Cornell University which were alleged to constitute sexual
harassment.  The actual language was necessary in order to focus
on the issue of whether college administrators overreacted to the
material.

     141.  McCullagh also maintains a list entitled
"fight-censorship" to which people can subscribe to receive
information on censorship issues.  The information includes
explicit material that has been subject to censorship by others.

     142.  For the reasons discussed in this Complaint, Justice
on Campus and McCullagh do not currently intend to self-censor
their online communications as a result of the Act.

Brock Meeks dba CyberWire Dispatch

     143. As publisher and editor of CyberWire Dispatch (CWD),
plaintiff Brock Meeks addresses many political and cyberspace
issues, including Congressional attempts to regulate and to
censor the Internet.  CWD often employs vulgar and graphic
language to make a point about government censorship efforts.
CWD has also published sexually explicit material.

     144. Meeks also writes regularly as a columnist for the
print magazine Wired and the online magazine HotWired.  Meeks
sometimes uses vulgar and graphic speech in his columns to
satirize or make political points.

     145. Meeks does not want to prevent minors, who are an
important part of his audience, from reading the material in CWD
and Hotwired.

     146.  Thus, for the reasons discussed in this Complaint,
Meeks does not currently intend to self-censor his online
communications as a result of the Act.

John Troyer, dba The Safer Sex Page

     147. Plaintiff John Troyer maintains the Safer Sex Page, a
large site on the Internet's World Wide Web that offers
educational information on safer sex.  The Safer Sex Page is
accessed by more than 35,000 people around the world every week.

     148. The Safer Sex Page includes a wide array of sex
education materials from dozens of sources; brochures include
graphics, audio, and video.  The resources are both written
specifically for the Safer Sex Page and based on information
received from other groups including the Center for Disease
Control, the United States Department of Health and Human
Services, and the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services
Center.

     149. By their very nature, information and discussions about
safer sex include explicit language and pictures.  Postings
include guidelines about the risks associated with different
sexual acts.  Explicitness is necessary to make safer sex
materials comprehensible.  The public health threat of unsafe sex
demands that people know with specificity how to protect
themselves.

     150.  The Safer Sex Page includes an online discussion group
called "Safer Sex Forum" that allows participants to add their
own comments to a monthly discussion topic.  Users of the Safer
Sex Forum often post comments on sexual subjects; past topics
have included masturbation, condom brands, and how to talk to a
partner about safer sex.

     151.  Teenagers are an important audience for the resources
offered through the Safer Sex Page and the Safer Sex Forum.  Many
teenagers are sexually active, or consider becoming sexually
active before they reach adulthood.  These minors are entitled to
information that could save their lives.

     152.  Troyer is currently unsure whether he will self-censor
his online communications as a result of the Act.

Jonathan Wallace dba The Ethical Spectacle

     153.  Plaintiff Jonathan Wallace publishes an online monthly
newsletter entitled The Ethical Spectacle under the pen name
Jonathan Blumen.  The newsletter examines the intersection of
ethics, law and politics in society.  Past issues have included
articles on human experimentation by the Nazis at Auschwitz, and
the morality of pornography.  An upcoming issue will excerpt the
writings of James Joyce, Henry Miller, William Burroughs, and
other authors whose works include explicit sexual content and
vulgar language.

     154.  Wallace does not wish to prevent minors from gaining
access to The Ethical Spectacle Web page or to lose any teenage
readers who may find instruction in the newsletter.

     155.  Thus, for the reasons discussed in this Complaint,
Wallace does not currently intend to self-censor his online
communications as a result of the Act.

Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. (PPFA)

     156.  PPFA's site on the World Wide Web provides a broad
range of information relating to reproductive health.  PPFA's
site also provides educational and graphic information about all
facets of reproductive health, from contraception to prevention
of sexually transmitted infections, to finding an abortion
provider, to information about which Planned Parenthood
affiliates have been providing abortions through use of the drug
mifepristone.  The educational information includes illustrations
of how to place a condom on a penis, and of male and female
genitalia.  The information PPFA presents is intended to be
accessible to minors who seek it; and therefore frequently
employs vernacular terminology, such as "cum" when referring to
semen or ejaculation.

     157.  PPFA's site also provides an e-mail service.  Through
this service, users can address questions to PPFA on subjects
such as abortion, contraception, prevention of sexually
transmitted infections, and sexuality, and PPFA responds with
complete information.  PPFA also receives information by e-mail
regarding performing and obtaining abortions, practices necessary
to reduce unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted
infections, and sexuality information generally.

     158.  PPFA's site is accessible to any user seeking access.
PPFA believes limitations on access to its site would
significantly diminish its effectiveness as a source of
information, and PPFA does not currently intend to self-censor
access.

     159.  In addition to communicating via interactive computer
services, PPFA sends and receives information about performing
and obtaining abortions through the mails and telephone and FAX.

Allegations Common to All Plaintiffs

     160.  The effect of this statute, if implemented, would be
to reduce adults to obtaining access by computer to only that
information that is fit for children.

     161.  Given that American society is comprised of people
from an endless variety of religious, ethnic, cultural,
political, and moral backgrounds, each with his or her own view
of what constitutes "indecent" or "patently offensive"
expression, these terms are completely vague and do not put any
reasonable person on notice of what communications are
prohibited.

     162.  Plaintiffs and their members do not know how to define
the terms "indecent" and "patently offensive."  All are forced as
a consequence to guess at what communications will be prosecuted.
Because of its vagueness, the statute invites arbitrary and
discriminatory enforcement, and chills constitutionally protected
expression by the plaintiffs, their members, and other users of
interactive computer services.

     163.  The defenses provided under the statute are vague and
contradictory.  It is not clear what 47 U.S.C.  223(e)(1) means
by a "facility, system, or network" not being "under [the]
control" of a person since even online providers who do not
themselves create the content of communications over their
systems can technologically exercise "control" over the
communications for which they are conduits.  It is also not clear
whether 47 U.S.C.  230(c)(1) provides a defense for anyone who is
not a "publisher or speaker."  Thus, those who act in part as
access providers or hosts for interactive communications cannot
know to what extent they will be held liable for "indecent" or
"patently offensive" communications to minors.

     164.  Even if it may be technically feasible to devise a
method to block access to computer communications by some or most
minors, as a practical matter it is economically infeasible.  All
of the plaintiffs would suffer serious economic hardship if they
were required to write separate versions of online
communications:  one for adults, and one for minors.  Thus, the
defense provided by section 223(e)(5) is not practically
available.

     165.  Moreover, any blocking system would require advance
identification of those seeking access to a web site, chat room,
discussion group, or other online forum.  Initiating age ID and
blocking systems would undermine the essential purpose of the
plaintiffs' communications -- to be disseminated as easily,
widely, and quickly as possible, with a minimum of burden and
expense.

     166.  Any attempt to guarantee that minors could not access
information that requires advance identification of those seeking
access would also make it impossible for users to engage in
constitutionally protected anonymous speech on matters of public
and private importance.

     167.  For those plaintiffs who have members who are minors,
blocking access to online communications would deny minors access
to materials that they could legally receive in printed form or
that they could legally given in a library or bookstore.  It
would deny them access to materials that they have a
constitutional right to receive.

     168.  Section 223(e)(5) provides a defense for "good faith,
reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions" to "restrict or
prevent access by minors ... including any method which is
feasible."  This defense is so vague that it is not possible for
those plaintiffs who seek to fall within its provisions to know
if they have taken the actions necessary to avoid liability.

     169.  The plaintiffs fear prosecution or other enforcement
under the statute for communicating, sending, or displaying
"indecent" or "patently offensive" material in a manner available
to persons under age 18.  They also fear liability for material
posted by others to their online discussion groups, chat rooms,
bulletin boards, listservs, or web sites.  Plaintiffs ACLU, PPFA,
and others fear prosecution for distributing and receiving
information about abortions and abortifacient drugs and devices
in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1462(c).

     170.  Moreover, plaintiffs fear that if the statute goes
into effect, online services and other access providers such as
educational institutions will ban communications that they
consider potentially "indecent" or "patently offensive," thereby
depriving the plaintiffs, their members, and those who use their
online services of the ability to communicate about important
issues.

     171.  The plaintiffs' web sites are linked to other web
sites on the Internet in a virtually endless chain.  There is no
way for plaintiffs to screen the material on all of those linked
sites or to prevent minors from accessing those sites.

                         CAUSES OF ACTION

     172.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege   1-171.

     173.  47 U.S.C.   223(a)(1)(B) and (a)(2)(the "indecency"
provision) and 223(d)(the "patently offensive" provision) violate
the First Amendment to the United States Constitution on their
face and as applied because they effect a total ban on
constitutionally protected communications in many parts of
cyberspace.  Even in those portions of cyberspace where it is
technologically and economically feasible to deny access to
minors,   223(a)(1)(B) and (a)(2) and 223(d), are not the least
restrictive means of accomplishing any compelling governmental
purpose, and thus violate the First Amendment.

     174.  47 U.S.C.   223(a)(1)(B) and (a)(2) and 223(d) are
vague, in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments to the
United States Constitution.

     175.  Even if the government could criminalize some
constitutionally protected online communications to minors, 47
U.S.C.   223(a)(1)(B) and (a)(2) and 223(d) are
unconstitutionally overbroad, in violation of the First
Amendment, because they ban far more constitutionally protected
expression to minors than possibly could be justified by any
governmental interest.

     176.  47 U.S.C.   223(a)(1)(B) and (a)(2) and 223(d) violate
the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendment privacy rights of
members and officers of the plaintiff organizations who use
private e-mail.

     177. 47 U.S.C.   223(a)(1)(B) and (a)(2)and 223(d) violate
the First Amendment rights of members of the plaintiff
organizations and other users of computer resources to engage in
anonymous speech.

     178.  18 U.S.C.  1462(c) on its face violates the First
Amendment rights of members and officers of plaintiff ACLU, PPFA,
and others who disseminate and receive information through
express companies or other common carriers, or through
interactive computer services, regarding women's access to
abortions and abortifacient drugs and doctors' abilities to
perform abortions.

WHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully request the Court to:
     (1)  Declare that 47 U.S.C.   223(a)(1)(B) and (a)(2),
223(d), and 18 U.S.C.  1462(c) violate the First, Fourth, Fifth,
and Ninth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and enjoin their
enforcement.
     (2)  Award plaintiffs reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
     (3)  Award such further relief as the Court deems just and
appropriate.

                              Respectfully submitted,

STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE to using the Freedom of Information Act
</h2>
<hr width=80%>
</center>
<blockquote>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a law that generally establishes
the right of the public to obtain information from agencies of the federal
government.
<P>
In the FOIA, Congress created a specific procedure through which any
person can exercise the public's general right to request and obtain
access to particular agency records.
<P>
Although Congress tried to make the request procedure as simple as
possible, the actual statutory requirements -- on such matters as time
limits for agency response, fees that a requester may be charged,
exemptions that an agency may claim, and the requester's right to appeal
and seek judicial review of any denied request -- can sometimes be more
confusing than helpful to the first-time FOIA user.
<P>
This Step-by-Step guide can help any individual to make an FOIA request
and pursue it toward the desired agency response with a minimum amount of
time and effort. Its concise explanation of the various provisions of the
FOIA, combined with a set of simple instructions and sample letters,
should make the FOIA usable to anyone seeking access to government
records.

<img src="/graphics/abouthdr.gif"><CENTER><h1>Eye on the Opposition </h1></CENTER>
On Wednesday, May 17, the Christian Coalition released its<A HREF="/about/summary.html"> Contract with the American Family</A>, which it called a "bold agenda to strengthen the family and restore common-sense values."
<P>
Surrounded by the House Republican leadership, including Speaker Newt
Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick Armey, officials of the Christian Coalition
said that their Contract contained ten proposals that "will hold government
accountable for the cultural crisis that has afflicted our nation over the
past three decades."
<P>
On Monday, the ACLU sent a <A HREF="/about/aclultr.html">letter to President Clinton</A>, all Members of Congress and the 50 state governors, urging them to reject the Christian
Coalition's proposals to tamper with the Constitution. The letter focused on
the Contract's centerpiece: a proposal for an amendment that would, if
adopted by Congress and the states, would inevitably lead to the
reintroduction of organized school prayer.
<P>
On Wednesday, the ACLU released a brief analysis of the Contract, saying that
contained "radical ideas," that Congress should reject. "The Christian
Coalition says that its contract is an agenda to restore common-sense values
in America," ACLU Washington Office Director Laura Murphy Lee said. "In
reality, however, the Christian Coalition's Contract would, if enacted by
Congress, mean a radical shift toward government control of the most personal
elements of American life."     <P>

Fenwick, M.D., Dr. Mary Kathryn Garrett, M.D., Dr. John W. Glotfelty, M.D., Dr. Louis C. Murray, M.D., Dr. Margaret C.S. Skinner, M.D., Cecile M. Scoon, Esq., H. Fred Varn, Dr. Gary E. Winchester, M.D., and Dr. Abraham L. Woods, M.D., each in his or her official capacity as a member of the Board of Medicine of the State of Florida, Agency for Health Care Administration, and allege:
<blockquote>
<p> 	1.	This action challenges whether Fla. Stat.  782.08, which makes it a crime for one to assist another in suicide, is unconstitutional as applied to prevent an adult, who is mentally competent, terminally ill, and acting under no undue influence, from hastening his own death by taking a lethal dose of drugs prescribed by his doctor; and whether the state medical regulatory authorities may discipline a physician for providing such assistance.
<p>	2.	The plaintiffs seek a temporary injunction, a declaratory judgment and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to the United States Constitution; Article I, Section 23 of the Florida Constitution, the Privacy Amendment; 42 U.S.C.  1983, the Civil Rights Act of 1879; and Section 86.011 et seq., Florida Statutes.
<p>	3.	The plaintiff Dr. Cecil McIver, M.D., is a physician duly licensed to practice medicine in the State of Florida and practicing in Jupiter, Palm Beach County, Florida.  Venue lies in Palm Beach County pursuant to Florida Statutes  47.011.  Dr. McIver seeks direct judicial protection from the defendants' unlawful invasion of his fundamental constitutional rights, and the constitutional rights he asserts on behalf of his patients.
<p>	4.	Moreover, the Court should dispense with any home venue privilege, if one exists for any or all defendants, because fairness, justice, and convenience would be furthered in view of the circumstances presented and the interests of all parties.
<p>	5.	The defendants' unlawful action is imminently threatened in Palm Beach County, where Dr. McIver's practice is located, within the jurisdiction of Barry Krischer, the State Attorney of the 15th Judicial Circuit.
<p>	6.	The plaintiff C.B. ("Chuck") Castonguay is a resident of Edgewater, in Volusia County, Florida, within the jurisdiction of Steve Alexander, the State Attorney of the 7th Judicial Circuit.
<p>	7.	The plaintiff Robert G. Cron is a resident of Oldsmar, in Pinellas County, Florida, within the jurisdiction of Bernie McCabe, the State Attorney of the 6th Judicial Circuit.
<p>	8.	The plaintiff Charles E. Hall is a resident of Beverly Hills, in Citrus County, Florida, within the jurisdiction of Brad King, the State Attorney of the 5th Judicial Circuit.
<p>	9.	The defendants, Barry Krischer, Brad King, Bernie McCabe and Steve Alexander (hereinafter the "State Attorneys"), act under color of state law when acting in their official capacities.  Each is vested with the sole authority to determine whom to prosecute within his territorial jurisdiction under Florida Statutes Section 782.08, entitled "assisting self murder," which provides:
<p>
			Every person deliberately assisting another in the commission of self-murder shall be guilty of manslaughter, a felony of the second degree ... 
<p>	10.	Dr. McIver is actually threatened with imminent prosecution by any one of the State Attorneys for a violation of Section 782.08 if he provides the treatment that his patients seek and that he, in the exercise of his best professional judgment, believes is appropriate.  The declaratory and injunctive relief sought in this action therefore would affect his rights and the rights he asserts on behalf of his patients.
<p>	11.	The defendants, Dr. Fuad S. Ashkar, M.D., Dr. James Cerda, M.D., Dr. Edward A. Dauer, M.D., Becky Cherney, Dr. Emilio Echevarra, M.D., Dr. Georges A. El-Bahri, M.D., Dr. Martin J. Fenwick, M.D., Dr. Mary Kathryn Garrett, M.D., Dr. John W. Glotfelty, M.D., Dr. Louis C. Murray, M.D., Dr. Margaret C.S. Skinner, M.D., Cecile M. Scoon, Esq., H. Fred Varn, Dr. Gary E. Winchester, M.D., and Dr. Abraham L. Woods, M.D. (collectively, the "Board"), are members of the Board of Medicine of the State of Florida, Agency for Health Care Administration.
<p>	12.	Each member of the Board is sued in his or her official capacity.  The Board is created by Fla. Stat.  458.301 et seq. and vested with the authority to grant, deny, revoke, and otherwise regulate a physician's license to practice medicine in Florida.  The Board is additionally authorized to investigate physicians and impose a wide range of sanctions for misconduct.
<p>	13.	The Board acts under color of state law in all these activities.
<p>	14.	Dr. McIver is actually threatened with imminent disciplinary action by the Board if he provides the treatment that his patient seeks and that he, in the exercise of his best professional judgment, believes is appropriate.  The declaratory and injunctive relief sought in this action therefore would affect his fundamental constitutional rights and the rights he asserts on behalf of his patients.
<p>	15.	The State Attorneys and the Board are additionally authorized by Florida Statutes to take other actions prejudicial to Dr. McIver if he enables the plaintiffs Castonguay, Cron and Hall to terminate their own suffering, including, but not limited to:
<blockquote>	<p>	(a)	A conviction under the assisted suicide statute could lead to disciplinary action by the Board.  See Fla. Stat.  458.331(1)(c) (creating the disciplinary violation of "[b]eing convicted ... of ... a crime ... which directly relates to the practice of medicine").
	<p>	(b)	The assistance sought by the plaintiffs Castonguay, Cron and Hall could be construed to violate Fla. Stat.  458.326(4) ("Nothing in this section shall be construed to condone, authorize, or approve mercy killing or euthanasia, and no treatment authorized by this section may be used for such purpose.").  In turn, such a violation could lead to Dr. McIver's prosecution for a crime pursuant to Fla. Stat.  458.327(2)(a) (creating a second-degree misdemeanor for "[k]nowingly concealing information relating to violations of this chapter").
	<p>	(c)	The assistance Dr. McIver seeks to provide to the plaintiffs Castonguay, Cron and Hall could also be construed to be prohibited by Section 765.309, which states that nothing in the chapter on the lawful withholding or withdrawal of life-prolonging procedures "shall be construed to condone, authorize, or approve mercy killing or euthanasia, or to permit any affirmative or deliberate act or omission to end life other than to permit the natural process of dying."</blockquote>
<p>
	<b>Castonguay</b>
<p>	16.	Castonguay, a writer, suffers from cancer of the esophagus, which has spread into his chest.  He is also a childhood polio victim.  He is 65.
<p>	17.	His cancer was diagnosed in April 1995.  Informed that medical science could offer no curative measures, he declined therapy that he felt would only prolong his illness.  He had previously, at age 53, survived a malignant melanoma.
<p>	18.	Castonguay is under the care of Hospice and is provided with morphine to control the pain in his right side.  His weight has fallen from 145 pounds to 112.
<p>	19.	He moves with great difficulty because of general weakness from his cancer coupled with the lifelong weakness in his legs caused by his childhood polio.  He has difficulty speaking and swallowing.
<p>	20.	He recognizes that his condition is deteriorating and he wishes to control the terminal stages of his inevitable decline.  His major concern is a progressive erosion in the quality of his life.  Describing himself as a "planner," he wants to "keep one jump ahead" and control the circumstances of his death.  
<p>	<b>Cron</b>
<p>	21.	Cron, the retired owner of a Clearwater printing business, suffers from mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the chest cavity.  He is 72.
<p>	22.	Cron took ill in September 1994, complaining of shortness of breath.  He was experiencing fluid buildup on the pleural space surrounding the lungs.  Upon diagnosis of his cancer, he underwent treatment which consisted of obliterating the pleural space, which prevented the possibility of further fluid buildup in his chest, and chemotherapy.
<p>	23.	At the end of his treatment his physician informed him that no known therapy was likely to benefit him and that his condition was terminal.  There is no reasonable doubt about his prognosis.
<p>	24.	Cron's wife and family fully understand and support his decision.  Indeed, his decision is motivated in part by a desire to minimize the emotional trauma his death will cause to them.
<p>	<b>Hall</b>
<p>	25.	Hall, a restaurateur when he last was able to work, is a victim of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS.  He is 40.
<p>	26.	In 1981 Hall had back surgery to correct a problem that had developed as a result of a fall and had a blood transfusion during the surgery.  In 1993, while he was being treated for hepatitis, his doctors discovered he had contracted the AIDS virus from the transfusions twelve years earlier.
<p>	27.	Hall's health is deteriorating rapidly.  He has lost 40 pounds.  He is confined to a wheelchair because of the pain in his legs and the weakness of his leg muscles.  He suffers from severe headaches and has had some seizures.
<p>	28.	He is taking a large number of medications.  His T-cell count has fallen to approximately 110.  His prognosis in the present state of medical knowledge is hopeless and he is terminal.
<p>	29.	Hall is clearly mentally competent at this time and in fact is using his last days to develop an AIDS support group in his local community. 
<p>	*  *  *
<p>	30.	Each of the three patients whose rights Dr. McIver is asserting is mentally competent and emotionally stable.  Each is able to comprehend the ethical and moral implications of his decision to terminate his suffering. 
<p>	31.	Each recognizes that a point is likely to come at which he will experience only useless suffering, a point at which he will no longer feel the solace of knowing that his suffering will be followed by, and justified by, a period of renewed health.
<p>	32.	Each of the three patient plaintiffs, Castonguay, Cron and Hall, has a prognosis that is certainly hopeless and each is terminally ill.  Each can foresee the situation when, if natural death does not terminate his life, his best and most logical option will be to cut his suffering short and terminate life.
<p>	33.	Not having the expertise to terminate life painlessly and with certainty, Castonguay, Cron and Hall each requires the assistance of a physician.
<p>	34.	Each would prefer to die at home, in the company of those who accept his invitation to be present, having administered a substance which will induce immediate loss of consciousness and certain death shortly thereafter.
<p>	35.	Castonguay, Cron and Hall have sought the services of Dr. McIver, who is willing to exercise his professional skill and judgment to provide Castonguay, Cron and Hall with the assistance they need to end their suffering.  Without Dr. McIver's assistance, each man would confront the alternative of attempting to terminate his life in a manner that could fail and leave him in a worse condition than before his attempt, as often happens with such terminal patients.
<p>	36.	Dr. McIver has consulted with Castonguay, Cron and Hall and concluded that each is fully competent at this time to make the request he is making, and that his decision is not a result of mental illness or undue influence by others.  Dr. McIver's professional judgment is that it would be medically appropriate and ethical to provide Castonguay, Cron and Hall with the assistance they request.
<p>	37.	Absent a declaratory judgment that Castonguay, Cron and Hall each has a constitutional right to exercise the informed choice he has made, and injunctive relief to protect Dr. McIver from being punished therefore, Dr. McIver will not prescribe the drugs that his patients seek and that he believes would be appropriately and ethically prescribed under the circumstances.
<p>	38.	The decision of Castonguay, Cron and Hall whether to terminate their own suffering before nature takes its full course is one of the most intimate, personal choices they will make in their lifetime.  No decision is closer to the heart of personal liberty.  Each man's ability to make this decision without undue governmental interference is central to his personal dignity and autonomy.
<p>	39.	Accordingly, Castonguay, Cron and Hall, as mentally competent, terminally ill adults with no chance of recovery, have a right under the Florida Privacy Amendment to take their own lives with their physician's assistance and without undue interference by the state government.  By prohibiting Castonguay, Cron and Hall from making their own free choice, the government has entered a realm of individual liberty that it is not entitled to enter.
<p>	40.	Dr. McIver, as a physician duly licensed by the state of Florida, has third-party standing to assert his patients' privacy rights and additionally has a privacy right of his own to practice medicine consistent with his best professional judgment.  This privacy right includes the right to assist a competent, terminally ill adult patient such as Castonguay, Cron or Hall to hasten his death by prescribing suitable medication for self-administration by the patient.
<p>	41.	Section 782.08 does not serve a state interest sufficiently compelling to override the rights of Castonguay, Cron and Hall and Dr. McIver to privacy in the facts of this case.  To the extent that Section 782.08 serves a generally compelling state interest, that interest is at its weakest in the facts of this case.
<p>	42.	To the extent that Section 782.08 or other Florida statutes impose criminal sanctions on Dr. McIver for prescribing medication with which Castonguay, Cron or Hall would terminate his own suffering, section 782.08 or such other criminal statute is not the least intrusive means for the state of Florida to accomplish its legitimate goals.
<p>	43.	Under the Privacy Amendment, the right to privacy which Dr. McIver and Castonguay, Cron and Hall seek to vindicate is a right vouchsafed to them by the Florida Constitution.  Yet Dr. McIver and Castonguay, Cron and Hall have been deprived of these rights without due process of law, in contravention of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.
<p>	44.	The plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law and face imminent and irreparable loss of their rights.  Absent expedited consideration and prompt injunction, the plaintiffs will continue to suffer substantial and irreparable harm and their rights will finally and fully be denied before this Court can rule.
<p>	45.	The State Attorneys and the Board are acting under color of state law in depriving Dr. McIver, Castonguay, Cron and Hall of these state-created rights without due process of law.
<p>	46.	Dr. McIver, Castonguay, Cron and Hall have been forced to retain the undersigned counsel to vindicate their right to privacy in the actions they propose to take.  They have been forced to incur court costs and a reasonable attorneys' fee in connection with this action.
<p>	47.	The plaintiffs are entitled to recover all costs and a reasonable attorneys' fee pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1988 and Florida common law.
<p>	WHEREFORE, the plaintiffs, Dr. McIver, Castonguay, Cron and Hall, pray that the Court take jurisdiction over these parties and this action, enter such orders as are appropriate to expedite consideration of this action, and:
<blockquote>	<p>	(a)	Enter a declaratory judgment that Castonguay, Cron and Hall each has a constitutional right under the Privacy Amendment to make the decision to terminate his own suffering, and to seek his physician's assistance to do so, under the circumstances of this case;
	<p>	(b)	Enter a declaratory judgment that Dr. McIver is entitled to assert the rights of Castonguay, Cron and Hall and his own right to provide Castonguay, Cron and Hall with the assistance they request;
	<p>	(c)	Enter a temporary and permanent injunction prohibiting the State Attorneys from prosecuting Dr. McIver under Section 782.08, or any other Florida criminal statute, for engaging in the conduct specifically found by the Court's declaratory judgment to be constitutionally protected;
	<p>	(d)	Enter a temporary and permanent injunction prohibiting the State Attorneys from prosecuting, under Section 782.08, or any other Florida criminal statute, anyone who is present or who assists Castonguay, Cron or Hall, at the patient's request, in the administration of his prescription;
	<p>	(e)	Enter a temporary and permanent injunction prohibiting the Board from investigating or convening a probable cause panel to investigate or to make a probable cause determination against Dr. McIver pursuant to Fla. Stat.  455.255(1)-(4) and 458.307(b) for engaging in the conduct specifically found by the Court's declaratory judgment to be constitutionally protected, from finding probable cause therefore, and from imposing or attempting to impose on Dr. McIver any disciplinary action therefore, pursuant to Fla. Stat.  458.333, including, but not limited to, revocation or suspension of license, restriction of practice, probation, the imposition of conditions on continued licensure, fines, or the issuance of a letter of concern or other type of public or private reprimand.
	<p>	(f)	Awarding the plaintiffs all costs and a reasonable attorneys' fee for the prosecution of this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1988 and Florida common law.

<title>ACLU Briefer -- Music under Siege</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote><img src="/graphics/libraryhdr.gif">
<center>
<h2>POPULAR MUSIC UNDER SIEGE
</h2>
<hr width=60%>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>Beginning in the 1980s, religious fundamentalists and some parents' groups
have waged a persistent campaign to limit the variety of cultural messages
available to American youth by attacking the content of some of the music
industry's creative products.  These attacks have taken numerous forms,
including a call by the Parents' Music Resource Center (PMRC) for the
labeling of recordings whose themes or imagery relate to sexuality,
violence, drug or alcohol use, suicide or the &quot;occult,&quot; and prosecutions of
record companies and storeowners for producing or selling albums that
contain controversial songs.
</p>
<p>After years of pressure from the PMRC and a series of Senate hearings in
1985, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) introduced, in
1990, a uniform labeling system using the logo, &quot;Parental Advisory -
Explicit Lyrics.&quot;  The RIAA initiated this system without providing record
companies with any standards, criteria or guidelines for determining what
albums should be labeled.  That decision is left completely up to the
companies, which have chosen to label only selected rock and rap albums and
not recordings of country music, opera or musical comedy that may also
contain controversial material.
</p>
<p>Dissatisfied with the RIAA's labels, many would-be censors have demanded
even more limits on the sale of music with controversial lyrics.  As a
result, legislators have introduced bills in more than 20 states in recent
years that would require warning labels far more detailed than the RIAA's. 
Some proposed laws would go beyond mandatory labeling and actually ban the
sale to minors of music deemed to be objectionable.
</p>
<p>Until 1992, none of this legislation had passed, although in 1991 a bill in
Louisiana failed by only one vote.  In 1992, however, the state of
Washington passed a law that required storeowners to place &quot;adults only&quot;
labels on recordings a judge had found to be &quot;erotic&quot;; the law also
criminalized the sale of any labeled CD or tape to a person under age 18. 
Fortunately, the law was never enforced because a few months after passage
a state court declared it unconstitutional.
</p>
<p>Even though Washington's &quot;erotic music&quot; law failed, the battle over
proposals to label or otherwise restrict certain music sales will probably
continue.  The groups and individuals who have been attacking popular music
want to impose their personal moral and political standards on the rest of
us.  The American Civil Liberties Union is working hard to prevent the
achievement of that goal, which would imperil the First Amendment rights of
musicians, and of all Americans, to create, perform and hear music of our
own choosing.
</p>
<h4>Q: What's wrong with voluntary labeling?  Isn't it, like movie rating, a
harmless way to give parents consumer information that can help them
make intelligent choices for their kids?
</h4>

<p>A: Even &quot;voluntary&quot; labeling is not harmless.  First of all, a label on an album is no proof whatsoever that the music
inside is in any way harmful or illegal.  Yet many music stores, including
some of the largest national chains, refuse to sell labeled albums to
minors, and some stores refuse to carry them at all out of fear that the
wrath of pressure groups will bring bad publicity and possible boycotts. 
Some people argue that an &quot;explicit lyrics&quot; label, like an &quot;R&quot; movie
rating, actually boosts sales by drawing attention to the labeled album. 
This may or may not be true, but we can say for sure that fans can't buy an
album if it's not in the store.
</p>
<p>Labeling is a red flag for would-be censors, who want to see the content of
popular music regulated as much as possible.  Even worse, the RIAA's
&quot;Parental Advisory&quot; label is now used as a model for labeling legislation
that would establish government censorship of record sales to minors.  The
RIAA label also has encouraged pro-&quot;decency&quot; prosecutors to target
particular albums when threatening storeowners with prosecution, usually in
the hope of persuading the storeowners to stop selling those albums.  Is
labeling truly helpful to parents?  No.  All a label means is that, in
somebody's opinion, some parents might consider the labeled material unfit
for their children.  The only way parents who want to supervise their
children's musical experiences can really learn anything about a tape or CD
is to personally examine the package, which often includes printed lyrics. 
Then, they can decide for themselves whether it's acceptable or not.
</p>
<h4>Q: What about government labeling or classification of music lyrics?
</h4>
<p>A: &quot;Voluntary&quot; labeling is bad enough, but government labeling would be worse
still -- worse for musicians, for manufacturers, for listeners and for the
Constitution.
</p>
<p>The labeling bills proposed to date have offered very vague standards for
determining what albums should be labeled, making it impossible for
artists, record companies and stores to understand whether or how the laws
apply to them.  A New Jersey bill, for example, would require a &quot;parental
advisory&quot; label on lyrics that discuss &quot;suicide, incest, bestiality,
sadomasochism, rape or involuntary sexual penetration, or which advocate or
encourage murder, ethnic, racial or religious intimidation, the use of
illegal drugs or the excessive or illegal use of alcohol.&quot;  That list could
cover everything from the opera, &quot;La Traviata,&quot; to the Beatles' &quot;Lucy in
the Sky with Diamonds.&quot;  Such vagueness makes artists and others in the
music industry feel that they must censor themselves to avoid risking
criminal prosecution.
</p>
<p>Most important of all, labeling requirements are usually coupled with
restrictions on sales.  Therefore, mandatory labeling laws would bring
about unconstitutional restrictions on the First Amendment right of artists
to express themselves freely, and on their fans' right to hear what the
artists express -- whatever the subject might be.
</p>
<h4>Q: What about laws that keep music with antisocial, misogynistic or violent
messages away from minors -- doesn't society have an obligation to protect
kids?
</h4>
<p>A: Courts have ruled that the government does have an interest in protecting
children.  As a result, many states now have &quot;harmful to minors&quot; laws that
are modified versions of adult obscenity laws.  These laws specifically
target works that are sexually explicit and lack serious artistic or other
value.
</p>
<p>Lyric-labeling legislation, however, doesn't limit itself  to sexual
material that lacks value; instead of being specific, these bills usually
target a wide range of topics regardless of whether the music has value. 
Because many of our elected officials disrespect rock and rap music and its
fans, they don't feel it's necessary to be specific about music that they
regard as an amorphous mass of unsavory images and messages.
</p>
<p>For example, the real target of the police groups and others who sought to
ban &quot;Cop Killer,&quot; claiming that the song advocates the murder of police
officers, appeared to be Ice-T's political viewpoint.  &quot;Cop Killer&quot; is a
work of musical fiction that depicts violence against the police as a
response to police brutality.  It reflects a radical attitude held by some
inner city residents, who are furious about the police abuse of authority
they feel they have witnessed or experienced.
</p>
<p>As a practical matter, it's impossible to know exactly what message a
particular listener takes from &quot;Cop Killer.&quot;  But most likely, rather than
inciting violence against the police, as its detractors claim, the rap
provides an outlet for anger and encourages listeners to think about the
issue of police misconduct and the antagonism it creates.
</p>
<h4>Q: But what if someone listens to &quot;Cop Killer&quot; and then murders a police
officer?  Don't lyrics that deal with sex, violence, drug use, suicide,
etc. cause anti-social behavior?
</h4>
<p>A: No direct link between anti-social behavior and exposure to the content of
any form of artistic expression has ever been scientifically established. 
Moreover, scapegoating artistic expression as a cause of social ills is
simplistic.  How can serious social problems like violent crime, racism or
suicide be solved by covering children's ears?  If suppressing creative
expression were the way to control anti-social behavior, where would you
stop?  The source of inspiration most frequently cited by criminals has
been the Bible.
</p>
<p>Singer Ozzy Osbourne was sued three times by parents who claimed that his
&quot;Suicide Solution&quot; made their sons kill themselves, and the heavy metal
band, Judas Priest, faced a similar lawsuit in 1990.  In all of these
cases, the courts rejected the idea that musicians can be held responsible
for the acts of unstable individuals.
</p>
<p>Throughout American history, popular music has mirrored the thoughts and
yearnings of young people.  Performers from the Beatles, Bob Dylan and
Aretha Franklin to Arrested Development and Madonna, have often celebrated
change and challenged &quot;the establishment.&quot;  Clearly, the real intentions of
the would-be music censors is to impose on all Americans the tastes and
values of political powerbrokers who don't connect with the experiences and
concerns of the young, the alienated and minorities.
</p>
<p>Lyric-labeling, directed almost exclusively at rock and rap music,
impoverishes our culture by muzzling the voices of that music's primarily
young fans.  Such suppression undermines the bedrock of our freedoms, the
First Amendment, and it makes us all less free.

<p>
     <a name="qp"><b>QUESTIONS PRESENTED</b></a>
<p>
     Sections 10(a) and 10(b) of the 1992 Cable Act establish a comprehensive scheme for
censorship of "indecent" programming on leased access channels.  Congress authorized cable
operators to prohibit programming that they "reasonably believe" to be indecent and, in the
alternative, required such protected speech to be placed on segregated channels that must be
blocked until the subscriber requests access in writing and for up to thirty days thereafter. 
Section 10(c) authorized cable operators to prohibit programming on public, educational, and
governmental access channels that is "sexually explicit" or "solicits or promotes unlawful
conduct."
<br>
     1.   Is section 10's explicitly content- and speaker-based censorship scheme subject to
First Amendment scrutiny?<br>
     2.   Is section 10 unconstitutional because it authorizes and requires censorship under
vague standards and lacks essential procedural safeguards?<br>
     3.   Is section 10's content- and speaker-based censorship scheme   which regulates
"indecent" speech on only access channels and is not the least restrictive means of accomplishing
a compelling governmental interest   unconstitutional under the First Amendment?     
<p>
<a name="list"><b>LIST OF PARTIES</b></a>
<p>
     The judgment here reviewed was rendered in a proceeding in the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit addressing four petitions for review of orders of the
Federal Communications Commission.
  <p>   In addition to those listed on the cover, respondents include Alliance for Community
Media, Alliance for Communications Democracy, People For the American Way, New York
Citizens Committee for Responsible Media, Media Access New York, Brooklyn Producers'
Group, and David Channon.  The foregoing respondents are petitioners in no. 95-227, which has
been consolidated with the present action, and their interests are aligned with those of petitioners
here.
<p>     Respondents also include National Cable Television Association, Inc., which was an
intervenor in all four proceedings before the court of appeals.
<p>
     RULE 29.6 NOTATION<br>
     Petitioners have no parent companies or subsidiaries.     
 <p>
     I.   All of Section 10 Is Impermissibly Content-Based, and No Part Can Be
Immunized from Constitutional Review by the State Action Doctrine     13
<blockquote>      
 <p>    A.   The Court Must Determine the Validity of Section 10 and Cannot Do That
Without Reaching and Deciding the First Amendment Challenge 14
     <p>      B.   The Issue Is Whether Section 10 Violates the Constitution, Not Whether
Particular Censorship Decisions of Cable Operators Would Be State Action   19
<blockquote>     <p>           1.   The state action doctrine is inapposite 19
     <p>           2.   Section 10 does not "restore" rights to cable operators, and a partial
restoration is constitutionally reviewable in any event     21
     <p>           3.   Section 10 cannot escape constitutional scrutiny, because it
preempts contrary state law, significantly encourages content-based censorship, and embroils the
Commission as a joint participant in the censorship scheme  23
</blockquote></blockquote>  
<p>    II.  Section 10 Is Unconstitutional Because It Authorizes and Requires Censorship
under Vague Standards and Lacks Essential Procedural Safeguards  25
<blockquote><p>        A.   Section 10 Is Completely Vague     25
     <p>      B.   Pacifica Is Not Controlling   32
    <p>       C.   Section 10 Lacks Essential Procedural Safeguards  36
</blockquote>
     <p> III. Section 10's Content-Based Direct Burdens on Free Speech Rights Violate the
First Amendment     38
<blockquote>      <p>     A.   Sections 10(a) and 10(c) Are Not Narrowly Tailored     41
       <p>    B.   Section 10(b) Is Not Narrowly Tailored  42
<blockquote>          <p>      1.   Section 10(b) is impermissibly overinclusive, because its
restrictions on speech do not advance the government's goals     42
          <p>      2.   Section 10(b) imposes unnecessary burdens on speech    43
          <p>      3.   Section 10(b) is impermissibly underinclusive, because it blocks
speech only by leased access programmers     47
 </blockquote></blockquote><p>

<p>
     <a name="sc"><b>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</b></a>
<p>
     1.   Local Regulation and the 1984 Cable Act.  Cable access channels were first
created in the 1960s, as cable operators received franchises from local authorities.  Local
governments provided "use of public rights-of-way and easements" essential to the cable
system's "physical infrastructure," Turner Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2452
(1994), and, in turn, generally required cable operators to act as conduits and set aside some
portion of their channel capacity for the public, thereby providing a "direct right of access to the
video media" through access channels, the content of which cable operators were generally
prohibited from controlling, Daniel L. Brenner et al., Cable Television and Other Nonbroadcast
Video   6.04[1], at 6-31 (1995); cf. Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2465 (cable operators are also conduits
for broadcast signals).
<p>
     In 1972, the Commission promulgated mandatory access rules, requiring the largest cable
operators to offer, by 1977, access to the public on a first-come, nondiscriminatory basis, with
operators having no control over content.  36 F.C.C.2d 143 (1972).  In 1976, the Commission
revised and reissued its mandatory access rules, applying them to more cable systems and
extending the compliance date for most systems to 1986.  59 F.C.C.2d 294 (1976).  On review of
these rules, this Court held them statutorily unauthorized.  FCC v. Midwest Video Corp., 440
U.S. 689 (1979).
<p>
     Although the Commission lacked authority to mandate cable access channels, local
franchising authorities were free to do so, and, in the wake of Midwest Video, almost all
franchise agreements continued to provide for access by community groups over public access
channels, where operators functioned simply as conduits, and prohibited operator control of
content.  See H.R. Rep. No. 934, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1984).
<p>
     Then, in 1984, to "assure that cable communications provide . . . the widest possible
diversity of information sources and services to the public," Congress passed the Cable
Communication Policy Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-549, 98 Stat. 2780.  47 U.S.C.   521.  This
Act required cable operators to set aside channels for leased access programming that the
operators were forbidden to censor.  Id.   532(b), (c)(2).  It also prohibited them from censoring
programming on the public, educational, and governmental ("PEG") access channels required
under cable franchise agreements.  Id.   531(e).  Because cable operators were barred from
exercising editorial control over these access channels, Congress explicitly shielded cable
operators from liability for access programming.  Id.   558.  In another provision of the Act,
Congress required operators to provide "lockboxes" that enable a subscriber to block any cable
channel during selected periods, id.   544(d)(2); this provision remains in effect.
<p>
     2.   The 1992 Cable Act.  In 1992, Congress again focused on the cable industry   this
time primarily to promote diversity through temporary rate re-regulation, address customer
service practices, and implement "must-carry" broadcast rules   and enacted the Cable Television
Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-385, 106 Stat. 1460.  On the
last legislative day before the Senate approved its bill, Senator Helms offered two floor
amendments and then-Senator Fowler offered a third that collectively became   10, entitled
"Children's Protection from Indecent Programming on Leased Access Channels."  Senator Helms
plainly stated the purpose of   10's liability provision:  to "put an end to the kind of things going
on" on access channels.  138 Cong. Rec. S652 (daily ed. Jan. 30, 1992).  No other provision in
the lengthy Senate or House bills even remotely treated "indecency" or protection of children. 
Section 10 was never sent to a committee and was never the subject of any congressional
hearings or findings.
<p>
     Section 10 established a censorship scheme with four interlocking parts.  Section 10(a)
authorized cable operators to ban from leased access channels what they "reasonably believe[]
describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as
measured by contemporary community standards."  Pet. 126a.  Cable operators were given, and
have, no other "editorial discretion" to regulate the content of leased access programming.  Pet.
126a; Stat. 2a-4a.
<p>
     Section 10(b), the stated purpose of which is "to limit the access of children to indecent
programming," required the Commission to prescribe rules requiring cable operators that have
not "voluntarily prohibited" programming under   10(a) to segregate all "indecent" leased access
programming on channels that must remain blocked until a subscriber requests access in writing;
Congress mandated no time period within which such requests must be satisfied.  Pet. 126a-27a. 
Section 10(b) also required the Commission to prescribe rules requiring leased access
programmers to identify for cable operators any of their programs that "would be indecent as
defined by Commission regulations."  Pet. 126a.
<p>
     Section 10(c) applied to PEG access channels and authorized cable operators to ban "any
programming which contains obscene material, sexually explicit conduct, or material soliciting
or promoting unlawful conduct."  Pet. 127a.  However, if a cable operator does not ban particular
"indecent" PEG programming, it may cablecast that programming without blocking, just as it
may cablecast "indecent" programming on its commercial channels without blocking (where it
functions as publisher rather than simply as conduit) and must cablecast such broadcast
programming without blocking.  See Pet. 127a.
<p>
     Section 10(d) eliminates cable operators' statutory immunity from liability for access
programming that "involves obscene material."  Pet. 127a.  Taken together with   10's other
provisions,   10(d) virtually compels cable operators to censor "indecency."
<p>
     3.   Comments to the Rule Making.  On November 10, 1992, the Commission issued a
notice of proposed rule making to implement   10 and requested comments.  Petitioners Denver
Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. ("DAETC"), which is a nonprofit leased
access cable programmer, and American Civil Liberties Union ("ACLU"), whose members
include leased and PEG access viewers (also collectively "petitioners"), submitted comments to
the Commission challenging the constitutionality of   10 and describing its impact on a wide
variety of access programming of serious journalistic or artistic value.
<p>
     Petitioners noted their concern with   10's capacious definition of "indecent
programming" as "describ[ing] or depict[ing] sexual or excretory activities or organs in a
patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards."  Pet. 126a. 
Because this definition has no substantive content except to subject all programming that
contains any mention of human reproduction or sexuality, regardless of its value, to a
retrospective assessment of "community standards" of "offensiveness," it encompasses a far
wider, but uncertain, range of programming than Senator Helms evidently envisioned from the
anecdotal examples he offered on the Senate floor.  Comments of DAETC, JA 203-04.  Even if
one could identify programming that actually contains "indecent" material,   10(a) exacerbates
the overbreadth of that definition by granting cable operators authority to prohibit programs that
they "reasonably believe" contain indecent material.  Reply Comments of DAETC, JA 330-31;
see Acton Corp., JA 1-2.
<p>
     Indeed, much of DAETC's socially useful programming would be swept up in   10's
broad definition of "indecency."  DAETC's cable access service, which is known as "The 90's
Channel" and is offered in a block of programming reaching approximately 500,000 households,
presents in a verit style a wide variety of material.  Its programming is often controversial and
otherwise unavailable and discusses topics including the Persian Gulf war, environmental
contamination, AIDS, racism, US-Cuba relations, art censorship, union organizing, the status of
recent immigrants, gay rights, the Palestinian uprising, issues of concern to Native Americans,
prostitution, and prison conditions.  Comments of DAETC, JA 199-201.  An important part of
DAETC's programming on many of these topics inextricably deals with sexuality, such as the
program segments about an organization that seeks to demystify gynecology and teach women
how to perform their own pelvic exams, the controversy surrounding a Robert Mapplethorpe art
exhibit, a pro-choice performance artist, and an annual Japanese fertility festival   all of which
might well fall within   10's broad regulatory definition of "indecency" or cable operators'
"reasonable beliefs" about "indecency."  Program Segments Carried by The 90's Channel Dealing
with Sexuality, JA 224-25; see Pet. 44a-45a (Wald, J., dissenting).
<p>
     In their comments to the Commission, cable operators expressed their concern that   10
offended the First Amendment.  Many commented that Congress' existing requirement of
lockboxes already satisfies the government's asserted interest in protecting  children from
"indecency," particularly in light of cable's status as an invitee in the home for which the
subscriber voluntarily pays a monthly fee.  Some commented that, although the bans authorized
by    10(a) and 10(c) are in form voluntary, the impact of   10 in many instances is likely to be a
de facto ban on the targeted, yet protected, speech.
<p>
     Local cable authorities complained that the proposed rules would deprive them of their
state-law rights to prohibit cable operators from controlling the content of cable access
programming, which many of them had exercised even before the Commission attempted to
mandate access channels in the 1970s.  City of St. Paul, JA 318-26; National Ass'n of
Telecommunications Officers & Advisors, JA 345; see Continental Cablevision, Inc., JA 181,
186-87 (requesting clarification that agreements prohibiting operator control of access channels
are preempted).
<p>
     4.   The Commission's Reports and Orders.  On February 3, 1993, the Commission
released its First Report, which adopted regulations to implement    10(a) and 10(b) relating to
leased access channels.  Pet. 128a.  Despite petitioners' and other comments, the Commission
defined "indecent" programming almost identically to the language used in   10(a), authorized a
cable operator to adopt and enforce a policy of banning leased access programming that it
"reasonably believes" contains indecency, and, if a cable operator does not voluntarily adopt and
enforce such a policy, required it to block all leased access programming that falls within the
Commission's definition of "indecency."  47 C.F.R.   76.701, Pet. 171a-72a.  Cable operators are
also allowed to delay for up to thirty days satisfying a subscriber's written request to receive
blocked programming.  Id.   76.701(c), Pet. 171a.
<p>
     The First Report's regulations further required leased access programmers to identify
whether any of their programming is indecent and to certify at the operator's request whether any
or all of their programming is indecent or obscene.  If a programmer fails to provide this
identification or certification in a timely fashion, the cable operator may cut off access to that
programmer altogether.  Id.   76.701(f), Pet. 172a.  If a cable operator (or a subscriber) disagrees
with a programmer's certification, the Commission "will entertain special relief petitions."  Pet.
167a-68a.  In order to exercise the censorship power delegated to them, cable operators are
further authorized to "pre-screen" all leased access programming.  Pet. 151a n.39.
<p>
     The Commission's Second Report adopted regulations to implement   10(c) relating to
PEG access channels.  Pet. 178a.  The Commission interpreted   10(c) to authorize cable
operators to prohibit obscene material, indecent material (defined as in the First Report, rather
than as   10(c)'s "sexually explicit material"), and material soliciting or promoting unlawful
conduct (interpreted by the Commission as "material that is otherwise proscribed by law").  47
C.F.R.   76.702, Pet. 197a-98a.  To further facilitate censorship of access programming, the
regulations provided that a cable operator may require a PEG access programmer "to certify that
its programming does not contain any of the materials" subject to   10(c) prohibition.  Id., Pet.
198a.  Additionally, the Commission stated that it would not consider disputes from subscribers
or PEG programmers complaining of undue censorship.  Pet. 194a.
<p>
     The Commission also determined in each of the reports and orders that   10 and its
implementing regulations preempt contrary state or local law and contrary provisions in cable
franchise agreements.  Pet. 157 n.44, 183a n.7.
<p>
     5.   The Proceedings Below.  Petitioners petitioned the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit for review pursuant to 28 U.S.C.   2342(1).  These petitions were
consolidated with others, and the Commission and the United States (collectively the
Commission or the "government") were respondents in each.
<p>
     After oral argument during which the government conceded that, if    10(a) and 10(c)
involved "state action," they would violate the First Amendment, Pet. 104a n.9, a panel of the
court unanimously struck down    10(a) and 10(c).  As to   10(b) and its implementing
regulations, the panel found such serious constitutional questions due to their apparent
underinclusiveness that it remanded them to the Commission for reconsideration.  Pet. 112a-25a.
<p>
     The full court vacated the panel's judgment, reheard the case en banc, and sustained   10
and the regulations over the dissent in whole or in part of four of the court's eleven judges.  Pet.
4a-5a.  The majority concluded   in an unprecedented holding   that the court could avoid
reaching petitioners' constitutional challenges to a content-based statute regulating protected
speech and the implementing regulations because they only authorize, rather than command,
private parties to ban the targeted speech and because those private acts cannot be attributed to
the government.  Pet. 11a-27a.  As to   10(b), which compels blocking in the absence of banning
on leased access channels, the majority held, despite the absence of legislative or administrative
support, that it is the least restrictive means to serve the "compelling" interest in shielding minors
from "indecent" speech, Pet. 32a-36a, and cursorily determined that   10 is not impermissibly
vague, Pet. 42a-43a.
<p>
     In her dissenting opinion joined in full by Judge Tatel, Judge Wald pointed out that   
10(a) and 10(b) must be considered together as part of one scheme regulating leased access
programming, which, rather than "restore" editorial control to cable operators, requires them
either to ban or block "indecent programming" and, as such, is clearly subject to First
Amendment scrutiny.  Pet. 46a-53a.  Now also joined by Judge Rogers, Judge Wald concluded
that    10(a) and 10(b) unconstitutionally cause a deprivation of First Amendment rights because
of their undue burden on both speakers and listeners, Pet. 54a-58a, and are not the least
restrictive means of achieving the asserted compelling interest because of the ready availability
of less restrictive means, such as the existing lockbox requirement, Pet. 66a-71a.  Additionally,
Judge Wald found that   10(c), with its governmentally imposed definitions of disfavored speech
and its erection of a separate statutory scheme to regulate such speech, clearly constitutes
governmental action and is not the least restrictive means of achieving the asserted compelling
interest.  Pet. 71a-75a.
<p>
     Chief Judge Edwards dissented in part and found that    10(a) and 10(b), which must be
read together, involve government action (while   10(c) does not) and that they work in tandem
to produce an impermissible ban on protected speech.  Pet. 77a-81a.  Chief Judge Edwards also
questioned whether the government's asserted interest in shielding minors from "indecency" was
compelling.  Pet. 82a-84a.  Judge Rogers, concurring in part and dissenting in part, agreed that  
10(b) is unconstitutional, but argued that it is severable from    10(a) and 10(c).  Pet. 85a-88a.
<p>
<a name="sum"><b>SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT</b></a>
<p>
     Section 10 and its implementing regulations cannot escape constitutional scrutiny
because laws regulating speech and discriminating on the basis of content and speaker identity
are subject to review regardless of whether every action taken under them is state action. 
Congress, through 28 U.S.C.     2342-49, directed the courts to "determine the validity" of all
Commission regulations, which necessarily requires resolution of constitutional challenges. 
Moreover,  10 preempts state laws banning operator censorship of access channels and
establishes the Commission as a joint participant in the censorship scheme.  (Point I.)
<p>
     Section 10 and its implementing regulations are invalid because they authorize operators
to ban disfavored speech under impermissibly vague standards and without the procedural
safeguards required of all laws that authorize the prohibition of speech based on its content.  FCC
v. Pacifica Found., 438 U.S. 726 (1978), is not to the contrary, because, in an adjudicative (rather
than facial) challenge, it narrowly addressed the permissibility of an "indecent language"
standard and did so only in the context of channeling.  Here, however, private delegates are
ordered to segregate and block a completely vague category of "patently offensive"
"programming" (not merely "language") if they do not prohibit it outright on a "reasonable
belief" that it is "indecent," all without administrative or judicial superintendence.  (Point II.)
<p>
     Finally,    10 is invalid because it imposes new censorship and other substantial burdens
on protected speech due to its content and the identity of its speakers.  Moreover, assuming
further scrutiny is necessary,    10's application to far more speech than might be harmful to
minors, the underinclusiveness of the blocking requirement (cable operators are free to continue
cablecasting identical speech on PEG and commercial channels without blocking), and the
availability of less restrictive but equally effective alternatives (such as lockboxes and blocking
on request) doom the censorship system that    10 created for access channels.  (Point III.)
<p>
     <a name="arg"><b>ARGUMENT</b></a>
<p>
     Cable programmers "engage in and transmit speech, and they are entitled to the
protection of the speech and press provisions of the First Amendment" when they create and
disseminate " original programming . . . on a wide variety of topics and in a wide variety of
formats.'"  Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2456 (citation omitted).
<p>
     Their speech is no less protected when it touches on sex.  As this Court held in Roth v.
United States, 354 U.S. 476, 487 (1957), "[t]he portrayal of sex, e.g., in art, literature and
scientific works, is not itself sufficient reason to deny material the constitutional protection of
freedom of speech and press.  Sex, a great and mysterious motive force in human life, has
indisputably been a subject of absorbing interest to mankind through the ages; it is one of the
vital problems of human interest and public concern."
<p>
     Given    10's extraordinarily sweeping definition of "indecency" and authorization to
censor speech upon a "reasonable belief" that that broad definition is met (see Point II below),
this case must be decided in full recognition that    10 imperils the presentation of speech of
substantial artistic, literary, scientific, medical, educational, and social importance:  speech that is
protected not only for adults, but for teenagers as well.  The measure of the threatened speech is
the capacious, subjective language of    10 and the unsuperintended discretion it affords, not the
anecdotal allegations with which sponsors regaled Congress during the brief hours that    10 was
considered.  Cf. Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling, 505 U.S. 469, 475 (1992); West Virginia
Univ. Hosps., Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.S. 83, 97-98 (1991).
<p>
I.  All of Section 10 Is Impermissibly Content-Based, and No Part Can Be Immunized from
Constitutional Review by the State Action Doctrine.
<p>
     Recognizing (indeed conceding at oral argument below, Pet. 104a n.9) that      10(a) and
10(c) could not pass muster under the First Amendment, the government attempts to avoid
constitutional scrutiny altogether.  Remarkably, the en banc majority decided that it need "not
reach petitioners' First Amendment attack on sections 10(a) and 10(c)," because "a private cable
operator may refuse to carry indecent programming without having its decision tested by First
Amendment principles applicable to the government alone."  Pet. 31a; see Pet. 11a-12a. 
However, because a cable operator may censor only under the authority and to the limited extent
Congress devised in      10(a) and 10(c), the court's holding is indefensible, and its reasoning is a
non sequitur.
<p>
     All statutes are subject to constitutional constraint and, therefore, necessarily to
constitutional review.  Properly analyzed, this case presents no state action issue at all, and    10
is subject, in its entirety, to strict scrutiny.
<p><blockquote>
A.   The Court Must Determine the Validity of Section 10.
<p></blockquote>
     The First Amendment provides that "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the
freedom of speech, or of the press."  Section 10 is plainly such a law and, thus, is subject to "the
most exacting scrutiny," according to a long line of cases concerning "regulations that suppress,
disadvantage, or impose differential burdens upon speech because of its content," Turner, 114 S.
Ct. at 2459 (emphasis added), as well as cases concerning laws that directly burden expression.
<p>
     Before    10's enactment, federal law and many state and local laws and agreements
prohibited cable operators from interfering in any manner with programming on access channels,
regardless of content, because access channels' very raison d'tre is to establish a forum in which
persons other than large media companies can speak to the public in one of the Nation's most
important mediums of communication.  Now, however,
<p><blockquote>
     section 10(a) authorizes and encourages cable operators to ban speech depending on its
content  i.e., programming that the operator "reasonably believes" to be "indecent" (a term
Congress and the Commission defined)  and only if such programming is offered by a leased
access cable programmer;
<p>
     section 10(c) authorizes and encourages cable operators to ban speech depending on its
content  i.e., programming that is "sexually explicit" or "solicits or promotes unlawful conduct"
 and only if such programming is offered by a PEG access cable programmer;
<p>
     sections 10(a) and 10(b) require cable operators either to promulgate and enforce written
policies banning speech believed to be indecent on leased access channels or to block such
programming pursuant to Commission regulations;
<p>
     sections 10(a) and 10(c) authorize cable operators to pre-screen access programming for
the sole purpose of ferreting out material that either they believe to be "indecent" or that
"promotes" unlawful conduct; and
<p>
     sections 10(a), 10(b), and 10(c) preempt all state and local laws, and all franchise or other
agreements entered into pursuant to those laws, that prohibit cable operators from pre-screening,
banning, blocking, or otherwise interfering with speech on access channels.
Given those provisions, the content- and speaker-based lines they embody, and the stated
purposes of the bill's sponsors,      10(a) and 10(c) are core candidates for the exacting First
Amendment review required by Turner and the cases cited above at 14 n.15.  
<p></blockquote>
     The court of appeals' contrary conclusion was premised on the fact that the actor directly
undertaking the newly authorized censorship decisions would be a private party, thereby
rendering successful Senator Helms' attempt to craft anti-"indecency" legislation that would
escape First Amendment scrutiny.  But it has long been the rule, both in cases challenging
Commission action, see Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, 415-17
(1942), and elsewhere, that courts consider the harm that laws and rules are likely to cause,
regardless of who "directly" causes the harm.
<p>
     "[I]n passing upon constitutional questions the court has regard to substance and not to
mere matters of form, and . . . the statute must be tested by its operation and effect."  Near v.
Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 708 (1931); accord Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts
Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U.S. 238, 255 (1986) (plurality opinion) ("The fact that the statute's
practical effect may be to discourage protected speech is sufficient to characterize [it] as an
infringement on First Amendment activities").
<p>
     Nothing in Turner or in any other case delineating the kinds of laws subject to exacting
scrutiny suggests that a properly presented constitutional challenge can be not reached simply
because the harms flowing from statutory implementation flow through private parties.
<p>
     Cases in other constitutional contexts make the same point and have subjected statutes to
scrutiny even where no harm would have occurred unless a third party did something that it was
authorized (but not compelled) to do.  For example, this Court invalidated a statute authorizing
cable operators to invade apartment buildings, even though the statute did not direct any entry
whatsoever and merely "adjusted" property rights, leaving cable operators free to enter or not. 
Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982).  Similarly, this Court
struck under the Establishment Clause a statute authorizing churches and schools to veto
applications for certain liquor licenses, even though churches are not state actors and were free to
use the veto or not.  Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U.S. 116 (1982).
<p>
     The court of appeals' decision to "not reach" petitioners' First Amendment challenge, Pet.
31a, disregards the very provisions pursuant to which this action is brought.  Congress directed
the courts of appeals, in 28 U.S.C.      2342, 2344, and 2349, to "determine the validity of . . . all
final orders of the Federal Communications Commission," 28 U.S.C.    2342(1), and "make and
enter . . . a judgment determining the validity of . . . the order of the agency," id.    2349(a).
<p>
     The courts could not "determine the validity" of the Commission's final rules, however,
without considering properly presented constitutional challenges.  See Marbury v. Madison, 5
U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803).  Indeed, it is axiomatic that in every proper case it is the court's duty
"to say what the law is" and to refuse to give effect to a statute or regulation that violates the
Constitution.  Id. at 177.  That is why this Court has routinely considered constitutional
challenges in cases brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C.    2342 (or its predecessor), without ever
pausing to see "whether state action is present."  See, e.g., Midwest Video, 440 U.S. 689; FCC v.
National Citizens Comm. for Broadcasting, 436 U.S. 775 (1978); Columbia Broadcasting Sys.,
Inc. v. Democratic Nat'l Comm., 412 U.S. 94 (1973); National Broadcasting Co. v. United
States, 319 U.S. 190, 226 (1943).
<p>
     For the court of appeals not to "reach" the challenge to      10(a) and 10(c)  not even to
decide whether the First Amendment forbids Congress from delegating to private parties the
authority that they had theretofore lacked to censor speech depending on its content  violates
both    2342 and the obligation to say "what the law is" in a proper case.
<p>
     The en banc court asserted that    10 was not subject to review under the First
Amendment because "it simply adjusted editorial authority between two private groups."  Pet.
15a (emphasis added).  So characterizing    10 does not support an abdication of judicial review. 
Just the contrary, a legislative "adjustment" of who will have the right to speak would seem to
provide a core occasion for review.  See PruneYard Shopping Ctr. v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74 (1980)
(rejecting on the merits a claim that state's adjustment of right to speak on private property
violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments); Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418
U.S. 241 (1974) (upholding on the merits a challenge to state adjustment of right to speak in print
publication); Columbia Broadcasting Sys. v. Democratic Nat'l Comm., 412 U.S. 94 (rejecting on
the merits a claim that the First Amendment required change in the existing distribution of
speech rights on public airwaves).
<p>
     This Court has insisted that "where legislative abridgment of [First Amendment] rights is
asserted, the courts should be astute to examine the effect of the challenged legislation" and
decide its constitutionality in "every case."  Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 161 (1939)
(emphasis added).  The court of appeals disobeyed that mandate here when it chose to "not
reach" petitioners' First Amendment attack on sections 10(a) and 10(c).  Pet. 31a.
<p><blockquote>
B.   The Issue Is Whether Section 10 Violates the Constitution, Not Whether Particular
Censorship Decisions of Cable Operators Would Be State Action.
<blockquote>
     1.   The state action doctrine is inapposite.
<p></blockquote>
     Petitioners' challenge to the constitutionality of    10 poses no state action question, and
none need be resolved.  The state action doctrine arises when a private party's actions are claimed
to be subject to constitutional constraint, an issue this case does not raise.  It has no relevance to
any question of whether particular statutes are somehow insulated from constitutional review.
<p>
     Neither the court of appeals' lengthy discussion, nor any brief that the Commission
submitted, cites any case refusing to reach a properly presented constitutional challenge to a
statute or regulation upon a determination that actions taken pursuant thereto would not be "state
action."  Petitioners have not found a single case holding that a constitutional challenge to a
statute need not be reached on state action grounds.
<p>
     The court seemed to believe Reitman v. Mulkey, 387 U.S. 369 (1967), supported its
decision, Pet. 16a-17a, but it does just the opposite.  Reitman's relevant teaching is not so much
the 5-4 decision on the merits, but the Court's unanimous decision to reach the constitutionality
of the state constitutional amendment repealing fair housing statutes and making future ones
more difficult to enact.  Although on the merits the four dissenting justices disagreed sharply,
they found "no question that the adoption of    26 . . . constituted  state action' within the meaning
of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The only issue is whether this provision impermissibly deprives
any person of equal protection of the laws."  387 U.S. at 392 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (emphasis
added).
<p>
     To the same effect is San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic
Comm., 483 U.S. 522 (1987), another decision on which the government inexplicably relied. 
The relevant portion of that case is the disposition on the merits of the facial challenge to a
statute as violative of free speech rights, even though no speech would have even been arguably
impaired unless a private party took the action that the statute authorized but did not compel. 
Because the constitutionality of a federal statute was challenged, the Court was obliged to reach
and decide the merits of the First Amendment attack, and every member of the Court did.
<p>
     This Court has insisted on "careful attention to the gravamen of the plaintiff's complaint"
in considering state action issues.  Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1003 (1982).  Here, the
petitions for review challenged the validity of    10 and its implementing regulations under   
2342 and did not raise the question whether "the operators' exercise of . . . discretion [is] state
action subject to the First Amendment," Pet. 15a (as posed by the en banc court).
<p>
     2.   Section 10 does not "restore" rights to cable operators, and a partial restoration is
constitutionally reviewable in any event.
<p>
     The court of appeals' decision to "not reach" petitioners' challenge to      10(a) and 10(c)
rested largely on its assumption that Congress had merely "restored" to cable operators some
"editorial control" that they supposedly had over access channels prior to the 1984 Act.  Pet.
13a-17a.  That assumption is factually wrong and would not, in any event, justify letting    10
escape judicial review.
<p>
     Access channels are creatures of state or federal law or local franchise agreement, for
which cable operators function simply as conduits and over which they never had editorial
control.  Even prior to 1984, state law (the source of property rights) and franchise agreements
generally required access channels and prohibited cable operator censorship thereof, even before
any given system was even constructed.  See above at 2, 3.  The Commission's early regulations
carving out an exception to this no-censorship rule for "obscene or indecent" programming were
a mandate, not a grant of editorial discretion, and never even went into effect, having been
recognized as flatly unconstitutional.  See above at 3 n.1.  Judge Randolph was therefore
mistaken when he relied on a supposed pre-1984 state-of-nature where operators had editorial
control over alleged indecency on cable access.  Pet. 14a.  Moreover, as to leased access,    10
cannot fairly be characterized as restoring "editorial control"; rather, it permits only a highly
constrained choice between two speech-limiting alternatives.  Pet. 47a (Wald, J., dissenting).
<p>
     But even assuming arguendo that Congress could grant cable operators full editorial
control over locally created PEG access channels and over leased access channels without
violating the First Amendment, it may not partially and selectively grant editorial control in a
way that suppresses, disadvantages, or imposes differential burdens on speech because of its
content.  Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2459.  "[E]ven a traffic regulation cannot discriminate on the basis
of content . . . ."  Erznoznik, 422 U.S. at 215; e.g., Simon & Schuster, 502 U.S. at 116 ("the
government's ability to impose content-based burdens on speech raises the specter that the
government may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace"); Leathers
v. Medlock, 499 U.S. 439, 448-49 (1991).
<p>
     If the constitutional rule were otherwise, no court could consider and decide a First
Amendment challenge to a statute selectively "restoring" the rights of cable operators to censor
on access channels the speech of African-Americans or socialists or speech opposing reduction
of welfare grants.  Actions taken under the authorization of such a statute would be merely
"restoration," not state action, and the statute itself would (under the court's reasoning) be
"immunized" from constitutional challenge.  But such statutes are, of course, facially
unconstitutional and subject to judicial review in a proper challenge, regardless of whether the
cable operator's censorship as authorized by statute would itself violate the Constitution.
<p>
     In short, as Judge Wald observed (Pet. 50a n.4), the court of appeals erred in supposing
that whether a law is subject to review under the Constitution, and whether all action taken under
its cloak is state action, are the same question.
<p>
     3.   Section 10 cannot escape constitutional scrutiny, because it preempts contrary
state law, significantly encourages content-based censorship, and embroils the Commission as a
joint participant in the censorship scheme.
<p>
     Additional factors confirm beyond doubt that    10 is subject to constitutional scrutiny. 
First,    10 is subject to review (or, in the court of appeals' imprecise formulation, "state action is
present") because it preempts contrary state law.  Railway Employes' Dep't v. Hanson, 351 U.S.
225 (1956).
<p>
     In Hanson, a group of employees, who chose not to join a union in reliance on the
Nebraska "right-to-work" law, sued their company and its union over the inclusion of a
closed-shop agreement in the labor contract, which they claimed violated their First Amendment
rights.  Even though the Railway Labor Act had merely authorized, but in no way required, the
challenged closed-shop agreement, and even though the decision to require one was made by the
union and company alone, this Court unanimously agreed that the constitutional question
tendered had to be decided.  "If private rights are being invaded, it is by force of an agreement
made pursuant to federal law which expressly declares that state law is superseded."  351 U.S. at
232.
<p>
     Section 10 is subject to review under Hanson, because it is similarly preempting and
subjects programmers to censorship despite otherwise enforceable state law rights (including
municipal franchises) to be free from such censorship.  Second Report, Pet. 183a n.7.
<p>
     Second, the reviewability of      10(a) and 10(c) follows a fortiori from Skinner v.
Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989).  Skinner subjected to constitutional
scrutiny a statute that permitted (but did not compel) private drug testing, noting that "the
Government did more than adopt a passive position towards the underlying private conduct."  Id.
at 615; see also Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. at 1004 (government's "significant encouragement"
of private conduct creates state action); Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455, 465 (1973) (" a state
may not induce, encourage or promote private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally
forbidden to accomplish'") (citation omitted).  As in Skinner, the government has in    10 adopted
more than a passive position, for it has imposed definitions of disfavored speech and erected a
separate statutory scheme to regulate such speech.
<p>
     Finally,      10(a) and 10(b) establish a comprehensive scheme to censor "indecency" on
leased access channels with private cable operators and the Commission playing interlocking
roles:  the Commission defines indecency, resolves certain disputes over its application, and
prescribes blocking and segregation requirements, while the cable operators determine what
programming falls within their "reasonable belief" of indecency and decide whether to ban or
block such programming pursuant to the choice Congress has imposed.  Such a joint enterprise
between government and private actors is subject to constitutional scrutiny.  See Skinner, 489
U.S. at 615; Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24, 27-28 (1980); Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S.
144, 152 (1970).
<p></blockquote>
II. Section 10 Is Unconstitutional Because It Authorizes and Requires Censorship under Vague
Standards and Lacks Essential Procedural Safeguards.
<p>
     To ensure the "[p]recision of regulation" that "must be the touchstone" when free
expression is concerned, NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 438 (1963), laws regulating speech
must not be vague and must include procedural safeguards to secure the prompt restoration of
protected speech when it has been improperly censored.  Section 10 fails both requirements.
<p><blockquote>
A.   Section 10 Is Completely Vague.
<blockquote><p>
     1.  Laws that inhibit free speech are subject to the most "stringent" standards of precision. 
Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 499 (1982); Cramp
v. Board of Pub. Instruction, 368 U.S. 278, 287 (1961).  Vague laws touching speech invite
over-censorship and viewpoint-based enforcement by granting censors "unbridled discretion." 
See, e.g., Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 132 (1992); Southeastern
Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 553 (1975) (condemning denial of access to a
municipal theater where "the exercise of such authority was not bounded by precise and clear
standards"); Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 574-75 (1974).
<p>
     Vague laws also pose an unacceptable risk of self-censorship, because speakers who
cannot discern clear lines will " steer far wider of the unlawful zone' than they would if the
boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked."  Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 372
(1964) (quoting Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526 (1958)); see Grayned v. City of Rockford,
408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972) (vague laws fail to "give the person of ordinary intelligence a
reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly"); see also
Gentile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U.S. 1030, 1051 (1991).
<p>
     Thus, vague laws attempting to regulate or suppress non-obscene speech have been
repeatedly struck down, even when enacted to protect minors.  Illustrative is Interstate Circuit,
Inc. v. City of Dallas, 390 U.S. 676 (1968), where this Court invalidated an ordinance requiring
film classification and prohibiting attendance by youths under 16 at films classified "not suitable
for young persons."  Although the "not suitable" standard had been fleshed out   defined as
"describing or portraying nudity beyond the customary limits of candor in the community, or
sexual promiscuity or extra-marital or abnormal sexual relations in such a manner as to be, in the
judgment of the Board, likely to incite or encourage delinquency or sexual promiscuity on the
part of young persons or to appeal to their prurient interest," id. at 681   eight members of the
Court concluded that, in the end, " [t]he only limits on the censor's discretion is his
understanding of what is included within the term "desirable, acceptable or proper."  This is
nothing less than a roving commission.'"  Id. at 688 (citation omitted).
<p>
     Interstate Circuit rejected the argument that a vague standard was permissible so long as
"it was adopted for the salutary purpose of protecting children."  Id. at 689.  "The permissible
extent of vagueness is not directly proportional to, or a function of, the extent of the power to
regulate or control expression with respect to children."  Id.  Rather, it depends on the harm to
free expression, regardless of an assertedly narrow interest in protecting children.
<p>
     [A] local exhibitor who cannot afford to risk losing the youthful audience . . . may
contract to show only the totally inane.  The vast wasteland that some have described in reference
to another medium might be a verdant paradise in comparison.  The First Amendment interests
here are, therefore, broader than merely those of the film maker, distributor, and exhibitor, and
certainly broader than those of youths under 16.
Id. at 684.
<p>
     2.  Section 10's fulcrum is the phrase "indecent programming," defined as "any
programming that describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently
offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards for the cable medium."  47
C.F.R.    76.701(g), Pet. 172a.  Programmers must identify "any programming that is indecent"
on pain of a damoclean array of sanctions and remedies that include censorship of individual
programs, financial penalties, and denial of access to a program provider in the future.  Id.   
76.701(f), Pet. 172a; see also First Report, Pet. 168a.  Operators are given wide discretion to
require more, including certifications that particular programming (or all programming) is not
"indecent" or that "reasonable efforts" will be undertaken to "insure" that indecent live
programming will be prevented.  Id.    76.701(e), Pet. 172a; id.    76.702, Pet. 197a-98a. 
Operators may suppress or must block "indecent programming" and may pre-screen in order to
do so.  Id.    76.701(a), Pet. 171a; id.    76.702, Pet. 197a-98a; First Report, Pet. 151a n.39.
<p>
     The definition of "indecent" under    10 is substantially more vague than the familiar
three-part test upheld against a vagueness challenge by a 5-4 decision in Miller v. California, 413
U.S. 15 (1973), because it utterly dispenses with two parts of that triangulated test. 
Programmers, operators, and indeed the Commission and courts are deprived of the substantial
instruction and constraint that Miller affords by restricting obscenity to "hard-core pornography,"
and then to only those patently offensive works that, "as a whole, appeal to the prurient interest"
and, "taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value."  Id. at
24.  Unlike the hard-core pornography to which Miller restricted itself, a category that Justice
Stewart memorably described with the phrase "I know it when I see it," Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378
U.S. 184, 197 (1964) (concurring opinion), "indecency" encompasses a broad and undefined
category that appears to extend far beyond even "soft-core" pornography and that no member of
this Court has ever suggested is recognizable on sight.
<p>
     Just as there is no telling how a stool with two of its three legs sawed off will land, no one
can know what may be proscribed when "indecency" means only what is "patently offensive" by
"contemporary community standards":  terms that prescribe no ascertainable standard of conduct
at all and are, therefore, "perfectly vague."  See, e.g., Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. at 573
(invalidating a law barring "contemptuous" treatment of the flag, because " [w]hat is
contemptuous to one man may be a work of art to another'") (citation omitted); Coates v.
Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611, 614 (1971) (ordinance barring "annoying" conduct is "vague, not in the
sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible
normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all").
<p>
     Moreover,    10 regulates speech exclusively on a basis ("offensiveness") that this Court
has repeatedly said is constitutionally impermissible.  See, e.g., Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. at
414 (government "may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the
idea itself offensive or disagreeable"); Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 25 (1971) ("the State
has no right to cleanse public debate" of certain "offensive" words); Bolger, 463 U.S. at 71
("offensiveness" is not a justification for suppressing expression).
<p>
     Comments from cable operators show precisely how widely these delegate censors will
steer, untethered by any clear and ascertainable standard.  E.g., Acton Corp., JA 1-2; Community
Antenna Television Ass'n, Inc., JA 175-76; NYNEX Tel. Cos., JA 377, 383-84; see also
Goldstein v. Manhattan Cable Television, Inc., No. 90 Civ. 4750, 1995 WL 562182 (S.D.N.Y.
Sept. 20, 1995).  The wages of imprecision will be the routine suppression of fully protected
speech   not just "obscenity lite," but speech of substantial value, Pet. 44a-45a & n.1 (Wald, J.,
dissenting)   and the contraction of what is available to "the totally inane."  Interstate Circuit, 390
U.S. at 684.  The opportunity for cable access channels to offer viewers some relief from the
"vast wasteland" on broadcast and most operator-programmed channels   to see the works of
artists such as Courbet or Rodin or Picasso (some of which depict sexual organs), or films like
Putney Swope (with a classic scene at the urinal) or Carnal Knowledge (found protected in
Jenkins v. Georgia, 418 U.S. 153 (1974)), or educational works on breast or testicular
self-examination   would be further diminished, or dashed.
<p>
     Section 10's self-certification requirements magnify the chilling effect, as this Court's
prior cases invalidating oaths disclaiming certain kinds of speech attest.  Baggett v. Bullitt, 377
U.S. at 372 ("uncertain meanings of . . . oaths require the oath-taker . . . to  steer far wider of the
unlawful zone'") (citation omitted); Cramp v. Board, 368 U.S. at 286; see also Bella Lewitzky
Dance Found. v. Frohnmayer, 754 F. Supp. 774, 782-83 (C.D. Cal. 1991).
<p>
     The consequence of the over-aggressive deployment of the operator's or the
Commission's imprecise censorial power, or even a programmer's wrong guess, is not merely
channeling certain language to a later hour, as in Pacifica, 438 U.S. 726, or even a stay of
cablecasting pending prompt judicial review.  Rather, the consequence is a final restraint of
protected speech for adults as well as children:  speech that the programmer has a constitutional
right to present and viewers to receive.  Such DAETC programs as a cinema verit self-help
gynecological exam, a documentary on arts censorship, or a traditional Japanese fertility festival
featuring a procession of markers with images of human genitalia (JA 224-25) would surely
court suppression by operators under such a standard, regardless of whether, at the end of years
of litigation (assuming that DAETC had the resources to pursue it), an operator's belief that
programming was "indecent" was found unreasonable.
<p>
     There are still other aspects in which the cable "indecency" standard is patently vague. 
First, and crucially important from the standpoint of vagueness, the "reasonable belief" standard
in    10(a) substantially exacerbates the statute's imprecision and potential for discriminatory
enforcement.  Unlike the Commission's broadcast indecency standard, which is at least applied
by one agency,    10(a)'s invitation is to censor not only the "indecent" (as it might be measured
judicially) but also what an operator "reasonably believes" is indecent:  a far bigger kettle of fish. 
Imprecision and self-censorship are therefore multiplied.  See Schwartz Decl., JA 390, 392-94. 
Doubly subjective judgments are particularly indeterminate.  Big Mama Rag, 631 F.2d at
1037-38; Stanton v. Brunswick Sch. Dep't, 577 F. Supp. 1560, 1574 (D. Me. 1984).  Thus, this
Court in Interstate Circuit, striking down as vague a movie classification ordinance, pointed
particularly to the ordinance's relegation of decision-making to "the judgment of the
[classification] Board."  390 U.S. at 681.  Likewise, in Bella Lewitzky, 754 F. Supp. at 781-82,
the court invalidated as vague the NEA's obscenity oath because it relied on the agency's
unreviewable "judgment" as to what is obscene.
<p>
     The cable "indecency" standard is "based on the  average cable subscriber' . . . not
confined to a specific geographical area or specific cable system."  First Report, Pet. 148a-49a. 
This Court has recognized, however, that "our Nation is simply too big and too diverse for this
Court to reasonably expect that such standards [as  patently offensive'] could be articulated for all
50 States in a single formulation, even assuming the prerequisite consensus exists."  Miller v.
California, 413 U.S. at 30.  Both cable operators and programmers are left wholly without
guidance as to who such an "average cable subscriber" is and how the standard relates to current
cable programming in Los Angeles, Kalamazoo, New York, or Salt Lake City.
<p>
     Finally, the dangers of arbitrary action, and indeed self-censorship, are magnified because
under    10 operators need not prohibit or block comparably "indecent" programs on their own
channels, and, thus, access programmers cannot gain any useful guidance or comfort from
comparing their own programming to other programs carried on the system.  The presence of any
comparable or even more sexually explicit program is absolutely no assurance that a cable
operator or the Commission would not find an access program to be "indecent."
<p></blockquote>
B.   Pacifica Is Not Controlling.
<blockquote><p>
     1.   FCC v. Pacifica Found., 438 U.S. 726 (1978), does not foreclose petitioners'
vagueness challenge to    10's definition of "indecency."  Its "emphatically narrow" holding
addressed only the facts of that particular adjudication (the monologue "as broadcast"), stressed
that the seven words at issue were at the very core of the statutory proscription, and expressly
disclaimed any opinion on the facial validity of the "indecency" standard of 18 U.S.C.    1464. 
The Court noted that no sanctions had been imposed or would be "without warning."  Id. at 743. 
The Court narrowed its decision even further by expressly limiting its fact-specific ruling to the
broadcast medium and to a nuisance (channelling) rationale.  Id. at 750; see Sable, 492 U.S. at
127-28 (Pacifica was "an emphatically narrow holding"); Bolger, 463 U.S. at 74.
  <p>
   Pacifica did not purport to overrule the vagueness cases cited above at 25-26.  It did not
consider a "reasonably believes" standard heaped onto an "indecency" standard or the
authorization of a total ban.  Nor did it consider "indecency" under the shadow of the
Commission's since-greatly expanded sense of what falls within that rubric: not just dirty words,
but, as the record shows here, speech of serious value, whose very merit will [often] be inseparable from its seminal "offensiveness."  A bowdlerized documentary on the Mapplethorpe exhibit which did not include some description or depiction of Mapplethorpe's sexually explicit photographs themselves, for example, would hardly be an
informative statement on the artistic and political debate the exhibit engendered.
Pet. 45a (Wald, J., dissenting).  By contrast, Justice Stevens' plurality opinion in Pacifica reveals
time and again that it was considering "indecent language"; not, as    10 and its regulations do,
"indecent programming."
<p>
     In short, Pacifica simply did not decide whether "indecency" as defined here by Congress
and the Commission is sufficiently definite for a scheme of delegated censorship under a
"reasonable belief" standard that escapes judicial and even administrative superintendence.
<p>
     2.   If Pacifica were found to have decided the vagueness question, it should be
reconsidered and overruled.  Whatever national consensus might have permitted anyone to find
seven dirty words patently offensive as broadcast in the mid-afternoon 20 years ago cannot
render the Commission's    10 indecency standard sufficiently precise for now and beyond. 
Times and mores have changed.  Ask any ten Americans from different communities what is
patently offensive to the average cable subscriber, and you will have ten answers.  Those in their
20's would give vastly different answers than their grandparents.
<p>
     Sexual politics, i.e., discussions of relationships between and among the sexes, have
become a major issue for public debate.  Public proceedings concerning sexual harassment and
"date rape" are broadcast or cablecast on television.  Depiction of "sexual organs" are
commonplace, not only in "adult" materials, but in mainstream magazines, advertisements, and
motion pictures.  The Simpsons, enjoyed by millions of children and adults on broadcast TV,
recently (December 3) showed each family member in the buff and Bart engaging in an
"excretory activity."  In the film ET, which millions of young children watch on video cassette in
the home, one child calls another "penis-breath."  The speech of artists and journalists, and of
many from all walks of life whose voices are not otherwise heard on broadcast and most cable
systems, also frequently embraces such politically sexual issues as rape and domestic violence,
safe sex, and, indeed, the nature of sexuality itself.  See David Cole, Playing by Pornography's
Rules:  The Regulation of Sexual Expression, 143 U. Pa. L. Rev. 111, 125 (1994).
<p>
     The rationales underlying the plurality opinion in Pacifica have substantially weakened
since 1978.  The current viability of the "pig in the parlor" rationale is questionable in light of the
availability of lockboxes and other parental control mechanisms.  Moreover, in contrast to the
plurality's relegation of "indecent" language to diminished constitutional status, the Court's
subsequent majority decision in Sable establishes that indecent but not obscene expression has
full First Amendment protection.
<p>
     Petitioners see no occasion here for reconsidering Pacifica, but if the Court concludes that
that case controls this vagueness challenge, then Pacifica should be limited to its facts or
overruled.
<p></blockquote>
C.   Section 10 Lacks Essential Procedural Safeguards.
<p>
     The immediate, intended, and direct impact of a cable operator's exercise of the
censorship power created by    10 is to restrain protected speech permanently and in advance of
its communication.  In      10(a) and 10(c), Congress authorized cable operators to censor outright
protected speech:  not only speech that is asserted (but has never been judicially found) to be
"indecent," but also the substantially broader category of speech that the operator "reasonably
believes" to be indecent.  Congress and the Commission did precisely what this Court has
repeatedly condemned:  they gave censors "wide discretion" to restrain speech depending on
their predilections.
<p>
     Thus, "[c]able operators may, if they choose, pre-screen programming as a means to
enforce any cable operator policies adopted under the authority of section 10(a)."  Second
Report, Pet. 151a n.39.  This is the classic form of prior restraint, under a long line of cases
condemning the power to pre-screen and prohibit absent specific procedures, which are entirely
unavailable here.
<p>
     Less bluntly but just as surely,    10(b), too, interdicts speech that willing viewers would
otherwise access.  To the extent that cable operators do not prohibit all indecent speech on leased
access channels, they must withhold it from every subscriber unless the subscriber requests the
speech, and even then for an additional thirty days.  47 C.F.R.    76.701(d), Pet. 171a.
<p>
     Because this system of content-based prohibitions, restraints, and delays is
"indistinguishable in its censoring effect from the official actions consistently identified as prior
restraints in a long line of this Court's decisions," it " avoids constitutional infirmity only if it
takes place under procedural safeguards designed to obviate the dangers of a censorship system.'" 
Southeastern Promotions, 420 U.S. at 552, 559 (quoting Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. at 58).
<p>
     First, the burden of instituting judicial proceedings, and of proving that the material is
unprotected, must rest on the censor.  Second, any restraint prior to judicial review can be
imposed only for a specialized brief period and only for the purpose of preserving the status quo. 
Third, a prompt final judicial determination must be assured.
Id. at 560 (discussing Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51).
<p>
     Section 10's censorship scheme lacks each of those requirements.  The censor bears no
burden of promptly instituting judicial (or any other) proceedings.  Under    10, a cable operator,
having pre-screened or obtained information about a program, simply censors it, thereby
suppressing it to all viewers, or blocks it, thereby suppressing it to all blocked viewers unless
they learn of the program and request it at least thirty days in advance.  The viewer or
programmer, not the operator, must "assume the burden of instituting judicial proceedings and of
persuading the courts that the [program] is protected expression," Freedman v. Maryland, 380
U.S. at 59-60, assuming arguendo that there is a cause of action to challenge particular acts of
censorship.  The operator's censorship is thus final, not provisional or brief, expressly so under
     10(a) and 10(c) and as a practical matter under    10(b).  Given the absence of any provision
for "judicial superintendence" at all, there is naturally no provision for prompt judicial review to
restore free speech rights when they have been "erroneously denied."
<p>
     In sum,    10 is unconstitutional because it provides for censorship without required
procedural protections.
<p></blockquote>
III.Section 10's Content-Based Direct Burdens on Free Speech Rights Violate the First Amendment.
   <blockquote><p>
  1.   Section 10 "amounts to raw censorship based on content, censorship forbidden by
the text of the First Amendment and well-settled principles protecting speech and the press.  That
ought to end the matter."  Simon & Schuster, 502 U.S. at 128 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  As
Justice Kennedy pointed out, the strict scrutiny test was imported from equal protection
jurisprudence and "has no real or legitimate place when the Court considers the straightforward
question whether the State may enact a burdensome restriction of speech based on content only." 
Id. at 124.  Because    10 authorizes the prohibition of speech based solely on its content, it
should be invalidated without further inquiry into whether this plain First Amendment violation
also narrowly advances compelling government interests.  Id. at 124-128.
<p>
     2.   Even assuming arguendo that a content-based authorization to prohibit a huge
amount of protected speech (when engaged in only by certain speakers) is not invalid per se,    10
cannot survive the "the most exacting scrutiny" to which it is, at a minimum, subject. Turner, 114
S. Ct. at 2459.  Under strict scrutiny the government must prove (not merely assert) that the
regulations are necessary and narrowly tailored to achieve compelling governmental interests that
cannot be otherwise achieved.  Id. at 2469 (requiring such proof even under intermediate
review); see, e.g., Sable, 492 U.S. at 126; Simon & Schuster, 502 U.S. at 118.
<p>
     A challenged regulation is not "narrowly tailored" if it is significantly overinclusive,
burdening speech that need not be burdened to achieve the government's compelling interest. 
See id. at 121-22 (invalidating New York's Son-of-Sam law because it burdened "a wide range of
literature" whose burdening could not be defended by the asserted justification); see also NTEU,
115 S. Ct. at 1012-15 (well-intended but overbroad honoraria ban would have prohibited
payment for works by Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman, and Harte); Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. at
407-10 (statute reached far more speech than necessary to advance interest in preserving order).
<p>
     A challenged law will also fail strict scrutiny if it is significantly underinclusive, failing
to reach other conduct and speech that poses the same harm.  Florida Star v. BJF, 491 U.S. 524,
541-42 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and in judgment) ("a law cannot be regarded as
protecting an interest  of the highest order,' and thus as justifying a restriction upon truthful
speech, when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest unprohibited")
(citation omitted); see also Simon & Schuster, 502 U.S. at 123 (Blackmun, J., concurring);
Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 230 (1987); Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S.
455, 465 & n.9 (1980).  Thus, the government must prove the necessity not only for    10 as a
whole, but also for the content- and speaker-based distinctions embodied in    10:  here, that it is
necessary to restrict only the "indecent" speech of access programmers.  Minneapolis Star, 460
U.S. 575; Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U.S. at 447.
<p>
     The government has an interest in enabling parents to protect their children from harm
and, one may assume, in directly protecting children from harm in circumstances where parental
supervision is likely to be systematically or structurally impracticable.  Even so, however,    10 is
far from the least restrictive means available to achieve it.
<p></blockquote>
A.   Sections 10(a) and 10(c) Are Not Narrowly Tailored.
<p>
     The government's concession that      10(a) and 10(c) are invalid if they are subject to
constitutional review is dispositive and, in view of Sable, inevitable.  It is apparent from
examining the "likely" and "practical" effect that    10 will have, as is required (see above at 16),
that it will suppress a wide range of protected and valuable speech from a vital avenue of
communication, cable television.  Speech that would otherwise be communicated and eagerly
received will be prohibited across the board, rendered unavailable not only to young children, but
also to older teenagers and adults.  " Surely this is to burn the house to roast the pig.'"  Sable, 492
U.S. at 127 (quoting Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957)); see also Sable, at 127
("Pacifica is readily distinguishable from this case, most obviously because it did not involve a
total ban on broadcasting indecent material"); Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 750 & n.28 (implying that
prohibition of broadcasting indecent language would violate the First Amendment).
<p>
B.   Section 10(b) Is Not Narrowly Tailored.
<p>
     Assuming that      10(a) and 10(c) are invalid and severable, the remaining portion of the
regulatory framework  requiring the blocking of unprohibited "indecent" speech from only
leased access channels, but not PEG channels or any other channels  also imposes burdens on
speech that are neither necessary nor narrowly tailored to advance the government's goals.
<p><blockquote>
     1.   Section 10(b) is impermissibly overinclusive, because its restrictions on speech do
not advance the government's goals.
<p>
     Section 10(b)'s blocking scheme is invalid for the same reason that the Son-of-Sam law
was struck down: however laudable the goal to be served, the regulatory scheme is so carelessly
constructed (and in such derogation of basic First Amendment principles) that it burdens
substantial and valuable speech that need not be burdened to achieve its legitimate goals, and in
any event imposes far greater burdens on speech than are necessary given available alternatives
that are far less oppressive.
<p>
     As in Simon & Schuster, 502 U.S. at 122, and NTEU, 115 S. Ct. at 1013, a substantial
portion of the burden on speech does not serve to advance the government's content-neutral goal. 
See above at 7 & n.6.  Instead of targeting speech that would be harmful to children, as in
Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. at 639,    10's touchstone is any reference to sexual activity or
body parts that operators might believe the "average cable subscriber" would consider
"offensive," even if those materials undeniably have serious literary, artistic, scientific, or
educational value.  Offensiveness is surely not a proxy for harm.  See above at 29.  Regardless of
whether the hypothetical "average cable subscriber" might consider Picasso's drawings,
Shakespeare's double entendres, film of a Japanese village fertility festival, or an illustrated
discussion of the importance of and techniques for breast self-examination to be offensive, such
content is not harmful to all those under 18 (indeed, it is probably not harmful to any of them).
<p>
     2.   Section 10(b) imposes unnecessary burdens on speech.
<p>
     Petitioners begin by identifying the burdens imposed by    10(b), even in the absence of
     10(a) and 10(c), and then turn to the available alternatives that advance the relevant interests
equally as well with far less restriction on First Amendment interests.
<p>
     Section 10(b) requires suppression of speech unless viewers perform "an official act" as a
prerequisite to receiving constitutionally protected programming.  But, as this Court held in
Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U.S. 301, 305 (1965), requiring "an official act (viz.,
returning the reply card) as a limitation on the unfettered exercise of the addressee's First
Amendment rights" is unconstitutional.  Requiring a written request   thereby placing one's name
on a list of those desiring "bad" speech and exposing oneself to subpoena, leak, or gossip   is "an
affirmative obligation which we do not think the Government may impose . . . [and] is almost
certain to have a deterrent effect."  Id. at 307; see also Fabulous Assocs., Inc. v. Pennsylvania
Pub. Util. Comm'n, 896 F.2d 780, 785 (3d Cir. 1990) ("An identification requirement exerts an
inhibitory effect, and such deterrence raises First Amendment issues comparable to those raised
by direct state imposed burdens or restrictions") (citing Talley v. California, 362 U.S. 60, 64-65
(1960)).
<p>
     Blocking under 10(b) is indistinguishable from a total prohibition for viewers who, not
yet having requested access, would have seen  a (now-blocked) program while changing
channels and decided to watch it.  The same is true for every subscriber who promptly asks for
access to a program she learns about   from a friend who calls and says "turn to channel 36,"
from a listing in a daily newspaper or weekly TV Guide, or from a community group telephone
call or mailing   but will be denied because of the 30-day delay in unblocking.  Advisories about
such programs (which could prompt an unblocking request) are rarely available with more than 7
days notice, and virtually never with more than 30.
<p>
     Yet, in a sterile analysis at odds with this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence and
Lamont, the court of appeals held that the practical loss of speech was of no constitutional
concern, because speakers are not forbidden "from speaking" and viewers could have obtained all
indecent speech had they previously sent in their postcards asking to be put on the "indecent
speech" list.  Compare Pet. 42a with, e.g., Lamont, 381 U.S. at 306-07.  Judge Wald's response is
compelling.
<p>
     The blocking scheme is "almost certain to have a deterrent effect" on those who would
otherwise seek to obtain the speech by requiring virtually any speech with a sexual reference to
be "certified" with the denigrating term "indecent," authorizing operators to divert speech they
"believe" to be "indecent" onto a channel for "indecent" speech, and prohibiting access except
upon a written request for the "indecent" channel.  Lamont, 381 U.S. at 307; Thornburgh v.
American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 766-67 (1986).
<p>
     The government entirely failed to show that any of these burdens was necessary, and the
record and reason demonstrate that there are a number of available, less restrictive alternatives 
including lockboxes already required by law, or the even less restrictive and equally effective
blocking-on-request  by which the government could advance its legitimate interests.
<p>
     Since 1984, Congress has mandated that cable operators provide a "lockbox" to every
subscriber, 47 U.S.C.    544(d)(2), having found during lengthy committee hearings and floor
discussions that lockboxes are a very effective and efficient means of individually regulating
what is viewable in one's own home, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 934, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 70 (1984). 
There is no demonstration in    10's legislative history   indeed, there are no congressional
findings as to    10 at all   that lockboxes are no longer a sufficient means of meeting any asserted
compelling governmental interest underlying    10 or otherwise.  Before the Commission,
operators, programmers, and viewers noted without contradiction that lockboxes are an effective
way of achieving the government's aims.  See above at 7-8.
<p>
     The court of appeals' contrary conclusion (Pet. 33a-36a) lacks any foundation in the
record (or in anything before Congress) and applies a version of strict scrutiny so relaxed that it
bears no semblance to the test that this Court deploys.  Compare Sable, 492 U.S. at 128-129, and
id. at 131 (Scalia, J., concurring) (available technological alternatives render statute invalid, even
though some children "would manage to secure access") with Pet. 35a (lockbox alternative not
effective because adults would have to "continually activate and deactivate their lockboxes,
inevitably risking a slip up or a lapse"); see also NTEU, 115 S. Ct. at 1017 (individual
determinations less restrictive than wholesale prophylactic rule).
<p>
     Another obvious alternative that puts decision-making in the hands of parents instead of
the state is reverse central blocking, under which an operator would block specific channels on a
subscriber's request to do so.  Blocking on subscriber request would be equally effective at
facilitating parental protection of children and, with respect to each of the burdens imposed by   
10(b), far less restrictive than the present system.  Notably, the telecommunications restructuring
bill passed in the Senate and, at this writing, in conference recognizes the practicability of such a
system, and would require scrambling "upon subscriber request."
<p>
     Further, there is no merit to the government's attempt to cure the absence of findings by
the Commission or Congress regarding the necessity for    10(b)'s blocking scheme by focussing
on findings regarding a completely different medium, telephones.  This Court has repeatedly
insisted that each medium of communication requires individual treatment, e.g., Pacifica, 438
U.S. at 748, Burstyn, 343 U.S. at 503, and findings from one medium cannot simply be imported
to another where the basic structures differ in important relevant respects.  Here, it is self-evident
that the telephone has highly relevant technological capabilities (and limitations) and practical
configurations wholly different from cable.  See Regulations Concerning Indecent
Communications by Telephone, 5 FCC Rcd 4926 (1990).
<p>
     For example, it is not technologically practical to use voluntary blocking for telephones
because of the extremely large number of dial-a-porn numbers and the ease of creating or
switching to new numbers.  By contrast, lockboxes present a practical means of voluntary
blocking on cable, because televisions are not available on street corners and cable operators only
rarely reallocate channel numbers.  Cf. Bolger, 463 U.S. at 73 ("We can reasonably assume that
parents already exercise substantial control over the disposition of mail once it enters their
mailboxes").
<p>
     The government has not cited any evidence or congressional findings as to the necessity
for automatic central blocking limited to leased access, such as it presented to the courts in the
"dial-a-porn" cases, nor any findings that the situations are analogous.  And the evidence is to the
contrary.  For these reasons   and because    10 will effectively prohibit and deny adults and
minors access to valuable speech that they would have otherwise accessed and have a right to
receive, id., whereas the effect of the dial-a-porn measures was entirely less restrictive for adults  
the cases upholding the final version of the dial-a-porn regulations are inapposite here.
<p>
     3.   Section 10(b) is impermissibly underinclusive, because it blocks only speech by
leased access programmers.
<p>
     Finally,    10(b) and its implementing regulations require the blocking of "indecent"
speech on leased access channels, but not on PEG channels and not on the channels over which a
cable operator has editorial discretion.  Irrationally, even though a cable operator is required to
block on a leased access channel a program that is identified as (or which it believes to be)
"indecent," the operator is entirely free to cablecast that same program (or any other program
with comparably "indecent" content) on any other cable channel.  See above at 32 n.44.  Of
course, given the strong antipathy that many cable operators have for access programmers and
their desire to exclude them from their systems, the likelihood that blocking will be used to
disadvantage leased access programmers, rather than to protect children, is substantial.
<p>
     "One step at a time" is not a justification for content- or speaker-based distinctions where
First Amendment rights are concerned, regardless of the en banc court's unsupported assertion to
the contrary, Pet. 39a-40a.  See Minneapolis Star, 460 U.S. at 585; Arkansas Writers' Project,
481 U.S. at 231-32.  But even if it were, no factual predicate for such a justification has been
demonstrated here, and none exists.  Speech apparently within the "indecent" definition can be,
and indeed is, cablecast across every portion of cable systems without legal restraint (and can be
broadcast, as well, during the safe harbor hours).  Absent any demonstrated compelling necessity
for blocking only access channels,   10(b) violates the First Amendment.

<p>
1.    Despite their general prohibition of editorial control by cable operators over access channels,
the Commission's 1972 access rules required cable operators to "establish" rules prohibiting
transmission of obscene or indecent matter, but delayed their compliance date until 1977.  47
C.F.R. Section 76.256(d)(1)-(3).  in 1976, the Commission revised these provisions to clarify
that they were mandatory, but again delayed compliance.  59 F.C.C.2d 984, 986 (1976). These
provisions as revised were challenged as an unconstitutional imposition of censorship obligations
on cable operators, and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stayed their
effect.  American Civil Liberties Union v. FCC, No. 76-1695 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 26,
1977)(referenced in Midwest Video, 571 F.2d at 1056, 1057.  In its Midwest Video decision, the
Eighth Circuit found that "the Commission appears to have created a corps of involuntary
government surrogates, but without providing the procedural safeguards respecting 'prior
restraint' required of the government," and flagged several other constitutional concerns.  571
F.2d at 1056, 1057.  This Court noted the District of Columbia Circuit's stay and the Eighth
Circuit's disapproval of the indecency provisions, but, finding the entire regulatory scheme
unauthorized by Congress, did not itself reach those issues.  440 U.S. at 693 n.4, 695-96.

scheme, and because   10(d) threatens the operator with criminal liability for access
programming with sexual content.  See above at 5; see also Alliance for Community Media, JA

20.       "[T]here is no constitutional problem with this amendment because this is not
governmental action.  It is an action taken by a private party."  138 Cong. Rec. S646 (daily ed.
Jan. 30, 1992) (statement of Senator Helms); see also id. at S649 (statement of Senator Fowler)
("[Indecent and other undesired programming] should be stopped, must be stopped, and I think
this amendment will empower the cable operators to stop it").

flow of speech).
<p>
22.       See Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U.S. 73 (1927) (statute disqualifying blacks from Democratic
primary invalidated) and its progeny from Nixon v. Condon, 286 U.S. 73 (1932) to Terry v.
Adams, 345 U.S. 461 (1953), all of which condemned what was effectively the same
discrimination condemned under Herndon, only this time accomplished under re-designed
statutes attempting to shield the discrimination from judicial review by clothing it as private
action.  As the Court observed in Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. 268, 275 (1939), the Constitution
"nullifies sophisticated as well as simple-minded" efforts to effect unconstitutional outcomes.
<p>
23.       The court of appeals' refusal to reach a First Amendment challenge when harm would
flow from the discretionary decisions of third parties is also at war with the line of cases from
NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449 (1958), to Socialist Workers, 459 U.S. 87.  In each of those
cases, all the harm complained of flowed from the acts of third parties, but this Court proceeded
to the merits.
<p>
24.       See Ronald D. Rotunda & John E. Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law: Substance
and Procedure   16.1, at 524 (2d ed. 1992) ("All of the cases involving a state action issue have
an essentially similar fact pattern.  In these cases one individual citizen (the  aggrieved party')
feels that his freedoms or rights have been violated by the actions of another (the  alleged
wrongdoer')"); see also, e.g., Edmondson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614 (1991); Lugar
v. Edmonson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922 (1982); Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830 (1982).
<p>
25.       Neither apparently has Professor Tribe, who notes that, "[i]f litigants challenge a federal
or state statute . . . in a case where the validity of the statute is necessarily implicated, state action
is obvious, and no formal inquiry into the matter is
needed."  Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law   18-1, at 1688 (2d ed. 1988); see
also Rotunda & Nowak,   16.1, at 524 ("When a legislature, executive officer, or a court takes
some official action . . . , that action is subjected to review under the Constitution, for the official
act of any governmental agency is direct governmental action and therefore subject to the
restraints of the Constitution").
<p>
26.       Post-Reitman cases involving repeals of anti-discrimination measures reached and
decided the merits as well.  See, e.g., Crawford v. Board of Educ., 458 U.S. 527 (1982);
Washington v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457 (1982).
<p>
27.       This Court only had occasion to discuss state action when it moved to the distinct
question of whether post-enactment enforcement decisions made by an ostensibly private party
as to which of various possible infringers to sue (discretionary decisions that Congress did not
constrain or selectively authorize) violated the Fifth Amendment.  483 U.S. at 542.
<p>
28.       Other examples make the same point:  for instance, a law selectively "restoring" to
telephone companies (otherwise obligated to provide universal service) the power to deny service
to any customer who believes in Christianity or who publicly supports telecommunications
reform.
<p>
29.       Cf. DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't of Social Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 197 n.3 (1989)
(although a state may fail to protect its citizens generally without running afoul of the due
process clause, it "may not, of course, selectively deny its protective services to certain
disfavored minorities without violating the Equal Protection Clause").
<p>
30.       The government has asserted that Hanson has been essentially overruled, relying upon
Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345 (1974).  Jackson, however, did not deal with
preemption, much less with a facial challenge to a statute that on its face authorized previously
forbidden constitutional actions.  This Court has subsequently and repeatedly reaffirmed
Hanson's rationale.  E.g., Communications Workers of Am. v. Beck, 487 U.S. 735, 761 (1988);
Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Educ., 431 U.S. 209, 218 n.12 (1977).
<p>
31.       See Pet. 46a-53a (Wald, J., dissenting) for a further explanation of the joint    10(a) and
10(b) scheme.  Even under   10(c), the Commission is a joint participant in operators'
censorship:  it defines the disfavored ideas and directs operators that they may require
programmer certifications.  Petitioners also join in the argument of petitioners in no. 95-227 that
censorship of speech in a public forum such as cable access channels is always subject to
constitutional scrutiny.
<p>
32.       See Hynes v. Mayor & Council of Oradell, 425 U.S. 610, 620 (1976) ("general test of
vagueness applies with particular force in review of laws dealing with speech").

to pursue their personal predilections'") (citation omitted).

34.       E.g., Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507 (1948) (statutory standard interpreted by state
court to be "criminal news or stories of deeds of bloodshed or lust, so massed as to become
vehicles for inciting violent and depraved crimes"); Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495
(1952) ("sacrilegious" as a licensing standard); Gelling v. Texas, 343
U.S. 960 (1952) (per curiam) ("prejudicial to the best interests of the people of said City");

educational, or amusing and harmless"); Holmby Prods., Inc. v. Vaughn, 350 U.S. 870 (1955)
(per curiam) ("cruel, obscene, indecent or immoral, or such as tend to debase or corrupt morals").

35.       E.g., Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 59 (1963) (condemning a commission
that was charged with reviewing material "manifestly tending to the corruption of the youth.").
<p>
36.       Notably, the Dallas ordinance posed far less damage to First Amendment rights than   10
does, because it did not censor outright all pictures classified as "not suitable," did not make
speech unavailable to adults, treated all minors 16 and over as if they were adults, and afforded
minors the opportunity to view "unsuitable" films with their parents.
<p>

38.       See also Southeastern Promotions, 420 U.S. at 552-53 ("clean and healthful and
culturally uplifting" standard gives city "unbridled discretion"); Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc., 327
U.S. 146, 149-51 (1946) (application of a "not morally improper" standard would be sanctioning
censorship); Cinevision Corp. v. City of Burbank, 745 F.2d 560, 573 (9th Cir. 1984) ("family
entertainment" standard "does not . . . provide a standard sufficient to limit arbitrary and
capricious action"), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1054 (1985); Big Mama Rag, Inc. v. United States,
631 F.2d 1030, 1035-40 (D.C. Cir. 1980); Finley v. NEA, 795 F. Supp. 1457, 1471-72 (C.D. Cal.
1992) (striking down "general standards of indecency" requirement because "the very nature of
our pluralistic society is that there are an infinite number of values and beliefs and, correlatively,
there may be no national  general standards of decency'") (appeal pending).
<p>
39.       Moreover, once censorship occurs, few programmers will be able to afford lengthy
proceedings seeking redress, especially when delays to decision are inevitable given the various
defenses for operators to assert, including "reasonable belief," which would likely forestall courts
from reaching the substantive merits altogether, and the contention that no cause of action is
available under the Communications Act.
<p>
40.       As noted below at II.B, this Court has never upheld the broadcast standard against a
constitutional vagueness challenge, and one lower court that did so explicitly welcomed
"correction from Higher Authority," Action for Children's Television v. FCC, 852 F.2d 1332,
1339 (D.C. Cir. 1988).
<p>
41.       The gap between the two standards is comparable to the gap between "real probable
cause" and the easier-to-make-out standard of "good-faith belief" reflected in United States v.
Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984), or between actual constitutional violations and "good-faith" qualified
immunity under 42 U.S.C.   1983.
<p>
42.       See also Sable Communications of Calif., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 125 (1989); Smith
v. Goguen, 415 U.S. at 574 (because of "widely varying attitudes and tastes," a ban on
"contemptuous" treatment of the flag provided no meaningful guide to conduct or enforcement).
<p>
43.       Indeed, cable operators may even ban some "indecent" programs on access channels and
only block the others.  First Report, Pet. 151 n.39.
<p>
44.       See Schwartz Decl., JA 393 (noting that "Real Sex" on HBO and The Playboy Channel
are carried on many systems).
<p>
45.       This Court observed that the Commission had not engaged in rule making and that its
review was "limited to the question whether the Commission has the authority to proscribe this
particular broadcast."  438 U.S. at 742; see id. at 734.  The Court further stressed that "the time
of day" in which an indecency standard applied was "all-important" and cautioned that it was not
passing on the facial validity of "indecency," much less approving it as a permissible standard for
prohibition as opposed to channelling.  Id. at 750.
<p>
46.       Indeed, Pacifica did not contest that the Carlin monologue fit the Commission's
definition.  438 U.S. at 739.  Commentators, including the author of the Pacifica plurality
opinion, have since suggested that the station would probably have won its case had it challenged
the Commission's sanction on the specific facts presented.  E.g., Hon. John Paul Stevens, The
Freedom of Speech, 102 Yale L.J. 1293, 1307 (1993); Daniel Farber, Content Regulation and the
First Amendment:  A Revisionist View, 68 Geo. L.J. 727, 757 (1980).
<p>
47.       Documenting the Commission's dramatic expansion of "indecency," see Public Notice, 2
FCC Rcd 2726 (1987); Infinity Broadcasting, 3 FCC Rcd 930 (1987); KSD-FM, Notice of
Apparent Liability, 6 FCC Rcd 3689 (1990) (newsworthy nature of broadcast would be a factor
but would not be dispositive in "indecency" determination); Pacifica Found., 2 FCC Rcd 2698
(play dealing with AIDS and homosexuality), recon. & clarif. granted in part, 3 FCC Rcd 930
(1987); Action for Children's Television, 852 F.2d at 1336; John
Crigler & William J. Byrnes, Decency Redux:  The Curious History of the New FCC Broadcast
Indecency Policy, 38 Cath. U. L. Rev. 329, 338-41 (1989) (describing indecision over broadcast
of Ulysses); Richard G. Passler, Regulation of Indecent Radio Broadcasts:  George Carlin
Revisited -- What Does the Future Hold for the Seven "Dirty" Words?, 65 Tul. L. Rev. 131, 140
(1990) (noting the Commission's "new, more generic standard expanded the definition of
indecent language beyond anything the Court in Pacifica I ever envisioned"); Steven Nudelman,
A Chilly Wait in Radioland:  The FCC Forces "Indecent" Radio Broadcasters to Censor
Themselves or Face the Music, 2 J.L. & Pol. 115 (1994).
<p>
48.       Thus, faced with a statute that on its face reached only "obscene, indecent, or profane
language," 18 U.S.C.   1464 (emphasis added), and with the Carlin monologue, the Court wrote
that there are "few, if any, thoughts that cannot be expressed by the use of less offensive
language."  438 U.S. at 743 n.18.  But the Commission's focus has moved well beyond "dirty
words," and its regulation of "indecent programming" sets at risk a host of valuable programs on
such subjects as artists, reproductive health, breast or testicular cancer, and anthropology, which
would be entirely unviable, or rendered far less effective, if stripped of all depiction or
description of "sexual or excretory activities or organs."
<p>
49.       In addition, as Justice Stewart and three other dissenters in Pacifica persuasively argued,
the term "indecent" in 18 U.S.C.   1464 is most reasonably read to be simply a synonym for
"obscene," particularly in view of the constitutional difficulties created by a more expansive
definition.  438 U.S. at 777-80; see 47 U.S.C.   532(h) (referring to cable service that is
"obscene, or . . . indecent or is otherwise unprotected by the Constitution") (emphasis added).
<p>
50.       E.g., First Report, Pet. 143a ("Congress intended to provide cable operators wide
discretion"); id., Pet. 144a-45a ("Given the wide discretion Congress afforded . . . , we see no
reason to dispute" that "cable operators have the discretion to prohibit some, but not necessarily
all, indecent programming"); Second Report, Pet. 189a ("section 10(c) was intended to afford
cable operators broad discretion [under] section 10(c)," including banning of "indecent"
programs on some but not all access channels).
<p>
51.       FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Riley v. National Fed'n of Blind of
N.C., Inc., 487 U.S. 781 (1988); Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, 58 (1965).
<p>
52.       See also FW/PBS, 493 U.S. at 229 (all three Freedman factors are applicable where, as
here, a "censor [is] engaged in direct censorship of particular expressive material"); United States
v. Thirty-Seven (37) Photographs, 402 U.S. 363, 367 (1971); Blount v. Rizzi, 400 U.S. 410,
419-21 (1971); Teitel Film Corp. v. Cusack, 390 U.S. 139 (1968).
<p>
53.       The Commission found procedural safeguards unnecessary on the theory that any
censorship under    10(a) and (c) would be private action, even though the government defines
the speech to be censored and prescribes regulations (  10(c)) or written policy requirements ( 
10(a)) under which the censorship takes place.  See Second Report, Pet. 193a n.17.  Delegation
of censorship to private decision-makers is of course no answer to the insurmountable due
process problems that result.  See National Ass'n of Theatre Owners, Inc. v. Motion Picture
Comm'n, 328 F. Supp. 6 (E.D. Wis. 1971); Engdahl v. City of Kenosha, 317 F. Supp. 1133 (E.D.
Wis. 1970); Motion Picture Ass'n of Am. v. Specter, 315 F. Supp. 824 (E.D. Pa. 1970).

<p>54.       See Interstate Circuit, 390 U.S. at 686 (citing cases).
<p>
55.       See above at 14.  Neither the Commission nor the court of appeals doubted that   10 is
subject to strict scrutiny to whatever extent it is subject to constitutional review at all.  See Pet.
32a-34a; Pet. 131a-40a.  Until this case, the courts had unanimously held that restrictions on
"indecent" cable programming violate the First Amendment  E.g., Wilkinson v. Jones, 480 U.S.
926 (1987) (mem.), aff'g 800 F.2d 989 (10th Cir. 1986), aff'g 611 F. Supp. 1099 (D. Utah 1985). 
See also Goldstein v. Manhattan Cable Television Inc., No. 90 Civ. 4750,
1995 WL 562182 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 1995); Altmann v. Television Signal Corp., 849 F. Supp.
1335 (N.D. Cal. 1994); Cruz v. Ferre, 755 F.2d 1415 (11th Cir. 1985); Community Television of
Utah, Inc. v. Roy City, 555 F. Supp. 1164 (D. Utah 1982); Home Box Office, Inc. v. Wilkinson,
531 F. Supp. 987 (D. Utah 1982).
<p>
56.       The many cases recognizing a strong interest in enabling parents to control their
upbringing of their children are inconsistent with an independent governmental interest in
protecting children from non-obscene speech contrary to parental wishes, as Chief Judge
Edwards observed, Pet. 77a.  See, e.g., Bolger, 463 U.S. at 73, 75 (right of parent to provide
children with materials government deems harmful); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 213-14
(1972); Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 639 (1968) ("the prohibition against sales to
minors does not bar parents who so desire from purchasing the magazines for their children");
Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 401 (1923) (striking law as interfering with "the power of
parents to control the education of their own"); see also Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 769-70 (Brennan,
Marshall, JJ., dissenting); Pet. 59a-61a (Wald, J., dissenting).
<p>     Assuming, however, that the government has an independent interest in protecting children
from non-obscene speech in those circumstances where parental control is likely to be
structurally impracticable, cable television is decidedly not a context where such circumstances
exist, and hence that additional interest cannot support restrictions on speech in this case beyond
those supportable under the interest in enabling parents.  Cable television is exclusively
accessible in homes (there are no pay-cable sets on street corners), where it is an invited (and
paid-for) guest.  In sharp contrast to telephones, cable television is highly susceptible to parental
control, as the family mailbox was found to be in Bolger, 463 U.S. at 73.
<p>
57.       See McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 115 S. Ct. 1511, 1516-17 (1994) (recognizing
First Amendment and privacy interests served by anonymity).  
<p>
58.            "Many viewers] probably do not want to be perceived (even by their cable operator,
much less anyone who might later acquire such information by subpoena or otherwise) as the
kind of people who [want indecent speech].  They therefore will not
affirmatively write for access . . . .  Yet given a free choice in the matter, they might prefer to
have unimpeded, selective access to some but not all programs that fall within that broad
umbrella designation.  Not only aficionados of the arts or of politics but also the mildly curious
might well decide to watch an "unvarnished" documentary on the Mapplethorpe exhibit if it is
readily available, for example, but may not write to request an entire channel of indecency on the
chance that this and similar programs will be included.  They may want to shield their children
from most "indecent" programming, yet may occasionally find it appropriate to expose older
children to frank, even graphic discussions of sexuality and the AIDS epidemic, including some
programs that might fall within the FCC's definition of "indecency" (or at any rate are close
enough to the line that cable operators will ban them altogether or relegate them to the "indecent"
channel).  Whether they are "channel surfers" who like to browse before settling on a program, or
"appointment viewers" who prefer to study a program guide and watch pre-selected programs,
this regulation [deprives viewers of speech that they would otherwise obtain]."Pet. 57a (Wald, J.,
dissenting).
<p>
59.       The privacy provisions of 47 U.S.C.   551 do not resolve these concerns, for they are
entirely dependent upon cable operators and the penalties for violation thereof are minimal.
<p>
60.       Lockboxes allow a subscriber to block and unblock any channel at any time, generally by
programming her lockbox and using a numerical code or mechanical lock that the subscriber
controls.  Pet. 36a; see also Lockbox Manuals, JA 95-100, 126-30, 147-51.

<p>
62.  In its opposition to the petitions for certiorari at 18, the government asserted that   10(b) is
"based on similar blocking requirements used to control children's access to dial-a-porn" and that
"Congress could reasonably draw upon the knowledge gained in constructing that analogous
legislation" (emphasis added).
<p>

certain to have interests that clash with that of the programmer seeking to use leased access
channels . . . .  For example, the operator may believe that the programmer might compete with
programming that the [operator] owns or controls"); H.R. Rep. No. 934, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 48
(1984) (access channels may "represent[] a social or political viewpoint that a cable operator
