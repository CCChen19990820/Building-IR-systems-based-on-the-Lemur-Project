<B>A. Equipment Tuning Procedure<sup>1</sup> for Forced-Draft 
Boilers, Steam
Generators, and Process Heaters</B>
<P>
Nothing in this Equipment Tuning Procedure shall be construed
to require any act or omission that would result in unsafe conditions
or would be in violation of any regulation or requirement established
by Factory Mutual, Industrial Risk Insurors, National Fire Prevention
Association, the California Department of Industrial Relations
(Occupational Safety and Health Division), the Federal Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, or other relevant regulations
and requirements.
<P>
Should a different tuning procedure be used, a copy of this procedure
should be kept with the unit records for two years and made available
to the District personnel on request.
<P>
1). Operate the unit at the firing rate most typical of normal
operation.  If the unit experiences significant load variations
during normal operation, operate it at its average firing rate.
<P>
2). At this firing rate, record stack gas temperature, oxygen concentration,
and CO concentration (for gaseous fuels) or smoke-spot number<sup><font size=2>2
</sup><font size=3>
(for liquid fuels), and observe flame conditions after unit operation
stabilizes at the firing rate selected.  If the excess oxygen
in the stack gas is at the lower end of the range of typical minimum
values<sup><font size=2>3</sup><font size=3>, and if CO emissions are low and there is not smoke, the
unit is probably operating at near optimum efficiency - at this
particular firing rate.  
<P>
 However, complete the remaining portion of this procedure to
determine whether still lower oxygen levels are practical.
<P>

<P><center>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></center>
<sup><font size=1.5>1</sup><font size=2><i>This tuning procedure is based on a tune-up procedure developed
by KVB, Inc. for the United States EPA.</i>
<P>
<sup><font size=1.5>2</sup><font size=2><i>The smoke-spot number can be determined with ASTM Test Method
D-2156 or with the Bacharach method.  ASTM Test Method D-2156
is included in a tuneup kit that can be purchased from the Bacharach
Company.</i>
<P>
<sup><font size=1.5>3</sup><font size=2><i>Typical minimum oxygen levels for boilers at high firing rates
are:</i>
<br><ul>
 <i>1.  For natural gas:  0.5% - 3%</i>
<br>
 <i>2.  For liquid fuels:  2% - 4%</i>
<br></ul><font size=3><center>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></center>
3). Increase combustion air flow to the furnace until stack gas
oxygen levels increase by one to two percent over the level measured
in Step 2.  As in Step 2, record the stack gas temperature, CO
concentration (for gaseous fuels) or smoke-spot number (for liquid
fuels), and observe flame conditions for these higher oxygen levels
after boiler operation stabilizes.
<P>
4). Decrease combustion air flow until the stack gas oxygen concentration
is at the level measured in Step 2.  From this level gradually
reduce the combustion air flow, in small increments.  After each
increment, record the stack gas temperature, oxygen concentration,
CO concentration (for gaseous fuels) and smoke-spot number (for
liquid fuels).  Also observe the flame and record any changes
in its condition.
<P>
5). Continue to reduce combustion air flow stepwise, until one
of these limits is reached:
<ul>
(a). Unacceptable flame conditions - such as flame impingement on
furnace walls or burner parts, excessive flame carryover, or flame
instability.
<P>
(b). Stack gas CO concentrations greater than 400 ppm.
<P>
(c). Smoking at the stack.
<P>
(d). Equipment-related limitations - such as low windbox/furnace
pressure differential, built in air-flow limits, etc.
<P>
</ul>
6). Develop an O<SUB>2</SUB>/CO curve (for gaseous fuels) or O<SUB>2</SUB>/smoke curve
(for liquid fuels) similar to those shown in Figures 1 and 2 using
the excess oxygen and CO or smoke-spot number data obtained at
each combustion air flow setting.
<P>
7). From the curves prepared in Step 6, find the stack gas oxygen
levels where the CO emissions or smoke-spot number equal the following
values:
<P><PRE>
<B>Fuel			Measurement			Value</B>
-----------		-----------			-----------
Gaseous 		CO Emissions 			400 ppm

 #1 and #2 oils 	smoke-spot number 		number 1

 #4 oil 		smoke-spot number 		number 2

 #5 oil 		smoke-spot number 		number 3

 Other oils 		smoke-spot number 		number 4

</PRE>
The above conditions are referred to as the CO or smoke thresholds,
or as the minimum excess oxygen level.
<P>
Compare this minimum value of excess oxygen to the expected value
provided by the combustion unit manufacturer.  If the minimum
level found is substantially higher than the value provided by
the combustion unit manufacturer, burner adjustments can probably
be made to improve fuel and air mixing, thereby allowing operation
with less air.
<P>
8). Add 0.5 to 2.0 percent of the minimum excess oxygen level found
in Step 7 and reset burner controls to operate automatically at
this higher stack gas oxygen level.  This margin above the minimum
oxygen level accounts for fuel variations, variations in atmospheric
conditions, load changes, and nonrepeatability or play in automatic
controls.
<P>
9). If the load of the combustion unit varies significantly during
normal operation, repeat Steps 1-8 for firing rates that represent
the upper and lower limits of the range of the load.  Because
control adjustments at one firing rate may affect #onditions at
other firing rates, it may not be possible to establish the optimum
excess oxygen level at all firing rates.  If this is the case,
choose the burner control settings that give best performance
over the range of firing rates.  If one firing rate predominates,
settings should optimize conditions at that rate.
<P>
10). Verify that the new settings can accommodate the sudden load
changes that may occur in daily operation without adverse effects.
 Do this by increasing and decreasing load rapidly while observing
the flame and stack.  If any of the conditions in Step 5 result,
reset the combustion controls to provide a slightly higher level
of excess oxygen at the affected firing rates.  Next, verify these
new settings in a similar fashion.  Then make sure that the final
control settings are recorded at steady-state operating conditions
for future reference.
<P>
11). When the above checks and adjustments have been made, record
data and attach combustion analysis data to boiler, steam generator,
or heater records indicating name and signature of person, title,
and date the tuneup was performed.
<P>
<B>B. Equipment Tuning Procedure for Natural Draft-Fired Boilers,
Steam Generators, and Process Heaters.</B>
<P>
Nothing in this Equipment Tuning Procedure shall be construed
to require any act or omission that would result in unsafe conditions
or would be in violation of any regulation or requirement established
by Factory Mutual, Industrial Risk Insurers, National Fire Prevention
Association, the California Department of Industrial Relations
(Occupational Safety and Health Division), the Federal Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, or other relevant codes, regulations,
and equipment manufacturers specifications and operating manuals.
<P>
Should a different tuning procedure be used, a copy of this procedure
should be kept with the unit records for two years and made available
to the District personnel on request.
<P>
<B>1. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS</B>
<P><UL>
 (a).<TT> </TT>CHECK THE OPERATING PRESSURE OR TEMPERATURE.
<P>
  Operate the boiler, steam generator, or heater at the lowest
acceptable pressure or temperature that will satisfy the load
demand.  This will minimize heat and radiation losses.  Determine
the pressure or temperature that will be used as a basis for comparative
combustion analysis before and after tuneup.
<P>
 (b). CHECK OPERATING HOURS.
<P>
  Plan the workload so that the boiler, steam generator, or process
heater operates only the minimum hours and days necessary to perform
the work required.  Fewer operating hours will reduce fuel use
and emissions.  For units requiring a tuneup to comply with the
rule, a totalizing non-resettable fuel meter will be required
for each fuel used and for each boiler, steam generator, and heater
to prove fuel consumption is less than the heat input limit in
therms per year specified in the rule.
<P>
 (c). CHECK AIR SUPPLY.
<P>
  Sufficient fresh air supply is essential to ensure optimum combustion
and the area of air supply openings must be in compliance with
applicable codes and regulations.  Air openings must be kept wide
open when the burner is firing and clear from restriction to flow.
<P>
 (d). CHECK VENT.
<P>
  Proper venting is essential to assure efficient combustion.
 Insufficient draft or overdraft promotes hazards and inefficient
burning.  Check to be sure that vent is in good condition, sized
properly and with no obstructions.
<P>
 (e). COMBUSTION ANALYSIS.
<P>
  Perform an &quot;as is&quot; combustion analysis (CO, O<SUB>2</SUB>, etc.)
with a warmed up unit at high and low fire, if possible.  In addition
to data obtained from combustion analysis, also record the following:
<P><UL>
   i). Inlet fuel pressure at burner (at high &amp; low fire)
<P>
  ii). Draft above draft hood or barometric damper
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   (1) Draft hood: high, medium, and low<br>

   (2) Barometric Damper: high, medium, and low
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  iii). Steam pressure, water temperature, or process fluid pressure
or temperature entering and leaving the boiler, steam generator,
or process heater.
<P>
   iv). Unit rate if meter is available.<br>
<P></UL>
 With above conditions recorded, make the following checks and
corrective actions as necessary: 
<P>
</UL>
<B>2. CHECKS &amp; CORRECTIONS</B>
<P><UL>
 (a). CHECK BURNER CONDITION.
<P>
  Dirty burners or burner orifices will cause boiler, steam generator,
or process heater output rate and thermal efficiency to decrease.
 Clean burners and burner orifices thoroughly.  Also, ensure that
fuel filters and moisture traps are in place, clean, and operating
properly, to prevent plugging of gas orifices.  Confirm proper
location and orientation of burner diffuser spuds, gas canes,
etc.  Look for any burned-off or missing burner parts, and replace
as needed.
<P>
 (b). CHECK FOR CLEAN BOILER, STEAM GENERATOR, OR PROCESS
HEATER TUBES &amp; HEAT TRANSFER SURFACES.
<P>
  External and internal build-up of sediment and scale on the
heating surfaces creates an insulating effect that quickly reduces
unit efficiency.  Excessive fuel cost will result if the unit
is not kept clean.  Clean tube surfaces, remove scale and soot,
assure proper process fluid flow and flue gas flow.
<P>
 (c). CHECK WATER TREATMENT &amp; BLOWDOWN PROGRAM<TT>.</TT>
<P>
  Soft water and the proper water or process fluid treatment must
be uniformly used to minimize scale and corrosion.  Timely flushing
and periodic blowdown must be employed to eliminate sediment and
scale build-up on a boiler, steam generator or process heater.
<P>
 (d). CHECK FOR STEAM, HOT WATER OR PROCESS FLUID LEAKS.
<P>
  Repair all leaks immediately since even small high-pressure
leaks quickly lead to considerable fuel, water and steam  losses.
 Be sure there are no leaks through the blow-off, drains, safety
valve, by-pass lines or at the feed pump, if used.
<P></UL>
<B>3. SAFETY CHECKS</B>
<P><UL>
 (a). Test primary and secondary low water level controls.
<P>
 (b). Check operating and limit pressure and temperature controls.
<P>
 (c). Check pilot safety shut off operation.
<P>
 (d). Check safety valve pressure and capacity to meet boiler, steam
generator or process heater requirements.
<P>
 (e). Check limit safety control and spill switch.
<P></UL>
<B>4. ADJUSTMENTS</B>
<P>
 While taking combustion readings with a warmed up boiler, steam
generator, or process heater at high fire perform checks and adjustments
as follows:
<P><UL>
 (a). Adjust unit to fire at rate; record fuel manifold
pressure.
<P>
 (b). Adjust draft and/or fuel pressure to obtain acceptable,
clean combustion at both high, medium and low fire.  Carbon Monoxide
(CO) value should always be below 400 parts per million (PPM)
at 3% 0<SUB>2</SUB>.  If CO is high make necessary adjustments.
<P>
  Check to ensure boiler, steam generator, or process heater light
offs are smooth and safe.  A reduced fuel pressure test at both
high and low fire should be conducted in accordance with the manufacturers
instructions and maintenance manuals.
<P>
 (c). Check and adjust operation of modulation controller.
 Ensure proper, efficient and clean combustion through range of
firing rates.
<P></UL>
 When above adjustments and corrections have been made, record
all data.
<P>
<B>5. FINAL TEST</B>
<P>
 Perform a final combustion analysis with a warmed up boiler,
steam generator, or process heater at high, medium and low fire,
whenever possible.  In addition to data from  combustion analysis,
also check and record:
<P><UL>
 (a). Fuel pressure at burner (High, Medium, and Low).
<P>
 (b). Draft above draft hood or barometric damper (High, Medium
and Low).
<P>
 (c).<TT> </TT>Steam pressure or water temperature entering and
leaving boiler, steam generator, or process heater.
<P>
 (d).<TT> </TT>Unit rate if meter is available.
<P></UL>
 When the above checks and adjustments have been made, record
data and attach combustion analysis data to boiler, steam generator,
or process heater records indicating name and signature of person,
title, company name, company address and date the tuneup was performed.

b). Stack gas CO concentrations greater than 400 ppm.

c). Smoking at the stack.
<P>
d). Equipment-related limitations - such as low windbox/furnace
pressure differential, built in air-flow limits, etc.

<LI>Develop an O<SUB>2</SUB>/CO curve (for gaseous fuels) or O<SUB>2</SUB>/smoke curve
(for liquid fuels) similar to those shown in Figures 1 and 2 using
the excess oxygen and CO or smoke-spot number data obtained at
each combustion air flow setting.
<P>
<LI>From the curves prepared in Step 6, find the stack gas oxygen
levels where the CO emissions or smoke-spot number equal the following
values:
<PRE WIDTH=132>
<B>
Fuel              Measurement          Value                   </B>
-----------------------------------------------
Gaseous           CO Emissions         400 ppm                 
#1 and #2 oils    smoke-spot number    number 1                
#4 oil            smoke-spot number    number 2                
#5 oil            smoke-spot number    number 3                
Other oils        smoke-spot number    number 4                

</PRE>

<P>
 The above conditions are referred to as the CO or smoke thresholds,
or as the minimum excess oxygen level.
<P>
 Compare this minimum value of excess oxygen to the expected value
provided by the combustion unit manufacturer.  If the minimum
level found is substantially higher than the value provided by
the combustion unit manufacturer, burner adjustments can probably
be made to improve fuel and air mixing, thereby allowing operation
with less air.
<P>
<LI>Add 0.5 to 2.0 percent of the minimum excess oxygen level found
in Step 7 and reset burner controls to operate automatically at
this higher stack gas oxygen level.  This margin above the minimum
oxygen level accounts for fuel variations, variations in atmospheric
conditions, load changes, and nonrepeatability or play in automatic
controls.
<P>
<LI>If the load of the combustion unit varies significantly during
normal operation, repeat Steps 1-8 for firing rates that represent
the upper and lower limits of the range of the load.  Because
control adjustments at one firing rate may affect conditions at
other firing rates, it may not be possible to establish the optimum
excess oxygen level at all firing rates.  If this is the case,
choose the burner control settings that give best performance
over the range of firing rates.  If one firing rate predominates,
settings should optimize conditions at that rate.
<P>
<LI>Verify that the new settings can accommodate the sudden load
changes that may occur in daily operation without adverse effects.
 Do this by increasing and decreasing load rapidly while observing
the flame and stack.  If any of the conditions in Step 5 result,
reset the combustion controls to provide a slightly higher level
of excess oxygen at the affected firing rates.  Next, verify these
new settings in a similar fashion.  Then make sure that the final
control settings are recorded at steady-state operating conditions
for future reference.
<P>
<LI>When the above checks and adjustments have been made, record
data and attach combustion analysis data to boiler, steam generator,
or heater records indicating name and signature of person, title,
and date the tuneup was performed.
<P>
</OL>
<B>B. Equipment Tuning Procedure for Natural Draft-Fired Boilers,
Steam Generators, and Process Heaters.</B>
<P>
Nothing in this Equipment Tuning Procedure shall be construed
to require any act or omission that would result in unsafe conditions
or would be in violation of any regulation or requirement established
by Factory Mutual, Industrial Risk Insurers, National Fire Prevention
Association, the California Department of Industrial Relations
(Occupational Safety and Health Division), the Federal Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, or other relevant codes, regulations,
and equipment manufacturers specifications and operating manuals.
<P>
Should a different tuning procedure be used, a copy of this procedure
should be kept with the unit records for two years and made available
to the District personnel on request.
<P>

<OL>
<LI><B>PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS</B>
<P>

 a). CHECK THE OPERATING PRESSURE OR TEMPERATURE.
<P>
  Operate the boiler, steam generator, or heater at the lowest
acceptable pressure or temperature that will satisfy the load
demand.  This will minimize heat and radiation losses.  Determine
the pressure or temperature that will be used as a basis for comparative
combustion analysis before and after tuneup.
<P>
 b). CHECK OPERATING HOURS.
<P>
  Plan the workload so that the boiler, steam generator, or process
heater operates only the minimum hours and days necessary to perform
the work required.  Fewer operating hours will reduce fuel use
and emissions.  For units requiring a tuneup to comply with the
rule, a totalizing non-resettable fuel meter will be required
for each fuel used and for each boiler, steam generator, and heater
to prove fuel consumption is less than the heat input limit in
therms per year specified in the rule.
<P>
 c). CHECK AIR SUPPLY.
<P>
  Sufficient fresh air supply is essential to ensure optimum combustion
and the area of air supply openings must be in compliance with
applicable codes and regulations.  Air openings must be kept wide
open when the burner is firing and clear from restriction to flow.
<P>
 d). CHECK VENT.
<P>
  Proper venting is essential to assure efficient combustion.
 Insufficient draft or overdraft promotes hazards and inefficient
burning.  Check to be sure that vent is in good condition, sized
properly and with no obstructions.
<P>
 e). COMBUSTION ANALYSIS.
<P>
  Perform an &quot;as is&quot; combustion analysis (CO, O<SUB>2</SUB>, etc.)
with a warmed up unit at high and low fire, if possible.  In addition
to data obtained from combustion analysis, also record the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   i. Inlet fuel pressure at burner (at high &amp; low fire)
<P>
  ii. Draft above draft hood or barometric damper
   <BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
   1) Draft hood: high, medium, and low
   <P>
   2) Barometric Damper: high, medium, and low
   <P>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>
 iii. Steam pressure, water temperature, or process fluid pressure
or temperature entering and leaving the boiler, steam generator,
or process heater.
<P>
   iv. Unit rate if meter is available.
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
With above conditions recorded, make the following checks and
corrective actions as necessary: 
<P>
</OL>
<OL>
<LI VALUE=2><B>CHECKS &amp; CORRECTIONS</B>
<P>
 a. CHECK BURNER CONDITION.
<P>
  Dirty burners or burner orifices will cause boiler, steam generator,
or process heater output rate and thermal efficiency to decrease.
 Clean burners and burner orifices thoroughly.  Also, ensure that
fuel filters and moisture traps are in place, clean, and operating
properly, to prevent plugging of gas orifices.  Confirm proper
location and orientation of burner diffuser spuds, gas canes,
etc.  Look for any burned-off or missing burner parts, and replace
as needed.
<P>
 b. CHECK FOR CLEAN BOILER, STEAM GENERATOR, OR PROCESS HEATER
TUBES &amp; HEAT TRANSFER SURFACES.
<P>
  External and internal build-up of sediment and scale on the
heating surfaces creates an insulating effect that quickly reduces
unit efficiency.  Excessive fuel cost will result if the unit
is not kept clean.  Clean tube surfaces, remove scale and soot,
assure proper process fluid flow and flue gas flow.
<P>
 c. CHECK WATER TREATMENT &amp; BLOWDOWN PROGRAM.
<P>
  Soft water and the proper water or process fluid treatment must
be uniformly used to minimize scale and corrosion.  Timely flushing
and periodic blowdown must be employed to eliminate sediment and
scale build-up on a boiler, steam generator or process heater.
<P>
 d. CHECK FOR STEAM, HOT WATER OR PROCESS FLUID LEAKS
<P>
  Repair all leaks immediately since even small high-pressure
leaks quickly lead to considerable fuel, water and steam  losses.
 Be sure there are no leaks through the blow-off, drains, safety
valve, by-pass lines or at the feed pump, if used.
<P>
<LI><B>SAFETY CHECKS</B>
<P>
 a. Test primary and secondary low water level controls.
<P>
 b. Check operating and limit pressure and temperature controls.
<P>
 c. Check pilot safety shut off operation.
<P>
 d. Check safety valve pressure and capacity to meet boiler, steam
generator or process heater requirements.
<P>
 e. Check limit safety control and spill switch.
<P>
<LI><B>ADJUSTMENTS</B>
<P>
 While taking combustion readings with a warmed up boiler, steam
generator, or process heater at high fire perform checks and adjustments
as follows:
<P>
 a. Adjust unit to fire at rate; record fuel manifold pressure.
<P>
 b. Adjust draft and/or fuel pressure to obtain acceptable, clean
combustion at both high, medium and low fire.  Carbon Monoxide
(CO) value should always be below 400 parts per million (PPM)
at 3% 02.  If CO is high make necessary adjustments.
<P>
  Check to ensure boiler, steam generator, or process heater light
offs are smooth and safe.  A reduced fuel pressure test at both
high and low fire should be conducted in accordance with the manufacturers
instructions and maintenance manuals.
<P>
 c. Check and adjust operation of modulation controller.  Ensure
proper, efficient and clean combustion through range of firing
rates.
<P>
  When above adjustments and corrections have been made, record
all data.
<P>
<LI><B>FINAL TEST</B>
<P>
 Perform a final combustion analysis with a warmed up boiler,
steam generator, or process heater at high, medium and low fire,
whenever possible.  In addition to data from  combustion analysis,
also check and record:
<P>
 a. Fuel pressure at burner (High, Medium, and Low).
<P>
 b. Draft above draft hood or barometric damper (High, Medium
and Low).
<P>
 c. Steam pressure or water temperature entering and leaving boiler,
steam generator, or process heater.
<P>
 d. Unit rate if meter is available.
<P>
 When the above checks and adjustments have been made, record
data and attach combustion analysis data to boiler, steam generator,
or process heater records indicating name and signature of person,
title, company name, company address and date the tuneup was performed.

<B>RULE 1150.1. CONTROL OF GASEOUS EMISSIONS FROM ACTIVE LANDFILLS</B>
<P>
<B>(a) Summary</B>
<P>
The purpose of this rule is to reduce gaseous emissions from active
landfills to prevent public nuisance and possible detriment to
public health caused by exposure to such emissions.  The rule
requires in an active landfill, a landfill gas control system
approved by the Executive Officer.
<P>
The rule requires installation of the landfill gas control system
sufficient to draw landfill gas toward the gas collection devices
without overdraw that would adversely affect the system.  Sample
probes shall be installed at the perimeter of the landfill to
monitor off-site migration.  Sufficient landfill gas shall be
collected to prevent the average concentration of total organic
compounds over a certain area on the surface of the landfill from
exceeding 50 ppm.  The concentration of organic compounds and
any toxic air contaminants shall be determined when the landfill
gas control system commences operation and periodically thereafter.
 Air samples at the perimeter of the landfill shall be analyzed
to determine off-site migration.  Results of such determination
shall be reported to the Executive Officer on a quarterly basis.
 The maximum concentration of organic compounds as methane, measured
at any point on the surface of the landfill, shall not exceed
500 ppm.
<P>
The rule requires determination of efficiencies of the disposal
system of the collected landfill gas.  Such efficiencies shall
be measured when the landfill gas control system commences operation
and periodically thereafter.  Mitigation measures shall be implemented
as necessary during installation of the system to ensure no public
nuisance.  Mitigation measures and all methods of measurements
and evaluations are to be approved by the Executive Officer.
<P>
A compliance schedule is provided as a guide to achieve compliance
by January 1, 1989.  The owner/operator shall apply for a permit
to construct and a permit to operate any expansion or modification
to the landfill gas control system not covered by the approved
plan, prior to beginning the expansion or modification.

<B>RULE 1150.2. CONTROL OF GASEOUS EMISSIONS FROM INACTIVE LANDFILLS</B>
<P>
<B>(a) Summary</B>
<P>
The purpose of this rule is to reduce gaseous emissions from inactive
landfills to prevent public nuisance and  possible detriment to
public health caused by  exposure to such emissions.  Based on
the established criteria and from the available information, the
District will determine whether the gas generated from the landfill
needs to be collected.  If so, the owner shall install a landfill
gas control system approved by the Executive Officer.
<P>
The rule requires installation of the landfill gas control system
sufficient to draw landfill gas toward the gas collection devices
without overdraw that would adversely affect the system.  Sample
probes shall be installed at the perimeter of the landfill to
monitor off-site migration.  Sufficient landfill gas shall be
collected to prevent the average concentration of total organic
compounds over a certain area on the surface of the landfill from
exceeding 50 ppm.  The concentration of total organic compounds,
and any toxic air contaminants shall be determined when the landfill
gas control system commences operation and periodically thereafter.
 Air samples at the perimeter of the landfill shall be analyzed
to determine off-site migration.  Results from such determination
shall be reported to the Executive Officer.  The maximum concentration
of organic compounds as methane, measured at any point on the
surface of the landfill, shall not exceed 500 ppm.
<P>
The rule also requires the proper disposal of collected gas. 
The efficiency of the gas disposal system shall be determined
when the landfill gas control system commences operation and periodically
thereafter.  Mitigation measures shall be implemented as necessary
during the installation of the system to prevent public nuisance.
 Mitigation measures and methods of determination shall be approved
by the Executive Officer.

(Adopted January 4, 1991)(Amended January 13, 1995)
<P>
<B>RULE 1153. COMMERCIAL BAKERY OVENS</B>
<P>
(a) Applicability
<P>
This rule controls volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from
commercial bakery ovens with a rated heat input capacity of 2
million BTU per hour or more and with an average daily emission
of 50 pounds or more of VOC.
<P>
(b) Definitions
<P>
For the purpose of this rule the following definitions shall apply:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>AVERAGE DAILY EMISSIONS is the product of the total calendar
year emissions (in tons/year) divided by the number of days the
oven was employed for production during that year.
<P>
<LI>BAKERY OVEN is an oven for baking bread or any other yeast
leavened products by convection.
<P>
<LI>BASE YEAR is the calendar 1989 or any subsequent calendar
year in which the average daily emissions are 50 pounds or more
per day.
<P>
<LI>EMISSIONS are any VOC formed and released from the oven as
a result of the fermentation and baking processes of yeast leavened
products.
<P>
<LI>EXEMPT COMPOUNDS are any of the following compounds which
have been determined to be non-precursors of ozone:
<P>
(A) Group I (General)
<P>
chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22)<BR>
dichlorotrifluoroethane (HCFC-123)<BR>
tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a)<BR>
dichlorofluoroethane (HCFC-141b)<BR>
chlorodifluoroethane (HCFC-142b)<BR>
trifluoromethane (HFC-23)<BR>
2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC-124)<BR>

dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12)<BR>
trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11)<BR>
dichlorotetrafluoroethane (CFC-114)<BR>
chloropentafluoroethane (CFC-115)
<P>
  The use of Group II compounds and/or carbon tetrachloride may
be restricted in the future because they are toxic, potentially
toxic, upper-atmosphere ozone depleters, or cause other environmental
impacts.  By January 1, 1996, production of chlorofluorocarbons
(CFC), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (methyl chloroform), and carbon tetrachloride
will be phased out in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulation
Title 40, Part 82 (December 10, 1993).

to the dough or sponge and placing it into the oven, expressed
in hours.
<P>
<LI>LEAVEN is to raise a dough by causing gas to permeate it.
<P>
<LI>VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) is any volatile compound
containing the element carbon, excluding carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, carbonic acid, metallic carbides or carbonates, methane,
and exempt compounds.
<P>
<LI>YEAST PERCENTAGE is the pounds of yeast per hundred pounds

are reduced by at least 95 percent by weight (as carbon) if the
uncontrolled average daily VOC emissions are 50 pounds or more.
<P>
</OL>
(d) Compliance Schedule
<P>
No person shall operate a bakery oven subject to this rule unless
the following increments of progress are met:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>For bakery ovens subject to subparagraph (c)(1)(A):
<P>
 (A) By January 1, 1992, submit required applications for permits
to construct and operate.
<P>
 (B) By July 1, 1993, demonstrate compliance with subparagraph
(c)(1)(A).

<P>
<B>RULE 1158. STORAGE, HANDLING, AND TRANSPORT OF PETROLEUM COKE</B>
<P>
<B>(a) Summary</B>
<P>
The purpose of this rule is to reduce the potential of a public
nuisance being generated by the emissions of airborne particulates
from the storage, handling, and transport of petroleum coke. 
The rule will prohibit the open storage of petroleum coke after
January 1, 1985, unless the operators can demonstrate that the
pile poses no significant risk of violating any other District
rule including the public nuisance rule.  It is intended that
the burden of proof will be on the operator.
<P>
Each operator of an open storage facility will be required to
submit an Interim Petroleum Coke Storage Control Plan describing
the steps that will be taken to construct enclosed structures
and the interim measures that will be taken to mitigate any potential
dust emissions until enclosed structures are constructed.  If
a plan cannot be approved, additional coke may not be added to
the piles until approval is granted.  The plan is the key to the
goals of the rule, since a violation of any provision of the plan
will be deemed a violation of the rule.
<P>
If the operator can demonstrate that compliance with the interim
measures will likely prevent any violations of any other rules,
the Executive Officer, after a public hearing, may approve the
interim plan to be made permanent and exempt that facility from
the requirement of enclosed storage.  Such exemption shall be
reviewed annually.  The rule provides for a compliance schedule
for constructing enclosed structures; it requires that construction
begin by July 1, 1985, and compliance be assured by June 30, 1986.
<P>
In addition, the rule requires that trucks leaving the premises
be washed and the loads watered, treated, or covered to prevent
emissions.  Furthermore, it requires the maintenance of certain
records for review by the Executive Officer.
<P>
<B>(b) Definitions</B>
<P>
For the purpose of this rule:
<P>
<ol>
<li>Petroleum Coke is the solid carbonaceous residue remaining
after all cracking and distillation of a petroleum refining operation.
<P>
<li>Open Storage is the amassing and handling of solid material
in an unconfined, uncovered pile.
<P>
<li>Enclosed Storage is the containment of solid material in a
structure or other article, contrivance, or device for which the
Executive Officer has issued a permit to operate.
<P>
<li>Facility is a parcel, that portion of a parcel, or parcels
of land in actual physical contact or separated solely by a public
roadway or other public right-of-way, on which petroleum coke
is stored, and owned or operated by the same person (or by persons
under common control).
<P>
<li>New Facility is any facility not in operation on the date
of adoption of this rule.
<P>
</ol>
<B>(c) Requirements</B>
<P>
<ol>
<li>Coke Piles
<P>
(A) A person shall not store petroleum coke in the open after
January 1, 1985, except as otherwise provided for in subparagraphs
(c)(5) or (d) of this rule.  In addition, an Interim Petroleum
Coke Storage Control Plan must be filed with the Executive Officer
and the appropriate city or county Planning Department within
30 days of the passage of this rule delineating the steps that
will be taken to construct enclosed storage structures, and describing
the interim measures that will be taken to mitigate any potential
dust emissions.  The Executive Officer shall notify the applicant
within 60 days after filing of the Plan of his approval, conditional
approval, or disapproval, or whether additional time to submit
information is required, and grant additional time to submit the
information, if necessary.  A person shall not add petroleum coke
to any open storage pile after an Interim Petroleum Coke Storage
Control Plan is disapproved until the reasons for disapproval
are overcome and such Plan as modified is approved, nor shall
any person commence open storage of coke at a new facility, unless
an Interim Petroleum Coke Storage Control Plan has been filed
and approved as provided herein.
<P>
(B) The Interim Petroleum Coke Storage Control Plan submitted
for approval shall contain as a minimum the following information:
<P>
<blockquote>
 (i) A contour map showing the location of the coke storage facility,
the locations of the coke piles, and the surrounding land use.
<P>
 (ii) Coke pile details consisting of the maximum daily amount
of coke stored within the facility, the average and maximum daily
wind velocities at the top of the coke piles, and the maximum
height and coke pile configurations.
<P>
 (iii) Mobile coke carrier details consisting of the type, size
and maximum daily number of trucks; a description of the roadways
used to transport the coke from the coke source to the facility
to final destination, and the mitigation measures employed to
contain the coke within open bed trucks.

coke handling equipment operate on-site.
<P>
 (ix) Housekeeping measures employed within and outside the facility
to prevent fugitive coke dust.
<P>
 (x) Details describing the type and method of use of any other
mitigating measures employed to prevent the release of airborne
coke dust, such as chemical suppressant systems, coke pile sealants,
coke pile covers, and/or wind barriers.
<P>
</blockquote>
(C) Persons subject to the provisions of the Interim Control Plan
shall maintain for one year daily records of the tonnage and maximum
height of the piles and the daily throughput in and out, by truckloads,
of petroleum coke and provide these records for review by the
Executive Officer on request.
<P>
<li>All trucks, whether filled or empty, shall be washed sufficiently
and all loads shall be watered, treated, covered or otherwise
protected to prevent coke from being dropped onto public or private
thoroughfares.
<P>
<li>Failure to comply with any provision of the approved Petroleum
Coke Storage Control Plan shall constitute a violation of this
rule.
<P>
<li>Compliance with the provisions of this rule or of the provisions
of the Petroleum Coke Storage Control Plan does not exempt a person
from complying with the requirements of Section 41700 and 41701
of the California Health and Safety Code, Rules 401, 402, and
403 of these Rules and Regulations, or any other applicable law,
statute, code, ordinance, rule, or regulation.
<P>
<li>In addition to the filing of the Interim Petroleum Coke Storage
control Plan, a person constructing enclosed storage shall meet
the following compliance schedule:
<P>
(A) Negotiation and signing of contracts and submission of appropriate
applications for permits to construct enclosed structures:  January
1, 1985.
<P>
(B) Initiation of construction:  July 1, 1985.
<P>
(C) Completion of construction:  June 1, 1986.
<P>
(D) Assurance of final compliance:  June 30, 1986.
<P>
</ol>
<B>(d) Exemptions</B>
<P>
If an operator of an open petroleum coke storage facility can
demonstrate that compliance with the Interim Petroleum Coke Storage
Control Plan is sufficient to pose no significant risk of violating
any other District rule, the Executive Officer may, after a hearing
to which all affected persons are invited, waive the requirement
that coke at the storage facility be enclosed and order the Interim
Plan be made permanent, subject to annual review.  At least 30
days prior to the required hearing, notice of the hearing shall
be publicized in such newspaper of general circulation as the
Executive Officer shall prescribe and shall be mailed to any person
who has requested such notice.
<P>
<B>(e) For the purpose of determining the appropriate processing
fees only, the filing of a Petroleum Coke Storage Control Plan
shall be considered the equivalent of filing an application for
permit.  The person submitting the Plan shall be assessed a filing
fee and an engineering evaluation fee as described in Rules 301
and 301.1.
<P>
(f) If any portion of this rule shall be found to be invalid or
unenforceable, such finding shall have no effect on the validity
and enforceability of the remaining portions of the rule, which
are severable and shall continue to be in full force and effect.
<P>
(g) The provisions of paragraph (a) are intended only to summarize
Rule 1158 and to give guidance as to its interpretation.  The
provisions of paragraph (a) are not separate or distinct requirements,
and if found to conflict with any other provision, there shall
be no effect on the validity and enforceability  of the rest of
the rule.</B>

<OL>
<LI>All definitions stated in Regulation X, Subpart F.
<P>
<LI>Leak means the detection of vinyl chloride from any location
other than a stack vent or designed equipment opening from which
vinyl chloride exceeds the background concentration by 10 ppm.
 Such determination shall be made 5 centimeters from the potential
source, using an analyzer employing flame ionization or photodetection
methods, which may be portable, and having a sensitivity of at
least 1 ppm, or by employing any device or analyzer which the
Executive Officer determines is equivalent.
<P>

or polyvinyl chloride plant.
<P>
<LI>Continuous Stack Monitoring means sampling is done on a continuous
basis, with actual samples being taken at least every fifteen
minutes.
<P>
<LI>Modification means a physical change in, or a change in the
method of operation of, a designated plant.  For the purposes
of this definition:
<P>
(A) Routine maintenance or repair shall not be considered to be
physical changes, and
<P>
(B) A change in production rate or operating hours shall not be

(d) Ambient Air Concentration Requirements
<P>
A person operating a designated plant shall not allow the discharge
into the atmosphere of any materials which result in ambient concentrations
of vinyl chloride which are equal to or greater than ten parts
per billion of vinyl chloride, 24-hour average measured at any
point beyond the property line of such plant at which persons
reside or work.  Such measurements shall be performed using methods
specified by the California Air Resources Board or any other method
approved by the Executive Officer in establishing the Vinyl Chloride
Ambient Air Quality Standard.  A copy of such methods may be obtained
from the District Executive Officer upon request.
<P>
(e) Air Pollution Control Equipment
<OL>
<P>
<LI>The owner or operator of the air pollution control equipment
specified in this rule shall at all times operate such equipment
at an efficiency sufficient to limit the total amount of vinyl
chloride in the discharge of all such control equipment at less
than 50 grams per hour for polyvinyl chloride plants and less
than 50 grams per hour for both ethylene dichloride and vinyl
chloride plants.  Such 50 grams per hour limit shall apply to
the discharge of control equipment serving all polyvinyl chloride
plants on a premise.  A separate 50 grams per hour limit shall
apply to the discharge of control equipment serving any combination
of ethylene dichloride and vinyl chloride plants on a premise.
<P>
<LI>A continuous stack monitoring system, or equivalent, measuring
the flow rate, concentration, and showing the mass flow rate of
vinyl chloride discharged from the control equipment shall be
installed.  Such system shall be approved by the Executive Officer
prior to installation.  Violations of the standard specified in
subparagraph (e)(1), as measured by such systems, shall be reported
to the Executive Officer within two hours of such measurements.
 The records from such monitoring equipment shall be maintained
for two years and shall be summarized monthly in the form and
manner specified by the Executive Officer.  Whenever the stack
monitoring system is not in proper operation or out of service,
alternate methods shall be used to monitor the vinyl chloride
concentrations on an hourly schedule.  The Executive Officer may
waive the requirements of this subparagraph for those operations
for which he deems them unnecessary, and shall notify the District
Board of the granting of such waivers in writing.
<P>
<LI>Other methods may be employed which reduce vinyl chloride
emissions to the same degree of parpgraphs (c) and (e)(1) provided
that:
<P>
(A) A control plan is submitted which details the measures which
the owner or operator intends to implement, and such plan is approved
by the Executive Officer, based on his findings that such measures
are equivalent to the measures required by subparagraph (e)(1).
<P>
(B) Applications are submitted for new permits to construct or
operate both the basic and control equipment involved regardless
of whether modifications or additions are to be made either to
the basic or control equipment, or both.  Existing permits to
operate pertaining to the basic and control equipment as specified
above shall be surrendered and cancelled at the time such new
permits to construct or operate are issued.  Such new permits
shall not be effective unless surrender of such existing permits
has been made.  If such new permits are denied, such existing
permits surrendered pursuant to this section shall be re-issued
and restored subject to the same conditions which were applicable
to the original permits prior to surrender and the provisions
of subparagraph (e)(1) shall be applicable.  The Executive Officer
shall impose those written conditions on such new permits specifying
emission limits or other conditions which may be necessary to
insure that the emission limitations under this rule are met.

such as stripping, blending or drying, shall be discharged to
a sealed container, which shall be vented to a receiving vessel;
or stripped to a degree acceptable to the Executive Officer before
discharge.
<P>
<LI>Failure of the rupture disc preceding an emergency relief
valve which results in a discharge to the atmosphere of vinyl
chloride monomer from equipment upstream of a stripping operation
shall be deemed a violation of this rule, unless the gaseous discharge
is vented to a receiving vessel or air pollution control equipment.
 An equivalent system which has been approved by the Executive
Officer may be substituted for the requirement for venting the
discharge of the emergency relief valve.  Any discharge to the
atmosphere of vinyl chloride from such an equivalent system shall
be deemed a violation of this rule.
<P>
<LI>Reactors and other equipment upstream from the stripper shall
be equipped with automatic pressure reduction systems which will
open at a pressure between operating pressure and the emergency
pressure relief valve setting.  The vapors from such pressure
reduction systems shall be directed to a receiving vessel, vapor

<B>RULE 1301. GENERAL</B>
<P>
(a) Purpose
<P>
 This regulation sets forth pre-construction review requirements
for new, modified, or relocated facilities, to ensure that the
operation of such facilities does not interfere with progress
in attainment of the national ambient air quality standards, and
that future economic growth within the South Coast Air Quality
Management District (District) is not unnecessarily restricted.
 The specific air quality goal of this regulation is to achieve
no net increases from new or modified permitted sources of nonattainment
air contaminants or their precursors.
<P>
 In addition to nonattainment air contaminants, this regulation
will also limit emission increases of ammonia, and Ozone Depleting
Compounds (ODCs) from new, modified or relocated facilities by
requiring the use of Best Available Control Technology (BACT).

<P>
(b) Applicability
<OL><P>
<LI>The provisions of this regulation shall apply to the installation
of a new source and to the modification of an existing source
which may cause the issuance of any nonattainment air contaminant,
any ODC, or ammonia at any facility.  For facilities subject to
Regulation XX - RECLAIM, Regulation XIII only applies to pollutants
not specifically regulated by Regulation XX.
<P>
<LI>Construction of new, or modification of existing power plants
subject to Public Resources Code 25500 and following sections
shall be evaluated and processed in accordance with the regulations
of the California Energy Resources Conservation and Development
Commission governing such facilities.<U> </U>
<P>
<LI>Any non-road or qualifying portable internal combustion engine
as defined in Rule 301(b)(11) and (b)(13) subject to EPA regulations,
shall upon approval by the Executive Offier or designee be exempt
from Regulation XIII. 
<P>
<LI>Any equipment registered pursuant to Rule 2100 - Registration
of Portable Equipment shall be exempt from Regulation XIII.<U>
</U>
</OL><P>
(c) Effective Date
<OL><P>
<LI>Implementation Date
<P>
This regulation, as amended on December 7, 1995 shall become effective
on February 1, 1996.  Applications received by the District shall
be subject to Regulation XIII as amended and in effect at the
time such application is deemed complete, regardless of the date
of equipment installation.
<P>
 <LI>NSR Balance<BR>
All positive NSR balances will be adjusted to zero on  December
7, 1995.
</OL><P>
(d) State Standards
<P>
For the purpose of this regulation, all references to the national
ambient air quality standards and nonattainment shall be interpreted
to include state ambient air quality standards.  This subsection
shall not be included as part of any revision to the District's
portion of the State Implementation Plan (SIP).
<P>
(e) Compliance
<P>
Failure to comply with the requirements of Regulation XIII - New
Source Review, shall result in enforcement action pursuant to
the California Health and Safety Code and/or the federal Clean
Air Act.

<BODY>

<P>
(Adopted Sept. 10, 1982)(Amended Dec. 3, 1982)(Amended July 12,
1985)<BR>
(Amended June 28, 1990)(Amended May 3, 1991)(Amended August 13,
1993)
<BR>
 (Amended December 7, 1995)
<P>
<B>RULE 1309. EMISSION REDUCTION CREDITS</B>
<P>
This rule addresses the application, eligibility, registration,
use, and transfer of Emission Reduction Credits (ERCs).  These
credits shall be used as offsets for emission increases at new
or modified facilities that are subject to Rule 1303(b)(2).
<P>
(a) Validation of Existing, Qualifying Net Emission Decreases
<OL><P>
 <LI>Existing NSR Balances
<P>
  Facilities which according to District records have a net emission
decrease since October 8, 1976, shall receive ERCs after the net
emission decrease has been discounted by 80 percent and verified
by the Executive Officer or designee.  Upon validation, an ERC
shall be registered in the Register of Title<STRIKE>s</STRIKE>
as a current ERC.
<P>
 <LI>Existing ERCs
<P>
 Any ERC based on an application which was deemed complete prior
to September 28, 1990, resulting from the additional control of
air contaminants through process changes or the installation of
air pollution control equipment, unless included as an AQMP measure
at the time, shall not be discounted.  All other ERCs shall be
discounted by 80 percent and reissued.
<P>
 
</OL><P>
(b) Application for an ERC for a New Emission Reduction
<P>
 In order to obtain an ERC, an application made in the form and
along with supporting data and documents required by the Executive
Officer or designee shall be submitted for each existing source
that is to be modified or permanently taken out of service.  The
application shall be submitted no more than 90 days after the
emission reduction occurs.
<OL><P>
 <LI>The Executive Officer or designee shall not deem an ERC application
complete nor process such application unless and until the ERC
applicant supplies supporting data and documents to the District,
including but not limited to:
<P>
  (A) the amount and type of emissions;
<P>
  (B) the date on which the emission reduction took place or is
planned to   take place;
<P>
  (C) the Regulation XIII zone from which the ERC is to originate;
<P>
  (D) the reason for the emission reduction, such as a process
change,    addition of control equipment, or equipment or facility
shutdown; and
<P>
  (E) surrender of applicable District operating permits whenever
emission   reductions are the result of either equipment or facility
shutdown.
<P>
 <LI>The Executive Officer or designee shall notify the ERC applicant
in writing within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the ERC application
whether the application contains sufficient information to be
deemed complete.  Upon receipt of any additional information,
a new 30-day period will begin, during which time the Executive
Officer or designee shall determine and notify the applicant whether
the application is complete.  An application which continues to
be deemed incomplete 180 days after the date of the first submittal
shall be cancelled by the Executive Officer or designee.  A determination
of incompleteness may be appealed to the District Hearing Board.
<P>
 <LI>Preliminary Decision
<P>
  No later than 180 days after the application for an ERC is deemed
complete, a preliminary written decision shall be given that all,
part, or none of the emission reductions can be registered as
an ERC.
<P>
 <LI>Emission Reduction Eligibility Requirements
<P>
  All Emission Reduction Credits shall be calculated pursuant
to Rule 1306 and be subject to the approval of the Executive Officer
or designee.  The Executive Officer or designee shall consider
reductions of air contaminants resulting from removal of equipment
from service, and the additional control of mobile and stationary
sources.  The applicant must demonstrate to the Executive Officer
or designee that all stationary and mobile source reductions are:
<P>
 (A) real;
<P>
 (B) quantifiable;
<P>
 (C) permanent;
<P>
 (D) federally enforceable, and
<P>
 (E) not greater than the equipment would have achieved if operating
with current Best Available Control Technology (BACT).
<P>
  Reductions in emissions due to changes in the hours of operation
shall not qualify for an ERC.
<P>
  The BACT adjustment shall not apply to facilities located in
the SEDAB.
<P>
 <LI>Evaluation
<P>
  In evaluating the applications for ERC submitted pursuant to
this regulation, the Executive Officer or designee shall consider
emission reductions only if before a complete application is submitted,
the same emission reductions from the same equipment type as those
proposed by the applicant are not:
<P>
  (A) required by a Control Measure in the AQMP which has been
assigned a target implementation date; or
<P>
  (B) required by a proposed District rule for which the first
public workshop to consider such a rule has been conducted.  This
exclusion shall remain in effect for 12 months from the date of
such workshop, or until the Executive Officer or designee determines
that the proposed rule is abandoned or the provisions of subparagraph
(5)(C) become effective; or
<P>
  (C) required by an adopted federal, State, or District rule,
regulation, or statute; or
<P>
  (D) from a category or class of equipment included in a demonstration
program required by a District rule or regulation.
</OL><P>
(c) Registration of ERCs
<P>
 Upon the Executive Officer's or designee's final determination
to grant an ERC, the title to the ERC shall be registered in the
Register of Title.  All information concerning the title, interests,
pertinent dates and other matters shall be registered, until the
Certificate of Title is canceled or nullified by operation of
law.
<P>
(d) Use of ERCs
<P>
 ERCs may be used by the owner to offset emission increases due
to new or modified sources of air pollution and to the extent
allowed by federal law.  An ERC shall qualify as an offset upon
surrender of the Certificate to the District.  Such ERC shall
be used in a manner consistent with the Certificate record and
in accordance with all other requirements of this regulation at
the time of use, including the applicable offset ratio, determined
pursuant to Rule 1303.
<P>
(e) Transfer of ERCs by Registered Owner
<P>
 Transfer of the whole or any portion of an interest in a registered
ERC is allowed, provided it is in writing, accompanied by the
sale price of such ERCs, in dollars per pound, signed by the transferor,
and acknowledged in any form authorized by law.  Upon filing such
instrument with the District, the transfer shall be complete and
the title so transferred shall vest in the transferee.  A new
Certificate, certifying the title to the estate or interest in
the ERC, shall be issued and the last previous original Certificate
shall be cancelled.  Such cancellation shall be recorded in the
Register.
<P>
(f) Mobile Source Credit
<P>
 Emission Reduction Credits shall be granted for emission reductions
from the control of mobile sources pursuant to Regulation XVI
rules.
<P>
 
<OL><P>
<LI>ERCs may be issued based on emission reductions which comply
with all requirements of any Regulation XVI rule.
<P>
<LI>Limitations
<P>
(A) The Executive Officer or designee will approve plans for scrapping
vehicles pursuant to Rule 1610, for no more than 30,000 vehicles
per year.
<P>
(B) Any permit to construct or operate a new or modified permit
unit based upon ERCs obtained through the provisions of a Regulation
XVI rule shall expire within the period for which the ERCs are
issued, unless further emission offsets equal to or greater than
such ERCs are obtained, or the subject permit unit's potential
to emit is reduced to the extent that the ERCs granted pursuant
to this paragraph would no longer be necessary.
<P>
(C) Pursuant to Rule 504, no variance or series of variances,
including emergency granting of a variance, from a permit condition
implementing a Regulation XIII offset requirement shall be granted
if such permit condition is based upon the use of MSERCs.
</OL><P>
(g) Interpollutant Offsets
<P>
 The Executive Officer or designee may approve interpollutant
offsets on a case-by-case basis, provided that the trade results
in an equivalent or greater offset of the new, modified, or relocated
source's nonattainment pollutants; and that the applicant demonstrates,
to the satisfaction of the Executive Officer or designee, that
the emissions from the new or modified source will not cause or
significantly contribute to the violation of an ambient air quality
standard as specified in Table A-2.
<P>
 Interpollutant trades between PM10 and PM10 precursors may be
allowed.  PM10 emissions shall not be allowed to offset NOx or
ROG emissions in ozone nonattainment areas.  All interpollutant
trading shall be subject to EPA's review and approval.
<P>
(h) Inter-Basin and Inter-District Offsets
<OL><P>
 <LI>Offsets between different stationary sources located in different
air control districts shall be allowed so long as the air districts
are in the same air basin.
<P>
 <LI>Offsets between different stationary sources located in different
air basins shall be allowed only when:
<P>
  (A) The stationary source to which the emission reductions are
credited is located in an upwind district that is classified as
being in a worse nonattainment status than the downwind district
pursuant to Chapter 10 of the Health and Safety Code commencing
with Section 40910; and
<P>
  (B) The stationary source at which there are emission increases
to be offset is located in a downwind district that is overwhelmingly
impacted by emissions transported from the upwind district, as
determined by the state board pursuant to Health and Safety Code
Section 39610.
<P>
 <LI>Any offset transaction credited pursuant to paragraphs (h)(1)
and (h)(2) above shall be approved by resolution adopted by the
Governing Board of the upwind district and the Governing Board
of the downwind district.  The adopting resolution shall consider
the impact of the offset on air quality, public health, and the
regional economy.

 (A) Access to Priority Reserve Credits shall be prioritized based
on qualifying as an Essential Public Service and then, on the
earliest date that an application is deemed complete.
<P>
 (B) Each facility shall maintain a balance of total Priority
Reserve Credits obtained.
<P>
 (C) Essential Public Services may, at the discretion of the Executive
Officer or designee, reserve Priority Reserve Offsets for up to
three years to allow multiyear projects to be planned.  The sum
of such reservations shall amount to no more than 25 percent of
the Priority Reserve allocation for those three years.
<P>
 (D) The AQMD Governing Board may determine that a specific project
shall be given priority for access to the priority reserve based
on public health or safety regardless of date of application submitted.
<P>
 (E) If a subject facility holds an Emission Reduction Credit
(ERC), then that ERC must be used before access to the Priority
Reserve is allowed.
<P>
 (F) Allocations from the Priority Reserve shall not be banked
or transferred.

<B>RULE 1313. PERMITS TO OPERATE</B>
<P>
(a) Change of Operator
<P>
 The Executive Officer or designee shall exempt from the provisions
of this rule any facility which is a continuing operation, without
modification or change in operating conditions, when a permit
to operate is required solely because of permit renewal, change
in operator, or a change in Rule 219 (Equipment Not Requiring
a Permit).
<P>
(b) No Permit to Construct Issued
<P>
 For new or modified sources or facilities which are constructed
without the required Permit to Construct, the application for
a Permit to Operate shall, for the purpose of this rule, be considered
an application for a Permit to Construct.  The Executive Officer
or designee shall deny the Permit to Operate unless the new or
modified facility complies with all provisions of Regulation XIII.
 All offsets must be obtained within 90 days after notice from
the Executive Officer or designee that offsets are required.
<P>
(c) Additional Offsets
<P>
 The Permit to Operate shall be denied if it is determined that
actual emissions are greater than previously calculated when the
Permit to Construct was issued, unless additional offsets are
obtained within 90 days after notice from the Executive Officer
or designee that offsets are required to mitigate the increase.
<P>
(d) Start-Up
<P>
 For a new source or modification which will be a replacement,
in whole or part, for an existing source on the same or contiguous
property, a maximum of 90 days may be allowed as a start-up period
for simultaneous operation of the subject sources. 
<P>
(e) Permit Conditions
<P>

<P>
(Adopted June 1, 1990)(Amended December 7, 1990)
<P>
<B>RULE 1401. NEW SOURCE REVIEW OF CARCINOGENIC AIR CONTAMINANTS</B>
<P>
(a) Purpose
<P>
 This rule specifies limits for maximum individual cancer risk
and estimated excess cancer cases from new permit units, relocations,
or modifications to existing permit units which emit carcinogenic
air contaminants.  The rule establishes allowable risks for all
such permit units requiring new permits pursuant to Rules 201
or 203.
<P>
(b) Applicability
<P>
 Applications for new, relocated, and modified permit units which
were received by the District on or after June 1, 1990 shall be
subject to Rule 1401.  Permit units installed without a required
permit to construct shall be subject to this rule, if the application
for a permit to operate such equipment was submitted after June
1, 1990.  The compounds listed in Table I will change periodically
as new information becomes available.  Applications shall be subject
to the version of Rule 1401 that is in effect at the time the
application is received.
<P>
(c) Definitions
<OL>
 <LI>BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY FOR TOXICS <BR>
(T-BACT) means the most stringent emissions limitation or control
technique which:
<P>
  (A) has been achieved in practice for such permit unit category
or class of source; or
<P>
  (B) is any other emissions limitation or control technique,
including process and equipment changes of basic and control equipment,
found by the Executive Officer to be technologically feasible
for such class or category of sources, or for a specific source.
<P>
 <LI>CARCINOGENIC AIR CONTAMINANT is a substance that has been
shown to cause cancer in animals or humans.  For the purpose of
this rule, carcinogenic air contaminants are those listed in Table
I.
<P>
 <LI>CONTEMPORANEOUS EMISSION REDUCTION means any real, permanent,
and enforceable emission reduction that has occurred after the
submittal of an application for a permit to construct, but before
the start of operation of the permit unit associated with the
application.
<P>
 <LI>EXCESS CANCER CASES means the estimated increase in the occurrence
of cancer cases in a population subject to a lifetime (70 years)
individual cancer risk of greater than or equal to one in one
million <BR>
(1 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP>) resulting from exposure to carcinogenic air contaminants.
<P>
 <LI>MAXIMUM INDIVIDUAL CANCER RISK is the estimated probability
of a potential maximally exposed individual contracting cancer
as a result of exposure to carcinogenic air contaminants over
a period of 70 years.
<P>
 <LI>MODIFICATION means any physical change in, change in method
of operation of, or addition to an existing permit unit that requires
an application for a permit to construct and/or operate.  Routine
maintenance and/or repair shall not be considered a physical change.
 A change in the method of operation of equipment, unless previously
limited by an enforceable permit condition, shall not include:
<P>
  (A) an increase in the production rate, unless such increase
will cause the maximum design capacity of the equipment to be
exceeded; or
<P>
  (B) an increase in the hours of operation; or
<P>
  (C) a change in ownership of a source.
<P>
 <LI>PERMIT UNIT means any article, machine, equipment, or other
contrivance, or combination thereof, which may cause or control
the issuance of air contaminants, and which requires a written
permit pursuant to Rules 201 and/or 203.  For publicly-owned sewage
treatment operations each process within multi-process permit
units at the facility shall be considered a separate permit unit
for purposes of this rule.
<P>
 <LI>RECEPTOR LOCATION means any location outside the boundaries
of the stationary source facility.
<P>
 <LI>RELOCATION means the removal of an existing permit unit from
one location in the South Coast Air Quality Management District
and installation at another location.  The removal of a permit
unit from one location within a stationary source and installation
at another location within the stationary source is a relocation
only if an increase in maximum individual cancer risk in excess
of one in one million (1 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP>) occurs at any receptor location.
<P>
 <LI>STATIONARY SOURCE means any permit unit or grouping of permit
units or other air contaminant-emitting activities which are located
on one or more contiguous properties within the District, in actual
physical contact or separated solely by a public roadway or other
public right-of-way, and are owned or operated by the same person
(or by persons under common control).  Such above-described groupings,
if remotely located and connected only by land carrying a pipeline,
shall not be considered one stationary source.
<P>
 <LI>ACCEPTABLE STACK HEIGHT for a permit unit is defined as
a stack height that does not exceed two and one half times the
height of the permit unit or two and one half times the height
of the building housing the permit unit, and shall not be greater
than 65 meters (213 feet), unless the applicant demonstrates to
the satisfaction of the Executive Officer that a greater height
is necessary.
</OL>
(d) Requirements
<P>
 The Executive Officer shall deny the permit to construct a new,
relocated or modified permit unit if emissions of any carcinogenic
air contaminant may occur, unless the applicant has substantiated
that the cumulative impact of emissions from the new, relocated
or modified permit unit and all other permit units located within
a radius of 100 meters owned or operated by the applicant for
which applications were submitted on or after June 1, 1990 will
not result in any of the following:
<OL>
 <LI>a maximum individual cancer risk greater than one in one
million <BR>
(1 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP>) at any receptor location, if the permit unit is constructed
without T-BACT;
<P>
 <LI>a maximum individual cancer risk greater than ten in one
million  <BR>
(1 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP>) at any receptor location, if the permit unit is constructed
with <BR>
T-BACT;
<P>
 <LI>greater than 0.5 excess cancer cases in the population subject
to a risk of greater than one in one million (1 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP>).
<P>
 The maximum individual cancer risk may not exceed 1/70 of the
maximum allowable risk specified in (d)(1) or (d)(2) in any one
year at receptor locations in residential areas.
</OL>
(e) Risk Assessment Procedures
<P>
 The Executive Officer shall periodically publish procedures for
determining risks under this rule.  To the extent possible, the
procedures will be consistent with the policies and procedures
of the California Department of Health Services.  Such procedures
shall specify:
<OL>
 <LI>Upper bound estimates of carcinogenic potency that shall
be used in evaluating risks;
<P>
 <LI>Compounds that must be subject to a multiple pathway risk
assessment.  A compound is subject to multiple pathway analysis
if the Executive Officer determines that it may reasonably be
expected to cause cancer risk through ingestion exposure, if it
is expected to deposit and persist in the environment after emission,
and if a quantitative oral potency estimate has been derived for
the compound;
<P>
 <LI>Health protective assumptions that shall be used in evaluating
exposure to compounds from inhalation and other routes of exposure.
 This will include an assumption of a 70 year<STRIKE>s</STRIKE>
period of operation for the sources of carcinogenic air contaminants;

<P>
 <LI>Risk for the potential maximally exposed individual shall
be based upon continuous exposure for 70 years in residential
areas and health protective estimates of exposure duration in
nonresidential areas;
<P>
 <LI>Estimates of pollutant dispersion and risk from a source
shall not be based upon stack height in excess of acceptable stack
height.
</OL>
(f) Emissions Calculations
<P>
 The total carcinogenic emissions for a new, relocated or  modified
permit unit(s) shall be calculated on an annual basis from permit
conditions which directly limit the emissions or, when no such
conditions are imposed, from:
<OL>
<LI>the maximum rated capacity; and
<P>
 <LI>the maximum possible annual hours of operation; and
<P>
<LI>the actual materials processed.
<P>
 For the purpose of this rule, total carcinogenic emissions from
a permit unit(s) shall be calculated and reviewed pursuant to
this rule.
</OL>
(g) Exemptions
<OL>
 <LI>The requirements of paragraph (d) shall not apply to:
<P>
 (A) Any stationary source which is a continuing operation, without
modification or change in operating conditions, for which a permit
to operate is required solely because of permit renewal or change
of ownership; or
<P>
 (B) Modification or relocation of a permit unit that causes a
reduction or no increase in the estimated cancer cases or individual
cancer risk at any receptor location.
<P>
 (C) A permit unit replacing a functio.ally identical
permit unit, providing there is no increase in maximum rating
or increase in emissions of any carcinogenic air contaminants.
<P>
 (D) Installation, construction, modification or relocation of
a permit unit if the applicant demonstrates that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  (i)a contemporaneous emission reduction in actual
emissions of carcinogenic air contaminants from a permit unit
or permit units at the stationary source will occur such that
the risk at all receptor locations is less than the risk prior
to installation, construction, modification or relocation, and
<P>
  (ii) the emissions reductions necessary to achieve the risk
reduction required by this paragraph are permanent, verifiable
and enforceable through permit conditions, and
<P>
  (iii)T-BACT will be used on new equipment that is
part of the installation, construction or modification subject
to this paragraph.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 (E) A publicly owned sewage treatment operation, or a ground
water or soil contamination cleanup or remediation operation mandated
to maintain or attain compliance with federal, state, or local
law or by judicial or administrative agency order, provided that
permit units will be constructed using T-BACT if the maximum individual
cancer risk is greater than one in one million.  The permit to
construct shall require such facilities to meet the risk requirements
of this rule not later than June 1, 1995.
<P>
 <LI>The provisions of subparagraph (d)(2) shall not apply if
the applicant demonstrates the following to the satisfaction of
the Executive Officer:
<P>
 (A) The cumulative impact of emissions from the new, relocated
or modified permit unit and all other permit units located within
a radius of 100 meters owned or operated by the applicant for
which applications were submitted on or after June 1, 1990 will
not result in a maximum individual cancer risk greater than 100
in one million (1 x 10<SUP>-4</SUP>) at any receptor location,
<P>
 (B) The unit will be constructed with T-BACT, and
<P>
 (C) The applicant has investigated, and will implement to the
extent reasonably achievable, all potential methods and processes
to reduce or control emissions to levels which would comply with
the provisions of subparagraph (d)(2), including but not limited
to:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 (i) source reduction;
<BR>
 (ii) innovative control technologies;
<BR>
 (iii) material or process substitution; and
<BR>
 (iv) alternate locations within the facility.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  The permit to construct shall require compliance with the provisions
of subparagraph (d)(2) not later than 5 years after June 1, 1990.

<TITLE>RULE 1402 - Control of Toxic Air Contaminants from Existing Sources</TITLE>

<BODY>

<P>
(Adopted April 8, 1994)
<P>
<B>RULE 1402. CONTROL OF TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS FROM EXISTING
SOURCES</B>
<P>
(a) Purpose
<P>
 The purpose of this rule is to reduce the health risk associated
with emissions of toxic air contaminants from existing sources
by specifying limits for maximum individual cancer risk (MICR)
and noncancer acute and chronic hazard index (HI) applicable to
total facility emissions and requiring facilities to implement
risk reduction plans to achieve these risk limits as required
by the Hot Spots Act.
<P>
(b) Summary
<P>
 The rule requires the operator of any facility which poses a
health risk exceeding significant risk levels of a MICR of one
hundred in one million (1.0 x 10<SUP>-4</SUP>) or a total acute or chronic
HI of five (5.0) to submit and implement a risk reduction plan
which will reduce below the significant risk levels as quickly
as feasible but by no later than five (5) years from the initial
plan submittal date.  
<P>
(c) Applicability
<P>
 This rule shall apply to any facility for which the impact of
total facility emissions exceeds any significant risk level as
indicated in one of the following:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>A health risk assessment required pursuant to the Hot Spots
Act and approved by the District;
<P>
<LI>A health risk assessment prepared by the District for the
purpose of this rule for a facility or category of facilities,
including but not limited to facilities for which the District
has prepared an industrywide emission inventory pursuant to the
Hot Spots Act; or
<P>
<LI>A health risk assessment required pursuant to subdivision
(e) of this rule and approved by the District.
</OL>
<P>
 Except for facilities subject to the rule pursuant to paragraph
(c)(2), this rule shall not apply to facilities which have not
been notified by the District to prepare a health risk assessment
pursuant to this rule or the Hot Spots Act.
<P>
(d) Definitions
<P>
<OL>
<LI>ACCEPTABLE STACK HEIGHT for a permit unit is defined as a
stack height that does not exceed two and one half times the height
of the permit unit or two and one half times the height of the
building housing the permit unit, and shall not be greater than
65 meters (213 feet), unless the operator demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Executive Officer that a greater height is
necessary.
<P>
<LI>FACILITY means any permit unit or grouping of permit units
or other air contaminant-emitting activities which are located
/n one or more contiguous properties within the District, in actual
physical contact or separately solely by a public roadway or other
public right-of-way, and are owned or operated by the same person
(or persons under common control).  Such above-described groupings,
if remotely located and connected only by land carrying a pipeline,
shall not be considered one facility.
<P>
<LI>HOT SPOTS ACT means the Air Toxics &quot;Hot Spots&quot;
Information and Assessment Act of 1987, incorporated at Part 6,
Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code, and amendments to this
act.
<P>
<LI>INDIVIDUAL SUBSTANCE ACUTE HAZARD INDEX (HI) is the ratio
of the estimated maximum one-hour concentration of a toxic air
contaminant at a receptor location to its acute reference exposure
level.
<P>
<LI>INDIVIDUAL SUBSTANCE CHRONIC HAZARD INDEX (HI) is the ratio
of the long-term level of exposure to a toxic air contaminant
for a potential maximally exposed individual to the chronic reference
exposure level for the toxic air contaminant.
<P>
<LI>INITIAL PLAN SUBMITTAL DATE is the date that the initial
risk reduction plan is submitted to the District, but no later
than six months following notification by the Executive Officer
that a risk reduction plan is required.
<P>
<LI>MAXIMUM INDIVIDUAL CANCER RISK (MICR) is the estimated probability
of a potential maximally exposed individual contracting cancer
as a result of exposure to toxic air contaminants.
<P>
<LI>OPERATOR means the person who owns or operates a facility
or part of a facility.
<P>
<LI>RECEPTOR LOCATION means:
<P>
  (A) for the purpose of calculating acute HI, any location outside
the boundaries of the facility at which a person could experience
acute exposure; and
<P>
  (B) for the purpose of calculating chronic HI or MICR, any location
outside the boundaries of the facility at which a person could
experience chronic exposure.
<P>
  The Executive Officer shall consider the possibility of potential
exposure at a location in determining whether the location will
be considered a receptor location.
<P>
<LI>RISK REDUCTION MEASURE is a control measure which will reduce
or eliminate the health risk associated with emissions of toxic
air contaminants, is real, permanent, quantifiable, and enforceable
through District permit conditions if applicable, and meets the
requirements of the Hot Spots Act.  Risk reduction measures may
include, but are not limited to feedstock modification; product
reformulations; production system modifications; system enclosure,
emissions control, capture or conversion; operational standards
or practices modifications; emissions collection and exhaust;
source control; or alternative technologies.
<P>
<LI>SIGNIFICANT RISK LEVEL for purpose of this rule is a MICR
of one hundred in one million (1.0 x 10<SUP>-4</SUP>) or a total acute or
chronic HI greater than five (5.0) for any target organ system
at any receptor location, as calculated for the toxic air contaminants
listed in Tables I, II and III.
<P>
<LI>TOTAL ACUTE HAZARD INDEX (HI) is the sum of the individual
substance acute HIs for all toxic air contaminants identified
in the risk assessment guidelines as affecting the same target
organ system.
<P>
<LI>TOTAL CHRONIC HAZARD INDEX (HI) is the sum of the individual
substance chronic HIs for all toxic air contaminants identified
in the risk assessment guidelines as affecting the same target
organ system.
<P>
<LI>TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT is an air pollutant which may cause
or contribute to an increase in mortality or serious illness,
or which may pose a present or potential hazard to human health.
 For the purpose of this rule, toxic air contaminants are those
listed in Tables I, II and III.
<P>
</OL>
(e) Risk Assessment Requirements
<P>
 Within 150 days of the date of notification by the Executive
Officer, an operator shall submit to the District a health risk
assessment for total facility emissions.  The Executive Officer
may require a health risk assessment from a facility when in possession
of information indicating that emission levels from the facility
could potentially cause exceedance of the significant risk levels.
<P>
(f) Risk Reduction Requirements
<P>
 The following requirements shall apply to the operator of any
facility whose emissions cause an exceedance of any significant
risk level as indicated in a health risk assessment approved or
prepared by the District:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Risk Level Attainment Requirements
<P>
  The operator shall implement the risk reduction measures specified
in a risk reduction plan approved by the Executive Officer to
reduce the impact of total facility emissions below the significant
risk levels as quickly as feasible but by no later than five (5)
years from the initial plan submittal date.  Each risk reduction
measure in an approved plan shall be implemented by the dates
specified in the plan for that risk reduction measure.
<P>
<LI>Submittal of Risk Reduction Plans
<P>
  (A) The Executive Officer shall publish procedures for preparing
risk reduction plans under this rule.  The procedures shall include
self-conducted audits and checklists which may be used by certain
categories of facilities in lieu of preparing a risk reduction

measures as quickly as feasible.  The schedule shall include the
submittal of all necessary applications for permits to construct
or modify within 180 days of approval of the plan, or in accordance
with another schedule subject to approval of the Executive Officer,
and specify the dates for other increments of progress associated
with implementation of the risk reduction measures;
<P>
   (vii) An estimation of the residual health risk after implementation
of the specified risk reduction measures;
<P>
   (viii) Proof of certification of the risk reduction plan as
meeting all requirements by an engineer who is registered as a
professional engineer pursuant to Business and Professions Code
Section 6762, by an individual who is officially responsible for
the processes and operations of the facility, or by a registered
environmental assessor.
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>Approval of Risk Reduction Plans
<P>
  (A) The Executive Officer shall approve or reject the plan within
three (3) months of submittal based on the operator's ability
to demonstrate timely compliance with the risk level attainment
requirements of paragraph (f)(1).  The operator may appeal the
rejection of a plan or the failure of the Executive Officer to
act on a plan submittal to the Hearing Board under Rule 216. 
Plans shall be revised and resubmitted within 90 days of the date
of receipt of a rejection notice.  The revised plan shall correct
all deficiencies identified by the Executive Officer.  The approved
plan shall be subject to Rule 221.  
<P>
  (B) If the risk reduction plan contains a facility risk characterization
demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Executive Officer that
the facility does not exceed the significant risk levels, the
plan may be approved without the inclusion of the plan components
specified in subparagraphs (f)(2)(B)(iii) through (vii).
<P>
<LI>Progress Reports
<P>
  The operator shall submit to the Executive Officer for approval,
by no later than the date(s) that updates of emission inventories
are required for the facility pursuant to the Hot Spots Act and
no less frequently than every two (2) years, progress report(s)
on the emissions and risk reduction achieved by the plan which
include at a minimum all of the following:
<P>
  (A) The increments of progress achieved in implementing the
risk reduction measures specified in the plan;
<P>
  (B) A schedule indicating dates for future increments of progress;

of toxic air contaminants that have occurred at the facility,
including a description of any associated permits that were subject
to Rule 1401, since approval of the plan.
<P>
<LI>Updating of Risk Reduction Plans
<P>
  If information becomes known to the Executive Officer after
the initial plan submittal date on air toxics risks posed by the
facility or emission reduction technologies that may be used by
the facility that would substantially impact risks to exposed
persons or implementation of the risk reduction plan, the Executive
Officer may require the plan to be updated and resubmitted.  
<P>
<LI>Plan Modification for Change of Risk Reduction Measures
<P>
  Prior to a change in the risk reduction measures specified in
the currently approved plan, the operator shall submit to the
Executive Officer for approval an application for plan modification.
 The application shall include a demonstration that the change
of risk reduction measures will not result in compliance with
the significant risk levels later than provided in paragraph (f)(1).
<P>
</OL>
(g) Risk Assessment Procedures
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The Executive Officer shall periodically publish or designate
procedures for determining health risks under this rule.  To the
extent possible, the procedures shall be consistent with the policies
and procedures of the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment
(OEHHA).  Such procedures shall specify:
<P>
  (A) Acute and chronic reference exposure levels and upper bound
estimates of carcinogenic potency that shall be used in evaluating
risks;
<P>
  (B) Compounds that must be subject to a multiple pathway risk
assessment.  A compound is subject to multiple pathway analysis
if the Executive Officer determines that it may reasonably be
expected to cause health risk through ingestion exposure, if it
is expected to deposit and persist in the environment after emission,
and if a quantitative oral cancer potency estimate or reference
exposure level has been derived for the compound;
<P>
  (C) Health protective assumptions that shall be used in evaluating
exposure to compounds from inhalation and other routes of exposure.
 This will include an assumption of a 70 year period of operation
for the sources of toxic air contaminants;
<P>
  (D) Risk for the potential maximally exposed individual shall
be based upon continuous exposure for 70 years in residential
areas and health protective estimates of exposure duration in
nonresidential areas;
<P>
  (E) Estimates of pollutant dispersion and risk from a source
shall not be based upon stack height in excess of acceptable stack
height.
<P>
<LI>Within 120 days of publication of the risk assessment guidelines
required to be published by the OEHHA pursuant to the Air Toxics
&quot;Hot Spots&quot; Information and Assessment Act of 1987,
the Executive Officer shall report to the District Governing Board
if there are any material differences between the OEHHA guidelines
and the criteria specified in paragraph (g)(1) and recommend for
Board approval whether to proceed with amendments to this rule
in order to make the rule consistent with the OEHHA guidelines
before their designation as the risk assessment guidelines under
this rule.
<P>
<LI>The Executive Officer shall publish procedures for determining
the emissions estimates to be used in risk assessments in cases
in which a compound has not been detected in analyses which have
been conducted according to District-approved methods, including
procedures for excluding such compounds from risk assessments.
 The procedures shall provide methods for estimating the most
likely emission levels of nondetected compounds based on consideration
of the likelihood of presence and the method detection limits
of compounds.
<P>
</OL>
(h) Alternate Hazard Index Levels
<P>
 An alternate hazard index level may be used as the significant
risk level for a particular total acute or chronic HI if the Office
of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment determines that such
alternate hazard index level is protective against adverse health
effects.  The alternate HI level shall not in any case exceed
10.  The facility operator shall attain the alternate HI level
as quickly as feasible but by no later than five (5) years from
the initial plan submittal date.
<P>
(i) Compliance with this rule does not authorize the emission
of a toxic air contaminant in violation of any federal, state,
local or District law or regulation or exempt the operator from
any law or regulation.
<P>
(j) Risk reduction measures implemented in order to comply with
other regulatory requirements are acceptable risk reduction measures
for the purposes of this rule, provided they are consistent with
the requirements of this rule.

<title>RULE 1403 - Asbestos Emissions From Demolition/Renovation
		Activities</title>
<meta name = "OPERATOR" content = "Nate Natzke, Lana Bowman">
</head><body>
		(Adopted October 6, 1989)(Amended April 8, 1994)
<p><b>RULE 1403 -	ASBESTOS EMISSIONS FROM DEMOLITION/RENOVATION
		ACTIVITIES</b>
<p><b>(a)	Purpose</b><p>
The purpose of this rule is to specify work practice requirements to limit asbestos 
emissions from building demolition and renovation activities, including the removal 
and associated disturbance of asbestos-containing materials (ACM).  The 
requirements for demolition and renovation activities include asbestos surveying, 
notification, ACM removal procedures and time schedules, ACM handling and clean-
up procedures, and storage, disposal, and landfilling requirements for asbestos-
containing waste materials (ACWM).  All operators are required to maintain records, 
including waste shipment records, and are required to use appropriate warning labels, 
signs, and markings. 
<p><b>(b) Applicability</b><p>
This rule, in whole or in part, is applicable to owners and operators of any demolition 
or renovation activity, and the associated disturbance of asbestos-containing material, 
any asbestos storage facility, or any active waste disposal site.
<p><b>(c)  Definitions</b><p>
For the purpose of this rule, the following definitions shall apply:
<ol><li>ACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL SITE is any disposal site that receives, or has 
received or processed ACWM within the preceding 365 calendar days.
<p><li>ADEQUATELY WET is the condition of being sufficiently mixed or penetrated 
with amended water to prevent the release of particulates or visible emissions.  
The process by which an adequately wet condition is achieved is by using a 
dispenser or water hose with a nozzle that permits the use of a fine, low-pressure 
spray or mist.
<p><li>AMENDED WATER is water to which a chemical wetting agent or surfactant 
has been added to improve penetration into ACM.
<p><li>ASBESTOS is the asbestiform varieties of serpentine (chrysotile), riebeckite 
(crocidolite), cummingtonite-grunerite (amosite), anthophyllite, actinolite or 
tremolite.
<p><li>ASBESTOS-CONTAINING MATERIAL (ACM) is both friable asbestos-
containing material or Class I nonfriable asbestos-containing material.
<p><li>ASBESTOS-CONTAINING WASTE MATERIAL (ACWM) is any waste that 
contains commercial asbestos and that is generated by a source subject to the 
provisions of this rule.  ACWM includes, but is not limited to, ACM which is 
friable, has become friable, or has a high probability of becoming friable, or has 
been subjected to sanding, grinding, cutting, or abrading, and the waste 
generated from its disturbance, such as asbestos waste from control devices, 
particulate asbestos material, asbestos slurries, bags or containers that 
previously contained asbestos, used asbestos-contaminated plastic sheeting and 
clothing, and clean-up equipment waste, such as cloth rags or mop heads.
<p><li>ASBESTOS HAZARD EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT (AHERA) is the act 
which legislates asbestos-related requirements for schools (40 CFR 763, Subpart 
 e).
<p><li>CLASS I NONFRIABLE ASBESTOS-CONTAINING MATERIAL is material 
containing more than one percent (1%) asbestos as determined by paragraph 
(h)(2), and that, when dry, can be broken, crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to 
powder in the course of demolition or renovation activities.  Actions which may 
cause material to be broken, crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder include 
physical wear and disturbance by mechanical force, such as, but not limited to, 
sanding, sandblasting, cutting or abrading, improper handling or removal or 
leaching of matrix binders.  Class I nonfriable asbestos-containing material 
includes, but is not limited to, fractured or crushed asbestos cement products, 
transite materials, mastic, roofing felts, roofing tiles, cement water pipes and 
resilient floor covering.
<p><li>CLASS II NONFRIABLE ASBESTOS-CONTAINING MATERIAL is all 
other material containing more than one percent (1%) asbestos as determined by 
paragraph (h)(2), that is neither friable nor Class I nonfriable.
<p><li>COMMERCIAL ASBESTOS is any material containing asbestos that is 
extracted from asbestos ore.
<p><li>CUTTING is penetrating with a sharp-edged instrument and includes sawing, 
but does not include shearing, slicing, or punching.
<p><li>DEMOLITION is the wrecking or taking out of any load-supporting structural 
member of a facility and related handling operations or the intentional burning 
of any facility.
<p><li>EMERGENCY DEMOLITION is any demolition or remedial action under 
order of a state or local governmental agency.  Such an order is generally issued 
for a structurally unsound facility in danger of imminent collapse.
<p><li>EMERGENCY RENOVATION is any renovation that was not planned and 
results from a sudden unexpected event that results in unsafe conditions.  Such 
events include, but are not limited to, renovations necessitated by non-routine 
failures of equipment, earthquake or fire damage.
<p><li>ENCAPSULATION is the treatment of ACM with a material that surrounds or 
embeds asbestos fibers in an adhesive matrix to prevent the release of fibers, as 
the encapsulant creates a membrane over the surface (bridging encapsulant) or 
penetrates the material and binds its components together (penetrating 
encapsulant).
<p><li>FACILITY is any institutional, commercial, public, industrial or residential 
structure, installation, or building; any ship; and any active waste disposal site.
<p><li>FACILITY COMPONENT is any part of a facility including equipment.
<p><li>FRIABLE ASBESTOS-CONTAINING MATERIAL is material containing 
more than one percent (1%) asbestos as determined by paragraph (h)(2), that, 
when dry, can be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure.
<p><li>GLOVEBAG is a sealed compartment with attached inner gloves used for 
handling ACM.  When properly installed and used, glove bags provide a small 
work area enclosure used for small-scale asbestos stripping operations.  
Information on glovebag installation, equipment, and supplies, and work 
practices is contained in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's 
final rule on occupational exposure to asbestos (Appendix G to 29 CFR 
1926.58).
<p><li>HIGH EFFICIENCY PARTICULATE AIR (HEPA) FILTER is a filter capable 
of trapping and retaining at least 99.97 percent of all monodispersed particles of 
0.3 micrometer in diameter or larger.
<p><li>INSTALLATION is any building or structure or any group of buildings or 
structures at a single demolition or renovation site that are under the control of 
the same owner or operator (or owner or operator under central control).
<p><li>ISOLATED WORK AREA is the immediate enclosed containment area in 
which the asbestos abatement activity takes place.
<p><li>LEAK-TIGHT is the condition whereby any contained solids or liquids are 
prevented from escaping or spilling out.
<p><li>NONSCHEDULED RENOVATION OPERATION is a renovation operation 
necessitated by the routine failure of equipment, which is expected to occur 
within a given calendar year based on past operating experience, but for which 
an exact date cannot be predicted.
<p><li>OUTSIDE AIR is air outside of the facility or outside of the isolated work area.
<p><li>OWNER or OPERATOR OF A DEMOLITION OR RENOVATION 
ACTIVITY is any person who owns, leases, operates, controls or supervises 
activities at the facility being demolished or renovated; the demolition or 
renovation operation; or both.
<p><li>PERSON is any individual, firm, association, organization, partnership, 
business, trust, corporation, company, contractor, supplier, installer, user or 
owner, or any state or local government agency or public district or any other 
officer or employee thereof.  PERSON also means the United States or its 
agencies to the extent authorized by Federal law.
<p><li>PLANNED RENOVATION is a renovation operation, or a number of such 
operations, in which the amount of ACM that will be removed or stripped 
within a given period of time can be predicted.  Individual nonscheduled 
renovation operations are included if a number of such operations can be 
predicted to occur during a given period of time based on operating experience.
<p><li>PROJECT is any renovation or demolition activity, including site preparation 
and clean-up activity.
<p><li>REMOVAL is the taking out of ACM or facility components that contain or are 
covered with ACM from any facility.
<p><li>RENOVATION is the altering of a facility or the, removing or stripping of one 
or more facility components in any way, including, but not limited to, the 
stripping or removal of ACM from facility components, retrofitting for fire 
protection, and the installation or removal of heating, ventilation, air 
conditioning (HVAC) systems.  Activity involving the wrecking or taking out of 
load-supporting structural members are demolitions.
<p><li>RESIDENTIAL SINGLE UNIT DWELLING is a structure that contains only 
one residential unit.  Apartment buildings, townhouses, and condominiums are 
not residential single unit dwellings.
<p><li>RESILIENT FLOOR COVERING is asbestos-containing floor tile, including 
asphalt and vinyl floor tile, and sheet vinyl floor covering containing more than 
one percent (1%) asbestos as determined by paragraph (h)(2).
<p><li>STRIPPING is the taking off of ACM from any part of a facility or facility 
component.
<p><li>STRUCTURAL MEMBER is any load-supporting member of a facility, such as 
beams and load-supporting walls; or any nonload-supporting member, such as 
ceilings and nonload-supporting walls.
<p><li>WASTE GENERATOR is any person who owns or operates a source subject to 
the provisions of this rule according to section (b), and whose act or process 
produces ACWM.
<p><li>WASTE SHIPMENT RECORD is the shipping document, required to be 
originated and signed by the waste generator, used to track and substantiate the 
disposition of ACWM as specified by the provisions of subdivision (f).
<p><li>WORKING DAY is Monday through Friday and includes holidays that fall on 
any of the days Monday through Friday.

</ul></blockquote>C.	Asbestos Removal Schedule<br>
Material containing asbestos shall be removed from a facility according 
to the following schedule:
<br><blockquote>(i)	Burning Demolitions<br>
All ACM and Class II asbestos-containing material shall be 
removed from a facility prior to any demolition by intentional 
burning.
<p>(ii)	Renovations and Non-Burning Demolitions<br>
All ACM shall be removed from a facility being demolished or 
renovated before any non-burning demolition or renovation 
activity begins that would break up, dislodge, or similarly disturb 
the material or preclude access to the material for subsequent 
removal.  ACM not accessible for testing or not discovered until 
after demolition activities begin may be removed after the start of 
non-burning demolition activities. Notwithstanding the above, 
asbestos-containing packings, gaskets, resilient floor covering, and 
asphalt roofing products which are not friable and are not 
crumbled, cut, abraded, or otherwise not damaged and in good 
condition, may be removed after the start of non-burning 
demolition activities if prior approval from the District is obtained 
(Procedure 5).  If the demolition activity involves any mechanical 
force such as, but not limited to, sanding, sandblasting, cutting, or 
abrading and thus would render the materials friable, they must be 
removed prior to demolition.
</blockquote><br>(D)	Removal Procedures<br>
One or more of the following procedures shall be used when removing 
or stripping ACM:
<blockquote>(i)	Procedure 1 - HEPA Filtration<BR>
	Remove ACM within an isolated work area.  The following 
techniques shall be used during Procedure 1 ACM removal 
activities:<br><ul>
(I)	All stationary objects and surfaces not intended for 
removal or stripping of ACM shall be covered with 
plastic sheeting; 
<p>(II)	All air passageways, such as doors, windows, vents and 
registers in the work area, shall be covered and rendered 
air tight with plastic sheeting or hard wooden barriers 
with studded support.  Air passageways used to provide 
makeup air for the isolated work space need not be 
covered; 
<p>(III)	All sources of air movement, including the air-handling 
system, shall be shut off or temporarily modified to 
restrict air movement into the work zone; 
<p>(IV)	The barriers used for the construction of the isolated work 
area shall be equipped with transparent viewing ports 
which allow outside observation of all stripping and 
removal of ACM; 
<p>(V)	The isolated work area shall be vented, with negative air 
pressure to a HEPA filtration system, which shall be 
operated continuously from the commencement of 
removal activities through the final clean-up of the work 
area; 
<p>(VI)	The HEPA filter shall be free of tears, fractures, holes or 
other types of damage and shall be securely latched and 
properly situated in the holding frame to prevent air 
leakage from the filtration system; and
<p>(VII)	ACM shall be adequately wet during the removal process. 
</ul><br>(ii)	Procedure 2 - Glovebag<br>
	Remove by the glovebag method or minienclosures designed and 
operated according to 29 CFR Section 1926.58, Appendix G, and 
current Cal/OSHA requirements.
<p>(iii)	Procedure 3 - Adequate Wetting<br>
	Remove ACM using the following techniques:<br>
<ul>(I)	All exposed ACM shall be adequately wet during cutting 
or dismantling procedures.
(II)	ACM shall be adequately wet while it is being removed 
from facility components and prior to its removal from 
the facility.
(III)	Drop cloths and tenting shall be used to contain the work 
area to the extent feasible.
</ul><br>(iv)	Procedure 4 - Dry Removal<br>
	Obtain written approval from the Executive Officer's designee 
prior to using dry removal methods for the control of asbestos 
emissions when adequate wetting procedures in the renovation 
work area would unavoidably damage equipment or present a 
safety hazard.  Dry removal methods may include one or more of 
the following:<br>
<ul>(I)	Use of a HEPA filtration system, operated in accordance 
with clause (d)(1)(D)(i), within an isolated work area;
<p>(II)	Use of a glovebag system, operated in accordance with 
clause (d)(1)(D)(ii); or
<p>(III)	Use of leak-tight wrapping or an approved alternative, to 
contain all ACM removed in units or sections prior to 
dismantlement.
</ul><br>(v)	Procedure 5 - Approved Alternative<br>
	Use an alternative combination of techniques and/or engineering 
controls.  Written approval from the Executive Officer or his 
designee shall be obtained prior to the use of Procedure 5 ACM 
removal activities.</blockquote><br>
(E)	Handling Operations<br>
All ACWM shall be collected and placed in leak-tight containers or 
wrapping.  Such containers or wrappings shall be transparent no later 
than August 12, 1994.  The following techniques shall be used:
<blockquote>(i)	ACM shall be carefully lowered to the ground or a lower floor 
without dropping, throwing, sliding, or otherwise damaging or 
disturbing the ACM;
<p>(ii)	ACM which has been removed or stripped more than 50 feet 
above ground level and was not removed as units or in sections 
shall be transported to the ground via leak-tight chutes or 
containers;

<P>
(Adopted December 21, 1990)(Amended January 4, 1991)
<P>
<B>RULE 1405. CONTROL OF ETHYLENE OXIDE AND CHLOROFLUOROCARBON
EMISSIONS FROM STERILIZATION OR FUMIGATION PROCESSES</B>
<P>
<B>(a) Purpose</B>
<P>
 The purpose of this rule is to protect public health by reducing
ethylene oxide emissions from sterilization or fumigation operations
in the South Coast Air Basin and to fulfill state requirements.
 Pursuant to the requirements of Health and Safety Code Section
39650 (AB 1807 Tanner), the Air Resources Board (ARB) adopted
an Air Toxic Control Measure for Ethylene Oxide Emissions from
Sterilizers and Aerators in May, 1990.  The District is required
to enact equivalent or more stringent requirements than this measure.
 This rule requires recovery or reclamation of chlorofluorocarbons
at certain commercial facilities and eliminates the use of certain
chlorofluorocarbons as diluents in sterilization processes by
1997.
<P>
<B>(b) Applicability </B>
<P>
 This rule is applicable to persons that use ethylene oxide for
sterilization or fumigation, or aerate products sterilized with
ethylene oxide at another facility.
<P>
<B>(c) Definitions</B>
<P>
For the purpose of this rule, the following definitions apply:
<P>
<ol>
<li>AERATION is the process during which residual ethylene oxide
dissipates by forced air flow, or through natural or mechanically
assisted convection, or other means, from previously sterilized
materials after the sterilization cycle is completed.  Aeration
is completed when materials that have previously undergone ethylene
oxide sterilization can be handled, stored, and transported in
the same manner as similar materials that have not been sterilized
with ethylene oxide.

<LI>Introduction:
<P>
 Metal aluminum cannot react with nitric acid or concentrated
sulfuric acid.  It can dissolve in dilute sulfuric acid or hydrochloric
acid.  Active hydrogen, generated during the acid digestion process,
will reduce arsenic to AsH3, which will escape from solution,
resulting in a low or negative arsenic value.  The proposed method
sets up a protocol to dissolve metal alumina without loss of arsenic.

<LI>Procedure:
<PRE>
       3.1. Dissolve

            3.1.1 Dissolve using NaOH (Method 1).
                  Weigh 0.5 g of metal aluminum sample to a 125 ml Erlenmeyer
                  flask, add 15 ml of 3M NaOH solution, allow to react and dissolve
                  about 20 minutes.  Again add 10 ml of 3M NaOH, continue reaction
                  until no gas bubbles are present and the sample is dissolved completely.

            3.1.2 Dissolve using H<SUB>g</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB> (Method 2).
                  Weigh 0.5 g of metal aluminum sample to a 125 ml Erlenmeyer
                  flask, add 10 ml of 10% HgSO4 solution and 5 ml of 30% H2O2. 
                  After 20 minutes, add appropriate amount of HgSO4.  Allow reaction
                  to continue until no gas bubbles are present.  Add metal copper
                  strips (large surface area) into the sample solution.  After 10
                  minutes, withdraw the copper strips and add new copper strips.
                  Repeat until the surface of copper strips in sample solution
                  do not change to a silver color.  Withdraw all copper strips from
                  sample solution.

      3.2. Digestion
           Add 3 ml of concentrated HNO<SUB>3</SUB>, 5 ml of 1:1 H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB> into the sample
           solution obtained from 3.1.1 or 3.1.2.  Heat slowly and evaporate
           the sample solution until SO<SUB>3</SUB> fumes are present for 5 minutes.
           Cool and dilute the sample to 50.0 ml.  Determine Arsenic by
           Atomic Absorption method.

<P>
<B>RULE 1421. CONTROL OF PERCHLOROETHYLENE EMISSIONS FROM DRY
CLEANING SYSTEMS.</B>
<P>
(a) Purpose
<P>
The purpose of the rule is to protect public health by reducing
perchloroethylene emissions from dry cleaning systems.  This rule
will implement the federal National Emission Standard for Hazardous
Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Source Categories: Perchloroethylene
Dry Cleaning Facilities (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR]
63.320, <I>et seq</I>) and the state Airborne Toxic Control Measure
(ATCM) for Emissions of Perchloroethylene from Dry Cleaning Operations
(17 California Code of Regulations [CCR] 93109, <I>et seq</I>).
 This will be accomplished by requiring perchloroethylene dry
cleaning facilities to: phase out transfer, vented, and self-service
machines; require the use of a closed loop machine; install primary,
secondary, and fugitive controls as appropriate; control evaporator
and separator emissions; and institute good operating, reporting,
and recordkeeping practices.

<P>
<B>(b) Applicability</B>
<P>
<ol>
<li>This rule applies to all local governments that request authority

<P>
 For the purpose of this rule, the definitions in Rule 1501 and
the following definitions shall apply:
<P>
<ol>
<li>CERTIFICATION of a trip reduction ordinance means that a
local government has entered into a legally binding agreement
with the District to implement Rule 1501 and the District has
found the trip reduction ordinance to comply with this rule.
<P>
<li>DECERTIFICATION means that a local government no longer has
a legally binding agreement with the District to implement Rule

of a parking cash-out program as established in the California
Health and Safety Code Section 43845 (pursuant to Chapter 554
of the Statutes of 1992).
<P>
(b) Applicability
<BR>
 This rule applies to all employers, except as provided for in
subdivision (i).  This rule will only become effective upon the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) making a finding that
the South Coast Air Basin has failed to attain the National Primary
Ambient Air Quality Standard for Carbon Monoxide by December 31,
2000, or failed to meet an applicable progress milestone specified
in the State Implementation Plan titled &quot;Federal Attainment
Plan for Carbon Monoxide.&quot;  The provisions of this rule will
become effective after the District receives written notification
of such a finding.  This rule does not relieve or restrict the
current or future responsibility of employers to offer a parking
cash-out program as specified in section 43845 of the Health and
Safety Code.

(Adopted January 8, 1993)(Amended January 14, 1994)(Amended February 11, 1994)<BR>
(Amended October 13, 1995)(Amended March 8, 1996)
<P>
<B>RULE 1610. OLD-VEHICLE SCRAPPING</B>
<P>
(a) Purpose
<P>
 The purpose of this rule is to reduce motor vehicle volatile
organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide
(CO), and particulate matter (PM) exhaust emissions by issuing
mobile source emission reduction credits in exchange for the scrapping
of old, high emitting vehicles.  Procurement of old vehicles could
be accomplished by persons voluntarily giving up their vehicle
for scrapping upon receiving an incentive payment.  This rule
provides a mechanism through which stationary source emissions
can be brought into compliance with District regulations through
mobile source emission reductions.  Mobile source emission reduction
credits generated would be applied towards compliance with designated
rules with future compliance dates within District Regulation
XI, Source Specific Standards; Regulation XV, Trip Reduction/Indirect
Source; Regulation XIII, New Source Review; Regulation XX, Regional
Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM); or any other District regulations
that allow the use of credits.  The value of these credits is
based on old vehicles having at least three years useful remaining
life prior to scrapping.
<P>
(b) Definitions
<P>
 For purposes of this rule, the following definitions shall apply:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>MOBILE SOURCE EMISSION REDUCTION CREDIT (MSERC) means credit
for real, quantified emission reductions, approved by the Executive
Officer or designee, as authorized by this rule.
<P>
<LI>NITROGEN OXIDES (NOx) means the sum of nitric oxides and
nitrogen dioxides emitted, collectively expressed as nitrogen
dioxide emissions.
<P>
<LI>OLD-VEHICLE means 1981 and earlier model-year passenger cars
and light-duty trucks.
<P>
<LI>OLD-VEHICLE SCRAPPING PROGRAM means a program in which old
vehicles are scrapped in exchange for MSERCs. 
<P>
<LI>SCAQMD LICENSED SCRAPPER means an entity certified by the
Executive Officer or designee to generate MSERCs by scrapping
vehicles, as authorized by this rule. 
<P>
<LI>SCRAPPING means the process by which a motor vehicle is permanently
removed from service.
<P>
<LI>VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND (VOC) means any volatile compound
of carbon, excluding:  methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
carbonic acid, metallic carbides or carbonates, ammonium carbonate,
and exempt compounds as defined in District Rule 102.
<P>
</OL>
(c) SCAQMD Licensed Scrapper Certification Requirements
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Certification as an SCAQMD licensed scrapper shall be limited
to: VOC, NOx, CO, or PM stationary emission sources subject to
District Regulation XI, Source Specific Standards, rules with
future compliance dates; Regulation XIII, New Source Review; Regulation
XV, Trip Reduction/Indirect Source; or Regulation XX, RECLAIM.

plan approved after the effective date of this amendment if at
least fifty old vehicles have not been scrapped pursuant to the
plan within six months of plan approval.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the minimum shall be 10 for the motion picture industry
and in cases where the Executive Officer or designee determines
that the minimum of 50 should be lowered because hardship has
been demonstrated, e.g., if the amount of MSERCs that a facility
needs is less than the number of MSERCs generated when 50 vehicles
are scrapped.
<P>

on voluntary emission reductions created by the operation of low-
or zero-emission on-road vehicles within the boundaries of the
District that result in emission reductions beyond those required
by local, state and federal regulations.
<P>
<B>(b) Applicability</B>
<P>
 This voluntary rule becomes effective January 1, 1996 and applies
to  passenger cars, light-duty trucks, medium-duty vehicles, and
heavy-duty vehicles which are registered and operated in the District,
and optional emission standards have been specified in ARB's Mobile
Source Credit Guidelines.  References to ARB's Mobile Source Credit
Guidelines or Title 13, California Code of Regulations correspond

(MSERCs) that can be used as an alternative means of compliance
with District regulations.  These credits would be generated based
on voluntary emission reductions created by the operation of low-
or zero-emission off-road equipment within the jurisdiction of
the District that result in emission reductions beyond those required
by local, state, and federal regulations.
<P>
<B>(b) Applicability</B>
<P>
 This voluntary rule becomes effective January 1, 1996 and applies
to any off-road mobile equipment or vehicle for which emission
standards have been adopted by the ARB or U.S. EPA and for which
optional emission standards have been specified in the ARB's Mobile
Source Credit Guidelines.  The equipment and vehicles subject
to this rule are used primarily off the highways to propel, move,
or draw persons or property in construction, commercial, industrial,
mining, agricultural, or forestry applications within the boundaries
of the District and include equipment such as dozers, loaders,
tractors, scrapers, graders, off-highway trucks, forklifts, and
utility service vehicles.  This rule does not apply to utility
and lawn and garden equipment, off-road motorcycles, all-terrain
vehicles, go-karts, golf carts, marine vessels, aircraft and locomotives.

<P>
(Adopted October 7, 1988)
<P>
<B>RULE 1703. PSD ANALYSIS</B>
<P>
<B>(a) The Executive Officer shall, except as Rule 1704 applies,
deny any permits to construct unless:
<P></B>
<ol>
<li>Each permit unit complies with all applicable rules and regulations
of the District; and
<P>
<li>Each permit unit is constructed using BACT for each criteria
air contaminant for which there is a net emission increase; and
<P>
<li>For each significant emission increase of an attainment air
contaminant at a major stationary source:
<P>
(A) The applicant certifies in writing, prior to the issuance
of the permit, that the subject stationary source shall meet all
applicable limitations and standards under the Clean Air Act (42
U.S.C. 7401, et seq.) and all applicable emission limitations
and standards which are part of the State Implementation Plan
approved by the Environmental Protection Agency or is on a compliance
schedule approved by appropriate federal, state, or District officials;
and
<P>
(B) The new source or modification will be constructed using BACT.
<P>
(C) The applicant has substantiated by modeling that the proposed
source or modification, in conjunction with all other applicable
emission increases or reductions (including secondary emissions)
affecting the impact area, will not cause or contribute to a violation
of:
<P>
<blockquote>
(i) Any National or State Ambient Air Quality Standard in any
air quality control region; or
<P>
(ii) Any applicable maximum allowable increase over the baseline
concentration in any area; and
<P>
</blockquote>
(D) The applicant conducts an analysis of the ambient air quality
in the impact area the new or modified stationary source would
affect.  The analysis shall include one year of continuous ambient
air quality monitoring, preceding the receipt of a complete application.
 The Executive Officer may approve a shorter monitoring period,
but not less than four months, provided that the period of monitoring
included the time frame when maximum concentrations are expected.
 The applicant may rely on existing continuous monitoring data
collected by the District if approved by the Executive Officer.
<P>
 With respect to any such contaminant for which no National Ambient
Air Quality Standard exists, the analysis shall contain such air
quality monitoring data as the Executive Officer determines is
necessary to assess ambient air quality for that contaminant in
any area that the emissions of that contaminant would affect;
and
<P>
(E) The applicant provides an analysis of the impairment to visibility,
soil, and vegetation that would occur as a result of the new or
modified stationary source and the air quality impact projected
for the baseline area as a result of general commercial, residential,
industrial, and other growth associated with the source; and
<P>
(F) The Executive Officer provides a copy of the complete application
(within 10 days after being deemed complete by the District) to
the EPA, the Federal Land Manager for any Class I area located
within 100 km of the source, and to the federal official charged
with direct responsibility for management of any lands within
the Class I area.  The Executive Officer shall also send a copy
of the preliminary decision, the Executive Officer's analysis,
and notice of any action taken to the above agencies.  The analysis
shall include a determination on the impact on visibility due
to the project.  The Federal Land Manager of any such lands may
demonstrate to the Executive Officer that the emissions from a
proposed source or modification would have an adverse impact on
the air quality-related values (including visibility) of those
lands, notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting
from emissions from such source or modification would not cause
or contribute to concentrations which would exceed the maximum
allowable increases for a Class I area.  If the Executive Officer
concurs with such demonstration, then he shall deny the permit
to construct.
<P>
</ol>
<B>(b) Procedures</B>
<P>
<ol>
<li>Air Quality Models
<P>
(A) All estimates of ambient concentrations required under this
paragraph shall be based on the applicable air quality models,
data bases, and other requirements specified in the &quot;Guideline
on Air Quality Models,&quot; OAQPS 1.2-080, April 1978, or as
revised, shall be used to determine the comparability of air quality
models.
<P>
(B) Where an air quality impact model specified in the &quot;Guideline
on Air Quality Models&quot; is inappropriate, the model may be
modified or another model substituted.  Prior written approval
of the Executive Officer and the EPA Administrator must be obtained
for any modification or substitution.
<P>
<li>Operations of Monitoring Stations
<P>
 The owner or operator of a major stationary source or major modification
shall meet the EPA monitoring requirements of Appendix B to 40
CFR Part 587, &quot;Ambient  Air Quality Surveillance,&quot; during
the operation of monitoring stations for purposes of satisfying
subparagraph (a)(3)(D) of this rule and paragraph (f) of Rule
1713.
<P>
<li>Stack Heights
<P>
 The degree of emission limitation required for control of any
air pollutant under this rule shall not be affected in any manner
by:
<P>
(A) So much of the stack height of any source as exceeds good
engineering practice; or
<P>
(B) Any other dispersion technique.
<P>
 This subparagraph shall not apply with respect to stack heights
in existence before December 31, 1970, or to dispersion techniques
implemented before then.

<P>
(Adopted October 7, 1988)(Amended January 6, 1989)
<P>
<B>RULE 1706. EMISSION CALCULATIONS</B>
<P>
This rule shall be used as the basis for calculating applicability
to Regulation XVII as delineated in Rule 1703(a).
<P>
<B>(a) Accumulation of Emissions</B>
<P>
<ol>
<li>Emission increases and decreases for each attainment air contaminant
which occur at a stationary source including all emission increases
or decreases directly associated with the subject permit units
or source, shall be calculated pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
rule in determining a net emission increase.
<P>
<li>For each major stationary source:
<P>
(A) The net balance of emissions increases or decreases are those
emissions occurring from October 5, 1979 to the present, or from
the establishment of an applicable attainment air contaminant
to the present, whichever time period is less.  Emissions increases
or decreases shall be calculated pursuant to paragraph (c) of
this rule, and shall be the basis for the determination of a significant
emission increase pursuant to Rule 1703.
<P>
(B) Emission decreases that occur at another stationary source
shall not be used to offset emission increases in determining
if there has been a significant increase in emissions.
<P>
<li>Emission increases or decreases described in subparagraphs
(a)(1) and (a)(2) are those associated with a permit to operate
or a permit to construct, including quantifiable fugitive emissions,
directly associated with the affected permit unit.
<P>
<li>Emission reductions shall be excluded from the accumulation
of emissions pursuant to subparagraph (a)(3) when such reductions
are:
<P>
(A) required to comply with federal or state laws, rules, or regulations;
or
<P>
(B) required by orders of Courts or Boards with jurisdiction to
require such emission reductions; or
<P>
(C) included in District rules and regulations, or in any Control
Measure in a Board approved Air Quality Management Plan.
<P>
<li>The following mobile source emission increases or decreases
directly associated with the subject permit units shall be accumulated:
<P>
(A) all emissions from ships during the loading or unloading of
cargo and while at berth where the cargo is loaded or unloaded,
and
<P>
(B) non-propulsion ship emissions within Coastal Waters under
District jurisdiction.
<P>
<li>Notwithstanding any other provisions of this regulation, emission
increases and reductions resulting from crude oil and gas production
in Southern California Coastal Waters and transport of such crude
oil and gas in Southern California Coastal Waters shall be included
in emission increases or reductions associated with new or modified
stationary sources that are directly related to the crude oil
and gas production or transportation and are under the same ownership
or entitlement to use as the crude oil or gas production facilities.
 Such emission increases or reductions shall be accumulated as
follows:
<P>
(A) When applications are submitted for permits to construct or
modify stationary sources, any emission increases or reductions
which have occurred since the submittal date of previous applications
to construct, and which emission increases or reductions are associated
with activities listed above, shall be accumulated or accounted
for with those of the stationary source for all purposes of this
regulation.
<P>
(B) The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to emission
increases which have occurred prior to October 8, 1976 and shall
not apply where the applicant demonstrates to the Executive Officer
by meteorological or modeling data that emissions from the crude
oil or gas production or transportation will not measurably increase
concentrations of any air contaminant in any part of the District.
<P>
</ol>
<B>(b) Adjustments to Calculated Emissions</B>
<P>
 If, in calculating emission increase, and decreases, it is determined
that violations of district, state or federal laws, rules, regulations,
or orders would occur under the conditions specified in paragraph
(c), the emissions shall be calculated on the basis of the maximum
emission from the source when operating in compliance.  The provisions
of this subparagraph shall not apply to ambient air quality standards.
<P>
<B>(c) Calculation of Emissions for Threshold Determination</B>
<P>
 This paragraph provides the method for calculating the emission
increases and reductions associated with a stationary source,
as described in paragraph (a).
<P>
<ol>
<li>Emission increases or reductions from permit units at a stationary
source shall be calculated as follows:
<P>
(A) The emissions for new permit units and the new emissions for
modified or relocated permit units shall be calculated from permit
conditions for permits to construct and operate issued pursuant
to an EPA approved version of this regulation which directly limit
the emissions or, when no such conditions are imposed, from:
<P>
<blockquote>
(i) the maximum rated capacity; and
<P>
(ii) twenty-four hours of operation per day; and
<P>
(iii) the actual materials processed; and
<P>
</blockquote>
(B) The emissions before modification, relocation, or removal
from service shall be calculated from:
<P>
<blockquote>
(i) the sum of actual emissions, as determined from company records,
which have occurred during the two-year period immediately preceding
date of permit application, except annual emission declarations
pursuant to Rule 301 may be used if less than the actual emissions
as determined above; and
<P>
(ii) the total emissions in those two years shall be calculated
on an annual basis.
</blockquote>
<P>
<li>Emission reductions appropriate to the air pollution reduction
equipment or process shall be used in the calculations of subparagraph
(c)(1) if required for permits to construct and operate issued
pursuant to an EPA approved version of this regulation.
<P>
<li>Emission increases and reductions from mobile and other sources
shall be determined from records or other information approved
by the Executive Officer, sufficient to show actual emissions
calculated as a daily emission, using the calculation methods
of subparagraph (c)(1).
<P>
<li>Notwithstanding the other provisions of paragraph (c) of this
rule, eligible emission reductions for long lead-time projects
shall include any real excess reductions which result through
enforceable changes in operating conditions between the time a
Permit to construct is issued and the time a Permit to Operate
is issued.  For the purpose of calculating such reductions, the
period immediately preceding the actual date of reduction and
the eligibility criteria in effect at that time shall be used.

(Adopted October 7, 1988)
<P>
<B>RULE 1713. SOURCE OBLIGATION</B>
<P>
(a) The Executive Officer shall deny any permit to construct or
operate if the owner or operator constructs or operates a source
or modification not in accordance with the application submitted
pursuant to this paragraph or with the terms of any permit to
construct.
<P>
(b) The Executive Officer shall deny a permit to operate if the
owner or operator of a source or modification subject to this
regulation commences construction without applying for and receiving
a permit to construct.
<P>
(c) A permit to construct shall become invalid if construction
is not commenced within 24 months after receipt of such approval,
if construction is discontinued for a period of 24 months or more,
or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time.
 The Executive Officer may extend the 24-month period upon a satisfactory
showing that an extension is justified.  This provision does not
apply to the time period between construction of the approved
phases of a phased construction project; each phase must commence
construction within 24 months of the projected and approve commencement
date.
<P>
(d) A permit to construct shall not relieve any owner or operator
of the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions
of the State Implementation Plan and any other requirements under
local, state, or federal law. 
<P>
(e) At such time that a particular source or modification becomes
a major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue
of a relaxation in any enforceable limitation which was established
after August 7, 1980 on the capacity of the source or modification
otherwise to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours
of operation, then the requirements of Rule 1703 shall apply to
the source or modification as though construction had not yet
commenced on the source or modification.
<P>
(f) Post-Construction Monitoring
<P>
 The owner or operator of a major stationary source or major modification
shall, after construction of the stationary source or modification,
conduct such ambient monitoring as the Executive Officer determines
is necessary to determine the effect emissions from the stationary
source or modification may have, or are having, on air quality
in any area.
<P>
(g) No Permit to Construct Issued
<P>
 For new or modified permit units or sources which are constructed
without the required permit to construct, the application for
permit to operate shall, for the purposes of this regulation,
be considered an application for permit to construct.  The Executive
Officer shall deny the permit to operate unless the new source
or modification complies with all rules in this regulation whether
the rules pertain to a permit to construct or permit to operate.

<P>
(Adopted October 15, 1993)(Amended December 7, 1995)
<P>
<B>RULE 2001. APPLICABILITY</B>
<P>
(a) Purpose
<P>
This rule specifies criteria for inclusion in RECLAIM for new
and existing facilities.  It also specifies requirements for sources
electing to enter RECLAIM and identifies provisions in District
rules and regulations that do not apply to RECLAIM sources.
<P>
(b) Criteria for Inclusion in RECLAIM
<P>
The Executive Officer will maintain a listing of facilities which
are subject to RECLAIM.  The Executive Officer will include facilities,
unless otherwise exempted pursuant to  paragraph (i), if emissions
fee data for 1990 or any subsequent year filed pursuant to Rule
301 - Permit Fees, shows four or more tons per year of NOx or
SOx emissions where:
<OL><P>
<LI>NOx emissions do not include emissions from:
<P>
(A) any NOx source which was exempt from permit pursuant to Rule
- 219 Equipment Not Requiring A Written Permit Pursuant to Regulation
II;
<P>
(B) any NOx process unit which was rental equipment with a valid
District Permit to Operate issued to a party other than the facility;
or
<P>
(C) on-site, off-road mobile sources.
<P>
<LI>SOx emissions do not include emissions from:
<P>
(A) any SOx source which was exempt from permit pursuant to Rule
- 219 Equipment Not Requiring A Written Permit Pursuant to Regulation
II; or
<P>
(B) any SOx source that burned natural gas exclusively; or
<P>
(C) any SOx process unit which was rental equipment with a valid
District Permit to Operate issued to a party other than the facility;
or
<P>
(D) on-site, off-road mobile sources.
<P>
The Executive Officer will not include a facility in RECLAIM if
a permit holder requests exclusion no later than January 1, 1996
and demonstrates prior to October 15, 1993 through the addition
of control equipment, the possession of a valid Permit to Construct
for such control equipment, or a Permit to Operate condition 
that the emissions fee data received pursuant to Rule 301, which
shows emissions equal to or greater than four tons per year of
a RECLAIM pollutant, is not representative of future emissions.
</OL><P>
(c) Amendments to RECLAIM Facility Listing
<OL><P>
<LI>The Executive Officer will amend the RECLAIM facility listing
to add, delete, change designation of any facility or make any
other necessary corrections upon any of the following actions:
<P>
(A) Approval by the Executive Officer pursuant to Rule 2007 -
Trading Requirements, of the permanent transfer or relinquishment
of all RTCs applicable to a facility.
<P>
(B) Approval by the Executive Officer of a change of Facility
Permit holder or change of facility name.
<P>
(C) Approval by the Executive Officer of a Facility Permit for
a new facility if such new facility would, under RECLAIM, have
a starting Allocation equal to or greater than four tons per year
of a RECLAIM pollutant NOx or SOx, unless the facility would be
exempt pursuant to paragraph (i).
<P>
(D) Approval by the Executive Officer of a Facility Permit for
an existing non-RECLAIM facility, which reports NOx or SOx emissions
pursuant to Rule 301 - Permit Fees, for any year which are equal
to or greater than four tons, as specified in subdivision (b),
unless the facility would be exempt pursuant to paragraph (i).
<P>
(E) Approval by the Executive Officer of the election of a facility
to enter the RECLAIM program pursuant to subdivision (f).
<P>
(F) Upon delegation of authority from EPA to the District for
Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) sources and inclusion of RECLAIM
in 40 CFR Part 55 pursuant to the consistency update process,
such OCS sources shall be RECLAIM facilities.  The OCS sources'
starting Allocation for the year of entry and Allocations for
the years 2000 and 2003 and interim years, shall be determined
pursuant to Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)
and Oxides of Sulfur (SOx), except that fuel usage and emissions
data reported to the Minerals Management Service of the Department
of the Interior be utilized where emissions data reported pursuant
to Rule 301 is not available, provided that the permit holder
substantiates the accuracy of such fuel usage and emissions data.
 The starting Allocation shall be adjusted to reflect the rate
of reduction which would have been applicable to the facility
if it had been in the RECLAIM program as of October 15, 1993.
<P>
<LI>The actions specified in this subdivision shall be effective
only upon amendment of the Facility Listing.
</OL><P>
(d) Cycles
<OL><P>
<LI>The Executive Officer will assign RECLAIM facilities to one
of two compliance cycles by computer-generated random assignment
which, to the extent possible, ensures an even distribution of
RTCs.  The Facility Listing will distinguish between Cycle 1 facilities,
which will have a compliance year of January 1 to December 31
of each year, and Cycle 2 facilities, with a compliance year of
July 1 to June 30 of each year.
<P>
<LI>The issue and expiration dates of the RTCs allocated to a
facility shall coincide with the beginning and ending dates of
the facility's compliance year.
<P>
<LI>Within 30 days of October 15, 1993, facilities assigned to
Cycle 2 may petition the Executive Office or the Hearing Board
to change their cycle designation.  Facilities assigned to Cycle
1 may not petition the Executive Officer or Hearing Board to change
their cycle designation.  Facilities entering the RECLAIM program
after October 15, 1993 will be assigned to the cycle with the
greatest amount of time remaining in the compliance year.
</OL><P>
(e) High Employment/Low Emissions (HILO) Facility Designation
<P>
A new facility may, after January 1, 1997 apply to the District
for classification as a HILO Facility.  The Executive Officer
will approve the HILO designation upon the determination that
the emission rate for NOx, SOx, ROC, and PM10 is less than or
equal to one-half (1/2) of any target specified in the AQMP for
emissions per full-time manufacturing employee by industry class
in the year 2010.
<P>
(f) Entry Election
<OL><P>
<LI>A non-RECLAIM facility may elect to permanently enter the
RECLAIM program, provided that:
<P>
(A) the owner or operator files an Application for Entry;
<P>
(B) the facility is not listed as exempt under paragraph (i)(1);
<P>
(C) the facility is not operating under an Order for Abatement
or in violation of any District rule; and
<P>
(D) the facility is not subject to a compliance date in an existing
rule within six months of the date of Application for Entry.
<P>
<LI>Upon approval of an Application for Entry, the Executive Officer
will issue a Facility Permit.  The facility's starting Allocation
for the year of entry and Allocations for the years 2000 and 2003
and interim years, shall be determined pursuant to Rule 2002 -
Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) and Oxides of Sulfur
(SOx).  If necessary, the Allocation shall be adjusted to equal
the Allocations which would have been applicable to the facility
if it had been subject to the RECLAIM program as of October 15,
1993.
<P>
<LI>Entry into the RECLAIM program will be effective upon issuance
of a Facility Permit pursuant to Rule 2006 - Permits, and publication
of the addition of the facility to the Facility Listing.
</OL><P>
(g) Exit from RECLAIM
<P>
No facility, on the initial Facility Listing or subsequently admitted
to RECLAIM, may opt out of the program.
<P>
(h) Non-RECLAIM Facility Generation of RTCs
<P>
 Non-RECLAIM facilities may not obtain RTCs due to a shutdown
or curtailment of operations which occurs after October 15, 1993.
 ERCs generated by non-RECLAIM facilities may not be converted
to RTCs if the ERCs are based on a shutdown or curtailment of
operations after October 15, 1993.
<P>

<OL><P>
<LI>The Executive Officer will compile a draft inventory of sources
at each Cycle 1 RECLAIM facility and provide the draft inventory
to the prospective Facility Permit holder of each such facility.
 No later than six months after providing the draft inventories
to the Cycle 1 facilities, the Executive Officer will compile
a draft inventory of sources at each Cycle 2 RECLAIM facility
and provide the draft inventory to the prospective Facility Permit
holder of each such facility.
<P>
<LI>Within 30 days of receipt of the draft inventory, the prospective
Facility Permit holder shall submit inventory corrections to the
Executive Officer.  At a minimum, the prospective Facility Permit
holder shall identify each source of RECLAIM pollutants located
at the facility, and shall submit equipment descriptions and operating
parameters for such sources if required by the Executive Officer.
 Equipment previously exempt pursuant to Rule 219 - Equipment
Not Requiring a Written Permit Pursuant to Regulation II, shall
be listed by category.  Inventory corrections shall be submitted
in a form and manner specified by the Executive Officer.
<P>
<LI>After receiving the corrected list of emission sources from
the facility, the Executive Officer will, based on the corrected
list and any other relevant information, issue a Facility Permit
for each RECLAIM facility.  The Facility Permit will be issued
by January 1, 1994 for Cycle 1 facilities and by July 1, 1994
for Cycle 2 facilities.
<P>
<LI>Each Facility Permit shall include the following terms and
conditions:
<P>
(A) a description of each source or process unit and emission
control device located at the facility, including sources of non-RECLAIM
pollutants.  Equipment previously exempt pursuant to Rule 219
- Equipment Not Requiring a Written Permit Pursuant to Regulation
II, shall be listed by category and updated annually with the
submittal of the APEP Report.
<P>
(B) a starting Allocation for the initial compliance year, which
shall be calculated pursuant to Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides
of Nitrogen (NOx) and Oxides of Sulfur (SOx);
<P>
(C) an Allocation for each compliance year through the year 2010,
determined pursuant to Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen
(NOx) and Oxides of Sulfur (SOx);
<P>
(D) emission rates, or concentration limit, if applicable, and
emission monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting conditions for
each emission source in accordance with Rules 2011 - Requirements
for Monitoring, Reporting and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur
(SOx) Emissions, 2012 - Requirements for Monitoring, Reporting
and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) Emissions;
<P>

for Oxides of Sulfur (SOx) Emissions, and/or 2012 - Requirements
for Monitoring, Reporting and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Nitrogen
(NOx) Emissions;
<P>
(G) all permit conditions applicable to sources at the facility
which were in effect immediately prior to issuance of the Facility
Permit and which relate to toxics and other non-RECLAIM pollutants;
<P>
(H) conditions necessary to ensure continued compliance with BACT
requirements imposed prior to issuance of the Facility Permit;
<P>
(I) all permit conditions applicable to sources at the facility
immediately prior to issuance of the Facility Permit, provided
that, unless the conditions are otherwise required by this regulation,
such conditions will be in effect until December 31, 1994 for
Cycle 1 facilities and June 30, 1995 for Cycle 2 facilities, or
until such date the Executive Officer determined in writing that
the facility has complied with all monitoring and reporting requirements
of Rule 2011 or 2012, as applicable, whichever is later;
<P>
(J) permit conditions to ensure enforceability of, and compliance
with, all applicable District rules and state and federal statutes

to RECLAIM pursuant to Rule 2001 (c)(1)(D), the Executive Officer
will issue a Facility Permit which will contain those provisions
specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this rule.
<P>
<LI>For facilities which enter RECLAIM pursuant to Rule 2001 (f),
the Facility Permit will contain those provisions specified in
paragraph (b)(4) of this rule.
<P>
<LI>The Facility Permit shall serve as the Permit to Operate within
the meaning of Rule 203 - Permit to Operate, for all equipment
and sources at the facility.  All valid preexisting Permits to
Operate and Permits to Construct will be incorporated into the
Facility Permit.  An amendment to a Facility Permit may constitute
both a Permit to Construct a modified source within the meaning
of Rule 201 - Permit to Construct, and a Permit to Operate the
modified source.
<P>
<LI>Operation of any source that is not listed in the Facility
Permit in the manner described in subparagraph (b)(4)(A) shall
constitute a violation of this rule.
<P>
<LI>The terms and conditions of the Facility Permit may be appealed
to the Hearing Board.  Such an appeal shall be filed within 10
days of the issuance of the permit or amendment thereto.  The
pendency of an appeal shall not stay the effect of the permit.
</OL><P>
(c) Amendments to Facility Permits and the RTC Listing

amendment unless the applicant demonstrates that operation of
the facility, pursuant to the proposed revised permit will comply
with all applicable District rules, and state and federal statutes
and regulations which the District has jurisdiction to enforce.
<P>
<LI>The Executive Officer may, upon annual renewal, add or amend
written conditions on the Facility Permit to assure compliance
with, and enforceability of, any applicable District rule, or
state or federal statute or regulation which the District has
jurisdiction to enforce.

<P>
<B>RULE 2007. TRADING REQUIREMENTS</B>
<P>
(a) Purpose
<P>
The purpose of this rule is to define the RECLAIM trading unit
and to establish trading requirements for RECLAIM.
<P>
(b) Nature of RECLAIM Trading Credits (RTCs)
<OL><P>
<LI>An RTC is a limited authorization to emit RECLAIM pollutants
in accordance with the restrictions and requirements of District
rules and state and federal law.
<P>
<LI>An RTC may be bought, sold, traded or otherwise transferred
or acquired in accordance with the provisions of this rule.
<P>
<LI>An RTC shall not constitute a security or other form of property,
but may be used as collateral or security for indebtedness.
<P>
<LI>The District reserves the right to amend the RECLAIM rules
in response to program reevaluations pursuant to Rule 2015 - Backstop
Provisions, or at other times.  Nothing in District rules shall
be construed to limit the District's authority to condition, limit,
suspend or terminate any RTCs or the authorization to emit which
is represented by a Facility Permit.
</OL><P>
(c)  Term of RTCs
<OL><P>
<LI>An RTC shall be denominated in terms of one pound of a RECLAIM
pollutant and shall have a term of one year.  Cycle 1 facilities,
representing approximately half of the total RTCs allocated in
each trading zone, will receive RTCs that have an issue date of
January 1 and an expiration date of December 31.  The remaining
Cycle 2 facilities will receive RTCs that have an issue date of
July 1 and an expiration date of June 30.
<P>
<LI>A Facility Permit holder may acquire and use RTCs issued in
either cycle regardless of the facility's initial RTC allocation
cycle.  However, the expiration date of an RTC is not affected
by trading for use in the other cycle.
<P>
<LI>A Facility Permit holder may acquire and use expired RTCs
to reconcile emissions during a quarter in which the annual Allocation
was exceeded, if the following conditions are met:
<P>
(A) such transaction and use occurs during the reconciliation
period immediately following the quarter during which the subject
emissions occurred; and
<P>
(B) the RTCs are used to reconcile emissions that occurred during
the RTC term.
</OL><P>
(d) RTC Listing
<P>
The Executive Officer will maintain an RTC Listing specifying
all RTCs held by each facility or person.  The listing is the
official and controlling record of RTC holdings.  The Executive
Officer will amend the RTC Listing upon any of the following actions:
<OL><P>
<LI>RTC transfer;
<P>
<LI>change in name of an RTC holder; 
<P>
<LI>expiration of unused RTCs;
<P>
<LI>a reduction of a facility's annual emission Allocation pursuant
to Rule 2010 (b)(1)(A); or
<P>
<LI>at the end of each quarter's reconciliation period.
</OL><P>
(e) Acquisition of RTCs
<P>
RTCs may be acquired only as follows:
<OL><P>
<LI>Initially, the Facility Permit holder is granted, pursuant
to Rule 2002, RTCs for each year equal to the facility's annual
Allocation for that year.
<P>
<LI>Any person may acquire RTCs through purchase, trade or other
means of transfer from any person who holds RTCs.  The following
requirements shall govern the transfer of RTCs:
<P>
(A) The transfer of RTCs shall be effective only upon amendment
by the Executive Officer of the RTC Listing.

<P>
(ii) RTC issue date;
<P>
(iii) the amount and type of emissions;

which the RTCs originated;
<P>
(vi) the price per pound of emissions, if sold; 
<P>
(vii) if the RTCs for transfer are for the current compliance
year, the seller shall indicate one or more of the following four
causes for the generation of RTCs:
<P>
(I) process change;
<P>
(II) addition of control equipment;
<P>
(III) production decrease; or
<P>
(IV) equipment or facility shutdown.
<P>
 If the seller is not a RECLAIM facility, and cause for generation
has been previously reported, no cause need be indicated.
<P>
(viii) if the RTCs for transfer are valid for a subsequent compliance
year, the seller shall comply with clause (vii) or may alternatively
indicate that the manner of generating the RTCs has not yet been
determined; 
<P>
(ix) the buyer shall indicate one or more of the following three
uses of the RTCs:
<P>
(I) issuance of RTC Certificate;
<P>
(II) increase of Allocation to satisfy annual compliance or increased
production; or
<P>
(III) use under Rule 2005 - New Source Review for RECLAIM.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
(C) Joint registration may be submitted by an agent, broker, or
other intermediary representing the buyer and seller.  Such parties,
upon approval by the Executive Officer, may report summarized
price information, such as daily or weekly volumes with closing
prices.
<P>
(D) The Executive Officer shall not amend the RTC Listing to identify
a new holder of RTCs, or to add RTCs to an existing RTC holder,
until an equivalent amount of RTCs are debited from the seller.
<P>
(E) When RTCs are transferred from an Allocation, the debit shall
result in an automatic amendment of the Allocation.
<P>
(F) When the buyer is a RECLAIM facility, the Executive Officer
shall amend the buyer's Allocation or issue an RTC certificate
in the name of the buyer, as requested pursuant to subparagraph
(e)(2)(G).

are eligible for transfer upon issuance; and
<P>
<LI>RTCs to replace existing ERCs held by non-RECLAIM facilities
pursuant to Rule 2002 (c)(5) are eligible for transfer upon issuance.
</OL><P>
(g) RTC Certificates
<OL><P>
<LI>RTC Certificates may only be issued by the Executive Officer
for RTCs which are not part of an Allocation.
<P>
<LI>RTC Certificates shall designate the name of the holder, the
Regulation XIII zone and RECLAIM trading zone from which the RTC
originated, the issue date, the expiration date, and an annual
emissions value.
<P>
<LI>RTC Certificates may be acquired by transfer as set forth
in subdivision (e).  In addition, a Facility Permit holder may
elect to reduce the Allocation and, upon such amendment to the
Facility Permit by the Executive Officer, shall be issued an RTC
Certificate.  The value of the certificate shall be equivalent
to the reduction in the Allocation in the year for which the certificate
is issued.
<P>
<LI>RTC certificates may be surrendered for application to create
or increase an Allocation.
</OL><P>
(h)  Retirement of RTCs
<P>
RTCs may be surrendered to the District for retirement from the
market.  All RTC retirements will be documented annually through
the annual program audit, and used to provide further progress
for clean air.  RTCs retired to their issue date shall be exempt
from the RTC Allocation Fee specified in Rule 301 - Permit Fees.
<P>
(i)  RTC Trading Prohibition
<P>
No person shall, in connection with any agreement or proposed
agreement for the transfer of any RTC, knowingly make or cause
to be made to any other person any false report or statement regarding
RTCs.

<P>
<B>RULE 2010. ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND SANCTIONS</B>
<P>
(a) Purpose<BR>
This rule specifies provisions to ensure that RECLAIM facilities
which exceed their Allocation provide compensating emission reductions.
 This rule also provides for administrative penalties for RECLAIM
rule violations.
<P>
(b) Emissions in Excess of Allocation
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Upon determining that a Facility Permit holder has violated
Rule 2004 (d), the Executive Officer will:
<P>
(A) reduce the facility's annual emissions Allocation for the
subsequent compliance year by the total amount the Allocation
was exceeded;
<P>
(B) revise the Facility Permit to impose any conditions the Executive
Officer determines to be appropriate to prevent future violations
of Rule 2004 (d).
<P>
<LI>If the Executive Officer petitions for a permit revocation
pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 42307 due to a violation
of Rule 2004 (d), and the Hearing Board finds that Rule 2004 (d)
was violated, it may revoke the Facility Permit pursuant to Health
and Safety Code Section 42309 and invalidate all RTCs held for
the facility's use.  Any subsequent application for a Facility
Permit filed for that facility shall be subject to all requirements
of Rule 2005 - New Source Review for RECLAIM.
<P>
</OL>
(c) Administrative Penalties
<P>
<OL>
<LI>For any violation of RECLAIM, the Executive Officer may seek
an administrative penalty up to $500 per violation, per day, pursuant
to Health and Safety Code Section 42402.5.  If administrative
penalties are sought, the Executive Officer will:
<P>
(A) provide written notice of the administrative penalty to the
Facility Permit holder, including a written explanation of the
basis for the penalty;
<P>
(B) provide an opportunity for a hearing by the Executive Officer
or designee(s) within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice.
 The hearing shall include the right to call and examine witnesses
under oath, the right to introduce exhibits, and the right to
a record of the hearing.
<P>
(C) The hearing shall not be conducted according to technical
rules of evidence.  The rules of privilege shall be effective
to the same extent that they are recognized in civil actions,
and irrelevant evidence shall be excluded.
<P>
(D) Within thirty (30) days after the hearing, the Executive Officer
or designee(s) will mail to the Facility Permit holder a notice
of final decision including a statement of reasons therefore.
<P>
(E) In determining the amount of administrative penalty to be
assessed, the Executive Officer or designee(s) will take into
account all relevant circumstances, including but not limited
to, the factors specified in Health and Safety Code Section 42403.
<P>
<LI>The Facility Permit holder shall pay any administrative penalty
within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice pursuant to subparagraph
(c)(1)(A), or if a hearing has been held, within thirty (30) days
of the date of receipt of notice pursuant to subparagraph (c)(1)(D).
 If the penalty is not paid when due, the Executive Officer may
petition the Hearing Board to revoke the Facility Permit.  If
the Hearing Board finds that the penalties have not been paid,
it shall revoke the Facility Permit.
<P>
</OL>
(d) Other Remedies and Sanctions

 The remedies and sanctions provided in this rule are in addition
to any sanctions, penalties, actions or other remedies available
under law.

This document provides the technical specifications for normally
operated RECLAIM sources subject to District Rule 2011 &quot;Requirements
for Monitoring, Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur
(SOx) Emissions&quot;.  District Rule 2011 divides sources into
three categories - major sources, SOx process units and Rule 219
- &quot;Equipment Not Requiring a Written Permit Pursuant to Regulation
II&quot; sources.  The one difference in requirements between
these source categories is the monitoring approach.  A major source
shall be monitored by a continuous emissions monitoring system
(CEMS) or alternative monitoring system, while a SOx process unit
has the option to be monitored manually based on fuel usage and
emission factor.
<P>
Oxides of sulfur (SOx) emissions shall be composed of sulfur dioxide
(SO2) emissions.  No later than June 30, 1994 the Executive Officer
will determine the feasibility for estimating sulfur trioxide
(SO3) emissions as a function of SO2 emissions for a petroleum
refinery fluid catalytic cracking unit.  If the Executive Officer
determines that the surrogate approach is feasible then a unit-specific
protocol will be developed by the Executive Officer by August
31, 1994.  The Facility Permit holder of a petroleum refinery
fluid catalytic cracking unit shall apply the protocol prospectively
to determine SOx emissions on both SO2 and SO3 emissions.  If
the Executive Officer determines that the surrogate approach is
not feasible then SOx emissions shall continue to be based only
on SO2 emissions.
<P>
These SOx source categories also differ in the way in which they
transmit data to the District's Central Station and the reporting
frequency.  Major sources shall electronically transmit the data
via an RTU on a daily basis. In addition, aggregated SOx emissions
from all major sources must be submitted in a Monthly Emissions
Report.  SOx process units have the option to report SOx emissions
as part of the Quarterly Certification of Emissions required by
Rule 2004 - Requirements. 
<P>
The criteria for determining the major source applicability is
presented in Table 1-A.  A SOx process unit is one or more piece(s)
of equipment which is not a major source, provided that each equipment
in a process unit is subject to an identical emission factor specified
in subdivision (d) of Rule 2011.
<P>
The Facility Permit will limit mass emissions in accordance with
the following relationship:
<P>
<TT>&eth;</TT> ECEMS  +  <TT>&eth;</TT> EEF  +  <TT>&eth;</TT>
E219  <TT>&#181;</TT>  RTCs
<P>
 where:
<P>
<TT>&eth;</TT> ECEMS = sum of facility emissions monitored by
CEMS or alternative monitoring system
<P>
<TT>     </TT>
<P>
<TT> &eth;</TT> EEF  = sum of facility emissions from process
units subject to emission factors (EF)pu
<P>
<TT> &eth;</TT> E219  = sum of facility emissions from equipment
exempt under Rule 219, subject to emission factor (EF)219.
<P>
 RTC  = RECLAIM Trading Credit held by the Facility Permit holder
<P>
The fuel usage for any process unit or equipment exempt under
Rule 219 shall not exceed the value determined in accordance with
the following relationship:
<P>
<TT> &eth;</TT> (FxEF)pu + <TT>&eth;</TT> (FxEF)219 &lt; RTC -
<TT>&eth;</TT> ECEMS
<P>
 where:
<P>
 F  = Fuel usage for the process unit or equipment exempt under
Rule 219
<P>
The Facility Permit holder shall document the duration of operating
time of any rental equipment at the Facility.  Emissions generated
by any rental equipment which exceeds 72 hours of operation in
a quarter shall be determined and reported by the Facility Permit
holder according to the applicable methodology specified for each
major source or process unit.
<P>
This document has been divided into chapters addressing the various
compliance aspects of Rule 2011.  A summary of each chapter follows:
<P>
<B> CHAPTER 2:   MAJOR SOURCES - CONTINUOUS EMISSION MONITORING
SYSTEM (CEMS)</B>
<P>
Chapter 2 describes the methodologies for measuring and reporting
SOx emissions from major sources.  If a major source category
is applicable, then the Facility Permit holder shall be required
to comply with the performance standards associated with a CEMS
or an equivalent monitoring device.
<P>
For major sources, measurement and reporting requirements apply
to variables used to calculate the SOx emissions as well as the
variables used to track the operation of basic, control, and monitoring
equipment.
<P>
Unless specifically exempted by Rule 2011, the Facility Permit
holder shall measure and record all applicable variables as specified
in Table 2-A.
<P>
Several important aspects of Chapter 2 include:
<P>
<TT>&#176;</TT> equations describing the method used to calculate
SOx emissions,
<P>
<TT>&#176;</TT> operational requirements,
<P>
<TT>&#176;</TT> obtaining valid data points,
<P>
<TT>&#176;</TT> alternative data acquisition methods,
<P>
<TT>&#176;</TT> accuracy requirements,
<P>
<TT>&#176;</TT> quality assurance procedures,
<P>
<TT>&#176;</TT> missing data procedures,
<P>
<TT>&#176;</TT> final and interim reporting procedures, and
<P>
<TT>&#176;</TT> timesharing
<P>
<B> CHAPTER 3:   PROCESS UNITS - PERIODIC REPORTING AND RULE 219
EQUIPMENT</B>
<P>
Chapter 3 describes the measuring and reporting requirements for
the SOx process unit category and equipment exempt from permit
under Rule 219.  SOx process units which comprise of one or more
pieces of equipment in accordance with Rule 2011 shall base emission
calculations primarily on fuel consumption or operating time in
conjunction with the emission factor.  The requirements and procedures
for an emission factor and election conditions for an alternative
emission factor shall apply to process units.  These SOx process
units may include equipment that are lumped together only if the
units have the same emission factor.
<P>
Important aspects of Chapters 3 include equations describing the
method used to calculate SOx emissions and reporting procedures
for process units as well as determining SOx emissions from equipment
exempt under Rule 219.
<P>
<B> CHAPTER 4:   PROCESS UNITS - SOURCE TESTING</B>
<P>
This Chapter  presents a brief description of the required test
methods for determining alternative emission factors for process
units .
<P>
<B> CHAPTER 5:   REMOTE TERMINAL UNITS - ELECTRONIC REPORTING</B>
<P>
Once the variables for determining emissions and equipment operations
have been measured, the measured data would be stored at the facility.
 In addition, selected measured and calculated data would be transmitted
to the District's Central Station Computer.  This storing and
transmitting of data for major sources shall be performed by the
remote terminal unit (RTU).
<P>
Chapter 5 specifies tasks and characteristics required of the
RTU as well as a guide for providing the required software/hardware
for the RTU.  In addition, this chapter serves as a:
<P>
<TT>&#176;</TT> functional guideline for operating requirements
of the RTU, and
<P>
<TT>&#176;</TT> information source concerning RTU hardware/software
procurement, configuration, installation, maintenance, and compatibility
with the CEMS and the District's Central Station.

<P>
The criteria for determining the applicable SOx RECLAIM category
for a specific piece of equipment is presented in Table 1-A for
a major source.  If a major source category is applicable to this
equipment, then the Facility Permit holder shall be required to
comply with the performance standards associated with a CEMS (Continuous
Emission Monitoring System) or an approved Alternative Monitoring
System (AMS).
<P>
The Facility Permit holder of a source that is required to install
CEMS may request the Executive Officer to approve an alternative
monitoring device (or system components) to quantify emissions
of SOx.  The applicant shall demonstrate to the Executive Officer
that the proposed alternative monitoring device is at a minimum
equivalent in relative accuracy, precision, reliability, and timeliness
to a CEMS for that source, according to the criteria specified
in 40 CFR Part 75 Subpart E.  In lieu of the criteria specified
in 40 CFR Part 75 Subpart E, substitute criteria is acceptable
if the applicnt demonstrates to the Executive Officer that the
proposed alternative monitoring device is at minimum equivalent
in relative accuracy, precision, reliability, and timeliness to
a CEMS for that source.  Upon approval by the Executive Officer,
the substitute criteria shall be submitted to the federal Environmental
Protection Agency as an amendment to the State Implementation
Plan (SIP).
<P>
Chapter 2 describes the methodologies for measuring, monitoring,
and reporting emissions from major sources.  All major sources
shall be monitored by a continuous emissions monitoring system
(CEMS) or an alternative monitoring system (AMS).  The required
equipment-specific variables, both measured and reported, to be
monitored are found in Tables 2-A and 2-B, respectively.
<P>
Another important requirement of major SOx sources is the way
in which they transmit data to the District's Central Station
and the reporting frequency.  Major sources shall electronically
transmit the data via an RTU on a daily basis.  In addition, the
aggregated NOx emissions from all major sources must be submitted
in a Monthly Emissions Report.
<P>
During the interim period, January 1, 1994 through December 31,
1994 for Cycle 1 facilities and July 1, 1994 through June 30,
1995 for Cycle 2 facilities mass emissions for major sources shall
be determined using emission factors referenced in Table 2 of
Rule 2002.
<P>
Other important aspects covered in this chapter include missing
data procedures and CEMS timesharing requirements.
<P>
<B>A. MEASUREMENT REQUIREMENTS</B>
<P>
 1. Between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 1994 (Cycle 1 facilities)
and between July 1, 1994 and June 30, 1995 (Cycle 2 facilities),
major sources shall be allowed to use an interim reporting procedure
to measure and record SOx emissions on a monthly basis and may
be extracted from SOx  emission data gathered by existing District
certified continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS).  Chapter
2, Subdivison C, Paragraph 1 specifies the requirements for this
interim period.  On and after January 1, 1995 (Cycle 1 facilities)
and July 1, 1995 (Cycle 2 facilities), the Facility Permit holder
of each major source shall report a daily average of NOx emission
by 5:00 p.m. of the following day and comply with all other applicable
requirements (except Chapter 2, Subdivision C, Subparagraph 1)
specified in this chapter.
<P>
 2. The Facility Permit holder shall by March 31, 1994 for Cycle
1 facilities and September 30, 1994 for Cycle 2 facilities, submit
a CEMS plan to the Executive Officer for approval.  The plan shall
contain at a minimum the following items:
<P>
a. A list of all major sources which will have CEMS installed.
<P>
b. Details of all proposed Continuous Emission Monitors as well
as the proposed flow monitors for each affected source.
<P>
c. Details of the Quality Control/Quality Assurance Plan for the
CEMS.
<P>
d. Proposed range of each CEMS and the expected concentrations
of pollutants for each source.
<P>
e. Date by which purchase order for each system will be issued.
<P>
f. Construction schedule for each system, and date of completion
of the installation.
<P>
g. Date by which CEMS certification test protocol will be submitted
to the District for approval for each system.
<P>
h. Date by which certification tests will be completed for each
system.
<P>
i. Date by which certification test results will be submitted
for review by the District, for each system.
<P>
j. Any other pertinent information regarding the installation
and certification for each system.
<P>
  If a CEMS Plan is disapproved in whole or in part, the District
staff will notify the Facility Permit holder in writing and the
Facility Permit holder shall have 30 days from the date it receives
the notice from the District to resubmit its plan.
<P>
3. The Facility Permit holder of each major SOx equipment shall
install, calibrate, maintain, and operate an approved CEMS to
measure and record  the following: 
<P>
a. Sulfur oxide concentrations in the gases discharged to the
atmosphere from affected equipment.
<P>
b. Oxygen concentrations, at each location where sulfur oxide
concentration are monitored, if required for calculation of the
stack gas flow rate.
<P>
c. Stack gas volumetric flow rate.  An in-stack flow meter may
be used to determine mass emissions to the atmosphere from affected
equipment, except:
<P>
i. when more than one affected piece of equipment vents to the
atmosphere through a single stack, or
<P>
ii. during periods of low flow rates when the flow rate is no
longer within the applicable range of the in-stack flow meter.
<P>
d. In lieu of complying with Chapter 2, Subdivision A, Paragraph
1, Subparagraph c if heat input rate is needed to determine the
stack gas volumetric flow rate, <U>t</U>he Facility Permit holder
shall include in the CEMS calculations the Fd factors listed in
40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A, Method 19, Table 19-1.  The Facility
Permit holder shall submit data to develop Fd factors when alternative
fuels are fired and obtain the approval of the Executive Officer
for use of the Fd factors before firing any alternative fuels.
<P>
e. Fuel gas flow rate if the CEMS uses the fuel gas flow rate
and the sulfur content of the fuel gas to determine the sulfur
oxide emissions.
<P>
f. Sulfur content of the fuel if the CEMS uses the fuel input
rate and the sulfur content of the fuel gas to determine the sulfur
oxides emission rate.
<P>
g. All applicable varaiables listed in Table 2-A.
<P>
h. The Facility Permit holder shall also provide any other data
necessary for calculating air contaminant emissions as determined
by the Executive Officer.
<P>
i. The data shall be recorded both by strip chart recorders and
computer print out.  The strip chart shall have a minimum chart
width of 10 inches, a readability of 0.5% of the span, and a minimum
of 100 chart divisions.
<P>
4. The Facility Permit holder must submit to the District his
certification test results and supporting document for each CEMS
by December 31, 1994.  It must certify that the results show that
the CEMS has met all the requirements of the rule if its submission
is after August 31, 1994.  Upon receipt of the test results and
the certification that the CEMS is in compliance, the District
will issue a Provisional Approval.
<P>
 After the Provisional Approval, all the data measured and recorded
by the CEMS will be considered valid quality assured data, (retroactive
to January 1, 1995) provided that the Executive Officer does not
issue a notice of disapproval of final certification.  Final certification
of the CEMS will be granted if the certification test results
show that the CEMS has met all the requirements of the rule.
<P>
 In the case where the test results show that the CEMS does not
meet all the requirements of the rule, the Executive Officer will
disapprove the final certification.  If this occurs, the previously
considered valid data from January 1, 1995 will have to be replaced
by data as specified in the &quot;Missing Data&quot; section of
the rule.  This procedure shall be used until the time that new
certification test results are submitted, and the CEMS has received
final approval by the District.
<P>
5. The variables listed in Table 2-A shall be measured and recorded
to track the operation of basic and control equipment independent
of measurements made by the monitoring equipment. The variables
found in Table 2-B shall be reported to the District's SOx Central
Station Computer.  Alternatives in Table 2-A and 2-B indicated
choices which must be specified in the Facility Permit for that
equipment.
<P>
6. As part of the Facility Permit Application review, the Executive
Officer may modify the list of Facility Permit holder-selected
variables.
<P>
7. Data on Facility Permit holder - selected variables shall be
made available to the District staff upon request.
<P>
8. Source tests shall be performed by testing firms/laboratories
who have received approval from the District by going through
the District's laboratory approval program.
<P>
9. All Relative Accuracy Test Audits (RATA) shall be performed
by testing firms/laboratories who have received approval from
the District by going through the District's laboratory approval
program.
<P>
10. Whenever EPA Protocol 1 gases are not available because National
Institute for Standards and Testing (NIST) does not produce Standard
Reference Materials (SRMs) for these gases at the appropriate
concentration, EPA Protocol 2 (use of gas dilution systems) may
be used to certify calibration gas standards.  In the case where
no SRMs are available, the facility can submit a gas calibration
protocol for approval, which specifies the steps to be taken for
analyzing the concentration and stability of calibration gases.
<P>
<B>B. MONITORING SYSTEMS</B>
<P>
<B>1. Information Required for Each 15-Minute Interval</B>
<P>
 All CEMS for affected equipment shall, at a minimum, generate
and record the following data points once for each successive
15-minute period on the hour and at equally spaced intervals thereafter:
<P>
a. Sulfur oxide concentration in the stack in units of ppmv.
<P>
b. Oxygen concentration or carbon dioxide in the stack in units
of percent.
<P>
c. Volumetric flow rate of stack gases in units of dry or wet
standard cubic feet per hour (dscfh or wscfh).  For affected equipment
standard gas conditions are defined as a temperature at 68<TT>&#176;</TT>F
and one atmosphere of pressure.
<P>
d. Fuel flow rates in units of standard cubic feet per hour (scfh)
for gaseous fuels or pounds per hour (lb/hr) for liquid fuels
if EPA Method 19 is used to calculate the stack gas volumetric
flow rate.
<P>
e. Sulfur oxide mass emissions in units of lb/hour. The sulfur
oxide emissions are calculated according to the following:
<P>
  ei = ai x ci x 1.662 x 10-7    (Eq. 1)
<P>
  where:
<P>
  ei = The mass emissions of sulfur oxides (lb/hr),
<P>
  ai = The stack gas concentration of sulfur oxide measured on
a dry basis(ppmv),
<P>
  ci = The stack gas volumetric flow rate (dscfh).<HR>

<P>
Example Calculation:<BR>
<BR>
    ai = 2.7 ppm<BR>
    ci = 90,000 dscfh<BR>
    ei = ai x ci  x 1.662 x 10-7<BR>
    ei = (2.7)(90,000)(1.662 x 10-7)<BR>
              = 0.04 lb/hr SOx<HR>

<P>
 When the CEMS uses the heat input rate and oxygen concentration
to determine the sulfur oxide emissions, the following equation
would be used to calculate the emission of sulfur oxide:
<P>
 r
<P>
    ei = ai x [20.9/(20.9 - bi)] x 1.662 x 10-7 x  <TT>&eth;</TT>
 (Fdij x dij x Vij)   (Eq. 2)
<P>
 j=1

<B>4. Operational Requirements</B>
<P>
 The CEMS shall be operated and data recorded during all periods
of operation of the affected SOx source including periods of start-up,
shutdown, malfunction or emergency conditions, except for CEMS
breakdowns and repairs.  Calibration data shall be recorded during
zero and span calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments.
 For periods of hot standby the Facility Permit holder may enter
a default value for SOx emissions.  Before using any default values
the Facility Permit holder must obtain the approval of the Executive
Officer and must include in the CEMS applications or CEMS plans
the estimates of SOx emissions, the SOx concentrations, the oxygen
concentrations, the sulfur content of fuel gas, and the fuel input
rates or the stack gas volumetric flow rates during hot standby
conditions.  The Executive Officer will approve only those emission
values which are found to correspond to hot standby conditions.
<P>
<B>5. Requirements for Valid Data Points</B>
<P>
 Valid data points are data points from the CEMS which meet the
requirements of Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraph 16 or which
are obtained by the methods indicated in Chapter 2, Subdivision
B, Paragraph 6 and Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraph 7.
<P>
a. Each CEMS and component thereof shall be capable of completing
a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling analyzing and data
recording) for each successive 15-minute interval.  All SOx concentration,
volumetric flow,  fuel gas sulfur content , and SOx emission data
shall be reduced to 1 hour averages.  These averages shall be
equally computed from four or more data points equally spaced
over each 1-hour period, except for periods of calibration, quality
assurance activities, CEMS maintenance, or CEMS repair.  During
these periods a valid hour shall consist of at least two data
points with each representing a 15 minute period and a cycle of
operation as described above, provided the number of these periods
does not exceed four per day.
<P>
b. Failure of the CEMS to acquire the required number of valid
data points shall result in the loss of such data for the entire
hour and the Facility Permit holder shall record and report data
by means of the data acquisition and handling system for the missing
hour in accordance with the applicable procedures for substituting
missing data in the Missing Data Procedures in Chapter 2, Subdivision
E of this document.
<P>
<B>6. Alternative Data Acquisition Using Reference Methods</B>
<P>
 a. When valid sulfur oxides emission data is not collected by
the permanently installed CEMS, emission rate data may be obtained
using District Methods 6.1 or 100.1 (for SOx concentration in
the stack gas) in conjunction with District Methods 1.1, 2.1,
3.1, and 4.1 or by using District Methods 6.1 or 100.1 in conjunction
with District Method 3.1 and EPA Method 19.  Emission rate data
may also be obtained using District Methods 307-91 or ASTM Method
D1072-90, Standard Test for Total Sulfur in Fuel Gases (for sulfur
content in the fuel gas) in conjunction with the fuel gas flow
rate.
<P>
 b. If the Facility Permit holder chooses to use a standby CEMS
(such as in a mobile van or other configuration), to obtain alternative
monitoring data at such times when the permanently installed CEMS
for the affected source(s) cannot produce valid data, then the
standby CEMS is subject to the following requirements:
<P>
   i. Standby CEMS shall be equivalent in relative accuracy, reliability,
reproducibility and timeliness to the corresponding permanently
installed CEMS.
<P>
   ii. The Facility Permit holder shall submit a standby CEMS
plan to the District for review prior to using the standby CEMS.
<P>

6 months for any source(s) within a calendar year.
<P>
   v. The Facility Permit holder shall notify the District within
24 hours if the standby CEMS is to be used in place of the permanently
installed CEMS.
<P>
   vi. During the first 30 days of standby CEMS use, the Facility
Permit holder shall conduct a Certified Gas Audit (CGA) of the
standby CEMS.
<P>
   vii. The Facility Permit holder shall notify the District within
the 30-day period if the standby CEMS shall be used longer than
30 days.
<P>
   viii. After the first 30 days of using the standby CEMS, the
Facility Permit holder shall conduct at least one RATA of the
standby CEMS and the RATA shall be conducted within 90 days of
the initial use of the standby CEMS.
<P>
   ix. All RATA and CGA shall be performed by testing firms/laboratories
who have received approval from the District by going through
the District's laboratory approval program.
<P>
   x. Immediately prior to obtaining data from the source(s) to
be monitored, the standby CEMS shall be quality assured in accordance
with District Method 100.1
<P>
<B>7. Alternative Data Acquisition Using Process Curves or Other
Means</B>
<P>
 Process curves of SOx emissions or other alternative means of
SOx emission data generation shall be used to obtain sulfur oxides
emission data, provided the Facility Permit holder has obtained
the approval of the Executive Officer prior to using alternate
means of SOx emission data generation.  The process curves and
the alternate means of SOx emission data generation mentioned
in this paragraph shall not be used more than 72 hours per calendar
month and shall only be used if no CEMS data or reference method
data gathered under Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraph 6 is available.
 Process curves may be used on units which have air pollution
control devices for the control of sulfur oxides emissions provided
the Facility Permit holder submits a complete list of operating
conditions that characterize the permitted operation.  The conditions
must be specified in the Facility Permit for that equipment. 
The process variables specified in the Facility Permit conditions
must be monitored by the source.
<P>
<B>8. Span Range Requirements for SO</B>x<B> Analyzers or Fuel
Gas Sulfur Analyzers</B>
<P>
  Full scale span ranges for the SOx or fuel gas sulfur analyzers
shall be set on an individual basis.  The full scale span range
of the analyzers shall be set so that all the data points gathered
by the CEMS lie within 20-95 percent of the full-scale span range.
 During any clock hour, up to 25 percent of the data falling outside
these limits and between 0-99 percent of the full scale span range
may be reported as valid data, but only up to 2.5 hours during
any reporting day. If any data points fall above 99 percent of
full scale span range, the applicable procedures for substituting
missing data in the Missing Data Procedures in Chapter 2, Subdivision
E of these guidelines shall be used for that hour.
<P>
<B>9. Calibration Drift Requirements</B>
<P>
 The CEMS design shall allow determination of calibration drift
(both negative and positive) at zero level (0 to 20 percent of
full scale and high-level (80 to 100 percent of full scale) values.
 Alternative low-level and high-level span values shall be allowed
with the prior written approval of the Executive Officer.
<P>
<B>10. Relative Accuracy Requirements for Stack Gas Volumetric
Flow Measurement Systems</B>
<P>
  The stack gas volumetric flow measurement system shall meet
a relative accuracy requirement of being less than or equal to
10 percent of the mean value of the reference method test data
in units of DSCFH.  Relative accuracy is calculated  by the equations
in Section 8 of 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification
2.  The volumetric flow measurement system shall also meet the
specifications in Attachment B (BIAS TEST) of this protocol. 
The District recommends (but does not require) performing a flow
profile study following the procedures in 40 CFR, Part 60, Appendix
A, Test Method 1, Section 2.5 to determine the acceptability of
the potential flow monitor location and to determine the number
and location of flow sampling points required to obtain a representative
flow value.
<P>
 <B>11. Quality Assurance for Fuel Flow Meters</B>
<P>
  Fuel flow measuring devices used for obtaining stack flow in
conjunction with F-factors shall be tested as installed for relative
accuracy using reference methods to determine stack flow.
<P>
  If the flow device manufacturer has a method or device that
permits the fuel flow measuring device to be tested as installed
for relative accuracy, the Facility Permit holder shall request
approval from the Executive Officer.  Approval will be granted
in cases where the Facility Permit holder can demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Executive Officer that no suitable testing
location exists in the exhaust stacks or ducts and that it would
be an inordinate cost burden to modify the exhaust stack configuration
to provide a suitable testing location.  The method or device
used for relative accuracy testing shall be traceable to NIST
standards.  This method shall be used only if natural gas, fuel
oil, or other fuels which the Facility Permit holder can show
to the satisfaction of the Executive Officer have stable F- factors
and gross heating values, or if the Facility Permit holder measures
the F-factor and gross heating value of the fuel.
<P>
<B>12. Relative Accuracy Requirements for Emission Rate Measurement</B>
<P>
 <B> </B>The emission rate measurement shall meet a relative accuracy
requirement of being less than or equal to 20 percent of the mean
value of the reference method test data in units of lb/hr.  Relative
accuracy is calculated  by the equations in Section 8 of 40 CFR
Part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification 2.  The emission
rate measurement shall also meet the specifications in Attachment
B (BIAS TEST) of this Appendix A.
<P>
<B>13. Certification Requirements for Analyzers</B>
<P>
  The portion of the CEMS which samples, conditions, analyzes,
and records the sulfur oxides and oxygen concentrations in the
stack gas or the sulfur in the fuel gas shall be certified according
to the specifications in 40 CFR, Part 60, Appendix B, Performance
Specifications 2 and 3.  The portion of the CEMS which samples,
conditions, analyzes, and records the sulfur in the fuel gas shall
be certified using the specifications in 40 CFR, Part 60, Appendix
B, Performance Specification 2 with the exception that District
Method 307-91 shall be used for reference method to determine
the sulfur content in the fuel gas.  Units using monitors with
more than one span range must perform the calibration error test
on all span ranges.  This portion of the CEMS shall also meet
the specifications in Attachment B of this Appendix A.
<P>
<B>14. Provisional Approval</B>
<P>
 The Facility Permit holder of a major source shall submit certification
test results and supporting documents to the District for each
CEMS by December 31, 1994 for Cycle 1 facilities and June 30,
1995 for Cycle 2 facilities.  The Facility Permit holder shall
certify that the results show that the CEMS has met all the requirements
of the protocol if its submission is after August 31, 1994.  Upon
receipt of the test results and the certification that the CEMS
is in compliance, the District will issue a Provisional Approval.
<P>
 After the Provisional Approval, all the data measured and recorded
by the CEMS will be considered valid quality assured data, (retroactive
to January 1, 1995) provided that the Executive Officer does not
issue a notice of disapproval of final certification.  Final certification
of the CEMS will be granted if the certification test results
show that the CEMS has met all the requirements of the protocol.
<P>
 In the case where the test results show that the CEMS does not
meet all the requirements of the rule, the Executive Officer will
disapprove the final certification.  If this occurs, the previously
considered valid data from January 1, 1995 will be replaced by
data as specified in the &quot;Missing Data&quot; section of the
protocol.  This procedure shall be used until the time that new
certification test results are submitted, and the CEMS has received
final approval by the District.
<P>
<B>15. Sampling Location Requirements</B>
<P>
 Each affected piece of equipment shall have sampling locations
which meet the &quot;Guidelines for Construction of Sampling and
Testing Facilities&quot; in the District Source Test Manual. 
If an alternate location (not conforming to the criteria of eight
duct diameters downstream and two diameters upstream from a flow
disturbance) is used, the absence of flow disturbance shall be
demonstrated by using the District method in the Source Test Manual,
Chapter X, Section 1.4 or 40 CFR, Part 60, Appendix A, Method
1. Section 2.5 and the absence of stratification shall be demonstrated
using District method in the Source Test Manual, Chapter X, Section
13.
<P>
<B>16. Sampling Line Requirement</B>
<P>
  The CEMS sample line from the CEMS probe to the sample conditioning
system shall be heated to maintain the sample temperature above
the dew point of the sample.  This requirement does not apply
to dilution probe systems where no sample condensation occurs.
<P>
<B>17. Recertification Requirements</B>
<P>
 The District will reevaluate the monitoring systems at any affected
piece of equipment where changes to the basic process equipment
or air pollution control equipment occur, to determine the proper
full span range of the monitors.  Any monitor system requiring
change to its full span range in order to meet the criteria in
Chapter 2,. Subdivision B, Paragraph 8 shall be recertified according
to all the specifications in  Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraph
10, Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraph  11, and Chapter 2, Subdivision
B, Paragraph 12 as applicable, including the relative accuracy
tests, the calibration drift tests, and the calibration error
tests.  A new CEMS plan shall be submitted for each CEMS which
is reevaluated.
<P>
 The recertification for any existing CEMS shall be completed
within 90 days of the start-up of newly changed or modified equipment
monitored by such CEMS.  The Facility Permit holder shall calculate
and report SOx emission data for the period prior to the CEMS
recertification by means of the automated data acquisition and
handling system according to the following procedures:
<P>
<I> </I>a. For any CEMS which is recertified within 90 days of
start-up of the newly modified equipment, the emission data recorded
by the CEMS prior to the recertification would be considered valid
and shall be used for calculating and reporting SOx emissions
for the equipment it serves.
<P>
<I> </I>b. For any CEMS which is not recertified within 90 days
of start-up of the newly modified equipment, the 90th percentile
emission data (lb/day) for the previous 90 unit operating days
recorded by the CEMS prior to the recertification shall be used
for calculating and reporting SOx emissions for the equipment
it serves.

<B>D. ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES FOR EMISSION STACK FLOW RATE DETERMINATION</B>
<P>
<B>1. Multiple Sources Venting to a Common Stack</B>
<P>
 In the event that more than one source vents to a common stack,
the alternative reference method for determining individual source
flow rates shall use the F-factors in EPA Method 19 and the following
equation:
<P>
 r
<P>
 ci = [20.9/(20.9 - bi)] x  &eth;  (Fdij x dij x Vij) (Eq. 12)
<P>
 j=1
<P>
where:
<P>
ci = The mass emissions of sulfur dioxide (lb/hr),
<P>
bi = The stack gas concentrations of oxygen on a dry basis (%),
<P>
r = The number of different types of fuel,
<P>
Fdij = The dry F factor for each type of fuel, the ratio of the
dry gas volume of the products of combustion to the heat content
of the fuel (dscf/106 Btu),
<P>
dij = The metered fuel flow rate for each type of fuel measured
every 15-minute period,
<P>
Vij = The higher heating value of the fuel for each type of fuel
<P>
 The product (dij x Vij) must have units of millions of Btu per
hour (106 Btu/hr).  All concentrations and stack gas flow rates
shall be calculated on a consistent wet or dry basis.  The measurement
of wet concentration and wet F factor shall be allowed provided
that wet concentration of NOx is measured.<HR>

<P>
Example Calculation:<BR>
<BR>
 Gaseous Fuel<BR>
<BR>
 bi = 4.2% O2<BR>
<BR>
 Fdji = 8710 dscf/106 Btu<BR>
<BR>
 dji = 50,000 scfh<BR>
<BR>
 Vji = 1050 Btu/dscf<BR>
<BR>
 cig = [20.9/(20.9 - 4.2)] x [(8710/106)(50,000)(1050)<BR>
<BR>
 cig = 570,938 dscfh<BR>
<BR>
 Liquid Fuel:<BR>
<BR>
 bi = 4.2% O2<BR>
<BR>
 Fdji = 9,190 dscf/106 Btu<BR>
<BR>
 dji = 500 gal/hr.<BR>
<BR>
 Vji = 136,000 Btu/gal.<BR>
<BR>
 cil = (20.9/20.9 - 4.2)(9,190/106)(136,000)(500) = 781,150 dscfh

<P>
 This method shall be used for applicable sources before and after
the interim period mentioned in Chapter 2, Subdivision C, Paragraph
1.  The orifice plates used in each affected piece of equipment
vented to a common stack shall meet the requirements in Chapter
2, Subdivision D, Paragraph 2.
<P>
<B>2. Quality Assurance for Orifice Plate Measurements (Applies
Only to Multiple Sources Venting to a Common Stack)</B>
<P>
 Each orifice plate used to measure the fuel gas flow rate shall
be checked once every 12 months using Reference Methods.  If the
orifice plate cannot be checked using Reference Methods, it may
be checked using other methods that can show traceability to NIST
Standards.  If the orifice plate cannot be checked by Reference
Methods or other methods that can show traceability to NIST standards,
the orifice plate shall be removed from the gas supply line for
an inspection once every 12 months, and  the following inspection
procedure shall be followed:
<P>
a. Each orifice plate shall be visually inspected for any nicks,
dents, corrosion, erosion, or any other signs of damage according
to the orifice plate manufacturer's specifications.
<P>
b. The diameter of each orifice shall be measured using the method
recommended by the orifice plate manufacturer.
<P>
c. The flatness of the orifice plate shall be checked according
to the orifice plate manufacturer's instructions. The departure
from flatness of an orifice plate shall not exceed 0.010 inches
per inch of dam height (D-d/2) along any diameter. Here D is the
inside pipe diameter and d is the orifice diameter at its narrowest
constriction.
<P>
d. The pressure gauge or other device measuring pressure drop
across the orifice shall be calibrated against a manometer, and
shall be replaced if it deviates more than &#177;2 percent across
the range.
<P>
e. The surface roughness shall be measured using the method recommended
by the orifice plate manufacturer. The surface roughness of an
orifice plate shall not exceed 50 microinches.
<P>
f. The upstream edge of the measuring orifice shall be square
and sharp so that it shall not show a beam of light when checked
with an orifice gauge.
<P>
g. In centering orifice plates, the orifice shall be concentric
with the inside of the meter tube or fitting. The concentricity
shall be maintained within 3 percent of the inside diameter of
the tube or fitting along all diameters.
<P>
h. Any other calibration tests specified by the orifice plate
manufacturer shall be conducted at this time.
<P>
 If an orifice plate fails to meet any of the manufacturer's specifications,
it shall be replaced within two weeks.
<P>
 3<I>.</I> Fuel flow measuring devices used for obtaining stack
flow in conjunction with F-factors shall be tested as installed
for relative accuracy using reference methods to determine stack
flow.
<P>
 If the flow device manufacturer has a method or device that permits
the fuel flow measuring device to be tested as installed for relative
accuracy, the Facility Permit holder shall request approval from
the Executive Officer.  Approval will be granted in cases where
the Facility Permit holder can demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Executive Officer that no suitable testing location exists
in the exhaust stacks or ducts and that it would be an inordinate
cost burden to modify the exhaust stack configuration to provide
a suitable testing
<P>
 location.  The method or device used for relative accuracy testing
shall be traceable to NIST standards.  This method shall be used
only if natural gas, fuel oil, or other fuels which the Facility
Permit holder can demonstrate to the Executive Officer have stable
F-factors and gross heating values, or if the Facility Permit
holder measures the F-factor and gross heating value of the fuel.

 The filter holder must provide a positive seal against leakage
from the outside or around the filter.  A high-efficiency glass
fiber filter shall be used.  The borosilicate or quartz glass
probe shall be heated and its temperature maintained at greater
than 225 oF.
<P>
 Smith-Greenburg impingers shall be used instead of the midget
impingers.  The isopropanol impinger shall not be used.  The first
and second impingers shall contain 100 milliliters of 3% hydrogen
peroxide, the third impinger shall be blank, and the fourth impinger
shall contain silica gel.

<P>
 To establish an alternative emission factor, a minimum of three
separate tests shall be run at each condition throughput that
the equipment is expected to operate.  Each set of tests shall
cover the different operating conditions of the cycle in sequence.
 The cycle shall be repeated in the same manner for the next set
of tests.
<P>
<B>C. Testing frequency</B>
<P>
 The Facility Permit holders of major SOx sources shall source
test as part of their quality assurance program.  Process units
shall be source tested every time the Facility Permit holder applies
for an alternative emission factors.
<P>
<B>D. Sampling time and test procedures </B>
<P>
1. For boilers, heaters, IC engines, turbines - tests shall be

operating conditions should be followed for each separate test,
with each test condition being monitored for a minimum of 15 minutes.
<P>
2. Furnaces, kilns, dryers, calciners and ovens, operating continuously,
shall be monitored for a minimum of 30 minutes, for each testing
condition.  For non-continuous operations (i.e. batch) samples
shall be taken for each phase of the operation (i.e. metal furnace
charging, fluxing, melting, sweating and taping), for a minimum
of 15 minutes or as long as the phase lasts.  Data shall be submitted
on the time that it takes to complete each phase, and the emissions
for the total cycle shall be calculated based on the time required
to complete each phase and the emissions measured during the corresponding
phase.
<P>
3. Incinerators and afterburners shall be monitored for a minimum
of 15 minutes at each operating temperature and at each flow rate.
<P>
4. Engine test cells shall be monitored over the total cycle if
it lasts less than 30 minutes.  Otherwise monitor for 15 minutes
at each engine test condition, or the total time if less than
15 minutes.
<P>
5. For the equipment not included above, an individual test plan
shall be submitted for approval by the Executive Officer.  This
plan shall include justification on how the measurements shall
quantify equipment emissions.
<P>
<B>E. Guidelines for Testing to Establish an Alternative Emission
Factor</B>
<P>
1. For process units the Facility Permit holder has the option
of having an equipment-specific or category-specific emission
factor based on the average fuel sulfur content is determined
from the source test.  The average fuel sulfur content or equipment-specific
or category-specific emission factor shall be used to determine
compliance with the facility's allocations.
<P>
2. In order to establish an alternative emission factor for the
process unit without post-combustion control equipment, the fuel
sulfur content shall be measured once per week over a quarterly
period.  This quarterly measurement shall be required whenever
an alternative emission factor is established.  If the process
unit burns the fuel of which the sulfur content is treated prior
to the combustion , the sulfur content shall be source tested
at the downstream of the sulfur treatment system  After the measured
data set succeeding the confidence interval test described in
Chapter 6, Subdivision E, Paragraph 6, the average sulfur content
shall be converted into alternative emission factor using equations
provided in Chapter 6, Subdivision E, Paragraph 4.
<P>
3. In order to establish an alternative emission factor for the
process until with post-combustion control equipment, the exhaust
SOx concentration shall be source tested at the downstream of
the control equipment at four different representative operating
conditions of the proposed process unit.  Such testing shall be
done at least three times at each condition, but not consecutively.
 After the measured data set succeeding the confidence interval
test described in Chapter 6, Subdivision E, Paragraph 6, the average
stack concentration shall be  converted to the alternative emission
factor using the equations provided in Chapter 6, Subdivision
E, Paragraph 5.
<P>
4. For process unit without post-combustion equipment, an average
fuel sulfur content that satisfies the confidence interval test
described in Chapter 6, Subdivision E, Paragraph 6, shall be converted
into an alternative emission factor by the following equation:
<P>
 For gaseous fuels,
<P>
 EFk = Ckg x 0.166 (Eq.23)
<P>
 or
<P>
 EFk = Ckl x 2.86 (Eq.24)
<P>
 For liquid fuels, 
<P>
 EFk = Ckl x Sl x 166 (Eq.25)
<P>
  where:
<P>
   EFk = The fuel specific alternative emission factor for gaseous
or liquid fuel (lb/mmscf or lb/mgal).
<P>
   Ckg = The average fuel sulfur content of gaseous fuel determined
form Eq. 28 in Chapter 6, Subdivision E, Paragraph 6 (ppmv).
<P>
   Cka = The average fuel sulfur content of gaseous fuel determined
form Eq. 28 in Chapter 6, Subdivision E, Paragraph 6 (grain/100ft3).
<P>
   Ckl = The average fuel sulfur content for gaseous fuel determined
from Eq. 28 in Chapter 6, Subdivision E, Paragraph 6 (percent
by weight).
<P>
   sl = The specific gravity of liquid fuel.
<P>
   k = The different type of fuel.<HR>

<P>
Example Calculations:<BR>
<BR>
(a) Alternative emission factor for process unit without post-combustion
control equipment,<BR>
<BR>
 A 5 mmbtu/hr boiler burns natural gas.  The average sulfur content
of the gaseous fuel is 30 ppmv.<BR>
<BR>
 EFk  =  Ckg x 0.166<BR>
<BR>
 EFk  = (30)(0.166)<BR>
<BR>
   =  4.98 lb/mmscf of SOx emission factor<BR>
<BR>
(b) Alternative emission factor for process unit without post-combustion
control equipment, but with pre-combustion sulfur treatment system
<BR>
<BR>
 A 500 bhp ICE burns Diesel Oil.  The specific gravity of the
liquid fuel is 0.82.  The average sulfur content determined after
confidence interval test came out to be 0.05% by weight, which
is the treated sulfur content.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
 EFk  = Ckl x Sl x 166<BR>
<BR>
   = (.05)(.82)(166)<BR>
<BR>
   = 6.806 lb/mgal of SOx emission factor<BR>
<HR>

<P>
5. For process unit with control equipment, the exhaust SOx concentration
and exhaust oxygen or stack exhaust flow rate shall be source
tested at downstream of the control equipment and shall be converted
to an alternative emission factor by one of the following equation:
<P>
 when the exhaust oxygen is source tested,
<P>
 EFki = PPMVi x (20.9/20.9-b) x 1.662 x 10-13 x Fd x V     (Eq.26)
<P>
 when the stack exhaust flow rate is source tested,
<P>
 EFki = PPMVi x (C/d) x 1.662 x 10-7 (Eq.27)
<P>
 where:
<P>
   EFki = The fuel-specific alternative emission factor as specified
in the Facility Permit (lb/mmscf for gaseous fuel or lb/mgal of
 liquid fuel)
<P>
   k = Each type of fuel.
<P>
   i = Each data source tested at each operating condition.
<P>
   PPMV = The stack concentration of SOx (ppmv).
<P>
   b = The exhaust oxygen concentration determined from the source
test (%).
<P>

the dry gas volume of the products of combustion to the heat content
of the fuel (dscf/106 Btu).
<P>
   V = The higher heating value of the fuel for each type of fuel.
<P>
   C= The exhaust flow rate of the stack determined from the source
test (dscf per unit time).
<P>
   d = The fuel flow rate (mmscf per unit time for gaseous fuels,
mgal per unit time for liquid fuels).
<P>
 The exhaust flow rate shall be determined in consistent unit
with fuel flow rate.  For example, if C is measured as dscf per
hour, d shall be measured as mmscf per hour or mgal per hour.
<P>
6. The criterion for acceptability of the average fuel sulfur
content shall be a 95% confidence interval that the tested fuel
sulfur contents shall be within 20% of the average fuel sulfur
content.  The average fuel sulfur content over a quarterly period
shall be determined according to:

input requirements shall be specified as required for each RTU.
 Communications software shall be capable of supporting the hardware
required to receive these inputs.  If analog data cards must be
installed in the RTU any resulting  values provided to the RTU
data bus shall range from -32768 to +32767 for unscaled values.
 The same accuracy as emission monitoring system network data
shall be provided for analog data values scaled on the I/O device
before going onto the RTU data bus.
<P>
(iii). Input Data Conversion/Storage
<P>
 All input values shall be stored in as received ASCII format.
 These values shall then be parsed and converted to real numbers
for calculations and averaging.
<P>
(iv). Output Data To Central Station
<P>
 The context diagram displays how the RTU software shall be configured
to allow  messages to be sent to the Central Station.  File transfer
for all messages shall be in ASCII format including a bitsum check
value with a return acknowledgment expected by the RTU when the
Central Station has verified the bitsum check.
<P>
(v). RTU To Central Station Communications Failure
<P>
 If the RTU cannot communicate with the Central Station the main
program shall  store all calculated values and reports in a special
file in non-volatile memory.  These special files shall be labeled
to show that they have not been acknowledged as received by the
Central Station.

<P>
g). Performance Requirements
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(i). Speed of Receiving DATA
<P>
 Incoming data from the plant or emission monitoring system shall
be received at intervals specified in the appropriate emission
monitoring guideline. Communication with the Central Station,
Parsing, verification, storage and checking shall not block the
receipt of new data.
<P>
(ii). RTU Non-Volatile Memory
<P>
 The RTU non-volatile memory shall have enough capacity to store
all programs, data parameters, emission monitoring system input
data and calculated data averages.  Input data and calculated
averages shall be allocated space using the first in first out
(FIFO) method to store the quantity of data as required.
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
h). Design Restraints
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(i). Data Set Formats
<P>
 Section (D) indicates the data format that is to be sent to the
Central Station at scheduled intervals.  The Central Station will
send a confirmation message back for each transmission received
which will consist of an identification number unique to the Central
Station and a transaction number which is sequentially issued.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
i). RTU External Interface Requirements
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(i). Central Station Interface
<P>
 External interface to the RTU is shown on the Context Diagram
at the end of this chapter. Central Station interface is described
above as fixed format ASCII messages using a commercially available
communication software package.  In return the Central Station
will send confirmation messages in ASCII form when a satisfactory
message transfer has been completed.

This document provides the technical specifications for normally
operated RECLAIM sources subject to District Rule 2012 &quot;Requirements
for Monitoring, Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Nitrogen
(NOx) Emissions.&quot;  District Rule 2012 divides sources into
four categories - major sources, large sources, NOx process units
and equipment designated in Rule 219 - Equipment Not Requiring
A Written Permit Pursuant To Regulation II.    One difference
in requirements between these source categories is the monitoring
approach.  A major source shall be monitored by a continuous emissions
monitoring system (CEMS) or alternative monitoring system; a large
source has the option to be monitored by a continuous process
monitoring system (CPMS); and a NOx process unit has the option
to be monitored manually by a fuel meter and/or timer, and any
other device specified by the Executive Officer, in accordance
with approval criteria stated in Rule 2012.
<P>
Another distinction between major and large sources and process
units is the way in which they transmit data to the District's
Central Station and the reporting frequency.  Major sources shall
electronically transmit the data via an RTU on a daily basis.
 In addition, the aggregated NOx emissions from all major sources
shall be submitted in a Monthly Emissions Report. Large sources
and process units have the option to report data via the RTU or
other acceptable approaches such as a modem.  Large sources report
monthly; NOx process units shall submit emission data as part
of the Quarterly Certification  of Emissions required by Rule
2004 - Requirements.
<P>
The criteria for determining the applicable NOx RECLAIM category
is presented in Table 1-A for a major source, Table 1-B for a
large source, and Table 1-C for a NOx process unit.  A fourth
class of NOx sources are those that are exempt from permits per
Rule 219.  For both NOx process units and equipment exempt under
Rule 219, the Facility Permit holder shall report the NOx emissions
in the Quarterly Certification of Emissions .  Election conditions
for large sources and process units based on a NOx emission factor,
concentration limit or emission rate would be part of an amendment
to the Facility Permit.  Election conditions for process units
based on  category-specific emission rate shall also require an
amendment to the Facility Permit.
<P>
The Facility Permit will limit mass emissions in accordance with
the following:
<P>
<TT>&eth;</TT> ECEMS  +  <TT>&eth;</TT> ECL<TT> </TT>+<TT> &eth;</TT>
E ER +  <TT>&eth;</TT> EEF  + <TT>&eth;</TT>  E219  <TT>&#181;</TT>
 RTCs  
<P>
where:
<P>
<TT> &eth;</TT> ECEMS = sum of facility emissions monitored by
CEMS or alternative monitoring system
<P>
<TT> &eth;</TT> ECL = sum of facility emissions from large sources
subject to concentration limits
<P>
<TT> &eth;</TT> EER = sum of facility emissions from large sources
and process units subject to emission rates
<P>
 <TT>&eth;</TT> EEF = sum of facility emissions from large sources*
and process units subject to emission factors 
<P>
<TT> &eth;</TT> E219 = sum of facility emissions from equipment
exempt under Rule 219 
<P>
 RTC  = RECLAIM Trading Credit held by the Facility Permit holder
<P>
The fuel usage for any large source, process unit, or equipment
exempt under Rule 219 shall not exceed the value determined in
accordance with the following relationship:
<P>
<TT>&eth;</TT> (FxEF)pu,l + <TT>&eth;</TT> (FxER)pu,l<TT> + &eth;</TT>
(FxEF)219 <U>&lt;</U> RTC - <TT>&eth;</TT> ECEMS - <TT>&eth;</TT>
ECL
<P>
 where:
<P>
 F = Fuel usage for the large source, process unit, or equipment
exempt under Rule 219
<P>
The Facility Permit holder shall document the duration of operating
time of any rental equipment at the Facility.  Emissions generated
by any rental equipment which exceeds 72 hours of operation in
a quarter shall be determined and reported by the Facility Permit
holder according to the applicable methodology for major or large
sources or process units or Rule 219 exempt equipment.
<P>
This document has been divided into chapters addressing the various
compliance aspects of Rule 2012.  A summary of these chapters
follows:
<P>
<B> CHAPTERS 2 AND 3:  MAJOR (CEMS) AND LARGE (CPMS) SOURCES</B>
<P>
Chapters 2 and 3 describe the methodologies for measuring and
reporting emissions from major and large sources, respectively.
 If a major source category is applicable then the Facility Permit
holder shall be required to comply with the performance standards
associated with a CEMS or an approved alternative monitoring system.
<P>
For large sources, the Facility Permit holder shall use a CEMS
or elect to use a CPMS to measure NOx emissions.  With a CPMS,
the focal point for determining NOx emissions in this source category
shall be the emission factor, concentration limit, or equipment-specific
emission rate.  In its most simplistic form, mass emissions shall
be estimated by using the emission factor* (e.g., lb/mmscf), emission
rate (e.g., lb/mmBtu), or concentration limit (e.g., ppmv converted
to lb/mmBtu) and a throughput rate (typically fuel consumption
adjusted for heating value).
<P>
Unless specifically exempted by Rule 2012, the Facility Permit
holder for a major source shall measure and record all applicable
measured variables as specified in Table 2-A.  The Facility Permit
holder for a large source shall measure and record one or more
measured variables as specified in Table 3-A.
<P>
For large sources, process units and Rule 219 equipment, measurement
and reporting requirements apply to variables used to calculate
the NOx emissions.  The Facility Permit will specify either a
concentration limit or an emission rate for a large source, in
accordance with Rule 2012.  One or more measured variables necessary
to substantiate the equipment specific emission rate shall be
monitored for large sources.  Fuel usage or throughput is required
to be measured for large sources subject to a concentration limit.
<P>
 * On and after January 1, 1995 (Cycle 1 facilities) and July
1, 1995 (Cycle 2 facilities), large-source emissions shall not
be based on emission factors.
<P>
Several important aspects of Chapters 2 and 3 include:
<P>
 <TT>&#176;</TT> equations describing the methods used to calculate
NOx emissions
<P>
 <TT>&#176;</TT> operational requirements
<P>
 <TT>&#176;</TT> obtaining valid data points
<P>
 <TT>&#176;</TT> alternative data acquisition methods
<P>
 <TT>&#176;</TT> accuracy requirements
<P>
 <TT>&#176;</TT> quality assurance procedures
<P>
 <TT>&#176;</TT> missing data procedures
<P>
 <TT>&#176;</TT> final and interim reporting procedures, and
<P>
 <TT>&#176;</TT> time-sharing
<P>
The concentration limit for large sources plays an important role
in assessing the equipment's compliance status.  If a large source
exceeds the applicable concentration limit then the equipment
shall be in violation of District Rules.  The methodology for
determining the applicable concentration limit is covered in Chapters
3 and 5.
<P>
The protocol allows for election to a different monitoring classification
by fuel usage.  Dedicated fuel meters for major and large sources
shall be required for fuel usage verification.  The emission rate
for large sources shall comply with source testing requirements
specified in Chapter 6.  Once approved by the Executive Officer,
an emission rate serves as an &quot;average&quot; value representing
the source's annual NOx emissions.
<P>
<B> CHAPTER 4:  PROCESS UNITS- PERIODIC REPORTING AND RULE 219
EQUIPMENT</B>
<P>
Chapter 4 describes the measuring and reporting requirements for
the NOx process unit category.  NOx process units, which comprise
 one or more pieces of equipment in accordance with Rule 2012,
shall base emission calculations primarily on fuel consumption
or operating time in conjuction with an emission factor or emission
rate. 
<P>
Important aspects of Chapter 4 include equations describing the
method used to calculate NOx emissions and reporting procedures,
as well as determining NOx emissions from equipment exempt under
Rule 219.
<P>
<B> CHAPTER 5 - ALL SOURCES AND UNITS - SOURCE TESTING</B>
<P>
Large sources shall require source testing to establish emission
rates and concentration limits, and verify compliance with the
concentration limit.  Process units shall require source testing
only to establish alternative emission rates.  Chapter 5 presents
a brief description of the required test methods and the required
source testing and tune-up frequency for affected equipment.
<P>
<B> CHAPTER 6 - ALL SOURCES AND UNITS - DETERMINING SOURCE CATEGORY
STATUS</B>
<P>
As shown in Tables 1-A, 1-B, and 1-C all NOx RECLAIM equipment
are categorized by equipment rating, mass emissions and annual
operating capacity.  On that basis, Chapter 6 prescribes the methodology
for assessing these criteria so that the RECLAIM Facility Permit
holder can adequately categorize each piece of equipment.
<P>
<B> CHAPTER </B>7<B> - REMOTE TERMINAL UNITS (RTU) - ELECTRONIC
REPORTING</B>
<P>
Once the variables for determining emissions and tracking equipment
operations have been measured, the measured data shall be stored
at the facility.  In addition, selected measured and calculated
data shall be transmitted to the District's Central Station. 
This storing and transmitting of data shall be performed by the
remote terminal unit (RTU) for a major source.
<P>
The use of a RTU for reporting purposes is optional for large
sources, process units, and Rule 219 equipment.
<P>
Chapter 7 specifies tasks and characteristics required of the
RTU as well as a guide for providing the required software/hardware
for the RTU.  In addition, this chapter serves as a:
<P>
  <TT>&#176;</TT> a functional guideline for operating requirements
of the RTU, and
<P>
  <TT>&#176;</TT> an information source concerning RTU hardware/software
procurement, configuration, installation, maintenance, and compatibility
with the monitoring equipment and the District's Central Station.

Between January 1. 1994 and December 31, 1994 (Cycle 1 facilities)
and between July 1, 1994 and June 30, 1995 (Cycle 2 facilities),
major sources  shall be allowed to use an interim reporting procedure
to measure and record NOx emissions on a monthly basis according
to the requirements specified in Chapter 3 &quot;Large Sources
- Continuous Process Monitoring System (CPMS)&quot; or by extracting
NOx emission data from existing District certified continuous
emissions monitoring system (CEMS).   Chapter 2, Subdivision C,
Paragraph 1 specifies the requirements for this interim period.
 On and after January 1, 1995 (Cycle 1 facilities) and July 1,1995
(Cycle 2 facilities), the Facility Permit holder of each major
source shall report the daily NOx emissions by 5:00 p.m. of the
following day and comply with all other applicable requirements
(except Chapter 2, Subdivision C, Paragraph 1) specified in this
chapter.
<P>
The Facility Permit holder of a source that is required to install
CEMS may request the Executive Officer to approve an alternative
monitoring device (or system components) to quantify the emissions
of NOx.  The applicant shall demonstrate to the Executive Officer
that the proposed alternative monitoring device is at a minimum
equivalent in relative accuracy, precision, reliability, and timeliness
to a CEMS for that source, according to the criteria specified
in 40 CFR Part 75 Subpart E.  In lieu of the criteria specified
in 40 CFR Part 75 Subpart E, substitute criteria is acceptable
if the applicant demonstrates to the Executive Officer that the
proposed alternative monitoring device is at minimum equivalent
in relative accuracy precision, reliability, and timeliness to
a CEMS for that source.  Upon approval by the Executive Officer,
the substitute criteria shall be submitted to the federal Environmental
Protection Agency as an amendment to the State Implementation
Plan (SIP).
<P>
<B>A. MEASUREMENT REQUIREMENTS</B>

a. Nitrogen oxide concentrations in the gases discharged to the
atmosphere from affected equipment;
<P>
b. Oxygen concentrations, at each location where nitrogen oxide
concentrations are monitored, if required for calculation of the
stack gas flow rate;
<P>
c. Stack gas volumetric flow rate.  An in-stack flow meter may
be used to determine mass emissions to the atmosphere from affected
equipment, except:
<P>
i. when more than one affected piece of equipment vents  to the
atmosphere through a single stack; or
<P>
ii. during periods of low flow rates when the flow rate is no
longer within the applicable range of the in-stack flow meter.
<P>
d. In lieu of complying with Chapter 2, Subdivision A, Paragraph
1, Subparagraph c, if heat input rate is needed to determine the
stack gas volumetric flow rate, the Facility Permit holder shall
include in the CEMS calculations the Fd factors listed in 40 CFR
Part 60, Appendix A, Method 19, Table 19-1.  The Facility Permit
holder shall submit data to develop Fd factors when alternative
fuels are fired and obtain the approval of the Executive Officer
for use of the Fd factors before firing any alternative fuel.
<P>
e. All applicable variables listed in Table 2-A.

the stack gas) in conjunction with District Methods 1.1, 2.1,
3.1, and 4.1 or by using District Methods 7.1 or 100.1 in conjunction
with District Method 3.1 and EPA Method 19.  For District Method
7.1 a minimum of 12 samples, equally spaced over a one-hour period,
shall be taken.  Each sample shall represent the five-minute period
in which it was taken.
<P>
  b. If the Facility Permit holder chooses to use a standby CEMS
(such as in a mobile van or other configuration), to obtain alternative
monitoring data at such times when the permanently installed CEMS
for the affected source(s) cannot produce valid data, then the

testing firms/laboratories who have received approval from the
District by going through the District's laboratory approval program.
<P>
   x. Immediately prior to obtaining data from the source(s) to
be monitored, the standby CEMS shall be quality assured in accordance
with District Method 100.1
<P>
<B>7. Alternative Data Acquisition Using Process Curves or Other
Means</B>
<P>
 Process curves of NOx emission rates or other alternative means
of NOx emission rate data generation may be used to obtain nitrogen
oxides emission data, provided the Facility Permit holder has
obtained the approval of the Executive Officer prior to using
alternate means of NOx emission rate data generation.  The process
curves and the alternate means of NOx emission data generation
mentioned in this paragraph shall not be used more than 72 hours
per calendar month and may only be used if no CEMS data or reference
method data gathered under Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraph
6 is available.  Process curves may be used on units which have
air pollution control devices for the control of nitrogen oxides
emissions provided the Facility Permit holder submits a complete
list of operating conditions that characterize the permitted operation.
 The conditions will be specified in the Facility Permit for that
equipment.  The process variables specified in the Facility Permit
conditions shall be monitored by the source.
<P>
<B>8. Span Range Requirements for NO</B>x<B> Analyzers</B>
<P>

<P>
<B>9. Calibration Drift Requirements</B>
<P>
 The CEMS design shall allow determination of calibration drift
(both negative and positive) at zero-level (0 to 20 percent of
full scale) and high-level (80 to 100 percent of full scale) values.
 Alternative low-level and high-level span values may be allowed
with the prior written approval of the Executive Officer.
<P>
<B>10. Relative Accuracy Requirements for Stack Gas Volumetric
Flow Measurement Systems</B>
<P>
 The stack gas volumetric flow measurement system shall meet a
relative accuracy requirement of being less than or equal to 10
percent of the mean value of the reference method test data in
units of dscfh.  Relative accuracy is calculated  by the equations
in Section 8 of 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification
2.  The volumetric flow measurement system shall also meet the
specifications in Appendix B of these protocols.  The District
recommends (but does not require) performing a flow profile study
following the procedures in 40 CFR, Part 60, Appendix A, Test
Method 1.1, Section 2.5 to determine the acceptability of the
potential flow monitor location and to determine the number and
location of flow sampling points required to obtain a representative
flow value.

<B>11. Relative Accuracy Requirements for Emission Measurement</B>
<P>
 The emission measurement shall meet a relative accuracy requirement
of being less than or equal to 20 percent of the mean value of

TEST) of these protocols.
<P>
<B>13. Provisional Approval</B>
<P>
 The Facility Permit holder of a major source shall submit, certification
test results and supporting documents to the District for each
CEMS by December 31, 1994 for Cycle 1 facilities and June 30,
1995 for Cycle 2 facilities.  The Facility Permit holder shall
certify that the results show that the CEMS has met all the requirements
of the protocol if its submission is after August 31, 1994.  Upon
receipt of the test results and the certification that the CEMS
is in compliance, the District will issue a Provisional Approval.
<P>
 After the Provisional Approval, all the data measured and recorded
by the CEMS will be considered valid quality assured data, (retroactive
to January 1, 1995) provided that the Executive Officer does not
issue a notice of disapproval of final certification.  Final certification
of the CEMS will be granted if the certification test results
show that the CEMS has met all the requirements of the protocol.
<P>
 In the case where the test results show that the CEMS does not
meet all the requirements of the rule, the Executive Officer will
disapprove the final certification.  If this occurs, the previously
considered valid data from January 1, 1995 will be replaced by
data as specified in the &quot;Missing Data&quot; section of the
protocol.  This procedure shall be used until the time that new
certification test results are submitted, and the CEMS has received
final approval by the District.
<P>
<B>14. Sampling Location Requirements</B>
<P>
 Each affected piece of equipment shall have sampling locations
which meet the &quot;Guidelines for Construction of Sampling and
Testing Facilities&quot; in the District Source Test Manual. 
If an alternate location (not conforming to the criteria of eight
duct diameters downstream and two diameters upstream from a flow
disturbance) is used, the absence of flow disturbance shall be
demonstrated by using the District method in the Source Test Manual,
Chapter X, Section 1.4, or 40 CFR, Part 60, Appendix A, Method
1. Section 2.5 and the absence of stratification shall be demonstrated
using District method in the Source Test Manual, Chapter X, Section
13.
<P>
<B>15. Sampling Line Requirement</B>
<P>
  The CEMS sample line from the CEMS probe to the sample conditioning
system shall be heated to maintain the sample temperature above
the dew point of the sample.  This requirement does not apply
to dilution probe systems where no sample condensation occurs.
<P>
<B>16. Recertification Requirements</B>
<P>
 The District will reevaluate the monitoring systems at any affected
piece of equipment where changes to the basic process equipment
or air pollution control equipment occur, to determine the proper
full span range of the monitors.  Any monitor system requiring
change to its full span range in order to meet the criteria in
Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraph 8 shall be recertified according
to all the specifications in  Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraphs
10, 11, and 12 , as applicable, including the relative accuracy
tests, the calibration drift tests, and the calibration error
tests.  A new CEMS application shall be submitted for each CEMS
which is reevaluated.
<P>
 The recertification for any existing CEMS shall be completed
within 90 days of the start-up of newly changed or modified equipment
monitored by such CEMS.  The Facility Permit holder shall calculate
and report NOx emission data for the period prior to the CEMS
recertification by means of the automated data acquisition and
handling system according to the following procedures:
<P>
 a. For any CEMS which is recertified within 90 days of start-up
of the newly modified equipment, the emission data recorded by
the CEMS prior to the recertification would be considered valid
and shall be used for calculating and reporting NOx emissions
for the equipment it serves.
<P>
<I> </I>b. For any CEMS which is not recertified within 90 days
of start-up of the newly modified equipment, the 90th percentile
emission data (lbs per day) for the previous 90 unit operating
days recorded by the CEMS prior to the recertification shall be
used for calculating and reporting NOx emissions for the equipment
it serves.
<P>
<B>17. Quality Assurance Procedures for Analyzers</B>
<P>
  The quality assurance and quality control requirements for analyzers,
flow monitors, and NOx emission rate systems are given in  Attachment
C (QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES) of these
protocols.  The quality assurance plans required by Attachment
C of these protocols  shall be submitted along with the CEMS certification
application to the District for the approval of the Executive
Officer .  Source test and monitoring equipment inspection reports
required by the Protocols shall be kept on-site for at least three
years.  The reference method tests are those methods in Chapter
8 - Reference Methods of these protocols.  Any CEMS which is deemed
out-of-control by Attachment C of these protocols shall be corrected,
retested by the appropriate audit procedure, and restored to in-control
condition within 24 hours after being deemed out-of-control. 
If the CEMS is not in-control at the end of the 24-hour period,
the CEMS data shall be gathered using the methods in Chapter 2,
Subdivision B, Paragraph 6 and Chapter 2, Subdivision B, Paragraph
7 of these requirements or using the Missing Data Procedures in
Chapter 2 Subdivision E.  All data which is gathered in order
to comply with  Attachament C of these protocols shall be maintained
for three years and be made available to the Executive Officer
upon request.  Any such data which is invalidated shall be identified
and reasons provided for any data invalidation.  The nitrogen
oxides and oxygen monitors shall also meet the specifications
in  Attachment B (BIAS TEST) of these  protocols.

<P>
<B>  </B>Fuel flow measuring devices used for obtaining stack
flow in conjunction with F-factors shall be tested as installed
for relative accuracy using reference methods to determine stack
flow.
<P>
  If the flow device manufacturer has a method or device that
permits the fuel flow measuring device to be tested as installed
for relative accuracy, the Facility Permit holder shall request
approval from the Executive Officer.  Approval will be granted
in cases where the Facility Permit holder can demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Executive Officer that no suitable testing
location exists in the exhaust stacks or ducts and that it would
be an inordinate cost burden to modify the exhaust stack configuration
to provide a suitable testing location.  The method or device
used for relative accuracy testing shall be traceable to NIST
standards.  This method shall be used only if natural gas, fuel
oil, or other fuels which the Facility Permit holder can show
to the satisfaction of the Executive Officer have stable F-factors
and gross heating values, or if the Facility Permit holder measures
the F-factor and gross heating value of the fuel.

CHAPTER 6 - ALL SOURCES AND UNITS - DETERMINING SOURCE      CATEGORY
STATUS
<P>
A. Equipment Rating 96
<P>
B. Potential to Emit 98
<P>
C. Actual Heat Input 98
<P>
D. Loss of Categorization Status 98
<P>
All equipment are categorized by equipment rating, mass emissions
(i.e., potential to emit), and annual operating capacity (actual
heat input) as shown in tables 1-A, 1-B, and 1-C.  This chapter
prescribes the methodology for assessing equipment rating, potential
to emit, and actual heat input
<P>
The methodology for estimating mass emissions is described in
Chapter 2 (Major Sources), Chapter 3 (Large Sources), and Chapter
4 (Process Units.
<P>
A. Equipment Rating
<P>
For equipment to be categorized as major source, large source,
or NOx process unit, the Facility Permit holder shall demonstrate
that the affected equipment is within the range of the determined
category.  The following procedures are to be used in demonstrating
the category status:
<P>
1. To determine the heat input rating for boilers, furnaces, ovens,
dryers, heaters, incinerators, test cells, and all liquid and
gaseous fueled equipment:
<P>
a. Use the identification/rating plate permanently affixed to
the equipment on which the maximum heat input rating in Btu/hr
is displayed along with the serial and model numbers.  If not
available, then -
<P>
b. Determine the maximum heat input rating for the burner(s) from
specifications/data issued by the manufacturer, or by the burner
ID plate on the equipment.  If not available, then -
<P>
c. Calculate the maximum heat input rating by multiplying the
maximum hourly, fuel usage  and higher heating value of the fuel(s).
 If multiple fuels are burned then the fuel providing the highest
heat input rating must be used.  This approach must be used if
the equipment is capable of operating above the designed maximum
heat input rating, irrespective of Chapter 6, Subdivision A, Paragraphs
1, Subparagraphs a and b.
<P>
2. To determine the brake horsepower for internal combustion engines:
<P>
a. Use the identification/rating plate permanently affixed to
the internal combustion engine on which the rated brake horsepower
is specified by the manufacturer.  If not available, then -
<P>
b. Calculate the brake horsepower rating of an internal combustion
engine by multiplying the maximum fuel usage per minute, heating
value of fuel, equipment efficiency provided by the manufacturer
and the conversion factor (2545 Btu/bhp).
<P>
3. To determine process weight rating of kilns, calciners, and
other process equipment use the maximum total weight of all materials
introduced into any specific process, including solid fuels.
<P>
4. To determine megawatt or kilowatt ratings of turbines:
<P>
a. powering an electric generator
<P>
i. Use the identification/rating plate permanently affixed to
the turbine generator on which rating is displayed.  If not available,
then -
<P>
ii. Use the megawatt rating for turbines as determined by the
manufacturer's specification sheet.  If not available, then
<P>
iii. Calculate the turbine's power rating by dividing the fuel
capacity (Btu/hr) by the manufacturer's heat rate (Btu/kw-hr).
<P>
b. not powering an electric generator
<P>
i. use the identification/rating plate permanently affixed to
the trubine on which the shaft brake horsepower (bhp) is displayed.
 If not available, then -
<P>
ii. use the shaft bhp as determined by the manufacturer's specification
sheet, then -
<P>
iii. Calculate the turbine's power rating (kw) by multiplying
the shaft bhp by 0.67.
<P>
5. To determine annual heat input for  source-category determination:
<P>
  r 12
<P>
 H =  <TT>&eth;</TT> <TT>&eth;</TT> Djk x Vjk x 10-3         
  (Eq.40)
<P>
   j=1 k=1
<P>
  where:
<P>
  H = Annual heat input (billion Btu/yr).
<P>
  Djk = The monthly fuel usage (mmscf/mo,        mmgal/mo, mmlb/mo,
mmbbl/mo)
<P>
  Vjk = The higher heating value for each         type of fuel:
<P>
  j = Each type of fuel
<P>
  k = Each monthly period
<P>
  r = The number of different types of fuel
<P>
B. Potential to Emit
<P>
 The potential to emit means the amount of pollutants calculated
(1) using a calendar monthly average and (2) on a pound-per-day
basis from permit conditions which directly limit the emissions
or, when no such conditions are imposed from:
<P>
(1) the maximum rated capacity; and
<P>
(2) the maximum daily hours of operation; and
<P>
(3) the physical characteristics of the materials processed.
<P>
C. Actual Heat Input
<P>
 The actual heat input is the measured fuel usage multiplied by
the heat content of the fuel.
<P>
D. Loss of Categorization Status
<P>
 On and after January 1, 1995 for Cycle 1 facilities and July
1, 1995 for Cycle 2 facilities, any Facility Permit holder who
has elected to change the category of any equipment from a major
to a large source or a large source to a process unit based on
the level of fuel usage or hours of operation, shall monitor and
record the annual fuel usage or hours of operation for that equipment.
<P>
(1) If the fuel usage or hours of operation exceed the levels
specified for that equipment at the end of any RECLAIM compliance
year, the Facility Permit holder of a large source shall:
<P>
(i) Within 1 month from the end of the compliance year, submit
a Monitoring, Reporting and Recordkeeping (MRR) plan specifying
the use of CEMS and any preliminary data, and
<P>
(ii) Within one year from the end of the compliance year, comply
with the major source requirements specified in Rule 2012.
<P>
2. If the fuel usage or hours of operation exceed the levels specified
for that equipment at the end of any RECLAIM compliance year,
the Facility Permit holder of a process unit shall:
<P>
(i) Within 1 month from the end of the compliance year, submit
a Monitoring, Reporting, and Recordkeeping (MRR) plan that specifies
the concentration limit or elects for an emission rate, and
<P>
(ii) Within 3 months from the end of the compliance year, comply
with the large source requirements specified in Rule 2012.

<P>
i. Software Context and Data Flow Diagrams
<P>
 The flow diagram at the end of this Chapter is a Context Diagram
description and Data Flow Diagram which show how the different
external functions tie to the RTU package. Plant data or operating
information is collected by the emission monitoring system for
evaluation of emissions.  The RTU Unit is the process shown on
this diagram and is the focus of this guideline. 
<P>
 Data Values relating to emissions received from the emission
monitoring system are processed by the RTU into data files for
transmission to the SCAQMD Central Station.  The type of message
is shown on the RTU Context Diagram between the RTU and the Central
Station.  The message is data sets which are sent periodically.
<P>
 The RTU Data Flow Diagram is a graphical expansion of the RTU
Unit process block. Emission monitoring system data is shown coming
into the Network Driver and splitting to the other process blocks
which represent RTU functions.
<P>
ii. Communication End Points
<P>
 The RTU will communicate with  both the emission monitoring system
and the Central Station.  Each end point has a different protocol
and purpose. Data sent from the RTU to the Central Station shall
be converted from floating point numbers used to perform calculations
into ASCII standard to allow for different internal formats.
<P>
f. Specific Requirements
<P>
i. RTU Software
<P>
 The main RTU program shall receive input data, do calculations
(if necessary) and store all data in non-volatile memory, as it
is  received.
<P>
ii. Direct Field Input Data
<P>
 Many RTUs may be capable of reading direct field inputs which
shall consist of analog and/or digital real values.  Direct field
input requirements shall be specified as required for each RTU.
 Communications software shall be capable of supporting the hardware
required to receive these inputs.  If analog data cards must be
installed in the RTU any resulting  values provided to the RTU
data bus shall range from -32768 to +32767 for unscaled values.
 The same accuracy as emission monitoring system network data
shall be provided for analog data values scaled on the I/O device
before going onto the RTU data bus.
<P>
iii. Input Data Conversion/Storage
<P>
 All input values shall be stored in as received ASCII format.
 These values shall then be parsed and converted to real numbers
for calculations and averaging.iv. Output Data To Central Station
<P>
 The context diagram displays how the RTU software shall be configured
to allow  messages to be sent to the Central Station.  File transfer
for all messages shall be in ASCII format including a bitsum check
value with a return acknowledgment expected by the RTU when the
Central Station has verified the bitsum check.
<P>
v. RTU To Central Station Communications Failure
<P>
 If the RTU cannot communicate with the Central Station the main
program shall  store all calculated values and reports in a special
file in non-volatile memory.  These special files shall be labeled
to show that they have not been acknowledged as received by the
Central Station.
<P>
g. Performance Requirements
<P>
i. Speed of Receiving DATA
<P>
 Incoming data from the plant or emission monitoring system shall
be received at intervals specified in the appropriate emission
monitoring guideline. Communication with the Central Station,
Parsing, verification, storage and checking shall not block the
receipt of new data.
<P>
ii. RTU Non-Volatile Memory
<P>
 The RTU non-volatile memory shall have enough capacity to store
all programs, data parameters, emission monitoring system input
data and calculated data averages.  Input data and calculated
averages shall be allocated space using the first in first out
(FIFO) method to store the quantity of data as required.
<P>
h. Design Restraints
<P>
i. Data Set Formats
<P>
 Section (D) indicates the data format that is to be sent to the
Central Station at scheduled intervals.  The Central Station will
send a confirmation message back for each transmission received
which will consist of an identification number unique to the Central
Station and a transaction number which is sequentially issued.

<P>
i. RTU External Interface Requirements
<P>
i. Central Station Interface
<P>
 External interface to the RTU is shown on the Context Diagram
at the end of this chapter. Central Station interface is described
above as fixed format ASCII messages using a commercially available
communication software package.  In return the Central Station
will send confirmation messages in ASCII form when a satisfactory

</OL>
(c) Definitions
<P>
For the purpose of this rule, the following definitions apply:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>ADMINISTERING DISTRICT is a district that adopts equivalent
provisions to those contained in subdivisions (c), (d), (e), (f),
(g), (h), (i), (j), and (k) of this rule for one or more of the
equipment categories listed in subdivision (b) of this rule, and
the participating district at which the owner or operator of a
portable emissions unit files an application for registration.
 A district can be an administering district only for the equipment
categories for which it has adopted the requirements contained
in this rule.
<P>
<LI>AQMD means South Coast Air Quality Management District.
<P>
<LI>DISTRICT is an air pollution control district or air quality
management district duly organized under the applicable provisions
of California Health and Safety Code.
<P>
<LI>DUST-TIGHT means free from visible airborne dust.
<P>
<LI>EMISSIONS UNIT is an identifiable process, operation, or
piece of process equipment such as an article, machine, or other
contrivance, which emits or may emit, or results in the emissions
of any air contaminant directly or as fugitive emissions.  For
the purpose of this rule, each internal combustion engine constitutes
a separate emissions unit.
<P>
<LI>EXEMPT COMPOUNDS are defined in AQMD Rule 102 -- Definition
Of Terms.
<P>
<LI>FACILITY means any one or more contiguous or adjacent properties.
 Contiguous or adjacent properties are properties with two or
more parcels of land in actual physical contact, separated solely
by a public roadway or other public right-of-way under the same
or common ownership or control.
<P>
<LI>FUGITIVE DUST means any solid particulate matter that becomes
airborne, other than that emitted from an exhaust stack, directly
or indirectly as a result of the activities of man.
<P>
<LI>LOCATION means any single
site at a building, structure, facility, or installation.  For
the purpose of this definition, a site is a space occupied or
to be occupied by an emissions unit.  For emissions units which
are brought to a facility to perform maintenance on equipment
at its permanent or ordinary location, each maintenance site shall
be a separate location.
<P>
<LI>NONROAD ENGINE is
a portable engine that requires a permit and is certified by the
Executive Officer or designee to be a nonroad engine as defined
by U. S. EPA pursuant to 40 CFR Part 89.
<P>
<LI>PARTICIPATING DISTRICT is any district that, through rulemaking,
agrees to give effect and enforce registrations issued by an administering
district.  A participating district may choose to recognize registrations
for one or more of the equipment categories listed in subdivision
(b).
<P>
<LI>PORTABLE EMISSIONS UNIT is any emissions unit that, by itself
or in or on a piece of equipment, is designed to be and capable
of being carried or moved from one location to another.  Indications
of portability include, but are not limited to, wheels, skids,
carrying handles, dolly, trailer, platform or mounting.  The owner
or operator must demonstrate the necessity of the unit being periodically
moved from one location to another because of the nature of the
operation.
<P>
  An emissions unit is not portable if:
<P>
  (A) the emissions unit or its replacement remains or will reside
at the same location for more than 12 consecutive months.  Any
emissions unit, such as a back-up or stand-by unit, that replaces
an emissions unit at a location and is intended to perform the
same function as the unit being replaced, will be included in
calculating the consecutive time period.  In that case, the cumulative
time of both emissions units, including the time between the removal
of the original unit and installation of the replacement unit,
would be counted toward the consecutive time period; or
<P>
  (B) the emissions unit remains or will reside at a location
for less than 12 consecutive months where such a period represents
the full length of normal annual source operations such as a seasonal
source; or
<P>
  (C) the emissions unit is removed from one location for a period
and then it or its equivalent is returned to the same location
in an attempt to circumvent the portable emissions unit residence
time requirements.
<P>
  The period during which the emissions unit is maintained at
a storage facility shall be excluded from the residency time determination.
<P>
<LI>PROJECT means one or more registered portable emissions unit(s)
operated at a facility under the same or common ownership or control,
and used to perform a single activity.
<P>
<LI>VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND (VOC) is any volatile compound
of carbon, excluding methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
carbonic acid, metallic carbides or carbonates, ammonium carbonate
and exempt compounds.
<P>
</OL>
(d) Registration Process:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The owner or operator of a portable emissions unit may elect
to register the unit pursuant to the provisions of this rule or
permit it pursuant to AQMD Regulation II - Permits.
<P>
<LI>Upon registration in accordance with the provisions of this
subdivision the following existing AQMD rule provisions will no
longer apply to the portable emissions unit:  Regulation II -
Permits (with the exception of Rules 206, 207, 209, 214, 216,
and 217), Regulation IV - Prohibitions, Regulation XI - Source
Specific Standards (with the exception of Rule 1110.2 on or after
December 31, 1999), Regulation XIII - New Source Review, and Regulation
XIV - Toxics And Other Non-Criteria Pollutants.  This rule shall
supersede the requirements of Rule 209 - Transfer And Voiding
Of Permits and Rule 1110.2 - Emissions From Gaseous- And Liquid-Fueled
Internal Combustion Engines, where this rule and those rules are
found to be in conflict.
<P>
<LI>Upon approval of the registration pursuant to this rule or
an equivalent rule by any participating district, the existing
permit for the registered portable emissions unit granted by the
AQMD will expire.
<P>
<LI>If the owner or operator of a portable emissions unit elects
to apply for registration of the emissions unit, the owner or
operator shall apply for registration at any time after December
7, 1995.
<P>
<LI>If the owner or operator of a portable emissions unit elects
to apply for registration of the emissions unit, the owner or
operator shall apply for registration at the participating district
in which the portable emissions unit is located at the time the
application for registration is filed.  If the equipment is located
outside the state of California, or in a non-participating district,
the owner or operator shall register at the participating district
where the equipment will first be operated after registration.
 
<P>
<LI>The applicant shall submit, along with the application, the
following:
<P>
  (A) all necessary engineering data, emissions test data, or
manufacturer's guarantee to demonstrate compliance with the requirements
as specified in subdivision (e) of this rule; and
<P>
  (B) for engines, documentation from the engine manufacturer
specifying the engine manufacture date, or a copy of the permit
to operate that was granted by any district in California prior
to July 18, 1994.
<P>
<LI>No registration may be issued until the Executive Officer
or designee has conducted an onsite inspection of the emissions
unit, or has determined that the emissions unit is in compliance
with the requirements of this rule through survey of records.
<P>
<LI>The Executive Officer or designee shall issue registration,
deny registration, or deem the application incomplete, if the
emissions unit is made available for inspection upon request or
its compliance can be determined through a survey of records,
according to the following schedule:
<P>
(A) Within 90 days of receipt of an application for registration
received within 6 months after December 7, 1995; and
<P>
(B) Within 30 days of receipt of an application for registration
received after 6 months after December 7, 1995
<P>
<LI>The applicant may deem an application for registration denied,
and appeal such denial to the District Hearing Board pursuant
to AQMD Rule 216 - Appeals, if the Executive Officer or designee
has failed to either approve or deny the application for registration
within the time period specified in paragraph (d)(8).
<P>
<LI>No later than 10 days after issuance of a registration,
the Executive Officer or designee shall forward to all participating
districts a copy of the registration and, upon request by any
participating district, a copy of the application for registration.
<P>
<LI>The owner or operator of a registered emission unit may
operate the unit within the boundaries of any participating district
if the unit is operated in compliance with all applicable requirements
in that district's equivalent rule.
<P>
<LI>The Executive Officer or designee shall renew the registration
for a portable emission unit registered in the AQMD on an annual
basis provided that the registration is valid according to applicable
AQMD rules.  Pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 42333,
renewal may be denied for non-compliance with the following:
<P>
  (A) state laws or regulations;
<P>
  (B) this rule and registration conditions when operated in the
AQMD;
<P>
  (C) an equivalent rule at a participating district when operated
in that district.

</FONT></B>1997 Air Quality Management Plan</H1>
<P>The South Coast Air Quality Management District (District) is releasing
this draft 1997 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) for public comment.
The District invites feedback and further input from all members of the
greater South Coast community on this proposed revision to our region's
clean air plan. To further encourage comment, our Governing Board will
be hosting a number of regional workshops throughout the Basin, as well
as at District headquarters in Diamond Bar, during the month of September <A HREF="/pub_edu/pwaqmp.html">(see workshop schedules)</A>.
</P>

<P>This AQMP puts greater focus on a pollutant found to be newly important
in the South Coast region: fine particulate matter (PM<FONT SIZE=2.5>10</FONT>). Recent
findings by nationally recognized health experts show that PM<FONT SIZE=2.5>10 </FONT>may
be responsible for significant adverse health effects for Southern Californians,
including premature death and disabling respiratory impairments. This draft
1997 AQMP represents the first plan addressing Clean Air Act requirements
to demonstrate attainment of federal PM<FONT SIZE=2.5>10</FONT> ambient air quality
standards. </P>

<P>A comprehensive Plan such as this is built on the contributions of many.
In addition to those individuals and groups, the advisory support of the
PM<FONT SIZE=2.5>10 </FONT>Task Force is acknowledged as a vital component in this
Plan's strategy development effort. This Task Force first met in June 1995
as a gathering of agency, government, industry, academia, and organizational
representatives. Over many months, participants held critical discussions
and reviewed findings of the latest technical and scientific studies available
on particulate pollution. Their efforts are reflected in the completeness
of the attainment strategies presented here. </P>

<P>This draft Plan also reflects the combined technical and policy inputs
of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the state Air Resources
Board (ARB), and the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG).
</P>

<P>Air quality monitoring records of recent years have proven the effectiveness
of our Basin's ongoing pollution control efforts. The collaborative spirit
that has been present as this Plan has been in development will help us
achieve the proper balance of our need for clean air with our need for
a strong economy, and assure that residents and visitors alike will breathe
healthful air by the year 2010. </P>


<P>
The Plan has an Executive Summary,  10 chapters,  and a Glossary.   To download or view sections of the Plan in Microsoft Word 6.0,  click on the appropriate icon below or view the section in html version.</P>

<P>The South Coast Air Quality Management District (District) has scheduled a series of public workshops to discuss the draft proposed <B>1997 revisions to the Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP)</B>.  </P>
<P>The draft 1997 AQMP addresses the PM10 State Implementation Plan (SIP) requirements of the federal Clean Air Act for the South Coast Air Basin.  (PM10 is small particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter.)  The draft 1997 AQMP is designed to meet both state and federal Clean Air Act requirements for all areas under District jurisdiction, including the South Coast Air Basin, the Los Angeles County portion of the Mojave Air Basin (Antelope Valley), and the Riverside County portion of the Salton Sea Air Basin (including the Coachella Valley).  It addresses all criteria pollutants, including PM10, ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide.</P>
<P>The draft 1997 AQMP is based upon comments and inputs on the 1994 AQMP, from numerous task forces and working groups (including the PM10 Task Force), AQMP Public Consultation Meetings, and public meetings with the regulated community, various interest groups, and other public agencies.  The draft 1997 AQMP is jointly prepared with the Southern California Association of Governments.  The California Air Resources Board provided input on the statewide consumer products, pesticides, and mobile source control strategy proposed in the draft 1997 AQMP.  </P>
<P>
<B>Issues</B></P>
<P>The draft 1997 AQMP includes new information on key elements such as:</P>
<UL>
<P><LI>current air quality, including special particulate data from the PM10  Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP);</P>
<P><LI>Improved emission inventories, especially for motor vehicles, solvent usage, fugitive dust, and ammonia sources;</P>
<P><LI>A similar, but fine-tuned overall control strategy with continuing emphasis on flexible, alternative approaches, including intercredit trading;</P>
<P><LI>A determination that certain control measures contained in the 1994 AQMP are infeasible, most notably future indirect source measures;</P>
<P><LI>Enhanced modeling for particulates;</P>
<P><LI>Separate analyses for the desert portions within the District&#146;s jurisdiction (the Antelope and Coachella Valleys)</P>
<P><LI>Amendments to the federal Post-1996 Rate-of-Progress Plan and the Federal Attainment Plans for ozone and carbon monoxide;</P>
<P><LI>A Maintenance Plan for nitrogen dioxide; and</P>
<P><LI>An attainment demonstration and State Implementation Plan Revision for PM10.</P>
</UL>
<P>You are invited to participate in the AQMP development process.  Your involvement is essential in building an innovative and technically-sound Plan that draws on the talents of the individual, business, the public sector, and nonprofit organizations.  Please take time to attend one or more of the seven scheduled meetings and share your ideas and comments about how to clean up our polluted air.</P>
<P><B>TO OBTAIN COPIES OF </B><B>DOCUMENTS</B></P>
<P>Copies of the draft 1997 AQMP will be available on or shortly after August 6, 1996 and may be obtained from:</P>

for the Following Rule:
<P>
Amend Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen and<BR>
Oxides of Sulfur (Leyden)
<P>
<I>Rule 2015(c)(3) requires that the Executive Officer perform
a technology review for petroleum coke calciners.  The review
has been completed and the Executive Officer has found that an
increase to the year 2000 emission factor is appropriate.  This
will result in an increase of approximately 0.13 ton per day in
the year 2000 allocation.  To change RECLAIM NOx allocations,
the Rule 2002 emission factor for calciners is proposed for amendment
from 0.61 to 0.84 pound of NOx per ton of calcined coke.  The
necessary CEQA documents will be included in the final board package.</I>

<I>Marine vessels (i.e., ocean-going and harbor vessels) represent
a source of pollutant emissions in the South Coast Air Basin (Basin).
 During the 1994 AQMP adoption process, issues were raised relative
to existing emissions inventories developed by the AQMD, ARB,
and port representatives.  In order to resolve these issues and
improve estimates of the contribution of marine vessels to the
Basin's overall inventory, a more detailed study of the emissions
from marine vessels is warranted.</I>

of these compounds is consistent with the state risk management
guidelines for toxics new source review and will improve the coordination
of the AQMD's toxics program with the federal program.  This item
is continued from the April 1994 Board meeting.  As requested
by the Board at that meeting, staff has performed additional analysis
of the small business impacts of the proposed amendments.</I>

 4. Minutes of December 9, 1994 Board Meeting
<P>
 Jackie Dix, Clerk of the Board, noted a correction to the motion
on page 10 of the Minutes, copies of which were distributed to
Board members and made available to the public.  Mr. Braude, who
seconded the motion referenced, concurred with the correction.
<P>
11. Recommendation Regarding Board Member Assistance
<P>
 In view of the Board's increasing rhetoric on its concern about
the impact of clean air regulations on small and large businesses,
and the lay-off in 1994 of many AQMD employees, <BR>
Dr. Wilson and Mr. Braude expressed opposition to spending $300,000
worth of AQMD funds, which come from fees paid by businesses,
to provide administrative support and assistance to Board members.
<P>
(Mr. Antonovich arrived at 9:55 a.m.)
<P>
 Dr. Burke expressed opposition to the recommendation as well,
although for a different reason.  He was not supportive of language
in the Board Member assistance contracts which would give the
District--not Board Members--ultimate authority to terminate the
contracts without cause.  <U>He also stressed the importance of
administrative assistance for those Board members who do not have
such assistance provided by their respective cities or counties.</U>
<P>
MR. ALBRIGHT MOVED TO CONTINUE AGENDA ITEM NO. 11 TO THE FEBRUARY
10, 1995 BOARD MEETING, AND REFER THE ITEM TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE

Transportation &amp; Information Management, indicated staff's
intent to obtain input from the appropriate Board committee to
insure that the criteria to be evaluated is consistent with Board
policy.
<P>
21. Report Regarding Whether AQMD Can Establish Endorsement Program
<P>
 Dr. Burke indicated his agreement with staff that the AQMD cannot
endorse individual products, but it can--and does--conduct certification
programs.
<P>
MR. PAULITZ MOVED TO APPROVE AGENDA ITEMS NO. 4 (WITH THE CORRECTION
STATED BELOW), NO. 15 AND NO. 21 AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.
<P>
<I><B>The motion passed by the Board regarding Agenda Item No.
31 on pages 10 and 11 of the Minutes of the December 9, 1994 Board
meeting was corrected to replace paragraphs (a) through (c) with
paragraphs (a) through (e), as follows:</B></I>
<P>
(a) REQUEST THE EPA TO TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO APPROVE THE
CALIFORNIA STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (SIP), INCLUDING DELAYING
PROMULGATION OF A FIP IF FINAL ACTION ON THE SIP IS NOT TAKEN
BY FEBRUARY 15, 1995;
<P>
(b) REQUEST THAT THE EPA COMMIT TO THE AGGRESSIVE NATIONAL REGULATION
OF THOSE SOURCES OVER WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SOLE JURISDICTION
OF WHICH ARE BEST REGULATED ON A NATIONAL LEVEL, AS OUTLINED IN
THE CALIFORNIA SIP.  IF THESE POLICIES ARE ADOPTED THE FEDERAL
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (FIP) WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED;
<P>
(c) REQUEST LOCAL GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING SCHOOL BOARDS WITHIN THE
SCAQMD TO ADOPT A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE SIP;
<P>
(d) REQUEST THAT, IF A FIP IS ULTIMATELY PROMULGATED, EPA SHOULD
AMEND IT TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ITS ADVERSE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA;
AND
<P>
(e) STRONGLY URGE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING SCHOOL BOARDS,
WITHIN THE SCAQMD TO ADOPT A RESOLUTION OPPOSING THOSE PORTIONS
OF THE FIP THAT WOULD HAVE UNACCEPTABLE ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND SUPPORTING
THE BOARD'S ACTION, AND URGING THE EPA TO EXAMINE OTHER ALTERNATIVES
THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE SCAQMD AS REDUCING THE SUM TOTAL
OF AIR POLLUTION.
<P>
THE MOTION TO APPROVE AGENDA ITEMS NO. 4 (AS CORRECTED), NO. 15
AND NO. 21 AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF WAS SECONDED BY MR. ALBRIGHT,

<P>
27. Discussion Regarding the Use of the Voting Machine
<P>
 Chairman Mikels opened discussion on whether or not the Board
preferred to continue casting votes using the existing voting
machine, or to cast votes by roll call instead.  Speaking in support
of using the voting machine, Mr. Paulitz pointed out that it takes
significantly more time with roll call voting; and Mr. Braude
commented that from his experience, having everyone cast their
vote at the same time with the voting machine is far more democratic
than roll call voting.
<P>
MR. PAULITZ MOVED TO CONTINUE USING THE VOTING MACHINE AS THE
PREFERRED METHOD OF CASTING VOTES.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY
DR. WILSON.
<P>
 Mr. Antonovich expressed support of continued use of the voting
machine, but only if the machine could be re-programmed so that
each individual Board member's vote would instantly be displayed
on-screen; rather than displaying the votes all at the same time
after all Board members have cast their votes.  Executive Officer
James Lents indicated that the voting machine could be re-programmed
in whatever manner the Board preferred.
<P>
MR. ANTONOVICH MADE A SUBSTITUTE MOTION TO USE THE VOTING MACHINE,
RE-PROGRAMMED TO ALLOW INSTANTANEOUS DISPLAY OF VOTES AS THE VOTES
ARE CAST BY EACH BOARD MEMBER, AS THE PREFERRED METHOD OF CASTING
VOTES.  THE MOTION WAS DULY SECONDED, AND PASSED BY THE FOLLOWING
VOTE:
<P>
AYES: Albright, Antonovich, Burke, Haggard, Lee, Mikels, Silva
and Soto.
<P>
NOES: Braude, Paulitz and Wilson.
<P>
ABSENT: None.
<P>
 Chairman Mikels directed staff to have the voting machine re-programmed
before the February 10, 1995 Board meeting.
<P>

Paulitz, Silva, Wilson and Soto.
<P>
NOES: None.
<P>

<P>
17. Rule Forecast Report
<P>
 Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, gave a summary
review of the Rule Forecast Report, a standard item on the Board
meeting agenda each month.  Ms. Leyden provided background information
on development of the Report which, at the beginning of each year,
sets forth the calendar of rules scheduled for consideration during
the year, and is updated each month to reflect any changes.
<P>
A UNANIMOUS VOTE WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT TO RECEIVE
AND FILE AGENDA ITEM NO. 17 AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.
<P>
<U><B>PUBLIC HEARINGS</B></U>
<P>
28. Amend Rule 1401 - New Source Review of Toxic Air Contaminants
<P>
 The staff report was given by Mohsen Nazemi, Senior Manager/Stationary
Source Compliance.  Copies of the following were distributed to
Board members and made available to the public:  (i) Changes to
Proposed Amended Rule 1401 Since April 1994;  (ii) Revisions For
Agenda Item #28 (minor language clarification, correction of a
typographical error, and three new items to be included in the
adopting Resolution);  and (iii) a letter dated January 12, 1995
to <BR>
Dr. Lents from James D. Boyd, Executive Officer of the California
Air Resources Board, supporting adoption of Proposed Amended Rule
1401.
<P>
 The public hearing was opened.  Prior to hearing public testimony,
the following concerns were expressed by Board members:
<P>
 Ms. Lee and Ms. Soto expressed concern about the economic impact
the proposed amended rule would have on small businesses.  Ms.
Leyden commented that the socioeconomic analysis presumes the
worst possible scenario, and the actual impact to the affected
sources would be much less than staff's estimate of approximately
$ 4 million and loss of between 70 and 200 jobs per year.
<P>
 In response to Ms. Soto, Ms. Leyden indicated that staff already
provides source education classes and information on the District's
loan guarantee program to small businesses.  Therefore, staff
was agreeable to preparing a statement to that effect for inclusion
in the resolution for this rule amendment, and in the resolutions
for future adoptions and amendments of all District rules.
<P>
 Mr. Braude and Mr. Antonovich expressed concern that staff was
not figuring in the costs to facilities for compliance with other
District rules, such as Rule 1421 (for dry cleaners) and Rule
1153 (for bakeries).
<P>
 Mr. Albright questioned the need for the AQMD to adopt regulations
for these compounds listed in the proposed amendment before adoption
of the federal air toxics program.  Ms. Leyden responded that
if the same compounds that will be required to be regulated are
placed in Rule 1401, staff believes a strong equivalency argument
can be made that will let the AQMD's BACT (Best Available Control
Technology) process basically drive the definition for compliance
with the federal regulations.
<P>
 Copies of the following Amendment to the Board Resolution for
Rule 1401 - New Source Review for Toxic Air Contaminants were
distributed to Board members and made available to the public:
<P>
<I>&quot;WHEREAS, the Board of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District directs staff to develop source education classes for
all small businesses and provide information regarding the AQMD's
low interest loan guarantee program to each small business.&quot;</I>
<P>
 The above Amendment was revised by Ms. Soto as follows, because
she felt it was not sufficient to just provide information; but
that staff should help the businesses in understanding also:
<P>
<I>&quot; . . . and provide <U>assistance</U> <U>and</U> information
regarding . . .&quot;</I>
<P>
 Chairman Mikels announced that the Board would recess for lunch,
during which time the Board would also take up Agenda Item No.
31 - Closed Session.
<P>
<U><B>CLOSED SESSION</B></U>
<P>
31. Recommendation Regarding a Closed Session to Consider Pending
and/or Potential Litigation and Personnel Matters
<P>
 The Board recessed to closed session at 12:00 p.m., pursuant
to Government Code Section 54956.9 (a), to confer with legal counsel

 Overwhelming support of Proposed Amended Rule (PAR) 1401 was
expressed by representatives of the various industries and the
sanitation districts, which was attributed to AQMD staff's efforts
to meet with industry representatives and develop revisions and
clarifications to the proposed amended rule to address many of
their concerns.  Although there were still concerns outstanding,
the consensus of the represented industries was that the changes
proposed in PAR 1401's list of toxic compounds were inevitable;
and to a large degree dictated by federal and state mandates.
 Representatives of CARB and Cal EPA encouraged the Board to adopt
the proposed amendments to help insure statewide consistency in
the management of air toxics and air toxic risk assessments.
<P>
 Mr. Olson expressed opposition to the proposed rule amendment
with respect to solvent degreasing.  Staff defines T-BACT for
degreasers as a carbon adsorption system, which has been disclaimed
by EPA, primarily because of the high cost (up to $250,000) and
cross-media implications.  He believed that staff's estimate that
90 percent of degreasing can be accomplished by aqueous cleaning
is overly optimistic; and added that in March 1995, there will
be new effluent guidelines issued by USEPA which will result in
those who have switched over to aqueous cleaning being faced with
further regulatory concerns.
<P>
 Messrs. Laird, Solganik and Levy expressed support of the proposed
amended rule, contingent upon the following revisions:
<P>
<U>SMALL BUSINESS COALITION OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA</U>
<P>
 Addition of the following language in PAR 1401:
<P>
<U>(g)(4) Hazard Index Limit Exemption<BR>
<BR>
<U>The hazard index limit of 1.0 in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3)
shall not apply provided that the permit unit is constructed with
T-BACT and the cumulative total acute and chronic hazard index
levels, as specified in (d)(2) and (d)(3), do not exceed 3.0 at
any receptor location.  This exemption shall not apply to permit
applications received after January 13, 1998.</U></U>

<P>
 <U>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Governing Board of the AQMD
does hereby direct staff to monitor the permit actions taken on
applications that were subject to Proposed Amended Rule 1401 and
which would have exceeded the cumulative total acute or chronic
hazard index of 1.0 as specified in paragraphs (d)(2) or (d)(3),
and submit a report to the Board by June 1, 1997 describing such
permit actions.</U>

 Page 4 of the Governing Board resolution to include:
<P>
 <U>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Governing Board of the AQMD
does hereby direct staff not to require T-BACT on nickel plating
tanks for a period of at least one year from the date of adoption
of Amended Rule 1401 in order to allow additional time to further
evaluate impacts due to emissions from nickel plating, including
particle size and deposition rate.</U>
<P>
 Ms. Leyden indicated staff's agreement to including the language
proposed by the Small Business Coalition and the Metal Finishing
Association.
<P>
 There was extensive discussion, prompted by concern expressed
by Mr. Benvenuti and Mr. Stafford, regarding the use of ethylene
glycol monobutyl ether (EGBE), the main coalescent solvent used
in water-based coatings by a majority of the coating manufacturers
in the United States.  Mr. Stafford pointed out that AQMD regulations
have for approximately five years been moving the furniture manufacturing
industry toward the use of waterborne coatings, and it would be
a tremendous burden on the industry if they had to reformulate,
change over their operations, and re-train personnel.  Mr. Benvenuti
pointed out that EGBE is contained in many common household products,
and is the least hazardous of all the ethylene glycols on the
list of hazardous compounds.
<P>
 Staff's response was that this same issue was raised in the public
hearing on Rule 1136.  Staff did a specific study of industry
transition to the use of EGBE in waterborne paints, and found
that approximately 10 to 12 percent of the products used in the
industry were being switched over to these paints.  Staff also
found that there were other product alternatives that were being
developed without containing EGBE.  The other issue is that the
furniture industry is a classic example of an industry which the
AQMD is proposing to include in VOC RECLAIM.  Under the concept
of that program, the very low gram-per-liter targets are relaxed
so that the industry may move within an emission bubble with freedom
between product choices.  In addition, staff's position was that
reformulation of coatings, as well as installation of ovens necessitated
by changeover to compliance coatings, would not constitute a modification.
<P>
 Ms. Wolf supported adoption of the proposed rule amendment, but
requested the removal of the exemption for film cleaning.  Production
of the solvent used for cleaning movie film, 1, 1, 1 Tricholoroethane
(TCA), will be banned on January 1, 1996 because it contributes
to stratospheric ozone depletion.  An alternative hydrofluorocarbon
(HFC) was recently tested at Technicolor, one of the largest film
production laboratories, and the HFC performed as well as TCA.
<P>
 Speaking in support of the exemption for film cleaning machines,
Mr. Rohrman emphasized that the exemption requires T-BACT and
investigation of alternatives, and specifies a finite risk increase
for a finite three-year period.  While the HFC previously referred
to does show promise, that product, as well as other alternatives,
are not yet commercially-available and Deluxe Laboratories has
not been given the opportunity to test these alternatives.

on behalf of Metal Finishing Association of Southern California
<P>
(Mr. Paulitz left at 2:00 p.m. and Mr. Braude left at approximately
2:15 p.m., during public testimony.)
<P>
 Ms. Soto suggested, in view of the questions and concerns raised
by Board members as well as in consideration of new Board members,
that the public hearing be postponed for one month.
<P>
 Dr. Wilson expressed his belief that government closest to the
people develop the best rules and regulations through the involvement
of the public and affected industries in the process, and that
the AQMD should not wait for state or federal regulations before
adopting its own.
<P>
DR. WILSON MOVED TO ADOPT THE RESOLUTION AMENDING RULE 1401 AND
CERTIFYING THE FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, WITH THE FOLLOWING
MODIFICATIONS, AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF:
<P>
<U>(g)(4) Hazard Index Limit Exemption<BR>
<BR>
<U>The hazard index limit of 1.0 in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3)
shall not apply provided that the permit unit is constructed with
T-BACT and the cumulative total acute and chronic hazard index

<P>
THE MOTION BY DR. WILSON DIED FOR LACK OF A SECOND.
<P>
MR. ANTONOVICH MOVED TO DENY THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION.  THE MOTION
WAS SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD.
<P>
 Mr. Albright asked staff if, in denying the staff recommendation
and leaving Rule 1401 as it presently exists, would the District
be avoiding any state or federal mandates.
<P>
 Mr. Greenwald responded that there are requirements in state
law for local agencies to adopt new source review programs for
toxics which comply with federal law and the state laws.  The
federal law basically requires MACT (maximum achievable control
technology) to be implemented for any new source or modification
after the Title V Program is approved, which is expected for Fall
1995.  Therefore, if the Board does not adopt PAR 1401, staff
does not have an argument that the District is complying with
that requirement and would have to comply on a more ad hoc basis.
 However, staff has not received any certification from EPA yet
that PAR 1401 would comply with that federal requirement.
<P>
 Mr. Mikels suggested that if the motion to deny the staff recommendation
did pass, perhaps staff could examine the concerns expressed during
the public hearing and bring a revised proposal back to the Board
at its February 10, 1995 Board meeting.
<P>
DR. WILSON MADE A SUBSTITUTE MOTION TO CONTINUE THE PUBLIC HEARING
ON PROPOSED AMENDED RULE 1401 TO THE FEBRUARY 10, 1995 BOARD MEETING,
AND TO DIRECT STAFF TO EXAMINE THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED DURING THE
PUBLIC HEARING AND BRING A RECOMMENDATION BACK TO THE BOARD AT
THE FEBRUARY 10 BOARD MEETING.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS.
SOTO.
<P>
 Mr. Albright commented that the substitute motion should provide
clear direction to staff as to the Board's intent.  His opposition
to the rule was with the technical aspects such as risk assessments.
<P>
 Mr. Antonovich urged Board members to deny the staff recommendation,
and not continue the public hearing to February.  District staff
could then work in a constructive manner with the public and private
sectors to develop a responsible rule amendment, whether it be
within 30 days or 60 days.
<P>
 Mr. Mikels expressed concern regarding existing sources which
are not presently affected by Rule 1401, but have to change their
product to water-based coatings; and once that changeover is made,
the sources become subject to Rule 1401 requirements with which
they will not be able to comply.  He raised the issue that the
hazard index or risk assessment number being set for new sources
is different than the level for existing sources.  Also new Board
members have not had exposure to the depth of the discussion at
past Board meetings, including scientific debate with regard to
the basis for risk assessment standards.  In addition, the Board
needs to know exactly what mandates the AQMD faces with regard
to Rule 1401--what is and is not required, when is anything required,
if it is--so that Board members have a complete understanding
of what type of flexibility or lack thereof the Board has with
respect to re-fashioning or fashioning a new version of Rule 1401.
 He believed the intent in Mr. Antonovich's motion was to re-build
the rule amendment from a different basis, as opposed to re-working
the rule amendment presently proposed.
<P>
 Speaking in support of a 30-day continuance of the public hearing,
Dr. Wilson commented that there was a lot of confusion as far
as the costs applying to new sources only and not existing sources.
 All of the issues need to be clarified by staff and brought back
to the Board in February so that the Board could consider, clearly,
all of the issues.  Ms. Soto added that a specific date should
be set for staff to report back to the Board.
<P>
 Ms. Leyden responded that staff could bring an issues paper (listing
issues and concerns, as well as alternatives) back to the Board
at its February 10, 1995 meeting.
<P>
 Ms. Haggard expressed her concern that the proposed rule amendment
appeared to go beyond what was mandated by the state and federal
governments, and that clarification was needed on exactly what
was required.  She was also concerned that the health hazards
were speculative.
<P>
 Mr. Silva expressed his belief that Rule 1401 would apply to
existing sources, and he was supportive of denying the staff recommendation
and not setting a specific 30-day time for staff to bring this
rule back to the Board.
<P>
THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION BY DR. WILSON TO CONTINUE THE PUBLIC HEARING
ON PROPOSED AMENDED RULE 1401 TO THE FEBRUARY 10, 1995 BOARD MEETING,
AND TO DIRECT STAFF TO EXAMINE THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED DURING THE
PUBLIC HEARING AND BRING A RECOMMENDATION BACK TO THE BOARD AT
THE FEBRUARY 10 BOARD MEETING, FAILED BY THE FOLLOWING VOTE:
<P>
AYES: Wilson and Soto.
<P>
NOES: Albright, Antonovich, Burke, Haggard, Lee, Mikels and Silva.
<P>
ABSENT: Braude and Paulitz.
<P>
THE MOTION BY MR. ANTONOVICH TO DENY THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION
FAILED, FOR A LACK OF SEVEN CONCURRING VOTES, AS FOLLOWS:
<P>
AYES: Albright, Antonovich, Haggard, Lee, Mikels and Silva.
<P>
NOES: Burke, Wilson and Soto.
<P>
ABSENT: Braude and Paulitz.
<P>
MR. ANTONOVICH MOVED TO REJECT THE PROPOSED AMENDED RULE 1401
RECOMMENDED BY STAFF, AND DIRECT STAFF TO MEET WITH THE PRIVATE
SECTOR AND ALSO THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONGRESSIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENCIES IN DEVELOPING A NEW PROPOSAL FOR ADOPTION BY THE BOARD.
<P>
CHAIRMAN MIKELS ASKED IF THERE WAS ANY OPPOSITION TO RECONSIDERATION.
 HEARING NONE, THE CHAIRMAN CALLED FOR A VOTE ON THE ORIGINAL
MOTION BY MR. ANTONOVICH TO DENY THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION.  THE
MOTION PASSED BY THE FOLLOWING VOTE:
<P>
AYES: Albright, Antonovich, Burke, Haggard, Lee, Mikels, and Silva.
<P>
NOES: Soto and Wilson.
<P>
ABSENT: Braude and Paulitz.
<P>
 Chairman Mikels directed staff to meet with the private sector
and state and federal agencies to determine what needs to be accomplished
with respect to amending Rule 1401, and report back to the Board
at a later date to be determined by staff and reported to the
Board, with alternatives.  All of the exemptions and changes discussed
at the public hearing should be addressed in the discussion on
alternatives.
<P>
(Ms. Lee left at 2:45 p.m.)
<P>
 Agenda Item No. 30 was taken out of order so that the Board could
take action on the proposed amendments while a quorum of Board
members was still present. This item required immediate action
by the Board in order to avoid sanctions by USEPA.
<P>
30. Amend Rule 1106 - Marine Coating Operations;<BR>
Rule 1124 - Aerospace Assembly and Component Manufacturing Operations;
<BR>
Rule 1125 - Metal Container, Closure, and Coil Coating Operations;
<BR>
Rule 1126 - Magnet Wire Coating Operations;<BR>
Rule 1153 - Commercial Bakery Ovens; and<BR>
Rule 1164 - Semiconductor Manufacturing
<P>
 In the interest of time, there was no oral staff report given
on this item.  The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard
testimony from <B>Jerry Kraim of Kraim Environmental Engineering
Services</B>.
<P>
 Mr. Kraim expressed opposition to the provision in the proposed
amendments that capture efficiency of emission control systems
be determined by the USEPA method cited in 55 Federal Register
26865 (June 29, 1990), because he believed the testing procedure
to be unrealistic and too costly.
<P>
 There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P>
A UNANIMOUS VOTE WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT TO ADOPT
RESOLUTION NO. 95-1, AMENDING RULES 1106, 1124, 1125, 1126, 1153
AND 1164 AND CERTIFYING THE EXEMPTION FROM CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL
QUALITY ACT REQUIREMENTS, AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.
<P>
29. Amend Rule 1121 - Control of Nitrogen Oxides from Residential
Type Natural Gas-Fired Water Heaters
<P>
 Because of the likelihood of losing a quorum of Board members,
<P>
A UNANIMOUS VOTE WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT TO CONTINUE
THE PUBLIC HEARING TO AMEND RULE 1121 TO THE FEBRUARY 10, 1995

<B>MEETING, FEBRUARY 10, 1995</B>
<P>
A meeting of the South Coast Air Quality Management District Board
will be held at 9:30 a.m., in the Auditorium at AQMD Headquarters,
21865 E. Copley Drive, Diamond Bar, California.
<P>
<U><B>CALL TO ORDER</B></U>

Small Business Assistance and Economic Development Offices for
the fourth quarter of 1994.</I>
<P>
<U><B>CONSENT CALENDAR (Items 3A through 16; Recommend Approval):</B></U>
<P>
3(A) Set a Public Hearing on March 10, 1995 to Consider Amendments
<BR>
to the AQMD's Rules and Regulations, and to Adopt Any Necessary
<BR>
California Environmental Quality Act Documentation for the Following:
<BR>
<BR>
Amend RECLAIM Rule 2011, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring,<BR>
Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur (SOx); and<BR>
Amend RECLAIM Rule 2012, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring, (Leyden)
<BR>
Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) (909)
396-3120
<P>
<I>Staff had proposed to amend Rule 2011, Appendix A, to make
the missing data procedures for major SOx sources consistent with
the major NOx requirements of Rule 2012, Appendix A.  Missing
data procedures would then apply where there is no prior continuous
emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) data available.  An additional
proposal allows Cycle 1 major sources that do not have approved
CEMS to apply different missing data procedures during the period
of January 1, 1995 to June 30, 1995.  This proposal will amend
Rule 2011, Appendix A, and Rule 2012, Appendix A.  As a result,
staff recommends continuing the public hearing on Agenda No. 26
to the March 10, 1995 Board meeting for Proposed Amended Rule
2011, Appendix A, and set a public hearing on that date for Proposed
Amended Rules 2011 and 2012, Appendices A.  This action will ensure
Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 facilities in both NOx and SOx markets are
treated equitably as to the missing data requirements.  Staff
has revised public notification on both rules.</I>
<P>
 4. Minutes of January 13, 1995 Board Meeting (Dix)<BR>
(909) 396-2500
<P>
 5. Addendum to Report to the California Air Resources Board on
the<BR>
South Coast Air Quality Management District's Assembly Bill 2766
(Eichhorn)<BR>
Program for Fiscal Year 1993-94 (909) 396-3240
<P>
<I>AB 2766 and AB 434 require that local agencies imposing vehicle
registration fees for air pollution programs shall report to CARB
on the use of the fees and results of the programs funded.  In
December 1994, District staff prepared a report consisting of
two segments:  A) the District's use of AB 2766 funds for its
own programs;  and B) the Discretionary Fund program.  The third
segment of the report, the local government subvention program,
was prepared in January 1995 after required information from subvention
fund recipients was received.  This information is being submitted
to CARB as an addendum to the original report.</I>
<P>
 6. Audit Report for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1994 (Pearce)
<BR>
(909) 396-2828
<P>
<I>This agenda item transmits the annual financial audit performed
by a firm of independent certified public accountants.  The financial
statements have again received an unqualified opinion, the highest
obtainable.</I>
<P>
 7. Recommendation to Award Contract for Update Training Sessions
to (Wasikowski)<BR>
Employee Transportation Coordinators as Required by Rule 1501
(909) 396-3264
<P>
<I>Staff recommends awarding a contract to provide support for
update training of employee transportation coordinators.  The
contractor will make arrangements to provide classroom spaces,
pre-registration materials, enrollments and confirmations of attendees.
 There will be no funding required by this contract.  The project
must be entirely funded out of the enrollment fees charged to
training participants.</I>
<P>
 8. Recommendation to Accept Funds Into the Pass-Through Agency
Fund<BR>
From the U.S. Department of Energy and Appropriate Those Funds
Into (Lloyd)<BR>
an Agreement for the CleanFleet Demonstration (909) 396-3245
<P>
<I>The 1994 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) emphasizes the
use of alternative transportation technologies throughout the
transportation sector as an air quality attainment strategy. 
The South Coast Alternative Fuels Fleet Project (CleanFleet) is
one of the most comprehensive tests of alternative fuels in fleet
vehicles ever conducted.  Proposed federal funding of $400,000
will be appropriated into an agreement with the Battelle Memorial
Institute for production of final project reports, including engine
performance and durability, vehicle emissions, and fleet economics.</I>
<P>
 9. Recommendation to Cosponsor an Evaluation of Factors that
Affect<BR>
Diesel Exhaust Toxicity (Lloyd)
<P>
<I>Diesel-fueled, heavy-duty vehicles are targeted in the 1994
AQMP for their significant emissions.  Diesel exhaust has also
been identified as a probable human carcinogen, and is undergoing
evaluation as a potential toxic air contaminant by the ARB.  Under
the proposed project, the University of California, Riverside,
Center for Environmental Research and Technology will compare
the speciation and mutagenicity of diesel exhaust from heavy-duty
vehicles using pre-1993 and new, reformulated diesel fuels.  Total
cost of the project is $450,000--$400,000 provided by the ARB
and proposed District funding of $50,000.</I>
<P>
10. Development of the AQMD Delegation and Substitution Process
(Wallerstein)<BR>
(909) 396-3131
<P>
<I>The 1994 AQMP called for the development of a voluntary process
of delegation and substitution that would give local governments
flexibility in the implementation of Transportation Control Measures
and Indirect Source Rules.  The Board is being asked to approve
these procedures as general guidance for the rulemaking process.</I>
<P>
11. Status Report on AQMD Listing of Environmental Documents and
Lead (Broadbent)<BR>
Agency Projects Received by the AQMD for Review and Comment (909)
396-3789
<P>
<I>This report provides a monthly listing of environmental documents
received by the AQMD, and a summary of projects for which the
AQMD is preparing environmental documentation.  AQMD review and
comment are subject to the screening criteria established by the
Governing Board in March 1990.  This document also evaluates the
Lead Agency response to AQMD comments.</I>
<P>
12. PM10 Reasonable Further Progress Report to the U.S. Environmental
<BR>
Protection Agency for the South Coast Air Basin and Coachella
Valley (Broadbent)
<P>
<I>The 1990 Clean Air Act requires that PM10 Reasonable Further
Progress (RFP) Reports be submitted to the EPA in three-year increments.
 The first report is due to EPA by February 28, 1995.  Staff has
compiled RFP reports for both the South Coast Air Basin and Coachella
Valley, and these reports show that reasonable progress has been
made toward the attainment of the PM10 ambient air quality standards
in both areas.  The RFP reports will be forwarded to CARB for
subsequent submittal to EPA.</I>
<P>
13. Recommendation to Approve Vendor List and to Purchase Personal
(Mathur)<BR>
Computer Hardware, Software and Installation Services (909) 396-2722
<P>
<I>On November 18, 1994 the Board approved the release of a Request
for Quotations (RFQ) for Personal Computer Hardware, Software
and Installation Services.  As a result of successful responses
to this RFQ, staff is requesting approval of a certified computer
hardware, software and services vendor list to remain in effect
for two years.  Additionally, staff requests approval to purchase
computer hardware, software and services from these certified
vendors in an amount not to exceed $300,000.  This purchase will
help standardize the District's desktop computer environment.
 Funding for this purchase is allocated in the Fiscal Year 1994-95
Budget.</I>

15. Annual Report on Air Quality and Wildland Fires (Leyden)
<P>
<I>The annual report on air quality and wildland fires summarizes
the status of controlled burning of brush and vegetation by fire
protection agencies in the South Coast Air Basin.</I>
<P>
16. Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for Source
(Liu)<BR>
Emissions Testing by Outside Contractors (909) 396-2105
<P>
<I>The AQMD has used private sector source emission testing services
since 1987 to augment and enhance the AQMD's source testing capabilities.
 Applied Science and Technology proposes to continue this contracting
effort at a level between 125-150 source compliance tests annually,
beginning August 1, 1995.  Such compliance testing will be required
to be conducted using AQMD test methods in accordance with AQMD
quality assurance practices and subject to AQMD review.  The maximum
dollar amount to be contracted out is $300,000.</I>

AGENDA ITEMS 6, 8, 9, 11, 12 AND 14 THROUGH 16 AS RECOMMENDED
BY STAFF.
<P>
3(A) Set a Public Hearing on March 10, 1995 to Consider Amendments
to the AQMD's Rules and Regulations, and to Adopt Any Necessary
California Environmental Quality Act Documentation for the Following:
<P>
Amend RECLAIM Rule 2011, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring, Reporting,
and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur (SOx); and Amend RECLAIM
Rule 2012, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring, Reporting, and Recordkeeping
for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)
<P>
 Mr. Silva expressed concern regarding the economic impact of
the rules' requirements on the affected businesses, and questioned
the rationale.  Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance,
responded that the proposed amendments address sections of the
adopted rules that require large NOx and SOx sources to install
continuous emissions monitors (CEMs) and report to the AQMD the
actual emissions from those facilities.  This monitoring and reporting
of actual emissions is the basic enforcement part of the RECLAIM
trading program.  The affected facilities were allowed one year
to install and test the CEMs and connect reporting equipment which
will electronically transmit the emissions data to the AQMD. 
In the interim, the emissions data is being reported to the AQMD
through submittal of manual paper records relating to fuel usage.
 AQMD staff manually enters the records into a data base that
analyzes site-by-site compliance with the RECLAIM rules.  Shortly
after adoption of the rules, RECLAIM facilities were randomly
placed in two separate cycles which resulted in Cycle 1 facilities
(January 1, 1994 - January 1, 1995) having 12 months to comply
and Cycle 2 facilities (July 1, 1994 - July 1, 1995) actually
having 18 months to comply.  The proposed amendments will ensure
Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 facilities in both NOx and SOx markets are
treated equitably as to the missing data requirements.
<P>
 Mr. Silva further commented that companies should be allowed
the flexibility to maintain non-operating equipment on the facility
permit without being required to install costly emissions monitors
on such equipment.  In response Ms. Leyden agreed to provide Mr.
Silva a copy of staff's rule interpretation on this issue which
basically states that if  the equipment is clearly not operating,
a condition will be included on the facility permit placing that
equipment in a non-operating status.
<P>
 4. Minutes of January 13, 1995 Board Meeting
<P>
 Ms. Soto requested that Agenda Item No. 11 on Page 2 of the Minutes
be revised to reflect, in Dr. Burke's comments, his support for
Board assistants and their important role for those Board members
who do not have such assistance provided to them by their respective
cities or counties.
<P>
 5. Addendum to Report to the California Air Resources Board on
the South Coast Air Quality Management District's Assembly Bill
2766 Program for Fiscal Year 1993-94
<P>
 <B>Larry Stevens</B> addressed the Board on behalf of the <B>San
Gabriel Valley Council of Governments (SGVCOG) and the City of
San Dimas</B> regarding unexpended AB 2766 funds currently being
held by cities.  Preliminary results from a survey of SGVOG members
indicate that cities are looking for more guidance on appropriate
activities to fund under the AB 2766 program, and they have discussed
with AQMD staff possible approaches to needed education such as
workshops, written guidelines, and brochures.  (Submitted Written
Comments)
<P>
 Mr. Paulitz commented that as a City of Montclair Councilmember,
he is aware of this problem and believes that if the AQMD provides
cities with guidelines on the proper use of the AB 2766 funds,
it will be favorably reflected in the next audit report.  Ms.
Soto added her support for the cities on this item, and pointed
out that the amount of money quoted in the report as unspent is
not because the cities do not need the funds, but because the
cities save funding from year to year for specific expenditures.
<P>
 7. Recommendation to Award Contract for Update Training Sessions
to Employee Transportation Coordinators as Required by Rule 1501
<P>
 <B>Ms. Terry Solis of The Solis Group</B> addressed the Board
in opposition to the staff recommendation.  She outlined concerns
with the bidding, evaluation and selection process stated in her
letter to the Governing Board dated February 9, 1995.
<P>
 Staff responded that Requests for Proposals (RFPs) were sent
to 59 firms interested in submitting a proposal.  Those same 59
firms were also sent notice of the pre-bid meeting.  <BR>
Ms. Solis was not notified of the meeting because she obtained
the RFP from a source other than the AQMD.  She did, however,
become aware of the pre-bid meeting and was able to have a representative
from her firm attend the meeting.  Information on staff's recommendation
for awarding the bid was provided to Ms. Solis in accordance with
AQMD's policy of releasing such information to the public only
after it has been officially approved by the Executive Officer
and the information has been provided to Board members.  The difference
between the scoring system in the RFP (100 possible points) and
the scoring system explained in the staff recommendation (400
possible points) was the result of there being four panel reviewers
and, therefore, a combined total of 400 possible points.
<P>
 With respect to Total Employee Relations (&quot;Total&quot;),
the firm recommended by staff for awarding of the bid, their cost-effectiveness
rating was increased by their offer of additional services such
as a $5,000 two-day training workshop for AQMD staff, refreshments
for the Employee Transportation Coordinators (ETCs) and six people
on site for the training sessions.  As certified minority owned-,
woman-owned or disabled veteran owned-business enterprises (MBE/WBE/DVBE),
the firms ranked second and third were given 10 additional points.
 Total did not receive any additional points, although the firm
offered in its proposal to have the two-day training workshop
performed by a MBE/WBE/DVBE-certified firm.  Total scored the
highest points overall because it had the most cost-effective
and technically-qualified proposal.
<P>
 Transportation Programs Director Catherine Wasikowski also clarified
that staff's statement at the pre-bid meeting was not that the
meeting was only being held because the Board made staff do so;
but that unlike past years, the contract for this year's training
sessions for ETCs would be submitted to the Board for approval.
<P>
 Ms. Haggard suggested that since the Board anticipates amending
Rule 1501 in April 1995, contracting for ETC training should be
postponed until after the Board has taken action on the proposed
amendments.  She believed it imprudent and premature to contract
for training in existing methods when there may be new methods
adopted by the Board in April.
<P>
 Ms. Soto indicated her agreement with Ms. Haggard's comments,
and expressed her belief that it is not fair to require participants
to pay for training which is required by AQMD regulations.
<P>
 Ms. Lee suggested that the Board extend the existing contract,
which expires in March 1995, and reconsider the contract--without
having to go through the RFP process again--at the time the Board
considers amendments to Rule 1501.
<P>
MS. HAGGARD MOVED TO CONTINUE AGENDA ITEM NO. 7 UNTIL AFTER THE
BOARD HAS TAKEN ACTION ON PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO RULE 1501, AND
EXTEND THE EXISTING CONTRACT AS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE CONTINUED
UPDATE TRAINING SESSIONS TO EMPLOYEE TRANSPORTATION COORDINATORS.
 THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. LEE.
<P>
 At Ms. Soto's suggestion,
<P>
THE MOTION BY MS. HAGGARD WAS AMENDED TO INCLUDE THAT  AFTER TAKING
ACTION ON THE AMENDMENTS TO RULE 1501, THE BOARD WILL CONSIDER
WHETHER OR NOT ANOTHER RFP SHOULD BE ISSUED FOR THE UPDATE TRAINING
SESSIONS.  THE MOTION PASSED BY THE FOLLOWING VOTE:
<P>
AYES: Albright, Braude, Burke, Haggard, Lee, Loveridge, Mikels,
Paulitz, Silva, Soto and Wilson.
<P>
NOES: None.
<P>
ABSTAIN: Antonovich.
<P>
ABSENT: None.
<P>
 <B>Teresa Moren of AMCS</B>, whose request to address the Board
had been inadvertently overlooked, spoke in opposition to staff's
recommendation.  She commented that she also had requested and
received the RFP, but there was no mention of the pre-bid meeting.
 By chance, she found out about the meeting from someone else.
 She expressed her concern that the existing contractor, Total
Employee Relations, was not making their best effort as far as
planning the training sessions and the facilities arranged by
them for the training sessions.
<P>
10. Development of the AQMD Delegation and Substitution Process
<P>
 <B>Larry Stevens, San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments;
Ms. Terry Parker, California Air Resources Board; and Jim Birckhead
of Western Riverside Council of Governments </B>addressed the
Board in support of the staff recommendation.
<P>
 Mr. Stevens requested Board support of the following guiding
principles (set out in more detail in written comments submitted
to the Board):
<P>
(1) Further work is needed in simplifying the process to facilitate
local government implementation of air quality regulations.
<P>
(2) The rules that are to be delegated or substituted should be
flexible menu-based options.  If so, the process for delegation
would be virtually non-existent because the flexibility needed
would occur through administrative delegation.
<P>
(3) Although the proposed procedures give some consideration to
performance standard approaches, there is too strong of a focus
on &quot;bean-counting&quot; which improperly leads to the conclusion
that actions taken can be measured to the smallest level of detail.
<P>
(4) AQMD should consider allowing local governments to achieve
multiple purposes (air quality, congestion management and related
regulations) with one program whenever possible.
<P>
(5) A continuing role should be facilitated for local government
on task forces, working groups and similar study actions as measures
are prepared for adoption and implementation.
<P>
 Ms. Haggard expressed support for the proposed procedures, but
was concerned that the procedures had not been reviewed by the
Interagency AQMP Implementation Committee (IAIC) before being
submitted to the Board for approval.
<P>
 Ms. Soto agreed with comments made about allowing local governments
more flexibility and making the procedures more simple.  She added
that since she was not a member of the Board when the delegation/substitution
concept was included in the 1994 AQMP, she wanted to publicly
express her support for what AQMD staff and the working group
accomplished.  It is her hope that through this process, the AQMD
can create a stronger relationship with local government.
<P>
 Mr. Paulitz indicated his support for the proposed procedures,
and Mr. Braude stressed the need for cooperation by local government
and the public in order to achieve clean air in the basin.
<P>
MS. HAGGARD MOVED TO REFER THE DELEGATION AND SUBSTITUTION PROCESS
TO THE IAIC FOR REVIEW AND SUBMITTAL BACK TO THE BOARD.  THE MOTION
WAS DULY SECONDED.
<P>
 In response to Ms. Soto, Barry Wallerstein, DEO of Planning,
Transportation &amp; Information Management, indicated staff's
agreement with the points made by Mr. Stevens and staff's belief
that the existing document has the flexibility to accomplish what
he requested.
<P>
 Ms. Soto added that the statements made by Mr. Stevens with respect
to flexibility and simplicity should also be considered in the
IAIC's review of this item.
<P>
A UNANIMOUS VOTE WAS CAST OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT TO REFER
AGENDA THE DELEGATION AND SUBSTITUION PROCESS TO THE IAIC FOR
REVIEW AND SUBMITTAL BACK TO THE BOARD.
<P>
13. Recommendation to Approve Vendor List and to Purchase Personal
Computer Hardware, Software and Installation Services
<P>
 Dr. Burke indicated a conflict of interest on this item, and
requested from staff a list of all computer purchases by the AQMD
for the past three years, justification for those purchases and
how the equipment is currently being used.
<P>
A UNANIMOUS VOTE WAS CAST OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT, WITH DR.
BURKE AND MR. ANTONOVICH ABSTAINING, TO APPROVE AGENDA ITEM NO.
13 AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. ALBRIGHT, SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ, A UNANIMOUS
VOTE WAS CAST OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT TO APPROVE AGENDA ITEMS
NO. 3(A), NO. 4 (INCLUDING THE AMENDMENT OF PAGE 2 OF THE MINUTES

17. Legislation Committee Report and Recommendations
<P>
 Chairman Mikels noted that Board members had received notification
with regard to the federal court's action on the proposed stipulation
between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and plaintiffs
in that action regarding the State Implementation Plan (SIP) and
the Federal Implementation Plan (FIP).  He commented that Congressman
Jay Kim has introduced legislation in Congress, HR 304, relative
to the FIP and SIP; and there is discussion that Congressman 
<BR>
Jerry Lewis will also introduce similar legislation.  Chairman
Mikels referred the items to the Legislation Committee to consider
at its next meeting and report back to the Board with a recommendation
as to whether or not those congressional legislative efforts should
be supported by the Board.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. PAULITZ, A UNANIMOUS VOTE WAS CAST OF THE BOARD

<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. MIKELS, SECONDED BY DR. WILSON, A UNANIMOUS VOTE
WAS CAST OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT TO APPROVE AGENDA ITEM NO.
23 AS RECOMMENDED.
<P>
24. Recommendation Regarding Board Member Assistance
<P>
 Chairman Mikels stated that following discussion on this item
at the January 13, 1995 Board meeting, the item was referred to
the Administrative Committee for further consideration.
<P>
 Dr. Wilson commented that he expressed his objections to the
recommendation at the January Board meeting.  In reviewing the
Minutes of the Administrative Committee meeting, he was disappointed
that it seemed to focus on who could hire and terminate Board
member assistants, rather than the basic issue of why the Board
needs to increase the amount of salaries for Board member assistants.
 Although he has not had an assistant provided by the AQMD or
the City for the seven years he has served on the Board, he does
not object to Board members having assistants.  His objection
was to compensation of $45 an hour, which he believes to be excessive
and circumvents the intent of the Legislature which attempted
to place a cap on the governance of the AQMD by limiting Board
member compensation to $100 per day and a maximum of $1,000 per
month.
<P>
 Another concern expressed by Dr. Wilson was that while the AQMD
has significantly reduced both its staff and its budget, the Board
has gone from $0 budgeted in 1991 for Board member assistance
to $60,000 budgeted in 1992 and $240,000 budgeted in 1993.  The
present recommendation is to raise the amount to $300,000, which
he believes is contrary to good judgment and contrary to the message
the Board has been sending out that they want to ease the economic
impact on business and industry.  Mr. Braude added his full support
to the comments by Dr. Wilson.
<P>
 Chairman Mikels clarified that there are two classifications:
 Board Member Assistant, with a maximum compensation rate of up
to $25 an hour;  and Board Member Consultant, with a maximum compensation
rate of up to $45 an hour.  The job descriptions indicate that
the differences in background, experience and capabilities are
the deciding factors as to classification.  There is also a cap
on the total amount eligible for expenditure by each Board member,
regardless of the rate of compensation.  He also added that the
amount budgeted was not entirely expended, and less than half
of the Board members utilized this assistance.
<P>
 Ms. Soto stated for the record that, as a representative of 63
cities, she could not provide those cities the best possible representation
without the help of her assistant.  The cities have strongly expressed
the desire to be involved in the process, and her assistant has
been particularly beneficial in that regard.  She believes the
money for Board member assistants is being well spent and wished
that they could be paid more.
<P>
 Mr. Paulitz commented that he had not realized that the budget
for board member assistance had increased so significantly.  When
he hired an assistant, he voluntarily reduced his assistant's
compensation rate because he felt, from an administrative point
of view, that the amount was not justified in the overall budget
context.  He supported the objective of having Board member assistants,
but thought the Board should perhaps reconsider the compensation
rates.
<P>
 Mr. Albright expressed concern regarding visibility of some of
the Board member assistants, and hoped that Board members would
not send their assistants to committee meetings and other public
meetings in their absence.  Mr. Albright also requested that staff
provide an accounting of money spent for assistants for the next
Board meeting.
<P>
 Dr. Burke's belief was that a monolithic approach to Board member
assistance is inappropriate, since the needs and availability
of assistance to various Board members range dramatically.  Some
Board members have vast resources from governmental agencies available
for their research and their defining of policy.  Others have
enormous personal experience dealing with air quality issues.
 With the addition of new Board members and the tremendous amount
of background and complexity of the rules and issues, Board members
will need assistants or they will have to dedicate an enormous
amount of personal time and resource to this effort.
<P>
DR. WILSON MOVED TO TABLE THE RECOMMENDATION REGARDING BOARD MEMBER
ASSISTANCE, AND RE-VISIT THE ISSUE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ENTIRE
FISCAL YEAR 1995-96 AQMD BUDGET WHEN THE BOARD CONSIDERS ADOPTION
OF THE BUDGET.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. BRAUDE AND FAILED,
FOR A LACK OF SEVEN CONCURRING VOTES, AS FOLLOWS:
<P>
AYES: Albright, Braude, Loveridge, Paulitz, Soto and Wilson.
<P>
NOES: Antonovich, Burke, Haggard, Lee, Mikels and Silva.

<P>
25. Receive Public Input on the Executive Officer's Program Goals/Objectives
for the Fiscal Year 1995-96 Budget
<P>
 Dr. Lents reported that the purpose of this item was to allow
the public an opportunity to comment on the AQMD's work program
and budget for the next fiscal year.
<P>
 The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony
from the following individual:
<P>
<U>JOHN BILLHEIMER, Consultant</U>
<P>
 Suggested that there be allocations available in the budget for
research involving reformulation of toxic- and volatile organic
compound-containing coatings, paints, inks and adhesives for small
businesses whose use of these materials is so small that installation
of add-on control equipment is not a cost-effective option.  The
manufacturers of these materials cannot justify conducting much
research for what amounts to approximately 5 percent of the national
market or 1 percent of the international market.  (Submitted Written
Comments.)
<P>
 There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P>
 In response to Mr. Braude, Director of Finance Patrick Pearce
outlined the chronology of the budget development process and
milestones expected before the public hearing scheduled for May
12, 1995 for Board adoption of the Fiscal Year 1995-96 budget.
<P>
 Ms. Haggard suggested that when the budget is being developed
there be more emphasis placed on expanding the use of market incentives
in AQMD rules and development of a pricing mechanism for mobile
sources.  Additionally, she believed there should be time limitations
set so that in the event one course is not working, the District
is able to change its course.  Since there was no mention in the
goals of any legislative platform, Ms. Haggard suggested that
one goal should be to work with the federal and state legislature
to insure that the District can comply with the Clean Air Act
and also implement emission reduction strategies instead of strict
average vehicle ridership (AVR).
<P>
 In response to Ms. Haggard's concern that Item IV-A of the Goals
and Objectives, &quot;<I>Continue to develop and implement improvements
to Regulation XV</I>&quot;, did not appropriately reflect the
Board's direction toward Regulation XV, Dr. Lents agreed to add
language to <BR>
Item IV-A indicating a shift away from AVR towards emission reduction
types of measures.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. PAULITZ, SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD, A UNANIMOUS
VOTE WAS CAST OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT TO APPROVE THE EXECUTIVE
OFFICER'S PROGRAM GOALS/OBJECTIVES AND SET A PUBLIC HEARING ON
MAY 12, 1995 FOR ADOPTION OF THE FISCAL YEAR 1995-96 AQMD BUDGET,
AS RECOMMENDED.
<P>
26. Amend RECLAIM Rule 2011, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring,
Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur (SOx) Emissions
<P>
 Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, indicated that
this item was related to Agenda Item No. 3(A).  Staff's recommendation
was that the Board continue this public hearing to March 10, 1995
so that proposed amendments to both Rule 2011 and Rule 2012 can
be combined in one hearing.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. BRAUDE, SECONDED BY MR. ALBRIGHT, A UNANIMOUS
VOTE WAS CAST OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT TO CONTINUE THE PUBLIC
HEARING ON RECLAIM RULE 2011, APPENDIX A, TO THE MARCH 10, 1995
BOARD MEETING.
<P>
27. Amend Rule 1302 - Definitions
<P>
 Ms. Leyden reported that staff originally brought this item before
the Board in November 1994 as a minor correction of a definition
in New Source Review (NSR).  Issues were raised at the public
hearing relating to federal public noticing requirements and the
definition of a major source, and the public hearing was continued
by the Board to its February 1995 meeting in order to allow staff
additional time to resolve the issues.  Staff recommended that
the Board close the public hearing and take no action on Rule
1302.  The proposed amendments will be incorporated with proposed
amendments to Regulation XIII scheduled for hearing at the June
9, 1995 Board meeting.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. BRAUDE, A UNANIMOUS VOTE WAS CAST OF THE BOARD
MEMBERS PRESENT TO RECEIVE AND FILE AGENDA ITEM NO. 27.
<P>
28. Adopt Proposed Regulation XXXI - Acid Rain Permit Program
<P>
 The staff report was given by Alene Taber, Program Supervisor.
 In response to <BR>
Mr. Braude, staff clarified the rationale and intent of the proposed
regulation and identified the affected utility facilities.
<P>
 The public hearing was opened and, there being no public testimony,
the hearing was closed.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. BRAUDE, DULY SECONDED, A UNANIMOUS VOTE WAS CAST
OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT TO ADOPT RESOLUTION NO. 95-2, ADOPTING
REGULATION XXXI AND CERTIFYING THE EXEMPTION FROM CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL
QUALITY ACT REQUIREMENTS AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.
<P>
29. Amend Rule 1121 - Control of Nitrogen Oxides from Residential
Type Natural Gas-Fired Water Heaters
<P>
 The staff report was given by Pang Mueller, Senior Manager. 
The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from
<B>Eric Lannes, Bradford White Corporation</B>, and <B>Frank Stanonik,
Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association</B>, in opposition to
the proposed amendments relating to compliance and certification
which they believe are unnecessarily burdensome and stringent.
 They requested the following revisions to the proposed amended
rule:
<P>
 Change Subparagraph (d)(1) to require one sample in each basic
model be tested instead of three.
<P>
 With respect to Subparagraph (d)(4), exempt water heater models
from the requirement of <BR>
re-certification every three years, as long as these models are
included in a NOx certification program that requires periodic
audit testing.
<P>
 Language should be added to Subparagraph (f) to provide consistency
with the test protocol in its measurement accuracy tolerances
when conducting verification tests.
<P>
 (Written Comments Submitted.)
<P>
 Ms. Leyden responded that the three suggested revisions seemed
appropriate to staff, and recommended that the Board continue
the public hearing on this item to the March 10, 1995 Board meeting
to allow staff time to review and incorporate the revisions into
the Proposed Amended Rule.
<P>
 Mr. Paulitz asked for staff's response to questions raised in
the letter dated February 1, 1995 to Board members from Edwin
J. Cowan concerning how a market incentive program could be productive
without including a mandatory reduction in NOx limits.
<P>
 Dr. Lents responded that under the Area Source Credit program,
the water heater manufacturers will be able to receive credits
for reducing NOx emissions below the limit of 40 nanograms/joule.
 Those credits can then be purchased by other sources that are
exceeding emissions limits.  This is expected to encourage sources
to search for ways of achieving the greatest amount of emission
reductions in the most cost-effective manner.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. ALBRIGHT, SECONDED BY MS. LEE, A UNANIMOUS VOTE
WAS CAST OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT TO CONTINUE THE PUBLIC HEARING

<P>
<P>
11.	Report on the Study of the AQMD's Fee Structure and Authority	(Pearce)<P>
<P>
<I>With the recent changes in state legislation capping the AQMD's revenue and fee increases, coupled with the continued decline in revenue from stationary sources, the AQMD contracted for an independent analysis of its fee structure and authority to determine if the fees charged were both equitable and sufficient to fund the AQMD's stationary source activities.<P>
</I><P>
<P>
<P>

12.	Recommendation to Recognize Revenue and Appropriate Funds to be
Received from the Southern California Association of Governments
and Amend the Contract with the University and Community College
System of Nevada for a Program for the Use of Remote Sensing	
Devices to Detect High-Emitting Vehicles 
(Lloyd) (909) 396-2345<P>
<P>
<I>The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) has made $42,000 available to supplement an in-progress, AQMD-sponsored project with the University and Community College Systems of Nevada (UCCSN) to develop a remote sensing program to detect high-emitting vehicles.  Staff is requesting that the Board recognize $42,000 in revenue from SCAG for the purpose of remote sensing, approve an additional $30,000 towards this program to be used for the cost of shipping and operation of a portable dynamometer from the U.S. EPA, and authorize the Chairman of the Board to execute an amendment to the agreement with UCCSN in the amount of $72,000.<P>
</I><P>
<P>
<P>
13.	Recommendation to Amend a Contract for the Evaluation of PM10
Emissions from Vehicles in Southern California	(Lloyd)<P>
<P>
<I>Staff is proposing to join the current national efforts of the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) with the services of the UCCSN, to evaluate chemical composition of PM10, inhalable particulates (PM2.5), and other significant pollutants emissions from vehicles at the Sepulveda tunnel.  The AQMD is already co-funding CRC's current study at the Van Nuys tunnel.  This addition will be an amendment to a contract between the AQMD and CRC.  The total cost of the proposed addition is approximately $155,000.  National Renewable Energy Laboratory located in Golden, Colorado, will be supporting this amendment with a $55,000 funding.  Staff recommends that the Board authorize cofunding for this study in an amount not to exceed $100,000.<P>
</I><P>
<P>
<P>
14.	Recommendation to Amend a Contract for the Demonstration of
Compressed Natural Gas Engines in Heavy-Duty Trucks	(Lloyd)<P>
<P>
<I>In 1991 the AQMD contracted with Acurex Environmental Corporation for the development and demonstration of Caterpillar and Detroit Diesel compressed natural gas engines in heavy-duty trucks.  The project is cofunded by the California Energy Commission, the Gas Company, and the U.S. Department of Energy.  Staff requests amending the contract to add $320,000 and extend the term to complete development and demonstration efforts.  Total direct project costs are $2,808,600, with total AQMD funding of $720,000.<P>
</I><P>
<P>
<P>
15.	Recommendation to Cosponsor Durability Testing for a Natural Gas
Retrofit Kit for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines	(Lloyd)<P>
<P>
<I>Medium- and heavy-duty engines retrofitted to operate on natural gas can provide significant emissions reductions; however, ARB emissions durability testing requirements make it difficult to certify retrofit kits.  The proposed project with GFI Control Systems, Inc. will support emissions durability testing of a natural gas retrofit kit for a General Motors 454 engine.  The project also includes emissions durability testing of light-duty retrofit kits and has a total cost of $1,097,130.  Proposed AQMD funding is $150,000.  Other sponsors include GFI, Gas Research Institute, Canadian Gas Association and Natural Resources Canada.<P>

to the Hearing Board	(Leyden)<P>
<P>
<I>Pursuant to RECLAIM Rule 2015 (b)(4), any increases in annual allocations issued by the Hearing Board, pursuant to permit appeals, must be reported to the Governing Board annually in March.  While no changes were made to annual allocations at the Hearing Board itself, certain adjustments to RECLAIM allocations were made administratively by staff in the course of reviewing permit appeals filed with the Board.  Such changes to the allocations have not been significant and have not jeopardized equivalency.  This report covers allocation reviews from January 1, 1994 to January 1, 1995.<P>

Staff:  Eichhorn (Paulitz) (909) 396-3240<P>
<P>
<I>As part of its Fiscal Year 1993-94 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program, the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee created a program designed to encourage the county transportation commissions to spend Surface Transportation Program, Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, and Air Quality Improvements funds on transportation control measures.  This ISTEA/TCM Partnership Program allocated approximately $1 million to each of the four commissions.  At its meeting on February 23, 1995, the MSRC approved an amendment to the ISTEA/TCM contract for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to provide funding for the purchase of CNG buses rather than CNG differential fuel costs as was originally requested.  Since the original project was included as part of the FY 1993-94 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program, this contract change must be approved by the District Board.<P>

32.	Amend Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen and
Oxides of Sulfur (Leyden)<P>
<P>
<I>Rule 2015(c)(3) requires that the Executive Officer perform a technology review for petroleum coke calciners.  The review has been completed and the Executive Officer has found that an increase to the year 2000 emission factor is appropriate.  This will result in an increase of approximately 0.21 ton per day in the year 2000 allocation.  To change RECLAIM NOx allocations, the Rule 2002 emission factor for calciners is proposed for amendment from 0.61 to 0.971 pound of NOx per ton of calcined coke.  The necessary CEQA documents will be included in the final board package.<P>
</I><P>
<P>
<P>
33.	Amend RECLAIM Rule 2011, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring,
Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur (SOx); and
Amend RECLAIM Rule 2012, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring,
Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) (Leyden)<P>
<P>
<I>Staff had proposed to amend Rule 2011, Appendix A, to make the missing data procedures for major SOx sources consistent with the major NOx requirements of Rule 2012, Appendix A.  Missing data procedures would then apply where there is no prior continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) data available.  An additional proposal allows Cycle 1 major sources that do not have approved CEMS to apply different missing data procedures during the period of January 1, 1995 to June 30, 1995.  This proposal will amend Rule 2011, Appendix A, and Rule 2012, Appendix A, and will ensure Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 facilities in both NOx and SOx markets are treated equitably as to the missing data requirements.<P>
</I><P>
<P>
<P>
34.	Amend Rule 1121 - Control of Nitrogen Oxides from Residential Type	(Lockie)
Natural Gas-Fired Water Heaters
<I>(Continued from the February 10, 1995 Board Meeting)</I><P>
<I><P>
</I><I>The proposed amendments to Rule 1121 will not change the existing emission limits specified in this rule, but will clarify existing rule language.  The proposed amendments will also replace the existing certification testing protocol with a new, more accurate and reliable protocol which was developed jointly by AQMD, water heater manufacturers, independent testing laboratories, and the gas industry.  It will also include any necessary CEQA documentation.  Staff will provide further recommendations based on public comment presented at the February 10, 1995 public hearing.<P>

<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. ALBRIGHT, SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ, THE BOARD
APPROVED AGENDA ITEMS 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12 THROUGH 17 AND 20(A)
AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF; AND CONTINUED AGENDA ITEM NO. 19 TO THE
APRIL 14, 1995 BOARD MEETING, BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT OF THE BOARD
MEMBERS PRESENT.  (Absent:  Haggard, Loveridge and Wilson.)
<P>
(Written comments submitted by Linda Osborn regarding Agenda Item
No. 19.)
<P>
 3. Minutes of February 10, 1995 Board Meeting
<P>
 Dr. Burke brought attention to Agenda Item No. 13 on page 6 of
the Minutes, wherein he requested from staff a list of all computer
purchases by the AQMD for the past three years, justification
for those purchases and how the equipment is currently being used.
 He commented that while the report submitted to him by staff
was well done, it did not include all three of the items he requested.
<P>
 Dr. James M. Lents, Executive Officer, assured Dr. Burke that
staff would provide him with a report complete with all of the
requested information.
<P>
 6. Set a Public Hearing on April 14, 1995 to Adopt Proposed Rule
1501.1 - Alternatives to Work Trip Reduction Plans
<P>
 Ms. Soto asked if the proposed rule could include a commitment
from the AQMD to provide training for those communities that do
not have adequate technical resources.  <BR>
Barry Wallerstein, DEO/Planning &amp; Information Management,
responded that if the Board adopts the proposed rule, staff plans
to conduct training for the communities in order to facilitate
use of the rule.  Staff could address disadvantaged communities
as part of the outreach for the training.  Additionally, language
could be included in the adopting resolution for the proposed
rule which would address the issue of training for disadvantaged
communities.
<P>
 8. Set a Public Hearing on May 12, 1995 to Amend Rule 1171 -
Solvent Cleaning Operations
<P>
 Pat Leyden, DEO/Stationary Source Compliance, noted for the record
that errata sheets had been distributed to Board members and made
available to the public addressing deletions and clarification
of language for Proposed Amended Rule 1171.
<P>
 In response to a question by Ms. Soto, Ms. Leyden stated that
there are five rules for which staff will be recommending Board
adoption of amendments as corrections following Environmental
Protection Agency identification of deficiencies in the rules.
 Proposed Amended Rule 1171 is the first of those rules, and staff
will bring the other rules to the Board for amendment at a later
date.
<P>
-o-
<P>
 Mr. Antonovich brought attention to a letter he received from
Renzo Venturo of GM Hughes Electronics regarding Agenda Item No.
6 (Set Hearing on April 14, 1995 to Adopt Proposed Rule 1501.1).
 He distributed to Board members copies of the letter, in which
<BR>
Mr. Venturo requested a one-month delay of the public hearing
on this item in order to meet with AQMD staff regarding a number
of technical issues in the current draft rule language that needed
to be resolved by staff with the California Air Resources Board
(ARB) and with the regulated community.
<P>
 Mr. Wallerstein responded that he spoke with Mr. Venturo before
the Board meeting regarding the comments in his letter, and assured
him that AQMD staff will work diligently with Mr. Venturo's staff
to clarify various points and resolve their concerns, to the extent
feasible, before the public hearing in April.  Mr. Venturo indicated
his willingness to have the Board set the public hearing for April
14, with the understanding that if their concerns are not resolved,
they will request that the Board delay the public hearing.
<P>
-o-
<P>
11. Report on the Study of the AQMD's Fee Structure and Authority
<P>
 <B>Curtis Coleman</B> addressed the Board on behalf of the <B>California
Manufacturers'</B> <B>Association Air Quality Alliance.</B>  He
commented that although the study was useful in allowing the public
to gain a better understanding, in a general sense, of what District
programs are being implemented, how much those programs cost to
implement and how the programs are funded;  it was only a small
first step.  Additional studies need to be made which:  (i) evaluate
the cost of each of the AQMD's programs versus program effectiveness,
in terms of emission reduction or other program goals;  (ii) make
recommendations regarding operational practices that could be
implemented by the AQMD to improve productivity;  (iii) evaluate
the amount of resources being devoted to stationary source emission
reduction programs versus mobile source emission reduction programs;
 (iv) identify which programs are mandated by federal and state
laws and which are authorized, but not required, by those laws;
 and (v) determine whether any AQMD programs duplicate, overlap
or conflict with state or federal air quality regulatory programs.
<P>
 Mr. Silva expressed his desire that:  (i) the AQMD exhaust all
reasonable ways of reducing the cost of providing services before
considering any of the consultant's recommendations regarding
fee increases;  (ii) operating fees be based on actual emissions
instead of potential emissions;  (iii) when the AQMD considers
alternative sources of revenue, that mobile sources be considered
first;  and (iv) that the authority for increased funding be placed
with the ARB.
<P>
 Dr. Lents commented that the recommendations in the report are
from the firm that conducted the study, and not from AQMD staff;
nor do they represent the opinion of the Board.  Also, any fee
increases would have to be discussed in a public meeting and adopted
by the Board.
<P>
18. Report on RECLAIM Allocation Adjustments Due to Permit Appeals
to the Hearing Board
<P>
 In response to a question by Dr. Burke, Ms. Leyden indicated
that 4 of the 49 facilities removed from RECLAIM were the result
of operations going out of business.
<P>
20. Recommendation Regarding Request for Quotations for Security
Guard Services at the Diamond Bar Headquarters
<P>
 Ms. Soto questioned why the AQMD needed so much security ($644,000/three-year
period).  Dr. Lents responded that the AQMD has historically had
problems with unauthorized persons entering the premises and removing
data from files, and therefore contracted for security services.
 During 1994, disruptions at two Board meetings and the disappearance
of equipment worth thousands of dollars from the AQMD necessitated
an increase in security services.
<P>
(Ms. Haggard arrived at 10:10 a.m.)
<P>
 In response to a question by Mr. Silva concerning cost comparison
with security services for the private sector , Nick Nikkila,
Assistant DEO/Technical Support Services, explained that the competitive
nature of the bidding process tends to eliminate very high bids
and the bid is typically awarded to the company providing the
best service at the lowest possible cost.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. PAULITZ, DULY SECONDED, THE BOARD APPROVED AGENDA
ITEMS 3, 6, 8 (Including Errata sheets), 11, 18 AND 20 BY UNANIMOUS
CONSENT OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT.  (Absent:  Braude, Loveridge
and Wilson.)
<P>
-o-
<P>
 In response to Mr. Albright's question as to why Agenda Item
No. 19 was being continued to April, Mr. Nikkila stated that receipt
of additional information from the company recommended by staff
for award of the bid made it necessary for staff to enter into
further negotiations with them before making a recommendation
to the Board.
<P>
-o-
<P>
 With regard to Agenda Item No. 20(A), Mr. Antonovich complimented
staff on the revised goals and objectives, which recognize that
a strong economy and clean air are not mutually exclusive.

<P>
 Expressing his support for the addition of this item to the Board's
monthly meeting agenda, Mr. Paulitz commented that when he was
on the Advisory Council he recommended that the Board be made
aware of the Council's actions.
<P>
29. Report Regarding Status of Board Member Assistance Funds
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. ALBRIGHT, SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ, AGENDA ITEMS
21 THROUGH 29 WERE APPROVED AS RECOMMENDED BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT
OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT.  (Absent:  Braude, Loveridge and
Wilson.)
<P>
30. Report on the Performance Audit of the AQMD for the Fiscal
Year Ending June 30, 1994
<P>
 Julia Kirwan and Susan Foreman of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP (KPMG)
gave a brief slide presentation reviewing the state mandate, highlighting
the key points of the audit report and discussing KPMG's findings
and recommendations.
<P>
 In response to Ms. Soto's request for postponement of this item
to allow sufficient time to review the report, Dr. Lents stated
that the AQMD was required to submit the report to the State Legislature
by April 1, 1995.  Ms. Soto stated that she received the report
just two days before the Board meeting, and she asked that in
the future staff allow her more time to review such comprehensive
reports as this one.
<P>
 Expressing his displeasure that the AQMD was singled out by the
State Legislature for these performance audits, Mr. Albright questioned
the usefulness of the audit and pointed out the redundancy of
having a consultant conduct a study to conclude that the South
Coast region has the worst air quality.  Doubtful that the majority
of legislators who voted for the performance audit actually review
it, he added that the AQMD's legislative consultant in Sacramento
should offer to brief those legislators on the audit by KPMG.
<P>
 Speaking in support of the performance audit, Mr. Paulitz expressed
his belief that the audit does what the legislature intended;
and that is to list each AQMD program and explain what is being
done in each program.  Referring to Finding No. 6 of the audit
report, he expressed disappointment that funding for the Cut Smog
and Smoking Vehicle programs have been greatly reduced.  Since
there is no mandatory requirement, he believed the State Legislature
should be encouraged to make it mandatory to repair smoking vehicles.
 Referring to Finding No. 10, which indicates that the AQMD continues
to rely on a diminishing source of revenue, he commented that
revenue from other sources will have to be increased because even
when the minimum clean air standards are met, there will still
be a need for the AQMD to insure maintenance of those standards.
<P>
 Mr. Braude agreed with Mr. Albright's remarks concerning redundancy
and the purpose of the audit.  He suggested that the audit be
referred to the Administrative Committee for review and discussion
concerning advocacy of constructive changes in the state mandate.
<P>
 At Chairman Mikels' request, Intergovernmental Affairs Officer
Catherine Witherspoon clarified that traditionally reports due
to the Legislature are submitted to the clerks on both Houses,
to the author of the bill, and to the committees which overheard
the matter.  In this instance, copies of the report could also
be sent to those members who have expressed interest in the AQMD's
financial affairs, so that they too could be offered the briefing.
<P>
Curtis Coleman addressed the Board and commented that the performance
audit report was not the type of report which he was referring
to in his earlier comments on Agenda Item <BR>
No. 11.  During those comments, one of the issues he asked to
be addressed was federal and state mandates versus permissive
programs.  While he had not yet had the opportunity to fully review
the audit report, he noticed that there was a matrix table in
Appendix B of the report purporting to identify AQMD programs
implemented pursuant to state and federal mandates--which he believed
was not entirely correct.  He suggested that for the upcoming
fiscal year, the AQMD conduct a study which would list AQMD's
programs, describing each program in an understandable manner,
and provide an evaluation of the cost and actual benefit or impact
of each program.
<P>
 Chairman Mikels added that after reviewing the audit report fully,
Mr. Coleman, as well as Ms. Soto and anyone else, could submit
comments to the Administrative Committee.  Mr. Silva added his
concurrence with Ms. Soto's comments with respect to there not
being sufficient time allowed for review of the audit report.
<P>
MR. ALBRIGHT MOVED TO RECEIVE AND FILE THE PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT,
TRANSMIT THE REPORT TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE, AND REFER THE MATTER
TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE FOR REVIEW AND DISCUSSION REGARDING
ADVOCACY OF CONSTRUCTIVE CHANGES IN LEGISLATION REQUIRING PERFORMANCE
AUDITS OF THE SCAQMD.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ,
AND PASSED BY A UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT. 
(Absent:  Loveridge and Wilson.)
<P>
31. Recommendation to Direct Executive Officer to Develop Guiding
Principles for, and an Action Plan to Streamline, District Operations
<P>
 Chairman Mikels commented that this recommendation stemmed from
his concern that while the AQMD has made significant progress
in terms of streamlining operations, reducing red tape and making
compliance with AQMD rules and regulations less onerous to the
regulated community, much more should be done.
<P>
MS. SOTO MOVED TO DIRECT THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO DEVELOP A SET
OF GUIDING PRINCIPLES TO GOVERN DISTRICT OPERATIONS AND AN ACTION
PLAN FOR REDUCING RED TAPE AND MAKING COMPLIANCE LESS ONEROUS,
AND PRESENT A DRAFT AT THE MARCH 23, 1995 ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE
MEETING FOR REVIEW AND SUBSEQUENT SUBMITTAL TO THE FULL BOARD.
 THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD AND PASSED BY A UNANIMOUS
VOTE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT.  (Absent:  Loveridge and Wilson.)
<P>
<U><B>PUBLIC HEARINGS</B></U>
<P>
32. Amend Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen and Oxides
of Sulfur
<P>
 The staff report was given by Anupom Ganguli, Senior Manager/Stationary
Source Compliance.  Dr. Ganguli noted that the Statement of Overriding
Considerations and Mitigation Monitoring (Attachment 1 to Proposed
Amended Rule 2002) had been revised to include language inadvertently
omitted by staff.  Revised copies were distributed to Board members
and made available to the public.
<P>
 The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony
from <B>Pat Fitzgibbon of ARCO's CQC Kiln </B>facility, the only
petroleum coke calciner in the South Coast Air Basin.  Speaking
in support of the proposed amendment, Mr. Fitzgibbon commended
staff for conducting a thorough technical assessment of their
facility and agreed with staff that, while ambitious, a <BR>
30 percent emission reduction is possible with urea injection
technology.
<P>
 There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P>
MS. LEE MOVED ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION NO. 95-3, CERTIFYING THE
FINAL SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND AMENDING RULE
2002, INCLUDING THE REVISED STATEMENT OF OVERRIDING CONSIDERATIONS
AND MITIGATION MONITORING, AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.  THE MOTION
WAS SECONDED BY <BR>
MR. PAULITZ AND PASSED BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT OF THE BOARD MEMBERS
PRESENT.  (Absent:  Antonovich, Loveridge and Wilson.)
<P>
33. Amend RECLAIM Rule 2011, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring,
Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur (SOx); and Amend
RECLAIM Rule 2012, Appendix A - Protocol Monitoring, Reporting,
and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)
<P>
 The staff report was given by Ms. Leyden.  In response to questions
and concerns raised by Dr. Burke, she clarified that requiring
monitoring and reporting of emissions from standby equipment would
not result in replication of emissions reporting.  Ms. Leyden
emphasized that the emissions monitoring and reporting requirement
is the basic enforcement part of the RECLAIM trading program;
and that simply &quot;tagging&quot; standby equipment would not
provide AQMD staff a way of verifying that the equipment is not
emitting NOx or SOx into the atmosphere.
<P>
(Mr. Loveridge arrived at 11:30 a.m.)
<P>
 The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony
from the following individuals:
<P>
JENNIFER COSTANZA, Texaco
<P>
ANDREW BRACKER, Western Independent Refiners Association
<P>
GLENN LINGLE, Paramount Petroleum
<P>
LEE WALLACE, The Gas Company
<P>
STAN HOLM, Mobil Oil
<P>
<U>RICK ZBUR, Regulatory Flexibility Group  </U>
<P>
 Unanimous support was expressed for the proposed amendments regarding
missing data procedures and extending the continuous emissions
monitoring system (CEMS) requirement six months for Cycle 1 major
sources.  The following issues and concerns were raised; not to
request Board action, but to make Board members aware that certain
implementation problems exist which may, in the future, require
further amendment of RECLAIM Rules:
<P>
 Because intermittently-operated units (&quot;standby equipment&quot;)
are needed on short notice, a facility cannot cut off fuel supplies
or otherwise render the equipment inoperable.  At the same time,
it seems unfair to require emissions reporting as if those units
were operating at 100 percent capacity, 24 hours per day, when
the units are actually shut down.
<P>
 Facilities interested in using Alternative CEMS (ACEMS), which
may potentially be much less expensive than CEMS, may also need
more time.  Currently, the guidance on ACEMS from the AQMD's pilot
program is scheduled to be issued on April 15.  However, ACEMS
are very complicated systems and the pilot program is the first
of its kind.  Therefore, there is some concern that this deadline
may not be met.
<P>
 It was suggested that facility operators be given an additional
option of either red-tagging standby equipment or having permit
conditions that would require the facility to give the AQMD notice
before ever operating that equipment.  During those periods of
time, missing data provisions would apply, thereby resulting in
a more conservative reporting than the CEMS.
<P>
 With respect to non-operating equipment that have CEMS, it was
suggested that facility operators be given the option of having
the CEMS send a signal to the AQMD indicating that the equipment
is not operating, rather than the more costly requirement of having
the CEMS operating and reporting zero emissions.
<P>
 Public testimony indicated the willingness of the regulated community
to continue to work with AQMD staff to arrive at mutually-agreeable
resolution of the issues raised; and, if necessary, for AQMD staff
to report back to the Board at a later date with recommendations.
<P>
 There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P>
 Mr. Braude commented that when the RECLAIM Rules were adopted,
it was understood that a certain amount of fine-tuning would be
necessary.  He believed the additional six months recommended
by staff was reasonable.  As to the other concerns raised, he
hoped that the regulated community would be able to work with
staff to achieve the most effective monitoring at the lowest possible
cost.  He was sympathetic and supportive of exploration of the
suggestions made, but believed the spirit of enforcement must
be retained if the AQMD is to fulfill its responsibility of insuring

<P>
MR. BRAUDE MOVED ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION NO. 95-5, CERTIFYING THE
NOTICE OF EXEMPTION AND AMENDING RECLAIM RULES 2011 AND 2012,
AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.  THE MOTION WAS DULY SECONDED.
<P>
 In response to Ms. Haggard, Ms. Leyden commented that while staff
does meet with refineries on a monthly basis regarding implementation
issues and has met individually with each of the applicants involved
regarding various appeals; there is not presently a formal, standing
working group.  However, there has been discussion on formation
of a working group, which staff intends to initiate.  The refinery
issues, staff believes, are unique to refineries and are probably
best handled in the existing manner, where staff meets with the
independent refiners as a group and meets with Western States
Petroleum Association as a group.
<P>
 Ms. Haggard was supportive of a working group which involved
more than just the refineries in order to insure that the issues
raised are resolved before the July 1, 1995 deadline for RECLAIM-certified
CEMS.
<P>
THE MOTION BY MR. BRAUDE TO ADOPT RESOLUTION NO. 95-4, CERTIFYING
THE NOTICE OF EXEMPTION AND AMENDING RECLAIM RULES 2011 AND 2012,
AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF PASSED BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT OF THE BOARD
MEMBERS PRESENT.<BR>
(Absent:  Wilson.)
<P>
34. Amend Rule 1121 - Control of Nitrogen Oxides from Residential
Type Natural Gas-Fired Water Heaters
<P>
 The staff report was given by Pang Mueller, Senior Manager/Stationary
Source Compliance.  After receiving public comments at the February
10, 1995 public hearing on the proposed amendments to Rule 1121,
the Board continued the hearing to March 10 and directed staff
to conduct further evaluation of the issues and recommendations
raised in the public comments.  Staff reviewed the concerns expressed
by the public, and recommended that:  (i) Subparagraph (d)(1)
be changed to specify emission testing of a single sample of one
randomly-selected unit of each model, instead of testing of three
samples of each model;  and (ii) Subparagraph (d)(6) be added
to the rule, providing an alternative option to recertification
every three years.
<P>
 There being no public testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P>
MS. LEE MOVED ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION NO. 95-5, CERTIFYING THE

(909) 396-2500
<P>
 3. Report of the Public Advisor, Small Business Assistance, and
Economic Development Offices (909) 396-3235 (Bowen)<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>This report highlights the activities of the Public Advisor,
Small Business Assistance and Economic Development Office for
the month of February 1995.</I>
<P>
</UL>
4 - 5. Set Public Hearings on May 12, 1995, to Consider Amendments
to the AQMD's Rules and Regulations, and to Adopt Any Necessary California Environmental Quality Act Documentation for the following Rule and Regulation:
<P>
(4) Amend Regulation III - Fees (Leyden) (909) 396-3120
<P>
<UL>
<I>Regulation III - Fees sets fee rates and schedules and is amended
annually to support AQMD activities and operations, subject to
a revenue cap imposed by SB 802 (Lewis).  Although California
Health and Safety Code Sections 41510.5 and 40523 authorize AQMD
to increase fees consistent with annual increases in the California
Consumer Price Index (CPI), AQMD recognizes that the recent economic
recession has adversely affected this region.  For this reason,
staff proposes no across-the-board CPI-based fee increase for
Fiscal Year 1995-96.  Proposed amendments to Rule 301 - Permit
Fees include new fee categories in Table I for 20 new equipment/processes;
modification of an additional 15 equipment/processes in Table
I, resulting in a fee decrease; and the inclusion of permit processing
fees for Non-Road Engines, Qualifying Engines, and Statewide Equipment.
 Clarifying language is proposed in additional amendments to Rule
301 and in amendments to Rules 303, 306, 307 and 308.</I>
<P>
</UL>
(5) Amend Rule - 1107 - Coating of Metal Parts and Products; and Amend Rule - 1115 - Motor Vehicle Assembly Line Coating Operations (Lockie) (909) 396-2390
<P>
<UL>
<I>The proposed amendments will address SIP deficiencies identified
by the U.S. EPA, including the reduction of VOC limits for some
coating categories</I>
<P>
</UL>
 6. Recommendation to Amend the Conflict of Interest Code of the
South Coast Air Quality Management District (Greenwald) (909) 396-2303
<P>
<UL>
<I>On February 10, 1995 the Board established the position of
Board Member Consultant.  The Board also directed staff to notice
an amendment of the AQMD's Conflict of Interest Code to enumerate
Board Member Consultant as a designated position.  Board Member
Consultants, as designated positions, will be required to file
Statements of Economic Interest pursuant to the Code and comply
with Conflict of Interest provisions of the Political Reform Act.</I>
<P>
</UL>
 7. Annual Report on Regulatory Activities for Preceding Calendar
Year 1994 Pursuant to Section 40452 of the California Health &amp; Safety Code and Annual Report on Emission Reduction Credit Transactions Pursuant
to Section 40709.5 of the California Health &amp; Safety Code (Eichhorn) (909) 396-3240
<P>
<UL>
<I>SB 1928 requires the AQMD to provide to the California Legislature
an annual summary of the AQMD's regulatory activities for the
preceding calendar year.  This report includes the following:
 a summary of each major rule and rule amendment adopted by the
AQMD Board;  the AQMD's engineering activities; and an overview
of the AQMD's budget and budgetary process.  Also included, although
not required by law, is information on the activities of the Public
Advisor's Office and information on the activities of the Technology
Advancement Office.</I>
<P>
</UL>
 8. Recommendation to Cosponsor an Epidemiologic Investigation to Identify Chronic Health Effects of Ambient Air Pollutants in Southern California (Lloyd) (909) 396-3245
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>The California Air Resources Board (ARB) has initiated a large-scale,
eight-year long follow-up research project to address one of the
critical public health issues--the chronic health impact of air
pollution on children living in Southern California.  The project
will study children in twelve Southern California communities,
eight of which are located within the boundaries of the SCAQMD.
 During the project, approximately 5,400 children enrolled in
the fourth, seventh and tenth grades will be followed for up to
eight years to determine the impact of Southern California air
pollution on children's health status and the specific pollutant
or combination of pollutants (including the ambient concentration)
responsible for the effects observed.  Funding approved by the
ARB for the project period between March 1995 through August 1998
is $5,260,000.  AQMD funding in the amount of $200,000 is proposed.</I>
<P>
</UL>
<I>The California Air Resources Board (ARB) has initiated a large-scale,
 9. Recommendation to Cosponsor the Development and Demonstration
of Energy Efficient, Ultra-Low NOx Industrial Gas Burners (Lloyd)
<P>
<UL>
<I>The development of low NOx burners has progressed to meet current
AQMD rules for boilers and heaters.  RECLAIM provides a market
opportunity for more advanced, ultra-low-emission burners to be
developed and applied.  The objective of the proposed project
is to develop and demonstrate, in a cooperative industry, government,
and university effort, advanced burner designs that could achieve
10 ppm NOx without exhaust gas after-treatment.  Staff recommends
that up to $300,000 be authorized to support this three-year program
by the University of California, Irvine.  This $3.4 million program
is being cosponsored with the California Institute for Energy
Efficiency, Southern California Gas Company, ARB, Coen Burner
Company, and North American Manufacturing Company.</I>
<P>
</UL>
10. Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for Assistance in Conference Coordination (Lloyd)
<P>
<UL>
<I>The AQMD utilizes a number of technology transfer mechanisms
including conferences, workshops and seminars to showcase advanced
air pollution control technologies and clean fuels options.  As
AQMD resources are inadequate to support all facets of such technology
transfer efforts, staff is seeking authorization to release a
RFP in the amount of $95,000 for assistance in the organization
and conduct of the AQMD's 2nd International Conference on Fuel
Cells.</I>
<P>
</UL>
11. Recommendation to Cosponsor the Demonstration of Liquefied Natural Gas in Heavy-Duty Trucks (Lloyd)
<P>
<UL>
<I>The 1994 AQMP emphasizes the use of alternative transportation
technologies as an air quality attainment strategy.  Heavy-duty
trucks represent 4 percent of the vehicle population in California,
but contribute nearly 50 percent of the NOx and over 80 percent
of the on-road particulate matter.  Staff proposes cosponsoring
a multi-vehicle demonstration of liquefied natural gas in heavy-duty
trucks.  Total cost of the demonstration is approximately $2,498,366,
with proposed AQMD cost-sharing of $200,000.</I>
<P>
</UL>
12. Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for Demonstration of Airport Ground Support Equipment Electrification (Lloyd)
<P>
<UL>
<I>The RFP solicits demonstrations in support of the 1994 AQMP
Control Measure #94MOF-06, &quot;Control of Emissions From Aircraft
and Ground Support Equipment (GSE).&quot;  Except for ground access
vehicles, major airport-related emission source categories include
aircraft and GSE.  GSE operations include a variety of equipment
that services commercial aircraft while unloading and loading
passengers and freight at the airport.  Airports are an ideal
application for electric vehicle (EV) technologies such as batteries
and fuel cells.  For battery-powered EV's, the relatively short
mileage range between charges is not an issue and airport vehicles
typically follow predictable routes.  Fuel cells can provide direct
power for EVs in GSE applications, or be used to generate near-zero-emissions
electricity to recharge battery EVs.  Furthermore, most vehicles
used at airports spend considerable time idling and accelerating.
 For gasoline and diesel, this means fuel is used inefficiently,
accompanied by significant emissions.  Electric GSE would use
energy only when moving, resulting in a much cleaner and efficient
operation.  Most airport GSE are currently unregulated.  Staff
recommends releasing this RFP for a total amount not to exceed
$500,000.</I>
<P>
</UL>
13. Status Report on AQMD Listing of Environmental Documents and Lead Agency Projects Received by the AQMD for Review and Comment (Broadbent) (909) 396-3789
<P>
<UL>
<I>This report provides a monthly listing of environmental documents
received by the AQMD, and a summary of projects for which the
AQMD is preparing environmental documentation.  AQMD review and
comment are subject to the screening criteria established by the
Governing Board in March 1990.  This document also evaluates the
Lead Agency response to AQMD comments.</I>
<P>
</UL>
14. Eighth Semi-Annual Report of the Coachella Valley PM10 Technical Working Group (Broadbent)
<P>
<UL>
<I>As part of Resolution 90-49, adopting the 1990 State Implementation
Plan (SIP) for PM10 in the Coachella Valley, the AQMD Governing
Board established a Technical Working Group (TWG) to evaluate
technical information and to resolve technical issues encountered
during SIP implementation and its subsequent 1994 revision.  One
of the requirements of the TWG is to prepare semi-annual progress
reports to the AQMD Governing Board and the Coachella Valley Association
of Government's Executive Committee.  This is the eighth semi-annual
report and covers the period of July 1, 1994 through December
31, 1994.</I>
<P>
</UL>
15. Recommendation to Award a Contract to Enhance Marine Vessels
Emissions Inventory and Further Evaluate Specific Control Strategies
(Broadbent)
<P>
<UL>
<I>At its January 1995 meeting, the Board approved the release
of a RFP for a study to enhance marine vessels emissions inventory
and to further evaluate specific control strategies.  A total
of twelve proposals were submitted to the AQMD and evaluated by
a panel comprised of AQMD staff and representatives from the EPA,
ARB, and the Ports.  Staff recommends that the Board award the
contract to the successful bidder.  Funding is included in Planning
and Policy's <BR>
FY 1994-95 budget.</I>

<UL>
<I>In 1988 and 1990 the AQMD acquired Multiflow Trace computers
in order to run the Urban Airshed Model for ozone attainment demonstrations.
 The Multiflow Corporation has ceased operations, and adequate
support for these computers can no longer be obtained.  Staff
recommends replacement of these obsolete systems with a new Scientific
Computer.  Funding of $100,000 has been identified in the FY 1994-95
Budget for this replacement.</I>

<A HREF="mailto:vinitam@aqmd.gov"><img Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></a> ( vinitam@aqmd.gov )<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>At its June 10, 1994 meeting the Board approved awarding bids
for systems development services to Accurate Information Systems,
Inc. and Telos Consulting Services.  These contracts are Basic
Ordering Agreement arrangements, where individual task orders
are issued.  Terms of the contracts are for a period of one year,
with optional renewals for two years thereafter.  To award the
next set of task orders, staff recommends amending the contracts
to increase the amount of funding by $170,500 each for a total
increase of $341,000.  Appropriate funds are available in the
FY 1994-95 budget of Planning, Transportation and Information
Management.</I>

<P>
20. Recommendation to Release a Request for Proposals to Review or
Prepare the Air Toxics &quot;Hot Spots&quot; Information and Assessment
Act (AB 2588) Health Risk Assessments (Leyden)
<P>
<UL>
<I>This RFP seeks qualified contractors to assist the AQMD in
reviewing or preparing AB 2588 health risk assessments.  Funds
for this RFP are available from the AB 2588 program.  Qualified
contractors must be familiar with risk assessment guidelines and
procedures and have no conflict of interest.  This RFP will accelerate
the health risk assessment approval process by having qualified
contractors review or prepare health risk assessments to augment
limited AQMD resources.  More than one contractor may be selected
to satisfy part or all of this RFP.</I>
<P>
</UL>
21. Recommendation Regarding the AQMD's Program Cost Estimate
for Implementing the Air Toxics &quot;Hot Spots&quot; Information
and Assessment Act (AB 2588) During Fiscal Year 1995-96 (Lockie)
(909) 396-2390
<P>
<UL>
<I>The Air Toxics &quot;Hot Spots&quot; Information and Assessment
Act (AB 2588) requires air districts to transmit annually to the
ARB and AQMD Board-approved cost estimate for local program implementation.
 This estimate will be combined with state projected costs to
set fees for next year's statewide program.  The AQMD cost estimate
for FY 1995-96 is based on the three-year AQMD budget projection
and costs incurred during FY 1994-95.  Staff recommends approval
of this cost estimate and its transmittal to ARB.</I>
</UL>
<P>
22. Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for Small Business 
Assistance Fund Consulting Services (Fray) (909) 396-3030
<P>
<UL>
<I>The AQMD is required, pursuant to state law, to guaranty and/or
help provide financial assistance for small businesses through
the Air Quality Assistance Fund (AQAF).  Because of the complex
and highly-specialized nature of commercial loans, the services
of an outside financial consultant are critical have been used
since the AQAF program was initiated in March of 1991.  The RFP
is for continued consulting services not to exceed $80,000 for
one year and $50,000 for an optional second year.</I>
</UL>
<P>
23. Recommendation to Execute Lease for South Bay Field Office
(Jason) (909) 396-2065
<P>
<UL>
<I>The AQMD field office in Cerritos houses staff who inspect
the nearby refineries.  The lease on the office will expire March
31, 1995.  Staff  recommends leasing office space in the South
Bay area closer to the refineries.  It is estimated that the cost
of a three-year lease will be $149,688.</I>
<P>
</UL>
23(A) Recommendation to Internalize AQMD's Legislative Functions
(Eichhorn) (909) 396-3240
<P>
<UL>
<I>Staff seeks to internalize the AQMD's legislative operations.
 If approved by the Board, staff will take four specific actions.
 First, staff will assume legislative representation in Sacramento.
 Second, staff will create a classification for &quot;Legislative
Program Analyst&quot; and hire one individual in that class, using
a vacant position from the Stationary Source Compliance Division
currently classified as &quot;Air Quality Inspector II&quot;.
 Third, staff will retain temporary secretarial services to support
Sacramento legislative activities.  Finally, funds in the amount
of $115,757 will be transferred from lobbying contracts in the
AQMD's proposed FY 1995-96 budget to the appropriate accounts
in Intergovernmental Affairs to cover these staffing changes.
 The net fiscal effect of these changes will be a savings of $70,155
in FY 1995-96 and an additional savings of $34,968 in FY 1996-97.</I>

Fiscal Year 1993-94 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program (909) 396-3240
<P>
<UL>
<I>As part of its Fiscal Year 1993-94 AB 2766 Discretionary Work
Program, the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee
created a program designed to encourage the county transportation
commissions to spend Surface Transportation Program, Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, and Air Quality Improvements
funds on transportation control measures.  This ISTEA/TCM Partnership
Program allocated approximately $1 million to each of the four
commissions.  At its meeting on March 23, 1995, the MSRC approved
an amendment to the ISTEA/TCM contract for the Orange County Transportation
Authority to delete 2 of 12 projects and add 1 new project.  Since
the new project was not originally included as part of the FY
1993-94 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program, this contract change
must be approved by the District Board.</I>

of Nitrogen from Industrial, Institutional and Commercial Boilers,
Steam Generators and Process Heaters
<P>
<B>Frank Caponi, Los Angeles County Sanitation District,</B> addressed
the Board and expressed concern that the recent inclusion of solid
fuels in the proposed amended rule would bring in a new universe
of sources that were never meant to be regulated by Rule 1146.
William Fray, Assistant DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, responded
that solid fuels were included at the request of the Air Resources
Board (ARB). Staff was subsequently notified by the ARB that it
was not its intention to broaden the rule to regulate equipment,
such as municipal incinerators, already regulated by other rules.
At the public hearing on May 13, staff will propose amended rule
language to address the concern expressed by Mr. Caponi.
<P>
11. Recommendation to Amend Sole-Source Contract for Legislative
Outreach Assistance
<P>
In response to Mr. Younglove's comment that Board members should
be provided with regular updates on the progress of various bills,
Dr. Lents explained that the primary purpose of this particular
contract was to strengthen the District's outreach efforts with
legislators and their staffs.
<P>
17. Recommendation to Cost-Share the Implementation of Alternative
Fuel Vehicles in a Rental Car Fleet
<P>
<B>Andrew Hirsch of The Gas Company</B> addressed the Board and
expressed opposition to the expenditure of $400,000 for the purchase
of methanol-powered vehicles. He recommended that this item be
returned to staff for further analysis. In response, Mr. Albright
and Mr. Paulitz commented that the recommendation by staff was
to provide funding towards furthering the infrastructure to make
methanol a more usable fuel; not underwriting the purchase of
vehicles.
<P>
19. Recommendation to Cost-Share Allied Signal Aerospace's Program
for the Research and Development of a Proton Exchange Membrane
Fuel Cell System for Transportation Applications
<P>
James Lents, Ph.D., Executive Officer, pointed out that the amount
of non-District funding to be provided for this program was $6
million instead of the $9 million indicated in the agenda.
<P>
10. Audit Report for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1993
<P>
In response to a question by Ms. Wieder, Patrick Pearce, Finance
Director, indicated that staff was taking steps to implement the
auditor's recommendation to adopt a written policy containing
the District's monitoring procedures over emission fees and permits
to operate. <BR>
Ms. Wieder supported the auditor's recommendation, and expressed
her belief that the response by District staff contained in the
report (<I>&quot;....study this recommendation to determine if
its implementation would be appropriate.&quot;</I>) did not express
definitive concurrence for action.
<P>
22(A) Recommendation to Reaffirm District Support for California's
Low Emission Vehicle and Clean Fuels Program
<P>
Chairman Wedaa noted that two minor revisions had been made to
the proposed Resolution reaffirming the District's support for
California's Low Emission Vehicle and Clean Fuels Program. Copies
of the revisions were distributed to Board members and staff,
and made available for the public.
<P>

*Submitted Written Comments
<P>
There was no opposition expressed regarding the proposed amendments,
which would establish new interim limits for coatings and sealers
formulated without 1,1,1-trichloroethane and provide a two-year
exemption for classic guitar manufacturing and furniture refinishing.
<BR>
Messrs. Chaddock, Perez, and Blackstone requested that the Board
include custom replica furniture operations in the exemption for
furniture refinishing because the water-based coatings presently
available are completely inadequate. It was pointed out that exempting
custom replica furniture from Rule 1136 requirements would not
have a significant effect on the air quality in the basin since
there are only four main manufacturers of this type of furniture
located in the basin, with a total of approximately 250 pounds
per day of VOCs (approximately 0.04 percent of the total).
<P>
There was, however, substantial testimony presented by coating
manufacturers and wood products manufacturers regarding the unavailability
of workable topcoats and sealers that will comply with the 275
grams-per-liter (g/L) volatile organic compound (VOC) limit which
becomes effective July 1, 1994 and supply all the needs of the
diverse wood products industry. The key comments made in this
regard were:
<P>
The recent demonstration project conducted at Southern California
Edison's CTAC only demonstrated that the waterborne coatings tested
will work, to some extent, in the limited environment of a coatings
laboratory, which bears little resemblance to actual production
facilities. Also, many of the coatings demonstrated are not yet
in commercial production.
<P>
There are many difficult problems with waterborne coatings yet
to overcome, including: drying time, coating thickness, penetration,
subsequent adhesion to coatings, recoating, grain raising, touch-up,
clarity, appearance, durability, and storage and transport of
products that have been coated with waterborne coatings.
<P>
There are coating manufacturers that have demonstrated compliant
products, but they do not have the technical capacity to convert
coatings systems at each individual facility over to waterborne
within the next two months.
<P>
The CTAC project focused on waterborne topcoats and sealers; and
not the entire waterborne coating system. For example, it may
be necessary for the wood product manufacturer to purchase (at
a considerable cost) specific drying equipment. More time is necessary
for development of waterborne systems.
<P>
Many of the waterborne coatings that were tested at CTAC contain
a chemical, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, which is proposed
to be added to the list of toxic air contaminants contained in
Rule 1401 and Proposed Rule 1402.
<P>
The RECLAIM Rules for VOCs, which is expected to come before the
Board for adoption within the next year, would affect 154 furniture
manufacturers. If included in RECLAIM, these manufacturers would
not have to convert to waterborne coatings; but would be allowed
to use their existing nitrocellulose coatings.
<P>
With the exception of Mr. Maligie, who testified that Alternative
Materials Technology has the ability to meet the needs of the
market place, individuals from the coating industry and the wood
product manufacturing industry asked that the Board consider extending
the effective date for the 275 g/L VOC limit to July 1, 1996.
<P>
(Dr. Burke arrived at 12:25 p.m., during public testimony.)
<P>
In response to the comments made, Mr. Fray stated that while staff
was aware that there might be some coatings--such as coatings
that have to withstand outdoor conditions--that would require
special consideration, a categorical extension was not mentioned
at the Rule 1136 public workshops held on January 19 and August
10, 1993. Dr. Lents added that it would take staff approximately
60 to 90 days to determine the amount of emissions involved, perform
a CEQA analysis on the impacts of the requested extension, and
bring a proposal back to the Board for consideration.
<P>
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P>
MR. YOUNGLOVE MOVED TO:
<P>
1) ADOPT RESOLUTION NO. 94-13, CERTIFYING THE FINAL SUPPLEMENTAL
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND AMENDING RULE 1136 AS RECOMMENDED,
WITH THE FOLLOWING MODIFICATIONS:
<P>
<I>-- Change the effective date of the 275 g/L VOC limit for clear
topcoats from July 1, 1994 to <U>August 15, 1994.</U></I> 
<P>
<I>-- Provide an exemption for antique furniture until July 1,
1995 as requested during the public testimony.</I> 
<P>
Subsequent to the meeting, staff provided the following amended
language for Rule 1136:
<P>
<I>-- Add Section (j)(5) as follows</I> 
<P>
<I><B>&quot;Refinishing, Replacement, and Custom Replica Furniture
Operations: Until July 1, 1996, the provisions of Sections (b)(1)
shall not apply to any refinishing operation necessary for preservation,
to return the wood product to original condition, to replace missing
furniture to produce a matching set, or to produce custom replica
furniture, provided records are maintained for two years as to
the amount, type and VOC content of each coating used daily.&quot;</B></I>

<P>
2) DIRECT STAFF TO SET A PUBLIC HEARING FOR THE JUNE 10, 1994
OR JULY 8, 1994 BOARD MEETING ON FURTHER AMENDMENTS TO RULE 1136
WITH RESPECT TO EFFECTIVE DATES FOR VOC LIMITS.
<P>

32. Amend Rule 1401 - New Source Review of Carcinogenic Air Contaminants;
and Adopt Proposed Rule 1402 - Control of Toxic Air Contaminants
from Existing Sources
<P>
Chairman Wedaa asked that Board members comment on any ex parte
communications of new information they had received on this item
since the closing of public testimony at the February 11, 1994
Board meeting. In response, Mr. Antonovich submitted for the record
a copy of comments he had received by fax from SCEC and Caterpillar,
Inc. regarding Proposed Amended Rule 1401.
<P>
MR. PAULITZ MOVED TO AMEND RULE 1401 AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF,
INCLUDING THE ADDENDUM DATED APRIL 8, 1994. THE MOTION WAS SECONDED
BY MR. BRAUDE.
<P>
MR. MIKELS MOVED TO AMEND THE MAIN MOTION TO DELAY ACTION FOR
SIX MONTHS, PENDING THE STUDY ON THE IMPACT OF THE AMENDED RULE
ON SMALL BUSINESSES. THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. WEDAA.
<P>
Mr. Braude pointed out that staff's first recommendation to the
Board on this item was at the July 1993 Board meeting; and he
expressed opposition to any further delays in action by the Board.
<P>
THE MOTION BY MR. MIKELS TO AMEND THE MAIN MOTION FAILED, BY THE
FOLLOWING VOTE:
<P>
AYES: Albright, Antonovich, Burke, Mikels, Wedaa, and Wieder.

23. Legislation Committee Report and Recommendations
<P>
Dr. Wilson suggested that the Board adopt an &quot;oppose&quot;
position on Assembly Bill 3255, instead of the &quot;watch&quot;
position recommended by the Committee. He expressed his belief
that this bill (which would remove the Coachella Valley from the
District and place it under the jurisdiction of the Mojave Desert
AQMD) would be disastrous for the Coachella Valley's air quality.
After Dr. Wilson and District staff met with the author of the
bill on March 25, he believed the bill would be changed to only
require a study on the issue; however, the bill has not been changed.
<P>
MS. WIEDER MOVED APPROVAL OF THE LEGISLATION COMMITTEE REPORTS

35. Amend Rule 1403 - Asbestos Emissions from Demolition/Renovation
Activities
<P>
Alene Taber, Program Supervisor/Stationary Source Compliance,
gave the staff report. Staff distributed to Board members copies
of minor modifications to the proposed amended rule which were
prepared by staff in response to comments from the public. Copies
of the recommended modifications were also made available to the
public.
<P>
The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from
the following individuals:
<P>
*JOYCE KERLY, California State Universities
<P>
RICHARD HENRY, Los Angeles Unified School District
<P>
MICHAEL GEYER, SCS Engineers
<P>
BOB LANDRETH, Total Environmental
<P>
<U>DAVE STEFKO, Roofing Contractors Association </U>
<P>
*Submitted Written Comments
<P>
The following issues and recommendations were raised during public
testimony:
<P>
The requirement in Subparagraph (d)(1)(B)(vi)(IV) to notify the
District when a planned demolition or renovation is completed
ahead of schedule should be changed so that the person(s) completing
the job does not incur any additional expenses.
<P>
It was suggested that the following corrections/additions be made
to the citations referenced in the proposed amended rule:
<P>
-- Add to Subparagraph (i)(3): <U><I>&quot;40 CFR Part 763</I></U>,
which became effective April 4, 1994.
<P>
-- Change the reference in Subparagraph (j)(4) from <I>&quot;Section
341.15</I>&quot; to <U><I>&quot;Section 9021.5</I></U>&quot;;
and the reference to <I>&quot;(i)(4)&quot;</I> should be changed
to <I>&quot;<U>(d)(1)(A)</U>&quot;</I>.
<P>
The requirement in Subparagraph (d)(1)(E) that containers for
asbestos-containing waste materials (ACWM) be transparent should
be deleted because of the additional costs required to obtain
specially-designed containers..
<P>
In addition, Ms. Kerly requested that Subparagraph (d)(1)(A)(viii)
be changed to require that persons conducting asbestos surveys
either be certified by CAL/OSHA <U>or</U> pass an EPA-approved
building inspector course, instead of requiring both. Mr. Geyer
urged the Board to adopt Subparagraph (d)(1)(A)(viii) as proposed
by staff, in order to maintain the quality of the surveys.
<P>
Staff indicated agreement with Mr. Henry with respect to the corrections/additions
to the citations referenced in the proposed amended rule. In response
to the concerns expressed by<BR>
Mr. Landreth regarding the transparency requirement, staff clarified
that it was not necessary for the entire container to be transparent.
The intent of this amendment was that there be a transparent porthole
or area on the ACWM containers so that the inspector could view
the material without having to open the container and risk the
possibility of inhaling asbestos fibers. Staff believed that imposing
an effective date of August 12, 1994 would allow industry adequate
time to obtain the required containers. However, staff was agreeable
to working with industry further on this issue, and reporting
back to the Board in two months on staff's findings and, if necessary,
a recommendation to amend Subparagraph (d)(1)(E) of the rule.
Staff was also agreeable to re-evaluating notification of early
completion of a planned renovation or demolition and re-addressing
this issue as well in two months.
<P>
MR. MIKELS MOVED TO:
<P>
1) ADOPT RESOLUTION NO. 94-15, AMENDING RULE 1403 AND CERTIFYING
THE EXEMPTION FROM CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT REQUIREMENTS,
AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF, INCLUDING THE CHANGES RECOMMENDED BY
STAFF AND THE FOLLOWING MODIFICATIONS:
<P>
-- Add to Subparagraph (i)(3): <U><I>&quot;40 CFR Part 763</I></U>.
<P>
-- Change the reference in Subparagraph (j)(4) from <I>&quot;Section
341.15</I>&quot; to <U><I>&quot;Section 9021.5</I></U>&quot;;
and the reference to <I>&quot;(i)(4)&quot;</I> should be changed
to <I>&quot;<U>(d)(1)(A)(viii)</U>&quot;</I>.
<P>
-- Implement Subparagraph (d)(1)(B)(vi)(IV) consistent with EPA's
policy.
<P>
2) DIRECT STAFF TO REPORT BACK TO THE BOARD AT THE JUNE 10, 1994
BOARD MEETING WITH STAFF'S FINDINGS REGARDING THE ACWM CONTAINER
TRANSPARENCY ISSUE.
<P>
THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. ALBRIGHT, AND PASSED BY THE FOLLOWING
VOTE:
<P>
AYES: Albright, Braude, Mikels, Paulitz, Wedaa, Wieder, and Younglove.
<P>
NOES: None.
<P>
ABSENT: Antonovich, Burke, Lee, and Wilson.
<P>
-o-
<P>
Peter Greenwald, District Counsel, noted that upon further reflection,
staff realized that the Board's earlier action which provided
a deferral from the action risk level in Rule 1402 for metal finishers
has no effect because included in the main motion amending Rule
1402 was the deletion of the action risk level. Therefore, allowing
a deferral of the action risk level has no effect. Staff recommended,
in order to avoid confusion, that the Board vote to rescind the
motion allowing the deferral for metal finishers. Mr. Greenwald
added that, in the future, he intends to advise the Board against
reopening a matter under such circumstances because the public
was given an erroneous impression that the Board's consideration
of Rule 1402 had been completed.
<P>
CHAIRMAN WEDAA MOVED TO RECONSIDER THE BOARD'S ACTION ON RULE
1402, AND RESCIND THE BOARD'S PREVIOUS ACTION ALLOWING A DEFERRAL
FROM THE ACTION RISK LEVEL IN RULE 1402 FOR METAL FINISHERS. THE
MOTION WAS DULY SECONDED, AND PASSED BY THE FOLLOWING VOTE:
<P>
AYES: Albright, Braude, Mikels, Paulitz, Wedaa, Wieder, and Younglove.
<P>
NOES: None.
<P>

<P>
5. Amend Rule 462 - Organic Liquid Loading (Lockie) (909) 396-2390
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>The proposed amendment has been developed to implement the
Emission Reductions from Organic Liquid Transfer and Loading Control
Measure of the 1994 AQMP and to correct deficiencies in the existing
rule as required by EPA. The amendment proposes to reduce VOC
emissions at large bulk loading facilities, and to establish self-auditing
requirements for monthly leak inspections.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
6. Amend Regulation XXX -Title V Permits and Amend Rule 518 - Hearing Board Procedures for Title V Facilities (Leyden) (909) 396-3120 <BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>The proposed amendments to Regulation XXX and Rule 518 are
needed to address changes identified by EPA as necessary to obtain
interim program approval. These changes include: (a) using a facility's
Potential to Emit rather than reported actual emissions to determine
if a facility is a major source five years after program approval
unless a SIP-approved District rule is adopted, in the future,
to exempt these sources from Title V; (b) moving variance provisions
from Regulation XXX to Rule 518; (c) clarifying that NSR permits
must meet all necessary Title V compliance requirements at the
time of issuance; and (d) reducing the emissions cutoff for group
processing of minor permit revisions.</I>

10. Response to the Triennial Performance Audit of the AQMD for
(Pearce)<BR>
Fiscal Years 1991-92, 1992-93, 1993-94 (909) 396-2828
<P>
<UL>
<I>Health and Safety Code Section 40453 requires the AQMD to contract
with a qualified firm every three years to conduct a performance
audit of AQMD activities. The audit report was presented to the
Governing Board on March 10, 1995. Staff prepared a response to
the findings noted in the Triennial Performance Audit. This recommendation
was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on April
21, 1995.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
11. Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for Demonstration of Alternative Fuels in Commercial Rental Fleet Operations
(Lloyd) (909) 396-3245 <BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>This Request for Proposals (RFP) would support the introduction
of Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs) into daily rental car fleets
by co-funding the installation of fueling stations and documentation
of the AFVs in rental car service. The rental car industry purchases
a large number of new vehicles annually, has an accelerated vehicle
fleet turnover, and provides a stable supply for the used car
market in Southern California. The ARB has estimated that rental
car and leasing companies may account for as much as 90 percent
of the total fleet sales annually. The rental car industry yields
significant buying power that would assist the expansion of the
alternative fuels marketplace. The accelerated purchase of AFVs
supports the development of public refueling and original equipment
servicing infrastructures. Staff recommends releasing an RFP in
an amount not to exceed $500,000 for the demonstration of AFVs
in commercial rental fleets. The RFP specifies a minimum of 50
percent cost-sharing from the proponents. This recommendation
was reviewed and approved by the Technology Committee on April
12, 1995.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
12. Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for the Demonstration
of Alternative Fuels in Heavy-Duty Trucks (Lloyd)
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>This RFP solicits demonstration projects in support of the
1994 AQMP Control Measures #94MON-06, &quot;Emissions Reduction
Credit for Heavy-Duty Trucks&quot; and #94MON-08, &quot;Further
NOx Reductions for Heavy-Duty Engines.&quot; Heavy-duty trucks
(HDT) account for 4 percent of the vehicle population in California,
but contribute nearly 50 percent of the NOx emissions and over
80 percent of the on-road particulate matter as projected by the
ARB for the year 2010. As a result, NOx emissions from heavy-duty
vehicles are a substantial barrier to attaining air quality standards.
The objective of this RFP is to develop and demonstrate the use
of clean fuel engines capable of being certified at or below 2.5
g/bhp-hr NOx. Staff recommends releasing this RFP for an amount
not to exceed $1,000,000. This RFP specifies a minimum of 50 percent
cost-sharing from the participating agencies and companies. This
recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Technology Committee
on April 12, 1995.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
13. Recommendation to Cosponsor the Development and Demonstration
of a Natural Gas Retrofit Kit for Heavy-Duty Engines (Lloyd)
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>The 1994 AQMP emphasizes the use of alternative transportation
technologies as an air quality attainment strategy. Although alternative
fuels, such as natural gas, can provide significant emissions
benefits when used in heavy-duty engines, availability of new
natural gas engines is very limited and costly. Staff proposes
cosponsoring the development and demonstration of a natural gas
retrofit kit for heavy-duty engines with Thermo Power Corporation,
Tecogen Division. Total cost of this effort is $1,385,004, with
AQMD funding not to exceed $156,755. The emissions goal for the
proposed retrofit kit is 2.5 grams NOx per brake horsepower-hour,
less than one-half the current standard for new engines. This
recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Technology Committee
on April 12, 1995.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
14. Recommendation to Cosponsor Phase III Development and
Demonstration of Fleet Electric Vehicles (Lloyd)
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>Motive, a Southern California company, has initiated a four-phase,
multi-year project to develop and demonstrate a new fleet electric
mini-van based upon the Japanese &quot;Kei&quot; class van. This
narrow mini-van is used in Japan and Europe for commercial applications
but not in the US. This project involves conversion of new, incomplete
Subaru mini-vans to electric drivetrains. The AQMD cosponsored
the successful bidding of the first prototype during Phase II
($50,000). Staff now recommends that $250,000 be approved to cosponsor
Phase III ($3,000,000) which involves final design and safety
certification of the electric mini-van. Other cosponsors for this
phase are Motive ($2,400,000), Subaru ($250,000) and Delco Propulsion
Systems ($100,000). This recommendation was reviewed and approved
by the Technology Committee on April 12, 1995.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
15. Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for Assistance
in Conference Coordination (Lloyd)
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>The AQMD utilizes a number of technology transfer mechanisms
including conferences, workshops and seminars to showcase advanced
air pollution control technologies and clean fuels options. As
AQMD resources are inadequate to support all facets of such technology
transfer efforts, staff is seeking authorization to release a
RFP in the amount of $95,000 for assistance in the organization
and conduct of the AQMD's 2nd International Conference on Fuel
Cells. This recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Technology
Committee on March 8, 1995.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
16. Status Report on AQMD Listing of Environmental Documents and Lead Agency Projects Received by the AQMD for Review and Comment 
(Broadbent) (909) 396-3789
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>This report provides a monthly listing of environmental documents
received by the AQMD, and a summary of projects for which the
AQMD is preparing environmental documentation. AQMD review and
comment are subject to the screening criteria established by the
Governing Board in March 1990. This document also evaluates the
Lead Agency response to AQMD comments.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
17. Recommendation to Award Bid to Support the AQMD's Assessment
of Competitiveness Impacts of Air Quality Regulations (Broadbent)
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>At its December 9, 1994 meeting, the Board approved the recirculation
of a RFP regarding assessing the impacts of air quality regulations
on business competitiveness. Based on a review of the submitted
proposals, staff recommends that the Board award a contract to
the successful bidder as outlined. Funding is included in the
FY 1994-95 Budget. This recommendation was reviewed and approved
by the Administrative Committee on April 21, 1995.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
18. Review of Rule 1610 - Old Vehicle Scrapping (Broadbent)
<P>
<UL>
<I>At its February 1994 meeting the Board directed staff to report
back on the implementation of this rule, adopted in January 1993
and amended in February 1994. Staff has prepared a report which
reviews Rule 1610 program activities over the past year and analyzes
the impacts of the 1994 amendments on the procurement, cost, and
processing of old vehicles.</I> 
</UL>

<A HREF="mailto:vinitam@aqmd.gov"> <img Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></a> ( vinitam@aqmd.gov )<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>At its June 10, 1994 meeting, the Board approved awarding bids
for systems development services to Accurate Information Systems,
Inc. and Telos Consulting Services. These contracts are basic
ordering agreement arrangements, where individual task orders
are issued on an as-needed basis. Accurate Information Systems,
Inc. has opted to discontinue conducting business in the State
of California, consequently, an alternate contractor is required.
Staff recommends executing a contract with Mosakin Corporation,
the next highest ranking company from the original bidder's list,
to continue performing the required systems development contract
work. This recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Administrative
Committee on April 21, 1995.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
20. Recommendation to Provide Future Update Training Session to Employee Transportation Coordinators as Required by Rule 1501 
(Wasikowski) (909) 396-3264
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>As its April 7, 1995 meeting, the Mobile Source Committee recommended
that the Board review how the administrative support of update
training sessions for employee transportation coordinators will
be handled upon the expiration of the current contract on June
30, 1995. Currently a contractor makes arrangements to provide
classroom spaces, pre-registration materials, enrollment and confirmation
of attendees, while District staff provides the instructors.</I>

21. Rule Forecast Report (Leyden) (909) 396-3120
<BR>
<P>
22. Report to the Governing Board on Compliance of RECLAIM<BR>
with Federal New Source Review Requirements (Leyden)
<P>
<UL>
<I>Rule 2005(j) requires the Executive Officer to report to the
Governing Board, by May of each year, on the effectiveness of
RECLAIM New Source Review (NSR) in meeting the federal NSR requirements
for the preceding year. This report details the AQMD's success
in meeting federal NSR requirements for 1994.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
23. Recommendation to Receive and Appropriate Funds from the Air Resources Board for the Operation of Monitoring Sites for the Children's Health Study in the South Coast Air Basin
(Liu) (909) 396-2105<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>The ARB has asked the AQMD to assume the operation of eight
monitoring sites established for its ten-year Children's Health
Study. ARB will provide $150,000 in the first year to take over
the operations of the stations. Staff recommends that the Board
recognize the $150,000 from ARB and appropriate these funds to
the Applied Science and Technology FY 1994-95 Budget. This recommendation
was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on April
21, 1995.</I> 
</UL>
<P>

25(A) Recommendation to Approve Funding for a Backup Project as
an Amendment to the Fiscal Year 1994-95 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program
and Authorize the Board Chairman to Execute an Agreement 
(Longville) (909) 396-3237
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>When the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee
(MSRC) submitted its FY 1994-95 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program
to the Governing Board for approval, the MSRC also included a
backup list of projects eligible for funding in case additional
revenues became available. In fact, the MSRC has identified at
minimum an additional $500,000 revenue. Consequently, on April
27, 1995, the MSRC approved $504,000 in funding for the first
project on the backup list which provides differential funding
for the City of Los Angeles/Department of Transportation to purchase
five electric buses. Final funding approval of this backup project
must be obtained from the Governing Board since it is part of
the FY 1994-95 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program. Therefore,
this recommendation is to request that the Governing Board approve
an amendment to the FY 1994-95 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program
to include the City of Los Angeles/Department of Transportation
Proposal #3-8 with $504,000 in funding and authorize the Chairman
of the Board to execute an agreement for this project.</I>

36. Amend Regulation III - Fees (Leyden) (909) 396-3120
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>Regulation III - Fees sets fee rates and schedules and is amended
annually to support AQMD activities and operations, subject to
a revenue cap imposed by SB 802 (Lewis). Although California Health
and Safety Code Sections 41510.5 and 40523 authorize AQMD to increase
fees consistent with annual increases in the California Consumer
Price Index (CPI), AQMD recognizes that the recent economic recession
has adversely affected this region. For this reason, staff proposes
no across-the-board CPI-based fee increase for Fiscal Year 1995-96.
Proposed amendments to Rule 301 - Permit Fees include new fee
categories in Table I for 20 new equipment/processes; modification
of an additional 15 equipment/processes in Table I, resulting
in a fee decrease; and the inclusion of permit processing fees
for Non-Road Engines, Qualifying Engines, and Statewide Equipment.
Clarifying language is proposed in additional amendments to Rule
301 and in amendments to Rules 303, 306, 307 and 308.</I>

39. Recommendation to Cost-Share the Development of a Methanol Refueling Network 
(Lloyd) (909) 396-3245
<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<I>There are approximately 7,500 fuel flexible vehicles operating
in Southern California. That number is expected to increase to
more than 15,000 in the next three years. There are currently
34 public methanol refueling stations in Southern California.
The proposed contract is a joint effort between the AQMD and the
California Energy Commission to establish up to 15 additional
sites in the next two years. Staff recommends award of a sole-source
contract to Acurex Environmental Corporation, not to exceed $510,000,
($410,000 Fiscal Year 1994-95, and $100,000 FY 1995-96) for the
development of a methanol refueling network in Southern California.
This recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Technology
Committee on April 12, 1995.</I>

Set Public Hearings to Consider Amendments to the AQMD's Rules
and Regulations, and to Adopt Any Necessary California
Environmental Quality Act Documentation for the Following Rules: 
 
On June 9, 1995 
 
 5.	Amend Rule 462 - Organic Liquid Loading	(Lockie)
(909) 396-2390 
 
The proposed amendment has been developed to implement the Emission Reductions 
from Organic Liquid Transfer and Loading Control Measure of the 1994 AQMP and to 
correct deficiencies in the existing rule as required by EPA.  The amendment proposes to 
reduce VOC emissions at large bulk loading facilities, and to establish self-auditing 
requirements for monthly leak inspections. 
 
 
 


 
 
 6.	Amend Regulation XXX -Title V Permits and	(Leyden)
	Amend Rule 518 - Hearing Board Procedures for Title V Facilities	(909) 396-3120 
 
The proposed amendments to Regulation XXX and Rule 518 are needed to address 
changes identified by EPA as necessary to obtain interim program approval.  These 
changes include:  (a) using a facility's Potential to Emit rather than reported actual 
emissions to determine if a facility is a major source five years after program approval 
unless a SIP-approved District rule is adopted, in the future, to exempt these sources 
from Title V;  (b) moving variance provisions from Regulation XXX to Rule 518;  (c) 
clarifying that NSR permits must meet all necessary Title V compliance requirements at 
the time of issuance;  and (d) reducing the emissions cutoff for group processing of minor 
permit revisions. 
 
 
 
On July 14, 1995 
 
 7.	Amend Rule 1149 - Storage Tank Degassing	(Fray)
(909) 396-3030 
 
The proposed amendments will require that degassed tanks be sent to a certified site for 
scrapping and will make the rule applicable to tanks that have been relocated prior to 
degassing. 
 
 
 
 8.	Amend Rule 1166 - Emissions from Decontamination of Soil	(Fray) 
 
Amendments are proposed to prevent tank removal sites from being abandoned and left 
to pollute over the long term.  Procedures to be followed upon discovering contaminated 
soil will be clarified. 
 
 
 
 9.	Report of Civil Actions Filed	(Love)
(909) 396-3400 
 
 
 
10.	Response to the Triennial Performance Audit of the AQMD for	(Pearce)
Fiscal Years 1991-92, 1992-93, 1993-94	(909) 396-2828 
 
Health and Safety Code Section 40453 requires the AQMD to contract with a qualified firm 
every three years to conduct a performance audit of AQMD activities.  The audit report was 
presented to the Governing Board on March 10, 1995.  Staff prepared a response to the findings 
noted in the Triennial Performance Audit.  This recommendation was reviewed and approved by 
the Administrative Committee on April 21, 1995. 
 
 
 


 
11.	Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for Demonstration	(Lloyd)
of Alternative Fuels in Commercial Rental Fleet Operations	(909) 396-3245 
 
This Request for Proposals (RFP) would support the introduction of Alternative Fuel Vehicles 
(AFVs) into daily rental car fleets by co-funding the installation of fueling stations and 
documentation of the AFVs in rental car service.  The rental car industry purchases a large 
number of new vehicles annually, has an accelerated vehicle fleet turnover, and provides a stable 
supply for the used car market in Southern California.  The ARB has estimated that rental car 
and leasing companies may account for as much as 90 percent of the total fleet sales annually.  
The rental car industry yields significant buying power that would assist the expansion of the 
alternative fuels marketplace.  The accelerated purchase of AFVs supports the development of 
public refueling and original equipment servicing infrastructures.  Staff recommends releasing 
an RFP in an amount not to exceed $500,000 for the demonstration of AFVs in commercial 
rental fleets.  The RFP specifies a minimum of 50 percent cost-sharing from the proponents.  
This recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Technology Committee on April 12, 
1995. 
 
 
 
12.	Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for the Demonstration
of Alternative Fuels in Heavy-Duty Trucks	(Lloyd) 
 
This RFP solicits demonstration projects in support of the 1994 AQMP Control Measures 
#94MON-06, "Emissions Reduction Credit for Heavy-Duty Trucks" and #94MON-08, "Further 
NOx Reductions for Heavy-Duty Engines."  Heavy-duty trucks (HDT) account for 4 percent of 
the vehicle population in California, but contribute nearly 50 percent of the NOx emissions and 
over 80 percent of the on-road particulate matter as projected by the ARB for the year 2010.  As 
a result, NOx emissions from heavy-duty vehicles are a substantial barrier to attaining air 
quality standards.  The objective of this RFP is to develop and demonstrate the use of clean fuel 
engines capable of being certified at or below 2.5 g/bhp-hr NOx.  Staff recommends releasing 
this RFP for an amount not to exceed $1,000,000.  This RFP specifies a minimum of 50 percent 
cost-sharing from the participating agencies and companies.  This recommendation was 
reviewed and approved by the Technology Committee on April 12, 1995. 
 
 
 
13.	Recommendation to Cosponsor the Development and Demonstration
of a Natural Gas Retrofit Kit for Heavy-Duty Engines	(Lloyd) 
 
The 1994 AQMP emphasizes the use of alternative transportation technologies as an air quality 
attainment strategy.  Although alternative fuels, such as natural gas, can provide significant 
emissions benefits when used in heavy-duty engines, availability of new natural gas engines is 
very limited and costly.  Staff proposes cosponsoring the development and demonstration of a 
natural gas retrofit kit for heavy-duty engines with Thermo Power Corporation, Tecogen 
Division.  Total cost of this effort is $1,385,004, with AQMD funding not to exceed $156,755.  
The emissions goal for the proposed retrofit kit is 2.5 grams NOx per brake horsepower-hour, 
less than one-half the current standard for new engines.  This recommendation was reviewed 
and approved by the Technology Committee on April 12, 1995. 
 
 
 


 
14.	Recommendation to Cosponsor Phase III Development and
Demonstration of Fleet Electric Vehicles	(Lloyd) 
 
Motive, a Southern California company, has initiated a four-phase, multi-year project to develop 
and demonstrate a new fleet electric mini-van based upon the Japanese "Kei" class van.  This 
narrow mini-van is used in Japan and Europe for commercial applications but not in the US.  
This project involves conversion of new, incomplete Subaru mini-vans to electric drivetrains.  
The AQMD cosponsored the successful bidding of the first prototype during Phase II ($50,000).  
Staff now recommends that $250,000 be approved to cosponsor Phase III ($3,000,000) which 
involves final design and safety certification of the electric mini-van.  Other cosponsors for this 
phase are Motive ($2,400,000), Subaru ($250,000) and Delco Propulsion Systems ($100,000).  
This recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Technology Committee on April 12, 
1995. 
 
 
 
15.	Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for Assistance
in Conference Coordination	(Lloyd) 
 
The AQMD utilizes a number of technology transfer mechanisms including conferences, 
workshops and seminars to showcase advanced air pollution control technologies and clean 
fuels options.  As AQMD resources are inadequate to support all facets of such technology 
transfer efforts, staff is seeking authorization to release a RFP in the amount of $95,000 for 
assistance in the organization and conduct of the AQMD's 2nd International Conference on Fuel 
Cells.  This recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Technology Committee on 
March 8, 1995. 
 
 
 
16.	Status Report on AQMD Listing of Environmental Documents and Lead	(Broadbent)
Agency Projects Received by the AQMD for Review and Comment	(909) 396-3789 
 
This report provides a monthly listing of environmental documents received by the AQMD, and a 
summary of projects for which the AQMD is preparing environmental documentation.  AQMD 
review and comment are subject to the screening criteria established by the Governing Board in 
March 1990.  This document also evaluates the Lead Agency response to AQMD comments. 
 
 
 
17.	Recommendation to Award Bid to Support the AQMD's Assessment
of Competitiveness Impacts of Air Quality Regulations	(Broadbent) 
 
At its December 9, 1994 meeting, the Board approved the recirculation of a RFP regarding 
assessing the impacts of air quality regulations on business competitiveness.  Based on a review 
of the submitted proposals, staff recommends that the Board award a contract to the successful 
bidder as outlined.  Funding is included in the FY 1994-95 Budget.  This recommendation was 
reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on April 21, 1995. 
 
 
 


 
18.	Review of Rule 1610 - Old Vehicle Scrapping	(Broadbent) 
 
At its February 1994 meeting the Board directed staff to report back on the implementation of 
this rule, adopted in January 1993 and amended in February 1994.  Staff has prepared a report 
which reviews Rule 1610 program activities over the past year and analyzes the impacts of the 
1994 amendments on the procurement, cost, and processing of old vehicles. 
 
 
 
19.	Recommendation to Award Bids for Systems Development Services	(Mathur )
(909) 396-2722 
 
At its June 10, 1994 meeting, the Board approved awarding bids for systems development 
services to Accurate Information Systems, Inc. and Telos Consulting Services.  These contracts 
are basic ordering agreement arrangements, where individual task orders are issued on an as-
needed basis.  Accurate Information Systems, Inc. has opted to discontinue conducting business 
in the State of California, consequently, an alternate contractor is required.  Staff recommends 
executing a contract with Mosakin Corporation, the next highest ranking company from the 
original bidder's list, to continue performing the required systems development contract work.  
This recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on April 21, 
1995. 
 
 
 
20.	Recommendation to Provide Future Update Training Session to Employee	(Wasikowski)
Transportation Coordinators as Required by Rule 1501	(909) 396-3264 
 
As its April 7, 1995 meeting, the Mobile Source Committee recommended that the Board review 
how the administrative support of update training sessions for employee transportation 
coordinators will be handled upon the expiration of the current contract on June 30, 1995.  
Currently a contractor makes arrangements to provide classroom spaces, pre-registration 
materials, enrollment and confirmation of attendees, while District staff provides the instructors. 
 
 
 
21.	Rule Forecast Report	(Leyden)
(909) 396-3120 
 
 
 
22.	Report to the Governing Board on Compliance of RECLAIM
with Federal New Source Review Requirements	(Leyden) 
 
Rule 2005(j) requires the Executive Officer to report to the Governing Board, by May of each 
year, on the effectiveness of RECLAIM New Source Review (NSR) in meeting the federal NSR 
requirements for the preceding year.  This report details the AQMD's success in meeting federal 
NSR requirements for 1994. 
 
 
 


 
 
 
23.	Recommendation to Receive and Appropriate Funds from the	(Liu)
Air Resources Board for the Operation of Monitoring Sites	(909) 396-2105
for the Children's Health Study in the South Coast Air Basin 
 
The ARB has asked the AQMD to assume the operation of eight monitoring sites established for 
its ten-year Children's Health Study.  ARB will provide $150,000 in the first year to take over the 
operations of the stations.  Staff recommends that the Board recognize the $150,000 from ARB 
and appropriate these funds to the Applied Science and Technology FY 1994-95 Budget.  This 
recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on April 21, 
1995. 
 
 
 
24.	Recommendation to Award Bid for Third Party Administrator to
Administer the AQMD's Workers' Compensation and General	(Jason)
Liability Programs	(909) 396-2065 
 
On November 18, 1994, the Board approved an RFP for third party administrators to administer 
the AQMD's Workers' Compensation and General Liability Programs.  Bids are being evaluated 
and staff will be recommending awarding the bid to the most qualified bidder.  This 
recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on April 21, 
1995. 
 
 
 
25.	Status Report Regarding Implementation of the Business Clean Air	(Lents)
Partnership	(909) 396-2100 
 
 
 
25(A)	Recommendation to Approve Funding for a Backup Project as an Amendment
to the Fiscal Year 1994-95 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program and	(Longville)
Authorize the Board Chairman to Execute an Agreement	(909) 396-3237 
 
When the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee (MSRC) submitted its FY 
1994-95 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program to the Governing Board for approval, the MSRC 
also included a backup list of projects eligible for funding in case additional revenues became 
available.  In fact, the MSRC has identified at minimum an additional $500,000 revenue.  
Consequently, on April 27, 1995, the MSRC approved $504,000 in funding for the first project 
on the backup list which provides differential funding for the City of Los Angeles/Department of 
Transportation to purchase five electric buses.  Final funding approval of this backup project 
must be obtained from the Governing Board since it is part of the FY 1994-95 AB 2766 
Discretionary Work Program.  Therefore, this recommendation is to request that the Governing 
Board approve an amendment to the FY 1994-95 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program to 
include the City of Los Angeles/Department of Transportation Proposal #3-8 with $504,000 in 
funding and authorize the Chairman of the Board to execute an agreement for this project.

35.	Adoption of the Executive Officer's Fiscal Year 1995-96 Budget	(Lents)
(909) 396-2100 
 
This transmits the required appropriations and reserves necessary to adopt the proposed budget.  
This recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on April 21, 
1995. 
 
 
 


36.	Amend Regulation III - Fees	(Leyden)
(909) 396-3120 
 
Regulation III - Fees sets fee rates and schedules and is amended annually to support AQMD 
activities and operations, subject to a revenue cap imposed by SB 802 (Lewis).  Although 
California Health and Safety Code Sections 41510.5 and 40523 authorize AQMD to increase 
fees consistent with annual increases in the California Consumer Price Index (CPI), AQMD 
recognizes that the recent economic recession has adversely affected this region.  For this 
reason, staff proposes no across-the-board CPI-based fee increase for Fiscal Year 1995-96.  
Proposed amendments to Rule 301 - Permit Fees include new fee categories in Table I for 20 
new equipment/processes; modification of an additional 15 equipment/processes in Table I, 
resulting in a fee decrease; and the inclusion of permit processing fees for Non-Road Engines, 
Qualifying Engines, and Statewide Equipment.  Clarifying language is proposed in additional 
amendments to Rule 301 and in amendments to Rules 303, 306, 307 and 308. 
 
 
 
37.	Amend Rule 1171 - Solvent Cleaning Operations	(Lockie)
(909) 396-2390 
 
The proposed amendments will clarify the cleaning of medical devices, polyester resin 
operations, and flexographic and gravure printing.  In addition, the rule will be amended to 
include a de minimis level of solvent usage that will be exempt from the rule.  The necessary 
CEQA documentations are included. 
 
 
 
38.	Amend Rule - 1107 - Coating of Metal Parts and Products; and
Amend Rule - 1115 - Motor Vehicle Assembly Line Coating Operations	(Lockie) 
 
The proposed amendments will address SIP deficiencies identified by the U.S. EPA, including the 
reduction of VOC limits for some coating categories. 
 
 
 
CONSENT CALENDAR CONTINUED (Items 39 through 42; Recommend Approval): 
 
39.	Recommendation to Cost-Share the Development of a Methanol	(Lloyd)
Refueling Network	(909) 396-3245 
 
There are approximately 7,500 fuel flexible vehicles operating in Southern California.  That 
number is expected to increase to more than 15,000 in the next three years.  There are currently 
34 public methanol refueling stations in Southern California.  The proposed contract is a joint 
effort between the AQMD and the California Energy Commission to establish up to 15 
additional sites in the next two years.  Staff recommends award of a sole-source contract to 
Acurex Environmental Corporation, not to exceed $510,000, ($410,000 Fiscal Year 1994-95, 
and $100,000 FY 1995-96) for the development of a methanol refueling network in Southern 
California.  This recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Technology Committee on 
April 12, 1995. 
 
 
 


 
 
 
40.	Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for
Personal Computer, Local Area Network and Wide Area Network
Replacement and Repair Services	(Mathur) 
 
Through a competitive bid process, the District is seeking to pre-qualify vendors capable of 
providing various services and supplies to keep the personal computer (PC) infrastructure 
operative.  Vendors selected will be the source for hard disk, printer, modem and other 
telecommunication subsystem repairs.  They will also be the suppliers for routine PC, WAN 
(Wide Area Network), LAN (Local Area Network) repair and installation parts required for FY 
1995-96.  This bidding and pre-qualification process will ensure that the District is using the 
most cost-effective providers for these services and supplies.  Funds have been allocated in the 
FY 1995-96 Information Management Budget.  This recommendation was reviewed and 
approved by the Administrative Committee on April 21, 1995. 
 
 
 
41.	Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for Library
Services and Supplies	(Mathur) 
 
Through a competitive bid process, the District is seeking to pre-qualify vendors providing 
various library services and supplies.  Vendors selected will be issued blanket purchase orders 
for the acquisition, cataloging, and shelf preparation of books, periodicals, and other printed 
and multi-media materials in the District's library during FY 1995-96.  The use of blanket 
purchase orders facilitates acquisition of books, articles, paper, and reports, and reduces the 
labor required to type and process prepaid purchase orders.  This bidding and pre-qualification 
process will ensure that the District is using the most cost-effective providers for these services 
and supplies.  Funds have been allocated in the FY 1995-96 Information Management Budget.  
This recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on April 21, 
1995. 
 
 
 
42.	Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for the 
Enhancement of the Facility Permit Processing Software and Database	(Mathur) 
 
District staff has designed and developed a facility permit database and user interface to support 
issuance of permits to RECLAIM facilities.  Staff proposes to obtain the services of a consultant 
to further enhance the existing software and user interface to accommodate the permitting 
requirements of the federal Title V and RECLAIM programs.  These enhancements will further 
streamline day-to-day permit processing activities.  This contract will not exceed $400,000.  
Funds have been allocated in the FY 1995-96 Information Management Budget.  This 
recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on April 21, 
1995.

<P>

<P>
6. Amend Regulation XXX -Title V Permits and Amend Rule 518 -
Hearing Board Procedures for Title V Facilities
<P>
<B>John Billheimer, Consultant</B>, addressed the Board regarding
the difficulties in manipulating the computer data base because
of incomplete references to the various facilities. Because Regulation
XXX and Rule 518 pertain to more than 1,000 sources, he suggested
that it would be beneficial to have the capability of sorting
the sources by city, county or possibly by type of industry. (Written
Comments Submitted.)
<P>
10. Response to the Triennial Performance Audit of the AQMD for
Fiscal Years 1991-92, 1992-93, 1993-94
<P>
Ms. Soto commented that the response in Item No. 2 of the Summary
of Findings and Recommendations should be amended to commit to
an expansion of the AQMD's business outreach efforts to include
more small business sources, as recommended by the performance
auditor. <U>At Chairman Mikels' direction, the amendment suggested
by Ms. Soto was included in the final vote on this item</U>.
<P>
12. Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for the Demonstration
of Alternative Fuels in Heavy-Duty Trucks
<P>
In response to questions by Ms. Haggard, Chief Scientist Dr. Alan
Lloyd reviewed staff's present procedures for reporting to the
Board on the status of commercialization of demonstration projects
and alternative fuels, and reporting each year on projects likely
to be funded for the upcoming year. He agreed to provide Ms. Haggard
a matrix of the various engine families.
<P>
Dr. Lloyd indicated that there was a strategic meeting scheduled
for May 26, 1995, at which time staff can assemble a comprehensive
report for the Board as to where AQMD funds for technology advancement
should be directed within the fiscal year 1995-96 budget, without
committing to a specific plan of action.
<P>
14. Recommendation to Cosponsor Phase III Development and Demonstration
of Fleet Electric Vehicles
<P>
Ms. Soto asked if there was a commitment from Motive, Incorporated
insuring that any new manufacturing jobs resulting from this development/demonstration
would occur in Southern California. Dr. Lloyd assured Ms. Soto
that Motive, Incorporated, located in Newport Beach, California,
will place a high priority on Southern California locations when
they are ready to seek funding from the private sector for commercialization
of the fleet electric vehicles. Dr. Lloyd also clarified that
staff's recommendation involves support of refinements to the
technology; not marketing or commercialization.
<P>
(Mr. Antonovich arrived at 10:00 a.m.)
<P>
15. Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for Assistance
in Conference Coordination
<P>
Ms. Soto expressed her belief that the funding limit of $95,000
was too high for conference coordination. Dr. Lloyd reported that
staff just recently learned that a major international conference,
similar to the type of conference tentatively scheduled by staff
for late-February 1996, is going to be held in Kobe, Japan, from
February 5 through February 8, 1996. Therefore, staff recommended
that Agenda Item No. 15 be withdrawn at this time.
<P>
18. Review of Rule 1610 - Old Vehicle Scrapping
<P>
In response to a question by Mr. Silva, Planning Director Jack
Broadbent explained that amendments to Rule 1610 to provide consistency
with the recently-adopted Rule 1501.1 was not scheduled in time
to appear on this month's Rule Forecast Report (Agenda Item No.
21). However, staff does intend to bring Rule 1610 before the
Board for amendment in the fall of 1995.
<P>
20. Recommendation to Provide Future Update Training Session to
Employee Transportation Coordinators as Required by Rule 1501
<P>
Ms. Soto suggested, and staff agreed, that the second paragraph
in Proposal No. 2 of the Board Letter be amended as follows:
<P>
<I>&quot;For FY 1996-97 compliance, District staff will </I><STRIKE><I>attempt
to</I></STRIKE><I> develop a video and computer program for the
voluntary update training.&quot;</I> 
<P>
Dr. Wilson expressed concern with Proposal No. 2, which appeared
to involve dissemination of information rather than training.
If so, he suggested the immediate transition to video or audio
taped sessions which the Employee Transportation Coordinators
(ETCs) could use at their convenience, instead of requiring them
to travel to AQMD's Diamond Bar headquarters.
<P>
Barry Wallerstein, DEO of Planning, Transportation &amp; Information
Management, responded that staff's recommendation to implement
Proposal No. 2 was approved by the Mobile Source Committee on
May 5, 1995. Since that date, however, staff has been investigating
technologies available to pursue a computer program and has discussed
preparation of a video. Staff hopes to bring these alternatives
into use in the Basin within the next six months, and is agreeable
to pursuing the audio tape alternative as well.
<P>
The following individuals addressed the Board to speak in opposition
to staff's recommendation on this item:
<P>
<U>CECILIA McLAUGHLIN, TVS Consulting</U> 
<P>
Expressed support for privatizing the ETC update training as stated
in Proposal No. 3 of the Board Letter; and suggested that more
training sessions in more locations throughout the basin be offered,
as well as smaller, industry specific or plan track specific training
sessions. (Submitted Written Comments.)
<P>
<U>JOHN HERMANN, Total Employee Relations Services, Inc.</U> 
<P>
Recommended that the existing contract the AQMD has with Total
Employee Relations for update training be extended for six months
in order to allow sufficient time for the audio, video and/or
computerized approaches to be implemented; and to also allow Total
Employee Relations time to survey ETCs on the training issues
and provide results of the survey to the AQMD. (Submitted Written
Comments.)
<P>
<U>MR. MINH Q. THAI, Glendale Transportation Management Association</U>

<P>
1) Urged the Board to seek alternatives to staff's recommendation
to hold ETC update training classes at AQMD Headquarters, which,
in requiring ETCs to commute long distances, was contradictory
to reducing vehicle trips and miles traveled.
<P>
2) Suggested that one alternative would be to seek assistance
from localized organizations, such as transportation management
associations to coordinate or host local ETC update training.
<I>(Read into the record a letter dated May 12, 1995 from Glendale
TMA President, Brooke Geer Person.)</I> 
<P>
<U>WILLIAM V. WELLS, JR., Pasadena Transportation Management Association</U>

<P>
Offered the services of Pasadena TMA as suggested by Mr. Thai,
and commented that it seems contrary to the purpose of Rule 1501
to attempt to bring hundreds of ETCs to Diamond Bar for training
instead of sending two or three people out to offer onsite training
. (Submitted Written Comments.)
<P>
<U>Written Comments Submitted by:</U>

Richard H. Ribner, Transportation Demand Management Consulting
<P>
Michael Barry, Ph.D., Creative Energy Educational Services, Inc.
<P>
(Mr. Loveridge arrived at 10:15 a.m.)
<P>
Following is a summary of the Board discussion on this item.
<P>
In order to help expedite videotaping of the update training,
Ms. Lee offered to meet with AQMD staff regarding the use of Warner
Bros. facilities in this regard. She also pointed out that part
of the discussion by the Mobile Source Committee on this issue
was that the Committee wanted to move ETC update training towards
a purely voluntary form within a year; and the discussion centered
around how to handle update training as the transition is made
over the next year. Staff's recommendation at the time was that
the training be moved in-house and held at AQMD headquarters.
After the next fiscal year, staff would then bring a recommendation
back to the Board to make the update training completely voluntary.
Also, if computer software and videos were made available that
would provide update training information, those would be sent
to the ETCs directly from the AQMD.
<P>
While Ms. Lee did not have a preference either way as to whether
the training is done in-house or not during the next year, the
Committee thought it best to have the training done in-house because
it would reduce the cost of the training program. When the actual
substance of the training is provided by AQMD staff, it did not
seem right that out of the fee that was being paid ($75), a small
portion of it ($15) was returned to the AQMD, and the rest of
it was being paid for training coordination.
<P>
Mr. Hewitt indicated that because this was his first Board meeting,
he was not prepared to vote on any substantive matters at this
time. However, he expressed his preference that any type of training
provided to people to comply with AQMD regulations be provided
by the AQMD free of charge. He also preferred that the private
sector be allowed to compete against the AQMD to provide update
training to the ETCs.
<P>
At Mr. Antonovich's suggestion, staff agreed to pursue telecommuting
as another alternative method for providing the update training
information.
<P>
Ms. Soto commented that she mentioned at the Mobile Source Committee
meeting that attention should be focused more on how to get the
information out to the ETCs rather than how to get the ETCs to
come to AQMD for training.
<P>
Although supportive of staff's recommendation in concept, Dr.
Wilson believed that one year was too long a period of time to
require the ETCs to attend training sessions at the AQMD while
staff worked on developing a video to disseminate the information.
He supported the transition to a voluntary program, and was not
opposed to allowing the private sector to compete for providing
the update training to small groups. However, he felt it should
be up to the end user to decide whether or not an audio tape,
a video tape or a computer disk would keep them updated; and if
so, they should be able to subscribe to that, at cost.
<P>
Expressing his support of committee consideration of items such
as this prior to consideration by the full Board, Mr. Paulitz
pointed out that out of deference to the committee work that has
been done, by the time items such as this come before the Board
it should be a matter of consent only.
<P>
Expressing his agreement with respect to the importance of the
committee process,
<P>
DR. WILSON MOVED TO APPROVE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION (<I>INCLUDING
DELETION OF THE WORDS &quot;attempt to&quot; FROM THE SECOND PARAGRAPH
OF PROPOSAL NO. 2</I>), AND REFER AGENDA ITEM NO. 20 BACK TO THE
MOBILE SOURCE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER ACCELERATING THE USE OF VIDEO
AND COMPUTER PROGRAMS FOR THE UPDATE TRAINING SESSIONS. THE MOTION
WAS DULY SECONDED.
<P>
Ms. Haggard brought attention to the sentence in Proposal No.
2 indicating that special sessions would also be given in outlying
areas of the Basin. Dr. Wallerstein clarified that the language
referenced was added by staff after the Committee meeting to reflect
the Committee's viewpoint--along with the sentence below that
referring to the video and computerized options.
<P>
Mr. Hewitt suggested that the Committee also reconsider whether
the AQMD should be charging fees for training sessions for people
to learn about AQMD rules and regulations.
<P>
Ms. Soto suggested that distance be defined for &quot;outlying
areas&quot;. Additionally, she believed that rather than retaining
a consultant to make arrangements for off site training, AQMD
staff should contact places such as schools, halls and auditoriums
where facilities could be used free of charge.
<P>
Ms. Lee suggested that before bringing this item back to the Committee,
staff conduct a quick, geographical survey of the transportation
management organizations and associations that have offered to
allow the AQMD to use their facilities and their memberships at
no charge, as well as some of the larger employers in the Basin
so that staff does not have to hire a consultant to make arrangements
at hotels until the transition to video, computer software and
other non-driving options has been made.
<P>
DR. WILSON AMENDED HIS MOTION TO: 1) DIRECT THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER
TO INTERNALIZE RULE 1501 UPDATE TRAINING FROM <BR>
JULY 1, 1995 TO JULY 1, 1996, IMPLEMENTING THE SECOND PROPOSAL
DISCUSSED IN THE BOARD LETTER (<I>INCLUDING DELETION OF THE WORDS
&quot;attempt to&quot; FROM THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF PROPOSAL NO.
2</I>), AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF; AND 2) REFER AGENDA ITEM NO.
20 BACK TO THE MOBILE SOURCE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER ACCELERATING
A VOLUNTARY UPDATE TRAINING PROGRAM USING AUDIO-VISUAL METHODS
AND TO RECONSIDER TELECOMMUTING/TELECONFERENCING, DISTANCE, AND
CHARGING OF FEES FOR TRAINING. THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS.
SOTO.
<P>
Mr. Antonovich suggested that the Board take no action at this
time, but refer the item back to the Mobile Source Committee and
direct staff to bring a recommendation back to the Board at its
June 9 meeting, modified by the Committee after consideration
of the suggestions discussed by the Board.
<P>
Emphasizing the need for immediate action by the Board on this
item, Ms. Lee reminded the Board that at its April 14 meeting,
the Board extended the existing contract for coordination of update
training sessions for one month. She was not supportive of extending
that contract any further until there was consensus by the Board
on how to proceed with the update training sessions; and preferred
that staff's recommendation be accepted, with the provision that
all of the options discussed for amendments to the training program
be revisited by the Mobile Source Committee.
<P>
In response to Mr. Antonovich's concern that in the interim ETCs
would be traveling to Diamond Bar for update training, Ms. Wasikowski
indicated that attendees have already signed up for the June training
session and are planning to go to a certain location near their
work site or home. However, staff was agreeable to exploring the
possibility of teleconferencing at the hotel site.

<P>

<P>
<U><B>PUBLIC HEARINGS</B></U> 
<P>
Chairman Mikels stated that since the AQMD's fees are reflected
in its budget, the Board would consider Agenda Item No. 36 prior
to No. 35.
<P>
36. Amend Regulation III - Fees
<P>
Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, gave the staff
report; and brought attention to a <I>Revised Errata Sheet</I>
which had been distributed to Board members and made available
to the public. Ms. Leyden added that a policy question has been
raised as to whether or not emission fees for RECLAIM facilities
should be held to the 1994 revenue levels--referred to as &quot;indexing&quot;.
She explained the rationale for the indexing. Briefly, a sizable
portion of the emissions revenue AQMD receives from RECLAIM sources
has been paying for a number of other functions: (i) Subsidizing
small business fees which, beginning in 1990, the Board began
lowering their permitting and operating fees, and relieving those
businesses of paying any emission fees; (ii) Source Testing; (iii)
Part of the Hearing Board costs; (iv) Outreach; (v) Air Monitoring;
and (vi) Part of Planning costs.
<P>
The top 20 largest sources of pollution in the Basin are included
in the approximately 400 RECLAIM facilities. These 20 sources
pay approximately 80 percent of the emissions revenue the AQMD
receives. Since RECLAIM facilities must reduce their emissions
by approximately 65 percent between now and the Year 2000, without
indexing this would mean a revenue loss of approximately $10 million.
The benefit of the reduction in fees would go to the largest sources
in the Basin--sources which have already had their cost of compliance
cut in half under RECLAIM, and are also provided significant flexibility
under the RECLAIM program.
<P>
Staff recommended that the Board sustain the concept of indexing,
proceed to implement the air toxics fee rebate, and adopt all
of the amendments proposed by staff.
<P>
Ms. Soto suggested that the rules be worded in a manner which
can be easily understood by the regulated public, i.e., summarize
or describe contents instead of referencing the federal register
or other rules. Ms. Leyden indicated that staff would do so when
Regulation III is next brought before the Board for amendment.
<P>
Mr. Silva suggested, in light of the fact that because of unusual
circumstances the AQMD has accumulated for the next fiscal year
larger than normal reserves, that the reserves be reduced and
a certain amount of funds--primarily collected from the business
community--be returned to the businesses. He proposed the following:
<P>
1) A one-year moratorium be placed on the concept of indexing,
during which time the indexing issue can be studied by the Rule
301 Task Force.
<P>
2) A four percent rebate of annual operating permit renewals to
fee payers for the fiscal year 1995-96 billing year.
<P>
Dr. Lents expressed his belief that it would be safe to lower
the amount of reserves; assuming, however, that the AQMD receives
the subvention it normally receives from the Air Resources Board,
as well as the Title 105 funds supplied to the AQMD by the Environmental
Protection Agency--approximately $3 million from each agency.
Staff has not received any indication from either agency that
such funding will not be forthcoming.
<P>
The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from
the following individuals in support of: (i) charging emission
fees for RECLAIM facilities based on actual emissions instead
of RTC emission allocations; and (ii) the proposals by Mr. Silva:
<P>
VICTOR WEISSER, California Council for Environmental and Economic
Balance
<P>
CURTIS COLEMAN, California Manufacturers' Association Southern
California<BR>
Air Quality Alliance
<P>
MICHAEL HERTEL, Southern California Edison
<P>
LEE WALLACE, The Gas Company
<P>
JEB STUART, California Aerospace Environmental Association
<P>
STAN HOLM, Mobil Oil Corporation
<P>
<U>MICHAEL WEBSTER, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
</U>
<P>
The following issues were raised during public testimony:
<P>
The concept of not having the emission fees tied to actual emissions
is inconsistent with the fundamental economic incentives to reduce
emissions that form the basis of RECLAIM, moves away from the
goal and principle that program costs should be covered fairly
by the &quot;cost-causers&quot;, and is in conflict with legislation
adopted in 1994 restricting increases in AQMD fees.
<P>
The RTC emissions allocation fees are presently charged only to
the approximately 400 NOx and SOx RECLAIM facilities out of the
thousands of facilities in the Basin; and if VOC RECLAIM is not
adopted, the fees will continue to apply only to these 400 sources.
Therefore, it is not just a question of whether large sources
should subsidize small businesses; rather it is a question of
whether large NOx and SOx sources should subsidize large VOC sources
and small businesses.
<P>
It is unfair to have companies reduce their emissions and at the
same time charge them emission fees which will either increase
or stay level over time.
<P>
The majority of speakers expressed a commitment to working with
the Rule 301 Task Force to develop equitable and appropriate funding
mechanisms for essential services provided by the AQMD as emissions--and
revenue--decline over time.
<P>
In addition, Major. John Spurlin of the United States Air Force,
March AFB, commented that the definition of &quot;non-road engines&quot;
in Subparagraph (b)(10) of Proposed Amended Rule 301 is not clear
and appears to be inconsistent with the definition in the federal
rule. He questioned AQMD's authority to regulate these emissions,
and suggested that until the proposed provisions are adopted into
the AQMD's regulatory structure in a public hearing, it is premature
to establish fees for these sources at this time.
<P>
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P>
MR. SILVA MOVED ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION NO. 95-8, AMENDING RULES

<P>
The Board recessed for lunch at 12:10 p.m. and reconvened at 12:55
p.m.
<P>
(Mr. Hewitt left at approximately 12:10 p.m., during the lunch

<P>
35. Adoption of the Executive Officer's Fiscal Year 1995-96 Budget
<P>
Finance Director Patrick Pearce presented the staff report, and
brought attention to the revised <I>Goals/Objectives for 1996</I>,
copies of which were distributed to Board members and made available
to the public. The Goals/Objectives were revised by staff to incorporate
the 12 points in the Action Plan of the Business Clean Air Partnership
adopted by the Board at its April 14, 1995 meeting. Mr. Pearce
added that, as a result of the Board's action on Agenda Item No.
35, there will be a reduction in fee revenues of approximately
$1.4 million which will be made up for by use of funds in the
Undesignated Reserves.
<P>
The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from
<B>Julie Hansen of the American Lung Association </B>and <B>John
Billheimer, Consultant,</B> in support of the proposed budget.
In response to concern raised by Mr. Billheimer regarding ambiguous
and/or incorrect statements in the staff report relating to whether
the Southeast Desert Air Basin was within the jurisdiction of
the South Coast Air Quality Management District, Dr. Lents indicated
that staff would review the report and make any corrections necessary.
<P>
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MS. LEE, SECONDED BY MS. SOTO, A UNANIMOUS VOTE WAS
CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT TO: (1) APPROVE THE REVISED
GOALS/OBJECTIVES FOR 1996; AND (2) APPROVE TOTAL APPROPRIATIONS
OF $97,923,337, TOTAL RESERVES AND DESIGNATIONS OF $30,185,025,
AND RECOGNIZE ESTIMATED REVENUES OF $95,147,100 AS RECOMMENDED
BY STAFF AND AMENDED BY BOARD ACTION ON AGENDA ITEM NO. 36. (Absent:
Braude, Burke and Hewitt.)
<P>
37. Amend Rule 1171 - Solvent Cleaning Operations
<P>
David Schwien, Stationary Source Compliance Senior Manager, presented
the staff report. The public hearing was opened, and the Board
heard testimony from the following individuals in support of the
proposed amended rule:
<P>
<U>MS. B.J. KIRWAN, Attorney representing 3M, Baxter Healthcare,
Sorin Biomedical, et. al.</U> 
<P>
Expressed appreciation to AQMD staff for working with the various
manufacturers of pharmaceutical products and medical devices to
address the problems particular to their type of operations in
obtaining suitable compliant solvents.
<P>
<U>JOHN BUTTERS, Raytheon</U> 
<P>
Expressed appreciation to staff for addressing their concern by
proposing the amendment to Rule 1171 dealing with the issue of
rinsing and flushing of equipment.
<P>
<U>JACK SOROKIN, Beckman Instruments</U> 
<P>
Asked that &quot;scientific instruments&quot; be exempted from
the rule requirements. (Submitted Written Comments.)
<P>
(Ms. Soto left at 1:10 p.m., during public testimony.)
<P>
Mr. Schwien pointed out that &quot;scientific instruments&quot;
was included in the Exemption, Subparagraph (g)(2)(A) of the proposed
amended rule.
<P>
Ms. Leyden added that one of the key issues addressed by the proposed
amendments was the second largest cause for issuance of Notices
to Comply and Notices of Violation to regulated industries, and
that is the failure to place VOC-contaminated rags in a closed
container. In reassessing the rule, staff decided that whether
the rag was placed in a closed container or not; the moment the
rag is removed, VOC emissions are released into the atmosphere.
Therefore, that portion of the rule was amended and it will no
longer constitute a violation. Staff believes changes such as
this one are responsive to the Board's recently-adopted Business
Clean Air Partnership.
<P>
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.

the staff report; and brought attention to the <I>Addendum to
Agenda #38 Proposed Amended Rule 1107</I> and <I>Revised Agenda
#38 Proposed Amended Rule 1115</I> which contained modifications
to the proposed amended rules in response to late comments received
from Certified Enameling (Rule 1107) and Toyota Auto Body Corporation
(Rule 1115). Copies of both documents were distributed to Board
members and made available to the public.
<P>

support of Proposed Amended Rules 1107 and 1115 from <B>Dan Monette
of Toyota Auto Body Corporation</B> and <B>Robert Sypowicz of
Cardinal Industrial Finishes</B>. Mr. Sypowicz requested that
&quot;pretreatment coatings&quot; be exempted from the rule requirements
as are other functional coatings, such as &quot;high performance
architectural&quot; and &quot;vacuum metalizing&quot; coatings.
Staff agreed to Mr. Sypowicz' request, and indicated that there
would be no impact from exempting the pretreatment coatings. (Written
Comments Submitted by Mr. Sypowicz.)

to the AQMD's Rules and Regulations, and to Adopt Any Necessary California
Environmental Quality Act Documentation for the Following Rule:
(Fray) (909) 396-3030
<P>
Adopt Proposed Regulation XXI - Portable Equipment
<P>
<UL>
<I>This proposed new regulation will begin the implementation
of Point II of the Action Plan of the Business Clean Air Partnership.
Certain types of portable equipment may be registered for a reduced
fee. Registered equipment may then be operated here or in any
other participating California air district. Participation on

<P>
<UL>
<I>These budget transfer items are to cover Board-approved expenditures
from savings elsewhere in the Budget.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
8. Recommendation to Approve Funding for Four Additional Backup
<BR>
Projects as an Amendment to the Fiscal Year 1994-95 AB 2766
Discretionary Work Program and Authorize the Board Chairman 
to Execute Agreements 
(Longville) (909) 3237
<P>
<UL>
<I>When the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee
submitted its FY 1994-95 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program to
the Board for approval, the MSRC also included a backup list of
projects eligible for funding in case additional revenues became
available. In May 1995 two projects totaling $600,000 were withdrawn
by the proposers before contract execution was complete. Consequently,
on May 25, 1995, the MSRC decided to fund an additional four projects
on the backup list, including the remaining project in the Fleet
Acquisition Development category. These four projects total $528,200
in funding from the AB 2766 Discretionary Fund. This recommendation
is that the Board approve an amendment to the FY 1994-95 </I>AB
2766 Discretionary Work Program<I> to include these four backup
projects for funding and authorize the Board's Chairman to execute
agreements with the respective proposers. This recommendation
was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on May
19, 1995.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
9. Recommendation to Purchase Ultra-Low and Zero-Emission Vehicles
(Lloyd) (909) 396-3245
<P>
<UL>
<I>In support of the AQMD's Clean Fuels Program, staff recommends
the purchase of two ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs), specifically
two compressed natural gas (CNG) Chrysler minivans, and two zero-emission
vehicles, specifically an advanced AC Propulsion electric vehicle
(EV) and a Green Motorworks neighborhood EV. The two CNG-powered
minivans are certified by the ARB to meet the strict ULEV standards
and will be utilized in the AQMD's vanpool program with in-use
emissions periodically assessed by the ARB. The advanced AC Propulsion
EV will be tested by the AQMD and the ARB in support of their
efforts to monitor and test the performance of state-of-the-art
EVs. The Green Motorworks EV will allow the AQMD to test the neighborhood
EV and station car program concepts as potential niche market
roles for early EVs. The total cost of the four vehicles will
not exceed $170,000.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
10. Status Report on AQMD Listing of Environmental Documents and Lead 
Agency Projects Received by the AQMD for Review and Comment 
(Broadbent) (909) 396-3789
<P>
<UL>
<I>This report provides a monthly listing of environmental documents
received by the AQMD, and a summary of projects for which the
AQMD is preparing environmental documentation. AQMD review and
comment are subject to the screening criteria established by the
Governing Board in March 1990. This document also evaluates the
Lead Agency response to AQMD comments.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
11. Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for Business
Computer Hardware, Database Software, and Disaster and Conversion Services 
(Mathur) (909) 396-2722
<P>
<UL>
<I>Current computers cannot support new applications without overall
performance degradation. Replacement of these systems will take
advantage of new computer technology and should provide enough
capacity to support application development for the next three
to five years. Funds have been allocated in the Fiscal Year (FY)
1995-96 Information Management budget for this computer acquisition.
This recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Administrative
Committee on May 19, 1995.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
12. Rule Forecast Report (Leyden) (909) 396-3120
<P>
13. Recommendation to Award Bids for Review or Preparation of
Air<BR>
Toxics &quot;Hot Spots&quot; Information and Assessment Act (AB
2588) Health Risk Assessments (Leyden)
<P>
<UL>
<I>At its April 14, 1995 meeting, the Board approved the release
of a Request for Proposals (RFP) to review or prepare health risk
assessments submitted pursuant to AB 2588. Based on criteria published
in the RFP, all proposals have been reviewed by an AQMD evaluation
panel. At the June 9, 1995 meeting, staff will recommend awarding
the bid(s) to the best qualified bidder(s). Total funding for
this RFP will not exceed $260,000. This entire amount is from
the state AB 2588 program and not AQMD general funds. This is
included in the 1994-95 budget. This recommendation was reviewed
and approved by the Stationary Source Committee on<BR>
May 19, 1995.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
14. Recommendation Regarding Use of Reserve Funds to Issue Air
Toxics &quot;Hot Spots&quot; Fee Rebate for Fiscal Year 1994-95 (Leyden)
 <P>
<UL>
<I>The Air Toxics &quot;Hot Spots&quot; Information and Assessment
Act requires that the ARB annually adopt a fee regulation to collect
fees to recover the state and local air district costs of program
implementation. The fee regulation and the fee schedule adopted
for AQMD for this year will increase the fees by 7 to 43 percent
over the last year's level. To mitigate this situation, staff
recommends use of approximately $700,000 from the special Air
Toxics reserve funds to issue a flat rate rebate to all fee payers.</I>
</UL>

<P>
15. Recommendation to Adopt Resolution Amending the Annual 
Compensation for the AQMD's Hearing Board Members 
(Nikkila) (909) 396-3010
<P>
<UL>
<I>Staff recommends amending the annual compensation for the Hearing
Board Members as follows: from $60,000 annually to $50,000 for
each member except for the chair, who will receive $65,000 to
reflect adjusted hours of required availability. The proposed
amendments will also clarify payment for orientation and attendance
by Alternate Members.</I>

16. Recommendation to Award Bids for Source Emissions Testing by Outside Contractors 
(Liu) (909) 396-2105
<P>
<UL>
<I>On February 10, 1995 the Board approved the release of an RFP
to seek outside contractors to perform source emissions tests.
An evaluation panel has reviewed all proposals received in accordance
with established criteria and the District policy on consultant
selection. Staff recommends that the Board award a bid(s) for
an amount(s) not to exceed a total of $300,000. Funding for this
work has been allocated in the Applied Science and Technology's
FY 1994-95 budget.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
17. Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals to Prequalify Providers of Temporary Staff Services 
(Nikkila) (909) 396-3010
<P>
<UL>
<I>On March 10, 1995 the Board received and filed a report outlining
administrative policy and procedure changes made by the Executive
Officer relating to the purchase of nonconsultant services and
supplies. One of these changes was a requirement for establishing,
through Board approval, a list of prequalified vendors of such
services and supplies. In the case of temporary staffing services,
vendors are to be prequalified for a period of two fiscal years.
This recommendation is to obtain Board approval to release an
RFP which will be used to establish a list of prequalified agencies
from whom competitive bids may be solicited when temporary staff
is needed during FYs 1995-96 and 1996-97. This recommendation
was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on May
19, 1995.</I> 
</UL>

18. Recommendation to Award Bid for Medical Services Provider
(Jason) (909) 396-2065
<P>
<UL>
<I>On January 13, 1995, the Board approved an RFP for a qualified
medical provider specializing in occupational/industrial medicine.
Bids are being evaluated, and staff will be recommending awarding
the bid to the most qualified bidder. This recommendation was
reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on May 19,
1995.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
19. Recommendation to Dispose of AQMD Property (Jason)
<P>
<UL>
<I>On July 12, 1991 the Board approved the AQMD cost-sharing a
real-time vehicle emissions monitoring program with Ford Motor
Company and the University of California, Los Angeles. As part
of the program, the AQMD agreed to provide the test vehicle on
a lease basis. The program was subsequently transferred to CE-CERT
and they are interested in purchasing this vehicle for $6,500
at the expiration of the lease on June 30, 1995. This recommendation
was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on May
19, 1995.</I> 
</UL>
<P>
20. Recommendation Regarding Requests for Quotations to Prequalify
Providers of Various Services and Supplies (Jason)
<P>
<UL>
<I>On March 10, 1995, the Board received and filed a report outlining
administrative policy and procedure changes made by the Executive
Officer relating to the purchase of nonconsultant services and
supplies. One of these changes was a requirement for establishing,
through Board approval, a list of prequalified vendors of such
services and supplies. This recommendation is to obtain Board
approval to release Requests for Quotations which will be used
to establish a list of prequalified vendors from whom competitive
bids may be solicited for the purchase of office supplies, printing/photocopy
paper, printing services, unleaded fuel, and vehicle maintenance
as needed during FY 1995-96. This recommendation was reviewed
and approved by the Administrative Committee on May 19, 1995.</I>

Rule 518 - Hearing Board Procedures for Title V Facilities 
(Leyden) (909) 396-3120
<P>
<UL>
<I>The proposed amendments to Regulation XXX and Rule 518 are
needed to address changes identified by EPA as necessary to obtain
interim program approval. These changes include: (a) using a facility's
Potential to Emit rather than reported actual emissions to determine
if a facility is a major source five years after program approval
unless a State Implementation Plan (SIP)-approved District rule
is adopted, in the future, to exempt these sources from Title
V; (b) moving variance provisions from Regulation XXX to Rule
518; (c) clarifying that NSR permits must meet all necessary Title
V compliance requirements at the time of issuance; and (d) reducing
the emissions cutoff for group processing of minor permit revisions.</I>

Measure of the 1994 AQMP and to correct deficiencies in the existing
rule as required by EPA. The amendment proposes to reduce VOC
emissions at large bulk loading facilities, and to establish self-auditing
requirements for monthly leak inspections.</I>

1. Opening Comments
<P>
<U>Ms. Soto</U>. Expressed her appreciation to staff for preparing,
at her request earlier this year, a calendar of public events
and hearings related to the technical and political debate presently
underway concerning California's zero-emission and low-emission
vehicle mandates. This calendar, which she recently had staff
update to include a series of hearings on this subject by the
California Air Resources Board, will be updated and distributed
to Board members each year with the calendar of monthly Board
meetings. She emphasized the high political, industrial, economic
and air quality stakes that are entangled within this debate,
and hoped the calendar would help the Board focus their supportive
efforts accordingly.

<P>
Ms. Soto asked that the motion on Page 7 of the Minutes approving
Agenda Item No. 10 be modified to include amendment of the Response
to Finding No. 2 of the Summary of Findings and Recommendations
to indicate that the AQMD would proactively commit to expanding
its outreach efforts to include more small business sources, as
suggested in her comments on the item. As she recalled, Board
members were agreeable to her suggestion; however, the motion
approving the item did not include that amendment.
<P>
MR. BRAUDE MOVED TO REMOVE ITEM NO. 2 FROM THE AGENDA, TO BE BROUGHT
BACK TO THE BOARD AT ITS JULY 14, 1995 MEETING WITH LANGUAGE ADDRESSING
MS. SOTO'S REQUEST. THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ.

in the Technical and Enforcement, Office Clerical and Maintenance,
and Professional bargaining units. Items 21 and 22 will be standing
items on the agenda until closure is reached and a recommendation
regarding Memoranda of Understanding can be made. He recommended
that these two items be continued to the Board's July 14, 1995
meeting.
<P>
THE CONSENT CALENDAR WAS AMENDED AT CHAIRMAN MIKELS' DIRECTION
TO SHOW AGENDA ITEMS 2, 21 AND 22 CONTINUED TO THE JULY 14, 1995
BOARD MEETING.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. PAULITZ, SECONDED BY DR. WILSON, A UNANIMOUS
VOTE WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Silva, Lee
and Loveridge) APPROVING AGENDA ITEMS 3 THROUGH 7 (<I>Agenda Item
No. 8 having been withdrawn</I>), 11 THROUGH 20 (<I>With Mr. Antonovich
abstaining on Item No. 16</I>) AND 22(A), AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.
<P>
(Ms. Soto left at 10:00 a.m.)
<P>
9. Recommendation to Purchase Ultra-Low and Zero-Emission Vehicles
<P>
Dr. Burke questioned why the AC Propulsion electric vehicle (EV),
at $90,000, costs three times as much as the $29,000-compressed
natural gas minivans; and also how the cost of this EV compared
to that of the two AC Propulsion EVs (a Honda CRX and a Saturn
ELX) currently owned by AQMD.
<P>
Dr. Alan Lloyd, Chief Scientist, explained that AC Propulsion
is a small company located in the Basin which is still trying
to build up a large production capability. The previous two EVs
were purchased from them by the AQMD at an approximate cost of
$70,000 each. While the battery, electronics and so forth will
still be of the same high standard AC Propulsion has produced
in the past, the EV staff recommends for purchase will be much
more finished, more sophisticated and will have more interior
improvements. In response to Dr. Burke, Dr. Lloyd added that although
the Air Resources Board (ARB) is not contributing funds for this
program, AQMD has shared its results with ARB and views this as
a partnership to ensure that the zero-emission vehicle program
be sustained.
<P>
Mr. Braude commented on the enormous leverage to be gained by
the AQMD, for a relatively small investment, in advancing production
of state-of-the-art low- and zero-emission vehicles.
<P>
ON MOTION OF DR. BURKE, SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ, A UNANIMOUS VOTE
WAS CAST OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Lee, Loveridge,
Silva and Soto) APPROVING AGENDA ITEM NO. 9 AS RECOMMENDED BY
STAFF.
<P>
10. Status Report on AQMD Listing of Environmental Documents and
Lead Agency Projects Received by the AQMD for Review and Comment
<P>
Expressing concern that staff would no longer be able to routinely
comment on California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) documents,
Mr. Hewitt brought attention to an AQMD publication, <U>Building
Markets for Low Emission Technologies and Clean Fuels</U>, published
in January 1995 at a cost of $28,000. He believed that instead
of spending money on publications of this type, which are frequently
not read, AQMD should devote those funds to items essential to
the mission of the AQMD, such as CEQA review.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. HEWITT, SECONDED BY DR. WILSON, A UNANIMOUS VOTE
WAS CAST OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Lee, Loveridge,
Silva and Soto) APPROVING AGENDA ITEM NO. 10 AS RECOMMENDED BY

<P>
33. Adopt Proposed Rule 518.1 - Permit Appeal Procedures for Title
V Facilities, and Amend Regulation XXX -Title V Permits and Rule
518 - Hearing Board Procedures for Title V Facilities
<P>
Dr. Lents reported that the business community has expressed concerns
regarding this item, which is required by federal law. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recommended that the
Board continue the public hearing on this item to the August 11,
1995 Board meeting to allow EPA the opportunity to work with industry
on addressing their concerns. Staff concurred in that recommendation,
and copies of the June 8, 1995 letter from EPA requesting the
continuance were distributed to Board Members.
<P>
(Mr. Loveridge arrived at 10:15 a.m.)
<P>
Chairman Mikels opened the public hearing, with the understanding
that the hearing would be continued to the Board's August 11,
1995 meeting. The Board heard testimony from the following individuals:
<P>
<U>STEVEN BROILES, Attorney, on behalf of the Cities of Burbank,
Glendale and Pasadena</U> 
<P>
1) Requested that a task force be formed to explore the possibility
of creating a federal analog that would achieve the same purpose
for Title V sources as the variance achieves for state sources
in California.
<P>
2) Commented that he had brought to staff's attention several
errors in the Technical Guidance Document (TGD); and suggested,
since there was insufficient time allowed for review and comment
on the TGD before its submittal to EPA, that workshops be held
during the next 60 days to allow public comment on the document.
(Submitted Written Comments.)
<P>
Dr. Lents responded that one of the key issues to be discussed
during the negotiations with EPA is the variance procedures, and
indicated that he would speak with EPA representative David Howekamp
about including Mr. Broiles in negotiations on that particular
issue.
<P>
Indicating her agreement with Mr. Broiles' comments on the TGD,
Ms. Leyden stated staff's intention to provide the public the
opportunity to identify any concerns they have so that staff can
make any corrections necessary. With respect to the variance issue,
she suggested that staff initiate a working meeting within the
next two weeks with all interested parties and EPA--including
notice to the existing Title V Working Group--to work on developing
an alternative proposal. At Ms. Haggard's request, Ms. Leyden
agreed to include members of the Stationary Source Committee in
the meeting also.
<P>
<U>CLAYTON MILLER, Construction Industry Air Quality Coalition
(CIAQC)</U> 
<P>
Requested the removal of certain construction companies from the
Appendix A List of Facilities Subject to Title V due to Criteria
Pollutant Emissions. The fuel usage reported by these companies
in 1992 was an aggregate of all of the diesel fuel used by them.
The majority of that fuel, however, was used on mobile equipment,
which, CIAQC believes, is not supposed to be counted in the Title
V program. (Submitted Written Comments)
<P>
Ms. Leyden responded that there is not a final list yet of what
is considered Phase I Title V sources. Mobile equipment is included
in the existing equipment permits and the emissions are part of
what has to be addressed as the total project goes through New
Source Review for offsetting requirements. Staff is still pursing
this particular aspect, which affects approximately 12 facilities
on the initial Title V list, and will get an answer back to CIAQC
before the continued public hearing in August.
<P>
<U>MICHAEL CARROLL, Attorney, on behalf of Regulatory Flexibility
Group</U> 
<P>
Expressed support for continuing the public hearing, and looked
forward to working with staff and Board Members on resolving the
outstanding issues.
<P>
Ms. Haggard clarified, for the record, that the issues stated
in the letters submitted to Board Members by Lee Wallace of the
Gas Company and Michael Carroll of Latham &amp; Watkins, as well
as the comments by Mr. Broiles and Mr. Miller should all be addressed
as part of the discussions.
<P>
Stressing the importance of the variance procedure, Mr. Braude
commented that the need for flexibility and a certain amount of
discretion at the local level is very fundamental; and to have
a rigid system of regulation at the federal level is disastrous
for this type of regulation. He and Mr. Hewitt both expressed
disappointment that no one from EPA was present to participate
in the discussion on this item, and Mr. Hewitt suggested that
staff urge EPA to have someone present for the August Board meeting.
<P>
Mr. Hewitt also commented that as the negotiations go forward,
staff should be aware that he will not support any set of regulations
that does not include a variance procedure along the lines of
what was originally supported. He expressed his belief that AQMD
should take a stern, unyielding position in the next 60 days to
allow AQMD the type of regulatory flexibility advocated by Mr.
Braude in his comments, and hoped that staff would take that position
into the working group meetings. If EPA finds it cannot approve
the Title V program AQMD puts forward and imposes a federal operating
permits program, he believed Congress would find EPA's program
unacceptable.
<P>
Mr. Paulitz indicated his agreement with Mr. Braude's and Mr.
Hewitt's comments, and added that he believes EPA is beginning
to realize that AQMD has had more experience in this regard and
has a better permit type of program.
<P>
Mr. Braude asked that staff keep the Board apprised of what complying
with the law entails, and he was pleased and hopeful that the
federal government gave AQMD an opportunity not to be confronted
with that dilemma at this time.
<P>
(Mr. Silva arrived at 10:25 a.m., during Board discussion.)
<P>
ON MOTION OF DR. WILSON, SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD, A UNANIMOUS
VOTE WAS CAST OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Lee and Soto)
CONTINUING THE PUBLIC HEARING ON PROPOSED RULE 518.1, REGULATION
XXX AND RULE 518 TO THE AUGUST 11, 1995 BOARD MEETING; AND DIRECTING
STAFF TO MEET WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS
ITEM AND TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS IN A FORUM WITH EPA IN AN EFFORT
TO RESOLVE DIFFERENCES BEFORE THE AUGUST 11 MEETING.
<P>
34. Amend Rule 462 - Organic Liquid Loading
<P>
Mr. Hewitt indicated that he was not participating in this item
because of a conflict of interest arising from his law firm's
representation on a real estate matter of an entity that might
have a material effect.
<P>
The staff report was presented by William Thompson, Senior Manager
of Stationary Source Compliance's Public Facilities Team. Mr.
Thompson brought attention to the Revisions to Agenda Item #34,
copies of which had been distributed to Board members and made
available to the public.
<P>
The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from
<B>Ron Wilkness,</B> on behalf of <B>Western States Petroleum
Association (WSPA)</B>, in support of the proposed amended rule.
Mr. Wilkness commended AQMD staff for working cooperatively with

(909) 396-3237</B> 
<P>
<I>Approximately $12.5 million annually in AB 2766 vehicle registration
fee revenues, including projected interest earned, will be available
to fund vehicle emission reduction projects in Fiscal Years (FYs)
1995-96 and 1996-97. The Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction
Review Committee (MSRC) has proposed a two-year, $22 million program
for FYs 1995-97, subject to reauthorization in FY 1996-97 assuming
the AB 2766 funding remains available. This program consists of
the following: 1) Three Alternative Fuel Requests for Proposals
for Public Transit, School Buses and Heavy-Duty Vehicles; 2) A
Zero-Emission Vehicle &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Program consisting
of three components: a Request for Qualifications for vehicle
buydowns, a Program Opportunity Notice (PON) for participation
in a Corridor Communities Program, and an RFP for an Outreach
Coordinator; and 3) Three RFPs for projects to enhance or implement
Rail Feeders/Stations, Transportation Control Measures and Research
and Development. On June 22, 1995, the MSRC approved these RFPs,
the RFQ and the PON, and requests the Governing Board's approval
to release the documents to solicit proposals. This recommendation
was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on June
23, 1995.</I>

as Part of the Fiscal Year 1995-96 AB 2766 Discretionary Work
Program</B> (Longville)
<P>
<I>The AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Program receives thirty cents
of every dollar of vehicle registration fees collected pursuant
to AB 2766. It is estimated that approximately $11.7 million will
be available in FY 1995-96. Of this $11.7 million, AB 2766 allows
5 percent to be used to support program administration. On June
22, 1995, the MSRC approved the reimbursement of technical, clerical
and contract administrative support consistent with the level
currently provided by AQMD staff. In addition, due to the complexities
of the FY 1995-96 Work Program, as well as the continued need
for support of past contracts, the MSRC committed additional monies
to provide enhanced technical and clerical support in the form
of two contract employees. The additional technical support will
be provided by Ray Gorski, previously of SAIC (the MSRC's former
Consultant Advisor), and one clerical contract employee. The MSRC
is requesting that the Board approve funding these two non-benefited
contract employees as part of the FY 1995-96 AB 2766 Discretionary
Work Program. This recommendation was reviewed and approved by
the Administrative Committee on June 23, 1995.</I>

the University of California, Riverside's College of Engineering

(909) 396-3245
<P>
<A HREF="mailto:alloyd@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
( alloyd@aqmd.gov )<BR>
<I>The Board previously authorized two separate contracts with
the University of California, Riverside's College of Engineering
- Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT) to
conduct a variety of projects involving low-emission technologies
and clean fuels. Staff recommends that both contracts be amended
to allocate additional funding for CE-CERT to conduct follow-on
work. In the first contract, CE-CERT is conducting Phase I of
a baseline gasoline composition study, in preparation for wide-scale
introduction of advanced reformulated gasoline in March 1996.
Staff recommends AQMD funding in the amount of $80,000 to conduct
Phase II of this project, which calls for sampling and analysis
of 1996 reformulated gasoline. Under the second contract, CE-CERT
is conducting seven mobile source projects designed to provide
technical support and emissions testing for AQMP-related technologies.
Staff proposes a contract amendment to fund additional work by
CE-CERT on four of these seven projects, in an amount not to exceed
$490,000. The total proposed amount of new funding for this Board
action is $570,000. This recommendation was reviewed and approved
by the Technology Committee on June 14, 1995.</I>

<P>
<I>Upon adoption of the 1994 AQMP the Board directed staff to
evaluate the impacts of the Final Federal Implementation Plan,
the revised on-road emissions factor program, and the ARB long-range
mobile source control program, relative to the 1994 AQMP control
strategy and to recommend any necessary revisions to the Plan.
ARB has yet to adopt the revised on-road mobile emissions factor
program. However, the State did adopt a long-range mobile source
control program as part of the State Implementation Plan approval.
In addition, the U.S. Congress has rescinded the Federal Implementation
Plan. Staff has prepared a report which reviews the impacts of
the above actions on the 1994 AQMP.</I>

<I>This report provides a monthly listing of environmental documents

Co-Sponsor Revenues, and Release Request for Proposals in Support
of the PTEP</B> (Broadbent)
<P>
<I>Last December, the Board appropriated $600,000 to initiate
the PTEP. Some projects are now underway, and some projects are
scheduled to begin after July 1, 1995 as part of the second phase
of the program. Because not all of the AQMD's funds were committed
during the first phase in the FY 1994-95 Budget, staff recommends
that the uncommitted portion of the PTEP funds ($375,000) be re-appropriated
in the FY 1995-96 Budget for their original purpose. Staff also
recommends that the additional funds by PTEP co-sponsors be recognized
as a supplement to the FY 1995-96 Budget, and that the Board approve
the release of the RFP for PTEP projects. This recommendation
was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on<BR>
June 23, 1995.</I> 
<P>
<B>16.<A HREF="950716.html">Recommendation to Amend Contract to Determine Limits of Best Available Control Measures for Fugitive Dust Under High Wind Conditions </A>(Broadbent)</B>

<P>
<I>In 1994 the AQMD awarded a contract to the College of Engineering
- Center of Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT) of
the University of California, Riverside for $69,574 to conduct
a field study for determining when fugitive dust &quot;best available
control measures&quot; become ineffective under high wind conditions.
This information is needed to provide improved technical data
as part of the federal PM10 SIP process. Due to abnormal weather
conditions during 1994, there were insufficient high-wind events
to meet the project objectives. To gain enough events, it is necessary
to continue the project through the 1995 fall windy season. Staff
recommends that the existing contract with CE-CERT be increased
by $19,872 for a contract total of $89,446. The additional funds
are available in Planning and Policy's Professional &amp; Special
Services Account in the FY 1995-96 Budget.</I> 
<P>
<B>17. <A HREF="950717.html">Recommendation to Recognize Revenue and Appropriate Funds to be Received from the Environmental Protection Agency under the Section 105 Grant Program </A>(Broadbent)</B>

<P>
<I>The U.S. EPA has informed the AQMD that an additional $10,454
in FY 1995 Section 105 Grant monies is available to supplement
the previous $250,000 grant to the PM10 Best Available Control
Measures (BACM) Working Group. These funds will augment the maximum
five percent allowed under the previous grant for administrative
support to the BACM Working Group. This recommendation was reviewed
and approved by the Administrative Committee on June 23, 1995.</I>

<P>
<I>On May 12, 1995 the Board approved the release of an RFP for
PC, LAN and WAN replacement parts and repair services. As a result
of successful responses to this RFP, three vendors were identified
as capable of providing these personal computer and telecommunications
repair services and supplies. These vendors will be the primary
source for all hard disk, printer, modem and other telecommunication
subsystem repairs and supplies. Staff recommends that these top
three vendors be approved and qualified to provide services and
supplies to the AQMD. Funds have been allocated in the FY 1995-96
Information Management Budget for these services. This recommendation
was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on June
23, 1995.</I>

<I>Item II of Chairman Mikels' Business Clean Air Partnership
is to simplify and streamline the permit requirements for most
small businesses through the certification/registration program.
Staff has identified over 20 types of commonly permitted equipment
that do not trigger offset or toxic requirements for this program.
This RFP seeks qualified contractors to obtain detailed information

(909) 396-2105</B> 
<P>
<I>The AQMD has received funds from EPA and ARB to conduct a number
of monitoring projects. These designated funds must be carried
over from the FY 1994-95 Budget to the FY 1995-96 Budget to complete
these studies and purchase needed equipment. Staff recommends
that the Board appropriate funds from the Undesignated Fund Balance
to the Applied Science and Technology Division FY 1995-96 Budget
as follows: (1) $50,000 for an EPA-funded study on the Demonstration
of Optical Remote Sensing Techniques, (2) $70,000 to purchase

<P>
South Coast Air Quality<BR>
     Management District Board
<P>
Recommendation to Qualify Vendors to Provide PC,<BR>
<U>LAN and WAN Replacement Parts and Repair Services</U>
<P>
On May 15, 1995 the District released a Request for Proposals
(RFP) for Personal Computer, Local Area Network and Wide Area
Network Replacement Parts and Repair Services.  The purpose of
the RFP is to pre-qualify vendors capable of providing repair
services and supplies for the District's personal computers and
telecommunication operations.
<P>
In accordance with the District's Consultant Selection Policy
and Procedure, a public notice inviting bids was published in
the Los Angeles Times, L.A. Sentinel, La Opinion, Orange County
Register, Riverside Press Enterprise, AQMD BBS, San Bernardino
Sun, The M/W/DVBE Source, and RFP/Bid Information Line.
<P>
Copies of the RFP were mailed to forty-one bidders (Attachment
A).  Responses were received from two bidders, Microage Computermart
and Mitsuba Corporation.  Staff has completed the evaluation and
selection process and has qualified these two bidders. Both bidders
meet the minimum requirements identified in the RFP.  Staff believes
that these vendors will be able to provide about 80% of parts
and repair services required in support of the District's personal
computer infrastructure.  Items not available from these two vendors
will be acquired in accordance with the District's Administrative
Policies and Procedures.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
 --Approve Microage Computermart and Mitsuba Corporation as qualified
<BR>
   vendors who will provide PC, LAN, WAN replacement parts and
repair <BR>
   services.

<P>
On May 15, 1995 the District released a Request for Proposals
(RFP) for Library Services and Supplies.  The purpose of this
RFP is to pre-qualify vendors to provide various library services
and supplies such as technical and legal books, miscellaneous
book purchases and multi-media materials; subscription services,
including periodical, legal book and miscellaneous subscriptions;
and professional services, including cataloging, inter-library
loan and loose leaf filing.

<P>
*Submitted Written Comments
<P>
In summary, the consensus was that the Work Program is well-balanced,
covering virtually all the types of technologies that could be
used for reduction of mobile source emissions; will provide cities
the resources to employ advanced transportation technology and
facilitate the infrastructure for the public to use it; targets
advancement of the type of transportation technologies included
in AQMD's Air Quality Management Plan and Southern California
Association of Governments' Reasonability Plan; and is a key element
to achieving clean air and promoting economic vitality in the
South Coast region.
<P>
Comments were focused largely on the environmental and economic
benefits to be gained from the proposed &quot;Quick-Charge&quot;
Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Program. In particular, it is expected
to be a catalyst for bringing electric vehicle (EV) production
volume up and prices down, and making EVs more convenient to drive.
EV-related jobs will rise dramatically, and the diversification
of transportation options (EVs, reformulated gasoline, natural
gas) will lead to competition and lower prices to consumers. In
support of the proposed buydown incentive to consumers to purchase
EVs, it was pointed out that each year the oil industry receives
$20 billion in subsidies out of tax money--both in terms of tax
credits and direct money. In addition, the oil industry received
$123 billion during its growth period from 1919 through 1973.
<P>
In support of the School Bus Fleets Request for Proposals, Mr.
Warren commented that: (i) school buses lend very well to zero-emission
propulsion since most school routes fall within the driving profile
and range readily achievable with present zero-emission onboard
energy storage technology; (ii) most school buses have limited
cycles--primarily in the morning and afternoon--leaving time for
charging during the day; (iii) the differential costs for zero-emission
or alternative-fuel school buses can readily be justified on reduced
emissions alone; and (iv) children are especially susceptible
to the effects of pollution; therefore it is fitting to eliminate
to the greatest extent possible the immediate sources of pollution
around children.
<P>
Speaking in opposition to the recommendation by MSRC were:
<P>
*WAYNE KING, Concerned Citizen
<P>
BILL WARD, Drivers for Highway Safety
<P>
ANITA MANGELS, Californians Against Hidden Taxes
<P>
<U>LES BERRIMAN, Drivers for Highway Safety </U>
<P>
*Submitted Written Comments
<P>
Mr. King, Ms. Mangels and Mr. Ward expressed opposition to the
EV buydown incentive and suggested that the $6 million for that
proposal be distributed to other alternatives. Mr. King read an
abstract from a paper by Vlado Bevc of California Public Utilities
Commission raising the issue of the effects which the introduction
of electric vehicles will have on electric rates and the demand
for production, processing and recycling of lead for use in batteries.
<P>
Mr. Berriman referred to a recent &quot;white paper&quot; by John
Peters, AQMD Advisory Council member, stating that evidence of
the association between magnetic fields and adverse health effects
is strong enough that many informed policy analysts are suggesting
prudent avoidance--such as discontinuing use of electric blankets
and not building power lines close to homes. While the scientific
data is being assembled to clarify current gray issues, it seemed
to him appropriate to consider thoroughly the implications of
exchanging a car that pollutes for one that may necessitate an
increase in magnetic fields.
<P>
<U>Written Comments Submitted by:</U> 
<P>
John Stearns, California Council on Science and Technology
<P>
Janis Day Christensen, National Association of Fleet Administrators
<P>
Sally Rakow, California Energy Commission
<P>
(Mr. Antonovich arrived at 10:15 a.m. and Mr. Silva left at 10:30
a.m., during public testimony)
<P>
Speaking in support of MSRC's recommendation, Mr. Braude expressed
his belief that most of the accomplishments made thus far in eliminating
pollutants from the air have been the result of AQMD pushing the
state-of-the-art in technology. The projects in the Work Program
are technology-neutral and, he believes, in the best public interest
in terms of achieving clean air.
<P>
Ms. Soto commented on the Board's policy of supporting efforts
to commercialize EVs and alternate fuel vehicles; and expressed
the importance of this item to her, as a representative of many
cities that are depressed and have high unemployment rates, because
of the jobs that will be created as well as the emissions that
will be reduced. By approving this item, she believed the Board
will indicate that it still stands by its commitment to clean
the air while promoting the improvement of the economy and quality
of life in this region.
<P>
Ms. Haggard commented that the AB 2766 fee is a line item on motor
vehicle registration; not a &quot;hidden tax&quot;. It was her
belief that the real hidden taxes are the cost increases that
businesses must pass along to consumers as a result of burdensome
regulations by agencies such as the AQMD in their efforts to meet
federal and state mandates. By supporting the rapid development
of advanced transportation technologies such as the MSRC proposals,
she believes the Board is appropriately requiring drivers to share
in the cost of reducing emissions from mobile sources.
<P>
Indicating his full support for MSRC's recommendation, Mr. Mikels
commented on the rideshare bills currently before the legislature
which will affect AQMD Regulation XV and result in a shortfall
in terms of the emissions reduction deficit for mobile sources
in the South Coast region. He added that the general consensus
of the Board was that because of some of those measures and the
rejection by our electorate and the constituents of certain behavioral
modification rules encapsulated in the indirect source rules,
reliance upon technology-based measures is now doubly important.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. BRAUDE, SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ, A UNANIMOUS
VOTE WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Loveridge
and Silva) APPROVING AGENDA ITEM NO. 10 AS RECOMMENDED.
<P>

University of California, Riverside's College of Engineering -
Center for Environmental Research and Technology
<P>
At Mr. Hewitt's request, Dr. Lents agreed to have a staff member
meet with Mr. Hewitt and provide him information on the University
of California, Riversides' College of Engineering - Center for
Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT).
<P>
15. Recommendation to Appropriate Funds for Phase II of the PM10
Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP), Recognize Co-Sponsor Revenues,
and Release Request for Proposals in Support of the PTEP
<P>
Mr. Hewitt expressed his concern and opposition to the initial
idea of dividing the PM10 Task Force into two subgroups; one being
a Technology Working Group. He believed the task force would be
most effective in its entirety.
<P>
16. Recommendation to Amend Contract to Determine Limits of Best
Available Control<BR>
Measures for Fugitive Dust Under High Wind Conditions
<P>
In response to Dr. Burke, Planning Director Jack Broadbent explained
that the additional $19,872 recommended was necessitated by the
need for installation and leasing of field monitoring equipment
which had been dismantled after the 1994 windy season. Because
there were insufficient high wind events during 1994 to meet project
objectives, staff plans to set up the equipment again during the
1995 fall windy season in expectation of a sufficient number of
high wind events to enable staff to complete its study.
<P>
20. Rule Forecast Report
<P>
Dr. Lents noted the following addition and correction to the Rule
Forecast Report, both of which were set forth in the <I>Errata
Sheet</I> distributed to Board members and made available to the
public:
<P>
<B>On Page 1</B> - A public hearing on &quot;Best Available Control
Technology Methodology Report&quot; was added for the September
1995 Board Meeting; and
<P>
<B>On Page 2</B> - The date for the VOC RECLAIM Study Session
was changed from September 8 to September 7, 1995.
<P>
24. Recommendation Regarding a Request for Proposals for Program
Development to<BR>
Simplify and Streamline Permitting Requirements
<P>
In response to Dr. Burke, Stationary Source Compliance DEO Pat
Leyden and Assistant DEO William Fray explained that staff was
attempting to set up a certification/registration program by the<I>
type of small business</I> rather than having the equipment manufacturer
certifying, on their initiative, the particular <I>types of equipment</I>.
This recommendation responds to Item II of Chairman Mikels' Business
Clean Air Partnership and begins to move small businesses away
from onerous requirements and into a simple registration program.

<P>
Ms. Haggard highlighted Item No. 3 on the Report, concerning update
training for Employee Transportation Coordinators (ETCs). There
was extensive discussion and concerns raised on this issue at
the Board's May 12, 1995 meeting, and Ms. Haggard pointed out
that staff has rapidly addressed all of those concerns. ETCs will
have the option of reading a pamphlet, in lieu of attending training
sessions, and returning to the AQMD a voucher signed by the ETC
certifying that they have read and understand the entire pamphlet.
AQMD will continue to offer training sessions, free of charge
to attendees, in lieu of or in addition to reading the pamphlet;
and these training sessions will be held at public buildings in
order to reduce costs.

<P>
35. Legislative Committee Report and Recommendations
<P>
The following individuals addressed the Board regarding SB 772
(Hurtt) -- Prohibit Trip Reduction Plans:
<P>
CURTIS COLEMAN, Attorney, Southern California Air Quality Alliance
of the California <U>Manufacturers' Association </U>
<P>
1) Urged the Board to support SB 772 (Hurtt) which would eliminate
the trip reduction plan requirement under state law for the South
Coast region. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is under
a congressional directive not to impose sanctions on states that
do not implement the employee commute option program, and he expressed
the Alliance's belief that California should join the 11 states
that have either suspended or are seriously re-thinking implementation
of trip reduction plans.
<P>
2) Urged the Board to change its position on SB 962 (Russell),
<I>Emission Fees</I>--a bill not included in the Committee's Report--from
&quot;oppose&quot; to &quot;support&quot;. This bill, which was
originally sponsored by the Alliance, was designed to prohibit
the AQMD from imposing the RECLAIM trading credit emission allocation
fee. It was the Alliance's belief that this fee is unfair and
discriminates against RECLAIM sources. The Alliance and AQMD staff
have recently reached an agreement, and the bill has been amended
to provide AQMD the flexibility to increase individual fees by
greater than the Consumer Price Index (CPI) cap, if necessary,
to resolve inequities in the AQMD's fee system.
<P>
Legislative Director Catherine Witherspoon responded that staff
had planned to provide an analysis of SB 962 at the next meeting
of the Legislative Committee, recommending a &quot;support&quot;
position on the bill.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. MIKELS, SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ, A UNANIMOUS
VOTE WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Loveridge
and Silva) APPROVING THE FOLLOWING CHANGE IN POSITION ON SB 962
(RUSSELL): <I>FROM &quot;SUPPORT WITH AMENDMENTS&quot; TO &quot;SUPPORT
AS AMENDED</I>&quot;.
<P>
<U>BILL WELLS, Pasadena Transportation Management Association</U>

<P>
Commented that SB 772 passed the Assembly Transportation Committee
on July 10, 1995--unamended; and urged the Board to adopt a &quot;support&quot;
position, although the Legislative Committee's recommendation
is &quot;support with amendments&quot;. (Submitted Written Comments.)
<P>
<U>LINDA WAADE, Coalition for Clean Air</U> 
<P>
Encouraged the Board and AQMD staff to make sure, if Regulation
XV is eliminated, that other measures are proposed that will make
up the shortfall in emission reductions. Before that however,
she recommended that Rule 1501.1 be given a chance to prove its
effectiveness.
<P>
Mr. Mikels responded that there was unanimous support by Legislative
Committee members that any such shortfall in emission reductions
be made up from mobile sources.
<P>
Ms. Witherspoon added a correction to staff's analysis on SB 1089
(Polanco). Staff recently learned that Senator Polanco preferred
that <I>only single-county air districts</I> be exempted from
certain socio-economic assessement requirements when adopting
federal or state rules or attempting to streamline their own regulations.
<P>
Ms. Soto commented on lead legislators not acknowledging the difficult
predicament AQMD will be in if Regulation XV is abolished and
AQMD has to find other sources for achieving those emission reductions.
She expressed her belief that the Board should proactively speak
with legislators to gain the assistance and time needed to work
through this predicament. While she recognized the business and
political communities opposition to Regulation XV, she believes
Rule 1501.1 has not been given an adequate opportunity to prove
whether or not it can work.

<U>JAMES THOMAS, California Energy Services </U>
<P>
*Submitted Written Comments
<P>
(Mr. Braude left at 1:30 p.m., during public testimony)
<P>
Industry representatives requested that the Board continue the
public hearing for 90 days pending the outcome on Assembly Bill
531 (Morrissey), which would establish a statewide standard and
statewide registration of certain portable equipment, to be administered
by the Air Resources Board. It was indicated that there has been
no opposition to AB 531 and it will most likely pass. Full support
was expressed for a statewide registration program; however, industry
has numerous concerns with both the California Air Pollution Control
Officers Association (CAPCOA) Portable Equipment Model Rule and
AQMD's Proposed Rule 2100. Since the release of CAPCOA's Model
Rule in April 1994, only four California air districts have adopted
the rule; and each of those districts has made slight changes
in their rule. Industry believes this defeats the intent of consistency
and uniformity among the different air districts in statewide
registration of this equipment.
<P>
In response to a question by Mr. Paulitz as to whether the public
hearing would still need to go forward if AB 531 does pass, Mr.
Fray clarified that AB 531 would then become law on January 1,
1996 and ARB will promulgate a rule approximately January 1, 1997.
Staff believed the Board would therefore want to adopt Proposed
Rule 2100 sooner than January 1997. <BR>
Mr. Paulitz expressed his desire to have a revised Proposed Rule
2100 brought back to the Board in 90 days after staff has worked
with industry on addressing their concerns with the existing proposed
rule so that there is a rule in place for the portable equipment
until ARB's rule projected for January 1997.

South Coast Air Quality
<P>
Management District Board
<H2><CENTER> Set A Public Hearing for the September 1995 Board
Meeting to Adopt Proposed Rules 1612 - Credits for Clean On-Road
Vehicles and 1620 - Credits for Clean Off-Road Mobile Equipment
<FONT SIZE=5> </FONT></H2>
<HR>

<P>
<A NAME="DDE_LINK3"></A>During the public hearing on Regulation
XX - RECLAIM, several representatives of stationary source facilities
expressed interest in developing mobile source credit programs
which will provide additional opportunities to comply with District
regulations. In response, Proposed Rules 1612 and 1620 have been
developed to provide greater opportunities to generate mobile
source emission reduction credits (MSERC) that could be used as
an alternative means of compliance with District regulations.
The administrative procedures are similar between the two proposed
rules. Proposed Rule 1612 applies to on-road motor vehicles and
1620 applies to off-road mobile equipment. The proposed rules
would meet the 1994 Air Quality Management Plan commitment for
control measures MON-05, MON-06, and MOF-04.
<P>
Under the provisions of Proposed Rules 1612 and 1620, on-road
motor vehicle operators or off-road mobile equipment operators
can choose the most cost-effective compliance alternatives to
suit their needs. Voluntary implementation through the purchase
of new low- or zero-emission vehicles or off-road equipment, or
retrofitting or repowering of existing heavy-duty vehicles and
off-road equipment, or permanent replacement of existing off-road
mobile equipment with non-polluting alternatives, will result
in MSERCs which can be used to comply with other District regulations
or be traded to other facilities. The MSERC calculation is based
on emission standards established by the California Air Resources
Board (ARB) or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
or through alternative engine testing which follows ARB certification
test procedures (subject to District and ARB approval). Operators
will participate in these programs if these alternatives are less
costly to implement than other District regulations. In addition,
the proposed rules provide additional incentives to promote advanced
technological vehicles and equipment by providing credits for
these technologies. On balance, implementation of the proposed
rules will result in increased flexibility and cost effectiveness.
<P>
Pursuant to the District's Certified Regulatory Program (Rule
110), the District has prepared appropriate California Environmental
Quality Act documentation, consisting of a Draft Environmental
Assessment (EA). The Draft EA has been circulated for a 30-day
public review and comment period and is included as part of this
package. A Final EA will be prepared which includes responses
to all comments received on the Draft EA.
<P>
The attachments to this package contain an outline of the rule
development process (Attachment A), Proposed Rules 1612 and 1620
along with a draft staff report for each rule (Attachments B and
C), Draft EA (Attachment D), and the Draft Socioeconomic Analysis
(Attachment E).
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Set a public hearing September 8, 1995 to adopt Rule 1612 -
Credits for Clean On-Road Motor Vehicles and Rule 1620 - Credits
for Clean Off-Road Mobile Equipment.

<P>
<A HREF="mailto:pleyden@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
( pleyden@aqmd.gov )
<P>
<I>The objectives of the proposed amendments to Rules 2011 and
2012 are to: (1) establish provisions for reclassifying RECLAIM
major sources as large NOx or SOx process units if the facility
reduces emissions of these pollutants to the level of their year
2003 allocations and retires their excess RECLAIM Trading Credits;
(2) expand the range of acceptable Continuous Emission Monitoring
Systems (CEMS) data to 10 to 95 percent of the full CEMS range;
and (3) include a more accurate, tiered approach of measuring
emissions from major sources when their CEMS are measuring concentrations
below 10 percent of the full CEMS range.</I> 
<P>
<B>5. <A HREF="950805.html">Amend Rule 461 </A>- Gasoline Transfer

<P>
<A HREF="mailto:wfray@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
( wfray@aqmd.gov )
<P>
<I>The proposed amendments will incorporate new procedures and
technologies in order to further enhance the effectiveness of
the Phase I and Phase II vapor recovery systems and thereby reduce
the VOC emissions from gasoline transfer and dispensing operations.
The amendments include a self-compliance program and a number
of new rule measures, originating from the Federal Implementation
Plan (rescinded by President Clinton on April 10, 1995), State
Implementation Plan, Air Quality Management Plan and recommendations
from the public and staff.</I>

<P>
<I>This proposed rule will implement Item X of the Business Clean

<I>Electric vehicles (EVs) are essential elements of the AQMP
for both on- and off-road applications. Fuel cells are thought
to be an ideal solution for EV propulsion because they can provide
high fuel efficiency, zero emissions, long range, and fast refueling.

on-road use of electric golf carts, has proposed AQMD-cosponsorship
of a project to demonstrate small &quot;neighborhood&quot; EVs
powered by fuel cells running on renewable hydrogen, with zero
systems emissions. The proposed project involves the City of Palm
Desert, the Schatz Energy Research Center, the US Department of
Energy (DOE), and various private corporations. The total cost

<I>Electric vehicles (EVs) are essential elements of the AQMP
for both on- and off-road applications. Fuel cells are thought
to be an ideal solution for EV propulsion because they can provide
high fuel efficiency, zero emissions, long range, and fast refueling.
The City of Palm Desert, which has been a model community for
on-road use of electric golf carts, has proposed AQMD-cosponsorship
of a project to demonstrate small &quot;neighborhood&quot; EVs
powered by fuel cells running on renewable hydrogen, with zero
systems emissions. The proposed project involves the City of Palm
Desert, the Schatz Energy Research Center, the US Department of
Energy (DOE), and various private corporations. The total cost
of this three-year project is estimated to be $4,288,440, of which
DOE is expected to provide approximately 40 percent. AQMD has
been asked to provide $825,000 over 36 months. Staff proposes

*Submitted Written Comments
<P>
(Mr. Antonovich arrived at 10:05, during public testimony.)
<P>
There was substantial testimony by users, manufacturers and suppliers
of wood products coatings regarding the status of waterborne technology
for this industry. While progress has been made, existing waterborne
coatings that will comply with the September 1, 1995 VOC limits
in Rule 1136 are not suitable for use by the large majority of
companies subject to the rule requirements. Additionally, significant
time and cost is required to convert operations to waterborne
technology. Industry representatives raised the following issues
and suggestions, which were not addressed by PAR 1136:
<P>
<B>Issue</B>: Despite diligent effort, 90 percent of the affected
companies are unable to comply with the VOC limits in Subsection
(c)(1)(A) of Rule 1136 which will become effective September 1,
1995.
<P>
<B>Suggestion</B>: Extend the existing VOC limits to July 1, 1996,
as currently allowed by special exemptions now in the rule.
<P>
<B>Issue</B>: Potentially 150 of the affected companies could
be included in VOC RECLAIM, expected for Board adoption in January
1996; and at that time those companies would be allowed to continue
using solvent-based coatings. It would be a tremendous hardship
to the companies if required to convert their operations to waterborne
coatings for the interim period between September 1995 and January
1996.
<P>
<B>Suggestion</B>: Dovetail Rule 1136 requirements with VOC RECLAIM.
<P>
<B>Issue</B>: AQMD staff is pushing the use of waterborne coatings.
These coatings contain glycol ethers, which will soon be officially
listed as toxic. This will create another &quot;Catch-22&quot;
situation, as 1,1,1, Trichloroethane did when staff pushed industry
in that direction, only to declare it an ODC.
<P>
<B>Suggestion</B>: Incentivize using waterborne coatings by allowing
quarterly reports, rather than daily logs. Also, allow averaging
of super-complying and under-complying formulations without any
discounting.
<P>
<B>Issue</B>: Acetone has recently been determined by EPA to be
non-reactive. Exempting acetone would allow industry greater flexibility
in the types of coatings that could be used.
<P>
<B>Suggestion</B>: Immediately exclude acetone from the definition
of VOC set forth in Subparagraph (b)(39) of Rule 1136.
<P>
With respect to the acetone exemption, Dr. Lents responded that
in June 1995 EPA made the determination that acetone is non-reactive,
and ARB has agreed with that determination. Staff is presently
conducting the CEQA review, and expects to bring this issue to
the Board in October or November 1995.
<P>
Regarding the lower VOC limits and status of waterborne coatings,
William Fray, Assistant DEO/Stationary Source Compliance, responded
that this issue was last considered by the Board in August 1994,
when the Board adopted the Sept. 1, 1995 date for the lower VOC
limits. Since then, staff has been working with industry as directed,
visiting facilities and checking on industry progress and expectations
as far as compliance with the September 1 VOC limits. Based on
the public testimony, however, it seemed that facility operators
were reluctant to tell AQMD inspectors that their operations would
not comply with the rule.
<P>
In addition, in May 1995 staff sent letters to 900 companies offering
assistance and asking if there were any companies or issues that
AQMD was not aware of; as well as reminding them of AQMD's small
business assistance and technology assistance programs. AQMD received
only three responses to that letter.
<P>
The reason for staff bringing PAR 1136 to the Board at this time
was to respond to rule deficiencies identified by EPA. It was
only by circumstance that the rule is in the amendment process,
and the proposed amendments can be revised to address most of
the issues raised by industry.
<P>
Concerned that 90 percent of industry could be out of compliance
as of September 1, Mr. Silva expressed his support for delaying
the lower VOC limits until July 1996 as suggested by industry.
He also expressed concern that if VOC RECLAIM is adopted in January
1996, the economic effects to industry would be devastating for
them to try to comply with the lower VOC limits between September
1995 and January 1996.
<P>
Referring to staff's representation that 80 to 90 percent of the
facility owners/operators surveyed expected to be in compliance
and were content with Rule 1136, Ms. Lee suggested that any future
surveys of this type be conducted by independent, non-AQMD personnel.
<P>
Dr. Burke commented that he visited facilities and found that
concerns were not forthcoming from the facility operators. He
pointed out that if the operators do not let the real facts be
known, it is difficult for the Board to evaluate the rule in any
other light than what is provided by staff.
<P>
In response to a question by Chairman Mikels, District Counsel
Peter Greenwald expressed staff's belief that the public notice
and CEQA documents for the September 8, 1995 public hearing on
PAR 1136 are broad enough to permit the Board to undertake all
five of the suggestions by industry--except for the acetone exemption.
With there being only one week between the September 1, 1995 effective
date for the lower VOC limits and the September 8, 1995 public
hearing on PAR 1136 when the Board will consider extending the
effective date for those limits, the Board could direct staff,
as a matter of prosecutorial discretion, to devote its enforcement
resources elsewhere for that week.
<P>
Mr. Loveridge commented that there should be some type of incentive
or advantage for those who have complied with the lower VOC limits;
and expressed his support for industry's suggestion to incentivize
use of waterborne coatings.
<P>
Ms. Soto agreed with Ms. Lee's comments on the survey process,
and emphasized the need for truthful responses to the surveys
in order for staff to be accurate in the statements and recommendations
that they make to the Board.
<P>
In response to a question by Mr. Hewitt, Mr. Fray indicated that
the extension of the VOC limits eclipses the acetone issue, since
acetone is an alternative way to meet those limits.

<P>
*Submitted Written Comments
<P>
Mr. Howekamp commented that the proposed amendments to Regulation
XXX represent AQMD's considerable efforts to efficiently address
issues which EPA had identified in the October 1993 version of
the regulation, and also the issues raised by industry with respect
to the June 1995 version. He believed that, if adopted by the
Board as proposed, amended Regulation XXX would be eligible for
interim approval by EPA.
<P>
During public testimony unanimous support was expressed for the
proposed amendments to Regulation XXX, and three major issues
were raised. Those issues (indicated by ), and comments/suggestions
relating to each, are summarized as follows:
<P>
Development of a proposed amendment to Rule 518 to establish procedures
by which a Title V facility obtaining a variance from the AQMD
Hearing Board may obtain approval of an alternative operating
condition that would be recognized by EPA.<BR>
<BR>
(i) A monthly progress report on development of the proposed amendment
should be given <BR>
to the Governing Board.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) The public hearing on the proposed amendments to Rule 518
should be set by the Board <BR>
for December 8, 1995.<BR>
<BR>
(iii) Because of concerns that shorter term variances may not
be the beneficiary of EPA <BR>
approval, staff should continue during the next two months to
explore options for <BR>
handling interim variances and short variances that address both
industry's needs and <BR>
EPA's concerns, with minimal administrative burden.
<P>
Technical Guidance Document (TGD), which provides detailed implementation
instructions to assist facilities in application preparation and
compliance.<BR>
<BR>
(i) The TGD is an integral part of Regulation XXX and makes implicit
and explicit policy <BR>
clarifications. Therefore, it should be adopted by the Board at
a public hearing; <U>or</U> <BR>
reviewed by the Board's Stationary Source Committee and brought
before the full Board <BR>
for action only if there are unresolved issues remaining after
the Committee's review.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) The TGD should be revised to conform with the proposed amendments
to Regulation <BR>
XXX; and to reflect comments received on the TGD and on the forms
during the public<BR>
comment period on the TGD.
<P>
Interim guidance/flexibility from EPA.<BR>
<BR>
(i) Any interim guidance issued by EPA in memo or white paper
form to further streamline <BR>
or make the program more flexible should be implemented immediately;
as well as the <BR>
implementation as soon as possible of any flexibility that results
when 40 CFR Part 70 is <BR>
re-promulgated.
<P>
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P>
<U>Written Comments Submitted by:</U> 
<P>
John Billheimer, Consultant
<P>
Ms. Soto commented in favor of the Board approving the TGD for
implementation as soon as possible. If, after the public comment
period, there are significant changes made to the TGD, it should
be brought back to the Board for review.
<P>
Mr. Greenwald pointed out that the TGD currently does not conform
with the proposed amendments to Regulation XXX. In addition, Carol
Coy, Assistant Director of Stationary Source Compliance, commented
that staff anticipates additional guidance and flexibility from
EPA in October 1995 on a number of key issues that should be incorporated
into the TGD. Therefore, the earliest that staff could commit
to having the TGD ready for adoption by the Board would be December
1995. Staff recommended, however, that the TGD be brought back
to the Board for adoption after EPA has taken action on approving
AQMD's Title V program, which is not expected to occur until January
1996.
<P>

<P>
Management District Board
<H3><CENTER> Recommendation to Release a Request for Proposals
to Prepare Air Toxics &quot;Hot Spots&quot; Information and Assessment
Act Health Risk Assessments <FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
Pursuant to the California Air Toxics &quot;Hot Spots&quot; Information
and Assessment Act of 1987 (AB 2588), the South Coast Air Quality
Management District (AQMD) is responsible for ensuring adequate
health risk assessments (HRAs) are prepared. In the past, each
individual facility has prepared their own HRA. However, in order
to reduce costs to facilities and streamline the process, the
AQMD Governing Board directed the staff to develop a voluntary
pilot program at their August 11, 1995 meeting. Under the pilot
program, the AQMD would oversee the preparation of the HRAs for
facilities. The purpose of this letter is to request Board concurrence
to release a Request for Proposals (RFP) to secure contractual
assistance to prepare the HRAs.
<P>
<B>Scope and Purpose of Contract</B> 
<P>
Under AB 2588, certain facilities are required to prepare an HRA
to determine the level of risk facilities pose to the exposed
public. Facilities entered AB 2588 in three phases depending upon
the amount of criteria and air toxic emissions emitted. Facilities
in phase 1 of the program have already prepared HRAs. Facilities
in phases 2 and 3 have not yet been requested to prepare HRAs
as required by state law. Under the direction of the AQMD, the
contractor(s) will prepare HRAs for facilities in phases 2 and
3.
<P>
This contract will be one part of a pilot program designed to
provide facilities with a lower cost and streamlined alternative
to preparing their own HRAs. Contractual assistance is needed
to implement the pilot program because:
<UL>
<LI>there is a need to augment the limited AQMD staff who are
specialists in this field to accommodate the potential work load,

<H3><CENTER> Recommendation to Pre-Qualify Vendors to Provide
Various Non-Consultant Services and Supplies <FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
On July 14, 1995, the Board approved the release of several Request
for Quotations (RFQs) which would be used to establish a list
of pre-qualified vendors from whom competitive bids may be solicited
for the purchase of various non-consultant services and supplies.
<P>
In accordance with District's Contracting and Purchasing Policy,
a public notice inviting bids was published in the Los Angeles
Times, La Opinion, Orange County Register, Riverside Press Enterprise,
and San Bernardino Sun on June 15 and 22, 1995, and in the M/W/DVBE
Source and the Los Angeles Sentinel on June 14, 1995. In addition
it was also placed on the AQMD's Bulletin Board Services ( BBS)
and RFP/Bid Information Line, and bids were mailed to various
vendors.
<P>
Nine bids were mailed to suppliers of unleaded fuel,and three
vendors (see Attachment) responded with bids by the closing date,
July 28, 1995. All three vendors met the evaluation criteria for
performance, references, experience, and cost factors. These vendors
represent three different refineries and since each refinery's
price per gallon fluctuates per week, staff recommends that all
three vendors be certified as pre-qualified in order that the
best price be obtained each time an order is placed.
<P>
Six bids were mailed to suppliers of photocopy/printing paper
and all six responded with bids by the closing date July 11, 1995.
Two of the bidders (see Attachment) met the paper minimum content
specifications of 35% post-consumer and 15% pre-consumer waste.
The two bids are also cost competitive. Due to the changing conditions
in the recycled paper market and the paper mills' price changes,
staff recommends that the two vendors be certified as pre-qualified
so that the best price can be obtained at the time an order is
placed.
<P>
SCAQMD Board -2- September 8, 1995
<P>
The recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Administrative
Committee at its meeting on August 18, 1995.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Approve the list of pre-qualified vendors on the Attachment.
<P>
--Authorize staff to establish blanket purchase order agreements
through June 30, 1996.

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
The Legislative Committee held its regular meeting on Friday,
August 18, 1995. An attendance record is included for your information
(<I>Attachment 1</I>).
<P>
<U><B>Summary of Recommendations</B></U> 
<P>
SB 456 (Kelley) -- Best Available Control Technology: Change District
position from OPPOSE<I> to</I> NEUTRAL.
<P>
Create three member &quot;Action&quot; subcommittee, representing
the breadth of Governing Board views, to provide more timely direction
to the Legislative Director.
<P>
<U><B>Report</B></U> 
<P>
<U>Legislative Status Report</U> 
<P>
Staff provided a comprehensive status report on pending legislation,
a shorter list of 16 bills that most directly affect District
programs, and final language for eight bills signed into law by
Governor Wilson <I>(Attachments 2, 3 and 4, respectively). </I>In
addition, the Committee specifically discussed the following bills:
<UL>
<LI>AB 531 (Morrissey) would establish a voluntary, statewide
registration for portable equipment. Staff has been working with
the bill's sponsors and the Air Resources Board to smooth SB 531's
implementation. No change to the District's <I>Support</I> position
is recommended. <BR>

<LI>SB 456 (Kelley) concerns Best Available Control Technology
determinations and retrofit control measures. The District originally
had an <I>Oppose</I> position on the bill since it duplicated
work being done by the District's 19-member Scientific Review
Committee on BACT guidelines and was unnecessary. Since then,
staff has worked with the bill's sponsor, the California Council
for Environment and Economic Balance, to bring SB 456 more in
line with local deliberations. In light of those developments,
staff recommended and the Legislative Committee agreed that the
District's position should be changed from <I>Oppose</I> to <I>Neutral</I>.
<BR>

<LI>SB 501 (Calderon) would create a state-administered vehicle
scrappage program. Board Member Nell Soto expressed concern about
the District's <I>Support</I> position since the passage of SB
501 may ultimately threaten money local governments receive to
implement air quality programs (AB 2766 funds). Consequently,
she asked staff for a written update on SB 501's current language.
Board Member Soto also stated her intent to continue working with
local cities and counties to ensure they are aware of SB 501 and
its consequences, which the Committee encouraged. Barbara Garrett,
Assistant to Board Member Braude, informed the Committee that
the City of Los Angeles had taken a Neutral position on SB 501,
but is still very concerned about the funding source and believes
that AB 2766 funds are still vulnerable. <BR>

<LI>SB 772 (Hurtt) would prohibit mandatory trip reduction plans.
Staff indicated that although this bill failed passage on the
Assembly Floor, reconsideration has been granted and it is expected
to become law. The District's position on this bill is <I>Support
with Amendments</I>. <BR>

<LI>SB 811 (Monteith) would have dissolved the South Coast, Bay
Area, San Joaquin Valley and Mojave Desert AQMDs. Chairman Jon
Mikels inquired about the origins and status of this bill. Staff
explained that it was introduced to address San Joaquin Valley
concerns and died in the first policy committee. The District
had an <I>Oppose</I> position on SB 811.<BR>

<LI>SB 962 (Russell) would modify the District's fee setting authority.
At the last Committee meeting, staff reported that a reasonable
compromise had been worked out with the bill's industrial proponents.
The final language is awaiting sign-off from both sides. Meanwhile,
SB 962 is being held in the &quot;inactive file&quot; on the Assembly
Floor. It is expected to pass once everyone is comfortable. The
District has a <I>Support</I> position on this bill.<BR>

</UL>

<P>
Regarding signed legislation <I>(Attachment 4),</I> Committee
Chairman, Dr. William Burke, inquired whether the District had
supported the eight enacted bills. Staff replied that the District
officially supported four of them: SB 1522 (Brewer) concerning
city membership on the District Governing Board; SB 383 (Lewis)
concerning parking restrictions; SJR 2 (Russell) concerning federal
ridesharing requirements; and SJR 5 (Kopp) concerning overly prescriptive
federal mandates. The District also supported the principles in
AB 533 (Morrissey), exempting portable emergency equipment. The
District had a Watch position on the remaining three bills: AB
110 (Hannigan) concerning electric golf carts; AB 421 (Olberg)
modifying the Mojave Desert air basin boundaries; and SB 1083
(Beverly) concerning oil spill remediation.
<P>
<U>Continued Discussion of District's Legislative Advocacy Program</U>

<P>
At the Legislative Committee's July 21, 1995, meeting, Arthur
Bauer and Associates, Inc., presented that firm's final report
and recommendations on the District's legislative advocacy program.
The presentation prompted several questions from Board Member
Hugh Hewitt about government agencies' legal authority to operate
legislative programs, the underlying philosophy of legislative
advocacy, the District's past and present budget for legislative
activities, accountability of the District's legislative staff,
the process and schedule for engaging a new federal representative,
and the consistency (or lack thereof) between positions taken
by the District, the Air Resources Board, Cal-EPA and Governor
Wilson. The Committee discussed these issues briefly then, since
time was short, postponed fuller discussion until its August meeting.
<P>
Staff provided several reports in response to Board Member Hewitt's
questions. First, District Counsel analyzed state and federal
statutes and concluded that the District is authorized to engage
in legislative advocacy <I>(Attachment 5).</I> Second, a detailed
budget for the District's Legislative unit was provided, with
historical data on staffing and contracts since Fiscal Year 1988-89,
and a comparison to other air quality agencies <I>(Attachment
6). </I>Third, staff researched prior legislative sessions to
determine the dissonance/consistency between District positions
and those of other agencies. This research indicated that the
District's positions align closely with ARB's and match most of
the Governor's final sign/veto decisions. However, the District
has and continues to oppose some of Cal-EPA's reorganization proposals,
preferring other forms of permit streamlining, cost reductions
or institutional composition. There has also been some partisan
tension in the past since the District relied heavily on the legislative
leadership (then solely Democrat) instead of the Administration
(then and still Republican). Regarding federal representation,
staff reported at a prior meeting that the District's current
contract with Leon Billings, Inc., expires on December 31, 1995.
No decision has been made about federal representation after that
date.
<P>
Following staff's oral and written reports, Board Chairman Mikels
asked for clarification about Board Member Hewitt's (who was absent
due to a scheduling conflict) philosophical concerns. Board Member
James Silva ventured that the concern related more to <I>how</I>
the District carries out its legislative program versus actual
positions. Board Member Silva also mentioned the need for staff
judgment when evolving bills moved beyond the Legislative Committee's
specific directions. Dr. Burke agreed that the extent of policy
direction could be improved. Dr. Burke then suggested the formation
of a three-member &quot;Action&quot; subcommittee, representing
the breadth of views on the Governing Board, to provide more timely
input to the Legislative Director. District Counsel advised that
such a subcommittee would be legally permissible if it was delegated
authority by the full Governing Board.
<P>
Regarding legislative policy positions, Ken Bruner, Assistant
to Board Member Hewitt, explained that the concern was to lessen
dissonance between Cal-EPA and the District. Board Members Mikels,
Burke and Wilson responded that the Governing Board needed to
place the District's interests first, and that those interests
may not match Cal-EPA's in every instance. However, unnecessary
conflict is undesirable and should be avoided.
<P>
Regarding staff accountability, Dr. Burke expressed his view that
micromanagement is inappropriate. Instead, the Legislative Director
should be trusted to carry out the Board's policies. If Board
Members are concerned about that, Dr. Burke continued, the Legislative
Director could be dismissed. Mr. Bruner emphasized that the latter
was definitely not Board Member Hewitt's intent, that he's satisfied
with staff's performance, and that his primary interest is the
Board's involvement. At that point, other Committee members indicated
their approval of the Legislative Director's performance thus
far. Finally, Barbara Garrett expressed the City of Los Angeles'
appreciation for the timely and thorough legislative information
provided by District staff (whom she calls regularly for assistance).
<P>
<U>Next Legislative Committee Meeting</U> 
<P>
The next Legislative Committee meeting is Friday, September 22,
at 8:30 a.m. in Conference Room CC8.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE BOARD
<P>
--Approve the recommended position on the above bill;
<P>
--Approve the formation of a three-member &quot;Action&quot; subcommittee;
and
<P>
--Receive and file this report.

<P>
<B>TOPICS</B> 
<P>
<B>1. <U>Overview of TAO Programs </U></B>
<P>
Staff gave a presentation <B>(Attachment III)</B> on upcoming
Technology Advancement Office (TAO) projects that are scheduled
for Board approval during the next three months. Staff indicated
that there will be a two-day contractor review meeting on September
27th &amp; September 28th. Staff will give updates to attendees
on gaseous, liquid fuels, and heavy &amp; light duty vehicle programs.
<P>
Staff is recommending Board approval for the following contracts
in September: Breakthrough Technologies Institute - gather and
provide detailed fuel cell information to staff; Mader &amp; Associates
- provide valuable information on electric vehicles; Kyle Davis
- serve as a District resource for fleet vehicle coordination
and operations; and, T-Gal - facilitate energy interfacing with
alternative fuels.
<P>
During the month of October, TAO will be recommending Board approval
for a joint PM10 health effects study with the California Public
Health Foundation. Monies to fund this project are pass-through
funds received from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
This project will focus on differentiating various health effects.
Analysis of hospital records in the Coachella Valley will be reviewed
to assist in distinguishing specific effects. Staff will also
be recommending approval of a demonstration project to develop
a hybrid electric/propane refuse truck. Staff stated that the
California Air Resources Board is considering the concept of allowing
auto manufacturers to receive emission credits from heavy duty
vehicles and directly apply them toward light duty vehicles.
<P>
In October, staff is recommending Board approval of a contract
with the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) for the third and
final year of the development and demonstration of an ultra-low
Nox natural gas engine. This project, cost-shared with the Southern
California Gas Company, is based on a new engine technology developed
by SwRI called rich-burn/lean-burn technology promises to achieve
Nox emissions from a stationary natural gas engine significantly
below current AQMD rule limits. Lastly, TAO will be recommending
approval of a PM10 contract to obtain actual vehicle sampling
and determine how the results relate to the 2.5 microns and 10
microns thresholds.
<P>
During the month of November, TAO expects to recommend Board approval
on the following projects: Medium duty vehicles with commercial
application. Monies to fund this project will be pass-through
funds from the California Energy Commission; Metallic Power Inc.
- study the use of aluminum air batteries; Amerigon &amp; CEC
- develop an on-board vehicle navigation program. This would give
consumers the ability to locate alternative fuel stations. Given
the distant timeframe, these projects may or may not move forward.
<P>
Chairperson Haggard stated that it would be useful to have a matrix
identifying projects funded from AB2766 monies and TAO monies.
This would ensure that duplication of projects was not taking
place. Staff indicated that Senate Bill 199 (Kelly) would require
the AQMD to carry out a thorough search to avoid duplication.
Staff would also be required to perform a benefits analysis. Staff
will provide the committee with a matrix and report back during
the next quarter.
<P>
Staff pointed out that AB2766 monies are aimed at immediate emissions
reductions, whereas TAO monies have major emphasis on the advancement
of technology. A matrix will be prepared by staff and provided
to the Committee at the next quarterly upate meeting.
<P>
<B>2. <U>Implementation of Rule 1501 and Rule 1501.1 </U></B>
<P>
Staff presented the committee with a copy of EPA's letter <B>(Attachment
IV)</B> indicating approval of Rule 1501.1 as a demonstration
project for Project XL. Staff is working with EPA to complete
the final project agreement. A quarterly progress report will
be given by staff to the Governing Board in October.
<P>
There are currently 41 potential participants in Rule 1501.1.
Staff stated that many companies are awaiting the Board's direction
in October on Rule 1501 and Rule 1501.1 to determine if they will
participate in the program.
<P>
Staff stated that there is currently just over $330,000 in the
investment fund. Staff has scheduled a technology vendor demonstration
for Friday, September 15th to facilitate interaction between employers
and service providers. Staff has invited remote sensing and vehicle
scrapping representatives to showcase their products and services.
<P>
Board Chairman Mikels asked staff for an update on EPA's requirement
of rideshare programs. Staff stated that from what has been said
lately, it seems unlikely at this time that federal requirements
would be changed under the Clean Air Act this year. Board Chairman
Mikels noted that the District may be in a dilemma if SB772 is
passed by the California Legislature, prohibiting mandatory ridesharing
plans, while the federal government continues to require air pollution
control districts to require ridesharing plans.
<P>
<B>3. <U>RFP on Rule 1501.1 Air Quality Investment Program Funds
</U></B>
<P>
Staff has prepared a Request for Proposals (RFPs) to solicit proposals
from individuals and/or entities who can submit projects that
demonstrate equivalent emission reductions. Ken Bruner, Assistant
to Boardmember Hewitt, stated that some of the monies should be
used to fund research projects at CE-CERT on an endowment basis
for future emissions reductions. Board Chairman Mikels stated
that TAO is already working with CE-CERT to commence such research
projects and funding is part of that support. Staff indicated
that the AQMD has made a commitment to EPA to achieve emissions
equivalency as a condition of participation in President Clinton's
XL program. Staff stated that notification of the Air Quality
Investment Program RFP will include Rule 1501 employers, local
governments, Rule 1610 and Rule 1612 companies and others. As
the program progresses, staff is looking to privatize various
components of the programs so that employers can work directly
with service providers.
<P>
Chairperson Haggard asked staff how the Air Quality Investment
Program dovetails with the Mobile Source Review Committee program
and whether it was duplicative. Staff stated that the Air Quality
Investment Program will be directed toward private entities as
well as public agencies in that proposals could be submitted by
anyone interested. There is no direct emphasis placed on matching
funds and consideration will be given to selecting projects in
the same county from which investment funds are received.
<P>
<B>4.</B> <U><B>Progress Report on Shopping Centers Study </B></U>
<P>
Staff noted that a shopping center measure is included as part
of the 1994 Air Quality Management Plan's (AQMP) Indirect Source
Rules (ISRs). The AQMP relied on data from the Origination and
Destination Study to obtain emission inventory figures for each
ISR. Detailed information regarding shopping centers is currently
not available. Staff issued an RFP and received 8 proposals. A
committee consisting of outside evaluators reviewed and scored
the submitted proposals. Attachment V outlines how the Study fits
into the rule development process.
<P>
Board Chairman Mikels asked staff what criteria is being used
to determine what shopping centers will be subject to analysis.
Staff stated that the study results will be used to define the
potential universe and criteria of applicability. Staff will review
the emission reduction projections in the AQMP and look at the
characteristics of various shopping center size categories to
determine whether the emission reduction target can be met. Staff
will form a working group to gather input on the development of
a menu-driven proposal. Board Chairman Mikels stated that the
goal of the analysis should not be to cover all shopping centers
but to affect only those centers that would achieve the required
emissions reduction targets. Staff stated that the shopping center
measure will require a coordinated effort between local governments
and shopping center representatives.
<P>
Chairperson Haggard stated that market incentives are vital to
replacing ISRs which are unattractive and unappealing measures.
Chairman Mikels agreed. Boardmember Soto stated that local governments
are experiencing financial difficulties and cannot afford additional
restrictions that may affect their revenue. Board Chairman Mikels
stated that perhaps the AQMD should direct funds toward the source
of the problem. For example, schools could be allocated monies
to address their student driving population through greater use
of clean-fueled buses. The 1994 AQMP does not require implementation
of ISRs until 1997. The development of these ISRs during the next
two years is to ensure that they are used as back-stop rules if
market incentives do not occur. Boardmember Soto stated that she
is not in support of developing a shopping center rule.
<P>
<B>5. <U>Status Report on Proposed Rule 1612 and Rule 1620 </U></B>
<P>
Staff has scheduled public hearings on Proposed Rule 1612 - Clean
On Road Vehicles and Rule 1620 - Clean Off Road Equipment, for
the September Board meeting. Staff summarized recent proposed
changes and issues raised at the second public consultation meeting
that was held on July 6, 1995. Staff highlighted issues that are
under further evaluation and may require Board direction. Staff
has included as part of the handouts, copies of letters from the
Southern California Edison Company and the National Association
of Fleet Administrators <B>(Attachment VI)</B>.
<P>
<B>6. <U>Recommendation to Award Bid for Application of an Episode
Aerosol/Visibility Model to the South Coast Basin </U></B>
<P>
Staff stated that 63 Request for Proposals were sent out to perspective
bidders. Staff received proposals from only one consultant. An
evaluation panel (comprised of the U.S. EPA, CARB, an automotive
representative, and AQMD staff) reviewed the submitted proposal
and gave it a score of 92.5 out of a possible 100 for technical
qualification. Staff is recommending that the contract be awarded
to Sonoma Technology Inc. <B>(Attachment VII)</B>. Staff stated
that the PM10 task force members, consisting of leading competitors
for this RFP, were aware of the project. Boardmember Soto stated
that staff needs to give bidders sufficient time to respond to
RFP proposal requests.
<P>
<B>7. <U>Status report on REACH Task Force </U></B>
<P>
Staff highlighted the agenda items that were discussed at the
August 23rd meeting <B>(Attachment VIII &amp; IX)</B>. SCAG presented
the consultant team who will be researching and developing a specific
aspect of the study. The three selected consultants are Wilbur
Smith Associates, the DeVinny Group and Guerra &amp; Associates.
A presentation was given by Ed Regan of Wilbur Smith Associates
on current pricing projects and expressed concern over the short
turn-around period for bids.
<P>
Ward Elliott gave the task force a presentation on vehicle miles
traveled versus &quot;pure&quot; congestion pricing. Ward Elliott
stated that research indicated that &quot;pure&quot; congestion
pricing was the more effective approach. Staff stated that EPA
and AQMD staff believe that data presented was significantly flawed
and contrary to recent work completed for CARB.
<P>
Board Chairman Mikels mentioned that straw proposals were being
revised by the consultant team in an effort to focus the direction
of the Task Force. He stated that obtaining emission reduction
credits from High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes may be a less
painful way to convert free lanes into lanes that require a fee.
Boardmember Soto stated that this approach would punish those
vehicles who utilize the HOV lanes and not those vehicles who
use the mixed lanes and are the single occupancy vehicles. Boardmember
Loveridge asked at what level would congestion pricing be effective.
Board Chairman Mikels stated that one measure of effectiveness
would be acceptability by the public that would motivate legislators
to move forth on legislation to support congestion pricing. During
1990, congestion was a high priority. In 1995, congestion is no
longer on the top of the priority list as a major concern.
<P>
Jacki Bacharach stated that a congestion pricing symposium will
be held on September 8th in the Inland Empire. The workshop is
being co-sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA),
the Humphry Institute at the University of Minnesota, and the
Claremont Graduate School.
<P>
<B>8.</B> <U><B>Status Report on PM10 Task Force </B></U>
<P>
Staff gave a briefing <B>(Attachment X)</B> on the PM10 Task Force.
Staff indicated that the Task Force consists of 45 members whose
charter is to review and develop the PM10 measures which are identified
in the 1994 AQMP for inclusion in the 1997 PM10 submittal. Staff
highlighted projects that are funded under the PM10 Tech Program.
<P>
<B>9.</B> <U><B>Rule 1501/1501.1/ISRs Activity Report </B></U>
<P>
As an update to the Activity Report, a draft agenda for the District-sponsored
parking management symposium to be held on September 29, 1995
is included as <B>Attachment XI</B>. Boardmembers Mikels, Haggard
and Soto volunteered to serve as moderators for separate panel
discussions.

PLANNING COMMITTEE
<P>
AUGUST 10, 1995
<P>
<B>TOPICS</B> 
<P>
<B>1. <U>SCAG's Air Quality Chapter for the Regional Comprehensive
Plan </U></B>
<P>
Staff gave an overview of the Southern California Association
of Governments (SCAG) Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide (RCPG)
and the AQMD's proposed comments to the plan. Staff stated that
joint meetings between the AQMD and SCAG were held to discuss
the RCPG's Air Quality Chapter. In 1994 the AQMD submitted comments
on 27 key issues contained in the RCPG but it is felt that nine
issues still have not been satisfactorily addressed.
<P>
Also, staff stated that the overall tone of the RCPG downplays
the AQMD's role and legal responsibilities. It was felt that SCAG
should include only those elements that are under their legal
purview. In addition, staff believed the tone of the RCPG implies
that the AQMD does not have outreach programs that provide services
and information to the public at large. Staff has prepared a draft
response (Attachment A) to SCAG which identifies the AQMD's position.
SCAG has extended the comment period until Friday, August 18,
1995.
<P>
SCAG is scheduled to take the RCPG before its Energy &amp; Environment
Committee in September and the Regional Advisory Council (RAC)
in October 1995.
<P>
Amy Glad of the Building &amp; Industry Association recommended
that the RCPG Air Quality Chapter should be deemed ancillary.
Carla Walecka also commented that the chapter should be ancillary.
<P>
Board Member Candace Haggard asked staff whether the AQMD had
co-authored the RCPG. Staff stated that they did not co-author
the Air Quality Chapter but had been asked to comment.
<P>
Board Member Haggard motioned that the draft letter from the AQMD
be amended to indicate that the Air Quality chapter should be
ancillary and areas where SCAG had legislated authority should
be discussed in other chapters of the RCPG, as appropriate. Additionally,
her motion directed that the revised letter be forwarded to SCAG.
The motion was unanimously approved. The final letter is contained
as Exhibit A.
<P>
<B>2. <U>Inter-credit Trading Study </U></B>
<P>
Staff gave a status report on the Inter-credit Trading Study.
Staff indicated that the study was directed by the Board at its
April meeting to determine the feasibility of trading emission
credits between the mobile source and stationary source markets.
Staff will present preliminary findings to the Board in October
1995. The study is basically evaluating different programs, how
credits are generated and how these credits are applied. Study
objectives include determining how different programs can be linked.
<P>
Staff stated that U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
released an open market trading rule. This would allow a facility
to trade or sell emission credits generated as a result of reductions
that are above and beyond current requirements. California State
Assembly Bill 1777 also proposes to direct the California Air
Resource Board to develop methodologies to determine how facilities
can trade emissions between different markets. AB1777 is expected
to be signed by the Governor.
<P>
The Inter-credit Trading Study will examine the inter-temporal,
inter-source and inter-pollutant issues. The inter-temporal issue
looks at when a credit is generated and when it is used. Staff
is currently studying the seasonal and multi-year aspects to determine
if this will affect the attainment strategies in the AQMP. The
inter-source issue focuses on the type of source from which an
emission is generated. The inter-pollutant issue will analyze
trading between pollutants, such as NO and VOCs. Staff will also
explore the issue of inter-trading, to determine if there is a
common fungible emission credit that can be applied in either
the mobile source or stationary source markets.
<P>
Staff is scheduled to give a status report to the Board in October
1995. Staff will be requesting public comment during October and
November. An action plan will be submitted to the Board in December.
Staff stated that business representatives have been asked to
comment on various components of the study as they are developed.
<P>
<B>3. <U>Implementation Status of the 1994 AQMP</U></B> 
<P>
Staff gave a status report on the implementation of the 1994 AQMP.
Staff presented charts depicting the emissions reductions expected
to be achieved in 2010 based on the adoption of rules according
to the AQMP schedule. Actions taken during 1994-95 do not meet
the AQMP emissions reduction target since a number of rulemakings
have been delayed. Staff explained that the majority of the shortfall
was the result of delaying VOC RECLAIM and the restaurant rule.
Dr. Lents pointed out that simply because the current year status
is behind, does not necessarily mean the Basin won't ultimately
achieve attainment; since the projections are for 2010, and that
any rules which are only slightly delayed will not affect the
attainment demonstration.
<P>
Staff informed the Committee that EPA has given the AQMD until
February 1997 to adopt the BACM measures contained in the AQMP.
Since the AQMD is developing a PM10 SIP in 1996, the submittal
of such measures prior to development and adoption of the SIP
is premature. Therefore, EPA has granted time to allow the AQMD
to develop and adopt the control measures contained in the 1996
PM10 SIP into regulatory form.

August 24, 1995, Meeting
<P>
In the absence of Board Member Leonard Paulitz, I attended the
August 24, 1995, MSRC meeting as his alternate.
<P>
<B>I. Summary of Key Agenda Items</B> 
<P>
<U><B>Fiscal Year 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program</B></U>

<P>
The August 3 Bidders' Conference and series of technical workshops
conducted on August 16 and 18 were well attended, with approximately
150 potential proposers at the Conference and approximately 40
attendees at each of the technical workshops. In addition, on
August 25 a Request for Proposals amendment, along with answers
to proposer requests for clarification, were mailed to approximately
450 potential bidders.
<P>
In preparation for the evaluation process, the MSRC's Technical
Advisory Committee formed five evaluation subcommittees to consider
the proposals which will be received by 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday,
September 19, for the three Alternative Fuels RFPs, the three
specialized RFPs, and the Electric Vehicle &quot;Quick Charge&quot;
Program Outreach Coordinator RFP. (The remaining two components
of the EV &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Program have closing dates
in 1996.) Attached for your information is the membership roster
for these evaluation subcommittees <I>(Attachment 1).</I> The
current schedule for the evaluation and adoption process is as
follows:
<P>
Proposal Evaluation September 20 thru October 13
<P>
Special MSRC-TAC Meeting to
<P>
Adopt Draft Work Program October 26; 8:30 am; CC8
<P>
MSRC Meeting to Receive Draft
<P>
Recommendations November 9; 1:30 pm; Aud.
<P>
MSRC Meeting to Adopt Final
<P>
FY 1995-97 Work Program November 16; 1:30 pm; Aud.
<P>
District Board Consideration of
<P>
Final FY 1995-97 Work Program December 8; 9:30 am; Aud.
<P>
Next month Leonard Paulitz will appraise you of the response to
the RFPs and the continuing evaluation process.
<P>
<U><B>Past Sucessful AB 2766 Projects to be Placed into Internet</B></U>

<P>
Last year the MSRC contracted with Acurex Environmental to perform
a project evaluation effort to develop emissions calculation methodologies
and identify successful past projects. This project evaluation
effort should be completed shortly. Consequently, the MSRC directed
its Technical Advisory Committee to explore contracting with a
vendor to have these success projects placed into Internet as
an educational tool. A Subcommittee of the TAC is exploring the
concept and anticipates that the effort can be achieved for less
than $2,500. Further details on this educational tool will be
provided to you as they develop.
<P>
<U><B>Reimbursement of AB 2766 Discretionary Program Expenditures
for Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 1994-95</B></U> 
<P>
The MSRC agreed to reimburse hard costs (i.e., printing, postage,
etc.) to the District in an amount not to exceed $6,058.09 for
expenses incurred in the last quarter of FY 1994-95.
<P>
In June 1995, along with $380,708 in projected staff costs, the
MSRC already approved reimbursement of such costs for FY 1995-96
to an amount not to exceed $31,500. Consequently, staff will be
providing quarterly reports on actual expenditures in FY 1995-96
merely for the MSRC's receipt and information.
<P>
<U><B>Contract Modification Requests</B></U> 
<P>
As recommended by its Technical Advisory Committee, the MSRC approved
the following four contract modifications:
<P>
1) For the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts Contract #C94013,
a scope reduction to discontinue installation of a MARK II engine
conversion upgrade in a second water truck given that the technology
will soon be obsolete and replaced by the Mark III technology,
with a return of $40,310 in AB 2766 funds;
<P>
2) For the Clean Air Partners Contract #C94042, a three-month
contractual term extension to convert UPS delivery trucks to natural
gas;
<P>
3) For the City of Lakewood Contract #C94026, a one-year contractual
term extension to establish a teleconferencing network; and
<P>
4) For Omnitrans Contract #C95014, a scope modification to downgrade
the type of coach for five of the 21 CNG buses being purchased.
<P>
The MSRC also <U>denied</U> two requests, as follows:
<P>
1) For Acurex Environmental Contract #C94003, which was to perform
an LNG heavy-duty truck demonstration project, denial of a three
and one-half month contractual term extension and reallocation
of funds which would have resulted in higher labor costs. Instead,
the MSRC approved a one-month extension from the current contract
end date of September 5, 1995, and requested that staff develop
a policy which would address the transfer of costs from one category
to another. The MSRC will consider Acurex's request along with
the proposed policy at its next meeting; and
<P>
2) For the Port of Long Beach Contract #C94029, denial to use
residual contract monies to restore alternative-fuel cargo handling
equipment back to diesel power given that the methanol fuel additive
Avocet will no longer be available in the near future. The MSRC
believes that AB 2766 funding should not be spent on an effort
which would achieve a worsening of mobile source emissions. However,
in consideration of the contractor's difficulties, the MSRC approved
a one-month contractual term extension to allow the Port additional
time to develop an alternative suggestion.
<P>
The MSRC also received and filed a report on &quot;Scope Changes
Handled Administratively by the AQMD Contract Administrator&quot;
which included one short-term, no-cost contractual term extension
on Sunline Transit Agency Contract #C94034.
<P>
The MSRC also approved additional time for contracts to be executed
with the City of Los Angeles/Department of Transportation for
its Alternative Fuels Bus Project #3-8 and the City of Burbank
for its Rail Feeder Project #4-12. These are the last of the FY
1994-95 proposals to be brought under contract.

Management District Board
<H3><CENTER> Public Hearing to Adopt Proposed Rule 310 Amnesty
for Unpermitted Equipment <FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
This proposed Rule will implement Point X of the Business Clean
Air Partnership Action Plan, which seeks to establish a level
playing field for all businesses by encouraging companies operating
without required air quality permits to become legal. As an incentive
for these companies to comply, the rule would establish a one-time,
6-month amnesty period during which facilities that voluntarily
apply for permits for existing equipment would not be subject
to any late fees, civil or criminal penalties for having violated
the requirement to have a permit.
<P>
The amnesty shall extend to violations of AQMD permitting rules
(Rule 201 - Permit to Construct, and Rule 203 - Permit to Operate).
All other AQMD, federal, and state permitting rules and regulations
will still apply.
<P>
The amnesty is primarily intended for small to medium-sized businesses,
rather than major sources which are more likely to be aware of
the permitting requirements. Therefore, the amnesty would apply
to any facility that emits less than 10 tons/year of any criteria
pollutant.
<P>
The amnesty would not apply to violations discovered by District
inspectors during inspections initiated by the District. There
is no intent to reduce the AQMD's inspection and compliance efforts
during the amnesty period.
<P>
AQMD staff has reviewed proposed Rule 310 and has determined that
it is exempt from the requirements of the California Environmental
Quality Act pursuant to the State CEQA Guidelines Section 15061
(b)(3), in that staff has determined with certainty that there
is no possibility that proposed Rule 310 may have a significant
<P>
SCAQMD Board -2- September 8, 1995
<P>
effect on the environment. In addition, CEQA Guidelines Section
15321 is applicable in that the purpose of proposed Rule 310 is
to assist the District in enforcing its requirements that sources
be permitted by the District.
<P>
Proposed Rule 310 may result in savings to affected facilities
from not having to pay penalties or late permit processing fees.
The proposed rule is not expected to result in any additional
costs to facilities participating in the amnesty program and is
not expected to have any adverse socioeconomic impacts.
<P>
On October 14, 1994, the Governing Board adopted a resolution
that requires staff to address whether proposed rules being considered
for adoption are being presented in rank order by cost-effectiveness
as defined in the 1994 AQMP. Proposed Rule 310 is not a control
measure in the 1994 AQMP. Therefore, no cost-effectiveness value
was developed for this proposed rule.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Adopt Rule 310 -- Amnesty for Unpermitted Equipment.
<P>
Respectfully,
<P>

<H3><CENTER>BACT Methodology Report:</H3>

<H3>Recommendations on Policy Issues to Implement BACT <FONT SIZE=5>
</H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
<U>INTRODUCTION</U> 
<P>
In non-attainment areas, such as the Los Angeles Basin, both federal
and state law require a New Source Review (NSR) program that mandates
lowest achievable emission rates (LAER) for new and modified sources
of emissions. In California, LAER has been redefined as Best Available
Control Technology (BACT). BACT has been a requirement of the
South Coast Air Quality Management District since October 1976
- first with Rule 213, Standards for Permits to Construct: Air
Quality Impact; and now with Regulation XIII, New Source Review;
and Rule 2005, New Source Review for RECLAIM.
<P>
In March 1994, the Board initiated a program to update and revise
the BACT Guideline. The purpose of the update was to: meet federal,
state, and local requirements for non-attainment and toxic air
contaminants; establish criteria for the update of all BACT standards;
and provide for public review and comment. A Scientific Review
Committee (SRC) was created to assist staff with the policy issues
used to develop and implement BACT.
<P>
In establishing the new BACT Guidelines, two separate parts have
been created. The first part is the BACT Methodology Report which
details discussions of and recommendations on the BACT policy.
The Report also contains a detailed users guide, Part A of the
Report. The second part will be the actual listing of BACT Equipment
and Emission Standards for commonly permitted equipment based
on the policies recommended in the Report.
<P>
<U>SCIENTIFIC REVIEW COMMITTEE</U> 
<P>
Recognizing the need to not only update the guidelines, but to
create a more certain and predictable process, staff began discussions
with the SRC in July 1994 on the policy issues of BACT through
a series of open, noticed meetings. The SRC is composed of 19
public and private members (see attachment for the membership
of the SRC). The members have contributed greatly in giving of
their time and knowledge to the development of the BACT Methodology
Report and as such it is proposed to make them a standing committee
to review matters dealing with BACT. With the SRC, staff held
a public workshop on the BACT Methodology Report in June 1995.
<P>
<U>KEY RECOMMENDATIONS</U> 
<P>
BACT Methodology Report
<UL>
<LI>New Criteria<BR>
- Marginal cost effectiveness will be used to look at the cost
of new<BR>
technology<BR>
- Small business will get special and expanded criteria<BR>
- BACT will be simplified and strengthened to minimize case-by-case
review<BR>
- &quot;Off-Ramps&quot; have been designed into the process to
address unique project <BR>
characteristics<BR>
- Alternate Basic Equipment (ABE) will no longer be used as BACT
<BR>

<LI>Public Process<BR>
- Public will be notified prior to updating of BACT<BR>
- SRC will review BACT recommendations prior to update<BR>

<LI>Incentives<BR>
- Emission Reduction Certificates for equipment going beyond BACT
<BR>
- BACT manufacturer designation<BR>

<LI>User's Guide<BR>
- Provides a easily followed road map to navigate through BACT
<BR>

</UL>

<P>
BACT Equipment and Emission Standards
<UL>
<LI>BACT Determinations<BR>
- Provides listing of commonly used equipment with BACT emission
limits or<BR>
equipment that will comply with BACT requirements<BR>
- Listings separated into three easily read categories for BACT,
Small<BR>
Business BACT, and a reference table for BARCT and T-BACT
</UL>

<P>
<U>FUTURE WORK</U> 
<P>
Using the policy issues to define the framework of the guideline,
the Executive Officer will update the BACT requirement for commonly
permitted equipment. In continuing with the open and public process
staff has used for the methodology report, the individual BACT
requirements will be reviewed with the SRC and through a public
meeting before the Executive Officer reports back to this Board.
After that meeting, Executive Officer will publish the new BACT
Guideline, which will apply prospectively to applications received
by the AQMD.
<P>
The entire process is shown schematically below.
<P>
Approval of the affected methodology is exempt from the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Public Resources Code Section
21000 et seq.) pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15308 -- Class
8 -- Actions by Regulatory Agencies for Protection of the Environment.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Receive and file the report; and
<P>
--Establish the Scientific Review Committee as a standing committee
to consider future BACT issues, and
<P>
--Direct the Executive Officer to update the BACT Guideline consistent
with the report recommendations.

<P>
Management District Board
<H3><CENTER> Public Hearing to Amend Rule 1136 - Wood Products
Coatings <FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
<U>BACKGROUND</U> 
<P>
At the August 11, 1995 Board meeting, staff proposed a set hearing
package for amend-ments to Rule 1136. The purpose of the amendments
was to (1) make corrections identified by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA); (2) clarify rule language; (3) add
a provision for VOC emission averaging; and (4) extend the final
compliance limits for Architectural Millwork Goods. The USEPA
corrections were published in the Federal Register as a Notice
of Final Rulemaking, which finalized their limited disapproval
of this rule. The corrections must be accomplished by November
16, 1995, to avoid federal sanctions which include withholding
federal highway funds, or a 2:1 offset ratio for new and modified
sources.
<P>
Of the four purposes identified above, the first two are technical
corrections and clarifi-cations which will not change the substance
of the rule. Averaging was included at the request of industry
to potentially allow the use of hybrid (waterbased and solvent)
systems. USEPA model rule language was used for this provision.
Staff also proposed an extension for Architectural Millwork Goods
to provide for additional time to develop a permanent solution
for this industry.
<P>
At the August Board meeting, 14 industry representatives testified
on Rule 1136. The testimony focused on five specific points -
(1) extension of the final compliance dates until July 1, 1996;
(2) include an averaging proposal without discounting; (3) &quot;dovetail&quot;
Rule 1136 with RECLAIM; (4) include acetone as an exempt solvent;
and (5) provide incentives for companies that switch early to
compliant coatings. Based on that testimony, the Board directed
staff to include these points as part of the rule package.
<P>
<U>PROPOSAL</U> 
<P>
This package presented to the Board for approval includes the
original (August 11, 1995) proposed amendments to Rule 1136 and
additional language that addresses the 5 points raised by industry
at the August 11, 1995 Board hearing. The five additional amend-ments
are summarized as follows:
<P>
(1) By extending the final compliance dates until July 1, 1996,
companies can continue to use solvent based clear topcoats, pigmented
coatings, and sealers. However, some companies have already converted
to waterbased coatings or have expended significant capital investment
to install control equipment which will meet the final compliance
limits in Rule 1136. Based on this, staff has included draft language
which would extend the final compliance limits for consideration.
<P>
(2) To provide incentives for companies that make an early conversion
to clean coatings, the resolution directs staff to bring a proposal
back to the Board for reduced fees. Also, rule language will allow
these sources to keep records up to a quarterly basis. Another
benefit being proposed for companies that can use coatings with
a VOC content lower than the July 1, 1996 limits is allowing spray
equipment other than HVLP guns provided there are equivalent emissions.
These incentives would be in addition to the other benefits that
accrue to companies converting to waterbased coatings, such as
lower fire insurance premiums, and reduced hazardous waste fees.
Staff has committed to meet with this industry to identify further
incentives which may be available.
<P>
(3) Language proposing averaging without a discount has been prepared.
Preliminary discussions with USEPA indicate that the rule will
be disapproved absent a 10% discount which is needed to ensure
equivalency between averaging and an individually compliant approach.
Should the final compliance dates be extended, there would not
be an immediate need for this averaging as solvent based coatings
can be used.
<P>
(4) VOC RECLAIM is currently scheduled for a public hearing in
March 1996. This date is well in advance of the proposed extension
of the final compliance limits for Rule 1136 and would provide
for a bridge between Rule 1136 RECLAIM facilities and implementation
of the VOC RECLAIM program. With this timing, no further action
is recommended in Rule 1136 for VOC RECLAIM.
<P>
(5) Rule 102 - Definitions is on the Board calendar for November
1995. The proposed amendments to Rule 102 include incorporating
acetone as an exempt solvent. As with the averaging provision,
the use of acetone would only be required for coatings that are
needed to meet the final compliance limits. It is not anticipated
that acetone would be widely used as a coatings solvent prior
to July 1, 1996.
<P>
Additionally, the original staff proposal recommended that the
USEPA required corrections be adopted which will add test methods
for capture efficiency of control systems and transfer efficiency
of spray equipment; and will incorporate the USEPA method to calculate
equivalent efficiencies of control systems. The other proposed
amendments contained in the August 11, 1995, proposal clarify
language relating to rule applicability, definitions, and exemptions.
In addition, the proposal contains the most current analytical
test methods. In practice, these methods and definitions are currently
in use. The specific amendments are described in detail in the
attached staff report.
<P>
<U>ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS</U> 
<P>
Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), staff
has reviewed the proposed amendments to Rule 1136 and determined
that there may be potential adverse impacts associated with some
provisions of the proposed project. Any potential impacts from
the project; however, have previously been analyzed in the Final
Environmental Assessment for Rule 108 - Alternative Emission Control
Plans and the Final Supplemental Environmental Assessment for
Rule 1136 - Wood Products Coatings. Therefore, pursuant to state
CEQA Guidelines Section 15153, the SCAQMD is relying on these
previously prepared environmental assessments as the CEQA analysis
for the currently proposed project. A Notice of Intent to Rely
on a Previously Prepared Environmental Assessment was circulated
for public review and comment from July 31, 1995, through August
29, 1995 and no comments were received.
<P>
Since the Set Hearing package, staff has revised its proposal
and made several modifications to the project. State CEQA Guidelines
Section 15164 require a lead agency to prepare an addendum to
an EA if some changes or additions are necessary but none of the
conditions for a Subsequent EA have occurred. Staff has prepared
an Addendum for the proposed amendments to Rule 1136 which is
incorporated herein. In addition, staff has prepared a Statement
of Findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations for the
proposed project which is incorporated herein as an attachment
to the Governing Board Resolution.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Amend Rule 1136 - Wood Products Coatings, as set forth in the
attached documents.
<P>
--Certify the previously prepared CEQA documents and Addendum
being used as the CEQA documentation for Proposed Amended Rule
1136.

<H3><CENTER> Public Hearing to Amend Rule 461 - Gasoline Transfer
and Dispensing <FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
<U>INTRODUCTION</U> 
<P>
Rule 461 - Gasoline Transfer and Dispensing was originally adopted
on January 9, 1976 and subsequently amended a number of times
with the latest amendment on July 7, 1989. This rule requires
the use of Phase I and Phase II vapor recovery systems that are
certified by California Air Resources Board (CARB) to reduce 95%
of the VOC emissions from both the filling of storage tanks and
fueling of motor vehicles at gasoline transfer and dispensing
facilities.
<P>
There are approximately 7,400 gasoline transfer and dispensing
facilities (4,100 retail and 3,300 non-retail) in the AQMD. These
gasoline transfer and dispensing facilities are characterized
by numerous dispenser and vapor recovery configurations. CARB
has issued seventy-five (75) Executive Orders, including forty-two
(42) configurations for Phase I vapor recovery systems and thirty-three
(33) configurations for Phase II vapor recovery systems.
<P>
Due to the tremendous number of gasoline transfer and dispensing
facilities located in the AQMD, Rule 461 is one of the most significant
control strategies for VOC emissions. It is imperative that Phase
I and Phase II vapor recovery systems are properly constructed
and operated so that the necessary control efficiency can be maintained.
In order to further enhance the effectiveness of the Phase I and
Phase II vapor recovery systems and therefore reduce the VOC emissions
from gasoline transfer and dispensing operations, staff has incorporated
new procedures and technologies into the Proposed Amended Rule
461. The proposed amendments include a self-compliance program
and a number of new rule measures. A further VOC emission reduction
of 3.43 tons per day is expected from these proposed amendments.
<P>
The self-compliance program includes the requirements of daily
maintenance inspections conducted by facility managers and periodic
compliance inspections conducted by certified auditors. Currently,
self-inspection and auditing programs are in place at both major
and independent oil companies. Staff intends to establish a uniform
structure and parameters for these existing programs. In order
to simplify the process and minimize the impacts on the owners/operators
of all retail gasoline transfer and dispensing facilities, this
proposed self-compliance program is primarily based on the standard
practices required by most of the oil companies.
<P>
The new rule measures originated from the control measures identified
in the Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) (rescinded by President
Clinton on April 10, 1995), State Implementation Plan (SIP) and
Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) as well as the recommendations
from the public and staff. These measures reflect the advancement
of Phase I and Phase II vapor recovery technologies. Staff includes
future compliance dates in the proposed amendment to provide the
existing facilities with sufficient time to phase out the old
equipment.
<P>
Staff has been working with the oil companies, industry associations,
and other governmental agencies to address all issues and concerns
regarding the self-compliance program and new rule measures. Both
major and independent oil companies have participated in a self-compliance
pilot program with a small number of selected facilities since
July 1995. By inspecting the selected facilities and documenting
where corrective measures are needed, staff will be able to identify
and resolve potential problems associated with the implementation
of self-compliance program and thereby enhance the effectiveness
of the full-scale program.
<P>
<U>CONCLUSIONS</U> 
<P>
The AQMD has prepared the appropriate California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) document consisting of an Environmental Assessment
(EA) that does not identify any significant adverse environmental
impacts resulting from the proposed amendments. This document
was prepared pursuant to the AQMD's Certified Regulatory Program
(Rule 110) and State CEQA Guidelines Section 15252. The EA analyzes
each environmental topic, and includes supporting information
for determining that the proposed amendments would not create
any significant adverse environmental impacts. The Draft EA was
circulated for a 30-day public review and comment period which
ended July 17, 1995. There were no public comments received on
the Draft EA. The final EA is attached in this rule package.
<P>
As per the Notice of Public Hearing, written comments were accepted
through August 29, 1995. All written comments received by that
date were reviewed and responded to by staff in the Final Public
Hearing Package for the rule amendment.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Certify the Environmental Assessment for the proposed amendments
to Rule 461 - Gasoline Transfer and Dispensing in accordance with
the attached resolution.
<P>
--Amend Rule 461 - Gasoline Transfer and Dispensing as proposed
in accordance with the attached resolution.

<H3><CENTER> Public Hearing to Adopt Proposed Rules 1612 - Credits
for Clean On-Road Vehicles and 1620 - Credits for Clean Off-Road
Mobile Equipment <FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
Proposed Rules 1612 and 1620 will provide greater opportunities
to generate mobile source emission reduction credits (MSERC) that
could be used as an alternative means of compliance with AQMD
regulations. The administrative procedures are similar between
the two proposed rules. Proposed Rule 1612 applies to on-road
motor vehicles and 1620 applies to off-road mobile equipment.
The proposed rules will meet the 1994 Air Quality Management Plan
commitment for control measures MON-05, MON-06, and MOF-04.
<P>
Under the provisions of Proposed Rules 1612 and 1620, on-road
motor vehicle operators or off-road mobile equipment operators
can choose the most cost-effective compliance alternatives to
suit their needs. Voluntary implementation through the purchase
of new low- or zero-emission vehicles or off-road equipment, or
retrofitting or repowering of existing heavy-duty vehicles and
off-road equipment, or permanent replacement of existing off-road
mobile equipment with non-polluting alternatives, will result
in MSERCs which can be used to comply with other AQMD regulations
or be traded to other facilities. The MSERC calculation is based
on emission standards established by the California Air Resources
Board (ARB) or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
or through alternative engine testing which follows ARB certification
test procedures (subject to AQMD and ARB approval). Operators
will participate in these programs if these alternatives are less
costly to implement than other AQMD regulations. In addition,
the proposed rules provide additional incentives to promote advanced-technology
vehicles and equipment by providing credits for these technologies.
On balance, implementation of the proposed rules will result in
increased flexibility and lower cost of compliance.
<P>
Staff has incorporated a number of modifications to the proposed
rule language based on additional comments received following
the release of the original proposal. These modifications include:
<P>
(1) language that would allow the generation of MSERCs for high-mileage
fleet vehicles
<P>
(2) a mechanism for establishing alternative baseline or ceiling
emission standards for off-road mobile equipment
<P>
(3) a mechanism for establishing alternative optional emission
standards for both clean on-road vehicles and off-road mobile
equipment
<P>
(4) allowance of non-polluting alternative replacements for off-road
mobile equipment
<P>
(5) a two year credit life to allow greater ability to trade MSERCs
<P>
(6) a mechanism for generating MSERCs for SOx and PM (in addition
to VOC, NOx and CO)
<P>
(7) issuance of credits for the operation of clean on-road vehicles
and off-road mobile equipment purchased prior to the adoption
of the proposed rules, and
<P>
(8) further streamlining of reporting requirements.
<P>
A significant number of comments have been addressed in the proposed
rule language. However, several comments (regarding credit banking,
use of a discount factor in inter-source crediting, interpollutant
trading, and retroactive crediting - the issuance of credits for
prior years of operation of clean vehicles or off-road mobile
equipment purchased prior to the adoption of the proposed rules)
are under evaluation as part of a study directed by the Board
as part of the adoption of Rule 1501.1 - Alternatives to Work
Trip Reduction Plans. The findings of this study will be available
in the fall of this year. Based on the findings, staff may propose
further amendments to Proposed Rules 1612 and 1620 as necessary.
<P>
Pursuant to the AQMD's Certified Regulatory Program (Rule 110),
the AQMD has prepared appropriate California Environmental Quality
Act documentation, consisting of a Final Environmental Assessment
(EA). The analysis in the EA indicates that the implementation
of Proposed Rules 1612 and 1620 would not cause any significant
adverse environmental impacts. The Draft EA has been circulated
for a 30-day public review and comment period which ended August
1, 1995. No comments were received on the Draft EA.
<P>
The attachments to this package contain an outline of the rule
development process (Attachment A), summary of issues and staff
response on Proposed Rules 1612 and 1620 (Attachment B), Governing
Board Resolution (Attachment C), Proposed Rules 1612 and 1620
along with a final staff report for each rule (Attachments D and
E), Final EA (Attachment F), and the Final Socioeconomic Analysis
(Attachment G).
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Certify the Final Environmental Assessment for Proposed Rule
1612 - Credits for Clean On-Road Motor Vehicles and Proposed Rule
1620 - Credits for Clean Off-Road Mobile Equipment, as proposed,
in accordance with the attached Resolution.

Management District Board
<H3><CENTER> Public Hearing to Amend RECLAIM Rules 2011 - Requirements
for Monitoring, Reporting, and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur
(SOx) Emissions<BR>
2012 - Requirements for Monitoring, Reporting, and Recordkeeping
for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) Emissions <FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
The proposed amendments to Rules 2011 and 2012 include three major
elements addressing the monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping
requirements of the RECLAIM program. One element is the concept
of Super Compliant status, which allows facilities with major
sources to reclassify them as large NOx sources or SOx process
units if they operate below their adjusted 2003 allocation. This
reduces monitoring costs for these facilities while yielding a
clean air benefit for the basin due to early emission reductions.
A second element is the expansion of the acceptable valid data
range to 10 to 95 percent of the full scale span for continuous
emissions monitoring systems (CEMS). In conjunction with this,
is the establishment of criteria which allow CEMS to measure below
10 percent of full scale. This will allow for the measurement
of low level emissions without invoking the Missing Data Procedures
which could quickly deplete a facility's Allocation. The third
element is the continuance of the use of interim emission calculation
methodology in lieu of using the Missing Data Procedures for major
sources that cannot certify CEMS under specific conditions.
<P>
Specifically, the proposed amendments will:
<P>
1. SUPER COMPLIANCE
<P>
Provide for the reclassification of a major NOx source to a large
NOx source or a major SOx source to a SOx process unit, if a facility
can be deemed Super Compliant.
<P>
The term Super Compliant denotes a facility with existing current
emissions that are below their 2003 allocation as adjusted by
the addition of ERCs converted to RTCs in accordance with the
proposed amendments or a facility which can reduce its current
emissions by the installation of air pollution control equipment
to below its adjusted 2003 allocation. There are a few RECLAIM
facilities which are already operating with emission levels at
or below their adjusted compliance year 2003 Allocations. Additional
facilities may be able to reduce emissions to the level of their
adjusted compliance year 2003 Allocations in the short term by
installing control equipment. Therefore, staff proposes to amend
Rules 2011 and 2012 so as to establish a methodology whereby the
operators of such facilities can have their major SOx sources
reclassified as SOx process units or their major NOx sources reclassified
as large NOx sources, as appropriate.
<P>
2. CEMS SPAN RANGE
<P>
Expand the acceptable valid data range of a CEMS from 20 to 95
percent of the full scale span (FSS) range to 10 to 95 percent
of the FSS range. This will also apply to O2 analyzers.
<P>
Currently, RECLAIM Rules 2011, Appendix A (SOx Protocol) and 2012,
Appendix A (NOx Protocol) require the use of missing data procedures
anytime a CEMS is reading concentrations below 20 percent of FSS
range. For example, if a CEMS has a certified span range of 0
to 100 parts per million (ppm), anytime the CEMS is reading concentrations
below 20 ppm, missing data procedures would be invoked.
<P>
Since the RECLAIM program focuses on the measurement and reporting
of actual emissions and the use of missing data procedures does
not necessarily yield the measurement or reporting of actual emissions,
it is imperative that a RECLAIM CEMS can accurately measure emissions
at both low and high concentrations. To accommodate the capturing
of low emissions, staff is recommending to increase the valid
range of acceptable CEMS data to 10 to 95 percent of FSS range.
<P>
Include procedures under which data measured by a CEMS below 10
percent can be reported at the 10 percent FSS value or, if the
CEMS has the &quot;lowest vendor guaranteed&quot; FSS range, can
report actual measured values, rather than resorting to Missing
Data Procedures.
<P>
Staff is proposing to include in the NOx and SOx Protocols criteria
under which the measurement of concentrations that fall below
10 percent of the FSS range can be deemed acceptable, rather than
triggering the Missing Data Procedures. Also, the proposed procedures
address the fact that some CEMS technology has advanced to the
point that it can accurately read low concentrations below 10
percent of lowest vendor guaranteed FSS range and it also provides
a technological incentive to other CEMS manufacturers to improve
their instruments' accuracy at low concentrations.
<P>
In addition, rule language is proposed to modify Attachment C
to both the NOx and SOx Protocols in order to clarify the testing
frequency required for semiannual assessments.
<P>
3. MISSING DATA PROCEDURES
<P>
Amend the Missing Data Procedures to allow facilities with major
sources that cannot certify CEMS using standard equipment to continue
using, under specified conditions, the interim period emissions
calculation methodology up until December 31, 1995 or when the
CEMS is finally certified, whichever is earlier, in lieu of using
the Missing Data Procedures. This calculation procedure would
be retroactive to July 1, 1995.
<P>
Also, amend the Missing Data Procedures to allow facilities with
major sources that cannot certify CEMS because; (1) there is an
inordinate cost burden associated with flow monitoring as specified
under (B)(11); and (2) they cannot apply the Reference Methods
as specified in Rules 2011(h)(1) and 2012 (j)(1) and Appendix
A, to continue using the interim period emissions calculation
methodology up until June 30, 1996 or when the CEMS is finally
certified, whichever is earlier, in lieu of using the Missing
Data Procedures. This calculation procedure would be retroactive
to July 1, 1995.
<P>
Additionally, the proposed amendments clarify some Rule language
and correct typographical errors. Also, staff is recommending
that the relative accuracy requirements for stack gas volumetric
flow measurement systems be changed from 10 percent to 15 percent
to be consistent with the United States Environmental Protection
Agency's Acid Rain Program (40CFR, Part 75) relative accuracy
requirements.
<P>
At the August 11, 1995 Set Hearing, a comment was made that facilities
which had not certified their CEMS by July 1, 1995 because they
were awaiting the outcome of these amendments, should be allowed
to continue to use the interim period emissions calculation methodology
to report mass emissions instead of using the Missing Data Procedures.
The proposed rule amendments cover two main topics: Super Compliant
facilities and low concentration CEMS. Both proposed amendments
provide for the retroactive correction of missing data using the
interim period emission monitoring methodology, actual emission
data, or data at ten percent of full scale span range, depending
on the specific situation. In addition, the proposed amendments
include language allowing for the retroactive use of the interim
period emission calculation procedures for facilities which can
not certify because further development is needed in CEMS technology
(e.g. special probes) or there is an inordinate cost burden associated
with stack flow monitoring that prevents certification.
<P>
AQMD staff has reviewed the proposed amendments to Rules 2011
and 2012 and determined with certainty that the amendments have
no potential to adversely impact the environment and are thus
exempt from the requirements of the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA). The amendments pertain to the overall administrative
structure of the program. The amendments do not introduce any
new control technology not previously analyzed nor do they create
any additional emissions from the alteration in reporting requirements.
The amendments are exempt pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines Sections
15002(k) and 15061(b)(3) [SCAQMD CEQA Guidelines Sections 1.2(k)
and 5.1(b)(3)]. As such, a Notice of Exemption has been prepared
and will be filed with the county clerks for Orange, Riverside,
Los Angeles, and San Bernardino counties immediately following
the adoption of the proposed amendments.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
-- Certify the Notice of Exemption for the Final Environmental
Assessment for Regulation XX in accordance with the attached resolution.
<P>
-- Amend RECLAIM Rules 2011 - Requirements for Monitoring, Reporting,
and Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur (SOx) Emissions and 2012
- Requirements for Monitoring, Reporting, and Recordkeeping for
Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) Emissions, as set forth in the attached.

Management District Board
<H3><CENTER> Amend Rule 1130 - Graphic Arts <FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
<U>INTRODUCTION</U> 
<P>
Rule 1130 - Graphic Arts regulates volatile organic compounds
(VOC) from graphic arts operations which include lithographic,
flexographic, letterpress, and gravure printing processes and
related coating and laminating processes. Rule 1130 was first
adopted on October 3, 1980 and was last amended on July 9, 1993.
<P>
On April 13, 1994, the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA) partially approved and partially disapproved the
March 6, 1992, version of the rule. The March 6, 1992, version
was partially approved because it was considered a substantial
improvement over the rule currently approved under the State Implementation
Plan. However, the rule was also partially disapproved because
(1) the current VOC limits for flexographic metallic and matte
finish inks exceed the limits specified in the USEPA's &quot;Control
Technique Guideline (CTG)&quot; for this industry, and (2) the
overall control device efficiency for publication gravure is lower
than the efficiency required under the CTG.
<P>
If an amended version of Rule 1130 is not submitted to and approved
by the USEPA by November 12, 1995, the USEPA may impose mandatory
actions beginning with a 2:1 offset requirement for new or modified
facilities. These actions may result in financial hardships to
the regulated community. This rule amendment is proposed to incorporate
all the corrections required by the USEPA to approve the rule
and some other changes suggested by the industry, the AQMD staff,
and the USEPA.
<P>
The other amendments proposed by USEPA, AQMD staff and the industry
are: 1) addition of a rule &quot;Purpose and Applicability&quot;
section, 2) deletion of the exempt compound list and addition
of a reference to Rule 102 - Definition of Terms which includes
an exempt compound list, 3) lowering the minimum metal content
requirement in flexographic metallic inks from 35% to 28% by weight,
4) lowering the VOC limit for flexographic metallic ink from 485
grams per liter (gm/liter) to 460 gm/liter, 5) addition of an
equivalency equation for determining the required overall efficiency
of a control device when one is used in conjunction with non-compliant
graphic arts materials, 6) elimination of the 500 gm/liter maximum
VOC limit for non-compliant graphic arts materials used in conjunction
with emission control systems, 7) elimination of the use of emission
control systems and alternative emission control systems for exempt
flexographic metallic and matte finish inks, 8) addition of a
prohibition of sale and specification provision, 9) addition of
a Rule 442 (Usage of Solvents) applicability statement, 10) addition
of a maximum 300 gm/liter VOC limit for emission reduction credit
calculations for flexographic matte finish and metallic inks,
11) revision of test methods and language clarification, 12) addition
of an exemption from prohibition of sale and specification provision,
and 13) addition of a limitation of total facility-wide potential
VOC emissions to ten tons per year for facilities using the flexographic
metallic and matte finish ink exemption.
<P>
The proposed amendments will have no significant impact on emission
limitations or air quality. In addition, no adverse socioeconomic
impacts are expected for the majority of facilities currently
regulated by Rule 1130. It is possible that up to fifty facilities
that operate emission control devices could incur significant
additional costs due to additional testing requirements specified
by USEPA. Staff will work with these facilities to try to minimize
these additional costs.
<P>
<U>CONCLUSIONS</U> 
<P>
AQMD staff has concluded with certainty that the proposed amendments
will not have a significant adverse impact on the environment
because the amendments are not expected to change emissions, emission
reductions, the type or number of control equipment, or the number
of end-users regulated by the rule. Therefore, Proposed Amended
Rule 1130 is exempt from the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA) pursuant to state CEQA Guidelines Section - 15002 (k)(1).
The proposed amendments are also exempt from CEQA pursuant to
state CEQA Guidelines Section 15061 (b)(3) - Review for Exemption,
and state CEQA Guidelines Section 15308 - Class 8 - Actions by
Regulatory Agencies for the Protection of the Environment. The
Notice of Exemption will be filed with the county clerks immediately
following the adoption of the proposed amendments.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Certify the Notice of Exemption for Proposed Amended Rule 1130,
as proposed, in accordance with the attached Resolution; and
<P>
--Amend Rule 1130 - Graphic Arts, as revised and proposed in accordance
with the attached Resolution.

of CO MSERCs to be consistent with Rule 1501.1. In addition, amendments
to definitions and increased flexibility in the use of Rule 1610

<I>Proposed amendments have been developed to improve consistency
between Rule 1610 and other recently-adopted AQMD regulations.
Specifically, the proposed amendments will extend the life of
Rule 1610 MSERCs from 3 to 5 years and allow for the generation
of CO MSERCs to be consistent with Rule 1501.1. In addition, amendments
to definitions and increased flexibility in the use of Rule 1610
MSERCs are proposed.</I> 
<P>
60E <B>Amend Rule 301 - Permit Fees</B> (Leyden) (909) 396-3120
<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:pleyden@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
( pleyden@aqmd.gov )
<P>
<I>The proposed amendments provide for a waiver of permitting
and annual operating fees for businesses creating high employment
and low levels of emissions. &quot;Super-clean&quot; businesses
that create more than 500 jobs, while producing half the emissions
per employee identified in the 1994 AQMP for the Year 2010 goal
for that industry, will be eligible for the fee waiver for two
years.</I> 
<H3>November 17, 1995: </H3>

<P>
-- <B>Amend Rule 1134 - Emission of Oxides of Nitrogen from Stationary
Gas Turbines</B> (Lockie) (909) 396-2390<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:llockie@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
(llockie@aqmd.gov )
<P>
<I>The proposed amendment to Rule 1134 will address SIP recommendations
identified by the U.S. EPA and will give two gas-fired turbines
owned and operated by The Gas Company in the SEDAB an extension
of time to allow developing dry low-NOx turbine technology to
become field ready to meet the rule's requirements. This amendment
would delay NOx emission reductions in the SEDAB. In addition,
the amendment includes minor modifications for administrative
purposes.</I> 
<P>
-- <B>Amend Regulation XIII - New Source Review and Rule 212 -
Standards for Approving Permits</B> (Leyden) (909) 396-3120<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:pleyden@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
( pleyden@aqmd.gov )
<P>
<I>The proposed amendments to Regulation XIII will address state
and federal NSR regulatory requirements. This proposal will replace
the Community Bank with a four tons per year exemption level;
adjust the Priority Reserve; define the equivalency demonstration
process; narrow exemptions; streamline trading zones; forgive
positive NSR balances for offset purposes; and exempt emission
increases resulting from the transition out of ozone-depleting
compounds. The proposed amendments will also address internal
combustion engines to be consistent with EPA's national requirements.</I>

<P>
-- <B>Amend Rule 2002 - Allocations for Oxides of Nitrogen and
Oxides of Sulfur</B> (Lockie) (909) 396-2390<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:llockie@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
(llockie@aqmd.gov )
<P>
<I>Rule 2015(c)(3) requires the Executive Officer to perform a
technology review for glass furnaces, gray cement kilns, hot-mix
asphalt plants, metal-melting furnaces, and steel slab reheating
furnaces. This review indicates that increases to the year 2000
emission factors for glass furnaces and gray cement kilns are
appropriate. This will result in an increase of approximately
3 - 5 tons per day in the year 2000 allocations. In order to change
RECLAIM NOx allocations for affected facilities, Rule 2002 will
be amended to reflect the revised emission factors. It will also
include any necessary CEQA documents.</I> 
<H3>December 8, 1995: </H3>

<P>
-- <B>Amend Rule 1113 - Architectural Coatings</B> (Fray) (909)
396-3030<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:wfray@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
( wfray@aqmd.gov )
<P>
<I>The proposed amendments will reinstate the February 1990 volatile
organic compound (VOC) limits for certain specific coatings that
were stayed pursuant to a superior court order. A temporary exemption
until June 1, 1997 for coatings sold in quart or smaller containers
will be added.</I> 
<P>
-- <B>Amend Rule 1173 - Fugitive Emissions of Volatile Organic
Compounds</B> (Lockie) (909) 396-2390<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:llockie@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
(llockie@aqmd.gov )
<P>
<I>The proposed amendments will lower component leak thresholds
for minor gas leaks for valves and fittings to 100 ppm; address
any remaining SIP deficiencies identified by the USEPA; incorporate
new definitions and amend some of the existing ones to clarify
rule provisions; revise leak control requirements to enhance rule
implementation; address issues regarding implementation of the
inspection and maintenance provisions of the existing rule; and
delete or revise unenforceable rule provisions.</I> 
<P>
-- <B>Amend Rule 430 - Breakdown Provisions</B> (Lockie)<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:llockie@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
(llockie@aqmd.gov )
<P>
<I>The proposed amendment will change the existing rule by introducing
language eliminating permit condition violations that occur as
a direct result of a valid breakdown. Additionally, administrative
language changes will make the rule consistent with current AQMD
policies, and eliminate vague and ambiguous wording.</I>

<P>
24. Legislative Committee Report and Recommendations
<P>
Mr. Paulitz expressed his belief that it was premature to form
the three-member &quot;Action&quot; subcommittee, and recommended
that the item be discussed further by the Legislative Committee
and then referred to the Administrative Committee for approval.
Based on his conversations with Mr. Paulitz, Legislative Director
Catherine Witherspoon and legal counsel, Dr. Burke agreed that
the item needed additional discussions by Legislative Committee
members.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. PAULITZ, SECONDED BY MS. SOTO, A UNANIMOUS VOTE

<P>
<U><B>PUBLIC HEARINGS</B></U> 
<P>
32. Adopt Proposed Rule 310 - Amnesty for Unpermitted Equipment
<P>
La Ronda Bowen, Public Advisor, presented the staff report. The
public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from
the following individuals:
<P>
MARTIN LEDWITZ, Southern California Edison Company
<P>
<U>MS. DETRICH B. ALLEN, City of Los Angeles </U>
<P>
Commented that over the last several years, due to numerous changes
to Rule 219 and various interpretations, major companies have
found dozens of pieces of equipment that have needed remedial
permitting action--minor emission sources, but located at major
facilities. Requested that, in order to treat everyone fairly,
the amnesty apply to <I>all</I> sources by deleting Subparagraph
(b)(1) of the proposed rule.
<P>
<U>LEE WALLACE, The Gas Company</U> 
<P>
Commented that in discussions earlier with staff, they addressed
The Gas Company's concern that facilities participating in the
amnesty would not be able to benefit from the new BACT guidelines
which would likely be approved near the end of the amnesty period.
<P>
<U>BRIAN WHITAKER, Southern California Alliance of POTWs</U> 
<P>
Supported extending the amnesty to include essential public services
and larger sources. Commented that large-emitting facilities may
have small sources on site that may have been overlooked in the
past. This will allow them the opportunity to work with AQMD staff,
without fear of punitive action, and make sure that all of their
equipment is properly permitted, which will benefit everyone.
<P>
Ms. Bowen responded that major sources of emissions (10 tons/day
or more of any single criteria pollutant) are inspected by AQMD
at least annually--many as frequently as monthly; and therefore
should be well aware of the permitting requirements. Staff believed
that these companies should not be excluded, under the amnesty
program, from having to pay a 15 percent penalty for permitting
equipment which they have not been forthright in revealing to
the AQMD.
<P>
Ms. Haggard and Mr. Hewitt expressed concern about excluding major
facilities from the amnesty program, and felt that it was to AQMD's
advantage (by regulation of the equipment and revenue from operating/renewal
fees) and to the advantage of air quality (by regulation/control
of emissions from the equipment) to allow all facilities this
one-time opportunity to obtain permits for their unpermitted equipment
without being penalized.
<P>
MR. HEWITT MOVED TO ADOPT PROPOSED RULE 310 AS RECOMMENDED, WITH
THE DELETION OF SUBPARAGRAPH (b)(1). THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY
MS. HAGGARD.
<P>
Mr. Mikels raised the question of whether or not, if possible,
a distinction should be made between major facilities with unpermitted
&quot;small-emitting&quot; pieces of equipment versus major facilities
with unpermitted &quot;large-emitting&quot; pieces of equipment.
<P>
Speaking in opposition to the motion, Mr. Paulitz and Dr. Burke
supported staff's recommendation and intent that amnesty be given
to small businesses, because they may not be aware or understand
that the equipment needs to be permitted. Dr. Burke pointed out
that the larger facilities have the resources--engineers and/or
attorneys--to ensure that they understand AQMD rules and regulations.
If they choose not to report equipment or not reveal equipment
to AQMD inspectors, those facilities should not be rewarded with
amnesty.
<P>
Ms. Lee and Ms. Soto indicated their agreement with the comments
by Mr. Paulitz and <BR>
Dr. Burke and their support for small businesses and business
retention.
<P>
Mr. Hewitt added that he believes there are large facilities that
have acted in good faith but may not have had equipment permitted
through errors in judgment or other factors, just as there are
likely small facilities that have knowingly withheld equipment
from being permitted; and vice versa. He felt that the District
might be rewarding the worst actors and penalizing the best by
drawing an antiquated archetype about big business and small business.
<P>
Mr. Mikels indicated that his concern was the large facilities
with unreported large-emitting equipment; and commented that perhaps
the line should be drawn at large- versus small-emitting equipment,
rather than large versus small facility. As an alternative, he
suggested that the Board approving the staff recommendation, continue
the public hearing to October to discuss how to make a distinction,
for facilities above 10 tons, in terms of individual equipment
emissions versus entire facility emissions, and then draw a demarcation
between those that the Board wants to include in amnesty and those
that should not be included.
<P>
THE MOTION BY MR. HEWITT TO ADOPT RULE 310, WITH THE DELETION
OF SUBPARAGRAPH (b)(1), FAILED BY THE FOLLOWING VOTE:
<P>
AYES: Haggard, Hewitt, Silva and Wilson.
<P>
NOES: Burke, Lee, Loveridge, Mikels, Paulitz and Soto.
<P>
ABSENT: Antonovich and Braude.
<P>
MS. LEE MOVED TO: (1) ADOPT RULE 310 AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF;
(2) CONTINUE THE PUBLIC HEARING ON RULE 310 TO THE OCTOBER 13,
1995 BOARD MEETING; AND(3) DIRECT STAFF TO BRING BACK TO THE BOARD
FOR DISCUSSION AT THE OCTOBER BOARD MEETING A PROPOSAL AS TO HOW,
IF POSSIBLE, A DISTINCTION CAN BE MADE BETWEEN TYPES OF EQUIPMENT
THAT HAVE SMALL OR LARGE EMISSIONS, IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT,
IF ANY, SOURCES ABOVE 10 TONS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE AMNESTY
PERIOD. THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. SOTO, AND PASSED BY THE
FOLLOWING VOTE:
<P>
AYES: Burke, Lee, Loveridge, Mikels, Paulitz, Soto and Wilson.
<P>
NOES: Haggard, Hewitt and Silva.
<P>
ABSENT: Antonovich and Braude.
<P>
33. Amend Regulation VII - Emergencies
<P>
Melvin Zeldin, Planning Manager, presented the staff report. The
public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from
the following individuals:
<P>
<U>JULIE HANSEN, American Lung Association</U> 
<P>
Recommended that AQMD continue to take a proactive, aggressive
stance on <BR>
Regulation VII and get the requirements reduced to the health
advisory level to better protect public health.
<P>
<U>BRUCE ROBERTS, City of Los Angeles</U> 
<P>
Commented that the City of Los Angeles and other employers have
trip reduction plans requiring the inclusion of Regulation VII
plans due before the January 1, 1996 effective date of amended
Regulation VII, which would eliminate that requirement. Therefore,
in order to reduce the administrative burden, requested that Amended
Regulation VII become effective immediately upon adoption by the
Board.
<P>
Mr. Zeldin responded that staff recommended an effective date
of January 1, 1996 in order to allow time for outreach to the
schools, which are just coming back into session. Also, the beginning
of the year is a period when air pollution episodes are minimal,
as opposed to this time of the year.
<P>
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P>
ON MOTION OF DR. WILSON, SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ, A UNANIMOUS
VOTE WAS CAST OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Antonovich
and Braude) TO:
<P>
(1) ADOPT RESOLUTION NO. 95-22, AMENDING REGULATION VII: RULE
701 AND RESCINDING RULES 702 THROUGH 715 FROM REGULATION VII,
AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF; AND
<P>
(2) DIRECT STAFF TO NOTIFY THOSE COMPANIES SUBJECT TO THE EPISODE
NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES IN REGULATION VII THAT HAVE REGULATION
VII PLANS DUE BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 8 AND DECEMBER 31, 1995 TO SEND
A WRITTEN REQUEST TO AQMD FOR AN EXTENSION OF THEIR PLAN SUBMITTAL
DATE BEYOND DECEMBER 31, 1995.
<P>
34. Adopt the Recommendations of the Best Available Control Technology
Methodology Report
<P>
Pat Leyden, DEO/Stationary Source Compliance, presented the staff
report; and noted that an Errata Sheet containing minor language
modifications to the User's Guide portion of the BACT Methodology
Report had been distributed to Board members and copies made available
to the public.
<P>
The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from
the following individuals:
<P>
<U>HAROLD DERUS, PAMCO Stewart &amp; Stevenson, Inc.</U> 
<P>
Expressed a desire to work further with staff on developing a
BACT standard for landfill or digester gas fired internal combustion
engines which, because of variations in site conditions and types
of fuel, would probably come under the &quot;off-ramp&quot; procedures.
(Submitted Written Comments.)
<P>
GREG ADAMS, Technical Advisory Committee of the IAIC
<P>
LEE WALLACE, The Gas Company
<P>
JEB STUART, California Aerospace Environmental Association and
Construction Industry <BR>
Air Quality Coalition
<P>
RON WILKNISS, Western States Petroleum Association
<P>
<U>LANCE BROWN, City of Los Angeles </U>
<P>
Recommended, because of the policy considerations involved and
in order to afford the public the opportunity to fully discuss
the ramifications of any change, that any updates to the Methodology
Report, the initial BACT Guideline which the Board will consider
in approximately 9 months--as well as all updates thereto, should
be brought before the Board by staff at least as consent calendar
items.
<P>
Mr. Stuart suggested, as part of any future BACT determination,
that a competitive analysis be conducted on the cost of opening
a facility in the SCAB and the cost for opening the same facility
in another major metropolitan area that does not attain the air
quality standard. <BR>
Mr. Wilkniss suggested, in keeping with the positive philosophies
of RECLAIM and the Business Clean Air Partnership, that AQMD provide
worthwhile incentives to industry to install new control technologies,
as opposed to the AQMD continuing to mandate them.
<P>
RON McELHANY, Quretech
<P>
RITA LOOF and RICK RUPPERT, Radtech
<P>
SALLY RAMSEY, Ecology Coatings
<P>
<U>GORDON JONES, UCB Chemicals </U>
<P>
Requested that ultraviolet/electron beam curable (UV/EB) inks,
adhesives and coatings technology be included in the BACT Guideline
for processes such as flexographic and lithographic printing and
coating on wood, plastics, and metal. Mr. McElhany offered Quretech's
assistance in educating the public on the success of UV/EB technology
in a variety of applications, and encouraged AQMD participation
in demonstrations at facilities in the Southern California region.
<P>
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P>
Ms. Soto indicated her agreement that the BACT Guidelines and
any updates or revisions should be placed on the consent calendar
for Board approval.
<P>
In response to Ms. Haggard, Ms. Leyden commented that staff could
report back to the Board on the issue raised in public testimony
concerning inclusion of UV technology in the new BACT Guideline
when the Guideline is brought before the Board for adoption. However,
the Guideline basically addresses control equipment and does not
set grams-per-liter standards for products such as inks or coatings.
UV is an alternate for products which contain--and emit--VOCs
and for which there are grams-per-liter standards set for VOC
content.
<P>
Ms. Leyden suggested that it might be more appropriate to include
UV technology either under VOC RECLAIM, where it could offer companies
a way to meet reduced emissions allocations and have allocations
to sell; or, under command-and-control, it would be an issue of
the Board prescribing VOC limits that, in theory, could only be
met through use of UV coatings.
<P>
MR. PAULITZ MOVED TO:
<P>
1) RECEIVE AND FILE THE BACT METHODOLOGY REPORT, INCLUDING THE
MODIFICATIONS TO THE USER'S GUIDE CONTAINED IN THE ERRATA SHEET;
<P>
2) ESTABLISH THE SCIENTIFIC REVIEW COMMITTEE AS A STANDING COMMITTEE
TO CONSIDER FUTURE BACT ISSUES; AND
<P>
3) DIRECT STAFF TO BRING THE NEW BACT GUIDELINE AND ANY SUBSEQUENT
UPDATES OR REVISIONS BACK TO THE BOARD FOR APPROVAL AS A CONSENT
CALENDAR ITEM.
<P>
THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. SOTO, AND APPROVED BY A UNANIMOUS
VOTE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Antonovich and Braude).
<P>
Agenda Item No. 39 was taken out of order, since 49 individuals
had submitted requests to address the Board on Item No. 35 and
only 4 requests to speak had been submitted for Item No. 39.
<P>
Ms. Soto made a motion to take up Agenda Item No. 37 immediately
following Item <BR>
No. 39. The motion died, for lack of a second.
<P>
39. Amend Rule 1130 - Graphic Arts
<P>
In the interest of time, William Fray, Assistant DEO/Stationary
Source Compliance, waived the staff presentation on this item.
The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from
the following individuals:
<P>
<U>GERALD BONETTO, Printing Industries of California</U> 
<P>
Commented that AQMD is the only air district in California that
requires daily, rather than monthly, recordkeeping; and urged
the Board to have staff bring this issue back to the Board for
consideration in the near future.
<P>
RITA LOOF and LONNIE MURPHY, Radtech
<P>
<U>DAVID KANDEL, Avery Dennison LDNA </U>
<P>
Commented that UV/EB products are currently available, and are
viable alternatives for flexographic, lithographic and gravure
printing operations to meet industry standards and AQMD regulations.
<P>
<U>CURTIS COLEMAN, California Film Extruder's and Converters'
Association</U> 
<P>
Requested that the Board direct staff to conduct a technology
audit for compliance with Rule 1130 for several specialty inks
used in plastic film printing operations and report back to the
Board at its January 1996 Board meeting regarding what amendments
to the Rule are warranted to address this situation, including
a date by which such amendments could be brought back to the Board
for adoption.
<P>
<U>AYJAY WILSON, AQC Environmental Engineers, Inc.</U> 
<P>
Submitted written comments and indicated that in working with
staff, he had resolved some technical issues.
<P>
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P>
With respect to the recordkeeping issue raised, Dr. Lents responded

other air districts in California required monthly or daily records;
and could report back to the Board on that issue in January 1996.

<U><B>PUBLIC HEARINGS (Continued)</B></U> 
<P>
35. Amend Rule 1136 - Wood Products Coatings
<P>
Mr. Fray presented the staff report, and the public hearing was
opened. Since 49 individuals had submitted requests to speak on
this item--only two of which had indicated opposition to the staff
recommendation--and there were three other public hearing items
yet to be considered by the Board, Chairman Mikels proposed the
following in order to expedite the proceedings:
<P>
(i) that Mr. Silva present, in concept, the motion he intended
to make following public testimony, modifying staff's recommendation;
<P>
(ii) take a straw poll to determine if there was any significant
dissent among Board members to staff's recommendation with Mr.
Silva's proposed modifications; and
<P>
(iii) limit public testimony to only those individuals who wished
to comment in opposition to the staff recommendation with Mr.
Silva's proposed modifications.
<P>
Mr. Silva presented his proposal that the Board:
<P>
1) Adopt the staff recommendations for PAR 1136, with the following
modifications,
<P>
extend the September 1, 1995 compliance date for Rule 1136 until
July 1, 1996;
<P>
include incentives for companies that make an early conversion
to clean coatings, including quarterly reporting and use of alternative
spray equipment for super-compliant coatings;
<P>
allow averaging of super-compliant and under-compliant formulations
with EPA's 10 percent discount; and
<P>
dovetail Rule 1136 with RECLAIM;
<P>
2) Direct staff to
<P>
propose amendments to Rule 102 to include acetone as an exempt
solvent;
<P>
propose amendments to Rule 301 to provide a 25 percent discount
in annual fees for any Rule 1136 company that makes an early conversion
to clean coatings; and
<P>
form a working group with an industry task force to address issues
and to study the national Reg/Neg Rule as a possible alternative
to Rule 1136.
<P>
In response to a question by Mr. Loveridge, Mr. Silva clarified
that the intent of his recommendation to form a working group
was to create a means for staff and industry to resolve any issues
or disagreements that might arise.
<P>
Commenting on the same recommendation, Ms. Lee, Mr. Paulitz and
Dr. Wilson expressed concern with leaving Rule 1136 open at this
point to possible alternatives. They believed it would be the
wrong message to send to industry that the July 1, 1996 compliance
date, which has already been extended several times, might not
be definite because of the possibility that the national standards
may be adopted.
<P>
Mr. Silva indicated that in order to address the concerns expressed
by Board members, he was agreeable to amending the last recommendation
to delete the language following the word &quot;issues&quot;.
<P>
The Board heard testimony in opposition to the staff recommendation,
with Mr. Silva's proposed modifications, from the following individuals:
<P>
*LEE RUBOTTOM, W.L. Rubottom Company
<P>
JESSE J. RINCON, Commercial Wood Products
<P>
ROBERT PEDERSEN, Water Colors All in One
<P>
JIM VINCOLISI, Custom Wood Shed
<P>
<U>ADAM M. SMITH, Eclectic Products, Inc. </U>
<P>
*Submitted Written Comments
<P>
Opposed extending the compliance date in Rule 1136 because there
are compliant water-based coatings which have been available for
several years and can be supplied at reasonable, competitive prices,
with minimal equipment changes for most operations.
<P>
<U>MR. G.M. CURRIER, Akzo Nobel</U> 
<P>
Supported adoption of the national standard throughout the United
States in order to level the playing field between various regions.
(Submitted Written Comments.)
<P>
<U>MICHAEL CARROLL, Attorney, Fender Musical Instruments</U> 
<P>
Requested that the Board extend the present exemption for classic
guitars, Subparagraph (k)(3), from January 1, 1996 to July 1,
1996 in order to dovetail with VOC RECLAIM; the development and
implementation of which was recently postponed for several months.
(Submitted Written Comments.)
<P>
Chairman Mikels closed the public hearing, and called for a formal
motion on the item; at which time the public hearing would be
re-opened to allow further comments, if any, on the motion.
<P>
MR. SILVA MOVED THAT THE BOARD:
<P>
1) ADOPT RESOLUTION NO. 95-24, AMENDING RULE 1136 AND CERTIFYING
THE PREVIOUSLY-PREPARED CEQA DOCUMENTS AND ADDENDUM, AS RECOMMENDED
BY STAFF, WITH THE FOLLOWING MODIFICATIONS,
<P>
<I>extend the September 1, 1995 compliance date for Rule 1136
until <BR>

of Rule 1136 from January 1, 1996 to July 1, 1996.</I> 
<P>
2) DIRECT STAFF TO

<P>
<I>propose amendments to Rule 301 to provide a 25 percent discount
in annual fees for any Rule 1136 company that makes an early conversion
to clean coatings; and</I> 
<P>
<I>form a working group with an industry task force to address
issues.</I> 
<P>
THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. SOTO.
<P>
Mr. Hewitt expressed his support of the motion, although he would
have preferred leaving in the language regarding studying the
Reg/Neg rule as a possible alternative.
<P>
The public hearing was re-opened, and the Board heard testimony
from the following individuals:
<P>
ROGER BENVENUTTI, Akzo Nobel
<P>
CHARLES GRUBBS, Lilly Industries, Montebello, CA
<P>
ARCHIE MARTZ, Lilly Industries, High Point, NC
<P>
<U>*ED LAIRD, Small Business Coalition </U>
<P>
* Submitted Written Comments
<P>
Supported the Reg/Neg Rule as an alternative because, while water-based
coatings work for some operations all of the time and all operations
some of the time, it does not work for all operations all of the
time. Many problems still remain to be solved in the application
of water-based finishes on wood furniture; and it was doubtful
that all those problems would be resolved by the proposed July
1, 1996 compliance date.
<P>
Chairman Mikels pointed out that removing the language regarding
the Reg/Neg Rule from the motion does not preclude that from being
one of the issues that will be addressed by the working group.
<P>
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.

The staff report was presented by Larry Bowen, Senior Air Quality
Engineering Manager. The public hearing was opened, and the Board
heard testimony from the following individuals:
<P>
RON WILKNISS, Western States Petroleum Association
<P>
<U>KEN SCARBROUGH, GTE </U>
<P>
Mr. Wilkniss and Mr. Scarbrough expressed support for PAR 461;
with Mr. Scarbrough's support being contingent upon availability
of the technology.
<P>
Mr. Bowen responded that there are at least three manufacturers
located in the basin that have Phase I and Phase II vapor recovery
systems available, and staff will work with GTE and help them
through the ARB certification process.
<P>
<U>JOHN BILLHEIMER, Consultant </U>

<P>
37. Adopt Proposed Rule 1612 - Credits for Clean On-Road Vehicles
and Rule 1620 - Credits for Clean Off-Road Equipment
<P>
Planning Director Jack Broadbent presented the staff report, and
noted that copies of an Errata Sheet on this item had been distributed
to Board members and made available to the public. The Errata
Sheet contained minor changes to the staff report in order to
be consistent with <BR>
PR 1612.
<P>
The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from
the following individuals:
<P>
<U>MARK ABRAMOWITZ, Coalition for Innovative Solutions</U> 
<P>
1) Supported PR 1612 and PR 1620, and suggested the following
amendments to address the concern that the rule does not offer
truly effective incentives for companies to adopt innovative conversion
programs nor optimum flexibility for companies in future years,
when credits will be needed most:
<P>
<U><B>PR 1612</B></U> 
<P>
Amend definition for Discount Factor under subparagraphs (g)(1)(A),
(g)(1)(B), (g)(4)(A) and (g)(4)(B), as well as paragraphs (g)(2)
and (g)(3) as follows:
<P>
DF = Discount Factor, <U>for the purpose of generating credits,</U>
equal to 1.0 <STRIKE>for credits used for compliance with REG
XV rules or NSR offsets; equal to 1.2 for credits used for compliance
with REG XI rules or RECLAIM</STRIKE>.
<P>
Insert after paragraph (h)(1), new paragraph (h)(2), and renumber
subsequent paragraphs accordingly:
<P>
<U>For the purpose of using MSERCs pursuant to subparagraphs (h)(1)(A)
and (h)(1)(B), a discount factor equal to 1.2 shall be applied
except for MSERCs generated by the (1) operation of post 1992
model-year vehicles that are certified at or below ultra-low-emission
standards; (2) operation of CNG, LPG, or methanol heavy-duty engines
certified to optional emission standards using ARB certified conversion
kits; or (3) operation of zero-emission vehicles. For other uses
pursuant to paragraph (h)(1), a discount factor equal to 1.0 shall
be applied unless specified otherwise in District regulations.</U>

<P>
<U><B>PR 1620</B></U> 
<P>
Amend definition for Discount Factor under paragraphs (g)(1) and
(g)(2) as follows:
<P>
DF = Discount Factor,<U> for the purpose of generating credits,</U>
equal to 1.0 <STRIKE>for credits used for compliance with REG
XV rules or NSR offsets; equal to 1.2 for credits used for compliance
with RECLAIM and REG XI rules</STRIKE>.
<P>
Insert paragraph (h)(1), new paragraph (h)(2), and renumber subsequent
paragraphs accordingly:
<P>
<U>For the purpose of using MSERCs pursuant to subparagraph (h)(1)(A)
and (h)(1)(B), a discount factor equal to 1.2 shall be applied,
except that a discount factor equal to 1.0 shall be applied for
operation of zero-emission equipment. For other uses pursuant
to paragraph (h)(1), a discount factor equal to 1.0 shall be applied
unless specified otherwise in District regulations.</U> 
<P>
2) With respect to their concern that the proposed rules do not
allow banking, supported staff's intent to address the banking
issue through the Intercredit Trading Report and, if the Board
provides, for staff to bring the rules back for amendment in Spring
of 1996.
<P>
3) Suggested that the rule explicitly allow for trading or selling
of mobile credits between sources. (Submitted Written Comments.)

<P>
Expressed support of PR 1612 and PR 1620 as recommended.
<P>
<U>DEBORAH KURILCHYK, Southern California Edison</U> 
<P>
1) Supported the proposed rules, and emphasized the need for banking
of credits, which would encourage early investment in new technologies,
stimulate technology development in the early years, and ease
the cost of compliance in the long run.
<P>
2) Commented that Senate Bill 456 (Kelley) which is currently
before the State Legislature would allow the use of credits in
lieu of BARCT; and suggested, upon passage of that bill, that
the Board amend Regulation XVI to incorporate the legislative
changes and expand the use of credits.
<P>
JAMES DIVEN, American Airlines
<P>
<U>GARY PETERSEN, Waste Management/Recycle America</U> 
<P>
Supported the proposed rules, and the amendments presented by
the Coalition for Innovative Solutions.
<P>
ROBERT WYMAN, Coalition for Local Environmental Solutions and
a Competitive Economy <U>(COALESCE) </U>
<P>
Supported PR 1612 and PR 1620, and urged the Board to direct staff
to set a public hearing by no later than the February 1996 Board
meeting for consideration of: (i) extending credit life (i.e.,
banking); (ii) expanding eligible credit uses; and (iii) removing
discounts. (Submitted Written Comments.)
<P>
<U>JEB STUART, Construction Industry</U> 
<P>
Supported PR 1620, but wanted to have on the record that what
was being proposed would not be used as leverage for owners/operators
of the equipment to replace equipment more rapidly than the normal
turnover that would occur if national standards are set for emissions
from diesel-driven off-road equipment.

Mr. Paulitz requested that staff respond regarding the banking
issue. Mr. Broadbent responded that staff is looking at unlimited
banking as part of the Intercredit Study. Staff does not disagree
with the comment that banking provisions can provide a powerful
incentive for technological development; however staff wants to
examine that issue relative to the different trading programs,
understanding that banking could have a potential impact on the
overall attainment demonstration. With respect to expanding the
use of credits, that is also an issue staff wants to examine to
ensure enforcement capability.
<P>
In response to the request during public testimony for clarification,
Mr. Broadbent added for the record that these rules will allow
the generation and use of credits for the selling, trading and
buying of MSERCs.
<P>
With respect to the request by COALESCE, Mr. Broadbent indicated
that staff was supportive of setting a public hearing on the issues
specified by no later than February 1996 for Rules 1612 and 1620
and many other District Rules. Staff plans to have the Intercredit
Study released in October 1995, with an action plan before the
Board in January 1996 for public hearing.

38. Amend Rule 2011 - Requirements for Monitoring, Reporting and
Recordkeeping for Oxides of Sulfur Emissions; and Amend Rule 2012
- Requirements for Monitoring, Reporting and Recordkeeping for
Oxides of Nitrogen Emissions
<P>
Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, presented the
staff report and pointed out that references to &quot;clauses
(E)(1)(e)(i), (E)(1)(e)(ii) and (E)(1)(e)(iii)&quot; in subparagraphs
v. and vi. of Chapter 2.E.1.d. of the Proposed Amended Protocols

<P>
Supported the proposed amendments, and requested: (i) that subparagraphs
(c)(3)(A) of Rules 2011 and 2012 be amended to allow use of interim
reporting procedures until<BR>
December 31, 1995; and (ii) an additional amendment for consideration
by the Board, after the required public notice has been provided,
to subparagraph iv. of Chapter 2.E.1.d. of Rules 2011 and 2012
Protocols to extend the use of interim reporting procedures until
December 31, 1995, retroactively from July 1, 1995, for companies
that have been granted variances by the Hearing Board from the
requirement to have an approved RECLAIM certified CEMS and/or
RTU installed by July 1, 1995.
<P>
Ms. Leyden agreed that the RTUs are complicated, technology-forcing
pieces of equipment and indicated that staff was agreeable to
bringing the issue back to the Board at a later date for amendment.
However, for the record, staff did not concur with the request
to remove the missing data provisions for large emitters under
a variance. It was staff's belief that the missing data provisions
were included in the rules to accelerate those companies in installing
and operating the CEMS.

<B>AUGUST 1995</B> 
<P>
<I>Highlights of the activities of this reporting period are listed
below. A statistical report of these activities is also included.
Contact La Ronda Bowen, Public Advisor at (909) 396-3235, if you
have any questions.</I> 
<P>
<B>BUSINESS OUTREACH &amp; PUBLIC EDUCATION</B> 
<P>
During the month staff participated in the following activities,
programs and events:
<P>
BUSINESS CLEAN AIR PARTNERSHIP - The Public Advisor's Office was
involved in the following activities involving the Business Clean
Air Partnership:
<UL>
<LI>The Public Advisor's staff facilitated the distribution of
the &quot;Customer Bill of Rights&quot; cards and information
sheets. The cards and sheets are prominently displayed at various
places in the AQMD's lobby. They are also being sent out with
all permit applications, invoices, Regulation XV manuals, and
documents requested through the Public Information Center. The
cards were printed in a special edition of AQMD's <I>Advisor </I>newsletter,
and also included with a copy <I>Inside the AQMD</I> that was
provided to each AQMD employee<I>. </I>The &quot;Bill of Rights&quot;
was developed to assist businesses and the public in understanding
their rights and the services available to them when working with
the AQMD. The &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; is point XII of the Business
Clean Air Partnership.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Staff facilitated a Public Consultation meeting on Proposed
Rule 310 - Amnesty for Unpermitted Equipment. The meeting was
held August 22, 1995 in the AQMD Auditorium. The purpose of the
rule is to create an incentive for unpermitted sources to apply
for required permits, assuring compliance and creating a &quot;level
playing field&quot; for all businesses in the South Coast Air
Basin. To give the owners of unpermitted equipment an opportunity
to obtain their permits without fear of penalty, the AQMD will
provide a proposed one-time six month amnesty period between October
3, 1995 and April 2, 1996. Proposed Rule 310 implements Point
X of the Business Clean Air Partnership
</UL>

<P>
METALWORK INDUSTRY FORUM - August 30, 1995 at the Department of
Water and Power in Los Angeles. Public Advisor La Ronda Bowen
was a speaker at this forum for the metal, metalwork and industrial
machinery industry sponsored by REBUILD LA. She gave a presentation
on how companies can bridge the gap between economic growth and
clean air.
<P>
PERMIT STREAMLINING - The AQMD's Public Advisor and Small Business
Assistance Offices cooperated with the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency to coordinate a small business roundtable meeting to discuss
improvements in the environmental permitting process. The staff
sent out invitations to attend the roundtable to 100 representatives
of various small businesses and small business advocacy groups.
The meeting was held on August 22, 1995 at the Southern California
Gas Company Energy Resource Center in Downey.
<P>
AUTOMATED PHONE INFORMATION SYSTEM - The Public Information Center
received its first full month accounting report on it's automated
phone information system. The system received an average of 1,053
calls per day in August. The system provides callers with self-service
access to information on meetings, workshops, air quality readings
and forecasts by simply entering their zip codes. Callers can
also request rules or publications, and obtain updates on District
programs. The system is operational 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week
without requiring any increase in Public Information Center staff.
<P>
SMOGBUSTERS UPDATE - Over 2,100 students have joined the AQMD
Smogbusters Club as of this month. The goal of the Club is to
promote the voluntary reduction of air pollution through education
and information. The Smogbusters Club was initiated for 10-12
year-olds during the summer of 1994 by the creation and distribution
of the Smogbuster Activity Book. The booklet features science
experiments, class projects and the chance to join the Club and
receive free updates and prizes.
<P>
KIDS CARE FAIRS<B> - </B>The Seventh Annual Kids Care Fair offers
vision and dental screenings, immunizations and information about
public health services for thousands of our youngest residents.
This year, AQMD will join KABC, FHP, the American Red Cross, UNOCAL
and Children Now, to co-sponsor 40 fair sites between September
8 - 10, 1995. The District will provide an environmental health
booth at several fair sites staffed by volunteers. The sponsorship
enables AQMD to disseminate educational information and provide
&quot;hands on&quot; learning experiences about air pollution
to children and their parents.
<P>
VISITING DIGNITARIES - Delegates from two different countries
visited the District during the month. They included:
<UL>
<LI>August 3, 1995: Councilman Chia-Ji Teng of the City of Taipei,
Taiwan met with AQMD Intergovernmental affairs staff to learn
about the role local governments have in implementing air pollution
control measures to comply with state and federal clean air mandates.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Professor Do-Wan Ku, Ph.D., Seoul National University Department
of Sociology, met with AQMD Stationary Source Compliance, Technology
Advancement and Public Advisor's staff to learn more about RECLAIM,
alternative fuels and information on general air quality issues.
</UL>

<P>
Along with coordinating the visits foreign officials to the District,
when appropriate, the Public Advisor's staff also refers them
to area businesses for information about the purchase of air pollution
control equipment and technology.

South Coast Air Quality
<P>
Management District Board
<H3><CENTER> Set a Public Hearing to Amend Rule 102 - Definition
of Terms <FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
</CENTER><U><B>Introduction</B></U> 
<P>
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined
that acetone, ethane, parachlorobenzotrifluoride (PCBTF), and
volatile methylated siloxanes (VMS) have negligible photochemical
reactivity and should be considered exempt compounds. They officially
exempted PCBTF and VMS on December 5, 1994, and acetone on June
16, 1995. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD)
is therefore proposing to include these materials in the definition
of Exempt Compounds in Rule 102 - Definition of Terms. The AQMD
also proposes to add minor clarifying language, including definitions
of Executive Officer and particulate matter of 10 microns or less
(PM10).
<P>
The proposed amendment of the exempt compound definition in Rule
102 will supersede all exempt organic compound (VOC) definitions
in all other AQMD regulations including, but not limited to, Regulations
III, IV, XI, and XIII; however, the proposed changes will have
no impact on existing emission limits.
<P>
The AQMD received tremendous interest regarding the addition of
these materials to the exempt compound list, mostly from companies
manufacturing paints, coatings, and solvents as well as the aerospace,
wood furniture, paper coating, and foam blowing industries. Although
a public workshop was not required, AQMD staff did contact interested
parties to request comments and answer questions.
<P>
EPA requested public input regarding their proposed exemption
of these materials on several occasions during the last two years.
The supporting EPA documents for VMS and PCBTF contained no public
opposition (40 CFR Part 51 Vol. 59, No. 192, effective December
5, 1994). Fifty-two public comments were received for acetone
(40 CFR Part 51 Vol. 60, No. 116, effective June 16, 1995), and
80 percent of them were in favor of the exemption proposal. The
negative comments came from industries that developed low solvent
technologies and from individuals who felt acetone was too reactive
to be considered exempt. EPA responded that acetone has negligible
reactivity and this proposal does not restrict the use of other
low-solvent technologies. In addition, EPA documents report that
all four materials have virtually zero stratospheric ozone depletion
potential and insignificant global warming potential.
<P>
<U>DISCUSSION</U> 
<P>
Acetone, PCBTF, and VMS are estimated to replace up to four tons
per day of compounds that are photochemically reactive, nine tons
per day of ozone depleting compounds (ODC), and one ton per day
of toxics. These replaced compounds include ketones, toluene,
xylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, perchloroethylene, and methylene
chloride. Ethane will not serve as a replacement material for
other compounds and its current use should not be impacted. The
primary sources of ethane emissions are refineries and natural-gas-handling
facilities. Ethane is not commercially available in the United
States.
<P>
Acetone is expected to be used as a replacement for solvents used
in coating, hand wiping, stripping, and surface cleaning operations,
and as a blowing agent in foam manufacturing. Acetone is volatile,
odorous, and flammable, but is relatively inexpensive at $2.10
a gallon. A potential concern with acetone is its ability in high
concentrations to be a precursor to the formation of formaldehyde.
Both EPA and the Air Resources Board (ARB) staff anticipate, however,
that the substitution of acetone may reduce formaldehyde concentrations
because acetone is less reactive than the materials it will replace,
such as toluene and xylene. ARB plans to sample acetone concentrations
at their six monitoring stations located in the AQMD to determine
if any emission increase occurs.
<P>
VMS is a class of compounds currently consisting of 14 materials
of which six are commercially available. VMS is flammable and
costly, at a current price of $65 a gallon. It is a potential
replacement for ODC and VOC materials in paints, consumer products,
and cold solvent cleaning.
<P>
PCBTF is also costly at $21 a gallon. It is flammable, odorous,
and moderately toxic. Cal/EPA's Office of Environmental Health
Hazard Assessment has determined, however, that its toxic impacts
are not expected to result in specific health effects. Current
PCBTF toxicity data on humans is subject to further study. PCBTF
is a potential replacement for ODC and VOC materials in paints,
consumer products, and cold solvent cleaning.
<P>
The Exempt Compounds definition divides materials into Groups
I and II. Both Groups I and II include exempt compounds of VOC,
but Group II compounds are either toxic, potentially toxic, upper-atmosphere
ozone depleters, or cause other environmental impacts. Acetone,
ethane, PCBTF, and VMS are all proposed to be placed in Group
I.
<P>
The proposed amendments will encourage current users of Group
II compounds, toxic VOC, and reactive VOC to switch to the proposed
four Group I compounds. The majority of the switches will be to
acetone because of its lower price. Thus, there will be savings
to the affected facilities. On the other hand, the switches will
lower the AQMD's revenue from emission fees because lower fees
are assessed on Group I compounds due to their low photochemical
reactivity. Therefore, the amendments to this rule are a cost-effective
alternative since the proposed changes are not mandatory.
<P>
<U>CONCLUSION</U> 
<P>
Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and
the AQMD's Certified Regulatory Program (Rule 110), the AQMD has
prepared appropriate CEQA documentation for the proposed amendments
consisting of a Draft Environmental Assessment (EA). The Draft
EA has been released for public review and comment. The Final
EA will include responses to all comments received on the Draft
EA. The Draft Staff Report, Draft Socioeconomic Assessment, and
Draft EA are attached.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Set a public hearing for November 17, 1995, to amend Rule 102
- Definition of Terms.

Respectfully,
