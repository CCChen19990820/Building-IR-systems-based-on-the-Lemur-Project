BATTLE ROCK. BATTLE.<br>
<br>
Don Marshall, "The Siege of Battle Rock," <B>Oregon Shipwrecks.</B> Portland: Binfords and Mort,  1985. p. 16-21.<br>
<br>
Jessie Applegate's quotations in the ensuing narrative have been simulated by the author, based upon James M. Kirkpatrick's later re-
call of his visit to the home of the early Oregon pioneer.  All quotations of James Kirkpatrick are as he recorded them.<br>
<br>
"William Tichenor was either incredibly stupid or incredibly greedy.  Stupid 'cause he should've known those Siwash Indians, some call them Rogue River Indians, are as mean a bunch of blood-thirsty savages as ever roamed the face o' the earth.  Then again, maybe he<br>
knowed that all along and, as I said, was greedy about wanting to start that town down the coast below Coos Bay.  In any case, son, you're powerful lucky to get away with your scalp.  Yessir, you sure are."<br>
<br>
With that, Jessie Applegate, early pioneer of Oregon, no doubt folded the newspaper describing the death of the very man who now sat opposite him at the rough-hewn table.<br>
<br>
"Come on, lad, dish yourself up another plate of vittles and tell me that story again about your escape from those heathen savages.<br>
<br>
"Mmmph," young John Kirkpatrick might have grunted as he munched another large mouthful of pork and beans.  "Well, you see, all of us were pretty eager after hearing Captain Tichenor's sales talk about a new town he planned to start down south as a supply station for the miners back in the gold diggings in southern Oregon.<br>
<br>
"He told us that in these peaceful days of 1851 we needn't fear the least particle of danger from coastal Indians.  He said that he, himself, wandered freely amongst them many times and knew them as friends.  He guaranteed, if we joined him and his two partners, to give us a share in property plus bonus profits from being town-founders.<br>
<br>
"As you know, Captain Tichenor owned the steamer Sea Gull, a screw propeller he runs between San Francisco and Portland.  His partners in the venture were his boat's Purser, Mr. Hubboard, and a fellow named Butler King, Chief of the Custom House in San Francisco.  The good captain also promised to supply everything we needed ... blankets, grub, tools, except he didn't mention anything about guns.  Naturally, I expected Tichenor to furnish us with guns, mainly I cause I had a bit of an experience with Indians when I crossed the Rockies with Kit Carson, so the rest of the boys sort of left that end of it up to me. 
"The captain, just to satisfy me, I suppose, said he'd get us some arms right off.  He walked into the nearest junk shop and bought three old flintlock muskets, one old rusty sword, about ten pounds of lead, and four pounds of powder.  'Now just don't you worry yourselves none, boys,' he told us.  'I admit these weapons don't look like much to you, but just having them around will scare those Indians enough and make you look mighty dangerous.'<br>
<br>
"Well, just then a lieutenant from Fort George stepped up and said he owned a very good United States rifle he'd sell me for twenty dollars, so we go take a look at the piece.  It's a good one, so I buy it and some more ammunition and powder.  Our total arsenal now consists of my U.S. rifle, one sixshooter rifle of Carigan's, the three old flintlocks, a rusty sword, one thirty-eight caliber revolver, and a pair of derringers loaned to me some time ago by a friend in Portland.  We also carried five pounds of rifle powder and ten of lead.<br>
<br>
"On June 6th we stored our gear aboard the Sea Gull and sailed out of Astoria." The weedy young man probably gulped down another swig of scalding coffee before continuing with his narrative.  "On the morning of the 9th we unloaded our supplies onto a sandy beach near a big rock that kind of stuck out in the ocean aways from shore.<br>
<br>
The few Indians we saw didn't look so all fired friendly, so I told Captain Tichenor to unload that old cannon he carried aboard the steamer.  Well ... mind if I have some more of that grub?"<br>
<br>
"Help yourself, son."<br>
<br>
"Thanks."<br>
<br>
The speaker must have scraped the old wooden spoon around the interior of the pot until absolutely no crumb of beans or drop of juice remained for the dishwasher's rag.  The youthful adventurer probably again seated himself at the wooden table before he contin-
ued.<br>
<br>
"Anyway, Captain Tichenor laughed, but then he saw we weren't fooling.  He thought it over and finally let us unload and freight the cannon to shore.  Now Eagan, a gunner in his younger days, returned with three or four bag-cartridges, each of which held two pounds of powder.  The captain, laughing and saying he'd return in fourteen days with more supplies and men, shoved off in the Sea Gull for 'Frisco.<br>
<br>
"We stood alone on the beach and took another good hard look at those Indians, then decided to set up camp on that funny-looking rock that stuck halfway out in the water.  At least there the water protected us on three sides and, in the front, only a kind of narrow causeway led to the beach.<br>

"I'll tell you, we hustled our stuff up there mighty fast.  Those Indians started crowding around on the beach with more and more savages arriving all the time.  We set down that old gun about halfway up the rock on a flat spot about thirty feet wide and primed it in record time.  Eagan and I loaded it while the others started building breastworks.<br>
<br>
"We charged the cannon with a two-pound sack of powder.  I shoved in an old shirt while one of the other boys took an ax and chopped up the bar lead.  We poured in as much lead as I could hold in my two out-stretched palms, then crammed in some newspapers on top of that.  Eagan pricked the sack, we primed the touch hole with fine powder, and trained the piece so's to rake the approach."<br>
<br>
"Have a pipe, if you're amind to," the older man would have suggested.<br>
<br>
"Thanks, sure will." Kirkpatrick no doubt gratefully reached for the offered clay pipe, stuffed it from the tobacco jar, lighted up with a hot coal, puffed contentedly, and no doubt continued, "The minute them Indians saw the Sea Gull weigh anchor, they commence making signs like they didn't want us around and would have our scalps if we stayed.  I wondered just where all those friendly redskins were that Captain Tichenor knew so well.<br>
<br>
"The next morning the savages started delivering arrows, but from a distance that didn't much concern us.  Then we noticed a large canoe moving up from the direction of the Rogue River with twelve warriors in battle gear plus one great big red-shirted fellow yelling and waving his arms and raising all kinds of fuss.  The war party beached the canoe ... Red-Shirt pulled out a long knife, waved it over his head, and then with about a hundred of them beach warriors, started for us with a rush.<br>
<br>
"I scrambled down to man the cannon and stood by with a smoldering tarred rope until they got closer.  Carigan grabbed a pine board about fifteen inches wide and eight feet long.  He jumped behind me and held the board in front of the two of us with both his arms around me.  Later, we counted thirty-seven arrows stuck in it ... some with their points shoved all the way through the inch and a half thick slab.<br>
<br>
"Palmer let out a thick gurgle as an arrow pierced his neck.  Redoubt caught one right in the chest.  Luckily, it stuck in his breast bone, so didn't sink in any further.  Slater ran and jumped in a hole behind the tent. just about then a bunch of yelling banshees, led by RedShirt, scrambled up the rock causeway.  I waited'til they was about eight feet in front of me before I touched off the prime powder with the fiery end of my rope.  That cannon-
belched off with a fearsome roar, then tumbled over backwards.<br>

"Well, you never seen such a mess.  The execution was fearful... at least twelve or thirteen Indians blown up right off and a bunch others sure had daylight peeking through.  What redskins we didn't knock down, jumped or fell off the rock.<br>
<br>
"All except two.  One, eyeing my scalp, kept coming right at me.  Carigan shot him in the shoulder, then Summers shot him in the middle ... he still kept coming.  He swiped at me with his knife, but I knocked it out of his hand.  When he reached for it, I pulled out one of my derringers and shot him in the head.  The ball slammed in one temple and burst out the other.  Believe it or not, he turned and ran about twenty feet before falling dead amongst the others.<br>
<br>
"The other Indian headed for Eagan.  Eagan's musket misfired, so he smashed the redskin over the head three or four times with it, which knocked the Indian off the rock and into the ocean.  You know, Eagan bent the barrel of that musket six inches!"<br>
<br>
Kirkpatrick could have leaned back and exhaled a cloud of smoke toward the open beam ceiling before continuing.  "Them Indians never saw a firearm as big as a cannon before, so naturally they thought we brung down thunder and lightning from the sky.  Soon, their chief walked to within hailing distance, laid down his bow, quiver, and knife, making signs like he wanted to talk.  I climbed down the rock onto the beach and met him.<br>
<br>
"He was muscular, well proportioned, and tall; one of the finest specimens of manhood I ever did see.  He made signs about wanting to carry off his dead brothers... a kind of truce, so I agreed.  Some of the other warriors laid down their arms, then packed off the dead and wounded, all except for the big one in the red shirt.  I tried to make them cart him off, too, but they refused.  Then the chief did something we couldn't figure out.<br>
<br>
"He tore off that red shirt, gave the body a good swift kick, and walked off . Since the savages wanted nothing to do with him, we had to bury old Red Shirt ourselves.  After that, things quieted down for a bit.<br>
<br>
"Hussey walked over to tell me something. Just as he put his hand on my shoulder to get my attention, a bullet sang over and almost cut his thumb off.  That was too close for my taste.  That was the first time in all this ruckus that the Indians fired a bullet and it really surprised us.<br>
<br>
"The Indian with that gun had crawled unnoticed to within about sixty yards of us.  He was so sure he hit me that he leaped up and showed himself.  Now it was my turn.  I had a slug and five buckshot in my rifle, so drew a bead and let fly.  He lolloped about three feet high, then fell dead.  Eagan ran down to retrieve the injun's gun.  
"When he found it defective, he broke the stock and left it. He did bring back the brave's headdress, though ... it was made of different colored shells and mighty handsome.  That was the last savage we killed that day.  We counted twenty of them dead. 19<br>
<br>
"By now we sure wanted out of there.  If these be Captain Tichenor's friendly Indians, then I'd sorely hate to meet up with any that were mad at us."<br>
<br>
Jesse Applegate must have chuckled at that as J. M. continued, "Anyhow, we made it plain to the chief that when our ship returned in thirteen days we'd leave, so he agreed to a temporary truce.  We spent some mighty worried next few days, but they was as good as their word and never even came within sight of our rock.<br>
<br>
"On the thirteenth day a bunch of braves gathered on the beach.  When no ship anchored to take us off, they became mighty irate.  They figured we broke our promise.  The chief pepped them all up with a talk, then pulled out his knife, and led them howling savages up our rock.  I ordered Jim, the best shot of all the men, to take a bead with me on the chief and fire when I did.  The chief dropped with two slugs in him.<br>
<br>
"All those blood-thirsty warriors let out a terrible groan, then carried him off over the hill and out of sight.  In about an hour, another big chief showed up, started the same kind of pep talk, and danged if he don't lead them the same way... all the while they're making signs with their knives that they're going to cut our heads off.  Soon as the new chief gets close, we fire.  He drops dead and that stops all that nonsense for the rest of the day.<br>
<br>
"Soon we spotted all kinds of canoes coming in and a lot of campfires blazing down on the beach.  We count about five hundred Indians and only nine of us.  We decided to try to fool them into thinking we're staying, that way maybe they'll hold off their attack.  We busy ourselves with building more breastworks and pretending to settle in.<br>
<br>
"When we see their spies run off to tell the new chief we're staying, we sneak off, taking only our weapons, an ax, and some rope.  We headed north on the beach at a fast run.  About three miles up, we ran into about thirty braves on their way down to join the others.  We yelled, then charged them.  They were so flabbergasted that they scattered and we didn't even have to fire one single shot.  We kept on going fast, beating through the brush all night.<br>
<br>

"The next day we came to a large, flat plain and could hardly believe our luck.  At last, now we'd make good time.  But when we got onto it, the plain turned out to be a soft, mushy swamp thick with roots, water to our arm pits, and black with millions of mos-
quitoes.  We spent all night crossing it.  The next morning we hit hard ground and found a wide trail made by the hundreds of Indians who were after us, but passed us during the night.  We located the spot where they turned off to look for us inland.<br>
<br>
"Finally we reached the Coquille River, but discovered three or four hundred Indians from a different tribe standing on the other side.  They barred our crossing, so we trekked along the stream.  Them savages kept opposite us all the way.  We clawed to the top of a cliff and kept parallel to the river on high ground.<br>
<br>
"After a time, we figured we left the Indians far enough downstream to chance fashioning a raft and crossing in the fog to the other side.  Too late, we discovered we landed on an island and, fools that we were, had let our raft drift off.<br>
<br>
"The fog cleared, but we found no wood for another raft.  George swam across to cut a pine for the men who couldn't swim.  They could hold our rifles and hang on while we pushed.  Then, doggone if four Indians don't come along in a canoe.  They spot George and we spot them, but as soon as they saw our guns leveled on them, they tamed right down and agreed to canoe us across.<br>
<br>
"Well, we got safely to the other side and kept moving'til we came to a beach.  Here we found some mussels on the rocks.  After starv-
ing for three nights and four days, we ate them raw.  All of us ended up sick, so we chanced a fire.  The cooked mussels stayed put this time.<br>
<br>
"One of the Indians who canoed us across the river shoved his way through the brush to say he knew me from Portland and followed us from the river to tell us to hurry since a war party trailed close behind.  We headed up the beach until about three that afternoon, at which time we discovered a twenty foot high white pole stuck in the sand and anchored with rocks around its base.  Our tame Indian told us that marked the boundary line between the Siwash and the Coos Bay, Umpqua, and Clickatat tribes.  If the Siwashes took one step past that pole, they'd be hunted down and killed by the other tribes.<br>
<br>
"Further along we met up with some friendly Indians who fed us, then gave us some salmon, elk meat, and berries.  After two more days of traveling in the direction our friendly Indians pointed out, we ran out of food.  Fortunately a storm hit the area and threw a lot of fish up on the beach, which we roasted.
"Some Indians ran on ahead to alert the whites that the ones who used thunder and lightning to kill so many Indians down the coast were coming.  We met a bunch of settlers at the Umpqua River and eventually got to Scottsburg. 20 1 left my companions there to recuperate and, anxious to get back to Portland, I came on ahead."<br>
<br>
"Son, " the famous aging pioneer must have drawled, "I'm sure glad you made it.  I jUSt read in today's newspaper about you and the others being massacred down there.  Danged if you don't come knocking at my door! Here's a blanket and you just comfy down over there in that corner.<br>
<br>
"I'll see you in the morning." The veteran pioneer grabbed a kerosene lamp with his leathered fist and clumped off to the other room.  He muttered half to himself, "If that don't beat all.  Reminds me of when I was up on the Snake ... let's see, that was back in. . . ."<br>
<br>
John M. Kirkpatrick, whose story appears above, was born in 1825.  He died in 1910 and is buried in Central Point, Oregon.  William Tichenor died in 1887 and is buried at Port Orford.  Eagan settled in Portland and married, while Palmer went to Salem and opened a saloon.  Slater (Salter) was killed by Indians in 1866 on the Rogue River near the place where Hedden just barely escaped with his life in 1855 after a skirmish with the same Indians.<br>
<br>
The red shirted Russian, washed out of his burial place, was discovered by Tichenor and his party on their return.  Assuming it was the body of one of the original party, it was reburied and word was sent north of the massacre of the entire party.  He was never identified nor was his wrecked ship ever located.  The steamer Sea Gull wrecked on the north spit of Humboldt Bay January 25, 1852 and became a total loss.<br>

Robert M. Utley and Wilcomb E. Washburn, "The Bear River Battle," <B>American Heritage Library of Indian Wars.</B> Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1977. p. 194-195.<br>
<br>
James Henry Carleton and Patrick Edward Connor expressed the aggressive spirit of this new frontier army.  Carleton, a<br>
twenty-year veteran of the regular army, had fought Mexicans  and Apaches and attained the rank of major of dragoons when the governor of California appointed him colonel of the 1st California Infantry in 1861.<br>
<br>
An imperious, flint-eyed martinet with rocklike fixity of purpose, Carleton set off early in 1862 to lead his unit, which came to be known as the California Column, across the southwestern deserts to confront a Confederate force that was marching on New Mexico from Texas.  The judgment of a fellow officer, that Carleton's "unscrupulous ambition and exclusive selfishness had passed into a proverb, despite his acknowledged ability and apparent zeal," is not seriously exaggerated.<br>
<br>
As for Connor, after an enlisted hitch in the regular army and Mexican War service as a captain of the volunteers, he had settled in California.  There he was successful in business and politics and attained prominence in the state militia.<br>
<br>
In the summer of 1861 the governor appointed him colonel of the 3rd California Infantry, and under federal orders Connor marched off across the Sierra Nevada to patrol the mail road between Salt Lake City and California.  A fiery Irishman, he soon fell to quarreling with Mormon leaders, but he also impressed his superior as "a man of observation, undaunted firmness, and selfpossession under all circumstances."<br>
<br>
Connor earned this encomium after launching one of the most daring operations-and fighting one of the most ferocious battles-of the Indian wars.  The spread of Mormon settlement northward from Salt Lake City and a gold rush to Montana in 1862 had upset Chief Bear Hunter's Shoshones, provoking scattered incidents of violence.<br>
<br>
Early in 1863 Connor conceived a bold plan for a midwinter thrust at the offending chief, known to be camped on the Bear River about 140 miles north of the lake.  At the head of three hundred Californians he pushed through snow and temperatures that in a week left a fourth of his men with frozen feet.<br>
<br>
Bear Hunter knew of Connor's approach but resolved to stand and fight.  He counted about three hundred confident, well-armed warriors.  His village occupied a strong defensive position in a steep-sided ravine, which the Indians had further strengthened with rock and earthen parapets.  As ttie troops deployed for the attack on January 27, "one of the chiefs," reported a participant, "rode up and down in front of the ravine, brandishing his spear in the face
of the volunteers, and the warriors in front sang out: 'Fours right, fours left; come on you California sons of bitches!"'<br>
<br>
Elements of the attacking force succeeded in flanking the Indian position, and the two sides struggled desperately in the village.  The Indians, Connor wrote, "continued fighting with unyielding obstinacy, frequently engaging hand to hand with the troops until killed in their hiding places." Bear Hunter fell while preparing fresh ammunition.  After four hours of bitter fighting, the surviving Indians broke and fled.<br>
<br>
The casualties were heavy, heavier by far than in typical Indian combats: 21 soldiers dead and 46 wounded, 224 Indians dead and 164 women and children prisoners.  "Never will I forget the scene," recalled a soldier, "dead bodies everywhere." But another remembered mainly the terrible cold: "2 feet of snow on the ground nothing for fire but green willows which would burn about as well the snow oh! the groands of the frozen it seems to ring in my ears yet the poor feelows some lost their toes some a portion of their feet.  "<br>
<br>
The Battle of Bear River earned Connor a general's star, and he followed up the victory with characteristic energy.  By the autumn of 1863 he could report that "all routes of travel through Utah Territory to Nevada and California, and to the Beaver Head and Boise river gold mines, may now be used with safety.<br>

BATTLE OF THE BIG HOLE<br>
<br>
Leslie M. Scott, "The Battle of the Big Hole," <B>History of the Oregon Country.</B> Cambridge: Riverside Press, 1924, p. 104-109.<br>
<br>
The battle of the Big Hole, fought by General John Gibbon with the Nez Perce Indians in the Big Hole Valley, Montana, August 9, 1877, was the most important engagement of this, the last of our serious Indian wars.<br>
<br>
A brief review of this fight, which has just been published by G. 0. Shields, through the press of Rand, McNally and Company, Chicagos will be of interest to our readers, who have learned, by personal acquaintance, to esteem General Gibbon and the other officers of his command who were with him at the Battle of the Big Hole.<br>
<br>
The Nez Perce Indians once had their home in the Snake, Salmon and Clearwater valleys, in Washington, Oregon and Idaho.  By the treaty of 1868, signed by the head chiefs of the tribe, a part of the Nez Perce's reservation, which included the Wallowa  Valley, was relinquished to the United States.<br>
<br>
Chief Joseph, White Bird,' Looking Glass and other subchiefs, and several hundred warriors, repudiated this treaty, and refused to be bound by it, <B>claiming</B> the Wallowa Valley as the special home and inheritance of themselves and their people, and became known as the "Nontreaty Nez Perces."<br>
<br>
In May, 1877, Joseph and his band began to threaten the white settlers in the Wallowa Valley with violence, if they did not withdraw at once from his country.  General Howard, then <B>commanding</B> the department of the Columbia, told Joseph that he must leave the Wallowa Valley, which had been ceded to the whites, and must go on his reservation; that, in event of refusal he would be placed upon the reservation by military force.<br>
<br>
Joseph pretended to yield, and asked for thirty days to collect his people and horsm for removal to the reservation.  Before the thirty days had expired White Bird's band murdered a number of white men and women in the Wallowa Valley.  Captain David Perry, with two companies of cavalry, attacked White Bird June 17, 1877, but was seriously repulsed losing thirty-three men and one officer killed.<br>
Meanwhile more than twenty white men and women had been massacred at and near Mount Idaho, and a number of other women brutally outraged.<br>
<br>
General Howard took the field and had two severe battles with Nez Perce on the Clearwater River, in Idaho, July I and July 11-12, 1877.  The main body of the hostiles, numbering about four hundred warriors, then started for the buffalo country in Montana.  General
Howard sent a message to General Gibbon, then commanding the district of Montana, with headquarters at Fort Shaw, requesting him to intercept the hostiles.<br>
<br>
General Gibbon at once sent orders to Captain Charles C. Rawn commanding Fort Missoula, to head off the Indians, hold them, if possible, or turn them back.  Joseph sent messengers saying that, if he was allowed to pass peaceably through Bitter Root Valley to the buffalo country, he would not harm the settlers or their property.<br>
<br>
Rawn had but fifty soldiers and about one hundred citizens to oppose Joseph, but he refused the Indian a passage. Joseph made  a  show of attacking Rawn's position in front, and, under cover of ths attack, outwitted the troops, filing off by the flank and reaching and occupying Bitter Root Valley without interruption.<br>
<br>
Rawn pursued, found the Indians on a ridge in a body of timber, three miles above the mouth of the creek.  Rawn had but one hundred men to attack a strong position defended by four hundred wamors, as brave, intelligent, well armed and well led as any Indian that ever faced the white man in the field.<br>
<br>
Man for man, Joseph's <B>men</B> were at least the equal of the rank and file of the regular troops, and Captain Rawn, knowing it was madness to attack, decided to return to his post and await the reinforcements he knew were coming.  His retreat saved his command from destruction, and the Bitter Root country from devastation.<br>
<br>
General Gibbon was at Fort Missoula the afternoon of August 3, having marched one hundred and fifty miles, over a rough mountainous country, in seven days, and the next day started in pursuit of the Nez Perce's, with his command, which numbered seventeen officers and one hundred and forty <B>men</B>.<br>
<br>
The Indians moved slowly up the valley, not expecting immediate pursuit; they traded horses with the ranchmen and merchants and bought such other supplies as they needed, including guns and ammunition.  These avaxicious whites not only sold the Indians all the supplies they could while passing, but actually loaded wagons with meat and vegetables and followed the Indians through the valley, trading with them at every  step.<br>
<br>
These whites of Bitter Root Valley were paid for their goods in gold that was shined with the blood of the settlers massacred on the Clearwater and Camas prairies.<br>
<br>
General Gibbon pursued rapidly, marching thirty to thirty-five miles a day, and was joined by thirty-six citizens.  General Gibbon's advance of party mounted men, under Lieutenant James H. Bradley,' on August 8, found the Indians in camp at the mouth of<br>
Trail Creek, which flows into the Big Hole River, and concealed<br>
itself in the hills awaiting the arrival of Gibbon with the infantry.  
Gibbon pushed forward, leaving twenty men to guard his train, and regched Bradley's camp at sundown of the 8th.  His infantry had ninety rounds of ammunition to each man, and one day's rations.  General Gibbon marched, at about l0 30 p.m., for the Indian camp.<br>
<br>
The Indians outnumbered him three to one, were armed with breechloaders and repeating rifles and had plenty of ammunition and 2000 horses.  General Gibbon relied for success in his daring attack, upon the advantap of a surprise, and upon the fact that his officers were nearly all of the Civil War, and his men has seen years of hard service on the frontier and had fought in many an Indian campaign..<br>
<br>
Gibbon reached the <B>Indian </B>camp of eighty-nine lodges, on the south bank of Big Hole River, at 2 A.M. of August 9, and, at a distance of 150 yards, waited for daylight to attack the enemy.  The surprise was complete, but the Indians soon recovered, and, from a safe cover behind the river banks, opened a destructive fire.<br>
<br>
Captain William Logan  was killed; the Indian camp was captured and destroyed, but the Indims were not defeated.  Rallied by Joseph, Looking Glass and White Bird, they charged back into camp, and a desperate hand to hand, muzzle to breast fight took place.<br>
<br>
The Indian mounted sharpshooters opened, from long range, a deadly fire, wounding General Gibbon and Lieutenants Charles A. Woodruff and Charles A. Coolidge.<br>
<br>
General Gibbon fell back from the river bottom and ordered his command to push up the hill and take cover in the mouth of a gulch.  The troops obeyed, reached the timber and cleared it of twenty Indian sharpshooters, where the main body was joined by the band of  and volunteers, sent downstream against the camp under Lieutenant<br>
Bradley, who was killed early in the fight.<br>
<br>
The Indian squaws and boys fought like devils killing a number of the soldiers and being killed in return.  So desperate was the fight that officers fought shoulder to shoulder with the men.  General Gibbon used his rifle from the bluff upon the redskins, and Lieutenants Woodruff and Joshua W. Jacobs, Captains Richard Comba," Constant Williams, George L. Browning and James M. J. Sanno ised a Springfield rifle at every opportunity, as did Lieutenants Allen H. Jackson, George H. Wright, William L. English, John T. Van Orsdale, Edward E. Hardin and Francis Woodbridge.  Woodbridge, a mere boy, but a few months from West Point behaved like a veteran.<br>
<br>
The Indians reoccupied their camp, sent off their baggage and loose horses with the squaws and children, and followed General Gibbon's <B>command</B> to the timber and surrounded them.  Here Lieutenant English and Captain Williams were wounded.  The Indians captured the howitzer and 2000 rifle cartridges from a half-dozen officers and men that gallantly strove to bring it up from the rear to Gibbon's
aid.<br>
<br>
The men cut up and devoured Lieutenant Woodruff's horse, killed within their lines, and feasted on the raw flesh.  On the morning of August 10 a courier from General Howard announced the approach of twenty cavalrymen  and thirty Warm Spring Indians, and by sundown the wagon train arrived, bringing the provisions and blankets needed by the men.<br>
<br>
The Indians withdrew about eleven o'clock that night. Gibbon and his men had slept but two hours out of the last forty-eight.<br>
<br>
Gibbon lost twenty-nine killed and forty wounded, and two of the wounded died of their hurts, or sixty-nine killed and wounded out of a total of less than one hundred and eighty men.<br>
<br>
It was a brilliantt, desperate and heroic fight, and if Gibbon had behaved as recklessly as did Custer,' the Big HoIe would have only repeated the Little Big Horn  Three officers were killed and wounded; Lieutenant Woodruff was wounded three times and Lieutenant Coolidge twice.  The Indians lost eighty-nine killed and their wounded brought the total to two hundred and eight, or more than one-half their command.<br>

During August 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th our way is made through a rough wilderness, for the most part along what is called a "divide", or narrow and winding crest, where we find scarcely grass enough to keep our animals alive.  During the 4th, I am met by two messengers that I had sent ten days before from my camp at Croesdale's farm to Missoula.<br>
<br>
They bear me a message from Captain Rawn, Seventh Infantry, saying that the Indians had been permitted to pass through the Lo Lo Canyon, and were moving slowly up the Bitter Root Valley, and that Colonel Gibbon was expected at Missoula immediately.  This dispatch determines me to divide my command with the hope of forming junction with Gibbons, earlier than I could with the whole.<br>
<br>
August 5th, I march the cavalry 21 miles, camping after dark at another fork of the Clearwater, where there is not a particle of food for the animals.<br>
<br>
Before breakfasting the 6th, the command moves at dawn till grass is reached at Summit Prairie.  After grazing for a few hours, we push on to Hot Springs, where we met a messenger from Colonel Gibbon himself.  He had left Missoula the 4th and was in pursuit of the hostiles.  He wishes, if possible, I get to him a hundred cavalry.  The same night I dispatch two couriers to let Colonel Gibbon know that I am making the longest possible marches with my
cavalry, and will press it in person, bringing him two hundred instead of one.<br>
<br>
The 7th from Hot Springs, I send an aid-de-camp ahead to Missoula, to secure forage and other supplies, and have them meet us at the mouth of Lo Lo Fork of the Bitter Root, so that there shall be no delay in the march.  This day the trail is found to be even more trying to the animals than before, but we came at the end of 22 miles out of the timber and mountain trail into excellent grazing.<br>
<br>
August 8th, leaving camp at dawn, we soon reach Captain Rawn's fortifications, now vacant, in the Lo Lo Canyon, and are shown by a citizen where the Indians ascended the heights on his right and passed his flank without hinderance.  He had about 25 regular troops, with about two hundred volunteers.<br>
<br>
It seems that the Indians really negotiated their way by promising the citizens that they would do them no harm if permitted to pass by unmolested.  Captain Rawn thought it wiser, under the circumstances, to let them go than attempt a fight, which he feared would be disastrous.  The position was a very strong one, and it is regretted that the Indians could not have been met and driven back on me.<br>
<br>
It was with a hope of such result that I had sent dispatches in advance as soon as the Indians started upon the Lo Lo Trail.  In truth, I should have been in Missoula by the northern route in season had I not been detained by the reports of the return of the hostiles after they had started for Montana.  This day our supplies met us as provided, and we succeeded in making a march upon good roads of 34 miles.<br>
<br>
The 9th we proceeded up the Bitter Root Valley, making a little over 20 miles, the cavalry horses being too weak to go farther. We got word from some citizens returning regarding Gibbon's progress.  He had passed beyond Ross's Hole and was making rapidly in wagons for Big Hole Valley in close pursuit.<br>
<br>
The morning of the 1Oth, feeling very anxious to form a junction with Gibbon or communicate with him, I have twenty of the best horses picked out, five from each company, under command of Lieutenant Bacon, First Cavalry, and take this detachment with the Indian Scouts, 17 in number, as escort, and ride all day from 4 A.M., generally at a trot, making at sundown 53 miles, the last 16 miles was over the Rocky Mountain divide.<br>
<br>
Here I found myself from 15 to 18 miles from Col. Gibbon's position.  Seven volunteers who had left after his battle met us on the road just before we encamped, and have a fearful picture of matters at the front.  They report that Colonel Gibbon had been successful at first in yesterday's battle but that the enemy had rallied and driven him into a dangerous position, taking his artillery, cut off his supplies, and killed and wounded more than half his force, including all of his officers but one, and that he
was in distress, without blankets or food or a medical officer.<br>
<br>
I knew that men escaping from the field invariably exaggerate the horrors of a battle, and made due allowance on this account for their stories.  Yet I was intensely anxious for Gibbon's command till I came in sight of it, between nine and ten the next day. His wagons were near his fortified camp, his men were bathing and washing their clothes at the creek, and the horses grazing quietly in the bottom.  There was no sign of an enemy in the vicinity.  On reaching his position, which was on a wooded point just above the willow bottom, we found Colonel Gibbon himself, but all cheerful and confident as troops are wont to be who have remained in position and slept on the battle field.<br>
<br>
They had saved their supplies at the reserve camp, excepting about 2,000 rounds of ammunition captured while enroute to the front.  After his first successful assault at dawn on the 9th, Colonel Gibbon had withdrawn to this point, and had been very much annoyed by Indian sharpshooters posted in favorable positions above and beyond him, some of them being between him and his supply camp. When in this condition, the evening of the 9th, Sergeant Sutherland, Company B, First Cavalry, whom I had sent from Hot Springs, Lo Lo Trail, reached him and I reported I was coming.<br>
<br>
Colonel Gibbon said this gave them great encouragement and the men cheered.  Ahead of us, during the last 10 or 12 miles, the fresh moccasin tracks of an Indian Scout indicated that the hostiles were apprised of my approach so that though we were not permitted to participate in the battle, which evidently did the Indians much damage, yet our extraordinary marches and early approach were not lost, for the Indians had abandoned their apparent advantage and left Colonel Gibbon's position at eleven o'clock the night before our arrival.<br>
<br>
When I met the seven volunteers from Gibbon's battle, the evening of the 10th, a messenger was immediately dispatched who went back forty miles to order the cavalry forward.  A messenger from Colonel Gibbon's supply camp was sent me by Sergeant Sutherland, who taking another route, passed on by my camp without meeting me.  Major Mason, in charge, sends back to the Infantry, at least two marches away, to hasten forward,and moves on with the cavalry, coming up the afternoon of the 12th.  Colonel Gibbon had also sent a dispatch, begging that a medical officer be sent to him. This dispatch also passed me by enroute.<br>
<br>
Surgeon C.T. Alexander and Assistant Surgeon Fitzgerald being present with the cavalry, made the ride of 53 miles without rest, reaching Gibbon's camp ten hours before the command.  They were thanked by the Colonel for the prompt, effective, and generous aid which they rendered to more than 30 wounded officers and men.<br>

BATTLE OF BIG HOLE.<br>
<br>
Nelson C. Titus, "The Last Stand of the Nez Perces," <B>Washington Historical Quarterly.</B> VI (July, 1915)   p. 145-153. (Excerpts).<br>
<br>
The United States troops being alert in pursuit, Joseph soon found that all direct routes to Canada were cut off and, having fought and out maneuvered the United States soldiers in Idaho under General 0. 0. Howard, the Nez Perces were forced to go east through Lolo Pass into Montana.<br>
<br>
However when Joseph had gained his way by strategy through LoIo Pass, he notified the people of Stevensville and other points in the Bitter Root Valley, that he only wanted a way to peaceably migrate; that he would have a way; that if not attacked, he would not harm any of the residents or molest Property and that he would pay a fair price for all Supplies necessary to sustain his people on their arduous journey.  On the part of the Indians, this pledge was strictly kept.<br>
<br>
At Stevensville Joseph, learning that Mullan Pass, near Helena, was guarded by a strong force, went South up the Bitter Root Valley and over the continental divide into the Big Hole Basin, always about four days in advance of the pursuing troops under General 0. 0. Howard, but the following Q#ay after the departure of the Indians, a battalion of United States, cavalry, under Major Gibbon, came into Stevensville from the north, and was joined by a company of volunteer citizens, who eagerly went in hostile pursuit of their late guests, who had carefully observed their pledges in purchasing and paying in gold for supplies in passing through their country.<br>
<br>
Although surprised by a fierce cavalry charge on their camp in the Big Hole Basin just before break of day, the Nez Perces rallied and defeated this combined force under Major Gibbons in a desperate battle with frightful losses on both sides.<br>
<br>
Thirty-three soldiers were killed and sixty wounded. About one hundred Indians were killed in their camp, many squaws and children.  After burying their dead and taking away their wounded, the Indians, ignoring the defeated command of Gibbons, who helpless was camped on a bluff near the scene of the tragedy, pursued their way eastward over the lofty rugged mountains of the Yellowstone National Park, again turning northward, crossed the valleys of the Yellowstone and the Missouri, and late in September the wretched remnant of the former peaceable Nez Perce nation were
encamped in a little valley on the northwest slope of the Bear Paw Mountains engaged in drying buffalo meat.<br>
<br>
Knowing that General Howard's command was about six days behind them, the Indians here, as at Big Hole Basin, did not suspect an enemy near.<br>
<br>
As the events of that terrible journey over lofty mountains, plains and rivers have been carefully narrated by historians, it is the purpose of this article to tell briefly the tragic story of the last battle and final surrender as related by surviving participants.<br>
<br>
To account for the disastrous attack made on this position by cavalry and infantry, it is necessary to explain that the Nez Perce camp, about six acres in extent, was well chosen for defense.<br>
<br>
Intersected by coulees about five feet deep and protected on the south and west by low bluffs and a tortuous stream which at that season is a dry channel in fact, the south end of the camp bordered a rather steep bank about twenty-five feet high; to; the north the ground is broken but the banks are not so high.  However, a vigilant foe is near at hand, which the Nez Perces, only eighty miles from the Dominion line, must encounter on the morrow.<br>
<br>
During the night of September 29th Col.  N. A. Miles, led by a scout, Jack Mail, in command of a detachment of the United States Army, had made his way north along the eastern slope of the Bear Paw Mountains, passed the northern limit of that range, then turned southward in search of the camp of the unsuspecting Nez Perce.<br>
<br>
About 7:00 a. m., September 30th, the trail of the Nez Perce was discovered by Cheyenne scouts who, eagerly following. soon came upon the camp about six miles from where the trail was first discovered.  On reaching a low ridge between Peoples Creek and Snake Creek, Colonel Miles beheld to the southeast, the Indian herds, hundreds of horses, mules and cayuses, scattered over the hills, quietly grazing.  Also, the tops of the Indian tepees were just visible, about two thousand yards distant.<br>
<br>
The force under Colonel Miles consisted of three companies of the famous Seventh Cavalry, commanded respectively by Captain.Hale, Captain Moylan and Captain Godfrey; two companies of the Second Cavalry and three companies of mounted infantry.<br>
<br>

With slight reconnaissance, Colonel Miles ordered Captain Hale to form his battalion, (three companies of Seventh Cavalry) in battle line advance and charge direct the southern end of the camp.  Captain Tyler, with two companies of the Second Cavalry and thirty Cheyenne scouts, was ordered to approach the north part of the camp to prevent escape and to capture the pony herds.<br>
<br>
Colonel Miles approached the left with three companies of mounted infantry with pack trains.  All advan@ed about 9:00 a. m, The Seventh Cavalry trotted forward in  battle line and from Colonel Miles' column could be seen sweeping forward over the undulating prairie.<br>
<br>
In the depressions of the land they were out of sight; on the ascending  slopes of the succeeding ridges, the orderly columns reappear and roll over the crest and disappear.  Then at last near the lodges they are lost to the view of their anxious  comrades; for a few minutes the dreadful silence is unbroken; then a few scattered  shots are heard, followed by the terrible roar and din of musketry.  All are in suspense and press forward to learn the fate of the gallant men of the Seventh.<br>
<br>
Some minutes passed in awful uncertainty. when Lieutenant Eckerson. alone, covered with the blood from his wounds, rushed to Colonel Miles with the words, "I am the only d- man of the Seventh Cavalry who wears shoulder straps, alive." In fact, lieutenant Eckerson had seen every officer shot down, either killed or wounded.<br>
<br>
Colonel Miles immediately ordered the infantry to attack and the four pound howitzers to occupy the ridge northwest of the Indian camp.  One rider and two of the four mules were killed, the gun left pointing toward the attacking force until night, when it was stationed and defense built, but at daylight it was discovered not to command the Indian camp.<br>
<br>
Captain Tyler, in command of the Second Cavalry with the Cheyenne scout, during the battle succeeded, however in capturing the ponies, thereby cutting off all possibility of escape on the part of the Nez Perces.<br>
<br>
The Indian story of this attack will more clearly account for this bloody repulse of the Seventh Cavalry.  On this fateful September morning, the Indians were unconscious of any danger at hand; about 8:00 a.  m. a Nez Perce boy, who had gone out to secure his Pony, discovered the Cheyenne scouts and gave the alarm which caused every warrior to seize his rifle and choose a position with the purpose of repelling the attack of the enemy.<br>
<br>
Within thirty minutes some of the lodges had been struck, loaded
on about one hundred. ponies and with a large number of the women and children, accompanied by about sixty warriors, were rushed out at first attack.  Soon appeared the charging column of the Seventh Cavalry, officers boldly riding in front, not four hundred yards distant.<br>
<br>
The Indians from concealed positions withheld their fire until the front fine of cavalry was was one hundred yards of the steep bank which protected the southwest end of the Indian camp.  The momentum of the charge massed the trooper in confusion on the fatal brink of that line defended by accurate fire, at close range, of Indians concealed near the top of their natural defense.<br>
<br>
Within five minutes the charge of the cavalry had been repelled; the brave officers, Captain Hale and Lieutenant Biddle and fourteen troopers were left dead on the field in front of the Indian camp; nearly one-fifth of the attacking force were killed.<br>
<br>
Several of the wounded officers and troopers were left on the field until nightfall, but they were visited by the Indians, who after taking their arms and ammunition, supplied them with water and neither harmed the wounded nor in any way mutilated the dead.<br>
<br>
But returning to the story of the attacking force: About 1:00 P. M., all previous efforts having failed, Colonel Miles decided to make a concerted attack.  Troops A and D, having lost every officer in the first charge, were now placed under the command of Capt.  Henry Romney of the Fifth Infantry, and were ordered to attack the Indians on the southwest.<br>
<br>
At the signal to charge, the infantry, under Capt.  Simon Snyder, made every possible effort to reach the Indian lines, but owing to, the advantage of the strong defensive position and the deadly fire of the Indians, only one small Company I, under Lieutenant Mason Carter, with fourteen men, succeeded in crossing the coulee.<br>
<br>
Of these, five were killed outright; the others concealed themselves in the gullies until nightfall, when they rejoined their comrades.  In this attack Captain Henry Romeyn was desperately wounded.  All attacks proving futile, by 3:00 p. m. a siege was determined upon.<br>
<br>
Although Colonel Miles' command outnumbered the Indian warriors, the situation on October 1st was critical, for the reason that the camp of the renegade Sioux, under Sitting Bull, was just over the Canadian boundary, only eighty miles distant.<br>
<br>
Joseph was in fact hourly expecting relief from  that source, for
on the night of September 30th, he had despatched six of his most trusted warriors to go to the camp of Sitting Bull for aid.<br>
<br>
The terrible fate of the six Nez Perces sent out that night is a story of treachery: About daylight on the 30th, these six Indians went into a camp of the Assinniboines, who welcomed and flattered them, all unsuspecting danger.<br>
<br>
The treacherous Assinniboines suddenly fell upon and murdered their guests, solely for the sake of securing their fine rifles and other valuable accoutrements, not common in the wretched camp of the degenerate Assinniboines.<br>
<br>
The morning of the first of October was very cold, with six inches of snow.  There was not an Indian in sight; they had dug rifle pits during the night.  Colonel Miles held a conference with joseph, who offered to return to his old home in Oregon, but positively refused to surrender, and the skirmish was resumed.  Later in the day.<br>
<br>
Colonel Miles wishing to terminate the useless struggle, induced George Cavanaugh (Cayuse George) I a squaw man, to bring Chief joseph out for another conference.  Cayuse George approached stealthily and halloed for perhaps a half hour; finally a squaw came out to learn what he wanted.  Joseph later informed h*un through the same messenger that if he wanted to see him to go back to the tent of Colonel Miles and then come down the hill in front of the camp.<br>
<br>
For this service Lieutenant Jerome offered his famous black horse, which was accepted by "George, who rode into the Indian camp.  A few minutes later, the black horse, carrying both Joseph, under assurance of safe conduct, and Cayuse George, galloped  up  to  the tent of Colonel Miles.<br>
<br>
Terms of capitulation were soon arranged.  Then at last, not-
withstanding the promise of safe conduct, Joseph was retained in the camp of Colonel Miles.  Lieutenant Jerome, with Cayuse George, was sent to receive the surrender of the Indians.  Bobby Graham, a camp follower, also stole into the Indian camp.  At first the Indians stacked their guns, under the direction of Lieutenant Jerome; then Chief White Bird took up his gun, saying that if he gave up his gun, he gave up his life, as he had killed some settlers on the way.<br>
<br>
Other Indians asked for Joseph, then took back their guns.  Cayuse George rode the black horse back to the camp of Colonel Miles.  In the meanwhile, the Indians threw Bobby Graham ingloriously out of camp.  Lieutenant Jerome was held by the Indians.  It was afterward learned that the squaws put him into a rifle pit and carefully provided that he would receive no injury during the night.
The skirmish was actively renewed.  It is reported that Looking Glass, a noble, humane Young chief, was killed that night.  However, at this time many of the Young warriors, under the treacherous White Bird, had left camp and made their escape into Canada.  In the early morning of October 2nd an Indian came boldly up the hill into camp and inquired for Colonel Miles in excellent English; declined coffee, which was, offered, and stated that he had come to see Joseph.<br>
<br>
When he had been conducted to Joseph and learned that his chief was safe, he stated that they held Lieutenant Jerome, but were ready to exchange.  The exchange was effected between the whites and hostilities were renewed.<br>
<br>
However, on October 1st, the wagon train, with a twelve pound brass cannon, arrived under the command of Captain Brotherton of th, Fifth Infantry.  During the day of October 2nd, the fire of the gun Produced no effect and that evening Colonel Miles took the twelve Pounder across Snake Creek and planted it west of the Indian camp out of range of the Indian guns, and a strong force of both cavalry and infantry guarded it during the night. General Howard, whose army was distant about fifty miles south, arrived in Colonel Miles' camp on the evening of October 2nd with an escort of thirty men.<br>
<br>
On the morning of October 3rd, the twelve Pounder opened fire.  The first shell exploded on the ridge and inflicted no damage.  Colonel Miles observed the effect and said to the gunner, "Cut her a little shorter." The second shell exploded right in the center of the camp.  Lodge poles, Indians and dogs all seemed to be in the air.  The Indians showed willingness to surrender.  After much delay, the surrender was made that evening.<br>
<br>
Joseph, surrounded by his people started on foot, but on leaving camp, he mounted his Pony and rode direct to the headquarters.  Handing his carbine to Colonel Miles, he stated that he surrendered and would never again resist the authority of the United States.<br>
<br>
To account for the number of Indians, it is necessary to mention that on the first day of the battle, Lieutenant McClearnand, with G troop of the Second Cavalry, pursued for five miles and attacked the party which had left camp at first outbreak, but he was repulsed and driven back by the Indians, who rejoined Joseph that night.<br>
<br>
White Bird and his band who had committed depreciations on the way, escaped during the night of October 2nd and went over into the Canadian territory.  Joseph remained for the protection of his helpless followers.  
In this connection, the following statement of the numbers engaged, casualties and the Indians surrendered is given by Major Henry Romeyn, who in 1905 was living at Fort Meyer, Virginia.  Colonel Miles' entire command, including thirty Cheyenne scouts, was about 350; losses, killed, 2 officers and 22 enlisted men and 2 Cheyenne scouts; wounded, 5 officers, 38 enlisted men.  Nez Perces: 17 killed; 40 wounded; surrendered, 87 men, 184 women and 147 children.<br>
<br>
The latter were detained some months at Fort Keogh and were then conveyed to Indian Territory, where by death their number was reduced to 280 within seven years, when through the intercession of General Miles, they were removed to Colville Agency, Washington, in 1884.<br>

<br>
Colonel Gibbon with 150 troopers, including Rawn's detachment and 30 or so volunteers, were riding at twice the speed of the Nez Perce in hot pursuit.<br>
<br>
Gibbon's scouts located the Indians held up in a place called the Big Hole camp.  Most of the Indians thought their fighting days were over for a while, because they knew Howard was far behind but they were mistaken in thinking they had nothing to worry about with the people of Montana.<br>
<br>
Gibbon was able to advance his troops to within 500 feet of the unsuspecting Indians.  He deployed his troop in a formation which he believed would enable them to overrun the Nez Perce camp.  His plan worked to perfection except for one thing.<br>
<br>
Even though the Nez Perce were caught completely by surprise they were such fierce warriors they were able to stop the soldiers about two-thirds of the way through their camp and hold them to a stand still.  After fierce fighting, with both sides sustaining heavy losses, the soldiers abandoned the Nez Perce camp.<br>
<br>
They fell back and dug in under heavy Indian fire.  The Nez Perce held the soldiers in place all afternoon and into the night.  The Nez Perce, knowing reinforcements were coming, wearily departed.  They have suffered many losses and could feel no triumph in the
battle.<br>
<br>
This is the beginning of the end for the Nez Perce. Although the battle could be considered a victory for them.  They incurred their first heavy losses of the war (between 70 and 90 dead) and many of the remaining braves lost heart because of losses of their loved ones.<br>
<br>
It was a grim and far less confident cavalcade which a few days later re-crossed the Continental Divide to retreat southeasterly through Idaho toward Yellowstone Park.<br>
<br>
The Nez Perces by now must have known that their only chance was to reach Canada.  With this in mind they continued their journey, fighting a skirmish in Camas Meadows.  Continuing on through Yellowstone Park, they fought another skirmish in Canyon Creek.  By the way they discovered that not only would the Crow not help them, they were fighting with the soldiers against them, in exchange for all of the Nez Perce horses they could capture.<br>
<br>
After much hard traveling, the Nez Perce found themselves at Bear Paw only fifty miles from Canada.  Unfortunately the women and children were too tired to travel, so they must camp so close to their goal.  It would tum out to be the break the soldiers were looking for.<br>
<br>
Unknown by the Nez Perce, an army led by Colonel Miles, who was responding to Howard's umpteenth request for aid, had been in pursuit for several days and was closing in fast.  Early on the morning of September 30, a cold, overcast day, he came across the side swath of the Indian trail.  By 8 a.m. Cheyenne scouts had spotted the Nez Perce camp.'<br>
<br>
Miles ordered an immediate frontal attack by his battalion and a second battalion to come at Nez Perce from behind to try to capture their ponies.  Miles was certain the last days of the<br>
war were at hand.<br>
<br>
Once again the telegraph had helped the soldiers surprise the Nez Perce.  They knew Howard was far behind and were not aware of Miles and his soldiers.The only hint the Nez Perce had that Miles was coming was a cloud of dust they thought might have been a buffalo herd.<br>
<br>
On Sunday, September 30, the morning still was broken by Miles and his soldiers coming at the Nez Perce in a classic charge complete with drawn sabras and the yell of "charge!"
Upon coming over the last hill before the Indians, a shower of Nez Perce bullets made shambles of the picture perfect charge.  Troopers were sent flying off their horses as bullets found their mark.  The warriors were able to kill or wound four of the soldiers five officers (this was no accident).  A single lieutenant was left in command.<br>
<br>
60 or 70 Nez Perce warriors, held up behind cover, were able to inflict heavy losses on the soldiers.  About 60 of 115 men in the charge had been killed or wounded.  The Seventh had no choice but to withdraw.<br>
<br>
There was no rest for the Nez Perces, because now their herd was under attack.  Many of their warriors were caught without cover as they tried to save their horses.  Many, including Ollokot, Joseph's brother, and Toohoolhootzote were killed.  The bulk of the Nez Percc herd was driven off by the soldiers.<br>
<br>
Both sides dug in, neither side able to gain advantage.  Some of the Nez Perce escaped to Canada.  The Nez Perce, at last, realized that they were fighting much more then just General Howard.<br>
<br>
Miles, realizing that another attack would be too costly, hoped to entice the Nez Perces to surrender.  Miles sent out a white flag, hoping he could talk Joseph into surrendering.  Miles and Joseph met for the first time between the two lines.  They could not come to terms.  When Joseph turned to leave, Miles ordered his men to detain him.  The chief was led to the soldiers line.  The coup failed when Miles had to give him up because one of his officers was captured by the Nez Perce, and was exchanged for Chief Joseph.<br>
<br>
On the  night of October 4, Howard arrived with a small party.  The next day the Nez Perce learned of Howard's arrival and assumed he had all his men with him.  They knew an attack by the two forces would soon overwhelm them.  This news, along with the fact that many of the Nez Perce women and children were suffering, caused Chief Joseph to realize that he must surrender.<br>
<br>
Joseph and a few of his closest warriors met with Miles and Howard to discuss terms of the surrender.  The Indians were promised food, shelter, and decent treatment as prisoners of war, without trials or execution.  They were promised, a promise that was never kept, that they would be returned to the Lapwai Reservation in Idaho.<br>
<br>
It was late afternoon when Joseph rode out to formally surrender to Miles and Howard.  Chief Joseph gave up his rifle and uttered the words that still stand in history: "Hear me, my chiefs.  I am tired; my heart is sick and sad.  From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever."
It is important to note that nearly 700 Nez Perce had started from Idaho in June.  Their warriors, perhaps 150, had fought four pitched battles and numerous skirmished against several different commands totaling 1,400 troops and volunteers, supplemented by Indian scouts from 10 different tribes.  Of the whites, 109 had been killed and 1 15 wounded.  Under generally able leadership, the army had been out-marched and often outmaneuvered.  The government's direct expenses approached two million dollars.<br>
<br>
The Nez Perce were never able to return to their beloved Wallowa. After suffering many hardships they were allowed to live on the Colville Reservation in north central Washington.  It was a nice place somewhat similar to the Wallowas.  It was there that Chief Joseph, the greatest of the Nez Perce chiefs, died at the age of sixty-four.<br>

<br>
Brave old General Gibbon, the hero of South Mountain, was on the war-path.  On receipt of General Howard's despatch that the Nez Perces were coming his way, he hastily summoned Company F, of his regiment, from Fort Benton, and D. from Camp Baker to move with all possible speed to his post.<br>
<br>
Meantime, he gave orders that Company K and every man that could be spared from Fort Shaw should prepare at once for the field.  When Companies F and D arrived there, he took the field at their head, with the troops detailed from his own post, and moved rapidly toward Fort Missoula, crossing the Rocky Mountains through Cadotte's Pass, carrying a limited supply of provisions on pack-mules.  The distance, one hundred and fifty miles, over a rough mountainous country, was covered in seven days, the command reaching Fort Missoula on the afternoon of August 3rd.<br>
<br>
On the 4th, with his command reinforced with Captain Rawn's company, and Company G of the Seventh from Fort Ellis, General Gibbon left Fort Missoula in pursuit of the Nez Perces.  His command now
numbered seventeen officers and one hundred and forty-six men.  A wagon-train was taken from Missoula, wherein the men were allowed to ride wherever the roads were good.<br>
<br>
General Gibbon moved as rapidly as his means of transportation would permit, covering thirty to thirty five miles per day.  In his march through the valley he was joined by thirty-six citizens.  Gibbon ascertained that he was covering two of their dally marches with one of his, and the question of overtaking them became, therefore, merely one of time.<br>
<br>
When the command reached the foot of the mountains and learned that the Indians had already crossed, a number of the citizens became discouraged and hesitated about going farther.  But the General, appreciating the importance of keeping these hardy frontiersmen with <B>him, besought</B> them to keep on a few da s longer.<br>
<br>
He assured them that he was in earnest, and should strike the Indians a terrible blow as soon as he could overtake them.  He told the volunteers that they should have an honorable place in the fight, if one occurred; that they might have all the horses that could be captured, save enough to mount his command, and that,<br>
meantime, his men would divide their last ration with their citizen comrades.<br>
<br>
This announcement created great enthusiasm among the soldiers and volunteers alike, and the latter at once decided to follow their gallant leader until the Indians should be overtaken, no matter<br>
where or when that might be.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Bradley, with eight men of the Second Cavalry, and all of the mounted volunteers, was now ordered to push on, strike the Indian camp before daylight the next morning, if possible, stampede the stock and run it off.  If this could be done, and the Indians set on foot, then their overwhelming defeat would be certain.  Lieut.  J. W. Jacobs asked and obtained permission to go with Bradley and share in the hazardous undertaking.  This detachment, amounting all told, to sixty men, made a night march across the mountains, while the main command camped at the foot of the divide on the night of the 7th, and at five o'clock the next morning resumed the march.<br>
<br>
The road up the mountain, a steep and difficult one at best, was seriously obstructed at this time by large quantities of down timber that had to be cut out or passed around, so that the ascent was very slow and trying to men and beasts. The wagons were but lightly loaded, and bly doubling teams and using all the men at the drag ropes, the command succeeded in reaching the summit, a distance of three miles, in six hours, and by the performance of such labor<br>
and hardship as only those can realize who have campaigned in a
<br>
mountainous country.<br>
<br>
From the summit the road leads down a gentle incline for a mile, when it reaches the head of Trail Creek, and follows down that stream a distance of ten miles into the Big Hole basin.  It crosses the creek probably fifty times, and the banks being abrupt, and the road obstructed in many places by downed timber, the progress of the command was extremely slow and tedious.<br>
<br>
While ascending the mountain on the morning of the 8th, General Gibbon received a courier from Lieutenant Bradley, with a despatch stating that, owing to the difficult nature of the trail and the distance to the Indian camp, he had been unable to reach it before daylight, and that the Indians had broken camp and moved on.<br>
<br>
Later in the day, however, another courier brought news that they bad again gone into camp, after making but a short march, at the mouth of Trail Creek, and that, not deeming it safe to attack in daylight, Bradley had concealed his command in the hills, and was now awaiting the arrival of the infantry.<br>
<br>
Upon receipt of this information, Gibbon took his men from the wagons, leaving twenty men to guard the wagon train, gave each man ninety rounds of ammunition one day's rations, and pushed on on foot having ordered that the wagons should come up as fast as possible.<br>
<br>
The gallant General with his faithful little band moved quietly but rapidly forward, but owing to the bad condition of the trail, it was nearly sundown when they reached Bradley's camp.<br>
<br>
Bradley informed his chief that he believed the Indians intended to remain in their camp several days, for he had secretly observed their movements from the top of a hill,  and  found  that  the  squaws were engaged in cutting and peeling lodge-poles to take with them for use on the treeless plains of the buffalo country.<br>
<br>
On arriving at Bradley's camp, the men filed into the gulch, ate a scanty supper of hard-tack and raw pork, and without camp-fires or blankets, lay down to rest.  Having conferred with Lieutenant Bradley and his  scouts as to the best disposition of the proposed attack, General Gibbon ordered his adjutant to call him at ten o clock at night, and lying down under the spreading branches of a pine-tree, slept as peacefully as a child.<br>
<br>
Lieutenants Bradley and Jacobs did a piece of reconnoitering on this day for which they deserve great  credit.  Having failed to reach the Indian camp during the previous night, when it would have been safe to undertake to capture or stampede the pony herd; and knowing it would be rash to attempt in daylight then became important to learn the exact situation of the village, in order that the
commanding General might be given the most minute information concerning it when he came up.<br>
<br>
Having secreted his command in the woods, therefore, Bradley sent out scouts ]*n different directions with instructions to proceed cautiously and stealthily about the valley and ascertain, if practicable, the actual whereabouts of the Indians.<br>
<br>
In about two hours these men returned and reported numerous fresh signs of Indians in the immediate vicinity, while one of them, Corporal Drummond he said, had, standing in the timber some distance to the east, heard voices and other sounds that evidently came om a busy Indian camp near by, but, fearing he might give an alarm, he had not gone near enough to the camp to see it.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Jacobs asked Bradley to let him take Drummond, return to the spot and verify such important information.  Bradley replied that they would both go, and, leaving Sergeant . Wilson in charge of the camp, both officers started with Drummond on foot.<br>
<br>
They proceeded with the greatest caution a distance of about a mile and a half, when the corporal whispered to Lieutenant Bradley that they were near the place where he had heard the voices.  They were surrounded by a thick growth of small pine-trees, through which it was impossible to see to any distance.  Moving slowly forward, they soon heard the sound of axes, and <B>in</B>ferred that the squaws were cutting lodge-poles in the very body of the woods they were then in.<br>
<br>
Creeping along with bated breath, on the alert for every sound or sign, fearful lest they should make known their presence to the Indians, bring on a skirmish, and thus avert the purpose of the General, they scarcely dared breathe.<br>
<br>
They finally caught the sound of voices and stopped.  Here the officers held a whispered consultation which resulted in their crawling ahead to a larger tree that stood about eighty paces in front of them.  Still they could see nothing of the camp, although the sounds came plainer, and all were impressed with the knowledge they were treading on the very crest of a volcano, as it were.  Jacobs suggested that they climb the tree, arguing that as it was taller <B>than</B> those about it, they might be able to see something interesting, from its top.<br>
<br>
To this Bradley readily assented, and leaving their rifles with the corporal and cautioning him to keep a sharp lookout for any possible intruders, both officers climbed cautiously and stealthily into the topmost branches of the pine-tree.  When they had gained this position they halted for a moment in a crouching position and then
cautiously straightening themselves up, found that they were well above the surrounding foliage, and were thrilled at seeing hundreds of Indian horses quietly grazing <B>in </B>a prairie almost beneath them, for the tree stood on top of a high hill.<br>
<br>
Several herders sat on their ponies in and about the herd, while others lounged lazily on the ground under the shade of neighboring trees.  A few hundred yards beyond, they saw the Indian camp where hundreds of g and chatting, while squaws were warriors were resting<br>
pitching tents, making beds, carrying in poles, and cooking the noon-day meal.<br>
<br>
A brief look was all these brave officers dared risk, for they feared detection, and hastily lowering themselves to the ground, they lost no time in regaining their own camp.<br>
<br>
A brief despatch was sent off to the General, the receipt of which by him has already been referred to, advising him of their discovery, and the remainder of the day was spent in impatient awaiting his arrival.<br>
<br>
At ten o'clock at night the officer of the guard spoke to the General in a whisper, and he arose with the alacrity of a youth who goes forth to the sports of a holiday.  The men were called at once, and in whispered orders the line of march was speedily formed.  All were instructed to preserve the most profound silence from that moment until the signal should be given to open fire on the enemy, and, under the guidance of Joe Blodgett and Lieutenant Bradley, the little band filed silently down the winding trail, threading its way, now through dark groves of pine or fir; now through jungles of underbrush; now over rocky points; frequently wading the cold mountain brook, waist deep, and tramping through saw-grass;  speaking only in whispers; their rifles loaded, eyes peering into the starlit night, and ears strained to catch the slightest sound that might indicate the hiding-place of any lurking foe who might perchance be on an outpost to announce to his followers the approach of danger.<br>
<br>
Five miles were thus stealthily marched without giving an alarm.  Then the valley in which the troops had been moving opened out into what is known as the Big Hole, that is, the valley of the Big Hole River.  This is a beautiful prairie basin, fifteen miles wide, and sixty miles long, covered with rich bunch-grass and surrounded by high mountains.  In this valley the soldiers saw the smoldering camp-fires of the enemy; heard the baying of his hungry dogs responding to the howls of tie prowling coyotes, and saw, by the flickering lights, the smoky lodges of the warriors.<br>
<br>
The men crept up to within a few hundred yards of the slumbering
camp., when they again crossed the creek down which they had been marching, and ascended its eastern bluff.  Here they encountered a large herd of ponies, some of whom neighed anxiously as the strange apparition filed past them, but luckily did not stampede.<br>
<br>
Down the side of this steep bluff, thickly overgrown with sage-brush, mountain laurel and jack pines; over rocks and through break-neck ravines and washouts, the soldiers and citizens picked their way with all the skill and adroitness of trained hunters, until at last they reached a position overlooking the Indian camp, and within one hundred and fifty yards of the nearest tepees.<br>
<br>
The camp was pitched on the south bank of the Wisdom or Big Hole River, which is formed by the confluence here of Trail and Ruby Creeks.  It was <B>in </B>an open meadow, in a bend of the river, and was partially surrounded by dense thickets of willows. There were eighty-nine lodges pitched in the form of a V, with the angle up the stream, and below the camp four hundred or five hundred ponies grazed peacefully, tethered to stakes and willows.<br>
<br>
The Indians had evidently secured them there in order to be prepared, ready for any emergency.  The command halted here, and lay down to await the coming of daylight, but not to sleep.<br>
<br>
It was now two o'clock in the morning, and the men suffered with cold, for even the summer nights are cold in these mountains, and they had neither overcoats nor blankets, having left all these with the wagons.  The smoldering camp-fires flickered fitfully in the pale starlight, and the smoky lodges of the savages presented a most fantastic picture, as the dying lights blazed with ever-changing weirdness upon them.<br>
<br>
Eagerly the soldiers watched the scene, and with bated breath thought of the awful tragedy that  the  rising  sun  would  look  upon  in that now peaceful valley.<br>
<br>
Said   Bostwick, "They have no idea of our presence, the half-breed scout- "After a while you will see some fires built up if we remain undiscovered."<br>
<br>
Sure enough, in the course of an hour squaws began to come forth from their lodges, and replenish their waning fires.<br>
<br>
As these blazed up they stood about them, jabbered, turned, and warmed themselves, yawned, and then one by one returned to their skin couches and betook themselves again to sleep.  And again the soldiers and their citizen allies were left to meditate and in whispers commune with each other.<br>
<br>
As soon as it was light enough to see to move advantageously the little army was again astir; but its movements were yet as silent as
the grave.  Under whispered <B>orders </B>and with stealthy tread Sanno's and Comba's companies, deployed as skirmishers, descended the bluff into the valley groped their way through the willow thickets, waded the icy river, the water coming nearly to their armpits.<br>
<br>
Logan, Williams and Rawn, with their companies, were sent to the extreme right to cross and attack the camp near Ruby Creek while Lieutenant Bradley, with his handful of soldiers and citizen scouts, was sent down the stream with orders to cross and strike the camp lower down.<br>
<br>
As the light increased the troops were advancing cautiously, when an Indian, who had crawled out of his lodge and mounted a horse, rode out of the willows directly in front of Bradley's men and within a few feet of them.  He was en route to the pony herd on the hillside above, and so quietly had the advance been made that even he had not heard or seen the men, and was within a  few  feet  of  them  when  he  emerged  from  the thicket of willows.  He and his horse were instantly shot down.<br>
<br>
The order had been given:<br>
<br>
"When the first shot is fired charge the camp with the whole line."<br>
<br>
And most eagerly was this order obeyed.  Volleys were fired into the tepees, and with an eager yell the whole line swept wildly into the midst of the slumbering camp.  The surprise was complete.  The Indians rushed from their lodges panic-stricken by the suddenness and ferocity of the attack.<br>
<br>
They ran for the river-banks and thickets.  Squaws yelled, children screamed, dogs barked, horses neighed, snorted, and many of them broke their fetters and fled.<br>
<br>
Even the warriors, usually so stoical, and who always like to appear incapable of fear or excitement were, for the time being, wild and panic stricken like the rest.<br>
<br>
Some of them fled from the tents at first without their guns and had to return later, under a galling fire, and get them.  Some of those who had presence of mind enough left to seize their weapons were too badly frightened to use them at first and stampeded, like a flock of sheep, to the brush.<br>
<br>
The soldiers, although the scene was an intensely exciting one, were cool, self-reliant and shot to kill.  Many an Indian was cut down at such short range that his flesh and clothing were burned by the powder from their rifles.  Comba and Sanno first  struck  the  camp  at the apex of the V, and delivered a melting fire on the Indians as they poured from the tepees.  For a few minutes no effective <B>fire
</B>was returned, but soon the Indians recovered in a measure from their surprise and, getting into safe cover behind the river-banks, and in some cases in even the very bed of the stream, opened fire on the soldiers, who were now in the open ground, with terrible effect.<br>
<br>
The fire was especially destructive on the right or upper end of the line where the river made a short bend.  As Logan, with a valor equal to that of his illustrious namesake, swept forward, he and his men found themselves directly at the backs of the Indians hidden in this bend, who now turned and cut them down with fearful rapidity.<br>
<br>
It was here that the greatest slaughter of that day took place.  Logan himself fell, shot through the head, and at sight of their leader's corpse  his  men  were desperate.  Regardless of their own  safety they rushed to the river-bank and brained the savages in 'hand-to-hand encounters, both whites and Indians in some cases<br>
falling dead or wounded into the stream and being swept away by its current.<br>
<br>
In twenty minutes from the  time  the  first  shot  was fired the troops had complete possession of the camp, and orders were given to destroy it.  The torch was applied with a will, and some of the canvas lodges with the plunder in them destroyed, but the heavy dew had so dampened them that they burned slowly, and the destruction was not as complete as the men wished to make it.  Many of the lodges were made of skins, and these would not burn  at  all.<br>
<br>
Though the Indians were driven from their camp they were not yet defeated.  Joseph's voice and that of his lieutenants, White Bird and Looking Glass, were heard above the din of the battle, rallying their warriors and cheering them on to deeds of valor.<br>
"Why are we retreating, ?" shouted White Bird.<br>
<br>
"Since the world was made, brave men have fought for their women and children.  Shall we run into the mountains and let these white dogs kill our women and children before our eyes ? It is better that we should be killed fighting.  Now is our time to fight.  These soldiers cannot fight harder than the ones we defeated on Salmon River and White Bird Canyon- Fight! Shoot them down! We can shoot as well as any of these soldiers."<br>
<br>
Looking Glass was at the other end of the camp. His voice was heard calling out:<br>
<br>
"Wal-lit-ze! Tap-sis-il-pilp! Um-til-ilp-cown! This is battle! These men are not asleep as those you murdered in Idaho.  These soldiers mean battle.  You tried to break my promise at Lo-lo.  You wanted to fire at the fortified place.  Now is the time to show your courage and fight.  You can kill right and left.  I would rather see you
killed than the rest, for you commenced the war.  It was you who murdered the settlers in Idaho.  Now fight!"<br>
<br>
Thus praised and railed at by turns, the men recov<B>ered</B> their presence of mind and charged back into the camp.  The fighting was now muzzle to breast.  This deadly encounter lasted for some minutes more, when the Indians again took to the river-bank and delivered their fire with great precision and deadliness on the troops <B>in </B>open round.<br>
<br>
In the hottest of the fight, Tap-sis-il-pilp was killed.  Wal-lit-ze, upon being told of his companion's death, rushed madly upon a group of soldiers and was shot dead in his tracks.  Thus did two of the three murderers, who were said to have brought on the war, pay the penalty of their crimes with their own blood.<br>
<br>
The implied wish of their chief that they might be killed was realized.<br>
<br>
Before these two men were killed, so says a surviving Nez Perce, an almost hand-to-hand fight occurred between an officer and an Indian.<br>
<br>
The Indian was killed.  His sister saw him fall, and springing to his side, wrenched the still smoking revolver from his hand, leveled at the officer and shot him through the head.  The Indian who described the event did not know who the officer was, but every soldier in the Seventh Infantry knows and mourns the squaw's victim as the gallant Captain Logan.<br>
<br>
Another Indian, named "Grizzly Bear Youth," relates a hand-to-hand fight with a citizen volunteer in these words:<br>
<br>
"When I was following the soldiers through the brush, trying to kill as many of them as possible, a big, ugly ranchman turned around swearing and made for me.  He was either out of cartridges or afraid to take tune to load his needle gun, for he swung it over his head by the barrel and rushed at me to strike with the butt end.  I did the same.<br>
<br>
"We both struck at once and each received a blow on the head.  The volunteer's gun put a brand on <B>my forehead</B> that will be seen as long as I live.  My blow on his head made him fall on his back.  I jumped on him and tried to hold him down.  He was a powerful man.  He turned me and got on top.  He got his hand on my throat and commenced choking me.<br>
<br>
"All turned dark and I was nearly gone.  Just then a warrior came up.  This was Red Owl's son.  He ran up, put his gun to the volunteer's side and fired.  The ball passed through the man and killed him.  I had my arm around the waist of the man when the shot
was fired, and the ball, after going through the volunteer, broke my arm."<br>
<br>
Some of the Indians had, at the first alarm, mounted their horses, and rode rapidly to the hills on either side and to depressions in the open prairies of the valley.  From these positions, as well as from the thickets and river-banks, now came a most galling fire, which the soldiers were kept busy replying to.  Although much of this shooting was at long range <B>it </B>was very deadly, and at almost every crack of their-rifles a soldier, an officer, or a scout fell.  General Gibbon, Lieutenant Woodruff, and both their horses were wounded by these sharpshooters.<br>
<br>
Gibbon formed his troops in two lines back-to-back, and charged through the brush in opposite directions for the purpose of driving out the Indians who remained there, but they simply retreated farther into the jungle, ran by the flanks of the assaulting parties, and kept up their fire at short range.  In this part of the action Lieutenant Coolidge was shot through both thighs.  Lieutenant <B>Hardin </B>and Sergeant Rogan carried him into a sheltered spot near where the body of Captain Logan lay.<br>
<br>
By this time Coolidge had recovered from the shock <B>of his wounds</B> sufficiently to be able to walk, and, although weak from the loss of blood, picked up a rifle that had belonged to a fallen comrade and again took his place at the head of <B>his </B>company.  While in this  enfeebled condition he attempted to wade the river, but getting into water beyond his depth was compelled to throw away his rifle and swim.<br>
His failing strength now compelled him to seek shelter and lie down.<br>
It soon became evident to General Gibbon that it would be unwise to hold his position on the river bottom, where there was no adequate cover for his men, and he reluctantly ordered them to fall back up the hill and take cover in the mouth of a gulch since known as "Battle Gulch."<br>
<br>
They withdrew through the willow thickets to a position under the hill, gallantly carrying their wounded comrades with them, and then made a push for the timber.  It was held by about twenty of the<br>
Indian sharpshooters, who were killed or driven from it only at the muzzles of the soldiers' rifles.  On the approach of the troops these Indians took shelter in a shallow washout, not more than a foot deep and two or three feet wide.  Some of them were behind trees which stood beside this trench.<br>
<br>
One had a few large rocks piled about the roots of his tree, and from a loophole through these he picked off man after man, himself secure from the many shots aimed at him at short range by the soldiers.  Finally, however, a soldier, who was an expert marksman and cool as a veteran, took a careful aim and sent a bullet into
this loophole which struck the rock on one side, glanced and entered the Indian's eye, passing out at the back of his head - a veritable carom shot.  This tree was girdled with bullets, and the plucky Indian who lay behind it is said to have killed five of <B>the </B>soldiers before the fatal missile searched him <B>out.</B><br>
<br>
While the main body of troops were clearing out this clump of woods, the valiant band of regulars and volunteers, who had been sent down the river under Lieutenant Bradley to strike the lower end of the camp, now turned and fought their way up through it; through the willow thickets; through the sloughs and bayous; through the windings of the river; killing an Indian and losing a man at every turn, and finally consigned the command in the woods.<br>
<br>
But the gallant young leader of the band was not there.  He had fallen early in the fight; in fact, the first white man killed.  He was leading the left wing of the army <B>in its </B>assault on the camp.  General Gibbon had cautioned h*m to exercise great care going into the brush at that <B>point, </B>and told h@m to keep under cover of the brush and river-bank as much as possible, but the brave young man knew no fear and bade his men follow him.  One of them called to him just as he was entering a thicket where a party of Indians were believed to be lurking, and said:<br>
<br>
"Hold on, Lieutenant; don't go in there; it's sure death.  "<br>
<br>
But he pressed on, regardless of his own safety, and just as he reached the edge of the brush an indian raised up within a few feet of him and fired,, killing him instantly.<br>
<br>
The Indian was immediately riddled with bullets, and then the men charged madly into and through the brush, dealing death to every Indian who came in their way, and the blood of many a redskin crimsoned the sod, whose life counted against that of this gallant young officer.  Thus he, who had led the night march over the mountains; who had by day, with his comrade, crawled up, located and reconnoitered the Indian camp and sent the news of his discovery to his chief; who had on the following night aided that chief so signally in moving his command to the field and in planning the attack; who had gallantly led one wing of the little army in that fierce charge through the jungle and into the hostile camp, had laid down his noble life, and his comrades mourned him as a model officer, a good friend, a brave soldier.<br>
<br>
Soon after the assault was made on the camp a squad of mounted warriors was sent to round up the large herd of horses, some fifteen hundred in number, on the hillside, half a mile away, and drive them down,the river.  General Gibbon saw this movement and sent a small party of citizen scouts to turn the horses his way and drive the herders off.  A sharp skirmish ensued between the two parties, in
which several whites and Indians were wounded, but the Indians being mounted and the citizens on foot, the former succeeded in rounding up the herd and driving it down the river beyond the reach of Gibbon's men.<br>
<br>
During the progress of the fight among the tepees, the squaws and young boys seized the weapons of slain warriors and from their hiding places in the brush fought with the desperation of fiends.  Several instances are related by survivors of the fight, in which the she devils met soldiers or scouts face to face, and, thrusting their rifles almost into the faces of the white men, fired<br>
point blank at them.  Several of our men are  known to have been killed by the squaws, and several of the latter were shot down in retaliation by the enraged soldiers or citizens.<br>
<br>
A scout who was with Bradley states that, while they were fighting their way up through the willows, he passed three squaws who were hidden in a brush.  Knowing their bloodthirsty nature, and that several of his comrades had already been killed by them, he was tempted to kill them, but this class of enemy as they seemed to be unarmed and made no show of resistance, he spared them and passed on.<br>
<br>
Two days later, however, while out with a burial party, he found these same three squaws all dead in their hiding-place.  One of them now had a Henry rifle in her hands, and beside another lay a revolver with five empty shells iq the cylinder.  He thought they had recovered the weapons from slain bucks after he passed and, opening fire on some soldier or scout, had met the fate to which their conduct had justly subjected them.<br>
<br>
All through the fierce struggle on the river bottom, officers fought shoulder to shoulder with their men; some of them with their own rifles some with rifles recovered from killed or wounded comrades and some with revolvers.<br>
<br>
Even General Gibbon himself - who, by the way, <B>is </B>an expert rifle shot - from his position on the bluff, devoted all his spare moments to using his hunting-rifle on the skulking redskins, and more than one of them is said to have fallen victim to his deadly aim.<br>
Lieut.  C. A. Woodruff, his adjutant, dealt shot after shot into the foe, as he rode from point to pont, carrying the orders of his chief.  Captains Comba, Williams, Browning, and Sanno used their Springfields with telling effect and put many a bullet where it would do the most good.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Jacobs was as swift as an eagle in search of his prey, ana, with a revolver in each hand, dashed hither and thither hunting out the murderers from their hiding-places and shooting them down <B>like</B> dogs.
<B><br>
</B>Lieutenants Jackson, Wright, English, Van Orsdale, Harden, and Woodbridge were all at their posts and none of them lost an opportunity to put in a telling shot.  Lieut.  Francis Woodbridge was the youngest officer in the command, then a mere boy but a few months from West Point, yet he was as coot as any of the veterans and displayed soldierly qualities that endeared him to every one who participated in that day's work.<br>
<br>
Captain Rawn was at all times in the thickest of the fight, and was admired alike by officers and men for the alacrity with which he shared in every danger.  His conduct in that fight gave the lie to the carpers who had accused him of cowardice in the affair in Lo-lo Canon.  In short, every officer, every enlisted man, and every citizen volunteer, fought as though the responsibility of the battle rested solely with him, and all acquitted themselves most nobly.<br>
<br>
As soon as the command abandoned the camp, the Indians reoccupied it, and under the fire of the sharpshooters, hauled down several of their tepees; hastily bundled together the greater portion of their plunder; packed a number of horses with <B>it, </B>and, mounting their riding ponies, the squaws and children beat a hasty retreat down the valley,, driving the herd of loose horses with them.  They had  worked breaking camp, and several of them and their horses were killed while thus engaged.  Two of Joseph's wives and a daughter of Looking Glass were among the slain, who were believed <B>to </B>have been killed at this time.<br>
<br>
When the command retired into the timber, the Indians followed and surrounded them, taking cover along the river-banks below, and behind rocks and trees on the hillsides above.  The men dug, rifle-pits with their trowel bayonets and plied up rocks to protect themselves as <B>they </B>could, and a sharpshooting fight was kept up from this position all day.<br>
<br>
At times the Indians' fire was close and destructive, and here Lieutenant English received a mortal wound.  Captain Williams was struck a second time, and a number of men killed and wounded.<br>
Two large pine-trees stand on the open hillside some four hundred yards from the mouth of the gulch.<br>
<br>
Behind one of these an Indian took cover early in the morning, and stayed there until late in the afternoon.  He proved to be an excellent long-range shot, and harassed the troops sorely by his fire until a soldier, who had crawled up the gulch some distance above the main body, and who was equally expert in the use of his rifle, got a cross-fire on him and finally drove him out.<br>
<br>
He went down the hill on a run and took refuge in the willows, but with one arm dangling at his side in a way that left no doubt in the minds of those who saw him that it was broken.
A large number of Indians crawled up as close to the troops as they dared, and the voices of the leaders could be heard urging their companions to push on.  A half breed in the camp, familiar with the Nez Perce tongue, heard White Bird encouraging his men and urging them to charge, assuring them that the white soldiers' ammunition was nearly gone.  But he was unable to raise their courage to the desired point, and no assault was made.<br>
<br>
The troops held their ground nobly, wasting no ammunition, and yet returning the fire of the savages with coolness, accuracy, and regularity; and from the number of dead Indians and pools of blood found on the hillside the next day, learned that their work here had not been in vain.<br>
<br>
During the afternoon of the 8th the wagon-train and howitzer had been brought down to within five miles of the Indian camp, parked, and fortified by Hugh Kirkendell, the citizen wagon master in charge, aided by few men who had been left with him as train-guard.<br>
<br>
An amusing incident occurred that night, and yet one that came near costing Kirkendall his life.  Among the men left with the train was William Woodcock, Lieutenant Jacob's servant.  He was armed with a double barreled shot-gun and ordered to take his turn on guard.<br>
<br>
During the still hours of the night the wagon master was making the "rounds" to see if the men were on the alert.  As he approached William's post the latter called out to him to halt; and without waiting to learn whether his challenge had been heeded, blazed away at the <B>in</B>truder, whom he took to be a prowling redskin.  The charge of buck-shot tore <B>tip </B>the ground and cut down the brush about the wagon master, but fortunately none of them hit him.<br>
<br>
William showed himself to be -a vigilant sentry, but a poor shot, and it is supposed that he <B>will</B> never hear the last of "Who goes there? -bang!" while there is a survivor of the expedition.<br>
<br>
At daylight on the morning of the 9th three noncommissioned officers and three men started to the front with the howitzer under the direction of Joe Blodgett, the scout.  They succeeded in getting it up to within half a mile of the scene of action a little after sunrise.  They took it across Trail Creek and up on the bluff, where they were in the act of putting it in position to open fire, when a body of about thirty mounted Indians saw it, and ascertaining that only a few men were with <B>it </B>charged with the intention of capturing it.<br>
<br>
Two of the soldiers who were <B>with </B>the piece became panic stricken and fled when they saw the Indians coming, and did not stop <B>until </B>they reached the settlement a hundred miles away, where they spread
the news that Gibbon's whole command had been captured and mass-
<B>acred. So far as is known, this is the </B>only instance in which cowardice was shown by any man in the command.<br>
<br>
The remaining four men stood bravely by the gun, however, loaded and fired it twice at the assaulting party, and then, as the Indians closed around it, used their rifles on them.  When they saw that they could not successfully defend the piece, they threw it off the trunnion and retreated.  Corporal Sayles was killed and Sergeants Daily and Fredericks wounded at their posts.  The horses that were hauling the piece were both shot down.<br>
<br>
Private Bennett, the driver, was caught under one of them in its fall, and pretended to be dead until the Indians withdrew, when he took out his knife, cut the harness, and then prodding the animal, which was still alive, made it move sufficiently to release him, and he retreated and reached the wagon-train, where Sergeants Daily and Fredericks also arrived later in the day.<br>
<br>
The Indians, finding the howitzer useless to themselves, took the wheels off the trunnion, hid them in the brush, and, taking a pack-mule that had been brought up with the howitzer and which was loaded with two thousand rifle cartridges, returned to their camp.<br>
<br>
The loss of the cannon was a serious blow to the command, for, could it have been gotten into position and held, it could have done excellent service in shelling the Indians out of their strong holds, whence they so annoyed the troops.  The piece could not consistently have been more strongly guarded, however, than it was, for every available man was needed in the assault on the camp.  The loss of the two thousand rounds of rifle cartridges also weakened the command seriously, for it compelled the men to reserve their fire all day, <B>in</B> order to make the supply taken into the action with them hold out.<br>
<br>
Had this extra supply reached them, <B>they could have killed many more Indians d</B> <B>the</B> day than they did.<br>
<br>
Meantime the fight continued to rage at the mouth of the gulch, with varying fortunes and misfortunes on either side.  Late in the afternoon a smoke was seen rising from beyond the brow of the hill below Gibbon's position, and the cry went forth that the Indians had fired the grass.  A wind was blowing the fire directly toward the beleaguered band, and all were greatly alarmed.<br>
<br>
The General had feared that the Indians would resort to this measure, for he knew it to be a part of the Nez Perces' war tactics, and he believed that they intended to follow up the fire and assault his men while blinded by the smoke.  Yet he was not dismayed.  He urged his men to stand firm in the face of this new danger.
"If the worst comes, my men," said he, "if this fire reaches us, we will charge through it, meet the redskins in the open ground, and send them to a hotter place than they have prepared for us.  "<br>
<br>
The fire burned fiercely until within a few yards of the entrenchments, and the men were blinded and nearly suffocated by the smoke.  But again the fortunes of w@r were with the beleaguered band, for just before the fire reached them the wind shifted squarely about, came down off the hills from the west, and the fire, blot,,n back upon its own blackened embers, faltered, and died out.<br>
<br>
At this lucky turn in their fortunes the soldiers cheered wildly, and the Indians cursed savagely.<br>
<br>
The men had !eft the wagons in the forenoon of the previous day with one day's rations, but in the charge across the river many of their haversacks had been filled with water, and the scant supply of food that remained in them was destroyed.  Others, more fortunate <B>hid divided up</B> few remaining crackers with their comrades who were thus deprived, so that all were now without provisions and suffering from hunger.<br>
<br>
The gulch in which they had taken cover was dry and rocky, and as the August sun poured his scorching rays upon the men they suffered for water.  True, the river flowed within a few hundred yards of them, but the man who attempted to reach it did so at the risk of his life, and there were no more lives to spare.  Not until nightfall did the commanding officer deem it prudent to send out a fatigue party for water.<br>
<br>
Then three men volunteered to go, and under cover of darkness, and of a firing party, they made the trip safely, filling and bringing in as many canteens as they could carry.<br>
<br>
The men cut up Lieutenant Woodruff's horse (which the Indians had conveniently killed within the lines), and as they dared not make camp-fires, devoured full rations of him raw.  The night was cold, and again the men suffered greatly for bedding.  The Indians kept firing into the woods occasionally, even after dark, so that the soldiers were unable to rest.  Once or twice they charged up almost to Gibbon's lines and delivered volleys on the men, but were speedily repulsed in each case by a fusillade from the entrenchments.<br>
<br>
General Gibbon had heard nothing from his wagon train since leaving it, and the fact that mounted parties of Indians were frequently seen passing in his rear made it extremely dangerous to attempt to pass to or from it.  Indeed he feared the train had been captured,
for it was but lightly guarded, and during the night he started a runner to Deer Lodge for medical assistance and supplies.<br>
<br>
This man, W. H. Edwards by name, succeeded in making his way out through the Indian lines under cover of darkness, and walked or ran to Frenche's Gulch, a distance of nearly sixty miles, where he got a horse, and made the remaining forty miles during the following night, arriving at Deer Lodge on the morning of August 11th.<br>
<br>
On the morning of the 10th a courier arrived from General Howard, informing Gibbon that he (Howard) was hurrying to his assistance with twenty cavalry men and thirty Warm Spring Indians.  On being questioned as to the supply-train, this courier reported that he had seen nothing of it, which statement greatly increased the fear of the men that it had been captured and destroyed.<br>
<br>
Later in the day, however, a messenger arrived from the train, bringing the cheering news that it was safe.  The Indians had menaced it all day, but the guard in charge of it had fortified their position and fired upon the savages whenever they came in sight with such telling effect that the latter had made no determined attack.  Howard's messenger had passed the train in the night without seeing it.<br>
<br>
Early on the morning of the 10th Serg.  Mildon H. Wilson, of Company K, with six men was sent back to bring up the train, and later in the day Captain Browning and Lieutenant Woodbridge, with twenty men, all of whom had volunteered for the service, were sent to take charge of it.  They met the train on the way in charge of Sergeant Wilson, and with it succeeded in reaching the command just at sundown, bringing the blankets and provisions so much needed by the men.<br>
<br>
This detachment performed a hazardous and meritorious piece of work in thus rescuing and bringing up the train, for large parties of Indians were still scouting through the woods and hills watching for opportunities to cut off any small body of troops who might be found<br>
away main command and with whom they might successfully contend.<br>
<br>
In the face of this danger, Browning and Woodbridge, with their few supporters, marched nearly ten miles through the swampy, brush-lined ravine, and succeeded in moving the train over roads that were well-
nigh impassable under the most favorable circumstances.  The wagons had to be literally carried over some of the worst places, the mules having all they could do to get through without pulling a pound.<br>
<br>
As soon as the train had been safely delivered to the command, General Gibbon asked for a volunteer messenger to go to Deer Lodge
with additional despatches, fearing that Edwards might have been killed or captured en route, and Sergeant Wilson, the hero of so many brave deeds, promptly volunteered for this perilous service.  He started at once, rode all night, and reached his destination only a few hours behind Edwards.<br>
<br>
The last party of Indians withdrew about eleven o clock on the night of the 10th, giving the soldiers a parting shower of bullets, but it was not known <B>until</B> daylight on the morning of the <B>11th </B>that all had really gone.<br>
<br>
From the time the last shots were fired, as stated, all was quiet, and the men got a few hours of much-needed rest, such as it was, for they had slept but two hours <B>in</B> the past forty-eight.  The fight was over; the enemy was gone.  The sun that rose on the morning of the <B>11th</B> shone brightly over as beautiful a valley as the eye of man ever beheld, and the blackening corpses that lay strewn upon the field were the only remaining evidences of the bloody tragedy that had so lately been enacted there.<br>

<br>
Colonel Gibbon and his men crept through the brush until they were within 150 yards of the Nez Perce encampment. It was two o'clock on the morning of August 9. The soldiers listened to the occasional barking of village dogs and watched the flickering Indian camp fires as they settled down to await Gibbon's order to attack at dawn.<br>
<br>
Waiting proved to be a difficult task for Gibbon's troops. Lying on the hard ground without blankets, they were chilled by the cold mountain air.  They were forced to remain very still lest they be discovered and ruin their chance for a successful surprise attack.<br>
<br>
Shortly after the soldiers had taken their position near the camp, several Indian women emerged from their lodges. The white men remained quiet almost fearing to breathe as the women threw fresh fuel on the camp fires and engaged in a brief conversation.<br>
<br>
Much to the relief of [Colonel John] Gibbon's men, the chill air soon forced these early risers to return to the warmth of the
blankets inside their tepees.<br>
<br>
About 3:00 another woman stepped outside and went to fetch water from the river. Once again the soldiers feared discovery. This time, however, the mounting tension caused one man to shift his position<br>
and make a slight rustling sound in the brush.  The noise was immediately noticed by the Indian woman who turned and ran back inside to tell her husband.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for the Nez Perces, the drowsy warrior dismissed his wife's concern and told her to go back to sleep.  The nontreaties had ignored their last warning of the disaster that was about to<br>
befall them.<br>
<br>
As dawn approached, the soldiers arranged themselves in a line of battle and began their advance on the sleeping village.  As they neared the river, an old Nez Perce man riding a horse suddenly appeared before them.  The man's name was Natalekin and he was on his way to check on the grazing herd of Indian ponies.  Gibbon's men were startled by Natalekin's presence, but they recovered in time to shoot both the horse and its rider before the Indian could shout the alarm.<br>
<br>
As Natalekin fell dead from his horse, Colonel Gibbon launched his attack on the Nez Perces.  The soldiers waded waist-deep through the river and came out firing upon the village.  Roused abruptly from their peaceful slumber, the Indians ran screaming from their lodges as bullets rained down upon them.<br>
<br>
The soldiers were not interested in taking prisoners.  They began shooting and clubbing their way through the encampment.  Some deliberately shot women and children as the terrified people fled from their attackers.<br>
<br>
When the rifle fire began, Wahlitis and his wife were asleep in their tepee.  Wahlitis was the young warrior who had helped start the war by avenging the death of his father, Eagle Robe.  Startled by the explosions, the young couple hurried outside to find their village in total chaos.  Wahlitis seized his gun and took cover with his wife behind a fallen tree where he began firing at the soldiers.  Colonel Gibbon's men fired back and Wahlitis' wife was wounded.<br>
<br>
Seeing the fear and pain on the young woman's face) Wahlitis was reminded of all the suffering he and his people had endured because of the white men.  Filled with anger and hatred, he rose uP to take careful aim at his enemies.  At that moment, he was spotted by Captain William Logan, who immediately opened fire and killed him instantly.<br>
<br>
Despite her wound, Wahlitis, wife managed to get her husband's gun and kill Captain Logan.  Seconds later, the soldiers opened fire on the woman.  Her lifeless body fell across that of her dead husband.  So was forged the final link in Wahlitis, chain of vengeance.
Heavy fighting continued as the desperate Nez Perces attempted to rally their forces and defend themselves.  White Bird pleaded with his warriors to hold their ground.  Above the din of battle he shouted:<br>
<br>
"Why are we retreating?. .. Shall we run into the mountains and let these white dogs kill our women and children before our eyes? It is better that we should be killed fighting.  Now is our time to fight.... Fight! Shoot them down! We can shoot as well as any of these soldiers."<br>
<br>
Many of the warriors had taken cover along the riverbank where they found protection among a thick stand of willow trees and dense clumps of brush.  Frantically they called upon the magic powers of their Wyakins and sought to gain the strength to repel their enemies.<br>
<br>
Gibbon's men now attempted to set fire to the village.  The tepees, wet with frost, at first resisted the flames.  However, the soldiers persisted and were finally able to ignite them. Tongues of fire consumed the lodges and sent thick smoke billowing through the devestated campsite.<br>
<br>
Time and again Joseph entered this nightmarish scene in his attempt to rescue the helpless women, children, and old people.  Unarmed, the chief darted in and out among the burning lodges searching for those who were hurt or lost in the deadly confusion of battle.  Joseph's wife had been wounded.  However, despite his desire to remain at her side, he drove himself to attend to his duties as peace chief.  The welfare of his people must come first.  The Nez Perce tribe must survive!<br>
<br>
Gradually the warriors recovered from the shock of Gibbon's assault.  They began to listen to their leaders and unify their efforts for defense.  From their hiding places along the riverbank, they began firing at the soldiers in the village.  The Nez Perce counterattack soon became strong enough to throw Gibbon's men into confusion.<br>
<br>
The colonel was wounded in the leg and his horse was shot from under him.  Sensing the growing panic of his troops, Gibbon ordered them to leave the village and retreat to the safety of a nearby hillside.<br>
By 8:00 a.m., the soldiers had reached the wooded slope and begun to dig entrenchments behind fallen trees and boulders.  The battle had reversed itself and the Nez Perces had gained the upper hand.  The warriors rounded up their horses and herded them down river away from the danger.  The Indians reoccupied the village and began to lay siege to Gibbon's men.<br>

On his way through the smoldering campsite, the great warrior, Two Moons, discovered the body of his best friend, Rainbow.  A wise man and fierce warrior whose advice was often sought in council, Rainbow had predicted his own death.  Some time before the attack at Big Hole he had said:<br>
<br>
"I have the promise given that in any battle I engage in after sunrise, I shall not be killed.  I can face the point of the gun.  My body no thicker than a hair, the enemies can never hit me, but if I have any battle or fighting before sunrise, I shall be killed."<br>
<br>
Rainbow had died early in the battle before the sun was fully up.<br>
Two  Moons  wept  over  the  body  of  his  friend  and   said:<br>
<br>
"My brother has passed away.  I too will now go. . . and I shall lie beside my brother warmate.  He is no more, and I shall see that I follow him."<br>
<br>
Two Moons did indeed follow Rainbow in death.  Shortly after the nontreaties reoccupied their village, the griefstricken warrior made a solitary charge on the soldiers' entrenchments.  Under a hail of bullets, Two Moons willingly gave his life on the Big Hole battlefield.<br>
<br>
The Nez Perce campsite was filled with sorrow as tribal members returned and located the bodies of their families and loved ones scattered about the area.  Colonel Gibbon later wrote, "Few of us will soon forget the wail of mingled grief, rage, and horror which came from the camp ... when the Indians recognized their slaughtered warriors, women, and children"<br>
<br>
The Nez Perces were determined to flee from the valley as quickly as possible.  The warriors kept Colonel Gibbon and his men pinned down behind their barricades while Joseph and White Bird supervised the removal of the camp.  Some of the Indians hurried to bury their dead as others frantically began tearing down tepees which had not been destroyed in the attack.  Many things had to be left behind.<br>
<br>
By noon the main body of Nez Perces were <B>headed </B>south leaving clothing, buffalo robes, food, and many personal possessions scattered about in the charred remains of their former campsite.<br>
While their families escaped with the wounded, the warriors fired steadily at Colonel Gibbon and his troops.  Toohoolhoolzote and Ollokot led a group of sixty skilled marksmen to contain the soldiers until the Nez Perces had left the valley.<br>
<br>
Looking Glass also participated in the attack even though he no longer held much power as a leader.  The Nez Perces held him responsible for their present situation.  They believed his decision to travel slowly had allowed Colonel Gibbon to overtake them.  Looking Glass was now in disgrace and unable to command the respect
of his people as their war chief.<br>
<br>
At noon, the Indians discovered a group of six soldiers transporting Gibbon's howitzer and a supply of ammunition to the besieged troops.  Thirty warriors rode out to intercept the dangerous weapon before it could reach its destination.  The tiny group of soldiers managed to fire the howitzer twice before the hostiles were upon them.  The Indians killed one soldier and wounded two others in their charge.<br>
<br>
The surviving white men fled from the area leaving the cannon and 2,000 rifle cartridges in the possession of the Nez Perces.  Peopeo Tholekt wanted to use the howitzer against Colonel Gibbon and his men.  However, when the Indians attempted to move the weapon, its wheels became stuck and they were unable to take it with them.  Peopeo Tholekt then decided to dismantle the howitzer to prevent- the soldiers from recovering it.  The Indians tore the barrel from the weapon and Poker Joe rolled it over a bluff into some bushes.  Then, with the rifle ammunition from the supply train, the warriors hurried to rejoin their people.<br>
<br>
The attack on Colonel Gibbon continued all day.  The troops, weakened by lack of food and water, fought to maintain their rapidly weakening position against the strength of the Nez Perce sharpshooters.  Toward evening' the Indians decided to drive their enemies into the open with fire as Gibbon had recently done in the attack on their village.<br>
<br>
The warriors set fire to the tall, dry grass and soon hot flames were licking up the hillside toward the soldiers' barricades.  Clouds of smoke engulfed the area making it difficult to see or breathe.  Miraculously, when the fire was only yards away from the white men, the wind changed direction sending the blaze back over the blackened ground behind it where the flames soon expired from lack of fuel.<br>
<br>
During the night, most of the Nez Perce warriors withdrew to follow after their families. Ollokot and a dozen  marksmen remained to keep the soldiers from pursuing their people.  These Indians repeatedly fired their rifles into the darkness to remind Gibbon's men they were still under siege.  The white men spent a cold, uncomfortable night huddled behind their barricades.  They had no blankets and were afraid that fires would make them easy targets for enemy sharpshooters.<br>
<br>
In the early morning of August 10, a messenger arrived from General Howard.  This man said that the general was 4 4 coming on, as fast as possible by forced marches, with 200 cavalrymen, to give the needed reinforcement." The news was welcomed by the soldiers.  They
faced their attackers with renewed courage until noon when Ollokot decided it was time to rejoin his people.  After a final salute of riflefire, Joseph's brother and his warriors withdrew leaving Gibbon's men to count their casualties and attend to their wounded.<br>
<br>
The Battle of Big Hole ended with neither side able to claim a decisive victory.  Colonel Gibbon's plan of surprise had succeeded at the extremely high price of thirty-one men killed and thirty-eight men wounded.  Seven of the seventeen officers involved were among the casualties.  The Nez Perces had managed to turn the tide of battle and escape.  Yet, they too had suffered great loses.  Between sixty and ninety Indians lay dead.<br>
<br>
Most of them were women and children.  Twelve of the best warriors had been slain and others would later die from their injuries.  The surviving nontreaties were led with scorn and hatred for the white soldiers who had ruthlessly slaughtered their women and children.  Joseph later said, "The Nez Perces never make war on women and children; we could have killed a great many ... while the war lasted, but we would feel ashamed to do so cowardly an act."<br>

BATTLE OF BIG HOLE.<br>
<br>

<br>
The assignment of finding out exactly where the Indians were fell to Lieutenant James H. Bradley.  Guided by a local rancher, Bradley rode all one night through the forested mountains.  With him were thirty regular cavalrymen and about the same number of volunteers who had recently attached themselves to the column, perhaps out of patriotism but more probably out of a lust for Indian horses and gold dust to be plundered from the battlefield.<br>
At dawn they concealed themselves in an opening in the trees while the lieutenant and two enlisted men crept forward to see what they could see.  By climbing a tall pine, they spotted the unguarded camp, took careful note of its layout, and triumphantly sent the information back to their colonel.<br>
<br>
By dark Gibbon's troops had reached the opening where the advance detachment was concealed.  They ate and rested until shortly before midnight.  After ordering that his single noisy, big-wheel, mule-drawn howitzer be brought up after dawn, the colonel took to the starlit trail with the tense force.<br>
<br>
As they neared the village, the officers who were on horseback
dismounted to lead their animals.  The troops formed in single file.  They moved with such stealth that the part of the Nez Perce horse herd they encountered scarcely stirred.  The Indians, tired from the celebration of the previous evening, slept soundly.  Only an occa-
sional dog barked, as if at a coyote.<br>
<br>
Gibbon stretched out a skirmish line the same length as the village below him-about twelve hundred yards.  The reserves were put in place, and whispered orders were passed along the line that at dawn they would ease down the hill with the utmost quiet.  The signal to charge would be a rifle shot.<br>
<br>
They crouched, waiting, on the gritty soil, behind a pine that rose here and there and in the sagebrush, shivering with the mountain cold.  As the first touch of dawn showed the shape of the eastern horizon, a few cooking fires flickered in the camp.  Then a lone rider appeared, heading up the hill to check, apparently, on the horse herd.  Time hung suspended, like a drop of water waiting to fall.  Then three or four rifles fired simultaneously at the unsuspecting rider.  At that signal, the whole line crashed with sound.<br>
<br>
To the Indians it must have sounded as if the earth had split apart: the thunder of guns, the furious yells of the charging soldiers, the splintering of brush, and the splash of water as the attack swept across the creek.  The horses that were tied beside many of the tipis began to plunge and neigh- The dogs went crazy.<br>
<br>
The Indians who woke first, many of them stark naked, seized their rifles and revolvers and dashed instinctively for the closest cover-the banks of the creek and the willows in the slough.  Perhaps the unthinking burst was a good thing.  It threw them against the charging soldiers.  There were point-blank shootings, knots of hand,to-hand fighting.  The moments of delay counted.<br>
<br>
But many troopers, unchecked by such encounters, did dash through into the camp proper.  More individual battles resulted.  Much of the whites' fury was directed at the lodges, any of which might contain snipers.  Here and there a soldier rushed into one, clubbing and shooting no matter what the age or sex<br>
of the occupants.<br>
<br>
Later the claim was made that soldiers did not attack women and children until those supposed noncombatants had first killed several white officers and men.  "Then the men shot every Indian they caught sight of-men, women, and children."' The justification is not valid.<br>
<br>
The American officers knew perfectly well-or should have known-they couldn't send a bunch of wired-up troopers against a sleeping camp of hostiles and expect targets to be chosen with care.  They knew, or should have known, that the daily dress of
Indian men and women was much the same and that a soldier caught in the frenzy of battle wasn't going to pause while deciding which one to shoot.<br>
<br>
Indians acted that way, too, when making unexpected attacks on their enemies, white or red.  And when a camp was overrun and filled with indiscriminate shooting, young boys, women, and elders were going to swoop up whatever guns, knives, or clubs were handy and use them.  Such was the ultimate self-defense.  Surprise attacks do not produce kinder, gentler wars.  Ask the<br>
experts in Washington.<br>
<br>
What Gibbon evidently had not reckoned on was the injection of these tough, outdoor-hardened Indian noncombatants into the fray.  Because of that-because of the desperate and infuriated women, boys, and old menhis neatly placed skirmish line did not hold its form.  In addition, sections of thick brush and unexpectedly deep pools of water in the creek created hindrances here and there.  Pacing became ragged.<br>
<br>
In addition, the commanding officer on the left of the advancing line, Lieutenant Bradley, was killed early.  Unguided, the movement of his troopers grew aimless.  The whites tended to concentrate, leaving both flanks of the village open.  Many Nez Perces escaped through the gaps, heading for either the foothills or the brush as their automatic reflexes dictated.<br>
<br>
An extraordinary rally ensued.  We can't really follow it.  Most Indian reminiscences about the battle drift off, naturally enough, into tales of individual struggle, adventure, and sad descriptions of the deaths of friends and family members.  But we do know the whites let themselves be diverted.  Gibbon had ordered that the camp, especially the tipis, be destroyed.  The gather, ing number of whites in the center of the village chose fire as an instrument.  But the tipi covers, some of canvas but many of hide, were wet with dew and slow to ignite.<br>
<br>
The hides would be particularly resistant.  The struggles drew in others, as if destruction was somehow symbolic of victory.<br>
Even though many of the troopers were still tangling with the Indians in the soggy, willow-choked sloughs near the north end of the camp, a partial quiet settled over the central meadow.  The staccato bursts of gunfire dwindled.<br>
<br>
The white officers regarded the groups of warriors who were coming together out toward the foothills as if they were of no concem- Then sud, denly the warriors came charging back toward the camp.  At the same time Looking Glass and White Bird began yelling at the warriors who were still grappling with the enemy in the brush to tum on the whites in the camp.  A crossfire swept the area.  Realizing he was in danger of being engulfed, Gibbon ordered a retreat toward a flat-topped promontory reaching out from the lower part of the steep mountainside to the west.<br>

Those who gained it heaped up logs and rocks and settled down to hold off the Indians who had been following them fiercely.<br>
Only glimpses of Joseph appear.  Early in the melee, he and a few others were seen riding across a sagebrush-covered slope to the west to cut off and drive back into the valley several hundred horses that a party of mounted white volunteers was trying to stampede.<br>
<br>
Later Two Moons saw the chief on foot, crouched near the creek with his baby in his arms.  It was the child, not yet two months old, that had been bom at Tepahlewan just before the war began.  The chief had no gun; why we do not know.  Both his wives and Ollokot's wife had been severely wounded, and he was trying to save the baby.  The morning shadows were still stretching long across the meadow.<br>
<br>
Ducking from one bit of cover to another, the Indians closed in around Gibbon's refuge.  The women who had been fighting went back to the camp.  Joseph reappeared; he had found someone, the wounded mother perhaps, to care for the child.  Now, with White Bird helping, he prepared to move again.  Salvageable tipis were packed, the wounded were searched out and treated, and those who were unable to walk were bundled onto travois.<br>
<br>
Normally, the Indians did not like to leave their dead on the battlefield, but this time there were too many to be gathered up and removed.  The bodies that were out of rifle range and close to the creek were placed at the base of the banks that marked overflow channels of the stream.<br>
<br>
There the earth was caved in over them.  The rest were left where they lay.  By the time the sun was overhead, the noncombatants were on their way south while the warriors held the whites at bay on their uncomfortable promontory.<br>
<br>
The Indians had one piece of luck when Gibbon's artillerymen appeared on the trail.  Seeing what was happening, the whites scrambled to get their howitzer into position and lofted off a couple of harmless shots.  Then a charge by the Indians rolled over them, killing one and wounding two, though not so severely that they weren't able to flee with the other survivors.<br>
<br>
The attackers dismantled the gun and returned proudly to camp with a pack mule loaded with two thousand rounds of ammunition that fitted the rifles of the dead soldiers sprawled grotesquely on the field of combat.'<br>
<br>
The battle of the promontory settled into a siege marked by occasional potshots, some of them deadly.  The immobilized soldiers fried under a hot sun.  The wounded, including Colonel Gibbon, suffered torments of thirst.  Some hunger was satisfied by the butchering and cooking of one of the officers' horses that had been killed in their midst.  
Fear gripped the soldiers when the Nez Perces set fire to the surrounding grass, hoping perhaps to storm the stronghold under cover of the thick smoke.  Although the blaze soon died, the fear stayed, for the soldiers were running out of ammunition and might not be able to withstand a concerted assault even if it wasn't covered by smoke.  But again the typical Indian reluctance to sustain unnecessary casualties took hold, and there was no assault.<br>
<br>
As the day waned, some of the Indian fighters left the line and returned to the mostly deserted campsite (it could not be seen from the promontory) to speed up stragglers and guard them as they reined their horses along the trail taken by the main group.  The departures continued after dark.  Finally, only a few braves, led by Ollokot, kept watch over the huddled and miserable whites.<br>
<br>
How few the warriors actually were the besieged did not know, though Gibbon did risk sending couriers to Howard and the town of Deer Lodge with pleas for food, medical supplies, and doctors.<br>
<br>
In essence, Ollokot's men were guaranteeing the safety of the camp, always their prime concern.  Deciding finally that their purpose had been achieved, they sent a last volley crashing across the promontory and galloped off to meet, at dawn, their hurt and bewildered fellows at an assigned rendezvous.<br>
<br>
The rendezvous spot was only twelve miles away, but the cavalcade had moved slowly.  Many were sorely wounded.  A few-one was Ollokot's wife-died along the way.  Some who could not keep up requested that they be left behind, a seeming ruthlessness common to all Indians in times of emergency.<br>
<br>
As the numbness of terror left them, they tried to count their losses.  There never was full agreement.  Significantly, though, the number of veteran warriors listed-the few warriors who had fought the Sioux on the Plains and the Bannocks in southem Idaho-stayed firm.  Twelve killed.<br>
<br>
Rainbow; Five Wounds; Hahtalekin, leader of the Palouse warriors; Wahlitits and Sarpsis llppilp, whose outburst on the Salmon had started the war; and half a dozen more of the same quality were gone.  Another eighteen or twenty males had died with them.  Joseph's figure of the number of men of fighting age lost to the freedom seekers was thirty-three.<br>
<br>
The number of women and children? There is no way of knowing.  The body count on the field had been uncertain.  Like Ollokot's wife, some of the wounded died on the trail, as, most probably, did those who had asked to be left behind.  Estimates of the total range from thirty to sixty dead women and children, the bitter fruit of a simple desire to be left alone.'<br>

General Howard was just coming off the Lolo Trail when Gibbon's appeal for reinforcements reached him.  Leaving his infantry plodding behind, he hurried south up the Bitterroot Valley with two-hundred cavalrymen.  When the closing in of the mountains slowed the group, he put a chosen cadre of twentyfive or so men on the command's best horses, added seventeen Bannock Indian scouts, and spurred ahead as swiftly as the rough trail allowed.<br>
<br>
Another messenger from Gibbon carrying a desperate appeal for medical help somehow missed him, but fortunately contacted the main body of the cavalry.  With the following group rode two doctors, one of them Emily FitzGerald's husband, Jenkins FitzGeraid, or John, as she called him.  Accompanied by a special escort, they joined the race to the battlefield.  By midday on August 10 both Howard's party and theirs had arrived.<br>
<br>
Shocked, FitzGerald wrote his wife, "We found a horrible state of affairs.  There were 39 wounded without Surgeons or dressings, and many of them suffering intensely." The official account of the casualties came to twenty-nine killed, six of them volunteers, and forty wounded, four of them volunteers.<br>
<br>
A question arises.  There is no mention of any white finding a still-breathing Nimipu on the field.  Either Joseph, his helpers, and the terrified women had done an extraordinary job of retrieving their wounded from the timbered hillside, the stream, the willow thickets, and the campsite.  Or the burial squads who were appointed to gather dead soldiers from the battlefield for internment at the foot of the once-besieged promontory finished off whatever Indians they found still alive.<br>
<br>
Or the Bannock scouts, from a tribe that had been on-and-off foes of the Nez Perces for more years than history records, did the job.  With no objection from Howard, the Bannocks hunted eagerly for Nez Perce corpses, some of which they had exhumed.<br>
<br>
Indifferent to the sex or age of the dead, they joyfully scalped the remains.  Horrid, indeed, General Howard admitted, but no more gruesome than railroad accidents, major fires, or pestilences.  And, he added, not nearly as bad as Indian brutalities committed on whites.  Still, compunction finally got the best of the Christian general and, at the urging of one of his own men, he had the mutilated bodies buried.<br>
<br>
The battle, which came only fourteen months after the Custer massacre, attracted nationwide attention.  First reactions in the nearby towns of Deer Lodge and Helena were favorable.  Sympathetic citizens sent out wagons mattressed with straw for hauling the wounded back to local hospitals.<br>
<br>
With them the relief parties brought delicacies-jams, canned oysters, garden-fresh vegetables, and beef-as well as clean shirts, socks, and pajamas.  Gibbon's superior officers commended
him publicly and in private correspondence for a job well done against superior forces.  Medals for heroism were ordered distributed.  Volunteers swarmed into the camp near the battlefield to reap a belated share of glory by helping run down the beaten foe.<br>
<br>
Underneath the glitter, however, was a heavy layer of dross.  After having achieved the enormous advantages of surprise, how did it happen that Gibbon had finished the battle pinned down ignominiously and precariously by untrained Indians-Indians who were also said to have lost the Battle of the Clearwater but obviously hadn't.  Clearly, the critics went on, the Nez Perce war was being mismanaged, one more example of the inadequacies of America's Indian-fighting army.<br>
<br>
Fortunately for himself, Gibbon was no longer on exhibit.  He left the battlefield slightly wounded in the thigh.  His troops, except for fifty men and their officers who elected to join Howard during his continued pursuit of the Nez Perces, returned to their original stations.<br>
<br>
The general appreciated the reinforcements, but was on edge about the nationwide scrutiny and about critical letters coming to him from his superiors.  He dared make no more mistake and yet possible pitfalls abounded, as he became aware when he paused in the mining town of Bannack on August 14, the second day of the resumed chase.'<br>
<br>
He was not operating in a wilderness.  Gold rushes had swept across the area more than a decade earlier, leaving a detritus of hard-core towns fed by local farms and ranches.  In turn Bannack, Virginia City, and Helena had served as territorial capitals.  Deer Lodge and Butte attracted other small swarms.  Freight and stagecoach roads ran south through the fat lower half of Idaho to tap the Union and Central Pacific railways in Utah.<br>
<br>
One of the roads eventually found its way up Birch Creek in Idaho and crossed a small divide into the Lemhi Fork of the Salmon River.  Another, farther east, crossed Monida Pass, as it is called today, into the extreme southwestern part of Montana.  That road was followed by a telegraph line.  Branches from both highways led to Bannack, Montana, still the center of small mining operations and widespread ranches.<br>
<br>
Most of the people in the area dreaded the next move of the Nez Perces.  They fortified local courthouses; they built stockades; they formed militia units whose captains, elected by popular vote, considered themselves entitled by virtue of their sudden elevation to give Howard emphatic advice about what to do next.  Bannack was one of those defense centers.<br>
<br>
When Howard halted at the town, he was greeted both by cheers of relief and by growls of anxiety.  As he and the townspeople knew
from their scouts, the Indians had fled from the Big Hole battlefield south along the edges of the hills that formed the western rim of that wide prairie.  They followed the same procedure-staying close to the western hills-after crossing a difficult ridge onto the rolling plains of Horse Prairie.<br>
<br>
While skirting Horse Prairie they attacked two ranches. (The womenfolk of both places had been sent to Bannack for safekeeping.) The Nez Perces killed eight men, ransacked the two houses, and stole a reputed 250 horses.  Continuing south-it was August 1 3, the day before Howard's arrival in Bannack-they intersected and followed the branch road that crossed Bannack Pass out of Montana into the Lemhi Valley of ldaho.<br>
<br>
Agitated militia captains from the Lemhi hurried to Howard and urged him to come to their valley.  The Indians, they were convinced, planned to turn north and pass through the town of Salmon on their way to the Southern Nez Perce Trail, which would lead them back to their cherished homelands.<br>
<br>
Howard could intercept them-and spare the valley all the barbarities of which the Indians were capable-if he would cross the Continental Divide at Lemhi Pass, a gap Lewis and Clark had used on their way to the Pacific, and throw a line of soldiers across the Indians' path.<br>

<br>
FALL BACK ON WHITE RIVER<br>
<br>
On October 21st, Captain Maloney started with seventy-five men and joined Lieutenant Slaughter's command on the White River Prairie. Two days later they were joined by the volunteer company under Captain Hayes, and the entire command started to cross the range. When near the summit Captain Maloney received an express from Steilacoom informing him that Major Rains would not be able to take the field for ten or twelve days.<br>
<br>
Captain Maloney immediately fell back to the White River Prairie, and as luck would have it arrived just in the nick of time.<br>
<br>
The day before the command returned to White River Dick Bradley with two Frenchman, arrived in camp almost exhausted and stated that they had been taken prisoners by the Indians two days previously. The Frenchmen were well known to the savages and were in no danger, but Bradley would have been promptly killed if the Frenchmen had not declared he was a countryman of theirs. The Indians were in doubt, but rather than kill a tillicum of the Hudson's Bay Company, they allowed him to go with his companions.<br>
<br>
EVIDENCE OF A BATTLE<br>
<br>
After being released the three men set out and the following day came across Captain Maloney's camp. They stated that while held as prisoners they saw mules and American horses, with cavalry saddles and holsters, showing that the Indians had been in battle with soldiers and had acquired some spoils.<br>
<br>
Upon arriving at White River Captain Maloney sent William Tidd as an express messenger to Fort Steilacoom. A guard accompanied Tidd, consisted of Mr. Bright, Joseph Miles, A. Benton Moses, D.H. Bradley, Dr. Burns and A. B. Rabbeson.<br>
<br>
On the same day that Captain Maloney fell back with his command to White River Prairie McAllister and Connell were killed in the swamp lying west of Connell's Prairie. The following day the express sent to Steilacoom by Captain Maloney met the Indians on the east side of this swamp and had a friendly talk but when they reached the swamp the hostiles opened fire, killing Miles and Moses.<br>
<br>
In the throes of death, however, Moses clung to his horse and was carried about a mile beyond the swamp where Bradley, Tidd, and Rabbeson lifted his inanimate corpse from the animal. His body was secreted behind a large log where we found it three days later and gave it Christian burial with military honors. Miles, when shot, fell from his horse desperately wounded and was dispatched by the savages.<br>
<br>
SEPARATE FOR SAFETY<br>
<br>
At the crossing of the creek west of the Kelly place the express<br>
was again fired upon, but no one hurt. The members composing the express deemed it best to separate and each endeavor to reach Steilacoom. They accordingly took to the woods and after two days of hardship managed to reach the fort safely, bringing the news the day after young McAllister arrived with word of the killing of his father and Connell by the band under Quiemuth.<br>
<br>
A company of volunteers was at once organized among the settlers to relieve the endangered and isolated ranchmen.  They did not wait to perfect organization at the fort, but hastened to the farm of Thomas Tollentire, where Company D of the First Regiment of the Washington Volunteers perfected organization by electing William H. Wallace, Captain.<br>
<br>
SETTLERS FLEE TO THE FORT<br>
<br>
When Tidd, Bradley, and Rabbeson reached the fort with news of the killing of Moses and Miles there was naturally much excitement. At this time also settlers from the Lower Puyallup Valley were arriving with stories of distress and disaster.<br>
<br>
The Indians had risen at all points north of the Nisqually and had it not been for the timely warning given by a friendly Puyallup the loss of life in this valley would probably have been appalling. But the warning received enabled the families to flee to Steilacoom for safety.<br>
<br>
Captain Wallace at once started to put himself in communication with Captain Maloney and marched toward the White River Prairies. On the following day, just as we had crossed the Puyallup we found Dr. Burns hidden in a barley stack. Dr. Burns was a member of the express party, but had been separated from the rest when they took to the woods.<br>
<br>
When found he had a supply of dried salmon with him, but had lost his horse and boots and was very much demoralized. He told us he had taken off his boots because he was surrounded by Indians and he feared to travel in them for the reason that the crackling of twigs would give notice of his presence.<br>
<br>
He accordingly sat down on a log and took his boots off, caching them by the side of the trail. Sure enough we found the boots about an hour afterwards.<br>
<br>
DEAD BODIES ARE RECOVERED<br>
<br>
Two miles further on we came across the body of Moses just as he had been left behind a log. When we reached the swamp we found the bodies of Miles, McAllister and Connell. The following day the bodies were taken to Captain Maloney's camp, the command having moved from White River to Connell's Prairie.<br>
<br>
On the day of his arrival there he had a battle with the Indians at the crossing of White River on the Muckleshoot reservation. The<br>
fight lasted several hours. At the first volley, the Indians killed one regular and one volunteer. Captain Maloney reported that thirty of the enemy had been slain.<br>
<br>
BURGE SHOT FROM AMBUSH<br>
<br>
The next day I started for the field of battle, but the Indians had fallen back during the night. About 10 o'clock we found their camp with the fires still burning freshly. We took their trail and when about one third of the way down the hill going to Green River Andrew J.Burge was shot in the knee by a hostile who had concealed himself behind a tree.<br>
<br>
We fired several volleys after the Indian, but as dense brush covered the hill side, none of them took effect and he escaped. When we reached the river the Indians had succeeded in crossing ahead of us.<br>
<br>
It was raining heavily, and I remember that the sand was being washed into their tracks. However, we went after them on the run and just at the crossing of an old river bed received their first fire.<br>
<br>
DRIVE SAVAGES BEFORE THEM<br>
<br>
About four hundred of them were lying in ambush to wait for us. Fortunately none of our men were killed or wounded, though several had their clothing cut by the flying bullets. We returned the fire, charged and drove the savages into a canyon where there was an immense drift of logs and trees.<br>
<br>
The Indians concealed themselves in the drift, and as it was then dark we went into camp. Of all the wet, cold, disagreeable nights I ever spent, I think that was the worst. We were warm and perspiring when we stopped chasing the Indians but soon became cold and hungry.<br>
<br>
When we left Steilacoom we only had two days' rations, expecting to find plenty of provisions in Captain Maloney's camp, but he had used up all his hardtack, so that we had to draw flour, mix and bake it as we could.<br>

LETTER FROM MR.  RABBESON TO THE EDITOR OF THE <B>PIONEER AND DEMOCRAT</B> DATED OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON TERRITORY, NOVEMBER 5,1855.<br>
<br>
Believing that a short account of the misfortune happening to the escort detailed from Capt Hays' company of Mounted Volunteers to escort the Express messengers--Major William Tidd and John Bradley to Acting Governor Mason, might prove of interest to your readers,I therefore give a brief detail of the circumstances happening on the route.<br>
Colonel A.Benton Moses, Dr. M.P. Burns, George Bright, Joseph Miles, and myself in company with the Express messengers, left camp at the first crossing of the Nachez river, on Tuesday last; and traveled unmolested until Wednesday evening, three o'clock to Connell's prairie in the White River valley.<br>
<br>
Here we met with a party of Clickatat and Nesqually Indians, numbering about one hundred fifty warriors.  Having there discovered that Mr. Connell's house had recently been burned, we inquired of the Indians who, at that time showed no signs of molestation, had burned the house or if they knew how it came to be burned?<br>
<br>
They denied all knowledge of the cause and declared themselves entirely peaceable, saying that their tum tums were hyas close copa Bostons, ie. that their hearts were right towards the Bostons.  We talked with them for a long time, asking many questions, why there were there? and endeavored as much as words would do to draw them out and make them show their true position, they all the while making declarations of friendship.<br>
<br>
We then went to the place where we supposed they intended to camp<br>
and endeavored to purchase some mockasins from their squaws and while there we saw and conversed a while with their main chief, Leschi.  In the meantime, all the first Indians were gradually dispersed, but we did not know at that time where.  We then mounted our horses again and proceeded on our route about half a mile to a deep muddy swamp.<br>
<br>
There we received a murderous fire, from the very same Indians who had secreted themselves in ambush from behind us.  Colonel A. Benton Moses received a ball, entering the left side of the back and passing immediately under the heart and came out through the right breast, going through the center of a letter in the breast pocket of his over coat.<br>
<br>
Mr. Joseph Miles, of Olympia, received a wound in the neck, which unhorsed him, he fell in the deep mud and was unable to regain his horse's back again, or get out without assistance.  We directed him to take hold of his stirrup leather, while we gathered his horse's bridle and then putting spurs to our horses, we succeeded in dragging him out of the mud.<br>
<br>
Here we found that he had become so faint, that it was impossible for him to mount his horse.  He then told us to leave him and make our escape if we could, as there was no hope for him.<br>
<br>
All this time the Indians were pouring into us a continuous fire, not more than thirty yards distant, in which Major Tidd received three slugs in his head, but did not penetrate the skull.  We were compelled to leave Mr. Miles so we put spurs to our horses and rode about a mile and a half when Colonel Moses became so much exhausted in consequence of his wound that he could not remain on horseback any longer.<br>
<br>
We then dismounted and carried him some two hundred yards and hid him in the brush.  We then remounted and rode at full speed to the first crossing of Finnell's creek.  Here we discovered another ambuscade; whereupon we dismounted and made a charge into the brush, three of us on one side of the creek and two upon the other, each of us discharging the full contents of our revolvers and then using our sabres, completely routing the Indians, they not firing a gun.<br>
<br>
We must have killed quite a number of them, as none of us had to shoot more than ten feet, and several times we placed our revolvers against their bodies.  We then returned to Colonel Moses for the purpose of making him more secure and comfortable; we took our coats and wrapped them around him and left him having rendered him all the assistance in our power, that we were able under the circumstances.  On leaving him, his last words were:"Boys if you escape, remember me!"<br>
<br>
We then returned to the edge of the bluff going down to Finnell's creek, here we discovered a large body of Indians on the opposite side of the prairie that lay close by, but our number being so few, we did not think it advisable to risk another attack.  All of us, with the exception of Dr. M.P. Burns, took to the brush, but he kept straight on declaring that "He would fight until he died!" We considered it recklessness, but it was utterly impossible to persuade him otherwise.<br>
<br>
We saw him enter the Opposite side of the timber and immediately heard the report of three guns and an Indian yell, and very naturally supposed that was the last of him.<br>
<br>
We kept in brush and traveled until dark.  We then stopped and held a consultation as to what course to pursue.  Some were for re-
turning to Captain Maloney's camp, others for making for the settlements.  We finally concluded to make for the settlements, believing that we could get assistance to Colonel Moses sooner.<br>
The night was very disagreeable, raining and dark in the forepart of the night and freezing in the afterpart.  We all became so exhausted that we could not travel but a short distance at a time, sometimes up to our waists in water and at others entangled in the immense thickets of underbrush and fallen timber.<br>
While resting, two of us would lay down on the ground and the other two upon the top of them.  When the two underneath would get a little warm we would then change places.  At other times we would get to a hollow stump or tree, two of us would enter and allow the other two to lean against our breasts, and blow the warm breath in others faces.<br>
<br>
About daylight we crossed the immigrant road, but dare not travel in it from fear of discovery.  We then took a course as near as we could for the forks of the Puyallup River.  We struck the river at noon about three miles above the forks, then travelled down the river until we supposed ourselves opposite the upper crossing, then went to the river and found ourselves too far down.<br>
We here undertook to cross a large deep swamp.  This was about two hours before sunset.<br>
<br>
On reaching the opposite side we found ourselves on the edge of Lemon's prairie; consequently we were compelled to remain in the deep mud and water until long after dark, all the while shaking with cold so much that our cartridge boxes rattled like cow bells.  About an hour from the time we first came there we saw two Indians approach close by and secrete themselves in a small willow thicket.  We supposed them to be spies.  We could have taken them prisoners or killed them, but to do so we were afraid that we would have to fire a gun and to escape without observation required much care and anxiety having to scrape away the sticks and leaves from under our feet as we stepped until we were out of hearing.<br>
<br>
We then crossed the Puyallup and took the immigrant trail direct to Steilacoom.  We arrived at Mr. Tallentire's on Friday morning at three o'clock all very much exhausted having been three days and nights without food.  About one half mile from Mr. Tallentires house, Mr. George Bright became so much fatigued that it was impossible for him to travel any further; here he laid down and went to sleep the rest of us being so weak that we could not carry him.<br>
<br>
Upon reaching the house we dispatched Mr. Tallentire and an Indian in search of him, but he slept so soundly that their hallooing would not rouse him and the night being so dark he could not be found until morning.<br>
<br>
After reaching Steilacoom we immediately sent to the station and informed Lieutenant Nugent of the above circumstances, who immediately detailed Captain Wallace and his command to the relief of Colonel Moses and to deal with the Indians according to their deserts.<br>
Yours in haste.<br>
A.B. Rabbeson.<br>

-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Please contradict the report that I was killed by the Indians on Wednesday last.  I killed seven with my own hands.  They hunted me through the brush for one mile with dogs and lighted sticks and every one who carried a light I shot.<br>
<br>
The only wound I got was a skin wound in the forehead from a buckshot.  I lived in the brush on leaves and shot an Indian this morning for his dried salmon and wheat at Mr. Lemon's.<br>
Give my respects to Bright and Rabbeson and let them known I am safe.<br>
<br>
Only I had to throw away my boots and my feet are badly hurt.  Lost my horse, instruments and medicine case. My horse was shot in the kidneys in the swamp where we received a murderous discharge of balls and buck-shot.<br>
<br>
Please let Mr. Wiley say I am all right.<br>
I remain respectfully,<br>
M. P.  Burns,<br>
Surgeon.  Captain  Hay's Company<br>

The Battle of Camas Meadows<br>
<br>
H.J. Davis, "The Battle of Camas Meadows," <B>Northwestern Fights and Fighters.</B> Williamstown, Massachusetts: Corner House Publishers, 1974, p. 190-197.<br>
<br>
During the memorable campaign against the Nez Perce Indians, in the year I877, there were many stirring incidents that have never been given to the public, and notably among these is the Camas Meadow fight of Capt.  Randolph Norwood's Company L, of the Second Cavalry.<br>
<br>
In the early part of the summer we had assisted the Fifth Infantry, under Col.  Nelson A. Miles, in rounding up and capturing the remnant band of Cheyenne Sioux, under Lame Deer, and bringing them into the cantonment at the mouth of Tongue River.  Shortly after arriving there, Gen.  W. T. Sherman and staff, and the General's son, Thomas, came up the Yellowstone on a tour of inspection, and we were ordered to escort them to Fort Ellis, which was our home station.<br>
<br>
Arriving there, a portion of the company was detailed to accompany our distinguished visitors on a trip of sight-seeing to the Yellowstone Park.  They had scarcely departed when despatches arrived telling of a disastrous engagement of Col.  John Gibbon's troops with the Nez Perces at Big Hole Pass, something like one 
hundred and sixty miles away; saying he was <B>in</B> desperate circumstances and in danger of annihilation, and ordering us to hasten with all speed to his relief.<br>
<br>
Our company was depleted, by various details, to about fifty men, and with this force we started within the hour, which was already late in the day.  Virginia City, sixty miles, was made on the night of the following day; the next ninety miles were made without halt, except for coffee for the men and short rests for the horses.  It was a tedious ride; all day, all night and all day again, the steady plod, plod of the horses broken at night by the occasional smothered exclamation or oath of some trooper who had dropped asleep and nearly fallen from his horse.<br>
<br>
On the second night out from Virginia City we went into camp late, 
moved early the following morning, <B>and had not been </B>on the road long before we met wagon and travois train bringing wounded from the battle-field.  They told us that they had been soundly whipped, with great loss, and that the Indians, unable to dislodge them, had, after a three days' siege, departed, taking a southeasterly course and following the main range of the Rocky Mountains.<br>
<br>
They would, without question, have killed or captured every man of Gibbon's force, bad they not been apprised of a large force of soldiers coming from the West.  This was Gen. 0. 0. Howard's
command, consisting of two companies of the First United States Cavalry, two or three batteries of the Fourth United States Artillery, and the Twenty-first United States Infantry.  The ar-
tillery was equipped as infantry.  This force we joined, and then began a stern chase which proved to be the traditional long chase.<br>
<br>
Our course was the same as the Indians had taken.  But with our heavier impedimenta the best we could do was to keep from fifteen to twenty miles behind them.  We crossed to the south side of the main range, and for seven nights we slept booted and spurred.  We were following the trail, which, after crossing the mountains, led through a good grazing country, and from the numerous carcasses of cattle which lined the trail we knew that the Indians were well sustained.<br>
<br>
An interesting fact, to those not acquainted with Indian ways is that these dead steers were disemboweled and the bulk of the internal arrangements had disappeared, while the loins, rump, and, in fact, all choice parts, from a white man's point of view, had not been disturbed.<br>
<br>
The trail was easily followed, as it was from fifty to one hundred and fifty feet wide, and the vegetation was almost entirely obliterated by the tramping of their several hundred ponies and  the  dragging  of  scores   of travois poles.  At their halting-places we found many freshly made graves, showing that their wounded list was growing smaller.<br>
<br>
We also noticed, at  such  resting spots, numbers of conical piles of pony droppings, evidently built by hand, which our scouts told us were constructed by the young bucks to show their contempt for us.<br>
<br>
When we struck Camas Creek, General Howard decided to give the men and horses a chance to rest, as our march had been arduous, and the Indians seemed about to strike for the headwaters of Snake River, and from there enter the then almost wholly unexplored Yellowstone Park.  We camped on the east bank of Camas Creek, on open ground.  Opposite, and above the camp, the creek was fringed with cottonwoods and alders, and below, the banks were clear and the stream flowed over a natural meadow to "The Sink" a few miles below, where it disappeared.<br>
<br>
The creek was literally alive with trout from twelve to twenty inches long and offered the finest sport I have ever seen.  With only a small portion of the men fishing, enough were taken to feed the entire command.  In the immediate vicinity of that camp ground there is now a company, with a capital of two hundred thousand dollars, engaged in raising trout for market, and they supply Ogden, Salt Lake City, and even San Francisco; the waters are ideal for the purpose.  
At night guards were posted, and a picket post was established some five hundred yards up stream, near the creek and on a rocky knoll, and two at other points.  The mule herd was turned loose to graze in the space between the camp and the principal picket post mentioned above.<br>
<br>
Some of the men slept under the wagons and others pitched shelter tents; I chose the latter method and  with Private Monaghan for a "bunky" was soon in a state of "innocuous desuetude.  " Either our pickets fell asleep or the Indians were very astute, for during the dark half hour that generally precedes daylight we were awakened by a disconcerting concert of demoniacal yells and a cracking of rifles, while the whizzing of bullets could be heard well overhead.<br>
<br>
Every one was out in a minute, and all we could see was a magnified imitation of a swarm of fireflies fluttering in the alders as the rifles spoke; while the tramping of hundreds of hoofs added to the din.<br>
<br>
We had no sooner sent them "a Roland for their Oliver" than the fireflies ceased winking, and, except the noise we were making ourselves, nothing could be heard but receding hoof-beats and faint yells, as the enemy returned from whence they came, taking with them, as a souvenir, about one hundred and fifty mules, our pack-train.<br>
<br>
Our company horses had pulled one picket-pin, and had them milled 'round and round and twisted themselves into a grotesque puzzle.<br>
<br>
Orders came  quickly for the three companies of cavalry to saddle and  pursue and try to recapture the pack train.  One company of the First Cavalry was to make a detour to the right and the other to the left and our company was to follow the trail.  The morning air was extremely chilly and crisp and the horses ranky so that what was an orderly gallop, at first soon developed into a race.<br>
<br>
After half an hour of this we approached a the foot-hills.  The first ridge, which was the first roll of the foothills. The first ones to make the summit of the ridge suddenly stopped and then quickly returned to the foot; as the rest of us came up we soon learned that the Indians had made a stand just over the ridge.<br>
<br>
We dismounted and the Number Fours, each holding four horses, being unable to fight, left about thirty-five of us to meet the Indians.  Crawling to the top we saw a line. of dismounted skirmishers standing behind their ponies, on open ground and about a thousand yards away.  We deployed along the ridge and for twenty minutes or so exchanged shots with them with but little damage on either side, as the range was long for our Springfields and longer for their Winchesters.
Lieutenant Benson of the Seventh Infantry, who was attached to our company for the days standing up for an instant, just at my side received a bullet which entered at the hip-pocket and went out at the other, having passed entirely through both buttocks; this, while we were facing the enemy, caused us to realize that we had no ordinary Indians to deal with, for, while we had been frolicking with the skirmishers in front,, Chief Joseph<br>
<br>
had engineered as neat a double flank movement as could be imagined, and we were exposed to a raking fire coming from right and left.<br>
<br>
The horses had been withdrawn, more than five hundred yards, to a clump of cottonwoods; and when we turned around there was no sight nor sign of them.  For a brief period there was a panic, and then we heard the notes of a bugle blowing "Recall" from the cottonwood thicket.<br>
<br>
The race to that thicket was something never to be forgotten, for a cavalryman is not trained for a five hundred yard sprint.  Luck was with us, however, and no man was hit in that mad race for safety.  I had a horse's nose-bag slung over my shoulder containing extra cartridges, and a bullet cut the strap and let it fall to the ground.  A hero would have stopped, gone back and recovered that bag, but not I.<br>
<br>
We all reached the horses and found the place an admirable one for defense; it was a sort of basin, an acre or so in extent, with a rim high enough to protect our horses, and filled with young cottonwoods in full leaf.<br>
<br>
It was oval in shape, and we deployed in all directions around the rim.  For two hours it was a sniping game and our casualties were eight.  The Indians crawled very close, one shooting Harry Trevor in the back at about fifteen feet, as we knew by the moccasin tracks and empty shells found behind a rock after the engagement.<br>
<br>
Poor Trevor's wound was mortal as was that of Sam Glass, who was shot through the bladder; a bullet hit Sergeant Garland's cartridge-belt and drove two cartridges from it clear through his body; his wound never healed and he blew out his brains a few years later.  Will Clark had his shoulder partly torn away by an explosive ball; Sergeant Wilkins, a head wound, and Ferrier Jones, a "busted" knee; a citizen attache, a bullet through the foot, and the lieutenant, wounded as told above.<br>
<br>
This was the amount of damage done to us, and what we did to the Indians we never knew, as they retreated in good order taking their dead or injured with them, after they, found they could not dislodge us. Three dead ponies and some pools of blood were all the records we found of their casualties.<br>
<br>
The real hero of the occasion was Sergeant Hugh McCafferty, who

climbed a cottonwood tree, and <B>in</B> short range of every Indian and only concealed by the foliage, kept us posted on their movements by passing the word to a man stationed under the tree.  For this act he was given a certificate of merit and a medal by Congress.  It should have been mentioned that we recovered twenty mules that were dropped by the Indians about midway between the camp and battle-ground.<br>
<br>
The others were never retaken, but were worn out or died <B>before the final</B> surrender of the few survivors to Colonel Miles.<br>
<br>
We took up the trail the next day, after our wounded had been started for the post under escort.  I could never understand how those two companies of the First Cavalry could have missed the Indians and gotten entirely out of touch with us, when we started together and we were fighting within half an hour and kept it up for nearly three hours.<br>
<br>
More could be told of our chase through forest and canyon, over mountains and be let down across gorges, where wagons had to perpendicular walls by hand, for two hundred feet.  But that is another story.<br>

CASCADE BATTLE.<br>
<br>
J.H. Herman, "The Cascade Massacre, <B>The Oregon Native Son.</B> I (January, 1900) p. 495-496.<br>
<br>
Early in the spring of 1856, Colonel Wright, then in command of the government forces at Fort Dalles, began preparations for fitting out an expedition into the Nez Perce country, intending to start with his entire command for Walla Walla on March <B>20.<br>
<br>
</B>This was known to the Klickitat Indians  who were supposed to be friendly to the whites.  Owing, however, to the nonarrival of . supplies, Colonel Wright did not break camp at The Dalles until the morning of the 26th.  A fact which the Indians in Klickitat County <B>and </B>the Cascades were not advised of, which probably made them bold in the attempt to do their dastardly work of slaughter.<br>
<br>
During the spring of 1856 I was manning a flat boat between The Dalles and the Cascades, and on the morning of the 26th had been taken in tow by the steamer Mary, a small boat plying the river, and together the two vessels arrived at the Upper Cascades about 8 o'clock A. M., anchoring <B>in </B>the mouth of Mill creek, a small slough on the north side of the Columbia, just large enough to admit the boats.<br>
<br>
The morning was calm and clear and about 8 o'clock , when all on board the boats  were  busily engaged in loading and unloading  freight, nothing was heard, until a half-breed    named Montoui      came  on board the Mary fatally wounded, and stated that he had been shot by the Indians.  He was followed by John Chance who had received a gunshot wound in the heel, who reported Indians every-
where.<br>
<br>
By this time the firing of guns could be distinctly heard in every direction, which caused general consternation on the  steamer Mary.  Being  unarmed, and fearing attack on the boat, Captain Dan Baughman and the first offlcer of the Mary left the vessel and secreted themselves in the woods.<br>
<br>
I also left the boat, hiding in the Willows near the edge of the water.  The negro crook became so frightened that he jumped overboard, but the engineer and fireman and two or three deckhands remained on board.  There was but little fuel on board the boat, but what little there was Fireman Chenoweth got up steam, and climbing to the wheel he ordered Deckhand Liniley to cast off the lines.<br>
<br>
While obeying this command he was shot, though not seriously wounded.  The Mary floated down the river some distance until sufficient steam was raised to give her power, when she started up
stream.  From my place of concealment among the Willows I hailed the boat and was taken aboard, when I relieved Fireman Chenowith at the wheel and steered the Mary to the Oregon side, where enough rails were secured at Mr. Atwell's place to furnish the boat with sufficient fuel to reach the wood yard further up the river.<br>
<br>
While crossing the river the people on board the boat witnessed the burning of the sawmill and could see the settlers congregating at Bradford & Co.'s store at the Upper Cascades, while a continual fusilade of firing could be heard.<br>
<br>
The steamer Wasco was lying on the opposite side of the river, and as soon as her commander, Capt.  McFarland, realized what was happening he got all the people near at hand on board and started for The Dalles.  The Mary followed and both boats arrived there in due time, <B>giving </B>an account of what happened at the Cascades.<br>
<br>
A courier was immediately dispatched to notify Col.  Wright, who had encamped his command at Five Mile, and on receiving word of the massacre, brought his command back to The Dalles, and began active preparations to repair to the scene of the disturbances.<br>
But let our narrative leave Col.  Wright for a time and return to the events at Upper Cascades.<br>
<br>
The Indians who took part in the bloody work were evidently possessed of all the cunning and treachery of their race, and had planned their onslaught with such stealth that they were enabled to swoop down upon their victims like so many mad devils, giving them no time to prepare for defense.  They were preparing for their day's work when the Indians rushed in and killed them and burned the mill.  Mrs. Brown, wife of the mill foreman, was also killed.<br>
<br>
The bodies of all four were stiipped of their clothing and thrown in Mill creek.  Mrs. Brown's brother, a boy named Kyle, was killed while running from the mill to Bradford & Co.'s store.  A carpenter named Watkins and three men, whose names were unknown, all in the employ of Bradford & Co., who were in the woods near the store, were shot down at their work.<br>
<br>
Mr. Griswold, who had charge of the portage road, was killed at the Middle Cascades and two or three soldiers, cutting wood near by, were surprised and killed where they were working.<br>
<br>
An officer in the employ of the Hudson's Bay Co., and a Mr. St Clair, were shot down at the door of Bradford & Co.'s store, making <B>20 </B>victims in all who were killed.  The wounded were James Murphy, John Watkins, Jim Thomson, James Lindsey and Jesse Kempton.<br>

<br>
The building was on the bank of the river, but immediately north was a high bluff where the Indians could secrete themselves and fire into the building.  From this bluff firebrands were thrown on the roof of the store, and it would have been burned had it not been for Mr. Alexander, who climbed into the comb of the roof, removed a stovepipe, and for forty-eight hours stood in the opening thus made, throwing water on the firebrands.<br>
<br>
Thus the little band of settlers defended themselves for two days and nights, until the morning of the 28th, when Col.  Wright and his command arrived and delivered them from their perils.<br>
<br>
All was bustle at The Dalles on the day of the 27th.  Col.  Wright and <B>his</B> command had returned from Five Mile during the night and preparations were being hastily made for transporting the soldiers to the Cascades.  It was a late hour, however, before everything could be got in readiness for the little fleet, consisting of the steamers Mary and Wasco and a barge carrying two mountain howitzers, to start down the river with all of Col.  Wright's command on board.<br>
<br>
Darkness overtook them at Findley's place where they encamped for the night, and at daylight on the morning of the 28th, the boats quietly glided into the slough at the mouth of Mill creek.<br>
<br>
Little time was consumed in getting the soldiers on land, but their coming was observed by the Indians, and those %N,ho were taking part in zhe siege at the store, the ones who were guilty of perpetrating the massacre, stealthily withdrew across the mountains to Klickitat, leaving their more unfortunate brothers, the Indians who lived at Cascades, and who were innocent of <B>any </B>crime, to answer for their misdeeds.<br>
<br>
Col.  Wright put his command in motion and in a short time gathered all the Indians in one body upon the banks of the river, where a court martial was organized for trying the supposed offenders.  And then began a persecution of the Indians that has ever been a dis-
grace to civilization.  A bitter feeling existed among the Indians who lived in the vicinity of the Cascades, and in the trial before the courtmartial one faction was arrayed against the other.<br>
<br>
Indians who had grudges against their fellows, swore away the lives of either ten or eleven perfectly innocent men.<br>

CAPTAIN COE'S LETTER.<br>

<br>
The following is the account of Captain Coe, by letter to Mr. P. F. Bradford, who was at that time on a visit to Massachusetts:<br>
<br>
Cascades, W. T., 6th April, I856.<br>
<br>
My Dear Put:-We have had a little tea party since you left, and I will try to give you a little description of the same.<br>
<br>
<B>On </B>Wednesday, March 26, at about 8 A.  M., after the men had gone to their usual work on the two bridges of the new rail-way, mostly on the bridge near Bush's house the Yakimas came down upon us.<br>
<br>
There was a line of them from the Mill creek above us to the big point at the head of the falls, firing simultaneously on the men.  The first notice was the bullets and the cracks of the guns.<br>
<br>
0f our men, at the first fire, one was killed and several wounded.  Our men, on seeing the Indians, all ran for our store through a shower of bullets, except three who started down stream for the Middle block house, distant <B> 1 1/2 </B>miles.  Bush and family also ran into our store leaving his own house vacant.<br>
<br>
The Watkins family came to our store after a Dutch boy, who was lame from a cut <B>in </B>the foot had been shot in their house.  Watkins, Finley and Bailey were at work on the new warehouse on the island,  around which the water was now high enough to run about three feet under the bridges.<br>
<br>
There was grand confusion in the store at first, and Sinclair of the H. Sinclair B. Co., Walla Walla-going to the railroad door to look out, was shot from the bank above the store and instantly killed.  Some of us then commenced getting the guns and rifles, which were ready loaded, from below the counter.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, about one hour before there had been left with us, for transportation below, nine United States rifles, with cartridge boxes and amunition. (By Mr. Jehu Switzler, who was returning from having taken 960 head of horses from Vancouver to Col.  Wright's command at The Dalles.)<br>
<br>
These saved us.  As the upper story of the house was abandoned, Smith, the cook, having come below, and as the stairway was outside, where we dare not go, the stovepipe was hauled down, the hole en-
larged with axes, and a party of men crawled up, and the upper part of the house was soon secured.  We were surprised that the Indians hid not rushed into the upper story, as there was nothing or nobody to prevent them.<br>
<br>
Our men soon got some shots at the Indians on the bank above us.  I saw Bush shoot an Indian, the first one killed, who was drawing a bead on Mrs Watkins, as she was running to our store.  He dropped
instantly.  Alexander and others mounted in the gable ander the roof, and from there was done most of our firing, it being the best place of observation.<br>
<br>
In the meantime we were barricading in the store, making portholes and firing when opportunity presented.  But the Indians were soon very cautious about exposing themselves.  I took charge of the store, Dan (Bradford) of the second floor, and Alexander of the garret and roof.<br>
<br>
The steamer Mary was lying in the mouth of Mill creek, and the wind was blowing hard down stream.<br>
<br>
When we saw the Indians running toward her, and heard the shots, we supposed she would be taken, and as she lay just out of our sight, and we saw smoke rising from her, concluded she was burning; but what was our glad surprise after awhile to see her put out and run across the river.<br>
<br>
I will give an account of the attack on her hereinafter.  The Indians now returned in force to us, and we gave every one a shot who showed himself.  They were nearly naked, painted red, and had guns and bows and arrows.  After a while Finley came creeping around  the lower point of the island to our house.  We -halloed to him to lie down behind a rock and he did so.<br>
<br>
He called that he could not get to the store, as the bank above us was covered with Indians.  He saw while there Watkins' house burning.  The Indians first took out all- they wanted, blankets, clothes, guns, etc.<br>
<br>
By this time the Indians had crossed in canoes to the island, and we saw them coming, as we supposed after Finley.  We then saw Wat@-ins and Bailey running around <B>tlie </B>river side toward the place where <B>Finley </B>was, the Indians in full chase after them.<br>
<br>
As our men came round the point in full view, Bailey was shot through his arm and leg.  He continued on, and, plunging into the river, swam to the front of our store, and came in safely except for his wounds.  He narrowly escaped going over the falls.  Finley also swam across and got in unharmed, which was wonderful, as there was a shower of bullets around them.<br>
<br>
Watkins came next running around the point, and we called to him to lay down behind a rock, but before he could do so he was shot in the wrist, the ball going up the arm and out above the elbow.  He dropped behind a rock just as the pursuing Indians came following around the point, but we gave them so hot a reception from our house that they backed out and left poor Watkins where he lay.
We called to Watkins to lie still and we would get him off, but we were unable to do so until after the arrival from The Dalles of the steamer Mary with troops -two days and nights afterwards.<br>
<br>
During this time Watkins fainted several times from weakness and exposure, the weather being very cold, and he was stripped for swimming down to his underclothes.  When he fainted he would roll down the steep bank into the river, and the ice-cold water reviving him, he would crawl back under fire, to his retreat behind the rock.<br>
<br>
Meantime his wife and children were in the store, in full view, and moaning piteously at his terrible situation.  He died from ex-
haustion two days after he was rescued.<br>
<br>
The Indians were now pitching into us right smart.  They tried to burn us out; threw rocks and firebrands, hot irons, pitchwood - everything that would burn-on the roof.  But you will recollect that for a short distince back the bank inclined toward the house, and we could see and shoot the Indians who appeared there.<br>
<br>
So they had to throw from such a distance that the largest rocks and bundles of fire did not quite reach us, and what did generally rolled-, off the roof.  Sometimes the roof got on fire and we cut it out, or, with cups of brind drawn from pork barrels, put it out, or with long sticks shoved off the fire balls.<br>
<br>
The kitchen roof troubled us the most.  How they did pepper us with rocks; some of the big ones would shake the house all over.<br>
<br>
There were forty men, women and children in the house-four women and eighteen men that could fight, and eighteen wounded men and children.<br>
<br>
The steamer Wasco was on the Oregon side of the river.  We saw her steam @1D and leave for The Dalles.  Shortly alter the. steamer Mary also left.  She had to take Atwell's fence rails for wood.<br>
<br>
So passed the day, during which the Indians had burned Iman's two houses, and the lumber yard at the mouth of Mill creek.<br>
<br>
At daylight they set fire to our new warehouse on the island, making it light as day around us.  I suppose they reserved this building for night, that we might not get Watkins off.  They did not attack us at night, but the second morning commenced as lively as ever.  We had no water, but did have about two dozen bottles of ale and a few bottles of. whisky.<br>
<br>
These gave out during the day.  During the night a Spokane Indian who was traveling with Sinclair, and was in the store with us,
volunteered to get a pail of water from the river.  I consented and he stripped himself naked, jumped out and down the bank, and was back in no time.<br>
<br>
By this time we looked for the steamer from The Dalles, and wete greatly disappointed at her non@arrival.  We weathered it out during the day, every man keeping his post and never relaxing in vigilance.  Every moving object, shadow or suspicious bush, on the hill received a shot.  The Indians must have thought the house a bombshell.<br>
<br>
Night came again and saw Sheppard's house burn; Bush's house, near by, was also fired, and kept us in light until about 4 A. M., when, -darkness returning, I sent the Spokane Indian for water from the river, and he filled two barrels.  He went to and fro like lightning.  We also slipped poor James Sinclair's body down the slide, outside, as the corpse was quite offensive.<br>
<br>
The two steamers now having exceeded the length of time we gave them in which to return from The Dalles we made up our minds for a long siege, and, until relief came from below.  We could not account for it, but supposed the Ninth regiment had left The Dalles for Walla Walla, and had proceeded too far to return.<br>
<br>
The third morning, and lo! the Mary and the Wasco, blue with soldiers and towing a flatboat, with dragoon horses' hove in sight.  Such a hallo as we gave.  As the steamers landed the Indians fired twenty or thirty shots into them, but we could not ascertain with iny effect.  The oldiers, as they got ashore, could not be -restrained, and plunged into the woods in every direction, while the howitzers sent grape into the now-retreating redskins.<br>
<br>
The soldiers were soon at our store, and we, I think I may say, experienced quite a feeling of relief on opening our doors.  During this time we had not heard from below.  A company of dragoons, under Colonel Steptoe, went down.  Dan went with them.  The blockhouse at Middle Cascades still held out.<br>
<br>
Allen's house was burned, and every, other one below.  George W. Johnson's,, S. M. Hamilton's, F. A. t:henoweth's the wharfboat at Lower Cascades-all gone up.<br>
<br>
Next in order comes the attack on the Mary.  She lay in Mill creek-no fires and the wind hard ashore.<br>
<br>
Jim Thompson, John Woodard, Jim Herman were just going up to the boat from our store, and had nearly reached her when fired upon.  Herman asked if they had any guns.  No. He went on up to Iman's
house, the rest staying to ' help get the steamer out.  Captain Dan Baughman, and Thompson were ashore on the upper side of the creek, hauling. on lines.  When the fire from the Tndia'ns became too hot they ran for the woods.  The fireman, Tames Linsley was shot through<br>
the shoulder.<br>
<br>
Engineer  Buckminster shot an Indian on the gangplank with his revolver, and little Johnny Chance, Watkins' stepson, climbing up on the hurricane deck with an old dragoon pistol, killed his Indian.<br>
Johnny was shot through the leg in doing so.  Dick Turpin-half crazy, probably-taking the only gun on the steamboat, jumped into a flatboat lying alongside, was shot, and jumped overboard and was drowned.  Fires were soon started under her boiler and steam was rising.<br>
<br>
About this time Jesse Kempton, shot while driving an ox team from the saw mill, got on board; also a half-breed named Bourbon, who  was shot through the body.  After sufficient steam to move was raised, Hardin Chenoweth ran up into the pilot-house, and, lying on the floor, turned the wheel as he was directed from the lower deck.<br>
<br>
It is almost needless to say that the pilot house was the target for the Indians.  Afer the steamer was fairly backed out and turned around, he did toot that whistle at them good.  Toot I toot! tootl It was music in our ears.  The steamer picked up Herman on the bank above.  Iman's family, Sheppard and Vanderpool, all got across the river in skiffs, and, boarding the Mary, went to The Dalles.<br>
<br>
Col.  George Wright and the Ninth regiment First dragoons, Third artillery, had started for Walla Walla and were out five miles, camped.  They received news of the attack at 11 P. M., and by daylight were badk to The Dalles.  Starting down they only reached Wind mountain that night, as the Mary's boiler was in bad order because of a new fireman the day before.<br>
<br>
They reached us the next moming at 6 A. M.,<br>
<br>
Now for below.  George Johnson was about to get a boat's crew of Indians, when Indian Jack came running to him, saying the Yakimas had attacked the blockhouse.  He did not believe it, although he heard the cannon.  He went up to the Indian village on the sandbar to get his crew; saw some of the Cascade Indians. who said they thought the Yakimas had come and George, now hearing the muskets', ran home.  E. W. Baughman was with him.<br>
<br>
Bill Murphy had left the blockhouse early for the Indian camp, and had nearly returned before he saw the Indians or was shot at.  He returned, two others with him, and ran for George Johnson's, about thirty Indians in chase.  After reaching Johnson's Murphy continued
on, and gave Hamilton and all below warning, and the families embarked in small boats for Vancouver.<br>
<br>
The men would have barricaded in the wharfboat but for want of ammunition.  There was   considerable government freight in the wharfboat.They stayed about the wharfboat and schooner nearly all day, and until the Indians commenced firing on them from the zinc house on the bank.  Then they shoved out.<br>
<br>
Tommy Price was shot through the leg in getting the boat into the stream.  Floating down they met the steamer Belle, with Sheridan and forty men, sent up on report of an express carried down by Indian Simpson in the morning.  George and those with him went on board the steamer and volunteered to serve under Sheridan, who landed at Sheridan's place and found everything burned.<br>
<br>
The steamer returned and the Indians pitched into Sheridan, fought him all day, and drove him with forty men and ten volunteers, to below Hamilton's, notwithstanding he had a small cannon; one soldier killed.<br>
<br>
The steamer Belle returned next day (third of the attack), and <B>brought</B>  ammunition for the blockhouse.  Your partner, Bishop, who was in  Portland, came up on ber.  Steamer Fashion, with volunteers from Portland, came at the same time.  The volunteers remained at the Lower Cascades.  Sheridan ook his comand, and with a batteau loaded with ammunition, crossed to Bradford's island, on the Oregon side where they found most of the Cascade Indians, they having been advised by George Johnson to go there on the first day of the attack.<br>
<br>
They were crossing and recrossing all the time, and Sheridan made them prisoners.  He pressed a boat's crew, and,,as they towed up to the head of the island and above, saw great numbers of Indians on the Washington territory side and opposite them.  Sheridan expected them to cross and fight him, and between them and the friendly (?) Indians in his charge, thought he had his hands full.<br>
<br>
Just then Sheridan discovered Steptoe and his dragoons, infantry and volunteers, coming down from the Marv. surprising completely the Indians who were cooking beef and watching Sheridan across the river.  But on the sound of the bugle the Indians rushed like deer to the woods, with the loss of only one killed-"Old Joanum."<br>
<br>
But for the bugle they ought to have captured fifty.<br>
<br>
So ended the battle.  The Ninth regiment are building a blockhouse on the hill above tis, also at Geor@e Johnson's, and will hereafter keep a strong force here.<br>
<br>
Lieut.  Bissell and twelve men who were stationed at the Upper
Cascades were ordered away and left for The Dalles two days before the attack was made upon us.<br>
<br>
The Indians Sheridan took <B>on </B>the island were closely guarded and sentenced to be hung' The Cascade Indians, being under Old  Chenowith (chief), were brought before Col. Wright, tried and were adjudged guilty of treason in fighting.  Chenoweth died game; was hung on the upper side of Mill creek.<br>
<br>
I acted as interpreter.  He offered ten horses, two squaws and a  little something to every "tyee" of his life; said he was afraid of the grave in the ground, and begged to be put into an Indian dead-house.  He gave a terrific warwhoop while the rope was being put around his neck. thought he expected the Indians to come and rescue him.<br>
<br>
The rope did not work well, and while hanging he muttered, "Wake nike quash copa memaloose!' He was then shot.  I was glad to see the old devil killed, being satisfied that he was at the bottom of all the trouble, But I cannot detail at too great length.<br>
<br>
The next day "Tecomeoc" and "Captain Jo" were hung.  Captain ' Jo said all th,e Cascade Indians were in the fight.  The next day "Toy...... Sim Lasselas" and "Four-Fingered Johnny" were hung.  The Next day "Chenoweth Jim," "Tumtah" and "Old Skein" were hung, and "Kanewake" sentenced, but reprieved on the scaffold.  Nine in all were executed.  "Banaha" is t)risoner at Vancouver, and decorated wi@h ball and chain.  The rest of the Cascade Indians @tre on your island and will be shot if seen off of it.  Such are Colonel Wright's orders.  "Dow," "Watiquin," "Peter," "Mahooka John" and "Kotzue, maybe  more, have  gone  with  the  Yakimas.<br>
<br>
I forgot to mention that your house at the Lower Cascades, also Bishop's, was burned; also to account for Capt.  Dan Baughman and Jim Thompson.  They put back into the mountains, and at night came down to the River at Vanderpool's place, fished up an old boat, and crossed to the Oregon side.<br>
<br>
They concealed themselves in the rocks on the river bank opposite, where they could watch us, and at night went back into the mountains to sleep.  They came in safely after the troops arrived.<br>
We do not know how many Indians there were.  They attacked the blockhouse, our place and drove Sheridan all at the same time.<br>
<br>
We think there was no less than <B>200 </B>Or 300.  When the attack was made on us three of our carpenters ran for the middle blockhouse, overtook the cars at the salmon house, cut the mules loose, and with the car drivers, all kept on.<br>
<br>
They were not fired upon until they got to the spring on the railroad, but from there they ran the gauntlet of bullets and arrows to the fort.  Little Jake Kyle was killed in the run.  Several were wounded.
This is a long letter; but, knowing you would be anxious to hear all the particulars, I have endeavored to give you a true description.  Dan is writing to others at home, and has read this letter.  We<br>
<B>have </B>got  to  work  again,  building   and length.    transporting;  are  going  to  <B>build  </B>a  saw mill as soon as we can.  We had but few poor specimens of men here during the fight-generally all behaved well.  There was, however, one notable exception, a person who arrived at the store a few minutes before the fight commenced -and whose name I will give you in person.<br>
<br>
Am a little bit afraid to go to Rock creek to fish, in fact have had no time so far.  Don't think I shall have much fishing this summer.  Wish you were back.  Yours,<br>

CASCADES BATTLE.<br>
<br>
Robert Williams, "Cascades Battle," <B>Oregon Native Son.</B> I(February, 1900) p. 501-505.<br>
<br>
Robert Williams, who was one of the detail of eight men under Sergt.  Kelly from Company H, left at the Middle Blockhouse by Capt. Wallen, and who helped to make the gallant defense there, against the Indian attack, writes as follows:<br>
<br>
The following is an account of the defense of the middle blockhouse: I was the first person who suspected that the Indians were preparing for mischief.  I discovered the same on the day previous to the attack, while carrying a message from Mr. Griswold, who lived at the Middle Cascades, to Mr. Hamilton, who lived on a farm a little below the landing at the Lower Cascades.  The mess age was for Mr. Hamilton to bring up immediately a yoke of oxen which Mr. Griswold had purchased of him, and also to hitch them to one of a lot of new government wagons that were at the landing and bring it up also.<br>
<br>
Mr. Hamilton started on his mission the next morning, but learned that the Indians had broken out on the warpath.  He abandoned his wagon and hastily returned to warn his neighbors and seek safety for himself and family.<br>
<br>
In passing each way by the Indian camp, as I had to do in going to and from carrying the message, my attention was particularly attracted at seeing the majority of the Indians standing together in
council and dressed in warlike cos<B>tumes, </B>while some few were playing at a game resembling shinny.<br>
<br>
Their actions were suspicious and confirmed the belief that they were planning mischief.  The movements of some of them in particu-
lar, going in a half-circle through the timber, thus to flank me, awakened in my mind a very strong suspicion that they were trying to catch me to kill me.<br>
<br>
I did not show to them any evidence that I suspicioned them of doing me harm, but after I got past their camp and out of their sight I hurried with my utmost speed for the blockhouse, and then told Sergeant Kelly and my other comrades of my suspicions.  But by reason of our belief in .<br>
<br>
The strength of our position, few as there were of us, we did not dread any danger from the Indians, or even think any more about it, for, during the whole of the night previous to the attack, six out of the nine of us there and an old German, H. Kyle, were drinking whisky toddy and telling army stories, the old German raking an active part in the sport, and claiming to be one of Blucher's Waterloo veterans, but none 6f them got drunk.<br>
<br>
The next morning the sergeant permitted Frederick Bernatir to go to the Upper Cascades for a canteen full of whisky; but, unfortunately for him, the Indians had commenced their attack on the blockhouse before he returned, preventing him from getting back to us.  They shot him through both legs.<br>
<br>
He managed, however, to get to the bank of the river, and there hide from sight. He fainted several times from loss of blood, but the whiskey he had in his canteen supported his strength.  When night came on he left his hiding place and got in safety to the blockhouse, where he received a joyful welcome, for we all thought he was killed.<br>
<br>
When the attack first began nearly all of the men in the detachment were scattered around in the vicinity.  There were but three of us in close proximity to the blockhouse, Sheridan, the cook, McManus and myself.<br>
<br>
We all heard the shooting, but, strange to affirm, even after what I saw the day previous, I, nor the other two, had even the least suspicion that we were attacked by Indians.  My first feeling at such an unusual occur rence was that of indignation at such foolish conduct, thinking that some person was firing off his revolver.  But the cook quickly found what was the matter, and imediately gave the alarm by crying "Indians!'<br>
<br>
McManus and myself werstanding close together -tear the blockhouse, and on the instant the alarm was given we cast our eyes towards the hills and timber which closely surrounded us in front, and then we beheld to our horror the painted and half-naked savage exultantly firing upon all they could see.  McManus, who stood by my side, was
shot in the groin.  He died shortly after, in the army hospital at Vancouver from its effects.  I truthfully confess that when.<br>
<br>
I beheld the savages engaged in their bloody work, and my comrade by my side fatally shot, I felt for a few moments as if my hair was lifting off my head.  Then my thoughts instantly reverted to the great peril I had escaped the day before, the panoramic view of which will ever remain stamped on my memory.  My wounded comrade and myself lost no time in getting inside the blockhouse.<br>
<br>
I then quickly got on my accoutrements and gun, and immediately commenced the defense.  The incessant firing and racket of the Indians gave unmistakable warning of deadly danger to those of my comrades who were strolling around.  They all got to the blockhouse in saftey, except Laurence Rooney, who was so unfortunate as to be captured upon the hill while cutting wood.<br>
<br>
The two or three unfortunate families who were living near the blockhouse ran to it with all their might for the safety of their lives, but several of them were severely wounded in rtinning the gauntlet.  We had altogetlier with us three killed and seven wounded.<br>
<br>
Among the former was Mr. George Griswold, who might have escaped his death but for the over-confidence in the friendliness of the Indians towards <B>him,</B> and his standing in view and waving to the Indians to cease <B>firiig, </B>thinking all the time they were the Cascade Indians, whom he well knew, and not suspecting that there was a large force of hostile Yakimas among-them.<br>
<br>
The German boy, Jake Kyle, mentioned in Mr. Coe's narrative, was killed while riding on horseback down the road on the hill, about 100 yards in front of the blockhouse.<br>
<br>
The Indian that shot him stood by the side of a tree close to the. road, his gun almost reaching the poor boy, who fell instantly upon being shot.  It was an agonizing sight to me to see the poor, unconscious boy writhing -in deadly agony for several hours.  -
Sometimes he would endeavor to sit up, but each attempt provoked the Indians 'to shoot arrows into him.<br>
<br>
'Jehu Switzler" and Tom McDowell (both well known in Vancouver), and another man to me before unknown, were on their way from the Upper to the Lower Cascades, but before they had proceeded far the@ discovered nostile Indians.  Being unarmed they made a desperate effort to reach the blockhouse, and providentially did, in safety, but fatigued.  They proved a valuable acquisition to our small force.  The three gallantly aided us during the defense in all duties assigned to them to do.<br>
<br>
After they had got in the door  was made secure by -a bolt and a strong chain.<br>
That being completed we prepared, in terrible earnest, for the uneven and deadly conflict by giving our savage enemies a treat of canister shot, fourteen rounds in all, from our six-pounder gun, which finally made them precipitately retreat for better shelter.  We sent after them a few shells for a change.  They, however, returned to their first position to pay their respects to us again.<br>
<br>
But by this time they had learned our mettle, and wisely concluded that they could not whip us; so they retired behind the hill out of the range of our guns, to torture .and put to a horrible death our unfortunate comrade, Laurence Rooncy, whom they had captured.  We could not see them at it, but we heard our comrade's piercing screams.  After they had accomplished that last inhuman and dia-
bolical cruelty, the main portion left and went to the Lower Cascades.<br>
<br>
The outrages which they did there are fully narrated in Mr. . Coe's narrative.  They, however, left enough behind to besiege us at the blockhouse.  But they did not offer to fight us any more, consequently our little party deemed it advisable, if possible, before night came on, to make an effort to get food and water.<br>
<br>
I instantly volunteered to do so.  The sergeant -willingly consented to my going.<br>
<br>
The stranger who joined our force with - Switzler and McDowell gallantly volunteered to go with me in search of whatever we could find to sustain life.  Our companions in the blockhouse were meanwhile watching with guns in hand, ready to defend us to the utmost of their ability if Occasion offered.<br>
<br>
But, luckily, we were not molested.  I went through a window into Mr. Griswold's house, and, to my great joy, I found a dishpan full of excellent doughnuts.  I then handed them to my companion on the outside to take them to the blockhouse, which he did, to the great delight of all.<br>
<br>
In the meantime I discovered in the pantry a fine large ham, which, with the doughnuts, sufficed to relieve all the pangs of hunger.  But we failed to get water., So ended the first day's transaction.  But still on constant vigilance by day and night it was necessary to depend for the safety of ourselves until we could get assistance, which came on the morning of the third day of the siege.<br>
<br>
The second day the Indians were still besieging us and thus preventing us from getting the precious elixir, water, which by that time all of us greatly needed, especially the wounded.<br>
But close by there was -a small saloon, owned and kept by one of the Palmer brothers, who, with his brother-who kept a store at the foot of the hill by the river bank-luckily made their escape immeiiately after the Indians made their attack, locking the doors of both buildings before they left.  
My army comrade, William Houser, suggested that somebody, should be allowed to go to the saloon and get whatever they might find to alleviate hunger and thirst.  I seconded the motion.  Sergeant Kelly then permitted him and me to go.<br>
<br>
The door being locked my comrade had to break it open with an ax.  We procured within one dozen bottles of English porter, one decanter of brandy, the same of whisky and wine, and a small box full of oyster crackers.  We failed to get water, but the articles mentioned satisfied every requiremnt, except surgical aid, until we could get relief, which we knew was close at hand, by hearing the report of gallant Phil. Sheridan's guns, firing upon the enemy at the Lower Cascades.<br>
<br>
After that signal of relief, we all relaxed the ceaseless vigilance we had <B>all </B>the time kept, for the purpose of allowing a portion of our guards to take a little rest and sleep.  We were greatly favored at night during the siege by the service of a vicious bulldog of one of neighbors rendered to us. He barked and gave warning to us of anyattempt the Indians made to get toward the blockhouse.<br>
<br>
If they had been allowed to get close enough to the building, tiley would, without doubt, have tried to burn it, by throwing burning pitchwood upon the roof.<br>
<br>
The next morning Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Edward J. Steptoe, Ninth United States Infantry, commanding companies A, E, F and L, same regiment, and detatchment of company E, First dragoons, and company L, Third artilery, in all 200 men and officers, came to our relief.<br>
<br>
The sergeant told them how we had made the defense, and the colonel then complimented all of us for our admirable conduct.  Now that relief had come the citizens who had taken refuge with us left for their homes and destinations, we soldiers also went where our fancies directed, and to examine, in particular if we could find traces of injury that we had done to the Indians.<br>
<br>
We failed to see any signs of blood, but my comrade with me, Hiram Smiley, found the body of Laurence Rooney, our murdered companion, horribly mutilated and entirely stripped of his clothing, and the cordwood he had been cutting piled on top of him.<br>
<br>
His murderers had first hung him with willow rope, the same being left around his neck; they had also mashed his face with the ax he had worked with.  We now called out to our other comrades to bring up a blanket and carry the body down to the blockhouse, where we soon made a rude box and placed the remains therein.<br>
<br>
Colonel Steptoe - and his command proceded on towards the Lower Cas-
cades in quest of the hostile renegades, and about one mile and a half below the blockhoue met Lieutenant Sheridan and his small command, just as they had crossed the river from the Oregon side to come to the relief of the blockhouse.  But being that it had been
relieved, he advised Colonel Steptoe to let him go back to the island he had just left and capture all the Cascade Indians there or that would get there after being abandoned by the fleeing Yakimas.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Alexander Piper, Third artillery, of Colonel Steptoe's command was permitted to accompany him, and took along a mountain howitzer.  All the Indians on the island were made prisoners.  Nine of the principal guilty miscreants that participated in the attack and massacre at the blockhouse were tried by a military commission and hung, as stated by Mr. Coe.<br>
<br>
After accomplishing that duty, Lieutenant Sheridan and his command returned to Fort Vancouver, taking with them the remains of our murdered comrade for burial at the military cemetery.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I deem it due justice to all those who shared the protection of the little garrison, men, women and children, to say that they showed courage and fortitude worthy of admriation, for which we soldiers were duly thankful, as such noble, uncomplaining conduct encouraged us, and, moreover, gave us perfect liberty to perform our duties.<br>
<br>
To our decimated command of only five men and a sergeant was intrusted the important duty of guarding those murderous savages captured on the island, who received trial and execution, which, after having undergone the hardships of the siege and loss of sleep and rest, was indeed a hard duty for us to perform.  But, considering the terrible torture and death which would have been our fate liad we been caught, and in reverse circtimstances, we did all our duty without the least feeling of complaint.<br>
<br>
But at the end of two days we were relieved of <B>the </B>command by an officer of the Ninth infantry (I think Lieutenant Harvey), who had under his command a detachment of twelve men.  A few days afterward we were sent to join our company at Vancouver.  Thus ends the history of the siege and defense of the middle blockhouse<br>

<br>
Nothing of importance transpired until the Spring of 1856 when Colonel Wright came to The Dalles with the Ninth Infantry and took command.  On March 10th, Colonel Wright, with his command started to the Walla Walla country.  They camped at Ten Mile creek and the next morning the express brought news to the colonel that the town of Cascades was surrounded by Indians and the command marched back to
The Dalles, went down on the old steamer Halso to the Cascades and landed at the old block house.<br>
<br>
The dead and wounded and the living were all in the blockhouse wait-
ing for the soldiers to relieve them, and the place was surrounded by Indians.  When they saw the soldiers land they soon left and did not bother again.<br>
<br>
The command remained at the Cascades for some time, scouting the entire comuntry, and in that way learned that all the Indians had left for the Yakima country.  The command went from there to The Dalles again and from there to the Yakima country.  Centering here the country was scouted in all directions, but nothing was accomplished in bringing the Indians to terms.<br>

CASCADES BATTLE.<br>
<br>
Clinton Snowden, "Cascades Battle," <B>History of Washington.</B> New York: Century Publishing Company, 1909, Volume III p. 452-462.<br>
<br>
Colonel George Wright's leisurely preparations (for an expedition into Eastern Washington Territory) were suddenly expedited, early in March, by an attack by a band of Klikitats, on a small settlement at the mouth of White Salmon River.  No one was killed at this time, but a considerable number of cattle were stolen and driven away.<br>
<br>
Learning of this raid Wright dispatched Lieutenant-Colonel Steptoe, with two companies of the 9th regiment, to relieve the invaded settlement, and two other companies intended for the Walla Walla expedition soon followed.  On the i ith Colonel Wright himself arrived at the Dalles, and established his headquarters there.<br>
<br>
All the soldiers at Fort Rains, except ten, were withdrawn, and there being no indications of trouble in the neighborhood, the four companies, with Wright in command, moved out from the Dalles toward Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
As soon as they were safely gone, on the morning of March 26th, these settlements at the upper, lower and middle Cascades, were simultaneously attacked by a large band of Indians.  Kam-i-ah-kan had apparently collected all his warriors from the Yakima Valley, and prepared to attack the settlements as soon as Wright should pass up the river.<br>
<br>
Now supposing that he had gone with his entire command, his warriors, who had been hidden in the timber on the high banks as he went by, made ready for their bloody work.  As is usually the
case in an Indian attack, no warning was given; the men at the upper, lower and middle Cascades were about their usual employments, in the mills, on the wharves, and along the tramway, and the little steamers Mary and Wasco were lying at their moorings, without the fires yet having been lighted in their furnaces, when the first shots were fired.<br>
<br>
One of the men at work on the tramway was killed at the first fire, and most of the others fled to Bradford's store, though three of them went in the other direction to the blockhouse, a mile and a half distant.  A rain of bullets fell about them as they ran, the high ground back of the river seeming to be covered with Indians, who were now yelling like fiends.  Two families near the store also hurried to it for refuge.<br>
<br>
A boy living with one of these was shot, as he was leaving the house, and James Sinclair, from Fort Walla Walla, was killed at the store door, while encouraging those who were running toward it.  He was struck by a bullet in the head and killed instantly.<br>
<br>
As soon as all who were hurrying to the store had reached it, the doors were closed and barricaded.  Fortunately nine government muskets, with ammunition, had been left in the place for shipment, as the troops passed up the river, and these were the salvation of the party.<br>
<br>
The building was but a poor protection against an Indian attack, but it was hurriedly put in as good condition as possible for defense.  There was no one in the upper story,, and the stairway was outside.  As it was desirable to reach the upper floor and none dared attempt to go by the stairway, the stove was removed, and the hole through the floor enlarged with saws and axes, and the whole party transferred through it to the upper part of the building.<br>
<br>
Here loopholes were made, the muskets brought into use, and the besieged soon had the satisfaction of seeing that their fire was effective.  Wherever an Indian showed himself within range, he was either killed or forced to seek shelter.<br>
<br>
As soon as possible after the battle began those on board the steamers kindled their fires and began to get up steam.  The Wasco was on the Oregon side of the river and the wind, which was blowing a gale at the time, was in her favor.  She easily got away and left for the Dalles.  The Mary was at the wharf near the store, and the Indians made a rush for her, regarding her no doubt as an easy prey.  But the few men on board had now got their fires started, and, seizing such arms as were at hand, gave their assailants a warm welcome.<br>
The captain and one of the men attempted to throw off the lines, but the bullets were flying so thick .1 about them that they were compelled for a time to desist.  The fireman was shot through the shoulder, while another man; who had seized a gun and jumped to a flatboat lying alongside, was shot and fell overboard.  The engineer shot an Indian with his revolver, who had reached the gangplank and was already coming on board, while another was shot with an old dragoon pistol, in the hands of a man who had climbed on the upper deck.<br>
<br>
By this time steam was up, and after taking two wounded men on board-a white men who had been driving an ox team, and a half-breed who was shot through the body, the lines were cast off and the boat steamed out into the river.  Those in the store saw her leave with rejoicing, for they knew that in time she would bring them help.<br>
<br>
While the boats were getting away three men, named Watkins, Finlay and Bailey, who were at work on a new warehouse, attempted to reach the store.  Those inside first saw Finlay coming toward them, and called to him to lie down behind a rock, for the bank above him was covered with Indians, for whose rifles he was an easy mark.  He had scarcely taken shelter when the other two men appeared, running toward Finlay's place of refuge, with a troop of Indians following.<br>
<br>
There was nothing for the three to do now but make their best efforts to run the gauntlet of the Indian rifles to the store.  This they started to do.  Bailey was shot through the arm and leg, and plunging into the river swam to the front of the store, which he reached without further injury.  Watkins was hit by a bullet in the wrist, shattering his forearm to the elbow.  His pursuers were close upon him, but those in the store poured such a hot fire upon them, from their nine muskets, that they were glad to seek cover.<br>
<br>
Watkins took shelter behind a rock which offered its protection, and was compelled to remain there until the battle ended, two days and nights afterward.  During this time he fainted several times from cold, exposure and the pain of his wound.  When he fainted he would roll down the bank into the river, which would revive him and he would then crawl up the bank again to his hidin place.  Meantime his wife and children were in the store, and almost frantic because they could do nothing to help or relieve him.  He died two days later.<br>
<br>
During the two days that intervened before the steamer brought the troops to the rescue, the battle was continued almost without interruption.  There were forty men, women and children in Bradford's store, and several of them were wounded.  Eighteen of the men and four of the women could and did fight bravely and almost continuously.  The Indians made repeated efforts to set the building, and others near it, on fire by throwing flaming brands and
hot rocks on them from the high bluff behind.<br>
<br>
Sometimes these were pushed off with long sticks and sometimes when this could not be done, and the roof began to take fire, the burning place was cut out, or the fire was quenched by cups of brine from a pork barrel, or a blazing board was pushed off and thrown so far away as to be no longer dangerous.<br>
<br>
The besieged party suffered gready for water during the first day of the battle.  There was in the store two dozen bottles of ale, and a few bottles of whisky, but these were soon used up by forty persons.  During the night a Spokane Indian, who was with Sinclair, volunteered to go to the river for water, and was hailed as a deliverer.  Stripping himself almost naked he ran down to the river, filled his pail and was back in a moment.<br>
<br>
On the following night he filled four barrels in a similar way, and the party suffered no longer from thirst, while their fear of fire was greatly relieved.<br>
<br>
As soon as it was dark and the first day's fighting began to lull, the Indians set fire to all the buildings they could approach, without coming within range of the muskets inside the store.  These were never idle. Every moving object within range of the building, day or night, was fired at and many times with good effect, as there was reason to believe.  For two full days and nights the men and women in this party kept their assailants at bay only by their utmost vigilance, and,those who could not shoot, or fight fire, were<br>
abundantly occupied in caring for the wounded and for the children.<br>
<br>
While they were thus engaged the nine soldiers in the blockhouse, a mile and a half away, at the middle Cascades, were not less busily employed.  Sergeant Kelly, who was in charge, had been suspicious that something was wrong for several days previously, from seeing some Indians, who were camped near by, and who were supposed to be friendly, wearing more paint than was their custom, and noting that they made frequent visits to the timber on the bluffs.<br>
<br>
On the morning he had sent one of the men to the upper Cascades for a canteen of whisky- He had procured it and was returning along'the tramway, when the firing began.  At the first fire he was shot through both legs, but managed to hide under the river bank until night, when he crawled to the blockhouse.  Only three soldiers and the cook had been inside the defense when the first shots were fired.<br>
<br>
The others were walking up or down the river at a considerable distance, not suspecting that the Indians were near.  Even when they heard the firing at Bradford's store they did not suppose it had been attacked.<br>
<br>
But the Indian bullets soon began to strike the blockhouse, and a soldier standing just outside was struck and mortally wounded.  The other soldiers and the two or three families living near by soon came running in.  All the soldiers reached shelter in safety save one, who was on the hill cutting wood and was captured.  That night he was put to death by torture, and his comrades could hear his screams and agonizing groans without being able to render him the slightest assistance.  Several of the men, women and children who ran the gauntlet between their homes and the blockhouse were wounded.<br>
<br>
One of these, George Griswold, might have escaped but for his confidence that the Indians knew and would not hurt him.  His wound was mortal and he died soon after.  A boy who had been sent down the river with a message, just before the attack was made, -was struck by a bullet and disabled when within sight of the blockhouse.  He lived for several hours after.<br>
<br>
Occasionally he would make an effort to rise, or beckon the soldiers to help him if they could, and would immediately be made a mark for many Indian rifles and arrows.  The three men, who ran from Bradford's when the firing began, reached the blockhouse in safety, and became a valuable reinforcement to its defenders.  With their rifles and the howitzer, for which they had fourteen rounds of ammunition, they made an active fight, from which the Indians retired near the close of the first day, but renewed the battle on the second, though without inflicting any further injury.<br>
This party like that at Bradford's suffered greatly for both food and water during these two days.<br>
<br>
Those at the lower Cascade suffered less during the fight than their neighbors.  They were warned by the firing, particularly of the howitzer at the blockhouse, in time to barricade themselves in the strongest buildings, and were not attacked, except by their Indian neighbors, whom they had always, until now, regarded as friendly.<br>
<br>
Some of the families soon got away in small boats and escaped down the river to Vancouver, where they gdve the alarm.  Only one man was wounded.  He was shot while attempting tO push a boat out into the stream, but was not dangerously hurt.<br>
<br>
The two little steamers which had been got away from their moorings amid so much excitement on the first morning of the battle, did not return as quickly as they were hoped for, but on the morning of the second day the steamer Belle arrived at the lower Cascade, bringing Lieutenant Phil.  Sheridan, who had left Vancouver at 2 o'clock on the morning of the 27th, with about forty dragoons, and a small cannon, which he had borrowed from a San Francisco steamer, which at the time was at the dock unloading military supplies.<br>
<br>
Only a narrow place was found for a landing, but on this the
troopers disembarked, and Sheridan, with five or six of them, stole forward, under cover of some underbrush, to observe the Indian position.  When they emerged from the shelter of the  brush,  they  were  greeted with a shower of bullets, one of which grazed Sheridan's nose, and killed a soldier standing by his side.  The remainder of the command soon came up, but the position was such that they could do little.<br>
<br>
The borrowed cannon was brought up, and used to send a number of solid shot into the jungle to which the Indians had retired, and where they lay concealed, but seemingly without much effect.<br>
<br>
This place was held until evening when Sheridan found means to transfer his force to the south bank of the river, along which he intended to march to a point opposite the blockhouse, and then cross to its relief.  The undertaking would be hazardous, but it seemed to be the only means that promised to accomplish anything, and if the besieged parties were not rescued soon they would probably starve Dr be killed.<br>
<br>
So on the morning of the 28th, after giving the savages a few more shots from the cannon, the party Withdrew to the river bank, embarked in a boat which had been secured for the purpose, and transferred across the river, landing just below the end of Bradford's Island.  Here it was found necessary to tow the boat up stream-for it would be needed to recross it-and the. current was too swift for rowing.<br>
<br>
Ten men were assigned to this laborious task, and the remainder found their way, as best they could, along the south shore, to the place of rendezvous, opposite the blockhouse.  With the ten men Sheridan then crossed back to the island, along which the boat was dragged with much difficulty, although the current was not so swift as along the mainland.<br>
<br>
The undertaking was a precarious one.  Had the Indians discovered what was going on, and found means to cross.to the island, the ten soldiers and their commander would have been at their mercy.  But fortune favors the soldier who dares much, if he dares judiciously, and the enterprise succeeded.<br>
<br>
Both parties reached the upper end of the island, and were ferried across to the Washington side, just as Colonel Steptoe, with a part of Wright's command, which had been recalled and brought down the river by the steamers Otter and Mary, arrived.  The two forces were now united and the blockhouse was quickly relieved.<br>
<br>
Sheridan then recrossed to the island, while Steptoe, who had already rescued the beleaguered party at Bradford's store, marched down the north shore.  As was expected, Sheridan found the Indians who had pretended to be friendly until the hostiles arrived, on the
island, and captured the whole party.  They were very much frightened, and at first protested that they had taken no part in the fight, but when their guns were examined and found to have been very recently fired, they were disarmed and thirteen of them made prisoners.<br>
<br>
Ten of them were afterwards charged with treason-having violated their treaty-and nine of them were hanged by Colonel Wright's order, the tenth being reprieved on the gallows, and sent to<br>
Fort Vancouver, where, for a long time, he wore a ball and chain.<br>
During the three days of fighting at these three points, seventeen persons were killed and twelve wounded.<br>
<br>
The trails made by the Indians on their retreat were followed by the soldiers for ten miles, but they were not overtaken, nor was it ever ascertained w@at their loss had been in either killed or wounded.  From indications left about their camps, and along their lines of retreat, it was judged that from two to three hundred had joined in the attack.<br>
<br>
The body of the captured soldier, whom the Indians had put to the torture, during the first night of the siege, was recovered and buried.  It bore many evidences of the brutality of his captors: the face had been crushed by a blow with some blunt instrument the flesh on various parts of the body cut and burned, and death was finally inflicted by hanging with willow withes.<br>
<br>
Brutal and inhuman as the treatment of this poor captive was, it was even less shocking than another crime which was committed by some white monster in the neighborhood about the same time.<br>
<br>
A friendly Indian, known as Spencer, had been engaged by Wright as an interpreter, as he passed up the river.  When the troops were recalled by the attack on the Cascades this Indian, for some unknown reason, had started his wife, with their two half-grown boys, three younger girls and a babe, down the river to Fort Vancouver.  The veteran hunter and trapper Joe Meek had seen them start, and was at the time solicitous for their safety, but Spencer had confidence that his own friendly relations with the whites, which were widely known, would protect them.<br>
<br>
A day or two later Meek inquired of Sheridan about them, and as no one could be found who had seen them, search was made by the soldiers, and their dead bodies were found in the woods about a mile from the road, between the upper and lower landings.  All had been strangled, a piece of rope about two feet long being still tightly knotted about the neck of all save the babe, which had been strangled with its mother's handkerchief.<br>
<br>
"In my experience," says General Sheridan, "I have been obliged to look upon many cruel scenes, in connection with Indian warfare on
the plains since that 'day; but the effect of that dastardly and revolting crime has never been effaced from my memory.  " These poor creatures had been killed, as Sheridan thinks, by white people whose wives and children had been killed by hostiles, " but who well knew that these unoffending creatures had no part in these murders."<br>
<br>
Wright now remained at the Dalles for a month, during which time Wool paid him a hurried visit, and the plan of his campaign was materially changed.<br>

<br>
Colonel George Wright's leisurely preparations (for an expedition into Eastern Washington Territory) were suddenly expedited, early in March, by an attack by a band of Klikitats, on a small settlement at the mouth of White Salmon River.  No one was killed at this time, but a considerable number of cattle were stolen and driven away.<br>
<br>
Learning of this raid Wright dispatched Lieutenant-Colonel Steptoe, with two companies of the 9th regiment, to relieve the invaded settlement, and two other companies intended for the Walla Walla expedition soon followed.  On the i ith Colonel Wright himself arrived at the Dalles, and established his headquarters there.<br>
<br>
All the soldiers at Fort Rains, except ten, were withdrawn, and there being no indications of trouble in the neighborhood, the four companies, with Wright in command, moved out from the Dalles toward Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
As soon as they were safely gone, on the morning of March 26th, these settlements at the upper, lower and middle Cascades, were simultaneously attacked by a large band of Indians.  Kam-i-ah-kan had apparently collected all his warriors from the Yakima Valley, and prepared to attack the settlements as soon as Wright should pass up the river.<br>
<br>
Now supposing that he had gone with his entire command, his warriors, who had been hidden in the timber on the high banks as he went by, made ready for their bloody work.  As is usually the
case in an Indian attack, no warning was given; the men at the upper, lower and middle Cascades were about their usual employments, in the mills, on the wharves, and along the tramway, and the little steamers Mary and Wasco were lying at their moorings, without the fires yet having been lighted in their furnaces, when the first shots were fired.<br>
<br>
One of the men at work on the tramway was killed at the first fire, and most of the others fled to Bradford's store, though three of them went in the other direction to the blockhouse, a mile and a half distant.  A rain of bullets fell about them as they ran, the high ground back of the river seeming to be covered with Indians, who were now yelling like fiends.  Two families near the store also hurried to it for refuge.<br>
<br>
A boy living with one of these was shot, as he was leaving the house, and James Sinclair, from Fort Walla Walla, was killed at the store door, while encouraging those who were running toward it.  He was struck by a bullet in the head and killed instantly.<br>
<br>
As soon as all who were hurrying to the store had reached it, the doors were closed and barricaded.  Fortunately nine government muskets, with ammunition, had been left in the place for shipment, as the troops passed up the river, and these were the salvation of the party.<br>
<br>
The building was but a poor protection against an Indian attack, but it was hurriedly put in as good condition as possible for defense.  There was no one in the upper story,, and the stairway was outside.  As it was desirable to reach the upper floor and none dared attempt to go by the stairway, the stove was removed, and the hole through the floor enlarged with saws and axes, and the whole party transferred through it to the upper part of the building.<br>
<br>
Here loopholes were made, the muskets brought into use, and the besieged soon had the satisfaction of seeing that their fire was effective.  Wherever an Indian showed himself within range, he was either killed or forced to seek shelter.<br>
<br>
As soon as possible after the battle began those on board the steamers kindled their fires and began to get up steam.  The Wasco was on the Oregon side of the river and the wind, which was blowing a gale at the time, was in her favor.  She easily got away and left for the Dalles.  The Mary was at the wharf near the store, and the Indians made a rush for her, regarding her no doubt as an easy prey.  But the few men on board had now got their fires started, and, seizing such arms as were at hand, gave their assailants a warm welcome.<br>
The captain and one of the men attempted to throw off the lines, but the bullets were flying so thick .1 about them that they were compelled for a time to desist.  The fireman was shot through the shoulder, while another man; who had seized a gun and jumped to a flatboat lying alongside, was shot and fell overboard.  The engineer shot an Indian with his revolver, who had reached the gangplank and was already coming on board, while another was shot with an old dragoon pistol, in the hands of a man who had climbed on the upper deck.<br>
<br>
By this time steam was up, and after taking two wounded men on board-a white men who had been driving an ox team, and a half-breed who was shot through the body, the lines were cast off and the boat steamed out into the river.  Those in the store saw her leave with rejoicing, for they knew that in time she would bring them help.<br>
<br>
While the boats were getting away three men, named Watkins, Finlay and Bailey, who were at work on a new warehouse, attempted to reach the store.  Those inside first saw Finlay coming toward them, and called to him to lie down behind a rock, for the bank above him was covered with Indians, for whose rifles he was an easy mark.

There were forty men, women and children in Bradford's store, and several of them were wounded.  Eighteen of the men and four of the women could and did fight bravely and almost continuously.  The Indians made repeated efforts to set the building, and others near it, on fire by throwing flaming brands and
hot rocks on them from the high bluff behind.<br>
<br>
Sometimes these were pushed off with long sticks and sometimes when this could not be done, and the roof began to take fire, the burning place was cut out, or the fire was quenched by cups of brine from a pork barrel, or a blazing board was pushed off and thrown so far away as to be no longer dangerous.<br>
<br>
The besieged party suffered gready for water during the first day of the battle.

<br>
The two little steamers which had been got away from their moorings amid so much excitement on the first morning of the battle, did not return as quickly as they were hoped for, but on the morning of the second day the steamer Belle arrived at the lower Cascade, bringing Lieutenant Phil.  Sheridan, who had left Vancouver at 2 o'clock on the morning of the 27th, with about forty dragoons, and a small cannon, which he had borrowed from a San Francisco steamer, which at the time was at the dock unloading military supplies.<br>
<br>
Only a narrow place was found for a landing, but on this the
troopers disembarked, and Sheridan, with five or six of them, stole forward, under cover of some underbrush, to observe the Indian position.  When they emerged from the shelter of the  brush,  they  were  greeted with a shower of bullets, one of which grazed Sheridan's nose, and killed a soldier standing by his side.  The remainder of the command soon came up, but the position was such that they could do little.<br>

So on the morning of the 28th, after giving the savages a few more shots from the cannon, the party Withdrew to the river bank, embarked in a boat which had been secured for the purpose, and transferred across the river, landing just below the end of Bradford's Island.  Here it was found necessary to tow the boat up stream-for it would be needed to recross it-and the. current was too swift for rowing.<br>

Both parties reached the upper end of the island, and were ferried across to the Washington side, just as Colonel Steptoe, with a part of Wright's command, which had been recalled and brought down the river by the steamers Otter and Mary, arrived.  The two forces were now united and the blockhouse was quickly relieved.<br>
<br>
Sheridan then recrossed to the island, while Steptoe, who had already rescued the beleaguered party at Bradford's store, marched down the north shore.  As was expected, Sheridan found the Indians who had pretended to be friendly until the hostiles arrived, on the

<br>
Brutal and inhuman as the treatment of this poor captive was, it was even less shocking than another crime which was committed by some white monster in the neighborhood about the same time.<br>
<br>
A friendly Indian, known as Spencer, had been engaged by Wright as an interpreter, as he passed up the river.  When the troops were recalled by the attack on the Cascades this Indian, for some unknown reason, had started his wife, with their two half-grown boys, three younger girls and a babe, down the river to Fort Vancouver.  The veteran hunter and trapper Joe Meek had seen them start, and was at the time solicitous for their safety, but Spencer had confidence that his own friendly relations with the whites, which were widely known, would protect them.<br>
<br>
A day or two later Meek inquired of Sheridan about them, and as no one could be found who had seen them, search was made by the soldiers, and their dead bodies were found in the woods about a mile from the road, between the upper and lower landings.  All had been strangled, a piece of rope about two feet long being still tightly knotted about the neck of all save the babe, which had been strangled with its mother's handkerchief.<br>
<br>
"In my experience," says General Sheridan, "I have been obliged to look upon many cruel scenes, in connection with Indian warfare on
the plains since that 'day; but the effect of that dastardly and revolting crime has never been effaced from my memory.  " These poor creatures had been killed, as Sheridan thinks, by white people whose wives and children had been killed by hostiles, " but who well knew that these unoffending creatures had no part in these murders."<br>
<br>
Wright now remained at the Dalles for a month, during which time Wool paid him a hurried visit, and the plan of his campaign was materially changed.<br>

<br>
F.M. Sebring, "The Indian Raid on the Cascades in March, 1856," <B>Washington Historical Quarterly.</B> XIX (April, 1928) p. 99-107.<br>
<br>
Before proceeding with this narrative, the writer of which was a resident of the Lower Cascades at the time of that murderous foray, it win be well, perhaps, for the benefit of all who are not conversant with the locality, to sketch briefly the topography of that portion of it with which we are immediately concerned, together with the prevailing conditions of that remote time.<br>
<br>
The Columbia River at this place flows approximately from east to west; and all the places herein mentioned were situated on the north, or Washington side.  At the Lower Cascades, which was the head of navigation from below, was a little hamlet consisting of perhaps a half dozen dwellings near the river, in an open glade bounded on the north and east by a dense growth of small fir saplings; which, starting near the river ran out in a northerly direction for two or three hundred yards, where it made a square tum to the west.<br>
<br>
Here is where the Indians displayed bad generalship as, if they had attacked that place first instead of places above, they could have sallied out of that thicket with but little risk and have appropriated most of our scalps as, although we had repeatedly been warned by a friendly Indian named Jack that we were in imminent danger of an attack at any time, we were utterly unprepared to offer any effective resistance.<br>
<br>
There is a long, narrow island in the river extending from nearly opposite the steamer landing at the Lower Cascades for a
considerable distance up the river, which was occupied by a remnant of some tribe of Indians with whom jack lived, although he evidently belonged to some other tribe.  That he had associated much with the whites was attested by the fact that he had as good command of English as any of us.<br>
<br>
About two and a half miles above the Lower Cascades, at the head of navigation for boats of any kind, a blockhouse was situated, and also another little hamlet about like the one below.  From this place freight had to be transported by land to the Upper Cascades by one of the operating companies, connecting on the north side with the steamer Mary plying between that place and The Dalles; while the other company crossed over to the other side at this point, connecting with the steamer Wasco also by land.<br>
<br>
Each of these companies owned a little schooner of a ten tons  capacity each, that were utilized when the wind was<br>
favorable, which was the exception rather than the rule,<br>
otherwise, freight was hauled up to the Middle Cascade in bateau by man power. The reason for calling the reader's attention to these boats will appear in due time.<br>
<br>
The Raid<br>
<br>
The morning of March 26, 1856, broke with a clear sky and<br>
with a steady wind amounting almost to a gale blowing straight down the river; notwithstanding which the south side crew which the writer was one, attempted to take a bateau load of freight up to the upper landing; but soon realizing the futility of trying to 'buck against that head wind, we tied up; after which I sauntered away, bound for no place in particular, but on arriving at the top of the bank my attention was arrested by a group of perhaps a half dozen men of which Indian Jack was one and seemed to be the center of interest.<br>
<br>
My curiosity being somewhat aroused, I sauntered over in that direction tot learn what it was all about; and when I got within ear shot I heard Jack say, "That's the cannon at the blockhouse and the Indians will be down on you before you know it."<br>
<br>
During the whole time that we were engaged wrestling with the bateau the cannon at the blockhouse had been booming; but, for my part it never entered my consciousness.  There had recently been a crew of men working on the road between the Lower and Middle Cascades which required considerable blasting, during which time I had become so accustomed to it that when a blast was fired it failed to arrest my attention; but when I heard Jack say, "That's the cannon at the blockhouse," believe me I never had heard anything plainer in all my experience.  
But Jack wasn't convincing his audience by any means; and they were contending to a man that the reports we were hearing were blasts, in spite of the fact that presumably he had every opportunity to know what he was talking about, and no imaginable incentive to lie about it.  To this day I have never been able to account for that<br>
exhibition of asinine stupidity.<br>
<br>
As for myself it required no argument to convince me that the Cascades was a good place to get away f rom just at that time and consequently I lost no time in finding Capt.  Kilborn my employer, and also one of the owners of one of the above mentioned schooners; and as soon as informed of what I had heard Jack say and hearing the report of the cannon, he remarked,<br>
<br>
"I have been hearing those reports I all morning and didn't wake up.  Go and rustle up the women and children and tell them that our schooner will be off for Portland as soon as we can get off and if they value their scalps to be on hand as soon as possible," and believe me they lost no time in getting there.<br>
<br>
Here I learned something about women that surprised me.  More times than one I had heard women let out a squeal on beholding a harmless worm, and of course anticipated that much hysterics would be in evidence when they were apprised of what was up, and the reader can guess my surprise when not one of them whimpered; and in an incredibly short time after they were warned of the proximity of the hostiles the little schooner was on her way down the river with a stiff breeze astern with all sail set and to say that she flew would be no great exaggeration.<br>
<br>
As is well known by all Columbia River men Cape Horn, between Vancouver and the Cascades, is a pretty rough locality when there is a strong wind blowing, and we anticipated a rough reception at that point,  but when we were within two or three miles of the place we ran into a dead calm as if a door had been clapped to behind us and the river was as smooth as glass; as if our good genius were saying, "I have brought you safely thus far out of a perilous situation, henceforth you can paddle your own canoe."<br>
<br>
Not having anything with which to paddle the only alternative was to drift with an exasperatingly slow current for four or five miles, when we were met by the steamers Bell and Fashion running as squarely abreast as a well trained span of horses.  On being apprised of the situation both boats went about instantly,<br>
The Fashion taking us in tow for Portland and the Belle stopping at Vancouver where she was boarded by Lieut.  Sheridan and forty soldiers and headed again for the Cascades.<br>
<br>
While the Belle, however, was on her way from Vancouver to the Cascades, the Fashion had a ten-mile run to Portland, necessitating
a run of about twenty miles to get back to Vancouver; which, in addition to the time required to raise and equip forty men, consumed so much time that the volunteers, of which the writer was one, were left entirely out of the game.  We passed the Belle about daylight on the morning of the twenty eighth, moored some little distance below the landing, where, soon learned, Sheridan had already encountered the Indians.<br>
<br>
On steaming up to the landing we saw a large body of Indians quite a distance up the river, well out of gunshot however they had rallied around for perhaps ten minutes, one of their number who was on horseback pointed off to the north, whereupon they started on the run straight toward us.<br>
<br>
At the of the above mentioned fir thicket a few panels of a high zigzag rail fence was visible, over which they vaulted like so many monkeys; which was as near as we volunteers came to getting an engagement with them.  However, during a period of  about forty-four hours they succeeded in murdering sixteen persons besides wounding several more; and at the Lower Cascades there was nothing left but some piles of ashes to indicate that the place had ever been inhabited.<br>
<br>
As was stated at the beginning of this article there were two schooners that played an important part in this momentous event, and only one as yet living been accounted for, it will now be in order to trace the movements of the other.  When the first schooner with the women and children departed for Portland, most of the men remained, reasoning that, while the cannon at the blockhouse continued to fire, the Indians would all be engaged at that place, with but little likelihood of their appearing at the lower place; but if it should so happen that the Indians appeared in overwhelming numbers, they could take to the schooner and make their "get away" in short order.<br>
<br>
Theoretically, this plan was flawless; but, like many another plausible looking theory, it had its drawbacks.  The schooner with the women and children had barely disappeared down the river, than the Indians came swarming out of the above mentioned fir thicket in such overwhelming number that they hiked them to the schooner in double quick time.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, however, a contingency had arisen which knocked their flawless theory into a cocked hat; so that when they were ready and quite anxious to go away from there, the wind had gone on down the river, as if it had forgotten them altogether; and having no oars the only chance to escape the hail of bullets that were singing past their ears was to hoist sail, which, with the aid of the current to make steerage way enabled them finally to work them-
selves out of gunshot.<br>
<br>
There were only a few guns in the bunch, and why the man who had
charge of the schooner didn't pull out before the Indians were upon them, none of them were ever able to explain.  Strange to say, only one man was wounded, while a bullet grazed the wrist of another, but not enough to draw blood.<br>
<br>
Thomas Pierce, the man who was wounded was an old frontiersman who lived across the river at the present site of Bonnyville perhaps, and, discovering that something was amiss on the north side, he lost no time in getting over there with a good rifle, which, despite his wound, a shot through the fleshy part of the thigh, he never ceased firing until they were clear of the Indians.<br>
<br>
What Fortune dealt them subsequently until they were back at the Cascades I never had the curiosity to inquire.  The next thing I knew they were all back and everything was running along about as usual.<br>
<br>
The western terminus of steam navigation above the falls was known as The Upper Cascades.<br>
<br>
Here was situated the Bradford house, a two story hewed log structure, the lower story of which was utilized as a store, and the upper, as a residence and boarding house.  This place was connected with the Middle Cascades by a tramway over which freight was transported between the two places.  These two places were attacked simultaneously; before, as indicated above, the raid on the lower place.<br>
<br>
The Bradford house to which all the settlers fled who had escaped the first onslaught, was capable of withstanding anything the Indians could have brought to bear against it had it not stood in front of, and in close proximity to, a perpendicular bank that was within a few feet of being as high as the eaves of the house; and to further complicate matters, a short distance back from the house was a depression in the ground, forming a sort of basin where an Indian was entirely hidden from the inmates of the house.<br>
<br>
Here was an excellent chance unmolested to build a fire; with which it would be quite an easy matter to set fire to the house.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for this well laid plan however, Mr. Bush, who lived in the upper story was an excellent shot with a rifle, and punching a chink from between two logs, for a porthole, whenever an Indian showed his head which he was obliged to do to reach the house with a fire brand, he immediately started on a trip to "the happy hunting grounds" with a bullet hole through it; and  although  they  succeeded  in  throwing  several  brands  on the house, they did no serious damage.<br>
<br>
I have before me an article concerning that affair in which it is stated at the Indians succeeded in setting on fire the shakes of the roof again and again.  Just as shrewdly, and repeatedly daring exposure, the little band of whites put out the fires. And yet,
although they were on the brink of a mighty river they lacked a drop of water to cool their parched tongues<br>
<br>
Something wrong here, which requires elucidating.  How did those people in the absence of a drop, of water to "cool their parched tongues" succeed in extinguishing so many fires? Although it wasn't raining at the time it is only reasonable to suppose that, at that time of year it must have rained a short time previously in which case the roof would have been too damp to ignite readily.<br>
<br>
Be that as it may, I have a vivid recollection of lying shortly afterward not only one night either rolled up in a pair of uncomfortably damp blankets with the whole of Washington Territory for a bed room, while the roof above me consisted of an exceeding leaky firmament.<br>
<br>
Not having been present at the time of the attack on the Bradford house, my knowledge of what occurred there is only f rom hearsay; but as I had the same version of it from several of the inmates of the house only a few days after the event, it is only reasonable to suppose that, so far as related, it is correct; but how much they omitted, of course I do not know.<br>
<br>
They told of the attempts to fire the house, but they did not mention that the roof ever became ignited. either did they mention that attempting to run the rapids with a scow had ever been con-
templated, as they no doubt were aware that the whole party would be exterminated in short order if they ever left the shelter of the house.<br>
<br>
However, two men, Bailey and James Lindsay, having been surprised away from the house, despairing of ever reaching it, determined as a last resort to take their chances with the river; but while looking for the most suitable place to take to the water they were mistaken from the house for Indians; whereupon Mr. Bush shot Lindsay high up in the shoulder, the ball coming out below, and missing the collar bone by a hair's breadth; which of course, disabled him for swimming, leaving him the alterative of reaching the house or being scalped by the Indians; and Bailey refusing to leave him, they reached the house in safety, all on account of a lucky mistake that saved both their lives; as they could never have come through those falls alive.<br>
<br>
At the beginning of the onslaught the steamer Mary was at the landing in front of the Bradford house with a  fire going, but with not sufficient steam to stem the current at the head of the falls.  Notwithstanding what would have been a murderous fire if the Indians could have hit a hay-stack, the crew succeeded in getting under weigh bound for The Danes.  It has been said that some of the crew were lulled; but if so it was never mentioned in my presence.<br>
<br>
SHERIDAN'S BATTLE WITH THE INDIANS.<br>
<br>
When the Belle with Sheridan's detachment of forty men, arrived within sight of the landing at the Lower Cascades there was a large body of Indians m possession of the place.  Consequently it was deemed the better policy to land some distance below.  The place chosen for landing was against a gravel bar of considerable size, devoid of vegetation with the exception of quite a number of balm-of-gilead saplings interspersed over the bar, none of them over four inches in diameter, not large enough to be any protection against the Minnie rifles of the soldiers.<br>
<br>
Here is where the battle took place, as there was plenty of evidence of the fact.  Not more than thirty I feet from the boat was a large pool of blood where one o I f the two soldiers who were killed in the engagement died, and as other evidence a considerable number of the cottonwood saplings were mowed down as cleanly almost as if they had been felled with an axe.  How many Indians were killed in the encounter it, was impossible to say, as they carried their dead off the field.<br>
<br>
They probably wouldn't have given battle in such an exposed situation had it not been that Sheridan kept his men concealed so that they were right where he wanted them before they were aware that the soldiers were aboard the boat; and instead of making an easy capture of a steamboat, as was evidently their intention, they ran into a hornet's next with disastrous results.<br>
<br>
Despite much that has been broadcast to the contrary, this was Sheridan's only encounter with the Indians, for the very sufficient reason, owing to the nature of the locality that an attempt to reach the blockhouse either by land or water would have laid him open to ambush along nearly the whole route; and Sheridan was too good a soldier to be caught in a trap like that.  It was of Col.  Wright's force that caused the Indians to he never actually came in contact with them, .good their get away before he arrived on the and the last that was seen of any of them was I as is stated above.<br>
<br>
How many of the Cascade Indians were engaged in the raid, it is impossible to say.  Their guns, consisting mostly of Hudson's Bay flintlock muskets, although there were some good rifles, were all loaded, but only nine Indians were apprehended, and were hanged accordingly.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, seeing a file of soldiers drawn up and my curiosity being aroused, when I went out to investigate I found an Indian with his hands tied behind him to a stake, about the worst scared Indian in seven states; which well he might have been, for had it not been for Indian Jack happened along in the nick of time, he would not have looked on the world to exceed two more minutes.<br>
<br>
When Jack saw what was going on he asked "What are you doing that for"? and when Sheridan told him that some of the other Indians
accused him of being in the raid, jack said "Why, he wasn't in it at all," Sheridan then ordered him turned loose.<br>
<br>
I presume this is about as suitable a time lag any to discuss the matter of the fragment of a cannon discovered rather recently.  Concerning the conjecture that it might have exploded during Sheridan's fight with the Indians.  Although he had a cannon aboard the boat it was not fired at all, lest it damage the boat so the deck hands, with whom I was well acquainted, informed me.<br>
<br>
Neither did the cannon at the blockhouse explode, and I offer it merely as a suggestion that some squaw brought it from somewhere to utilize as an anchor for her (canoe) while fishing for sturgeon.<br>
<br>
All the plunder from the dwellings at the Lower Cascades that could possibly be of use to an Indian was found under a shelving rock on the bank of the river some distance east of the place, with a guard consisting of a lone old Indian who when discovered had a gun pointed at the party who discovered him.  His friends had left him to the tender mercies of the whites, with disastrous results to himself.<br>
<br>
Shortly after the Indians disappeared from the Lower Cascades as stated above, the volunteers were scouring the fir thicket, during which a young man by the name of Lyman Chittenden was shot in the arm by the accidental discharge of the Captain's gun.<br>
<br>
Some time previous to the raid another youngster and myself attempted to scale Castle Rock; (I believe it is now called Beacon Rock) but soon gave up the attempt as impracticable.  What then was our surprise to see several weeks after the raid a fire blazing right on the tiptop of it! Whatever the object of it was, it never came to anything.<br>
<br>
I cannot close this rather lengthy article without further mention of Indian Jack.  Of all who were concerned in that affair, none is entitled to greater credit; and yet, nowhere have I ever found so much as a mention of his name, notwithstanding the fact that, if his repeated warnings had been heeded much bloodshed undoubtedly would have been averted while, owing to the incredible stupidity of nearly all the men in the place, his warnings fell on deaf ears for no other conceivable reason than a that they didn't want to believe him.<br>

BATTLE OF THE UPPER AND LOWER CASCADES.<br>
<br>
Jehu Switzler, "A Newly Revealed Account of the Blockhouse <B>Siege</B>,"<B> Clark County History.</B><B> 1972.</B> Vancouver: Fort Vancouver Historical Society, 1972, p. 149-158.<br>
<br>
A previously unrevealed eyewitness account of the 1856 Indian massacre at Fort Rains and the Cascades has come into the possession of the Fort Vancouver Historic Site.  The late Russell M. Turner of Roseburg, whose grandfather, Jehu Switzler, was a scout in the employ of the U.S. army at Fort Vancouver in the 1850s, brought the handwritten manuscript to Vancouver where a copy was made and attested to.  Two months later Mr. Turner died of a heart attack while on a hunting trip in Oregon.<br>
<br>
Switzler's account of the Indian raids and siege was dictated to Tumer's father, Richard M. Turner, many years ago.  It provides details missing from history books and from other eyewitness accounts.  For example: the beleagured soldiers and civilians in the blockhouse were able to stave off hunger by breaking into an abandoned home and eating doughnuts.  Thirst overcame them and the next night they broke into an abandoned saloon and returned with enough wine and other spirits to satisfy their liquid needs until help came.<br>
<br>
The account of the blockhouse siege also brings out a defensive tactic not heretofore reported.  A bulldog, probably owned by one of the settlers, was tumed loose from the blockhouse to locate approaching Indians with his barking.  Thus forewarned, the defenders were able to keep the Indians away from the log bastion with gunfire, preventing it from being set afire.<br>
<br>
The blockhouse, a restoration of which is now known as Fort Rains, was located on a point in the river just east of present day Bonneville Dam.<br>
<br>
There was a store and settlement at the upper cascades, the blockhouse at the Middle Cascades and a settlement at the Lower Cascades.<br>
<br>
A work party of civilians was building a wooden tramway or railroad between the upper and lower cascades over which to transport supplies for the army at The Dalles.  This paralleled an existing wagon portage road.  The canny Indian leader of the attack, Chief Kamiaken, waited until Colonel George Wright and a detachment of soldiers had gone to The Dalles to establish a headquarters for fighting the Indians.  This left the portage road and the civilians
practically unprotected except for nine enlisted men at the blockhouse.<br>
<br>
The attack was made almost simultaneously at three points along the portage road by 50 Yakima and Klickitat Indians and an undetermined number of Cascades Indians. Historians believe Kamiaken planned to push across the river into Oregon and into the heart of the Willamette Valley with this thrust.<br>
<br>
The first attack was at the upper cascades on the morning of March 26, 1856.  The first victims were a sawmill worker and his wife and her young brother at Mill Creek at the upper end of the portage.  The settlers and railroad workers crowded into the Bradford & Co. store, which was built of logs, and in which they cut portholes for firing their rifles.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, the scout, Switzler, had left a number of army rifles and ammunition at the store to be transferred to a riverboat and refumed to Fort Vancouver.  He had brought the munitions back from The Dalles where he had gone with some horses.  With these guns and cartridges the defenders of the store held off the Indians until help came.<br>
<br>
Another raiding party attacked the lower cascades where the settlers were also able to defend themselves.  The Indians also fired on a river boat moored on the north bank, the Mary, with the intention of putting her out of commission, but the crew repulsed them.  Meanwhile, the captain of the Wasco, another river steamer anchored on the Oregon side of the river, saw what was happening, and headed for The Dalles to inform the military.  The Mary was able to heat up her boilers and follow the Wasco.  Letting the two steamers get away and spread the alarm was Kamiaken's fatal mistake.<br>
<br>
The attack on the blockhouse at the midway point on the portage road is told by Jehu Switzler in these words:<br>
<br>
Having been frequently requested to write an account of my participation in the Indian war of 1856, and particularly of the defense of the blockhouse at the Middle Cascades, I have consented to do so, that my statement may be preserved...<br>
<br>
On  several  occasions  during  the  winter  preceding  the  outbreak  of  1856,  I became aware that the Indians were engaged in war dancing, and many rumors of approaching conflict reached me, and it was. apparent that the Indians were restless and ill at ease.  We were expecting trouble in the spring of 1856 and the commander at the fort was doing all in his power to avert it.  Early in the spring of 1856 the commander started me with dispatches to be delivered to the commander at Fort Lane.<br>
I started alone, and when within about 40 miles of my destination discovered <B>fires </B>burning on all sides of me and soon met a number of settlers, all heavily armed, who informed me that the country was full of hostile Indians that were burning and destroying all houses and other property.<br>
<br>
I was told also that it would be impossible for me to continue my journey to the fort, as the Indians would murder me before I had traveled one-half the distance.<br>
<br>
Finding that I was determined to proceed, these men kindly gave me a fresh mule, and after resting for several hours with them, I continued my journey at dusk.  I rode all night with my pistol in my hand, ready for instant use, and expecting to be attacked at any moment.  I frequently heard the Indians, and, but for my thorough knowledge of the country and a familiarity with the habits of the Indians, I would undoubtedly have been taken that night.  Just after daybreak on the following morning, I arrived safely at the fort and delivered the messages to the commander.<br>
<br>
After a thorough rest I returned to Vancouver with a strong guard.  I started at once from Vancouver to The Dalles with a herd of horses for Colonel Wright; on this trip I had a guard of about 10 or 12 men and we safely delivered the horses.  After settling with the men, they were to remain at The Dalles; I again started for Vancouver in company with my friend Tom McDowell.<br>
<br>
The guns, ammunition, cartridge boxes and other property belonging to the government and which had been used by the guard on the trip up the river, were in mv possession and were by me being returned to Vancouver.<br>
<br>
At the Upper Cascades I left the property for shipment, and McDowell and I walked on down to the Middle Cascades, a distance of about a mile, and after laying down our rifles, we walked over the to office of Mr. [George] Griswold, the agent in charge of the portage road, and while Mr. Griswald and I were talking in front of the office the firing began, and we discovered that there were Indians all about us.<br>
<br>
Mr. Griswald ran toward the blockhouse, but was shot on the way and died soon after reaching the house.  McDowell and I ran towards our rifles, but the Indians had evidently seen us lay them down, and intercepted us before we had gone far, and in a perfect rain of rifle balls we turned and made all speed for the blockhouse feeling all the time that it was our only chance.<br>
<br>
Although we ran for some distance, the Indians firing at us all the time, we reached the blockhouse without a scratch.  It was a miraculous escape, and our regret, was that Griswald and others were
not so fortunate.<br>
<br>
In other accounts of this siege it is said that there was a third man wit h us, but such was not the case.  McDowell and I were together and unaccompanied by time we did, but if so he was not with us.<br>
<br>
The blockhouse was being held by Sergeant [Matthew] Kelly and his little band of heroes when we arrived, and we placed ourselves under his orders and prepared for the seige.  The dead and wounded have been accounted for by others and it is unnecessary for me to go over that again.<br>
<br>
During the first day the Indians made a vicious attack upon the blockhouse, but we were able to beat them off, and gave such a good account of ourselves again that they were careful not to expose themselves again to our fire.  During the day a large part of the Indians left to attack the Lower Cascades, but sufficient were left to besiege us.<br>
<br>
Late in the afternoon we began to realize that we had been long without food and water.  Robert Williams, afterwards sergeant of ordinance, U.S.A., volunteered to make an effort to procure something to eat and drink and I volunteered to accompany him.<br>
<br>
It has been erroneously stated that the third party that entered the blockhouse with me as the one that accompanied Williams in search of food, but such was not the case, as I was the one.  Mr. Williams broke into the Griswald house and soon handed me a dishpan filled with fresh doughnuts which I carried to our waiting companions.<br>
<br>
Williams soon came with a boiled ham and the feast was spread.  While we were searching for the food those in the blockhouse watched with guns in hand, ready to defend us from all danger.  We had no water that night.<br>
<br>
Darkness came and with it renewed activity on the part of the Indians and redoubled vigilance and hardship for those in the blockhouse.<br>
<br>
The Indians attempted to burn us out that night and would have succeeded, no doubt, if it had not been for a vicious bulldog that would rush out into the darkness growling and barking furiously at every approaching Indian, and in that way directed our fire with the aid of this dog, we succeeded in keeping them at so great a distance from the building that it was impossible for them to set the fire.<br>
The dog undoubtedly saved us from destruction that night.<br>
On the second day of the siege Mr. Williams and another member of the little garrison whose name I do not now remember, under the guns of the others, broke into a saloon and while no water was to be procured, returned with a dozen bottles of port and some other liquors which answered as a very acceptable substitute for water, and allaying the thirst of the weary men in the house.<br>
<br>
The second day and night was a repetition of the first and relief came on the morning of the third day of the siege.  We had been almost constantly under fire and were exhausted when relief came.<br>
T'he guns, ammunition, etc., left by me at the Upper Cascades had not been there over an hour or two when the attack was made at that point, and the terrible struggle that ensued and the valiant defense made by the settlers from the Bradford & Co. Store, was made possible only by means thereof...<br>
<br>
When the two river boats reached The Dalles, Colonel Wright had already left with his men to establish branch posts in the Yakima and Walla Walla valleys.  A courier was sent to overtake them, and 250 men hurried back to The Dalles and embarked for the trouble spot on the two river steamers.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, a friendly Indian carried the news to Fort Vancouver.  Lieutenant Phil Sheridan (later a Civil War hero) boarded the steamer Belle with 40 regulars and headed for the Cascades.<br>
Sheridan and Wright arrived at the scene of the fighting within four hours of each other, on March 28, two days after the attack had started.  Sheridan was on the Oregon side and scouted the situation before engaging the Indians who were laying siege to the blockhouse.<br>
<br>
His first encounter with the Indians was unsuccessful, but when a group of Willamette Valley volunteers arrived the next day on the river boat Fashion the two units divided the attention of the<br>
enemy, allowing Sheridan to reach a point near the blockhouse and set up a howitzer.<br>
<br>
A bugle call signalled the arrival of Wright's men and the Indians quickly realized their position was no longer tenable and disappeared into the woods.<br>
<br>
At least 14 whites were killed in the raids, including a woman and a soldier, and a large number were wounded.  No Yakima Indian was punished for the raid, but Chenoweth, a renegade Cascade chief, and eight others were tried by summary court martial and hanged.  Colonel Wright ordered a blockhouse built on the bluff in back of Bradford's store and another at the lower cascades.<br>
<br>
The blockhouse involved in the siege remained for nearly 50 years and was, according to one account, taken out by the coming of the railroad on the north bank of the Columbia.  Another account blamed
high water in the river for its destruction.  Originally, it had no proper name, but in later years it was named for Major Gabriel J. Rains, commandant of the military District of the Columbia that embraced Fort Vancouver, The Dalles and Fort Steilacoom.<br>
<br>
The major ordered its construction in 1855 at the beginning of the Indian wars north of the Columbia.  In 1927 the blockhouse was restored by the Skamania County Historical Society.<br>
<br>
In the preamble to his account of the blockhouse siege, Jehu Switzler had this to say about his early life:<br>
<br>
My father, John Switzler, arrived with his family at Vancouver in 1845 from Missouri.  I was at that time a boy 13 ydars old.  I remained a resident of Vancouver until long after the war of 1856, and was frequently employed by the commander of the fort in carrying messages for the government through the Indian country, as I was perfectly familiar with the language and customs of the Indians.<br>
<br>
As a postscript, the old civilian scout added this information about his experiences in the far-west wildemess of the Columbia River:<br>
<br>
I was with Father Wilbur and Joel Palmer in 1850, when they were treating with the Indians, and gave them assistance in numerous ways.<br>
<br>
In 1850 I was present, acting as interpreter, at the conference held at The Dalles between Governor Lane [of Oregon] and Chief Yellow Hawk, when Governor Lane demanded that the chief disclose the names of the Whitman murderers, and threatened to destroy the tribes if such of the murderers as were then alive were not immediately surrendered to the.authorities of Oregon for trial.<br>
<br>
The chief promised to have them surrendered within 12 days, and they were at the expiration of that time delivered up to the authorities at The Dalles where Governor Lane received them in person.  I was present when he received them and saw them placed on the boat and their horses loaded, when they were started for Oregon City for trial.  They took a cargo of horses with them, which represented their attorney's fees.<br>
<br>
I was born in Saline County, Missouri, September 3, 1833.<br>
<br>
This additional information has been furnished by Mrs. Russell M. Turner: Switzler was first married to a Margaret Nye, and lived on Tomahawk Island in the Columbia River opposite Fort Vancouver.  Here their daughter Idyl was born; she became Richard Turner's mother.<br>
<br>
Later on Switzler joined his youngest brother John in. the Horse
Heaven country north of Umatilla where the two men raised horses for the army.  He married a second time to Elizabeth Kuykendall in 1877.  Sometime later he contracted tuberculosis and moved to Mesa, Arizona, where he died on Feb. 4, 1908.<br>
<br>
His body was thought to have been buried in Mesa, but brother John's granddaughter, Mrs. E. L. Mottley of Sunnyside, Wash., reported she discovered his grave in an old cemetery in Umatilla.<br>
<br>
Sheridan mentions a Switzler farm in his memoirs as having been located on the Oregon side of the Columbia River.  It was at this farni that Sheridan's outfit, the Fourth Infantry, set up. camp when they arrived from California for duty at Fort Vancouver.  Sheridan refers to the farm as belonging to "an old settler named Switzler," which would indicate that it was owned by John Switzler, Jehu's father, as the army scout Jehu could hardly be described as "old" at the age of 23!<br>
<br>
On the next page of his memoirs, Sheridan tells how some razor-backed hogs from the Switzler farm frequently "invaded" the army camp.  To control the scavengers, an old mountaineer assigned to the infantrymen would shoot off the tips of their snouts.  When Switzler complained, the mountaineer paid for his fun from a bottle of gold dust he carried.  This not only satisfied the farmer, but resulted in his encouraging the practice!<br>
<br>
(Information about the massacre that preceded Switzler's account was taken from four sources: "A General History of Oregon Prior to 1861 " by Charles H. Cary, Vol. II, Metropolitan Press, Portland, 1936; From Hubert H. Bancroft's "History of Washington, Idaho and Montana," Vol.  XXXI; from "A History of the Pacific Nort@est" by George W. Fuller, Albert Knopf, New York, 1931, and from "Personal Memoirs of P. H. Sheridan," Vol. 1, Charles C. Webster & Co., New York. 1888.-Ed.)<br>

James Attwell, "Robert Williams story of the battle at Fort Rains," <B>Columbia River Gorge History.</B> Skamania, Washington: Tahlkie Books, 1975, II, p. 107-112.<br>
<br>
Robert Williams, a Soldier at Fort Rains, tells this Story:<br>
<br>
"I was the first person  stationed  at  the  blockhouse  who
suspected that the Indians were preparing for mischief, while carrying a message from Mr. Griswold, who lived at the Middle Cascades, to Mr. Hamilton, who lived on a farm at the Lower Cascades.<br>
<br>
"The word was for Mr. Hamilton to bring up immediately a yoke of oxen which Mr. Griswold had purchased of him, and also to hitch them to one of a lot of new government wagons that were at the landing and bring it up also.  Mr. Hamilton started on this mission the next morning but learned that the Indians were on the warpath.  He abandoned the wagon and hastily returned to warn his neighbors and seek safety for himself and family.<br>
<br>
"In passing each way by Indian camp, as I had to do, in going to and from carrying the message, my attention was particularly attracted at seeing the majority of the Indians standing together in council and dressed in warlike costumes while some were playing at a game, resembling shinny.  Their actions were suspicious and confirmed my belief that they were planning mischief.<br>
<br>
"The movements of some of them in particular, going in a half circle through the timber, thus to flank me, awakened in my mind a very strong suspicion that they were planning to catch me to kill me.<br>
<br>
"I did not show to them any evidence that I suspicioned them of doing me harm, but after I got past their camp and out of their sight I hurried with my utmost speed to the blockhouse, and then told Sergeant Kelly and my other comrades my suspicions.  But by reason of our belief in the strength of our position, few as they were of us, we did not dread any danger from the Indians, or even think any more about it, for during the whole of the night previous to the attack six out of nine of us there, and an old German, H.  Kyle, were drinking whiskey toddy and telling army stories, the old German taking an active part in the sport and claiming to be one of Blucher's Waterloo veterans, but none of them got drunk.<br>
<br>
"The next morning the sergeant permitted Frederick to go to the Upper Cascades for a canteen full of whiskey, but unfortunately for him the Indians had commenced their attack on the blockhouse before he returned, preventing him from getting back to us.  They shot him through both legs.<br>
<br>
He managed, however, to get to the bank of the river, and there hide from sight.  He fainted several times from loss of blood, but the whiskey he had in the canteen supported his strength.  When night came on he left his hiding place and got safely to the blockhouse, where he received a joyful welcome for we all thought he was killed.<br>
<br>
"When the attack first began on the blockhouse, nearly all the men of the detachment were scattered around the vicinity.  There were but three of us in close proximity to the blockhouse; Sheridan, and
the cook McManus and myself.  We all heard the shooting, but strange to affirm, even after the previous, I, nor the two others had even the least suspicion that we were attacked by Indians.<br>
<br>
"My first feeling at such an unusual occurrence was that of indignation at such foolish conduct, thinking all the while that some person was firing off his revolver.  But the cook quickly found what was the matter, and immediately gave the alarm, crying, 'Indians!,<br>
<br>
"McManus and myself were standing close together near the blockhouse and on the instant the alarm was given we cast our eyes towards the hills and timber which closely surrounded us in <B>front, </B>and then we beheld to our horror the painted and half naked savages, firing  upon all they could see.  McManus who stood by my side was shot in the groin.  He died shortly after in the army hospital at Vancouver from its effects.<br>
<br>
"I truthfully confess that when I beheld the savages engaged in their bloody work, and my comrade fatally shot, I felt for a few moments as if my hair was lifted from my head.  Then my thoughts instantly reverted to the great peril I had escaped the day before, the panoramic view of which will vividly remain stamped on my memory.<br>
<br>
"My wounded comrade and myself lost no time in getting inside the blockhouse.  I then quickly got on my accouterments and gun, and immediately commenced the defense.  The incessant firing and racket of the Indians gave unmistakable warning of deadly danger to those of my comrades who were strolling around.  They all got to the blockhouse in safety, excepting Lawrence Rooney, who was so unfortunate as to be captured upon the hill while cutting wood.<br>
<br>
"The two or three unfortunate families who were living close by the blockhouse ran to it with all their might for the safety of their lives, but several were severely wounded in running the gauntlet.  We had altogether with us, three killed and seven wounded.  Among the former was Mr. George Griswold, who might have escaped death but for the confidence in the friendliness of the Indians toward him, and his standing in view and waving to the Indians to cease firing, thinking all the time they were Cascade Indians, whom he well knew, and not suspecting that there was a large force of hostile Yakimas among them.<br>
<br>
"The German boy, Jake Kyle, mentioned in Mr. Coe's narrative, was killed while riding on horseback down the road on the hill about 100 yards in front of the blockhouse.  The Indian that shot him stood by the side of a tree close to the road, his gun about reaching to the poor boy, who fell instantly upon being shot.  It was an agonizing sight to us to behold the poor, unconscious boy writhing in deadly agony for several hours.  Sometimes he would endeavor to sit up, but, each attempt provoked the Indians to
shoot arrows into him.<br>
<br>
"John Switzler and Tom McDowell, and another man to me before unknown, were on their way from the Upper to the Lower Cascades, but before they had proceeded far they discovered hostile Indians.  Being unarmed, they made a desperate effort to reach the blockhouse, and providentially did in safety, but greatly fatigued.  They proved a valuable acquisition to our small force.  The three gallantly aided us during the defense in all duties assigned them to do.<br>
<br>
"After they got in, the door was made secure by a bolt and a strong chain.  That being completed, we prepared in terrible earnest for our uneven and deadly conflict by giving our savage enemies a treat of canister shot, fourteen rounds in all, from our six-pounder gun which finally made them precipitately retreat for better shelter.  We sent after them a few shells for a change.<br>
<br>
"They, however, returned to their first position to pay their respects to us again.  But by this time they had learned our mettle, and wisely concluded that they could not whip us, so they returned behind the hill out of range of our guns to torture and put to death our unfortunate comrade, Lawrence Rooney, whom they had captured. We could not see them at it, but we heard our comrade's piercing screams."<br>
<br>
John Attwell later told, "The Indians tied Rooney to a tree and then stuck pitch splinters through his skin and set them on fire." An Indian who was there but did not take part, told this to John a few years later.<br>
<br>
"After they had accomplished that last inhuman and diabolical cruelty, the main portion left and went to the lower Cascades.  The outrages which they did there are fully narrated in Mr. Coe's narrative.  They, however, left enough behind to besiege the blockhouse.  But they did not offer to fight us anymore, consequently our little party deemed it advisable to, if possible before night came on, make an effort to get food and water.<br>
<br>
I volunteered to do so. The sergeant willingly consented to my going.  The stranger who joined our force with Switzler and McDowell gallantly volunteered to go with me in search of whatever we could find to sustain life.  Our companions in the blockhouse were meanwhile watching us with guns in hand ready to defend us to the utmost of their ability if occasion offered.  But, luckily, we were not molested.<br>
<br>
" I went through a window into Mr. Griswold's house, and to my great joy I found a dish pan full of excellent doughnuts.  I then handed them to my companion outside to take to the blockhouse, which he did to the delight of all.  In the meantime, I discovered in the pantry a large fine ham, which with the doughnuts, sufficed to relieve all the pangs of hunger.  But we failed to get any water.  So ended the first day's transaction, but still in
constant vigilance by day and night it was necessary to depend for the safety of our lives until we could get assistance.<br>
<br>
"The second day, the Indians were still besieging us and thus preventing us from getting elixir, water, which by this time all of us greatly needed, especially the wounded.  Close by there was a small saloon, owned and kept by the Palmer brothers, who, with a brother, kept a store at the foot of the hill by the river bank.  Luckily they made their escape immediately after the Indians commenced their attack, locking the doors of both of the buildings before they left.<br>
<br>
"My army comrade, William Houser, suggested that somebody should be allowed to go to the saloon and get ,whatever they might find that would alleviate hunger and thirst. Sergeant Kelly then permitted him and me to go. The door being locked, my comrade had to break it in with an ax. We procured within one dozen bottles of English porter, one decanter of brandy, the same of whiskey and wine and a small box of oyster crackers.  We failed to get water, but the articles mentioned satisfied every requirement except surgical aid.<br>
<br>
"We knew relief was close at hand by hearing the report of Phil Sheridan's guns, firing upon the enemy at the Lower Cascades.  We relax some of the vigilance we had kept for the purpose of allowing a portion of the guards to take a little rest and sleep.  We were greatly fatigued at night during the siege by the service which a vicious bulldog at one of the deserted neighbors homes rendered us.  He barked and gave 'warning to us of any attempt the Indians made to get toward the blockhouse.  If they had been allowed to get close enough to the building, they would, without doubt, have tried to burn it, by throwing burning pitch wood on the roof.<br>
<br>
"The next morning Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Steptoe, Ninth U.S. Infantry, commanding Companies A.E.F. in all 120 men and officers, came to our relief.  The sergeant told them how we had made the defense, and the Colonel then complimented all of us for our admirable conduct."<br>
<br>
Had he known ... he may not have complimented them on living on English porter and whiskey when river water was only ten feet away from the store where they got the porter ... but... they may not have had a container to get water in with them, and the porter was already in a container.<br>

History.</B> Skamania, Washington: Tahlkie Books, 1975, II, p. 117-<br>
123.<br>
<br>
Mrs. C.S. Corum, was born in Clinton County, Iowa, on the 31st of March 1843, and was the youngest daughter of George and Candace Griswold.  In 1851, my father thought it best to try his fortune in the Far West.  Our family at that time consisted of my father, mother, three sisters, one brother and myself.  My brother and two sisters, not wishing to take the long journey, and having homes of their own, were content to remain where they were.<br>
<br>
In May my father, mother and their two little girls Gennie and Anna (Eugenia and Christiana) started across the plains.  Our team consisted of two yoke of cows and three yoke of oxen and one wagon well filled.<br>
<br>
"Here let me say, the cattle were traded off for five horses, and our load lightened by throwing away every,#'hing we could get along without before we reached our journey's end.  We did not have any trouble with the Indians except stampeding and driving our stock away.  One time they drove away all of the stock in the night.  I can well remember what fear we held at camp the next day, as nearly all the men went to look for the stock.<br>
<br>
Father struck their trail, and found them just as the Indians were trying to swim over a river.  As he was alone he began shouting and waving his hands for the rest to come on.  The Indians thinking the whole train was after them, fled, and he drove the stock back to camp.  Another time, as we were preparing to camp, an Indian raised up on the opposite bank and shook a buffalo robe.  The team all took fright and ran away.<br>
<br>
Mother, being out of the wagon, our team ran over, hurting her shoulder, which gave her pain until her death.  One man in the train was given to boasting of the good traits of his oxen.  He would tell father that if he sang out "Whoa!" to his oxen, they would stop any time at any place.  One day he proved it.  This man sang out "Whoa!" and his wheel oxen stopped so suddenly that it broke the yoke, and the wagon ran over them.  In all of this confusion the man cried out: "There, Griswold, I told you my oxen would stop."<br>
<br>
"We did not have hardships and privations in our train like some who were molested, by the Indians, but a trip across the plains in the early days with an oxen team is in itself a hardship enough for one to remember all of one's life.<br>
<br>
"We reached The Dalles in October, and went down the Columbia River to the Cascades, where father ran a saw mill that winter.  We went to Portland in the spring and stayed until 1854, when we again returned to the Cascades where he resided until his death.<br>
<br>
If we could have foreseen the terrible tragedies that afterwards took place here, we would have fled the place, but a wise
Providence kindly veils our future from our vision, allowing us only to look back on the past scenes of our lives, sometimes with pleasure and sometimes with sad regret.<br>
<br>
"Everyone that has read the history of Oregon and Washington is familiar with the terrible deeds done by the Yakima and the Klickitat Indians, and I shall only try to describe a part of the suffering at the Middle Cascades.<br>
<br>
"The Cascades was applied to the upper, middle and lower landings of the boats.  From the upper landing to the middle was a portage around the falls.  The distance two and one-half miles, consisting of a plank railroad and hand cars drawn by mules and horses.  From the middle landing to the lower there was a wagon road two and one-half miles.  At some stages of the water the steamboats landed at the middle landing, but most of the time bateaux were used.  By those means all of the government and individual ammunition and freight was transported around the falls.<br>
<br>
Father's occupation was transporting the freight.  Captain Wallen, with the assistance of father's work hands and mule teams had made a blockhouse near our house, and several nights we stayed in it when the Indian excitement ran high.  I have passed briefly over my life u-o to this time, as nothing transpired to mar the happiness of my childhood.  But soon, ah! very soon, I was to take part in scares that can never be obliterated from my memory.<br>
<br>
On the 26 th day of March 1856, the sun rose over a happy prosperous little village at the middle landing, but ere it reached its mid-day course, death and devastation reigned in our midst.  As we were living in a place I shall try and describe some of the suffering here.  Between the hours of 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning, when everyone was busy at their different occupations, the Indians attacked these three landings at the same time.<br>
<br>
At the lower landing the settlers were warned by a half -breed Indian, and all got into a boat and started down the Columbia River without any loss of life, and some only slightly wounded.  The Indians burned everything that was left.  At the upper landing they killed several, wounding some also.<br>
<br>
By all collecting at Bradford's store they held the place with great difficulty until help came from The Dalles- Here every thing was burned.  The blockhouse was situated on the bank of the Columbia River and was open to an attack on one side only.  From this point the Indians began firing.  Thinking it was the soldiers firing off their guns, as they sometimes did, I walked out in the yard and stood talking to some others.<br>
<br>
Six bullets in rapid succession came over my head and about me, the last one striking a little boy by my side.  He cried out, "I
am shot!" Then we seemed to understand that we were in danger and went in the block house.  By this time people in every direction came flying in.  They had taken all the soldiers to The Dalles, but seven, and one of these was lying dead upon the hill in front of the blockhouse and another one shot through the hip at the foot of the incline where they hauled the freight up, leaving five, with the assistance of the settlers, to fire the cannon and hold the fort.  Mother was going to the spring for water and came in with the bucket on her arm.<br>
<br>
Several came in wounded, but only one fatally, which was my father.  He was shot in the knee while some distance from the fort, but reached it in time to sink down inside the door.  On seeing me first he said, "Is mother here?" I supported his head in my arms while mother took a black handkerchief from his neck, and also some of her clothing, and tried to stop the flow of blood, but alas! too late to save him.  With the cannon booming over his head, he sank quietly to rest.<br>
<br>
Calm the good man meets his fate, Guards celestial around him wept.<br>
<br>
Everyone was at their post and the yells of savages and the cannon's roar was kept up all during the day.  For two days and nights mother and I sat on either side of our dead, and now, as I recall the scenes of those sad days spent in the blockhouse tears dim my eyes.<br>
<br>
Often, before his death, father tried to persuade mother to take me (my sister being in Portland attending school), and go to Portland.  She would tell him if he stayed, she would also.  He said he was needed here, and he could not leave.  Alas! for the brave man who would desert his post.<br>
<br>
Alas, for his widow and orphan children.  A pitiful sight indeed, it was to see a German boy, who was shot down in sight of the fort, as he would raise his hand and beckon to the fort, the Indians seemed delighted in his suffering, and would shoot him,with arrows to increase his pain.  He died the first night and lay in sight of the fort until the third day.<br>
<br>
The Indians had piled cord wood on the soldier they had killed on the hill, it was supposed with the intention of burning him, but for some reason they did not.  The one, who was wounded on the incline, crawled up the bank the first night and came into the blockhouse.  The second night towards morning, the Indians ceased firing, and the third day they drew off to re- enforce the upper and lower landings.<br>
<br>
They were seen crossing the river below the fort, and immediately the cannon was fired, but they were too far away.  What a welcome sound was the booming of this Cannon, for it seemed that therein lay our safety. <B>t,</B> Although it has been quite a number of years since I heard the firing of those guns, yet now, when I hear the
report of a gun ring out on the night air, my thoughts fly back to those nights of peril.<br>
<br>
"All of this time we were without food of any kind or a drop of water.  The soldier's kitchen was apart from the blockhouse, and during the firing no one dared to venture out.  The third day soldiers came from The Dalles and volunteers from Portland and we were liberated.  The greatest excitement prevailed, as the friendly Indians had joined the hostile band.  Every family was leaving the fort.<br>
<br>
Tenderly laying our loved ones to rest, we bade them a long<br>
farewell and went to Portland.  What sad news to convey to that sister-our father dead.<br>
<br>
A few years after this <B>time, </B>the fort and the bank on which it stood slipped into the river, but the safety it gave to the people at that massacre will never be forgotten.  We reached Portland on <B>my </B>thirteenth birthday-31st of March. I was placed in school with my sisters at the ladies seminary.  The following June my mother returned to the Cascades settle up the estate, but there was not much left for us.<br>
<br>
My sister was married in 1858 and died in 1863, leaving two boys.  Mother died in 1877 in Prineville, Oregon.  Myself, one brother, and one sister, who is in Iowa, are all that is left of the family that parted on the banks of the Mississippi in 1851.  Ah, such is life.<br>
<br>
"I was married in the year 1860, and am the mother of six children.  I have tried to write as explicit as possible, and will be pleased to see my father's and mother's name rank with the brave-hearted, noble suffering and enduring first pioneers of the Cascades area on the mighty Columbia River."<br>

PHIL SHERIDAN'S REPORT<br>
<br>
James Attwell, "Phil Sheridan's report," <B>Columbia River Gorge History.</B> Skamania, Washington: Tahlkie Books, 1975, II, p. 112-<br>
117.<br>
<br>
The following is part of Phil Sheridan's Report:<br>
"On the morning of March 26th, the movement began; but the column had only reached Four Mile Creek when the 
Yakimas joined by many young warriors-free lancers from other tribes-made a sudden and unexpected attack at the Cascades of the Columbia midway between Vancouver and The Dalles, killed several citizens women and children, and took possession of the portage by besieging the settlers in their cabins at the Upper Cascades, and those who sought shelter at the Middle Cascades in the old military blockhouse, which had been built for refuge under just such circumstances.<br>
<br>
These points held out and were not captured; but the landing at the lower Cascades fell completely into the hands of the savages.  Straggling settlers from the lower Cascades made their way down to Fort Vancouver, distant thirty-six miles which they reached that night and communicated the condition of affairs.<br>
<br>
As the necessity for early relief of the settlers, and the establishment of communication with The Dalles, were apparent, and all the force that could be spared was ordered out; and in conse-
quence, I immediately received directions to go with my detachment of dragoons numbering about forty effective men, to the relief of the middle blockhouse, which really meant to retake the Cascades.<br>
<br>
I got ready at once, and believing that a piece of artillery would be of service to me, asked for one; but as there proved to be no guns at the post, I should have been obliged to proceed without one had it not been that the regular steamer from San Francisco to Portland was lying at the Vancouver dock, unloading military supplies; and the commander, Captain Dall, supplied me with the steamer's small iron cannon, mounted on a wooden platform which he used in firing salutes at different ports on the arrival and departure of the vessel.<br>
<br>
Finding at the arsenal a supply of solid shot that would fit the gun, I had it put upon the steamer Belle, employed to carry my command to the scene of operations, and started up the Columbia River at 2 a.m. on the morning of the 27th.  We reached the Lower Cascades early in the day, when, selecting a favorable place for the purpose, I disembarked my men and gun on the north bank of the river, so that I could send back the steamboat to bring up any volunteer assistance that in the meantime might have been collected at Vancouver.<br>
<br>
The Columbia River was very high at the time; and the water had backed up into the slough about the foot of the Lower Cascades to such a degree that it left me only a narrow neck of firm ground to advance over towards the point occupied by the Indians.  On this neck of land, the hostiles had taken position, and I soon learned by frequent shots, loud shouting and much blustering; then by the most exasperating yells and indecent exhibitions, they dared me to contest.<br>
<br>
After getting well in hand everything connected with my little
command, I advanced with five or six men to the edge of a growth of underbrush until we reached the open ground leading over the causeway or narrow neck before mentioned, when the enemy opened fire and killed a soldier near my side by a shot, which just grazing the bridge of my nose, struck him in the neck, opening an artery and breaking the spinal cord.  He died instantly.<br>
<br>
The Indians at once made a rush for the body; but my men in the rear, coming quickly to the rescue, drove them back; and Captain Dall's gun being now brought into play, many solid shot were thrown into the brush where they lay concealed with the effect of considerably moderating their impetuosity.<br>
<br>
Further skirmishing at long range took place at intervals during the day, with but little gain or loss, however, to either side; for both parties held positions which could be assailed in flank; and only the extreme of rashness in either could prompt a front attack.  My left was protected by the river's backwater; and my right rested secure on the mainstream.  Between us was the narrow neck of land, to cross which would be certain death.  The position of the Indians was almost the counterpart of ours.<br>
<br>
In the evening, I sent a report of the situation back to Vancouver by the steamboat, retaining a large Hudson's Bay bateau which I had brought up with me.  Examining this, I found it would carry about twenty men, and made up my mind that early next morning I would cross the command to the other side, south side of the Columbia River, and make my way up along the mountain base until I arrived abreast of the middle blockhouse, which was still closely besieged, and then at some favorable point recross to the north bank to its relief, endeavoring in this manner to pass around and to the rear of the Indians, whose position confronting me was too strong for a direct attack.<br>
<br>
This plan was hazardous; but I believed it could be successfully carried out if  the boat could be taken with me.  But, should I not be able to do this, I felt that the object contemplated in sending me out would miserably fail, and the small band cooped up at the blockhouse would soon starve or fall prey to the Indians; so I concluded to risk all the chances the plan involved.<br>
<br>
On the morning of March 28th, the savages were still in my front; and, after giving them some solid shot from Captain Dall's gun, we slipped down the river bank; and the detachment crossed by means of the Hudson's Bay boat, making a landing on the opposite shore at a point where the south channel of the river, after flowing around Bradford's Island, joins 'the main stream.  It was then about nine o'clock; and everything had thus far proceeded favorably.<br>
<br>
But an examination of the channel showed that it would be impossible to get the boat up the rapids along the mainland, and that success could be assured only by crossing the south channel just below the rapids to the island, along the shore of which
there was every probability we could pull the boat through the rocks and swift water until the head of the rapids was reached, f rom which point to the blockhouse there was smooth water.<br>
<br>
Telling the men of the embarrassment in which I found myself, and that, if I could get enough of them to man the boat and pull it up the stream by a rope to the shore, we would cross to the island and make the attempt, all volunteered to go; but as ten men seem sufficient, I selected that number to accompany me.  Before starting, however, I deemed it prudent to find out ff possible, what was engaging the attention of the Indians, who had not discovered that we had left their front.<br>
<br>
I therefore climbed up the abrupt mountainside which skirted the water's edge, until I could see across the island.  From this point I observed the Indians running horse races and otherwise enjoying themselves behind the line they had held against me the day before.  The squaws decked out in gay colors, and men gaudily dressed in war bonnets, made the scene most attractive; but, as everything looked propitious for the dangerous enterprise in hand, I spent little time in watching them; and, quickly returning to the boat, I crossed to the island with my ten men, threw ashore the rope attached to the bow, and commenced the difficult task of pulling her up the rapids.<br>
<br>
We got along slowly at first; but soon striking a camp of old squaws who had been left on the island for safety and had not gone over to the mainland to see the races, we utilized them to our advantage.  With unmistakable threats and signs, we made them not only keep quiet, but also give us much needed assistance in pulling vigorously on the tow-rope of our boat.<br>
<br>
I was laboring under a dreadful strain of mental anxiety during all this time; for, had the Indians discovered what we were about, they could easily have come over to the island in their canoes, and by forcing us to take up our arms to repel their attack, doubtless would have obliged the abandonment of the boat; and that essential adjunct to the final success of my plan would have gone down the rapids.<br>
<br>
Indeed, under such circumstances, it would have been impossible for ten men to hold out against the two or three hundred Indians; but, the island forming an excellent screen to our movements, we were not discovered; and, when we reached the smooth water at the upper end of the rapids, we quickly crossed over and joined the rest of the men, who in the meantime had worked their way along the shore.<br>
<br>
We could be very thankful to the old squaws for the assistance they rendered.  They worked well under compulsion, and manifested no disposition to strike for higher wages.  Indeed, I was so much relieved when we had crossed over from the island and joined the rest of the party, that I mentally thanked the squaws, one and all.  
I had much difficulty in keeping the men on the main shore from cheering at our success; but hurriedly taking into the bateau all of them it would carry, I sent the balance along the southern bank, opposite the blockhouse.  When crossing to the north bank, I landed below the blockhouse some little distance and returned the boat for the balance of the men, who joined me in a few minutes.<br>
<br>
When the Indians attacked the people at the Cascades on the 26th, word was sent to Colonel Wright, who had already gone out from The Dalles a f ew miles on his expedition to the Spokane Country.  He immediately turned his column back; and, soon after I had landed and communicated with the beleaguered blockhouse, the advance of his command arrived under Lieut.  Col.  Edward Steptoe.<br>
<br>
I reported to Steptoe and related what had occurred during the past thirty-six hours, gave him a description of the festivities that were going on at the Lower Cascades, and also communicated the intelligence that the Yakimas had been joined by the Cascade Indians.<br>
<br>
When the place was first attacked, I also told him it was my belief that when he pushed down the main shore the latter tribe, without doubt, would cross over to the island we had just left, while the former would take to the hills.  Steptoe coincided with me in this opinion, and informing me that Lieut.  Alexander Piper would join my detachment with a mountain howitzer, directed me to convey the command to the island, and gobble up all who came over to it.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Piper and I landed on the island with the first boat load; and after disembarking the howitzer, we fired two or three shots to let the Indians know we had artillery with us, then ad-
vanced down the island with the whole command, which had<br>
arrived in the meantime.<br>
<br>
All of the men were deployed as skirmishers, except a small detachment to operate the howitzer.  Near the lower end of the island we met, as I had anticipated, the entire body of Cascade Indians, men, women and children, whose homes were in the vicinity of the Cascades.<br>
<br>
They were very much frightened and demoralized at the turn events had taken; for the Yakimas, at the approach of Steptoe, had abandoned them as predicted, and fled to the mountains.  The chief and head men put all the blame on the Yakimas and their allies.  I did not believe this, however, and to test the truth of their statement, formed them all in line with their muskets in hand.<br>
<br>
Going up to the first man on the right, I accused him of having engaged in the massacre, but was met by vigorous denial. ]Putting my forefinger into the muzzle of his gun, I found unmistakable signs of it's having been recently discharged.<br>
<br>
My finger was black with the stains of burnt powder; and, holding
it up to the Indians, he had nothing more to say in the face of such positive evidence of his guilt.  A further examination proved that all the guns were in the same condition.  Their arms were at once taken possession of; and, leaving a small force to look after the women and children and the very old men, so that there could be no possibility of escape, I arrested thirteen of the principal miscreants, crossed the river to the lower landing and placed them in charge of a strong guard.<br>
<br>
Late in the evening, the steamboat which I had sent back to Vancouver returned, bringing to my assistance from Vancouver, Capt.  Henry D. Wallen's company of the Fourth Infantry and a company of volunteers hastily organized at Portland; but as the Cascades had already been retaken, this reinforcement was too late to participate in the affairs.<br>
<br>
The three days' fighting ended, and the army officers caused a thorough search to be made of the surrounding timber.  A trail through the woods by which the Klickitats and Yakimas had retreated was followed for ten miles.<br>
<br>
No Indians were overtaken or captured, though a number were ascertained to have been killed.  It being established that the savages had been driven off, Colonel Wright caused to be erected two additional blockhouses, one at the Upper Cascades, and the other near the lower landing and stationed an adequate force at each.<br>

BATTLE OF THE CASCADES.<br>
<br>
Charles Carey, "The Indian War in 1856 and the Battle of the Cascades," <B>General History of Oregon.</B> Portland: Binfords and Mort, 1971, p. 604-07.<br>
<br>
The campaign in the north, in 1856, was involved more deeply in considerations of policy than of military strategy.  The federal troops in the district were reinforced, in January, by eight com-
panies of the Ninth infantry, commanded by Col.  George Wright, who was ordered by General Wool to proceed up the Columbia and to establish headquarters at The Dalles, and branch posts in the Walla Walla and Yakima valleys, and also midway between Yakima and The Dalles.<br>
<br>
General Wool, however, although he was thus determined on a policy
of occupying the country, with -a view to preventing the Indians from hunting or -fishing at their accustomed places, and so reducing them to subjection by degrees, was not favorably disposed toward white settlements in the eastern district, in advance of ratification of treaties.<br>
<br>
His campaign did not contemplate permanent protection of the white inhabitants.  Kamiakin and his fellow hostiles were first to be persuaded to enter into treaties.<br>
<br>
Wright's mission was not entirely that of a soldier bent upon war; he was an emissary, sent to open negotiations with the disaffected tribes.  Kamiakin was now the recognized leader of -all the northern disaffected Indians, and an error of judgment committed by Colonel Wright, in carrying out General Wool's orders, was responsible almost at the outset for a tragic occurrence-the siege of the stations at Cascades-by Yakima, Klickitat and Cascade Indians, under Kamiakin's leadership.<br>
<br>
There is reason to believe that Kamiakin had long realized the tactical value of this point, in his scheme to advance across the Columbia river and to invade the Willamette valley; so that, when Wright sent his soldiers east to Walla Walla, and north toward Yakima, and left only a sergeant and eight men to garrison the blockhouse at the middle Cascades, Kamiakin saw that his opportunity had come.<br>
<br>
The portages were guarded by this meager military force.  There were, also, a number of civilian employees, who were building a portage railroad to be used in transporting stores from the lower to the upper Columbia, a few men were at work unloading river<br>
steamers, and the other inhabitants were engaged in their usual vocations.  Two steamers, the Mary and the Wasco, lay in the river.  Most of the worlkmen were at the upper Cascades, where they made headquarters in the Bradford store, about a mile from the blockhouse.<br>
<br>
The Indians -attacked without warning, from ambush in the timber above the settlements, simultaneously all along the line, on the morning of March 26, 1856.  At a saw mill on Mill creek, at the upper end of the portage, a worlanan, his wife and her young brother fell at the first fire, and were scalped, their bodies being thrown into the river.<br>
<br>
The crew of the steamer, Mary, were fired on, but they defended themselves stoutly and succeeded in building fires under the boilers and getting away.  On the opposite side of the Columbia river, the steamer Wasco started up stream.  She had been lying in a position from which the attack on the Mary was clearly seen.  This frustration of the Indians' plans for a sudden and complete destruction of communications was disastrous to them, for the
steamers took to The Dalles tidings of the attack.<br>
<br>
Colonel Wright had only recently begun his march toward Walla Walla.  A courier speedily overtook his detachment and advised him of the situation at the Cascades.  He returned with as little delay as possible.<br>
<br>
A friendly Indian, meanwhile, carried the news to Fort Vancouver, and while Colonel Wright was descending the Columbia, Lieut.  Philip Sheridan, who subsequently distinguished himself in the war between the states, was on the way up river, on the small steamer called the Belle, with 40 regulars from the small number that had been left at Vancouver when Wool projected the eastern campaign.<br>
<br>
About seventy volunteers, who furnished their own arms and accoutrements, followed in two detachments on the next day.<br>
The Indians meanwhile laid siege to the Bradford store, at the upper Cascades, in which forty persons, comprising eighteen men and four women who could fight, and eighteen wounded men and children, had congregated.<br>
<br>
They also surrounded the blockhouse, where the soldiers and a smaller company of civilians had fortified themselves.  One soldier failed to reach the blockhouse, and was captured by the attackers and cruelly slain.  At the upper Cascades, a teamster who was wounded while trying to reach the store took refuge behind a rock, where he was protketed by a hot gunfire from the store, but it was impossible to succor him.<br>
<br>
During the two nights that the siege continued the Indians burned buildings to light the scene and prevent his rescue.  The store was a two-story log structure, strongly built.  It well served the purposes of a fort and, fortunately, contained a quantity of military stores.  The Indians kept up an incessant fire -at this point, giving variety to the attack by shooting lighted arrows and throwing burning faggots on the roof of the store from the overhanging bluffs.<br>
<br>
Here the civilian garrison by constant vigilance for two days and two nights maintained its position until relief arrived.  The survivors of the first attack on the lower Cascades escaped down the river in open boats.  Fourteen persons in all, including cne woman, were killed and twelve wounded.  The survivors met Sheridan, and the men volunteered to return with him to fight. 29<br>
Colonel Wright arrived at the upper Cascades early on the morning of March 28, 1856.<br>
<br>
Sheridan reached the lower Cascades only a few hours later, and landed on the Oregon side.  After reconnoitering on foot, he ascertained from friendly Cascade Indians the state of the siege, both at the blockhouse and the upper town.  Wright's men, numbering 250, speedily dispersed the enemy at the latter place, and Sheridan's smaller force, which soon reached the Washington side, met sharp resistance and was compelled to drop down the
river and entrench.<br>
<br>
With the help, however, of Willamette valley volunteers, who arrived in the steamer Fashion, and who divided the attention of the enemy, Sheridan had just reached a point near the blockhouse and located a howitzer in a favorable position, and was engaging the full attention of the Yakimas, when a cavalry bugle call signalled the approach of a troop from Wright's camp.<br>
<br>
The Indians were between the two detachments, but they were thus warned, and possible surprise and victory by Sheridan's forces faded away.  The sound of the bugle ended any hope and the Indians fled, as always had been their practice when battle turned against them.<br>
<br>
No Yakima Indians were punished for the raid, but Chenoweth, a renegade chief of the Cascade tribe, and eight others, were caught, tried by summary court-martial and hanged.  Wright then<br>
ordered that all members of the Cascade tribe found away from an island reservation which he set apart for them should be shot.<br>
<br>
He ordered a blockhouse to be erected on the bluff back of Brad-
ford's store, and another at the lower Cascades.   Both of these were garrisoned with troops.<br>
<br>
A generally regretted incident growing out of the excitement engendered by the Cascade massacre was the murder of the family of Chief Spencer, a friendly Chinook, consisting of his wife, two youths, three girls and a baby.  Spencer, who was an influential chief, had been sent for by Colonel Wright to act as interpreter in negotiations with the hostile tribes, and had taken his family with him to remain with relatives in eastern Oregon.<br>
<br>
When Wright went to the relief of the Cascades, Spencer sent his family down river to Vancouver, and they disappeared.  Lieutenant Sheridan, at the request of Joseph L. Meek, deployed a detachment as skirmishers, across the valley, and found the bodies of the en-
tire family.<br>
<br>
All had been strangled with strands of rope tied around their necks.  "The offenders," said Sheridan in his Memoirs, "were citizens living near the middle blockhouse, whose wives and children had been killed a few days before by the hostiles, but who well knew that these unoffending creatures had nothing to do with those murders."<br>

The Battle of the Clearwater<br>
<br>
Major  J. G. Trimble, United States Army, (Retired) "The Battle of the Clearwater," <B>Northwest Fights and Fighters.</B> Williamstown, Massachusetts: Corner House Publishers, 1974, p. 137-150.<br>
<br>
Upon quitting camp at Slate Creek, Oregon, I marched my troops consisting of thirty enlisted men and three officers, to a crossing some miles below the settlement on Salmon River and put them across - horses swimming men and packs by canoe.  This movement was in obedience to an order from General Howard to  join his immediate command in pursuit of the Indians in the    Salmon    River hills.<br>
<br>
The hostiles had been confronting the General's command at the mouth of the White Bird Creek. They, the hostiles, being on the farther of the river and the command under General Howard being camped on our battle-field of White Bird Creek.  After the General had collected boats, some of which I sent him from Slate Creek, and was prepared for a forward movement, the Indians began a retreat.<br>
<br>
The troops followed about the third day after the Indians had disappeared from the vicinity of the river.  On the first day's march I  joined the General's command, and we all proceeded up and over the high bluffs.  After a toilsome march of about ten miles the heights were reached and camp was made.<br>
<br>
The infantry did not arrive until after dark and the pack-train not until midnight, some animals being lost en route.<br>
<br>
That night a terrific rain-storm fell upon us.  As there were no tents except for the staff all were drenched at daylight.  I was ordered to make a reconnaissance, being the only mounted force with the command.  My orders were to ascertain which way the enemy's trail led, though that was evident from our camp as it was very broad and resembled the trace of a vast moving population.  In fact, their movements showed quite a leisurely march or retreat.  Their camps were made at short intervals and no sign of alarm or hurry was apparent.<br>
<br>
The troops took up the pursuit on the second day after, and made camp in the highlands after a march of about twenty miles.  The next day's march brought us to the bluff overlooking the Salmon River again.  As the river a bend a bend hereabouts, the Indians and the troops traversing a chord of the  semicircle, it was soon discovered that the former had again crossed the stream, and though their skill and appliances made that quite easy for them, our utter want of the same rendered it impossible for us to follow, so here we were balked.<br>
<br>
An effort was made to swim some mounted men over, but without
success, as the stream was deep and rapid and nearly the whole command inexperienced in such transit.  A raft was constructed, but after being loaded and manned, went over the rapids and was lost.  Fortunately, no one was lost with it.<br>
<br>
Well, after one night's sojourn by the river side, it was determined to retrace our way and the command started in retrograde.  On reaching the head of the canon we were met by a messenger escorted by two friendly Nez Perce Indians.  Here the disagreeable tidings were conveyed to the General that the hostiles had crossed Camas Prairie in our rear or between us and our base i. e., Fort Lapwai, and after defeating a force of two troops of cavalry at Cottonwood House were there devastating the ranches and threatening the set-
tlements.<br>
<br>
They had also met and defeated a small party of citizen volunteers, captured quite a herd of horses, and, in fact, had the whole country terrorized.<br>
<br>
After making one more camp the command was put in march for our original crossing of the river, and arriving there in the afternoon were ferried over during the next day.  Then we marched up through White Bird Canon over our first battle-field and then on to Grange-
ville, near Mount Idaho.  It was rather a sad sight to some of us <B>to </B>see the incomplete manner in which our dead had been buried, although I suppose that the heavy rains had washed the earth from the newly-made graves.<br>
<br>
Some bodies were quite exposed.  However, in due course of time all were disinterred and decently buried in the cemetery at Walla Walla, where a handsome monument was erected over them by their comrades of the regiment.  The fund for this memorial, I am pleased to say,. was originated and secured principally by the efforts of an enlisted man, my own First Sergeant, Michael McCarthy, who witnessed a number of the victims perish and who came near sharing their fate.<br>
<br>
The General reached Grangeville at dark escorted by my troops and one company of infantry.  The next morning a delegation of citizens called upon me and related all the occurrences happening in or about the prairie, at the same time asking for. guards, protection, etc.  Some urgent messengers also arrived from the Clearwater River, who told of the stress of a party of volunteers surrounded by the hostiles, whereupon preparations were made for a march in that direction.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, three troops of cavalry came up, Perr 's, Whipple's, and Winter's.  This command had been posted at Cottonwood House, distant about twenty-five miles, and were there besieged by the Indians while the latter were crossing the prairie with their immense herds.  So on the morrow we set out for the position of the hostiles on the Clearwater, not waiting for the infantry command under Colonel Miller, which had been delayed in crossing the Salmon River.
On arriving within a few miles of the hostile camp, a halt was called and camp made, as it was deemed risky to attack the Indians without the infantry and Gatling guns.  Here we learned that the volunteers, forty in number, who were surrounded, had abandoned their horses to the Indians and retreated on foot at dark.<br>
<br>
The following day everything was prepared for a forward movement, the infantry and Gatling <B>guns having</B> joined the cavalry. <B>Of </B>course, our advance was well known to the Indians; it could not be otherwise.  However, contrary to the custom of some hostiles, these, the Nez Perces, showed no disposition to flee, and our deliberate movements only gave them opportunity for greater defense, although I saw no evidence that even this advantage was improved by them.<br>
<br>
No doubt a peculiar state of feeling took possession of Joseph and his brother.  Indeed, I am inclined to believe that he did not expect a serious effort would be made to drive them from his country, or even to coerce him in extreme's, for the attack on and the dispersion of Looking Glass's band, which afterward joined his, should have been accepted as war without conditions on our part.<br>
<br>
The command moved out on this, our last march, before engaging the hostiles in the following order, namely:<br>
<br>
First, the cavalry, four troops, about one hundred and eighty men commanded by Brev.-Col. David Perry; being F Troop; Perry; L Troop, Whipple; H Troop,  E Troop, Winters, with Lieutenants Parnell, Shelton, Forse, and Knox attached.  This command was armed with Springfield carbines and Colt's revolvers.<br>
<br>
After the cavalry marched the infantry, commanded by Capt.  Evan Miles four companies strong; namely-.  Burton's, Pollocks, Joslyn's, and Miles', with Lieutenants Wood, Eltonhead, Duncan, Bailey, and Farrow, about two hundred strong.  After the infantry marched the artillery, acting as infantry, commanded by Brev.  Col.  Marcus Miller, Fourth Artillery, four companies strong; Miller's, Bancroft's, Throckmorton's, and Rodney's, about two hundred men.  Two Gatling guns drawn by horses followed with suitable cannoneers-<br>
<br>
H Troop, First Cavalry, led the advance with six troopers in the extreme front.  All were prepared for immediate contact with the enemy.<br>
<br>
To proceed: the command had marched but about four miles when my advance reported the presence of two Indian herders driving stock over the bluffs down the Clearwater River.  These men were plainly seen by me and, of course, immediately reported to the commanding officer.  
Quickly a number of men, or officers, left the main command, which was marching in column and rode to the edge of the bluff, shortly after reporting that the Indians in the small valley below were in active movement.<br>
<br>
Their camp was clearly visible with lodges standing, so the Indians were now moving up the bluff to their defenses.<br>
<br>
With the advance, and without any further orders or change of orders, I kept moving forward.  The balance of the command moved by the flank to the bluff and presently became engaged with the enemy, but they were so hotly assailed by the Indians that the were forced back upon more easily defensible ground.<br>
<br>
Now, as I quietly proceeded, though with flankers thrown out, l became considerably separated from the main command, and meeting no opposition advanced up to the edge of the bluffs, which were then across my front as I approached obliquely from my original direction.<br>
<br>
I then halted and dismounted my troop, and seeing Indians crossing the river above me, at once divined their object, which was to get in our rear.  However, being now out of employment, as soon as I heard the firing in the rear and saw the Indians crossing us, I sent my second subaltern, Knox, to report the condition of affairs and ask for orders.<br>
<br>
In a few moments the lieutenant returned with orders from Colonel Mason, chief-of-staff, to withdraw my command to the vicinity of the main force. As I was doing this I encountered the whole pack-train, under the escort of Captain Rodney's company, halted on an open mesa, or plain.  Rodney informed me that he had no orders and considered his company too small to defend the train, if attacked.<br>
<br>
I replied that if he wished to move the train back to the vicinity of the main command, I would deploy my troop on foot in his rear and thus afford support, as I suspected that the Indians would soon be all around us in accordance with their usual practice.<br>
<br>
Upon our moving back the train was so attacked, but the hostiles were driven off with a loss of two men and two pack animals on our side.  A small detached train of about six or seven animals loaded with the ammunition was also saved.  All were moved to the high ground <B>in</B> the rear of the location where the principal fighting was<br>
<br>
going on, and Rodney's and my company forming a line in the rear, the whole position was thus defended.<br>
<br>
The other troops of cavalry were, or had been, dismounted, the
horses assembled on the plateau on which the train was halted, and the men became engaged beside the infantry in what was now a defensive fight.<br>
<br>
Assaults were made on the Indian position which was established in the woods on the edge of the bluff, but each one was repulsed by the hostiles, who finally only engaged the troops at long range, although there was some fierce fighting at times and a dozen or more men were killed with a proportion of wounded.<br>
<br>
I cannot relate exactly what went on in front of the main command as I had our line to guard, though our firing was slight in comparison.  Of course, there was the usual excitement of the battle-field, and many could, no doubt, describe things very graphically.  Quite a number of the officers present were experiencing their first taste of real war, and very few of the men had been engaged this time.<br>
<br>
However, there were also quite a number who could  contemplate the affair coolly and could not notice anything extraordinary either in the resistance of the Indians, the determination of the defense, or the strategy enacted.<br>
<br>
The Nez Perces had on one or two occasions before this shown a very warlike spirit, a considerable generalship and undoubted bravery.  The present position to which the troops fell back and on which they maintained themselves was in some respects good, as the ground was higher and sufficiently undulating to make temporary earthworks easy of erection.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, as the whole line was clear of the timber, any hostile seen emerging therefrom could easily be stopped.  But the enemy had the advantage of the river, it being at their back though about a mile below by the trail.  The lines were separated about eight hundred yards and extended about half the circle inclosed, though a defense was maintained around the whole.<br>
<br>
Yet the hostiles, after the assault on the pack-train, did not attempt anything except on the line next the timber where the first fighting took place.<br>
<br>
But we were unfortunate in having no water until a small spring was discovered by one of my men, Private Fowler, who gallantly went forward under considerable fire and filled several canteens which were sorely needed by the wounded.  So I may say, without disrespect to the commanding general, that the position taken up was without much regard seemingly to the necessities of a command curtailed in limits.<br>
<br>
The cavalry horses and pack animals to the number of about three hundred were collected and held in the center of the circumference, and suffered much from want of water.  <B>For thirty hours</B> or more they were thus confine -
Well, the situation at dark was this: The troops were in the circle on the defensive, the Indians in similar manner, though upon a line or nearly so at the edge of the bluff and in the timber.  A few were killed and wounded on both sides.  I should think the area absolutely commanded by the hostiles was about twenty miles in every direction; that is, it would be unsafe for any one to venture out of our lines or immediate vicinity.<br>
<br>
When night fell there was almost complete cessation of shooting, and the Indians could be distinctly heard in various forms of expression, sometimes in earnest talk, sometimes in harangue; the chief exhorting the hardy to greater bravery on the morrow and anon reproving the delinquent.  Now and then the female voice could be detected in a plaintive wail of mourning, sometimes in low and tremulous unison, then breaking into a piercing cry.  Those of us accustomed to Indians in all situations and to our own condition in like circumstances, could readily discern the different phases of their emotional expressions.  The occasion was quite serious indeed.<br>
<br>
The clear sky, the stillness of the night, added to a feeling of weariness on our part, made the distant sounds strike the ear with an intensely mournful cadence.<br>
<br>
At daylight both sides seemed alert and long shots were given and taken.  About sunrise several of the hostiles essayed to discover if any reinforcements were on the way for us.  They would shoot out from the timber and at top speed gain the trail.  This fact required exposure, as each attempt was made a target for the long range rifle of our infantry.  I saw one horse shot, but it was astonishing to see the swiftness of their ponies and the savage maneuvers performed by those expert horsemen.<br>
<br>
I could not tell what designs were intended by our commander.  The morning seemed to be taken up in strengthening our defenses, cooking, and the various duties of camp so far as these could be carried on in our situation.  About the beginning of the afternoon a dust was descried in the direction whence we came, or toward the settlements.  In due time a herd, or train, perhaps a column of troops, was made out in the distance.<br>
<br>
All eyes were strained and many memories recalled no doubt the traditional morning watch of "Sister Anne" in Bluebeard's tower, though where additional troops were to come from in that time 1, for one, could not guess.  However, a well-defined organization was soon espied.  It was evidently relief of some kind.  Colonel Miller's command was ordered out to meet it.  These troops, four companies, marched out with very little molestation on the part of the hostiles.  
They interposed themselves, or rather Colonel Miller marched his command between the coming train and the position occupied by the enemy, a very pretty movement as we watched it from our greater elevation.  Soon the pack train, as <B>it </B>proved to be, guarded by Captain Jackson's troop, First Cavalry, was under due escort and rapidly approaching.  This gallant officer had brought the train from Fort Lapwai, some eight miles distant, safely and courageously into our very invested lines, though how without a fight was certainly singular.<br>
<br>
But now to relate the final act in the drama of " Clearwater." I wish the power of description were given me to recite this fine performance.  Colonel Miller, who always takes a prominent position in matters of duty and gallantry on the field, determined that his command should not on this occasion simply "march up hill and down gain-"<br>
<br>
He. therefore, conceived a plan either to end the battle then and there, or to test the mettle of his troops to the utmost.  After marching <B>in </B>escort, as <B>it</B> were, to the train and apparently returning with it, on reaching a point immediately in front of the Indian barricades, he quickly wheeled his battalions, and form<B>ing</B> line moved forward at double time directly on the works.  Soon both sides were engaged in deadly fusillade.<br>
<br>
Simultaneously an advance and charge were ordered and taken up by all the troops on the line confronting the Indian position, firing by volley and in skirmish order.  The yelling of the savages and the ever louder shouts of the soldiers soon changed the scenes and sounds from the setting heretofore pervading to wild exclamations and roars of impending strife.<br>
<br>
The redskins were broken and driven fleeing before the same enemy whom they had only the day before forced back, but who, reinvigorated with the long drawn breath and serious reflection of the past day and night, had come to regard the matter in deadly earnest.  The Indians fled down the high bluffs, crossed the river and joined their families.<br>
<br>
Soon they were seen slowly ascending the high hills beyond, though not in stampede.  Our Gatling guns with my own troop in support moved quickly to a point on the brow and poured in a rapid, but as I suspect ineffective, fire upon the moving tribe and also upon the now deserted village.<br>
<br>
The cavalry were soon mounted and moving down the trail in pursuit, but, owing to a rumor that a body of the hostiles were returning, after crossing the stream, they were ordered to dismount and take up a defensive position under the river-bank quite near the village, where a number of tepee frames were still standing.
As the main force of our command had to reform and prepare for an onward movement, the dead were to be collected, the wounded cared for, and the animals so long confined to be attended to, the time approached sunset before all was ready for the advance.  Consequent-
ly, when the column had' marched down the bluff and crossed the stream, it was decided to move no farther that night, and camp was made.  During the evening a number of caches were discovered and much plunder was obtained.<br>
<br>
The Indians here discarded all surplus baggage and household utensils, but, as subsequently transpired, carried off enough to serve their purposes for some months to come.  The only living, objects that were abandoned by them were about half a dozen crippled horses and one poor aged squaw.<br>
<br>
Our dead were buried on the hill above and the wounded sent under escort of a troop of cavalry back to Fort Lapwai the next day.  The following morning our command broke camp in pursuit of Joseph.  I will state some few details which may vary somewhat from other movements against Indians, and may perhaps also throw some light upon the methods and management of the Nez Perce campaign.<br>
<br>
Our generals commanding <B>had </B>arrived at the conclusion that the Nez Perce Indians were no despicable foemen, and in this opinion the troops coincided to a man.  At that time the newspapers contained no such encomiums as they displayed when recounting the wrongs suffered by the murderous Modocs, although sufficient information concerning this highly intelligent tribe was extant and their bravery in battle was well established.<br>
<br>
Before the campaign closed, however, much was written and spoken by our people in the " Far East " in eulogy of their prowess, the generalship of Joseph and <B>the sad fait awaiting his followers, but not until the </B>latter was assured.<br>
<br>
If ever a tribe of aborigines was worthy of fostering and improving side by side with <B>their </B>more powerful brethren of the human race it was the Nez Perc6s.  But no recollection of former service or common ties of humanity could stand before the white man's greed.  This is human nature, I suppose, the possession of which attribute is <B>in </B>some cases extolled as a jewel of rich inheritance.<br>
<br>
To resume, it was a lovely sight we beheld on arriving at the heights overlooking the Kamai Valley.  The fields belonging to the still loyal bands of Nez Perces were green with grain not yet ripe, the hills beyond clad <B>in</B> spring attire, the beautiful river flowing between, and the Agency buildings shining white in the background.  In fact, all nature appeared to bloom with loveliness, and
to us, who had not viewed any ripening tillage since the year before, all this cultivation seemed most inviting, especially amid the scenes enacting around us and the warlike prospects ahead.<br>
<br>
Joseph and his warriors, having nothing, passed through and among these possessions of their peaceful brothers.  He crossed the river with his own means of transport and took his stand on the bluffs beyond.  He also deployed a number of his men on the river-bank, either to dispute his passage or inflict some damage on the troops a@ they approached.<br>
<br>
This the cavalry did rather incautiously and receiving several volleys retired in some haste, if not confusion.-After a slight skirmish the hostiles retired out of range.<br>
<br>
I may say that here the second act or the second part of the campaign ended, as the troops remained here for some weeks, returned to Fort Lapwai leaving a guard which was my troop - returned again, reinforced and refitted, made several scouts here and there, and finally followed the Indian on the Lo-lo Trail after an interval of about fifteen days from the date of their departure.<br>
<br>
An incident or two connected with our scout on the Lo-lo Trail would rightfully belong to this paper to show the great assistance rendered by the loyal Nez Perces and also the brave spirit manifested by them on many occasions.  From the time these Indians signed the treaty they never swerved from their allegiance to the Government, but tilled their land, attended the church and school, and were ever ready to give their services in all matters connected with frontier settlement and the discouragement of turbulent tribes.<br>
<br>
Six of them accompanied us on this occasion and rode well ahead as advance, or flankers.  As soon as the "hostiles" were met or discovered, they rushed forward to make a parley, but were greeted with a fusillade from the rifle and two were shot, one being killed.  Then, <B>in </B>a further attempt, or perhaps retaliation, James Reuben, a very intelligent Indian, was wounded.  He made a circuit to get into our lines and the timber being quite dense came near being killed before the soldiers recognized him.<br>
<br>
Those of us who still survive that bloody affair will never forget the service rendered by these true Indians, nor the humanity and hospitality shown by their people in this our hour of adversity.<br>

BATTLE OF THE CLEARWATER.<br>
<br>
Major H.L. Bailey, "Letter regarding the Battle of the Clearwater," <B>Northwest Fights and Fighters.</B> Williamstown, Massachusetts: Corner House Publishers, 1974, p. 161-163.<br>
<br>
I believe our present excellent Quartermaster-General, Gen.  Charles F. Humphrey, got his Q. M. appointment and later a brevet for gallant services in the battle of Clearwater, July <B>11 </B>and <B>12, </B>1877, in the Nez Perces Indian War.  He was a first lieutenant, Fourth Artillery at the time.<br>
<br>
He was awarded a medal of honor March <B>2,</B> 1897, for most distinguished gallantry in action at the Clearwater, Idaho, July 11,1 877, where he voluntarily and successfully conducted, in the face of a withering fire, a party which recovered the possession of an abandoned howitzer and two Gatling guns lying between <B>the line and</B> within a few yards of the Indians, while serving as a first lieutenant, Fourth United States Artillery.<br>
<br>
On the morning of the 12th, General Humphrey and myself found ourselves apparently the only officers on the outer line where the men had dug a line of detached holes or trenches during the night.  We were very thirsty and hungry, and the fire from the Indians having slackened considerably, in their preparations for some new attacks and tricks, we insisted on each other going back to the central rendezvous where General Howard had his headquarters and supplies, to get water or coffee and some bacon.  Finally, we drew cuts and I won, taking first turn.  I found most of the officers at the headquarters.<br>
<br>
I was given an order to execute upon my return to the long section of line where Humphrey and I had met.<br>
<br>
<B>I </B>relieved him and then, alone, walked along the lines some hundreds of yards, getting the men placed at proper intervals for a grand or general charge to be made later.  I had a task, as you may imagine, as many men would run back to the holes or I trenches as soon as I had gone a few rods farther alone, but I got them into place.<br>
<br>
Away to the left I found Capt.  James A. Haughey, Twenty-first Infantry, and Lieut.  F. E. Eltonhead, Twenty-first Infantry (now both deceased), lying flat behind small head shelters with dusty sweat streaks down their faces, dodging bullets.<br>
<br>
They yelled at me to "get down" as I was "drawing fire." I was careless until two bullets tipped the earth between their heads and my ankles, when I thought it fair to squat till I got away from them again.  I left to them the arranging of the men to their left and returned to where I had left Humphrey.<br>

Later the final, beautiful charge was made, full of interesting<br>
details, for which I have not now space.  Humphrey was as cool as though at a parade or drill.  Col.  M. P. Miller (then Captain Fourth Artillery, now Brigadier-General, retired) was also as cool under fire as though taking a summer stroll.<br>
<br>
The latter was also brevetted for gallant service in this battle.  When he took his company to a point where a gap in our line permitted the Indians to climb up the river bluff and enfilade us, he was smoking a short stem pipe which good luck kept the bullets from knocking from his mouth.<br>
<br>
When placed, his men faced so that their backs were toward my company (B, Twenty-first Infantry).  It was while I was back at the center for cartridges and hospital men that his men took the men of my company for Indians, all being in the prone position in rocky, grassy ground, and as I was returning the artillery company<br>
and the infantry company were bobbing up and down firing at each other at a lively rate.<br>
<br>
Lieut. Peter Leary, Fourth Artillery, commissary officer, rushed out with a carbine flourishing in the air, shouting: " Packers to the rescue, packers and scouts to the rescue." I saw and knew the situation at a glance, as I had seen Captain Miller lead his men out and I passed Leary, rushing between the two lines, yelling: "Cease firing, you're firing into your own men."<br>
<br>
The trouble was quickly ended, though at least one poor man (Winters of my company) always believed his dreadful hip wound was by a friendly bullet.  This was during the first day of the battle.  It was Captain Jocelyn (now Colonel-General Staff, and I hope soon the next Brigadier-General), who got General Howard to send Captain Miller out to that vital part of our lines.<br>

<br>
Troops were soon hastening to the scene of trouble from all directions.  Captain Whipple, <B>in </B>Indian Valley, near the Wallows, made forced marches with Company L, First Cavalry.  The few troops at Fort Walla Walla and those near Wallula, and all available men
from Forts Vancouver, Stevens, Canby, Townsend, Klamath, and Harney, were also in motion.  The artillerymen about this time returning from Alaska were caught on the wing and turned toward Fort Lapwai.  The Call for troops was answered from California, Arizona, and even Georgia, whence came the Second Infantry.<br>
<br>
The most fearful excitement prevailed at this time, and citizens and friendly Indians and their families flocked from all directions to Fort Lapwai for protection.  All kinds of rumors as to Colonel Perry's destruction and indiscriminate massacres were flying in to the post from all sources and directions.  Lewiston was made the base of supplies and the concentration of troops was actively pushed.<br>
<br>
By June 21st, eight companies of troops (in the aggregate about two hundred and fifteen men) had arrived at Fort Lapwai, and a small organization of volunteers under Captain Paige had arrived with Captain Whipple.  The friendly Indians generously supplied a sufficiency of Indian ponies.<br>
<br>
While preparations were being made for departure to the front, Capt.  Evan Miller with several companies of the Twenty-first Infantry, Capt.  Marcus P. Miller, with several companies of the Fourth Artillery, and Captain Winters, with a company of the First Cavalry, by quick movements had arrived at Lewiston.  Lieutenant Bomus improvised a mule packtrain and impressed into the service all the transportation that could be found available.<br>
<br>
The moment of starting was solemn-the Indians were numerous and the air was full of rumors, and the daring messengers, who had skulked through from Colonel Perry to Lapwai, over roundabout and unlooked for paths largely magnified the dangers.  The column consisted of cavalry, infantry, and artillery (on foot), flanked with two Gatling guns and an old mountain howitzer, formerly used as the morning and evening gun at Fort Lapwai, all followed by an unstable packtrain of noisy mules, every animal carrying <B>its </B>maximum load.<br>
<br>
Every foot of the march over Craig's Mountain was carefully skirmished, the column proceeding at ease, stretched out about a mile.<br>
<br>
The column, under command Captain Miller, went into camp on the 22nd of June,  after the first day's march, at junction Trail (Mount Idaho and Craig's Ferry Trail).  The next morning reveille was sounded at four A.m., and a hard march was made to Norton's R-,inch.  The next day, June <B>24th</B>, was Sunday, and was spent <B>in </B>concentrating the forces as far as possible, and ascertaining the then position of the victorious Indians.<br>
<br>
On Monday a brisk movement was made forward, the infantry, bearing off to the right, went to "Johnson's Ranch," where Perry made his
stand, when retreating, and enabled his straddlers to close in.  General Howard, with the cavalry, deviated to Grangeville and there met the remnants of Perry's command and made provisions for additional supplies.<br>
<br>
Leaving the cavalry to rest until his return, the General made a hurried visit to Mount Idaho,. nearly reassured the trembling, frightened congregation of people, and ministered to the many who had suffered outrages at the hands of the Indians.<br>
<br>
Camp at "Johnson's Ranch" was broken early the next morning and the column was moved to the head of White Bird Canyon, with two objects in view - first, to bring Perry's dead, and to reconnoiter to locate Joseph and White Bird. These, with all their warriors, women, children and baggage, were well across the Salmon, and from high sharp-pointed hills were observing every movement of the troops.<br>
<br>
Joseph had at first intended to give General Howard battle before crossing the Salmon River; but changed his plans, great general that he was, and sought to draw the troops into the vicinity of the "Seven Devils," where they could be more easily cut off from supplies or flanked.  Having buried the dead and made a satisfactory reconnaissance, the command gathered, over muddy trails, at the head of the canyon, and returned to Johnson's Ranch to camp for the night.<br>
<br>
The troops were quickly gathered near the mouth of White Bird Canon.  From the high bluff lying between the forks of White Bird Creek-could be seen the <B>ir</B>regular mountain valley held by the Indians beyond the restless Salmon.  Their sentries and outposts were shouting back and forth.  While the troops were constructing rafts and preparing to cross, the Indians came from ravines and hilltops and opened fire.<br>
<br>
This was merely a ruse to engage the attention of the troops, while the main body of Indians were moving to recross the Salmon twenty-five miles lower down at Craig's Ferry.<br>
<br>
Chief Looking Glass, in the rear, was now giving trouble.  Captain Whipple was sent to the fork of the Clearwater to take <B>him </B>and his band to Mount Idaho.  Looking Glass and his band escaped to join Joseph, and Captain Whipple's cavalry proceeded to Norton's<br>
Ranch.  On the morning of July 3rd, Captain Whipple sent two citizen scouts, Foster and Blewett, in the direction of Craig's Ferry in search of indications of the presence of any Indians.  Blewett was killed; but Foster returned to camp and reported that he had seen Indians about twelve miles distant, proceeding from the direction of Craig's Ferry.<br>
<br>

Captain Whipple then hastened to send Lieut.  Sevier M.  Rains, of his company, with ten picked men and the scout Foster to recover Blewett and ascertain the strength of the enemy.  The command was soon <B>in</B> motion, and closely followed Lieutenant Rains.  Firing was soon heard in the front.  A rapid gait was assumed <B>and </B>after traveling two miles Indians were seen in force about half a mile distant; and on approaching nearer, it was found that Lieutenant Rains and every man of his detachment had been killed.  This was a<br>
terrible disaster.<br>
<br>
At the appearance of Captain Whipple's command the Indians took the back track and soon had the prairies to themselves and leisurely crossed the road between Grangeville and Cottonwood, where Colonel Perry and Captain Whipple had joined forces.  At this is war time Joseph picked up Looking Glass, and his war parties made it very lively for the troops and volunteer detachments at Cottonwood and other points.<br>
<br>
The  Two  Days  of  Hard   Fighting<br>
<br>
The <B>11</B>th  of July, the commencement of the Clearwater battle, was a memorable day.  Early on this day the troops were moving carefully through rough forests and deep ravines, over ridges and through ravines, to the confluence of the two Clearwaters.  About noon the Indians were in close proximity in several deep ravines, near the mouth of Cottonwood Creek, and were watching the approach of the troops.<br>
<br>
As quickly as possible a howitzer and two Gatling guns, mounted by a detachment under Lieut.  H. G. Otis, Fourth Artillery, were brought <B>to </B>bear on the masses of the Indians below.<br>
<br>
The Indians lost no time in running their horses up the south fork of the Clearwater, on both sides, and quickly placing their stock beyond range.  It was their intention to escape by a canon on the left, leading <B>to</B> the rear, at a small angle with the river.  But this was prevented by a quick movement of the howitzer and Gatling guns to a second bluff in that direction, beyond a deep and rocky transverse ravine, almost at right angles to the cation.<br>
<br>
Beyond the  second  bluff,  Joseph  and  his  warriors were quickly dismounted and in position, awaiting the approach of the troops and lost no time in despatching about forty or fifty mounted Indians to annoy the left flank of the approaching column.<br>
<br>
At this moment Colonel Mason, the Department Inspector-General, appeared, with Burton's and Farrow's companies of infantry, which deployed, stretching off to the right, with Winter's cavalry on his right.  All now pressed forward, in open line, under a hall of fire.
The line of troops was rapidly extended to the left by the cavalry, and to the right by the infantry and artillery battalions, gradually refusing the flanks until the bluff was entirely enveloped.  Four hundred men thus held a line about two and one-half miles in extent.  The main pack had passed by this position, but a small train was still on the road near the line of battle.  The Indian flankers, by rapid movement struck the rear of<br>
this train, killed two men and disabled two packs loaded with howitzer ammunition.<br>
<br>
The steep and high banks of the river are roughly cut with numerous most rugged transverse ravines.  The Indian camp, from which the hostiles emerged on the approach of the troops, yet hidden from view, was beyond the river, and hundreds of ponies and horses were herded in the ravines near this camp.  The warriors, finely mounted, had forded the river under cover of the bluffs and were racing up a transverse ravine, endeavoring to cut off the trains and stampede the cavalry, then dismounted and on the firing-line.<br>
<br>
From this moment the Indians manifested remarkable quickness and boldness, planted sharpshooters at every conceivable point, made terrific charge's on foot and on horseback to the accompaniment of <B>savage</B> yells and demonstrations.  Many remarkable feats of courage were noticeable throughout the engagement all calculated to encourage the warriors to follow in the bold attempts to turn the flank of the position.  All these attempts were resisted at every part of the line.<br>
<br>
At about four P.m. a spirited countercharge was made by Capt.  Evan Miles, commanding the infantry battalion, down into a ravine on the right.  Captain Bancroft, Fourth Artillery, and Lieutenants Williams and Farrow, Twenty-first infantry, were wounded at this time.  This was a desperate but successful movement, many Indians were then killed and the ravine was thoroughly cleared of a murderous enemy at short range.<br>
<br>
A little later, Captain Miller led a second charge near the center, while a demonstration was made on the right, using artillery and infantry, and thus was secured the disputed ravine near Winter's position.  Further spasmodic charges by the Indians on the left were repelled by Perry's and Whipple's cavalry and Morris's artillery.  At dark the Indians still held the only spring or water supply, in spite of many successful charges made by the troops.<br>
<br>
During the night, additional rifle-pits and barricades were constructed by both the troops and Indians, each party still hopeful of a final victory.  Firing was kept up throughout the night, every flash drawing return fire.  Under cover of darkness,
all available canteens and buckets were filled at the spring, in the midst of flying bullets, and taken to the thirsty men on the firing-line.  As promptness and courage had saved the ammunition and supplies, so gallant exposure during the darkness saved the water-supply.<br>
<br>
At daylight of the 12th every available man was on the line.  By a magnificent feat, executed with great spirit by Miller and Perry, with Otis's howitzer, the supply of  water was captured from the Indians and brought within the lines.  This enabled the famished troops on the firing-line to have a taste of coffee, and consequent new life and energy.<br>
<br>
The artillery battalion was then withdrawn from the-lines and held as a reserve force for any offensive movement that might become necessary.<br>
<br>
The firing was rapid throughout the day, the Indians from time to time threatening to force the weaker parts of the line and fighting at very close range.  About three P.m. a dust appeared in the distance, toward the South, beyond the Indian position.  This proved to be an approaching pack-train, escorted by Captain Jackson's company of cavalry.<br>
<br>
The artillery battalion under Captain Miller was immediately sent out to meet it, and after considerable skirmishing, brought it safely in.  Captain Miller, instead of returning with the train and reinforcements, marched slowly by the right flank toward us, and when <B>crossing</B> the Indian line, faced to the left and quickly and rapidly moved in line for nearly a mile across our front, and repeatedly charged the Indians' positions.<br>
<br>
The Indians made a desperate effort, by ferocious charges, to turn his left flank; this, however, failed as Rodney's reserve company in the rear quickly deployed and flanked the flankers.  There was a most stubborn resistance at Joseph's barricades for a while, when suddenly the hole Indian line gave way and the Indians, closely pursued, rushed down the canyons and crossed the south fork of the Clearwater.<br>
<br>
The infantry pressed them to the river opposite their main camps and there awaited the cavalry, which slowly worked its way through the ravines, over rocks and down precipices over steep and craggy trails.  The Indian camp was taken after the Indians had hurriedly left it and were fleeing in all directions up the heights and going to the left of Cottonwood Creek.<br>
<br>
The Indian camp so hastily abandoned had the lodges still standing filled with blankets, buffalo robes, cooking utensils and plunder of all descriptions.  The many dead and wounded horses in the camp and along the trails leading to it indicated the great damage done
by the troops <B>in </B>this desperate engagement.<br>
<br>
General Howard had four hundred fighting men <B>in</B> this two days' engagement, and it is remarkable that only thirteen were killed and twenty-two wounded.  The Nez Perces fought with great skill and obstinacy and were more than five hundred strong, not including the squaws or women, who assisted in providing spare horses, and doing all manner of things, while acting, as a substantial reserve.<br>

<br>
The Clearwater River, flowing almost due north, lies some fifteen miles east of where we saw the Nez Perces on July 5, in the preceding chapter.  Here the Indians had gathered to await developments.  General Howard had meanwhile lost track of his extremely mobile opponents.  As we see in this chapter, it was only more or less by accident that he stumbled upon their camp.<br>
<br>
Our party, in revisiting the sites of the war, climbed to the summit of the formidable high tableland known as Battle Ridge, where on July 11 and 12, 1877, the battle of the Clearwater was fought.  Yellow Wolf led the way directly to the most narrow point of the ridge.<br>
<br>
Here, from the brow of the canyon skirting the north side of the battlefield proper, we had an unobstructed view of the country for miles to the north, where General Howard's army first came in sight.  With another unhurried look around, the old warrior resumed his story.<br>
<br>
It was about ten o'clock in the morning, a sun or so after we took horses from soldiers on Possossona.  Some boys and men were racing horses on the narrow strip of level land along the Clearwater below our camp.  I was sitting on my horse watching them, when Wemastahtus called to me, "Yesterday a soldier was killed below here.  I saw him."<br>
<br>
I rode down to see the dead soldier.  I found him lying by the trail.  He had a mustache, but nothing else appeared about him to note.  It was afterwards thought he had run away from the army.  Alone, he could not defend himself.<br>

Just then I heard a noise at the races.  I moved away a short distance, dismounted and sat down on a boulder.  I could still hear an excitement at the races.  I sat there some time, thinking.  Then I heard the boom of a gun report.  Sounded like the shot of a big gun-a distance away.  I listened hard! It was a strange sound passing through the air that I now heard.<br>
<br>
Then came a loud explosion near the racers.  That shell-shot was from the high mountain bluff beyond the river-north side of this canyon.  Immediately a scout came riding hard down the slope from that direction.  Waving his blanket, he called across the river, "Soldiers surrounding us! Soldiers surrounding us!"<br>
<br>
It was sure enough! I saw soldiers strung out a long way off; f ar up along the mountain's brow.'<br>
<br>
I jumped on my horse and galloped to camp.  I stripped for the battle.  I got my rifle and cartridge belts, two of them.  One I wore around my waist; the other, across my left shoulder and under the right arm.  I always carried them that way.<br>
<br>
The  chiefs  called  an  order,  "Split  up!  Make   three<br>
bodies!<br>
<br>
About twenty of our young  warriors  joined   together. Chief Toohoolhoolzote was our leader.  The  other   two companies must stay at camp. We hastened upriver   a short  ways.  We  crossed      and  rode  into  the  timber.   We hurried up the wooded slope of a canyon, leading to south side of this battlefield.<br>
<br>
I was ahead as scout, and reached the ridge-brow first.  Looking north, I saw many soldiers.  They were getting ready for the war.  I saw a big bunch of them heading down toward our camp across the river.  Pointing, I called to the others, "Can you not see the soldiers? What they are doing? Let us go closer and do shooting!"<br>
We ran our horses across the flat, down into this canyon and up the other side a ways.  We tied them in some small, scattered timber, and hurried afoot up to the flats.<br>
<br>
We had to stop those soldiers going to our camp. A few other warriors joined us, making about twenty four to fight General Howard's army.<br>
<br>
You see a white house far away to the left yonder? It is in foreground of trees.  That black spot to its right is a thornbush clump.  We were left of that thicket only a few steps.<br>
I heard our chief call, "Come, boys! We will make a rifle pit."<br>
At that place we worked fast.  Piling up stones, we soon had a good shelter.<br>
<br>
Chief Toohoolhoolzote then said, "Stay here.  I am going up a short way."<br>
<br>
Holding close to earth, the chief crawled up the hill.  He did not
pass from our sight.  Soon we heard a rifle shot.  Our chief had killed a soldier.<br>
<br>
His rifle a muzzle-loader, it was a little time before we heard a second shot.  Another soldier had been killed.<br>
<br>
Smoke of that last shot drew a storm of bullets.  But they did no harm.  Chief Toohoolhoolzote's Wyakin' was strong.<br>
<br>
We were firing whenever soldiers could be seen.  Bullets were striking our stone fort.  Chief Toohoolhoolzote crawled back to us.  The firing was making our horses uneasy.  They might break loose.  Toohoolhoolzote gave command that four go hold them, the rest to stay and beat back the soldiers.  None of us were hit, but we saw some of our bullets found marks.<br>
<br>
Soldiers were strung out a long ways and advancing.  Some were close to us.  Indians and soldiers fighting almost together.  We could not count the soldiers.  There must have been hundreds.  Bullets came thicker and thicker.<br>
<br>
Our chief looked around.  It was early afternoon.  A long while before dark would come.  He saw we were hemmed in on three sides and gave orders that we go.  He was last to leave.  We crawled a ways, then ran.  We hurried, for bullets were singing like bees.  My heart beat fast.  Thinking only for escape, I ran away from my waiting horse.  Nobody stopped for horses.  All were running to cross the ridge about where we are now standing.  I, too, kept on for a little ways.<br>
<br>
Then I came to myself.  I missed my horse, and I grew hot with mad! I made myself brave! I turned and ran for my horse many soldiers shooting at me.' Why, I did not care what I ran into! I got my horse and led him away.  The boys caring for the horses had escaped on their own.  The enemies got all the others.<br>
<br>
With soldiers still shooting, I jumped on my horse and galloped down the hill.  Crossing the canyon, I came to left of here.  As I drew up to higher ground, bullets fell about me.  I could see dust spurt up where they struck the earth.  I whipped my horse for all in him.  A swift horse, light black [brown] in color.  He began slowing down, breathing hard.<br>
<br>
I whipped the more, and finally we passed over the saddle ridge just west of here.  Out of sight of the soldiers, my horse could take a good rest.<br>
<br>
While making that ride, I thought it my last day.  My feelings were that I was not much excited.  Before that time, my uncle, Old Yellow 'Wolf, had said to me, "If you go to war and get shot, do not cry!"<br>
<br>
I remembered that instruction.  It helped me to be brave.  If we die in battle, it is good.  It is good, dying for your rights, for
your country.<br>
<br>
When I reached timber south of this saddle ridge, I dismounted and tied my horse.  I came where some older men had built the big "Smoking Pit." Sheltered from all danger, I saw lots of people there smoking.  Most of them old, they were not fighting.  I passed them.  I did not like tobacco or any kind of smoking.  I was afraid to smell it.<br>
<br>
I ran eastward to where I heard shooting. I came where four men were fighting.  They were my uncle, Old Yellow Wolf, Otstotpoo, Howwallits [Mean Man], and Tomyunmene.  The three older men's faces were bleeding.  Rock chips from flying bullets were doing the work.<br>
<br>
These warriors had rifle pits among some boulders.  Not too big, the rocks, but about right size for concealment.  I dropped down behind one of them." We were now five, all fighting in thick smoke.  Like smoke rolling up from burning woods.  My uncle was shot in the head and lay dead for a while.  But returning to life,' he helped on with the fight.<br>
<br>
This fighting was with the cavalry only.  Later, foot soldiers came.  I did not know which officer was in charge, unless General Howard.  I watched for him, but did not see him."<br>
<br>
Most shooting was now from the whites.  I heard the cannon guns and was scared.  I lay close to the ground.  I did not know to shoot or not.  I heard my uncle say, "I am thirsty! I will crawl to the koos [water] and drink."<br>
<br>
He did so, and came only part way back.  I saw him crawling slowly, rolling a boulder ahead.  Hidden behind that not large boulder, he advanced for closer shooting at the soldiers.  He passed from my sight.  I heard him shoot a few times.<br>
<br>
Wishing <B>to </B>check statements from other warriors, I interrupted here and asked if it were true that the soldiers were unable <B>to </B>determine from what point the Indian bullets came, even in open ground.  Yellow Wolf replied, "The little boulder is good for hiding behind.  Our rifle pit was already made." I could see he meant that the outcropping rocks served the same purpose as a dugout rifle pit.<br>
<br>
I lay flat, seeing nothing, hearing only the battle.  I did not know all had left when the soldiers' firing was the<br>
hottest.  Other warriors all gone, and still I lay there.<br>
One of the brave men, looking back, saw me and thought, "Why is he lying there? Must be wounded!" Sounds  came  to  my  left   ear.   A voice speaking, "Who are you, lying flat? Soldiers are close coming!"<br>
<br>
I looked to my left.  I saw nobody.  I did not get up.  I heard the same voice again, and a whip struck me.  What I heard
was,"Heinmot Hihhih! Are you wounded? Why you not shooting? Kill some soldiers.  They will kill you if you do not defend yourself!"<br>
When I heard that voice, I was convinced what to do.  I raised up.  It was 'Wottolen [Hair Combed Over Eyes] who had called me, who had struck me.  He was one of the commanders.<br>
<br>
Soldiers, armed, were about thirty steps from me.  I grew mad to see them so close.  Struck with the whip, I showed myself brave.  I now was not afraid of death.  From between the boulder rocks, I pushed my rifle.  I fought like a man, firing five or six shots. just then I heard heavy breathing.  Otstotpoo had come back to me.  Hearing the firing, he knew I had been left alone.<br>
<br>
He said to me, "Dear son, we are going to die right here! Do not shoot the common soldier.  Shoot the commander! "<br>
<br>
I understood.  I looked for an officer.  He was just back<br>
of his men.  All were crouching.  I fired, and that officer went down.  Another one seemed taking his place, I dropped him.  Those officers did not get Up. No one now to drive the common soldiers, they fell back in retreat.  Those two officers killed, common soldiers retreating, the warriors returned to their rifle pits.<br>
<br>
The  soldiers  were  being  whipped  in  another  part   of   the<br>
field."  A  supply  train  coming  from   the   south   was   nearly captured by warriors of the other two bodies who came up from the camp.  They almost took that train.' Of course I was not in the fighting there.<br>
<br>
Not all three companies of warriors could leave camp until they saw the soldiers being held on the mountain.<br>
<br>
Came complete sundown.  The firing almost quit.  With darkness was heard only occasional shots.  The five chiefs gave order, "Warriors, do no more fighting tonight!<br>
<br>
Half the warriors went down to camp.  'Women, children, and old people to be guarded.  Horses must not be lost.  The others of us, we did not run from the soldiers.  Only did what the chiefs commanded.<br>
<br>
I had only moccasins and breechcloth.  But with the darkness, I did not leave.  About midnight came stronger cold.  It was then I left my pit.  The big Smoking Lodge where no-fighters stayed, smoking and counseling, safe from bullets, was many rods southwest.  I found several men lying there.  I did not stop.  I saw one man lying where horses were tied.<br>
<br>
I asked to sleep with him on account of the cold.  He answered "Yes." Then I knew my own brother [cousin], my aunt's son, Teminisiki [No Heart].  As I lay down with him, I heard a woman speaking, "May I stay with you? I have no blanket.  I get cold!"<br>
My brother replied, "Come on! Get here between us! You will keep
<br>
warm."<br>
<br>
The woman did as invited.  I remembered instructions from old people.  In wartime man cannot sleep with woman.  Might get killed if he does.  Because of this, got up and went back to my rifle pit.  No shirt.  No leggings.  Only breechcloth and moccasins. just as stripped for war.  I stayed there until daylight.  Stayed until the fighting began again<br>
.<br>
My brother Teminisiki was killed in our next hard battle, the Big Hole!"'<br>
<br>
Next morning began the fighting again.  In first skirmishing it seemed soldiers had drawn a little nearer.  Had made barricades during the night.  Four of us were fighting f rom behind our boulder shelter.  The same warriors, same barricade as the night before.  Shots from the soldiers were not scattering.  Their volleys became one continued roar.  I paid attention to myself only, what I was doing.  I thought nothing about the warriors with me.<br>
<br>
I got a bullet here in my left arm, near the wrist.' When it struck me, I rolled on the ground, it hurt so.  But I said nothing! Then I was hit Just under my left eye.  It was a piece of bullet or a chip from the boulder.  Blood ran down my face.  That eye was dimmed for the rest of my life.<br>
<br>
The battle continued some hours.  It must have been about ten o'clock, and soldier bullets still rained.  Of course there was some cannon shooting.  The soldiers began leaving their shelters, coming towards us.<br>
<br>
Suddenly I heard my partner, Wottolen, call to me: "Nobody here! We will quit!"<br>
<br>
I raised partly up.  No Indians could be seen fighting.  All had left the battle!' Wottolen and myself were holding back the troops.<br>
<br>
I now understood why soldiers crowded so.  No warriors opposing them!<br>
<br>
All yesterday fighting; all this morning they did not crowd us.  But now, meeting no Indian bullets, they came charging bravely.<br>
Then I ran, again forgetting my horse.  I ran back where he was tied in the timber edge.  Mounting, I started down the mountainside.<br>
<br>
It was through woods, open places, over rocks and steep bluffs.  But my horse never missed footing.  Crossing the river and reaching where the now empty camp stood, I heard a woman's voice.  That voice was one of crying.  I saw her on a horse she could not well manage.  The animal was leaping, pawing, wanting to go.  Everybody else had gone.
I hurried toward her, and she called, "Heinmot! I am troubled about my baby!"<br>
<br>
I saw the baby wrapped in its tekash [cradleboard] lying on the ground.  I reached down, picked up the tekash, and handed it to the woman.  That mother laughed as she took her baby.  It was the cannon shots bursting near that scared her horse.  She could not mount with the little one.  She could not leave it there.  Riding fast, we soon overtook some rear Indians entering the canyon.  We were then out of reach of cannon shots fired from the high mountain bluff.<br>
<br>
This woman with the little baby was Toma Alwawinmi [possibly meaning Spring of Year, or Springtime], wife of Chief Joseph.  Her baby girl was born at Tepahlewam camp a few days before the White Bird Canyon battle, but it died in the hot country [Indian Territory] after the war.<br>
<br>
I did not ask why she was as I found her.  Chief Joseph left the battlefield ahead of the retreat.  Seeing it coming, he hurried to warn the families.  He could not leave his wife had he known.  The women were all supposed to be ahead.  A bad time everybody busy getting away.<br>
<br>
APPENDIX I<br>
<br>
Of this attack on his supply train, General Howard says:<br>
" . . . four hundred men held a line of two miles and a half in extent.  My main pack train had passed by this position.  A small train with a few supplies was on the road nearer us.<br>
<br>
"The Indian flankers, by their rapid movement struck the rear of the small train, killed two of the packers and disabled a couple of mules loaded with howitzer ammunition.  The prompt fire from Perry's and Whipple's cavalry saved the ammunition from capture.<br>
I had previously sent an orderly to conduct the train within my lines; the fierce onset of the Indians requiring greater haste, Lieutenant Wilkinson, aide-de-camp, being sent, brought in the trains under cover of Rodney's [artillery] and Trimble's [cavalry] companies." ("Report of the General of the Army," 1877, p. 122.  See also Howard, Nez Perce Joseph, P. 159.)<br>
<br>
That General Howard's supply train was more nearly captured than is revealed by his official report, is disclosed by the following from interpreter Williams.<br>
<br>
"Some years ago I was told by one of General Howard's Nez Perce scouts named Mathews, that the soldiers were driven back onto the General's lines or headquarters in a swarm, and that he heard an Indian calling at the top of his voice that he had the cannon in his possession, but was alone.  Of course he lost it when General Howard charged his men back again.<br>
<br>
"This Indian was supposed to have been one of the four that were
killed in that battle; for no warrior was ever heard to speak<br>
about taking the big gun.  Red Thunder was the only Indian killed near that part of the field.<br>
<br>
"A man who said that his name was Adkinson, and that he had served in General Howard's army, told me it was a single Indian who killed the head packer and captured two mules loaded with ammunition, but could not hold them lone-handed.  The Indians were scattered-not many at any one place at that time."<br>

Harry Lee Bailey was in the battle of the Clearwater as second lieutenant, Company B, Twenty-first Infantry, and was breveted for bravery.  In regard to <B>the </B>opening of the fight, Bailey wrote me under date of Jan. 29, 1934:<br>
<br>
"The Indian camp was passed by General Howard with only a vague idea of the Indians' location, and we were <B>one </B>or two miles beyond the camp location before <B>we might </B>say-the Indians discovered us.  Possibly someone at the end <B>of </B>our long column might have seen the Indian camp, or some Indian coming from it, and passed up the alarm.  I do not know which.<br>
<br>
"The gatling guns and howitzer were rushed to the rim of the high cliff to our left and we fired some volleys which <B>may</B> have been the real awakening, of the enemy.... Apparently they were without any good outposts and were really ignorant of our so near approach."<br>
<br>
General Howard in his official report states that the Indians were discovered <B>by</B> his aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Fletcher, about twelve o'clock, and it was judged from their motions that they "had just discovered our approach."<br>
<br>
It was one o'clock when <B>a </B>"howitzer and two gatling guns were firing towards the masses of Indians below.("Report of the General of the Army," 1877, p. 122.)<br>

BATTLE OF THE CLEARWATER<br>
<br>
David Lavender, "Battle of the Clearwater" <B>Let me be free. The Nez Perce Tragedy.</B> New York: HarperCollins, 1992. p. 261-266.<br>
<br>
Howard was three days behind the Nez Perces when he faced his second crossing of the Salmon River.  Although his cavalrymen might be able to swim their horses, the infantry and artillerymen would need transport.  Accordingly, the general ordered the tearing down of a nearby cabin and the construction of a raft from its timbers.<br>
<br>
A gang of soldiers hanging onto a rope, which in turn was belayed around a tree, would ease the raft into the current, which at that point was angling toward the opposite shore.  As the craft approached that shore, a soldier would leap off the raft with another line and anchor it to another tree.  Presto-a ferryboat!<br>
Alas, the current was strong, the raft heavy, and the improvised cable insufficiently strong.<br>
<br>
The cable snapped, and the raft bucked off downstream with the handful of men who were supposed to anchor the boat to the opposite shore.  After a wild ride the men managed to reach Howard's side of the river and hike back to their chagrined commander.  The episode produced in the general a strong case of sour grapes.<br>
<br>
Scout James Reuben had just informed him that the Indians he was chasing had reached the Camas Prairie and were heading toward lower Cottonwood Creek and the South Fork of the Clearwater.  So! The army would not lose much time by returning through the mountains to the site of its first crossing.  There they would once more press the miners' rowboats into service, after which they would climb White Bird Hill and hurry to Grangeville, where they would reoutfit and continue the pursuit."<br>
<br>
On reaching the little hamlet late in the evening of June 8, Howard ran into a clangor of criticism from the frightened citizens-they claimed the rebels had burned several buildings while crossing Camas Prairie-and from journalists who had arrived to report the story of this most recent great Indian war for their papers.<br>
<br>
The yappings must have been hard to take.  Did this gilded veteran of the Civil War know what he was doing? For three weeks he had been outmaneuvered again and again by a rabble of primitive Indians burdened with their wives, children, and massive herds of loose horses.<br>
<br>
Did he realize that at least forty white soldiers-"our boys"-had perished, whereas only one Indian had been killed? In fact, the
Nez Perces were stronger now than they had been only a few days before.  Looking Class!-in the name of all the holies, why had Howard let that happen? And with that Howard received a blast of bad news that really did shake him.<br>
<br>
While he had been preparing for the first crossing of the Salmon, he had received from both Fort Lapwai and Mount Idaho, alarming stories about Look<B>ing </B>Glass's people, whose village lay close to the confluence of the Middle Fork and South Fork of the Clearwater.  The tales said that those reservation Indians were sending recruits and supplies to the fugitive Nimipus.<br>
<br>
Without investigating the charges-they may have been planted by ne'er-do-well whites looking for plunder if a battle resulted Howard ordered Captain Whipple to move Looking Glass's entire band to Mount Idaho until the rebels were out of the way. 1 4 The nontreaty Indians at the Salmon had seen the captain who had been given the assignment march off with two companies of cavalry and a Gatling gun.<br>
<br>
Whipple had reached Looking Glass's village early in the morning.  A few Indians, seeing the soldiers start down the canyon slope in a long skirmish line, ran out to ask the cause.  Surrender? But why?-and then an unnamed volunteer discharged his rifle.  The whole hillside thereupon erupted with a crash of guns.<br>
<br>
The terrified inhabitants, most of whom had been in their tipis unaware of the whites' intrusion, fled in disorder, some into the forest, some across the adjoining stream.  A few were killed or wounded.  The troops burned several tipis, swooped up some plunder, and drove off a reputed seven hundred horses.  But the band remained intact-and enraged.  <B>"A </B>hornet's nest," Howard wrote ruefully in a later account."<br>
<br>
Looking Glass prepared to sting.  He and a neighboring chief, Red Owl, left their devastated villages and moved upstream to a broad, flat alluvial bar formed where Cottonwood Creek ran into the South Fork.  There they went into camp with the fugitives who had just come down from Camas Prairie.  They easily persuaded Husishusis Kute to follow.<br>
<br>
Several of Joseph's and Ollokot's people who had slipped away from the Tepahlewan troubles to the safety of the reservation some weeks before now rejoined their friends.<br>
<br>
Disgusted with the course of events, forty-three volunteers from four different squads who were loafing around Grangeville decided to combine and do a little unauthorized fighting on their own.  After electing Ed McConville of Lewiston as their colonel-Ed had soldiered in the Civil War-they borrowed horses from the bunch Whipple had appropriated from Looking Glass's village and rode north along the left (west) side of the South Fork.  
They found the camp of the nontreaty coalition and by courier notified Howard, adding that they planned to attack if a good opportunity presented itself.  Unfortunately for that ambition, the Indians also found them and attacked first, driving them to the top of a nearby hill the volunteers later named, with reason, Mount Misery.<br>
<br>
During the night Ollokot, Rainbow, and Five Wounds led a surprise raid that stampeded the white men's horses.  The Indians then let the whites sit there and think things over while they grew more and more hungry and thirsty.  Eventually a small party sent by Howard did reach them with orders to hang on; the army would be along soon.<br>
<br>
Howard's force did not show when expected, however, and the whites, increasingly uncomfortable, decided to sneak off their hill, to fight another day.  The warriors let them go, thinking, apparently, that there was no use risking unwanted casualties at the hands of people who were no longer in shape to do the refugee camp any harm .<br>
<br>
Conjecture now.  The embattled Indians had always seen the volunteer units associated with uniformed soldiers.  So they thought at first that Howard's troops were somewhere close by.  But he had not appeared when the whites clearly needed him.  This must mean the army was not nearby.  On top of that the Indians were overconfident.  Each time they had fought either volunteer units or troops, they had emerged victorious.  Now, with the addition of the new bands, they numbered 250 or so warriors.<br>
<br>
Surely, they were safe, at least for the time being.  They could enjoy the hot day after long spells of rain.  They'd swim, race horses on a meadow a little distance downstream from the camp, or just loll around their tipis.  Many of them also took time to dig caches for holding family treasures, to be retrieved some joyous day after they had won peace by creating a standoff with their evasions and their challenges.<br>
<br>
A little before noon, July 11 : Howard was not west of the river, as the Nez Perces supposed, but in the rugged, heavily forested country to the east.  He was there because his guide, Ad Chapman, knew that the old road from the mining towns of Pierce and Oro Fino to the agricultural and supply towns of Mount Idaho and Grangeville followed that side of the stream, albeit a couple of miles back, to head the frequent ravines that dropped steeply off the flat-topped ridges to the South Fork.<br>
<br>
The general may have been thinking, too, of a plan he had discussed somewhat superficially with McConville's couriers.  He would lead his 400-plus soldiers and 150 or more packers along the road past the camp.  As soon as he had gone far enough to escape detection, he would drop into the valley and swing upstream, catching the Nez Perces by surprise.  Simultaneously the volunteers would strike downstream.  Between them they would grind
the rebels to pieces.  About time!'<br>
<br>
On he plodded, unaware that the volunteers, having received no courier bearing word of the plan, were even then retreating toward Grangeville.  He didn't know, either, exactly where the Indians were camped.  He almost passed the place. in fact, the lead elements of his long column did go too far.  He was checked by one of his officers who, out of curiosity, happened to ride out onto a protruding rim that gave a long view of the valley floor.  There the quarry were, far below, unsuspecting but some distance upstream.<br>
<br>
Howard halted the column.  After ordering the leading companies and the forward part of the mule train to come back, he moved with his artillery to the viewpoint on the brow.  Another blunder.  The range was almost too far for his artillery and Gatling guns.  The firing accomplished little more than to stir up another hornet's nest of surprised Indians.<br>
<br>
Seeking a better position, Howard took the command around the head of a ravine to a big grass flat, bordered on all sides by trees-a fringe along the top of the valley slope; ruffles in the ravines that creased the north and south sides of the meadow; and, more than a mile to the rear, an almost solid wall of evergreen forest.  Here and there inside the flat were lone trees and boulders strewn through tall grass that was beginning to head and turn brown."<br>
<br>
The army's maneuvering for position took time.  The Indians used it to advantage.  Their unwavering goal, as usual, was to save the camp with its women and children.  Stripping off most of their clothing, an act that was practically a prerequisite for battle, and swinging onto the prized war horses that were always kept close to the tipis, one group of warriors clustered on the south (upstream) side of the village, the direction from which McConville had approached.  A larger group raced to the north side, the area from which the cannonballs had come.<br>
<br>
Seeing instantly that the hillside to the east was open, fierce old Toohoolhoolzote bawled for followers and lunged his horse up the nearest ravine.  It was steep and rocky, but not impassable for the two dozen riders who fell in behind.  The riders gained the top just as the first soldiers were emerging onto the flat at a diagonal from where the Indians were.  Most of the warriors scattered along the brow of the hill.  Their unexpected fire started the enemy milling.<br>
<br>
Under cover of the confusion, Ollokot, Rainbow, and Five Wounds, who more and more were acting in concert, spurred their horses toward the lead part of the pack train, just then coming into sight.  They almost seized it, but there weren't enough of them and they were beaten back after killing two of the packers.<br>
<br>
Gradually positions solidified.  Dismounted Indians held the brow
of the hill and the ravines that bordered the broad flat.  Their line was thus shaped like a thin crescent moon.  Howard was all but under siege.  He sent the cavall ry horses and pack animals to the forested hillock at the rear of the flat.  He set up his command post in a depression not quite between the tips of the crescent and arranged his troops in a large ellipse, its back curve sparsely occupied.<br>
<br>
Upwards of four hundred soldiers and about a hundred civilians who were capable of handling guns were involved.  Since the Indian camp in the valley was never left unguarded, it is unlikely that many more than a hundred Indians were ever on the firing line at one time.  They were, however, coot enough and skillful enough to keep the enemy, most of them untested in battle, hugging the ground behind low, hastily created walls of rock.  The Indians, too, extemporized stone shelters.<br>
<br>
The lines were far apart, as much as six hundred yards in places.  During the long night, there were occasional sorties as a company of soldiers tried to outflank the braves or a war party of Nez Perces sought to break through what they supposed was a weak part of Howard's lines.  Thirst became an acute problem for the whites. (The Indian women, slipping and stumbling in the dark, lugged water up the steep hillside to their fighters.)<br>
<br>
At sunrise the Americans achieved their first success.  Backed by howitzer fire, they seized a vital spring.  For the most part, though, the fighting was slow and inconclusive, not attuned to Indian concepts of warfare.<br>
<br>
Why risk casualties for nothing? Under the increasing heat of the sun, a small group here and another there began to drift down into the valley.  The shift was orderly-Howard seems not to have noticed it at first-but the chiefs, meeting under an overhanging rock, understood well enough what was happening.  To prevent complete disintegration, they told Joseph, who had been fighting on the lines like any other brave, to prepare the camp for another flight.<br>
<br>
By rallying the Indians who remained at the top of the slope, the war leaders would hold the troops back until the camp chief signaled that the exodus of about 550 frightened noncombatants was ready."<br>
<br>
The frantic packing started too late.  About 2 P.M. a company of cavalry, which had come all the way from Fort Klamath in southern Oregon in response to Howard's cry for reinforcements, appeared on the road from Grangeville.  The general, who at last had noticed the slackening in the Nez Perce fire, sent a courier racing to the newcomers.  Signals were agreed on; a charge was ordered.  Under its impact, the last Nez Perces on the line fled headlong.<br>
<br>
As the howitzers lofted cannonballs into the camp, the Indian women, abandoning their tipis, began climbing onto their saddle
animals while the older boys rounded up the loose horses.  Knots of warriors braced to cover the disorderly retreat, but what saved the Indians was the river.<br>
<br>
The whites weren't used to plunging headlong into a stream and floundering across.  Most of the infantrymen, halted on the bank, waiting for the cavalrymen to reatize the trouble, pick them up, and carry them across.  By that time the last Indians had pulled out of the camp, and the whites fell to plundering among the tipis, most of them still standing.<br>
<br>
Unopposed, the fugitives streamed up Cottonwood Canyon as if returning to Camas Prairie.  That was not their destination, however.  As the panic faded, Joseph, White Bird, and the other chiefs restored order and pulled the rebel column together.  They had made a nearly disastrous mistake in allowing the white army to come upon them undetected.<br>
<br>
Sorely hurt, they needed time and space in which to re-form and face again the question, What next?<br>
<br>
Only two areas really suited their strategy of evasion.  One they had already exploited-the tumbled mountains where the Salmon and Snake rivers converged, with the Wallows country just beyond.  Going back would mean fresh exposure on the Camas Prairie, flanked by Fort Lapwai on one side and the Grangeville volunteers on the other.<br>
<br>
They had better cling to the tangled ridges east of the Clearwater, toward which they had been traveling when they had made their ill-judged pause.  Unfortunately, the trail they wanted to follow into the area headed several miles to the north, close to the Christian Indian settlement of Kamiah.  To get there, they would have to circle around the soldiers in their erstwhile camp.  Later they would worry about the potentially hostile Indians at Kamiah.<br>
<br>
They avoided Howard's troops by moving a short distance up Cotton-
wood Canyon and then swinging north along a broad, high ridge that paral, leled the north-flowing river.'o Soon they were abreast of, but high above, their abandoned camp.  Surely a few of them edged to the rim and looked down with mingled relief and sorrow.  The soldiers would not be following for awhile.<br>
<br>
They were too busy looting the place, even using their ramrods to probe for caches. (Later the whites would take rowboats loaded with beautifully quilled and beaded artifacts downstream for sale at Fort Lapwai and Lewiston) General Howard was doing nothing to stop them.  As far as he was concerned, the Battle of the Clearwater was over-and he had won.<br>

THE NEZ PERCE WAR: THE BATTLES AT COTTONWOOD CREEK,  <B>1877</B><br>
<br>
Dorothy O. Johansen, "The Nez Perce War, the battles at Cottonwood Creek, 1876," <B>Washington Historical Quarterly.</B> XXVII ( 1936) p. 167-170.<br>
<br>
The following document was found among the papers of the Simeon G. Reed Collection at Reed College, Portland, Oregon.  It consists of 
eight tissue <B>sheets </B>torn from a letter-press book and was found filed in a volume of letters of the years 1878-79.  As the report was evidently taken in dictation, punctuation is almost wholly 
lacking, except for double bars. Where <B>necessary </B>to the <B>meaning, 
</B>periods have been indicated in this edition by double spacing.<br>
<br>
Lewiston July 7th 1877  (Nez  Pierce   Wars)<br>
<br>

<B>Via Wallula 9th</B><br>
<br>

<B>The last battles-Wednesday and Thursday </B>July 4th and <B>5th-Billy Baird</B> 
<B>with two men arrived from Mt.  Idaho today at noon having left the 
latter</B> <B>Place Wednesday and arrived at Cottonwood at </B>about 4 P M <B>from 
Mr.</B> <B>Morrill who accompanied Baird we obtained the following account 
of the</B> <B>Scenes of Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday at and near 
Cottonwood </B><B>on Tuesday Whipple sent out </B>Bill <B>Foster and Charley 
Blewett as scouts</B> <B>to learn the whereabouts of the indians in the 
direction of Howards com</B><B>mand at Craigs crossing of Salmon River.<br>
<br>

They proceeded to Lawyers</B> <B>canon along the road and then bore up the 
canon </B>to <B>the south had not</B> <B>proceeded far before they came upon </B>a 
<B>large </B>band <B>of horses driven by</B> <B>one indian-They soon saw three others 
in another </B>direction <B>They put</B> <B>their horses to their speed on retreat 
four being </B>in <B>advance he soon</B> <B>looked back and saw that his comrade 
had become unhorsed & separated</B> <B>from him he sung out to him to take 
to the brush </B>and <B>he would try to</B> <B>catch the horse The horse took down 
the canon [canyon] and he could</B> not overtake him.<br>
<br>
He then rode in haste to Whipples quarters The command was soon ordered to be in readiness to move Meantime Lieut Rains with Foster and Eleven men was sent in advance  to reconnoiter Rains and his men rode over the first rise this side of  Cottonwood and down into the side Ravine where the road crosses before  the ascent of Craigs Mountain and were attacked before Whipple could get to them.<br>
<br>
After he had heard the firing Rains and his whole party was killed including Foster who was shot in the forehead Whipple's command came forward and formed a line of battle on the East side of the Ravine and the Indians on the west all in open ground about 1000 Yards apart only the Ravine between them here they remained menacing each other for about two hours till darkness came upon them and Whipple retired to his camp & the Indians passed over to a point on the Cottonwood trail to Craigs crossing no more was done that night.
The next morning Whipple with his men started this way to meet Col Perry who was expected with a supply train from Lapwai & Kept out his skirmish lines along the route who saw no sign of an Indian save a horse on the hill to the right Suggestion was made to go & see what was there with horse but it was thought that possibly the horse was decoy & the command proceeded-They met Perry with the train near the board house and escorted him safely into camp on Cottonwood Rifle Pits were thrown up on the first bench this side the house & also on the highest point overlooking the prairie to the right of the house and beyond and guns made ready in case of an attack.<br>
<br>
Baird and his two men arrived from Mt.  Idaho after this work was done and were intending to proceed forward to Lewiston that night but at a little after 5 P M Morrill looks up Cottonwood creek and saw four or five mounted Indians soon others were seen in other directions and soon after it was observable that their camp was nearly surrounded by mounted Indians the rifle Pits were soon manned and the indians were endeavoring to approach from every point and firing commenced.<br>
<br>
The sergeant in charge of one of the Pits asked for one of the gatling guns which was soon put in position at the Pits another was planted on the bench this side-Morrill says Perry remained at the house that one indian on the opposite side north of the road called out several times to the others and was interpreted by Chapman as a command for the indians to storm the Pits on the hill beyond the house as they contained but few men several attempts were made by them to approach but the men there Kept them off at a respectable distance.<br>
<br>
One fellow came down across the road and had his horse shot from under him and was himself wounded & broke down the creek out of sight-an Indian soon gave him another horse and he made another attempt to get up to the pits-The indians were much scattered so that they could get no number of them in a body so as to bring them in range of their gatling They saw five together on a point at some distance and brought the piece to bear upon them and made four revolutions with the gun.<br>
<br>
They  unhorsed several of them but could not tell whether any of them were killed. After that the indians Kept at a more respectful distance but Kept up the firing till after 9 P M and no more was seen or heard that night the 4th on the morning of the 5th at about 9 o clock two horsemen were seen coming across the Prairie from the direction of the head of Rocky canon.<br>
<br>
Six indians were soon seen riding towards them full speed from the direction of the indian camp south of Cottonwood the two men who were couriers from Howards command made a detour to the north and reached cottonwood at the mouth of the canon under the rifle pits just in time to escape from the indians in Pursuit-after this the indians moved their camp with about 1500 head of stock across the prairie between Cottonwood and Rocky canon and in the direction of
Clear Water.<br>
<br>
They had crossed the Mt Idaho road-No move was made by Col Perry to intercept them during this time-soon a small squad of men was seen coming from the direction of Mt Idaho and were recognized to be Volunteers as soon as the indians saw them they left a portion of their number to hurry off their stock and about 150 returned to intercept them and prevent their reaching Whipple's command.<br>
<br>
The indians first reached the elevation of ground on the road about a mile beyond Cottonwood near the interception of Elk city trail with the stage road the indians had completely cut off this squad of volunteers from Perrys command at this crisis being seen from Perrys position on the hill at the Rifle Pits he was urged to go with troops to their rescue to which he replied to the effect that it was no use.<br>
<br>
They were gone & would not order the rescue Mr Morrill says the Volunteers say that Captain seeing his position ordered them to charge & break the line of the indians & dash over toward the creek bottom dismount and return the fire and hold their Position Partly under cover of the small hill till the force at Cottonwood could reach them.<br>
<br>
The command was no sooner given than Capt Randall and his sixteen men made the charge and broke through the indian line and reached their position dismounted and returned the fire in the charge Randall was mortally wounded Ben Evans Killed and Three other wounded they fought there for nearly an hour & Kept the indians at bay one of the men fired over sixty shot & several over forty a few held the horses one of the men had his horse shot from under him.<br>
<br>
Charles Chase had his horse shot through the nose as he was holding him after they had gained their position In about a half hour after it was Known that the indians had the Volunteers in a tight place<br>
<br>
Perry gave the order for fifty men to go to their relief and it was quickly obeyed and they were relieved in about one hour after the charge a galling gun was taken with the fifty but was not used & contrary to the expectation of all after the relief had come no pursuit of the indians was ordered but a retreat to camp<br>
and no pursuit had been made since up to the time of Morrills leaving on the night of the 6th.<br>
<br>
The Volunteers say that they Know they Killed several indians & wounded many others as they saw the indians packing off their dead & wounded on the same night McConnell with his volunteers force arrived at Cottonwood from Howards command on the sixth a detachment of 75 men under McConnell was sent as an escort to the Wagon carving the Killed & wounded to Mt Idaho Morrill says that Randall after he was mortally wounded & had got into his position sat up on the ground & fired many shots at the indians the last one not more than
five minutes before he fell back dead.<br>
<br>
Morrill says that not one of these seventeen is reported to have faltered in the least or showed the white feather though so hard pressed by 150 indians nor did one of these seek to run for Cottonwood after they had broken the indian line but they strictly obeyed the order to hold their ground.<br>
<br>
The following are the names of the memorable seventeen who have been highly complimented by their officers for their coolness and courage in their extremity-D.  B. Randall and B. F. Evans Killed A. Bledand D H Houser & Charles Johnson wounded L. P. Willmot J. Searly James Buchanan-Wm Beemer Charles Chase Eph Bunker Frank Vancise C. M Day-Geo Riggings A. D. Bartly H. C. Johnson & F A Feen.<br>
<br>
When Baird and Morrill left the Indians were in full possession of Camas prairie except Mt Idaho Grangeville & the camp at Cottonwood That yesterday several fires were seen m different directions some about three mile creek & appearances were that house, barn or hay stacks were burning no one could tell what the report came from Lapwai that Pete Stagg had come from Lapwai & reported that the Indians crossed the Clear water yesterday at I 1 am near Kamia with their stock.<br>
<br>
Cow Creek news-settlers are being plundered and robbed on Cow creek on the Colville and Walla Walla road a party of from 40 to 60 Volunteers have gone from Walla Walla to the scene of difficulty they are claimed to be Lacama's Steamer expected hourly with Jacksons troops.<br>

OPERATIONS BY THE U.S. ARMY AGAINST THE INDIANS<br>
IN 1857-58<br>
<B>                                                                 </B><br>
(From Virgil Field's History of the Washington National Guard.)<br>
<br>
After the Washington Territorial Volunteers were disbanded at the close of the Indian War of 1855-56 Colonel George Wright left Lieut. Colonel Steptoe in charge of the troops in the Walla Walla Valley.  He occupied Fort Walla Walla about 20 November 1856 and received his supplies by boat from The Dalles on the Columbia River.<br>
<br>
In the meantime J. W. Nesmith, a former Colonel of the Oregon Volunteers, was appointed Superintendent of Indian Affairs for both Oregon and Washington.<br>
<br>
The trouble with the Indians seemed to have ended, especially in the Puget Sound Country.  In 1857, General Newman S. Clark replaced Major General Wool as Department Commander of the Pacific.  United States Troops at that time were distributed as follows:<br>
<br>
Three companies of the 9th Infantry were at Fort Simcoe, under the command of Major R. S. Garnett.<br>
<br>
Three companies were at the Dalles under Colonel Wright;<br>
<br>
Colonel Steptoe's command consisted of one company of the 1st Dragoons, one company of the 3rd Artillery, one company of the 9th Infantry and one company of the 4th Infantry.<br>
<br>
He was augmented in the latter part of 1857 by a company of dragoons from Southern Oregon under the command of Captain A. J. Smith.<br>
<br>
In April of 1858, Lieut. Col. Steptoe reported that he had received a petition from Colville, signed by forty persons, asking for protection from the Indians who had recently murdered two white men and had made several raids on government cattle in the area.<br>
<br>
He recommended an expedition through the country to the Colville mines, intending only to impress upon the Indians that a military power was still stationed in that area.  He received permission and began his march from Fort Walla Walla on 6 May 1858 with about one hundred and thirty dragoons.  He proceeded to the Nez Perce country, being ferried over the Snake River by a friendly Indian Chief.<br>
<br>
Disregarding a report that the Spokanes were opposed to his
entering their country he proceeded northward until he found himself almost surrounded by about six hundred Indians in war paint.  They had chosen their position overlooking a ravine through which the road passed.<br>
<br>
Colonel Steptoe called a halt and attempted to parley with the War Chief of the Spokanes who informed him they had heard he had come to the Spokane country to make war and that they would not let him cross the Spokane River.<br>
<br>
Withdrawing his troops to a distance he attempted to discuss the purpose of his visit without success and the Spokanes still refused to ferry him across the river.  On the 17th of April, he decided to return to Walla Walla and began his march in that direction:  The Spokanes then decided he should not escape and attacked him.<br>
<br>
After considerable fighting and casualties on both sides, on the night of April 18th, with their ammunition running low, the regulars withdrew in the middle of the night, reaching the Snake River on the morning of the 19th and returned to Fort Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
In June of 1858, General Clarke, after consultation with Colonels Wright and Steptoe, determined to make an expedition with a large force in an effort to subdue the hostile Spokanes and Yakimas.  Accordingly he ordered three companies of artillery from San Francisco, one company of the 4th Infantry from Fort Jones, Calif. and another company of the 4th Infantry from Fort Umpqua, Oregon.<br>
<br>
These troops were concentrated at Fort Walla Walla and thoroughly drilled in Indian warfare.  The command was given to Colonel Wright.  At the same time a second expedition was decided upon, which was designated to go against the Yakimas simultaneously.  These troops, numbering about 300 were placed under the command of Major Garnett.  This command was to move from Fort Simcoe on the 15th of August towards Colville, through Yakima country with a view to driving the hostiles towards one center on the Spokane where they would be met by Wright's command.<br>
<br>
On the 7th of August, Captain Keyes with a detachment of dragoons was ordered to the Snake River crossing and erect a Fort.  The point selected was at the mouth of Tucannon River and named Fort Taylor in honor of Captain Taylor who had been killed with Steptoe in his engagement with the Spokanes in April.  Major Garnett's command consisted of Companies C, G and I of the 9th Infantry.<br>
<br>
When Colonel Wright began his march northward to Fort Taylor on 18 August, his command was composed of Companies C, E, H, I and a detachment of Company D, of the 1st Dragoons, Companies A, B, G,
K and M of the 3rd Artillery and Companies B and E of the 9th Infantry, numbering about 800 men.  The Infantry and Artillery were organized as a Rifle Brigade and armed with Sharpe's Long Range rifles using the Minie ball, both of which the Indians were unfamiliar with.<br>
<br>
Before leaving Walla Walla Colonel Wright engaged a company of Nez Perce to serve as scouts and guides.  By the 3lst of August he had reached a point in his march northward within twenty miles of the Spokane River, when the Indians showed themselves along the hills.  Colonel Wright encamped his troops for a much needed rest.<br>
<br>
However, the Indians decided to give the troops no respite and began to mass their warriors on the crest of the hills about two miles distant from Wright's camp.  On 1 September 1858 a heavy fight ensued lasting until the 5th in which the regulars inflicted heavy casualties on the Indians with minor losses to Wright's command.<br>
<br>
As a result the Spokane Chief "Gary", on the 7th through interpreters informed Wright that he desired to talk to him.  Wright met "Gary" and immediately informed him that he was there to make war, not talk peace, but that he was tired of war,he would talk peace but on his own terms.<br>
<br>
He than informed "Gary" that everything must be surrendered - arms, property, women and children and that they must trust in his mercy.  "Gary" then left to inform his people of Wright's edict.  Colonel Wright also informed another Chief by the name of "Polatkin" of the same terms, but detained him for suspected murder.<br>
<br>
On the 8th of September, Colonel Wright began his march towards the Spokane and after going about nine miles discovered that the Indians were driving their stock towards the mountains instead of surrendering.  A skirmish followed in which about 800 horses were captured and herded back to camp where most of them were destroyed.  As a result of being practically dismounted, the Spokanes agreed to a Council which began on 17 September at Wright's camp about 16 miles above Spokane Falls.<br>
<br>
Father Joset and Chief "Vincent" were present at the Council at which "Vincent" acknowledged the crimes of his people, said he regretted it and hoped for forgiveness.  Colonel Wright said such would be granted but only under certain conditions.  He then demanded that the men who struck the blow against Col. Steptoe be immediately surrendered.  Also one Chief with four warriors and their families were to be turned over as hostages.<br>
<br>
After several other stipulations a treaty was prepared which was signed by Wright and by "Polatkin" for the Spokanes.  A similar treaty was entered into with the Yakimas, but Kamiakin did not
come into camp, fearing he would be taken to Walla Walla.  After the conference, "Owhi" of the Yakimas came into camp and was immediately arrested for breaking his agreement of 1856.  Wright then ordered "Owhi" to send for his son "Qualchin" to come into camp under a threat that he would be hanged if he did not comply.<br>
"Qualchin" showed up unexpectedly and was immediately hanged without trial.  "Owhi", attempting to escape on the return march to Walla Walla, was shot by one of Wright's officers and died an hour later.  Upon his arrival at Fort Walla Walla, he was met by the Palouses, who desired peace also.  Colonel Wright refused to deal with them, but instead hanged several of them.<br>
<br>
Several Walla Wallas were also hanged by Colonel Wright as an example to their people. General Clarke continued his policy of keeping the country closed to settlement and it was not until 1859 when General Harney relieved General Clarke as General, commanding the Pacific that it was again opened to settlement.<br>

FOUR LAKES BATTLE.<br>
<br>
"The Steptoe Disaster," <B>The Franklin Flyer.</B> XIX (July, 1986) p. 1-3.<br>
<br>
Steptoe's defeat and humiliating retreat to Walla Walla was looked upon as the "Steptoe disaster" by the regular army.  To avenge the defeat and to restore order among the Spokanes.  Coeur d' Alenes, Yakimas and Palouse tribes, the army dispatched Col-
onel George Wright into the interior of eastern Washington.<br>
<br>
Setting forth from Walla Walla with well over 500 troops a few weeks later, armed with superior long-range rifles, sufficient ammunition and supplies, he retraced Steptoe's route north across the Snake River toward Rosalia, Pine Creek, the Spokane River, and hopefully to Colville.<br>
<br>
Wherever the Indians tried to make a stand he subdued the combined forces of the Spokanes, Palouses and some Pend Oreilles and Coeur d' Alenes at Four Lakes and nearer the Spokane River.  Wright's superior rifles proved to be the decisive equipment, and in both of the two above-mentioned battles the combined forces of the Indians didn't stand a chance.<br>
<br>
Their losses were heavy, while Wright did not lose a man.  On top of that, he rounded up over 800 of their horses, making it impossible for them to roam over the Yakima Valley and other sections of Eastern Washington and wage war.  Wright assigned some of his men to shoot the captured horses.  The Indians were definitely left on foot.<br>

Wright also destroyed their winter caches of food, further convincing them that their resistance was futile.  As the Indians surrendered, he rounded up a quota of ring leaders from each tribe and executed them by hanging, often using an upended wagon tongue on which to mount the noose, in the absence of trees.  Hangman Creek near Spokane was given that name as a result of the hangings.  On maps it is shown as Latah Creek.<br>
<br>
The permanent results of the Steptoe defeat, followed only two months later with Wright's campaign showed the army the true pugnacious altitude of the Indians, and that Chief Kamiakin of the Yakimas was probably the chief agitator.  It delayed by a few months, Lieutenant John Mullen's surveying the route for a wagon road from Fort Walla Walla on the Columbia to Fort Benton on the Missouri River.<br>
<br>
Instead, during Wright's campaign of subduing the Indians of eastern Washington, Mullan was attached to Wright's command, and Mullan proved to be a very valuable negotiator during the treaty making sessions.  The Indians found him to be a fair and strict negotiator.<br>
<br>
Wright's campaign ended Indian uprisings until the 1870's, when the Modocs in southern Oregon, the WalIowas under Chief Joseph in eastern Oregon went to war against the whites.  In the meantime Washington Territory was full up with white settlers, who often cheated the Indians out of their land and their personal property.<br>

FOURLAKES BATTLE<br>
<br>
Edward S. Curtis, "The Fourlakes Battle," <B>The North American Indian.</B> Edward S. Curtis, 1911. Volume VII, p. 54-62.<br>
<br>
Preparations were at once set under way to put an effective force in the field [to avenge the defeat of Colonel Steptoe.]  The garrison at Fort Simcoe in the Yakima country was strengthened by three hundred men, and seven hundred dragoons, infantry, and artillery under Colonel George Wright set out from Fort Walla Walla early in August, 1858.<br>
<br>
On the morning of September first, near Medical lake, southwest of the present city of Spokane, Indian scouts were seen on near-by hills, and skirmishers were thrown out to scatter them. 
When the troops reached the ridge overlooking the lakes, they saw the plain filled with a seething, multitude of mounted and highly excited Indians, dashing hither and thither, shouting, singing, brandishing their weapons.<br>
<br>
While the artillery threw shells into the pines that fringed the lakes, the infantry in open order advanced down the slope, and the Indians, for the first time opposed by soldiers armed with rifles, were forced into the open level country, where the dragoons, charging down between the open ranks of the infantry, quickly put them to flight.<br>
<br>
At least seventeen were killed, but not a soldier was even wounded.  After three days of resting his forces Wright moved northward in the direction in which, his Nez PercE scouts informed him, the enemy had fled.  Some twenty miles below the site of Spokane, Indians were seen gathering on the flanks of the troops.  The column entered a prairie and found that the grass had been fired, and the smoke, driven by a strong wind, made the position difficult.<br>
<br>
However, a charge was made through the blazing grass, and the Indians were driven from cover to cover.  Fighting constantly, the troops marched on fourteen miles and pitched camp a few miles below the falls of the Spokane.  Two days later Wright moved up the river to a point above the falls, and there Garry and others came in to talk about peace.<br>
<br>
They were told that the surrender must be absolute, and that those who had been concemed in the murder of miners must be given up.  Wright detained Polotkin, a chief of the Middle Spokan, and a Palus suspected of complicity in the murder of two white men.  The latter was judged guilty and was hanged, but Polotkin was released a few days later and told to assemble his people for the surrender.<br>
<br>
A few points of information not available in the official reports are fumished in the Indian account.<br>
<br>
"In the summer came news that soldiers under Colonel Wright were already camping on Snake river.  A messenger was sent out among the Sintutuuli and the Sinhomene, and another to the Kalispel, and all of our people and the Coeur d'Alenes gathered at Stlapdtqu<br>
(" swift water-Spokane falls).  Every <B>night</B> war-dances were<br>
held, and every day we practised riding, especially did the Coeur<br>
d'Alenes.<br>
<br>
A few days later, about twenty young men of the Kalispel<br>
joined us, but the Tskaistsihlni took no part in the war.  The next day scouts having reported the soldiers at Medical lake, we moved
in that direction and camped.  Some of us did not wish to fight, but went to look on.  But the others taunted us with being cowards.<br>
<br>
After making camp, the women went out to dig camas, and at the same time a few men on horses rode to the top of the hills and saw the soldiers approaching.  They at once turned back and reported what thev had seen, and at that moment the soldiers appeared on the ridge.<br>
<br>
We mounted and rode to meet them.  We were driven back.  Kamaiakin was in this fight, and some Nez PercEs were present.  We were pursued, and driven to th Spokane river.  That night we danced, and on the fourth moming we started again toward the soldiers.  Scouts had reported that they were advancing toward us, and we met them in a large open prairie.<br>
<br>
We fired the grass, but it did not burn well.  We were driven back into the woods, and retreated up the river.  Above the falls Garry and the other chiefs held a.council with the soldiers, and Polotlein and a guilty Palus were given up.  The chief was released when the soldiers reached St. Mary's Mission near the lake, but the Palus was hanged.<br>
<br>
After the council, the Sinhomene went to the Kalispel country, and the Sintutuflii to the region between Spokane fall- and Coeur d'Alene lake.  The Coeur d'Alenes and the Palus, who also had been in the two battles, fled to the lake, but they were unable to get away with all their horses, and a great many were captured an&-killed by the soldiers."<br>
<br>
After rounding up and killing these eight hundred horses belong-
ing to the Palus chief, Wright continued his march up the Spokane and around to the east of Coeur d'Alene lake, where on September seventeenth he met four hundred of the Coeur d'Alenes in council.<br>
<br>
They surrendered on his terms, agreeing to abstain from further hostilities, to give up those who had begun the attack on Steptoe, retum the goods then captured, and furnish a chief and four men as hostages.  Encircling the lake, Wright returned to the Spokane country, and on September twenty-third, at Hangman creek, met by appointment the Sintutufili and the Sinhomene.<br>
<br>
They surrendered on terms similar to those imposed on the Coeur d'Alenes.  On the following morning Qahlchun the young war-chief of the Pihwinoapam, came into camp and was at once hanged for the murder of certain miners.  On the next day fifteen Palus were taken, and six of them, found guilty, were hanged.<br>
<br>
Thus originated the present name of Hangman creek, which previous to that time had been known by its Indian name as the Lahto, or Latah.  There were no executions for the Spokan, because they had taken no part in the treacherous killing of the miners, but had
fought openly against the troops.<br>
<br>
Wright next marched southward into the Palus country, and received their surrender, hanging one of their number and three refugee Yakima and Wallawalla, and taking a chief and four war-
riors as hostages.  Returning to his post he called a council of the Wallawalla and hanged four of that tribe.<br>
<br>
Altogether Colonel Wright disposed of fifteen Indians on the gallows - an amazing record for a man who only two years before had received some of these same murderers in his camp and allowed them to depart with assurances of his firm friendship.<br>
<br>
Whatever may be thought of the harshness of Wright's methods in this campaign, it must be admitted that they were eminently successful.  If in the march of civilization the Indians were to be dispossessed of their lands, conflict was perhaps unavoidable, and decisive measures were more humane for all concerned than the temporizing policy of the army in the trouble with the Yakima.<br>

THE BATTLE OF FOUR LAKES.<br>
<br>

<br>
General Clarke visited the Columbia in June, when it was arranged that Wrights force, now increased by a large reinforcement from the 3d artillery, should be divided, about 300 men being sent to Fort Simcoe, and the remainder to Walla Walla, whence they would move into the Indian country.<br>
<br>
By August 7th, the main body, composed of abOut 700 men, was ready to take the field, and the advance guard, consisting of one company of dragoons and six companies of artillery, with two twelve-pounder howitzers, and two six-pounder guns, under Major Keyes, started out in much the same direction that Steptoe had taken in May, though aiming to cross the Snake at the confluence of the Tucannon.<br>
<br>
At that point,Fort Taylor, so named in honor of Captain Taylor, who was killed in Steptoe's battle, was built as a supply station.  Here a Catholic priest, who had long lived among these
Indians, was sent to inform them of the terms on which peace would be made with them, but they sent back the insulting reply that the soldiers were always talking of war, but never making it, and they warned Keyes that if his men ever crossed Snake River none of them would return.<br>
<br>
The old chiefs said they were now going to fight till they died; they had plenty of arms, ammunition and provisions; @hen their ammunition gave out they would poison their arrows and fight with them.<br>
<br>
On the 18th Wright came up with the remainder of his command, the pack train, and about thirty friendly Nez Perce warriors, who were placed under command of Lieutenant Mullan.  On the 25th the Snake River was crossed and the whole force marched northward.  Near the close of the fifth day's march small bands of Indians were seen, but none attempted to molest the column.<br>
<br>
They were evidently scouting parties, and their movements indicated that the main body of the hostiles was not very far away.  The advance was continued on the day following, and more scouting parties were seen, with which shots were exchanged by the advance guard.<br>
<br>
The command was now only about twenty miles south of the Spokane River, in a gently rolling country, with plenty of grass and but little timber.  On the morning of September ist, Indians were found to be watching the camp from the tops of the 'surrounding hills, in such numbers that the dragoons and four companies were ordered out to disperse them, while a strong guard was left to defend the 400 mules of the pack train, and the baggage.<br>
<br>
After advancing about a mile, and dislodging the Indians from a high ridge which they ascended, the soldiers found themselves overlooking four lakes, a large one just below them at the foot of the hill, and three smaller ones beyond, all bordered with rocky shores,. which were fringed with stunted pines.  Between these lakes, and beyond them to the northeast, was a wide plain, and beyond were grassy hills, one succeeding another for many miles, while in the distance a range of mountains could be dimly seen.<br>
<br>
"On the plain below us," says Lieutenant Kip, "we saw the enemy.  Every spot seemed alive with the wad warriors we had come so far to meet.  They were in the pines, on the edge of the lakes, in the ravines and gullies, on the opposite hillsides, and swarming on the plains.<br>
<br>
"They seemed to cover the country for some two miles.  Mounter on their fleet, hardy horses, the crowd swayed back and forth, brandishing their weapons, shouting their cries, and keeping up a strong defiance.  Most of them were armed with Hudson's Bay
muskets, while others had bows and arrows, and long lances." All were in their war paint, and gaily bedecked with feathers, and other articles of Indian finery.<br>
<br>
Many of their horses were painted also, and these they rode furiously over the prairie, sometimes as if intend n the troops, and again wheeling ing to make a charge away over the plain as if they had no other object in view than to exhaust the poor animals, before the battle should begin.<br>
<br>
The  artillery  and  infantry  companies  were  deployed   and<br>
advanced down the hill, driving the Indians before them into<br>
the plains, where the dragoons could act against them.  At the same time the howitzer battery, supported by an infantry company, was sent to the right to drive them out from their pines.<br>
<br>
A few shots from the howitzers soon sent them skurrying toward the rear.<br>
<br>
The soliders of the main column moved down the hill in perfect<br>
order, and, when within about six hundred yards of the savages make them acquainted, for the first time minnie bullets and long rangle rifles.<br>
<br>
The reinforcements sent up from California were armed with these weapons, something so superior to the guns heretofore used<br>
by our soldiers, as to make a marked improvement in their efficiency.<br>
<br>
The hostiles were astounded at their great range. As they would come charging forward, in full confidence, to what had formerly been a safe distance first one and then another and then half a dozen or more would fall  from their horses.<br>
<br>
Then some of the riderless horeses would dash wildly about the field, or fall dead or disabled, showing that the new bullets were taking effect on them as well as upon their riders.  The soldiers advanced steadily, firing regularly as they  advanced, and the whole frantic mass of savages soon tumed and ran for the hills.<br>
<br>
This was the time for the dragoons to begin their work.  They had advanced with the rest of the column, using their guns as the other soldiers had used theirs, their horses being led closely behind them.  At the order of Major Grier each dragoon mounted his horse, and charged at a gallop.<br>
<br>
"Taylor's and Gaston's companies were there, burning for revenge,-" says Kip, "and soon they were upon them.  We saw the flash of their sabers as they cut them down.  Lieutenant)Davidson shot one warrior from his saddle as they charged up, and Lieutenant Gregg clove the skull of another."
The Indians were soon driven from the plain, and took refuge in the clumps of timber on the hills.  Here they were for a moment safe from the dragoons, whose horses had suffered too much on the march to be able to stand much hard riding.  The infantry and the howitzers completed the matter, and the savages were soon in full retreat.<br>
<br>
From the crest of the hill, which in the beginning had formed the background of the battlefield, the soldiers saw only a few small parties, which had apparently been left be*hind to see how ritpidly and by how many they would be followed, but a few well-timed shells soon dispersed these.  At the end-of four hours after the troops left their camp, not an Indian could be seen.<br>
<br>
The plain was strewn with their guns, bows, arrows, lances and blankets, and many of their horses, too, had been left behind, which the soldiers lost no time in securing.  But none of the Indians dead or wounded were left behind.  The soldiers were confident, however, that seventeen had been killed, and that many more had been wounded.<br>
<br>
Later it was learned that a brother-in-law of Garry, the educated chief of the Spokanes, had been killed.  Strange to say, not a soldier had been hurt, and not an animal had been lost, although one horse had been slightly wounded.<br>
<br>
The Indians made but one other stand after this battle of the Four Lakes.  After resting three days, during which the friendly Nez Perces scouted the country in all directions, finding no hostiles, but having learned the direction they had taken, Wright again set his column in motion.<br>
<br>
On September 5th, when some fifteen or twenty miles below the falls of the Spokane River, Indians were seen hovering about the flanks of the little army, and their numbers rapidly increased.  As the troops emerged upon a considerable stretch of prairie they found that the enemy had set the grass on fire, land, as the wind was blowing strongly in their faces, they were nearly blinded by the smoke as well as threatened by the flames while struggling with this difficulty, the Indians opened fire on them.<br>
<br>
The pack train was now hurried up, and the soldiers, forming a line about it, prepared to defend it from both fire and the enemy.  As at Four Lakes the Indians conducted themselves as if frantic.  They are always hard riders, and show little mercy for their horses, but now they seemed determined to destroy them.<br>
<br>
Massing on a hill four or five hundred feet high, and sloping toward the troops at an angle of forty-five degrees, they forced their horses down it at a gallop, and then wheeled and raced up it again, yelling the while like so many furies, until their poor
animals were exhausted.<br>
<br>
In all this they of course accomplished nothing except to maim and destroy the poor brutes which might have been of some service to them in the battle.  But exhibitions of this kind seem always to have been an unfailing part of Indian warfare.<br>
<br>
By a well-ordered charge, through the blazing grass, the soldiers easily drove the savages in their front to take refuge in the timber, from which a few shells from the howitzers in turn dislodged them.  Then another charge was made.<br>
<br>
By this process they were driven from cover to cover, from behind trees and rocks, from ravines and depressions in the prairie, for a distance of three or four miles, until they finally emerged upon Spokane plain, where Major Grier and Lieutenant Pender, with the dragoons, swept them in masses before them.<br>
<br>
In this part of the battle a chief was killed, upon the saddle of whose horse was found a pistol used by Lieut@ant Gaston when he was killed in Steptoe's fight.<br>
<br>
So the battle continued, the Indians occasionally attempting a rally, but always being put to flight, either by a charge of the infantry or the dragoons.  A running fight was kept up for a distance of about fourteen miles.  Finally the Indians were utterly routed, and the tired soldiers made their camp on the bank of the Spokane River, about six miles below the falls.<br>
<br>
They had marched twenty five miles during the day, and had been fighting most of the time without water, save what they carried in their canteens.  They now refreshed themselves at the river with a dayps rest, during which they gathered some spoil from the enemy, which had been abandoned during the battle.  But they found none of his killed or wounded.<br>
<br>
They knew however, that some had been killed, for some had been sabered by the dragoons, and others had been,seen to fall before the well-aimed bullets of the foot-soldiers, and the shells from the howitzers.<br>
<br>
On the 7th camp was moved up the river, over the site of the present city of Spokane, to a point a short distance. above the falls.  Here Garry came to see Colonel Wright, to say that he had always been opposed to fighting, but had been unable to control his people, as many of the other chiefs were against him.<br>
<br>
Wright told him he had not come to ask for peace, but to fight.  He had now fought two battles, without losing a man, or an animal, and was prepared to fight still longer if the Indians wished.  "When you are tired of war, you must come with your arms, and your women and children, and lay them at my feet.  I
will then tell you the terms upon which peace will be made.  If you -do not do this, war will be made on you this year, and next year, untit your nations shall be exterminated."<br>
<br>
If Wright had talked to the Indians in this way at the crossing of the Nachess two years earlier, and acted then as he had been acting for a week past, the war would have been ended with very little trouble, Steptoe's gallant men and officers would not have been slaughtered, as they were, and the lives of many Indians, who had since died on the battlefield, or been shot, or were still to be shot or hanged for the crime they had committed, would bave been spared.<br>
<br>
Garnett had  recently shot ten of the Yakimas, whom he had taken prisoners in the country, above Fort Simcoe, and two others had been shot while attempting to escape from the soldiers.  Wright himself was about to begin a series of executions which was not to end until fifteen victims had ascended the gallows.<br>
<br>
One of these came into his camp on the evening of September 7th, with Chief Polotkin of the Spokanes, and several other Indians, to talk of peace.  He was suspected of having recently been present at the murder of two miners on their way to Colvile.  He was detained, and on the following evening was summarily tried and hanged.<br>
<br>
On the 8th Wright moved a few miles further up the river, and during the day captured about 8oo horses belonging to Chief Tilkoax of the Palouses.  All these, together w about ioo others subsequently captured, except a few used to replace some disabled animals belonging to the command, were shot.  Nothing disables the Indians in a hostile country so much as to deprive them of their horses, and these were killed because it was impossible to care for them.<br>
<br>
The soldiers were nearly two whole days in completing their destruction.  Sometimes shooting them singly, and sometimes firing volleys into the corrals by which they were slaughtered by dozens.<br>
<br>
On the 17th Wright held a council with the Coeur d'Alenes, in which he t d them he would make peace only if they would deliver up to him those who had begun the attack on Steptoe, contrary to the orders of their chiefs; also all the property in their possession which they had captured from Steptoe's command, or from other white people; allow all white people to travel through their country unmolested in future, and give him one chief and four warriors, with their families, to be held as hostages for their good behavior.  To these terms the Indians consented.<br>
<br>
In reporting this council to headquarters Wright wrote: "They
know us; they have felt our power, and I have full faith that the Cceur d'Alenes will henceforth be our staunch friends.  "<br>
<br>
On the 23d a council with the Spokanes was held, and in the evening Owhi presented himself at Wright's camp, and was immediately seized and put in irons.  Wright had not seen him since that day in May, two years before, when he visited his camp on the Nachess, and promised to bring in all the Yakimas within a few days, and make a lasting peace.<br>
<br>
He now made sure that the old rascal would not again deceive him, and besides he was particularly anxious tO get possession of his son, Kwalchen, the murderer of Bolon, and thought the surest way to do this was to detain the father, and send word to the son that he would be hanged if he did not forthwith appear.<br>
<br>
The next day, about 9 o'dock, two gaily dressed warriors and a squaw followed by an Indian hunchback, rode boldly into the camp and directly to Colonel Wrighes tent.  All wore a great deal of scarlet, and the squaw was bedecked with two highly ornamental scarfs, passing over the left shoulder and under the right arm, while on the saddle in front she carried a long lance, the handle of which was wound with strings of many colored beads.<br>
<br>
The two braves carried rifles, and one had a highly omamented tomahawk.  This was Kwalchen the much-wanteds, and he and those with him were immediately seized., "He came to me at 9 o'clock<br>
this morning, says Colonel Wright in his report, and at 9:15 he was hung. So perished the murderer of Bolon.<br>
<br>
The command was now in the neighborhood of the Palouse River, and on the 24th the remains of those killed in Steptoe's fight were recovered; those of the soldiers,were buried in the field, while the bones of Captain Taylor and Lieutenant Gaston were conveyed to Fort Walla Walla, where they were buried with military honors- On the evening of that day fifteen members of the Palouse tribe, found in the neighborhood of the camp, were seized, and six of them were promptly hanged.<br>
<br>
A few days later, while the command with its prisoners and hostages was crossing a small stream south of the Snake River, Owhi and Lieutenant Morgna, who were riding together became  separated by a short distance from the command and the old warrior made a dash for liberty. Three shots from the officer's revolver brought him to the ground, and the rifle of a soldier ended his life.<br>
<br>
On September 30th, Colonel Wright could report that the war was closed, as it now really was.  After three years of fruitless maneuvering and proclaiming of peace, peace when there was no
peace, the regulars had  made a vigorous campaign of little more than thirty days' duration, which had made the hostiles feel the power of the government, and compelled them to deliver up the murderers they were keeping in hiding, for the punishment they had deserved.<br>
<br>
All this Stevens had insisted upon from the first as necessary, before a lasting peace would ensue.  It was now done, and at much greater cost to the government, to the settlers, to the army and to the Indians, than would have been necessary but for Wool's mistaken policy.<br>
<br>
Owhi and Kwalchen' Peo-peo-mox-mox, Kanasket, Leschi and Quiemuth, and many of their bravest warriors were dead; Kam-i-ah-kan and his brother Skloom had fled across the border into British Columbia never to return.<br>
<br>
The treaties which Stevens had made, which the Indians had broken, and the ratification of which Wool, and subsequently Clarke, had opposed, were now confirmed, and time has demonstrated that their faults, where they were at fault, were generally in favor of the Indians.<br>

<br>
From the moment of Steptoe's defeat, the officers of the army showed a change of heart regarding the Indians.  The army had viewed the struggles of the militia with professional detachment, but when a disaster happened to regular troops, the high command ordered immediate reprisals, and the cam<B>paign </B>was conducted by Colonel Wright with the utmost vigor and with a <B>summary</B> execution of justice which satisfied the most extreme hopes of the settlers.<br>
<br>
General Clarke moved his headquarters from San Francisco to Vancouver.  Several companies of artillery preceded him.  One of his first acts was to stop the sale of ammunition to the Indians at Colvile by causing the Hudson's Bay Company agents to store a large incoming shipment at Thompson's river.  On his protest, they also turned over horses and mules from Steptoe's expedition which some Coeur d'Alenes had sold to the Company's agent at Colville.
Father Joset was aware that many of the Coeur d'Alenes regretted the attack on Steptoe and that most of them realized that they were in a bad scrape.  He visited the General and offered to mediate in a<br>
last effort to make peace.<br>
<br>
Clarke authorized the priest and his superior, Father N. Congiato, to bear his proposals to the Indians.  The conditions were hard, but no more severe than the situation demanded.  He declared that troops would pass through the Indian country whenever he pleased to send and that the road to Fort Benton would be built.<br>
<br>
All property stolen from the government must be returned and those members of the tribe who fired on the troops in disobedience to the orders of the chiefs must be surrendered for punishment.<br>
<br>
The two priests travelled among the Indians and made a lengthy report to Clarke, in which he confessed that nothing could be done.  Much to their surprise, they found that the repentant spirit of the Indians had changed to a fighting attitude.  They were singing their war chants.  He attributed the change to the influence of Kamiakin, who was still living among them.<br>
<br>
The priests were able to dampen their enthusiasm by describing the irresistible military power of the government.  The songs were stopped and the fighting regalia was laid aside.  The Indians discussed the conditions of peace, but after all saw no way of complying with them.<br>
<br>
The authority of the chiefs was nominal; they could not compel the surrender of the guilty.  Much of the plunder had been sold.  The horses remaining in the Indian camps had passed from hand to hand, and the last buyers would not part with them without payment.  Most of the tribesmen were for peace, but some were for war, and there was no effective tribal government.  "No one can tell what they will do," was Father Congiato's conclusion.<br>
<br>
Letters from three chiefs were enclosed with this report, including a long and rather diplomatic message from Garry.  All spoke of the unwillingness of the Indians to surrender their kinsmen.  "You ask some to be delivered up," wrote Garry.<br>
<br>
"Poor Indians can't come to that." All spoke of the conception of peacemaking among the Indians.  Peace meant burying the hatchet and exchanging gifts.  It was difficult for the savage mind to reconcile reparations and peace.<br>
<br>
General Clarke took measures to retain the friendship of the Nez Perces by concluding a new treaty with them, in which each party agreed not to bear arms against the other, each agreed to aid the
other in the event of war, and provision was made for a council to settle any misunderstanding which might arise.  A company of Nez Perces was organized and placed under the command of Lieutenant Mullan.<br>
<br>
These Indian auxiliaries were equipped with army uniforms, partly to distinguish them from hostiles.  They took great pride in their new clothing and insisted on having the full equipment, even to the glazed cap covers. The bravery of Mullan and his company was mentioned by Colonel Wright <B>in </B>his report on the battle of the Four Lakes.<br>
<br>
The auxiliaries were used as scouts in advance and on the right flank, in opening the battle, and were soon recognized by the hostiles, who were greatly incensed at the sight of the Nez Perces in army uniforms.  Both Wright and Mullan had high praise for the conduct of the auxiliaries, who charged and drove the enemy out of the brush and timber and, later, repulsed <B>and </B>attack on the rear of the column. They acted mostly on their own responsibility and did not wait for orders.<br>
<br>
General Clarke planned simultaneous operations in the Yakima and Spokane regions.  Re-enforcements were sent to Major Robert S. Garnett at Fort Simcoe, and he was ordered to proceed towards the mouth of the Okanogan, about the middle of August and to punish the Indians who had attacked a party of miners.<br>
<br>
Garnett had 300 men, and it was expected that the hostiles who did not fall into his hands would be driven into the Spokane country, where Wright could deal with them.  On the third day of his expedition, a detachment of fifteen men under Lieutenant Jesse K. Allen surrounded an Indian village and captured the entire band.<br>
<br>
Several of the Indians who were believed to have taken part in the raids were tied to trees and shot, three according to Garnett and five according to A.  J. Splawn, who gives their names.  At the moment when the troops rushed the village, Lieutenant Allen was mortally wounded.<br>
<br>
Garnett next sent a hundred men over the mountains to a fishing place on the Wenatchee river and moved his main force to the mouth of the river.  The smaller party surprised and captured a @consid-
erable number of Indians at the fishing place.  Four more of the alleged murderers were recognized and were strung up and shot.  The troops engaged in a trying and eventful hunt for the fishermen who had escaped.<br>
<br>
The chase led over the most difficult part of the mountains, and in its course the fugitives circled back to the fishery.  Finding no provisions there, they set to fishing again, as they had two days start of their pursuers.  When scouts reported the approach of the soldiers, another race began.  Though the Indians had their women and children with them, they took to the highest places,
instead of<br>
going down the river, where Garnett was awaiting them.<br>
<br>
Three days later they made good their escape by felling trees across a narrow chasm constructing a bridge strong enough for their horses to pass over and destroying it after they had crossed.  When the troops arrived, before the Indians were out of sight, there were no more trees to fell, and it was too far around.<br>
<br>
So the chase was abandoned, and the wearied soldiers went down the Wenatchee and rejoined Garnett on the Columbia.  The united com-
mand then marched to the mouth of the Okanogan, where news of Wright's success was received, and they returned to Fort Simcoe.<br>
<br>
The main operations, in the Spokane country,  over the power of the Indians, were distinguished by careful preparation, good leadership and summary punishment of the guilty.  Colonel Wright led 700 men on his punitive expedition, and the only members of the command who lost their lives were two soldiers who died from eating poisonous roots.<br>
<br>
This <B>immunity</B> was due to discipline and superior weapons.  The men were armed with a new rifle of long range, and the Indians could not get near enough to use their Hudson's Bay guns with any effect.  There was much rifle practice and strenuous drilling before the expedition started.<br>
<br>
The first detachment of the expedition started from Fort Walla Walla on August 7. On the second day, they were notified that a band of Indians had driven off thirty-six oxen from Walla Walla, the night before.  Parties of dragoons were sent out in search of the marauders and scoured the country for thirty miles.<br>
<br>
On the following day it was learned that Gregg's dragoons, starting from the fort, had seen the Indians swimming the cattle across the' Snake river.  When the high prairie was reached, it was observed that the hostiles had burned the grass on both sides of the Snake river.<br>
<br>
The crossing at the mouth of the Tucannon was selected as most ad-
vantageous, and Fort Taylor was built, of basalt rock with hexagonal bastions of alder.  Boats were transported from Fort Walla Walla, and a large flat-boat was constructed.  One company of artillery was left to garrison the fort.<br>
<br>
The expedition crossed on August 25 and 26 and advanced in a compact column.  Wright had 570 regulars, of whom 190 were in four troops of dragoons.<br>
<br>
In addition to the regulars, there were thirty Nez Pere's and 100 packers and other employes.  Rations for thirty-eight days, ammunition and other supplies required two pack trains, and there were 800 animals, including the cavalry mounts and 400 mules.  At
a point where the trail divided, the western branch being the direct route to Colville and the eastern one leading to the falls of the Spokane, Wright chose the latter.<br>
<br>
News had been received at Fort Taylor that the hostiles were gathering in great force at some lakes in this vicinity.  Wright's dispatches show that he thought the Indians might allow him to march as far as the Spokane and then burn the entire country behind him.  If they should succeed in burning all the grass, the soldiers would kill their animals for food, shoulder their packs and walk home.<br>
<br>
By August 30, the Indians began to appear on the hills.  They fled at the advance of the dragoons, and the same program was carried out on the following day.  These Indians had been sent to decoy the soldiers towards the main force of the hostiles, who had chosen their own ground for a battle.  In the afternoon, an effort was made to cut off the Nez Perce scouts who were far away on the hills, but they were rescued by the dragoons.<br>
<br>
Just before camp was made, the hostiles attacked the supply train, under the cover of smoke from grass which they had fired.  The grass proved too green to burn freely, and three companies of riflemen, deployed quickly about the train, repulsed the attack.<br>
<br>
The battle of the Four Lakes, at which the Indians received their first great surprise, was fought on September l." At daylight the troops found that the enemy <B>had</B> occupied a high hill two miles northeast or the camp.  Soon after nine o'clock, Wright sent two squadrons of cavalry toward the northern slope of the hill.  As they ascended, some of the men held the horses and the rest deployed on foot as skirmishers.<br>
<br>
The Nez Perce circled the hill toward the east, where the ascent was easier, and were followed by Wright with six companies of foot.  The enemy retreated down the further side but remained at the foot of the hill under cover of trees and bushes in the ravines.  From the top of the hill the four lakes could be seen.  A pine forest at the right was apparently swarming with the enemy, and several hundred mounted warriors rode madly back and forth on the open plain, evidently spoiling for a <B>fight.</B><br>
<br>
"A tyro in the art of war could not have hesitated a moment as to his plan of battle, " says Wright.  He moved his troops within five minutes.  Three companies, with the howitzer, were ordered to drive the Indians from the pine woods, where many of those who had stopped at the foot of the hill were forced to take temporary refuge as the dragoons and the other three companies of foot came down the slope.  The infantry passed out on the plain, ahead of the dragoons, who followed, leading their horses.<br>
<br>
The Indians employed their old tactics, charging up, firing and riding quickly away; but on this occasion they were met by a hail of mini balls long before they could perfect this maneuver.  To
their consternation, the troops kept on advancing, as if on parade.  When it was observed that the enemy were becoming panic stricken, the dragoons mounted and went through the intervals of the infantry at a gal<B>lop</B>, cutting down all the Indians they could reach<br>
<br>
In the meantime, the pine woods had been emptied of the enemy.<br>
The cavalry horses were blown by the time the further hills were reached, and a halt was necessary.  The foot troops again passed the dragoons and kept up the pursuit for two miles over the hills.  At last only one group of Indians could be seen from a high crest, and these disappeared when a shell from the howitzer burst over their heads.  The fight lasted less than four hours.<br>
<br>
The Indian losses were heavy.  They could never be accurately estimated, as the Indians made every effort to carry away their dead.  The same uncertainty as to Kamiakin's presence exists in connection with this battle as in the Steptoe fight.  If he was present, he kept out of sight.  It is known that he was in the subsequent battle of the Spokane Plains and was injured, and he was not seen by the whites on that occasion.<br>
<br>
The Nez Perce scouts followed the enemy eight or ten miles, after the regulars turned back.  Their army uniforms did not deter the Nez Perces from taking scalps, and they celebrated the victory with a war dance around their camp fire until far into the night.<br>
<br>
Wright gave his <B>command</B> a three days rest.  He had gone into the first engagement with horses and men fatigued from the long march.  The horses were too quickly exhausted in the charge on September 1, and no one knew how much work lay ahead.  When the advance was resumed on September 5 and the troops reached a broad prairie with woods on the right,the enemy appeared about three miles away, at the edge of the woods, and set fire to the grass in front of the column and on its right flank.<br>
<br>
The <B>march was </B>hastened, as the flames looked threatening and the Indians were likely to come close enough, under cover of the smoke, to do execution with their old guns.  Wright took the offensive at once, in order to cheat them of any such opportunity, though it was necessary that the skirmishers whom he sent out in force should charge through the burning grass.<br>
<br>
The enemy were driven into the woods, dislodged by howitzer fire, followed by the foot troops and repeatedly pressed back in this way over a distance of four miles.  When an open space was reached, the cavalry rode through the infantry and cleared the field.  The pack train moved forward with the troops.<br>
<br>
In the last stage of the march, the enemy fought in scattered groups.  When a large party was seen, the howitzer was turned loose upon it.  The skirmishers found much variety in their task.  One band of Indians was driven successively from three high table rocks.  
Before the troops reached the Spokane river, the resistance of the enemy had dwindled away, and regular marching order was resumed for a short distance, to the present site of Fort George Wright, where camp was made.  The command marched twenty-five miles on September 5 and fought the Indians over fourteen miles of the way.  One soldier was wounded.  This is the engagement which was named the battle of the Spokane Plains.<br>
<br>
One day of rest was taken at this camp, and the only Indians seen were a few who appeared on the opposite bank of the river and signified a desire to talk.  On September 7, Wright proceeded to a point about two miles above the falls, on the south bank of the river, where Chief Garry crossed over and confessed his inability to restrain this element.  A brother and a brother-in-law of Garry had been killed in the recent fighting.  Wright sent Garry back with a demand of unconditional surrender, accompanied by a threat of extermination.<br>
<br>
Chief Pohlatkin of the Spokanes and nine of his warriors came into camp, and Wright held him and one of his men who was suspected of murder.  This man was tried on the following evening, found guilty and hanged.  Pohlatkin was one of the chiefs who sent letters by Father Congiato to General Clarke.  After marching nine miles, on September 8, a great cloud of dust was seen in the hills up the valley, and three companies of dragoons were sent forward to investigate.<br>
<br>
The Indians were driving off their stock toward the south.  The cavalry dismounted and followed them into the hills, dispersing the Indian herders at Liberty lake and returning with 800 horses. The herd of cattle was too wild to capture, though two efforts were made, on the eighth and ninth, to drive them in.<br>
<br>
The capture of the horses, however, was the final blow to the Indians.  Wright put them in a corral at his next camp, on the Spokane river.  He knew that it would be dangerous to tale them along with the expedition.  The Indians would stampede them, and the troops might lose some of their own animals.  So it was decided to kill the captured horses.<br>
<br>
Wright afterwards learned from the Indians that they were not discouraged by the capture of the horses, as they felt confident they could be recovered; but when they heard the -news of the slaughter, they knew the game was up.  Two companies were detailed to shoot the horses, and the work occupied a good part of two days.<br>
<br>
The heaps of bones long remained to mark the site of "Horse Slaughter Camp." About one hundred of the Indian horses were spared, for the use of the troops, but proved too wild.  Many of them pulled their stakes and ran away, and the rest had to be shot.  The troops destroyed many caches of wheat, vegetables and camas belonging to the Indians.
Before breaking camp, a message was received from Father Joset stating that the Coeur d'Alenes were ready to sue for peace, and two Indians came in, with a white flag, saying that they had been sent by Big Star, a Spokane chief, who wished to surrender, but could not overtake the troops, as he had lost all his horses.  Wright crossed the Spokane and marched to the Coeur d'Alene mission.<br>
<br>
Mullan says it was decided to name the lake where the horses were captured Grier, in honor of Major William N. Grier of the dragoons.<br>
<br>
The settlers who came into the country, after the war named the lake for a man who was living there in 1871, Stephen Liberty, a native of Quebec, who was educated for the priesthood but chose the career of a western man and mail carrier, married an Indian woman at Rathdum and finally moved from the lake to the Coeur d'Alene reservation.<br>
<br>
A council was held on September 17.  Chief Pohlatkin of the Spokanes was released, on his promise to return to his people and prepare for their submission.  Most of the Coeur d'Alenes were in hiding, and it took much urging by Chief Vincent and the priests to bring them in.  When several parties ventured to return to the mission and were unharmed, the others surrendered, turning over the stolen property which they had.<br>
<br>
At the council, the Indians acknowledged their guilt, expressed contrition and agreed to all the demands of the government, which included the surrender of men who started the attack on Steptoe and the giving of hostages.  Wright was afterward criticized  in this instance from his generally relentless treatment of the guilty during the campaign.  His treaty with the Coeur d'Alenes provided for the return of the prisoners as well as the hostages, after-one year.<br>
<br>
Wright commenced to retrace his steps on the day after the council, crossing the Coeur d'Alene and St. Joe rivers and making camp, September 22, on Latah creek, where a council was held with the Spokanes.  The chiefs and about a hundred tribesmen, accompanied by Father Joset, were awaiting the troops.  Even Kamiakin and Tilcosx, a Palouse chief said to have owned the horses killed by Wright, came in, the night before the troops arrived, but changed their minds and departed.<br>
<br>
Wright sent Garry and Big Star to find Kamiakin with instructions to tell him that he would not be harmed if he came to the council, but that if he did not surrender, he would be hunted down and killed.  The messengers located Kamiakin beyond the Spokane, after
an all-night search, but could not persuade him to surrender.  They  said  he  feared he would be taken to Fort Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
The Spokanes were as humble at the Council as the Coeur d'Alenes had been had expressed thankfulness for the terms offered them.  The three chiefs who had written to General Clarke were present, -
Garry, Pohlatkin and Milkapsi, who was a Coeur d'Alene. Milkapsi was instrumental in involving his people in the attack on Steptoe, and his letter to Clarke was most haughty.<br>
<br>
He now asked permission to sign the Coeur d'Alene treaty and was allowed to do so, after a sharp lecture by Wright.  Representatives of the Smaller northern tribes were told that they might consider themselves on the same footing as the Spokanes so long as they conformed to the treaty terms.<br>
<br>
At sunset, on the day of the council, Owhi rode into the camp alone.<br>
<br>
Some of the Indians believed that his purpose was to intercede for his son, Qualchan. Wright reminded him of his breach of faith in the Yakima country, when he promised to bring in his people but ran away instead.<br>
<br>
When questioned, Owhi said that Qualchan was at the mouth of the Spokane.<br>
<br>
Wright put the chief in irons, and sent a message to Qualchan, stating that Owhi would be hanged if the son did not surrender within four days. Wright's report for September 24 says: "Qualchan came to me at 9 o'clock, and at 9:15 a. m. he was hung.<br>
<br>
Wright's account of Qualchan's fate is laconic, and there is little more that can be told with certainty. Qualchan did not come in response to the message, for he was apparently stunned when he learned after his arrival that Owhi was a prisoner.  Qualchan was accompanied by another warrior and a fine looking squaw.<br>
<br>
All three were gaily dressed, and the men were fully armed.  The squaw carried a long lance, wound with beads and ornamented with tippets of beaver.  They rode boldly up to Wright's tent, and Qualchan dismounted.  Captain E. D. Keyes, commanding the artillery battalion, was in front of the tent and called out: "Colonel, we have distinguished visitors here!"<br>
<br>
Wright came out and talked with the chief, whom he recognized.  Qualchan's bearing was defiant until Wright told him that Owhi was present, when he gazed about helplessly and repeated the Colonel's words.  The guard at once disarmed him a-nd led him away.  In the guard tent, he recovered from his stupor, and six men were
required to tie his hands and feet.<br>
<br>
Qualchan's companion and the squaw, who was found to be the chief's wife, a daughter of Pohlatkin, were allowed to depart.  An Indian hunchback, who had previously been seen about the camp, rode in behind Qualchan's party, watched his discomfiture with visible satisfaction and then hastened to the tents of his people, to tell the news.  The <B>officers</B> felt that Qualchan had been betrayed into paying the visit.<br>
<br>
When he was taken out to be hanged, fifteen minutes after his arrival, he cursed Kamiakin, and the most reasonable explanation of his action is that the wily head chief used him as bait, to disclose Wright's real intentions with reference to the principal Yakima miscreants.<br>
<br>
Qualchan showed no stoicism in the face of death, but begged the soldiers to spare him, and Owhi, who was within hearing, disowned him as a <B>son, </B>for this display of cowardice.'<br>
<br>
Owhi did not long survive his notorious son.  About ten days later, just after the troops had left Fort Taylor for Walla Walla, he was shot while making an attempt to escape.  Lieutenant Michael R. Morgan, afterward a General in the Civil War, had charge of the prisoner and was riding alone with him.<br>
<br>
The other guards were on foot and were walking a fallen tree across a stream.  Owhi cut Morgan across the eyes with his whip and dashed away.  Mor<B>gan says </B>that he rode after him, angered at the assault and fearing that his military career would be ended, if his prisoner should escape.  Morgan succeeded in putting three revolver bullets into the chief.<br>
<br>
Owhi was driven into a cul-de-sac, and Sergeant Ball rode up and dispatched him with a shot through the head.<br>
<br>
Before leaving the camp where the Spokane council was held, a detachment under Major Grier was sent to the Steptoe battlefield, to recover the buried howitzers and the remains of the dead.  Survivors of the battle identified the locations, and Lieutenant Mullan gathered the data for his map.<br>
<br>
This party returned to camp on September 25.  Many Palouse Indians came in, that evening, saying that Kamiakin had fled north, and they had seceded from his band.<br>
<br>
Wright arrested fifteen of these Indians, hanged six on the spot and took the others along, in irons.<br>
<br>
Camp was made on the Palouse river, four days later, where nearly
all the members of the Palouse tribe remaining in the country had been gathered by a chief who had taken no part in the war, Slowi-
archy, to whom the tribe now turned for help in getting out of their scrape.  At the council on September 30, Wright told the Palouses that he would not be doing wrong, if he should hang them all.  He refused to make a written treaty with them and threatened with death all who should cross the Snake.<br>
<br>
The whole tribe would be exterminated, if they did not stay in their own country and keep other Indians out.  Wright demanded the surrender of the two Palouses who had murdered miners. <B>Af</B>ter a short consultation among the Indians, one of the murderers came forward.  The other could not be found.  Wright then called for six men who had stolen the army cattle when the expedition was starting from Fort Walla Walla.  They were promptly surrendered.<br>
<br>
While the council proceeded, the murderer and three of the thieves, who were recognized as notorious marauders, were hanged by the guard from a tree several hundred yards distant.  The usual quota of hostages were taken from the Palouse tribe, one chief and four men, with their families.<br>
<br>
After crossing the Snake, Fort Taylor was abandoned and left to the care of Chief Slowiarchy.  The garrison returned with the rest of the troops to Fort Walla Walla on October 5. Here the victims of the Steptoe fight were buried with military honors.<br>
<br>
The bodies of the two officers were later removed to the Cadets' Cemetery at West Point.  The Walla Wallas were called into council on October 9. Wright delivered his customary indictment and asked all who had taken part in recent battles to stand up.  Thirty five rose, and Wright selected for execution four whose reputations were preeminently evil.<br>
<br>
Thus was the last general uprising quelled, and though Wright's methods were harsh, they were regarded as just by the Indians.  The executed men with few exceptions, surrendered or were turned over by their tribesmen, in full expectation of punishment.  The Palouses were plainly annoyed because one of their number was missing when he was wanted.<br>
<br>
Most of the victims accepted their fate calmly.  Lieutenant Mullan's cart, the only vehicle taken on the expedition was used at executions as it was for the purpose of measuring by odometer, the distance travelled.  As soon as the noose was adjusted about their necks, some of the condemned men jumped off the cart.<br>
<br>
After the Wright campaign, General Clarke joined those who had long favored ratification of the treaties made by Stevens.  Stevens and Lane, together in the national capital, as delegates from their Territories, succeeded within a few months in having the deficiency payments for the Indian Service allowed by the Interior Department.  Stevens also worked incessantly to secure ratification of the treaties.  
Though the treaties had not been reached when Congress adjourned on June 9, 1858, the contest was practically won.  The news of Steptoe's defeat reached Washington in June and had the immediate effect of winning over the army.  General William S. Harney was appointed to command a new military department embracing Oregon and Washington, in September, 1858, and his first act, on reaching his post, was to revoke Wool's orders and to throw open the interior to settlement.  The Senate confirmed the treaties on March 8, 1859.<br>
<br>
Colonel Wright served during the Civil War as a Brigadier General of volunteers, in command on the Pacific Coast , and in 1864 returned to Vancouver as commander of the Department of the Columbia.  In 1865, he and his wife were drowned when the steamer Brother Jonathan went down off the mouth of the Columbia.<br>

Wright, Steptoe, and Garnett, headquartered respectively at Forts Dalles, Walla Walla, and Simcoe, continued to represent the United States east of the Cascade Mountains, but a change in the top level of officialdom cleared the air of much of the rancor that bad set military and civil policies on such divergent courses.<br>
<br>
Elected territorial delegate to Congress, Stevens headed for Washington in 1857 to promote the ratification of his treaties and fight for federal assumption of territorial military expenses.  After three years of acrimony between strong-willed General Wool and strong-willed Jefferson Davis, the Secretary finally concluded that a change in the Pacific command was in order.<br>
<br>
In May 1857 Brevet Brigadier General Newman S. Clarke, colonel of the 6th Infantry, relieved Wool as commander of the Department of the Pacific.  Also in <B>1857, </B>Oregon and Washington were combined in a single Indian superintendency, and J. W. Nesmith, late brigadier general of the Oregon Militia, was appointed superintendent.<br>
<br>
Clarke and Nesmith, although disagreeing in some matters, indulged in <B>no </B>name calling and strove to present a common front to the Indians.<br>
<br>

Throughout 1857, however, the Indians remained unsettled.<br>
<br>
Gold-seekers still trekked up the Columbia to the Colville dig-
gings.  From the southeast, where the Mormons of Utah were challenging U.S. authority, came reports of Mormons inciting the Washington tribes to rebel again <B>. </B>Colonel Wright had given the recent hostiles the impression that the past was to be forgotten, yet Nesmith and Clarke were arguing over whether the murderers of Indian Agent Bolon should be demanded for criminal trial.<br>
<br>
The officers at Forts Simcoe and Walla Walla assured them that the 1855 treaties were dead and that the whole matter would be renegotiated; yet, although on this Clarke and Nesmith agreed, a special agent investigating government operations, J. Ross Browne, told them that the treaties would most certainly be ratified and enforced.<br>
<br>
In the Army's view, an attempt either to carry out the treaties or to apprehend Bolon's slayers would set off hostilities with all the tribes east of the Cascades, and, as General Clarke pointed out, suspense is scarcely less likely to prove injurious.<br>
<br>
As the spring of <B>1858 </B>opened, Colonel Steptoe laid plans to lead an expedition eastward on the Oregon Trail to examine more fully the reports that Mormons were tampering with the Indians.  First, however, he felt it desirable to make a quick trip northward.  The Palouses had recently run off some of his stock and also were said to have killed some miners en route to Colville.<br>
<br>
Steptoe wanted to investigate the temper of the Palouses and awe them with a show of force.  He then intended to proceed to the Colville district, where the miners stood in need of a comforting glimpse of blue uniforms.  Finally, the colonel hoped that he might meet some leaders of the Spokane tribe.  These people, residing in three divisions along the Spokane River, had stayed out of the Yakima War.<br>
<br>
They had no unratified treaty to upset them, for their scheduled council with Governor Stevens three years earlier had been canceled by the Yakima uprising.  Now, however, they shared in the general unrest created by the Colville gold rush and the unre-
solved issues of the Yakima War, and Steptoe hoped for a chance to reassure them of the government's friendly intentions.<br>
<br>
On May 6 Steptoe set forth from Fort Walla Walla at the head of three companies of the <B>first </B>Dragoons and 25 infantrymen serving two mountain howitzers-a total of 6 officers and 158 men.  The small ammunition supply-about 40 rounds per man-suggests that no one expected any trouble .<br>
<br>
Crossing the Snake in canoes provided by some friendly Nez Perces, the column proceeded to Palouse River.  On the morning of May <B>16,
</B>shortly after crossing Tohotonimme (now Ingossomen) Creek, Steptoe suddenly found about a thousand painted warriors on his front and flanks.  Upper and Middle Spokanes, Coeur d'Alenes, Palouses, and parties from other northern tribes had gathered to block the march.  During parleys that evening and the next morning, Steptoe sought to convince the chiefs that he came in peace.<br>
<br>
Some argued vehemently for restraint, but the exhortation of others, combined with the war ardor of the young men, prevailed.  The colonel recognized the futility of proceeding with so badly outnumbered a command, and on the morning of the seventeenth he turned back to the south.<br>
<br>
But the warriors continued to hover menacingly around the troops.  They raced over the hills brandishing weapons and uttering war cries.  At 8 A.M. the rear guard came under fire, and within twenty minutes the enemy pressed the column on all sides.  A dragoon company shielded each flank and the rear as the infantry, howitzers, and pack train slowly pushed forward.  Desperate fighting, frequently at close ranges, precariously preserved the formation.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant William Gaston and Captain Oliver H. P. Taylor, commanding on the flanks, dropped with mortal wounds.  At noon, his dragoon companies unnerved by the death of two officers and by the inadequacy of their musketoons, Steptoe deployed on a hilltop and unlimbered the howitzers to hold his assailants at bay.  The Indians kept the position under heavy fire all afternoon and once attempted an assault, which was beaten off.<br>
<br>
As night fell and campfires marked the native lines on the creek below, the officers took stock of the situation.  The day's fighting had exhausted the troops, exacted a toll of six killed and twelve wounded, reduced them to three rounds of ammunition per man, and drained off all hope of averting massacre.  Captain Charles S. Winder and Lieutenant David Gregg urged that the command try to cut its way through the circling lines.<br>
<br>
Steptoe favored a fight to the death on the hilltop, but finally consented to the escape plan.  A reconnaissance party located a route free of Indians.  Abandoning the howitzers and burying the dead, the soldiers quietly shouldered the wounded and stole down the hillside, around the sleeping enemy camp, and across the creek.  Five days later, on May 22, the battered column limped into Fort Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
This time there would be no Volunteers to complicate the military plans.  This time there would be no temporizing with the enemy.  General Clarke arrived at Fort Vancouver in mid June and at once plotted his strategy.  Colonel Wright would thrust northward from Fort Walla Walla, following Steptoe's route through the Palouse range into the Spokane homeland, thence around the lake named for the Coeur d'Alenes who lived on its shores.  
Major Garnett would strike up the Columbia from Fort Simcoe.  "You will attack all hostile Indians, Clarke directed, "with vigor; make their punishment severe, and persevere until the submission of all is complete." The terms of submission were surrender of the Palouses who had murdered the miners in April, surrender of the warriors who had engineered the attack on Steptoe's command in May, and restoration of the howitzers abandoned in Steptoe's dash for safety.<br>
<br>
Moreover, Kamiakin and Qualchin, believed to have figured conspicuously in fomenting the present trouble, were to be cap-
tured or driven away, and no accommodation was to be made with any tribe that sheltered them." Also, Clarke bluntly served notice on the Hudson's Bay Company that all sale of ammunition to Indians at Fort Colville must cease, <B>" </B>and he won the ready consent of the priests at Coeur d'Alene Mission to attempt to persuade their charges of the futility of resistance."<br>
<br>
Garnett drew first blood.  His mission was to hunt out some twenty-five warriors, mostly Palouses, known to have participated in killing the miners on Palouse River in April and who had scattered among the Yakimas west of the Columbia.  With three companies of the 9th Infantry and one of the 4th, Garnett left Fort Simcoe early in August and marched northward.<br>
<br>
On the fifteenth, on Yakima River, Lieutenant Jesse Allen and a fifteen-man detachment fell on a Yakima camp harboring some of the suspects.  In the uncertain dawn light Allen was killed by a shot from one of his own men.  The Yakimas, about seventy in number, surrendered, and the soldiers singled out and executed five of the murderers.  On the upper Wenatchee a week later, Lieutenant George Crook, with the aid of Yakima informants, identified another five of the fugitives and summarily shot them.<br>
<br>
But the chief culprits Kamiakin, Owhi, Qualchin, and Skloom remained at large, and Garnett extended his march nearly to the British line before dropping back down the Columbia.  By <B>now, </B>reported the badly frightened Yakimas, the murderers had all fled east of the Columbia and joined the Spokanes.  Late September found the command back at Fort Simcoe.<br>
<br>
During early August Colonel Wright forwarded troops and supplies from Fort Walla Walla to the crossing of the Snake, where a rock fortification was being built to serve as a supply base.  Here he organized a striking column.  It numbered about six hundred men-a four-company battalion of the <B>First </B>Dragoons under Brevet Major William N. Grier; a four-company battalion of the 3d Artillery, serving as infantry, under Captain Erasmus D. Keyes; a two-company battalion of the 9th Infantry under Captain Frederick T. Dent (whose brother-in law, Captain U. S. Grant, had resigned his commission five years earlier); and an artillery company serving
two 12-pounder mountain howitzers.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant John Mullan, whose road-building project between the Missouri and the Columbia had been interrupted by the outbreak, commanded thirty Nez Perce scouts proudly arrayed in new uniforms.  Trailing a four-hundred-mule pack train, the column set forth from Snake River on August <B>27</B> <B>.</B> Success depended wholly on whether the enemy chose to fight or run.<br>
<br>
Wright knew he could whip them if they fought.  But he also knew that he could march his unwieldy column to parched exhaustion if they ran.  The colonel had good reason to hope that the rout of Steptoe had induced overconfidence.  From Fort Colville came word of Indians exulting over Lieutenant Gaston's sword and Captain Taylor's blood-spotted saddle and boasting that they would kill all soldiers who ventured into their country.<br>
<br>
A priest from Coeur d'Alene Mission had brought Wright the reply to his peace feelers: the Indians were ready for war, and any soldier who crossed Snake River would not live to cross back.  And the Nez Perce scouts reported the Spokanes, Coeur d'Alenes, Palouses, and even some Pend d'Oreilles assembling in large numbers around a cluster of prairie lakes southwest of where the city of Spokane now<br>
stands.  Toward these lakes Wright pointed his column.<br>
<br>
By August 30 the command had reached the northern edges of the Great Spokane Plain and began to descend a broken, pine-dappled landscape to a lower plain spotted with small lakes.  Squads of Indians appeared on the hills, tantalizing the troops but keeping out of rifle range.  Next day their numbers grew.  At dusk an attempt to fire the grass and overwhelm the rear guard fouled on a smooth deployment of Keyes' foot soldiers.  Dawn of September <B>i </B>revealed a large force of warriors atop a high, treeless hill directly in the line of march.  Wright judged that the Indians were ready to fight.<br>
<br>
Leaving two companies and a howitzer to guard the train, Wright pushed forward with Grier's dragoons and Keyes' and Dent's infantry and effortlessly seized the hilltop.  Below, four lakes nestled amid rocky ravines, and beyond a vast plain stretched toward Spokane River.  Around the lakes painted warriors decked in a colorful array of war trappings raced their ponies back and forth, brandishing bows, lances, and short trade muskets and shouting invitations to battle.<br>
<br>
Wright estimated their strength at four to five hundred, and he detected still more waiting in a pine forest edging the base of the hill on the right.  Sending Dent's battalion of the 9th and a howitzer against the timber, the colonel ordered Keyes to advance his battalion of the 3d Artillery down the slope in skirmish formation.  Grier's dragoons followed, leading their horses.  The
object was to prod the enemy out of the hills, gullies, and timber onto the plain, where the dragoons could get at them.<br>
<br>
Keyes' skirmishers fanned out and advanced methodically against the horsemen.  The Indian mass pulsed forward, knots of them making sharp sallies at the blue line, then swiftly <B>pulling back.  At six hundred yards</B> the <B>infantry, armed</B> with the new 1855 rifle, opened fire and began to drop a warrior here and there from his mount.  Under the steady fire of long range rifles, the enemy slowly gave ground, unable to respond at such distances with bows and arrows and Hudson's Bay muskets.<br>
<br>
Dent closed on the timber.  Howitzer rounds burst among the pine branches, and the infantry swept the Indians through the trees and onto the open plain beyond, where Dent aligned on Keyes' right flank.<br>
<br>
With all the contending forces now on the plain, Major Grier mounted his four dragoon companies and shouted, "Charge the rascals!" The horsemen shot through the intervals between the footmen and piled into the Indians.  For a brief few moments the dragoons laid about them with sabers and pistols.  Lieutenant Gregg, veteran of the Steptoe humiliation, split the skull of one with his blade; Lieutenant Henry Davidson shot another with his pistol; and Sergeant Ball, unhorsing an opponent, calmly dismounted and dispatched him.<br>
<br>
The warriors broke under the impact of the assault and raced headlong in retreat.  For a mile Grier pursued, but his worn out horses soon fell behind.  By the time the infantry came up, only a few Indians could be seen on distant elevations, and the howitzer promptly scattered them.<br>
<br>
Here ended the Battle of Four Lakes.  Without a single casualty, either in dead or wounded, the troops had put the hostile alliance to flight and inflicted a loss in killed set first at eighteen to twenty but subsequently, on the basis of Indian admissions, raised to sixty, besides numerous wounded.  This result Wright attributed largely "to the fact that our long-range rifles can reach the enemy where he cannot reach us."<br>

<br>
Following Steptoe's defeat and the receipt of his report, the Department of the Pacific immediately initiated action for a re-
taliatory campaign against the Palouse, Spokane, and Coeur d'Alene Indians.  Colonel George Wright, Ninth Infantry, was appointed commander of the campaign.<br>
<br>
The colonel had graduated from West Point in 1822 and during the succeeding thirty-six years had experienced a very active military career.  He was a battle-tested soldier who had been breveted three times for gallantry or meritorious conduct-once during the Seminole Indian War in Florida and twice during the Mexican War.  His service<br>
also included campaigns against the Indians of the Pacific North-
west.<br>
<br>
Fort Walla Walla was designated as the assembly point for the troops and supplies.  Colonel Wright arrived there early in July to prepare for his expedition.  Before starting northward, be entered into a mutual aid treaty with the Nez Perces in order to have friendly Indians in his rear.  This treaty was signed on August 6, 1858, and was not broken until 1877, when Chief Joseph's band went on the warpath.<br>
<br>
Thirty Nez Perces were recruited to serve with Wright.  They were dressed and equipped as soldiers so they could be distinguished from hostile Indians.<br>
<br>
The Snake River was the most formidable stream to be crossed by the troops en route to the territory of the hostile tribes.  Major Steptoe bad recommended that a crude fort be built on the Snake for the protection of a ferry.  On August 7, while his command was assembling, Colonel Wright sent Captain Erasmus Darwin Keyes, Third Artillery, to select a site and to build a fort.<br>
<br>
With Keyes was a company of dragoons and six companies of dismounted artillery with two twelve pound howitzers and two six pound guns.  Thirty thousand rations were carried by wagons and mules.  First Lieutenant John Mullan, Second Artillery, who was to gain renown as the builder of the wagon road between The Dalles, Oregon Territory, and Fort Benton, Montana Territory, was the engineer officer.<br>
<br>
The first action of this campaign occurred when road-builders near the Snake exchanged shots with Indians scouting their activities.<br>
<br>

The fort was quickly completed at the north of the Tucannon River and named Fort Taylor in honor of the Lieutenant Taylor who had been killed while serving under Major Steptoe.  It was poorly located to withstand modern warfare, but the overlooking bluffs offered no tactical advantage to a foe without artillery or long range weapons.<br>
<br>
The remaining units left Fort Walla Walla on August 15 and arrived at Fort Taylor three days later.  By August 26 the command had crossed the Snake River.  Several days bad been taken to ferry 570 regulars, 30 Nez Perce recruits, 100 civilian employees, 800 animals, and the baggage and subsistence for 38 days.<br>
<br>
Captain (Brevet Major) Francis Octavus Wyse with D Company, Third Artillery, was left behind to man Fort Taylor and to protect the stored supplies and boats.  On the morning of the twenty-seventh the march into hostile territory began.  Not until the third day out of Fort Taylor were any Indians seen, although their presence was attested to by the vast areas of blackened prairie which had been fired to deprive the expedition's livestock of forage.<br>
<br>
When first observed, the Indians were in small bands that kept their distance while moving along the flanks of the column.  Gradually their numbers increased, and by 5 p.m. on that third day they were bold enough to attack the pickets.  The firing was brisk, but when Colonel Wright turned out part of his command the Indians ran away.  The dragoons returned to camp after they had chased the attackers for more than four miles.<br>
<br>
The next day, August 31, the Indians were more numerous, but they did not come near the column.  That evening they struck infantry at the pack train, but the deployed rear guard and the an drove them away.  Camp was made that night at "Four Lakes" a distance of 123 miles from Fort Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
Thus far two brief skirmishes had been fought with no casualties.  The following action of five hours duration is listed in War Department records as the "Battle of Four Lakes."<br>
<br>
On the morning of September 1, Indians were observed gathered on the summit of a high hill about two miles northeast of the campsite.  Colonel Wright marched from camp at 9 A.M- With E and C Companies of the First Dragoons, commanded by Captain (Brevet Major) William Nicholson Grier; A, B, G, and K Companies; Third Artillery, armed with rifle muskets, commanded by Captain Keyes; one howitzer detachment under First Lieutenant James Lyon White, Third Artillery; thirty Nez Perce Indians led by First Lieutenant John Mullan; and B and E Companies, Ninth Infantry, commanded by Captain F. T. Dent.<br>
<br>

The guarding of the camp and supplies was assigned to Captain James Allen Hardie.  The guard force consisted of M Company, Third Artillery, commanded by First Lieutenant Horatio Gates Gibson, assisted by Second Lieutenant George Brown Dandy, one manned howitzer and a guard of fifty-four men under Second Lieutenant Lylan Benton Lyon.<br>
<br>
The hill that was occupied by the Indians is now named Wright's Hill.  It is about 455 feet higher than the almost level terrain surrounding its base.  To the northeast is Riddle Hill, and in the valley between are Granite and Willow Lakes.  Meadow Lake is located at the eastern base of Wright's Hill.  West of Riddle Hill is Silver Lake.  These four lakes are visible from the summit of Wright's Hill and gave the name to the campsite and battle.<br>
<br>
When the troops approached the hill, Colonel Wright ordered Captain Grier to advance with his company of dragoons to the north and around the left base of the hill.  This movement was planned to place the dragoons in position to intercept the Indians as they were driven from the hill.  The colonel and the remainder of the troops marched to the right of the hill to gain a position where the ascent would be easier.<br>
<br>
This maneuver was expected to drive the Indians in the direction of Captain Grier's dragoons.  Captain Keyes deployed his dismounted artillerymen as skirmishers when they were about six hundred yards from the waiting Indians.  Captain Edward Ortho Cresap Ord's M Company dragoons gallantly scrambled up the slope and drove the Indians from the top of the bill.<br>
<br>
They retreated down the north slope and rallied at the base of the hill in the cover of ravines, trees, and brush.<br>
<br>
Colonel Wright reached the hilltop and planned the next phase of his attack.  The Indians at the base of the hill seemed determined to hold their position.  A vast plain to the north was occupied by about five hundred mounted Indians who were riding back and forth waving their weapons, by their actions daring the troops to attack them.<br>
<br>
To the right of the base of the hill in a pine forest were more Indians.  Captain Grier's dragoons had swept around the hill and were in position for the foe to be driven in their direction.  While waiting for action they were being subjected to ineffective long range fire.<br>
<br>
The colonel ordered Captain Keyes to deploy artillery Companies B, under First Lieutenant George Percy Ihrie, and G led by First Lieutenant Dunbar Richard Ransome, along the crest of the hill.<br>
<br>
Captain Dent's infantry battalion, consisting of two companies, E
under Captain C. S. Winder and B commanded by First Lieutenant Hugh Brady Fleming, was directed to move to the right in order to deploy before the pine forest.  First Lieutenant Ogden Tyler's A Company with the howitzer was moved to a lower position where they could direct its fire more effectively.<br>
<br>
The deployment took about five minutes and then the order to advance was given.  The two artillery companies moved steadily down the slope, and the infantry companies moved toward the pine forest.  The Indians at the base of the slope were driven out onto the plain or into the woods at the right, and those in the forest were forced to retreat.<br>
<br>
The artillerymen passed the dragoon company waiting on the extreme left.  Then Captain Grier's dragoons and those of Davidson, who had been following behind the skirmishers, suddenly charged through the gaps between the skirmishers, and struck at the Indians on the plain.  Many warriors were killed or wounded by the  dragoons   when  they cut and slashed with their sabers-<br>
<br>
In a short time the Indians had fled from the plain, but the slashing attack of the dragoons was not halted until their horses became winded after a pursuit of over a mile.<br>
<br>
Revenge was no doubt behind the fury of these dragoons who had served with Gaston and Taylor when those officers had been killed<br>
at To-boto-nim-me Creek.  The skirmishers who bad come off the hill and those who had deployed in front of the pine forest were now in one continuous skirmish line.<br>
<br>
This line passed and continued to advance about six hundred yards<br>
beyond the halted dragoons.  Colonel Wright halted the soldiers when he saw there was no further opposition.  Several shots fired by the howitzer drove the remaining Indians out of sight.<br>
<br>
The battle was won, recall was sounded, and the troops returned to Camp at 2 P.m. Not a single man bad been killed or wounded.  The Indian losses were some eighteen or twenty killed and many wounded.<br>
<br>
One reason for the lack of casualties among the military was that they had longer range weapons than did the Indians, who were armed with Hudson's Bay muskets, bows and arrows, and lances.<br>

THE WRIGHT EXPEDITION.
Mary W. Avery, "The Wright Expedition," <B>History and Government of the State of Washington.</B> Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1961, p. 176.<br>
<br>
The outcome of the Steptoe fiasco was that the regular army of-
ficers changed their attitude toward the Yakima War.  They were convinced that a vigorous attack had to be made, and Colonel Wright left Fort Walla Walla on August 6, 1858, with seven hundred men.<br>
<br>
They marched toward the Spokane country and met a large number of Indians on hills overlooking Four Lakes near present Spokane.  This time, the white troops were not only well supplied with ammu-
nition, but they had a new type of rifle that could shoot farther than the Hudson's Bay guns used by the Indians.  Consequently, after another unsuccessful Indian attack, Chief Garry came to talk to Wright and offer peace.  Wright insisted on unconditional surrender.<br>
<br>
The next day (September 8, 1858), Wright overtook some Indians driving all of the horses away in one huge herd to protect them.  The white soldiers succeeded in driving off the horse herders and rounded up over eight hundred horses in the vicinity of Liberty Lake.  Wright, believing that the Indians would be helpless without their horses, had them all killed except for ones which his own men could use.  He was right in this assumption.<br>
<br>
The various Indian tribes surrendered giving up certain of their men as the murderers or instigators of the fighting.  Wright hanged a number of them in each instance, except the Coeur d'Alenes.  Kamiakin did not surrender.<br>

WRIGHT'S CAMPAIGN.<br>
<br>
Charles Carey, "The campaign of Colonel Wright," <B>General History of Oregon.</B> Portland: Binfords and Mort, 1971, p. 608-620.<br>
<br>
So, while Shaw was preparing to cross the mountains by way of Naches pass, which he did in June, Colonel Wright resumed his march north, in May, in quest of Indians with whom to negotiate, engaging in a few skirmishes with irreconcilables, who set fire to his grass and otherwise committed petty annoyances.<br>
<br>
Finally, obtaining interviews with Kamiakin, Skloom, Owhi, Leschi and a young son of Peu-peu-moxmox, who had succeeded his father in command of the Walla Walla war party, he was completely deceived by a policy which the chiefs now craftily developed, of obtaining
delay by representing that they themselves were in favor of peace, but required time to bring their associates to their way of thinking.  They told Wright that the whole trouble arose from the fact that the treaties of Walla Walla had been forced upon them.<br>
<br>
Wright answered with threats, tempered with expressions of sympathy, but this did not much impress the hostiles.<br>
Nothing definite was accomplished at Wright's conferenm, and the United States forces devoted the remainder of the summer to destroying Indian food caches, to driving the natives from their fishing places, and to collecting non-combatants, who were sent to Oregon to be cared for on reservations.  These, however, were not closely guarded, so that they were free to come and go as they wished, and to act as spies.<br>
<br>
The last of the Oregon volunteers were disbanded, August, 1856, largely for lack of equipment and because of the refusal of the regular army authorities to supply them with arms; but their service in keeping Indians on the move had not been without considerable value.<br>
<br>
So, too, Colonel Shaw's Washington volunteers contributed to the final suppression of the hostiles by fighting two battles on Burnt river and in the Grande Ronde valley in Oregon, which battles, although inconclusive, gave notice to the Indians that they were dealing with a persevering foe.  Notwithstanding the general absence of cooperation that characterized these operations, the cumulative effect of incessant harrying of the savages, by regularsand by Oregon and Washington volunteers, began to be observed late in the summer, when eight or <B>nine </B>hundred wavering Wascos, John Days, Tyghs, and Des Chutes surrendered in small groups and were sent to the Warm Springs reservation.<br>
<br>
Efforts were made independently  by  Stevens,  acting  as  super-<br>
intendant of Indian affairs in Washington territory,  and  by  Col. E.     J. Steptoe, of the regular army, in the autumn of 1856, to make peace by treaty.  Steptoe was sent, in August, to establish a military post in the Walla Walla valley, and he  anticipated  his departure from The Dalles for that locality by issuing a proclamation, August 20, ordering all settlers out of the region the Indian title to which had not been settled by confirmation of treaties with them.<br>
<br>
"No emigrant or other person, except the Hudson's B-ay Company, or persons having ceded rights from the Indians," said Steptoe in the proclamation, "will be permitted to settle or remain in the Indian country, or on  land  not  settled,  or not confirmed by the senate and approved by the president of the United States."<br>
<br>
About this time Governor Stevens, in view of Wright's plans for the occupation of the Walla Walla country, went to Shaw's @p, on
the present site of the city of Walla Walla, for the purpose of mustering -out the volunteers, and also to attempt to hold a council with the tribes.<br>
<br>
The war faction of the Nez Perce's was now thought to be dominating, the attitude of the Cayuses was dubious, and the Walla Wallas a@d. the Yakiinas were openly hostile, so these considerations moved Stevens to request Steptoe to furnish him the protection of two companies of regulars with mountain howitzers.  Steptoe refused, giving as reasons that it was unnecessary, that it would have an unfavorable effect on ions the Indians, and that it would be a violation of the instruct of General Wool.<br>
<br>
The council opened September 11, and lasted a week.  The Indians were surly and uncompromising from the beginning.  On September 13, Stevens addressed to Steptoe another appeal for a guard, "as essential to the security of my emp." Steptoe replied by suggesting that Stevens move, instead.<br>
<br>
The governor reluctantly took the hint, and on the way to Steptoe's camp encountered a band of warriors commanded by Kamiakin, whose design to attack the volunteers, Stevens was informed, had been prevented by this unexpected move.<br>
The council accomplished nothing.<br>
<br>
Stevens submitted his terms, which were unconditional submission to the justice and mercy of the government, and the surrender of all Indian murderers for trial.  Steptoe informed the Indians that he had come to the country to establish a post, not to fight them; and that he "trusted they should get along as friends," and he appointed the following day for another council, which the Indians ignored.<br>
<br>
Instead, they set fire to the prairie around Steptoe's camp, as a further act of defiance, and started in pursuit of Stevens and the volunteers -now returning to The Dalles.  Fighting between Stevens' party and the hostiles of all tribes continued through'the afternoon of September 19, and was renewed, September 20.  Colonel Steptoe, meanwhile, sent detachments of dragoons and artillery to Stevens' aid, and the enemy were repulsed.<br>
<br>
Colonel Shaw, of the volunteers, distinguished himself in the first day's :fighting by leading a charge with twenty-four men, in the course of which he was cut off by a band of 150 warriors, through whom the volunteers cut their way back to the main column.<br>
<br>
The principal casualties of the battle occurred here.  Stevens' loss was one killed, and one gravely, and one slightly wounded.  The Indians losses were officially reported as thirteen killed and wounded.  Attended by the escort from Steptoe's camp, Stevens and the volunteers proceeded out of the region and the governor returned to Olympia.
General Wool did not lose hope of concluding peace by convincing the Indians that the regulars were their friends, and that set-
tlers would be excluded from their country.  Under orders from Wool, Colonel Wright called another council of Cayuse, Walla Wallas and Nez Perce's, at which about forty of the chiefs at-
tended.<br>
<br>
The Indians reiterated their dissatisfaction with the Walla Walla treaties, declared that Lawyer had sold them out and that they wanted peace.  Wright in return promised them immunity for their past conduct and assured them that no white man would be permitted to settle among them without their permission, until the treaties had been acted on or new ones made.<br>
<br>
Wright was so impressed by the results of this council that he reported officially that, in his opinion, the treaties should not be ratified and that peace and quiet could easily be maintained.  Stevens took issue with Wright, who, he said in a letter of protest to the secretary of war, Jefferson Davis, had made unauthorized concessions calculated to embarrass the Indian service in its dealings with the tribes.<br>
<br>
General Wool nevertheless accepted the view of his subordinate, which coincided with his own predilections, and, December 18, 1856, officially declared that peace had been restored.  "Under present arrangements," he wrote, "I don't believe that the war can be renewed by the whites.  The posts are well arranged to preserve peace and to protect the inhabitants from any hostility on the part of the Indians residing in the territories."<br>
<br>
While these events were occurring east of the Cascade mountains, the people around Puget sound had at least two noteworthy conflicts with the western tribes.  These are germane to a history of Oregon, although Washington had meanwhile become a separate territory, because they show them widespread character of the uprising, in the nature of which a considerable victory for the natives in any locality would have greatly improved the morale of the tribes in the entire region.<br>
<br>
January 25, 1856, a considerable force of hostiles, led by Leschi of the Nisquallies- and Owhi of the upper Yakimas, attacked Seat-
tle and poured a hot fire into the town all day, but were repulsed by home guards, aided by men from the sloop-of-war Decatur, then in harbor- The Indians had planned to destroy Seattle and march on Fort Steilacoom, capture the ammunition there and open a war of extermination.<br>
<br>
Early in March, 1856, a band of fifty warriors committed several murders south of Steilacoom, and March 8, a battle was fought by local volunteers and Indians at Connells prairie, which resulted in a victory for the numerically inferior force of whites.  Two
companies of United States infantry and four companies of volunteers were busily employed in patrolling the region, with occasional skirmishes, throughout the summer.<br>
<br>
Indians from British Columbia in this year invaded Washington territory in war canoes, and when they interpreted as a sign<br>
of weakness a missive sent to them under a flag of truce, with a friendly warning to leave the country, they were engaged in battle at Port Gamble by the crew of the United States steamer<br>
Massachusetts, who killed twenty-seven and wounded twenty-one, of a total force of 117.  This put an end to apprehension of invasion by the northern tribes.<br>
<br>
For a short time during this period, Pierce county was placed under martial law by proclamation of Governor Stevens, in con-
@uence of Stevens' disagreement with the civil courts over the treatment of prisoners, squawmen and others, suspected of being spies for the Indians.<br>
<br>
Stevens' militia arrested Judge Edward Lander, as the latter was attempting to open court to hear applications for writs of habeas corpus in deflance of the military proclamation, and the judge retaliated by ordering the governor's arrest for contempt of court.<br>
<br>
The judge was held in nominal custody for a time, and when the war on the sound had ended, he :lined Governor Stevens $50 for contempt of court.  The incident not only provoked an acrimonious politie-al controversy, but illustrated again the want of unity in dealing with the Indian question, which was a feature of the history of this period.<br>
<br>
A semblance of peace existed under the policy now dictated by the regular army, a policy that conceded the Indian title to the country east of the Cascade mountains, ignored the Stevens-Palmer treaties, -and closed the region to settlement.  But pacification was incomplete for various reasons.<br>
<br>
First, the Indians were not able to comprehend the sentiment of benevolence, and saw in every concession an indication of weakness and nothing else.  Second, they were still uneasy in view of their experience with a vacillating government, lest at some time in the future the struggle be renewed.<br>
<br>
Third, they objected that the chiefs, who had signed the treaties of 1855, lacked authority to do so, and that their acts were not approved by the tribes.  Also, the partisans of the murderers of Bolon were constantly apprehensive lest their punishment should be insisted on.  Still further, there dwelt in the northeastern section of the territory a pugnacious tribe that had obstinately refused to permit settlers to obtain a foothold within their boundaries.<br>

These were the Coeur d'Alenes, who had said, even to the early Hudson's Bay traders: "We are willing to barter our furs and peltries for your powder     and  ball,  and   such things as you bring for traffic, but we can     make   the    exchange only at certain points  [named  by  themselves].<br>
<br>
"Within  the  limits of our land you cannot enter; but on the banks, of yonder river, which marks our border, we will meet you at stated times; and there, -and there only, can we trade and traffic."<br>
<br>
A few Jesuit missionaries had succeeded in penetrating the barrier of their distrust.  They had declined to treat with Stevens, 1855, and had then made it known again that they would resist every effort to build roads through the country they called their own.  Closely allied with the Coeur d'Alenes, although somewhat more corrigible, were the Spokanes, who also had rejected Stevens' advances, and who demanded only that they be let alone.<br>
<br>
Their chieftain, Garry, had gone to school in the Red River settlement, where he had acquired a certain knowledge of civiliza-
tion, and he had protected the missionaries, Walker -and Eells, in the troubled months immediately following the massacre at Nftitman mission.  Between the Spokanes and the Coeur d'Alenes, in the north, and the Walla Wallas and the Cayuses farther south, roamed the Palouses.  Of all tribes between the Rocky mountains and the Cascades the Palouses were rated as the most treacherous.<br>
<br>
They werea thieving lot, and were held in low esteem, even by those of their own race.  The way to the recently opened mines of the Colville district lay through the country of the Palouses and the Spokanes, and a misguided traveller strayed occasionally across the boundaries of the Coeur d'Alenes.<br>
<br>
By June, 1857, when Brig.-Gen. Newman S. Clarke, who had succeeded<br>
Major-General Wool in command of the military department of the Pacific, visited Oregon, the nominal peace which Wright had made and Wool had proclaimed was at the point of breaking.  The Palouses, misinterpreting the self restraint of the military, grew bolder, and on one occasion even drove off a band of horses from the military post in the Walla Walla valley, at Wright's very door.<br>
<br>
Two prospectors on the way to the Colville mines were robbed and murdered, and other miners disappeared.  People living near Colville reported the nearby Indians hostile, and petitioned the military forces for protection.<br>
<br>
General Clarke arrived in Oregon holding some of the views of his predecessor, Wool, and began by -attempting to <B>carry </B>out Wool's
policies.<br>
<br>
Stevens was elected delegate to congress from Washington territory, July, 1857, and Joel Palmer was sue-ceeded as superintendent of Indian affairs for Oregon by J. W. Nesmith, whose authority was now extended over the Indians of both terri-
tories.  Clarke held a conference with Nesmith, at The Dalles, at which the causes of the now apparent revival of unrest among the eastern Indians were discussed.<br>
<br>
Nesmith agreed with Clarke that uneasiness for the future disposition of Bolon's murderers and fear that the Walla Walla treaties would be enforced, were two prime sources of irritation.  He expressed the view that it would be impolitic to confirm the treaties, and said that he would use his influence to prevent their ratification.<br>
<br>
Colonel Steptoe, in command of Fort Walla Walla, reported, October, 1857, that in his opinion any attempt to enforce the treaties would be followed by immediate hostilities with most of the tribes.  Steptoe, in a spirit of friendship for the Indians, recommended that another treaty commission be appointed and a new treaty made, "thoroughly digested and accepted by both sides."<br>
<br>
Clarke determined, inasmuch as the Indians had been led to believe, however mistakenly, that the past would be forgiven, that he would not destroy the future influence of the government by an appearance of bad faith, and he instructed his officers so to inform them.  Clarke also directed a continuance of the policy of Wool, and issued a formal order forbidding settlement east of the Sahnon river, in Washington, and the Deschutes river, in Oregon.  In compliance with the order, military force was used to expel settlers who persisted in comiiig to the Walla Walla valley.<br>
<br>
Reports of disaffection among the tribes, together with rumors, which now reached Clarke through official channels, to the effect that Mormons, in Utah, were supplying Indians with ammunition and fomenting disorder among them, caused Clarke, early in January, 1858, to direct Steptoe to place his command in a state of full efficiency, at the earliest possible date, for the purpose of go-
ing on an expedition to obtain full information in relation to the eastern tribes.<br>
<br>
Steptoe reported, January 29, 1858, that he doubted that the Indians in the immediate vicinity of Walla Walla were disposed to involve themselves in war, but that he believed that the Palouse, Yakima and Spokane tribes awaited only slight encouragement to revive hostilities.<br>
<br>
Only a day later Maj.  R. S. Garnett, commanding the military post at Fort Simeoe, sent word that he had received word for the second time from Skloom, brother of Kamiakin, that Mormon emissaries had
been among the Yakimas, seeking to incite them to hostility toward the United States.<br>
<br>
As a result of this condition, and in obedience to the order of General Clarke, Colonel Steptoe left Fort Walla Walla, May 6, 1858, with three companies of dragoons and a detachment . of mounted infantry, 158 men in all.<br>
<br>
Two of the dragoon companies were armed with the musketoon, a short gun of musket pattern, but incapable of efficient execution at any great range.  At the last moment of loading the pack train, it was found that the baggage exceeded the carrying capacity of the train, and a large portion of the ammunition was left behind.  Steptoe's mission being peaceful, rather than punitive, this omission did not then attract attention.<br>
<br>
The route of Steptoe's march also was fateful.  Leaving Walla Walla, he travelled northeast to the Snake river, which he reached at the mouth of Alpowa creek, where the friendly Nez Perce's chief, Timothy, had a fleet of large canoes likely to be useful in making the crossing, and also where, he had been informed, a large party of Palouses were gathering.<br>
<br>
He then followed a succession of Indian trails which led him close to the present Washington-Idaho boundary line, and so doing, he approached very near to the country of the Coeur d'Alenes; whereas, a direct route from Walla Walla to Colville by the then travelled trails would have led him thirty miles or more to the westward.<br>
<br>
On reaching the Palouse river and being about to attempt a crossing, he was informed that the Spokanes and Coeur d'Alenes would oppose his entrance to their country.  He continued his march, however, meeting occasional parties of Indians, probably spies, who professed friendship and had ample opportunity to obtain information concerning the strength of his command.<br>
<br>
On Sunday, May 15, 1858, while the column was encamped on Pine creek, a tributary of the Palouse, a band of mounted warriors variously estimated at from 1000 to 1500, Spokanes, Yakimas, Palouses and Coeur d'Alenes, appeared suddenly from the hills.  Spokanes and Coeur d'Alenes, acting as spokesmen, told Steptoe they had been inforzned that he had come to annihilate them, and said that if this were so they were ready to fight.<br>
<br>
In reply to Steptoe's explanation that he was merely on his way to Colville on a friendly mission, the Indians retorted that he had not come by the most direct route to Colville, and pointed to his howitzers as confirmation of their belief in his warlike purpose.  Appreciating the fact that he was outnumbered seven to one, and that the Indians carried rifles of longer range than the muske-
toons of his own dragoons, Steptoe resolved to retrace his steps.
The Indians, who had not forgotten their early religious training, told Steptoe that they would not fight on Sunday; but they opened the attack as soon as the retrograde movement was begun, on the morning of May 18, and surrounded the troops, who took refuge on a hill near the present site of Rosalia, Washington, where the battle continued into the night.<br>
<br>
Reduced to three rounds of -ammunition for each man, Steptoe then abandoned his howitzers and pack train, and retreated under cover of darkness by a forced march of eighty miles to Snake river crossing.<br>
<br>
He had suffered the loss of a captain and a lieutenant and six enlisted men, killed, and eleven wounded, and left his dead hastily buried in shallow graves on the battlefield.  The prestige of the army was impaired and the confidence of the native tribes was strengthened by this military failure.<br>
<br>
Steptoe's defeat, however, hastened the conclusion of hostilities in that region by putting the whole army on its mettle, and by convincing General Clarke that hostiles could be brought to terms only by punishing them.<br>
<br>
The expedition which Clarke now organized omitted no detail of equipment that would make fulfillment of its purpose certain.  He obtained, as reinforcements, three companies of artillery from San Francisco, one company of the Fourth infantry from Fort Jones, and another from the Umpqua district, and he concentrated nearly 2000 men of all arms at Fort Walla Walla, where they were diligently drilled in the tactics of Indian warfare.<br>
<br>
Command of the expedition was committed to Colonel Wright, who sent three companies under Major Garnett to the Yakima country, to drive the Indians east toward the main column, which meanwhile proceeded north.<br>
<br>
Wright took the precaution before starting out, however, to make a formal treaty of friendship with the Nez Perce's, with a view to protecting his rear, and this curious compact was signed August 6, 1858, by Wright for the government of the United States and by 38 chiefs and sub-chiefs of the Nez Perce's.<br>
<br>
It was subsequently countersigned by General Clarke, at Fort Vancouver, but it never received the consideration of the senate.  However, it was faithfully kept by the tribe, until 1877, when its first article was violated by Chief Joseph, who was pursued by Gen. 0. 0. Howard across the present states of Idaho and western Montana, and who finally surrendered to Gen.  Nelson A. Miles.<br>
<br>
The Nez Perce's treaty was the cause of much agitation in Oregon,
on the ground that Wright had promised more than he could perform, that the Indians did not understand that Wright had no authority to make treaties, and that failure to supply the Nez Perce's with arms, as the treaty provided, would result in dissatisfaction and in alienation of the friendship of the tribe.<br>
<br>
Wright maintained, however, that the treaty was justified, as an act of military necessity, and that by placing hors de combat some 1700 Hudson's Bay muskets alone, it accomplished the purpose for which it was intended.<br>
<br>
Wright's division consisted of four companies of dragoons, five companies of artillery, two companies of infantry and a company of Nez Perce's allies, in United States army uniforms.  There were long range rifles for the entire force and ammunition for a pro-
tracted campaign.  But, even this formidable army found the In-
dians insolent and willing to take the initiative.<br>
<br>
The two culminating battles of the campaign were fought at Four Lakes, September 1, where the brother and brother-in-law of Chief Garry were killed, and on the Spokane plains, where Kamiakin was wounded by a tree top, blowm off by a cannon and striking him on the head.  Wright had no losses, either in killed or wounded, and on the entire campaign reported as casualties only two, who died from nonmilitary causes.  The losses of the Indians were concealed by them.<br>
<br>
In addition to their dead and wounded, however, they suffered heavily in loss of property.  The troops captured several hundred head of cattle and -a larger number of horses, the surplus of which, after remounting the command, were shot.  The entire Spokane nation was practically unhorsed in two days.<br>
<br>
The Indians were taken wholly by surprise by Wright's well trained forces, and particularly by the new long range rifles, now used for the first time, while the artillery overwhelmed them and gave them no opportunity to employ their usual tactics of sniping the troops from every convenient cover.  But a natural phenomenon at this time gave a peculiar and picturesque turn to the event.<br>
<br>
Donati's comet became visible for the first time as the army under Wright drew near.  "Night after night," wrote Lieut.  Lawrence Kip, who accompanied the expedition as artillery adjutant, "it had been streaming above us in all its glory.  Strange as it may seem, it has exerted a powerful influence with the Indians in our behalf.<br>
<br>
Appearing just as we entered the country, it seemed to them like some huge besom to sweep them from the earth.  The effect was probably much increased by the fact that it disappeared about the time our campaign ended, and the treaties were formed.  They must have imagined that it had been sent home to the Great Father in
Washington, to be put away until required the next time."<br>
<br>
Indians now approached Wright as suppliants.  Garry pleaded that he had been opposed to fighting, but that his young men and many of the other chiefs had overruled him.  Wright's attitude was that of conqueror.  His reply to Garry embodied his policy in dealing with most of the other tribes.<br>
<br>
Wright said: "I have met you in two battles; you have been badly whipped; you have had several chiefs and many warriors killed or wounded; I have not lost a man or animal.  I have a large force, and you, Spokanes, Coeur d'Alenes, Palouses and Pend d'Oreilles may unite, and 1 can defeat you as badly as before.<br>
<br>
"I did not come to the country to make peace; I came here to fight.  Now, when you are tired of war and ask for peace you must come to me with your arms, with your women and children, and everything you have, and lay them at my feet.  You must trust to my mercy.  If you do this, I shall then give you the terms upon which I will give you peace.<br>
<br>
"If you do not do this, war will be made on you this year and the next, and until your nations shall be exterminated." Of the now terrified Coeur d'Alenes, Wright demanded that they surrei-ider for execution the man who struck the first blow at Colonel Step-
toe, give one chief and four warriors -and their families to be held as hostages, and restore all property taken from Steptoe's command.<br>
<br>
Owhi, brother-in-law of Kamiakin, entered camp seeking peace and was detained as hostage for the appearance of his son, Qualchan, the murderer of Indian Agent Bolon.<br>
<br>
Qual-chan came unsuspectingly into camp without having met the messenger sent after him.  He was recognized, seized and bound.  Colonel Wright's official report reads: "Qual-chan came to me at nine o'clock this morning, and at 9 1/4 a. m. he was hung." Owhi was shot a few days later while trying to escape.  Seven Palouse Indians, who sued for peace, were tried by summary court, convicted of various atrocities and six were hanged.<br>
<br>
Other Palouses followed, and were told by Wright that he would make no treaty with them until their good faith had been tested by probation.  Four other notorious marauders were surrendered by their fellows, and were summarily executed.<br>
<br>
Returning to the country of the Walla Wallas, Wright called a council, at which he commanded all who had taken part in the recent battles to stand up.  Thirty-five stood up, of whom Wright selected four at random, who were hanged on the spot.  Sixte@n Indians were thus executed by Wright's orders.  Major Garnett in the same period captured and executed eight Indians, all of whom were shot.
The war in the north was now over.  The hostile chieftains were either dead or in flight.  In Puget sound region, Leschi, of the Nisquallies, had been betrayed for a reward, arrested and hanged by the civil authorities of Washington territory, February 19, 1858, after a memorable legal struggle to save his life, in which he was befriended by influential citizens who believed that he had been made a scapegoat, and that he had not signed the Medicine creek treaty, or, if he had done so had but imperfectly understood its terms.<br>
<br>
Kamiakin, instigator of the effort to unite <B>all</B> the tribes in a war of extermination of the whites, and Skloom, of the Yakimas, found safety in prudent flight.<br>
<br>
The treaties made by Wright were treaties of friendship only, and left the land issue precisely as it was before.<br>
<br>
General Clarke, however, now withdrew his opposition to the Walla Walla treaties, and they, and also Palmer's treaty with the Indians of central Oregon, were ratified by the senate, March 8, 1859.  The eastern country was formally thrown open to settlement, October 31, 1858, by order of Gen.  William S. Harney, who became commander of the military department of Oregon upon the creation of the department, September 13, 1858.<br>

BATTLE OF FOUR LAKES.<br>
<br>
Erasmus Darwin Keyes "The Battle of Four Lakes," <B>Fifty Years' observation of men and events.</B> New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1884. p. 265-270.<br>
<br>
The Indian war in the Puget Sound district being at an end, I was ordered by Colonel Casey in the month of October, 1856, to return to my post, the delightful Presidio of San Francisco.  The year succeeding was too barren of incident to require especial notice...<br>
<br>
In the month of May, 1858, I was a member of a court martial convened at Fort Miller, on the San Joaquin River.  Captain E. 0. C. Ord was the commanding officer, and his family were with him at his post.  They entertained the members of the court-martial bountifully, and the loving harmony of that household was delightful to observe.  Ord was cheerful and domestic in his
habits, and his accomplished wife told me that her life had been joyous.<br>
<br>
Little did she foresee what the  future  had  in store for her gallant husband, or what sorrow for herself.<br>
<br>
General Ord, although a Virginian by birth, illustrated his name in the Northern armies during our civil war.  If we except General Crook, for a shorter time he probably did as much constant hard service as any other officer in the army.  After forty years of active duty he was retired, went to Mexico where he exercised important civil functions, and married one of his daughters to a general of that country.<br>
<br>
Being still in vigorous health and prosperous, he left Vera Cruz in the month of August 1883, for a trip to Cuba, and while on board the ship was taken down with yellow fever and died.....<br>
<br>
It was on the very site of Fort Miller, in the same month of May seven years before, that I saw assembled about 1,200 aborigines, natives of the adjacent plains and mountains, many of whom had never seen a white man till they came to treat with us.<br>
<br>
Especially was I struck with the activity of the young Indians of both sexes while they amused themselves with football and other rough sports.  As all those Indians had been assigned to a reservation of which Fort Miller was a central point I inquired for several individuals whom I remembered.<br>
<br>
I was told that they were nearly all dead, victims to drunkenness, and that of the whole number I then saw in such full activity not above fifty remained. I took pains to see the wretched survivors, and was shocked with the spectacle of degradation and self-abandonment they presented....<br>
<br>
Towards the end of May, 1858, news was received in San Francisco of Colonel Steptoe's disaster at the north of Snake River, Washington Territory.  The Colonel had been detached from Walla Walla with <B>i </B>59 men to capture cattle thieves, and while on his march towards Fort Colville he was attacked by a thousand or more Spokans, Pelouses, Cceur d'Alenes, and Yackirnas, and obliged to retreat.<br>
<br>
His small band defended themselves from morning till night, and Captain H.  P. Taylor, Lieutenant William Gaston, and several of the rank and file were killed.  The balance had the good fortune to get away in the darkness, and at ten o'clock on the morning of the 17th,<br>
after a ride of seventy-five miles they  reached a place of safety<br>
at the south of the river.<br>
<br>
Considering the fatigue of a whole day's fighting with the Indians, the flight of 75 miles during the succeeding night,
without the loss of a man that started was an evidence of endurance that has few examples in history.<br>
<br>
General N. S. Clark, the commander of the Department of the Pacific, lost no time in sending northward all the at the Dalles available troops in California.  I arrived with two companies on the 2,st of June, and on the 24th was joined by two other companies, the four being under my orders and all encamped together.  From the 25th of June till the 7th of July I lost- no time in preparing my force to fight the Indians.<br>
<br>
I had numerous targets the height of a man set up at various distances on even and uneven ground, and for several hours every day, Sundays not excepted, I caused the soldiers, individually and collectively, to fire at those targets.  In every case they were required to estimate the distance, which was afterwards told, and required to adjust their aim accordingly.<br>
<br>
The effect of that drilling was wonderful and I estimated it as giving a quadruple value to my numbers.  I told the men that our operations <B>would </B>probably be in an open prairie country, and that their muskets being of a longer range than those sold by the Hudson Bay <B>Company </B>to the enemy, they could aim at an Indian as securely as at a plank.<br>
<br>
The march of 177 miles from the Dalles to Walla Walla was fatiguing, as the weather was excessively hot, and in places the ground was so difficult that it occupied twelve days.  Colonel George H. Wright of the Ninth Infantry was assigned to the command of the expedition, and it required time to organize and send forward his little army to the point on the south side of the Snake River which he selected to cross to the country of the hostiles.<br>
<br>
It was at the mouth of a little stream called the Tucanon, and in obedience to orders, as soon as I arrived there in the advance I caused a small fort to be constructed, which was left in charge of Brevet Major F. 0. Wyse, with one company of artillery.<br>
<br>
I had never before served under the orders of Colonel Wright, but from a slight personal acquaintance with him and many favorable reports I had conceived great respect for his military capacity.  I was glad, therefore, to be his lieutenant, and to receive from him the command of a battalion of six companies of artillery serving as infantry.<br>
<br>
Major William N. Grier commanded the dragoons, about 200 in number; Lieutenant White, the mountain howitzer company; Captain Winder, a company of riflemen, and Lieutenant Dent, brother-in law to General Grant, a company of infantry.  Lieutenant John Mullan had under his orders 33 friendly Nez Perces Indians, who were to act as guides, scouts, and interpreters.<br>

Mullan was also the topographical engineer of the expedition, and he was well acquainted with the country we were to operate <B>in. </B>Captain R. W. Kirkham was quartermaster and commissary.  Surgeon J. F. Hammond, brother to Senator Hammond of South Carolina and author of the expression was the chief  of the medical staff. Lieutenant P. A. Owen acting adjutant-general, and Lieutenant L. Kipp, Third Artillery, adjutant of my battalion.<br>
<br>
All the detachments, numbering about 900 men, having arrived, we crossed the river on the 25th and 26th days of August-the men, baggage, provisions for 40 days, and ammunition in boats, of which there was a great scarcity, and about 700 mules and horses swimming the rapid stream, with Indians alongside the leaders to keep them headed towards the opposite shore.<br>
<br>
That was a singular and amusing sight.  It was a stupendous task to pack 400 mules the next morning, but Kirkham's arrangements were so effective that it was accomplished at five o'clock, at which hour we left the river to find the enemy.<br>
<br>
Numerous reports and stories had reached us that the Indians were exulting in their victory over Steptoe, and they were confident that not a man of us who crossed the Snake River would return alive.  On the 30th of August they first showed themselves in small scouting parties, and the next day they appeared in considerable numbers, skirting our line of march for several hours, but keeping out of gunshot.<br>
<br>
They were apparently luring us on to a favorable spot they had previously selected to attack and destroy us.<br>
<br>
Towards the end of our march, on the 31st of August, Colonel Wright and his escort having proceeded me about half a mile and encamped, the Indians set fire to the grass, and under cover of the smoke, approached and fired upon the rear guard.  We had kept the pack train well closed, and upon hearing the first shots I ordered the three companies of Winder, Ihrie, and Hardie and Dent to deploy at double-quick time as skirmishers across the rear and along the two sides of the column, while the front was well protected by Captain Ord.<br>
<br>
Within five minutes from the first command the whole train and everything else was enclosed in a rectangle of armed men, and the attack repulsed.  The promptness of the manoeuvre was admirable, and showed the benefit of discipline and previous instruction.<br>
<br>
The battle of the Four Lakes was fought on the 1st of September, 1858- It was not Colonel Wright's intention to attack that day, but to rest the men and animals in the beautiful camp established the evening before.  His determination was changed, however, by the appearance in the morning of a considerable body of the enemy
on a neighboring hill, and the report of our Nez Perces'scouts of many more beyond.<br>
<br>
The Colonel having arranged his plan, the whole force, with the exception of a guard to protect the camp and pack-train, marched about a mile to the foot of the eminence, from whence Gregg's dra-
goons, Ord's company, and Mullan with his scouts were ordered up to dislodge the hostiles, which was quickly done.  Then our commander ascended with his staff, followed by me and my battalion and the artillery.<br>
<br>
When we reached the summit we halted a few minutes to view an animated spectacle.  We could see the four lakes and the gullies and patches of woods bordering the water, and a vast plain stretching away to the front and left.  The natural scenery was interesting, but its effect was wonderfully heightened by the thousand or more savage warriors who were riding furiously hither and thither over the plain or issuing from the woods and valleys.<br>
<br>
The barbarous host was armed with Hudson Bay muskets, spears, bows and arrows, and apparently they were subject to no order or command.  The brilliant morning sun, which illuminated the purest aid of the<br>
continent, enabled me to distinguish through my field-glass the individual savages,  their horses, their trappings, and equipments.<br>
<br>
Both men and animals were smeared and striped with gaudy pigments and bedecked with the feathers and plumes of birds of prey.  The skins of bears, wolves, and the buffalo served generally for saddles, and the whole display was enhanced by the frantic gestures and yells of the warriors, who brandished their weapons in defiance.<br>
<br>
Colonel Wright indicated to me my point of attack, and I descended to the plain, where I ordered several companies to deploy as skirmishers and to advance firing.  Our first discharge seemed to surprise the Indians, and those nearest scampered off, but some would turn back and fire upon us.<br>
<br>
After clearing the broken ground, we made way for Grier to pass on the right.  He ordered his men to charge, and they started off handsomely but his horses had been marching without a day's rest for nearly a month, and they scarcely gained on the hardy Indian ponies, which were all fresh.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Gregg, who was a splendid sabreur, overtook one of the flying rascals, and with a blow of his blade split his skull in two.  I pursued and fought the enemy nearly three hours, and upon reaching a hill over which the savages had disappeared I was obliged to halt the advance to allow a allow a considerable  number of the soldiers who were fatigued and overheated to come
up.<br>
<br>
On reaching the crest of the hill I could see not more than ten or fifteen Indians, the main body having fled to the woods beyond.  While I was halted the recall was sounded, and I returned to camp after an absence of about four hours.<br>
<br>
The plain was scattered with Indian muskets, bows, arrows, blankets, skins and trinkets which had been abandoned by the warriors <B>in</B> their flight, but they had carried off their killed <B>and</B> wounded, according to custom.  We could not ascertain from observation during the fight the exact loss of the enemy, but we were certain that a considerable number were slain, and from subsequent enquiry and information, we concluded that not less than sixty Indians were killed and wounded.<br>
<br>
Of my battalion <B>not </B>a man was hit.  As I had anticipated, our long-ranged arms, discipline, and careful previous instruction secured our safety, and enabled us to thin the number of the savages until their panic-flight took them beyond our reach.  The importance of the victory of the Four Lakes was not the less for having been bloodless for us, and it stimulated the soldiers greatly.<br>
<br>
The men and animals needed rest; we remained in camp at the Four Lakes until six o'clock on the morning of September 5, when we resumed our advance.  At first we saw no Indians, but at the end of an hour they began to show themselves, and to move along parallel with our line of march over the rough ground, beyond which was the great Spokan Plain.<br>

Gary Fuller Reese, "William Winlock Miller," <B>It Happened on PUget Sound.</B> p. 82-83.<br>
<br>
William Winlock Miller served the citizens of Olympia, Washington, as their mayor on two occasions and was prominent in local politics for many years.  During the Indian War of 1855 Miller had business with someone camped at Fort Raglan, one of the several places in Thurston County where settlers banded together for protection.<br>
<br>
When Miller was within a mile of the Fort he saw a band of terri-
tonal volunteers in the distance who were returning to the Fort from a scouting expedition.  Miller mistook the casually dressed volunteers as Indians and started to run towards the Fort.<br>
One of the volunteers noted Miller's mistake,gave an Indian war whoop which added terror to the already frightened horses.  Mr. Miller was thrown from his horse and struggled on in leaving the horse to its fate.<br>
<br>
He also left a package containing a pair of trousers and some other items on the trail.  Miller, being a proper gentleman, dressed in overalls on the road and expected to change into more proper attire once reaching the Fort.<br>
<br>
According to Elizabeth Hawk who was at the Fort that day, "...the boys seeing that Miller lost his pants, made the loss a sore subject with him and teased him without mercy, and being so frightened by the Indians that he ran away from that very useful garment."<br>

<br>
I remember of hearing them tell of a Mr. Miller who had business at the fort and he started from Olympia accompanied by a Frenchman by the name of Tebo.  They had got within a mile of the fort when seeing a band of volunteers returning from a scouting expedition, they mistook them of Indians and started to run.<br>
<br>
One of the volunteers seeing their mistake gave an Indian war
whoop which added terror to their already frightened horses.  Mr. Miller was thrown from his horse, and leaving him to his fate, Tebo rode toward the fort and seeing the children who had been allowed outside of the fort, as there was no signs of danger, started yelling at them to run for the gate and as my little sister was rather plump and was lagging the old man yelled at her, "you little deiffel, run, I say," but seeing that with fright and such encouragement she was not likely to reach the gates, he rode up her up, galloped in just as the gates were being and picking shut.<br>
<br>
Our boys picked Mr. Miller up and brought him in.  As there were a number of ladies in the fort(some of them widows), Mr. Miller had provided himself with an extra pair of pants, to be put on upon reaching the fort, and had worn overalls on the road.  In the fracas he lost his pants, and the boys seeing this, made the loss a sore subject with him, and teased him without mercy, and being so frightened by the Indians that he ran away from that very useful garment.  Mr. Miller afterward became a prominent citizen of Olympia.<br>

Sarah McAllister Hartman.<br>
In order to be nearer home, mother moved to this place, and then our hard times began.  There were nine in our family and we had rations for three men.  We were there for one year, and I don't remember having a substantial meal during the time.<br>
<br>
While there, my younger brother went to the farm to get something for the family to eat.  John, while trying to shoot some ducks, shot himself in the hand, crippling himself for life.  We had some very bad Indian scares in that place; my blood used to run cold when the order came "All children must sleep in the block house." We were packed like sardines in the upper floor of the block house.<br>
<br>
On account of my brother being shot, mother could not go with<br>
us, so we had to go alone; lying on the rough puncheon floor with only a blanket over us.  The lower part of the place was occupied by soldier@ and if we made any noise they would swear at us.<br>
<br>
One day an Indian came up the river, and as he neared the fort he<br>
put a white rag on his paddle and we paddling past in his canoe.  Some young men spoke to the commander about it, but he would not permit them to intercept him, and several young men started <B>in </B>pursuit.  One of them had been very recently married and his poor bride could not bear to see him go, so she locked him in their
<br>
room, locking herself outside to be away from his persuasions to be released.<br>
<br>
Nothing daunted, he kicked the door down and started after the other men, overtaking them before they got to the drift, where, sure enough there sat three Indians waiting for the fourth.  The men waited too; presently he came and began to unload his ammunition, when the boys proceeded to convert him into a good Indian.<br>
<br>
The sentinels were often firing off their alarm gun, thereby creating terrible excitement.  At one time a company of soldiers were coming for reinforcements, Gen.  W.W. Miller commanding.  Some overanxious sentinel fired his gun, thinking it was Indians coming to attack the fort.  Someone in the fort gave a war whoop, and those coming up answered it.  This caused alarm, each party thinking the others were Indians.  To make matters worse, they had let us children out on the island to gather berries, sending a guide with us.  As soon as the women heard the war whoop, they started outside for the children.<br>
<br>
The officers ordered them to return but they did not feel obliged to obey, so kept on.  The officers charged them with their horses, but several got through, mother among them.  Meantime, we children were being sent across the slough in two small canoes.  They put the small over first, making the rest await their return.<br>
<br>
There we stood, while Indians( as we thought) were charging and about to cut us off from the fort.  Both parties were yelling like mad.  We little ones stood there until the  others got over. I think I can tell very nearly how the soldiers feel in battle.  All across, they then started us on a run across a sand-bar, where we sank ankle deep at every step, the men riding behind crowding us on.<br>
<br>
The nearer the(imaginary)Indians came, the harder they pushed us.  Seeing that the little ones couldn't make it, they began picking them up, putting them on their horses.  Being rather stout, my feet were soon pulled from under me by my two leaders, and I was being dragged along, when an old man, named Weabaux, made a grab for me, but missed me.<br>
<br>
Wheeling his horse, he tried it again with no better success.  He then thought to frighten me, and drew his sword and thrust it at me, but I could only fall down and scream.  Then he would make another grab with the same result.  Becoming provoked he commenced to scold me, something after the following manner: "Geet up, you leetle fool.  Geet up I say.  I cuts your leggs off wit' mine sword" -- making a slash at me ---"Geet up, you leetle divil --- I cuts your head off next time." --Another slash---"Goin' right off and leaves her here and lets the Injuns
eat her up alive! You leetle red headed divil,<br>
geet up--geet up!"<br>
<br>
The old man was scolding at the top of his voice, he being a little deaf and thinking everyone else was more so.  Some one picked me up on their horse and carried me to the fort.  I never knew who it was.<br>
<br>
This is a fair specimen of the scares in the worst place I was<br>
ever in.<br>

Clinton Snowden, "Haller's Defeat," <B>History of Washington. The rise and progress of an American state.</B> New York: The Century Publishing Company, 1909, Volume III p. 335-338.<br>
<br>
Haller's force left the Dalles October 3d, 1855 and proceeded rapidly northward.  On the 6th it had crossed the divide, and just as the advance was descending its northern slope, into the valley of one of the upper tributaries of the Simcoe River, it encountered a strong body of Indians, a large part of whom were concealed in the timber growing along the banks of the streams.<br>
<br>
At some distance, on a high, barren bill, a chief appeared, who called loudly to his warriors, apparently inciting them to action, and they responded with a series of whoops and yells, which convinced the troops that the enemy was present in large force.  An effective charge was immediately made, by which the Indians were driven from the timber, and forced back over the hills.  The losses of the command at this point were one killed and seven wounded.<br>
<br>
The troops now took possession of a high ridge, from which most of the surrounding country could be readily seen.  They had advanced so far that there was no longer any timber beyond them, in which the Indians could conceal themselves except at one place on the left, in which a number of them had taken refuge.<br>
<br>
It was apparent that they already outnumbered the troops, and several large war parties soon afterward arrived, which greatly increased their confidence.  A battle had begun and the Indians, relying on their numbers, were determined to make a stand.  Arrangements were accordingly made, as quickly as possible, to dispose the troops in the most advantageous position.<br>
<br>
To do this Captain D. A. Russell, who occupied the left of the line, made a charge, with a small force, to dislodge the Indians from the bushes in his front, as they held this point of vantage in con-
siderable numbers, and with some persistence.  They were not driven from it without difficulty, and night came on before they were finally compelled to abandon it.<br>
<br>
After the wounded had been collected and cared for, the command advanced about a mile, to a more desirable position, on a higher ridge, where it would be more secure against a night attack.  It was dark before this position was gained, and from the noise made by the Indians it was, for a time, thought they were preparing to attack.<br>
<br>
One of the guides who had accompanied the party, made an inspection of their line, and reported that their preparations indicated such an attempt, but no attack was made until after daylight on the following morning.<br>
<br>
During the night Major Haller ascertained that the position he now
occupied was no doubt defensible, but as it was destitute of wood, grass and water, it was evident that it could not long be held.<br>
<br>
On the morning of the 7th the little force found itself nearly surrounded by fully seven or eight hundred Indians, whose numbers were doubled by fresh arrivals during the day.<br>
<br>
Taking advantage of an opening in the Indian line, Ma* jor Haller sent off a courier to the Dalles, with a request that Lieutenant Day and the forty-four men of the third artillery who remained there might be sent to bis assistance.<br>
<br>
During all of Sunday the troops held their position, although suffering greatly for water.  The Indians at no time attacked them in force, but annoyed them by advancing small parties of skirmishers, which were driven back by repeated bayonet charges.  At sunset neither side had gained any particular advantage, but the troops could not much longer maintain their ground without water, and Haller accordingly determined to draw off, during the night, and return to the Dalles.<br>
<br>
His losses during the day had been two soldiers killed and thirteen wounded, and it was apparent that the retreat would be very greatly encumbered by having to care for these disabled men.<br>
<br>
That night all the horses that could be spared were turned loose, much of the baggage and provisions were destroyed, and the troops were safely withdrawn from the position which they had beld during the day.  But unfortunately the rear guard became separated from the advance, and a halt was made by the column which Haller himself com-
manded, and which had the wounded in charge, at a short distance from the battlefield, in a place which offered some advantages for defense.<br>
<br>
Here fires were kindled by the soldiers to notify their comrades of their position, but these also gave notice to the Indians that the troops were escaping, and the fight was almost immediately resumed.  Haller's force now amounted to only forty-four effective men, and these,, on the morning of the 8th, resumed the retreat.  A running fight ensued, which continued nearly the whole day.  Near sundown the soldiers made a final charge on their pursuers, by which they drove them off, and they were not again molested.<br>
<br>
Captain Russell's portion of the command was not attacked during the retreat, having taken a separate trail, and therefore escaped the observation of their pursuers.  All the wounded reached the Dalles in safety, but the howitzer was spiked and abandoned during the retreat.  The total loss, during these three days of fighting, was five soldiers killed and seventeen wounded.  The Indian loss was never known, but was believed to have been much larger.
Lieutenant Slaughter learned of the failure of Haller's expedition shortly after he had crossed the mountains, and realizing that his small force would be entirely at the mercy of the Indians should they assemble in force to attack him, he fell back through the Nachess Pass, and took up a position on the White River, from which he reported to Captain Maloney.<br>

Haller's battle<br>
<br>
Charles H. Carey, "Haller's battle," <B>General History of Oregon.</B> Portland: Binfords and Mort, 1971, p. 581-82.<br>
<br>
A party of prospectors crossing the country of the Yakimas on the way to the mines, in August, 1855, was reported to have disappeared, and soon afterward another party was attacked, but not annihilated, two persons being killed and three escaping to carry the news of their misadventure to the settlement.<br>
<br>
A. J. Bolon, special agent to the Yakimas, went alone to hold a conference with Kamiakin- Bolon never returned, and a Des Chutes spy, sent by Indian Agent Nathan Olney from The Dalles, ascertained that he had been treacherously shot, September 23, 1855, in the Simeoe mountains, about fifteen miles from the present site of Goldendale, Washington, by a sub-chief named Qual-chan, son of Owhi, and his body and that of his horse had been burned to conceal the crime.<br>
<br>
Kamiakin, in a talk with the spy, was said to have expressed regret only that the killing of Bolon had anticipated his plans for a later well organized and widespread uprising.<br>
<br>
But, the Yakimas and Klickitats had been preparing for war, so that when Major Haller, of the regulars, who left The Dalles, October 3, with eighty-six regulars, under orders to -arrest the murderers of Bolon, reached the Simcoe, October 6, he was surrounded by a body of several hundred well armed warriors and was compelled to retreat, suffering a loss of five men killed and seventeen wounded.<br>
<br>
Haller spiked and buried a howitzer and abandoned it on the way.  A company of fifty regulars, commanded by Lieut.  William A. Slaughter, meanwhile had been dispatched from Fort Steilacoom to the Yakima country, by way of the Naches pass, but withdrew on learning that Haller had been repulsed and that the Yakimas and Klickitats
were on the warpath in overwhelming numbers.<br>
<br>
News of Haller's retreat, which was exaggerated in the first reports, caused excitement throughout Oregon and Washington.  Maj.  Gabriel J. Rains, in command of the United States military district, ordered out all the available troops at Vancouver, The Dalles and Steilacoom, and called on the governor of Oregon for four companies, and the governor of Washington for two companies of volunteers, to be mustered into service of the United<br>
States.<br>
<br>
Acting Governor Mason of Washington responded with the desired quota and at the same time summoned other volunteers to protect the settlers around Puget Sound.<br>
<br>
Governor Curry of Oregon, issued a call, October 11, 1855, for eight companies instead of the four requested, the men to furnish their own arms and equipment where possible.<br>

MODOC WAR.<br>
<br>
Ivan Doig, "Fox among the Modocs," <B>Pacific Search.</B> (May, 1976) p. 12-13.<br>
<br>
I write this despatch in Captain Jack's cave, in the lava beds ...<br>
-Edward Fox, in the New York Herald<br>
February   28,   1873<br>
<br>
An exotic setting, a charismatic figure defying all odds, an intrepid New York Herald reporter trekking in to tell the tale: the scenario lacks only strong hand-shake and the murmured greeting,<br>
"Captain Jack, I presume?" But unlike the Livingston in-
darkest-Africa classic which had thrilled the era, Edward Fox's exclusive for his newspaper featured a guerrilla leader who was frustrating a force of several hundred U.S. soldiers.<br>
<br>
Fox, in effect, was eluding the official version of events just as Captain Jack and his tiny band of Modoc warriors were eluding the troops.  The night the newspaperman and the Modoc leader met, their interests coincided splendidly.<br>
<br>
... I had the pleasure of an introduction to Hawker Jim, Modoc Dave, and Steamboat Frank. these three gentlemen were all armed to the teeth ....<br>
<br>
The Modoc War came out of years of festering conflict in the Oregon-California border country.  Amid the government paperwork on the episode is a petition sent in early 1872 from "the undersigned citizens of Lost and Link River, Klamath, and Tule Lake country" to the Oregon superintendent of Indian affairs and the Army general whose command lay within the region.<br>
<br>
The aggrieved settlers, 44 in number, complained of "suffering years of annoyance from the presence of the Modoc Indians," then wheeled up the grandly rhetorical question: ". . . shall a petty Indian chief, with twenty desperadoes, and a squalid band of three<br>
hundred miserable savages any longer set at defiance the strong arm of the Government(?)"<br>
<br>
Angry language and all, that piece of paper summed up the issue for the white settlers in the troubled sector of southernmost Oregon.<br>
<br>
The Indians, other sources show, saw the matter differently.  By an 1864 treaty, which took away the native tribes' title to some
20,000 square miles in Oregon, the Modocs had been shunted onto a reservation with the Klamath Indians, north of what is now the town of Klamath Falls.<br>
<br>
Modocs and Klamaths were ancient antagonists; now the Modocs, a rugged and aggressive tribe, were supposed to dwell bucolically in the land of their enemies.  Perhaps what is most surprising is that about half the tribe did follow the old chief Schonchin to the new reservation, while a group of younger braves went back to their native grounds near Tule Lake, on the Oregon-California border.<br>
<br>
Their leader, the -petty Indian chief who so outraged the white petitioners, was Kientpoos, known among the whites as 'Captain Jack.'<br>
<br>
Despite the later sensational publicity which made him out to be either the Attila of the Pacific Coast or the cleverest military tactician since Julius Caesar, Captain Jack seems to have been merely an admired tribal figure who constantly had to provide bravado to hold his followers-a princeling caught in a role which demanded a messiah.<br>
<br>
Under the pressure and persuasion of A. B. Meacham, Oregon's superintendent of Indian affairs, Captain Jack grudgingly moved his band back onto the Klamath Reservation in 1870.  Within a few months, after tiffs with the Klamaths, Captain Jack's group headed back to the area around the Lost River and Tule Lake.<br>
<br>
During the next year and a half, there were tense incidents between the Modocs and white settlers, culminating in the settlers' petition.  On November 25, 1872, the new superintendent of Indian affairs passed along to the U.S. Army the latest orders from Washington, D.C.:<br>
<br>
"You are directed to remove the Modoc Indians to Camp Yainax on Klamath reservation, peaceably if you possibly can, but forcibly if you must."<br>
<br>
Four days later, about 40 U.S. soldiers and ten civilians tried to surround the Modoc camp on Lost River, but succeeded only in killing one Modoc warrior and scattering the rest into the brush.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for the Army men, the Modocs scattered southward into an ancient redoubt-the fantastic landscape the Indians called the land of burnt-out fires, the Lava Beds of northern California.<br>

<br>
and I discovered what I had taken to be a flat plain was a rolling surface, covered with sharp-edged rocks, and interspersed with large and deep holes, half filled with broken scoria.... The Modocs appeared to skip nimbly over the rocks, but our horses were completely nonplussed, and my quadruped    required considerable persuasion in order to induce him to move forward. . .<br>
<br>
In theory, the Army now had Captain Jack's band penned in, the troopers and civilian volunteers outnumbering the Indians by at least ten to one, with advantages of artillery and mortar besides.  In actuality, the Army forces were at the classic disadvantage of trying to pin down guerrilla marksmen on their home ground.  The next major incident in the Modoc War came on January 17, 1873, and a pair of reports from the Army's commanding officer sums up what happened:<br>
<br>
A few days before engaging the Modocs in the Lava Beds, Lt.  Colonel Frank Wheaton had reported to headquarters "We leave for Captain Jack's Gibraltar to-morrow morning, and a more enthusiastic, jolly set of regulars and volunteers I never had the pleasure to command."<br>
<br>
After the colonel's jolly command caught up with the Modocs, the tone of correspondence was different: "We fought the Indians through the lava-beds to their stronghold, which is in the center of miles of rocky fissures, caves, crevices, gorges, and ravines, some of them one hundred feet deep.  In the opinion of any experienced officer of regulars or volunteers, one thousand men would be required to dislodge them from their almost impregnable position."<br>
<br>
Fighting from the advantage of fog and the jumbled terrain of the Lava Beds, the Modocs had routed the big force of soldiers, killing at least nine of them and wounding 30 others, while apparently not losing a single warrior themselves.<br>
<br>
... Mr.  Fairchild explained that I was a paper man, and that I had come from far off, from the big city by the sea, and that I was anxious to hear the Indians' own story of their troubles....<br>
<br>
Better drama than the unfolding saga in the Lava Beds couldn't be invented, a point which did not pass unnoticed in the distant offices of the New York Herald.  James Gordon Bennett, Jr., publisher of the Herald, had a penchant for sending his men on spectacular missions.  It was Bennett who a few years earlier had summoned a tough young reporter named Henry Morton Stanley and told him to search central Africa to find the famed missionary, Dr. David Livingston.<br>
<br>
And it was Bennett who had a correspondent named Januarius Aloysius
MacGahan spectacularly covering battles ranging from the Paris Commune of 1871 to the Cossack raids against rebels in farthest Turkestan.  And now it was Bennett who dispatched his newspapers yachting editor, a long-haired Englishman named Edward Fox, to find and interview Captain Jack.<br>
<br>
Fox seems to have been a burly, intrepid new man.  A contemporary article describes him as being -fat and rugged as a California grizzly," and as will be seen, his trip into the Lava Beds was no jaunt for a faint heart.  But upon arriving at the now-famous scene of hostilities in early February, Fox and the handful of other war correspondents found that peace had broken out.<br>
<br>
The Secretary of the Interior had named a commission to talk with Captain Jack and the Modocs, and the Army for the moment was to stand aside and give the peace parley a chance.<br>
<br>
I was told ... that there was a little difference of opinion as to whether the Herald correspondent was to be admitted to the council.  To the credit of the Modoc nation, I am happy to say that the friends of literature predominated...<br>
<br>
As the peace commissioners met to talk over their approach to the Modocs, the reporters quickly were bristling at an official clamp on, news.  A.B. Meacham, the former superintendent of Indian affairs who was now chairman of the peace commission, preferred to hold private sessions and then tell the waiting correspondents what he wanted them to hear.  When two local white men and two Indian women were sent into the Lava Beds to arrange a conference with Captain   Jack,    Meacham    "most emphatically refused- Fox's request to go along, then specifically told the local men not to let any. newspapermen accompany them.<br>
<br>
Fox found out what route the little group would follow into the Lava Beds the next morning, then elaborately let it be known that he was going off to spend the night with some artillery officers at another encampment.  He did indeed visit the Officers, but left their camp early in the morning to double back and find the little peace delegation.<br>
<br>
When he rode up to them, one of the men was willing to have Fox come along, but the other felt bound to honor the peace commissioners' instructions against nosy newsmen.  Fox again acted diffident and, as he later recounted, merely said: 'Well if that is the case, I suppose I must defer my visit."<br>
<br>
He deferred it only until the Peace Party was out of sight, then began following their tracks in the fresh three-inch snowfall- At every hill, Fox would dismount and peep over the crest until the group was out of sight, then trot his horse to the next ridge line-
It wasn't the pleasantest of rides; Fox became aware that he was passing through the country where the Modocs had bloodily fought the first tides of white immigrants to Oregon and California, and he was unnerved when a pair of big ravens dourly, flapped close to his head for a couple of miles.<br>
<br>
Finally, well into the Lava Beds, Fox rode rapidly and caught up with the peace delegation.<br>
<br>
... The guide suddenly disappeared down a dark hole. The Herald correspondent followed, but, not being acquainted with the nature of the country, went down faster than necessary, and found himself a large cave, lit up by the blaze of a fire, which was burning in the center, and gave sufficient light to enable me to see some fifty or sixty Modocs seated around in circles four or five deep<br>
<br>
A disgusted Army officer had said that Captain Jack's elusive Modocs lived in the Lava Beds like "ants in a sponge," and Fox and the truce party found the description apt.  Met by the three gentlemen ... all armed to the teeth," the visitors were escorted into the Modoc camp.<br>
<br>
After some argument among the Indians, Fox was permitted to attend the parley with Captain Jack. . Fox's over rapid descent into the council cave at last brought him to the man he had been sent across the continent to find.<br>
<br>
"Captain Jack then went over the story of the fight on Los River and directly denied that the Indians shot first..."Did not make first fight. I want every good. I am not ashamed of first fight. Glad to see white come to talk."<br>
<br>
It was explained to Captain Jack and the rest of the Modoc assembly that Fox was a "paper man" eager to hear their side of the story.  The peace commissions message to the Modocs was read aloud and interpreted, then the Indians began talking about their grievances.<br>
<br>
After a couple of hours the council ended, but Fox talked on with several Indians and then with Captain Jack himself.  Despite the thrilling lead sentence of Fox's article in the Herald, he apparently did the writing not in the council cave, but after he and the peace party rode back to the Army lines.  In any case, Fox's long story set forth the Indians claims of mistreatment on the Klamath reservation and quoted Captain Jack at length.  He also provided a summary and a dire forecast:<br>
<br>
... From what I have seen of the Indians in the lava beds and from what I have teamed of their history I think they have been badly treated and that the origin of the war can be traced to a few Oregonians. The California settlers have never had any trouble with these Indians.  They are now in a stronghold that is nearly impregnable, and, as they have many men and good marksmen it will
require a force of a, thousand men to clean them out, and it cannot be done without a fearful sacrifice of life.<br>
<br>
On February 28, 1873, the New York Herald ran Fox's story with proper hoopla.  Beneath the headline reading "IN THE MODOC CAMP" ran 23 sub headlines, and the text covered all of page three, which in those days was the newspapers main news page.<br>
<br>
Fox had completed his transcontinental assignment, and done it in high Herald style.  The rest of the Modoc War story is grimmer.  Peace negotiations with the Indians stumbled on until April 11, 1873.  That day, the Modocs fired on the peace commissioners during a palaver and killed the Rev.  Eleazar Thomas and Gen.  E.R.S. Canby.<br>
<br>
Next, in what is called the Three Days Fight of April 15-17, the Army forces broke the Modocs into small, disorganized bunches.  On June 1, Captain Jack was captured in the Langell Valley of southern Oregon.<br>
<br>
Subsequently, Captain Jack and three other Modocs were tried by a military tribunal at Ft.  Klamath for the deaths of Canby and Thomas.  They were found guilty, were hanged and their heads were cut off and sent to the Smithsonian Institution.<br>
<br>
As for Edward Fox, he eventually returned to England and then drifted to western Australia.  On March 4,1895, he was drowned in a boating accident near Perth.  The obituary that ran in the New York Tribune summed up 'his grandest journalistic feat:<br>
Mr. Fox was well known here as"Modoc" Fox.<br>

MODOC WAR.<br>
<br>
Robert M. Utley and Wilcomb E. Washburn, "Captain Jack and the Modoc War," <B>American Heritage Library of Indian Wars.</B> Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1977. p. 349-354.<br>
<br>
As the Plains Indians' resistance to the reservation process burgeoned toward a climax at Little Bighorn, a small tribe in far-off California expressed its own opposition in a sudden violent revolt.  For eight months in 1872-73 the Modoc War held national attention and shook almost to collapse the foundations of President Grant's Peace Policy.<br>
<br>

Never a large tribe-by 1870 fewer than three hundred-the Modocs were a rugged, combative people who, like kindred groups in the Great Basin, lived by a combination of hunting, fishing, digging roots, and gathering.  Surrounding tribes feared them as violent neighbors, plunderers, and slave traffickers.<br>
<br>
White immigrants of the 1850s, destined for Oregon or California on the Applegate Trail, also experienced their warlike character, until Californians banded together in a bloody retaliation that all but ended the menace.  The Modocs fell into a friendly trade relationship with the people at Yreka, California, began to wear white men's clothes, and even adopted the names that the whites gave them-Bogus Charley, Hooker Jim, Steamboat Frank, Shacknasty Jim.<br>
<br>
One of the foremost Modoc leaders was a young man named Kintpuash, whom the whites called Captain Jack. His downturned mouth and heavy, sad eyes gave him a lethargic cast belied by his dynamic, ambitious, and aggressive character.  He was not the principal Modoc chief, but his outspoken opposition to reservation life voiced the sentiments of most of the tribe and lifted him to a position of commanding, if fleeting, leadership.<br>
<br>
Some years before, with great misgivings, Captain Jack had signed at Council Grove a treaty that bound Modocs, Klamaths, and Northern Paiutes to cede their lands and settle on the Klamath Reservation north and east of Upper Klamath Lake in Oregon.  As expected, he found life among the arrogant Klamaths intolerable, and after a year, with a band of like-minded followers, he left the reservation an returned to his homeland-a grassy plateau country dappled by lakes and lava deposits lying at the eastern base of the Cascade Mountains along the California-Oregon boundary.<br>
<br>
Jack and his people took up residence on Lost River where it flows from the north into Tule Lake.<br>
<br>
For the next seven years Modocs and settlers lived uneasily side by side in this country, the Modocs increasingly apprehensive as more and more whites arrived, the settlers equally apprehensive as the Indians stubbornly resisted all efforts to persuade them to go back to the Klamath Reservation.<br>
<br>
When the Council Grove Treaty finally won ratification in 1870, agitation for removal of the Modocs intensified.  At last, in 1872, the Indian Bureau obtained consent to call on the army to make the Indians return.  At dawn on November 29, 1872, a troop of cavalry from Fort Klamath drew up on the edge of Captain Jack's camp.  After an exchange of rifle fire the Indians scattered, and the Modoc War was on.<br>
<br>
Instead of going north to the reserve, the Modocs hurried south, leaving a trail of death and destruction among settlers around the
margins of Tule Lake.  On the south shore of the lake lay the lava beds, a twisted mass of black rock piled up in fantastic formations and riddled with subterranean passages.  The Indians called it Land of Burnt-Out Fires.<br>
<br>
To the soldiers who began to close around it after the Modocs took refuge there <B>it </B>became known as Captain Jack's Stronghold. It was an almost impregnable fortress.  Scarcely more than fifty <B>fighting </B>men manned it against a besieging force that ultimately numbered a thousand regulars and militiamen.<br>
<br>
The army began to concentrate units at Tule Lake immediately after the Lost River encounter.  The military commander in the Northwest was Brigadier General Edward R. S. Canby, a spare, beardless veteran of the Navaho campaigns of the 1850s and the bearer of a distinguished Civil War record.<br>
<br>
A compassionate man, Canby had not approved of the decision to coerce the Modocs-but he had not protested it either.  He sent Lieutenant Colonel Frank Wheaton to blast the Indians out of their fortress with cannon and riflemen.  On January 16, 1873, the blue lines advanced.<br>
<br>
The Battle of the Stronghold was a disaster for the army.  Heavy fog obscured the scene.  The artillery dropped a few rounds in front of the advancing skirmish lines but ceased when the shells began to endanger friends more than foe.  The Indians fired with an accuracy that, combined with the rugged terrain, slowed and then halted the assault.<br>
<br>
When the fog at last lifted, the troops were caught in exposed positions, and Modoc fire kept them pinned down until darkness allowed them to retreat in safety.  The battle cost  the  attacking  force  nine  killed  and twenty-eight wounded and shattered morale as well.  Not once had a soldier even seen a Modoc.<br>
<br>
The government next resolved on diplomacy, and in February a peace commission arrived.  <B>It </B>foundered in confusion until late in March, when General Canby was placed in charge.  He adopted a twofold policy of urging peace talks while bringing a tightening ring of  reinforcements and drawing his lines in and around the stronghold.<br>
<br>
Captain Jack consented to talk, and a tent was pitched midway between the lines. Jack demanded a reservation in his homeland.  Canby offered only unconditional surrender.<br>
<br>
The peace initiative opened a rift in the Modoc leadership.  Jack argued that patience and persistence would earn favorable terms in the end, but most of the other chiefs disagreed.  The white people could never be trusted, they declared; the best course was to murder the peace commissioners in hopes that this would scare the
soldiers away.<br>
<br>
Jack attacked such treachery as folly that would bring death to every Modoc.  The militants shouted him down, called <B>him </B>a woman and a coward, even roughed him up.  At length they goaded him into accepting their plan and taking the lead in carrying <B>it </B>out.<br>
<br>
On Good Friday morning, April 11, 1873, a fateful meeting took place at the peace tent.  The commissioners had been warned of possible treachery by Toby Riddle, the Modoc wife of Canby's interpreter.<br>
<br>
Noting his array of military strength, however, the general ignored the warning.  Another commissioner, the Reverend Eleasar Thomas, said that "where God called him to go he would go," to which Commissioner Alfred B. Meacham replied that God had not been in the Modoc camp all winter.<br>
<br>
The warning was tragically prophetic.  The council had just begun when Jack suddenly shot Canby full in the face, then stabbed him repeatedly until he died, and finally stripped him of his dress uniform, which the Modoc chieftain later donned as a symbol of his deed and his continuing leadership.  Other Indians killed Thomas and wounded Meacham.  The interpreters and a fourth commissioner, L. S. Dyar, escaped unharmed.<br>
<br>
As Captain Jack had foreseen, the brutal slaying of Canby the only general of regulars killed in the entire history of Indian<br>
warfare-served only to enrage the whites and bring in more soldiers.  In the face of another attack, on April 15, the Modocs slipped out and took up new positions in a lava formation farther south.<br>
<br>
On April 26 the Modocs sighted a reconnoltering party of sixty-six soldiers and a dozen Indian scouts.  Incredibly the troops paused for lunch in a bowl-like depression perfect.for an ambush, taking no precautions against a surprise attack.  Scarfaced Charley, the true military genius of the Modoc resistance, struck with only twenty-two warriors.<br>
<br>
Some of the soldiers fled in panic while the rest stood their ground in a brief but futile defense.  All five officers perished along with twenty enlisted men.  To the survivors, including sixteen wounded, Scarfaced Charley called out in contempt: "All you fellows that ain't dead had better go home.  We don't want to kill you all in one day." He then permitted them to retreat without further assault.<br>
<br>
Although humiliating to the army, this Modoc victory falled to quiet the dissension among the Indian leaders.  In fact, some of
thel very militants who had forced Captain Jack to kill the peace commissioners turned on him and urged an end to resistance.  By the middle of May all the Modocs had slippe@out of their defenses and scattered.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, a new commander had infused fresh spirit into the troops.  This was Colonel Jefferson C. Davis (no relation to the recent Confederate president), a fiery, profane veteran of Sherman's Georgia campaigns.  Under his forceful leadership, the troops combed the countryside, scooping up one party of Indians after another.<br>
<br>
By the end of May almost all the fugitives had been seized.  On June 1 a cavalry patrol coaxed an exhausted Captain Jack and his family out of a cave and took them prisoner.<br>
<br>
General Sherman demanded retribution swift and severe: the slayers of Canby to be tried for murder and all the Modocs sent to reservations far to the east, "so that the name of Modoc shall cease.  " Scarcely a month after his surrender, Captain Jack and five other Modocs-without benefit of a lawyer or an interpreter-were tried by a military commission and sentenced to death.<br>
<br>
President Grant commuted two of the sentences to life imprisonment.  On October 3, 1873, Captain Jack, Boston Charley, Black Jim, and Schonchin John died on a scaffold erected on the Fort Klamath parade ground.  In a grisly gesture to scientific inquiry, their heads were sent to the Army Medical Museum, in Washington D.C.<br>
<br>
Escorted by soldiers, 155 Modocs took up the journey to new homes in Indian Territory, far to th east. "They are a sorry pitiful looking set to have given so much trouble," observed an officer.<br>

WASHINGTON TERRITORIAL MILITIA IN THE NEZ PERCE INDIAN WAR<br>
<B><br>
Virgil Field, </B>The Official History of the Washington National Guard, Volume Four. Washington National Guard in the Philippine Insurrection. Chapter II Washington Territorial Militiz in the Nez Perce War of 1877. Tacoma: Military Department of Washington..<B><br>
<br>
</B><br>
Although the Nez Perce Indian War of 1877 Was fought mainly in the adjacent State of Oregon and the Territories of Idaho and Montana, some reference must be made of this war in our history, inasmuch as Washington Territorial Militia participated therein as well as in the Bannock Indian War of 1878.<br>
<br>
Again, as in dealing with hostilities against the Indians, correspondence, telegrams, and general field orders from and to the commander of the Department of the Columbia will be used to tell the story, with a minimum of narrative by your compiler.<br>
<br>
Major General Irwin McDowell, Commanding the Military Division of the Pacific, in his annual report to the Secretary of War in 1876 stated that Joseph with his band of Nez Perces had appeared in the Wallowa Valley and demanded the surrender of two men, McNall and Finley, accused of killing one of his Indians, and threat-
ened, in case his demand was not complied with, to destroy the farms of settlers therein, giving them a week's time to decide.<br>
<br>
General McDowell further advised that upon receipt of this intelligence, the Commanding Officer at Fort Walla Walla was at once directed to send one company of cavalry to the scene of difficulty.  As a result, Company E, First Cavalry, under the command of First Lieutenant A.G. Forse, was dispatched to the scene immediately.  He had an interview with Joseph, which resulted in his withdrawing his demands and threats, provided, the Military authorities would use their endeavors to bring the accused men before the civil authorities for trial.<br>
<br>
In his report, General McDowell called special attention to the fact that Joseph and his band consistently refused to live on their assigned reservation and asked that this matter be resolved by the appropriate agencies in Washington, D.C.  As a result a commission was created by the Interior Department to inquire into the matter.  Members were D.H. Jerome, Esquire, General O.O. Howard, USA, William Stickney, Esquire, A.C. Barstown, Esquire, and Major H.C. Wood, Assistant Adjutant General.  Their report was submitted to the Secretary of War by the Secretary of Interior by the following letters and inclosures:<br>
<br>
     DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR
Washington, 7 March 1877<br>
<br>
Sir:  I have the honor to transmit herewith a copy of a letter dated the 6th, instant, from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, upon the subject of the removal of Joseph's band of Nez Perce Indians from the Wallowa Valley to the Nez Perces reservation in Idaho, under the control of Agent Monteith.<br>
<br>
The recommendations of the Commissioner has the approval of this Department, and I have the honor to request that the commanding officer of troops in the Wallowa Valley be instructed to aid the Indian Office in effecting the removal of the Indians named to the Nez Perces agency.<br>
<br>
The extract from the letter of Agent Monteith mentioned by the Commissioner is herewith inclosed.<br>
<br>
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,<br>

OFFICE OF INDIAN AFFAIRS<br>
Washington, D.C., 6 March 1877<br>
<br>
Sir:  I have the honor to submit herewith, for the information of the War Department, an extract copy of a letter from John B. Monteith, United States Indian agent for the Nez Perces Indians, giving a detailed statement of his efforts to induce Joseph and his band of followers to abandon the Wallowa Valley and settle upon the Nez Perces reservation in Idaho.<br>
<br>
If Joseph can be induced to surrender his claims to this valley and settle down into peaceful habits upon the Nez Perces reservation, by yielding to him the privilege of an annual visit of four to six weeks in the Im-na-hah Valley for hunting and fishing, I see no objection to granting such a favor, and have so advised Agent Monteith this day.  The agent has been advised, however, that Joseph and his followers must obtain from him a pass to make this visit, or before absenting themselves from the reservation for any purpose and at the same time agree not to molest settlers in the Im-na-hah Valley or interfere with their vested rights.<br>
<br>
I fully concur in the views of Agent Monteith, that steps having been commenced for the removal of Joseph and his band, he should be made to realize that there can be no peace for him until he yields to this reasonable request of the government.  To secure that end, and to secure it promptly and successfully, I have the honor to recommend that the honorable Secretary of War be requested to issue the necessary instructions to the officer in
command of troops who were to be sent to occupy the Wallowa Valley, as contemplated in my report of the 6th of January last, upon this subject, to aid this department in the execution of some efficient plan for their peaceful removal to the Nez Perces agency.<br>
<br>
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,<br>

<br>
OFFICE INDIAN AGENT<br>
NEZ PERCES AGENCY<br>
Lapwai, Idaho, 9 February 1877<br>
<br>
Sir:  In accordance with instructions contained in department letter, dated 6 January 1877, marked "L", I notified Joseph of the wish and purpose of the government in regard to him, his band, and all bands  of roving Indians living off reservations.<br>
<br>
I sent "Reuben" (head Chief and brother-in-law of Joseph), "James Reuben" (son of Reuben), Whis-tas-kit" (Joseph's father-in-law), and "Captain John" to Joseph's camp, to talk to him and try to persuade him and his band to come on the reserve without any further trouble.<br>
<br>
The four Indians named above as messengers to Joseph are Nez Perces, and friends of Joseph.  The first night they spent with him, James Reuben informed Joseph and his people as to the nature of their visit, and of the wish of the government in regard to him, his band, and other like bands of roving Indians.<br>
<br>
The four reasoned with and counseled them to come on the reserve without any further opposition, and take good farms.  Joseph made no reply until the next day when he spoke as follows:<br>
<br>
"I have been talking to the whites many years about the land in question, and it is strange they cannot understand me.  The country they claim belonged to my father, and when he died it was given to me and my people, and I will not leave it until I am compelled to."<br>
<br>
Others of the Indians expressed themselves in the same manner. Reuben tried hard to persuade them to give up and come on the reserve, but they persisted in their refusal.<br>
<br>
There were present in the lodge where the council was held about forty Indians and fifteen outside, which is the strength of the band who claims Joseph as their Chief.<br>

There are other bands of Indians living on Salmon and Snake Rivers, who also refuse to move to reservations, and will not so remove, probably, until forced to do so.<br>
<br>
I think, from Joseph's actions, he will not come on the reserve until compelled to.  He has said so much to the Indians who have moved on the reserve, calling them cowards, etc, that he would be lowering himself in his own estimation, as well as in that of his immediate followers, did he not make some show of resistance.  By making such resistance, he could say to the other Indians, "I was overpowered, and did not come of my own choice," in case he is forced on the Reserve.<br>
<br>
When the four left them to return to the agency, Joseph and band were making preparations to go into the mountains near the Wallowa on a hunting excursion, If they could be induced to come to the reserve, with the understanding that they would be allowed to go to the Im-na-hah four to six weeks annually, for the purpose of hunting and fishing, would the department so agree?  So far as I am aware, there are no settlers in that valley - ie "IM-NA-HAH VALLEY" - and as the only way it can be entered is on horseback, over the mountains, I think it will be a long time before any settlers go there.<br>
<br>
The Imnahah River empties into the Snake River, and is a great salmon-fishing resort of the Indians. I think the commissioners who were here last fall would have been willing to have agreed to recommend that said fishing resort be reserved as a fishing ground for the Indians, had Joseph shown a willingness to come on the reserve.<br>
<br>
I have given Joseph until 1 April 1877, to come to the reserve peaceably.  They can come one time just as well as another, having nothing to hinder them in moving.<br>
<br>
I have gone as far as my instructions of the 6th ultimo will warrant, and now I respectfully ask for further instructions.<br>
<br>
If the department intends to compel Joseph to comply with its wishes, I would recommend that the officer in command of the troops who are to occupy Wallowa Valley, in the interest of peace, be instructed to call on Joseph and inform him that unless he goes on the Nez Perces reserve on or before 1 April 1877, he will be forced to do so by the soldiers and also inform him that he must remain on the reserve, not leaving it without a pass from the agent at Lapwai.  This would have the tendency to hurry him up and show him that the department is in earnest.  If he is allowed to have his own way this time, it will only make him more stubborn in the future.<br>
<br>
I have reserved enough land for them to locate on, and in the spring they could be provided with the agricultural implements as they need them.<br>

One of the objections that is made by the Indians in question, as well as the Indians at present on the reserve, is the occupation of so much good land in the Lapwai Valley by Messrs Caldwell and Finley.<br>
<br>
*          *           *           *          *<br>
<br>
All of which is respectfully submitted, very respectfully,<br>
<br>
JOHN B. MONTEITH<br>
HON J.Q. SMITH,                       UNITED STATES COMMISSIONER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS                      INDIAN AGENT<br>
Washington, D.C.<br>
<br>
The foregoing was transmitted by the Secretary of War to General McDowell on 13 March 1877 with instructions that he would "comply with the request of the Secretary of the Interior, the removal to be conducted by the agents of the Indian Bureau, the military authorities protecting and aiding them in the execution of their instructions."  In turn the Commander of the Division of the Pacific forwarded the foregoing as follows:<br>
<br>
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE PACIFIC<br>
AND DEPARTMENT OF CALIFORNIA<br>
San Francisco, Calif, 24 March 1877<br>
<br>
Sir:  I am directed by the Division Commander to send you, and I do so herewith, an official copy of a communication dated 7 March 1877, from the Department of the Interior to the Secretary of War, transmitting a copy of a letter, dated 6th instant, from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, upon the subject of the removal of Joseph's band of Nez Perces Indians from the Wallowa Valley to the Nez Perces reservation in Idaho, under the control of Agent Montieth.  Accompanying the letter of the 6th is an extract from Agent Montieth's letter of 9 February 1877.<br>
<br>
The division commander desires your special attention to the indorsement on the foregoing papers, dated Headquarters of the Army, 13 March 1877.  This in connection with the orders given you by the General of the Army, dated 13 January 1877, in transmitting to you, through the division headquarters, a copy of the communication dated 6 January 1877 from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, relative to the occupation by the military of the Wallowa Valley, Oregon.<br>
<br>
By the orders of 13 January given you by the General of the Army, you are to comply with the request of the superintendent of Indian Affairs <B>IN THE INTEREST OF PEACE</B> (underlining is by the division commander).<br>
<br>
By the indorsement of 13 March, the action to be taken by the militia is further qualified as follows:<br>
<br>
"The removal to be conducted by the agents of the Indian Bureau,
the military authorities <B>MERELY PROTECTING AND AIDING THEM</B> in execution of their instructions."<br>
<br>
The division commander has examined the various papers transmitted from headquarters of the Army, hereinbefore referred to, and it seems to him that the Indian Bureau anticipate possible, not to say probable, resistance to the demand on Joseph to remove to the reservation.  In fact, the case seems not unlike that of the recent difficulties with the Sioux, which resulted in the war last year against these Indians.<br>
<br>
It is therefore, of paramount importance that none of the responsibility of any step which may lead to hostilities shall be initiated by the military authorities.  You are to occupy Wallowa Valley <B>IN THE INTEREST OF PEACE</B>.  You are to comply with the request of the Department of the Interior, as set forth in the papers sent you, to the extent of <B>MERELY PROTECTING AND AIDING THEM IN THE EXECUTION OF THEIR INSTRUCTIONS</B>.<br>
<br>
I am further to state, by order of the division commander, that if, in your judgment, in taking away the cavalry company from Fort Harney, it is now prudent to leave the post in charge of the company of infantry, he will send there the company of cavalry from Camp Bidwell; but as this will make it necessary to send up another company to replace the latter, and this from a great distance, requiring time and involving expense, when the allotment of Army transportation is low, he wishes to avoid doing so if it is possible.<br>
<br>
He desires to hear from you on this point.  As this question of the removal of Joseph's band is a very delicate and important one, the division commander directs that it be done under your personal direction, if practicable.<br>
<br>
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,<br>

On 19 April 1877, the Secretary of the Interior sent to the War Department a copy of a letter of 9 March 1877, from Agent Montieth, detailing an interview had by him with "Olicutt", Joseph's brother, pertaining to the removal of the Nez Perces
from Wallowa Valley to the Nez Perces reservation.  This was referred to General Howard by indorsement from the Adjutant General as follows:<br>
<br>
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, ADJUTANT GENERAL'S OFFICE<br>
Washington, 26 April 1877<br>
<br>
Official copy respectfully referred to the commanding general Department of the Columbia, through Headquarters Military Division of the Pacific.  The General of the Army is of the opinion that the Indian Bureau should resolve to remove the Indians or not according to their interpretation of the treaty, and that the Army should only aid them to execute the resolve when made.<br>
<br>
E.D. TOWNSEND<br>
Adjutant General<br>
<br>
The foregoing was indorsed to General Howard by order of General McDowell without any further instructions.  On 21 May, General Howard sent the following telegram of the measures taken to comply with the foregoing:<br>
<br>
Portland, Oregon<br>
<br>
"Returned Portland, evening of the 19th.  Non-treaty Nez Perces constrained compliance with order of government, Thirty days allowed to gather scattered people and stock.  Location on reservation selected and agreed upon.  Troops enough left in vicinity under commander Lapwai to enforce agreement case draw back.<br>
<br>
Some 500 wanderers from Umatillas and Yakima agencies still roaming - would join hostiles case outbreak.  Told them to talk their own seeking government requirement they go upon reservation.  Please ask Agent Wilbur be designated by telegram. Indian Bureau cooperate with me for these Indians, as Agent Montieth has well done for Nez Perces.  Wish one head.  Wilbur best man every way."<br>
<br>
On 22 May, General Howard made a full report of his action in the matter which was forwarded to Headquarters of the Army arriving on 8 June 1877.  In the meantime, General Howard reported the start of hostilities by these Indians on 15 June 1877.<br>
<br>
The following is a report made by Brigadier General O.O. Howard on his operations against the Nez Perce Indians:<br>
<br>
Headquarters Department of the Columbia<br>
In the Field, Camp Ebstein, Henry Lake, Idaho<br>
27 August 1877<br>
<br>
Colonel:  For the information of General McDowell, and to enable him to mention our operations in his annual report, I will
furnish such brief account as I can during the active campaign.  I would like the privilege of making a full and connected supplementary report embracing operations of other of my troops than those in this column after my report to the Army Department.  You already know the steps that were taken as required by orders to put renegade Nez Perces and other wandering bands of Indians upon their proper reservations.<br>
<br>
My efforts in conjunction with Colonel E.C. Watkins, the inspector of the Interior Department, and the Indian Agents concerned were apparently completely successful on June 14th, the date of my arrival at Lapwai.<br>
<br>
The Indians belonging to Joseph, from Wallowa, to White Bird, from Salmon River, and to Looking Glass, from the Clearwater, were then assembled near Cottonwood Creek, on the borders of the Lapwai Reserve.  As they seemed to hesitate at the last moment to fulfill the promises made to me thirty days before, I directed Captain David Perry, First Cavalry, to send a small detachment of men thither to observe and bring back report; detachment to start early the l5th.  Meanwhile, just at dark, a citizen, Mr. L.P. Brown, gets a letter to me from Mount Idaho, expressing suspicions of Indians keeping faith.<br>
<br>
Friday, 15 June.  The detachment having proceeded part of the way, at 12 M, with two Indians, much excited.  They report four citizens on John Day creek killed.  Murderers, three or four in number, had rushed into Indian's Camp, and talked excitedly. White Bird mounted his horse, rode around and avowed that the Indians would not go the reservation.<br>
<br>
I then go at once with the reporting Indians to Colonel Watkins, and Indian Agent Montieth, at Nez Perces Agency.  After examination, it seems to have been a private quarrel, according to Indian story.  Colonel Watkins sends the head chief and Joseph's father-in-law immediately toward Indian Camp.  At 4:30 P.M., these Indians, with Mr. West and Looking Glass's brother, returned with letters from Mount Idaho, one letter dated 7 and the other 8 A.M. the same morning.<br>
<br>
These letters gave detailed accounts of massacres already begun. Captain Perry's (F) and Trimble's (H) companies of First Cavalry, that were by my direction already being prepared from first report of outbreak these being the only cavalry within reach for the emergency were dispatched without delay to the scenes of the disturbance.  They numbered 99 men.  As Captain Perry had no officer with his company, unless he took the post Quartermaster, Lieutenant Bomus, I detailed Lieutenant Theller, 21st Infantry, to his command.<br>
<br>
The troops marched all night, found the Indians gone from Cottonwood, so proceeded on to Grangville, and thence, after an hour's rest, through the next night to the head of White Bird Canyon.  Having made a forced march of upwards of 70 miles, with
the loss of two night's sleep, they came in sight of the Indian camp, a few miles below the canyon.<br>
<br>
Assisted by eleven volunteers from Mount Idaho, Captain Perry proceeds at once to assault the Indians, that everybody expects are hastening with all speed to cross the Salmon.  Unexpectedly the assault was not successful.  The Indians turn the left flank of the command, and with more than double Perry's numbers force him to retire from his position and return fighting all the way to Grangeville.<br>
<br>
His losses are 33 enlisted men and one commissioned officer, Lieutenant Theller, killed (2 wounded).  The battle occurred, as I have indicated, the 17th of June.  I refer to Captain Perry,s report for a detailed account of the engagement.  More than twenty people on Camas Prairie, White Bird Canyon, and vicinity, have been reported as murdered, accompanied in several cases with horrible outrage, so that the terror and excitement in the whole community were extreme.<br>
<br>
This precipitated the encounter, and I have only high commendation for the conduct of Captain Perry and his officers for an effort that deserved better results.  He remained with his remnant at Grangeville till re-enforced and re-supplied.   Meantime at 5 P.M., 15 June, I start my aid-de-camp, Lieutenant M.C. Wilkinson, to telegraph orders from Walla Walla, W.T., and to send dispatches to Wallowa by messenger, so as to concentrate at Lewiston a sufficient force to make the effort successful beyond doubt against the treacherous bands now combined."<br>
<br>
Upon arrival of Lieutenant Wilkinson in Walla Walla, action was immediately initiated by Walla Walla citizens to organize a volunteer company of Militia to go to the assistance of General Howard.  This participation by Washington Territorial Militia can best be told by a letter written by one of the members of this company Mr. W.S. Clark which was written on 21 September 1877 from notes which he made at the time:<br>
<br>
*          *          *           *           *           *<br>
<br>
"On the morning of 19 June 1877, a courier reached the city of Walla Walla, bringing the sad news of the engagement on Camas Prairie between the Nez Perce Indians and Captain (Brevet Colonel) Perry's troop of cavalry, in which one half Perry's troops were killed.  The news caused a great deal of excitement. Word also came that the citizens of Lewiston were in danger of a raid by the Indians and that the settlers were pouring into town from all sides and help was much needed.<br>
<br>
"Thos. P. Page, county auditor of Walla Walla County, started to work raising a volunteer company.  At one-o'clock in the afternoon a meeting was called at the Court House, where the facts were presented and resolutions were passed promising to go to the aid of the people of the Lewiston district.  One hundred
names were soon down on the roll and all who could get horses were to start that night.  The quartermaster at the fort gave us rifles and six rounds of cartridges apiece.  At six o'clock that evening the following party left Walla Walla enroute to Lewiston:<br>
Thos. P. Page, Captain        Albert Hall     Alex O'Dell<br>
L.K. Grimm, First Lieut.      Jake Holbrook     E.S. Robinson<br>
John F. McLean, Sergeant      Frank Jackson     J.S. Scott<br>
A. Reeves Ayers               John Keeney     Ben. Scott<br>
John Agu                      J.H. Lister     Albert Small<br>
lke Abbott                    Henry Lacy     Frank Johnson<br>
A.L. Bird                     Wm. McKean     Frank Waldrip<br>
Chas. Blewitt                 S.H. Maxon     Thomas Bell<br>
H.E. Holmes                   Lane Gilliam<br>
<br>
"We arrived at Dayton at one o'clock that night and put our horses in the livery stable and ourselves to sleep in the haymow overhead.  Next morning we breakfasted at the hotel.  A.R. Ayres, H.E. Holmes and Tom Bell were missing.  We travelled on to Maringo where a short stop was made and the troops under Col. Whipple came up.  We volunteers took the Indian trail across the hills, the regulars followed the wagon road.  We stopped two hours on the Pataha and then travelled on to Don Favon's ranch, which was about fifteen miles this side of Lewiston.  Here we waited about three hours for supper, there being some misunderstanding about it.  The troops camped at the same place.<br>
<br>
"On the morning of the 21st, after paying our bills, we travelled on to Lewiston.  Leaving our horses on this side of the river we crossed over to the town where we met Major Spurgeon, the commander of that place, who gave us to understand that the settlers nearby were in no immediate danger and that, if we cared to go on into the Indian country, we could be of good service, but would have to be under the command of the Military authorities.<br>
<br>
We re-crossed the river to our horses, got dinner and signed our names to report to General Howard for eight day's service.  We then elected our officers as follows:  T.P. Page, Captain, L.K. Grimm, Lieutenant and John F. McLean, Sergeant.  We again crossed over to Lewiston, this time with our outfits, and were regularly mustered in for eight day's of service.  Up to this time Ayres, Holmes and Bell had not caught up with us.  Some thought that they had backed out and gone home, others that they would come up yet.<br>
<br>
"Major Spurgeon directed us to Fort Lapwai to report to General Howard, where we arrived at six o'clock in the evening.  Here we had supper and, after drawing of the post commissary for rations, retired.  It rained on us all that night.  The morning of the 22nd we spent in repairing and fixing up our outfits.  At one o'clock we were again on the march as General Howard's guard, the
troops going in advance.  There were three companies of infantry, two of cavalry, one company of artillery and our little company of volunteers.<br>
<br>
"As we were starting off from camp we were surprised as well as pleased to see Doc. Ayres, Doc. Holmes and Ike Abbott coming up. They were forgiven on our learning that they had got lost, being led astray by Bell, whose horse gave out, and then he went back home.  They joined us in the march without waiting to secure any dinner.  While we were going up Craig Mountain, Ike Abbott's horse got away from him and he did not catch him for several hours.<br>
<br>
On the evening of the 22nd, we made camp on the Craig Mountain, putting our horses out with those belonging to the troops and Sergeant McLean detailed J.H. Lister, Frank Waldrip and myself on guard the first part of the night and Lane Gilliam, A.L. Bird and Frank Jackson for the latter part.  This was our first guard duty.  I thought that night that upon me rested the entire burden of herding those three hundred head of horses.<br>
<br>
"On Saturday, 23 June, we started early and travelled along the mountain until after noon, when we reached the great Camas prairie.  We passed the place where our former citizen, Lew Day was first attacked by the Indians, and we later came to Ben Norton's place on the Cottonwood, where we camped.  Owing to the fact that we were in advance of the command, Captain Page put a guard on the house and barn.<br>
<br>
I was very much surprised to see the extent and richness of the prairie.  I am told that timothy hay will grow anywhere on the prairie.  Captain Page had placed Henry Lacy as guard over the barns and, after the command came up, Captain Wilkinson started to enter the barn and Henry stopped him.  The Captain told Henry who he was, still it did not do any good and the Captain turned and went off.  Henry and Charley Blewitt were the youngest members in the Company.<br>
<br>
On Sunday morning, 24 June, Aleck O'Dell, Lane Gilliam, Al Hull, Jake Holbrook, Ben Scott, Ike Abbott, Wm. McKean and myself got up early and started for Mount Idaho, nineteen miles distant.  We passed the place where Norton and his family, Joe Moore and Miss Bowers were overtaken by the Indians, who wounded various members of the party and killed their horses.  We also saw the place where the load of goods for Mount Idaho had been captured by the Indians.  We passed through Grangeville and on to Mount Idaho, where we arrived about twelve o'clock.<br>
<br>
We hitched our horses to the fence of a man by the name of Aram and he gave them some hay. Mr. Brown of the hotel told us that dinner would be at four o'clock.  We told him we were hungry and couldn't wait, He wasn't long in getting us something to eat.<br>
<br>
"During our stay here, O'Dell and one or two others had their
horses shod.  I went to Volmer's store and wrote a letter home. Mr. Scott, the manager of the store, showed us many courtesies. He and Mr. Volmer were formerly from Walla Walla.  Mr. Scott said that all who could were preparing to leave for Salmon River.  Mr. Aram invited us all into dinner, which invitation we gladly accepted.  Here we received the following information in regard to the depredations of the Indians.<br>
<br>
Joseph's band from the Wallowa and the Salmon River Indians, under White Bird, had been camped on Rocky Canyon, eight miles from Mount Idaho.  The Indians attacked on Thursday, 14 June.  Jack Manual was living there with his wife and baby.  The baby was killed and Mrs. Manual, after being horribly mistreated, was locked up in a room of their house and then the house was burned to the ground.  James Baker, who lived one mile below Manual's place on White Bird was killed.  Samuel Benedict was killed but his wife and little girl came into town safely.  H.C. Brown was shot in the shoulder and escaped in a boat and was later found by the cavalry.<br>
<br>
Harry Mason was killed but his sister escaped in the brush.  Wm. Osborne was killed on Salmon River.  Those killed on John Day's Creek were Henry Elfreys and his nephew, Robert Bland, Dick Divine and two Frenchmen.  The Elfreys were killed by the Indians with their own guns, which they had secured while the settlers were at work in the field.<br>
<br>
"The settlers on Camas prairie shared a similar fate.  According to Mr. Scott, Lew Day left Mount Idaho to place the settlers on the prairie on guard and give notice to the troops at Lapwai.  The Indians overtook Day two miles from Norton's house.  They immediately fired on him hitting him twice in the back.  Lew turned and went back to Norton's place and found Norton and his wife and boy.  Joe Moore, Miss Bowers, Mr. and Mrs. Chamberlain and their child, and Lew Day all got into the wagon and started for town, the Indians following and firing on them.<br>
<br>
Four miles the other side of Grangeville the parties all got out of the wagon and Hill Norton and Miss Bowers made their escape and came into Grangeville, bringing the first news of the slaughter.  The team of horses had been shot when they got out of the wagon. Morton was killed, Joe Moore had been hit twice.  Mrs. Norton had been shot through both legs.  The Chamberlains and their child were killed, the child's head being split open with a hatchet. Mrs Chamberlain was shot in the breast with an arrow.  Theodore Swartz was wounded.<br>
<br>
"We started to camp at six o'clock that evening and arrived at nine.  On Monday, 25 June, we left our camp on the Cottowood and continued our march to Johnson's camp or ranch, where we camped. On the road we passed the place where about one hundred lodges of Indians had been encamped at the lakes, on the rocks, in the canyons and on the prairie, before the outbreak.  Over the ground of Col. Perry's retreat, Captain Page picked up some twenty
cartridge shells within a distance of fifty yards.<br>
<br>
At Johnson's we were given a camping ground to the right of the main column, about half a mile from wood and water.  The boys were dissatisfied and we got permission to camp within the inclosure at Johnson's house.  H.E. Holmes, Ike Abbott and C.S. Robinson were put on guard.<br>
<br>
"After breakfast on Tuesday morning we left camp to reconnoiter. We were in advance of the command that day.  In our reconnoitering we came across a dead soldier about two miles from camp.  Here we rested to give the infantry time to come up.  We reached the summit looking down on White Bird Canyon about twelve o' clock.  During this morning's ride most of the soldiers killed in Col. Perry's fight with the Indians were buried.  For several miles we kept coming upon dead bodies.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, with Chapman as guide, we rode along the top of the divide between Salmon River and White Bird.  It was rough and tiresome riding.  We saw fresh tracks and Chapman told us we were liable to meet Indians anywhere.  Presently we discovered three Indian spies across the river, and, soon after we saw the whole band moving further up the mountain.  We fired a number of shots toward them but they were too far away and we were only wasting our cartridges.<br>
<br>
"Next we left the ridge and went down to the bottom at Manual's on White Bird.  We went inside the gate and looked at the ruins of the fire.  A few of the soldiers strayed down to the creek and what was their surprise to see, sitting in a little shed which the Indians had spared, a white man whom we all soon found to be Jack Manual, whom we had reported as among the killed.  He had been wounded in the back of the neck with an arrow and had also been shot in the hips.  Our next task was to get him out and away to safety.<br>
<br>
We soon fixed a pole in a broken buggy that was standing near and by fastening what spare ropes we had to the buggy and to the pommels of our saddles, we succeeded in getting him away.  Finding we were not making headway fast enough, our Captain sent to Captain Miller for two pack mules which we soon had.  Then, making the pole into shafts, we soon got to camp, where we turned Mr. Manual over to his friends, who were to take him to Mount Idaho the next day.  It had rained all day and we had a hard day's work.<br>
<br>
"On 27 June, we broke camp and marched to White Bird, the soldiers burying those they had not had time to bury the previous day.  It was here on the White Bird side of the divide that the terrible battle had taken place.  That night we were within a short distance of the Salmon River, which we intended to cross the following day to fight the Indians on the other side.  We could see them for hours that afternoon riding their horses and swinging from side to side in all kinds of capers.  
After making camp, we got instructions to escort the pack train back to Lewiston, where they were going for supplies.  On reaching Lewiston, the eight days for which we had enlisted were up and, believing that the army of General Howard was fully able to meet and conquer Chief Joseph and his bands, we returned to our homes.<br>
<br>
Almost the day after our return came word of the ambushing of Lieutenant Rains and a dozen volunteers, of the regulars, and the killing of Blewitt and Foster.  The troops had known that the Indians were in the vicinity and the Lieutenant ca]led for volunteers to go out and hunt for Blewitt and Foster, who had gone out earlier in the day and had failed to return as they had been ordered to do.  The Lieut. and his volunteers had not been gone long before a volley was heard and, on tracing them up, they found that they had all been killed from ambush at the one volley.<br>
<br>
Foster had been killed earlier near the road at the entrance of the prairie.  Blewitt had been killed a little later further around the mountain, undoubtedly after a run for his life."<br>

<br>
General O.O. Howard's report, continued:<br>
<br>
"Friday, 22 June, having assembled at Lapwai, Whipple's (L) and Winter's (E) companies of Cavalry, that had marched over 200 miles in six days, Pollock's (D), Eltonhead's (I), Miles' (E), Jocelyn's (B), Haughey's (H) companies of Twenty first Infantry, and Miller's (E), Fourth Artillery, armed as Infantry, making an effective force for the field of 227 men, I deemed it best to take the field at once in person, so as to operate carefully till the remainder of my troops could be concentrated and brought up.<br>
<br>
From the direction the Indians were taking, and from information, I saw the necessity of interposing some force between the renegade Nez Perces and the Weiser Indians.  This was done by organizing a force at Boise City under Major Green, 1st Cavalry, and moving it to the Weiser River.  He was to draw his forces from Boise and Harney and looked to General McDowell for re-
enforcement from the military division.<br>
<br>
Bendire's Company (K), First Cavalry was sent direct to Camp Harney to the Weiser country and was in position on the 29th of June, in season to effect the object desired.  The other troops of which I shall hereafter speak, three companies of cavalry and three of infantry, were more slowly brought together from great distances, so that Green did not commence his northward march from Boise until the 1Oth of July.  My immediate command arrives at Norton's ranch, 43 miles the 23rd of June.  The 24th I send Trimble's small company to re-enforce a few citizen families that
were protecting themselves on State Creek by a temporary barri-
cade.<br>
<br>
I hoped that this post at State Creek would check the Indians in that direction, serve to occupy their attention, preventing further outrages there and beyond, while I was moving on them more directly.<br>
<br>
The 25th I moved my command by two routes to Johnson's ranch, some 4 miles from the head of White Bird Canyon.  The 26th with my whole force I make a reconnaissance into the canyon and beyond Captain Perry's battlefield.<br>
<br>
Captain Page, with some twenty volunteers from Walla Walla (Washington Territorial Militia) that had joined me at Lapwai, moved along the crest of the mountain-ridge on the right of White Bird Canyon, till he came in sight of the country beyond the Salmon.  He discovered and reported the enemy in force.  After burying the dead found on the battle-field (Perry's) and in the ravines leading to the rear, we returned to camp.<br>
<br>
June 27th and 28th marched to the crossing of the Salmon, about a mile and a half above the mouth of White Bird.  The second force, Throckmorton's M, Rodney's D, Bancroft's A, and Morris' G companies of 4th Artillery, and Burton's C company of 21st Infantry, collected at Lapwai, here joined the advance, making in all an effective force of 400 men.  In the afternoon Indians charged to the River, a brief skirmish ensued, after which they left the valley for the heights beyond.<br>
<br>
The 29th, Lieutenant Miller, First Cavalry, is sent with trains to Lapwai for supplies, and is escorted by Captain Perry's command and Page's volunteer militia returning home.  The Salmon River is at this time high and the current very swift, so that it takes all day of July 1st to cross the command.  Captain Trimble gets over opposite his position at State Creek.  The evening of the 29th, positive information is obtained that Looking Glass, who, with his people, had stood aloof from the hostilities, had been furnishing re-enforcements to them of at least twenty warriors, and that he proposed to join them in person with all his people, the first available opportunity.<br>
<br>
His grounds for cultivation lay near the mouth of the south fork of the Clearwater, supposed to be about 40 miles from our present position.  With a view of preventing the completion of this treachery, I sent Captain Whipple, commanding his own and Winter's companies, and the Gatling guns, with instructions to make a forced march, surprise and capture the Chief and all that belonged to him.<br>
<br>
Captain Whipple made the march, finding it at least 10 miles longer than anticipated, and did not make the attack until next morning.  With a short parley and a brisk skirmish the Indians escaped.  Between six and seven hundred ponies were captured and
the Indian lodges destroyed.  The loss of the ponies and the attack unfortunately had the effect to give prompt re-enforcement to those who were fighting and caused me some disappointment.<br>
<br>
Whipple's command the evening of the 1st of July reached Grangeville, where he received an order from me to march to Norton's Ranch, on the Cottonwood, where Captain Perry's company, returning with supplies was to join him the 3rd.<br>
<br>
The object of this movement was to meet the enemy and hold him in check should he anywhere attempt to recross the Salmon and turn upon my communications, which he probably would do as soon as I crossed and pursued him, since the report of Bendire's position kept him from going south, while my troops and those at State Creek hindered a return on the front and left.<br>
<br>
The 2nd of July we ascended the mountains after forming junction with Captain Trimble's command, now consisting of his own company and McConnville's twenty volunteers.  <B>A</B><B>nother small company of mounted volunteers under Captain Hunter had joine</B><B>d me from the vicinity of Dayton. W.T. (Washington Territorial Militia).</B>  The ascent was by a blind trail, exceedingly steep and difficult, and rendering a march of not more than ten miles equivalent to three times as much on an ordinary road.<br>
<br>
A heavy rain followed by thick clouds so impeded the command that several mules were killed by rolling down the mountains, and the greater part of two days spent in making the descent.  Several caches of Indian supplies were found half way up and destroyed. Abundant Indian trails showed which way the enemy had gone, viz, to our right.  The first destination, whether by canoe encampment to Snake country, or to one of the lower crossings of the Salmon, is yet uncertain.  Besides finishing the march of the 3rd of July, a reconnaissance is made by Lieut. Fletcher, my aide-de-
camp, for ten miles.<br>
<br>
The 4th we reached the vicinity of Rocky Canyon.  Here news is brought me that the enemy, probably part of his force joining Looking Glass, had recrossed the Salmon and turned back, crossing my communications beyond Norton's; that Captain Whipple had sent Lieutenant Rains and ten men in advance of his own reconnaissance on the 3rd; that Rains, with ten brave men, had been ambushed and all killed; that there was also fighting on this day when the couriers left.<br>
<br>
I sent Hunter's and McConnville's volunteers immediately by the way of Rocky Canyon to reinforce Whipple's, now Perry's command; the latter having reached Cottonwood one day later than expected.<br>
<br>
Captain Whipple had made a prompt and gallant movement toward Lapwai, succeeded in bringing in the supplies with Perry's escort in safety, though surrounded by 300 Indians.  It was the next day after the arrival of Captain Perry that 17 citizens (Volunteer Militia), having started on their own accord from Mount Idaho to
re-enforce the cavalry, were attacked by the Indians enroute. Losing their Captain and several men killed and wounded, not far from Norton's.<br>
<br>
Complaint was made that our troops were slow getting to their rescue.  Captain Perry, whose gallantry at the White Bird battle is undenied, has demanded a court of inquiry.  I shall receive the official reports and the investigation of the court, and will forward them as the best record and judgment.  I may say, however, that reasonable caution under the circumstances, in the presence of a superior force of the enemy, was to be expected.<br>
<br>
The reason I did not cross my whole force immediately at Rocky Canyon was that I believed from reports that the enemy was making only a raid, and that his main camp, with women, children and plunder, was yet on or near the Snake River.  Therefore, I deemed it best, with my foot-men and Trimble's company, to pursue his main trail.<br>
<br>
The 5th of July brought us to Craig's Ferry, where it became evident that all the Indians had passed back and taken the trail toward the Cottonwood, 16 miles distant.  At first I had hoped by a prompt crossing to join Perry and throw my whole force upon the enemy before he could reach the Clearwater or pass my front to Wallowa, if such were his intention; but having no boats, a raft had been constructed from the timber of a cabin near the ferry.<br>
<br>
Our first attempt the morning of the 6th to cross the river, here a perfect torrent, lost our raft, which tumbled down the rapids at a swift rate, with all on board, for three or four miles.<br>
<br>
About this time by Indian couriers, I ascertained that the enemy had already passed from the Cottonwood to the Clearwater, so that my shortest line was to turn back via White Bird Canyon.  That evening we again ascended the mountain, making six miles by dark.<br>
<br>
The evening of the 8th my head of column had reached Grangeville. Here McConville, who after a visit to Norton's had escorted the wounded volunteers to Mount Idaho, had reorganized by forming a battalion consisting of his own, Hunters and Mount Idaho companies (all Militia).  He proposed to me in writing to make a reconnaissance in force toward Kamiah, and now made his report.<br>
<br>
He said:  "We occupy a strong position six miles from Kamiah, on a hill, where we can see the enemy near the Clearwater, three or four miles further from Kamiah."<br>
<br>
I resolved upon this information to take Whipple's route to Looking Glass's camp via Jackson's bridge, with the hope of taking the enemy in reverse.<br>
<br>
About twenty volunteers were sent directly to McConville, and he
was urged to hold steadily where he was until I could get into position.  This he did until the 11th of July, when the volunteers left their positions and went to Mount Idaho.<br>
<br>
The 9th of July (the cavalry from Norton's having joined us the night before) I proceeded four miles beyond Jackson's bridge, and here waited one day for the infantry and artillery, a portion of which was still enroute from the Salmon.  Several companies of Miller's and Mile's battalions made a march from the evening of the 9th to the evening of the 1Oth of 38 miles, without halt, being assisted in part by a few wagons, and re-joined me.<br>
<br>
The next day, the 11th, we marched from this camp at 7 A.M., following the ridge between the forks of the Clearwater.<br>
<br>
About 12 o'clock, my aid-de-camp, Lieutenant Fletcher, discovers the enemy in a deep ravine near mouth of Cottonwood Creek.<br>
<br>
Numbers of horses and a few Indians are seen.  I sent Captain Trimble's company accompanied by my aid-de-camp, to watch the front and right, while I ride to the bluff at the left, and saw plainly the hostiles, who judging from their motions, had just discovered our approach.<br>
<br>
By one o'clock a howitzer, maneuvered by Lieutenant Otis, Fourth Artillery, and two Gatling guns were firing toward the masses of Indians below.  They were running their horses up the South Fork on both banks near the river, and driving their stock as far as possible beyond our range.  In ten minutes it was impossible to reach them longer, owing to the craggy mountain shores back of and close to the river border.<br>
<br>
My guide, Mr. Chapman, assures me that they can escape only by a canyon on my left, which makes a small angle with the river and leads towards my rear.<br>
<br>
The next bluff in that direction was beyond a deep and rocky transverse ravine perpendicular to this canyon, I instantly ordered my howitzer battery and Gatling guns, supported by Winter's cavalry, to go thither with full speed.<br>
<br>
Around the head of the ravine our distance was over a mile, the enemy having less than a third to go, so we found them dismounted and in position already on our approach, beyond the second bluff, while some thirty or forty mounted Indians galloped just beyond range to compass my left.  For a few minutes I feared the result of this attempt, when just in time, Major Mason, Twenty-first Infantry, department inspector general, appeared close by with Burton's company of infantry, having anticipated my order (at every juncture Major Mason thus has supplemented my efforts).<br>
<br>
This company deploying on the right enabled Winters to take care
of the left.  Firing now become brisk.  My line was extended to the left by the cavalry and to the right by the infantry and artillery battalions, gradually refusing my flanks until the whole was enveloped.  Four hundred men held a line of two and a half miles in extent.  My main pack-train had passed by this position.  A small train with a few supplies was on the road nearer us.<br>
<br>
The Indian flankers by their rapid movement struck the rear of the small train, killed two of the packers, and disabled a couple of mules loaded with howitzer ammunition.  The prompt fire from Perry's and Whipple's cavalry saved the ammunition from capture. I had previously sent an orderly to conduct the trains within my lines; the fierce onset of the Indians requiring greater haste, Lieut. Wilkinson, aid-de-camp, being sent, brought in the trains under cover of Rodney's artillery and Trimble's cavalry companies.<br>
<br>
The enemy manifests extraordinary boldness, planting sharp-
shooters at available points, making charges on foot and horseback with all manner of savage demonstrations.  These attempts are successfully resisted at every part of the line.<br>
<br>
At 3:30 P.M., a spirited counter-charge is made on the right, down into the ravine, by Companies H (Haughey's), D (Pollock's), E (Mile's), and B (Jocelyn's), Twenty first Infantry; A and part of E, Fourth Artillery, participating.  Captain Miles, commanding the infantry battalion, supported by Captain Miller's artillery battalion led in this charge.  Captain Bancroft, Fourth Artillery, and Lieutenant Williams, Twenty-first Infantry, were wounded about this time.  A number of Indians were killed and several wounded in this charge, and the ravine cleared.<br>
<br>
Captain Miller a little later led a second charge near the center, Burton, Haughey, Elsonhead, and Winters with their companies participating.  Lieutenant Wilkinson, aid-de-camp, by my direction, meanwhile led a demonstration on the right, using artillery and infantry and every available man from cavalry, horseholders, orderlies, extra-duty men, and train.  Lieutenant Fletcher, acting aid-de-camp, also using a howitzer at this and at several other times during the battle, did effective service by lodging shells within the enemy's barricade.<br>
<br>
Miller's charge gained the ridge in front and secured the disputed ravine near Winter's left.  Further spasmodic charges on the left by the enemy were repelled by Perry's and Whipple's cavalry, dismounted, and Morris' artillery, Company G.  Yet a few Indian sharpshooters managed to so annoy every man who approached the spring, our water supply, that in spite of our successful charges, matters were not very bright at dark.  During the night stone barricades and rifle pits were constructed by ourselves and the enemy.  At daylight the 12th, every available man was on the line.<br>

I directed that food should be cooked and coffee made at the center and front, but we had first to get complete possession of our spring, as sufficient water was not secured in the night. This was executed by Captains Miller and Perry, using Lieutenant Otis' battery supported by Rodney's company.  The sharpshooters were driven from their hiding places and the spring secured against re-capture.  As soon as every man had been provided with food, I directed the Artillery battalion be withdrawn entirely from the lines, thin though they were already, and the lines be held by the infantry and artillery battalions.<br>
<br>
It may be remembered that the number of Indian warriors and the number of men I could put on the line were about equal, owing to the fact that with us a large number are necessarily absorbed in holding the horses and in performing extra duty.<br>
Captain Miller withdrew his battalion about 2:30 P.M. (the time I had selected), and was preparing to execute his movement, viz, to push out by the left flank, piercing the enemy's line just left of center, cross his barricaded ravine, then face suddenly to the right and charge, striking the Indians position in reverse, assisting himself by a howitzer.<br>
<br>
As he was about to move, a dust appeared in the distance beyond the position.  Our glasses revealed it as an unexpected supply train, escorted by Capt. Jackson's Company B, of the First Cavalry.  Immediately the artillery battalion is sent to meet the new comers.  With a little skirmishing and delay of an hour, the train was brought in, in safety.<br>
<br>
Major Keeler, of General McDowell's staff, accompanies the escort and brings us cheering words from his general.  His subsequent generous aid will not be forgotten.<br>
<br>
Then at once Captain Miller, instead of returning to our position with the train is marching slowly in column by the right flank towards us; when just at the right point he faces quickly to the left, moves steadily for nearly a mile across our front, and charges the enemy's position.  The usual attempt to double his left is made by the Indians, when a reserved company (Rodney's) in Miller's rear deploys and flanks the flankers.  For a few minutes there is stubborn resistance at the enemy's barricades.  Then the whole line gives way.<br>
<br>
Immediately the pursuit is taken up by the infantry and artillery and Winter's cavalry company, dismounted, and the remaining cavalry as soon as they can saddle and mount.  Capt. Jackson's company, just arrived, followed the Gatling gun in support at a trot as far as the bluff overlooking the river.  The howitzers are brought to the same point with Trimble's company and shot and shell poured into the retreating masses of Indians and ponies.<br>
<br>
They are closely pursued through the ravines into the deep canyon, thence to the river, over rocks, down precipices, and
along trails almost too steep and craggy to traverse.  The footmen pursued them to the river opposite the Indian camp.  The river being too deep and rapid for the men to ford, they here waited for the cavalry under Captain Perry.<br>
<br>
The cavalry worked its way as rapidly as it could from its position on the left down the rugged mountain steeps to the deep ford, and crossed slowly into the Indian camp, and was strongly posted beyond it while the Gatling guns and howitzers, near which I was observing, were doing their best to reach the Indians, who were fleeing in every direction up the heights to the left of Cottonwood Creek and beyond the Clearwater.<br>
<br>
At this time (about 5 P.M.), I was following up the movement, descending a steep trail, when about half way down the mountain side I discovered a number of warriors apparently returning toward their camp from the Cottonwood ravine, at least 3 miles from us.  I warned Captain Perry, and directed him to immediately carry over the foot men with his horses.<br>
<br>
While doing this, time was consumed, and the Indians had turned eastward, crossed the Cottonwood Canyon, and under cover of a transverse ravine got well in advance of us, so that I concluded to postpone further pursuit until the next morning.<br>
<br>
The Indian camp abandoned in haste had their lodges still standing filled with their effects, blankets, buffalo robes, cooking utensils (food cooking on the fire), flour, jerked beef, and plunder of all descriptions.  The wounded and dead horses showed that our artillery had reached their camp.  I reported at the time fifteen Indians killed and a large number wounded.<br>
<br>
After that, 8 dead were found on the trail, of those who died from mortal wounds, making for this battle 23 warriors killed; and there were at least twice that many wounded.  Twenty-three prisoners, warriors, and 17 women and children were subsequently secured in pursuit.  Our loss was 2 officers and 22 enlisted men wounded and 13 killed.<br>
I have denominated this battle of the 11th and 12th July as the "BATTLE OF THE FORK OF THE CLEARWATER."  The Nez Perces fought with the utmost obstinacy.  Their numbers were about 300 warriors, aided by their women, who formed for them a substantial reserve.  My force engaged amounted, in effective, to 400.  The conduct of our troops, officers and men, during this battle, could not have been better.  No man was seen to leave his post of duty from alarm, and the movements were spirited and confident throughout.<br>
<br>
The 13th, as soon as the battery could be brought down from the trail where it was obstructed and left at dark the night before, the pursuit was resumed by all the troops, except Winter's company, which was to finish burying the dead and escort the wounded to Grangeville.  As soon as we reach the heights above
Kamiah, we see that the enemy's families, their stock and effects, are mostly across the Clearwater, about a mile above the ferry.<br>
<br>
We press down the trail as rapidly as possible, and move the advance in two columns at a trot to the place of the crossing, Captain Jackson's leading on the left road, and the rest of the cavalry on the right.  When Jackson reached the river, the last warrior had gotten over and well up the other bank.<br>
<br>
The Gatling guns and musketry were used profusely from our side, but with little apparent effect, except to increase the rapidity of the enemy's retreat.  As Perry's and Whipple's cavalry were passing a high bluff, which was beyond the river, a brisk fire was opened by the enemy for a few minutes, throwing this cavalry into considerable confusion for a time, but without loss.<br>
<br>
We learned that the enemy had intended from behind barricades and natural cover to meet us near the river, but our resolute and rapid approach, after their defeat the day before, they could not withstand; so they jumped upon their skin rafts, already overloaded, and swam over, occasioning the loss of many of the supplies which their women saved and brought off from their camp the day before.  One enlisted man, only, slightly wounded in the skirmish at the river.<br>
<br>
The 14th was spent in reconnoitering.  The 15th I started a column of cavalry with intention of ascending the heights to the rear, as if enroute to Lapwai, to move 20 miles down the Clearwater to Dunnwell's Ferry, and crossing there, to attempt to gain the trail to the rear of the Indians, as they were encamping in plain sight, not more than four miles from Kamiah.  I had not proceeded more than 6 miles before the Indians began their retreat in good earnest along the Lo Lo Trail.  Therefore, leaving Captain Jackson with his company and a few volunteers who had just returned to me, to watch Dunnwell's Ferry, I returned to Kamiah and prepared at once to move my entire command over the river.<br>
<br>
My own return was hastened by a request, said to be sent in from Joseph, asking on what terms he could surrender.  While I was talking with his messenger, not far from the river, a shot was fired from the enemy upon our picket nearby.  The messenger himself and family and some others subsequently surrendered, but not Joseph.<br>
<br>
It was doubtless a ruse to delay our movements, but it did not affect them.<br>
<br>
The l7th I sent Major Mason, of my staff, in command of the cavalry, Indian Scouts, and McConville's volunteers, to pursue the hostiles for two marches.  The trail is exceedingly difficult, and passes mostly over wooded mountains, the woods bring filled with fallen timber.  This enables the Indians to
form ambuscades with ease.  Major Mason followed the enemy to within 3 miles of Oro Fino Creek; his scouts ran into the enemy's rear guard.  Three of them were disarmed, and 1 wounded and 1 killed.  One of the enemy was killed and two pack animals captured.<br>
<br>
Having accomplished, as he believed, the object of his movement, and finding the trail unfit for action with cavalry, where a small rear guard could easily throw them into confusion, he concluded it wise to return, so that, at 8 A.M., the 18th, the pursuing column returned to Kamiah.  This really ended the campaign within the limits of my Department.<br>
<br>
I count some of the results as follows:<br>
<br>
First.     From Perry's battle, 17 June, all murders of citizens by the Indians immediately cease, their attention being fully occupied by the troops.<br>
<br>
Second.     The hostiles are kept in constant motion.  They are prevented from going southward; forced from the country between the Salmon and the Snake; their treacherous allies under Looking Glass defeated, and lodges destroyed, and 600 ponies captured.<br>
<br>
Third.     They are anticipated in their plans at Cottonwood, met by troops at every point, and finally, by our forced marching on inner lines, brought to battle and defeated with loss.<br>
<br>
Fourth.     They are then immediately pursued, and faintly attempt to make a stand at Kamiah, on our side of the river, but again are driven, with loss of provisions and morale.<br>
<br>
Fifth.     They are then pressed beyond the river along the Lo Lo Trail, their fighting force having been reduced at least one-third, till it is certain that the main body of the murderous hostiles have departed for the "buffalo country" and the Department of the Columbia freed from their presence.<br>
<br>
This completes the first period of the campaign against the hostile Nez Perces.<br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
<br>
CAMPAIGN WITHOUT THE DEPARTMENT<br>

My first plan, which I commenced the morning of 19 July to execute, was to leave a small garrison at Kamiah, proceed with my fighting force by the way of Mullan Road to Missoula, Montana, picking up twenty-days supplies at Lewiston, enroute.  I believed that Major Green with his Boise force would arrive within a week, and sufficiently guard Camas Prairie and neighboring country against any small scouting parties that the hostiles might have left behind, and I knew, further, that Colonel Wheaton's regiment (Second Infantry) would reach Lewiston in season to keep everything quiet to the north and west among the discontented renegades of other tribes.<br>
<br>
I was half way to Cold Springs with the cavalry and infantry already there - when messages came to me from Colonel Watkins and Mr. Montieth, the Indian Inspector and agent, that the Indians were burning houses along the north fork of the Clearwater; and from Captain Throckmorton, commanding at Kamiah, that they were threatening his position; a little later from James Sawyer, head chief of the Kamiahs, that several hundred of his people's ponies had been stolen.<br>
<br>
I now know that the alarm was occasioned by a small observing party that had followed our cavalry on its return from the Lo Lo Trail, and that the only mischief done by them was the stealing some of the Kamiah Indian's horses.  But at the time, the excitement was too real to admit of my leaving the vicinity, till Green or Wheaton should arrive.  I moved my command to Croesdale's farm on Camas Prairie, a point about equidistant from Norton's at the Cottonwood, from Rocky Canyon on the Salmon, from Mount Idaho, and from the forks of the Clearwater, and only 16 miles from Kamiah.  Here I awaited gathering in my supplies.<br>
<br>
Having modified my plan, I embodied it in General Field Orders No. 3, as follows:<br>
<br>
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE COLUMBIA, IN THE FIELD<br>
Camp A. Sully, Idaho Territory, 23 July 1877<br>
<br>
GENERAL FIELD ORDERS NO. 3<br>
<br>
I. The hostile Indians, according to the latest information, having retreated via the Lo Lo Trail toward Montana Territory, leaving but a few families, supposably concealed in the rocky fastnesses of the Snake and Salmon Rivers country, it is directed<br>
That two columns and a reserve shall operate as follows:<br>
<br>
A.     The right column, personally commanded by the department commander, consisting of the battalion of artillery under command of Captain Marcus P. Miller, Fourth Artillery, the battalion of Infantry commanded by Captain Evan Miles, Twenty-first Infantry, and a battalion of Cavalry (four companies) under command of Major George B. Sanford.  First Cavalry, will immediately upon the arrival of Major Green's
forces from Boise, enter upon direct pursuit of the Indians over the Lo Lo Trail.  Objective point, Missoula City, Montana.<br>
<br>
B.     The left column, commanded by Colonel Frank Wheaton, Second Infantry, consisting of his force of infantry, increased by a battalion of cavalry to be commanded by Colonel Cuvier Grover, First Cavalry, and composed as follows, viz:  Companies F (Perry's) and H (Trimble's), First Cavalry, and  <B>two companies (200) of Washington Territory Mounted Volunteers,</B> will proceed northward by way of Hangman's Creek and Coeur D'Alene Mission.  Objective point, Missoula City, Montana.  The design of the column will be:<br>
<br>
1.     A cooperation with the right column; frequent communications to be kept up by means of reliable couriers via the reserve column near Mount Idaho.<br>
2.     By overawing malcontent Indians, or occupying their attention to prevent any re-enforcements of the hostile Indians, and should the latter attempt to return through the Coeur D'Alene country, to engage them.<br>
3.     To quiet the fears and apprehensions of the settlers, that they may return to their peaceful pursuits.<br>
4.     A cordial cooperation with the officials of the Interior Department in their endeavor to settle disputes and controversies between so-called friendly Indians and settlers.<br>
<br>
Colonel Wheaton will, as soon as practicable, furnish the commanding officer of Lapwai, Idaho, with a small detachment of ten or fifteen men, and will leave a guard at Lewiston sufficient to protect the main depot.<br>
<br>
Finally, recent indications of a reconcentration of fugitive hostile Indians on the Lo Lo Trail having altered the department commander's original intention of pursuing the northern route in person, he desires that the commander of the left column exercise the greatest caution in the anticipation and prevention of complications tending to cause an increase in allies, either direct or indirect, to those Indians now actually at war.<br>
<br>
C.     The reserve column will be commanded by Major John Green, First Cavalry, and will consist of the troops from Boise, excepting the cavalry designated to accompany the right column, increased by L Company (Whipple's) and E Company (Winter's), First Cavalry, and a body of Warm Springs Indian Scouts.<br>
<br>
     Major Green will locate his main force at or near
Croesdale's farm:  Cottonwood Creek, protecting with at least one company and two pieces of artillery the sub-depot of Kamiah, and maintaining a small outpost at Mount Idaho as a nucleus for the Mount Idaho and Grangeville Volunteer Militia.  He will closely watch, by means of scouting parties and patrols, the crossings of the south fork of the Clearwater River and Salmon River, eg, the forks, Kamiah, Dunnwell's Ferry, etc, on the former, and White Bird Canyon, etc, on the latter.<br>
<br>
The country between the Salmon and Snake Rivers and beyond      the forks of the south fork of the Clearwater River, will be      thoroughly and constantly scoured by scouting parties, its      most hidden recesses probed by the Warm Springs Indians, and      any scouts, little parties, or hiding families left by the      hostile Indians, be captured and brought in.  Major Green      will forward promptly communications between the operating      columns.<br>
<br>
II. The right column will move well across the south fork of the Clearwater River, so as to be ready to take its departure from the Wey-ipe Monday, the 30th instant.  Colonel Wheaton will endeavor to make the movement of the left column northward as nearly simultaneous with the movement of the right column as possible.  It is desireable that any necessary delay in the left column take place as far northward (near the Coeur D'Alene country) as possible.<br>
<br>
Each column will be supplied with 20 day's small rations, and will take with them a herd of as many steers as necessary.  As a general rule forage will not be carried, but will be obtained enroute.<br>
<br>
III. The Lewiston Depot is designated as the main depot for the army in the field.  The general staff will keep it furnished with at least three month's supplies in advance.<br>
<br>
BY COMMAND OF BRIGADIER GENERAL HOWARD:<br>
<br>
R.H. FLETCHER<br>
First Lieutenant, Twenty First<br>
Infantry, Acting Asst. Adj. Gen.<br>
<br>
In execution of this order my movement commences Thursday, 26 July, the first march being to Kamiah.<br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
<br>
The 28th, with McConville's eighteen volunteer militia, while the right column is assembling and crossing the river, I make a personal reconnaissance to the Little Camas Prairie, 11 miles
distant, and find no signs of the families of the hostile Indians suspected to be there.  After this reconnaissance, the volunteers return home.  During my absence Major Sanford, First Cavalry, arrives at Kamiah, with Bendire's (K), Carr's (I) and Wagner's (C) companies (This is the first appearance of Major Green's troops).  The 29th of July is spent in crossing the cavalry and supplies and completing the preparations for the movement over the Lo Lo Trail.<br>
<br>
The 3Oth (Monday), the march beyond the Clearwater commenced.  A heavy and continuous rain renders the mountainous trail slippery and exceedingly difficult.  The trail runs for the most part through pine forests, with thick underbrush and fallen timber. There are occasional openings.  At the Camas Prairie (the Wey-
ipe) there is grazing and good water.  Here we encamp, having made 16 miles.<br>
<br>
During August 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th our way is made through a rough wilderness, for the most part along what is called a "divide", or narrow and winding crest, where we find scarcely grass enough to keep our animals alive.  During the 4th, I am met by two messengers that I had sent ten days before from my camp at Croesdale's farm to Missoula.<br>
<br>
They bear me a message from Captain Rawn, Seventh Infantry, saying that the Indians had been permitted to pass through the Lo Lo Canyon, and were moving slowly up the Bitter Root Valley, and that Colonel Gibbon was expected at Missoula immediately.  This dispatch determines me to divide my command with the hope of forming junction with Gibbons, earlier than I could with the whole.<br>
<br>
August 5th, I march the cavalry 21 miles, camping after dark at another fork of the Clearwater, where there is not a particle of food for the animals.<br>
<br>
Before breakfasting the 6th, the command moves at dawn till grass is reached at Summit Prairie.  After grazing for a few hours, we push on to Hot Springs, where we met a messenger from Colonel Gibbon himself.  He had left Missoula the 4th and was in pursuit of the hostiles.  He wishes, if possible, I get to him a hundred cavalry.  The same night I dispatch two couriers to let Colonel Gibbon know that I am making the longest possible marches with my cavalry, and will press it in person, bringing him two hundred instead of one.<br>
<br>
The 7th from Hot Springs, I send an aid-de-camp ahead to Missoula, to secure forage and other supplies, and have them meet us at the mouth of Lo Lo Fork of the Bitter Root, so that there shall be no delay in the march.  This day the trail is found to be even more trying to the animals than before, but we came at the end of 22 miles out of the timber and mountain trail into excellent grazing.<br>

August 8th, leaving camp at dawn, we soon reach Captain Rawn's fortifications, now vacant, in the Lo Lo Canyon, and are shown by a citizen where the Indians ascended the heights on his right and passed his flank without hinderance.  He had about 25 regular troops, with about two hundred volunteers.<br>
<br>
It seems that the Indians really negotiated their way by promising the citizens that they would do them no harm if permitted to pass by unmolested.  Captain Rawn thought it wiser, under the circumstances, to let them go than attempt a fight, which he feared would be disastrous.  The position was a very strong one, and it is regretted that the Indians could not have been met and driven back on me.<br>
<br>
It was with a hope of such result that I had sent dispatches in advance as soon as the Indians started upon the Lo Lo Trail.  In truth, I should have been in Missoula by the northern route in season had I not been detained by the reports of the return of the hostiles after they had started for Montana.  This day our supplies met us as provided, and we succeeded in making a march upon good roads of 34 miles.<br>
<br>
The 9th we proceeded up the Bitter Root Valley, making a little over 20 miles, the cavalry horses being too weak to go farther. We got word from some citizens returning regarding Gibbon's progress.  He had passed beyond Ross's Hole and was making rapidly in wagons for Big Hole Valley in close pursuit.<br>
<br>
The morning of the 1Oth, feeling very anxious to form a junction with Gibbon or communicate with him, I have twenty of the best horses picked out, five from each company, under command of Lieutenant Bacon, First Cavalry, and take this detachment with the Indian Scouts, 17 in number, as escort, and ride all day from 4 A.M., generally at a trot, making at sundown 53 miles, the last 16 miles was over the Rocky Mountain divide.<br>
<br>
Here I found myself from 15 to 18 miles from Col. Gibbon's position.  Seven volunteers who had left after his battle met us on the road just before we encamped, and have a fearful picture of matters at the front.  They report that Colonel Gibbon had been successful at first in yesterday's battle but that the enemy had rallied and driven him into a dangerous position, taking his artillery, cut off his supplies, and killed and wounded more than half his force, including all of his officers but one, and that he was in distress, without blankets or food or a medical officer.<br>
<br>
I knew that men escaping from the field invariably exaggerate the horrors of a battle, and made due allowance on this account for their stories.  Yet I was intensely anxious for Gibbon's command till I came in sight of it, between nine and ten the next day. His wagons were near his fortified camp, his men were bathing and washing their clothes at the creek, and the horses grazing quietly in the bottom.  There was no sign of an enemy in the
vicinity.  On reaching his position, which was on a wooded point just above the willow bottom, we found Colonel Gibbon himself, but all cheerful and confident as troops are wont to be who have remained in position and slept on the battle field.<br>
<br>
They had saved their supplies at the reserve camp, excepting about 2,000 rounds of ammunition captured while enroute to the front.  After his first successful assault at dawn on the 9th, Colonel Gibbon had withdrawn to this point, and had been very much annoyed by Indian sharpshooters posted in favorable positions above and beyond him, some of them being between him and his supply camp. When in this condition, the evening of the 9th, Sergeant Sutherland, Company B, First Cavalry, whom I had sent from Hot Springs, Lo Lo Trail, reached him and I reported I was coming.<br>
<br>
Colonel Gibbon said this gave them great encouragement and the men cheered.  Ahead of us, during the last 10 or 12 miles, the fresh moccasin tracks of an Indian Scout indicated that the hostiles were apprised of my approach so that though we were not permitted to participate in the battle, which evidently did the Indians much damage, yet our extraordinary marches and early approach were not lost, for the Indians had abandoned their apparent advantage and left Colonel Gibbon's position at eleven o'clock the night before our arrival.<br>
<br>
When I met the seven volunteers from Gibbon's battle, the evening of the 10th, a messenger was immediately dispatched who went back forty miles to order the cavalry forward.  A messenger from Colonel Gibbon's supply camp was sent me by Sergeant Sutherland, who taking another route, passed on by my camp without meeting me.  Major Mason, in charge, sends back to the Infantry, at least two marches away, to hasten forward,and moves on with the cavalry, coming up the afternoon of the 12th.  Colonel Gibbon had also sent a dispatch, begging that a medical officer be sent to him. This dispatch also passed me by enroute.<br>
<br>
Surgeon C.T. Alexander and Assistant Surgeon Fitzgerald being present with the cavalry, made the ride of 53 miles without rest, reaching Gibbon's camp ten hours before the command.  They were thanked by the Colonel for the prompt, effective, and generous aid which they rendered to more than 30 wounded officers and men.<br>
<br>
The next day, the 13th of August, Colonel Gibbon, with the wounded starts for Deer Lodge, detailing to accompany my cavalry, fifty of his command under Captain Browning, Seventh Infantry. Hoping to overtake the enemy before he gets beyond the Big Hole Valley, I engage to permit this company to return home from Bannock City, 60 miles distant.  I march 23 miles and pitch camp, and here I am overtaken by Captain Wells and Lieutenant Humphrey's companies, fifty strong, in wagons.<br>
<br>
A courier arrives from Horse Prairie with the story that eight men had been murdered near the head of the valley the night
before; that the enemy, instead of passing near Bannock City, had left the Big Hole country by a pass to Horse Prairie, farther to the right, called "Bloody Dick Canyon."<br>
<br>
From my full conviction that the Indians were working toward their old haunts in the Buffalo country, and were only deviating to blind our pursuit and get supplies for themselves undisturbed by large settlements, I resolved to head them off by pushing to their left first at some point along the stage-road from Deer Lodge to Corrinne or at Henry Lake; so in that view I determine to continue my march through Bannock.<br>
<br>
Tuesday, the 14th, we march 25 miles.  More messengers arrive from Horse Prairie, bearing a letter from Sheriff Bray.  The Indians left the head of Horse Prairie, bearing to the right, and toward the junction in Lemhi Valley.  A few hostile raiders having secured some 200 horses from Horse Prairie; also some straggling parties were reported as at the head of the prairie and moving as if to return to "Bloody Dick Canyon", and being so near the Indians, I determined to retain Capt. Browning's command a little longer.<br>
<br>
On the 15th, sending Lieutenant Adams, First Cavalry, ahead to secure supplies and forward them to camp, we leave Bannock City a little to our left and march on to Barrett's ranch.  A message from Colonel Shoup of the Volunteers, shows that the Indians have enveloped the temporary fortifications at the junction, Lemhi Valley, which contains some forty people, and that he, himself, with some sixty Bannock volunteer militia had reconnoitered their camp and found them too strong for him.  The Indian camp was situated west of the junction, and Colonel Shoup, with his men, was near Fort Lemhi.<br>
<br>
I was urged by everybody I met from Lemhi and Horse Prairie to go straight to Lemhi and by Col. Shoup to take my way by the fort.  But with the same conviction as ever, I knew that my pursuit of them by a stern chase would be hopeless should I attempt to do this.  Yet, for fear that they might murder more people before leaving Lemhi Valley I agree to try and intercept them by a trail that would put me east of their position.  In the night I was relieved of my embarrassment by another courier, bearing intelligence that the Indians had moved rapidly eastward in the direction of Birch Creek, agreeing with the people of the fortification not to harm them.<br>
<br>
Therefore, on the 16th, I continue my march for the stage-road hoping to reach the point where the Indians will cross it before they can, whether they emerge by Sheep Creek basin or Medicine Lodge.  Two companies of volunteers, Captains Stewart and Clark, had joined me the day before at Horse Prairie.  As I was moving this morning a courier comes up bringing a note from Captain Clark, which states that these companies have resolved to make two day's march into Medicine Lodge Valley and then return home.<br>

I immediately send an aid, Lieut. C.E.S. Wood, to explain my movement, and to show them that theirs will be likely to result as a diversion in favor of the enemy, and request that they move near my right flank, watching all approaches from the right.  They consider the matter, and for some reason return home.  We encamp at Red Rock stage-station.<br>
<br>
On the 17th, the march is continued for 23 miles to Junction Station.  Capt. Browning, with his command, having been detached, sets out for Deer Lodge.  As soon as we are encamped, Major Sanford, commanding the cavalry, selects forty cavalrymen, who had horses in the best condition of any in the battalion, and details Lieut. George R. Bacon, First Cavalry to command them.<br>
<br>
I send this picked force, increased by the Indian scouts under their Captain, Mr. Orlando Robbins, with instructions to set out at midnight, and proceed by Red Rock Lake to Mynhold Pass, near Henry Lake, with a view to intercepting and hindering the Indians should they come in that direction, or of procuring and transmitting to me early information of value.<br>
<br>
This expedition was resolutely undertaken.  While at the junction, another company of volunteers, under Captain Calloway, arrives from Virginia City and go into camp.<br>
<br>
While here I am visited by the superintendent of the stage-road, Mr. Salisbury, who informs me that the stage-line has been interrupted and the Indians have already been seen beyond the Dry Creek Station.  Several citizens, with Mr. Charles Carlton, are sent to Pleasant Valley and beyond to watch the enemy.  During the night another agent of the road, Mr. Pollinger, rides back in haste from Pleasant Valley, bringing an urgent dispatch from Mr. Salisbury as to conditions of things at the front.<br>
<br>
I had not quite determined at this time whether to push my main column down the road with the risk of the Indians getting past me, they having the shorter line, or to send it to Henry Lake by the trail north of the divide.  On the morning of the 18th I delay my command in camp, hoping to give the animals a rest and grazing until three o'clock in the afternoon, but go forward myself to Pleasant Valley.<br>
<br>
While on the road my scouts bring me word that the Indians are in force near Dry Creek Station, and that they all have not crossed the road yet, and that turning off at that station is the best possible road to Henry Lake.  Upon this information I sent for my command at once, and it is moved forward with the utmost rapidity to Dry Creek Station, the rear of the column not getting into camp until 10 P.M. Captain Norwood, with his company L of the Second Cavalry, who had overtaken my command in the morning before it marched, encamped at the same point with us.<br>
<br>
Part of the volunteers returned home from the junction and the remainder came up from Pleasant Valley and stayed there that
night.  Here Lieutenant Benson joins, having been sent forward by Colonel Gibbon with instructions to organize the volunteers and head off the Indians before they shall emerge from Medicine Lodge, but as I had anticipated the movement, and as the majority of the volunteers had already returned home, he asked to be assigned to duty, and was sent as a Lieutenant to Captain Norwood.<br>
<br>
The next day, Sunday, the 19th, we leave the stage-line and take the road to our left, soon coming into a large Indian trail.<br>
<br>
The command makes camp 18 miles distant, just across the Camas meadows, quite early in the afternoon, and take up a very strong natural position on the first elevated ground which overlooks the meadows toward the west and some lava beds toward the north and east.  The cavalry was posted in line of battle covering the camp; the infantry in reserve near the creek, and great pains taken by my Inspector, Major E.C. Mason, Twenty-first Infantry, to cover the camp with pickets in every direction.<br>
<br>
Before night every animal was brought within, the horses tied to the picket ropes, the animals with the few wagons to their wagons and the bellmares of the pack trains were hobbled.  Captain Calloway's volunteers came up and encamped about one hundred yards from me, across a creek.  They are between two streams of water whose banks were fringed by thickets of willows.  Two or three Indians were seen by one of our scouts just before night but as this was an ordinary occurrence, it excited little notice.  An unusual feeling of security pervaded camp.<br>
<br>
My command, with Lieutenant Bacon's detachment, absent, did not at this time exceed in effectiveness one hundred cavalry and fifty infantry.  This was, however, sufficient for any defensive purpose.  The enemy were encamped 16 or 18 miles farther on toward Lake Henry.  They started, as we subsequently learned, be-
fore sunset on Sunday evening, and rode back to our position and worked themselves carefully around our camp, sending into the herd a few skillful men.<br>
<br>
When everything was in readiness a column of fours, so much like one of our companies in movement as to deceive in the night, approached, at a walk; at the picket line along the road, the column is challenged, but not giving satisfactory answer the picket fires; then immediately there is firing from every quarter.  The citizen's camp is near this approach and many of their horses break away.<br>
<br>
All mules between the two creeks are easily stampeded, and a rush is made for the other animals.  Our men quickly dressed and in position.  Our horses at the picket ropes, the mules with Norwood's company, most of the animals at the wagons and at least half the horses of the volunteer company are saved.  The enemy escaped in the darkness with some 150 pack animals and horses.  Though there was considerable firing, some of the bullets
striking the wagons, yet fortunately but one man of the command was hit, and he only slightly wounded.<br>
<br>
In a few minutes, as soon as I was informed of what had resulted, I ordered Major Stanford to have the cavalry saddle up at once and to move out just as soon as it was light enough to see, and attempt to recover the lost animals.  Carr's, Norwood's and Jackson's companies galloped out a few minutes later accompanied by Major Sanford in command.  The moving column of Indians and animals could then just be discovered four or five miles away.  I remained to organize the command against an attack which was still possible.<br>
<br>
The cavalry succeeded in striking the escaping herd, and at first recovered at least half; but many made wild by the charge and firing ran to the enemy.  The Indians had hastily prepared defenses behind some rocks, so as to envelop our head of column at least eight miles from our camp.  As Captain Carr, in the advance, charged upon the Indians who were driving the mules, his company received the sudden fire from this position.  This checked our onward movement.  Norwood and Carr went into position nearly abreast of each other, while Jackson and his company came up on the right.<br>
<br>
Now the skirmish became quite general. Sanford's left was turned and threatened by a considerable force, and, to protect himself, he ordered his men to draw back.  Soon his right was also turned and threatened so that there was danger of his being cut off from camp; therefore he hastened to retire from an untenable position.  Captain Norwood began to fulfill the order simultaneously with the rest, when finding himself pressed to hard to do it with safety, he selected a defensive position and remained, repelling the enemy from every side.<br>
<br>
As I received word at camp of the position of affairs at the front, I took Captain Well's company of infantry and Wagner's company of cavalry, and one howitzer under Lieut. Otis, Fourth Artillery, and pushed forward till I came to Sanford's line.  Reorganizing it, with the Infantry on the right, we moved slowly forward till we came to Norwood's position, where for a time he had been cut off from the rest of the troops.  In the engagement, Lieutenant Benson, serving with him, and five enlisted men were wounded.<br>
<br>
One enlisted man of Jackson's company was killed and one of Carr's wounded.  As I am not prepared to push the pursuit farther at this time, we return to camp, arriving about 3 P.M.  The battalions of infantry and artillery overtake me in the evening about 7 o'clock.  They had that day made the extraordinary march of forty-six miles, by alternating in the use of wagons.  They were stimulated to this activity by hearing of the attack upon my advance.<br>
<br>
The 21st, the command advances eighteen miles, the wounded,
escorted by the volunteers, taking the road to the rear by the way of Dry Creek to Virginia City.  (five of the volunteers, however, accompanied me on the march as far as Henry Lake) During the day's march we were overtaken by several Bannock Indians from Fort Hall, followed in the night by Captain Bainbridge, Fourteenth Infantry, with more Indian Scouts, increasing the number to fifty.<br>
<br>
These, he told us, were sent by direction of General Crook to report to me and assist me against the hostiles. The scouts were under the immediate charge of Mr. Fisher, Captain Bainbridge merely coming to see them safely under my command.<br>
<br>
Next day we make a long march, and camp on the north fork of the Snake River in a glade closely hemmed in by thick woods.  The indians supposed to be nearby and there were rumors of another attempt at a night attack, which kept the command on the<br>
qui vive and prevented the usual rest.  I resolved to one more effort to overtake and attack the hostiles before they got beyond Henry Lake, so that we were up a 2 A.M., and on the road before dawn.<br>
<br>
By 8 A.M., our Indian Scouts, with the column following in sight, had reached Tachee Pass about two miles east of Henry Lake, through which the road to the National Park runs.  The hostiles had camped at this point but were already gone.  Being necessitated to obtain supplies of every kind, I delayed my main command four days, sending, however, Cushing, Field and Norwood immediately via Fort Ellis, to operate from the Crow Agency, and keeping the Indian Scouts constantly in the neighborhood of the hostile Indians to determine and report the directions they might take, and annoy them by capturing their stock, if opportunity offered.<br>
<br>
SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS<br>
<br>
The Infantry and Artillery have met the enemy four times:<br>
<br>
1st.     Skirmish upon the Salmon.  The Indians were across the river and retreated after the skirmish.  Date, 28 June 1877.<br>
<br>
2nd.     General engagement; battle of the Clearwater.  Date 11 & 12 July 1877.<br>
<br>
3rd.     Skirmish at crossing of Clearwater at Kamiah.  Date 13 July 1877.<br>
<br>
4th.     Night attack upon our camp at Camas Meadows.  Date 20 August 1877.<br>
<br>
The Cavalry has engaged the enemy nine times:<br>
<br>
1st.     Captain Perry's engagement, 17 June 1877 at White Bird
Canyon.<br>
<br>
2nd.     Captain Whipple's skirmish with Looking Glass, 1 July 1877 at forks of Clearwater.<br>
<br>
3rd.     Skirmish of 3 July 1877 near Cottonwood Creek.<br>
<br>
4th.     Skirmish of 4 July 1877 at Norton's Ranch.<br>
<br>
5th.     Skirmish at the Wey-Ipe, 17 July 1877.<br>
<br>
6th, 7th, 8th and 9th were in conjunction with the infantry and artillery, as named above.<br>
<br>
The number of miles marched by the active column of infantry and artillery during the campaign thus far is over eight hundred miles.<br>
<br>
The number of miles in the saddle by the cavalry now with me, during the same period, is as follows:<br>
Miles<br>
Company I (Carr's) in saddle ................... 1,256<br>
Company C (Wagner's) in saddle ................. 1,164<br>
Company B (Jackson's) in saddle ................ 1,017<br>
Company K (Bendire's) in saddle ................   866<br>
<br>
From Kamiah to Henry Lake, at which point the cavalry and Infantry arrived together, the command was marching continuously without a day's halt 26 days, making an average of 19.3 miles a day; baggage generally by pack trains, the Indian trail from Kamiah to the Bitter Root Valley being impassable for wagons.  The command suffered often for want of shoes, overcoats, and underclothing during the latter part of the march, owing to the rapidity of the march, and the difficulty of procuring supplies in Montana.<br>
<br>
Another cause of serious embarrassment has been the absolute want of money by every department, and the necessity of giving vouchers that do not even pledge the credit of the government.  The weather has usually been warm by day, but the late nights exceedingly cold, water freezing in basin overnight an inch thick at Henry Lake, and also at other camps.<br>
<br>
The command has lived on the country as much as possible, and supplies have been purchased from the small villages along the route as far as their scanty stores would go.  Accompanying this report is a list giving recognition of service and recommending<br>
brevet promotions or other substantial award.<br>
<br>
Though under known interpretation of law our campaign against hostile Indians is not recognized as <B>war,</B> yet as it has been a severer tax upon the energies of officers and men than any period of the same length of our late <B>Civil War.</B>  surely some method must be found to encourage and properly reward gallantry and
service hardly ever excelled.<br>

HEADQUARTERS, LEFT COLUMN, HOWARD'S EXPEDITION<br>
Camp on Spokane River, near Falls, Washington<br>
10 August 1877<br>
<br>
SIR:  I have the honor to report the arrival of my command at this point on this, the day designated by Col. E.C. Watkins, inspector of Indian Affairs, for meeting the head men of the several Indian tribes in this section of the country.  The Indian chiefs and head men have not yet arrived here; they are reported to be enroute.  It is doubtful if we can hold our first council with them before Tuesday, the 14th instant.<br>
<br>
<B>No Washington Territorial Volunteers have as yet reported, nor do I expect any.</B>  My cavalry consists of Company F, First Cavalry (Perry's); total strength, 22 enlisted men.  Company H, First Cavalry (Trimble's), is said to be enroute.  A portion of it has been detained at Lewiston, Idaho, awaiting a remount.  A letter from Col. Sully, of the 6th instant, informed me that part of this company of cavalry would leave Lewiston to join me on the 7th.<br>
<br>
I have not heard from General Howard since I left Lewiston, Idaho, and am informed that it is impossible to employ couriers to go to him on the Lo Lo trail, except at the most exorbitant rates.  I shall endeavor to communicate with the department commander from this vicinity, near the old Coeur d'Alene Mission and Hell Gate.<br>
<br>
I am informed by Captain Harris, First Cavalry, who has this moment arrived from Fort Colville, that some of the Indians summoned to meet Col. Watkins here today were 200 miles west of
Colville when sent for, and I fear that our detention here will be much longer than I anticipated; but as the report that Joseph and his hostile band turned south after reaching the Bitter Root seems to be confirmed, this column, which has been moving in the opposite direction, can hardly hope to cooperate very directly with the pursuing troops, who are separated from us by a range of great mountains, and moving in a different direction.<br>
<br>
Had Joseph turned north or northwest, which at one time seemed likely, we would have been, as the department commander intended, precisely in position to engage him.<br>
<br>
I am satisfied that our march through this portion of the Coeur d'Alene and Spokane country has had the best effect in reassuring frontier settlers who were naturally greatly alarmed at the Nez Perce's outbreak, and in causing restless and excited young Indians to remain with their tribes.  Settlers are rapidly returning to their ranches, harvesting their crops, and are greatly cheered at the presence of troops in this section.<br>
<br>
Col. E.C. Watkins and myself are working together harmoniously, and after anticipated "talks" with the representatives of some nine thousand Indians, I hope we will have accomplished much that the department commander desires settled in this portion of his command.<br>
<br>
A supply train of ten citizens' teams reached me on the 8th from Lewiston Depot.  I shall unload and store these supplies here until needed, and return the teams tomorrow for discharge.  I hope to have all my hired teams soon replaced by government teams, and thus greatly reduce the expense of our movement.<br>
<br>
The teams furnished were hastily collected, are indifferent animals, and haul very small wagons, many of them worn out, and have frequently caused annoying delays.<br>
<br>
The health of the command is excellent.  While writing this Colonel Merriam furnishes me by courier a copy of General Howard's dispatch to Captain Sladen, aid-de-camp of August 6th, confirming the southern movement of Joseph's band.<br>
<br>
I will communicate the result of the council soon to be held here.<br>
<br>
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,<br>

<br>
     HEADQUARTERS LEFT COLUMN, HOWARD'S EXPEDITION
Camp at Spokane Falls, Wash., 18 August 1877<br>
<br>
GENERAL:  I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt from Lieutenant Bailey, Twenty-first Infantry, on the 17th, of your instructions of the 9th Instant.  Your orders of the 7th, sent by Courier Baker from Missoula, Mont., were received by me on the 16th instant, at this camp, and within an hour copied and forwarded by special courier to Major Green, First Cavalry, commanding near Mount Idaho.<br>
<br>
This command arrived here on the 1Oth instant, the day designated by Indian Inspector Watkins for the assembling of the chiefs and head men of the various tribes located in this region.  Colonel Watkins and your aid, Captain Wilkinson, came with me to this point.  Colonel Watkins found it impossible to assemble the council of chiefs until the 16th.  This delay was necessary and advantageous, as affording the best-disposed Indians of influence an opportunity to bring disaffected Indians, particularly the Spokane tribe, to a more correct understanding of the government requirements.  I think they all understand now that all Indians in your department will be compelled to elect, either to become citizens of the United States or go upon designated reservations.<br>
<br>
I regret that Spokane Chief Moses was not at the council.  Colonel Watkins informs me that it is doubtful if he received any notice to appear, through some misunderstanding of the inspector's agents.  The arrangements for the reservation for the Upper Spokanes, particularly "Spokane Garry's" band, are incomplete.  Garry yesterday desired to become a citizen, and until some understanding can be positively reached regarding reimbursement of those Spokanes who have made improvements, they will be obliged to leave.  Colonel Watkins preferred leaving many questions concerning them unsettled until his return to Washington.<br>
<br>
The Coeur d'Alenes, Colvilles, Okanagons, Pend'Oreilles, Lower Spokanes, Calaspelles, and the small band of Palouse Indians seem to be satisfactorily located, and I doubt if through any act of theirs any trouble will be made in your department.  As settlements increase near the reservation for the above named Indians, complications with citizens must be expected.  The Coeur d'Alenes, under Chief Sattis, deserve special credit for their efforts to keep other Indians quiet during Joseph's outbreak, and the protection they have - and voluntarily - rendered the settlers near them; they have in several instances, kept up fences, saved wheat and out-fields, and protected valuable property at abandoned ranches.<br>
<br>
At the earnest request of Inspector Watkins, I will delay the departure of this column to comply with your last orders, a day or two, until the several bands of Indians have left this vicinity and gone to their homes and fisheries.  Though no depredations have been committed in this neighborhood, settlers have not yet quite recovered from the alarm occasioned by the
outbreak of Joseph's band of Nez Perces, and in the spirit of your first instructions I will continue to do all possible to allay their fears and induce the speedy return of confidence and quiet; I believe much has already been accomplished in that direction.  Of course every settler would like to have a military post located very near his ranch.<br>
<br>
Elder Havemail, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and I think four other citizens are located at these falls.  The elder has a quarter-section here, and an interest in the ownership of the Falls water power, where a saw-mill is completed and a grist-mill in progress of construction.  He informs me that he had written you and induced many to join him in asking for military protection, You will probably receive many such letters or petitions.<br>
<br>
When funds are available for the purpose I would recommend the establishment of a large post at some point on or near the Spokane River, probably between the Upper Bridge and Lower Ferry. I will examine the country near the Upper Bridge tomorrow.  I will report to your adjutant-general at Portland the letters and commanders of the companies I leave, as you direct, at Palouse Bridge to remain there until or during cold weather, in order that I may instruct them regarding supplies, protection of the same, tents for the troops, etc.  Your orders names these two companies as an outpost, and until otherwise directed I will therefore report them as on detached service from my command.<br>
<br>
Companies I (Conrad's) and K (Daggett's), Twelfth Infantry, I will leave at Palouse Bridge; Companies C (Drum's) and B (Trowbridge's, commanded by Lieutenant Haines), I will send to report to Major Green, First Cavalry.<br>
<br>
In the discretion you gave me to camp my command near Lewiston, Idaho, I will unless you desire otherwise, camp with it near Lapwai, as the water at Lewiston is unusually bad this season and sickened myself and many of the officers and enlisted men during my detention there awaiting transportation for this movement.  I am told there is no good camp nearer than Lapwai post, and by being there I avoid the bad water of Lewiston.  If it should not be necessary for me to move south in order to conform to any anticipated movement of the hostiles, perhaps it would be a convenience and facilitate questions of supplies, issues, etc, if I were authorized to assume command at Lapwai while you continue this force in that vicinity.<br>
<br>
Before leaving my camp near Lewiston I ordered Colonel Grover, First Cavalry, as you had directed, to report for duty with this column; but on learning that <B>no Washington Volunteers</B> were to join me, I informed Colonel Sully, Twenty-first Infantry, that I would have no adequate mounted force for Colonel Grover to command, and requested that he be sent back to Walla Walla. Colonel Grover reached Lewiston the day after I left that point and was immediately relieved from further duty with this command.
Lieutenant Colonel Merriam, Second Infantry, joined me at a point 12 miles north of Lewiston, and was on the same day ordered back to Lewiston by Colonel Sully, to act in the name of the latter at Lewiston Depot during Colonel Sully's absence.<br>
<br>
Your dispatch of 9 August, stopping my further advance, and sent from your camp 15 miles south of Corvallis, Mont., I received here, via Portland and Walla Walla, at 6:45 P.M. on the 14th instant.  Should the hostiles turn southwest toward Colonel Green's command, you may rely upon the prompt movements of this force in that direction.<br>
<br>
I am, General, very respectfully, your obedient servant,<br>

<br>
HEADQUARTERS, DISTRICT OF MONTANA<br>
Fort Shaw, Montana, 2 September 1877<br>
<br>
Sir:  I have the honor to submit the following report of recent operations in this district:  Upon telegraphic information that the hostile Nez Perces had started westward over the Lo Lo Trail, I ordered one of the companies at Camp Baker (D) and the company at Fort Benton (F), with the exception of six men, to move at once to Fort Shaw.  They were concentrated there on the 27th of July.  The next day, with Company K and every man to be spared from the post, the command, numbering eight officers and seventy six men, commenced the march for Missoula, via Cadotte's Pass, with pack mules.<br>
<br>
The distance, 150 miles, was accomplished in seven days, the command reaching the new post near Missoula late in the afternoon of the 3rd of August in wagons sent out to meet it, preceded the day before by myself and the mounted detachment under Lieutenant James H. Bradley.  The Nez Perces, with a large herd of horses, had, on the 28th instant, succeeded in avoiding Captain Rawn's little command by marching around it, and had turned up the valley, of the Bitter Root.<br>
<br>
They were then leisurely moving up the valley, halting for a day or two at a time to trade off to the inhabitants their stolen stock and plunder for fresh horses, food, and supplies of all kinds, including ammunition.  The pitiful spectacle was presented of these red-handed plunderers, fresh from the slaughter of the
peaceful settlers of a neighboring territory, being furnished by the citizens of Montana with fresh supplies, which enabled them to continue their flight and their murderous work in other parts of the territory.<br>
<br>
One bright exception stands out in bold relief to what appears to have been the rule in the lower part of the Bitter Root Valley, Mr. Young of Corvallis, refused to barter for their blood money, closed his store, and dared them to do their worst.<br>
<br>
On the 4th, with my command re-enforced with seven officers and all the men to be spared by Captain Rawn's command (which had in the meantime been strengthened by Company G, Seventh Infantry, and every available man to be spared from Fort Ellis) I left the post at one o'clock, with 15 officers and 146 men, in wagons, and moved to Stevensville, which we reached about nine o'clock, a distance of some twenty-five miles.<br>
<br>
The next day we made thirty miles, and were joined by a number of citizens from the upper valley, who volunteered as scouts and to join us in the fight, if we should overtake the Indians.<br>
<br>
I had been informed that beyond a certain point it would be impracticable to take wagons, and therefore brought along our pack-mules, intending, when the time came, to cut loose from our wagons and take to the packs; but on this day I was fortunate enough to secure the services of Mr. Joe Blodget, a man thoroughly acquainted with the country, who assured me that he had brought a lightly-loaded wagon over the trail all the way from Bannock, and that it was possible although difficult road.<br>
<br>
The road was excellent until we commenced to climb the divide separating us from Ross's Hole, at the extreme upper end of Bitter Root Valley.  Here the ascent was so steep, rugged, and crooked that we were compelled to halt at nightfall and make a dry camp before reaching the summit, having succeeded in making 13-1/2 miles, with a still steeper ascent before us the next day.<br>
<br>
We had up to this time been passing regularly the Indian camping grounds, which showed they were moving at the rate of about twelve or fourteen miles a day, so that if we could continue to double that distance the question of overtaking the enemy was simply one of time.  No accurate estimate of their strength could be made, as many of them occupied simple brush shelters.<br>
<br>
It was observed, also, that the tepee-poles, always left standing in their camps, were collected each night for temporary purposes, and no signs of tepee-poles nor travois for wounded were seen on the trail.  The best estimate of their strength I could obtain from the inhabitants of the valley gave them 260 warriors, all of whom were well-armed and with a plentiful supply of ammunition.<br>
<br>
On camping at the foot of the main divide of the Rocky Mountains, on the evening of the 7th, Lieutenant Bradley, who had been sent
in advance during the day with his mounted men and a small party of citizens, offered to make a night march, if possible to overtake the camp, and make an attempt to stampede the herd, which every indication showed was large.  Some twenty five of the citizens volunteered to accompany him, as did also Lieutenant J. W. Jacobs, regimental quartermaster, Seventh Infantry, his nephew Mr. S.J. Herron, of Kentucky, Sergeant Wilson, Company I, Seventh Infantry, and Bostwick, the post guide of Fort Shaw.<br>
<br>
In accordance with his suggestion, Lieutenant Bradley, with his command, amounting to some sixty men, was ordered to push forward during the night, and try to strike the camp before daylight.<br>
<br>
The next morning the main body resumed the march at five o'clock, and at once commenced to ascend the formidable barrier in front, the difficulties of the road being increased by quantities of fallen timber, which had to be removed or got around.<br>
<br>
Our wagons were only lightly loaded, and by doubling teams and using men at drag ropes we succeeded in reaching the summit, a distance of about two miles, in six hours.  From thence a gentle incline led for over twenty miles down into the Big Hole Basin. But the road was much obstructed by fallen timber and a difficult stream, with abrupt banks, which we were obliged to cross numerous times.  Here the services of our excellent guide, Joe Blodget, were most valuable, and but for him, we could not possibly have made even the time we did.<br>
<br>
Before we had reached the summit I received a courier from Lieutenant Bradley informing me that the distance he had to pass over was greater than was supposed, and that daylight had overtaken him before he had succeeded in reaching the camp of the Indians.  We pushed ahead without waiting to rest or feed the animals, and later in the day I received another message from him informing me that he had discovered the location of the Indian camp, had concealed his command in the hills, and was awaiting my arrival.<br>
<br>
Fearing the Indians would discover him, I left the train under charge of one company (Logan's), to come on as fast as possible, and started forward with the rest of the command and the mountain howitzer, but with all the speed we could make it was nearly sunset before we reached Lieutenant Bradley's position, and the Indian camp was still four or five miles distant.  The train was now brought up, closely parked amidst the brush of the little valley down which we were travelling, and the animals turned out to rest and feed.<br>
<br>
No fires were built, and after posting pickets, all laid down to rest until ten o' clock. At that hour, the command, now consisting of 17 officers, 132 men, and 34 citizens, started down the trail on foot, each man being provided with ninety rounds of ammunition.  The howitzer could not accompany the column, in consequence of the quantity of fallen timber obstructing the
trail, and the noise which would have to be made in removing it.  Orders were therefore given that at early daylight it should start after us, with a pack-mule loaded with two thousand rounds of extra ammunition.<br>
<br>
The 34 citizens who volunteered to accompany us being joined by Lieutenant Bradley's command, the advance was given to him, and the column moved in silence down the trail, the night being clear and starlight.  After proceeding about three miles the country opened out into the Big Hole Basin, and still following the trail guided by one of the citizens who knew the locality, we turned to the left and followed along the low foot-hills soon coming in sight of fires.<br>
<br>
After proceeding about a mile from where we emerged from the mountains, we passed through a point of timber projecting out into the valley, and just beyond encountered a large herd of ponies grazing along the hillside.  As we silently advanced they commenced neighing, but fortunately did not become alarmed, and by the time we had passed through the herd the outline of the tepees could be made out in the bottom below.<br>
<br>
The command was now halted, and all laid down to wait for daylight.  Here we waited for two hours in plain hearing of the barking dogs, crying babies, and other noises of the camp.  Just before daylight, Sanno's company, and then Comba's sent down into the valley and deployed as skirmishers, and as day began to break and enabling me to make out the ground beneath us, I found that the tepees, in the form of an open V with the apex toward us, extended along the opposite side of a large creek some two or three hundred yards from us.<br>
<br>
The intervening space between the camp and the foot of the slope upon which we stood was almost entirely covered with a dense growth of willow brush, in the grassy spaces between which herds of ponies were grazing.  A deep slough with water in places waist deep wound through this bottom from left to right, and had to be crossed before the stream itself could be reached.  As the light increased, Comba and Sanno were ordered to move forward, then Bradley and his citizens on the left, with Rawn and Williams in support.<br>
<br>
All pushed forward in perfect silence, while now scarcely a sound issued from the camp.  Suddenly a single shot on the extreme left rang out in the clear morning air, followed quickly by several others, and the whole line pushed rapidly forward through the brush.  Logan's company being sent in on the run on the extreme right.  A heavy fire was at once opened along the whole line of tepees, the startled Indians rushing from them in every direct-
ion, and for a few minutes no shots were returned.<br>
<br>
Comba and Sanno first struck the camp at the apex of the V, crossed the main stream, and delivered their fire at close range into the tepees and the Indians as they poured from them.  Many
of the Indians broke at once for the brush, and sheltering themselves behind the creek-bank opened fire on the troops as they came into the open ground. This was especially the case on the right or upper end of the camp where the creek made a bend toward our line.<br>
<br>
As Logan on the right of the line swept forward, our men found themselves directly at the back of these Indians, and here the greatest slaughter took place.  In less than twenty minutes we had complete possession of the whole camp, and orders were given to commence destroying it.<br>
<br>
But the Indians had not given up the fight, and while a portion of the command were engaged in setting fire to the tepees, other portions were occupied in replying to the rifle shots, which now came upon us from every direction - the brush, the creek-bank, the open prairie, and the distant hills.  The fire from these latter positions, although at long range, was by far the most deadly, and it soon became evident that the enemy's sharpshooters, hidden behind trees, rocks, etc., possessed an immense advantage over us, insomuch that we could not compete with them.<br>
<br>
At almost every crack of the rifle from the distant hills some member of the command was sure to fall.  My acting adjutant Lieut. C.A. Woodruff, and myself with our horses, were wounded at this time.  Under these circumstances, the only remedy was to take up some position where we would be more on an equality with the enemy.  Orders were, therefore, reluctantly given to withdraw through the brush to a position under the hill from which we had first started, and then push for the timber through which we had passed in the night.<br>
<br>
This movement was successfully accomplished, such of our wounded as we could find being carried with us, and the few Indians who occupied the timber being driven out.  Here we took up positions, and sheltering ourselves behind the trees, fallen logs, etc., replied to the fire of the sharpshooters, who soon gathered around us, occupying the brush below and the timber above.<br>
<br>
For a time their fire was very close and deadly; and here Lieutenant English received a mortal wound; Captain Williams was struck a second time, and a large number of men killed and wounded.  The Indians crawled up as closely as they dared to come, and with yells of encouragement urged each other on, but our men met them with a bold front, and our fire, as we afterward learned by the blood and dead Indians found, punished them severely.<br>
<br>
Just as we took up our position in the timber two shots from our howitzer on the trail above us were heard, and we afterward learned that the gun and packmule with ammunition were, on the road to us intercepted by Indians.  The non-commissioned officers in charge, Sergeants Daly and Fredericks and Corporal Sales,
made the best resistance they could, whilst the two privates cowardly fled at the first appearance of danger and never stopped till they had put a hundred miles between themselves and the battle-field, spreading, of course, as such cowards always do, the most exaggerated reports of dire calamity which had overtaken the entire command.<br>
<br>
The piece was fired twice, and as the Indians closed around it, the men used their rifles.  Corporal Sales was killed, the two sergeants wounded, the animal was shot down, and Private John O. Bennett, the driver, entangled in their fall, cutting himself loose, he succeeded in reaching the brush and escaped to the train, which the two sergeants, Blodgett, the guide, and Williams a colored servant of Lieutenant Jacobs, also reached.  In the meantime our fight in the timber continued with more or less activity all day.  But every hour was increasing the strength of our position, when a new danger threatened us.<br>
<br>
A strong wind was blowing from the west, and taking advantage of this, the Indians set fire to the grass, intending, doubtless, to follow up the fire and make a dash upon us while we were blinded by the dense smoke.  But fortunately the grass was too green to burn rapidly, and before the fire reached any of the dead timber lying about us, it went out.  The Indians remained around us firing occasionally nearly all night.  They had, however, broken camp immediately after we had abandoned it, and sent off their women and children and herds in a southerly direction.<br>
<br>
During the night I sent a runner to the train and two others to Deer Lodge via French's Gulch, for medical assistance and supplies, fearing our train had been captured.  This fear was increased early next morning on the arrival of a courier from General Howard, who said he had seen nothing of it.  He had passed it in the darkness of the night without seeing it.  Later in the day we communicated with the train, but the Indians in small parties still appearing in the interval which separated us from it, I sent Captain Browning with twenty five men to bring it in and it reached us just before sundown, bringing us our much needed blankets and provisions, not, however, until we had partially consumed the flesh of Lieut. Woodruff's horse, brought wounded to our position and conveniently killed by the Indians inside our lines.<br>
<br>
The Indians gave us a parting shower of bullets about 11 o'clock that night and we saw no more of them afterwards.<br>
<br>
Parties were sent out on the 11th to bury the dead, all of whom were found, recognized, and decently interred, and to recover the howitzer, which was found concealed in the brush, the carriage-
wheels being carried off.<br>
<br>
At 10 A.M., General Howard reached my camp, having pushed forward with a small escort, under the belief that he was coming to a sorely beleaguered party, and the next morning his medical
officers arrived and gave to our suffering wounded the much needed attendance.  The following day having assigned to duty with General Howard, to aide in the pursuit, fifty men of my command, under Captain Browning and Lieutenants Wright and Van Orsdale, all of whom volunteered for the service, I left the battle-field with the wounded and the balance of the command for Deer Lodge, over ninety miles distant.<br>
<br>
I reached that place on the 15th, and the command the next day, thanks to the spontaneous assistance promptly forwarded to us by the citizens of Helena, Deer Lodge and Butte.<br>
<br>
In closing the report, I desire to speak in the most commendatory terms of the conduct of both officers and men (with the exception of the two cowards who deserted the howitzer).  With the exception of Captain Logan and Lieutenant Bradley, both of whom were killed very early in the action, every officer came under my personal observation at some time during the fight, and were all so active, zealous and courageous, not only in themselves fighting and cheering on their men, but in prompt obedience to every order, I find it out of the question to make an attempt at discrimination, and will simply mention the names of those who were present in the battle:<br>
<br>
They were Captains C.C. Rawn, Richard Comba, George L. Browning, J.M.J. Sanno, Constant Williams (wounded twice) and William Logan (Killed); First Lieutenants C.A. Cooledge (wounded three times), James H. Bradley (killed), J.W. Jacobs, Regimental Quartermaster Allen H. Jackson, George H. Wright, and William H. English (mortally wounded and since dead); and Second Lieutenants C.A. Woodruff, Acting Adjutant (wounded three times), J.F. Van Orsdale, E.E. Harden, and Francis Woodbridge.<br>
<br>
For the officers engaged in this sharp little affair I have nothing to ask, and am unable to persuade myself to ask for that next to nothing, a brevet.  But I earnestly urge that the authorities may ask Congress the enactment of a special law, giving officers below the grade of field officers, and soldiers wounded in battle the same increase in pay as they are now entitled to for every five years of service, the law to go into effect from the commencement of the present fiscal year.<br>

GENERAL A.H. TERRY<br>
COMMANDING DEPARTMENT OF DAKOTA<br>
<br>
The inclosed dispatches just received.  I fear that the request for more troops has reached me to late.  I will leave nine companies of infantry and one of cavalry at this point and on the Yellowstone.  With the remainder I will strike across by head of Big Dry Musselshell, Crooked Creek, and Carroll, with the hope of intercepting the Nez Perces in their movement north.  I presume that Generals Howard and Sturgis will follow up the Missouri, and I earnestly request that an abundance of rations and grain be sent up the Missouri for the commands that will be on the river.<br>
<br>
The steamers are liable to meet the commands at mouth of Musselshell or above on the Missouri.  If the stores are not all required on the Missouri they can be transported across to these posts.  I would request not less than 60,000 rations and all the grain that can be forwarded (say 500,000 pounds) also officer stores and a quantity of clothing, which will be needed, be sent up the Missouri.<br>
<br>
I will send couriers to Carroll to meet the boats.  The Infantry companies at Peck can be employed as guards for stores.<br>

<br>
COLONEL:  While Colonel Sturgis was scouting toward Stinking Water, the Indians and my force in close pursuit passed his right, and they, after a short detour, turned to Clarke's Fork and by forced marches avoided Sturgis completely.<br>
<br>
I have sent Sturgis with Major Stanford, First Cavalry, and
Lieut. Otis, Fourth Artillery, with howitzer battery in fast pursuit, and myself following as rapidly as possible with the remainder of my own immediate command.  The Indians are reported going down Clarke's Fork and straight towards the Musselshell.  They will in all probability cross the Yellowstone near the mouth of Clarke's Fork, and make all haste to join a band of hostile Sioux.<br>
<br>
They will use every exertion to reach the Musselshell country and form this junction, and as they make exceedingly long marches it will require unusual activity to intercept them.  I earnestly request you to make every effort in your power to prevent the escape of this hostile band, and at least to hold them in check until I can overtake them.  Please send me return couriers with information of your and the hostiles' whereabouts, your intended movements, and any other information I ought to know.<br>

DEAR GENERAL:  I forwarded dispatch just received from General Howard, who is some 38 miles in my rear, I have also a duplicate which I will endeavor to send by boat if possible.  I fear you will be greatly disappointed when you learn that the hostiles have, by sudden and unexpected turn, crossed this river and thrown us hopelessly, I fear, in their rear.<br>
<br>
All that you could do was done, and I thought all that we, too, could do was also done to insure their destruction; and indeed, four days ago I would not have given a dollar to have had their capture insured to me; but the absence of a single guide, who had ever been in the country in which we were operating, taken in connection with our ignorance of it, and its exceedingly rough and broken character, and my inability to learn anything of Howard's position, enabled them to elude me at the very moment I felt sure of success.  This is extremely mortifying to me, I assure you, and we are doing all that human endurance can possibly accomplish to circumvent them yet.<br>
<br>
My animals are shoeless and broken down, and my command without rations, yet made fifty miles yesterday, and will try to do so until we overtake them; but while we are crossing the river, their scouts are on the hills opposite watching us, and I fear the main body has some thirty-six hours the start.  I have no suggestions to offer, as I presume General Howard, in the
accompanying dispatch, has laid the situation before you in detail.<br>

REPORT OF COLONEL NELSON A. MILES ON FINAL OPERATION<br>
<br>
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF YELLOWSTONE, IN THE FIELD<br>
Camp near North end of Bear's Paw Mountain, Montana<br>
6 October 1877<br>
<br>
Sir:  I have the honor to report having received on the evening of the 17th ultimo, a communications dated the 12th from General Howard, then on Clark's Fork, stating that the Nez Perces had evaded the commands to the north of them and were pushing northward.  I at once organized all the available force of my command for a movement to intercept them or pursue them.  The command left the cantonment on the morning of the 18th.  The different orders regarding escort for the commission had already put enroute the battalion, Second Cavalry, and one company (Hale's) Seventh Cavalry.  These were taken up on the march.<br>
<br>
The command reached the Missouri River, at the mouth of the Musselshell, on the 23rd day of September, but, learning on the morning of the 25th, that the Nez Perces had crossed Cow Island on the 23rd, had destroyed the depot there and moved northward, I immediately crossed the Missouri River.  The command on the 26th moved northward from mouth of Musselshell, and on the 27th, leaving my train to follow, pushed on rapidly by the northern of the Little Rockies, thence across the northern end of Bear's Paw mountains, which point I reached on the evening of the 29th.  On the same evening the trail was discovered by my scouts entering the range from the left.<br>
<br>
Starting at 4 o'clock on the 30th, and moving around the northern end of the mountains, the trail was struck at 6 A.M. near the head of the Snake River; the village shortly afterward was discovered on Eagle Creek, and was immediately charged, the battalions, Seventh Cavalry (Captain Hale) and Fifth Infantry (Capt. Snyder), attacking in front; the battalion, Second Cavalry (Captain Tyler) by circuit attacked in rear and secured the stock to the number of seven hundred (700) horse, mules and ponies; the fighting was very severe, and at close quarters; the Indians took refuge in some deep ravines, and their firing was accurate and well kept up.<br>

Having at the first outset surprised and shut up the greater part of the Indians in the village, and cut off and secured the greater part of their stock and perceiving that the position could be carried by storm only with very heavy loss, I determined to maintain my lines around them, keep them under fire, and at the same time give them an opportunity to surrender if they desired.  The positions taken up on the 30th were, with slight modifications, maintained during the four succeeding days and nights; meantime a few shells from a 12-pounder Napoleon were thrown in from time to time and a sharp-shooting fire kept up whenever it could be effective.<br>
<br>
The Indians had from time to time displayed a white flag, but when communicated with had refused to surrender their arms; but on the morning of the 5th they surrendered, Chief Joseph leading, surrendering his arms and ammunition, followed by his band, and their village is in our possession.  The fighting, as reported, was sharp, and the losses on both sides considerable.  Casualties on the part of the troops were 23 killed and 45 wounded.  The Indians admit a loss of Chiefs Looking-Glass, Too-hool-hul-sole, Ollicut, a brother of Joseph and two others of their principal men, and twenty five killed and forty-six wounded.<br>
<br>
The endurance and courage of the command, as tested by the forced marches and hardy contested fight at short range, are worthy of highest commendation.  A severe storm of snow and wind, which set in on the 1st instant, added greatly to the hardships, which have been borne without murmuring.  The opportune arrival of the train under escort commander Captain Brotherton, enable me to protect the wounded from the worst effects of the storm.  I propose tomorrow to march hence toward the Missouri.<br>
<br>
The force of General Howard, including the command of General Sturgis, following the trail of the Nez Perces, is approaching from the Missouri.  The general arrived at evening of the 4th, having moved forward in advance of his command with a small escort.<br>
<br>

     IN THE FIELD, STEAMER BENTON, MISSOURI RIVER
19 October 1877<br>
<br>
GENERAL P.H. SHERIDAN<br>
COMMANDING DIVISION OF MISSOURI<br>
<br>
It is due you as commander of this Military Division to know the facts that I have already telegraphed General McDowell from the battle-field concerning the operations and surrender of the hostile Nez Perces.  First, on the 11th of September, I assumed command of Sturgis' troops after I had passed him at Clarke's Fork, and he operated in conjunction with my force proper to the close.  The advance, Sturgis immediately commanding, then made a forced march of eighty five miles in two days, struck the hostiles, captured quite a number of their ponies killed and wounded several warriors, and drove them beyond the Musselshell.<br>
<br>
The 12th of September I sent from Clarke's Fork a dispatch to Colonel Miles showing him that the Indians were making for the Musselshell country by exceedingly long marches and urging unusual activity, and earnestly requested him to make every effort in his power to prevent the escape of the hostile band.<br>
<br>
Colonel Miles received the dispatch at Tongue River the evening of the 16th and promptly moved his command - two battalions of Second and Seventh Cavalry,and one of his own mounted Infantry -
on the l7th to the mouth of the Musselshell.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, as he requested nine days to get into position, I "slowed" my march to about fifteen miles per day, knowing that the hostiles watching me would do the same.  They slackened their pace after crossing the Missouri at Cow Island.  As soon as Miles found they were beyond the Missouri, he crossed where he was, and made forced marches diagonally across our front to the north of Bear Paw Mountains, and struck the Indians about 7 A.M. of the 3Oth ultimo.<br>
<br>
They were encamped near a creek bottom in a strong natural position, but their numerous ponies, now nearly worn out, were scattered over the open country grazing.  Miles charged the camp and herds simultaneously.  A desperate fight occurred, in which two officers and twenty five men were killed and four officers and forty two men wounded.  The ponies were nearly all captured - some seven hundred - but the Indians, hemmed in by Mile's pickets, held out until after my arrival.  Firing was still going on the evening of the 4th.  I had with me two friendly Nez Perces and an interpreter.<br>
<br>
The two Nez Perces were sent the next morning into the hostile camp.  Through them the surrender was arranged.  A few Indians, including White Bird, crept out through the lines during the night.  A portion of my artillery and infantry and Sturgis' cavalry were brought up within twenty five miles of the battle-
field, but as the Sioux under Sitting Bull continued quiet, I deemed it best on account of the difficulty of supplying the
command to return the foot troops to the Missouri.  Sturgis' cavalry was ordered to report to Colonel Miles, and moved in con-
junction with him back to the mouth of the Musselshell.  I embarked my troops on the Steamer Benton.<br>
<br>
On account of Sitting Bull's proximity, I delayed my departure from the 1Oth to the 13th instant, till Miles, burdened with the wounded and the Indian prisoners, 375 in number, had reached the Missouri.  Colonel Sturgis and his regiment deserve special credit for energetic, persistent, and successful work.  Colonel Miles and his command have and deserve the great honor of the final battle and surrender, while appreciation and gratitude are due our officers and men who engaged the hostiles with success in Idaho, have cheerfully made forced marches for 1,600 miles, were a part of the last operating force north of the Missouri, and were represented by their commander at the surrender.<br>
<br>
I directed Colonel Miles to keep the prisoners until next spring, it being too late to send them to Idaho by direct routes this fall, and too costly by steamer and rail.  Can I meet you in Chicago the 24th instant.<br>
<br>
O.O. HOWARD, COMMANDING DEPARTMENT<br>
<br>

<br>
In closing out this chapter it is felt that it would be incomplete unless the final disposition of Joseph and his band was told.  Brigadier General John Gibbon, commanding the Department of the Columbia in his annual report for the year 1885 advised the General, commanding the Division of the Pacific as follows:<br>
<br>
*          *          *          *          *          *<br>
"Probably the most important event of the year, certainly the most important to the Indians themselves, has been the return to this department of the remnant of Chief Joseph's band of Nez Perces - now principally composed of old men, women, and children, widows and orphans - from Indian Territory, where they had been living, virtually prisoners of war, since the close of the Nez Perce hostilities and their capture in 1877.  Popular feeling in Idaho Territory unquestionably was decidedly opposed to their return.<br>
<br>
Rumors of threats and violence on the part of disaffected whites had come to the knowledge of the Interior Department.  Several of the Nez Perce warriors were under indictment in Idaho Territory for the murders perpetrated in 1877.  Anticipating there might be danger in their passage through Idaho, the Interior Department had requested that every precaution be taken to prevent difficulties between the white settlers and these Indians.<br>
<br>
"They came into the department (Columbia) by the Union Pacific and Oregon Short Line Railways, and were met by Captain Frank D. Baldwin, Fifth Infantry, acting judge advocate, at Pocatello, and escorted thence by troops to Wallula Junction, on the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company's Railroad, where they were divi-
ded into two parties - one proceeding, under military escort, by rail and river, via Walla Walla and Lewiston, to the Lapwai Reservation, in Idaho, and the other, including Joseph, likewise escorted, by rail and wagons, via Spokane Falls to the Colville Reservation.<br>
<br>
Those members of the band moved to the Lapwai Agency, their former home, soon dispersed among their relatives and friends.  They numbered one hundred and sixteen persons.  The proportion of men, women and children is not shown by the records.<br>
<br>
"First Lieutenant Daniel C. Pearson, Second Cavalry, under date of the 8th instant (8 September 1885) reports that "the condition of these Indians is satisfactory, peaceful, and creditable to all concerned.  Upon their arrival in June last, thirty day's rations were supplied to them, and since none at all.  They dispersed
among their tribal friends on the third day after arriving, and have been living with them on their farms, and with them have been self-supporting since that time.<br>
<br>
The only rations to be supplied the returned Indians the coming winter will be for the benefit of about forty of their number who are old men and women and widows.  Some have shown a disposition to visit the old Wallowa Valley, but were refused passes, and readily acquiesced in the view that it was not proper for them to do so.  Their sojourn in the East changed them from a nomadic to a comparatively civilized people, whose respect for law and order is a marked characteristic, * * *.  Several heads of families have already taken up land, and with presents of horses from friends are started as farmers, and will have the further help of the Government of wagons, harness, implements, and house material."<br>
<br>
"That portion of the band immediately under Joseph - one hundred and fifty (forty-four men, seventy-four women, and thirty-two children) is temporarily encamped not far from Fort Spokane, and without property or money, was in a most destitute and pitiful condition.  Had not the military authorities come to their relief they would have starved."<br>
<br>
In another part of his report, General Gibbon advised that the Indian Department had failed to provide them with food and that this group were entirely dependent upon the scanty rations issued to them from Army supplies at a daily cost of $23.59.<br>
<br>
Major General John Pope, Commanding the Division of the Pacific, in forwarding General Gibbon's report, stated:<br>
<br>
"The painful story of the return of the small band of Nez Perces from the Indian Territory to their old homes and reservation in Washington Territory is told with force and feeling, and should command the sympathy of the country and the active interposition of the Government.  To abandon these poor Indians, without food and without implements even to shelter themselves from the severe winters incident to that climate, seems to me a most unhappy and most deplorable act, which should be remedied without delay, for the sake of humanity as well as because it is due to fair dealing and to the honor of the government.<br>
<br>
"The military forces are now issuing food to them to a degree limited both as to quantity and character, but the military stores will not long suffice to protect them from starvation.  The necessary tools and implements to shelter themselves or to raise crops it is not in the power of the Army to give them, and immediate action on the part of the Department of the Government charged with their care is demanded by every consideration of humanity and of right."<br>
<br>
Major General O.O. Howard, who relieved General Pope in command of the Division of the Pacific, in his report for 1886, stated:
"The Nez Perces, including the returned "non-treaties" and the Indians of the Columbia region, are slowly improving their condition.  The Nez Perces proper I consider the most intelligent and promising of our Indian tribes.  General Gibbons recommends "that the sum of $1,895.55, expended by the Subsistence Department in feeding the destitute Nez Perce Indians in the vicinity of Fort Spokane last fall, be recovered from the Indian Department."  In this I concur."<br>
<br>
In his annual report dated 31 August 1887, General Gibbon stated as follows:  "Ever since the location of Chief Joseph and a part of his tribe upon the Colville Reservation, his efforts and those of his people to establish themselves on farms and go to work to earn a subsistence have been persistently opposed by a portion of the Indians before located on that reservation.  This opposition finally reached such a point that the authority of the Indian Department was obtained for the use of the military force to protect Chief Joseph and his people and compel the malcontents to acquiesce in the decision of the Government.<br>
<br>
Two companies of troops were sent from Fort Spokane in July last to enforce this decision, with instructions to give every protection to Chief Joseph and his people, to warn all others against any interference with them, and in case of disregard of the warning to promptly arrest the offenders and send them in irons to Fort Spokane.  The mere presence of the military seems to have had the desired effect, and I trust there will be no further interference with the very earnest desire of Chief Joseph and his band to establish homes for themselves and earn a living."<br>
<br>
In his report dated 19 August 1890, General Gibbon, then commanding both the Division of the Pacific and the Department of the Columbia, stated:<br>
<br>
"The Indians in the department have been perfectly peaceful during the year and doubtless will remain so indefinitely, unless goaded to desperation by the constant encroachment of the whites and their acts of injustice.<br>
<br>
"The good effects of the removal of the Indian "Skolaskin" from the Colville Reservation are marked, and the commanding officer of Fort Spokane reports that he has heard of no difficulties such as "Skolaskin" caused, since his arrest.  As a disquieting element on the reservation, his removal was deemed essential to the welfare of the rest of the Indians, and it is recommended that he be not returned to his tribe so long as the present condition of affairs exists.<br>
<br>
There is no desire, however, to treat him with needless severity, and I suggest that he be allowed the freedom of Alcatraz Island and, if he desires it, that his wife and children be sent to join him."<br>

NEZ PERCE WAR.<br>
<br>
Mark K. Brown, "The Chessmen of War," <B>Idaho Yesterdays.<br>
</B>X (Winter, 1966-67), p. 22-29.<br>
<br>
War and the game of Chess have much in common.  In both, the characteristics of the pieces determine how the game is played.  And, in the end, the position of the pieces on the playing board dictates the final outcome.  What is often overlooked in studying a war are the possibilities which hinge around these two major factors and in no Indian war have these been so completely ignored by would-be students as in the struggle with the Nez Perce Indians.'<br>
<br>
The war began on June 11, 1877.  On this day three warriors left a large camp on the southern edge of Camas Prairie, in west central Idaho, and rode southward up the canyon of the Salmon River.  One was a disgruntled individual who had been humiliated at a kissing dance the preceding evening.  To vindicate what he <B>regarded </B>as his honor, he was about to participate in four murders.  These would light the fuse to a powder keg situation that had existed for several years, and precipitate a tragic war a struggle for which neither the Indians nor the whites had made any preparation.<br>
<br>
Some sixty miles to the north, soldiers at Fort Lapwai went about their routine tasks.  No one expected trouble.  In fact, the army believed that the difficulties with the Non Treaty Indians had come to an end when this group had agreed to come on to the reser-
vation by June 15.  All indications pointed to compliance with this stipulation.<br>
<br>
Early on the morning of June 14, General 0.  0. Howard, commanding officer of the Department of the Columbia, an aide, and Inspector Watkins of the Department of Indian Affairs arrived in Lewiston on a steamboat which nosed up to the landing early in the morning.<br>
<br>
They were surveying some of the troublesome Indian problems within the general's department; although they had come to North Idaho on some routine matters, they also wanted to see that the NonTreaty faction complied with the ultimatum laid down in a council about a month before.  Watkins' business took him to the Lapwai Agency,
about two miles from the fort.  There the post commander, Captain David Perry, urged the general to spend his idle time visiting with the officers at the post.<br>
<br>
Near evening, a courier arrived with a letter from a hotel keeper in Mount Idaho, a village near the southeastern edge of Camas Prairie; the letter stated that Indians in the vicinity were making hostile maneuvers.  The settlers were frightened.  Neither Howard nor Perry took the letter seriously since past experience had taught them not to put too much trust in Such stories.<br>
<br>
Too often they were either distorted or the result of ulterior motives.  The truth-if any-behind this communication was never established.  Nevertheless, a small party detailed to investigate the report set out the following morning.<br>
<br>
Before proceeding very far, the men met other couriers bringing the first news of the outbreak. Now there could be no doubt that trouble had developed.<br>
<br>
Fort Lapwai was a small post intended only for police duty.  Its normal complement was two companies.  These, at the moment, were F Company of the First Cavalry and Company of the Twenty-first Infantry Regiments.  However, H Company of the First Cavalry fortunately was camped just outside the limits of the post, having been brought in to create a show of force  during the council  which had ended a month earlier.  These three companies constituted the force immediately available to cope with the situation.<br>
<br>
Although no hint is given in accounts written afterward by participants, it seems probable that no serious difficulty was ex-
pected.  The Nez Perce had always been friendly and, indeed, the editor of the Lewiston Teller had insisted sometime before that these Indians did not even know how to wage war.<br>
<br>
At any rate, General Howard detailed the two companies of cavalry to march to Camas Prairie to survey the situation.  This force, consisting of four officers, and ninety nine enlisted men, left the post about sundown on June 15.<br>
<br>
As this detachment was getting ready to move out, Howard sent his aide hurrying to Fort Walla Walla, over 100 miles away, with instructions for reinforcements to come as quickly as possible.  Prior to the council in May, certain troop dispositions had been made to cope with what was then regarded as possible Indian threats.  In addition to the assignment of H Company to the
Lewiston area, E and L Companies of the First Cavalry had been detailed from Fort Walla Walla, to the Wallows Valley where Joseph's band of Non-Treaty Indians <B>usually </B>lived.<br>
<br>
When Colonel Grover, commanding officer of Fort Walla Walla, objected to having his post stripped, Howard had ordered other troops up the Columbia River from Fort Vancouver to replace them.  This post, just across the river from Portland, was the regimental headquarters of the Twenty-First Infantry, and also the Headquarters from which Howard administered the military affairs in Oregon, Washington, and all of Idaho except the extreme southeastern part.<br>
<br>
This shifting of troops had resulted in B and H Companies of the Twenty-first Infantry coming to Grover's post.  Later, when there were some troublesome "renegades" in the vicinity of Wallula (the little settlement on the Columbia which served as a port for Walla Walla), E Company of the Fourth Artillery and E Company of the Twenty-first Infantry were ordered to this point.<br>
<br>
General Howard's earlier request had set in motion E and L Companies of the First Cavalry, and B and H Companies of the Twenty-first Infantry-with the two "E" Companies enroute to Wallula.<br>
<br>
While these four companies were being ordered to Fort Lapwai, news arrived at the post that Captain Perry's detachment had been soundly whipped in an engagement in White Bird Canyon.  Not only had they been defeated, but they had been pursued some thirteen miles.  A third of them had been killed.  While General Howard never admitted the humiliating fact, the warriors who administered this drubbing probably did not number over seventy.<br>
<br>
Even though General Howard did not anticipate serious difficulty in coping with the Non-Treaty faction, he was apprehensive that the disorder might spread to other groups which were restless, dissatisfied, or which had never gone on to a reservation.<br>
<br>
Therefore he proceeded to gather a force to meet emergencies beyond the crisis of the moment.  However, in the end, the anticipated difficulties never materialized, but the Nez Perce proved to be far more formidable than he had expected.  One of the fascinating, but hitherto untold, stories of the Nez Perce war pertains to the mobilization of the force Howard was to wield.<br>
<br>
To appreciate what actually took place, it is necessary to under-
stand something of the organization of the United States Army, as well as some of the geographical factors involved.
For military purposes, the United States was divided into what were called Divisions.   Three of these, the Divisions of the Atlantic, the Missouri and the Pacific, were to become involved.<br>
<br>
The last, commanded by General Irving McDowell, with headquarters in San Francisco, consisted of the Departments of Columbia, California, and Arizona.  Included were the states or territories of Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, and Arizona.  The Division of the Missouri was administered from Chicago by General Philip H. Sheridan.  General Winfield Scott Hancock supervised the affairs of the Division of the Atlantic from Governor's Island in New York harbor.<br>
<br>
In command of all was General of the Army William T. Sherman in Washington, D.C. The chain of command is obvious- Howard to McDowell to Sherman, or vice versa, with all business elsewhere clearing through Sherman's Adjutant General.<br>
<br>
Superimposed on this pattern were various problems. Transportation to Lewiston was by river steamers up the Columbia and Snake Rivers, and between San Francisco and Portland by ocean-going vessels.  Lines of communication were also devious as the nearest telegraph station to Fort Lapwai was at Walla Walla-about 110 miles away.<br>
<br>
Communication with posts in Montana was difficult, in some cases involving trips of several hundred miles by couriers.<br>
When, on one occasion, the Indians tore down a telegraph line in western Montana, one message took several weeks to reach Howard, then in the field.<br>
<br>
After Perry's defeat, Howard sent the following message to Major H. C. Wood, his adjutant at Fort Vancouver:<br>
<br>
Order to Lewiston every available man in the Department except [those at Camps] Harney and Boise.  Start all troops at Carney and Boise except a small guard.  They <B>may </B>receive orders enroute turning them in this direction.  Lewiston will be my field depot at the present.  Quartermaster, Commissary and Medical staff to act accordingly.  I . . . wish these movements perfected in the shortest possible time.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, the posts in Alaska, also under Howard's supervision, were being evacuated.  On June 16, the steamship California had left Sitka with A, G, and M Companies of the Fourth Artillery on board.  Three days later the California stopped at Port Townsend, near the mouth of Puget Sound, to unload M Company and take on C Company of the Twenty-first Infantry.  
The boat was hardly out of sight before the commanding officer of M Company received orders to leave for the seat of trouble.  Taking a boat to Tacoma, and a train thence to the Columbia River, M Company rejoined their comrades in Portland.<br>
<br>
Thus, on June 19, Wood was able to inform Division Headquarters in San Francisco that:<br>
<br>
Companies 'E' and 'L', Whipple commanding, left Walla Walla overland for Lapwai this morning.  Companies A D G M [4th] Artillery and C [21st] Infantry will leave here Thursday morning [June 21st].  E Artillery and B E H Infantry at Wallula enroute.  Have <B>ordered </B> Jackson B <B>Cavalry </B>to <B>proceed </B>to Lewiston via Roseburg and Portland.  Have ordered one <B>rifled</B> gun, one howitzer and two gatlings and necessary ammunition from Vancouver Arsenal.<br>
Wood's telegram leaves much unsaid.  By the morning of June 18, the horses of Whipple's companies had already traveled over sixty miles across the Blue Mountains from the Wallowa-Grande Ronde country; and in the next two days they would cover an additional 110-120 miles.  A normal day's march for cavalry was considered to be about twenty-five miles, not sixty or more.<br>
<br>
Captain James B. Jackson and B Company of the First Cavalry were at Fort Klamath in southwestern Oregon, upwards of 300 miles south Of Portland.  They were destined to join Howard on July 12, on the second day of the bitterly contested battle beside the Clearwater River.<br>
<br>
While Major Wood was shipping all the troops which could be moved advantageously up the Columbia, he and McDowell's adjutant were taking steps to move all available units stationed in eastern Oregon, California, and northern Nevada overland to join Howard in the field.  The concentration point for this movement was the general vicinity of Boise City.<br>
<br>
Two officers of the First Cavalry were responsible for bringing these troops up once they were assembled.  These were Major John Green, then at Camp Harney in east central Oregon about 130 miles due west of Boise, and Major George B. Sanford at Camp Halleck in northeastern Nevada.<br>
<br>
<B>In addition to </B>utilizing a rather direct, though tedious route to the troubled area, Howard wished to position these troops between the Nez Perce and other Indians in the Weiser River country about whom he was concerned, a danger  which was more imagined than real.<br>

Most of the troops funnelled into the Boise area came, by way of the Central Pacific Railroad, to Winnemucca, Nevada. Then they marched northward, via Camp McDermit, on the Nevada-Oregon state line, and Boise City, over a rugged mountainous area.<br>
<br>
It was some 450 miles from Winnemucca to the scene of hostilities, and Howard apparently had little or no conception of the time con-
suming problems of such a movement.  That these movements were carried out smoothly, with proper logistic support provided where needed, stands as a silent tribute to the excellent staff work of McDowell's and Howard's adjutants.<br>
<br>
By June 20, General McDowell was able to report:<br>
<br>
[Howard] has at Lewiston and Lapwai, four companies of cavalry, two hundred and fifty-nine (259) men and three companies of infantry eighty eight (88) men.  There are enroute to Lewiston from the two departments six companies of cavalry, three hundred and fifty eight (358) men, five companies of Artillery, one hundred and sixty six (166) men, and three companies of infantry eighty nine (89) men.  Total force will be nine hundred and sixty (960)  men. Troops from Harney, MeDermitt and Halleck will probably move via Boise.<br>
<br>
Two weeks later he added:<br>
<br>
In addition to the troops heretofore reported as having been sent to Howard's Command, I have given him the company of 1st Cavalry [G Co.] from [Colonel] Kautz's Department of Arizona] at San Diego and sent the Light Battery of Artillery at the Presidio in San Francisco] as Mounted Infantry.<br>
<br>
These two messages indicate clearly that, although a considerable number of companies were involved, the manpower represented was not large.  Companies (or troops) of cavalry averaged about sixty men each, while the infantry and artillery (which fought as infantry on this campaign) were down to 30-35 men per unit.  Obviously, McDowell had stripped almost all the posts in his command down to small maintenance forces, and he had gone as far south as San Diego Barracks to get men.<br>
<br>
The "light battery of artillery" Battery B under the command of Captain Hasbrouck, was a makeshift outfit mounted on worn out artillery horses; shipped to Winnemucca, it plodded along with the column commanded by Major Sanford.  This column reached Howard as he was about to start to follow the Indians over the tortuous Lolo Trail.  As an artillery battery was obviously unsuited for the kind of campaigning that lay ahead, Howard ordered it to retrace
its steps to the Presidio.<br>
<br>
One very unusual movement took place early in the campaign.  Howard took the field himself as soon as the first troops arrived<br>
from Fort Walla Walla and Wallula.  On June 30, positioned about 180 miles from the telegraph station in Walla Walla, he wrote a telegram requesting General Sherman to transfer a regiment of infantry from the eastern part of the United States for permanent assignment to his Department.<br>
<br>
In this <B>he </B>concluded very optimistically that if the regiment were sent by rail to San Francisco, thence by steamer to Portland, it could get 110 Lewiston in fifteen days from Omaha.<br>
<br>
Howard forwarded the message to McDowell on July 2, and it went on to Washington the next day.  Finally it reached Sherman in St. Louis.  By July 5, Sherman's adjutant had notified McDowell that Sherman had approved the request, that the President had concurred, and that orders had been issued effective that date for the Second Infantry to proceed at once from Atlanta, Georgia to Lewiston-an action which, in the meantime, had also been cleared with General Hancock in New York.<br>
<br>
Compliance was not effected quickly.  Although the Second Infantry indicated that it would start on July 7, it was not until 6:00 A.M. on July 13 that the train left Atlanta with 416 men, their families, and their baggage.  This unit was transferred directly from the troop train to a waiting steamer in San Francisco and finally arrived in Lewiston on July 29.  When Howard left the fol-
lowing day to pursue the Indians over the Lolo Trail, he left these troops in Lewiston to garrison his rear.<br>
<br>
When the Second Infantry failed to arrive as promptly as was first anticipated, this became a matter of some concern for if the crest of the spring rise on the Snake River were to drop appreciably, transportation to Lewiston might become something of a problem.  To guard against this possibility, McDowell scraped the bottom of the barrel.  He ordered two under-manned companies of infantry up from Fort Yuma, Arizona.<br>
<br>
When these companies arrived in San Francisco, he added two equally weak companies of artillery and thirty-two green recruits and forwarded the lot up to Portland.  These reached Lewiston on June 19, the infantrymen from Fort Yuma having spent only eleven days enroute!<br>
<br>
Curiously, these troops had no more than reached Howard before
McDowell ordered them to return.  Serious labor riots had broken out all across the country.  The Division commander found himself in the embarrassing position of having no troops to maintain order in San Francisco.<br>
<br>
Howard, now ready to march to Montana, stalled McDowell's order until he had reached the eastern side of the Bitterroot Mountains.  There he ordered the companies in question to leave the column and march for Corrine, Utah (north to Salt Lake City), which was the nearest railroad station.  When these troops came through Deer Lodge, Montana, Colonel John Gibbon stopped them.<br>
<br>
As the Nez Perce had administered a sound whipping to some of his troops a few days previously, Gibbon countermanded McDowell's orders and sent the soldiers hurrying to join Howard again.<br>
<br>
Thus ended the troop movements within the Division of the Pacific-a remobilization which had involved troops in posts from Canada to Mexico, plus others from Alaska and Georgia.  However, not all of these troops were involved in the campaign outside of Idaho.  As noted, the Second Infantry was left to garrison the Lewiston area; and the troops which Major Green led up from Boise were left in the Mount Idaho area to perform similar duties.<br>
<br>
Battery B had to be ordered back.  Also relieved from further campaigning were those companies of the First Cavalry which had borne the brunt of the opening weeks of the campaign.<br>
<br>
Although this ended the frantic gathering of troops from distant points, it was by no means the end of all problems of troop move-
ments before the campaign ended.  When Generals Terry and Crook, commanding the Departments of Dakota and the Platte, respectively, were assigned to duty in riot-torn cities, General Sheridan, from his Chicago office, master-minded the handling of his "chessmen" in the Division of the Missouri.<br>
<br>
In Montana, troops had been mopping up after the trouble with the Sioux during, the preceding year and watching  Sitting Bull's followers who had taken refuge in Canada. However, when the Nez Perce entered the Bitterroot Valley south of Missoula, Gibbon hastily gathered all available men from post's near the western edge of the Montana prairies and marched to defeat in the Big Hole.<br>
<br>
Then Colonel Nelson A. Miles, from the Cantonment at the junction of the Tongue and Yellowstone Rivers, sent the Seventh Cavalry (still licking its wounds from the Custer disaster) to intercept
the Indians when they came out of the mountains.  But the Indians saw the Seventh first, decoyed them out of position, and then headed for Canada with a clear field ahead.<br>
<br>
Sheridan - in a move which, strangely, has gone unnoted - sent Colonel Wesley Merritt and the Fifth Cavalry racing <B>up</B> from Crook's Department to assist the Seventh in the contemplated confrontation.  But it arrived too late.  Howard finally devised a maneuver which brought a measure of success.  He asked Miles to take whatever troops were immediately available and attempt to position himself in the path of the Indians.<br>
<br>
Although Miles never got into the desired position, he was able-by means of a couple of fortunate circumstances to get near enough to strike the Indians' camp and set some of the Indians afoot.  Part of the camp fled to Canada.  The remainder, having resisted stubbornly for six grim days, finally surrendered.<br>
<br>
The victory was not complete.  Yet it concluded the struggle as far as fighting was concerned.  This ended the fascinating, moves of the chessmen of war.<br>

NEZ PERCE WAR DIARY.<br>
<br>
Frederick Mayer, "Nez Perce War Diary, 1877," <B>Idaho Historical Society, Seventeenth Biennial Report.</B> Boise: Idaho Historical Society, 1940, p. 27-31.<br>
<br>
A journel kept by Private Frederick Mayer, Troop L, First United States Cavalry during part of the Nez Perce Indian Campaign.<br>
<br>
In the Spring of 1877 the Nez Perce Indians became restless, and a war was expected.  "L" and "E" Troops receivedd Orders to leave Fort Walla Walla May 1st 1877 and go to Indian Valley, Oregon, to establish a permanent camp there.<br>
<br>
From this Detachment 10 men and 2 non commissioned Officers were sent out, and relieved every ten days, to guard the Indian trails, and watch their movements in Walowa Valley.<br>

June 15th, 1877 rc'd Orders by messinger to proceed at once to the seat of war, near Mount Idaho, I. T. We arrived there June 27th 1877.  Genl.  Howard, Comdg.  We joined the remainder of F and H Troops here.<br>
<br>
June 28th.  Marched to the mouth of White Bird canyon, where F and H Troops first met the Indians, and left the field to the Enemy.<br>
June 29th.  Marched down the canyon to bury the dead, of <B>"F" </B>and "H" Troops, 33 enlisted men, and 1st Lt.  Theller, Co. "G," 21st.  Infanry. (This was the most sickening sight I ever seen).<br>
<br>
These men were killed on the 15th and had been exposed to the sun, and rain to the 29th.  We could not handle the body's, but had to dig a hole by the side of each, ana roll the body in with the shovels and cover it with earth, and on top of it stones to keep the coyotes (Prairie wolfs) from digging them out again.<br>
<br>
June 30th.  Sent Scouts out to Reconoiter.  Camp'd in White Bird Canyon near Salmon River.  Pvt.  Reed, Troop "E", 1st Cavalry, shot through the shoulder by an Infantry Picked by mistake.  Lt.  Woods, 21st Infantry, Aide camp, mistakes a soldier for an Indian and shoots him.  He belonged to the 4th Artillery.  Guard and Picket numbered 84 men this night, the entire command consisted of 19 Co'. (Infantry, Artillery and Cavalry.)<br>
<br>
July 1st, 1877.  "L" and "E" Troops ordered to march to the South Fork of the "Clearwater" and capture a small band of renegades under Chief "Looking-glass," about 50 W,@rriors.  We started in light marching order about 9 p. m. and surprised the Indians about 5 a. m. the 2nd of July.  We succeeded in capturing their Ponies, 1500 head, and delivered them to the Citizens at Mount Idaho.<br>
<br>
From these we marched right on to Cottonwood Rancho, to entercept the main body of the Indians after they crossed the Salmon River.<br>
<br>
July 3rd.  Two Scouts were sent out to reconoiter, one (Foster) returned and reported that the Indians were 9 miles from camp, and the other scout killed.  Orders to pack up and move at once towards the Indians were given.  Lt.  S. ch. Rains, 2nd Lt. of my Troops "L", acting adjutant, left camp with the advance guard, the Sergeant Major and 10 men. (The advance guard were act.  Sergt.  Major Lambman, Privates Roach, Ryan, Burke and Quinn of "E" Troop, Privates Richter, Moody, Carroll, Deuteman and Meyer, and Lt.  Rains of L Troop.<br>
<br>
The command left about 5 minutes later; during the time that the
scout reported and the time of our getting ready to start out, the Indians came within 1 1/2 miles of our camp intending to surprise us, but seeing out advance guard coming they lay'd in a ravine at the foot of Craigs Mountain, Idaho, and allowed our guard to ride into the ambush prepared for them, and killed them all. (Lt.  Rains, Troop "L," and Pvt.  Ryan, Troop "E," almost succeeded in making their escape by clearing their way through the Indians again towards us, but there were too many for those brave men.)<br>
<br>
We heard rapid firing for a few minutes, but seen nothing more of our guard.  On our approach the Indians rallied on the Mountain, but they outnumbered us (three or four to One).  Besides, it being after sundown, and only about 56 men in Skirmish line, (after No. 4's were taken out to hold horses).  We had two good reasons not to give battle, so we formed a square around the horses, and retreated in good order (as they call <B>it)</B> to Cottonwood Rancho, some of the men growling because we did not attack the Indians, or look for our advance guard, but the more sensible ones guessed that either the guard were all killed or cut they'r way through to Ft.  Lapaway.<br>
<br>
Anyway what was done, was right.<br>
<br>
July 4th 1877.  Started out to meet "F" Troop with a supply train from Ft.  Lapaway, and escort them through the woods.  Going out we found the body's of our advanceguard the day before, but we had to pass them, in order to meet "F" Troop a-ad help them out in case of attack.  On our return with "F" Troop we intented to bury the dead, and we did start to dig the graves, but before we could bury any of the men, the Indians attacked us, from the woods and rocks at the base of Craigs Mountain.<br>
<br>
They being under cover and we in the open field of course we had to retreat to Cottonwood, where we intrenched ourselfs quickly, but none too soon.  The Indians surrounded us soon after, and kept up a steady fire until dark.<br>
<br>
July 5th.  The Indians opened fire at day-break and kept it up until noon.  At that time we could see a small party approaching from Mount Idaho to our aid, but the Indians cut them off, and a hot skirmish took place, until one of our Troops was mounted and charged iii among the Indians and saved the remainder of the party.  The party were 17 men from Mount Idaho, who volunteered to come to our aid thinking we NN,ere iii danger, but 5 of them were killed and two wounded before we rescued them from the Savages.<br>
<br>
After this the entire command of 3 troops mouilted and charged on
the Indians and drove theiii towards the Clearwater River.<br>
July 6th.  Went out and buried the body's of Lt.  Rain's paity, except the body of Lt.  Rains, which was taken to Cottonwood rancho, and a rough coffin made for it.<br>
<br>
July 7th.  Buried Lt.  Rains at Cottonwood Rancho with Military Honors.<br>
<br>

NEZ PERCE WAR OF 1877<br>
<br>
Duncan MacDonald, "The Nez Perces: the history of their troubles and the campaign of 1877,"  <B>Idaho Yesterdays.</B> XXI (Winter, 1978), p. 2-10. (Part two of a series).<br>
<br>
From April of 1878 through March of 1879, the Deer Lodge (Montana) New North-West published a series of articles on the Nez Perce war as seen by White Bird and his associates.<br>
<br>
The author of the series was Duncan MacDonald, son of the Hudson's Bay Company's Angus MacDonald and a sister of the Nez Perce leader Eagle of the Light.  MacDonald was thoroughly fluent in both Nez Perce and English, and he spent some time interviewing White Bird and his companions in Canada after the war.  The first part of MacDonalds narrative-taking the Nez Perce to Lo Lo Pass was published in the Spring, 1977, Idaho Yesterdays.<br>
<br>
The rest of the story is reproduced here, spelling and punctuation unaltered.  Some segments of the narrative have been put in proper chronological order, with explanatory notes.  MacDonald's own explanation of his position and of some problems he faced is worth noting.<br>
<br>
"Now while I deny having the slightest sympathy with murderers or ruffians of any description, whether white or red, I claim the admitted fact that there are generally two sides to a question and one side of the difficulty with the Nez Perces being pretty well understood, I have been prevailed upon to give, to the best of my ability the other, or, Indian version.<br>
<br>
And both being provided it is more likely that a method of evading such difficulties may be more readily arrived at.  Should humble contributions happen, in any degree, to procure such a disideratum, I shall be more than repaid for any trouble I have taken in gathering data .... I would add that while endeavoring not only to keep within the limits of strict truth, but also to eliminate exaggeration any obscurity in description of incidents must be met with some allowance of an ignorance on the part of Indians with regard to dates, and also, in some instances, of civilized names of localities render impossible a more definite
writing.<br>
<br>
I may here add a remark which I hope those who take the trouble to read these papers will bear in mind, applicable throughout.  Objections may be made to my translations of Indian speeches, etc., the objectors no doubt supposing that words and phrases used are foreign to Indian thought.  To such I only give an assurance that in every instance my aim is and shall be to convey as correct an expression as I am capable of giving of the speech or conversation translated.<br>
<br>
Be it known, however that my command of the English language is by no means adequate to give a fair idea of the capacity of even a moderate Indian speaker.  There are, I believe, few white men who, in variety of expression, vividness of description, intonation, or even grace of action, surpass the first-class orators of the Red Men, and in this belief I have no doubt I will be joined by white men who in this matter have the means and power of judging.<br>
<br>
When the Nez Perces camp reaching the Hot Springs  on  the  Lo  Lo  trail,  not  far  from Bitter Root valley, three Indians met them in their camp.  One of these Indians was a Nez Perces, but his home was in the Bitter Root valley.  He told Looking Glass there were some soldiers on the trail watching for them to come.<br>
<br>
Looking Glass said he did not want any troubles on this side of the Lo Lo range; that he did not want to fight either soldiers or citizens east of the Lo Lo, because they were not the ones who had fought them in Idaho. The idea among the Indians, uneducated as they   were,   was   that  the   people   of   Montana    had    no identity  with  the  people   of   Idaho,   and   that   they   were entirely separate and distinct, having nothing to do<br>
with  each  other.<br>
<br>
If  they  had to fight they believed it was   Idaho   people   they  should fight, and not Montanans. Looking Glass   therefore   gave  orders to his warriors  that  in   case   they   should   see   any   white   men, either  citizens  or  soldiers,  on  the  Lo  Lo,  not   to  molest them unless as   they    had    compelled    him  in Idaho, these citizens or soldiers should compel them to   fight in self defense.  He said: "We are going to buffalo country.  We want to go through the settlements quietly. We do not wish to harm any one if we can help it."<br>
<br>
The chief then sent an Indian called John Hill and two others in advance of his camp while coming down the Lo Lo.  These three came to a post of four or five white-men. This was Captain [E.  A. I Kinney's camp and this was the night John Hill was arrested and
taken to camp.<br>
<br>
Hill told Kinney the chiefs had sent him ahead to ascertain if the Nez Perce camp could pass through peaceably.  Hill was sent back to invite the chiefs to come to the white man's camp, saying that these white men wished to see the chiefs.  This was on Wednesday. Looking Glass immediately Started down with a band of warriors to meet Capt. Kinney of the volunteers.<br>
<br>
When Looking Glass reached Kinney's camp, the chief reiterated to him that he did not wish to harm the whites east of the Lo Lo mountains; that it was true he had fought the soldiers in Idaho when he was compelled to- that he did <B>not</B> want to fight any more, and that he only wanted permission to go through to buffalo country.<br>
<br>
At this time the Nez Perces believed that Sitting Bull still retained possession of the Yellowstone country and that if the soldiers still pursued them they could join Sitting Bull.  Kenney replied that he had no authority to treat with them but appointed a council for the next day in the afternoon.<br>
<br>
By this time Captain [Charles C.] Rawn was preparing in the Lo Lo a splendid trap for Looking Glass and his band.  Looking Glass knew nothing about this trap.  He only thought the soldiers were camped in the customary manner, and had no idea of entrenchments being prepared to obstruct the passage of himself and warriors.<br>
<br>
Readers, I do not wish my motives misconstrued in giving Looking Glass the leading position in these movements and councils.  I am not censuring Joseph when I do not give him preference, nor am I influenced by kinship with Looking Glass.  My statements are simply the truth of history.<br>
<br>
I know it was understood, and probably is yet, by nearly all that Joseph was the commanding chief of the Nez Perces forces during the war and that he really is the man who should have credit for the good work in restraining his warriors from excesses in their passage <B>into</B> and through Bitter Root.  It is an error.  Joseph was <B>a</B> good man but he had nothing to do with the camp, after Looking Glass joined it near Cottonwood, <B>only</B> by following it to shelter himself from the retributive hands of the white man.<br>
<br>
It was Looking Glass who saved many a white man's life during the campaign: he was commander; as he ordered, camp was moved <B>or</B> remained stationary and what military credit is due for the conduct of that campaign is due to him.  Knowing Looking Glass to be well known to many whites, and that he was entitled to his reputation as a really good, kind-hearted Red Man, I submit these
facts , incidentally, to correct a popular error.<br>
<br>
White Bird was a fighting cock, but, with the exception of an in-
stance on Salmon River, he awaited orders from his superior chiefs.<br>
<br>
While the Nez Perces were camped on the Lo Lo, above the fortifications, and it was supposed they  could not get past "the corral" without surrender Joseph said to Looking Glass, "Let us go on.  I allowed to pass, we will fight our way through Lo Lo and next fight our way through Montana.  We want peace, but the whites want us to be kept in the Lo Lo canon.  Let us go through the best way we can, whether it is by peace or war."<br>
<br>
Looking Glass answered: "Did you, or did you not, with other chiefs, elect me for leader through this country, because I knew it and the people, and did you not promise that I should have the whole command and do as I please? You and the other chiefs told me these words.  Now, Joseph, I wish to know if you are going to break your promise.<br>
<br>
"If you are anxious to fight I will withdraw my people and you can fight as pleases you.  I fight when I cannot avoid it, but not otherwise.  Still I can fight my battles as well as anybody.  At the fortifications in our way there are some Flatheads aiding the whites.  If we fight the whites we must fight the Flatheads.  Some of them are our relations.  Now you can make your choice."<br>
<br>
Joseph replied: "You are right, Looking Glass.  We did elect you head man of the camp.  Go ahead and do the best." So Looking Glass remains in supreme command.<br>
<br>
Capt.  Rawn's camp, where he had erected rifle pits <B>in </B>the canon, was about sixteen miles from Missoula and about four miles above the mouth of Lo Lo.  The mountains on the south side of Lo Lo are precipitous and densely covered with standing timber, so that es-
cape on that side was impossible.  On the north side grassy ridges stretched away from the stream, allowing a passage <B>in </B>almost any direction.<br>
<br>
On Thursday Looking Glass and White Bird met Captain Rawn and a few armed men and shook hands with Rawn.  Of course the latter wanted the feather in his hat and told Looking Glass he must give up his arms.  Captain Rawn and Looking Glass then appointed
another day to have a talk.<br>
<br>
Looking Glass returned to his camp and told his warriors the conditions demanded for them to treat upon.  By this time they well knew about "The Corral," as Looking Glass termed Rawn's fortifications.  The Indians thought it was ridiculous to give up their arms to the foes, White Bird made a speech and said:<br>
<br>
"We remember a big war that took place once on the Columbia river.  The United States troops fought against the Yakimas, Kayuses, Umatillas, Spokanes and Coeur d'Alenes. Colonel [George] Wright was the big chief of the soldiers.  After many battles the Indians were defeated.  Colonel Wright told the Indians that if they would surrender he would treat them well and hurt no one but the murderers.  On these conditions the Indians surrendered.<br>
<br>
"Then Colonel Wright hung many innocent Indians.  Some of <B>them </B>deserved hanging, but many others hands were clear of white men's blood.  These soldiers camped below us are of the same kind.  How do we know but that Joseph, Looking Glass and others will be hung immediately after we surrender?<br>
<br>
"The officer tells us he does not know who will be hung; that the government has to decide on that question." There were manifestations of approval when White Bird had spoken.<br>
<br>
Looking Glass said, "Yes.  We do not want to fight.  I tried to surrender in Idaho but my offer was rejected.  The soldiers came upon my camp and the <B>first</B> thing I knew the bullets were flying around my head. The soldiers lie so that I have no more confidence in them.  They have had their way for a long time; now we must have ours.  We must go to buffalo country. if we are not allowed to go peaceably we shall do the best we can.<br>
<br>
"If the officer wishes to build corrals for the Nez Perces he may, but they will not hold us back.  We are not horses.  The country is large.  I think we are as smart as he is and know the roads and mountains as well."<br>
<br>
The Nez Perces, however, concluded to have another council and try to make peace without giving up their arms, the Indian way of making treaties.  On Friday Capt.  Rawn made his appearance about a half mile below the Indian village with about 100 men and halted.  An Indian by the name of Pierre, a Flathead was sent forward by the officer.  When Looking Glass saw so many men near his camp he thought they had come to fight.<br>

Looking Glass returned word by Pierre that he would meet Captain Rawn, unarmed, halfway between the forces.  The council was held and Looking Glass proposed to surrender all the ammunition of the camp as a guarantee that the Indians intended to go through the country peaceably.<br>
<br>
When told that nothing but an unconditional surrender would be ac-
cepted, he asked for another meeting next day to give him time to consult with the other chiefs.  Captain Rawn told him that any further communication he had to make must be made under a fla@, of truce at the fortified camp.<br>
<br>
On considering the matter further the Indians determined not to trust themselves under the condition demanded.  They thought perhaps the white man was anxious to make peace, but still they feared treachery.  I remember hearing Delaware Jim, the acting interpreter, relate that when Rawn met Looking Glass and demanded the surrender of the Indian guns, Looking Glass replied through the interpreter, "If you want my arms so bad you can start in taking them.  I made up my mind before leaving Idaho that we would talk with the white man only through our guns.<br>
<br>
"When I promise I fulfill and do not lie as the white man does.  When a Cinnamon travels he carries no arms.  Do you think I am a Cinnamon? <B>It </B>is foolish to think of a whole camp going to the buffalo country and not carrying a single gun."<br>
<br>
On Saturday Looking Glass ordered camp to be raised and directed the women to travel on the north side of Lo Lo until they passed the "Nez Perces Corral," then cross the Lo Lo and turn in a southerly direction up Bitter Root Valley.  The warriors were to cover the movement.<br>
<br>
The camp moved.  The soldiers and volunteers got into position in the earthworks and while they were uselessly standing to arms the Indians passed deliberately by without any fight whatever.<br>
<br>
I desire to mention Captain Rawn's connection with the passage of the Lo Lo fortifications.  It has been discussed whether he acted cowardly or not in permitting the Nez Perces to pass.  The Nez Perces gave him credit for wisdom in not opening fire on them. The bravest of their warriors would have done the same.  Had he attacked them he would have been severely whipped.<br>
<br>
It is a well known fact that the biggest "Indian eaters" at Lo Lo were less courageous than those who professed less.<br>
<br>
          
When the Indians were marching past the fortifications and down Lo Lo, the voice of Looking Glass could be distinctly heard addressing his warriors:<br>
<br>
"Don't shoot, don't shoot.  Let the white men shoot first." This he repeated over and over.  All this time the soldiers and volunteers kept their positions in the breastworks.  When the volunteers saw that Captain Rawn would not fire on the Indians, some of them started down the stream to head them off.<br>
<br>
Looking Glass was on the alert for a movement of this kind, and placed his best warriors between the volunteers and his women, children and pack-horses-in fact, as they passed down the women and children were advanced ahead and the warriors held back to act as a rear guard.<br>
<br>
As they were moving down Lo Lo they saw these volunteers dashing down Lo Lo with <B>the</B> evident purpose of cutting off the women and children.  At the sight of this the warriors believed certainly that they were going to have a fight, and started with a yell in the direction of the volunteers.  Capt.  Rawn, seeing the demonstrations of the volunteers, and believing a collision was likely to occur between them and the Nez Perces, dispatched a half-breed named Matte and a few Flatheads to ascertain whether a fight occurred and to report to him immediately.<br>
<br>
While Matte and his Flatheads were proceeding down Lo Lo they met John Scott riding rapidly back toward Rawn's camp.  He had his hat in his hand using it as a whip and his war horse was putting in his best licks.  On meeting Matte he told him an engagement was going on, that the volunteers were fighting.  He wanted Matte to turn back lest he should be killed.  But Matte kept on as he was ordered by Rawn, who desired to reinforce the volunteers if they engaged the Nez Perces.<br>
<br>
Matte came in sight of the volunteers but as the Nez Perces warriors started for them the Indian eaters thought sure they had seen their last day, and stampeded up Lo Lo toward Rawn's camp.<br>
<br>
A few halted when they had gone a little distance or when they had reached Matte and the Flatheads.  Looking Glass and his warriors had swift horses and could have intercepted them in their line of retreat and in case of a fight would have cut them off from Rawn, and had the two parties at their mercy.<br>
<br>
The builders of <B>the  </B>Lo Lo fortifications may have thought they were <B>a </B>shelter; but they were mistaken.  The rifle pits were<br>
exposed on one side, and on that side there was a steep mountain,
<br>
covered with trees, fallen timber and rocks, affording excellent cover for the Indian sharpshooters, from which they could have picked off those in the rifle pits at their leisure.<br>
<br>
It is true that there were a few splendid shots in the force, but two-thirds of them were not, and all the Indians were hunters, ex-
perienced fighters and good marksmen.<br>
<br>
I remember White Bird said that if war had opened on Lo Lo the whole country would have been fired, and many a farmer would have lost his crops and home and perhaps his scalp.  <B>It  </B>is  probable  that they would then have moved north through  the  Flathead   reservation.  Whatever  the  chiefs  of  the  Reserve  and  Bitter Root valley may have  said  about  the  peaceable  disposition of their Indians, and that  there  was  no  danger  of their  joining  the  Nez  Perces  was  a   mistake.<br>
<br>
There were Indians  on  the  Bitter  Root  and  Flathead  reserve who had their guns ready  for  use  if  a  battle  occurred     at Lo Lo. Indians  had  been  whispering  at  these  places long before the hostiles  reached  Lo  Lo.  The  writer  of these  papers  stated  in  Missoula  before  ever  Walatze, Tap-sis-il-pilp and  Um-till-lip-cown  raised  their  hands in Idaho that  a  Nez  Perces  war  would  soon  break  out in that Territory.<br>
<br>
His  prediction  was  laughed  at.  Who     a would believe  that  the  Nez  Perces  would  take  to  the war-path? The situation was  but  little  less  threatening with some  of  the  Flatheads  and  Pend'Oreilles  in  Missoula county.<br>
<br>
While  the  camp  was  moving  ...  the  Indians   captured<br>
Henry  McFarland, Jack  Walsh  and  another   man.   These men  were  volunteers.  Looking  Glass   told   them   they      could go home  and  attend  to  their  own  business.  During the day several  white  men  fell  into  the  hands  of     a the Nez Perces, and  to  all  of  them  Looking  Glass  repeated  the  remark,   "Go   home   and   mind   your   own business; we will harm no man."<br>
<br>
That evening the Nez Perces made camp on Mc-Lain's place, about eight  miles  above  the  mouth  of  Lo     Lo, in Bitter Root Valley.<br>
<br>
....  The  same  evening   W.   J.   Stephens   and   about<br>
50  or  60  volunteers  reached   the   camp   of   Looking<br>
Glass. The old chief himself was  the  first  one  to  meet<br>
and speak  to  them.  Some  of  these  volunteers  were  on<br>
their way back to their  homes  in  the  Bitter  Root  valley, 
<br>
and  had  run  into  the  Nez  Perces  camp  unintentionally.<br>
<br>
Doubtless  some of them thought their lives not  very  valuable  when  they found themselves encompassed by the Nez  Perces.  Looking  Glass  well  knew  the facts. He said to  them,  "You  are  volunteers;  you  come over to fight us.  I could kill you if I wanted to, but I do not.  We have many women and children.  I dc not care for my own life, but I have pity for them.  You can go to your homes.  I give you my word of honor that I will harm nobody." After this talk the volunteers dispersed in all directions for their homes.<br>
<br>
About this same time three Nez Perces arrived at the Flathead agency.  They came direct from the Yellowstone country via Missoula.  Eagle-of the-Light was at that time camped at Flathead agency and they came here to see him and exchange news.  These three Indians had been acting as scouts for General [Nelson A.] Miles, looking after Sitting Bull Sioux on the Yellowstone, but while on a scout in that valley they were told by some white men that the Nez Perces had broken out in Idaho, and they deserted Miles to go to their homes in Idaho.<br>
<br>
The name of the head man of these three was Grizzly Bear Youth.  He acted like a grizzly bear in the Big Hole Battle.  This man [line illegible] Sioux and always got away with the white feather.  When he learned the hostile Nez Perces were on the Lo Lo trail he remained at the agency waiting for them to pass Missoula county.  He was at the agency about one week.  The news reached Missoula that these three Indians were at the agency obtaining cartridges from the trader, Duncan McDonald, and it caused quite a disturbance of public feeling.<br>
<br>
But it was an error.  These three men had a pack mule, but it was for their blankets and cooking utensils and not to pack cartridges.  During the stay here of Grizzly Bear Youth he found how near this point is to the National Boundary line, and he thought he would go over to Lo Lo and see Looking Glass and tell him.  Grizzly Bear Youth was, however, one of Lawyer's Nez Perces, was rich in horses, and desired himself to get back to the reserve in Idaho, for even before this he tried to go through by the other route, but after reaching Horse Plains, 45 miles from the agency, he turned back, thinking it was not safe to attempt to get through that way.<br>
<br>
Duncan McDonald told him he had better go by Lo Lo trail and surrender to Howard.<br>
<br>
Accordingly, the three Nez Perces started from the agency, on Sunday afternoon, for the Lo Lo trail.  Before leaving, Grizzly
Bear Youth said here that if he should see Looking Glass he would try to influence the Nez Perces to go through the Flathead reservation to Tobacco Plains and not through the settlements of the Territory.<br>
<br>
When he reached Lo Lo, he found that the Nez Perces camp was only a few miles above, and he concluded he might go over and see his relations, although he did not purpose to join the camp.  Before dismounting from his horse he told the chiefs they were a band of fools; that it was folly for a handful of Indians to think of fighting the United States government.  After dismounting he went to Looking Glass and White Bird and told them what he thought it best for them to do, that was to turn back and go by the Flathead reservation and Flathead Lake to the British possessions.<br>
<br>
Looking Glass then called a council and told Joseph and the others what Grizzly Bear Youth had said.  White Bird and Red Owl agreed: They wanted to go by the reserve.  Joseph did not say a word.  Looking Glass wanted to go by Big Hole and down the Yellowstone and join the Crows, according to agreement, because the Crows had promised them that whenever the Nez Perces fought the whites they would join them.<br>
<br>
There was a disagreement, but after quarrelling among themselves they concluded it was best to let Looking Glass have his way.  Ibis council was held about a mile or a mile and a half above McLain's ranch, on the Bitter Root.<br>
<br>
After raising camp at McLain's there was still some discussion as to the route to be taken-whether to the British Possessions through the Flathead reservation, or to the Yellowstone via the Big Hole.  If forced to fight they proposed to join the Sioux or Crows in the Yellowstone country; if not, they designed after get-
ting their dried meat to return to Idaho the next Spring.<br>
<br>
Finally Looking Glass urged that he wanted to go by Big Hole, because he knew the country better, and although this was only a pretext, as they could have found their way just as well northward, his wishes were respected and they started up Bitter Root.<br>
<br>
On reaching the place of Charlos, the Flathead chief, Looking Glass summoned a number of his warriors to accompany him to visit Charles and inquire of him where the best place to camp was to find good grass.  On approaching Charlos' house Looking Glass thought it would be honorable to extend his hand to Charlos before making his inquiry.  But Charlos refused to accept the extended hand, saying, "Why should I shake hands with men whose hands are
bloody? My hands are clean of blood."<br>
<br>
Looking Glass replied: "Your hands are as red with the blood of your enemies as mine are.  Why should my hands be clean when I have been forced to fight the white man? Your hands are as bloody as ours.  I did not come to talk about blood.  I came to ask you the best place to camp." Charlos answered: "Above my house is the best spot to camp," and there they accordingly pitched their tents.<br>
<br>
Looking Glass kept close watch of his warriors while camped near Stevensville, in which town they did considerable trading.  He sent several to camp for being disorderly.  It was very fine for the officers sitting in camp and indulging in strong drink to con-
demn the people of Stevensville for selling these Indians goods and provisions, and allege that they were aiding the Nez Perces to recruit for their march, and that they should be punished therefor.<br>
<br>
This talk was something like Howard's.  Their words have more force than their deeds.  These Nez Perces would never stand before a little town like Stevensville and perish of starvation when plenty could be had there.<br>
<br>
The Nez Perces under Looking Glass offered to buy from the first, but if they had been refused and obliged to resort to that measure they would have plundered, Had as many soldiers as there were men been stationed in Stevensville, and a band of starving Nez Perces like these been refused food, the soldiers with all the laws of the United States on their side would have lasted but a short time.  It was fortunate for Stevensville that citizens and not soldiers had possession of it.  Under the circumstances the citizens of Stevensville did right.<br>
<br>
An incident happened during the time of the encampment near Stevenville that illustrates the indisposition of the Nez Perces to have any conflict with the people of Montana.  A citizen wished to visit the Indian camp.  He mounted his best riding horse, and, accompanied by a half breed who had presented Looking Glass with fifty pounds of flour, rode thereto.  It should be remembered that Looking Glass had no lodge nor even cooking utensils.<br>
<br>
He camped in the open air and received his means from his warriors.  He was so glad to receive as a visitor the half breed who had presented him with the sack of flour, that he invited him to have a smoke.  He noticed the actions of the citizen and told
him there was a certain portion of the camp which it would be best for him to visit-that some of their relations had been killed in Idaho, and it was not best for him to go near them.<br>
<br>
The citizen, however, wanted to trade off his horse for a fortune and went charging around the camp promiscuously, making his steed prance and caper, and asking the Nez Perces three of their good horses for one.  He had many good offers to trade, but always refused.<br>
<br>
In any other camp than the Nez Perces he would have been packed off, and that would have been the last of him and his funny horse.  In one of his circuits he went to that part of the camp which he had been advised by Looking Glass to avoid.  A wounded Nez Perces, some of whose relations had been killed in Idaho, was standing by a log and resting on his gun.<br>
<br>
On seeing the white man cavorting around in an impudent way, the Indian  said  in  English,  "Me  give  you three  horses;  my  horses  very  good  one."  The   white man refused. It seemed that  he  only  wanted  to  put  on style. This made  the  warrior  angry  and  he  exclaimed,<br>
<br>
"You go home, you d--n white man; you... It  was wonder he was not killed. But he left  hastily,  and  if that funny horse of his had a 1:40 gait  in  him,  it  was brought out as the citizen lit out for Stevensville.<br>
<br>
Not being acquainted with the country above Stevensville, I am unable to designate the other camping places.  An  incident,  however, occurred near the head of Bitter  Root  valley, at  [Myron  M.]  Lockwood's      ranch, I believe, which I wish to relate.<br>
<br>
A  certain  band of  the  Nez  Perces  were  under  command   of   T-whool-we-tzoot,  the  same  Indian  who  was  made  prisoner  by Howard in  Idaho  when  he  was  elected  Speaker  of  the<br>
tribe at the council. This  was  the  worst  band  in  the<br>
whole  camp,  and  a  very  unruly  lot.<br>
<br>
While   passing Lockwood's  ranch,  some  of  this  band  went  into   the cabin and helped  themselves  to  about  200  pounds  of flour, 30 or 40 pounds of coffee, one file, two  or  three<br>
shirts, and some other small articles.  On  reaching  camp<br>
they  went  to  Looking  Glass  and  told  him  what  they<br>
had done.  Looking  Glass  was  very  angry  and  told  T-     whool-we-tzoot that unless they  obeyed  his  orders  they     should
<br>
be put out of the camp. He said he would not<br>
permit   plundering,   and   demanded   seven   head    of<br>
horses from those Indians  as  payment  for  the  articles<br>
they  had  stolen.<br>
<br>
The  thieves  consented  to  give   up seven head of horse's and leave them  at  the  ranch,  but Looking Glass would not be  satisfied  until  they  branded the horses with  Lockwood's  brand  and  left  them  at his ranch.  I  understand  that  Lockwood,  not  satisfied with the seven horses left him,  went  on  the  war  path, joined  Gibbon's  command,  got  shot  at  the  Big   Hole battle and lost his brother at the same place.<br>
<br>
While traveling slowly toward Big  Hole, dragging their lodge  poles,  White  Bird  went  to  Looking Glass and said:<br>
<br>
"Why  do  you  allow  the  camp  to  drag  lodge  poles?<br>
By the way you  are  acting  you  seem  to  anticipate  no<br>
danger.  How  do  we  know  but  that  some  of  these  days<br>
or  nights  we  shall  be  attacked  by  the   whites.   We<br>
should be prepared for trouble.  Let your lodge poles be destroyed and move as rapidly as possibly without them to the buffalo plains."<br>
<br>
Looking Glass answered: "That is all nonsense and@ bosh.  Who is going to trouble us? What wrong <B>did</B> we do in passing through the Bitter Root settlements I think that we did very well in going through the country peaceably with a band of hostiles like we have got.  We are in no hurry.  The little bunch of soldiers from Missoula are not fools enough to attack us.  We had best take the world as easily as possible,.  We are not fighting with the people of this country."<br>
<br>
White Bird replied: "Well, it is no harm to be prepared.  We know the whites want us to surrender our arms to them.  We were told while in the Bitter Root valley there were soldiers and volunteers all over the country, in front and rear, looking for us.  If they want us to surrender our arms to them they will have to fight for them."<br>
<br>
Looking Glass said, "Oh, there is no danger."<br>
<br>
"All right," replied White Bird.<br>
<br>
Another Indian, well known among themselves as a "medicine man," said to the chiefs a day before the battle of Big Hole, "What are
we doing here?" After singing his song he continued, "While I slept my medicine told me to move on, that Death is approaching us.  Chief, I only tell you this because it may be of some good to this camp.<br>
<br>
"If you take my advise we can avoid death, and that advice is to speed through this country.  If not, there will be tears in our eyes in a short time."<br>
<br>
Now, reader, let me explain about Indian "medicine." The Indian's belief may seem ridiculous to civilized people, but the Indians believe in their "medicine" as implicitly as Ignatius Loyola or the Jesuits believed or believe in Christ, or a Cinnamon believes in Confucius.<br>
<br>
The Indian medicine man goes to the mountains and starves himself for several days to obtain his "medicines." So long as his stomach contains any food whatever he can obtain no "medicine." His system must be purified from all edible matter, his body must be made clean by ablutions, and he must have faith that his desires for "medicine" will be granted. These "medicines" are chiefly beasts, fowls, insects and fishes of all kinds, which come to him and tell him what is going to happen.  It seems the Spiritualists have somewhat similar beliefs.<br>
<br>
I am not speaking of the semi-civilized tribes, but of the native Indians in their wildest state.  Their super<B>stition </B>on this point has cost many a life.  The writer of these papers has had many difficulties because he does [not?] choose to believe in what the medicine men say.  It is not strange.<br>
<br>
A man in the South of Ireland who abused a priest might be killed by some devout believer.  The Indians are as fixed in their belief in the medicine man.  I do not ask readers to believe as they do; I am, however, explaining a matter that has a great deal to do with the actions of Indians.<br>
<br>
When the medicine man had advised the chiefs what to do, Looking Glass, although he protested his inability to see where danger was to come from, ordered camp to be moved forward, and they camped that night on the Big Hole battle ground.  The Nez Perces say they had seen white men moving down the distant hills.  These were some of Bradley's scouts, who have believed they were not discovered by the Indians.<br>
<br>
They gave the matter little attention.  They thought they were merely scouts watching their movements, a surveillance to which they had become accustomed, and they knew that the little band of soldiers that had tried to bar their passage of the Lo Lo was
following them.  They did not know this little band had been reinforced by Gibbon's command from Fort Shaw.  They had no idea they would be attacked by the LO LO soldiers.<br>
<br>
On the night they camped at the battle ground the most of the warriors were up until a late hour engaged in their war dance.  This caused a deep sleep to fall on them after they went to their lodges.  Some of them slept so soundly they never awakened.  'ne camp, not apprehending danger, was sleeping soundly, when suddenly the rifles of the soldiers belched forth their deadly fire, and the camp was awakened to find their enemies plunging through it dealing death and destruction in every direction.<br>
<br>
General [John] Gibbon had all the advantage of a complete surprise.<br>
<br>
With the soldiers in the midst of their camp before they were even awakened, those who could fled to the brush along the brook.  Here it was that White Bird and Looking Glass displayed the valor of true chieftains, rallied their warriors from a rout, and plucked a victory from the very jaws of defeat.  White Bird was the first to rally his warriors to a charge upon the soldiers.<br>
<br>
"Why are we retreating?" he shouted in Nez Perces.  "Since the world was made brave men fight for their women and children.  Are we going to run to the mountains and let the whites kill our women and children before our eyes? It is better we should be killed fighting.  Now is our time; fight! These soldiers cannot fight harder than the ones we defeated on Salmon river and in White Bird Canon.<br>
<br>
"Fight! Shoot them down.  We can shoot as well as any of these soldiers." At these words the warriors wheeled around and started back to fight the soldiers in their camp.<br>
<br>
Looking Glass was at the other end of the camp.  His voice was heard calling out, "Wallitze! Tap-sis-ilpilp! Um-til-lilp-cown! this is a battle! These men are not asleep as were those you murdered in Idaho! These soldiers mean battle.  You tried to break my promise at Lo Lo.  You wanted to fire at the fortified place.  Now is the time to show your courage and fight.  You can kill right and left.<br>
<br>
"I would rather see you killed than the rest of the warriors, for you commenced the war.  Now, go ahead and fight." The warriors addressed were so angered and aroused they did not care for their lives, and rallied to the charge with those led by White Bird.  Some of them said they had heard the white man was a good fighter,
but he seemed to fight best when his enemy was asleep.<br>
<br>
Many women and children were killed before getting out of their beds.  In one lodge there were five children.  One soldier went into it and killed every one of them.  When the warriors rallied and opened fire they poured their shot into the soldiers so rapidly and effectually that they suffered considerable loss and soon retreated to a point of timber near the trail.<br>
<br>
In the midst of the hottest of the fight Tap-sis-ill-pilp was killed.  Wallitze, on being told his companion was dead, ran right into the soldiers and was shot down dead in his tracks.  Thus did two of the three murderers who brought on the war expiate their offense, and it is due to them to say that they died as brave as the bravest.<br>
<br>
Before these two men were killed an episode of interest occurred at the lodges.  In a fight between an officer and a warrior, the warrior was shot down dead.<br>
<br>
The warrior's  sister  was  standing  by  him  when  he  fell,<br>
and as he lay there his  six-shooter  lay  by  his  side.  The<br>
woman  seeing  her  brother  dying  and  the   blood   running<br>
from his mouth, seized the  six-shooter,  leveled  it  at  the<br>
<br>
officer,  fired,  shot  him  through  the  head   and   killed<br>
him.  From  all  the  information  I  can  obtain,  I  believe<br>
the officer was Captain [William] Logan.<br>
<br>
While  the  soldiers  were   retreating   across   to   the<br>
timber,   Grizzly   Bear   Youth   followed   them   and   was     ii<br>
doing  rapid  work  with  his  Henry  rifle.  If  I   remember<br>
correctly the description  there  was  a  crossing  or  slough<br>
the  soldiers  had  to  go  over  that  impeded  them.   While<br>
the  soldiers  were  at  this   place   a   volunteer   turned<br>
around   and   commenced   damning   the   Indians    lustily.<br>
<br>
He is described as a  tall,  ugly  looking  man,  and  I  will<br>
describe  the  incident  following  as  it  was   related   to<br>
me  by  Grizzly  Bear  Youth  last   summer   at   the   Sioux<br>
camp near Fort Walsh:<br>
<br>
"When I was following  the  soldiers,  trying  to  kill  as<br>
many of  them  as  possible,  a  big,  ugly  volunteer  turned<br>
around  swearing  and  made  for  me.   I   suppose   he   had<br>
no time to load his needle  gun,  so  he  swung  it  over  his<br>
head by the barrel and rushed at me to strike me over the head with
<br>
the butt end.  I did he same thing. We  both struck and each received a  blow  on  the  head.<br>
<br>
The volunteer's gun put a brand on my forehead that will be seen as long as I live.  My blow on his head made him fall on his back. I jumped on him and tried to hold him down. The volunteer was a powerful man.<br>
<br>
He turned me over and got on top. He got his hand on my throat and commenced choking me. I was almost gone and had just strength left  to make signs to a warrior, who was coming up, to shoot him. This was Red  Owl's  Son,  who  ran  up,  put  his  needle  gun  to the volunteer's  side  and  fired.  The  ball  passed  through him  and  killed  him.  But  I   had   my   arm   around   the waist  of  the  man  when  the  shot  was   fired,   and   the ball  after  going  through  the  volunteer  broke  my   arm."<br>
<br>
This was the  second  scuffle  G.  B.  Y.  had  in  the  Big<br>
Hole  battle.  The  other  man  was  a  soldier,  but  he  did<br>
not last long.<br>
<br>
I dissent from the plea that the women had to be shot because they fought as well as the men.  It was shameful the way women and children were shot down in that fight.  The five children I mentioned were sleeping when they were killed.  It was reported Sergeant [Mildon H.] Wilson killed nine Indians.  Yes: nine women and children.  I understand he received a medal from the Government for his bravery at Big Hole.<br>
<br>
Instead of receiving a medal he should have been court-martialed.  It is a well-known fact that the command wasted more powder and lead <B>on </B>the women and children than on the warriors.  There were seventyeight Indians, all told, killed in the Big Hole battle.  Of these only thirty were warriors.  The others were women and children.<br>
<br>
About forty women and children were piled up in one little ravine where they had run for shelter.  Many women, with from one to three children in their arms, were found dead in that ravine.  Some of the children had their mother's breasts in their mouths when both were found there dead.  What reason could the soldiers have had to kill them? Had the warriors been with them we might have believed the soldiers could not help it.<br>
<br>
A daughter of Looking Glass, now north of the line, had hundreds of bullets whiz past her while crawling with a child in her arms
to find shelter.  The gallant Seventh Infantry! It should be caged the Cursed Seventh! They were not satisfied in killing Indians whom they found asleep.  They must kill women and children, too.  Why, if they wanted to kill women, did they not kill the woman who killed Capt.  Logan? It is said she was killed on the spot.  It is a lie.<br>
<br>
I do not even blame her.  Any woman would have done the same.  There was her brother dying at her feet, his loaded revolver lying by his side. What sister would not have seized it and avenged her brother's death?<br>
<br>
While the fight was going on in the morning some of the Nez Perces noticed the howitzer approaching the battle ground.  They charged upon the squad with it, killing, I believe, the man in command.<br>
<br>
After capturing the howitzer they damaged it so that, as they believed, it could not be used, A few minutes later an Indian reached the gun and expressed great regrets that it was rendered useless.  He said: "It is a great pity.  I know how to use this kind of guns.  I learned when I was with Col.  Wright fighting Cayuses and Yakimas."<br>
<br>
According to White Bird's statement, Gibbon's command retreated to a high point and entrenched itself It was thereby saved temporarily, but White Bird did not deem the place impregnable.  It was another circumstance saved Gibbon the Indians were informed Howard's command was close up on their trail, and that volunteers were coming from the eastern part of the Territory.<br>
<br>
They continued to harass Gibbon, and would have stayed with him till they wore him out had they not been apprehensive of his receiving reinforcements. They got their news in this way: About the time the main fight was over and the warriors were examining their dead, they discovered a white man, a citizen, breathing, with his eyes closed and pretending to be dead, although he was not even wounded.<br>
<br>
When they found he was "playing 'possum" they took hold of his arms and raised him up.  Finding the Indians were too smart to let him get away he jumped to his feet.  Looking Glass ordered the warriors not to kill him, saying that he was a citizen, and they might obtain information from him concerning Howard, etc.<br>
<br>
They then questioned him, and in reply he said Howard would be there in a short time, and that plenty of volunteers were coming from Virginia to head them off.  While he was telling the news a
woman who had lost her brother and some of her children in the fight came up.  She was crying at the time, and on seeing the citizen slapped him in the face.<br>
<br>
On receiving the blow he instantly gave her a vigorous kick with his door.  He had not more than kicked her when some of the warriors killed him.  He would not have been killed had he refrained from kicking her.  His statement decided them to raise camp and move on to a more secure place.<br>
<br>
White Bird says the volunteers fought better than the regular soldiers, but it was a shame for the Bitter Root volunteers, after the Nez Perces had treated them so well, to join Gibbon and fight them.  A white man must have no respect for himself It makes no difference how well he is treated by the Indians, he will take the advantage.  The Nez Perces felt that they behaved themselves while passing through the Bitter Root, and now feel sorer toward the people of that valley than they do toward the soldiers.<br>
<br>
The officer remembered as having acted most manly in the Big Hole fight is Capt. [George L.] Browning.<br>
<br>
He stopped his soldiers from killing two women in front of him.<br>
<br>
The Nez Perces were crippled more in the Big Hole battle by General Gibbon, than in any battle before or after.  It was in this fight they lost their best warriors.<br>
<br>
The particulars of the killing of the murderers of the Hayden party and the ranchmen at Horse Prairie and Birch Creek are not generally known to the Nez Perces. After numerous inquiries, I find there were two men killed at one place.  One of them was murdered in his cabin and the other while endeavoring to escape from the cabin.<br>
<br>
It must be remembered the Nez Perces were actuated at this time to commit murders by a spirit of revenge.  They had just met with a considerable loss in the battle of the Big Hole, and felt that every white man in their path was their enemy, and by taking his life they could thereby avenge the death of their comrades.  After the battle  with Gibbon's command the march was resumed.<br>
<br>
The Indians first came in contact with a party in which there were several white men and two Chinamen.  The exact number of whites is not known, but it is thought the number did not exceed six.  The
party had wagons and a lot of mules, and the Indians came upon them while they were in camp; the Indian camp was made near the train.<br>
<br>
The whites had in their possession some whisky which they proposed trading to the Indians for articles of which they stood in need.  While the trade was in progress, it began to grow dark.  This suited the young and reckless Indians and, as soon as it was dark they proceeded to help themselves.  Under the influence, and stimulated by copious droughts of the intoxicant, their hatred to the white race was intensified and they fired their guns into the train.  As soon as the firing was begun the whites and Chinamen beat a retreat.<br>
<br>
I say they "beat a retreat." The Indians did not make an examination to find whether or not they had killed any of the party, but after the volley hey approached and rifled the train, taking all the articles in the wagons and camp.  They also took the animals- This ended the fight at this place.<br>
<br>
The place at which this occurred is not known to either the Indians or the writer.... the route was new and unknown to the Indians....<br>
Following is the language of my informant: "We did not ask the whites under whose command they were.  The fact that they were  under command of Hayden was of no interest to us.  What we wanted was the whisky in their possession.  Once that was obtained, the appropriation of the rest of the possessions was merely a question of time.<br>
<br>
An Indian under the influence of whisky has no more sense than a white man when drunk, and is not any more responsible for his actions.  When an Indian is drunk he will commit crimes he would not think of when sober.  As an evidence of the truth of this statement, I have only to say that while under the influence of the whisky captured from the train one of the bravest and best warriors in the Nez Perces band was killed and another narrowly escaped death at the hands of their comrades."<br>
<br>
While the Nez Perces camp was moving beyond Camas Meadow, two days ahead of Howard's command, Grizzly Bear Youth lay in his tent, suffering from the wounds received in the Big Hole fight. Here a great bird, that never alights on the earth or trees, but rests only in the clouds, appeared to the sufferer in his lodge.  In regard to this bird it is claimed by the Nez Perces to live in their country; that it is never seen except by those wishing it for the "Medicine."<br>

They also say it is much larger and far superior to the game eagle, and will pick up game of any kind and fly with it. This bird was the "Medicine" of Grizzly Bear Youth, who was awakened from a troubled sleep into which he had fallen by the voice of the bird, which said: "I see you have tears in your eyes, caused by grieving over the loss of your relatives, your country and your arm.<br>
<br>
Why do you cry? Look behind about two days' travel and you will see two creeks.  These creeks are at Camas Meadow.  The big chief of the Idaho soldiers, "Cut Arm," and his force are camped there.  It is rather a strong force, but Fear them not.  The Nez Perces will kill some of his men and get possession of his animals.<br>
<br>
There are two kinds of animals in the camp.  I can tell you the name of only one kind.  This kind is horses.  The others differ from the horse in many ways.  Now I must leave you.  You may rely on what I have told you.  Good luck to you." The bird then disappeared.<br>
<br>
It is customary for Indians, when they have received news from their "Medicine," to summon all their brethren and inform them of what they have been told.  Grizzly Bear Youth sent for the warriors, who came to his lodge.  After singing his medicine song, he told the Indians of the news he had received from his "Medicine," the Air Bird.<br>
<br>
He told them that next night Cut Arm's (Cut Arm is Howard) animals would be in their possession.  One-half of the animals were horses; the other half he could not describe.  He further said, "I want all the warriors to go back to Camas Meadow tomorrow evening."<br>
<br>
When the talk at Grizzly Bear Youth's  lodge  was over the warriors retired and the camp was soon quiet. While they slept two scouts, who had been sent to look for Howard's command, returned to the camp.  They immediately went to Looking Glass and told him that Howard would camp next day at Camas Meadow, and that he had with him a large pack-train.<br>
<br>
Looking Glass at once summoned the Nez Perces and told them that he wanted the warriors, with the exception of twenty-five, who were to remain under charge of White Bird to guard the camp, to get ready to go and attack Howard.<br>
<br>
Accordingly, about two hundred and twenty-five warriors, under command of Looking Glass and Joseph, left the camp next morning.  They sent scouts all over the country, and traveling slow, reached
Howard's camp about midnight.  The Indians were told not to approach the camp until so ordered by Looking Glass, who first sent spies to examine the location, etc.<br>
<br>
The report made to the camp showed that there were two creeks, about three hundred yards apart.  Howard's command crossed both creeks and went into camp.  The Virginia volunteers made their camp before crossing the second creek.  The night was so dark the spies had not discovered the volunteer camp, and they were under the impression that their enemies were all with Howard.  It was very lucky indeed for the volunteers that their presence was not known.<br>
<br>
Looking Glass on learning the situation thought it best to have no light.  He told the warriors he only wanted to capture the stock and that they were to make no move until so ordered by him.<br>
<br>
A short time before daybreak he gave the order to approach the<br>
camp. In obeying a death-like stillness was observed The Indians made their way on their hands and knees.  Howard's pickets could be heard conversing in a low tone of voice.<br>
<br>
The Indians afterward said they could have captured all the cavalry horses if they had only known where they were, but the night was so dark that they feared the reports of the spies might be incorrect, and they were consequently in doubt as to the real position of the soldiers.  After getting close to the camp, Looking Glass ordered his men to prepare for a charge; told them if they could capture the animals without fighting it would be the better way, as he only wanted the animals.<br>
<br>
He also said: " We know American horses are afraid of Indians; make all the noise you possibly can, as by so doing we may be able to stampede the whole herd at once."<br>
<br>
The order to charge was given, and the work of stampeding the stock commenced.  Ever and anon the voice of Looking Glass could be heard, calling on the Indians to pay no heed to the soldiers, but secure the horses.<br>
<br>
His men obeyed his commands and rent the air with the most hideous yells.  They succeeded in capturing over two hundred head of animal ne-half of which were mules. (These latter were the  ones which the "Medicine" Bird could not describe).  While driving the herd a short distance from the scene of attack, some soldiers were discovered in pursuit.  The first thought was that Howard's co@and
was after them, but it subsequently proved to be only a small body of cavalry.<br>
<br>
These were the troops which were subject to the " whitewashing" process in the newspapers-Captain [Randolph] Norwood's command, I believe.  Looking Glass ordered the stolen animals to be left in charge of three warriors, and the rest of his force to conceal themselves.  He said, "Let the fool in command of the soldiers come up to us.  Does he think he can take those animals from us with the force he has? Make haste and hide yourselves." The Indian force was divided and two lines formed, but the officer was too wary to be drawn into the trap.<br>
<br>
He stationed his men some distance away and commenced firing.  Looking Glass ordered his men not to fire; that he thought the soldiers had not yet seen them and were only firing by guesswork.  The troops failing to advance, orders were given to the Indians to fire, and the fight commenced.  The Indians endeavored to get the soldiers between the lines formed, and had they succeeded, there would have been a massacre similar to that when Custer's command were killed by Sitting Bull and his warriors.  The Indians finally made a charge and the troops retreated to a point of timber.<br>
<br>
While here the Nez Perces became uneasy lest Howard's command should have heard the firing and reinforce the troops under Norwood- Joseph and Looking Glass held a consultation, and as they had suffered no loss whatever, they started back to their camp.<br>
<br>
Thus ended the great battle of Camas Meadow.  About noon the Indians halted and Looking Glass divided the stolen animals among his warriors.<br>
<br>
<B>In traveling </B>through the country after the capture of Howard's animals at Camas Meadow, the Nez Perces captures a white man in the Lower Geyser Basin.  He was engaged in eating his meal when the Indians discovered him.  Four of them went up to the man, the rest remaining some distance away.  The white man was so astonished at the appearance of the Indians he apparently did not know what to do.<br>
<br>
He asked the Indians to what tribe they belonged.  They answered that they were Sioux, just for the purpose of seeing what the man would say.  They then held a council and determined to take the man to their camp and ask for information as to the road to the plains.<br>
<br>
On reaching camp the prisoner was asked his business in that part of the country, etc.  On being told that he was on his way to the settlements in Montana, and that he was familiar with the
different routes, they determined to keep him for a guide until they would be in a portion of country known to them.<br>
<br>
It was also determined that he should be well paid for his services, and that he should not be harmed.  Had the prisoner claimed that he did not know the country, he would undoubtedly have been permitted to depart unmolested.<br>
<br>
But the route they were on was not known by an Indian in the camp, and it was determined to keep the prisoner for a guide.  After going into camp for the ,tight, Looking Glass sent for Poker Joe, to whom he ;aid: "You let the white man remain with you and reat him well.  You understand how to speak English, and you and the guide can get along well together."<br>
<br>
It was Poker Joe who first proposed that the prisoner could be kept and made to act as guide.  His proposition was made to Looking Glass, White Bird and Joseph, and they concluded to accept Poker Joe's advice.  When the camp moved the next day the prisoner was ordered to ride behind an Indian.  His property was appropriated by the others, who intended returning it when his services were no longer required.<br>
<br>
The Indians all speak highly of the prisoner, as he was always willing to do whatever he was asked.<br>
<br>
Poker Joe told the man he must not attempt to escape, and that he would be his friend.  At the time of his escape the Indians intended keeping him but one day longer.  They then proposed returning the property taken from him and paying him for his trouble.  It may be thought by some that this would not have been done, but White Bird told the writer that they intended to do right by the prisoner and pay him liberally for his services.  We believe the prisoner s name was Shavely.<br>
<br>
Early next morning after the capture of [John] Shively some of the young warriors captured a party of eight persons six men and two women.  The party were in their rents asleep when the Indians came up, except two men who were building a fire.  The ladies were both young.  The party had a wagon and a buggy.<br>
<br>
The appearance of the Indians aroused the rest of the party, and they at once made preparations to leave without getting their breakfast.  Seeing this, they were told by an Indian that they need not fear, that they were friends of the whites, and that he himself would escort them safely through the Indian camp, and they
could then return to their homes unmolested.<br>
<br>
The preparations to start were soon made, but they had proceeded but a short distance when they were surrounded by a large party of warriors, who told them it was not safe for them to travel on that road, as there were bad Indians behind who would kill them.  The Indians then had a talk, and it was concluded to take the captured party to the chiefs in order to see whether or not they be permitted to return, and the party was ordered to march toward the camp.<br>
<br>
After traveling some distance up the east bank of Fire Hole River the wagon and carriage had to be abandoned on account of the fallen timber.  The horses were rehitched and saddles put on them for the women.  While the horses were being unsaddled, one of the white men (Frank Carpenter) requested permission to go to Looking Glass and see if he would not permit them to go home.  Permission being granted, he hired an Indian for six needle-gun cartridges to conduct him to the chief, who was in camp at the foot of a steep mountain, just west of Mary's Lake.<br>
<br>
Carpenter shook hands with Looking Glass, and while talking with him Poker Joe accompanied by Shively came up Joe invited Carpenter to accompany him to his lodge, and on reaching there plied him [with] questions as to who were members of his party, where they were from, etc.  He answered all the questions, and then asked if they could not go home.<br>
<br>
Poker Joe replied: "Yes, no kill citizens; kill Lewiston soldiers all the time."<br>
<br>
In the meantime the other captives were hurried forward until they came to the Nez Perces camp.  They were then told by Poker Joe that they could return, but they must leave their horses, arms and ammunition; that he would give them other horses to ride home, and also give them other guns and three cartridges each.<br>
<br>
This he did according to his word.  At this juncture Looking Glass ordered camp to be raised and the march resumed.  The captives were told to take the trail by which they had come.  Looking Glass shook hands with Frank Carpenter, but had no conversation with him aside from telling him that they would not be killed and would be permitted to return.  White Bird did not appear to the captives.<br>
<br>
He did not know a word of English, and consequently kept away from them.  The party on starting away was told by Poker Joe that he could not longer control his warriors.<br>

<br>
The two parties then separated.  Looking Glass and White Bird, thinking everything was safe, started ahead of the Indian camp.  They did not know the little party was followed by the young warriors.  On being informed that such was the case, they immedi-
ately sent Poker Joe to protect the whites.  All this time the party were surrounded and followed by the most ferocious young men of the camp.<br>
<br>
Two of the white men left the camp and escaped into the brush.and Mrs. [George F. ] Cowan were in advance of the rest of the party, when two Indians dashed down the hill in front of them.  One of these Indians was Um-tifl-lilp-cown, one of the three Idaho murderers. This Indian thought the murder of the whites an agree-
able pastime, and he stepped forward and shot Cowan, who fell from his horse after being shot.<br>
<br>
Mrs. [Emma] Cowan immediately dismounted and endeavored to prevent the fiends, who had approached the wounded man, from doing him further injury, telling them to kill her but spare her husband.  Her entreaties were unheeded, and she was torn from her husband, and he was shot through the head and left for dead.<br>
<br>
While this fiendish work was being performed, another Indian carne up.  Seeing the women crying, and on learning the cause of their grief, he remembered Looking Glass' command to spare the lives of citizens.  We remember asking this Indian why he interfered.<br>
<br>
He replied: "I had not the heart to see those women abused.  I thought we had done them enough wrong in killing their relations against the wishes of our chief, and knew we were in the wrong.  While I was endeavoring to stop the bloody work, Poker Joe came up, having been sent by Looking Glass.  He did not arrive in time to save those already shot, but he and I prevented other injuries being done the party."<br>
<br>
When asked why it was that the life of Frank Carpenter had been spared, and being told that Carpenter attributed his being saved to the fact of his having made the sign of the cross, the same Indian said: "Oh! bosh; I am the man who saved his life, and interfered in his behalf for the reason I gave before, that I thought we had done enough killing.  I took pity on the women,<br>
seeing their tears.<br>
<br>
I saw the man making the sign of the cross, but that had nothing to do with saving his life.  I am down on preachers.  They are the cause of most of these troubles.  We are neither Catholics nor Protestants- we are infidels.  I do not care to what denomination a preacher belongs.  They preach for their own good, to fill their
own pockets." The name of this Indian was Red Scout.<br>
<br>
After the bloody work had been accomplished it was decided to take the women back to the camp.  One of them was mounted behind Henry Lababour, the murderer of the men at Dearborn, Elk Creek and Rock Creek.  This Indian was a Snake half breed.  The other lady was mounted behind Red Scout.  Mrs. Cowan states that after being put behind an Indian on horseback she looked back and saw an Indian pounding her husband's head with a rock.  The Indians deny this.  They say the man was not touched after being shot.  That they supposed him dead.<br>
<br>
On again reaching the Nez Perces camp the captives were taken to Poker Joe's lodge.  Poker Joe gave the warriors to understand that the women were under his protection and that he would permit no insult :o be offered them.  Poker Joe was the best friend the women had in the Nez Perces camp.  The next day a council of the chiefs was held and Looking Glass said that the prisoners must be allowed to return.<br>
<br>
During he absence of the warriors Poker Joe took the two women and their brother some distance from the camp, and told them to make all possible haste if they wished to escape.  His advice was followed and the party escaped.<br>
<br>
About the Helena party, the published account was strictly true.  We endeavored to find from White Bird <B>the nam</B>e of the Indian who gave chase to the colored servant captured with this last pony.  A young warrior responded that he was the one who had been after the colored individual. [Ben] Stone managed to make his escape by climbing a tree, The Indian being interrogated to why he wanted him so badly said: "I just wanted  his  scalp:  colored  men's  hair  is  good  medicine for sore  ears."  This  accounts  for  the  long  chase  given Stone.<br>
<br>
When the Nez Perces were camped at Bear Paw Mountains Poker Joe grew dissatisfied with the other chiefs for not making their way into the British Possessions.  Poker Joe had a good deal of influence over the Indians, but after a discussion with the chiefs, and  they not agreeing to his plans, he declined having anything further to do with their future movements.<br>
<br>
Howard's whereabouts were known to the Indians.  They knew his animals were worn out, while their own were in splendid condition.  As a consequence they were in no hurry to move their camp, and spent their time in making merry, as they then had no doubt but they would effect their escape without difficulty.  They had no intimation of the approach of the troops under General Miles.
While resting in fancied security on the morning of the attack, the scouts being all at camp, an alarm was suddenly given.  The cry was "Prepare for a fight; there is a large body of soldiers dose on us." White Bird ordered his warriors to prepare for a defense and said: "What a pity we did not have scouts out.  Had we known this half an hour ago, how differently might we now have been situated.  Had I known then of the approach of the soldiers we would not have to fight.  Our horses are fresh and we could have made our escape.  But it is too late now.  Escape is impossible, fight we must."<br>
<br>
About the battle of Bear Paw, I have not much to write, as the Indian version is but <B>repetition</B> of the published accounts.  The Indians got worsted in the engagement, as is well known and the white man's version was the true one.<br>
<br>
I purpose relating, however, the conversation between Looking Glass and White Bird; some facts in relation to that officer who was taken prisoner; and the promises made Joseph by the commanding officer in charge of the soldiers in case the Indians would surrender.<br>
<br>
General Miles, like many others, supposed Joseph to be the leader of the hostiles, and wanted his surrender in place of the real leader-Looking Glass.  This suited the Indians exactly and they allowed  Joseph to go to the camp of the soldiers.  That night he remained in the tent of General Miles.  During the truce the Indians were engaged in fortifying their position, and some soldiers under command of Lieutenant [Colonel A. G.] Irvine who ventured into the Indian camp were taken prisoners and held as a hostage for the return of Joseph.<br>
<br>
The fight was renewed at this time.  On the second day in the afternoon an exchange was effected, the soldiers returning to their command and Joseph to the Indian camp.  Before the exchange, while the fight was in progress, one of the warriors was in need of some needle gun cartridges.  He went to the officer who was yet a prisoner and told him what he wanted.  He asked for two cartridges, and was given five by the officer, whose name I was told was Lieut.  Irvine.  A few such men as him in the Indian camp would have made more trouble for the soldiers.<br>
<br>
While the fight was in progress many of the Indian women and a few children made their escape.  A large part of the camp believed that Sitting Bull was near at hand and that he would come to their rescue.<br>
<br>

One of the women had escaped at the first appearance of the soldiers and it was thought she had gone to the Sioux camp.  But such was not the case, as the woman went but a short distance and remained until the fight was over.<br>
<br>
On the evening of the fourth day a flag of truce was raised for the third time.  Gen.  Miles told the Indians that if they surrendered he would treat them well; that he would take them to Tongue River that winter and in the spring would send them back to Idaho.  He furthermore said that any promises he might make to them would be fulfilled.<br>
<br>
Joseph wanted to surrender but the other chiefs kept him from doing so.  They feared that in case they were to surrender to Gen.  Miles, they would be treated similarly to the Indians who surrendered to Col.  Wright on the Columbia in 1858.  After surrendering, the principals were all hung by command of the officer to whom they surrendered.<br>
<br>
Joseph endeavored to persuade the chiefs that the best thing they could do was to accede to the demands made by Gen.  Miles.  Looking Glass and White Bird then said: "Joseph, you do not know the Americans as well as we do.  Never in the world will they <B>fulfill</B> the promises made the Indians.  The commanding officer speaks sweet, but it is doubtful whether he will send the Indians back to their country."<br>
<br>
Next morning Joseph told Looking Glass he had concluded to surrender to Gen.  Miles.  The latter chief then went to White Bird, told him the conclusion arrived at by Joseph and said: "We will leave here tonight.  I know we will never see our country again."<br>
<br>
Near the Indian camp was a ridge on which some of the warriors lay watching the movements of the soldiers.  Looking Glass, his brother and the other chiefs were in the camp talking over the proposed flight in the  evening.  Looking Glass requested his brother to get him his pipe, saying he wanted a smoke.<br>
<br>
While his brother had gone for the pipe Looking Glass had<br>
his attention attracted by the movement of the warriors on the ridge.  He started towards them.  He was asked to remain where he was, but the chief replied that he would return shortly; that he wanted to see what the warriors on the ridge were doing.  He reached the place where the warriors were.<br>
<br>
It was some 500 or 600 yards from the soldiers' position.  He raised himself up to view the surroundings.  As he did so a volley from the guns of the soldiers was directed towards him, and one of
the bullets entered his forehead, throwing him some distance down the hill and killing him instantly.  Poker Joe, the friend of the lady prisoners taken in the National Park, was also killed in the Bear Paw fight.<br>
<br>
White Bird and his warriors escaped that night.  In the escaping party were 103 warriors, 60 women, 8 children and about 200 head of horses.  One remarkable feature of the party was that there were no dogs with them.  An Indian procession is usually considered incomplete unless there are in it a number of these latter animals.<br>
<br>
In a residence of thirty years in the Indian country I have not heard of a parallel case.<br>
<br>
Joseph could have escaped as well as White Bird but the conditions promised him by General Miles influenced him to surrender.  If he had endeavored tc escape, he would have had on his hands his wounded warriors and helpless women and children.  He thought it the better plan to rely on the word of the officer tc whom he surrendered-the representative of a nation of forty millions of people.<br>
<br>
After White Bird made his escape from the U.S, troops at Bear Paw and before he reached Sitting Bull's camp, he lost seven warriors by the Assiniboines and Gros Ventres.  One of the killed was Umti-lilp. cown, the third and last of the Nez Perces who committed the murders in Idaho which brought on the war.<br>
<br>
White Bird did not know whether or not it would be safe for him to go to Sitting Bull's camp, but after a consultation with his followers they came to the conclusion they might as well be killed by Indian enemies as by the whites.  Coming to a half breed camp near Milk Paver, they hired one of the party to guide them to Sitting Bull.<br>
<br>
As they were proceeding toward the Sioux camp they came upon an Indian skinning a buffalo.  The hunter appeared rather shy, but after considerable parley told White Bird that he was a Sioux and that he had come from Sitting Bull's camp.  White Bird told him to go to Sitting Bull and tell him the Nez Perces were anxious to see him; that they were refugees, fleeing for protection from the U. S. troops.<br>
<br>
The buffalo hunter started on his mission and the Nez Perces camp moved slowly in the direction he had gone.  After marching a few miles they discovered a large body of mounted Indians coming
toward them.  They numbered nearly 3,000 warriors and were coming at till speed.  A short distance in advance of the main body rode an Indian warrior, on a magnificent war horse.  When within hailing distance of the Nez Perces the command halted.<br>
<br>
The warrior in advance asked White Bird, by signs, to what tribe he belonged.  White Bird made answer, saying he was a Nez Perces.  The other then said: "I am Sitting Bull, and these" pointing to his followers, "are my warriors." Sitting Bull then came up and shook hands with White Bird and his warriors.<br>
<br>
After bidding them welcome, he said: "I am sorry indeed that your skin is like mine, that your hair is like mine. and that every one around you is a pure red man like myself We, too, have lost our country by falsehood and theft."<br>
<br>
Although the Indians were now north of the line, they expected to be followed and attacked by U. S. soldiers.  The Sioux had not thus far been attacked, but they did not know but now that so many soldiers were near them they would follow the Indians and give them battle.<br>
<br>
Sitting Bull, after hearing of the Bear Paw fight, said: "If I had known you were surrounded by soldiers at Bear Paw Mountains, I certainly would have helped you.  What a pity that I was not there with my warriors.  But now you are here, and as long as you are with me I will not allow the Americans to take even a child from you without fighting for it."<br>
<br>
Sitting Bull received a present of seven horses from White Bird.  The Nez Perces were welcomed in the Sioux camp and received from Sitting Bull nothing but the kindest of treatment.<br>
<br>
While on my way  from Fort Walsh to see the escaped Nez        Perces, I was overtaken by  Colonel Irvine and command of the Mounted Police.  The officer on learning my destination to be Sitting Bull's camp said he was also going there, his errand being to escort White Bird to Fort Walsh to have a talk with an American officer, Capt. [George W.] Baird by name.  <B><br>
<br>
On </B>the road Col.  Irvine engaged me [to] act as interpreter for him.  While looking for the Sioux camp we found a small party of Indians belonging to that camp and from them we learned that White Bird was with Crazy Horse's band of about 300 lodges at a place called Sandy Hills.<br>
<br>
In a short time we reached the camp and I never saw Indians so badly frightened as were these.  We dismounted and Col.  Irvine and your correspondent proceeded to White Bird's lodge.  Arrived
there we shook hands with the chief His warriors thought we had come to arrest their chief-that we were hirelings of the U. S. Government and they continued to arrive and crowd themselves into the lodge until we were packed so closely there was not room to move.<br>
<br>
I never saw an officer with a better "Indian way" than Col.  Irvine.  He seemed to understand the Indian nature, and at once impressed the Indians favorably toward him.<br>
<br>
We remained in the lodge but a short time.  Then seeing the Indians were still somewhat uneasy we concluded we had best retire without mentioning at the present our mission to the chief<br>
<br>
It will be remembered there were three Nez Perces sent direct from Fort Leavenworth.  One of them was a brother-in-law of White Bird.  The government thought best to send these men to White Bird, as they might possibly induce him to surrender.  The emissaries were in company of the Police.<br>
<br>
It required considerable persuasion to induce the chief to ac-
company us to Fort Walsh.  The Sioux told White Bird if he went with us to Fort Walsh <B>he </B>would be arrested.  This had the effect of causing a delay of three days, but White Bird finally concluded to go with and see the American officer.  He was escorted by eight warriors only.  On reaching the Fort Captain.  Baird received the Nez Perces kindly, and they had no reason whatever to complain of their treatment.<br>
<br>
The morning after our arrival at the Fort we were called to the council, which was held in the officers' hall.  Capt.  Baird at once said to the chief- "An officer of the Queen wrote to the American authorities stating that the escaped Nez Perces were tired of their treatment by the British and wished <B>to </B>return to American soil.<br>
<br>
The officer to whom the complaint was made told them he would communicate with the American authorities and find <B>out </B>what terms they would be allowed to return.  The letter was received by the U. S. authorities and I was sent with these three members of your tribe to meet you and take you to Joseph.<br>
<br>
I want you to come with me.  You will be treated well and taken down the river on a steamer." White Bird replied: "What are you going to do with Joseph? You hold him a prisoner of war.  You pro
-
mised to send him back to his country, but you have not done so.  I want to know what you intend to do with him."<br>
<br>
Capt.  Baird then said: "Joseph is down at Leavenworth and expects to meet you.  He wants you to come to him.  If you accompany me to him it is likely you will be sent back to Idaho.  If you do not come with me it is not likely Joseph will be returned to his country.  I want you to take time to think.  You can have a council among your people if you so desire."<br>
<br>
Col. [James F.] Macleod then said to White Bird: "I have no doubt but that this man is telling you the truth, and that he firmly believes you will be treated as he says.  You will be taken down to your own people.  You will see Joseph.  Your transportation will cost you nothing. Think well of these things.  You have before you some of your people who come from Joseph, and that ought to satisfy you that the Nez Perces are treated well where they now are at Ft.  Leavenworth."<br>
<br>
All then left the room except the Nez Perces and the writer.  White Bird then asked the Nez Perces from Ft.  Leavenworth what Joseph had said.  They replied: "Joseph told us to tell you that you might do as you thought best.  If you conclude to go to him he will be glad to see you-if not, well and good."<br>
<br>
White Bird said: "Well, there is a mistake somewhere.  The officer tells me Joseph expects me to go to him.  If you have told me the truth then this man has to tell me what is false." That ended the first day's council.<br>
<br>
At the second council, Capt.  Baird but repeated what he had before said, and added: "You may possibly imagine that you may return, one by one, to Idaho from this place, and be safe in doing so.  But you are mistaken in this, and should you attempt it will be arrested, If you<B> </B>return with me you will have no trouble whatever. I come for you on the representations made by the officers of the Queen that you and your people had tired of your home and desired to return."<br>
<br>
White Bird asked: "Am I the man, or has any of the leading men of my tribe expressed themselves as wanting to return with you? I do not want to go where Joseph is.  The country is unhealthy.  Let Joseph come back here, and together we will return to Idaho of our own accord."<br>
     
Colonel Macleod again said, "I have no doubt that man is telling you the truth.  May be you think there are plenty of buffalo and you can depend on these animals for food.  We have so many Indians here the buffalo will not last long.  You have no right to this country.  We can make no treaties with you.  I can give nothing save my protection.<br>
<br>
You had better retire to your lodge and think over this matter.  You must not think only for yourself, but for your people -warriors, women and children not for one or two days, but for years to come."<br>
<B><br>
<br>
It </B>is not remembered whether it was before or after this speech of Col.  Macleod that Yellow Bull said: "While we were engaged in the battle at Bear Paw Mountains the chief of the soldiers said if we sur' rendered we would be sent back to our country and treated well." The Preacher, or Bald Head, and the third Indian repeated the remarks made by Yellow Bull.<br>
<br>
White Bird then resolved <B>that </B>he would not accompany Capt.  Baird.  He thought the soldiers had told him falsehoods regarding the country and climate to which they would be taken.  The Nez Perces tribe had already met with large losses.  He could not see the necessity of going to Fort Leavenworth and thence to Idaho.<br>
<br>
It was a shorter journey from where he was taken from Fort Leavenworth, and he will wait until the return of Joseph before leaving the British possessions. The party making the complaint which led to this council was Henry Tavahvour, the leading murderer in <B>the </B>band of Nez Perces which passed through Montana last year. He and his companions deserted from White Bird's Camp. White Bird <B>refuses </B>to surrender unless Joseph retu<B>rns, </B>but does not intend again war against the whites.<br>
<br>
Joseph and his refugees spent the next eight years getting back to the Pacific Northwest. Some of White Bird's people returned to Idaho much sooner. But White Bird remained in Canada permanently, failing to survive a factional fight at Fort MacLeod with another Nez Perce warrior.<br>

NEZ PERCE WAR<br>

Russell Blankenship, "Joseph and the Nez Perce War," <B>And there were men.</B> New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1942, p. 68-78.<br>
<br>
[Chief] Joseph led his band [from his homeland in the Wallowa Valley] to the Snake and effected a crossing of the difficult stream without incident.  Then he moved out of the large canyon and started down the Salmon in the direction of Lapwai.  A number of whites were living along the Salmon, one of whom had previously killed a Nez Perce.  As the Indians approached the place where this man lived, the young braves got out of hand and began to murder whites indiscriminately.  In a few days they bad killed eleven settlers.  The report of these outrages sent soldiers marching out of Lapwai.  War was on.<br>
<br>
Troops clashed first with the Indians in the White Bird Canyon only a short distance from the Salmon.  The exact number of men at Joseph's disposal in this fight is unknown.  When be left Wallows he had about sixty warriors, but after crossing the Snake be was joined by disaffected warriors from the Idaho reservation until he ultimately had about three hundred.<br>
<br>
Of these only a small number belonged to his own band and because of the loose allegiance to the head chief, a situation common in all Nez Perce' clans, he directly controlled only a few men.  It seems that Joseph as chief had general direction of affairs, but the warriors on the battle linc were directed by orders.  Among these at the beginning of the war were White Bird and Olkut, Joseph's brother.<br>
<br>
Howard sent a body of cavalry with orders to relieve the settlers at Mt- Idaho, who, it was feared, were beleaguered by the hostiles.<br>
<br>
When the soldiers reached Grangeville, they were met by armed citizens who gave them the position of the Indians and urged an immediate attack, predicting an easy success.  Tie whites were one hundred three in number, and two or three to one was usually considered fair odds in Indian fighting, but this time Howard overlooked the fact that Joseph bad not wasted his time in drilling his men and that his warriors were good shots.<br>
<br>
At three o'clock in the morning of June 7th 1877, the troops began to drop into the White Bird Canyon, hoping to meet the hostiles before Joseph could escape across the Salmon.  For a time there was no sight of an Indian.  Suddenly skirmishers appeared before the whites, and both sides opened fire.<br>

The line in front of the soldiers was very thinly held, Joseph having decided to deliver his main attacks on the flanks.  On the right White Bird led the fighting while Olikut was in charge on the left.  The soldiers, caught in an enfilading fire, surprising in its intensity, attempted to fall back.  Then the slaughter began.<br>
<br>
Methodically the Nez Perces picked their targets and fired with a fine understanding of the function of a rear sight.  At the height of the fighting a group of mounted Indians charged through the opposing line, completely demoralizing the raw recruits.  One group of whites was cut off and killed to a man.<br>
<br>
The remainder of the detachment alternately retreated and fought until armed citizens met them just outside Grangeville.<br>
<br>
The troops had lost thirty-four men, exactly one-third of their number.  White Bird was only a skirmish, but considering the number of men engaged the losses were excessively heavy.  It was a victory for Joseph, but more than that it was a tremendous moral triumph.  Disgruntled Nez Perce's from the reservation flocked to the hostiles until joseph was in command of three hundred men all of them well, armed with Winchesters.  From the list of dead sent back to Howard, the praying general saw that be was dealing with no skulking foemen.<br>
<br>
After the debacle of White Bird Canyon, Howard marched against the Indians, taking two hundred and twenty-seven regulars and about one hundred and fifty extremely uncertain civilian volunteers.  The general had in his little army contingents of infantry, a few cavalrymen, and one battery of field artillery.<br>
<br>
Joseph could easily have escaped Howard had be not been hampered by a quantity of baggage and a crowd of noncombatants.  He had with him all the women, children, stock, property, and tepees belonging to his tribe.  This fact makes subsequent events all the more remarkable.<br>
<br>
After a bit of maneuvering in which Joseph easily eluded Howard,' the white general received reinforcements of one hundred and seventy-five men.<br>
<br>
This addition gave him a two to one superiority over the Indians.  Emboldened, Howard succumbed to a ruse and crossed the Salmon in pursuit of Joseph.  At this juncture an officious subordinate attacked a camp of neutral Nez Perces with the result that the chief of the neutrals, Looking Glass, and his entire band joined
Joseph.  In later fighting Looking Glass, next to Olikut, was Joseph's most trusted fighting man.<br>
<br>
In the meantime the hostiles cut in behind Howard and gained the open country of Camas Prairie.  In the maneuvering the white army lumbered slowly from point to point while the Indians skipped ahead nimbly.  With no difficulty whatever Joseph reached the Clearwater where be established camp and prepared to offer battle <B>in </B>a strong position.<br>
<br>
The Indian line took the form of an inverted " U " sheltered on both sides by towering cliffs and protected in the rear by the Clearwater.  The Indians on the lower ground dug rifle pits.<br>
<br>
Back of the line of battle were the horses of the warriors.  The noncombatants pitched camp across the swift stream.  In making preparations for the battle Joseph showed a clear grasp of military tactics.  His chief strength was on his flanks, protected by the cliffs, while on the heights above were numerous sharp shooters-<br>
Howard, feeling secure in his numerical superiority, attacked the position.  As his troops moved into line of battle they were caught by fire from three sides.  The first day saw heavy fighting, but the outcome was indecisive, and losses on both sides were small.  At sundown the whites were on the defensive in the mouth of the " U."<br>
<br>
On the second day Howard ordered his men to storm the rifle pits regardless of loss.  This frontal attack succeeded, and the Nez Perce's retreated in good order across the Clearwater, reformed their battle line and by a sharp fire kept the whites from crossing.  During the fighting, squaws struck camp, packed up all their goods, and prepared to move.  Where to go was the question.<br>
<br>
A conference of Joseph and his chiefs resulted in a decision to try to reach Canada, the old woman's land, as the Indians referred to Queen Victoria's dominion.  They came to this decision because Sitting Bull, only a short time previously, bad gained a refuge in the same place.<br>
<br>
The decision made, Joseph commenced to move.  Easily sweeping around Howard who bad crossed the Clearwater at another point, the Nez Perce's started up the Lolo Trail.  This trail bad been used for many years, because it was the nearest road between Missoula and Lewiston, but despite use, it was and is one of the most difficult trails in the West.  In places it is excessively steep, for all of its route it is very rocky, and often it is obstructed
by fallen trees.<br>
<br>
As the hostiles marched along in the usual disarray of an Indian tribe, they cut trees across the trail in their rear to impede the progress of the white troops.  At night Joseph sent out small detachments to sweep over Camas Prairie, burning houses and steal-
ing horses to distract General Howard from the pursuit.  During these forays no white noncombatants were killed.<br>
<br>
Up the trail steadily went the Indians seven hundred strong, counting warriors, squaws, and children, over rocks, through seemingly impassable tangles of fallen trees, climbing, climbing steadily towards the distant summit.  The air was thick with dust.<br>
<br>
The crisp resin odor of evergreens was swallowed in the sharp smell of droppings from overstrained, grass-fed horses.  Occasionally a horse, dragging a travois loaded with camp equipment, would fall exhausted.  Swiftly the squaws would transfer the load to another animal, leaving the exhausted one to live or die.  Joseph's raids had given him an abundant supply of horses, and Indians were notoriously callous in the treatment of their animals.<br>
<br>
Joseph moved only fast enough to keep out of Howard's reach.  When the white general halted for supplies or to give his men time to clear the trail, Joseph's band also baited to rest and gather subsistence from the country.  Howard's superiors were very sure that whites could live anywhere that Indians could, but it is evident that these superiors bad little understanding of a white man's incapacity to extract a living from a tangle of uninhabited mountains.  Day after day the retreat continued, Joseph keeping just out of reach of his pursuers.<br>
<br>
Howard was much criticized for his failure to join battle with the Indians, but there is not the slightest evidence of his lack of bravery or efficiency as a leader.  Battle with the Nez Perce's was the very thing that Howard wanted, and that was the very thing that joseph wished to avoid.  The superior mobility of the Indians enabled Joseph to have his way.  If the hostiles had not been burdened with a whole tribe and its equipment they could easily have eluded all the whites, both regular soldiers and volunteers, in the Northwest.<br>
<br>
In the meantime Howard ordered General Gibbon in western Montana to collect a force and bead off the Indians at the mouth of the
Lolo Trail.  Gibbon moved as rapidly as be could, sending a small force of regulars and volunteers to the eastern end of the trail with orders to bold the Indians until he could arrive with a detachment of cavalry.<br>
<br>
When Joseph came out into the Bitter Root Valley, he found this small force in his way.  Showing no disposition to attack, he began to negotiate with the commander, Lieutenant Rawn, for safe passage, promising to harm none of the settlers in Montana.  To these proposals Rawn returned a negative, but the volunteers in his force, mindful of the safety of their families and homes, urged him to accept Joseph's terms.<br>
<br>
Rawn, aware of his duty as an officer, negotiated for three days and finally decided to attack.  In the early morning when he ordered his troops into line, he waited for the volunteers to join him.  When this force did not move from camp, Rawn demanded a reason.  He was told that the volunteers were satisfied with joseph's promises and that they would not assist in an attack.  There was nothing for Rawn to do but watch Joseph pass his destination.<br>
<br>
While negotiations were going on, Joseph bad taken the opportunity to have the country well scouted.  He also had sent word to the settlers that they would not be harmed.  The Montanans took joseph at his word, going so far as to sell the hostiles needed supplies and, it is alleged, ammunition.<br>
<br>
The Nez Perces swung to the south, bolding off Rawn's little body of regulars, and started south up the Bitter Root Valley.  This route took them away from Canada, but it was chosen to avoid the approaching soldiers under Gibbon's command.  When joseph reached the bead of the Bitter Root Valley be paused, thinking that for the time be was safe.  He had not reckoned, however, on the energy and impetuosity of General Gibbon.<br>
<br>
When Gibbon's scouts reported that the enemy was in camp in the Big Hole, the general moved swiftly to give battle.  Under cover of darkness the whites approached the Nez Perce' camp.  Joseph felt so secure that be bad placed no sentries around his people.  At daybreak one Indian sleepily emerged from a tepee in full view of the soldiers, mounted a horse, and rode towards the herd of ponies near camp.<br>
<br>
The Indian was Lying-on-the-ground, the most eminent medicine man of the tribe.  Suddenly be saw the blue-clad soldiers.  Before be could escape, a blast of rifle fire riddled his body.  Then the whites charged the sleeping camp.<br>

The ensuing battle does not make pretty reading for a white man.  Soldiers indiscriminately shot men and women and children.  The Indians fled, but as they went, Joseph ordered his young men to save the herd of ponies.  Afoot the Nez Perce's would be as good as lost.<br>
<br>
This maneuver succeeded.  In a few minutes the soldiers were in possession of the camp.  Then, taking advantage of the lull, joseph, Looking Glass, and Olikut rallied their warriors and made a vicious counterattack.  The subsequent fighting was the fiercest of the entire war.  Whites and reds clinched in band-to-band conflict.  Squaws seized rifles of fallen warriors and fought like wildcats.<br>
<br>
Finally, with a wild charge the Nez Perce's recaptured their camp.<br>
Still Gibbon refused to give up.  For two days the battle raged with both sides having their share of bravery and daring.  At the end the Nez Perces held their camp, and Gibbon's force was shattered.  The whites lost thirty-three killed and forty seriously wounded.<br>
<br>
The general received a rifle bullet in his knee.  Joseph's loss was thirty warriors and fifty-three squaws and papooses.  How many were wounded is unknown.  After the fight Joseph collected his band and disappeared into the mountains to the east.  Gibbon's force was too exhausted to follow.<br>
<br>
In the meanwhile Howard was laboring to catch up with Gibbon.  The two joined forces, Howard taking command by virtue of his seniority.<br>
<br>
The Nez Perce's had crawled a few miles to the east and stopped at Camas Meadows, licking their wounds.  Howard ponderously followed.  This time when the enemy came close to the Indian camp, Joseph was fully aware of its presence, for his scouts were covering his trail.<br>
In the evening Howard went into camp, intending to attack the next<br>
day.  That night Joseph sent his mounted warriors towards the white man's tents.  Suddenly yells and the thunder of pounding hoofs reverberated between the hills.  The Indians bad cut between the camp and the herd of mules and were hurrying the animals out of range.  The soldiers fired and swore, but the only result of the night's work was the loss of five hundred mules, fifty horses, and the remnant of Howard's prestige which had survived the rigors of the Lolo Trail.<br>
<br>
After this successful coup Joseph moved into the Yellowstone Park.  Here occurred one of the most sensational episodes of the entire retreat, although the incident was in itself insignificant.  A
party of tourists going through the park was captured by Joseph's warriors.  After a harrowing experience and marvelous escapes the tourists managed to get away with their lives.  They lived for years to tell the thrilling tale of tourists captured by marauding Indians.<br>
<br>
After leaving Yellowstone Park, Joseph swung a bit to the south and then turned directly north towards Canada and safety.  Throwing off another attack at Canyon Creek, be swerved a bit to the west and then resumed his northward flight.  The way now seemed to be clear.<br>
But joseph had not counted o.n the white man's telegraph.  Colonel Nelson C. Miles was coming up the Missouri on a steamboat loaded with soldiers.  Disembarking his men near the Bear Paw Mountains be sent scouts to locate the Nez Perce's.<br>
<br>
In a short time the Colonel knew the whereabouts of his quarry.  Swiftly deploying his men, for be knew from the experience of Howard that speed was essential, be struck with an overwhelming force.  All day the battle raged, the Indians suffering heavy losses.  Artillery was brought into action, and all around the little band of Nez Perce's were heavy lines of soldiers, fresh and well armed.<br>
<br>
On the second day of the fight Miles sent a squaw man to the Indian lines with a request for a consultation with Joseph.  After some time the man was admitted, and at length he returned to Miles followed by Joseph.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Jerome, one of Miles's subordinates, misunderstood his orders and rode unmolested into the Indian camp.  While negotiations were in progress between Miles and joseph, fighting broke out again, each camp bolding a hostage from the other.<br>
<br>
The next day the discussion was resumed over the crucial question of disarming the Indians and sending them back to Idaho.  Miles insisted upon disarmament, and Joseph was equally firm in demand-
ing that his people be returned to their home.  Miles gave his word, and then Joseph capitulated.  At the surrender Joseph is said to have pronounced these words:<br>
<br>
" Tell General Howard that I know his heart.  What he told me before I have in my heart.  I am tired of fighting.  Our chiefs are killed.  Looking Glass is dead, Tu-bul-hil-sote is dead.  The old men are all dead.  It is the young men who now say yes or no.  He who led the young men is dead.  It is cold and we have no blankets.  The little children are freezing to death.  My people -
some of them have run away to the hills and have no blankets and no food.  No one knows where they are - perhaps freezing to death.<br>
<br>
"I want to have time to look for my children and see how many of them I can find.  Maybe I shall find them among the dead.  Hear me, my chiefs, my heart is sick and sad.  From where the sun now stands I will fight no more against the white man."<br>
<br>
Joseph surrendered in good faith, but as usual in its dealing with him the government did not keep its word.<br>
<br>
The Idaho settlers were alarmed and they would have no more of Joseph and his band of warriors.  The little group from the Wallowas was ordered sent to the Indian territory, and here for eight years the mountain-bred Indians suffered beat, poverty, and sickness, until only two hundred and eighty-two of the tribe were left alive.<br>
<br>
Finally in 1885 the government yielded to the importunities of Joseph and Colonel Miles and allowed the Nez Perce's to return to the Northwest.  But they were not permitted to live in the Wallowas or in Idaho.  They were ordered to the Nespelem Reservation in northern Washington.  Here Joseph quietly lived, a revered figure, until his death September 21st, 1904.<br>
<br>
Joseph was buried in a little graveyard at Nespelem only fifteen miles from Coulee Dam.  His burial spot is hardly suitable for a mountain-bred man.  On a recent September day a high wind was blowing yellow dust across the valley towards pine trees a tantalizing distance away.<br>
<br>
The parched earth of the enclosure was covered with dried weeds, against which the wind threw flecks of sand.  Artificial flowers were on some of the otherwise unmarked graves.  The old chief has a small white monument which gives both his names, Joseph and Hin-mah-too-yah-lah-kekt.  His short epitaph briefly recites his deeds.<br>
<br>
It would take more room than that afforded by a small monument to relate the valor and virtue of Joseph. judged by any standard, white or red, he was a notable man.  Few Indians have deserved better treatment; still fewer have received worse.<br>

THE NOOKSACK WAR<br>
<br>
Edmund C. Fitzhugh, "The Nooksack Indians, reports of special Indian Agent Edmund C. Fitzhugh from Bellingham Bay Agency, 1858-
1859," quoted by Percival R. Jeffcott,  <B>Nooksack Tales and Trails.</B> Ferndale: Whatcom County Historical Society, 1949 p. 27-31.<br>
(excerpts).<br>
<br>
There are three accounts of this incident, the one given by John Fravel probably being the most authoritative, he having- taken part in the affray.  It took place in 1859, one account says 1860 at the close of the gold rush, when the Nooksacks were still wrought up over the arbitrary treatment they had received from the miners.  The story as John Fravel told it, is given in Roth's History.<br>
<br>
From the three accounts given, all of which differ in some details, it seems that a relative of John Tennant's wife-herself an Indian princess-had been killed by a Nooksack at Port Townsend.  As always, the Indians were strong believer in the doctrine of "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth," so the Lummi relatives of Clara, Tennant's wife, called for vengeance against the murderer, and brought influence to bear through her on  John Tennant, who was an assistant Indian Agent, to aid them in running down the culprit.<br>
<br>
Now Tennant being a lawyer, no doubt knew the legal procedure in such cases, but being on the  outskirts of civilization, where legal precision was sometimes overlooked, lent himself to the proposal that he arrest a prominent Nooksack to be held as hostage until that tribe surrendered the murderer.  Accordingly he proceeded to the Nooksack and seizing one Telis Kanim, a tyee of the tribe, brought him to Whatcom and placed him in durance vile in the old blockhouse on the hill, to be so confined under guard, until the wanted Nooksack should be surrendered.<br>
<br>
The action, looked at from all angles, was but upperhanded and arbitrary, and to the Nooksacks, who were still smarting under the ill treatment accorded them by the miners during the Gold Rush, it was a great insult to the whole tribe and called for immediate retaliation.  A council of war was ordered, and hias waw [big talk] resounded through the smokehouse, the main theme of the orators demanding open warfare on the whites at Whatcom and the rescue of their chief.  Thus the "Great Nooksack War" began.<br>

True to their decision and foaming with wrath, the Nooksack braves sought out their warpaint, and decorating themselves to strike fear in the hearts of the palefaces, planned the strategy of their campaign.<br>
<br>
The upshot of all their counseling, was the formation of two forces, armed to the teeth with their old Hudson's Bay guns and what other war equipment they could muster.<br>
<br>
Their strategy called for a simultaneous attack by land and water; thus, they figured, dividing the defensive strength of the few whites on the Bay.  Had they carried out their plans with pre-
cision, the Nooksacks' initial attack might have proved disastrous to the settlement; but they seemingly lacked generalship and co-
operation in carrying out the details of their blow.<br>
<br>
One division of warriors embarked in a number of canoes and proceeded down the Nooksack with instructions to make the onslaught from the Bay side of Whatcom: while the other with all their accoutrements of war headed overland on the Whatcom Trail from The Crossing.<br>
<br>
With pent up warwhoops these dusky braves stealthily made their way through the forests, fully expectant of striking a finishing blow to the whites and rescuing Telis Kanim.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the settlers on the Bay were all oblivious of these preparations  for  their   extinction.   Unfortunately the meager population was  considerably dispersed on the day chosen by the<br>
Nooksacks for the attack.  John Tennant, the immediate cause<br>
of the uprising, must have been out of the settlement, his name does not appear among those who were involved in the fight;  Captain  Henry  Roeder  and  his  helper  had  gone   to  Lummi<br>
on business, and most of the other leading characters of the hamlet must have been over at Sehome or elsewhere, leaving the defenseless<br>
particularly  vulnerable  to  invasion and  only  Roesell,   the   guard at the blockhouse, to hold the fort.<br>
<br>
Down the Nooksack the canoe force glided, unimpeded save for the three jams that closed the river.  But with many eager  braves to man the transits, the portages were quickly made, and before the day was half spent, the canoes emerged from the mouth of the river and headed across the Bay for Whatcom.<br>
<br>
Henry  Roeder  and  his  helper   had   just   finished   placing   a  number of cattle in a  pasture  near  the  site  of  present  Marietta,  when they noticed the canoes near the shore. Judging from the general appearance of the occupants and their actions, Roeder at
once  sensed trouble, and spurring their horses along the beach, the two men tried to reach Whatcom before the canoes arrived: but due to the roughness of the rout--there was no road-they failed to make it.<br>
<br>
Fortunately there were a number of hunters with their arms in town that day, and seeing a party of painted Nooksacks landing, they scented trouble and decided to be prepared for any emergency.<br>
<br>
Believing that the overland party of attackers had arrived by that time, and were hidden in the timber near the blockhouse awaiting the prearranged signal for the attack, the canoe Indians landed and proceeded up the hill with the hunters at a convenient distance watching them.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for the Nooksacks, their plans miscarried--the land force had not yet arrived and fearing they would be outnumbered, they demanded of Roesell that he open the blockhouse and free their chief<br>
<br>
This Roesell refused to do, whereupon one of the Indians rushed him with a vicious knife.  The two grappled and pulling his revolver, Roesell pumped the Indians side full of bullets as the Indian plunged his knife into that of the white man.  They both fell dead. At the same instant the hunters opened fire and a general melee started.<br>
<br>
Another Indian was shot dead and a third badly wounded.  Frightened by their losses and the failure of their land force to arrive, the Nooksacks became panic-stricken and fled up the hill past the site of Fourteenth street and the Whatcom Hotel, and headed out the Whatcom 
Trail to the north, followed as best <B>he </B>could, by the wounded Indian, who reached the top of the hill and then fell dead.<br>
<br>
Just at this juncture, Captain Roeder and his helper came on the scene, and realizing the danger to his family out on the farm some distance up the trail, he exclaimed, "Oh,'they will murder my family; come on and help me," and rushed up the hill after the fleeing Nooksacks.  At the top of the hill he saw the Indians running like wolves up the trail, and found the dead  warrior with an Indian woman bent over him screamed, "They have  killed my father; they have killed my father!"<br>
<br>
Grasping the woman's arm (one version says by the hair) he jerked her to her feet and told her to call after the fleeing Nooksacks that if<br>
they harmed  his  family  she  would be killed.<br>
<br>
Thus the Captain dragged the woman after him, but she was too frightened to do anything but scream.  Dropping his useless burden Roeder rushed on, at the same time letting out the most blood-curdling yells he could, to give the fleeing savages the impression that all the whites of the settlement were after them.<br>
<br>
The Captain's rather amusing ruse worked perfectly, and the frightened Nooksacks, imbued with the impression that the whites were close on
their heels, hightailed it so- speedily that the Captain was soon left far behind, though, as one of his Indian friends expressed it after-
ward, "He clattawawed like a mowich" ( a deer).<br>
<br>
When he reached his home, he found his family and a neighbor woman - on the porch which fronted the Trail, laughing at the unusual sight of the fleeing Nooksacks, and was innocently asked by them, "Why are you frightening those Indians so?"<br>
<br>
In all probability those red men who so lately had set out on the war-
path with such high spirits never stopped until they were safely ensconced, along with their land force tillikums, safely beyond<br>
the protecting waters of the Nooksack.  The Captain's strategy none the less, was probably all that saved the family from a massacre.<br>
<br>
Fearing the Nooksacks might seek reinforcements and return to the attack again, word was dispatched, to the United States Steamer Massachusetts, which was patrolling the Sound, for help. The steamer immediately put into Bellingham Bay and landed company of troops under Major Haller, who marched his men over the Whatcom Trail to the 
Nooksack, where by a surprise he surrounded the Indians' encampment.<br>
<br>
Fearful of the troops, the redmen humbly surrendered and promised to end hostilities.  To guarantee their agreement Major Haller took three members of the tribe as hostages and sent them to Fort Steilacoom for safe keeping; then carried out his part by releasing Telis Kanim from the "Skookum house" [jail] at Whatcom.<br>
<br>
After three months of probation, the Nooksacks having lived up to their promises, the three hostages were returned to their Nooksack illihees (homes); though somewhat reluctantly on their part, for they had been well fed and clothed and taught the a white man's 'waw waw [language].<br>
<br>
Thus ended the first and last actual uprising of the Nooksack Tribe, and thus closed the "Great Nooksack War," with total casualties of one white man and three Nooksacks killed, and one tribesman wounded.  It is said that for many years old settlers on the Bay would point out bullet scars on the old buildings about 13th, 14th and E and F streets in old Whatcom; but those mute proofs of the early hostilities have long since disappeared.<br>

<br>
There is but one more incident to relate in regard to Indian warfare and this is the battle with the Nooksacks which took place in 1859.  The story of this fight is best told by Theodore N. Haller, a son of Colonel Granville 0. Haller, who led this expedition and who was one of the most prominent figures in the early history of Puget Sound.<br>
<br>
In a sketch published in the "Washington historian," April, 1900, appears the following: "At this time (1859) the Navy Department had transferred to the Quartermaster's Department, United States Army, the 
steamship Massachusetts, four <B>guns, </B>to cruise the Sound and remove foreign or hostile Indians, and to protect and assist the operations of the boundary commissioners.<br>
<br>
Major Haller's company was assigned to this duty aboard ship, and while patrolling the waters of the Sound met a boat sent out to advise him that the Nooksack Indians had entered Whatcom in war paint and 
threatened the lives of the citizens and were resolved upon releas<B>ing 
</B>an Indian chief held in prison, which resulted in the killing of a white man, whereupon the inhabitants fired and killed four Indians.<br>
<br>
Haller landed his company at Whatcom, marched twenty-five miles, surprised the Indians, who did not know that troops were near, and demanded the war party as hostages to preserve peace.  They were surrendered, peace was assured and the boundary commissioners were enabled to pursue the survey without danger."<br>
<br>
For many years there were occasional Indian outrages, especially on the islands where settlers were few and isolated and escape was easy, but while many years later the Northern Indians gathered at the border and threatened reprisals against the whites, this attack upon Whatcom in 1859 was the last movement in force of the Indians against the whites, or of the whites against the Indians in Whatcom County.<br>
<br>
John Fravel, builder of the first telegraph line, describes this last array with the Indians in Whatcom County as the "Courthouse Battle," and says that the Indian Telliskannem was arrested and confined in the old blockhouse on Peabody hill when a I;and of fifteen or twenty Indians in full war paint came to rescue him.  A hunter, "Buckskin" Roessell, held them off.<br>
<br>
Fravel and others heard the noise of the shooting and saw Roessell being stabbed.  Soon a dozen white men armed with muzzle loaders drove the Indians off, killing three of them.  The f ollowing day slaves came to carry the bodies away.  The settlement was kept under guard for several days and, according to tqr.  Fravel, it was Dan Harris who carried word to General Haller, who pursued the Indians to the Nooksack valley.  Hugh Eldridge is authority for the statement that there is no instance on record where a Lummi Indian killed a white man
or outraged a white woman.<br>

Attacked by Indians in Southern Oregon.<br>

<br>
Tacoma Weekly Ledger. July 7,1893.<br>
<br>
From June 1853 until the summer of 1855 there was no trouble of any note with the Indians between the southern boundary of Oregon and the British line.  But during this time of seeming inactivity they were making arrangements for a general outbreak.  They were collecting arms and ammunition and perfecting plans by which at a stated time, they would make a general clean up of all the Boston men in Oregon and Washington.<br>
<br>
In October, 1855, when the country was as dry as powder and ready for the match there was a simultaneous move of all the coast Indians.  They were as well organized that their movements were almost as perfect as clock work.<br>
<br>
The Rogue River Indians were on the Table Rock reservation, in charge of Captain A.J. Smith of the United States Army.  They numbered about one thousand warriors, commanded by Old John, Sam and Jimby.<br>
<br>
About the 20th of October when the roads were lined with travelers and the mountains filled with small prospecting parties and the grain had all been harvested and when those thus diversely engaged least expected a disturbance, Indians were placed in small companies on all roads leading into the Rogue River valley, and seemingly almost at a given signal, the entire country from Umpqua Canyon to the Siskiyou mintains, fifty milbs in width and one hundred in length was aflame.<br>
<br>
The air was filled with the sound of the voices of the people engaged in their different occupations who were effected by the<br>
conflagration and was echoed and re-echoed until it lost itself forever among the reverberating hills.
<br>
We heard the wild war-whoop, the screams of frightened women<br>
and children, the keen crack of the rifle, the clatter of horses feet, and saw men flying in all directions endeavoring to do something for self-profection or for the protection of others, using their utmost efforts to collect the residents of the scattered settlements together.  It was a scene which time, with all its ups and downs, with all its real and imaginary pleasures, and to this many be added its three score years and ten, can never blot from memory of those who know from bitter experience what a heartrending number of scenes there were.<br>
<br>
While those scenes linger with me in my declining days, and are a part of my like and makeup, yet for the love and regard I have for my fellow man I trust those days with their darkness and bloodshed are of the past and that they will never be repeated.<br>
I was on my want from Crescent City to Jacksonville with a train of mules loaded with merchandise, and was camped with several other parties at the foot of Mooney mountain the night of the outbreak.  We had about one hundred fifty mules in our train, and they carried merchandise valued at fifteen thousand dollars.<br>
<br>
On the morning of the 21st of October, at an early hour, we were winding our way, single file, up the side of the mountain.  To our surprise before we reached the summit we were attacked by the Indians.  There were eighteen men in the party.  Our mules were drawn in four trains, a man armed with two Colts revolvers and a rifle, mounted on a bell horse, riding in front of each train.  The road was lined with heavy timber.  When the Indians made the attack the man in front turned his bell horse back on the run.<br>
<br>
The rattle of the bell, the braying of the mules, the whiz of the arrows, the six-shooters clear crack and the war-whoop of the savages made things quite lively for a while.  Three of our men were killed and six were wounded.  We lost lost one hundred of our mules and our goods.<br>
<br>
We killed seven Indians.  When Malcie's rifle cracked down  went<br>
an Indian.We made a hard fight and did all in our power to take with us our wounded and to save our two mules, on which was loaded our ammunition, but in spite of all our efforts we lost one of them.<br>
<br>
Our greatest sorrow was to leave our wounded comrades to the hands of the heartless foe, and it was augmented by not being permitted to bury our dead boys who had helped us so unflinchingly.<br>
The news of this outbreak spread like wildfire and soon Owlhouse creek, Sucker creek and Canyon creek were aware of what the
<br>
Indians had been doing and what they were expected to do.  The above named places were all important mining camps.  They were soon in arms and ready for the conflict.<br>
<br>
In less than ten hours there were companies formed under the leadership of Captains Frye, Hornbuckle and O'Neal, and were in hot pursuit of the savages . They were well mounted and otherwise prepared for any emergency.<br>
<br>
While the distance intervening between us and the hostiles  was<br>
being shortened as we retreated to open ground, and began making breastworks, utilizing our merchandise and mules as best we could.  We then made a charge on the Indians and drove them back.<br>
<br>
We hastily collected our scattered articles and turned our faces toward my ranch about ten miles distant, situated in Josephine County, Oregon.<br>
<br>
While on our way we added to our company eight women and children whom we found by the wayside without protection.  When we reached the ranch we found everything about as we left it, much to our surprise.  We buried our dead and then held a council to decide what to do.<br>
<br>
Whether to leave the place or make preparations for flight.  Our number was not large and what to do for the best was the all-absorbing question. our company consisted of twelve men and sixteen women and children.  We had twelve revolvers and twelve rifles.<br>
<br>
After consulting about the matter very carefully and taking the surroundings into consideration we decided that if we were to go out and should come in contact with Indians the chance would be against us, but thought if we remained situated where we were that we could withstand a hundred of the enemies.<br>
<br>
We had at that time two hundred head of cattle, fifty head of hogs, and sixteen head horses which we could not collect for at least three days and we were sure of an attack by the Indians before we could possibly collect our stock, so we decided to place guards on the outskirts to prevent the Indians from getting too near without our knowledge.<br>
<br>
We brought in our work cattie, stake up a line for a ditch around the house sixty feet from the buildings, put four men to cutting and dragging with the cattle, also a like number digging the ditch.  As fast as the timber was prepared it was placed in the ditch on end, thus making a very safe wall for our defence, and
so we worked day and night until our job was completed.<br>
<br>
The 23rd and 24th of October found everything ready excepting our gates.  At midnight on the 24th we saw the signal fire of the Indians on the mountain.  We knew then that our time was drawing to a close or at least, that a mighty struggle for life was near.<br>
We held a second council and came to the conclusion that the Indians were badly scattered and in order to avoid the three companies of miners who were <B>in </B>pursuit they had to scatter and they would not get together for an attack before daylight.<br>
<br>
We decided that six men, in twos were to follow Captain Frye's trail of sixty men, who had pursued the Indians from their recent attack on us at Mooney mountain; our party was to follow Ute valley as far as Salal Diggings,a mining camp about twenty miles from the settlement, all to secure all the help they could and return by twelve o'clock.  Tyler and Joul were to act as messengers and would return at any time.<br>
<br>
The Indians found themselves hard pressed by Captains Frye, Horn-
buckle and O'Neal, whose forces numbered about two hundred men.<br>
The remaining five men and myself now went to work in earnest.  We took up the puncheon floor and pinned them on the inside of the doors and windows, and cut openings from one room to the other so we might pass through to any part of the house without being exposed to the aim of the savages.  I then filled all the vessels we could find with water and placed them overhead in case of fire, for we well knew we would be burned out if the Indians made an attack.<br>
<br>
The building was "L" shaped, and two men were placed at each door to guard and defend in case the Indians came upon them.  The men were all well armed and each woman had a revolver.  The women were to guard and defend the house and the six men, including myself were to take our stand about one hundked yards from the building.  We were to secrete ourselves and await the coming of the Indians.<br>
<br>
We remained in this position until sunrise.  On the morning of the 24th everything was as still as Egypt's Triple Night, and in this fearful position or crisis, we noticed much to our discomfort four mounted Indians driving off several head of my stock.  James Thompson and W. H. Hornbuckle charged the Indians and they returned the fire and the fight was really on.  To our surprise we found we were surrounded by a band of one hundred fifty braves who were anxious for our scalps.<br>
<br>
In view of our unfavorable surroundings we thought it best for
ourselves to retreat to the house and did so.  Meantime we were fired upon by the Indians.  After we reached the house there was<br>
a lull until about eight o'clock a.m. We could see old Chief John on the hill above the house in a northerly direction, but well out of reach of the range of our guns.  He was so situated that he could see all that was going on below.<br>
<br>
We could hear him giving orders to his men and he advised them to crowd down a small ravine south of the house, and to get as near as they possibly could to the house.  When he gave command for them to charge and fire the building, seemingly to encourage his men he told them that there were only six of us and it would be an easy matter to take us on the first charge.  In view of the charge we expected them to make, I gave orders to withhold fire until the Indians came inside the stockade.<br>
<br>
There were two openings through which they could enter.  P4eantime I went to each man and tried to encourage them by saying that if each man would do his duty and stand firmly to his task and be as solid as a rock, that the Indians could not take us.  I impressed on them the responsibility of the fourteen women and children which we must protect at all hazards, even though we had to risk our lives, and further warned them that if the Indians were victorious there would be no hope for any of us, and that we would then all died at the hands of the savages.<br>
<br>
To my great satisfaction there was not a dissenting voice, but with steady nerve and tightly pressed lips they all nodded assent.  I further encouraged them by telling them that we had eighty-four shots without loading, and that the women would load the guns<br>
as fast as we could use them.<br>
<br>
I again returned to my post, gave instructions to the women, such as I deemed necessary under the existing circumstances.  About eight o'clock old John gave the order to charge.  The Indians came toward us, all of them stripped to the waist, at a keen run led by Fiery Bill, old John's son.  I had three men at each door ready to meet them as they came.  With them they had a log with which to burst our door and also carried a torch with which to fire the building.<br>
<br>
As they came through the gates we opened fire, and with deadly effect.  They hesitated for a moment, seeming to dread what seemed to be sure death.  They soon closed up, however, and on they came with a yell, and such a one as only Indians gave give under such circumstances.  By this time we had killed several and wounded a great many more.<br>

They set fire to the house and endeavored to break in the door, and the prospect seemed to indicate at the time that a hand to hand struggle was awaiting us but a continued stream of hot lead from our guns caused them to decide that to retreat was the wisest thing for them to do, so they left us, taking their dead with them.  Those who were wounded had managed to crawl outside the stockade.<br>
<br>
At this juncture a voice was heard calling that the building was on fire.  My mother took my place and kept up the firing while I made a hole through the roof from the inside and by using the water previously collected for the purpose soon put out the fire.  The result of the encounter was fourteen Indians killed and about twenty wounded.  We did not lose one, but the walls of our house were almost filled with lead.<br>
<br>
Everything was as quiet and still as death, save now and then the hard shrill voice of old John, until about twelve o'clock.  Not an Indian was to be seen.  They were in the meantime, reinforced by about forty braves.  Old John then ordered a second charge, which was obeyed with all the vim and energy they could command, but they met a shower of lead which proved too much for them and they fell back with heavy loss.<br>
<br>
Fiery Bill having fallen at the first fire.  His sudden disap-
pearance threw them into confusion from which it seemed impossible for them to recover.  The yard was filled with dead and wounded.<br>
In a conversation with old John afterward he said they would not have but the second and third charges but for the whisky they had obtained from one of the mules captured at the attack on Mooney mountain.<br>
<br>
"And," he added, " my men were wild and reckless, and had we been the victors we would have burned you all at the stake.<br>
In the second charge they again fired the building, but we succeeded in extinguishing the flames as we had done before.  Old John now advised his men to drink no more firewater, sober up and get themselves in shape to fight as the miners were after them.  He said they would make one more effort, and if they failed he would retreat.<br>
<br>
From early morning until three p.m. a few Indians could be seen moving about through the timber.  About four o'clock they made the third charge.  A rifle ball from one of their guns came through the port hole where I was located, giving me a flesh wound and knocking me senseless for a few moments, thought it seemed to me an age.<br>
<br>

During this time my wife sprang to the rescue, seized my gun and shot one of the leaders just as he was in the act of bursting in the door.<br>
<br>
By the time I gained consciousness the house was again on fire, and the fire was fast getting a good start.  The house burning and surrounded by the Indians, our chances for life looked pretty slim, and to add to the gloomy surroundings, we had in our guns our last round of powder.<br>
<br>
Almost forced by circumstances to give up, no trace of help, we turned our attention to the all-absorbing question of what seemed the best to do.  Just then I heard a noise, I listened with almost breathless suspense.  It was the noise of horses' feet, but was it the approach of friend or foe--of more enemies coming to hasten our doom? Who would answer?<br>
<br>
To our delight and great satisfaction it was Captain Frye.  He was coming at breakneck speed to our rescue, Jack Whitesell in the lead.  They had heard our fighting at a distance of two miles which proved an incentive to double their efforts to reach us in the shortest time possible.  The old adage, "The darkest hour is just before dawn," proved true for us for just as all resources and hope was gone help came.<br>
<br>
The Indians retreated and we kept up our firing for two miles.  Reaching the Indian camp we found they had killed eighty head of our cattle.  We routed all the Indians from their camp, the women and children retreating under the cover of brush and timber.<br>
<br>
Captain Frye, seeing that to follow them further would be hazardous withdrew his men, having lost one man killed and two wounded.<br>
<br>
At sundown Captain O'Neal arrived with sixty men, and about dark Captain Hornbuckle came in with eighty men, making in all about two hundred men.  They complimented us for holding the fort when the chances seemed against us, but when they heard of the bravery of the women they gave vent to cheer upon cheer.  As an individual compliment the name of Old Chief was bestowed upon me, and the name I bore, gracefully as I could until my departure from that part of the country.<br>
<br>
A short time after dark Old John formed his men on the hill above the house.  The sergeant of the chief asked if Jim Hornbuckle was
in our company, and said if he was they wanted to see him.  Horn-
buckle was a dead shot, could speak the Indian language, and was well versed in Indian tactics.  Hornbuckle himself answered the sergeant, and invited him to come down.  At the sound of his voice the Indians fired a volley, but the shot passed above our heads and no one was hurt.<br>
<br>
Hornbuckle shouted to his men to charge, which they did in double quick, he being in the lead.  He had with him about one hundred and fifty men.  They ascended the hill yelling and shouting and the Indians fled in all directions.<br>
<br>
On the following morning not an Indian was to be seen.  I was advised to move out to Fort Brigg, which was situated at the mouth of Sucker Creek, where other families were collected.  Early that morning we started with a guard of about thirty men.  Soon after our arrival here I learned that the Indians had ambushed Tyler and Joul at the old crossing of Deer creek.  We never heard more of Tyler.  About three months later we found the remains of a man supposed to be Tyler, which we collected and interred, giving it all the honors of a Christian burial, trusting that his soul was at rest.<br>
<br>
Of the two hundred men who came to my relief only two are now living to tell the tale.  They are Greenville Blake of Laramie post office, Lincoln county, and Jack Cuthbert of Salem, Oregon.  I am solemnly impressed that ere long there will be no one@@ left to tell of these adventures, and there will be no record of the trials, hardships and deprivations of the early settler on the Pacific coast except that now being written for the public press, which we hope is interesting to all.<br>

PIERRE'S HOLE BATTLE.<br>
<br>
Bradley H. Patterson,Jr., "The Pierre's Hole Fight," <B>Great Western Indian Fights.</B> Garden City: Doubleday and Company, 1960, p. 30-38.<br>
<br>
Near the northwest edge of Wyoming, three sharp peaks spiral into the expansive sky.  Here is the triumvirate of the American Alps: to the caravans of westward-crawling explorers, "the pilot knobs-; to the lonely French trappers, "les trois Tetons.-<br>
<br>
Down from the steel-blue granite fastness of the Teton Range lie two valleys-crowded these days with July tourists, but shouting with history from the mere century and a quarter back when solitary bands of beaver-hunters were the only white men in the western half of the continent.  Then, as now, the Tetons looked down-to the east into Jackson's Hole, a crossroads of the trappers' wilderness, to the west into Pierre's Hole, meeting place and battleground.<br>
<br>
There was no reason to use the elegant word "valley- when the mountain man's one-syllable "hole" would mean much the same: a plain, ringed with sheltering mountains where there were convenient streams, grass, game, and firewood.  The early West was dotted with "holes" (the bigger ones were "parks") and in these protected flats the mountain men camped, wintered, and held their yearly fur-for-supplies Rendezvous.<br>
<br>
Whereas in Jacksons Hole (named for an early fur-trapper) the Teton escarpment plummets dramatically eastward with nary a foothill between summit and sagebrush, on the Pierre's Hole side the mountains come down to the plain in a tumble of basins, ridges, and draws.  Across this Hole, forming its western and southern boundaries, are the Big Hole and the Palisade Ranges.<br>
<br>
The waters in Pierre's Hole (the south fork of the Teton River) flow northward, emptying into the Henry's Fork of the Snake River near present-day Rexburg, Idaho.<br>
<br>
Pierre's Hole immortalizes the name of -le vieux Pierre Tivanitagom" This worthy, also known as -le grand Pierre was one of the leaders of the considerable number of Iroquois Indians whom the British Northwest Company imported from near Montreal into the Pacific Rocky Mountain area.<br>
<br>
The British purpose here was to use these Indian, already superb canoeists, as trappers also, and it is stated that a full third of the Northwest Company employees were Iroquois.  These Indians gave the British as much trouble as assistance; both McKenzie and Alexander Ross complain about them, and in 1825 Pierre and several of his colleagues were among the eleven Indians and twelve trappers
who, with their seven hundred pelts, deserted Britisher Peter Skene Ogden and joined Enenne Provosts band of Ashley men.<br>
<br>
Pierre himself was killed by the Blackfeet in the winter of 1828 while serving with an Ashley brigade.  We do know that Pierre and his Iroquois comrades had trapped extensively in this Upper Snake River region, at times with Alexander Ross, at times "on their own" during the years 1823-24.<br>
<br>
In 1832, not satisfied with establishing its trading-post monopoly along the Upper Missouri, the American Fur Company was intensifying the competition.  This summer (and the next) it too would be represented some ninety strong at the Rendezvous; it too would outfit a supply train and, sending it from the Company's steamboat wharves at Fort Pierre or Fort Union, would try to beat the Rocky Mountain Fur Company caravan to the Rendezvous.<br>
<br>
The reason was elementary: the first supply train to get to Rendezvous would get much of the business and most of the furs for that year.<br>
<br>
Thus the setting in early July of 1832: the three Tetons looking westward over their lofty shoulders to see forgathering in the upper part of Pierre's Hole some 250 trappers, plus some 200 lodges of Nez Perce, Flathead, Snake, and Bannock Indians.  In a cloud of dust, coming across Green River Valley, was the Rocky Mountain supply caravan-180 mules loaded with trade goods and 110-odd men, captained by William Sublette, himself a trapper.<br>
<br>
In the Big Horn Valley farther to the north, and in an equal hurry, was the rival supply train of the American Fur Company, under Lucien Fontenelle. (From Rendezvous the Rocky Mountain Fur partisans successively sent two advance parties out to hurry Sublettes caravan along.  The American Fur Company men likewise sent scouts for Fontenelle.).<br>
<br>
But coming up from the south was a large band of Gros Ventre Indians.  Here were 150-200 men, women, and children, heading homeward after one of their tribe's periodic visits with their for-
mer neighbors and kinsmen, the Arapahoes of Colorado.<br>
<br>
Wanting to avoid their mortal enemies, the Crows, and perhaps to get a few shots at their less feared enemies the Flatheads, this band of Gros Ventres was traveling west of the Divide-on a course which would lead them straight through Pierre's Hole.<br>
<br>
On its trek westward, the Sublette and Campbell supply train found itself being augmented.  At Independence, Sublette consented to have Nathaniel J. Wyeth (of Cambridge, Massachusetts) and his band of twenty-three other eastern greenhorn entrepreneurs travel with his train. (The western fur trade was getting crowded.) Six of the Wyeth
party turned back before they were across South Pass.<br>
<br>
Near Laramie Fork, Thomas (Broken Hand) Fitzpatrick came riding up to meet them, to urge them to hurry, since they were being raced to Rendezvous this year and the race was crucial.<br>
<br>
Broken Hand then wheeled about and rode off west again to<br>
tell the waiting trappers and Indians that Sublette was on his way.  But a single man in the mountains was fair game for any lurking Indians, and the Gros Ventres were on the move in the vicinity.<br>
<br>
Some of them spied Fitzpatrick at Green River, chased him, wore out his horse, and would have had his scalp had he not hidden artfully under some rocks and brush for six hours until the coast was clear enough for him to continue on foot.<br>
<br>
His raft on the Snake upset, too, but when his searching companions found him, though he had only a knife with him, he was still heading straight for Pierre's Hole.  He was badly emaciated and, although he still had his scalp, its reported metamorphosis was to give him a new name-white Hair.<br>
<br>
Where the Sweetwater freshens the North Platte, a group of trappers came into camp-bedraggled and starving.  They were from a small, independent, and nearly bankrupt St. Louis outfit (Gant and Blackwell) and had come out the year before.  They sold their furs and joined the caravan.  Near Green River came still another addition-Alexander Sinclair and thirteen free trappers. At Green River, the mathematics were different. Around midnight on July 2 the supply-train camp was attacked by Gros Ventres.  Ten horses were subtracted.<br>
<br>
Six days later, at noon of July 8, 1832, the Sublette caravan<br>
came boisterously jangling  into  Pierre's  Hole  from  the south<br>
amid a fusillade of celebrative rifle shots.  They had won their race with Fontenelle.  The Rocky Mountain Company reaped a wealth of plews that summer (actually, the last great harvest of the fur trade).<br>
<br>
Bill Sublette learned there was more money in the supply business than in the far-hunting itself.<br>
<br>
The trading and revelry went on for more than a week.  Then back to the year's business.  For Sublette, his packs heavy with furs, back to St. Louis.  For the trappers, lightheaded and empty-handed, back to the Green River, the Snake River, and the Yellowstone, to the Owyhee and the Humboldt, back to the Salmon and the Bear, to the Wind and the Bighorn.<br>
<br>
The aspens would soon be gold again, the beavers' coats would be
thickening.  There would be autumn campfires with hump-rib and beaver tails roasting and spitting in the coals.  The snow would soon whiten a thousand peaks, the wind blasting the leaves from the cottonwoods.<br>
<br>
With pack animals and spare horse, the scattered brigades would be threading their way along a hundred mountain trails-wagon routes of the next decade, roads of the next century.  Some of the mountain men would take new squaws with them, for warmer, less lonely nights in winter quarters in South Park or on the Popo Agie.<br>
<br>
Some would see each other again at next summer's Rendezvous on Horse Creek; a few would rendezvous only with a Blackfoot arrow or a grizzly's fang.  This was life in the American West in the 1830s-but it would go on only as long as hats were made of beaver.<br>
<br>
On July 17 the Rendezvous began to break up.  Bill Sublette's brother Milton led a band of thirteen trappers up to the end of the Hole on their way southwestward.  With them were Sinclair and fifteen of his men, and Wyeth and ten of his.  They camped eight miles south of Rendezvous.<br>
<br>
When breaking camp next morning, they espied a long file of approximately 150-200 Indians, some on horseback but mostly on foot, coming down a gap in the mountains ahead of them.  Not Fontenelle and his caravan, but Gros <B>Ventres</B>.<br>
<br>
The trappers did two things immediately-they threw up emergency breastworks (the packs from their mules) and sent two riders off down the Hole to the Rendezvous, to round up white and red reinforcements.<br>
<br>
Most of the Gros Ventre women and children retreated to the mountains; the braves prepared for an attack in force on what they supposed was only a small brigade of trappers.  To gain time, the Gros Ventres sent forward a war chief, unarmed, with red blanket and peace pipe.  The veteran trappers recognized this ruse for what it was.<br>
<br>
One of Sublette's men was Antoine Godin, an Iroquois half-breed, whose father had been killed by the Blackfeet two years back.  Godin rode forward and with him rode a Flathead brave whose tribe had been subject to years of Gros Ventre and Blackfoot marauding.<br>
<br>
The Gros Ventre chief stretched out his right hand; Antoine took it.  To his Flathead companion, he shouted "Fire!" and the chief was killed on the spot.  They scalped him, took the richly decorated blanket as booty, and galloped back to the group of trappers.  A new modus operandi for Cambridge; Wyeth's brother exclaims in writing, "This was a job with a vengeance-art thou in health my brother?"<br>

But one will remember what the Gros Ventres were like.<br>
<br>
The furious Indians at once dove into a deep, swampy woods and began to pile up a fortification of logs and branches, their women digging trenches behind it.  This seemed too redoubtable a stronghold to take by storm, and the trappers stayed at long range.  It wasn't long before Bill Sublette came riding up with eager reinforcements from the Rendezvous-one or two hundred trappers and four or five hundred Nez Perces and Flatheads.<br>
<br>
Bill Sublette took charge, irritated that more decisive action had not already been taken.  He ordered Wyeths Boston greenhorns to stay back, then led Wyeth himself, Sinclair, Campbell, and some sixty other red and white volunteers into the willow grove.  Sublette and Campbell made verbal wills as they advanced, naming each the other as executor.<br>
<br>
Unnecessary for them, as it turned out, but one hopes that Sinclair had made one-he was hit as they went forward and died later after Campbell had carried him out of the woods.<br>
<br>
Sublette saw a small hole between the logs, and an Indian's eye behind-a literal bullseye when Sublette shot at it.  Then it was his tum to get shot-a wound in the arm took him out of the giving of commands.  The battle, though for a time he kept on shouting.<br>
<br>
The attacking trappers had now split into two enfilades, but in the 1830s there were no walkie talkies.  They got on opposite sides of the stockade, and there was some highly unfortunate cross fire.<br>
<br>
When the lead began to get low (the mountain men had to come back the next day to dig bullets out of the trees), epithets were used as supplements.  The trappers threaded nearer and nearer through the woods, brush, and vines.  "The idea of a barbed arrow sticking in a mans body, as we had observed it in the deer and other animals, was appalling to us all, and it is no wonder that some of our men recoiled from it," John Wyeth later wrote.<br>
<br>
OccasionaUy a Flathead would rush forward, fire, and snatch a blanket from the defending breastworks as a trophy.  One trapper, high-"spirited," climbed onto the top, peered down, then fell in with two bullets through his skull.  The trappers then decided on an old Blackfoot custom-to set fire to the woods.<br>
<br>
Their red accomplices protested vehemently-not that it wasn't sporting, not that they minded Blackfoot incineration, but fire would endanger what was really important-the plunder and booty they were anticipating.  The mountain men overruled these objections and instructed the squaws to gather faggots.<br>

The Gros Ventres now tried a ruse.  They announced to the attackers that they might die in flames, but let the trappers beware there were four hundred more lodges of their Gros Ventre brethren who were near and who would avenge them.  The Gros Ventres at this point got an unexpected assist from the translating department.<br>
<br>
This final admonition was circuitously rendered into English by Flathead and Nez Perce interpreters-and came out that four hundred lodges of Gros Ventres were at that moment attacking and plundering the rendezvous camp itself, back down the Hole.<br>
<br>
Some trappers with poor judgment plus many more who  were  just  as  happy  to  extricate  themselves  from  this  encounter immediately rushed off to save their main camp, leaving only a small watch party.<br>
<br>
Those staying behind retreated to the edge of the grove.  Night fell. Some hours later the main body of trappers shamefacedly returned; they had found the rendezvous camp unmolested.  Now it was too dark and forbidding to charge in again at the Gros Ventres; the trappers mounted guard until morning.<br>
<br>
With the morning sun they advanced again toward the Indian breastworks.  There was silence; no opposition.  Closer they came -still no response.  Finally they rushed behind the stockade.  They found the Indians gone.  The Gros Ventres had made good their escape in the middle of the night, carrying off their wounded on litters that left blood stains on the trail side branches.<br>
<br>
In the stockade there were twenty or thirty dead horses and nine dead Indians.  More corpses were found through the woods, including bodies of several children, according to some reports.  There were some white dead-mutilated, Indian style.<br>
<br>
There was a wounded white man who died shortly, and a wounded Gros Ventre squaw whom the Flatheads dispatched without hesitation.<br>
The trappers' red allies got their plunder, too; the escaping<br>
<br>
Gros Ventres had left a lot of blankets,  tepees,  and   other   possessions as they fled.  A little farther into the mountains the trappers found a herd of forty-five horses where the Gros Ventre squaws had hidden them.<br>
<br>
Bill Sublette recognized some of these horses as his, proving that it had been members of this same Gros Ventre band who had attacked his camp at Green River on July 2.<br>
<br>
The mountain men buried the dead behind the breastworks and counted up the final score-five trappers and seven friendly Indians killed, six whites and seven red allies wounded.  The Gros Ventres later admitted they had lost twenty-six of their band -which in savage
reporting systems probably meant a good many more. There continued to be violent repercussions in the aftermath of the fight.<br>
<br>
The trappers and their allies all went back to Rendezvous and waited a few days, taking care of Bill Sublette's wound.  The leader of the Gant and Blackwell trappers (whom Sublette had met on the Platte) decided that Sublette had gypped him.  His name was Stephens and he, plus four free trappers and three of the Wyeth part who had had enough started eastward ahead of Sublette-over Teton Pass.  Two of this party were Daniel Boone's grandsons.<br>
<br>
The Gros Ventres were waiting for them.  One trapper and one Bostonian gave their scalps to the Gros Ventres and their bones to the forest, there overlooking Jackson's Hole on one of the most scenic mountainsides in America. Stephens himself was mortally wounded and with the luckier survivors, came back across the pass to die in Pierre's Hole.<br>
<br>
In the Hoback River country, latecomer Fontenelle, still en route with the American Fur Company's supply caravan, came head-on into the retreating Gros Ventres.  Fontenelle, however, was suspicious and on guard, and the Gros Ventres were still licking their wounds.<br>
<br>
After a formal parley, Fontenelle sent fifteen of the Gros Ventres down the Green River a ways to where  Captain Benjamin Eulalie de Bonneville of the Seventh Infantry U. S. Army, out fur-trapping on a two-year leave, was building  a frontier trading post.  Bonneville treated the murderous Gros Ventres  civilly  though  watchfully,  in  spite  of   being   egged   on   to simultaneously slaughter them all by several Crows who were paying the new fort a visit .The fifteen got neither scalps nor horses.<br>
<br>
The Sublette and Campbell train, loaded with 168 packs of beaver pelts worth $85,000, made an intentional detour in order to avoid any second encounter with the Gros Ventres-and miscalculated.  Sublette ran into the main Gros Ventre body, who had heard of their relatives' defeat; they were now wearing war paint, ready for trouble.<br>
<br>
The veteran Sublette, however, subtracted twenty-five pounds of tobacco from his wares and negotiated his way out of danger.<br>
<br>
Yet after their great defeat and these lesser frustrations, the Gros Ventres' worst tribulations were still ahead of them.  The survivors of the Pierre's Hole battle rejoined the main tribal body and, shunted off course by the fight, continued their migration northward-east of the Divide-in Crow country.<br>
<br>
Here, in the Absaroka Mountains, men, women, children, and possessions fell to the Crows-traditional enemies of all Blackfeet. 
What few surviving members of the migrating Gros  Ventres  finally  got  into  the Upper Missouri home country told their story to their other Blackfoot neighbors, with lasting effect.<br>
<br>
For the next two decades these two tribes strongly resisted any attempts at white settlement in their homeland.  They sought out and killed the lone hunters and trappers and raided wagon trains.  In fact, the echoes of the shots fired over the Pierre's Hole breast-
works were heard in the Upper Missouri country for a long time.<br>

In Pierre's Hole the roistering at last came to an end and the rendezvous began to break up.  The first party to set out was led by Bill Sublette's brother Milton.  He left on the afternoon of July 1 7 with a brigade bound for the country north of Great Salt Lake.<br>
<br>
They camped f or the  first  night  some  six  or  eight  miles  south  of the rendezvous site.<br>
<br>
Soon after they started the next morning, a large band of Indians appeared in the distance, and as they drew nearer Milton made them out to be Gros Ventres.  That meant a fight.  He ordered his men to prepare themselves behind, a breastwork of their baggage, and sent two messengers posthaste back to the rendezvous to summon reinforcements.  The Indians halted at the base of a hill,<br>
forward one of their war chiefs broke out a white flag, and sent<br>
carrying a peace pipe.  Antoine Godin, a French half-breed, went<br>
ahead to meet him for a parley, accompanied by a Flathead.<br>
<br>
Godin's father had recently been murdered by the Gros Ventres, so he had no love for the tribe - He was too familiar with their ways to believe they wanted peace and was sure they had made this merely to gain time to prepare for battle.  As Godin rode up to him the Gros Ventre chief extended his hand in pretended friendship.<br>
<br>
The  half breed grasped it and held on firmly while Flathead <B>companion shot</B> the man dead.  They scalped him and dashed back to their own people, carrying his scarlet blanket flapping in the breeze behind them.  The enraged Gros Ventres began at once to make a rough breastwork of trees while the squaws dug gun pits behind it.
Bill Sublette arriving from Pierre's Hole with a strong rein-
forcement of trappers, Flatheads, and Nez Perce's, took command and ordered a charge, the whites to approach the enemy breast work from one flank and the Indians from the other.  The charge was not a success.  The only man who reached the breastwork climbed to the top of the logs and immediately fell back, riddled with bullets and arrows.<br>
<br>
Several others of the attackers were shot down, and Bill Sublette himself was seriously wounded.  They carried him back and propped him against a tree, where he continued to give orders.  An attempt to burn the enemy out of their fort failed, partly because the Indian allies objected to burning the loot they expected to collect.<br>
<br>
After this, both sides settled down to shooting at each other from<br>
behind   their   shelters,   tactics   that   continued   for   hours   without advantage to either.  Late in the afternoon, a Gros Ventre shouted from the breastwork that eight hundred more of their warriors were coming soon to end the affair.<br>
<br>
This threat was misunderstood, the whites taking it to mean that eight hundred Gros Ventres were at that moment looting the undermanned camp at Pierre's Hole.  Most of the men immediately rushed off to defend their friends and property, only to find when they got there that everything was as they had left it-no enemy had appeared,, nor did any appear during the night.<br>
<br>
The next morning, when everybody returned. to the field of battle, they found the Gros Ventre fort deserted.  The enemy, carrying their wounded, liad silently slipped away into the mountains.  A count of casualties showed that the trappers had lost twelve killed and thirteen wounded.  The losses of the Gros Ventres were never certainly known.  They left nine dead in the fort, and later admitted the loss of twenty-six warriors and all their baggage and horses.<br>
<br>
The battle of Pierre's Hole, the most severe ever fought between mountain men and Indians in the Rockies, brought the rendezvous of 1832 to an end.  All the participants soon pulled out, the supply caravans loaded with beaver pelts for St. Louis, the trapping bri-
gades for the mountain valleys to begin the fall hunt.<br>

BATTLE OF PIERRE'S HOLE<br>

Willard C. Hayden, "The Battle of Pierre's Hole," <B>Idaho Yesterdays.</B> XVI (Summer, 1972) p. 2-11.<br>
<br>
In the beautiful valley of Pierre's Hole the motley populace connected with the fur trade congregated in July of 1832.  Here the two rival fur companies, the independent Rocky Mountain Fur Company and John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company had their separate camps awaiting their yearly supply caravan so they could start on the fall hunt.<br>
<br>
In a camp a little apart from the big company camps was a band of free trappers led by a veteran named Alexander Sinclair, who had lost his toes to frostbite.  Here also the Indians connected with the fur trade-Nez Perce, Flatheads, and a few Snakes had pitched their lodges beside the streams and awaited the distribution of trade goods and finery.<br>
<br>
This wild and heterogeneous assemblage amounted to about a thousand men, women, and children and thousands of horses and dogs.<br>
<br>
There were more eyewitness accounts of the rendezvous of 1832 in Pierre's Hole and the famous battle that followed, than of almost any other episode in the mountain fur trade.  At least <B>the </B>mountain men who were present wrote accounts of these events that were later published .<br>
<br>
These contemporary journals and the many modern accounts concerned the actions and personalities involved rather than the location of the rendezvous and battle site-which was then over a thousand miles from the nearest white settlement.  Two of the participants separately revisited the site of the battle a year later, after the affair had been talked out thoroughly around many campfires.<br>
<br>
Their second accounts located the battle site by recognizable landmarks, and their location has been plotted. [The original article in Idaho Yesterdays has a map of the Pierre's Hole area immediately west of Victor, Idaho and the site of the rendezvous just south of the present community of Driggs, Idaho.].<br>
<br>
The broad valley called Pierre's Hole by mountain men, but now known at Teton Basin, is about thirty miles in length and fifteen ill width, bounded to the west and south by the Big Hole Mountains and overlooked to the east by three lofty peaks called the Three Tetons, which dominate as landmarks over a vast extent of country.<br>
Teton River, fed by creeks and mountain springs, pours through the valley toward the north and divides it into nearly equal parts.  As the well-watered valley has a flat gradient, the river is bordered by extensive swamps along its middle course.  The river and tributary creeks are lined with continuous aspen and cottonwood groves, while the grassy meadows and sagebrush prairies are devoid of timber clear to the forested mountain slopes.
<br>
The rendezvous camps were spread out over the many acres of meadows required to provide forage for the vast herds of horses.  Since the Rocky Mountain Fur Company brigades had led their rivals to rendezvous, they had the first choice of campsite.  Their supply caravan, led by their banker and purveyor William Sublette, was the only one to arrive in time for rendezvous, so their camp became the focal point of the rendezvous and garnered all the trade with the free trappers and Indians.<br>
<br>
For the leaders, rendezvous was a time for business-they brought in their fur packs, haggled about prices, bought their <B>annual </B>supplies, planned the fall hunt, and worried about Blackfeet.<br>
<br>
Everyone was happy this year because prices were high--six dollars a plew, or pelt, paid <B>in </B>goods marked up from five hundred to two thousand per cent from St. Louis prices.  The companies contracted to pay their men ruinously high wages for the year ahead, and the profits from the year's effort went back to St. Louis with Big Bill Sublette.<br>
<br>
The RMF Company partners (Bridger, Fitzpatrick, Milton Sublette, Fraeb, and Gervais) were former partisans, or fur brigade leaders, under Bill Sublette and they never quite got over the habit of taking orders from their former boss, who bad switched from the trapping operations to the more lucrative carrying trade.<br>
<br>
For the engages, or hired trappers, rendezvous was a time for fun.  They released pent-up longings accumulated during the past year in a magnificent debauch.  They bought everything their fancy and credit afforded.  Most important were liquor and women-commodities that were available to the average trapper for only a couple of weeks out of the year.<br>
<br>
The fiery liquor was brought to rendezvous in casks shaped to fit a mule pack, was progressively watered down from the spring as rendezvous proceeded, and was sold at mountain prices marked up one thousand per cent over those in St. Louis.<br>
<br>
A little tallow in the bottom <B>of </B>a cup to reduce volume was hardly noticed after a few drinks. This expensive commodity rated a hastily built log cabin and was dispensed by a trusted, sober, literate clerk-a rare individual in the mountains.<br>
<br>
The lonely white men avidly admired the small hands, beautiful feet, and beautifully formed limbs of young women when the Indian villages arrived at rendezvous.  The Snake girls were adjudged the best-looking in the mountains.  In the few years between puberty and marriage, the buffalo-eating Indian girls were lithe and strikingly beautiful.<br>

The girls of the Plains tribes were more fastidious in personal cleanliness than most frontier white women of that period, and they were cannier with feminine beauty tricks.  No Plains women except the Cheyenne were chaste by white standards, and their affection was easily aroused by the ardent attention of the mountain men.<br>
<br>
Traffic in the charms of wives and daughters was good business for the master of the lodge, and be brought his women to rendezvous as he brought his fur for trade.<br>
<br>
The Rocky Mountain Fur Company camp <B>was</B> located in the center of the valley, eight or ten miles from the summit of Teton Pass, according to the diaries of independent trader Nathaniel J. Wyeth and American Fur Company clerk Warren A. Ferris<br>
<br>
The first missionary to visit Pierre's Hole, the Reverend Samuel Parker, travelled the route three years later with Jim Bridger and described the location of the RMF Company camp as a five-hour trip from the western foot of Teton Pass-including the customary visit to the battle site.<br>
<br>
Eighteen miles from Teton Pass toward the center of the valley locates the rendezvous camp on Teton Creek near modern Driggs, Idaho.  This is a very logical camp site, as it is beyond the <B>normal </B>range of the hordes of mosquitoes infesting the swamps along Teton River.<br>
<br>
The ruins of a rude log cabin, identified by Indians as the rendezvous liquor store house, still stood at the big springs just southwest of Driggs when the first settlers arrived half a century later .<br>
<br>
The location of the other camps is of interest only in setting the scene of rendezvous.  Warren Ferris indicated that his camp, the American Fur Company's, was three or four miles down the valley from their rival's.  The AFC caravan, led by Lucien Fontenelle, was late leaving Fort Union and did not arrive at rendezvous.<br>
<br>
Their partisans, Andrew Dripps and Henry Vanderburg, travelled to Green River to meet it and obtain their supplies for the next season. They returned to Pierre's Hole in accordance with a plan which called for them to follow their more experienced rivals, Jim Bridger and Tom Fitzpatrick on their fall hunt in hopes of discovering the best beaver streams.<br>
<br>
As Fontenelle's caravan arrived too late to get any of the <B>Indian </B>or free trapper trade, the trade surplus had to be secretly cached before the trappers started <B>out </B>on their fall hunt.  This cache was made during the hours of darkness in the horse corral of their camp so that the hoof prints would obliterate any sign of digging.  The railroad siding called Cache is nearby.
The Indian allies traditionally favored a campsite in the cottonwood groves <B>along </B>North and South Leigh creeks.  This area was near the camas meadows where the delicate flowers carpeted the prairie with a bluish sheen in late spring.  By July the blossoms had faded and the women could dig the bulbs with curved sticks.<br>
<br>
The joys of rendezvous were occasionally sobered by the dreadful stories of Blackfoot belligerence.  The continued presence of large bands of hostile Gros Ventres in nearby Jackson Hole and on Green River served to keep the leaders of rendezvous on the alert.<br>
<br>
The Gros Ventres were considered as a band of the Blackfoot Nation, along with Bloods, Piegans, Blackfeet, and Sarsi, although they were ethnic relatives of the more peaceful Arapahoe.  As they had acquired all the belligerent customs of the Blackfeet and had intermarried extensively, it was not unreasonable to call them Blackfeet as most of <B>the</B> trapper accounts did.<br>
<br>
The Gros Ventre bands were returning to the Three Forks area of Montana from a discordant visit to their Colorado kinsmen, with whom they no longer had much in common, when they first clashed with William Sublette's caravan on Boulder Creek west of the Wind River Mountains.<br>
<br>
They tested the Sublette camp and found it too strong for anything but a determined assault.<br>
More to their taste was Tom Fitzpatrick travelling alone ahead of Sublette's caravan. In a vigorous chase they captured Fitzpatrick's horses but failed to get his hair.  A favorite western myth is that Fitzpatrick's hair turned white overnight because of the rigors of this pursuit.  However, none of the many eyewitness accounts mentions this purported medical curiosity although they fully report his escape.  Nevertheless, it is a good story that continues to be retold.<br>
<br>
After the business and pleasures of rendezvous, the brigades of the RMF Company partners, Milton Sublette and Henry Fraeb, were the first to go to work on the fall hunt.  Milton was the younger brother of Big Bill Sublette and was often over shadowed by his famous brother.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, he was known as the Thunderbolt of the Rockies and at this rendezvous probably acquired a Snake bride-the beautiful, semi-
legendary Mountain Lamb.  Tough, wolfish Henry Fraeb spoke with a heavy German accent and pronounced his name as Frapp.  The journals used this spelling, causing some to assume that Fraeb and Frapp were separate individuals.<br>

The two brigades were scheduled to trail southern Idaho and the Wasatch Mountains, respectively, and initially to travel together as far as Raft River for mutual security while still in Blackfoot territory.<br>
<br>
For this same reason Nathaniel Wyeth's New England greenhorns and Alexander Sinclair's free trappers also accompanied the Rocky Mountain Fur Company party.<br>
<br>
The party's first day of travel was only a short slow march of seven miles, undertaken to get the trappers away from the women and liquor back at rendezvous." The next day's goal was a twenty-five-mile journey to reach the ford across the Lewis (Snake) River at the lower <B>end </B>of Swan Valley.<br>
<br>
Two of the journals indicate a mistake of greenhorns in the<br>
mountains, an inability to determine the direction of the water drainage.  Nathaniel Wyeth and Zenas Leonard both reported that they were traveling down the valley while their course was south and up the valley.  Wyeth also speculated erroneously <B>on </B>the topography ahead, reporting that the Teton River flowed out of the valley through Pine Creek Pass, when it actually reaches the Snake in the opposite direction.<br>
<br>
These lapses have caused false conclusions on the location of both rendezvous and the subsequent battle, even leading to suggestions that the battle occurred outside Pierre's Hole.<br>
<br>
The RMF Company camp of July 17, was in a cottonwood grove about seven miles south of the rendezvous on Trail Creek, just above the swamps near the bend of Teton River.  Just as the party was breaking camp the next morning, a party of travellers was observed coming dow Trail Creek from Teton Pass.<br>
<br>
As Fontenelle's caravan was expected from this direction, it caused no great alarm; but in this country nothing could be taken for granted.  Wyeth's telescope revealed that they were Indians who must be assumed to be hostile.  Two eyewitness accounts describe the encounter:<br>
<br>
Nathaniel Wyeth: <B>"On </B>the 18th we did not leave camp, when near starting we observed two parties of Indians coming out of the pass about 200 in number with but few horses.  After securing our camp our riders went out to meet them and soon found them to be Blackfeet."<br>
<br>
John Ball: "We bad a quiet night but in the morning, as we were about to commence our day's march, Indians were seen in line of marc on horse back off across the prairie, say some two miles.  And the trappers at once decided they must see who they were.  So Fraep told Antoine Godin,  the half-breed, to take a good horse and  have an
Indian of the party go with him and see who they were.  As Antoine approached them he saw they were Blackfeet."<br>
<br>
At a distance of a mile the two suspicious groups halted and watched each other. Both needed time, the whites to let their rendezvous friends come up and the Indians to complete their religious ritual for battle. A war chief wearing a scarlet blanket and carrying a tribal medicine pipe rode out alone across the prairie toward the trappers. He displayed the medicine pipe as a peach pledge, indicating a solemn declaration that the Indians would observe a truce, at least for the time being.<br>
<br>
Henry Fraeb sent out the half breed Iroquois trapper 'Antoine Godin with a Flathead interpreter to parley with the stanger. As the two rode up they recognized the thick squat bowl of cream soapstone with its long flat wooden stem as Blackfoot.  The two knew from bitter experience that Blackfoot truces were one-way only.<br>
<br>
Two years previous, the Blackfeet had killed Antoine's father, Thyery Godin, on Big Lost River, and the Flatheads had long been hard pressed by their traditional enemies.  For generations the Blackfeet, armed with Northwest Company muskets, had waged an extermination campaign against their Snake, Nez Perce, and Flathead enemies, who were still armed with stone-tipped arrows until the coming of the trappers.<br>
<br>
The Gros Ventre chief brandished his medicine pipe and held out his hand in friendship as the two rode up.  The pair had made their plans as they rode and they lost no time in executing them.  Godin grabbed the chief's hand and the Flathead shot him out of his saddle.  They took his  scalp  and  galloped  back  triumphantly  waving the scarlet blanket.<br>
<br>
The tenderfeet travelling with the trappers were horrified by this breach of faith on the white side, but <B>the </B>veteran trappers considered it a proper way to handle Blackfeet.<br>
<br>
The accounts by the veteran mountaineers failed even to mention the incident, so there could be some suspicion that it was only a literary accretion.  However, the accounts by the greenhorns<br>
have the ring of truth.<br>
<br>
When their medicine had failed, the angry Gros  Ventre  began  a  noisy preparation for the battle while the trappers sent an express back to rendezvous for aid.  The two sides sparred cautiously at distant rifle range until reinforcements arrived.  Wyeth's greenhorns did not consider themselves obligated to participate in a fight started by the whites and remained as spectators.  Wyeth, however, personally took an active part in the clash.<br>
<br>
By tradition and preference, the Blackfeet travelled on foot and fought from ambush.  As they were one of the first Plains tribes to
acquire guns but one of the last to acquire horses, they had long ago learned the advantage of fighting defensively from log fortifications where their aimed fire counted more than the ritualistic bravado of mounted Indians.<br>
<br>
Leisurely and confidently the Gros Ventre warriors completed the religious preparations required by their culture,while their wives piled up log breastworks and dug foxholes in the aspen and cottonwood groves along Trail Creek.<br>
<br>
Just as leisurely, the whites prepared to beseige the Gros Ventre in their tanglewood fortifications.  The four brigade partisans were all capable leaders, <B>but </B>they were content to await .The arrival of Big Bill Sublette to take command. Most of the celebrated mountain men were present: Jim Bridger, Tom Fitzpatrick, Milton Sublette, Henry Fraeb, Jean Baptiste Gervais, Nathaniel Wyeth, Alexander Sinclair, Henry Vanderburg, Andrew Dripps, Joe Meek, and Robert Campbell.<br>
<br>
It was later a mark of prestige with the mountain men to have fought in the battle.  Notable absentees included Kit Carson, Jedediah Smith, and Captain William Drummond Stewart, who were important in the area in other years.<br>
<br>
The friendly Indians also gained great honor by being in the battle, and even greater glory for those wounded.  The young Nez Perce warrior Hallalhotsoot and Bill Sublette maudlinly reminisced over the battle when they met at the 1834 rendezvous on Ham's Fork.<br>
<br>
This same warrior was still talking of the battle fifty years later when he was called Lawyer and was head chief of the Treaty Nez Perce.  Another Nez <B>Perce </B>of note, Tackensuatis, was wounded in the belly and was henceforth nicknamed Rottenbelly.<br>
<br>
William Sublette's letter to General William Ashley gives a satisfactory account of the battle; Sublette was its principal figure:<br>
<br>
Lexington, Mo.<br>
<br>
Sep. 21st 1832<br>
<br>
Dear Sir-<br>
<br>
Left the settlements on the 13th of May, and on the 2nd of July on the head of the Colorado of the West [Green], a party of Blackfeet Indians endeavored to enter <B>my </B>camp at night, but finding a strong guard around it they thought it dangerous, and, after securing <B>some </B>loose horses and finding they could get no more, they fired on us and immediately ran off.  The only injury sustained was two mules slightly wounded.<br>
<br>
I arrived on the waters of the Columbia River on the 4th of July and
on the 8th at the rendezvous of the Rocky Mtn.  Hunters, on the Columbia River, west of the Three Teton Mtns.<br>
<br>
On the 18th of July, about 6 miles from my camp, an engagement took place between a small party of whites who had started for their hunting grounds the (lay before, and a party of Blackfeet Indians.  An express was immediately sent to my camp, and I was joined by a considerable number of whites and some friendly Indians of the Pierced-Nose and Flathead Nations to go to the assistance of those engaged.<br>
<br>
When we arrived at the spot we found the Blackfeet had taken possession of a point of woods surrounded by willows where they had formed a strong fort of fallen timber and had dug a hole in the ground inside the fort where they could be secure from our fire.<br>
<br>
Finding them thus fortified and that we were exposed to their fire on the prairie without being able to injure them, I proposed entering the willows and approaching their fort where we could be on more equal footing.<br>
<br>
I was joined by about 30 whites and as many friendly Indians making our force nearly equal to that of our enemy.  We advanced to within 15 paces of their fort and continued firing on them which they vigorously returned for some time.<br>
<br>
Discovering at length that they were too securely protected against our rifles we determined on burning their fort and when nearly prepared to apply fire to it, one of our friend Indians who spoke the Blackfeet language and held conversation with them during the engagement was told by them they were convinced we could kill them all, but that six or eight hundred warriors of their tribe were momentarily expected there who would give us enough of fighting.  Owing to the misconstruction of the interpreter who communicated it to the whites he was  understood to say that six or eight hundred warriors were then in the valley attacking our camp; consequently the fight was immediately discontinued and not until we got to the prairie was the matter properly explained.<br>
<br>
It was then deemed too late to renew the attack. We lost in the engagement Mr. St. Clair of Arkansas who was killed before we readied the fort.  Another man, who too fearlessly ventured up to the fort and fired into it received 2 balls in the head and was instantly killed on the spot, Thomas Quigley of St. Louis was Wounded in the head and I understand died on the 8th day afterward. He had started with a trapping party who were about thirty miles from my camp. Miller of Boone County in this state was severely wounded in the body which I fear will have proved fatal. Myself and three other whites were wounded. Six of the Pierced nose Indians killed and two wound.<br>
<br>
Next morning a party of whites went to the battleground and found the Indians had fled to the mountains in the night, bearing with
them their wounded on litters.  They left nearly all their baggage and had 9 warriors and 25 horses killed on the ground.<br>
<br>
On the 25th of July <B> </B>7 men started for Mo. and on the 26th came upon a party of about 20 Blackfeet who killed 2 of them. Moore and Foy, and wounded Alfred K.  Stephens of St. Louis supposed at the time not dangerous.  The party returned to the camp.  The wound of Stephens mortified and he died on the 30th of July.<br>
<br>
I left the rendezvous on the 30th of July and the Columbia River on the 3rd of August.  On the 4th passed the six or eight hundred warriors which we were told of by the party with whom we had the fight on July 18th.  I expected an attack from them daily but for some reason they passed us by.  My force was only 60 men.  My party arrived here on the 21st of Sept. all in good health.<br>
<br>
The whole number of men killed by the Blackfeet Indians, belonging to the different companies in that country during the last year, amounts to nine, a part of whom were killed after by arrival there.<br>
<br>
Very respectfully, your obedient servant-<br>
William L. Sublette<br>
<br>
General W. H. Ashley<br>
<br>
Captain Sublette had over 169 packs of prime beaver worth over $60,000 back at rendezvous that was loosely guarded by 60 greenhorns, hired lately from the waterfront of St. Louis.  The company trappers, or engages, bad their personally owned traps and gear completely unguarded.  Suddenly the fight didn't seem so im-
portant or so much fun and the whites were happy to break off the action.  Things hadn't been exactly quiet back at rendezvous as An-
drew Dripp's Indian wife, Mary, had given birth to her third child during the time of the fight.<br>
<br>
The accounts of all the eyewitnesses  indicated that the Blackfoot fortifications were located in an aspen and cottonwood grove surrounded by dense thickets.  A creek winding through an abandoned beaver dam watered this lush thorny tanglewood.  A grove surrounded by dense thickets of willow, chokecherry, serviceberry, and hawthorn bushes still exists about a mile and a half below Victor, Idaho.  This location is confirmed by the diaries of two eyewitnesses who returned to Pierre's Hole the next year.<br>
<br>
Warren Angus Ferris, clerk of the American Fur Company, travelled the customary route from Swan Valley to Jackson Hole on his spring bunt.  The following diary entry for May 25, 1833, describes his trip through Pierre's Hole:<br>
<br>
5/25/33.  We ascended a fork and crossed the mountains [Pine Creek Pass], where we arrived at the head of a stream [Little Pine Creek] flowing into Pierre's Hole which we followed down into the plain, four miles; there leaving it.  We passed over to the stream [Trail Creek] which marks the pass to Jackson Hole, about two miles and
halted, very much fatigued, about one mile above the battleground of last summer.16<br>
<br>
Plotting this description on the map shows that Ferris camped on Trail Creek near modern Victor, with the battleground located on Trail Creek about a mile below.  Ferris' description of his visit to the site of the battle the next morning goes as follows:<br>
<br>
On <B>tlie </B>succeeding morning in the company of a friend or two, I visited the battleground which was situated in a grove of aspen trees, several hundred yards in extent.  The pen or fort, probably about fifty feet square, was composed of green and dry aspen timber, and though hastily, yet cunningly constructed, it had sunk down <B>in</B> some places however from decay, below the height of two feet perpendicular.<br>
<br>
The besieged had excavated holes or cavities in the earth, within the pen, sufficiently capacious for two or three persons to remain in, quite below the surface of the ground.  These holes extended entirely around the pen; and we ascertained that the Indians had fired, in most cases, from small holes at the surface of the ground, beneath the pen or breast work which circumstances was not observed in and confusion of battle, or they would have halted in a few minutes.<br>
<br>
The attack was made on the north side, where at every tree, still seen piled up against the roots from besiegers fought, who had likewise raised brush and logs, a few paces from the pen nearly or quite the same height; and had the Indian allies not objected, in hope of capturing their arms, ammunition and other equipment, it would have soon be so greatly increased and advanced toward the pen, as to have insured its destruction, if fired, with all its contents and defenders.<br>
<br>
Parties were also stationed behind trees, and clusters of willows on the other side of the fort, which was thus entirely surrounded.  The trees both within and outside of the pen were covered with the marks of balls, or of the axes successfully employed by our comrades, to exhume and save them; lead being very valuable in these remote regions where it is so extremely necessary, both to the purpose of defense and subsistence.<br>
<br>
Bones, of both men and animals, lay scattered about in and around the pen, bearing evident indication of having contributed their fleshy covering to the sustenance of wolves and ravens, who undoubt-
edly gratified their gastronomical propensities, after a protracted fast, for some days subsequent to the conflict.<br>
<br>
Nathaniel Wyeth, by now a journeyman mountaineer, travelled from Camas Meadows, Idaho, to the rendezvous of 1833 on the Careen River.  After crossing Henry's Fork at Eagle Nest Ford (three miles west of St. Anthony), he marched to Pierre's Hole on July 9, 1833, and camped on the western side of the valley on Horseshoe Creek.  The following diary entries for July 10 and 11 describe his trip across
Pierre's Hole:<br>
<br>
10th.  Moved 12 miles S.E. crossing a difficult swamp and camped about 2 miles from the battle ground of last year with the Gros Ven-
tres.  Day warm and great quantity of grass hoppers for several days past so much as to discolor the ground in many places.<br>
11th.  Started early and made 3 miles E.S.E. to the foot of the mountains then 8 miles E.S.E. to the summit [Teton Pass] then 6 miles E. to Lewis [Snake] fork and 1 mile across it at the same place we crossed last year.<br>
<br>
Wyeth's camp on July 10 was eleven miles from the summit of Teton Pass, or near modern Victor.  The battle site was about two miles down Trail Creek, confirming the traditional location of the site.<br>
<br>
On August 29, 1835, Samuel Parker was shown the battleground while be was travelling through Pierre's Hole.  He learned that<br>
of the Blackfeet party there were about sixty men, and more than the same number of women and children; of the white men in the valley, there were some few hundred who could be called into action.  From the information given me, it appeared that these Indians were on their way through this valley, and unexpectedly met about forty hunters and trappers going out from rendezvous to the southwest on their fall and winter hunt.<br>
<br>
The Indians manifested an unwillingness to fight, and presented tokens of peace; but they were not reciprocated.  Those who came forward to stipulate terms of peace were fired upon and killed.  When the Indians saw their danger, they fled to the cottonwood trees and willows which were scattered along the stream of water, and, taking advantage of some fallen trees, constructed as good defenses as time and circumstances would permit.<br>
<br>
They were poorly provided with guns, and were still more destitute of ammunition.  The trappers keeping out of reach of their arrows, and being well-armed <B>with</B> the best rifles, made the contest unequal; and still more unequal, when, by an express sent to rendezvous, they were reinforced by veterans in mountain life.  the hunters, keeping at a safe distance, in the course of a lew hours killed several of the Indians, and almost all of their horses, which in their situation, could not be protected, while they themselves suffered but small loss.<br>
<br>
Those killed, on both sides, have been differently stated, but, considering the numbers engaged, and the length of time the skirmishing continued, it could not have been a bloody battle; and not much to the honor of civilized Americans.  The excuse made for forcing the Blackfeet into battle is, that if they had come upon a small party of trappers, they would have butchered them and seized upon the plunder.<br>
<br>
If heathen Blackfeet would have done so, civilized white men should not.  What a noble opportunity was here afforded for our
American citizens to have set an example of humanity.<br>
<br>
After his trip, Parker gathered some more information about the battle:<br>
<br>
Since my return, I have seen an account of this battle, written by a graphic hand, in all the fascinating style of romance, representing the Indians as having entrenched themselves in a swamp, so densely wooded as to be almost impenetrable; and there they kept the trappers at bay, until they were reinforced from rendezvous.<br>
<br>
When the Blackfeet saw the whole valley alive with horsemen rushing to the field of action, they withdrew into the dark tangled wood.  When the leaders of the several hunting parties came into the field, they urged their men to enter the swamp, but they bung back in awe of the dismal horrors of the place, regarding it impenetrable and full of danger.<br>
<br>
But the leaders would not be turned from their purpose-made their wills, appointed their executors-grasped their rifles, and urged their way through the woods.  A brisk fire was opened, and the Blackfeet were completely over-matched, but would not leave their fort, nor offer to surrender.  The numerous veteran mountaineers, well equipped, did not storm the breastwork, even when the Blackfeet had spent their powder and balls, but only kept up the bloody battle by occasional firing during the day.<br>
<br>
The Blackfeet in the night effected their retreat and the brave mountaineers assembled their forces in the morning, and entered the fort without opposition.<br>
<br>
When night approached, the hunters retired to their encampment at the place of rendezvous, and the Indians made their escape.  Thus the famous battle of Pierre's Hole began and ended.<br>
<br>
With those who have seen the field of battle, the glowing description, drawn out in long detail, loses its interest; for although I saw it, yet I did not see dense woods, nor a swamp of any magnitude anywhere near.<br>
<br>
Some local residents believe that the Gros Ventres might have entered Pierre's Hole by way of an alpine trail from Jackson Hole, north of Teton Pass, that terminated down the long sloping ridge south of Fox Creek. Indians preferred to travel the bare alpine ridges rather than use the creek bottom trails that were often choked with fallen timber and were preferred locations for Blackfoot ambushes.<br>
<br>
The alpine trails also were natural supermarkets to the hunting
and gathering Snakes, as the best root digging grounds were in these open meadows and bare hillsides.  Game was also most plentiful in the open areas rather than in the dense forests.<br>
<br>
If the Gros Ventres had used this trail, they would have had a perfect observation point from the bare ridges of Baldy Knoll where the entire valley can be seen; and they would have known that the broad valley was swarming with their enemies.  If they had been so imprudent as to enter the valley hoping to avoid a fight, the disastrous parley would have quickly disillusioned them.<br>
<br>
The Blackfeet were vocational fighters.  They fought when the odds were greatly in their favor and bad sense enough to avoid a fight when they were not.  Clearly, then, the Gros Ventres were unaware of the huge enemy host back at rendezvous.  As it would take a couple of hours for an express to gallop to rendezvous and bring reinforcements, the Gros Ventres had ample time to withdraw to the safety of the mountain forests.  The Gros Ventres could only count the enemies they could see, and so this day their hearts were bad.  They stayed and fought.<br>
<br>
The alternate battle site suggested by the residents who believe that the Gros Ventres used the alpine trail over Baldy Knoll is located three and a half miles south and half a mile west of Driggs, Idaho. This site is near the big swamps along Teton River about a quarter of a mile south of Darby Creek.  Excavations of undetermined origin have suggested this as an old cache or fort.  However, the Indians normally crossed the valley above the swamps where choke cherries and service berries grow.<br>
<br>
It is difficult to see why the Indians would deliberately head for the swamps, regardless of the trail they used to enter the valley.<br>
The Snake trail across the Teton Range is magnificent and needs no historical support to justify its use.  An ambitious biker following this trail in season is rewarding by the most dazzling<br>
wild flower display to be found anywhere.<br>
<br>
In early summer the lower meadows and hillsides are covered by massed patches of scarlet gilia, wild geranium, balsam root, blue lupine, larkspur, penstemoii, and sulfur eriogonum.  Late summer has its own vivid displays, with tall spikes of glowing pink fire weed and Indian paintbrush in colors shading from pale cream through yellow and pink to every shade of red.<br>
<br>
The trail recrosses the summit of the Teton Range three times, and in the high country are found clumps of tiny, tiny yellow alpine buttercups and red moss campion, all growing at the edge of receding snow banks.<br>
<br>
On the very summit of Baldy Knoll an old Snake fortification, a
ring about ten feet in diameter made of piled rocks, still remains.  At several spots on the trail, old Indian earth ovens can be found where Snake women roasted camas bulbs or yampa roots.  When spring warmed the hills, the Indians climbed the dry, grassy hillsides to their favorite root-gathering grounds.<br>
<br>
Here they could find the pink blossomed bitterroot or <B>tiny </B>white umbels of the Orogenia or Indian potato.  With curved digging sticks, the women poked in the muddy ground and through patches of melting snow, digging up corn like roots of the cous or biscuit root, which they boiled into a mealy mush or baked in small cakes for later use.  In mid-summer they gathered at the camas grounds on the prairies and dug the bulbs of this wild lily that resemble small <B>onions.<br>
<br>
</B>The bulbs were steamed, made into dough and baked, or pounded into a gruel. <B>In </B>fall, they dug the yampa roots, a wild carrot and one of the finest wild foods, in the sparkling meadows of the mountain foothills.  To flavor the roots and dried meat, the women gathered large basketful of choke cherries and hawthorns in the foothills and prairies and service berries and gritty huckleberries higher up <B>in </B>the underbrush.<br>
<br>
The <B>Hunters </B>could find elk bedded down in acres of false hellebore in the damp shady places, deer browsing on bitter brush on the hillsides, moose wading <B>iii </B>lush beaver ponds, bears moving up the mountain as the huckleberries progressively ripened, and mountain sheep high on the peaks of the Teton Range.<br>
<br>
The belligerent Blackfeet may have used this trail on occasion, but Bannock Indians from the Fort Hall Reservation were seen on it regularly until 1895, when they had a disastrous brush with irate settlers jealous over the dwindling elk herds.  A party of Bannocks led by a chief named Pohave, or Race Horse, travelled to Jackson Hole to hunt elk.<br>
<br>
The whites considered this intrusion a violation of Wyoming game laws, as the Indians were from Idaho and they ignored established hunting seasons.<br>
<br>
Several separate groups of Indians were arrested, tried, and heavily fined.  As they could not pay the fines, they were sent to jail.  However, frugal town officials did not care to feed the indigent Indians, so they were quietly allowed to escape.  Finding that the Indians had resumed bunting, the frustrated settlers resolved to take a different method of dealing with the problem.<br>
<br>
On July 13, 1895, Constable William Manning and twenty-six deputies surrounded a Bannock camp at daybreak and arrested nine men, thirteen women, and five children found in their tepees.  The Indians were roughly put in line of march toward Marysville (now Jackson), some fifty-five miles to the south.  After an all-day
march, the cavalcade passed through a dense grove of trees.<br>
<br>
The strange actions of the whites convinced the Indians that their captors intended a massacre.  As the women began a dirge, the men made a break for the woods.  A volley from the whites hit six of the fleeing braves.  One was killed and another left for dead, but the rest escaped.  In the panic of flight two of the children were jostled from the horses.  One was recovered by the whites and returned two years later, but the other was never found.<br>
<br>
The wounded brave was picked up seventeen days later and nursed back to health by a rancher.  The newspapers featured headlines warning of "Marauding Bannock," and the Army obligingly sent five companies of infantry to the area.  The troops camped at Camp Teton along Trail Creek and fished for a few days until the scare was over.<br>
<br>
Indians no longer used their alpine trail.  Once they walked in beauty, but then flowers grew <B>in </B>their moccasin tracks.<br>

THE BATTLE OF PIERRE'S HOLE.<br>
<br>
Don Berry, <B>A Majority of Scoundrels, an informal history of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company.</B> New York: Harper and Brothers, 1961.<br>
266-269.<br>
<br>
Rendezvous 1832 contributed more than its share to the mountain mythos.  What with the escape of Fitzpatrick, the share-the-spoils proposition of RMF, and a few other transactions, it was probably the most important rendezvous ever held.  It seems only fitting that it should have been climaxed by the most famous battle of the Rockies.<br>
<br>
Milton Sublette and Wyeth started out of the valley toward the south.  As they were getting ready to set out on the morning of July 18 they saw a dust cloud approaching; a large party.  Since Fontenelle's supply train was expected hourly, this occasioned no great concem, but the normal precautions were taken.  Before long Wyeth's spyglass had revealed that the approaching caravan was not white, after all, but a village of Indians; our old friends, in fact, the migrating Gros Ventres.<br>
<br>

When the Indians had come into plain view they stopped, and the parties mutually surveyed each other.  There were only about forty-two men in the combined Wyeth-Milton Sublette brigade; and an estimated two hundred Indians. (Inasmuch as this was a migrating village, including women, children, dogs and goods, the fighting force was nothing like this large.)<br>
<br>
For their part, the Gros Ventres seemed dubious.  Their bucks must have outnumbered the white party or they would have turned around immediately.  But it was not an overwhelming superiority or they would have attacked with equal speed.  Uncertain, they equivocated.<br>
A flag was raised in the front of the Indian band (some sources say a white flag; some say the Union Jack) and one of the principal chiefs stepped forward.<br>
<br>
In the white party was the half-breed Antoine Godin, whose father Thierry had been killed by the Blackfeet a couple of years before.  Taking with him a Flathead-whose tribe was constantly decimaled by the Blackfeet-Godin rode out to meet the Gros Ventre chief.<br>
The chief came forward with a pipe in his hands, and Godin and his Flathead companion met him about halfway between the opposing camps.  As the Indian raised the peace pipe, Godin grabbed his hand.<br>
<br>
The Flathead raised his cocked rifle and shot the Gros Ventre at point-blank range.  Godin snatched off the chief's red blanket as he fell, and the two wheeled their horses and made back to the white camp, Godin waving the red blanket jubilantly, finally avenged in his own mind for his father's murder.<br>
<br>
The Gros Ventres raised a howl, fired a few rounds, and scattered into a willow grove; part of a beaver swamp, where they began to build a fortification of deadfalls and limbs.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, Milton had sent an express back to the main en-
campment where the other trapping parties were still in rendezvous.  While the Gros Ventres worked on their fortification the greater portion of the combined companies, together with a large force of their Nez Perce and Flathead allies, was pounding along the plain like the cavalry in the last reel.<br>
<br>
The astonished Gros Ventres-who had no idea there was a rendezvous around-suddenly found the little valley swarming with armed horsemen.  They dug furiously at their fort, making trenches inside where they could be protected from the flre of the trappers.<br>
<br>
When all the whites had arrived, Bill Sublette (and/or Tom Fitzpatrick) took over the generalship of the campaign.  Sublette and Bob Campbell dictated oral wills to each other as they rode to the fight, and there were doubtless a goodly number of hastily got up wills of the same sort.<br>
<br>

It was obvious to Sublette that the Gros Ventres were in a good position.  The point of willows in which they were throwing up their breastworks provided ample protection from the white guns, if for no other reason than the lack of visibility.<br>
<br>
He proposed that an attack be made on foot, directly through the grove up to the fort, where they could see something to shoot at.  This notion met, so to speak, with a mixed response.  The Nez Perces and Flatheads, for the most part, considered any direct attack through the woods little short of suicide, and many of the whites agreed.  They wanted no part of any such thing.<br>
<br>
Sublette volunteered to lead the attack himself.  He got support from Bob Campbell and a few others; principally a free trapper named Sinclair andof all people-the greenhorn Nathaniel Wyeth.  Finally they recruited about thirty whites and the same number of Indians.  Sublette's own recruits did not engage in the battle, nor did Wyeth's men; by one account Sublette flatly forbade the greenhoms to take a hand.<br>
<br>
Wyeth himself, however, led one of the brigades into a circling motion, approaching the Gros Ventre fortification from the opposite side.  It is incredible that this quondam ice merchant, fresh from Boston, should take such a part in this fight; but lead he did, and acquitted himself well enough.<br>
<br>
Sublette and Bob Campbell and Sinclair led the frontal attack.  As they approached the log wall, Sinclair parted some bushes to peek through and was shot through the body.  A second later Bill Sublette himself was shot through the shoulder, and another man hit in the head.  The Indians' fire from the fort was deadly accurate, and their position strong.<br>
<br>
Wyeth's party had meantime arrived behind the fort, only to find themselves caught in both Indian fire and the overshots from Sublette's brigade.  One of Wyeth's Indians was killed in this way, and a Gros Ventre bag accounted for another man.<br>
<br>
The whites retreated, moving back to their camp to reconsider the situation.  They were astonished by the work the Gros Ventres had been able to do on their fortification, and gave up all idea of taking it by storm.<br>
<br>
The only thing remaining was to burn them out.  The Nez Perce and Flathead allies objected strongly to this notion.  While burning the fort would get rid of the Gros Ventres, it would also wipe out any plunder there might be, an unforgivable waste.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, the plan was carried over their objections, and the squaws were set to gathering wood.  While this was going on, the stubbom Gros Ventres were hurling taunts out of the fort.  A
conversation was carried on between the inhabitants of the fort and an interpreter; the gist was apparently that, while the whites might be able to burn out this small fortress, revenge would come soon.  There were six or eight hundred warriors not far from here, who would descend on the whites and wipe them out.<br>
<br>
In the process of translation, as is customary, something was lost.  In this case it was the meaninc,.  When all the interpreters had finished hashing out the threat through two or three Indian languages and English, it was relayed as saying that six <B>or </B>eight hundred warriors were already in Pierre's Hole, wiping up the trappers who had remained behind: the greenhorns, and those otherwise disinclined to fight.<br>
<br>
Promptly the white party got into an uproar and, leaving behind a small force to keep the Gros Ventres in their fort, stormed all the way back to the site of the rendezvous, to rescue that bunch.  They didn't need rescuing, except from each other perhaps, and that didn't count.<br>
<br>
By now it was near night, and there wasn't time to get back to the Gros Ventre position before dark.  In the morning, when they did return to finish up the job, there was nobody at home in the willow grove.<br>
<br>
The survivors had slipped out during the night and were scattering through the woods in retreat.  Disconsolate, the Nez Perces and Flatheads discovered that the retreating Gros Ventres had taken all their gear with them; no booty at all.  They found only one squaw, some distance from the fort, and immediately butchered her.<br>
(One story is that she sat beside the body of a fallen warrior and made no resistance.  Another, less romantic, that she had been shot through the leg.)<br>
<br>
The final casualty score on the white side was three wmtes killed (another died later) and four or five wounded, including Bill Sublette, who had had his wound dressed by Bob Campbell and was carried back to camp on a litter.  Eight or ten of their Nez Perce and Flathead allies had been wounded or killed.  The Gros Ventres later admitted to a loss of twenty-six men though when the trappers finally overran the little fortification they did not find that many.<br>
<br>
(The figures are, of course, those from the battle proper; there were other casualties directly attributable to the Battle of Pierre's Hole, but they did not occur until later.)<br>
<br>
So the battle of Pierre's Hole was over.  Everybody went back to the rendezvous site to discuss it, have a drink, and get organized for the Fall '32 hunt all over again.<br>

contest unequal; and still more unequal, when, by an express sent to rendezvous, they were reinforced by veterans in mountain life.  the hunters, keeping at a safe distance, in the course of a lew hours killed several of the Indians, and almost all of their horses, which in their situation, could not be protected, while they themselves suffered but small loss.<br>

The numerous veteran mountaineers, well equipped, did not storm the breastwork, even when the Blackfeet had spent their powder and balls, but only kept up the bloody battle by occasional firing during the day.<br>

<br>
The belligerent Blackfeet may have used this trail on occasion, but Bannock Indians from the Fort Hall Reservation were seen on it
regularly until 1895, when they had a disastrous brush with irate settlers jealous over the dwindling elk herds.  A party of Bannocks led by a chief named Pohave, or Race Horse, travelled to Jackson Hole to hunt elk.<br>
<br>
The whites considered this intrusion a violation of Wyoming game laws, as the Indians were from Idaho and they ignored established hunting seasons.<br>

Several separate groups of Indians were arrested, tried, and heavily fined.  As they could not pay the fines, they were sent to jail.

Finding that the Indians had resumed bunting, the frustrated settlers resolved to take a different method of dealing with the problem.<br>
<br>
On July 13, 1895, Constable William Manning and twenty-six deputies surrounded a Bannock camp at daybreak and arrested nine men, thirteen women, and five children found in their tepees.  The Indians were roughly put in line of march toward Marysville (now Jackson), some fifty-five miles to the south.  After an all-day march, the cavalcade passed through a dense grove of trees.<br>

DEATH OF LIEUTENANT SLAUGHTER<br>
<br>
William P. Bonney, "The Death of Lieutenant Slaughter," <B>History of Pierce County.</B> Volume I p. 189.<br>
<br>
Captain  E. D. Keyes arrived at Fort Steilacoom November 24 with Company M of the Third Artillery, consisting of about eighty-four men, further strengthening the 168 regulars of the Fourth Infantry under Maloney.  At this time Captain Hewitt, commanding a company of volunteers at Seattle, was ordered to the Green and White rivers to place himself in communication with Lieutenant Slaughter.<br>
<br>
Captain Hays took up a position on the Nisqually River, near Muck Prairie.  Captain Wallace's company was in the Puyallup Valley, keeping communications open to Steilacoom and the fort.  Lieutenant Harrison, of the <B>Jefferson Davis</B>, also took the field with Lieutenant Slaughter.<br>
<br>
Slaughter started for the White River on the twenty-fourth.  On the night of the twenty-fifth he was attacked on Bitting's Prairie by bands under Kitsap and Kanascut, of the Klikitats; Quiemuth and Klowowit of the Nisquallies; and Nelson of the Green River and Niscope Indians.  He lost forty horses during the fog and attack.<br>
<br>
On the twenty-sixth a member of Wallace's company, E. G. Price, was shot by a lurking Indian.  The same bullet wounded Addison Perham.  Twenty-five men of the Third Artillery, under Lieutenant McKeever, joined Slaughter on the twenty-sixth.  Slaughter divided his force, delegating Wallace and his men to make sorties from Morrison's place on the Stuck.  The weather was cold and rainy, and disagreeable for field work.<br>
<br>
On the third of December Slaughter took sixty of his men and five from Wallace's company and started to meet Captain Hewitt.  He camped on Brannan's Prairie, at the f orks of the Green and White rivers, taking possession of a log hut; and sent word f or Captain Hewitt, some two or three miles distant, to meet him there.  On the night of the fourth Indians crept up near the cabin, and as a conference was being held, opened fire, killing Slaughter, as described by Captain Keyes to Acting Governor Mason in the following letter:<br>
<br>
Head Quarters, Puget Sound District,<br>
Fort Steilacoom, W. T., Dec. 7,  1855  (6  p.  m.)<br>
Acting Governor C. H. Mason,<br>
Olympia, Washington Territory.<br>
<br>
Sir:<br>
<br>
I have just received information that on Tuesday night last,
while Lieutenant Slaughter was sitting in a small b.ouse at his camp, about two miles and a half above the forks of the White and Green rivers, conversing with Captain Hewitt and Lieut.  Harrison and Dr. Taylor, the Indians fired on them and killed Lieutenant Slaughter at the first discharge.  Two soldiers were also killed on the spot and five others wounded, of whom one is since dead.  Lieutenant Slaughter's body has arrived here.<br>
<br>
It is reported on all hands that it is impossible to operate against the Indians with any effect in the country on the White, Green and Puyallup rivers at this season of the year, and I know it to be so from personal observation.  To continue such a course will break down all our men and effect <B>iio </B>harm to the Indians.  Our pack animals are broken down, and we must establish our forces on our own ground in places where they will not suffer at night and where they can best protect the settlers.<br>
<br>
As you must be far better acquainted with such points, I would request that, if convenient, you will come and see me tomorrow.<br>
<br>
I send by the bearer a letter to Captain Hays, with directions for him to concentrate his command at Bradley's, to go to the relief of forty men now encamped on the other side of the -Puyallup, about three miles from the ford.  I do not know where Captain Hays is at this moment.  If you know please direct the bearer.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Slaughter is at Olympia.  Please keep the dreadful news of her husband's death a secret until Lieutenant Nugen can break it cautiously.<br>
<br>
I am, sir, very respectfully,<br>
Your most obedient servant,<br>
(Signed) E. D. Keyes,<br>
Capt. 3rd Art., Com.<br>
<br>
The death of Lieutenant Slaughter cast a gloom over the entire Sound.  The Legislature, then in session, passed resolutions of condolence, and adjourned out of respect for the beloved officer.<br>
<br>
LIFE OF SLAUGHTER<br>
<br>
William Alloway Slaughter was born in Kentucky in 1826.  He moved with his )arents into Indiana, and from there was appointed, to the Military Academy at West Point in 1844.  He graduated on June 30, 1848, and was made brevet second lieutenant July 1st, 1848, in the Second Infantry, and appointed first lieutenant in the
Fourth Infantry November 6, 1848.  This regiment was sent to the forts in Michigan, with U. S. Grant commanding.<br>
<br>
In May, 1851, Lieutenant Slaughter met and married Mary Wells, of Port Huron, the only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Wells.  In April, 1852, the whole regiment was ordered to the Pacific Coast.  They came by way of the Isthmus of Panama.  Mrs. Slaughter, a bride of less than a year, was the only woman to accompany the troops from the fort where her husband was stationed.<br>
<br>
The story of that voyage, with their hardships, as told by General Grant in his personal memoirs, is too long to repeat here.  However, there is one item found on Page 198, Vol.  I, that will bear repeating.  It reads:<br>
<br>
"One morning an amusing circumstance occurred while we were lying at anchor in Panama Bay.  In the regiment there was a Lieutenant Slaughter, who was very liable to sea-sickness.  It almost made him sick to see the wave of a tablecloth when the servants were spreading it.  Soon after his graduation, Slaughter was ordered to California and took passage by sailing vessel around Cape Horn.  The vessel was seven months making the voyage, and Slaughter was sick every moment of the time, never more so than while lying at anchor after reaching his place of destination.<br>
<br>
"On landing in California he found orders, which had come by the Isthmus, notifying him of a mistake in his assignment; he should have been ordered to the northern Lakes.  He started back by the Isthmus route and was sick all the way.  But when he arrived in the East he was again ordered to California, this time definitely, and at this date was making his third trip.  He was as sick as ever, and had been so for more than a month while at anchor in the Bay.<br>
<br>
"I remember him well, seated with his elbows on the table in front of him, his chin between his hands, and looking the picture of despair.  At last he broke out, 'I wish I had taken my father's advice -, he wanted me to go into the navy; if I had done so I would not have to go to sea so much.' "<br>
<br>
We read in Elwood Evans' writings a description of Lieutenant Slaughter's personal appearance.  It says: "He was stationed at Fort Vancouver a short time, and in 1853 was ordered to Fort Steilacoom.  As an officer he was brave to a fault.<br>
<br>
As an lndian campaigner, he was remarkably successful; no man had more endeared himself to his command, none @ad a more happy faculty of inspiring men with enthusiasm; small in frame and delicate in person, his powers of endurance were wonderful.  He had led almost all of the expeditions to check the Indians during the stay in the country, and had been actively in the field from the commencement of hostilities until he met his untimely death. 
Brilliant he was as and as a citizen he had rendered himself equally soldier,dear to the people of the Territory in which he had been assigned to duty.  In the walks of social life who that enjoyed his friendship can ever forget him?"<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Slaughter was a likable character- those who knew him best loved and respected him most.  His wife was a leader in this class.  She never regained her cheerful composure after her husband's death.  In 1856 she went back to her old home, accompanied by Territorial Secretary Charles Mason.  She died in 1861 and was buried in the family plot at Port Huron, Mich.  On one side of her tombstone is a tribute to her husband.  He was buried at Fort Steilacoom on the 9th of December, 1855, with appropriate Masonic and military honors.<br>
<br>
When Captain Keyes heard of Slaughter's death he remarked:          "My heart is sick when I reflect that so brave an officer and so gallant a gentleman should be slain by the wretched savages."<br>
<br>
William P. Bonney, "The death of Lieutenant Slaughter," <B>History of Pierce County,</B> Volume I, p. 189.<br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
In late October, in several raids and ambushes, Indians killed three families along the White River, two envoys to Chief Leschi, and two members of a messenger party from Captain Maloney who was in the field.  Fearful of a general uprising, many settlers left their farms and fled to Fort Steilacoom.<br>
<br>
Lt. Slaughter and Company C, 4th Infantry, moved to the Puyallup River and Connell's Prairie to intercept Indian tribes and prevent their joining together.  On November 3, after a patrol located a group of Nisqually Indians preparing an ambush along the Green River, Lt.  Slaughter attacked the Indians, claiming thirty killed.  He was unable to cross the river and cut them off; nevertheless, the action was one of the first successful ones in the campaign, with but one soldier killed.<br>
<br>
Toward the end of the month, on November 24, Lt.  Slaughter began a reconnaissance in force from Camp Montgomery, a supply base near the Puyallup River, toward the White River.  Not making contact by the end of the day, he made camp, with the uneasy premonition that the wet, rainy weather would bring fog and increased chances of an Indian raid.  He was correct.  His position was fired on during the night, and despite doubled sentries some forty horses were stolen.<br>
<br>
      
The next day, Lt.  Slaughter's command was augmented by a detachment of twenty-five men from Company M, 3rd Artillery, which had arrived as reinforcements from San Francisco.  The next several days were spent in search operations to locate hostile Indian tribes, but without success.  On December 3, Lt.  Slaughter was joined by Captain Hays and a detachment of Washington militia, with instructions to rendevous with another small force of volunteers led by Captain Hewitt at the junction of the White and Green Rivers, the present day site of Auburn.<br>
<br>
After joining forces, Lt.  Slaughter set up a joint camp.  That evening, the position was fired upon by Indians, and Lt.  Slaughter was killed by a musket shot as he was conducting a planning meeting with the other commanders.  Two other men were casualties and five were wounded.<br>
<br>
The death of Lt.  Slaughter was widely mourned.  The Legislature passed a resolution of condolence and adjourned for the day as a mark of respect.  Newspapers published laudatory articles.  He was buried at Fort Steilacoom with full military and Masonic honors in a ceremony attended by Acting Governor Mason, Lafayette Balch, and other prominent citizens.  As a final note of respect, when Mrs. Slaughter later returned to the east coast, she was accompanied by Acting Governor Mason.<br>
<br>
At the time of his death, Lt.  Slaughter was honored for giving his life in the service of his country and the Washington Territory.  After the Civil War, when the Army disbanded Fort Steilacoom, Lt.  Slaughter's remains were reinterred in 1892 in the military cemetery at the Presidio of San Francisco.  Never-
theless, his death still stands as a symbol of all the soldiers who gave their lives during the creation and growth of the Washington Territory.<br>

WILLIAM A. SLAUGHTE<br>
<br>
Ezra Meeker, "The Death of Lieutenant Slaughter," <B>Pioneer Reminiscences of Puget Sound.</B> Seattle: Lowman and Hanford, 1903.<br>
<br>
On the 24th of November, Lieut.  Slaughter with fifty regulars and two companies of volunteers Captain Rays and Wallace's commands, moved to Puyallup, camping on the same ground where the Eaton Rangers had been previously besieged.  At nightfall of the 25th, the camp was surrounded by Indians, the night made hideous
by their yells, and some shots fired into camp without harm.<br>
<br>
The Indians succeeded in running off a number of the horses of the command.  The next day one man was wounded, and the camp kept under arms at night by occasional shots, after which the Indians drew off and were seen no more at that camp.<br>
<br>
The whole attack, on the part of the Indians consisted more in yells than of bullets, and became ludicrous after the affair was ended.<br>
A curious incident occurred during this affray.  The horse ridden by Dr. Burns on the 31st of October, through the swamp when Miles and Moore were killed, came into camp with saddle, saddle bags, sword and everything just as he was when Burns abandoned him nearly a month before.<br>
<br>
The superstition of the Indians had doubtless deterred them from touching the outfit, and saved the horse to be again "shot down from. under him," as previously reported by the eccentric doctor.<br>
<br>
The Indian, Kanasket, was mortally wounded during the evening and brought into camp defiant to the last, exciting the admiration amd pity of his foes.   He knew his time had come but that he was willing to die; that if he had the power to do so he would renew the<br>
fight and never make peace as long as there wag breath of life in him.<br>
<br>
He was one of the most fearless of his tribe.  His loss was keenly felt and doubtless caused the early withdrawal of their forces from the field, as he was one of their leaders.<br>
<br>
Slaughter's command moved down the Puyallup a few miles to near the mouth of Stuck.   Here, forty of the volunteers under Lieutenant Moore of Wallace's company, were left in camp while Slaughter, on December 4th, pushed on over to White River, and camped near the ground of the recent massacre, two miles below the mouth of Green River.<br>
<br>
While consulting in an open cabin at night fall with Captain Hewitt, who had moved his company from Seattle to a point near by, the Indians made a sudden rush, killed Lieutenant Slaughter and Corporals Berry and Clarendon of the volunteer force, and wounded four privates of the regulars, one of whom soon died.<br>
<br>
Citptain Keyes hastily summoned Captain Hays company to extricate the forty men camped on the Puyallup, and again the country was evacuated, Slaughter's contingent going out down White River to Seattle, while the Puyallup command returned to Steilacoom by the same route they had gone in on.<br>
<br>
The utter futility of attempting to prosecute a winter campaign
became so apparent that no further move was made for over two months.<br>
<br>
With reference to the movement of the troops, Governor Mason, in his message, delivered to the legislature December 7th, 1855,<br>
said:<br>
<br>
"The disposition which has been subsequently made of the troops in the field in this portion of the Territory, has been with the design-while at the same time to keep the hostile Indians in check, adequate force should be moving on the outskirts of the settlements-that the farmers might be enabled to return to their claims to provide for the coming year's subsistence."<br>
<br>
This was a very different policy from that adopted by Governor Stevens a few months later, when he actually used a part of the volunteer force to drive settlers off their claims instead of protecting them.<br>
<br>
Governor Mason continued this humane policy until Stevens' return to Olympia, Jan. 19th, 1856.<br>
<br>
Mason in his message paid a handsome tribute to Gov.  Douglass.  He said:<br>
<br>
"I deem it my duty here, to make public acknowledgement of the services rendered by his Excellency,  James Douglass Governor of Vancouver's Island.  Upon the alarm naturally attendant upon a serious Indian outbreak, almost within arms length of us, and owing to the scarcity of fire arms and ammunition, application was made to him for such an amount of these munitions of war as he could possibl furnish.<br>
<br>
"That application was promptly and cordially respondod to, to the extent of his power; he at the same time regretting that he had at the moment no vessel of war at his disposal, and that his steamers, the Otter and Beaver, were both absent, but upon the arrival of either, she should be dispatched to the Sound, to render such service as might be required of her.  Since then the Otter has visited this place."<br>
<br>
Let us recall the famous saying that "blood is thicker than water."<br>
<br>
Pursuing this subject a little further, the following letter from R. S. Robinson, who was Quartermaster and Commissary of the Northern Battalion, with headquarters at Port Townsend, will be interesting reading:<br>
<br>
"Our volunteers in the field were short of supplies.  Governor Stevens requested me to go to Victoria, and, if possible, get
what supplies were needed of the Hudson Bay Company.<br>
<br>
"I went over to Victoria and presented my letter to the company.  Governor Douglass was friendly from the first.  The company would furnish the supplies if Governor Stevens would draw direct on the Treasurer to pay for the goods:' I told them the Governor could not draw on the United States Treasurer for there was no appropriation to meet the emergency.<br>
<br>
"Governor Douglass said: 'You shall not go back without some supplies.' He then wrote an order on the H. B. Co. to let me have $5,000 worth on his account.  I presented this to the company.  They saw the Governor was not afraid, and asked me for a statement of everything I wished from them, and I received the supplies to the full extent required."<br>
<br>
Governor Stevens neglected to mention this generous act in his message to the next legislature.  In looking over the old papers amd books of unts at Fort Nisqually, I found that at that post $27,304 worth of goods were supplied to the volunteer forces aud from the private correspondence it becomes manifest the manage-
ment both at Nisqually and Victoria were very loth to give up the good for scrip, and did it only as a sense of duty.<br>
<br>
Governor Douglass wrote:<br>
<br>
I must cordially acknowledge the moral obligation which binds Christian and civilized nations to exert their utmost power and influence in checking the inroads of the merciless savage, and it is a cause of sincere regret, on my part, that our means of rendering you assistance comes infinitely short of our wishes."<br>
<br>
This letter was in response to the first request for help, but later the amount ran so large they doubted the wisdom, as a business venture, of letting so large a sum go, rightly saying that the emergency had passed and that the American Government could provide for the troops.<br>
<br>
November 14th, 1856, Dr. Tolmie wrote the <B>Board of</B> Management of the Hudson Bay Company, Western Department Victoria:<br>
<br>
I am happy to inform you that commissioners residing in Oregon have been appointed to investigate the scrip liability incurred during the Indian <B>troubles.  </B>Governor Stevens has taken a new position in <B>framing </B>his excuses for the Indian war, and has publicly <B>declared </B>that <B>arch</B> enemy, the Hudson Bay Company, is the only <B>cause </B>why the Indians would not observe the treaties made with them."<br>
<br>
Of course the management were very much puzzled to account <B>for
</B>such action on the part <B>of </B>Governor Stevens, not realizing the influences that were leading <B>his</B> mind astray, and that he <B>so </B>often <B>was </B>not responsible for his words.<br>
<br>
Another incident worthy of record:<br>
<br>
"Some time after Lieut.  Slaughter <B>was killed the settlers</B> on the Sound were alarmed, not knowing <B>when </B>their <B>time</B> would come, being mostly housed up in block houses.  It Was then the Puget Mill Company <B>offered </B>to <B>furnish a</B> vessel, arm it and supply it with men and provisions, and present it to the Governor for protection of the Sound.<br>
<br>
I represented the facts to Quartermaster General Miller at Olympia.  He consulted with Gov.  Stevens.  They represented to me that they felt under deep obligation to the Puget Mill Company for their generous offer, but did not consider the situation sufficiently alarming to warrant <B>ac</B>ceptance of the offer.<br>
<br>
"The above incident was never published.  It seems to me  it was of sufficient importance to be preserved.  The Puget  Mill Co. certainly deserves credit for so generous an offer.  Capt.  Keller was superintendent at the time."<br>

They represented to me that they felt under deep obligation to the Puget Mill Company for their generous offer, but did not consider the situation sufficiently alarming to warrant <B>ac</B>ceptance of the offer.<br>
<br>
"The above incident was never published.  It seems to me  it was of sufficient importance to be preserved.  The Puget  Mill Co. certainly deserves credit for so generous an offer.  Capt.  Keller was superintendent at the time."<br>

PORT GAMBLE INCIDENT<br>
<br>
David Richardson,"The old ship's log reveals the story behind the Port Gamble incident," <B>Seattle Times.</B> April 2, 1967.<br>
<br>
According to a once standard movie plot, all Indians were villains whose unprovoked attacks on  honest settlers were repulsed at the crucial moment by the heroism of the United States Cavalry or its equivalent.<br>
<br>
More recently the Indians have been pictured as basically good guys forced into become bad guys through the treachery of the designing white man.<br>
<br>
But the truth is usually a mixture of both views, as illustrated by the Port Gamble incident of 1856. The following version of this often told tale is based on reports filed by the naval commander involved, including the log of the steamship <B>Massachusetts</B>. The papers are storage in the National Archives in Washington D.C.<br>
<br>
Marauding bands of Northern Indian tribes from British Columbia were causing havoc in Puget sound at the time. Traveling swiftly in hug war canoes they were armed with Hudson Bay Company muskets and had contempt for any law but force. When one of these war parties showed up at Henderson Bay near Steilacoom and began to terrorize a logging camp, word quickly was sent to the nearby Army headquarters.<br>
<br>
The message was signed L. Balch and complained that the <B>Traveller</B> a steamship engaged in towing logs out of the bay, was "...so annoyed by them that the captain deemed it prudent to leave the raft and flee for safety..."<br>
<br>
Lieut. Colonel Silas Casey commanding at Fort Steilacoom promptly sent troops to drive the marauders away, sternly ordering them to leave Puget Sound waters altogether.  The Indians removed themselves beyond the range of the fort's guns, but no farther.<br>
<br>
The next day Casey observing that the Army had no vessels with which to enforce its orders called on the Navy for assistance. Writing to Commander Samuel Swartwout, skipper of the <B>Massachusetts</B> Casey requested that Swartwout "...take the matter in hand, and take such steps as you may think best calculated, to advance the interest of all concerned.."<br>
<br>
Swartwout made for Steilacoom early on November 19, only to find the Indians had departed during the night after committing more
depredations at Swan's Logging Camp and waging a bloody battle with the local Indians.  The <B>Massachusetts</B> steamed north in pursuit, arriving in the evening at Port Madison where the same Indians had been up to more mayhem.<br>
<br>
As it was too late to purse them much farther, Swartwout anchored in Appletree Cove for the night, resuming the chase at 8:40 o'clock the next morning.<br>
<br>
From passing vessels it was learned the war party appeared heading for Port Gamble. The <B>Massachusetts</B> proceeded to the pioneer mill town and dropped anchor there at 12:45.<br>
<br>
Within the hour Commander Swartwout dispatched two small boats ashore containing eighteen armed men and an interpreter. The Indians were found to have joined forces with more Northerners and now numbered 117 in all besides quite a few women and children, encamped along the beach.  The shore party, commanded by Lieut. I. Young, were under orders to "...have a friendly talk..." with the Indians and "...endeavor to prevail on them to leave the Sound peaceably..."<br>
<br>
Swartwout wanted to tow them in their own canoes across the Strait as far as Victoria, with two or three of their chiefs traveling on board his vessel as hostages.<br>
<br>
But as the shore party neared the beach, a large force of Indians rushed down to meet them, brandishing rifles and threatening to shoot anyone who landed. Lieutenant Young tried communicating Swartwout's proposition to them from the launch, receiving jeers and threats in replay.<br>
<br>
Faced with the menacing situation Young hurriedly order the boats back to the <B>Massachusetts</B>.<br>
<br>
Swartwout sent to town for a local man, a Dr. Bigelow, to act as emissary. Bigelow approaching the Indians camp under a flag of truce while three boats carrying 45 armed men and a howitzer ranged themselves off shore.<br>
<br>
Bigelow conveyed Swartwout's proposition to the Indians who replied that they would not leave until they were good and ready.<br>
The Indians then started hurling more threats and insults at Lieutenant Young and his men. Young expected them to attack at any moment and withdrew for the second time.<br>
<br>
By now it was beginning to get dark and a heavy rain storm threatened. Concluding that more direction action would be necessary, Swartwout had the ship moved closer to shore and prepared to attack in the morning. To prevent the Indians slipping away during the night, he stationed the launch and the <B>Traveller</B> which had arrived with a tow of logs for the mill, just above their encampment. Field pieces were placed on board both vessels.<br>

At day light an interpreter again went ashore under a flag of truce to repeat Swartwout's demands. While this parley was going on a party of 29 men came ashore in heavy seas, wading through chilly waist-high water and carrying in their arms one of the howitzers. Young, having injured himself in a fall the previous evening was out of action, a Lieutenant Seemes, therefore advanced to where the interpreter was speaking with several chiefs and gave them on last opportunity to surrender. This was refused.<br>
<br>
While Seemes was rejoining the shore party the Indians quickly took up positions at the edge of the woods. Four men stood by the gun on board of the <B>Traveller</B>. Swartwout had the <B>Massachusetts</B> on the alert with its powerful port battery bearing on the camp.<br>
<br>
The <B>Traveller</B> opened fire simultaneously with the Indians. At this the <B>Massachusetts</B> began bombarding the camp with both round and grape shot, while the shore party charged under cover, driving the Indians into the dense woods, with the Indians firing their small arms and reloading as they went.<br>
<br>
An Indian chief fell, wounded in the thigh, both legs broken. Two women ran out to aid him, and the marines called to them to surrender. One did and was taken prisoner; the other refused and was cut down with no less than six bullets.<br>
<br>
The shore party began destroying the Indians canoes, huts and other property including three hundred new blankets. Swartwout estimated the damage at "several thousands of dollars." The shore party returned to the <B>Traveller</B> about 10:00 o'clock.<br>
<br>
For the rest of the day the <B>Massachusetts</B> bombarded the woods, firing a salvo at anything seen moving in the timber, pausing only to bring the ship even closer to shore. Another shore land was made to smash one last canoe which had been only partly damaged earlier in the day.<br>
<br>
The <B>Massachusetts</B> continued its merciless bombardment until sunset, when Swartout sent the woman who had been taken prisoner ashore with a demand for surrender; the Indians replied that they would fight to the last man.<br>
<br>
But that night the Indians counted up their dead and wounded and hunted for their missing while shivering unprotected in a cold November rain. At daybreak they had enough. Two of their chiefs visited the ship and surrendered, a white flag was hoisted on the <B>Massachusetts</B> and all hostilities ceased.<br>
<br>
The Indians had 27 men killed, including one of their principal chiefs. They had 21 wounded, had lost all their belongings, and were without food or shelter of any kind. Swartwout's men came through the fracas with one killed, one injured, in the thumb, and three instances of being struck by bullets which glanced off such objects as pistols and knife handles.<br>

Swartwout issued the Indians bread and molasses and gave them twenty-four hours to bury their dead. During the night of November 24-25 he loaded the survivors aboard the <B>Massachusetts</B>, steamed across to Victoria and when the British governor there refused to take them off his hands, proceeded on up the coast to Lasqueti Island where he put them ashore.<br>
<br>
Although the Indians promised never to return to the Puget Sound country they did, the following August and avenged their dead by beheading a Whidbey Island settler, Isaac N. Ebey, in another episode that has been told many times.<br>

<br>
HONOR MEMORY OF EARLY PUGET SOUND HERO<br>
<br>
(Chloe Sutton, "Honor memory of early Puget Sound hero, Navy marks grave of Indian victim," <B>Tacoma Sunday Ledger-News Tribune.</B> July 17, 1949.).<br>
<br>
A newly place headstone over a long forgotten grave in the old Port Gamble cemetery was unveiled last Memorial day at the Fleet reserve of the Bremerton Navy Yard.<br>
<br>
It was a belated ceremony for the stone marks the grave of the first Navy man killed in action on the Pacific Coast. The grave is that of coxswain Gustave Englebrecht, killed at Port Gamble November 21, 1856, while a landing party from the <B>USS Massachusetts</B> was fighting Indians.<br>
<br>
From the log of the old <B>USS Massachusetts</B> we learn that on November 21, 1856"...Gustave Englebrecht was shot in the right temple by an iron slug and died shortly after. On November 22, 1856, at 1:20 p.m. funeral procession with remains left the ship to be interred at Port Gamble, Washington. Half mast the colors and at 2:00 p.m. procession returned."<br>
<br>
First Navy Fatality<br>
<br>
Forgotten by Puget Sounders the Navy department for the past 93 years kept this brief records of the death and burial of the first United States navy man killed in action on the Pacific Coast.<br>
<br>
Through efforts of the Kitsap County Historical association, the attention of Admiral H.H.Good and Admiral Bledsoe of the 13th Naval District, was called to Coxswain Englebrecht's records. These
ranking officers and their assistants lost no time in requisitioning and setting in place the headstone over this neglected hero's grave.<br>
<br>
The "Battle of Port Gamble" in which Coxswain Englebrecht lost his life, ended on Puget Sound the Indian war of 1855-58 and the terrible fear of a large scale northern Indian invasion of the Sound.<br>
<br>
While settlers were engaged in repelling an Indian invasion from east of the mountains, (Yakimas, Klickitats, etc.) the northern Indians seized the opportunity to harass both natives and whites around Puget sound. Native Puget Sound Indians were for the most part loyal to the whites, fearing to lose them as allies against their hereditary foes, the northern Indians.<br>
<br>
The fearful rumor that one thousand northern Indians wee ready to join the eastern Indians persisted through the summer of 1856. A present-day review of the war tends to show that the northerners were more interested in helping themselves that they were in helping the Klickitats or Yakimas, but the pioneers suffered from fear of the possibility almost as much is if it were a reality. And these "Vikings of the Red Race" were worth of fear.<br>
<br>
Feared by Local Indians<br>
<br>
Natives of Queen Charlotte and Alexander archipelago they were, being island dwellers, past masters in construction and navigation of canoes. Some were large enough to hold one hundred persons, with all equipment. The average canoe held form 25 to 30 persons and could make from 30 to 35 miles an hour when properly manned.<br>
<br>
In their swift, sturdy, sea worthy craft these superior warriors, they were armed with firearms long before the Puget Sound natives, swept down from even north of Sitka, killed, pillage, looted and carried off slaves from the peace loving Salish tribes around the Sound.<br>
<br>
This they had indulged in from time immemorial, nor changed their methods because of the white advent.<br>
<br>
On November 18, 1856 the <B>USS Massachusetts</B> Commander Samuel Swartwout, was patrolling the lower Sound, in an effort to check the Vikings when his vessel was overhauled by a courier Indian canoe. Major Goldsborough came aboard to deliver a dispatch from Lieutenant Colonel Silas Casey to Commander Swarthout urging him to come at once to Fort Steilacoom.<br>
<br>
With the dispatch came a letter from Captain Lafayette Balch, store keeper in the town of Steilacoom recounting activities of seven canoe loads of northern Indians then in the upper Sound. At Sherwoods Mill (Allyn) they had ransacked and burned a house; at Swan's logging camp, on Henderson bay, they had pillaged and
harassed the loggers; at the iNdian reservation a fight with the natives had ended with the death of two northerners and the destruction of one of their canoes. They were now too close to Steilacoom for comfort.<br>
<br>
It being dark, Commander Swarthout waited until the next morning then went with all speed to the scene of the marauding. But before his arrival the northern Indians were off down the Sound. They stopped at Port Madison and behaved as usual. According to one pioneer, "They never come without doing some deviltry before they go."<br>
<br>
Indians Overtaken<br>
<br>
Being informed of their departure Commander Swarthout bypassed Port Madison and overtook the bank at Malakoff on the Port Gamble bay. Malakoff, the site of which is now lost, was a regular stopping place for the northerners up and down the sound. It was at the base of a heavily timbered steep hill, on which underbrush and fallen timber was so thick that attack from that quarter was impossible.<br>
<br>
The Indians had unloaded their loot and drawn the canoes up before the huts. Then they confidently settled down to rest and to wait for better weather before starting homeward.<br>
<br>
Upon his arrival Command Swarthout employed Dr. Bigelow of Port Gamble as interpreter and sent an armed delegation ashore to talk with the Indians. They were told that if they would consent to being towed to Victoria and promise never to return again, the commander would forgive all their misdeeds.  Two or three of their chief men were invited aboard the <B>Massachusetts</B> for a friendly visit.<br>
<br>
Armed Indians came down to the beach as the delegation landed, shook their fists in the sailors faces, dared them to come ashore and fight; and could scarcely be restrained from snatching the guns from the hands of the marines. They sent the commander word that they would neither come aboard the <B>Massachusetts</B>  nor leave until they were ready, and under no condition would they leave under the tow of the <B>Massachusetts.</B><br>
<br>
Prepare for Attack<br>
<br>
Later a second and larger delegation was sent from the <B>Massachusetts</B>. These men tired to impress the Indians with the might of the gunboat and how useless their resistance to it would be. The Indians refused to listen but were even more insulting than to the first messengers.<br>
<br>
During the night Commander Swartwout made preparations for an attack if the Indians did not surrender the following morning. All the Navy men believed the Indians would capitulate when they saw the big guns trained on them. They did not know the northern Indians.
The morning of November 21, 1856, one more delegation went ashore to try to persuade the Indians to give up. but to no avail. While the parley was in progress the Indians returned to the huts, danced a war dance around them.<br>
<br>
Then seizing their weapons, jumped behind logs or trees and trained their guns on the white emissaries. Seeing his men thus exposed to danger, Commander Swartwout opened fire on the Indians just as the Indians fired on the white and the Battle of Port Gamble was on.<br>
<br>
The Indians retreated to the hill. The whites followed to the huts with a howitzer and there under protection of the <B>Massachusetts</B> big guns hauled the loot from the shacks and burned it and the shacks then chopped up the Indians canoes. Among the loot were three hundred new blankets and some $2,000 worth of other materials.<br>
<br>
The <B>Massachusetts</B> big guns boomed startling citizens of Port Townsend and Port Ludlow. Grape shot rained down among the hidden foe, doing terrible havoc. Many Indians were killed with splinters from the big trees.<br>
<br>
Englebrecht Killed<br>
<br>
While firing from behind a log, Coxswain Englebrecht could not resist the temptation to raise his head and peer over at a brave he had just despatched. Englebrecht fell back with a slug through his right temple. He was the only white to lose his life in the battle.<br>
<br>
Late in the evening of November 21 the Indians sent Swartwout word they would never surrender but would fight to the last man.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Fendall of the <B>Massachusetts</B> made this comment later," They are certainly the most recklessly daring men I have ever seen, appearing to place less value on their lives than I supposed any human could do."<br>
<br>
Commander Swartwout in his report of the battle remarks: "Their fighting was worthy of a better cause."<br>
<br>
On the morning of November 22 the Indians sued for peace "...and begged for mercy in the most humble terms, " being weary and hungry. They had been without food for some forty-eight hours.<br>
<br>
The next morning 87 Indians, 45 able bodied men, the rest women and children boarded the <B>Massachusetts</B>. They begged to be allowed to procure canoes and leave the Sound, but Swartwout would not permit them. At l0 a.m. with the Indians aboard the <B>Massachusetts</B> got under way for Esquimalt.<br>
<br>
Never again did northern Indians defy the United States Navy! During the month of November also the Yakimas, Klickitats and other eastern Indians were driven back east of the mountains. With the fear of the northern Invasion definitely over, Puget Sounders settled down to lumbering, shipping and rebuilding their desolated
homes.<br>

PORT GAMBLE<br>
<br>
Pat Baillargeon, "Port Gamble," <B>Pacific Search.</B> (November, 1976) p. 26.<br>
<br>
By the 19th century, early-day sailing explorations had been replaced by schooners of commerce plying America's Pacific Coast.  Cargo-laden decks carried that "other   gold"-Iumber-from    the Northwest's densely forested hillsides.<br>
<br>
These abundant woodlands prompted A. J.  Pope, William Talbot, and Cyrus Walker to establish their sawmill at Port Gamble, Washington, in 1853.  "Timber, timber 'till you can't sleep," exclaimed Captain Talbot as he sailed the 50-ton schooner Julius Pringle through Puget Sound in July of that year.  They settled on the deep-water site Indians called Teekalet or "brightness of the noonday sun," also designated "Port Gamble" by Lt.  Charles Wilkes' 1841 mapping expedition.<br>
<br>
The town has not slept since.  Built because San Francisco's '49 gold-rush boom necessitated a lumber source closer than their native Maine, Pope and Talbot's is the oldest continuously-operated mill in the United States.<br>
<br>
The forest industry's history, for good or ill, is the story of our Northwest.  What land was cleared, which products produced, what tall ships arrived from around the world, and who were the men who came to harvest the green gold-all are part of our cultural heritage.<br>
<br>
At Port Gamble, Pope and Talbot produced an architectural gem.  A company town of best New England tradition on a hillside overlooking harbor and mill, it has been designated a National Historic Site.  Classic houses for company officials copied the architecture of the founders' hometown, East Machias, Maine.  So did the Congregational church, the general store, Masonic Temple, community hall, and later the Hotel Puget with its elegant furnishings brought around Cape Horn.  Elm trees carried as seedlings from Maine lined the streets.<br>
<br>
The town is still a company town.  At the general store you can
still buy anything from popcorn to work shirts, even on Sunday.  Thompson House (1859) is the oldest continuously-occupied residence  in Washington State.  Since the mid-1960s Pope and Talbot has been committed to a policy of preservation and restoration, with Ronna Pope and resident manager Charles Peck as the original master planners.<br>
<br>
During these years, the old cemetery has been cleared of brush and more than 30 homes restored; all power lines have gone underground; 700 new trees have been planted; St. Paul's church has a new steeple of authentic size and a blue-gray exterior matching its first paint job; replicas of East Machias street lamps have been installed; and original paint colors are seen throughout the town.<br>
<br>

At Port Gamble, though, the line between maintenance <B>and</B> restoration is a thin one; continuous use of buildings has meant the chance to preserve an entire town's way of life.<br>
<br>
To better display the unique history of company and town, Pope and Talbot in June opened a museum in the basement of the general store-the same building which upstairs houses Tom Rice's Of Sea and Shore Museum .  A walk through Pope and Talbot's superb little 
museum is alone worth the trip <B>to </B>Port Gamble-a firsthand look at 125 years of lumbering history.<br>
<br>
There are photomurals, lively exhibits complete with sounds such as a creaking ship's hull, entire rooms from houses and the hotel, 
locally-used Indian baskets, and a display on the forest of <B>the</B> future.  The final room is devoted to company archives from many sources, now consolidated behind a locked door.<br>
<br>
Just outside the museum the mill hums on, and a short way up the 
road a <B>new</B> nursery prepares seedlings for planting future forests.  Port Gamble is a time capsule of our very own history.<br>

Richard Sawyer, "Port Gamble's lover of shore life," <B>Pacific Search.</B> (May, 1976) p. 9.<br>
<br>
The young bridge-tender in the control tower puts down his binoculars.  He tums to the lighted control panel, nips several
switches, turns a key, and moves a lever.  The massive center span of the Hood Canal Bridge opens ponderously for a freighter.<br>
<br>
The tour director steps from a plane at Fiji's Nandi airport.  His small group of shell collectors will spend the next few days gathering, preserving, and identifying exotic shells from one of the richest collecting areas of the world.<br>
<br>
The editor sits at a desk mounded with papers and books.  His quarterly magazine, Of Sea and Shore, is going to press.<br>
The museum director captivates a group of junior high school students who have come to see the thousands of shells and other marine specimens on display in his Of Sea and Shore Museum.<br>
<br>
A blizzard of white three-by-five cards confronts the research scholar.  There are more than 100,000 known shells in the world - he would like to publish books which illustrate them all.  The first, with 5000 illustrations, is now in the final planning stages.  He is also indexing afl known modem . illustrations and photographs of shells.<br>
<br>
All of these men are Tom Rice.<br>
<br>
At 36, he has achieved many youthful dreams.  Rice's international reputation among scholars, malacologists (students of mollusks) and shell collectors was made in the small town of Port Gamble on the Olympic Peninsula.  Because of his unique museum and its research resources, the malacological world has beaten a path to his door.<br>
<br>
"When I was small," he recalls, "I used to walk for miles along the beach with my grandmother.  I collected seashells by the bucketful.  But unlike many youngsters, I didn't become bored with the shells and discard them - I arranged them in geometric designs and glued them in the bottoms of cardboard boxes.  Those boxes of shells were my first display specimens."<br>
<br>
After Rice finished high school, he went on to Olympic College a@d the University of Washington to major in biology.  He gives much credit to inspirational teachers like Dr. Lynwood Smith and Dr. Dixy Lee Ray.<br>
<br>
He continued collecting and cataloging shells; developed a world-wide coffespondence and shell exchange with collectors; helped form the Pacific Northwest Shell Club; and founded the club's newsletter.  Thus, Of Sea and Shore was launched now a four-color quarterly journal reaching subscribers in 80 countries.<br>
<br>
Tom Rice's Of Sea and Shore Museum of Shells and Marine Life,
located on the second and third floors of the Port Gamble general store, displays nearly 20,000 marine specimens.  Free to the public, it has attracted more than 50,000 visitors in its less than two years of operation-<br>
<br>
Pope and Talbot, Inc., founder of this once-booming old sawmill town, owns most of the townsite and the buildings, including the general store which houses the museum.  The company provides space for the museum and helps support its operation.  On a rocky Kitsap Peninsula promontory, commanding views of the entrance to Hood Canal and the Olympic Mountains, Port Gamble is now a National Historical Site and a drowsy village of about 130.  Rice was bom and raised and attended school here.<br>
<br>
Rice tells how he started world tours for shell collectors.  "There are only a few hundred varieties of shells in northwest waters and I had all these.  So after collecting along the west coast with friends, I found myself organizing a collecting trip to Mexico, then setting up trips for shell collectors farther away.<br>
"We've now gone to Fin, Costa Rica, the Mauritius and Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean, Austmlia's Great Barrier Reef.  Collecting tours to British Honduras in Centml America, Senepl in Africa, and Madagascar, Ceylon and Maldive Island in the Indian Ocean are all planned."<br>
<br>
Besides being bridge tender, magazine editor, tour guide, and museum director, Rice has written several books.  His authoritative Marine Shells of the Pacific Coast, What is a Shell, and A Check-
list of Marine Gastropods from the I Puget Sound Region are used by high schools and junior colleges from Alaska to California. Tom Rice loves the beauty of the seashore.  And he likes people.  Through sharing his knowledge, he has uncovered the<br>
artistry of shells to many.<br>
<br>
"The brilliance and beauty of shells are really a mystery," Rice observes.  "The creatures that produce these beautifully colored shells, as well as most of their natural enemies, are color-blind.  Some beautifully shelled creatures hide afl day and only move around at night.  My strongest purpose with the museum and the magazine is to show people the fragile beauty on the seashore.  Then perhaps they will care what happens to their seashores and want to preserve them.<br>
<br>
"I particularly enjoy grade school children at the museum.  They have unlimited curiosity, which will soon be lost through our compartmentalized education.  But the very young leam about things like shells and creatures of the shore - simply because they are interested."<br>

Tom Rice is a happy man who has found his niche.  And he is delighted to share his knowledge and his treasures with all comers.<br>

PORT GAMBLE BATTLE.<br>
<br>
Clinton Snowden, "The Battle of Port Gamble," <B>History of Washington: The rise and progress of an American State.</B> New York: Century Publishing Company, 1909;. Volume III p. 504-510.<br>
<br>
Wanton murders of Indians by white men had occurred before in the territory, as they have on the border everywhere, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and one of these was the cause of much anxiety to both the governor and the people for a long time.  It is believed to have been the remote cause of the murder of Colonel Ebe , on Whidby Island, and of the attack on the settlers of Bellingham Bay, in which David Melville and George Brown were killed and beheaded, and their heads carried away by their murderers.<br>
<br>
The warlike character of the Haidahs, who inhabited the shores of Queen Charlotte Sound, has heretofore been mentioned.  They continued to visit the Sound in considerable numbers, long after the settlers came.  Though they came in their great war-canoes, they did not always come to make war.  Some of them at times sought employment, and when they obtained it worked faithfully.  A few of them were employed as scouts during the war and did good<br>
service.<br>
<br>
In the spring of 1854 some of these Indians were employed by John L. Butler on his claim at Butler's Cove, about three miles north of Olympia.  When they had completed the work they had engaged to do, they asked for payment, and a dispute arose, in which one of the Indians was killed by Butler and a man named Burt, who lived with him.<br>
<br>
The companions of the murdered Indian made complaint at Olympia, and Butler and Burt were arrested, but they were never tried or pu@ished.  The magistrate before whom they were arraigned discharged them, "because Thurston County had no jail, and it would be an expense to the county to retain them in custody."<br>
<br>
There were many white people in the territory at the time who denounced this proceeding, and the crime which led to it, but this did not improve matters, so far as these Indians were concerned.  They saw that the white man's law did not punish the red-handed murderers of their fellow, and naturally resorted to their own.  As
many of the settlers knew, this placed their own l' ives in jeopar dy, for the Indian held the murderer, his kindred and his kind all responsible, though not in an equal degree.  It was expected that reprisal would be made and it was.<br>
<br>
Late in May ten large war-canoes, each carrying from 50 to 75 warriors, arrived at Vancouver Island, where eight of the party killed a man named Bagley, whom they supposed to be an American, though he was not.  On hearing of this outrage Govemor Douglass dispatched oflicers to pursue and capture the murderers, but they concealed themselves among the San Juan Islands and escaped.<br>
<br>
On Saturday, May 24th, two of these large canoes appeared in Bellingham Bay, and landed their hostile occupants on the shore near the bouse of Mr. Clayton, who went out to meet them entirely unarmed.  They pretended to be friendly, and offered to sell some blankets, but their conduct aroused his suspicions, and on pretence of going to his house to get money, he fled to the woods.<br>
<br>
He was pursued for a considerable distance, but reached the house of Captain Pattle, five miles away, in safety.  Some Lummi Indians living near by were sent to wam the other settlers in the neighbor-
hood, and Pattle and Clayton, with five other white men, all unarmed except for an old musket with a broken lock, which Pattle had, secured a canoe and Put off from shore, hoping<br>
thus to be able to observe the movements of the Indians on both land and water, and make their escape if necessary.<br>
<br>
They remained on the water until near midnight, when they went ashore, thinking there were no hostiles in the neighborhood.  But in this they were mistaken.  An ambush had been prepared near the point where they landed.  Two of the party, Melville and Brown, were left in the boat as a guard, and soon after the others had gone ashore, all were fired upon by the Indians.  Those on shore fled to the timber and escaped, but Melville and Brown were killed and beheaded.<br>
<br>
Having completed their bloody work the Indians sacked Clayton's cabin, and two days later fired into that of Alonzo M.  Poe. They then visited Whidbey Island, where they robbed several houses, after which they fled northward to their own country.<br>
<br>
The settlers were at that time without means for giving pursuit, but when news of this marauding exploit reached Olympia, acting-Governor Mason went to Fort Steilacoom to make such arrangements as could be made there with the military, for the protection of the settlements, and then paid a visit to the lower Sound.<br>
<br>
There it was not possible to do much.  The settlements were absolutely without means of defense, except so far as they could
protect themselves, and must remain so until the government could send an armed vessel for their protection.  On Mason's return to Olympia a militia company, with Colonel Ebey as captain, was enrolled, and arrangements were made to send it to any part of the Sound, upon call, by such means as could be secured at the time.<br>
<br>
When the war clouds began to gather in the following year, all the settlers along the Sound realized that they were more than ever liable to attack from these warriors from the north.  The danger from this direction was a constant source of anxiety to Mason, and later to Stevens.  Other murders of Indians by white men, and of white men by Indians, had occurred in the lower Sound country, at Crescent and Holmes harbors, Swinomish flats, and in the nei bor-
hood of Seattle, and it was realized that these, or some of them, might at any time be made the pretense for new outrages.<br>
<br>
Efforts were accordingly mad . e to procure the presence in the Sound of a warship, or other government vessel, that would help in a measure at least to protect the settlers and their families, and it was these efforts that led to the coming of the Decatur, the Active, and finally the more efficient steamer Massachusetts.<br>
<br>
The latter vessel, commanded by Captain Swartwout, arrived soon after the attack on Seattle, and replaced the Decatur.  The John Hancock, also a steam-vessel, which had until recently been exploring in Bering Sea, but which since her return had been refitted at the Mare Island navy yard, joined the Massachusetts, and both ships, during the summer and fall, made cruises through the lower Sound, keeping the Indians advised of their presence.  Most of these had a wholesome regard for "piah ships" (fire ships) as they called them, and their mere presence was sufficient to keep them from committing any disturbance.<br>
<br>
But the warlike Haidahs were not terrorized by them.  They came and went, in large parties or small, as they had been accustomed to do, but without committing any mischief until November, when a party of them landed near Steilacoom and became so troublesome that Captain Balch applied to Colonel Casey to have theni removed from the Sound.  Casey ordered them to leave, but they were very impudent, and would not go, and he invited Captain Swartwout to take them in hand.  The same or another party had been they had be<br>
making trouble in Henderson's Bay, where they became<br>
involved in a pitched battle with some of the Sound Indians, and two of their number had been killed.<br>
<br>
By the time Swartwout arrived at Fort Steilacoom, they had all departed for the lower Sound, whither he followed them and, on the 20th, found a large party of them encamped near Port Gamble.<br>
<br>
Here he brought his ship to anchor, and sent Lieutenant Young to have a talk with them, and induce them to leave the country if
possible.  He was to offer to tow their boats to Vancouver Island if they would go; if not successful, he was to invite two or three of their chiefs to come on board and have a talk with the captain.<br>
<br>
But the Indians would have no conference with him.  They met Lieutenant Young's boat at the shore, in large numbers, and with their arms in their hands threatened to attack him if he attempted to land, and he was forced to retum to the ship.  A second and larger party, consisting of 45 men, was then sent with a howitzer, to repeat the offer, but the Indians were even more defiant than before, declaring that they would not go until they liked, and in no case would they permit the ship to tow their boats.<br>
<br>
During the night the ship was moved as close as possible to the Indian camp, and moored so as to present her broadside toward it.  A smaller steamer, the Traveller, and the launch of the Massachusetts, both having cannon on board, were also anchored in favorable positions for overawing the savages, and soon after daylight Lieutenant Semmes was sent to renew the demands made the day previous.  After a long parley, in which the Indians still showed a very defiant and hostile spirit, he landed with twenty soldiers and marines, taking the howitzer of the launch with him.<br>
<br>
The Indians then seized their arms and ran to the woods, where they took positions behind trees and logs and prepared for batde- A shot from one of the guns on the Traveller was now fired and the Indians answered with a volley.  The battle soon became general.  A broadside from the ship sent shell and grapeshot into the woods and thickets where they seemed to be thickest, doing great execution.<br>
<br>
Semmes and his men, being protected now by the fire from the ships, charged the camp and des troyed it, together with all the property it contained.  The canoes, which had been drawn up on shore, were also destroyed save one, and that was disabled later in the day, to prevent the Indians from escaping.  The battle continued during the whole day, the Indians firing from their hiding places whenever any of the sailors or marines showed themselves Within range of their guns.<br>
<br>
During the afternoon a squaw, who had been taken prisoner, was sent to them, to say that if they would surrender they would be sent across the straits, providing they would promise never to r turn; but they returned the defiant reply that "they would fight as long as there was a man of them alive.  "<br>
<br>
They held out stubbornly for two days, when hunger compelled them to yield. When the fight began they had 117 warriors present, besides their women and children.  During the fight 27 were killed and 21 wounded, one of the latter being a chief.  Being without
canoes, or other means of leaving the country, they were now taken on board the Massachusetts and conveyed to Vancouver Island, where they were landed and furnished with provisions enough to supply them until they could again provide for themselves.<br>
<br>
The loss, on the part of the Massachusetts, in the engagement was one man killed and one wounded.<br>
<br>
The Haidahs left the country promising never to return to it, but they had hardly been set on 'shore in British Columbia before they began to threaten that they would have a "Boston tyee"* fo r every warrior they had lost.  Knowing their implacable nature, the settlers realized that they would attempt to make this threat good, and they were for a long time thereafter the cause of much anxiety among the settlers, particularly during the war years.<br>
<br>
But it was impossible to make absolute defense against their attacks, and so no defense was made.  On the 12th of August following, a party of northern Indians numbering about 200, as was supposed, called at Whidby Island and visited the home of Colonel Ebey, where they were kindly received.<br>
<br>
During the night they returned, called the colonel to the door, where they shot him, cut off his head and carried it away.  George W. Corliss and his wife were in the house at the time, and together with Mrs. Ebey and her three children made their escape, the Indians firing a volley after them as they fled to the woods.<br>
<br>
These  Indians   made   no   hostile   demonstration  against any of the other settlers in the vicinity, but soon disappeared,carrying Ebey's head with them.  It was afterwards recovered by agents of the Hudson's Bay Company, who found it at the home of the Indians<br>
in British Columbia.  It is not positively known that the murder of Ebey was a direct consequence of the murder of the northern Indian by Butler and Burt, on Budd's Inlet three years earlier, but many believed it was.<br>

Theodore N. Haller, in an article on "Life and Public Services of Colonel Granville 0. Haller," in The Washington Historian, April, 1900, says of this incident, occurring in the fall of 1856:<br>
<br>
"Governor Isaac 1. Stevens of Washington territory had resolved upon the expulsion of all foreign Indians, and called upon the United States navy to order them out of the country.  The United States steamer Massachusetts proceeded to execute the order, when at Port Gamble some Hydah Indians from Russian America, employed by the Port Gamble Mill Company, located at Tackalet, were ordered to return to their native country, but they refused point blank, and defied the navy.<br>
<br>
The result was the landing of sailors, which obliged the Indians to seek shelter in the woods, where a lively cannonade from the steamer, while the sailors were destroying their camp, caused the death of the chief.  They surrendered at length and were removed, only to return next season, 1857, when they retaliated for the loss of their chief by attacking Colonel Isaac N. Ebey's house at night, on Whidbey Island, killing the colonel (the most prominent settler in that section, having been collector of customs, colonel of volunteers during the Indian war, etc.) and cutting off his head carried it to their country."<br>
<br>
The mutilated head of Colonel Ebey was taken from the Indians [some time later] by the captain of the Hudson's Bay Company steamer, Beaver, and returned to the family.<br>

<br>
On the 24th of February, 1856, the United States steamer Massachusetts arrived in the Sound, commander Samuel Swartwout assuming the direction of naval matters, and releasing the Active from defensive service at Seattle, where for three weeks her crew under Johnson had assisted in guarding the barricades.  About a month later another United States steamer, the John Hancock, David 
McDougall <B>comm</B>ander, entered the Sound, making, the third man-of-war in these waters during the spring of 1856.<br>

The Decatur remained until June.  In the meantime Patkanin  had stipulated with the territorial authorities to aid them in the prosecution of the war against the hostile tribes.<br>
<br>

For every chief killed, whose head he could show in proof he was to be paid eighty dollars, and for every warrior, twenty.  The heads were delivered on board the Decatur, whence they were forwarded to Olympia, where a record was kept."<br>
<br>

<B>In </B>April a large body of Stikines repaired to the waters of the gulf of Georgia, within easy distance of the American settlements, 
and made their sorties with their canoes <B>in </B>any direction at will.<br>
<br>
On the 8th the John Hancock, being at Port Townsend, expelled sixty 
<B>from </B>that place, who became thereby much offended, making threats which alarmed the inhabitants, and which were the occasion of a public meeting on the following day to request the governor and Commander Swartwout to send a war-steamer to cruise between Bellingham Bay and the other settlements on the lower Sound and Fuca Sea.<br>
<br>
During the whole Summer a feeling of insecurity and alarm<br>

prevailed, only alleviated by the cruising of the <B>men-of </B>war.  That they still infested these waters at midsummer is shown by the account of Phelps of the departure of the Decatur, from the Sound in June, which he says was escorted by our Indian friends, representatives from the Tongas, Hydah, Stickene, and Shinesbean tribes," until abreast of Victoria.<br>
<br>
They were glad to see the vessel depart.<br>
<br>

In October a small party of Stikines attacked a <B>small </B>schooner belonging to one Valentine, killing one of his crew in an attempt to board the vessel, and severely wounding another.  They were 
pursued by the Massachusetts, but escaped.  At the <B>same </B>time other predatory detachments of a large party landed at different points, robbing the houses temporarily vacated by the owners, and not long afterward visited the Indian reservation near Steilacoom and carried off the potatoes raised by the reserve Indians.<br>
<br>
At the second visit of the robbers to the reservation, the Nisquallies killed three of the invaders, in consequence of which 
much <B>alarm </B>existed.<br>
<br>

Swartwout then determined to drive them from the Sound, <B>and 
</B>overtaking them at Port Gamble on the 20th, found them encamped 
there <B>in </B>force.  Wishing to avoid attacking them without sufficient apparent provocation, he sent a detachment under Lieutenant Young,
in a boat to request them to leave the Sound offering to tow their canoes to Victoria, and inviting few of the principal chiefs to visit the ship.<br>
<br>
To these proposals they returned insolent answers, gesticulating angrily at the officers and men, challenging them to come ashore and fight them which Young was forbidden to do.<br>
<br>
A second and larger expedition was fitted out to make another attempt to prevail upon the Indians to depart, by a display of strength united with mildness and reason, but with no better effect,, the deputation being treated with increased contempt.<br>
<br>
The whole of the first day was spent in useless conciliation, when, 
finding his peaceable overtures of <B>no </B>avail, Swartwout drew the Massachusetts as close as possible to their encampment, and directly abreast, and stationed the Traveller, a small passenger steamer running on the Sound-at this time commanded for this occasion by Master's mate Cummings, with the launch of the Massa-
chusetts commanded by Lieutenant Forrest, both having field-pieces on board, above the Indian encampment, where their guns would have a raking fire upon it.<br>
<br>
Early in the following morning Lieutenant Semmes was ordered to take a flag of truce and reiterate his demand of the day before, pointing out to the Indians the  preparations made to attack them, and the folly of further resistance.  The were still determined to<br>
defy the power which they underrated because it appeared suppliant, and preparations were made for charging them and using the howitzer, which was carried on shore by the men in the launch wading waist-deep in water.<br>
<br>
Even after the landing of the men and gun they refused to consider any propositions looking to their departure, but retired to the cover of logs and trees with their arms, singing their war songs as they went.<br>
<br>
When there could no longer be any doubt of their warlike purpose, an order was given to fire the Travellers field-pieces, which were discharged at the same instant that a volley blazed out of the muzzles of sixty guns in the hands of the Indians.  The ship's battery was then directed against them, and under cover of the guns, the marines and sailors on shore, led by Forrest and Semmes, charged the.<br>
<br>
Indian encampment situated at the base of a high and steep hill surrounded by a dense undergrowth and by a living and dead forest almost impenetrable.  The huts and property of the Indians were destroyed, although a desperate resistance was made, as futile as it was determined.<br>
<br>
After three hours the detachment returned on board ship, firing
being kept up all day whenever an Indian was seen.  During the afternoon a captive woman of the Stikines was sent on shore to offer them pardon, on condition that they would surrender and go to Victoria on the Massachusetts, their canoes being destroyed; but they answered that they would fight as long as one of them was left alive.<br>
<br>
However, on the morning of the 22d the chiefs made humble overtures of surrender, saying that out of 117 fighting men 27 bad been killed and 21 wounded, the rest losing all their property and being out of provisions.  They were then received on board the Massachusetts, fed, and carried to Victoria, whence their passage home was assured.<br>
<br>
Swartwout in his report to the navy department expressed the conviction that after this severe chastisement the northern Indians would not again visit the Sound.  In this belief he was mistaken.<br>
<br>
On the night of the 11th of August, 1857, they landed on Whidbey Island, went to the house of I. N. Ebey, shot him cut off his head, robbed the premises, and escaped before the alarm could be given.  This was done it was said, in revenge for the losses inflicted by the Massachusetts, they selecting Ebey because of his rank and value to the community."<br>

MILITIA IN THE ROGUE RIVER WAR OF 1851<br>
<br>
Virgil Field, "Militia in the Rogue River War," <B>History of the Washington National Guard.</B> Volume I Chapter VI.<br>
<br>
The road to California, traveled continually to the gold rush, became more and more unsafe through all the region roamed over by the Shasta, Rogue River tribes and their allies.  Notwithstanding the treaty entered into between Governor Joseph Lane of Oregon Territory and the Chief of the Rogue River Indians the previous year, great caution was necessary in selecting and guarding camping places and crossing streams.<br>
<br>
If a party wishing to cross a river constructed a ferry boat and left it tied up for a party in the rear, the latter on arriving found it gone.  While making another, guard had to be maintained, in spite of which their horses and pack animals were likely to be stampeded.  When a part of their outfit was ferried over, guard had to be maintained on both sides of the stream, which divided their forces and increased their peril.<br>
<br>
These annoyances and occasional conflicts led to irritation on the part of the miners, who, as they grew stronger, were less careful of their conduct towards the Indians, who were only too ready to find provocation in their contempt of the white man.<br>
<br>
Finally, in May of 1851, contempt was turned into desire for vengeance by the treacherous murder of David Dilley, one of a party of three white men, and two professedly friendly Rogue River Indians.  While encamped for the night the Indians stealthily arose, seized Dilley's gun, and shot him dead, as he slept.<br>
<br>
The other two white men, who were unarmed, escaped back to a party in the rear, and the news was sent to Shasta, where a company of Volunteers was formed, headed by a Captain Long, who crossed the Siskiyous, killed two Indians, one a sub-chief, and took several prisoners as hostages for the delivery of the murderers.<br>
<br>
Demanding the surrender of the murderers was well enough, but the demand being accompanied or preceded by revenge, gave the head chief a plausible ground for refusing to give up the guilty parties.  Further, he threatened to destroy Long's Company of Volunteers, which remained at the crossing of the Rogue River, awaiting turn of events.<br>
<br>
He was not molested, but at a ferry south of this one several skirmishes occurred.  One party of twenty-six men was attacked 1 June 1851 and one Indian was killed in the encounter.  On the day following, at the same place, three different parties were set upon and robbed, one of which lost four men in the skirmish.<br>
<br>
On 3 June, Dr. James McBride and thirty-one men, returning from the gold mines, were attacked in a camp south of the Rogue River. 
There were but seventeen guns in the party, while the Indians were two hundred strong, and had in addition to bows and arrows about as many firearms.  They were led by a Chief known as "Chucklehead", the battle commencing at day break and lasting for four hours and a half until "Chucklehead" was killed, when the Indians withdrew.<br>
<br>
No loss of life or serious wounds were sustained by the white men, but about sixteen hundred dollar's property and gold dust were carried off by the Indians.<br>
<br>
This series of incidents resulted in the dispatch of Major Philip Kearney and two companies of the 1st U. S. Dragoons.  These troops, augmented by Volunteers of General Lane, engaged in a skirmish with the Indians on 17 June near the Rogue River.  On the 2nd, another engagement took place at Table Rock.  An all-out attack was planned for 25th, but upon arrival at the Indian Camp they found all the Indians had disappeared.<br>
<br>
Taking up their trail, Kearney's regulars managed to bring back some 30 Indian prisoners to Camp Stuart, which had been named in honor of Captain James Stuart, who was mortally wounded in the engagement of 17 June and died the following day.  The prisoners were turned over to General Lane of the Volunteers for delivery to Governor Gaines at Oregon City.<br>
<br>
By means of these prisoners, Governor Gaines induced eleven of the head men and about 100 followers to consent to a treaty by which the Indians agreed to submit to the jurisdiction and accept the protection of the United States and to restore the property stolen from white people.  Upon agreement, the captive families were returned.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, about 1 June 1851, Captain William Tichenor arrived at Port Orford with his ship, the "SeaGull," and left nine men with supplies, intending to bring reinforcements to settle there on his next trip.  Upon his departure, the Indians assembled at Port Orford to drive out the nine men.  The white men held the ground through several engagements, but because they were so far outnumbered, they managed to escape up the coast and finally reached the mouth of the Umpqua River, famished, suffering and exhausted.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, Captain Tichenor returned with some 40 settlers to find the men gone.  Assuming they were dead, he left the settlers there and returned for more.  By August, the strength of citizens had been increased to about seventy, well armed, and capable of repulsing Indian assaults.<br>
<br>
In September of 1851, a group of settlers set out to explore the Rogue River country, avoiding the Indians, until they were finally ambushed by the Indians near the mouth of the Coquille River.  Five were killed and three escaped.  In the meantime, a detachment of troops from Astoria was dispatched to aid the citizens in the Port
Orford area.<br>
<br>
However, this handful of troops rendered little service to the settlers.  They did make an attempt to apprehend the Indians responsible for the Coquille massacre.  Attempts to treat with these Indians also ended in failure.<br>
<br>
As a result of the Coquille massacre, General Ethan Allen Hitchcock, Commanding General of the Pacific Department, ordered a larger military force to Port Orford.  This force consisted of Company C, 1st Dragoons, mounted, and Companies A and E, dismounted.  These troops under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Silas Casey arrived during the period 22-27 October 1851.<br>
<br>
Casey, a graduate of West Point in 1822, was breveted a Major for gallantry in action at the battles of Contreras and Churubusko and Lieutenant Colonel for gallant and meritorious conduct in the battle of Chapultepec, Mexico in 1847.  He was later to play an important part in the Indian Wars of Washington and in the Civil War.  In the latter he was breveted a Brigadier General for gallantry in action and to Major General for meritorious conduct at the battle of Fair Oaks, Virginia.<br>
<br>
On the 1st of November, Colonel Casey commenced his march to the Coquille and arrived in the vicinity on the 3rd, guided by a survivor of the massacre.  On the 5th the Indians gathered for an all-out fight in an attempt to drive the troops from the country. He pursued them for several days without success.  Finally on the 21st of November, by use of boats, his troops surprised the Indians and succeeded in killing some fifteen or twenty in a short battle.<br>
<br>
This seemed to have a demoralizing effect on the Indians and no more attempts were made to attack the troops.  The troops returned to Port Orford from where they were ordered back to California, departing in early December.  Estimated cost of this expedition was $25,000.  The Rogue River Indians remained fairly peaceful for the next few years, but in 1855-56, started their depredations again, necessitating the return of elements of the 1st Dragoons and 4th Infantry to punish them.  Many Oregon Volunteer Militiamen also assisted.<br>

ROGUE RIVER WAR<br>
<br>
Robert M. Utley, "The Rogue River War," Frontiersmen in Blue, the
United States Army and the Indian. 1848-1865. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967. p. 175-187.<br>
<br>
"I am a commanding general without troops!" lamented the Pacific Division's General Hitchcock late in 1851; "my adjutant general in arrest, no aide de camp, and this evening's mail brings from  the  U.S.  Quartermaster  General Jesup, complaining of the officers of his department in this division and saying that he may be obliged to refuse payment of their drafts and cease to send further funds here!"'<br>
<br>
The general's frustrated outburst partly explains why the Regular Army figured unimportantly for nearly five years in the confrontation between Indians and whites brought on by the California gold rush.  It simply lacked the resources.<br>
<br>
General Persifor Smith, Hitchcock's predecessor, had begun his assignment determined to mete out quick retribution to such Indians as resisted U.S. authority.  In September i849, near Goose Lake in northeastern California, Pit River Indians ambushed an army exploring expedition and killed Captain William H.  Warner of the Topographical Engineers.<br>
<br>
At the same time, Indians in the neighborhood of Clear Lake, some fifty miles north of San Francisco, grew restive and throughout the winter murdered an occasional prospector.  In the spring and summer of 1850, Smith sent a force of dragoons and infantry against both offending groups.  Contentious, tyrannical Captain Nathaniel Lyon led the expedition first to Clear Lake, where some four hundred Indians had taken refuge on an island.<br>
<br>
Crossing by boat, Lyon drove them into tule-studded swamps and shot down between sixty and one hundred.  He then marched over the divide to Russian River and proceeded downstream some twenty miles, where another four hundred or so natives had also fortified on an island.  Surrounding them, the troops closed in and made the position "a perfect slaughter pen." Lyon placed the dead at not less than 75 and perhaps as high as 150.<br>
<br>
A second expedition in July penetrated the Pit River country and clashed with the slayers of Captain Warner, though less decisively than at Clear Lake and Russian River."<br>
<br>
Lyon's two campaigns, like Phil Kearny's almost accidental collision with the Rogue River Indians and Silas Casey's brief offensive against the Coquilles formed no part of a coherent approach to the mission assigned the Pacific Division.  Lack of troops, an escalating desertion rate, prohibitive logistical costs, War Department economy strictures, and a deepening disgust at unprovoked or indiscriminate white aggression combined to prevent Smith and Hitchcock from exerting a meaningful influence on the Indian situation.  
Meanwhile, transitory volunteer  and  militia  companies  rampaged  over  much of the Sierra and expeditiously solved the Indian problem for all time.  Only in the mountains of northern California and southern Oregon did the natives defy extermination long enough for the Regulars to become involved.  The troop buildup of i853-54, though nominal, at last permitted the Army to advance into this troubled country and try to keep the Indians and whites from slaughtering one another.'<br>
<br>
Since <B>1850, </B>when miners first began to overrun these mountains, relations between Indians and whites had steadily worsened.  Shastas, Rogues, Umpquas, Klamaths, and related groups reacted predictably to the invasion with petty thievery and an occasional murder.  Citizens fought back, rarely discriminating between guilty and innocent.<br>
<br>
Mutual suspicion and hatred, intensified by the language barrier, led periodically to open warfare, as in i851 when Major Kearny helped local forces suppress a Rogue River uprising.  Again in August 1853 violence flared, this time as transient Shastas from California committed depredations near Jacksonville, Oregon, provoking the citizens to retaliate against the innocent Rogues.<br>
<br>
This resulted in a combination of bands that seriously threatened Jacksonville and prompted a hurried call for help to Fort Jones, across the state line in Scott's Valley.<br>
<br>
Captain Bradford R. Alden could muster but ten men of his company of the 4th Infantry, but with them and such arms and ammunition as his magazine yielded he marched northward.  At Yreka he enrolled a volunteer company and at Jacksonville three more.  Joseph Lane, newly elected territorial delegate to Congress, placed himself at the head of the force and, with Alden as second in command, went after the hostiles high in the Cascades.  A sharp fight with two hundred warriors on August 24, 1853, led to a truce and ultimately, on September 8-10, to a treaty conference at Table Rock.<br>
<br>
Here Governor Joseph Lane and Superintendent of Indian Affairs Joel Palmer negotiated the Table Rock Treaty, which bound the Rogues and their allies to cede all their territory and settle temporarily on a hundred-mile-square reservation until a permanent home could be selected.  Promptly ratified in Washington, this treaty formally accomplished what had been intended by its predecessor in 185i.  Two weeks after the Table Rock negotiations, Captain Andrew Jackson Smith established Fort Lane near Jacksonville, and in the neighborhood of Table Rock the Indian Bureau marked out a reservation for the Indians party to the treaty.<br>
<br>
The Table Rock Treaty brought the Rogue River War of 1853 to a
close, but it solved few problems.  During the ensuing year Superintendent Palmer concluded similar treaties dispossessing Umpquas, Shastas, and Calapooyas.  To provide them a haven until a permanent reservation could be found, he engaged the Table Rock signatories to another treaty opening their reservation to these refugees.<br>
<br>
None of the bands liked this arrangement, but no serious trouble erupted between them because few Indians paid any attention to the reservation boundaries.  Instead they located wherever inclination suggested.  The whites tended to view any Indian off the reservation as up to no good and a fair target for execution.  The Indians in turn frequently lived up to this reputation.'<br>
<br>
In this situation the Army steered a tortuous course.  At Fort Lane Captain Smith and his company of the ist Dragoons and at Fort Jones Captain Henry M. Judah and his "Forty Thieves" of the 4th Infantry alternated between protecting innocent Indians from slaughter by angry settlers and joining with improvised volunteer units to run down Indians accused of robbery or murder.  That the Regulars aided the Indians at all infuriated the settlers, and relations between the Army and the civilians it had 15eeii sent to protect ileteriorated dangerously.<br>
<br>
Further irritating the situation was the attitude of the new commanding general on the Pacific.  Brevet Major General John E. Wool, senior of the Army's two full brigadiers, took command from Hitchcock early in 1854.  A stiff-necked professional of forty-two years' service, the diminutive general possessed a contentious temperament that overshadowed a piety somewhat unusual in the Regular Army.<br>
<br>
He reposed great confidence in his own judgment and tended to regard anyone who differed with him as a scoundrel controlled by impure motives.  In this category he placed the citizens of the Northwest and their political officials, who insisted on appropriating all the Indian's land and killing him if he objected.<br>
<br>
In the larger sense, of course, Wool was right, but in the context of the times his inability to understand the other point of view as well cost him needed civilian support and deepened the bitterness already engendered by field commanders who now and then sided with the Indians.  Intemperate public utterances insured wide circulation of the general's views.<br>
<br>
In  the  remote  northeastern  corner  of  General   Wool's   department, Indian relations suddenly grew dangerous.  This "Inland Empire" east of the Cascades supported much more numerous and warlike groups than those in the Rogue and Klamath country.<br>
<br>
For many years they enjoyed cordial relations with Hudson's Bay
Company traders and, less uniformly, with the missionaries that began arriving in the 1830s; but the campaign of the Oregon Volunteers in 1848, aimed at the Cayuse murderers of the Whitmans yet falling heavily on innocent groups as well, left a legacy of bitterness and distrust.<br>
<br>
Late in May 1855 part of these people were summoned to a great treaty council in the Walla Walla Valley, near the site of the martyred Whitman's burned-out mission.  From northeastern Oregon came the Walla Wallas, Umatillas, and Cayuses.  From the area drained by the Yakima River and cradled by the great bend of the Columbia came the Yakimas.<br>
<br>
Palouses rode down from their country north of Snake River, and the Nez Perces, both Upper and Lower, arrived from the western foothills of the Rockies beyond the Snake.  Some five thousand Indians gathered to hear what the Great Father's emissaries had to say.  These were Superintendent Palmer of Oregon and Governor and Superintendent Isaac I. Stevens of Washington Territory.<br>
<br>
A West Point graduate, a man of varied attainments and firm opinions, Stevens had resigned from the Army at the age of thirty-five, in 1853, to accept the post of territorial governor of Washington, newly carved from Oregon north of the Columbia.  En route to his capital, Stevens had conducted one of the War Department's Pacific Railway Surveys.<br>
<br>
In the short time since his arrival, the governor had become an enthusiastic promoter of the Pacific Northwest and a vigorous champion of a transcontinental railway following the northern route that he had marked out.  Now his objective was to clear the whole Northwest of Indian land titles, concentrate the natives on reservations, and teach them how to farm.' As a first step, he concluded three treaties with the Puget Sound tribes in late 1854."'<br>
<br>
In the spring of 1855, anticipating the day when settlers would spill over the Cascades to the east, he set forth to try his hand with the tribes beyond the mountains.<br>
<br>
It was an exciting meeting.  The Indians had no desire to give up their land, and some of the chiefs could express themselves quite as forcefully as Governor Stevens.  Leading the opposition were the brothers Kamiakin and Skloom, offspring of a Spokane-Yakima union who had married Yakima women and acquired commanding influence in the Yakima tribe; Owhi, chief of the Kittitas and acknowledged leader of the upper Columbia Salishans; and the Walla Walla Peo-Peo-Mox-Mox, long a friend of the whites and once a guide for Fremont.<br>
<br>
These and most other chiefs resisted Stevens' proposals.  The conservative Lower Nez Perces, under Old Joseph and Looking Glass, echoed this defiance, but the missionized and somewhat op
-
portunistic Lawyer, chief of the Upper Nez Perces, worked tirelessly in behalf of the treaty.  After the governor had argued relentlessly for nearly two weeks, the chiefs gave in and signed -"some," remarks Curtis, in good faith, but most in a spirit of sudden, reckless desire to have the business over, at any cost, and get rid of this persistent annoying commissioner.""<br>
<br>
On June <B>16 </B>Stevens and his party set forth to the northeast, intending to negotiate additional treaties with the Spokanes Coeur d'Alenes, Pend d'Oreilles, and even with the Flatheads and Blackfeet on the upper Missouri.  Although the Walla Walla treaties had not been ratified, and would not be for four years, newspapers promptly published Stevens' announcement opening the country east of the Cascades to settlement.<br>
<br>
Actually it had been open since <B>1850, </B>when the Oregon Donation Land Law sanctioned homesteading without regard to Indian title, but less than a dozen pioneers had ventured beyond the Cascades to take up residence in the Walla Walla Valley.  Now the Stevens treaties coincided with the discovery of gold in the neighborhood of the Hudson's Bay Company post of Fort Colville, high on the Columbia near the Canadian boundary.<br>
<br>
The rush got underway in the summer of 1855- Over the Cascade passes or up the Columbia hurried the prospectors.  By either route they crossed the beartland of the Yakimas.<br>
<br>
To these people the invasion exhibited an unbecoming haste to possess land that the Stevens treaty said they would no longer own.  But the paper had not been approved by the Great Father, reservations had not been marked out, and anyway few intended to give up their land and way of life for a crowded reservation.  For some time Kamiakin had agitated war against the aggressive "Bostons," so unlike the "King George men."<br>
<br>
Now conditions seemed ripe for involving his own and neighboring tribes in a fight to preserve the old order.<br>
<br>
In the Yakima country the Indians had been moved to take the first stand against the encroachment of the white man.  In the Rogue country they were about to make their last stand.  In the autumn of 1855 hostilities broke out in both places.  Civil and military officials alike saw in the simultaneous explosions a prearranged concert between Yakimas and Rogues.  Although no evidence supports such an improbability, General Wool undeniably had a two-front war on his hands.<br>
<br>
For the most part, the original tenants of the temporary Table Rock Reservation-those who for convenience may be labeled Rogue Rivers proper-had kept aloof from the pilferage and sporadic homicide that so enraged the settlers of Rogue River Valley. 
Although Old John agitated persistently for a general uprising against the whites, principally at fault were the disparate bands from elsewhere in southern Oregon that had been attached to the reservation at the beginning of <B>1</B>855.  "<br>
<br>
Even had discrimination between guilty and innocent been possible, however, the settlers had long since lost any inclination to draw it.<br>
<br>
Early in October 1855 Captain Smith took the measure of the citizens' temper and sent word to Sambo and Old Jake, camped a few miles from Fort Lane, that prudence suggested a move to the security of the fort.  The men responded at once, leaving the women and children to follow in a few days.  The delay proved fatal.<br>
<br>
At dawn on October 8, a volunteer company from Jacksonville under Captain James Lupton stormed into Old Jake's camp and left twenty-three women, children, and old men dead, though in the melee Lupton fell with a mortal wound.  Volunteers also fired on Sambo's camp and attacked still a third suspected of harboring "vicious and ill-disposed Indians.<br>
<br>
Next day, in retaliation, a war party swept the length of the valley killing, plundering, and burning; by evening twenty-seven settlers had paid with their lives for the massacre of Old Jake's people."<br>
<br>
As the citizens mobilized for defense, the Indians chose sides.  About three hundred-principally Rogue River followers of Sam, Elijah, and Sambo-hastened to Fort Lane to claim the protection of the dragoons.  Another five hundred, mustering some one hundred and fifty warriors, took to the mountains under Old John, George, Limpy, and others.  These were mainly Shastas, Scotans, Klamaths, Grave Creeks, Umpquas, and Cow Creeks, but including perhaps one hundred Rogues.  "There is no alliance," reported Agent Ambrose, "but the simultaneous hostility of all produces much the same result.""<br>
<br>
"These inhuman butchers and bloody fiends must be met and conquered," cried the Portland Oregonian, "vanquished yes, EXTERMINATED""' On October 15 Governor George Curry called<br>
up two battalions of Volunteers for service in southern Oregon.  Organizing at Roseburg, one of the battalions elected as major William J. Martin, who promptly issued instructions that "in chastising the enemy you will use your own discretion provided you take no prisoners""'<br>
<br>
Captain Smith's two dragoon companies at Fort Lane and the handful of troops at Fort Orford were too few to exert much influence on the situation.  At once the war passed largely into the hands of
the Volunteers.<br>
<br>
Throughout the winter the Volunteers, ultimately numbering fifteen companies, swarmed over the countryside, skirmisbing at times with roving bands of Indians, more often marching and countermarching in cold, rain, snow, and sleet.  The Regulars participated at times, as on October 31 when Smith concentrated some 25o Regulars and Volunteers against a party of between 75 and 150 warriors well posted on Hungry Hill, between Grave and Cow Creeks.  The dragoon captain pressed the attack all day without dislodging the enemy.<br>
<br>
Next day the Indians counterattacked, but they, too, were thrown back.  The battle ended a draw, but with 9 whites dead and 25 wounded."'<br>
<br>
At other times Smith shielded unoffending Indians from the fury of the Volunteers.  Through much of the winter his post harbored several hundred tribesmen who wished to be counted out of the war.  To him late in December came a group of women and children, hands and feet frozen, with the report that again Old Jake had fallen prey to the Volunteers.  Two camps of his band had been attacked fifteen miles from Fort Lane and all the men slain.<br>
<br>
Late in February the dragoons formed to escort four hundred of these refugees through the hostile whites to Port Orford for ultimate concentration on Superintendent Palmer's new Coast Reservation.  But still the war went on.  "It has become a contest of extermination by both whites and Indians," observed General Wool.<br>
<br>
Although faced with two wars in his department, the Pacific commander had not reacted vigorously.  He sailed to Fort Vancouver in November to look over the situation and found a number of circumstances combining to delay a serious effort on either front until spring.  Throughout the winter, moreover, Wool focused his preparation on the Yakima War.  The Rogue River War would be a sideshow to the main effort north of the Columbia, and it would be conducted with such units as could be spared from the Yakima campaign.<br>
<br>
Early in March 1856, his plans matured, General Wool again embarked by steamer for the Columbia, pausing at Fort Humboldt to set the Rogue River forces in motion.  To direct the campaign he selected Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Robert C. Buchanan, major of the 4th Infantry, whom a subaltern remembered as "particularly elated at his own importance, and his fitness for the duties assigned him.<br>
<br>
The plan of action called for the simultaneous movement of three columns toward the lower Rogue River-Buchanan from Fort Humboldt
with three companies of the 4th Infantry and Captain Edward 0. C. Ord's company of the 3d Artillery, Captains Christopher C. Augur and John F. Reynolds with their companies of the 4th Infantry and 3d Artillery from Fort Orford, and Captain Smith with his company of the <B>ist </B>Dragoons downstream from Fort Lane.  All were to converge at the mouth of Rogue River <B>.</B><br>
<br>
Most of the hostiles had drifted into the mountains around the Big Bend of the Rogue, and the "Southern Army" of Oregon Volunteers under Brigadier General John K. Lamerick had formed a screen that discouraged them from returning to the wide stretch of the valley occupied by Jacksonville and other mining towns .<br>
<br>
Moving inland from the coast, Buchanan was to hound the hostiles into surrendering and taking up new homes on the Coast Reservation.  Many in fact had already given up and, in growing encampments at Port Orford and the mouth of the Rogue, awaited transportation to the north.  Others, notably George and Limpy, were wavering.  But Old John remained adamant; the whites bad resolved to kill him and his people, he said, and he might as well die fighting.<br>
<br>
For the better part of two months, Buchanan's command little or nothing except to keep itself supplied and to march futilely among the cold, damp mountains as the Volunteers had been doing all winter.  Smith had skirmished with the hostiles while marching down Rogue River, and Ord fought sharp actions on March 2o and April 26 and 29.<br>
<br>
Early in May, the weather moderating, Buchanan marched his entire command up the Rogtie to the mouth of Illinois River.  From here he sent Indians as emissaries to invite the hostiles to talk with him.  On May <B>21 </B>Old John, George, and Limpy appeared.  The last two seemed inclined to give up, but Old John vowed never to leave his homeland.<br>
<br>
The conference ended with George and Limpy promising to bring their people to Big Meadows, on the north bank of the Rogue above the Big Bend, in three days and surrender to Captain Smith .<br>
<br>
But Old John coerced George and Limpy into going back on their promise.  From other disaffected bands down the river, he enlisted two hundred warriors and laid plans to give Smith a warm reception at Big Meadows, then one at a time to knock off Buchanan's companies, now scattered on packtrain and roadbuilding detail.  Smith reached Big Meadows on May 25 with his fifty dragoons, thirty infantry under Lieutenant Nelson B. Sweitzer, and a howitzer.<br>
<br>
Next day, the appointed date, no Indians appeared, but as heavy rains had fallen the captain reasoned that muddy roads had caused a delay.  That evening, however, two Indian women came to his camp
with a warning that old John would attack next morning.  At once Smith moved his camp from the meadow to a nearby elliptical mound about 25o by <B>20 </B>yards dividing two creeks that flowed into Rogue River.  During the night, as the men laid out defenses, a courier rode out to summon help from Colonel Buchanan.<br>
<br>
At ten o'clock next morning Old John's warriors surrounded Smith's knoll and launched an attack from all sides.  While some posted themselves on neighboring elevations and opened a long-range fire, others worked their way up the hillside and tried to break through the defenses.  The thirty infantrymen and the howitzer crew bore the brunt of the fighting, for the musketoons of <B>the</B> dragoons took effect only when assault parties approached close to the lines.  During the night, as the warriors kept up a steady sniping fire, the troops dug rifle pits and erected breastworks.<br>
<br>
On the morning of the twenty-eighth the battle resumed.  Old John could be heard shouting, cursing, and exhorting his men to greater effort.  His words were translated for Smith by the two Indian women who had alerted him to the impending attack.  Warriors waved ropes in the air, taunting the beleaguered soldiers with the fate that had been planned for them.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, with a third of the command dead or wounded, ammunition running low, and water gone since early morning, the defenders saw the Indians mass for a major assault on two sides.  They had started up the hill when Smith glimpsed help on the way-Augur's infantry company advancing at double time.<br>
<br>
The dragoons and the infantrymen leaped from their positions and poured down the slope just as Augur's men struck from the rear.  In fifteen minutes the warriors hadfled to the hills, dragging their dead and wounded with them .<br>
<br>
For Smith it had been a near thing.  He had lost nine killed and seventeen wounded, and Augur counted two killed and three wounded in his company.  But the Battle of Big Mead ows, coupled with the movement of Lamerick's Volunteers from the east, convinced nearly all the hostile leaders that the game was up.<br>
<br>
George and Limpy surrendered to Buchanan and Superintendent Palmer on MaY 3o, and the bands on the lower Rogue that had helped Old John at Big Meadows laid down their arms during the first week of June.  Not until June <B>29,</B> however, after several brushes with the Volunteers, did Old John finally submit to the inevitable."<br>
<br>
The Rogue River War and its aftermath stripped southern Oregon and northern California of most of the native population.  During June and July more than twelve hundred Indians were conducted from Port Orford by steamer to the Coast Reservation.- Buchanan's soldiers went along, as much to protect the Indians from citizens as to
prevent defections.  In California, more than one hundred Shasta refugees, collected at Fort Jones by Captain Judah to save them from annihilation, were colonized on the Nome Lackee Reservation.<br>
<br>
The Army abandoned Forts Orford and Lane and erected Forts Hoskins, Yamhill, and Umpqua to seal off the approaches by which Volunteers might gain access to the Coast Reservation, whose establishment had kindled angry resentment among Oregonians."' Two years later, in 1858, Fort Jones was also abandoned.<br>
<br>
The Rogue River War lasted nine months, and except for the concluding phases it was principally a contest between Volunteers and Indians.  Although Buchanan's troops played an important role in bringing about the final surrender, the result had been produced mainly by Governor Curry's citizen-soldiers.  They operated under orders to take no prisoners, and they rarely distinguished between neutral and hostile.<br>
<br>
General Wool and Superindent Palmer contended that such harsh tactics, ethical considerations aside, prolonged the war by driv-
ing submissive bands into the hostile ranks.  Whether the "Southern Army" lengthened or shortened the war, it undeniably would have ended it without the participation of the Regulars.<br>
<br>
In the final reckoning, perhaps the most important service Colonel Buchanan rendered was to save twelve hundred Indians from the slaughter that almost certainly awaited them had he not been there to receive the surrender.<br>

ROGUE RIVER WAR OF 1855-56.<br>
<br>

<br>
The Rogue River Indian War of 1855-56 began with the massacre of Indians on the banks of the Rogue River.  Almost eight months later the decisive battle was fought 100 miles downstream on a mountain ridge overlooking the river.<br>
<br>
During the war, the Rogue River Indians of southwestern Oregon fought 1,000 soldiers for final possession of their land, a mountainous region larger than Connecticut.  Much of the fighting
occurred along the Rogue River itself.  The river was the scene of bitter skirmishes, several major battles, and brutal murders of women and children committed by both sides.<br>
<br>
The <B>following stories</B>, based mainly on original sources, describe most of the actions along the river.  The writer has attempted to present an unbiased account of the events.<br>
<br>
Indian Battles Along the Rogue River, although not a history of the Indian war, still gives the reader a general view of the conflict.<br>
<br>
MASSACRES ON THE RIVER<br>
<br>
The Indian war started at dawn Oct. 8, 1855, when a company of gold miners and several "worthy" citizens deliberately attacked two camps of Indians near the mouth of Little Butte Creek.  Organized by "Major" James A. Lupton, the men had decided to punish the Indians for alleged cattle rustling.<br>
<br>
Before daylight, the volunteers quietly surrounded the camps by crawling through the dense chaparral that lined the Rogue River.  At a signal, they burst among the sleeping Indians and shot many of them with rifles and six shooters.  They killed 15 women and children and eight men at Jake's camp, which was on the north side of the river not far from Upper Table Rock.<br>
<br>
Four of the dead men (all "very old") had awakened and escaped into the brush but were persuaded to surrender by several Indian women whose lives were threatened.  When the old men gave up their bows and arrows, they were shot down unmercifully.<br>
<br>
At the same time, a smaller force attacked Sambo's band on the south side of the river.  The whites killed one woman and wounded three (another woman and two boys).<br>
<br>
By 10 a.m., their bloody and secret mission accomplished, the volunteers had disbanded but two men lay dying.  While charging the brush, James Lupton nearly stumbled over an Indian lying on his back.  The brave shot an arrow by pushing the bow far ahead with his feet.  The obsidian-tipped shaft ripped through Lupton's rib cage and penetrated the left lung.  He died two days later.  Then young George Shepherd, mortally wounded by an arrow in the abdomen, died Oct. 9.<br>
<br>
Later that warm October day, Indian agent George H. Ambrose and Army Capt.  Andrew Jackson Smith from nearby Fort Lane sadly inspected the sites of the massacre.  Both men, who had tried for many months to avert war in the Rogue Valley, now realized it was too late.  They knew Chief John, who had waited long for a motive to begin hostilities, would rally all the dissident bands from the Klamath River in northern California to Cow Creek in the Umpqua Mountains north of the Rogue Valley.
Within 24 hours of the Lupton massacre, a small party of well-armed Shastas gathered for revenge.  Their leader Chief John reportedly killed the first white person himself.  William Guin, employe at the Table Rock Reservation, died near the house he was building for John.  The chief said, "i want no house.  I am going to fight until I die!"<br>
<br>
John's warriors and others murdered at least 20 people on Oct. 9 along the Oregon-California Trail from Evans Creek to Grave Creek.  Beginning at Jewett's Ferry at the mouth of Evans Creek, the Indians killed a packer and wounded another.  Three miles farther down the Rogue at Evans' Ferry, they mortally wounded Isaac Shelton.  Their other victims included Mr. and Mrs. John K. Jones, who lived one mile east of present Grants Pass.  After killing them and burning their house, John's party left the Rogue and followed the trail north toward Louse Creek.<br>
<br>
On the south side of Louse Creek stood Jacob Wagoner's house, a stopping place for travelers.  Wagoner had just shown Sarah Pellet, a visiting temperance lecturer, the trail to Crescent City, Calif.  Returning, he discovered Indians encircling his house.  Horrified, the unarmed man ran for help because inside his home were his wife and daughter.  But the next day soldiers from Fort Lane found the bones of Roana Wagoner and little Mary among the ashes of the house.<br>
<br>
After killing the Wagoners, John and his eight men left for the Illinois Valley.  However, Cow Creeks and warriors from Chief George's band, camped near Wagoners place, continued the massacres by attacking the log house of George Harris, whose claim was two miles northwest.  Here they killed the hired man Frank Reed and fatally wounded Harris.<br>
<br>
Before dying, he showed his wife Mary how to load his Kentucky rifle.  With her husband dead and her daughter Sophia wounded in the arm, she defended the house nearly 18 hours.  Troops rescued them later, but 10-year old David Harris, who was not home, was never found.<br>
<br>
The Indians withdrew to the mountains after killing others, including three men on Grave Creek and members of the Haines' family at present Merlin, Ore.  Haines and his son were killed outright while his captured wife and daughter were either murdered later or, according to the Indians, they died from the flu.<br>
<br>
FALL <B>BATTLES</B><br>
<br>
On Oct. 17, the Indians attacked the isolated gold settlement of Galice that was protected by a volunteer company commanded by Capt.  William B. Lewis.  He held an exposed and almost untenable position on "Skull Bar," just below the mouth of Galice Creek. 
Bordering his camp was a steep, heavily timbered ridge while behind the position ran the Rogue River, swift and deep.<br>
<br>
During the fight, the Indians rushed down the mountain side and nearly overwhelmed the volunteers who were fighting in one or two board houses and behind a log breastwork.  By the end of the day, the warriors had killed four soldiers and wounded seven, including Capt.  Lewis.<br>
<br>
Two weeks later, a force of 300 volunteers and 104 U. S. Army regulars, all under the command of Capt.  Andrew Jackson Smith of Fort Lane, marched against a large concentration of Rogue River Indians in the Grave Creek Hills north of the Rogue Valley.  Here the troops fought the Battle of Hungry Hill (Oct. 31-Nov. 1, 1855), which was the only major <B>encounter during</B> that unusually cold winter.<br>
<br>
The battleground was on the divide between Grave Creek and Cow Creek, or approximately four miles northeast of the Rogue River where it is joined by Grave Creek.<br>
<br>
Marching during the night of Oct. 30 to surprise the Indians, the troops found in the morning only an abandoned camp.  While regulars unthinkingly built fires to warm themselves, scouts soon discovered the enemy on a high ridge four miles north.  But alert Indian sentinels, observing the smoke from their old camp, fired rifles to warn the others.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Capt.  T. S. "Smiley" Harris and his volunteers had slipped up within one-half mile of the Indians' position.  Capt.  Harris commanded his men to fire hoping the Indians wouldn't see the approaching main column led by Capt.  Smith and volunteer Col.  John E. Ross of Jacksonville.  Surprised, the braves began attacking Capt.  Harris' men but stopped when they saw the other troops.<br>
<br>
At once, the Indians moved up to a high point on the ridge and waited.  Capt.  Smith and Col.  Ross ordered a frontal assault.  Eagerly, the soldiers ran forward and some of the volunteers, anxious to arrive first, shed their coats and threw away packs.  The attackers were met by a devastating fire from the Indians.  Men dropped all around but the other troops took the peak as the Indians scampered down the other side.<br>
<br>
Unaware they were entering the enemy's main fortification, the soldiers pursued the Indians into a densely wooded canyon at the base of the mountain.  All day, the troops were pinned down by accurate rifle fire from 100 warriors concealed behind rocks and trees.  Each time units charged the thick brush, they were repulsed with losses.<br>
<br>
That night the soldiers camped in a hollow they named "Bloody Springs" for their many wounded and dying comrades.  Men tried to
sleep on the hard ground but were startled by a shot.  They found the body of Army Pvt.  Krollpreiffer, who had accidentally killed himself with his rifle while stepping over a log.  Then someone fired a shotgun in the dark and three regulars were wounded.<br>
<br>
At sunrise, the Indians surrounded the camp and within a short time attacked.  Army Lt.  Horatio G. Gibson was wounded in the thigh-the lead ball narrowly missed an artery.  The fight lasted until 10 a.m. when the Indians suddenly withdrew and joined their women and children at another encampment.<br>
<br>
The soldiers marched wearily across steep mountains<B> to </B>the <B>settlements.  Exhausted men some</B>how carried litters for the casualties, which were 12 killed and 26 wounded.  The estimated loss for the Indians ranged from seven to 20 killed.<br>
<br>
Lt. George Crook, later the general who fought Chief Geronimo, was at Wolf Creek 14 miles east of the Battle of Hungry Hill.  In his autobiography, he wrote, "The troops left the Indians monarchs of the woods."<br>
<br>
THE GOLD BEACH UPRISING<br>
<br>
Settlement of the lower Rogue River began in 1853 after gold was discovered in the black sands extending north and south of the river mouth.  Soon a collection of shanties formed on the south side and the community became Gold Beach although briefly it had the ominous name of Sebastopol.<br>
<br>
The Indians surrounding Gold Beach remained peaceful almost five months while the war raged in the interior.  Still the settlers, not trusting the natives who far outnumbered them, organized on Oct. 26, 1855, a militia company called the Gold Beach Guards.<br>
<br>
That winter 25 Guards manned a log fort at Big Bend, 40 miles up the Rogue, to prevent the intrusion of the warring upper Rogues, who constantly visited the area to persuade the lower river Indians to join them.<br>
<br>
Despite the efforts of the volunteers and the diligent work of Indian agent Ben Wright to maintain peace, the lower Rogues suddenly attacked Gold Beach and vicinity during the night of Feb. 22, 1856.  Leader of the uprising was a half breed named Enos, who had been friendly toward the miners.<br>
<br>
Enos' attack was well timed because many of the settlers, including half the Gold Beach Guards, were celebrating Washington's Birthday at an all-night dance in Gold Beach.  Only a dozen volunteers protected Capt.  John Poland's camp, four miles up the river on the north side.  The Guards had moved from Big Bend earlier in the month.<br>
<br>
During the night, supposedly friendly Indians came to the
volunteer camp and informed Capt.  Poland and Ben Wright that Enos had joined the upper Rogues and was in their camp.  The white men crossed the river to arrest the renegade.  While staying in a house, Capt.  Poland and Ben were taken by surprise and murdered by Enos and others.  An Indian account said the victims were struck down with hatchets and Ben's body was "cut in pieces."<br>
<br>
Shortly afterwards, the Indians attacked the volunteer camp.  Desperately, Sgt.  Barney Castle and his eleven men fought for their lives against a superior force.  He and six others were killed before the survivors managed to escape through the brush.<br>
<br>
Below Capt.  Poland's camp, Constable Michael Riley, who had gone up river before dawn to serve a summons, heard the firing.  Immediately, he rowed his skiff toward Gold Beach.  After arriving, he warned the people to expect an attack.  Hastily, the settlers crossed the Rogue River in small boats and on rafts.<br>
<br>
At his house, Riley tried not to alarm his wife Maria by telling her to get ready for a "short trip." His New England wife looked at him and said calmly, "Michael, the Indians have broken out, haven't they?" The couple packed clothes, pots and pans, and other necessities. They bundled Hattie Riley, aged 4, for the trip across the bay.  Before getting into the boat, Riley hid a trunk filled with Maria's best china.<br>
<br>
Across the low sand hills that bordered the beach, the Rileys and others made their way to Fort Miner, the town's fortification 11/2 miles north of the Rogue River.  The unfinished post consisted of two log buildings enclosed by a high earthen embankment.<br>
<br>
On Feb. 25, Enos and his 50 warriors tried to storm the fort.  But the Gold Beach Guards, now commanded by Capt.  Reif Bledsoe, drove the Indians back.  Enos never attacked the fort again.  Instead he decided to starve the 130 whites out.<br>
<br>
The Gold Beach uprising had been disastrous for the settlers.  The Indians killed 23 people, including Ben Wright and the soldiers, and they burned 60 houses along the Rogue River and the coast.  Gold Beach itself was a grotesque setting of death and destruction: burned out cabins, wrecked flumes, and mutilated bodies.  While around one stump were scattered broken pieces of Maria Riley's china.<br>
<br>
THE ROGUE RIVER CAMPAIGN<br>
<br>
Army Maj.  John F. Reynolds at Fort Orford 27 miles north of Gold Beach couldn't help the besieged people at Fort Miner because his small artillery company had to protect the town of Port Orford.  Then Capt.  C. C. Augur's infantry company, which arrived Mar. 9, left five days later for the mouth of the Illinois on the Rogue to meet other U. S. troops.  From there, Lt.  Col.  Robert C. Buchanan, commander of the combined force, planned to battle the upper Rogue Indians at their Big Meadows' stronghold (25 miles
farther up the river) and hopefully "bring them to reason."<br>
<br>
Arriving on Mar. 18 and before the other troops, Capt.  Augur found a large evacuated Shasta Costa village opposite the mouth of the Illinois.  His scouts spotted the Indians, who had crossed the Rogue in canoes, among the ranches on the east bank of the Illinois.  Capt.  Augur ordered an immediate attack.  One detachment moved to the bank of the Rogue and opened up with musket fire while the mountain howitzer lobbed canisters of shot among the huts.<br>
<br>
Caught in the open, the Indians canoed across the mouth of the Illinois and took a safer position on a wooded mountain side.  From there, the Shasta Costas returned such a random fire that the soldiers were able to burn the main village on their side without danger.<br>
<br>
Improving their aim somewhat the next morning, the Indians forced some of the troops to duck while they were eating breakfast.  But no one was hurt either day.  Since Col.  Buchanan was now four days late, Capt.  Augur assumed the colonel had changed his plans.  Leaving five Indians dead, Capt.  Augur and his men marched for the coast.<br>
<br>
On Mar. 20, one day after Capt.  Augur had left the Illinois, Col.  Buchanan's command of two companies arrived at Gold Beach after a five-day overland journey from Crescent City, Calif.  The colonel, 32 miles away from his rendezvous because he considered the Chetco River trail to the Illinois "impractical," became the unintentional savior of Fort Miner.  His troops and 33 volunteers (recruits for the Gold Beach Guards) under Lt.  George H. Abbott relieved the mud and log fort on Mar. 21.  Happily, the people poured out after a siege of 27 days.<br>
<br>
After setting up his headquarters on the north side of the Rogue, Col.  Buchanan began planning his campaign.  Capt.  Augur's command arrived Mar. 24, but the colonel hadn't heard from Capt.  Andrew Jackson Smith.  The Fort Lane commander was coming down the Illinois River trail with 94 men intending to meet Col.  Buchanan and Capt.  Augur at Big Bend, seven miles above the mouth of the Illinois.<br>
<br>
While Col.  Buchanan was conferring with his company commanders over 30 miles to the west, Capt.  Smith on Mar. 24 stood on a high ridge above the mouth of the Illinois.  Across the Rogue he saw the ruins of the Shasta Costa village Augur had burned six days before.  Capt.  Smith, Indian fighter and veteran of the Mexican War, nodded when his scouts reported Indians among the huts on the east bank of the Illinois.  His eyes snapped nervously when he heard that neither Col.  Buchanan nor Capt.  Augur were in the vicinity.  Nevertheless, Capt.  Smith ordered the bugler to sound the charge.<br>
<br>

By the time the dismounted troopers reached the ranches, the Indians had escaped 300 yards down the Rogue in their dugouts.  After landing, the warriors slipped back to the mountain opposite Capt.  Smith and opened fire.  Ironically, he occupied the same position the Indians had during Capt.  Augur's opening attack.  After burning the huts around them, Capt.  Smith and his men withdrew to their camp on the ridge.<br>
<br>
For five days Capt.  Smith waited for Col.  Buchanan.  Near<B>ly</B> out of food and with Pvts.  David Kennedy and William Garry wounded, Capt.  Smith finally left for Fort Orford.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Col.  Buchanan sent on Mar. 26 Capt.  Edward 0. C. Ord and 113 men to destroy the Mikonotunne village about 11 miles up the Rogue on the north side.  Supporting Capt.  Ord, another command of 72 men under Capt.  Augur marched on the south bank.  After an arduous mountain hike of 61/2 hours, Capt.  Ord's troops reached the deserted village, which was on a sheltered river meadow.  Directly, Capt.  Ord <B>ordered the men </B> burn the thatched houses.<br>
<br>
Seeing their village in flames, about 60 braves rushed down a mountain on the other side and paddled their canoes hastily across the Rogue.  They attacked the detail guarding the mules and packs, but Lt.  John Drysdale's detachment promptly drove the Indians back.  Next, Capt.  De Lancey Floyd-Jones and his infantry company ran 250 yards to prevent the enemy from occupying a timbered ridge behind the village; however, the Indians arrived first.<br>
<br>
Without hesitation, Capt.  Ord ordered his entire command to take the ridge.  Succeeding, the troops regrouped for a final attack against the Indians, who had withdrawn to a knoll a short distance away.  Finally, they forced the Indians to retreat across the Rogue with eight killed.  Capt.  Ord had two men wounded.  He and Capt.  Augur (the latter officer arrived too late to participate) marched their tired men back to camp.<br>
<br>
On April 5, Capt.  Smith arrived at Fort Orford where he found Col.  Buchanan at his new headquarters.<br>
<br>
EXPEDITIONS TO THE MEADOWS<br>
<br>
The wild country along the Rogue River between Horseshoe Bend and Mule Creek was called the "Meadows" by the pioneers.  They named the area for the occasional mountain grasslands that were 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the river on the north side.  Otherwise, the rugged land was covered with dense forests.<br>
<br>
After the Battle of Hungry Hill, several hundred upper Rogue River Indians, including their women and children, holed up at the Meadows for the winter.  Their encampments were on secure river bars
protected by the turbulent Rogue and steep, wooded slopes to the rear.<br>
<br>
In November of 1855, a force of 386 volunteers and 50 Army regulars tried to capture a camp of 200 Indians at Black Bar, which was five miles upstream from the military headquarters at Little Meadows.  As usual, the Indians were on the other side of the river.  The operation failed when <B>Indians  fired</B><B> </B>on volunteers attempting to cross the river, probably at Jenny Creek.<br>
<br>
After five or six hours of fighting, the volunteers withdrew.  The entire force, faced with deepening snows and dwindling supplies, left the Meadows with one man dead and four wounded.<br>
<br>
Another expedition returned to the Meadows in April of 1856.  Gen.  John K. Lamerick, commander of the Oregon Mounted Volunteers, took the field himself.  He was deter mined to defeat the Indians with his "Southern  Army"  of 545 men.  Furthermore,  the  general  took  along  two  collapsible canvas boats because he intended to get on the same side of the Rogue as the Indians!<br>
<br>
After Gen.  Lamerick's command camped at Little Meadows, scouts found the Indians on a river bar (later named Battle Bar), about 1 1/2 miles down river.  As expected, the enemy was on the opposite side.<br>
<br>
Unperturbed by the news, Gen.  Lamerick planned a night crossing at the mouth of Meadow Creek.  However, Maj.  James Bruce objected to the idea.  He claimed the medical station at Little meadows would be too far away for any casualties.  Gen.  Lamerick reluctantly changed his strategy.<br>
<br>
Before daylight on April 27, Col.  John Kelsay's command of 100 men marched to the ridge overlooking Winkle Bar, about a mile below the Indian encampment.  Col.  Kelsay hoped to lure the Indians across the river for a fight on the north side.  But no Indians were seen below.  Then Col.  Kelsay led his column to the ridge directly across from Battle Bar.  While Indians ran "backwards and forwards," Col.  Kelsay's command quickly moved to the river edge.<br>
<br>
In his report to Gen.  Lamerick, Col.  Kelsay described the fight:<br>
<br>
Many Indians had not yet got out of their huts.  The soldiers poured a heavy fire on them.  Men, squaws and children were all together in great confusion-nothing saved them but the river.  The enemy took positions behind rocks and trees (and fired).  The squaws and children disappeared in a dense growth of fir.<br>
<br>
The enemy lined themselves behind trees above their camp and while they were watching our movements, the detachment (150 men) under Major Bruce came down in great haste without being discovered. Captain Abel George poured in the whole fire of his company. <B>A</B> fire was kept up during the day. There were 25 or 30 of the enemy killed.
Only one volunteer was hit  during  the  battle.  Pvt.  Elias<br>
D.     Mercer died later.<br>
<br>
On the 28th, Col.  Kelsay and 150 men attempted to cross<br>
the Rogue near Quail Creek, three miles below Battle Bar.  The troops were fired on by Indians hidden behind trees on the opposite side and for the next three hours each side exchanged shots.  One man was wounded and one or two Indians were killed.  Although the Indians had left, Col.  Kelsay decided against a crossing and returned to headquarters.<br>
<br>
Finally, Gen.  Lamerick and two battalions crossed the Rogue April 29 by using the general's two canvas boats.  At the abandoned Indian camp on Battle Bar, the soldiers found the remains of 75 campfires and two scalps.  Recrossing the river later, Gen.  Lamerick ordered one detachment to build Fort Lamerick at Big Meadows.  Then he and the regiment marched over snow-covered mountains to Roseburg and Fort Leland.<br>
<br>
THE BATTLE OF BIG BEND<br>
<br>
After Gen.  Lamerick's volunteer regiment had dislodged the upper Rogues from their stronghold at the Meadows, the Indians moved down toward the Big Bend country.  They were trapped in this area after Col.  Buchanan's entire command of 343 regulars ascended the Rogue River beginning May 9.<br>
<br>
Arriving at Oak Flat, four miles up the Illinois, Col.  Buchanan invited the chiefs for a peace council at his camp. During the talks, held May 19-22, Chiefs George and Limpy agreed to surrender in a few days, but Chief John refused.  The leader of the Oct. 9th uprising vowed: "I will fight!"<br>
<br>
Col.  Buchanan, discounting Old John's threat, sent Capt.  Smith's command to receive the surrender parties at the Big Bend meadow.  While waiting for them, Capt.  Smith was told by friendly Indian boys that Chief John would attack him in the morning.  Since it was nearly dark, Capt.  Smith hurriedly moved his camp a knoll about one-half mile west of the meadow.<br>
<br>
Gathered among the great black oaks and the twisted red madrones atop the hill, Capt.  Smith and his 96 soldiers waited for the Indians, who would come either to surrender or fight once more.  Already that morning several of George's people had arrived and said the rest were coming.  Yet the Army commander felt uneasy as he recalled John's threat and the warning from the boys.  Then the lookouts reported dugouts were landing below.<br>
<br>
Soon parties of Indians moved up the gentle east slope toward the Army's position.  They stopped after Capt.  Smith refused to let them enter his camp because they were armed.  More Indians approached and many were recognized as John's.  Capt.  Smith ordered
his men to load but not to fire first.  By 10 a.m. on May 27, over 150 braves had surrounded the soldiers.<br>
<br>
One hour later, the battle began when a large group of warriors advanced up the north slope.  The howitzer crew fired a canister of shot at them, and Capt.  Smith's troopers drove the Indians into the brush.  Meanwhile, Lt.  Nelson B. Sweitzer's infantry repulsed two other attacking parties.  Unable to take the hill, the Indians began a deadly cross fire from the ridge on the north and the east slope.<br>
<br>
The intense fire forced Capt.  Smith to withdraw his men to a position behind the crest of the hill.  By the end of the day, Capt.  Smith's casualties were four killed and 16 wounded. That night Lt.  Sweitzer's men piled up packs, tents, and provisions for a makeshift breastwork to protect the wounded. Other soldiers dug rifle pits with their mess kits.<br>
<br>
The situation became worse the next day.  Chief John, directing the battle from the north ridge, ordered mass charges.  Although Capt.  Smith had the chief's loud commands interpreted and took proper countermeasures, the West Pointer realized his position was hopeless.  He had 22 casualties now and his ammunition was nearly exhausted.<br>
<br>
At his headquarters opposite the mouth of the Illinois, Col. <B>Buchanan heard </B>about  heard about the battle form a messenger. Right away, the colonel dispatched Captain Augur with fifty four men to assist Capt.  Smith.  After a forced march of 2 1/2 hours, the relief column reached Big Bend at 4 p.m. By that time, Capt.  Smith had fought Chief John nearly 30 hours.<br>
<br>
While Capt.  Augur's men drove the Indians off adjacent hills, Lt.  Sweitzer's detachment charged the enemy on the knoll.  Running in disorder, John's warriors found themselves cut off from their canoes.  However, they escaped by crossing a steep ravine and climbing the mountain on the other side.<br>
<br>
The Battle of Big Bend was the Army's most severe engagement in Oregon up to that time.  The total casualties were 11 killed and 16 wounded, including two killed and three wounded in Capt- Augur's company.<br>
<br>
Two days later, Chiefs George and Limpy and other upper Rogue bands surrendered to Col.  Buchanan at Big Bend.  The lower Rogues, deserted by Enos who had led them during the Gold Beach uprising, gave up three weeks later.  Chief John was the last to surrender.  With only 35 warriors left, he was unable to fight for his land any longer.  He surrendered June 29 to Capt.  Ord and Maj.  Reynolds on Rinehart Creek, 15 miles up the coast from the Rogue River.<br>
<br>
Nearly 1,200 Indians from southwestern Oregon were taken by steamer and land from Port Orford to the Coast Reservation, 175 miles north.  The Rogue country now belonged to the white man.

<br>
The valley of Rogue River received settlers about the same time, and here the influence of gold discoveries was strongly felt.  California miners had already prospected the Sierras to the borders of the Oregon country; and just at the close of the year <B>i </B>85 <B>i </B>rich placer mines were discovered on Jackson Creek, a branch of Rogue River.  A new rush began, Californians and Oregonians both taking part in it, so that in a very short time the village of Jacksonville had a population of several hundred, and a number of other mining centres were established in the same neighbourhood.  Settlers pushed in at the <B>same </B>time to take up the fertile lands along the Rogue River and its branches.  While these things were going forward in the upper portions of the valleys of south<B>ern </B>Oregon, settlements were also begun near the mouths of the rivers, especially at Port Orford and about Coos Bay.<br>
<br>
The discovery of coal near Coos Bay gave it <B>a </B>large trade with San Francisco.  The various centres of population were connected with one another by means of mountain roads and trails; the interest in gold mining stimulated emigration, and a population of several thousand people was soon to be found within this territory, which at the beginning of the California gold rush was an absolute wildemess, occupied by native barbarians.<br>
<B><br>
<br>
The Rogue River War.<br>
<br>
</B>When the early missionaries and settlers came to Oregon they found the Indians under the control of the Hudson's Bay Fur Company, whose officers were able to secure for the whites such lands and other privileges as the Indians had to bestow.  The company was very suc-
cessful in preventing conflicts between the two races.  Only rarely were the settlers molested by the natives during these years, the most notable exception being the Whitman massacre in 1847.<br>
<br>
When the United States took control, in 1849, the situation had become more difficult to handle.  Settlers were by this time becom-
ing numerous; the Indians had begun to fear for the safety of their lands, and they were  not yet convinced of the national govemment's power.<br>
<br>
Soon afterward troubles began, especially in the newly occupied territory of southern Oregon, where miners and travellers were
occasionally murdered, and settlers driven from their lands.  In some cases, it must be confessed, the whites were to blame as well as the red men.  But the time soon came when the tribes of southern Oregon were ready to go on the war path, and then hundreds of innocent persons suffered the untold horrors which have always marked such savage outbreaks.<br>
<br>
Men were shot down on the highway or in the field; at dead of night unprotected families were besieged in their cabins, the men killed outright, the women and childrenenslaved, and homes burned to the ground; sometimes whole settlements were either massacred or driven away.  This war, usually called, from the most terrible of the tribes concerned in it, the Rogue River War, began in 1851. It lasted, with some intermissions, till 1856, when the Indians, being removed to reservations, the settlers were at last secure in the possession of their homes.<br>
<br>
Southern Oregon was not the only section of the Northwest to suffer from the uprising of the natives during this period.  On Puget Sound, too, the Indians began to murder white men as early as 1850, though no general outbreak occurred until several years later.  In 1854-1855 General Stevens, as superintendent of Indian affairs, made treaties with nearly all of the tribes both in eastern and  western Washington, and it was supposed that these would put an end to all conflict between the two races.<br>
<br>
But as a matter of fact the natives, seeing the country filling up with white people, were about ready for a general war in defence of what they considered to be their own country.  The situation here was not different from that which brought on the great Indian wars in other sections of the United States.<br>
<br>
Just as New England had its King Philip's War, and the middle West its struggles with Tecumseh and Black Hawk, so the people of the Pacific Northwest, when settlement threatened to crowd the Indians off their lands, were forced to meet great combinations of native tribes under Chief John, Leschi, Kamiakin, and others.<br>
<br>
Except in southern Oregon, these wars came mainly in the years 1855-
1858.  They included many harrowing incidents, like the murder of the settlers in White River valley near Puget Sound, the daring attack upon the little village of Seattle in the spring of 1856, the slaughter of the emigrants on the Malheur River, and massacres at the Cascades.<br>
<br>
The United States government maintained troops at various places throughout the Northwest, and in some cases these rendered effective service during the Indian war; but their numbers were too small to meet the great emergency, while difficulties arose between the territorial officers and the military commanders that caused the burden of the war to fall mainly upon the people themselves.  Volunteer companies were called into the field, who with some severe fighting and much attendant hardship were able to bring this distressing period to a close.

Elsie Frankland Marriott, <B>Bainbridge Through Bifocals.</B> Seattle:Gateway Printing Company, 1941. p. 30 +<br>
<br>
Old Chief Seattle was the greatest personality of all the Puget Sound Indians.The pronunciation of his name was hard for the English tongue; the name Sealth being no more accurate than the name seattle, which was adopted at the suggestion of Doctor Maynard for the city of Seattle.<br>
<br>
He was born about 1786. "Seattle himself pointed out to Mrs. Maynard a place on  Blake Island which had been a camping ground of his ancestors and told her that he was born there. When he was about six years old he was among those who gazed with wonder upon Vancouver's ships anchored near that island in the year 1792." (Hanford, <B>Seattle and Environs.).<br>
<br>
</B>Samuel F. Coombs, one of the first school teachers on Bainbridge Island, interviewed several of the oldest natives of his time as to how Seattle became head of so many tribes. "They said," said Mr. Coombs, "that when Sealth was twenty or twenty-two years old news reached the various tribes in this vicinity that a large number of the mountain or upper Green River and White River Indians were preparing to made a raid upon the salt water tribes. Great anxiety was felt among the latter, as the mountain tribes were redoubtable warriors, and on several previous occasions vanquished the salt water tribes and carried off many of their people as slaves.<br>
<br>
"Accordingly, a council of war, composed of the chiefs and leading warriors of the tribes expecting to be attacked met at the Old Man House near Port Madison. This place was the principal rendezvous of these tribes for potlatches and councils. At this council many plans were discussed as to the best method of resisting the invaders.<br>
<br>
"None of these suggested by the older men, however, was satisfactory and then the younger men were called upon for suggestion. At length young Sealth, a member of the Old Man House tribe, presented his plan and it was so well devised and so clearly presented that, without listening to any others, it was  adopted and he was appointed to carry it out, being given command of the expedition.<br>
<br>
"Then, they went up the Duwamish river in canoes to a place called Mox-la-push, which is at the junction of the White and Black River, where the Duwamish begins. There is a hill of considerable size in the triangle between the White River and the Black River that was covered with fir timber.<br>
<br>
"The White River curves around the foot of the hill so that objects on either side of the hill cannot be seen from the river above or below. Seattle, with his company, got there in time to obstruct the
passage of canoes down the White  River which they did by felling a fir tree across the stream. That was a considerable task for them to accomplish with their blunt axes, but the tree was cut down and it fell exactly as desired, the ends resting on a low bank on either side, just above the running water.<br>
<br>
"Then their task accomplished, they waited during the hours of the night for the expected catastrophe, and were not disappointed. A fleet of canoes, carrying one hundred marauders came around the bend in the river with momentum augmented by its strong current and they dashed upon the fallen tree and thereby capsized.<br>
<br>
"A fierce battle ensued with a complete victory for Seattle and his men.  For that exploit, Seattle was highly honored by the salt water Indians; not unanimously at first, but after visiting different camps and holding pow-wows, the reluctant ones were persuaded to acknowledge the superiority of his character and to ratify the election of him as chief of six tribes."<br>
<br>
Seattle was an intelligent Indian, and when the whites began to arrived he considered the benefits to be derived for his people by their arrival and was friendly. He became acquainted with Doctor Maynard in Olympia and persuaded the doctor to come to the Sound and "...to establish a salmon fisher which would provide employment for Indians with remuneration for their labor."<br>
<br>
He had his picture taken but one, Mr. Clarence Bagley informs us, and that was in the summer of 1865 at which time Mr. Bagley happened to be present when the picture was taken in a ramshackle building at what is now  First South and Main Streets in Seattle.<br>
<br>
"He was married twice, and had two sons and five daughters. He had eight slaves at the time the whites first came to Puget Sound, six of whom were slave by descent, the other two he had purchased. It is said that he purchased them out of pity, from another who had treated them cruelly." (Inez Denny, <B>Blazing the Way.).<br>
<br>
</B>He was baptized by a Catholic priest, at which time he was given the name of Noah, which appears on his grave. The last years of his life he spent at the Port Madison Indian Reservation and at Agate Point on Bainbridge Island in a little house near that of his grand daughter, Mary, and her husband, William DeShaw.<br>

SEATTLE'S BATTLE.<br>
<br>
Clarence Bagley, "Seattle's Battle," <B>Washington Historical Quarterly.</B> XXII (October, 1931) p. 247-248.
Samuel F. Coombs, of Seattle, between whom and the wr<br>
warm friendship existed from the year 1860 down to the time of Seattle's death, among many reminiscences of early days gave this<br>
one of Chief Seattle:<br>
<br>
"The first time I ever saw Sealth was in the summer of 1860 shortly after my arrival, at a council of chiefs in Seattle.  At that time there was an unusually large number of Indians in town over one thousand being congregated on the sandy beach.<br>
<br>
Most of the Indians were standing around or talking in groups or listening to the deliberations of the council of about twenty of the oldest Indians seated in a circle on the ground.  The chief figure was venerable looking old native, who was apparently acting as judge as all who spoke addressed themselves to him.<br>
<br>
I learned from an intelligent looking Indian who could speak English, that the old judge was Chief Sealth.<br>
<br>
"With this young man as interpreter I interviewed several of the oldest natives as to how Sealth became head chief of the many tribes.  They said that about fifty years before that time, when.  Seattle was twenty or twenty-two years old, news reached the vari-
ous tribes in this vicinity that a large number of mountain or Upper Green and White Rivers Indians were preparing to make a raid upon the saltwater tribes.<br>
<br>
General anxiety was felt among the latter, as the mountain tribes were redoubtable warriors, and had, on several previous occasions vanquished them and carried off many of their people to slavery.<br>
<br>
"A council of war was held, composed of the chiefs of the leading tribes expecting to be attacked.  After the old men had presented their plans, none were satisfactory, and the younger men were called upon for suggestions; then young Sealth presented a well laid plan, which was adopted, and he himself was appointed leader of the expedition."<br>
<br>
He was to take with him a large number of warriors who were to ambush themselves at a bend in the River and wait for the canoes<br>
<br>
of the enemy as they came down.  This he did.  To further facili-
tate his plan a large tree was cut down and placed across the river just beyond the bend so as not to be visible to the oncoming canoes.<br>
<br>
Then his warriors waited.  Presently several large canoes of the enemy came down with the current, unaware of the danger.  They swiftly made the bend and came suddenly on the log which was to obstruct their passage.  As was expected, the canoes plunged into the log and the occupants were cast into the stream and there were
quickly set upon by Seattle's warriors and slain.<br>
<br>
Their companions further up stream heard their cries and made for the shore where they hastily debarked and spread the woeful intelligence of the disaster to their people, with -the result that the premeditated attack was abandoned.<br>
<br>
Seattle was victorious and after returning he was chosen head chief of the six tribes.  So far as known this leadership was never afterward questioned.<br>

<br>
The chief of these closely allied tribes was Seattle (or Sealth) after whom the city was named.  He was born at the Old Man House on the Port Madison Reservation about the year 1790, the son of a Suquamish father named Schweabe and a Duwamish princess Scholitza.<br>
<br>
He is described as large in size, dignified in appearance, generous, kind, and unassuming, yet courageous and fearless in the face of danger.  It is said that he acquired his high position among the various tribes and bands by a clever display of diplomacy.<br>
<br>
When he was in prime of his manhood, intelligence was brought to his people that the Indians in the White and Black River regions were planning an excursion against the Old Man House tribes.  A meeting was quickly called and the sentiments of the warriors heard.  Finally Seattle presented his plan and it was accepted.<br>
<br>
He was to take with him a large number ofwarriors who were to ambush themselves at a bend in the Black River and wait for the canoes of the enemy as they came down.  This he did.  To further facilitate his plan a large tree was cut down and placed across the rivir just beyond the bend so as not to be visible to the oncoming canoes.<br>
<br>
Then his warriors waited.  Presently several large canoes of the enemy came down with the current, unaware of the danger.  They swiftly made the bend and came suddenly on the log which was to obstruct their passage.  As was expected, the canoes plunged into
the log and the occupants were cast into the stream and there quickly set upon by Seattle's warriors and slain.<br>
<br>
Their companions further up stream heard their cries and made for the shore where they hastily debarked and spread the woeful intelligence of the disaster to their people, with the result that the premeditated attack was abandoned.<br>
<br>
Seattle was quickly proclaimed chief of his peoples.  He then prepared to make his authority known and respected among the tribes which sought to attack his peoples, and by other displays of diplomacy backed by show of force soon overshadowed all the  chiefs  in that region and became their recognized leader.<br>

<br>
BATTLE OF SEATTLE.<br>
<br>
The rumors were worrisome, but worse for Dr. David Swinson Maynard and the friendly Indians (at Suquamish) was knowing that something important was happening and not knowing the details. On January 25 1856, the Active steamed past the reservation, headed north.  A canoe went out and brought word that Governor Stevens was aboard.  He was optimistic.  Seattle was in no more danger from the Indians than New York was.  The warship Decatur with a complement of Marines was there, and a troop of volunteers had just come in from the blockhouse on the Duwamish.<br>
<br>
The latter had come to be discharged, their three months' enlistments having expired.  None of them was willing to sign up again, but they were in town and probably would fight if the Indians attacked only the Indians wouldn't attack.  They'd all gone back into the Mountains.   There weren't any hostiles within miles.  He was sure of it.<br>
<br>
When Maynard awoke the next morning, January 26, the sky was overcast but there was no rain.  Clouds stretched low over the gray water.  As he walked along the damp, steel-gray beach, his eyes fixed on the point where Seattle would be visible on a clear day, Maynard heard the rumble of distant thunder.  Strange, thunder is rare on Puget Sound and never comes on a gray day.<br>
<br>
But again the boom rolled across the water, and Maynard recognized it as the sound of artillery, Seattle was having visitors.  The visitors were welcome enough to be given a salute, or unwelcome enough to be fired upon.  Reinforcements or Indians?<br>
<br>
The howitzer sounded intermittently.  Straining to hear, Maynard thought  he could make out the crackle of small arms.<br>
<br>
Some of the Indians who joined him on the beach thought  so  too.  Seattle was under attack.<br>
<br>
For Maynard the day of January 26, 1856,  was perhaps the longest in his life.  He could not cross the Sound to see what was happening; Suquamish was his post.  Indians volunteered to go, but he could not send them; his job was to keep the Indians on the west shore.  He could only wait.  All day the rumble of the howitzer droned across the water, and at night there was the distant glow of burning buildings.<br>
<br>
The next morning the news that reached Maynard was not bad.  Shortly after Governor Stevens had sailed from the town, a party of hostiles crossed Lake Washington in canoes and slipped into the forest east of Seattle. 
Friendly Indians, who had been permitted to remain in Seattle, warned the whites of their presence and sentries patrolled the town.  Nothing happened.  In the morning, acting on a tip relayed from an Indian to Henry Yesler to the commander of the Decatur the Marines lobbed a howitzer shell into the woods above the town.  The Indians fired back.<br>
<br>
The settlers rushed from their cabins to the protection of the blockhouse.  The volunteers formed ranks.  The Marines opened up with small arms and the howitzer.  As a battle, though, it wasn't much.  The Indians made no attempt to storm the stockade, and none of the whites-not the settlers, not the discharged volunteers (some of whom declined to shoulder arms at all), not even the Marines saw any sense in charging across the open fields to get at the enemy in the forest.<br>
<br>
The battle raged, in a manner of speaking, throughout the day: the Indians maneuvering behind the cover of the dark forest, firing down into the village, the settlers replying frugally with small arms, the Marines alternating volleys of gunfire with shots from the howitzer.  Both sides paused for dinner, the Indians off the settlers' livestock, the Marines going aboard the Decatur for mess, the settlers eating whatever their wives brought them.<br>
<br>
They all came back for a few twilight shots.  Before calling it a night the Indians set fire to two houses outside the stockade.<br>
<br>
In the morning the Marines were prepared for some more long range fighting, but the Indians had disappeared.  They never returned. It had been a safe fight for the cautious Marines and the invisible Indians, but a fourteen-year-old boy and a young volunteer who neglected to stay under cover were shot dead; no one who remained inside the stockade was wounded.<br>
<br>
As for the Indians, no one knew-or knows.  When Maynard learned of the battle he was told that two thousand Indians had joined in the attack, that more than a hundred were killed, another hundred wounded; but not so much as a single body was found, nor even a sign of blood.  It is possible that the Indians left the battle a undamaged as the Marines.<br>
<br>
The settlers suffered greatly as a result of the war.  Many who lived outside the town lost their houses.  After the attack they did not want to return to the valleys: the war might be over, but did the Indians know it?<br>

THE BATTLE OF SEATTLE<br>
<br>
Gordon Newell, "The Battle of Seattle," <B>Totem Tales of Old Seattle.</B> Seattle: Superior, 1956, p.21-26.<br>
<br>
The year 1853 brought important changes to Seattle.  A year before the place had been Duwamps in Thurston County and its mail had been delivered to "Olympia, Oregon".  It cost an extra twenty-five cents to have a letter brought down by the weekly canoe express.  By the end of the year the address had become Seattle, King County, Washington.<br>
<br>
The country north of the Columbia River had become a separate territory and there was word that a territorial governor was on his way out from the East, surveying the route of a transcontinental railway as he came.<br>
<br>
In January David Denny and Louisa Boren were married in the evergreen decked cabin which the bridegroom had built with his own hands on his claim out north of town.  Radiant and lovely, as befitted Seattle's first bride, Louisa planted sweetbriar seeds, brought across the plains from home, around the cabin door and so Seattle got it's first flower garden, too.<br>
<br>
The new territory boomed and Seattle boomed right along with it.  Town lots studded with buge stumps and bordered by muddy trails began to sell for as much as two hundred dollars in hard money.  Arthur Denny and Carsen Boren filed the first official plat of the city of Seattle on May 23, 1853.  Doc Maynard had a plat of his own, but he staged a memorable drunk to celebrate the birth of the new territory and didn't get around to filing his plat until the next day.<br>
<br>
Denny and Boren had laid out their streets parallel with the shoreline, but Doc Maynard was still the rugged individualist.  He laid out his streets to conform with the points of the compass.  The two plats met at Henry Yesler's sidd road, but there was no meeting of minds between the platters.  Doc was @ring up by easy stages and, as Denny asserted later, he was still carrying a sufficient head of steam to be convinced that be was not only master of all he surveyed, but of all Denny and Boren had surveyed as well -<br>
<br>
That argument hasn't been settled to this day.  The jog is sdu there where those two plats came together.  North of Yesler Way the streets follow the original Elliott Bay beach; south of the old skid road they followed a compass course.  And the original argument has been immortalized in the ever increasing snarl of
traffic where all those mixed-up streets run into Yesler Way.<br>
<br>
Traffic was no problem in 1853, however.  Transportation was by what the pioneers caged "Shank's Mare and Siwash Buggy", although that year of progress did bring the city its first wheeled transportation and its first steamboat.  Tom Mercer brought his four motherless little girls to Seattle along with a wagon, a team of horses and a friend named Dexter Horton.<br>
<br>
The whole town turned out to hack a wagon road through the woods to the claim Mercer staked on the lake called Tenas Chuck by the Indians-Lake Union in later years.  It was Seattle's first road, built to accommodate the first wagon, so it was built narrow, but the settlers figured it was a step in the right direction.<br>
<br>
Dexter Horton got a job at the new sawmill that was being built across the bay at Port Gamble.  His wife joined him there to cook for the workmen, and when they made their stake they came back to Seattle to open a general store with the town's first bank as a sideline.  Dexter Horton had an imposing iron safe, the only one in town, so everyone banked with him and sighed with refief when they saw their slim sacks of money stowed safely inside the iron monster.<br>
<br>
Banker Horton never worried about forgetting the combination to the town vault.  If he did he would only have to go around behind.  He had picked the safe up cheap because it didn't have any back.  But a good front is the important thing in financial matters and the safe had that.  Dexter Horton prospered and became one of the West's most famous bankers.  The backless safe was the beginning of the Seattle First National Bank, the largest in the Northwest.<br>
<br>
In addition to all the other gifts, the year 1853 brought a governor to newly formed Washington Territory.  Major Isaac I. Stevens was a New EngJander, small and peppery and fall of very big ideas.  He was making plans for a transcontinental railroad to connect his new territory with the rest of the United States and he was making plans to extinguish the Indians' claims to all the land in Washington Territory except such reservations as might be alloted to them.  His railroad plans were badly tangled in governmental red tape, but he had full authority to act as Indian agent for a quick deal with the original owners of the Northwest country.<br>
<br>
Stevens didn't believe in wasting time.  He gave himself a month to cover the vast region west of the Cascades and north of the Columbia.  He figured it would take the full four weeks to visit the thirty-odd Indian tribes, and a few minutes to "learn their needs" and place a valuation on their lands.
In the course of this whirlwind tour of the frontier the little governor stopped off at the village of Seattle to address the Indian population from the front door of Doc Maynard's log cabin drug store.  He told them bow much he loved Indians and how much the Great White Father at Washington Ioved Indians ... so much that they were going to buy the Indians' land and move them to nice comfortable reservations *here they would enjoy all the blessings of civilization including free vegetable seeds from the Department of Agriculture.<br>
<br>
During the meeting the Indians swigged contentedly from jugs of blackstrap molasses provided by the government while the governor and his party nipped with equal enthusiasm from jugs which probably did not contain molasses.<br>
<br>
The governor's love for Indians wore a little thin toward the close of the meeting when Chief Seattle took over the show.  The chief executive was sensitive about his lack of height.  Old Seattle towered a good foot above him and he didn't improve the governor's temper by putting the palm of his hand on the little man's head and keeping it there while he made a long and strong oration.<br>
<br>
The governor is reported to have looked pained while this was going on . . . possibly because having Chief Seattle's hand on top of his head made him uncomfortable; possibly because Seattle made a better oration.<br>
<br>
It ended up " . . . At night when the streets of your cities and villages are silent and you think them deserted, they will throng with the hosts that once filled and still love this beautiful land.  The White Man will never be alone.  Let him be just and deal kindly with my people, for the dead are not powerless.  Dead, did I say? There is no death, only a change of worlds'.<br>
<br>
That was in the early spring of 1854.  Shortly thereafter Mr. Stevens went hurtling back East to fight with Jefferson Davis over the route of his proposed transcontinental railway.  For some reason Mr. Davis wanted it to run down south instead of over the northern route Stevens had picked out.  Aware that he wasn't getting anywhere in that hassle, the governor was back again in November, all set to start moving Indians to reservations without any further delay.<br>
<br>
He began turning out treaties the way they turn out mass produced automobiles in Detroit, but with one important difference.  There's a lot of planning behind a Detroit production line.  There wasn't enough planning behind Stevens' high-speed treaty making.  Tribal chiefs were rushed through the ceremony of signing away their
peoples' birthright and by the time the Indians began to realize what had happened to them the governor was miles away collecting other tribal signatures.  And so the little govemor scurried about happily, unaware that a storm of savage indignation was gathering in his wake.<br>
<br>
The Indian War began east of the Cascade Mountains during the summer of 1855 while Governor Stevens was sfir busily making treaties.  The Horse Indians began taking pot-shots at prospectors and one thing led to another.  After a while the U. S. Cavalry was called out.<br>
<br>
The summer passed quietly west of the mountains, but in September the Muckleshoot Tribe raided an isolated homestead in the White River Valley.  The Muckleshoots had been thrown out of their traditional river homes and were to be moved into reservations with the salt water tribes.  The Muckleshoots remembered the terrific beating Chief Seattle and his boys had given them when they came down the river in their war canoes and they had good reason to believe that the performance would be repeated if they were forced to move in with their traditional enemies.<br>
<br>
The White River Valley settlers soon had enough of paint-smeared and warwhooping Muckleshoots.  They abandoned their claims and fled to Seattle.  Things were beginning to look serious.  The citizens diverted a cargo of squared timbers for shipment to California and used it to build a blockhouse.  While it was being built the town enjoyed its first visit from the United States Navy.<br>
<br>
The sloop-of-war Decatur had come across from Honolulu under orders to "cruise the coast of Oregon and California for the protection of settlers".  The skipper had fortunately allowed enough leeway in his orders to include Puget Sound in his cruise.  The Decatur made her headquarters at Seattle.  Stevens was in the Rocky Mountains by then, palavering with the Blackfeet while previous treaties were blowing sky-high behind him.  Acting governor Mason kept urging the Decatur's skipper to go on about his business.  He suspected that Seattle's founding fathers wanted the Navy in port for the purpose of providing trade for theit stores rather than to defend them from Indians.<br>
<br>
He couldn't convince the captain, but he did talk the White River settlers into returning to their claims.  Arthur Denny tried to talk them out of it.  He was getting private information from Chief Patkanim of the Snoqualmies, and what Patkanim said in effect was, "Stick close to the blockhouse, friend.  All hell's going to bust loose before long".<br>
<br>
The settlers went home at the urging of the acting governor.  In
October they were all killed but three children who were smuggled down the Duwamish River to Elliott Bay in the canoe of a friendly Indian.  At Seattle the founding fathers formed a militia company and started for the White River Valley.  The marauding Indians were gone, but they had left the mutilated bodies of the white settlers, all except those who had been cremated in their burning cabins.<br>
<br>
The volunteers buried the dead and returned to Seattle, more than a little thankful that they hadn't met up with the hostiles.  Half the party's rifles were museum pieces that couldn't be fired and had been taken along only for appearance's sake.  The blockhouse looked mighty good to them when they got back.<br>
<br>
Seattle was attacked by the Indians on January 26, 1856, and the Decatur, which had been around all winter, almost failed to get into the show.  While cruising off Bainbridge Island earlier in the month she had draped herself ungracefully across a then uncharted reef.  On modern charts it's marked Decatur Reef in memory of that historic event.<br>
<br>
The Decatur was somewhat rotten and decrepit at best and the stranding almost finished her off.  She did, however, manage to wallow across the bay and beach herself on the mudflats by Yesler's wharf.  The old girl had to be practically rebuilt from the waterline up.  Her crew worked feverishly, day and night, while Indians gathered in the woods between Lake Washington and the town to whoop and screech and keep everyone awake nights.  There were false alarms every night, some of them quite realistic.<br>
<br>
On the night of January eighteenth the town was aroused by a woman's piercing scream and the loud report of a gun.  Lieutenant Arthur Denny, in his nightshirt, led his volunteers to the blockhouse while the marines formed a hne of skirmishers.  After a while it was found that the Indians weren't involved.  A sailor from the beached Decatur had tried to enter the bedroom of a village maiden by way of the window.<br>
<br>
The young lady had awakened and, with the piercing screech which had so alarmed her neighbors, slammed the sash down, pinning the unfortunate seaman half in and half out.  Her 15-year old brother had come running in response to her screams and proceeded to shoot the intruder through the head with a large charge of buckshot.<br>
<br>
A few days later the comic opera aspects of the Battle of Seattle began working toward a climax.  Into Elliott Bay steamed the survey ship Active with Governor Stevens aboard.  He was back from the Blackfoot treaties and he still wasn't wasting any time.  He came ashore and made a speech to the assembled citizens of Seattle. I say to you". he concluded, "that there are not fifty hostile
Indians in this whole territory, and I believe that New York and San Francisco will as soon be attacked by the Indians as the town of Seattle".<br>
<br>
Then he scuttled off to the Decatur to try to talk the skipper into abandoning Seattle and going with him on a cruise to Bellingham Bay.  Getting no response from either plea, he returned to the Active in a fine rage and departed without further delay.  While the Active was then in sight in the bay, friendly Indians began coming into town looking for protection.  They reported that large hands of hostiles had already crossed Lake Washington and were taking up positions for an attack on the town.<br>
<br>
From here on it's not easy to pick truth from fiction.  A cherished legend of Seattleites to this day has it that Princess Angeline, the daughter of Chief Seattle, crossed the bay in a dugout during a terrible storm to warn the city fathers of the impending attack.  Another version has it that Doc Maynard's wife made the hazardous voyage disguised as a load of clams.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Phelps, the Decatur's navigating officer, left the only written account of the proceedings, a highly imaginative document which critics have charged was written to divert attention from the navigation which resulted in his ship's stranding.  It makes interesting reading even if it is fiction, but Seattle's pioneers didn't appreciate it.  According to Phelps they were all cowardly yokels who were saved, in spite of themselves, by the U. S. Navy.<br>
<br>
With all the warnings, real and imaginary, the citizens of the village were caught by surprise when the actual attack began.  Most of them were eating breakfast in their cabins when the Decatur's howitzers began firing over their heads into the woods behind the town.  The broadside was followed by much screeching from unseen Indians and the rattle of musketry.  The population of Seattle abandoned breakfast and made a mass evacuation to the blockhouse.  It was fast but orderly.<br>
<br>
David Denny's pretty wife, Louisa, was alone in their cabin at the edge of town with her two-year old baby.  She had biscuits in the oven and when the firing began she scooped the hot biscuits into her apron with one hand, tucked the baby firmly under the other arin and was on her way to the blockhouse without a wasted second or a lost biscuit.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Hanford had three small children to handle, but ber mother, Mrs. Ehzabeth Holgate had taught her that a pioneer lady must cope with emergencies in a dignified manner; furthermore, Mrs. Holgate had always set an example.  Once when riding in a canoe which was
swamped in a storm Mrs. Holgate had gained fame by remaining in it in an upright position with her bonnet firmly in place, apparently drifting ashore supported by nothing but water.  On another occasion a large tree fell on her cabin, almost completely wrecking it.<br>
<br>
When horrified rescuers hacked their way in they found Mrs. Holgate calmly cooking dinner on the stove, which was practically the only thing in the cabin that had escaped destruction.  Mrs. Hanford was a true daughter of Mrs. Holgate and she retired in good order with a small child under each arm.  Her well trained son, Cornelius, who later became a noted judge, moved under his own power, but his training was almost too good.  He returnd to close the front door and was chased from the yard by a large Indian who rose suddenly from behind a log.<br>
<br>
Out on the other side of town a Virginia gentleman with the romantic name of Hillory Butler was unable to find his pants.  The way things sounded there was no time to look for them, so he made a dramatic entry at the blockhouse wearing his wife's red flannel petticoat.  David Denny did only a little better.  He snagged the seat of his homespun breeches as he tore through the brush and seemed more concerned with finding a secluded spot in which to repair the embarassing damage than in fighting Indians.  Children dived in between the legs of marines and militiainen, frequently bringing them down with loud crashes.  There were a few wild shots fired as a result, but no one was killed.<br>
<br>
Fortunately the population was small and by the time the Indians had their muskets reloaded everyone was in the blockhouse or at least out of range and traveling too fast to hit.<br>
<br>
Young Milton Holgate was in the blockhouse with the fowling piece that had protected his sister's honor a few nights before.  He decided to try it out on an Indian.  As he reached the doorway he received a bullet between the eyes.  Later in the day a volunteer named Wilson made the same mistake with the same fatal result.  Those were the only known casualties of the Battle of Seattle.<br>
<br>
The Decatur's shells were disconcerting to the Indians.  They had delayed action fuses which caused them to lie on the ground for a few seconds before exploding.  The Indians said they mox poohed-fired twice-and they didn't like it. After a while they found that they had fired most of their own ammunition.  They withdrew to have dinner and never really came back.  The Battle of Seattle was over, but the citizens didn't know it for a day or two.  Even then they kept expecting another attack, but it never caine.<br>
<br>
The legend makers took over as soon as the shooting stopped. 
Lieutenant PheIps reported that hundreds of Indians had come whooping across the sawdust pile at Yesler's mill to fire volleys at him and his men at a distance of tweitty feett Although their clothing was riddled with bullet holes none of them were scratched.  He didn't say whether or not they suffered from powder bums.<br>
<br>
Others solemnly asserted that they had seen Chief Seattle at the height of the battle performing a war dance on a sandspit in the bay.<br>
<br>
The last shot of the Battle of Seattle was fired many years later.  Gardner Kellogg, pioneer Seattle fire chief, had saved one of the Decatur's cannon balls as a souvenir.  A quarter of a century or so later he was clearing stumps on his farm at the edge of town and decided to make use of the cannon ban.  He rolled it into the fire which was burning under the largest of the stumps and went home for lunch.<br>
<br>
Dexter Horton, grown portly and prosperous as the town banker, then appeared on the scene.  He was taking a noontime stroll and the fire looked good to him.  He backed up to it and spread his coattails.  The Decatur's shell warmed up at approidmately the same time as the banker's backside.  It mox poohed suddenly, blowing the stump in one direction and the banker in the other.<br>
<br>
Banker Horton landed in a bramble patch with only his dignity seriously injured.  Even the last shot of the Battle of Seattle was relatively harmless.<br>

Arthur A. Denny had previously told Captain Sterrett of the Decatur that he believed in the friendship of Patkanim.  On that account the Captain sen' for Mr. Denny and told him' he thought he ought to
arrest the Snoqualmies that very night.<br>
<br>
"This was startling news to me," says Mr. Denny, "and most earnestly protested, telling him that I knew Lieutenant Slaughter was mistaken, and that we had enemies enough to look after without attacking our friends; but he was so much disposed to act on Governor Masons orders that I finally  endorsed, if he would not disturb the Snoqualmies, I would be responsible for their good conduct, and would prove to him that Slaughter was wrong, by going to Pat Kanim's camp and bringing him in.<br>
<br>
"He very positively refused to allow me to leave town, but consented that I might send an express for Pat Kanim, and stand responsible for them until their return having a time agreed upon within which they would be back.  Very fortunately for me, and probably for Pat Kanim too, he was on hand within the time agreed upon.<br>
<br>
"He had his women and children with him, and also brought a cargo of mountain sheep, venison, horses (horns] and hides, specimens of which he took on board and presented to the Captain, who expressed the greatest surprise and satisfaction with e conclusive proof, which I had thus fumished, of the good faith and friendship of the Snoqualmies.<br>
<br>
"I never heard anything more from headquarters of the hostile Snoqualmies, but Pat Kanim was very soon employed by the Govemor with a party of his tribe, as scouts and did good service during the continuance of the war."<br>
<br>
To this day the Snoqualmie are proud of Mr. Denny's championship of their cause at that critical time.  They love the name Of Denny.  That is why an interpreter at the recent memorial exercises turned every sentence of Mrs. Florence Denny Heliker's address into the Snoqualmie tongue so that every one of the Indians would understand.<br>

BATTLE OF SEATTLE.<br>
<br>
"Seattle's first taste of Battle, 1856," <B>Pacific Northwest Quarterly.</B> XLVII (January, 1956) p. 1-8.<br>
<br>
Settlers and soldiery slept uneasily in the small communities along Puget Sound as the year 1856 opened.  Many of the Indians were hostile, and various instances of violence had been reported.  Governor Stevens had removed the friendly Indians across the Sound and ordered the scattered population into blockhouses where they could be given better protection.<br>
     
At Seattle, James Alden and Guert Gansevoort, commanding naval vessels assigned to the Sound, discussed the strategy of the Indian war and argued unpleasantly among themselves as to whether the greater show of strength should be at Steilacoom or Elliott Bay Captain Hewitt's company of volunteers, recruited on a shortterm period of enlistment, had been disbanded, and while the men were still in town, the place had no organized defenses save the divisions and marines under Gansevoort's command. Times were tense, and the townsfolk were restless and disturbed.<br>
<br>
Such was the setting for the Indian attack on Seattle, January 26, 1856.  It seems appropriate, now that one hundred years have passed,to take particular notice again of the engagement.  PNQ presents, therefore, a few contemporary documents that make clear the sense of danger, report some of the circumstances of the battle, and suggest the significance of it as an incident in the struggle to establish the terms of peace between Indians and whites.<br>
<br>
Three different viewpoints are represented. David Blaine, a young Methodist minister, and his wife Catherine were trying to establish a church in Seattle and found it impossible to carry on their work there so long as the Indian menace continued. Guert Gansevoort, commanding officer of the Decatur, saw the battle as a participant and reported it in his official capacity.<br>
<br>
William Heebner wrote as one of the settlers in the vicinity who knew a good bit about the battle, though not at first hand, and was able to judge the importance of it in its relation to the migration of population into the area.<br>
<br>

<br>
Seattle, Dec. 1st, 1855.<br>
<br>
And so another winter has begun.  How time flies! Two years last Wednesday since we landed in Seattle, strangers, homeless and alone.  How different our circumstances now! We are this evening seated in our own little parlor-study-sitting room, or whatever else you may choose to call it, for it serves all the above purposes, at least.  The floor is covered with my rag carpet, which, by the way, is pretty, and the room throughout, though very plain, has an air of comfort that makes it an inviting place to us.<br>
<br>
Mr. Blaine is sitting at his library making preparations for his duties tomorrow, and I arn seated at a table near bim iri a cane or willow chair of Chinese manufacture, present from a captain whose vessel is engaged in trade with China.  I find it quite an improvement on the hard, wooden chairs, which as yet form the only
seats we have, besides this.<br>
<br>
Our room is warmed by a sheet iron stove which, if designed to be air tight, is not, neither has it much comeliness of appearance, but it performs its duties as far as im arting warmth is concerned.  Although   our   little   room   is   so   comfortable   and pleasant, I should very much like to exchange it for a place in your sitting room.<br>
<br>
The unpleasant situation of Indian affairs renders it so disagreeable.  It is impossible to tell what is in store for us, but certainly there never was a time in the settlement of any part r of the country when things presented a more serious aspect than now.  There seems to be such general cooperation among the different tribes whose former enmity to each other had secured safety to the whites.<br>
<br>
We have sent you several papers from which, if you have received them, you will perceive that those Indians who have committed these hostilities are not a whit behind the savages who formerly inhabited the Atlantic side, in barbarity. indeed, the inhumanity of these cannot be surpassed.  I will send you a paper giving an account of the murders up White River.  As yet, we have been unmolested in the towns, but many of our citizens wbo have gone out against them have fallen.<br>
<br>
The Indians sustain but trifling losses as they have so decided an advantage in numbers and in their knowledge of the country, by which they are enabled to retreat to their hiding places after they have committed their depredations.  Until our numbers are greatly increased it will be impossible to hunt them out and punish them as they deserve.<br>
<br>
We are now feeling some anxiety about a company of about 50 volunteers who left here last Tuesday to proceed up White River a few miles above the scene of the slaughter and there prepare their winter quarters.  There are three other companies within a few miles of that place and it is designed that they will act in concert.  Last night an express reached us from Steilacoom with a dispatch to the capt@in of our company to remain in a place of security until he should get further orders as one of the companies had been attacked Wednesday night on three sides, had all their horses taken and sustained other damage.<br>
<br>
The word was sent up to him with all possible speed, but we fear it may be too late, as they would be likely to be in a place where they could not defend themselves from sudden attack.  We shall be likely to hear from them in a day or two.  The day before they left the ladies presented them with a very bandsome flag and gave them a supper in the evening.<br>
<br>
Their absence, together with that of the Decatur, the sloop of war, has made town seem rather lonely.  We expect the Decatur back
tonight or tomorrow.  We shall feel much safer when she gets here.  There are scouts kept out in the woods during the day to watch for Indians and we have guards posted in different parts of the town nights to give alarm if they approach.<br>
<br>
There were three false alarms made last night, one we did not hear, and for the other two I did not get out of bed.  Mr. Blaine went to the door and listened until he was assured there was nothing to it, and then came to bed.  I try to keep as cool as I can about the whole matter, and think I succeed pretty well, considering everything, but I cannot belp thinking about these matters much more than I want to.  I hope the consequences will not be bad.....<br>

<br>
U.     S. Sloop "Decatur" off Seattle W. Territory January 31, 1856<br>
<br>
Sir,<br>
<br>
I had the honor to address you, a communication under date of the 18th inst. from this place advising you of what action I had taken in relation to public matters under my control, up to that time, and forwarding copies of a communication from Commander James Alden of the Coast Survey Steamer "Active" dated i anuary 15th lS56, a copy of a communication from him addressed to the Navy Department, dated U.S. Steamer "Active" Olympia Jany. 12, 1856 and the copy of another from Captain E. D. Keyes U.S. Army under date Jany. 12, 1856.<br>
<br>
This communication with its enclosures was despatched to Port Townsend on the same day and delivered into the hands of the Captain of the Barque "Leoness", bound to San Francisco, to be mailed there, which vessel sailed the next day.<br>
<br>
On the 19th January the repairs on this vessel being sufficiently completed outboard I hauled her out into the Bay, in sufficient water to move her head and stern, and proceeded with all possible despatch to make her as efficient as possible, and in all respects ready for sea.<br>
<br>
While this work was progressing as rapidly as could be expected, I received information on the afternoon of the 25th that a large num-
ber of Indians, had crossed Lake Washington, about one mile and a quarter to the northward of Seattle for the purpose of attacking this place, and they might come in that night.  I immediately ordered the fighting divisions with their small arms on shore; the 1st Division under Lieut.  Drake was stationed at the south part of the town.  
The 2nd division under Lieut.  Hughes armed with rifles and carbines occupied a store about a square to the northward of Mr. Drake's position.  The 3rd Division, Lieut.  Phelps armed with muskets held a position in front of Mr. Yesler's house at the head of the wharf where the boats landed.  The 4th Division with muskets, rifles and pistols in the house of a Mr. Plummer at the extreme south east part of the Town.<br>
<br>
The Howitzer under Lieut.  Morris with nine men and a number of marines to guard it, was placed across the street from Lieut.  Hughes' position.  The remaining number of marines under the command of the Sergeant and posted at the Block House (which contains two nine pounder guns) at the north end of the Town.<br>
Sentries were stationed in the most conspicuous positions, and the several posts visited by me several times during the night.<br>
<br>
The next morning at daylight, every thing baving remained quiet during the night a little after 6 o'clock I ordered the divisions to fall back one on the other, commencing at the outermost post and move towards the boats, where they embarked and returned to the 
ship at about 30 past 7 <B>A.M.<br>
<br>

</B>In about half an hour after our return, Mr. Yesler came on board and communicated to me, that he had learned from a private source which was worthy of all attention, that the Indians were just in the edge of the woods, close to the Town, and pointed out the positions they had taken up.  They were in three parts extending over a space of about two miles, just in the rear of the town, the largest portion being at the extreme S. East, with a marsh of about 125 yards intervening.<br>
<br>
I immediately determined to attack this point, and having ordered all the divisions to land at once, took up the following positions with those under my command.<br>
<br>
First division was stationed on the East Bank of the marsh on a rising ground, and near the center.  The second division on the left of the first and near the Elliott House.  Thethird Division in front of Mr. Yesler's House, at the bead of the wharf (the boat landing).  The 4th occupied the same position as it did the night before.  The Howitzer took a position to the right of the First division.  The rest of the marines at the Block House.<br>
<br>
Every thing being ready, I pointed the Howitzer to a certain point on the opposite side of the marsh, where it was supposed the Indians were concealed and then gave the order to "Fire." . is was immediately done, and at once followed by a sh(11 from the ship's Battery under command of Lieut.  Middleton, the executive officer, which fell in the same direction.<br>
<br>
This was followed by a loud bowl from the Indians, who rushed to
the edge of the woods, when a general discharge of small arms took place on both sides.  This continued without intermission for about half an hour accompanied with frequent discharges from the howitzer and shells from the ship.  This steady and determined firing caused a part of the Indians to remove further to the northward, doubtless with the intention of making an attack on the north end of the Town, which proved to be correct, for after a short time a sharp and steady fire was poured in by the Indians from that point and directly down upon the wharf where the boats had landed, which was most spiritedly returned by Lieut.  Phelps' Division, and the marines at the Block House.<br>
<br>
This firing continued very smartly for some two bours, at short intervals, the howitzer and Divisions stationed on the East bank of the marsh, opening their fire, whenever the Indians made their appearance on the opposite side.  This continued until about 3 P.m. when finding that the fire of the enemy was reduced to a few scattered shots, I determined to withdraw the men and repair on board the ship for the purpose of affording some rest and refreshment tO mY officers and crew who had been on active duty for 24 hours and over six hours under fire.<br>
<br>
This was done with the knowledge that the ship's Battery commanded the Town and was executed promptly, &c.<br>
<br>
The Indians in that vicinity, opened a smart fire, which was soon silenced by two discharges from the bowitzer, and a running fire of musketry, when the howitzer was transported into the Launch and all embarked (with the exception Of the marines left to guard the Block House) and returned to the Ship.<br>
<br>
The firing from the Indians continued some time after ibis, but was eventually silenced by throwing a round shot at every point from which this fire was directed.<br>
<br>
On the morning of the 27tb inst. a shot was thrown at the place where the Indians were last seen on the evening of the 26th, but no notice was taken of it, and it was reported by one of the friendly Indians here that the enemy had moved up the White River, a distance of about four miles.<br>
<br>
On the Divisions returning on board all the women and children came on board the Ship, and were accommodated as far as possible in the Cabin and Ward Room, the officers giving up their apartments to them, and making them as comfortable as circumstances would admit of.<br>
<br>
The engagement lasted about six hours, the first discharge from the

Howitzer which commenced it, was at <B>4' </B>before nine and the divisions were drawn off at 3 P.m.<br>
<br>
During the firing two houses were burned, one at each extreme, occupied by the Indians, they setting fire to one, and the other was fired by a shell from the howitzer.<br>
<br>
It affords me much pleasure to bear testimony to the gallant and energetic behaviour of the officers and men on this occasion, wbo although they had been out for several nights at this inclement season, obeyed every order promptly and with the greatest alacrity.<br>
Since the evening of the 26th but few stragglers of Indians have been seen although there were reports yesterday of their tracks having been seen in this neighborhood.<br>
<br>
I am informed this morning by the chief of a friendly tribe, that he thinks a great many have been killed, and that they are very much alarmed at the effect of the shells, and it is the impression that they have moved off from this neighborhood at any rate for the present.<br>
<br>
I omitted to state in a former paragraph that the only loss sustained on the part of the whites on the 26th was but two volunteers, one shot through the head and the other through<br>
the neck-none wounded.<br>
<br>
I have the honor to be Sir ' Very Respectfully, Your obt.  Servt.<br>
Guert Gansevoort<br>

Tuesday, Jan. 29, 1856.<br>
<br>
I will continue Kate's diary as she is occupied with other matters.  This morning the Indians are said to be within five miles of us, 
but did not disturb <B>Lis </B>through the night.  The steamer, Active, came up from below us with Governor Stevens and other dignitaries on board.  A new company was organized in town, volunteers for present defense, officers elected and stockades commenced in different places to protect the soldiers.<br>

The governor and others say that Seattle must not be given up, else 10,000 men could not subdue the Indians.  It is the key to the Sound and the most vigorous efforts must be made to save it.  The governor asked me for the church to be used as a blockhouse.  I told him to take it and fortify it.  Should this be done we can stay at bome in the day time and sleep in the church nights until we can make some arrangements by which we can get away.<br>
<br>
I took out some thin s, books, boxes, and meats, etc. from the house and placed them in the yard so that if the house is privatelv fired, they will be left.  Last night 10 men 'quartered in the house.  Tonight it is left to run its chances.<br>
<br>
Wednesday.<br>
<br>
No Indians last night, but scouts report them in the woods within three miles of town.  The defenses are progressing.  The steamer, Active, went to Olympia yesterday; came back today.  The steamer, Republic, came up from Califomia today with 250 men for Steilacoom.  It is to return tomorrow.  I had most of the things from our house moved down to the wharf within the barricade.  We stay on the Decatur.<br>
<br>
Kate has not been ashore since the fight on Saturday.  It is reported that some 15 or 16 Indians were killed on Saturday.  Every precautionary step is being taken to resist them if they come again.<br>
<br>
EPortland, somewhat later]<br>
<br>
I suppose you are already in possession of the more important facts related on the preceding page.  It was written the day after our bright eyed boy was born.  I was then intending to finish the sheet and send it by the next mail.  But the Indians came and our plans were broken up, our composure disturbed and our f afety endangered by the clangor of arms.<br>
<br>
I heard the fiendish yell of the savages, the booming of the cannon, the din of war and saw the instruments of death all in operation.  "And sadly I gazed in the face of the dead."<br>
Fearing that the torch of the savages would be applied to our bouse, and not only the results of my toil but our goods would be consigned to the flames, I embraced the first opportunity and made haste to pack up and secure what movables we bad, allowing myself no time for anything else.<br>
<br>
I tumbled my portfolio with other things into a box and nailed them up.  Meanwhile, mail after mail bas departed but the letter has lain in its place. . . .<br>
<br>

The Indians on the Sound are still committing depreciations and from what is known of their plans, they are preparing for a summer campaign somewhat largely.  The people in Olympia are very much afraid that that town will be attacked and are fortifying it.  The whites have lately surprised and taken a camp of Indians a few miles from there, killing eight and taking 18 prisoners, who bad been sent out from the main body to plunder, kill and drive off cattle.<br>
<br>
I received a letter from Seattle this morning from which I learn that the war steamers, Massachusetts and Hancock, the sloop of war Decatur, and the revenue cutter, Jefferson Davis, are now there anchored in line of battle before the town.  A long stockade and three block houses are built and the woods cleared away on a line as far back as the back part of our garden.  Still no citizen dares sleep outside of the stockade.<br>
<br>
A company of regulars bas gone up White River to the place called Pup Skulk, where we went last spring, to build a blockhouse.  The Seattle company is engaged in building a fort at Van Asselt's prairie, some six miles up the river.  There will be some farming done in the vicinity of the blockhouse.  It is reported that the Indians are soon to be largely reinforced from the Yakima country, east Of the mountains, and if this be true, there will be some hard fighting.<br>
<br>
I presume it is better for us to be here than to be in the midst of such excitement and war.  We are getting or, very comfortably and so far as we can judge from appearances, as successfully as could be expected.  Our society is in a cold state, but prospects are slowly brightening, and were it not for this constant war excitement which takes the public attention and embarrasses every other enterprise, we should be quite sanguine in our expectancy of doing much for the cause of Zion here in Portland. . . .<br>
<br>
Portland, March 19, 1856<br>
<br>
We have received no letters from home for more than two months now.  I went to the P.O. this morning expecting to get a mail, but was disappointed.  Our letters have to go to Seattle now and then come back to Portland.  No mail came across this week, probably in consequence of the danger of traveling the route between Olympia and the Columbia.<br>
<br>
We learn that the Indians are becoming more and more bold and that they are doing many acts of cruelty, of which they were heretofore judged incapable.  They have killed some three or more men near Olympia as they were traveling on the road, and they are scattering about in all parts of the country in small bands ready to murder families who are living distant from neighbors, and waylav single persons who happen to be passing from one part of the country to
another.<br>
<br>
The volunteers on the Sound have had several skirmishes with them lately, in which they have driven them back with some loss to the Indians, but it is not believed that any great or decisive battle can be fought this spring or summer, as the Indians can live any-
where in the woods during the warm weather, and will choose to do 
so in preference to remaining <B>in </B>a large body.  If this supposition is correct, the war will be carried on by detached parties all summer, making it unsafe to live near the mountains or back in the country.<br>
<br>
And the whites must be harassed and tormented with fear until winter, when the snow and cold will drive the redskins from the mountains and place them within reach of our forces.<br>
<br>
It is difficult to describe the paralyzing effect of this war upon the prosperity of this country.  In Washington Territory, it has brought business and improvements which were moving on briskly, to a standstill.  In King County there were but two farmers' houses standing outside of Seattle unburned.  The county exists, but in name.<br>
<br>
Pierce County is nearly in the same plight.  All the settlers have moved into Steilacoom.  Thurston County, in which Olympia is situated, has not sustained so much injury, but many houses have been burned and the inhabitants are either out fighting Indians or living in blockhouses.  On Island County it is much as it is in Thurston.  This is down the Sound from Seattle.<br>
<br>
Brother Morse, who was preaching on Whidby Island, has left for the states.  Brother Smith, who was a local preacher there, has brought his family over to Portland.  Brother Devore is still in Olympia, the only Methodist preacher on the Sound.<br>
<br>
By latest account from Seattle there was still a ship of war and steamer lying in the harbor for the protection of the town.  Three families and several single men had left the place and gone to San Francisco or other places before we left.  When we came away I paid a debt against the church of $140.00 and left the trustees unembarrassed.<br>
<br>
I did not feel able to do this, but I had given the man who built the house a verbal promise that he should be paid before I left the place, and as I could not collect any more then, I concluded to advance ,,im it from my own pocket.  There is very little prospect of my getting it back again for several years.  We sold off our cows and some of our furniture at a sacrifice and left the rest in the house.<br>
<br>
The garden I rented for $50.00 and the house for $5.00 a month, as long as it is used, which will not probably be very long.  It cost us $65.00 to come here.  I paid freight on our goods to San
Francisco, $10.00. What they will cost to Portland I cannot tell, but presume not much short of $20.00, making our actual expense in coming here not less than $100.00. Kate has told you how we came in her letter home.<br>
<br>
This will give you some idea of the cost and comfort of travel in this country.  The distance from Seattle is about 200 miles the way we came.  Besides this expense, we sacririced and lost considerably by moving from Seattle, but it seemed the best thing we could do. We had our house and garden and plans will all made for living quite comfortably through means and efforts.<br>
<br>
We could neither live safely in our bouse nor take care of our cows to keep them from the predatory savages, nor carry out our plans.  And if we remained there it must have been not only under exposure, anxiety and great inconvenience, but without being able to accomplish anything for the church, except under the most discouraging and unpropitious circumstances, and very little at that. . . .<br>

Port Madison March 29th 1856 Mr. A. F. Bryant<br>
<br>
Dear Sir<br>
<br>
Yours of 26th of Jan has been duly received I have been somewhat tardy in answering, on account of these exciteing times of war.  Govr.  Stevens has returned safe, though there is no prospects of an early peace. it seams you have heard of the death of Lieutenant Slaughter, which occured at Brannan's place there was two others killed and two mortaly wounded.<br>
<br>
On the 26th of Jan the Indians attacked Seattle with the suppose number of 700 they crossed the big Lake the dav previous t.o the attack. they fired all day on the town from the edge of the woods. the sloop of war fired bombs all day until 11 o'clock at night when the indians retired. the indians killed two whites the little Holgate boy and Bob Wilson the boy was standing in the fort door the other was in the act of going Etol Simon's house the indians shot well.<br>
<br>
It is not known how many indians wete killed as the whites fired from behind the stumps &c in town neither party advanced or retired.  Hewitt's Co bad disbanded 3 days before the attack, therfore there was no commander of the land forces ever one fought or fired in the woods on his own hook the indians had complete possession of the whole country with the exception of Seattle the stock and all which they bave driven offand have killed more than half in this county burned all the buildings on the Duwamish river excepting Stewards house & Jim Groves, and perhaps Eli Marples all the stock that has been saved the indians has brought in town at various times since the attack. there has been another company
organized for six months under Cpt.  Lander though they have not been in the field as yet though there bas been a number of regular soldiers arrived lately who has taken the field they are posted on white & green river building forts they have had some engagements with the enemy of the particulars I have not heard only the soldiers routed the indians in every case they are going to build a fort at dutch Henrys & Mox La Push all the folks is in Seattle in the county what is left, only some is at this mill & port Gamble.  Stewarts has all left for California, Curkland & family Cox Dr Grove and a number of single men 6 weeks ago Joe & Steve Foaer Bob Gardener Lewey Merrilet jef Hunti left for Oregon.<br>
<br>
Fee & Jim Sewart is at work here they talk of going to California on the vessel (Madonna) now here Cpt Boyd said he has written you and directed to Volcano.  I told him where you was I think h'e wishes to enter, your claim as you and he was talking of times will be good bere during this war for young men without families.<br>
<br>
Jim Grove is here I think we will have a large number of the Seattle inhabitants if the indians is not soon settled they all talk of comming over here as there is nothing doing at Seattle but soldierizing and that will not pay for a man of a family.  Joe Foster cleared about $500 packing before he left.  I think be will not be back until the close of the war on this side of the mountains I think he is packing at the Dalles.<br>
<br>

Gen Wool  has been here and has gone to <B>Calia </B>for more troops as he has saw they are more needed on this side of the Cascades.  Governor Stevens has given Pat Canam a commission to take his tribe in the field he has brought 4 heads from Snoquolomie falls,  2 from White River where he engaged Leshhi.<br>
<br>
Mike Simmons & L M. Collins is Pats aides,  Dutch Dave interpreter I think as Gen Wool has made his appearance the war will be conducted right, although they blow him so much in Oregon. He will teach them the rudiments of war Col Casy bas command of the regular forses  on this side of mountains. the Steamer Massachusetts is now laying at Seattle, and there is two or three more expected on the sound soon.<br>
<br>
We are assuming quite a warlike attitude I think we shall soon be able to take charge  of the country and maintain our position. the  indians has their way quite long errough and  rather too long as there has been considerable number of good inhabitance driven out the Territory from pure necessity who will not be apt to retum we consider ourselves still safe as there is no  more likelyhood of an attack than when you left also we are in a better mode of defence let me know how you are doing in the mines.<br>
<br>
I am well acquainted about Auburn California. I have been there for 2 months I worked on grisly bar on the North fork 4 mile<br>
from the town     it is a very pleasant part of the country how are<br>
they doing in the quarts business about grass Valey & Navada citywe will be obliged to get our living from Oregon & California as I
<br>
think there will not be much farming done in this county this year as there is not as much seed left and ther is no move made to build up the houses potatoes are worth $132' per bu and very scarce at that the tame iddians has consumed the greater part of those saved there was a large amount destroyed by the hostile indians.  I would be pleased to have you write often and give me the news.<br>
<br>
I will promise to keep you posted on the same items as far as possible. let me know how the gold business prospers, as I am quite a hand at that branch.  Henry Fee says he will be at Sacramento city in the course of a month he wishes you to write him and direct to Sacramento city let him know where You are and what your doing if he can get anything to do he will come and see you he can give you all the news he is a first rate man to work and a pleasent companion. write soon<br>
<br>
Yours   &c.<br>

John I. King, "The Battle of Seattle," in Ezra Meeker's <B>Pioneer Reminiscences of Puget Sound.</B> Seattle: Lowman and Hanford, 1903, p. 299-300.<br>
<br>
"There was a large two-story block house in Seattle, and a stockade for the protection of the people against attack by the Indians.  This building stood facing the hill back of Seattle, and had a door in the front left-hand corner.  The back of the building faced the bay in front of the town.<br>
<br>
The sloop-of-war Decatur lay in the bay usually.  As was my custom, 
I <B>was </B>ashore nearly all day every day.  On Saturday, January 26, 1856, I came ashore as usual.  A short time after I reached the fort that day the Indians attacked Seattle.<br>
<br>
They were principally upon the hill back of the town. I shall never forget the occasion.  The people sought safety in flight into the fort.  Small arms were being used on shore, and the Decatur was shelling the hill.  The order came to keep clear of the port holes and of the door.<br>
<br>
One young man (a Mr. Holgate, I believe), defied the Indians and disobeyed orders, too, standing in the open door.  In a short time

he was shot in the <B>face.  </B> I was terribly frightened, sick and faint with fear.  I begged and pleaded and insisted on being taken to the Decatur.<br>
<br>
Finally, a small outlet was made at the back of the fort, and, giving my usual signal, a gig came to take me aboard.  One saucy three-inch howitzer was planted on the beach, and the large guns of the Decatur were sending shot and shell over my head, but I preferred the crack of the small brass piece and the roar and boom of the guns to staying in the fort.<br>
<br>
Bullets occasionally dropped near us, but when on shipboard I was well beyond the range of the Indian muskets.  When I came aboard the Decatur, in October, Capt.  Sterrett was in command.  A short time after this he was relieved, and at the time of the attack, in January, 1856, Capt.  Ganzevoort was in command."<br>

BATTLE OF SEATTLE.<br>
<br>
Ezra Meeker, "The Attack on Seattle," <B>Pioneer Reminiscences of Puget Sound.</B> Seattle: Lowman and Hanford, 1903, p.  348-52.<br>
<br>
The impending attack had been known to the inhabitaunts of Seattle several days before it occurred.  Friendly Indians encamped in the town had been approached by their friends in the war camp to enlist their aid, some of whom doubtless lent a willing ear.  The sympathies of all the Indians were with the struggling hostilel<br>
<br>
There can be no question of that although individuals no doubt were true to their particular friends among the whites.  Through this source sevmo leading citizens had notice each by their partiewar favorites who were anxious to save their patrons yet could not withhold their sympathy from their race, and so it became positively known that preparations were made for an attack, but no one could even guess when it would occur.<br>
<br>
So stealthily had the Indian forces been gathered to the near vicinity of the town that on the morning of the 26th, an hour before the outbreak, the marines had gone on board the Decatur with their hammocks and were at breakfast when the lint gun was fired.<br>

The actual fighting (if it may be called fighting) was precipitated by the Decatur dropping a shell in "Tom Pepper's house," where a friendly Indian woman reported the hostiles had gathered.  The house which was in the southern outskirts of the town near the tide flats and on tide level, afforded an opportunity for either an advance or retreat but was not chosen as the particular point of the main attack.<br>
<br>
The town then consisted of a few straggling houses near the water front and two two-story block house. These last had been erected immediately after the outbreak on the 28th of lbetober of the previous year, and were of size suffleient to accommodate the whole population at night, the women and children occupying the upper stories while the men slept or kept guard below.<br>
<br>
So secure did the people feel that there was no danger of an immediate attack that almost all the families occupied their own houses during the night of the 25th, and on the morning of the 26th (of Januaxy, 1856), were either preparing or eating breakfast when the alarm was sounded and the people rushed pell-mell into the block house.<br>
<br>
Captain 0. C. Hewitt's company, seventy-two strong, had been mustered out of the service on the evening of the 25th and had stacked their arms but the men were all in the town, most of them being residents. This force, if organized, would have been sufficient to have defended the block house, but from accounts written at the time a part of the men refused to take up their arms again the next morning and crowded into the block houses ingloriously for safety.<br>
<br>
All of the citizens of the company resumed their guns and went on duty the same as if their discharge had not been granted.<br>
<br>
Gansevoort had ninety men on shore and others on shipboard to man the guns.  At no time was there any danger after the people reached the block house had common, ordinary prudence been observed.  Milton Holgate a lad of sixteen, years, thoughtlessly exposed himself at the northern block house door and was shot and killed early in the day; the only casualty at or near either of the block houses.<br>
<br>
Robert Wilson was killed on the beach while exposing himself to procure. water.  None were wounded during the whole attack.  The real danger was not great when we consider how weak the Indians were when making the attack.  They would not expose themselves as a target for an enemy, and but very few Indians were seen during the whole day and then only while skulking in the forest nearby or moving stealthily from cover to cover.<br>
<br>
The reader will remember the bungling work of these these Indians on the inmates of the cabin, as described by Mr. King in a previous
chapter, at the time of the mamacre on White River.  Had there been even two resolute armed men it is not probable the attack on the cabin would have succeeed.<br>
<br>
With two hundred men In the town, most <B>of </B>them either with arms <B>or arms easily obtainable,</B> the Indians would not venture <B>from </B>under <B>cover and con</B>tented themselves with the robbery <B>or </B>destruction <B>of</B><br>
houses on the outskirts and <B>of </B>firing at the <B>block house</B> <B>or </B>marines on the beach at long range.<br>
<br>
<B>In </B>the <B>dense</B> forest skirting the town the Indians were as <B>safe from</B> attack <B>as </B>the whites in the block houses.  When they tired <B>of </B>firing, their <B>forces </B>withdrew a short distance to leisurely partake of their dinner that had been taken in part from the breakfast tables of the <B>frightened fami</B><B>lies, </B>and again return to renew the harmless <B>and </B>senseless expenditure of ammunition.<br>
<br>
I <B>say </B>senseless, <B>for</B> the reason that there never was the least possible <B>show</B> for the Indians to take the town and profit by <B>their</B> raid, and the only result to them was the waste <B>of </B>ammunition which they could not replace, and to demoralize their forces by their failure while strengthening the hands of their enemy in hastening ting under the call for volunteers previously made <B>by </B>the Governor.<br>
<br>
Moses Quiemuth tells me that Leschi opposed the move as unwise, but he thinks he went with the forces. He (Moses) did not go, and many others, so that it is not probable there were were than one hundred and fifty in the attacking party.  The grotesque account of the young Navigator Phelps where "bullets were flying in the air as thick as bees from the hive and where he numbered the foe "from one to two thousand judged by their yells," must be set down as either pure fancy or else a desire to magnify the prowess of his troops by<br>
the representation  of  the  great  numbers  opposed  to<br>
them.<br>
<br>
And yet this statement will doubtless bring out hot rejoinders from some of the paxticipants, who, to this this day, will not believe there were less than a thousand Indians of the attacking  party.<br>
<br>
No  doubt  their yells were terrifying and we have no reason to wonder that stout hearts quailed at the spectacle presented to them, not taking into account the lack <B>of </B>discipline <B>among </B>the Indians and utter absence <B>of </B>means to make a <B>successful </B>attack upon the town.<br>
<br>
Arthur Denny wrote <B>of </B>the conditions surrounding Seattle and <B>of </B>the attack:<br>
<br>
"After the White River massacre it was determined to prepare <B>for defence in case of an attack on the town. (Seattle).<br>
<br>
</B>"At the time there <B>was </B>a large amount of hewn timber on hand twelve inches square, which was well suited to the purpose. - Two houses were built of this timber, with sufficient capacity to hold the entire population at one tune.  One was located at the junction of
Front and Cherry Streets, and the other at the junction of Main and South Second Streets, and the two joined by a stockade which also ran <B>from </B>each westward to the bay, and was well calculated <B>for </B>protection on the land side of the town, from <B>whence all attacks </B>were likely to <B>come.<br>
<br>
"Early </B>in <B>the </B>morning of January <B>26th, </B>1856, the town was attacked  by  the Indians.  They had congregated during the night and taken their position under cover of the timber along the face of the hill, in readiness to make the attack as soon as the people began to stir, but their presence was made known by friendly Indians before the attack was made, and a howitzer was fired by order of Captain Gansevoort in the direction indicated by friendly Indians, which was promptly followed by an answer of musketry all along the woods in the rear of the town, fully demonstrating the fact that the place was really surrounded by the hostiles.<br>
<br>
"Fortunately, all the whites who were sleeping outside of the stockade escaped to the block houses  without injury.  The firing was kept up all day and two whites were killed; one, Robert Wilson, fell near the southern block house, and the other, Milton G. Holgate, brother of Mrs. E. Hanford and Lemuel J. Holgate, who still reside among us, was shot while standing in the door of the Cherry Street block house.<br>
<br>
"Two houses were burnt during the day, one near where the gas works now are, and the other the dwelling of Mr. Bell.  Several other houses, my own among the number, were plundered during the evening and everything of value carried off.<br>
<br>
"It is a mere matter of opinion whether the tovm without the aid of the Decatur would have been able to withstand the attack, but with the help of the marines on shore and the guns of the Decatur in the harbor, it was quite a different matter."<br>

THE BATTLE OF <B>SEATTLE</B><br>
<br>
Catharine Berry Judson, "The Battle of Seattle," <B>Early Days in Old Oregon.</B> Portland: Binfords and Mort, 1916, p. 226-233.<br>
<br>
Whoo! Whoo-oo!" An officer of the warship Decatur, who was on shore duty at Seattle on a very dark night, thought he heard an Qwl.  This was late in January, i8S6.  Blackness lay over th@@e waters of Puget Sound; blackness lay over the shore and the near-by forests.  All the people in the little sawmill town of Seattle were asleep, except
a few anxious ones.  Were the Indians asleep, or were they planning an attack? No one knew.  Therefore the officer pricked up his ears and listened, for the hooting had come out of the forest on his right.<br>
<br>
"Whoo! Whoo! Whoo-oo!" That hooting came out of the woods on the other side.  The officer listened anxiously, for the hooting of an owl was an old Indian signal.<br>
<br>
"Whoo! Whoo! Whoo-oo!" There it was again, on the right-hand side, but nearer than the first hoot.<br>
<br>
"Whoo! Whoo! Whoo-oo!" This time it was on the left, and also nearer.<br>
<br>
"No owl about that," said the officer to himself, "Those owls are Indians.  I guess we are in for it."<br>
<br>
One year before, Governor Stevens had made his treaties with the Puget Sound Indians, and then other treaties at the Great Council at Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
But the Indians were not satisfied with the treaties for several reasons: the lands given them were not the best; two or three tribes, eternal enemies, had been placed upon the same reservation, and that meant constant trouble; and besides, although the Indians had given up their lands, and the white people were building their cabins, fencing the lands, cutting down trees, and taking possession, the Great Father at Washington had not sent one penny of payment to his Indian children in Washington.  The Indians thought themselves tricked.  Indians from other parts of the country who happened to come into the west told them that the white men always did so.<br>
<br>
Another reason was this: the Indians for forty years had been dealing with the Hudson's Bay Company.  Dr. McLaughlin, the<br>
"White-Eagle Chief," and James Douglas, who followed him in the management of the fur trade, had power.<br>
<br>
If they made a promise to the Indians, they also kept it.  The Indians held them responsible.  When Governor Stevens made the treaties with the Indians, he made the promises.  But it was Congress who had to keep them.  Sometimes Congress was slow in doing this, and sometimes did not do it at all.  This was something the Indians could not understand.<br>
<br>
If they had been left alone, the lazy Puget Sound Indians might have complained and been troublesome, but perhaps they would not have
gone to war.  Thev liked better to squat in the bottoms of their canoes and fish; or to camp on the shores of Puget Sound and dig clams out of the beach; or to catch crabs.  But the horse Indians from east of the mountains were very warlike, and they were angry over the treaties.<br>
<br>
All these Indians knew well the difference between the "King George men" and the "Boston men." They were not angry with the British, who bought their furs.  They were angry with the Americans who had taken their lands and driven the game away.  There was danger of Indian attack on Seattle; therefore the hooting made the officer anxious.<br>
<br>
In October of the year before, Indians had killed several families in the White River Valley not so very far from Seattle.  All the loggers and farmers from the near-by country had come into Seattle for safety.  A blockhouse had been built-just a large log cabin.  Women and children were to run to it if Indians came.<br>
<br>
After the massacre of October, the Indians seemed to have quieted down.  Some people scoffed, and said, "Oh, there's no dangerl" A warship, the Decatur, lay in Elliott Bay, and these people even thought it ought to go on its cruise.  Others said, "Yes, there is danger.  Don't you see all these strange Indians about?"<br>
<br>
There were indeed a great many strange Indians around the little milling town.  They were tall, well-built, athletic Indians, bold and daring in appearance; they were very different from the short, bow-legged canoe Indians.  Most people knew at once that these strange Indians were the horse Indians from east of the Cascade Mountains.  And what were they doing visiting tribes whom they despised <B>as " </B>fish-eaters " ?<br>
<br>
So people waited and waited, some scoffing, and some afraid because they believed danger to be near.  Marines came on shore and sentinels watched during the nights.  That is how the officer from the Decatur happened to hear the hooting of owls in the forest.<br>
<br>
The officer, when he heard the hooting, at once sent word to Captain Ganzevoort of the Decatur.  He also sent word to the settlers.  Some of the leading men came quickly together for a council; and they asked Curley, a scout, to go into the forest and see if the Indians were threatening.  Curley was thought to be friendly.  He was gone two hours.<br>
<br>
When he came back he said there were no Indians in the woods.  He had actually gone straight to an Indian war council.<br>
<br>
Jim, another scout, who really was friendly, came in cautiously among the white settlers who were discussing the question.  Curley watched him closely.  When Jim had an opportunity, he warned the
Americans that the Indians had been holding a council, and that they would attack Seattle at dawn the next morning.<br>
<br>
Marines from the warship were landed at once.  Even with the near-by farmers, in the town there were not more than one hundred and twenty people there.  In Seattle itself there were only twenty houses and a sawmill.<br>
<br>
All night watch was kept.  Dawn came, then early morning, but no Indians.  Some scoffed again.  Those who had spent the night in the blockhouse went home, for Indians almost always attack at dawn, not during the day.  The settlers went back to their houses and the marines returned to the Decatur.  It was breakfast time and every-
one, after a sleepless, anxious night, was tired.  There were no sentinels on duty.<br>
<br>
About eight o'clock, Jim's sister, Nancy, came "down into the village.  Nancy was excited, and was shouting something as she waddled along, for she was 'a very fat Indian.<br>
<br>
"What's the matter, Nancy?" called some of the settlers.<br>
<br>
"Hi-hi-hiu Klickitats behind Tom Pepper's house," screamed the old Indian.  " Many, many Indians," was what the jargon meant.<br>
<br>
At once word was sent to the Decatur.  Captain Ganzevoort had had many false alarms; some of his officers thought this might be another.<br>
<br>
" Never mind," said the captain, who had not yet had his breakfast.<br>
<br>
" I'd rather be fooled twenty times than be caught napping once." He ordered a shell to be aimed behind Tom Pepper's house.<br>
<br>
Boom ! thundered the big gun.  The shell screamed its way through the air over the log cabins and exploded with a crash behind Tom Pepper's house.<br>
<br>
Warwhoops and yells from a thousand Indians was the answer.  Then the crash and bang of hundreds of Indian guns echoed through the forests, while a shower of whistling bullets fell like hail among the scurrying settlers.<br>
<br>
For at the first boom of the gun, out from the cabins rushed the settlers.  Breakfasts were left on the table, uneaten or half-eaten, or even on the stoves half-cooked.
The settlers were not all even fully dressed.  And, curiously enough, no one was hurt during that wild run because the Indians had to stop to reload their guns.  So began the battle of Seattle.<br>
The men who had guns went right out into the open hiding behind the into the streets before their houses, stumps of great trees left there.  The women and children were hurried off to a lumber vessel lying in the harbor which had come in a few days before to get piles and sawed lumber for California.<br>
<br>
Seattle, in those days, was nothing but a few log houses scattered in and out among the old stumps between what is now Second Avenue and the waters of Puget Sound.  When Mr. Yesler built his sawmill, in 1853, he had built it on a little peninsula near what is now the foot of Yesler Way.  The narrow neck of land connecting it with the mainland he had widened and heightened by heaps of sawdust, making a dry little knoll there.  That was all there was to the town.<br>
<br>
Up the hill from Second Avenue, much steeper then than now, was a dense forest of heavy trees, with dense underbrush, and in the forest the Indians were securely hidden and quite safe from bullets.<br>
Yet the battle went on-the steady roar of the cannon from the warship, the shrieking of the shells, and the crash of their explosion in the woods.  And mingled with this uproar was the bang of the guns, the wild whoops of Indian warriors, and the yelling of the squaws who urged them on.<br>
<br>
Indian bullets cut up the ground around the Americans, tore their clothes, cut through their hats, and whistled, thick as a swarm of bees, in the air; yet few white men were touched.<br>
<br>
The Americans aimed more accurately than the Indians.  And the shells from the " fire-ship " frightened the warriors rather badly.  They could not understand how a gun could "shoot twice"; that is, after the roar of leaving the gun, the shell exploded with a second crash when it reached its mark.  An Indian behind a tree had a lock of hair cut off by the fragment of a shell.  He said afterwards he could not understand how a gun could shoot around the corner."<br>
<br>
The fighting and yelling went on.  Hundreds of Indians just at noon dashed down upon fourteen Americans who stood at one point.  The white men stood their ground, in spite of the yelling redskins who came within a few feet of them.  And that was the critical moment of the day.  The Americans refused to be afraid; and that made the Indians a little afraid.  Had those fourteen run away, the settlers would probably have lost the day.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the settlers fought without having had even their breakfast.  The Indians did not.  They ate the breakfasts they found in the log cabins, and then set fire to them.  The settlers, with guns in their hands, saw the flames and smoke of their burning
homes.  Still they fought on.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, fewer shots came from the forest.  At once, as the Indian shooting faded out, the settlers feared treachery.  They watched the forest more closely than ever.  But when evening came, the Indians seemed to be disappearing.<br>
<br>
By ten o'clock at night, the battle was over.<br>
<br>
Indians never fight very long at a time.  They like to make quick dashes.  There were so many of them and so few of the white people that they felt sure of the quick capture of Seattle, so they brought very little food with them.  Now they sent word that they were going away.  But one old chief said they would be back "in one moon"' with twenty thousand warriors and kill off all the white men.<br>
<br>
The Indians admitted that twenty-eight braves had been killed and eighty wounded.  But the settlers and marines had only two killed and none wounded.<br>
<br>
During the next few weeks, fearing that the Indians might come back again, the sailors pulled up stumps, made roads, and cleared the ground around the settlement.  They built also a strong log-fence-a stockade-around part of the settlement.  But the warriors did not come back, and the next year the war east of the Cascade Mountains was ended also.<br>
<br>
The settlers of Oregon and of Washington along the Columbia River, with regular troops from California, fought the Indians east of the Cascades.  There were no very great battles, but many settlers and soldiers were killed; many Indians also.  At last peace was declared, the Indians quieted down, the treaties were kept by Congress, and things were safe for white settlers again.<br>

The Siege of Seattle<br>
<br>
Archie Binns, "The Siege of Seattle," <B>Northwest Gateway, the story of the port of Seattle.</B> Garden City, New York: Doubleday, Doran and Company, 1941, p. 124-158.<br>
<br>
Seattle was attacked by the Indians on the morning of January twenty-sixth, 1856.<br>
<B>
</B>Many participated in the battle, but only one participant<B><br>
</B>left a written account.  That was Lieutenant T. Stowell Phelps, navigating officer of the sloop-of-war Decatur.  His account, written seventeen years later from notes made at the time, does not fall entirely into the category of history.<br>
<br>
History is fiction agreed upon, and while much of the lieutenant's account is fiction, the disagreement has been violent.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Phelps is extravagant in his charges of cowardice against the Seattle volunteers; and he makes much of their insubordination.  Insubordination there was.  All of the volunteers were rugged individualists; many of them afterward became capitalists and some of them millionaires.  The company talked back to its officers and, in effect, voted on whether or not an order should be carried out.<br>
<br>
But Phelps's blanket charge of cowardice against the company does not fit the handful of men, a third of them with defunct rifles, who went into the heart of the Indians' stronghold to bury the dead of the White River massacre.  It does not fit the company that held the junction of the Green and White rivers, on the battlefield which the Indians had chosen, until Lieutenant Slaughter was killed and his regulars forced to retreat to Seattle with their dead and wounded.<br>
<br>
The Battle of Seattle has somewhat the sound of a comic opera title, and it had its comic opera touches, despite the anguish it caused at the time and the ruin it left in its wake.<br>
The Decatur saved Seattle from destruction, and she managed it by the narrowest margin.  On December seventh, she struck an unsuspected reef off Bainbridge Island, across the Sound from Seattle.  She hogged as the tide went out and left her draped over a ledge.<br>
<br>
On the next tide she was kedged off and worked to Seattle, with six feet of water in her hold.  There she was beached beside Yesler's wharf for repairs.<br>
<br>
On December tenth Captain Sterrett's place was taken by Captain Guert Gansevoort, who was a remarkably capable and unassuming commander.  Ironically, he is chiefly remembered in connection with the most bizarre incident of the American Navy.  He was executive officer of the brig Somers on her Caribbean cruise when the son of the Secretary of the Navy had a dime-novel dream about seizing the brig and going pirating on the Spanish Main-and was hung for it.<br>
<br>
The young man confessed the juvenile plot before he was strung up to the yardarm, but members of his college fraternity maintain to this day that the incriminating paper found on his person
contained the secrets of the Sigma Nu fraternity and that he died rather than reveal their meaning.  Along with him there died another confessed plotter and a sailor who was unquestionably in-
nocent of being either a mutineer or a Sigma Nu.<br>
<br>
In the Decatur, Captain Gansevoort found a dubious command.  The sloop-of-war, built in I838, was hove down on the Seattle beach beside Yesler's wharf, with her topmasts and yards sent ashore, her dismounted battery useless on the wharf, and a large section of her bottom stove in.<br>
<br>
A survey showed that she was only the ghost of a ship: a fabric of dry rot held together by an inch of sound outside planking that had been preserved by the sea.  Gansevoort and his crew worked <B>day and night, jack</B>ing frames into their original shape and covering rotten planking with new fir lumber from Yesler's mill.<br>
<br>
While repairs were rushed on the old sloop-of-war the Indians rushed their preparations to rub out the village and capture the Decatur's munitions while she lay on the beach like a stranded whale.  Until that time the Indians had defeated all the regular and volunteer troops sent against them, but they had got no comfort from their victories.<br>
<br>
All winter the guerrilla warriors, with their wives and children, had been starving in the swamps of the White River country while they sued, unsuccessfully, for peace.  The only one who could make peace was angry Territorial Governor Stevens; and he was for hanging all the hostile Indians first and talking peace afterward.<br>
So the war went on.<br>
<br>
By January the game was almost up. The attack on Seattle was a farewell gesture or a last, desperate attempt to replenish their commissary from the stores of the village and their powder from the magazines of the Decatur.<br>
<br>
While the Indians gathered the last of their strength for the attack the men of the Decatur worked desperately on their beached and helpless ship, and the people of Seattle passed anxious days and nights.  The nights were the worst, in the village that was a sprinkling of candle-lit windows along the edge of the tremendous darkness of the forest, where it was easy to hear things.<br>
<br>
There were false alarms, sometimes three in one night, when candle lights were pinched out and everyone ran pell-mell for the blockhouse on the mound of the peninsula.<br>
<B><br>
On the night </B>of january eighteenth there was a woman's scream and the unmistakable explosion of a gun.  The citizens, in their nightclothes, ran to the fort; the marines who had been sleeping
<br>
there tumbled out of their hammocks and grabbed up their stacked muskets.<br>
<br>
It was a false alarm so far as Indians were concerned.  The shot had been fired by a boy of fifteen who was saving his sister from a sailor.  The sailor, John Drew, was a deserter from the beached Decatur.  He had tried to enter a house at the edge of the village and had awakened a young lady with the noise he made opening the window.  She had tried to close the window when he was halfway through, pinning him down with the sash and screaming for help.  In response her young brother had come in with a fowling piece and shot the intruder through the head.<br>
<br>
That was the first defensive shot fired in the Battle of<br>
Seattle, and it killed a man who was supposed to be there to help defend the place.  But then, as always, not everyone behaved splendidly.  That night was a turning point in the defense of the village.  Working by lantern light the officers and men of the Decatur finished the outboard repairs on the ship.<br>
<br>
In the morning, when she was afloat, they laid her alongside Yesler's wharf and hoisted her guns and spars on board.  Then they hauled her out into Elliott Bay and began the job of putting her back in fighting trim.  Whatever chance the Indians had had of capturing the sloop-of war vanished during the night that John Drew played his villainous role.<br>
<br>
On January twenty-fifth affairs at Seattle took on the full proportions of comic opera.  During the day the survey steamer Active came into the bay and let her anchor   go near the Decatur, which was being feverishly tuned up for trouble.  On board the Active was Governor Stevens and his staff, with Captain Keyes of the regular army and Indian Agent Mike Simmons, the "Daniel Boone" of the territory.<br>
<br>
The swarthy, headstrong little Governor had been inclined to make the most of the Indian War and exaggerate rather than belittle the danger of the settlers.  But for reasons that remain obscure, he ridiculed the idea of an attack on Seattle.  He went ashore and made a speech to the citizens, ending with the words: "I tell you there are not fifty hostile Indians in the territory, and I believe that the cities of New York and San Francisco will as soon be attacked by the Indians as the town of Seattle."<br>
<br>
The Governor then went on board the Decatur and tried to persuade Captain Gansevoort to give up his unnecessary watch over Seattle and accompany him on a cruise to Bellingham Bay.  Gansevoort could not be persuaded, and the Active departed with the displeased Gov-<br>
ernor and his staff.
<br>
While the Active was still in the bay, showing her stern to the village, Indians began coming into town.  They were peaceful Lake Indians under Chief Tecumseh, and they brought their women and children with them asking for protection; but friendly Indians moving out of the woods suggested hostiles moving in.<br>
<br>
Tecumseh and his tribe were given a camp site inside the stockade, behind Madame Damnable's place.  While they were getting settled Captain Gansevoort's Indian scout returned from an expedition in the woods. He reported that a large number of Indians had crossed Lake Washington for an attack on Seattle and that they might come in that night.<br>
<br>
The same afternoon seventy-odd Seattle volunteers landed on the beach from canoes and straggled into the village.  They had not come to defend Seattle but to lead a civilian life.  Their three months' term of enlistment had expired on that inconvenient day.<br>
<br>
They had left the Duwamish blockhouse punctually at the hour of expiration, and that evening they were mustered out in front of Yesler's log cook house and the company disbanded.<br>
<br>
By then Captain Gansevoort knew the storm was about to break and he ordered his fighting divisions ashore.  The First Divisions under Lieutenant Drake, was stationed at the south part of town.  The Second Division, under Lieutenant Hughes, armed with rifles and carbines, occupied a store to the north of Drake's position.<br>
<br>
The Third Division, under Lieutenant Phelps, armed with muskets held the head of Yesler's wharf where the boats landed.  The Fourth Division, under Lieutenant Dallas, armed with muskets, rifles and pistols occupied Mr Plummer's house at the southeastern part of town.  The variety of arms suggests that each man carried an arsenal, but the suggestion is misleading.<br>
<br>
The Decatur had been almost stripped of small arms for the defense of other parts of the Sound, and her fighters had to get along with the miscellaneous weapons that were left.  The Adjutant General had even attempted to borrow the Decatur's howitzer, but Captain Gansevoort had declined to give it up.<br>
<br>
The prized brass howitzer was now taken ashore in the launch and was posted in the rear of Lieutenant Hughes position, where it could fire over the heads of the Second Division.<br>
<br>
The howitzer was under the command of Lieutenant Morris, with a crew of nine and marines to guard it.  The remainder of the marines, under Sergeant Corbine, were posted at the north
blockhouse, which mounted two nine-pound guns.  Sentries were posted and the Decatur's men were ready for the defense of Seattle.<br>
<br>
The position of the volunteers was now embarrassing.  The men had just received their discharges, and technically the war was over as far as they were concerned; and on that very day the war seemed to be beginning in earnest.  The village where they had just been disbanded was about to be attacked.  The principles of patriotism involved were not too abstract for men who would have been fighting to save scalps that included their own; but some of the men responded to the new call for volunteers and some did not.<br>
<br>
The men who were citizens of Seattle and had wives and children and property to protect took up their arms again.  Others from the outside, who had nothing more than their lives at stake, declined to see that the impending-attack had anything to do with themselves.<br>
<br>
Some of the citizens went to the blockhouse that night, but most of them spent the night in their own houses, reassured by the dim lights and dark bulk of the Decatur in the bay, and by the quiet footsteps of the sentries and officers making their rounds.  In the village the black night passed quietly at the edge of the blacker forest.<br>
<br>
But in legend, at least, more was going on than met the eye, and it was a night of dramatic activity.  Some of the things that almost certainty never happened have their own charm and they are included, in italics, along with doubtful and conflicting statements.<br>
<br>
It was a windless', misty night ashore, but:<br>
<br>
On the Sound a wild storm was raging.  Through the storm there battled a big canoe, manned with friendly squaws of Chief Seattle's tribe.  In the canoe there was a white woman, Mrs Maynard, the sister of Indian Agent Mike Simmons, and the wife of Doctor Maynard, who was temporarily in charge of the reservation at Port Madison.<br>
<br>
Mrs Maynard had been warned that Seattle would be attacked in the morning and she was on her way to give the alarm.  The canoe was almost swamped many times, and once the wild storm drove it ashore on West Point.There it was surrounded by hostile Indians, and it seemed that all was lost.  But the squaws were loyal and undaunted.<br>
<br>
In the nick of time they had Mrs Maynard lie down in the bottom of the canoe, where they covered her with a wet blanket.  When the hostile warriors demanded to know what they had in the canoe,
Chief Seattle's Amazon's said it was clams.  Mrs Maynard kept perfectly still, aiding the deception.<br>
<br>
The hostiles accepted the explanation and allowed the party to push off into the storm.  The canoe reached the Decatur safely and Mrs Maynard delivered the message that saved Seattle.  Captain Gansevoort urged Mrs Maynard to stay on board and not venture out into the storm, but the brave woman insisted it was her duty to return to the reservation before the Indians discovered her absence and made trouble.  The big canoe pushed off from the Decatur, into the storm, and landed her at Fort Madison before daybreak.<br>
<br>
The story of the canoe journey through the storm is true, but the woman was not Mrs Maynard.  It was Princess Angeline, daughter of Chief Seattle.  She made the journey through the storm in a little dugout and delivered the message directly to citizens in the village.  The exploit was a proof of her undying loyalty to the white race.<br>
<br>
The Indians and whites at Port Madison were on the opposite side of the Sound from hostilities.  They knew less of what was brewing than the people of Seattle.  No woman or man, Indian or white, made a canoe journey across the Sound, through a storm that did not exist, to warn the village.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in the calm and misty night ashore, there were strange sounds and mysterious figures moved.<br>
<br>
That night the defenders heard what seemed to be the hooting of owls in the woods, and they knew it was the gathering hostiles signaling to one another.  Captain Gansevoort's Indian spy, sub-chief Curley, was sent to investigate.  He was gone a long time, and when he returned he reported nothing but owls in the woods.<br>
<br>
Some sixth sense warned Lieutenant Phelps that Curley had passed beyond the pale of being trusted.  He followed Curley secretly. When the Indian thought he was no longer being observed he made an angry gesture, muttering something unintelligible, and started toward his own camp at a rapid pace.<br>
<br>
In the darkness of that same night, two Indians, muffled in blankets, appeared at the sector guarded by Phelps's division.  When they were challenged they explained that they were Lake Indians on the way hack to their camp after visiting Curley.  Phelps believed them and they were allowed to pass.<br>
<br>
They were Owhi and Leschi, the commanders-in-chief of the attacking forces, who had walked into the village to persuade the friendly Lake Indians to attack the settlement from within.<br>
<br>
The daring spies were not Owhi and Leschi. they were Owhi and
Coquilton, and they were on their way to a council of war with other hostile chiefs.<br>
<br>
They were two other Indians, and the incident never happened.<br>
<br>
There is disagreement even as to who guarded the village:<br>
<br>
Later that night, on his rounds of inspection, Lieutenant Phelps visited the sector guarded by the Seattle volunteers. He found the sector deserted except for the volunteers' rifles, which they had left to represent themselves while they went home to bed.<br>
<br>
The fighting divisions of the Decatur were asleep in their hammocks in the blockhouse, and the citizens alone guarded the town that night.<br>
<br>
Whatever happened, the night passed without alarms.  Daybreak saw the village unattacked, with blue uniformed sentries standing guard in the morning mist, and light blue wood smoke going up sluggishly from the chimneys of cabins and frame houses at the edge of the forest.<br>
<br>
On the sloop-of-war in the bay, and on the lumber bark Brontes, lying a cable's length to the south, brown coal smoke went up from the "Charlie Nobles" of the galleys, and there was a smell of coffee and breakfast cooking.  The weather was not cold for January, and there was no snow on deck or on the ground ashore; but the morning had its sting of cold and it was a good time to think of breakfast.<br>
<br>
At a few minutes after six Captain Gansevoort ordered the fighting divisions to fall back, one on the other, commencing at the outermost post, and move toward the boats at the head of Yesler's wharf.  They embarked and returned to the Decatur at about seven-thirty.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile:<br>
<br>
Yarkekeeman Jim, the only Indian trusted by the officers of the Decatur, held the fate of Seattle in his tied hands.  He had been present at the council of war held in the lodge of the treacherous Tecumseh, back of Madame Damnable's.  Jim had persuaded the chiefs to wait until daylight and make their attack while the marines were on board ship.<br>
<br>
It was now daylight, and the marines presumably were at breakfast.  The attack might come at any moment, and Jim was being shadowed by his father, the suspicious Curley.  Somehow be eluded that chief and slipped into Doctor Williamson's house, where he told the doctor that the village was about to be attacked. Hardly had he whispered the words when Curley entered the front door, demanding insolently where Jim was. Doctor Williamson answered by thrusting him into a convenient room and turning the key in the lock.  He then hastened
to inform Mr Yesler.<br>
<br>
The incident is true, only it was an Indian named William, not Jim, who notified Doctor Williamson, who notified Mr Yesler.<br>
<br>
No Indian council of war was held in the village, and neither Jim nor William bad anything to do with the warning, which Curley delivered to Mr Yesler.<br>
<br>
Duly warned, the massive Yesler paddled out to the Decatur in a dugout and interviewed Captain Gansevoort.  In Gansevoort's report to the Secretary of the Navy he states that "Mr Yesler" informed him that he had learned from a private source, which was worthy of attention, that the Indians were just in the edge of the woods, close to the town.<br>
<br>
And Mr Yesler pointed out the positions they had taken up.  They were in three parts, extending over a space of about two miles, just in rear of the town, the largest portion being at the extreme southeast, with a marsh of about 125 yards intervening.<br>
Captain Gansevoort immediately had the long roll sounded.  The marines, half through breakfast, were ordered ashore.  Gansevoort went with <B>them, </B>leaving Executive Officer Middleton in command of the ship's battery.<br>
<br>
The four fighting divisions, numbering ninety men, landed at Yesler's wharf and went ashore at the double-quick to their assigned positions.  The first three divisions formed a line from the head of the wharf <B>down the</B> neck of the peninsula to the blockhouse, and the Fourth Division continued the line south.  As before, the rest of the marines were stationed at the blockhouse.  Lieutenant Morris, with his howitzer crew, was stationed between the First Division and the Fourth, on the mound of the peninsula.<br>
<br>
With his forces in order Captain Gansevoort had the howitzer trained on Indian Tom Pepper's house on the slope across the lagoon.  According to Mr Yesler's information the main body of Indians had gathered in the neighborhood of that house.<br>
<br>
At this point Fat  Nancy,  Curley's  squaw,  waddled  about<br>
the beach  proclaiming:  "Hiu  Klickitat  copa  Tom  Pepper's<br>
house!"  She  then  leaped  into  a  canoe  and  paddled  off<br>
across the Sound in a shower of spray.  Acting on this piece of feminine intuition Captain Gansevoort ordered the howitzer to be fired.<br>
<br>
Whether the information came from Curley or from Nancy, or from Jim who was their son, it seems to have come from somewhere in the family.  Gansevoort gave the order, "Fire!" and the sharp report of the howitzer rang <B>out.  </B>A second later a ball of smoke blossomed from the side of the Decatur in the bay.  A big gun boomed and a shell came screeching over the peninsula.  Both shells fell near Tom Pepper's house.  
There was a yell from the woods beyond the village, and a crash of musketry, answered by the small arms of the marines.<br>
<br>
By oversight, or otherwise, the citizens of Seattle were the last to now <B>t </B>at the moment of attack had come.  Most of them were in their cabins -at breakfast when they heard the report of the howitzer and the dull boom of the Decatur's gun, the yell of Indians from the near-by forest and the rolling crash of musketry.<br>
<br>
Seattle forgot all about breakfast and stampeded to the blockhouse.  Mrs Blaine, the minister's wife and her newborn baby were carried in a rocking chair.  Mr Hanford ran with a small child in each arm, while his oldest son carried his rifle.  Cornelius who was seven, had to get along under his own power.  He later became a judge and a historian, but his good upbringing nearly cost him dear that day.  When he had run a few steps he remembered what boys should do upon entering or leaving a house, and he turned back to close the door.  Ready to resume his flight, he was startled by the heads of Indians rising from behind a fir log.<br>
<br>
Farther north in the village Louisa Denny, wife of David, was alone in the cabin with her two-year-old baby and her baking.  Throughout her life she was the archetype of pioneer women, and her presence of mind was not upset by the bang and roar of big guns, the crackle of musketry and the yell of Indians.  She dumped the biscuits from the oven into her apron, snatched up the baby in her free arm and was on her way without a wasted motion or lost second.<br>
<br>
Hillory Butler, Esquire, late of Virginia, rose late that morning, but suddenly.  By the sounds of battle, he judged there was no time to put on trousers.  So he jumped into his wife's red <B>flannel petticoat</B> and ran like a Lady from Hell.  According to one story he called after the Widow McConaha, Wait for me, Mrs McConaha!" And ac cording to another a woman called after him, "Wait for me, Hillory!<br>
<br>
" But Hillory neither waited nor was waited for.  Little Virginia Bell dived into the blockhouse between the legs of a marine whom she brought down with a crash.<br>
<br>
In the rout of settlers coming in there were Miss Kirkland and Louisa Denny, with her baby and her apronful of hot biscuits.  Her husband, on watch at the blockhouse, ran out to meet her.  As he ran, an excited volunteer <B>inside</B> fired off his rifle.  Miss Kirkland fell beside the young mother and lay still, her face dead white.<br>
<br>
They carried her inside, thinking she had been killed.  But she had only fainted, and the bullet that missed her head had cut off a lock
of her thick black hair.<br>
<br>
The Indians had emptied their rifles and Hudson's Bay muskets in a haphazard volley, replying to the howitzer and the Decatur's gun.  In. the time it took them to reload the citizens were out of effective range.  On the way to the blockhouse none of them was hit, either by the Indians or by the volunteers.  The Indians had now reloaded, and spent bullets pattered against the squared timbers of the building.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Piexotto of the volunteers stood in the doorway, with one hand against the frame, watching for a sight of the Indians.  Among the crowd in the blockhouse was Milton Holgate, aged fifteen, carrying the fowling piece with which he had killed the drunken in-
truder from the sloop-of-war.  The boy had run to the blockhouse because everyone else was doing that, but he did not want to stay there to be protected along with the women and children; he wanted to take part in the fighting.<br>
<br>
He started out, under the horizontal arm of Lieutenant Piexotto in the doorway, and received a bullet between the eyes.  He was the youngest and the first to fall, and they laid him under the stairway where the flag wrapped body of Lieutenant Slaughter had lain in state after they brought him out from his defeat in the valley of the White River.<br>
<br>
In the first phase of the attack the heaviest exchange of fire was between the divisions on the peninsula, in the southern part of town, and the Indians across the lagoon in the neighborhood of Tom Pepper's house.  The distance was roughly two hundred yards-beyond the range of effective rifle fire-and the Indians had the protection of the dense woods.<br>
<br>
Now and then some of them showed themselves, and were driven to cover by grapeshot and time shells from the howitzer and the ship's battery.  Lieutenant George Morris, in charge of the howitzer, was praised for delivering quick and accurate fire and for his cool efficiency in the battle.<br>
<br>
Actually Morris had much the better of the argument, firing a smart howitzer at Indians armed with old muskets, who were learning about shellfire for the first time.  But Morris did a good job that day.  And when the changing art of killing placed him in the position of the outclassed Indians, his coolness did not desert him.  That was six years later, when the Confederate Navy tried out something new on wooden ships of war.<br>
<br>
The ugly Merrimac was the experiment, and the futile shells of the rammed Cumberland bounced off her ironclad sides.  <B>Morris, in</B> command of the Cumberland, fought on with his guns left in action until his outmoded ship sank under the waters of Hampton Roads.<br>
After the war the Indians admitted that they were disturbed by the
<br>
time shells that lay still for a few seconds and then shot for a second time.  They called them "the shells that mox poohed."<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Phelps describes a group of them who joined hands in a war dance around one of these trophies-and were blown to perdition.  Phelps saw a great deal that day, and legends have played variations on his themes:<br>
<br>
During this part of the battle Chief Curley came out on the neck of the peninsula, with his face painted black and a long rifle in one hand and a bow almost as long as himself in the other.  He performed a war dance on the sawdust and ended his display of bravado by leaping high into the air and disappearing with a fiendish yell.<br>
<br>
It was Chief Seattle, not Curley, and he performed the dance on the sandspit.<br>
<br>
It was Chief Seattle, but he did not do a war dance.  He wrung his hands in distress at the sight of his own people and his white friends battling with each other. It was Chief Seattle, but he was not between the opposing forces.  He was at the Port- Madison reservation, fourteen miles away, and he shoved great distress at the distant thunder of the Decatur's guns which announced that battle was being fought.<br>
<br>
The Felker House, run by Mother Damnable, was the most pretentious building in town.  Across its white painted front there was a porch whose roof made a railed balcony for the second-floor rooms.  The balcony was reached from a door at the end of the centered hall, and it was something like stepping out on deck from the passenger quarters of a ship.<br>
<br>
The house was the farthest point in town from the attack, and the second-story balcony was a promising place from which to watch the battle.  A young man named Wilson stepped out there and had his neck broken by a bullet.<br>
<br>
At the blockhouse there was a young man who knew what an Indian attack meant, and he did not want to see anything of it.  His name was Johnny  King, and he had had his seventh birthday since he saved his little sister and brother from the White River massacre.  On that occasion he had been as resourceful as an old scout; but at the attack on Seattle he had no responsibilities to take his mind off himself.<br>
<br>
He was his seven years, neither more nor less, and the banging of the muskets and the sound of bullets thudding into the wall of the blockhouse reminded him of terrifying things.  He pleaded and demanded to be taken on board the Decatur, which had been his refuge after his earlier experience.  Physically he was safer in the blockhouse than in the open on the way to the ship, but he made a great deal of noise, and the sergeant of marines was his friend.<br>

Corbine saw it would be better for the child to risk a few bullets than to go mad in the noisy blockhouse where a young man lay dead under the stairs.  The only door of the blockhouse faced the woods, under direct fire, but there were axes and saws inside, and Johnny wanted to be elsewhere.  So the marines cut out a section of a timber at the back of the blockhouse, and one of them semaphore the Decatur.<br>
<br>
A gig was sent ashore, and as it neared the beach they turned the boy loose through the hole in the timbered wall; from there he did not need any instruction.  Bullets whanged past him on the beach, and spent bullets dropped in the water about the gig as the sailors rowed the boy out to the sloop-of-war; but Johnny was not terrified any more because that was the way to the Decatur, and the only safety for him was safety as he saw it.<br>
<br>
The Indians had no luck against the south of town, where Morris' howitzer and the guns of the Decatur battered the woods about them with solid shot and grapeshot and explosive shells.  After an hour or so the main part of the attackers circled through the woods and warmed up the attack on the north end of town.  From the woods a hundred yards away they poured a sharp and steady fire down upon the head of Yesler's wharf.<br>
<br>
Captain Gansevoort observed that their fire was returned most spiritedly by Lieutenant Phelps's Division.  If the captain had seen the deeds that Phelps described for posterity, his praise would have been greater:<br>
<br>
The Indians charged to within twenty feet of Phelps's decision before they were stopped by the marshy sawdust fill.  There they took cover in the chaparral, behind logs and stumps, and rained bullet on Phelps and his division. The bullets were as thick as bees from a hive, and Lieutenant Phelps was in the gravest peril of all.  Chief Kakum of the treacherous Lake tribe had recognized Phelps as- an officer and marked him for death.<br>
<br>
Resting his rifle in crotched branches, or shooting from behind a tree, the Indian sharpshooter devoted his morning to getting rid of the young lieutenant.  Kakum kept up his sniping until the batteries of the Decatur came to the rescue, and a grapeshot took off a lock of his hair while he was hiding behind a tree.  The chief then observed that he could not compete with a gun that shot around a corner and he retired.<br>
<br>
Phelps observes that during this phase of the engagement his clothing and that of his men were riddled with bullet holes.  He explains the fact that none of them was hit by saying it was a miracle.  He does not, however, explain the greater miracle of how none of them suffered from powder burns at the point-blank range of twenty feet.<br>
<br>

Meanwhile the squaws of the attackers had butchered the citizens' milk cows and oxen and set them roasting.  The barbecue was ready at about three o'clock in the afternoon, and the squaws called to their braves to come and get it.  The response was so nearly unanimous that Captain Gansevoort observed the enemy's fire reduced to a few scattering shots.<br>
<br>
Accordingly he ordered his divisions to fall back to the boat landing at Yesler's wharf and return to the ship for lunch.  The retreating Indians paused to fire at the retreating marines, and the marines replied with a running fire of musketry and two shots from the howitzer.<br>
<br>
On their way to the boats the fighting divisions stopped at the blockhouse and took the women and children with them.  Seattle was cleared of noncombatants along with the four divisions and the howitzer, but the marines and volunteers were still on guard at the blockhouse, and the village was commanded by the guns of the Decatur.  Also, the Indians had shot away most of their ammunition and gone to dinner.<br>
<br>
The men who had been left at the blockhouse were hungry too, and some of the volunteers crept out to the Boren house, which was a block to the northeast, at the edge of the woods, and brought in food.  One of the Graham boys demonstrated a volunteer's accomplishments by baking a batch of biscuits within easy range of the Indians' barbecue, and taking them, hot, to the fort.  The other food brought in was pork and flour and potatoes, but there was no fuel for cooking, and the fort was unpleasantly cold that January afternoon.<br>
<br>
According to tradition "Uncle Tommy" Mercer solved the fuel problem.  He went to Dexter Horton's barn, where he kept his horses, hitched up the black mare and the pale stallion, and drove into the forest.  Mercer had always been kind and helpful to the Indians, -and when they saw who it was they said "It's only Old Tom Mercer minding his own business" and they did not interfere with him while he loaded his wagon with wood and drove back to the fort.<br>
<B><br>
<br>
With a </B>pause for dinner was an armistice in a battle that was never really renewed.  Later in the afternoon the Indians delivered a few face-saving volleys of musket fire, and the batteries of the sloop-of-war answered with round shot; but the battle had grown cold and could not be brought to life again.<br>
<br>
Under cover of darkness the Indians plundered some of the houses in the village of food and clothing.  They burned all of the houses on the outlying claims, with two exceptions, and retreated south along the Duwamish River burning unoccupied buildings as they went.  
The Battle of Seattle was over, but at the time the citizens could not be sure of that.  All of them expected a renewal of the attack, and some of them a siege of two or three months.<br>
<br>
The number of attacking Indians has been estimated as high as three thousand, and according to tradition a thousand Klickitats came over Snoqualmie Pass to join the attack.  The tradition disregards the condition of the pass.  There had been three weeks of mild weather with rain that fell as soft, deep snow in the mountains.  It is doubtful if any number of Indians could have got over, or if any of them tried.  The attack on Seattle was the work of probably two hundred local Indians.<br>
<br>
The outlying claims that were not burned were those of Thomas Mercer and David Denny, both of them known for their considerate treatment of the Indians.  Afterward, when asked why they had spared Mercer's house, the Indians explained, "Old Tom might need it some time."<br>
<br>
From a military point of view the attack on Seattle was a case of "some dirt, not much hurt." Among the whites two rash young men were killed and <B>nine wounded The </B>most accurate estimate of the In-
dians'casualties seems to be none killed and none wounded.  But it was a noisy battle, and the booming of the Decatur's guns was heard as far as the Strait of Juan de Fuca.<br>
<br>
On the evening of the day of battle the survey steamer Active came plowing back into the harbor under forced draft.  On board was the fiery and stiff-necked little Governor who had declared, eighteen hours earlier, that the cities of New York and San Francisco would as soon be attacked by Indians as Seattle.<br>
<br>
Since then there had been six hours of heavy gunfire.  Ashore, at the edge of town, buildings were burning.  To the south, along the Duwamish, flames were going up against the night sky; and when the Governor boarded the Decatur the cabin and wardroom were crowded with rescued women and children.<br>
<br>
The people of Seattle buried young Holgate and young Wilson beside the White Church and prepared for another attack, which they all expected.  The volunteers and marines put up a second blockhouse and began building a stockade around the town.  Yesler, who had already provided so much, contributed seventy thousand board feet of lumber.<br>
<br>
The stockade consisted of two parallel walls, a foot and a half apart, with the space between packed with earth.  It was twelve hundred yards long and gave protection on the north, east and south to the houses on the peninsula.  The west side of the enclosure was open to the civilized salt water of the bay.
To give the pet howitzer mobility and scope, a road was built around the stockade, stumps in the village were Phelps remarks with pride that soon the place had the look of a well-laid-out town.<br>
<br>
While this work was going on, the weather remained raw, with deluges of rain.  Officers and men alike wore the costume they found most suited for the job ashore: warm underwear, heavy marine trousers tucked into high cowhide boots, five blue flannel shirts, a folded blanket around the neck, crossed in front and secured with a cartridge belt, and a slouch hat.<br>
<br>
Whenever the rain let up a little the wearer took off four of his five flannel shirts and dried them in Yesler's log cook house or before some other friendly fire.<br>
<br>
With two blockhouses, a stockade and a howitzer road Seattle was prepared for the second Indian attack-which never came.  The marines' last skirmish in Seattle was fought with Madame Damnable.  According to Phelps these men had survived where bullets flew thick as bees from a hive? and while their clothes had been riddled, no lead ever touched their skin.  But in the action at the Felker House no miracles preserved them.  Division after division fled in disorder, with stone bruises and dog bites.<br>
<br>
The howitzer road was laid out to pass close to the Felker House, and for some reason Madame Damnable hated the crew of the Decatur.  The first division that started work in front of her house was paralyzed by the sudden blast of her approach.  Out she came, Eke a red faced fury: a woman of coarse and masculine build, with her apron full of rocks and three savage dogs running with her.  The fighting division stared anxiously, not being sure when they broke and ran under her barrage of rocks, with the dogs tearing at their protecting clothes.<br>
<br>
While Madame Damnable pelted them she emptied the English language of its profane and obscene accumulations.<br>
<br>
The next division laughed at the first for being routed by a woman.  They took over the Felker House sector and lasted for two blows of their picks, which brought the cursing Jezebel with her man-eating dogs and a fresh apronful of rocks.  The other divisions tried, but none of them made out any better than earlier sailors had on the shore of the man-eating and rock-throwing Cyclops.  After that they shunned the place and worked elsewhere until the howitzer road was complete except for that one piece.<br>
<br>
Captain Gansevoort inspected the job, and he was puzzled to see the
fine road broken by a patch of stumps and salal.  What was the meaning of this? The shamefaced young lieutenants explained the difficulty, and Gansevoort said, "Tut, tut! Why didn't you tell me before? I shall explain that the road is a military necessity." He walked confidently up to the door of the Felker House and came back in disorder, with rocks and curses flying, and the great-voiced harridan and her dogs in hot pursuit.<br>
<br>
Captain Gansevoort did not go back to the Felker House, but he was a commander and he explained to his lieutenants, who listened more attentively than Madame Damnable, that the road was a military necessity and it must be completed.<br>
<br>
After that the lieutenants tried strategy.  One party created a diversion while the other tried to work.  But Madame<br>
found that two stoned as easily as one, and it was a field day for her dogs.  Then they tried surprise sorties: the assigned division would creep up on the job at odd hours, praying the harridan was asleep or busy in the other wing of the house.  But Madame Damnable was never caught napping, and every childish and transparent strategy was met by a sudden blast of rocks and curses and vicious dogs.<br>
<br>
Days passed while work on the road stood still, and it was the Fourth Division's turn to be under fire.  Lieutenant Dallas did not have any ingenious plan left, and the morale of his division was low with memories of earlier defeats.  When the door of the Felker House flew open for the Fury and her dogs, the Fourth Division broke and ran.  All of them ran except Quartermaster Sam Silk.  Sam stood his ground, with memories and recognition glimmering in his mind.  The dogs, used to pursuing running men, passed him by.  And Madame Damnable, reaching into her bumpy apron for a rock, paused in astonishment.<br>
<br>
Sam took the aggressive and roared at the harridan: "What do you mean, you d ---- d old so-an'-so? Many's the time I've seen you howling thunder around Fell's Point, Baltimore! You're a d ---- d pretty one, ain't you? "<br>
<br>
Madame Damnable was taken completely aback by the reference to her past.  In shame she let go her apron with its load of rocks and bolted back into the Felker House.  The thunderclap of the closing door was the last the Decatur's men heard from her.  In peace they finished the howitzer road, which was never used for war.<br>
<br>
The Indians never came back to raze the village of Seattle.  Some of the warriors had dropped out of the fighting after the failure of
the first attack.  Six weeks later the remainder started on a desperate retreat over the Cascade Mountains.<br>
<br>
Without the distracting presence of the Indians the Indian War was able to really get under way, and in that action the Seattle volunteers played an important part.<br>
<br>
Governor Stevens declared martial law in Pierce County, in order that settlers suspected of giving aid and comfort to the enemy could be held without trial.<br>
<br>
When the time arrived for the regular term of court in the county under martial law, the only judge available was Chief Justice Lander, captain of the Seattle volunteers.  He turned the volunteer company over to Arthur Denny, who was next <B>in </B>command, put his black robe in his carpet bag and paddled south in an Indian dugout.  After two attempts to hold court Lander was arrested and held a prisoner until martial law was broken.<br>

BATTLE OF SEATTLE.<br>
<br>
Hubert Howe Bancroft, "The Battle of Seattle" <B>History of the Pacific States.</B> San Francisco: The History Company, 1890. Volume XXVI, p. 124-134.<br>
<br>
About the 1st of January, 1856, it was discovered that he [Leschi, war chief of the Nisquallies] was actually present at the reserve, making boasts of capturing the agent; and as the authorities very much desired to secure his arrest, [Captain Erasmus D.] Keyes secured the loan of the Hudson's Bay Company's steamer Beaver and sent [Captain Maurice] Maloney and his company to seize and bring him to Fort Steilacoom.<br>
<br>
But as the Beaver approached the shore to effect a landing Leschi drew up his forces in battle array to meet the troops, who could only land in squads of three or four from a small boat.  Finding that it would not be safe to expose his men in such a manner, and having no cannon to disperse the Indians, Maloney was compelled to return to Steilacoom without accomplishing the object of the
expedition.<br>
<br>
Keyes then determined to make another effort for the capture of Leschi and embarking for Seattle in the surveying steamer Active, James Alden commander, endeavored to borrow the howitzer and launch of the Decatur, which was refused by the new commander, Gansevoort, <B>upon </B>the ground that they were essential to the protection of the town...<br>
<br>
Keyes then returned up the Sound to procure a howitzer from the fort, when Leschi, divining, that his capture had been determined upon, withdrew himself to the shades of the Puyallup, where shells could not reach him.<br>
<br>
Captain Gansevoort took command of the Decatur on the 10th of December, 1855, three days after she had received an injury by striking on a reef, then unknown, near Bainbridge Island, and it became necessary to remove her battery on shore while repairing, her keel, a labor which occupied nearly three weeks, or until January 19th, when her guns were replaced.<br>
<br>
Very soon after a young Dwamish, called Jim noti<B>fied Gansevoort that</B> Indians from the east side of the mountains, under Owhi, had united with those on the west side under Coquilton, with the design of dividing their forces into two columns, and making a simultaneous attack on Steilacoom and Seattle, after destroying which they expected to make easy work of the other settlements.<br>
<br>
The plan might have succeeded as first conceived, Hewitt's company being disbanded about this time, and the Decatur being drawn up on the beach; but some Indian scout having carried information of the condition of the man-of-war to the chiefs, it was decided that the capture of the ship, which was supposed to be full of powder, would be the quickest means of destroying the white race, and into this scheme the so-called friendly Indians had entered with readiness.<br>
<br>
Gansevoort, feeling confident that he could rely upon Jim's statement, prepared to meet the impending blow. The whole force of the Decatur was less thai 150 men and officers.  Of these a small company was left on board the ship, while 96 men, eighteen <B>sailors </B>and five officers did guard duty on shore.<br>
<br>
Seattle at this time occupied a small peninsula formed by the bay in front, and a wide and deep swamp at the foot of the heavily wooded hills behind.  The connection of the peninsula with the country back was by a narrow neck of land at the north end of the <B>town, </B>and the Indian trail to lakes Washington and Union came in almost directly opposite Yesler's <B>mill </B>and wharf, where a low piece of ground had been filled in with sawdust.<br>

The only other avenue <B>from</B> the back country was by a narrow sand-spit on the south side of the Marsh, which was separated from the <B>town </B>only by a <B>small </B>stream.<br>
<br>
Thus the <B>lone line</B><B> </B>of defence was actually afforded by the swamp and the points requiring a guard were those in front of the sand-spit and the lake trail; and it was thus that Gansevoort disposed of his force, three divisions being placed to guard the southern entrance, which was most exposed, and one directly across the northern trail.<br>
<br>
For two nights guard had been maintained, when on the 24th the Active reappeared at Seattle, having on board Captain Keyes, Special Agent Simmons, <B>and</B> Governor Stevens,just arrived from east of the mountains after his escape from the hostile combination in that country.  It does not appear in the narratives whether or not they had a howitzer on board.  Leschi, at all events, had already left the reservation.<br>
<br>
Next day the Active proceeded down the Sound to visit the other reservations, and learn the condition <B>and </B>temper of the Indians under the care of agents, and Captain Gansevoort continued his system of guard-posting.<br>
<br>
On the beach above Yesler's <B>mill, </B>and not far from where the third division, under Lieutenant Phelps, was stationed, was the camp of a chief of the Dwamish tribe, <B>known </B>to the white settlers as <B>Curley,</B> though his proper name was Suequai-dle, who professed the utmost friendship for his civilized neighbors, and was usually regarded as honest in his professions, the officers of the Decatur reposing much <B>confidence </B>in him.<br>
<br>
On the afternoon of the 25th another chief from the lake district east of Seattle, called Tecumseh, came into town with all his people, claiming protection against the hostile Indians, who, he said, threatened him with destruction should he not join them in the war upon the settlers.  He was kindly received, and assigned an encampment at the  south end of town, not far from where the first, second, and fourth divisions were stationed, under lieutenants Drake, Hughes, and Morris, respectively.<br>
<br>
At five o'clock in the afternoon the Decatur crew repaired to their stations, and about eight o'clock Phelps observed, sauntering past, two unknown Indians, of whom be demanded their names and purpose, to which they carelessly answered that they were Lake Indians, and had been visiting at Curley's encampment.  They were ordered to keep within their own satisfied with their appearance, had  his suspicions still further aroused by the sound of owl-hootings in three different directions, which had the regularity of humans, and which he decided to be such.<br>

This impression he reported to headquarters at Yesler's house, and Curley was despatched to reconnoitre.  At ten 0'clock he brought the assurance that there were no Indians in the neighborhood, and no attack need be apprehended during that night.<br>
<br>
Two hours after this report was given, a conference was held at Curley's lodge, between Leschi, Owhi, Tecumsah, and Yark-Keman, or Jim, in which the plan was arranged for an immediate attack on the town, the 'friendly' Indians to prevent the escape of the people to the ships in the bay, while the warriors, assembled to the number of <B>more </B>than a thousand in the woods which covered the hills back of town, made the assault.<br>
<br>
By this method they expected to be able to destroy every creature on shore between two o'clock and daybreak, after which they could attack the vessels.<br>
<br>
Fortunately for the inhabitants of Seattle and the Decatur,'s crew, Jim was present at this council as a spy, and  not<br>
as a conspirator.  He saw that he needed time to put Gansevoort on his guard, and while pretending to assent to the general plan, convinced the other chiefs that a better time for attack would be when the Decatur's men, instead of being on guard, had retired to rest after a night's watch.<br>
<br>
Their plans being at length definitely settled, Jim found an opportunity to convey a warning to the officers of the Decatur.<br>
<br>
The time fixed upon for the attack was ten o'clock, when the families, who slept at the blockhouse, had returned to their own houses and were defenseless, "with the gun standing behind the door," as the conspirators, who had studied the habits of the pioneers, said to each other.<br>
<B><br>
</B><br>
During the hours between the conference at Curley's lodge and daylight, the Indians had crept up to the very borders of the town, and grouped their advance in squads concealed near each house. At 7 o'clock the Decatur's men returned to the ship to breakfast and rest.  At the same time it was observed by Phelps that the non-combatants of Curley's camp were hurrying into canoes taking with them their property.<br>
<br>
On being interrogated as to the cause of their flight, the mother of Jim, apparently in a great fright, answered in a shrill scream, "Hiu Klikitat copa Tom Pepper's house! hi-hi-hiu Klikitati"-that is to say, "There are hosts of Klikitats at Tom Pepper's house," which was situated just at the foot of the hills where the sand-spit joined the mainland, and which was within range of Morris howitzer.<br>
<br>

Instead of being allowed to breakfast, the men were immediately sent ashore again, and given leave to get what rest they could in the loft of Yesler's mess-house, where refreshments were sent to them, while Captain Gansevoort ordered a shell dropped into Tom Pepper's house, to make the Indians show themselves if there.<br>
<br>
The effect was all that could have been anticipated.  The boom of the gun had not died away when the blood-curdling war-whoop burst from a thousand stentorian throats, accompanied by a crash of musketry from the entire Indian line. Instantly  the four<br>
divisions dashed  to  their  stations,  and  the  battle  was<br>
begun by Phelps' division charging up the hill east of Yesler's mill, while those at the south end of town were carrying out a long-range duel across the creek or slough in that quarter.<br>
<br>
Those of the citizens who were prepared also took part in the defence of the place.  Astonished by the readiness of the white men and the energy of the charge, the Indians were driven to the brow of the hill, and the men had time to retreat to their station before the enemy recovered from the shock.<br>
<br>
Had not the howitzer been fired just when it was, in another moment the attack would have been made without warning, and all the families nearest the approaches butchered before their defenders could have reached them; but the gun provoking the savage war cry betrayed their close proximity to the homes of the citizens, who, terrified by the sudden and frightful clamor, fled wildly to the block-house, whence they could see the flames of burning buildings on the outskirts.<br>
<br>
A lad named Milton Holgate, brother of the first settler of King count<B>y, </B>was shot while standing at the door of the block-house early in the action, and Christian White at a later hour in another part of the town.<br>
<br>
Above the other noises of the battle could be heard the cries of the Indian women, urging on the warriors to greater efforts; but although they continued to yell and to fire with great persistency, the range was too long from the points to which the Decatur's guns soon drove them to permit of their doing any execution; or if a few came near enough to hit one of the Decatur's men, they were more likely to be hit by the white marksmen.<br>
<br>
ASSAULT REPULSED.                     <B><br>
<br>
</B>About noon there was a lull, while the Indians rested and feasted on the beef of the settlers. During this interval the women and children were taken on board the vessels in the harbor, after which an attempt was made to gather from the suddenly deserted dwellings the most valuable of the property contained in them before the Indians should have the opportunity, under the cover of
night, of robbing and burning them.<br>
<br>
This attempt was resisted by the Indians, the board houses being pierced by numerous bullets while visited for this purpose; and the attack upon the town was renewed, with an attempt on the part of Coquilton to bear down upon the third division in such numbers as to annihilate it, and having done this, to get in the rear of the others.<br>
<br>
At a preconcerted signal the charge was made, the savages plunging through the bushes until within a few paces before they fired, the volley delivered by them doing no harm, while the little company of fourteen marines met them so steadily that they turned to shelter themselves behind logs and trees, in their characteristic mode of<br>
of fighting.<br>
<br>
Had they not flinched from the muzzles of those-fourteen guns-had they thrown themselves on those few men with ardor, they would have blotted them out of existence in five minutes by sheer weight of numbers. But such was not to be, and Seattle was Saved by the recoil.<br>
<br>
As if to make up for having lost their opportunity, the Indians showered bullets upon or over the beads of the man-of-war's men, to whose assistance during the afternoon came four young men from Meigs' mill, the ship's surgeon, Taylor, and two others,<br>
adding a third to-this command, besides which a twelve-pounder field-gun was brought into position on the round, a discharge from which dislodged the most troublesome of the enemy in that quarter.<br>
<br>
In the midst of the afternoon's work, Curley, who had been disappointed so far of his opportunity to make himself a place in history , and becoming excited by the din of battle, suddenly appeared upon the scene, arrayed in, fighting costume, painted, armed with a musket and a bow in either hand, which he held ex-
tended, and yelling like a demon, pranced oddly about on the sawdust, more ludicrous than fear-inspiring, until, having exhausted some of his bravado, he as suddenly disappeared, thus giving testimony that his friendship for the white race was no greater than his courage.<br>
<br>
This defiance of his quondam  friends came from anticipating an occasion to distinguish himself at a later hour of the day.  Toward evening the assailing Indians were discovered placing bundles of inflammable materials under and about the deserted houses, preparatory to a grand conflagration in the evening, by the light of which the Indians on the reservation and those in the two camps on the beach at Seattle were to assist in attacking and destroying the blockhouse with its inmates.<br>

This information, being gathered by scouts, was brought to Gausevoort in time, who resorted to shelling the town as a means of dispersing the incendiaries, which proved successful, and by ten o'clock at night firing had ceased on both sides.<br>
<br>
Shells had much more influence with the savages than cannon-balls; for they could understand how so large a ball might fell a tree in their midst, but they could not comprehend how a ball which had alighted on the ground, and lain still until their curiosity prompted an examination, should 'Shoot again' of itself with such destructive force.<br>
<br>
What they could not understand must be supernatural, hence the evil spirits which they had invoked against the white people had turned against themselves, and it was useless to resist them.<br>
<br>
In short, they felt the heavy hand of fate against them, and bowed submissive to its decree.  When the morning of the 27th dawned the hostile force had disappeared, taking what cattle they could find; "the sole results," says Phelps, whom I have chiefly followed in the narration of the attack on Seattle, "of an expedition which it had taken months to perfect, and looking to the utter annihilation of the white settlers in that section of the, country."<br>
<br>
I have it from the same authority that news if the attack was received at Bellingham Bay, a hundred miles distant, in seven hours from its commencement, showing the interest taken in the latter by the tribes all along the Sound.  Their  combination was to depend upon the success of the movement by Leschi and Owhi, and it failed; therefore they concealed their complicity in it, and remained neutral.<br>
<br>
Leschi, however, affected not to be depressed by the reverse he had sustained, but sent a boastful message to Captain Gansevoort that in another month, when he should have replenish his commissary department, he would return and destroy Seattle.  This seeming not at all improbable, it was decided to erect fortifications sufficiently ample to prevent any sudden attack whereupon H. L. Yesler contributed a cargo of sawed lumber with which to erect barricades between the town and the wooded hills back of it.<br>
<br>
This work was commenced on the 1st of February and soon completed. It consisted of two wooden wall, five feet in height and a foot and a half apart, filled with earth and sawdust solidly packed to make it bullet-proof." A second block-house was also erected on the summit of a ridge which commanded a view of the town and vicinity, and which was armed with a rusty cannon taken formerly from some ship, and a  six-pounder field-piece taken from the Active, which returned to Seattle on hearing of the attack.<br>

All esplanade was constructed at the south end of the town <B>in </B>order to enable the guns stationed there to sweep the shore and prevent approach by the enemy from the water-front; clearing, and road-building being carried on to make the place defensible, which greatly improved its appearance as a town.<br>

BATTLE OF SEATTLE.<br>
<br>
Dorothy Fay Gould, "The Battle of Seattle," <B>Beyond the shining mountains.</B> Portland, Oregon: Binfords and Mort, 1938. p.173-177.<br>
<br>
In 1856 Seattle numbered about one hundred and fifty persons and thirty houses, including churches, a hotel, five or six stores,  a blacksmith and carpenter shop and the mill.  It seemed to the Indians that an attack would easily wipe out such a village.<br>
<br>
Old Chief Leschi, whose name is commemorated in Leschi Park, planned<br>
to attack Seattle and Steilacoom at the same time and massacre the scattered settlers living between the two towns. In the forests along Lake Washington the Indians gathered from over the mountains.<br>
<br>
From this ambush just at breakfast time early one January morning they charged down the Lake Trail upon the town.  Those who could fled to the two block houses. Others retreated behind stumps. One housewife dropped her pan of hot biscuits into her apron and ran with her baby to the blockhouse.  Mrs. Blaine, the minister's young wife, with her three-day-old baby, was carried in a rocker.<br>
<br>
Out on the sawdust waterfront appeared an Indian, Old Curley, perfectly hideous in his war dress, smeared with paint, yelling frantically as he danced up and down. Shrill screams from the Indian women hidden in the wilderness urged warriors on.<br>
<br>
The United States ship, Decatur, had recently run on a rock off Bainbridge Island  and by the greatest of good luck, it was anchored off the town where it had just been repaired.  Soon shells were shrieking from the ship's howitzer, and the fierce ping of rifle shots marked the hiding place of the marines who had been sent ashore.<br>
<br>
By ten o'clock in the evening the last gun was fired, and the battle of Seattle was among the things of the past.  The night
after the battle a henhouse sheltered twelve sentinels whose usefulness may be imagined after Mr. Plummer, proprietor of a village store, "turned an honest penny" by furnishing them unlimited numbers of "two-bit" drinks of "rifle whiskey".<br>
<br>
Among the farmers who lived in the woods between Steilacoom and Seattle, the troubles were worse than in the village.  The blanket Indians were frequent visitors at one such cabin, the Jones'.  One morning Nelson, one of <B>them, </B>came and said it would not be long until the Indians were gone and the white men had all the land.<br>
<br>
This warning statement was overlooked.  Sunday, <B>Oc</B>tober 28, 1855, when the step-father was in bed with pleurisy, and the mother, hired man and three children t breakfast, there was a peculiar grunt at the were a door.  When Mrs. Jones opened it she and the children looked directly into the muzzle of a gun.  With a scream she closed and fastened the door.  The Indians came toward the house whooping and jumping and swinging their tomahawks.<br>
<br>
She hid the children in the feather bed.  Staggering to the door the father attempted to aid in the defense but was shot to death.  The hired man tried in vain to go for help.  When the cabin was broken into the children huddled about Nelson, the Chief, who seemed to be directing the massacre.  He ordered them to go off to a neighbor's.<br>
<br>
While the Indians were setting the house ablaze, little Johnny King, seven-year-old stepson of Mr. Jones, hid his brother and sister nearby and then went to a neighboring settler's cabin where he found the door open, chairs and tables scattered about, pillows ripped open and feathers flying.  Unsuccessful in his search for help, he went back for his brother and sister and took them back to the ruins of their own home.  The Indians were gone.<br>
<br>
The children found some potatoes from the store-house nicely roasted and streams of butter flowing from the charred firkins upon which they made a meal.  While cautiously looking about, Johnny discovered his mother near death.  She urged him as best she could to take the children through the forest to the neighbor's house where they had attended school.<br>
<br>
Near the ashes of their cabin they met Tom, a friendly Indian, who hid them.  His squaw fed the children dried fish and berries, and that night they were taken in a canoe to the Decatur.  Dr. Maynard was appointed their guardian until an uncle came and took them to Wisconsin.<br>
<br>
The boy was old enough so that he could never again feel friendly toward the Indians.  He could remember every minute detail of his horrible experience.  It was many years later, as Dr. John King, that he told what had happened.<br>
<br>
But the trouble with the Indians was by no means over.  It was
some time before "the moccasin steps of the red man were turned back into the wilderness to be obliterated." The white men did not agree on how to meet the Indian troubles.  The squaw men, white settlers who had Indian wives, were suspected of siding with the Indians and Governor Stevens ordered them removed from their farms to the blockhouses until the trouble was over.<br>
<br>
The fate of the settlement on Puget Sound hung on the presence of four war vessels, the Decatur, the Massachusetts, the Active, and the John Hancock. The coast Indians began to understand the hopelessness of their cause.<br>
<br>
But east of the mountains the tribes fought longer; the war dragged on for two more years.  For ten years thereafter, the white settlers were ordered out of Eastern Washington.  General Wool, commander of the Division of the Pacific, spoke of this portion of the country as a natural Indian reservation.<br>
<br>
Eventually Chief Leschi was betrayed for fifty blankets by his nephew, Sluggia.  In turn, Sluggia was killed by the Indians.  When Leschi was delivered to Governor Stevens, feeling ran high, but several trials failed to result in dismissal or death.<br>
<br>
The first judge instructed the jury that if the killing had been an act of war, Leschi was not guilty.  The murder trials dragged out but finally the square-built savage with piercing dark brown eyes was hanged on February 19, 1858.<br>
<br>
In his last speech he said, "I have supposed the killing of armed men in war time was not murder; if it was, the soldiers who killed Indians were guilty of murder, too.  I went to war because I believed the Indians had been wronged by the white men and I did everything in my power to beat the Boston soldiers.  For lack of numbers, supplies and ammunition I have failed".<br>
<br>
He prayed for fifteen minutes.  His last words were that he had on whom he invoked the malice toward none save one,<br>
vengeance of Heaven.<br>

BATTLE OF SEATTLE.<br>
<br>
Jalmar Johnson, "The Battle of Seattle," <B>Builders of the Northwest.</B> New York: Dodd, Mead, and Company, 1963, p. 105-107.<br>
<br>
In 1854 two Indians were convicted of the murder of a white man
named McCormick, crewman on a lumber schooner.  The trial was held in the cook house.  The community's first lynching followed.  It, too, started in the cook house, being planned there by hotheaded settlers and sailors from a vessel then in the bay.  The sailors furnished block and tackle from their ship.<br>
<br>
Then, along with the violent settlers, they broke into a cabin where the Indians were being held and hanged them to a tree near Yesler's mill.  At a later trial the ringleaders of the "necktie party" were acquitted.  Trouble that had been brewing for some time with the Indians was thus brought to a head.<br>
<br>
The Sound Indians were usually peaceable, but more aggressive tribesmen from east of the Cascades egged them on to make a stand against the white man's intrusion.  It was their last chance, now that their backs were to the Pacific.  Dissatisfaction was strong among the Indians because of treaties that Isaac I. Stevens, first territorial governor, had induced them to sign.  The result was the Seattle Indian "war" of 1855-56.<br>
<br>
During this terrifying crisis Yesler played a major part in saving the settlement.  He bad employed Indians as well as white men in bis mill and had treated them well.  They considered him a friend.  Salmon Bay Curley was particularly friendly toward the mill operator.  From time to time Henry gave Curley small quantities of ammunition and tobacco.  These the Indian in turn traded to unfriendly Indians, who had already murdered some settlers on the Duwamish, in exchange for information.<br>
<br>
By January 25, 1856, one thousand Klickitats from east of the mountains had been ferried across Lake Washington by Sound Indians.  They were advancing through the woods toward the settlement.  Curley and another friendly native, Indian Jim, managed to sit in on a council of war held that evening by hostile chiefs.<br>
<br>
The first plan was to attack the settlers at two o'clock in the morning.  But Indian Jim pointed out that marines from the sloop-of-war Decatur, which had been standing off the shore for some days, were on guard duty in the settlement at that hour.  A better time to attack, he argued, was at the end of the night watch when the marines had gone back aboard the Decatur for breakfast, leaving the settlement unguarded.<br>
<br>
Curley then pleaded that Henry Yesler's life be spared, because he had given the Indians work in his mill, but the hostile chiefs asserted that all whites must die.<br>
<br>
The plan almost succeeded.  The marines, as Indian Jim had foretold, went aboard the warship at daybreak.  The hostile Indians crept to the edge of the forest poised for the attack.  But somehow Indian Jim managed to elude them and brought word to the settlement of the impending disaster.<br>

Yesler was notified at once; he paddled hurriedly out to the Decatur where the marines were just sitting down to breakfast.  They were sent ashore again, their hunger unappeased.<br>
<br>
A howitzer, set up on shore, was fired at the place where the Indians were believed to be congregated.  The Decatur's batteries raked the edge of the forest, and the marines and volunteers exchanged volleys with the concealed natives.  Settlers, including women and children, ran in panic to a recently built blockhouse while this shooting was going on.  All made it safely.<br>
<br>
That night the Indians retreated, burning outlying cabins as they went.<br>
<br>
A return of the hostiles was expected, so the settlers prepared for a long siege.  They decided to build a stockade around the whole town.  Henry Yesler supplied the lumber for this elaborate defense.  Two fences five feet high and a foot and a half apart were constructed of closely placed boards.  The space between them wa.9 filled with sawdust.  The settlers were sure their fort was bullet proof, but fortunately it was never tested.  The Indians did not attack again.<br>
<br>
The miller had, however, yet another part to play before the Indian danger could be considered ended.  Because of his friendship with them, he served as an emissary to the tribesmen skulking in the woods east of Lake Washington.  He paddled across the lake, found the war parties in their hiding places and persuaded them to give themselves up to be placed on reservations.<br>

BATTLE OF SPOKANE PLAINS<br>
<br>
Robert M. Utley, "The Battle of Spokane Plains," Frontiersmen in Blue, the United States Army and the Indian. 1848-1865. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1967. p. 207-210.<br>
<br>
After a three-day rest, the [ Wright ] expedition took up the march on September 5. Leaving the lakes behind, the column strung out over a plain fringed on the east by a strip of pine concealing rocky, ravine-scored slopes.  From here some five to seven hundred warriors emerged to challenge the advance.  Wright promptly closed up, oblique toward the timber, and threw Keyes's battalion to the right and left in skirmish formation.<br>
<br>
The Indians fired the grass and, behind a wall of billowing smoke, curled around Wright's front and flank.  Dashing through the flames, the riflemen again outgunned the attackers and drove them back to the timber.  The artillery crew threw the howitzers into battery and shelled the trees.  A bursting round sent a limb crashing down on Kamiakin, severely injuring the fugitive chief.<br>
<br>
Through the forested ravines the infantry advanced from one position to another for four miles, overcoming all resistance and driving the enemy once more into the open.  Grier's waiting dragoons slammed into them with pistol and saber.  The Indian force disintegrated into small groups that scattered over the plain and into the timber to continue harassing the column as it crawled toward Spokane River.<br>
<br>
Repeatedly Wright flung out a company or unlimbered the howitzers to break up a pocket of resistance or sweep a hill of a menacing gathering.  That night he camped on the river bank below Spokane Falls, the fires of his adversary's camps plainly visible upstream.<br>
<br>
The Battle of Spokane Plain, extending over a distance of twenty-five waterless miles, had been a grueling test of endurance.  For the second time the Indians had been thrown back, although this time their loss was not estimated.  One soldier was wounded, and all had neared the threshold of exhaustion; but all, too, 'took deep satisfaction in the damage inflicted on those who had routed Steptoe and so boldly challenged Wright.<br>
<br>
Wright had knocked all the fight out of the hostile tribes.  Within two days after the Battle of Spokane Plain he had received peace overtures.  His response was uncompromising, and underscoring it he slaughtered nine hundred captured ponies belonging to a Palouse chief.<br>

For the next three weeks the expedition wound its way through the hostile country-up the Spokane, around Lake Coeur d'Alene, and down to the Palouse.  Father Joseph Joset labored diligently among the Indians to bring about submission to U.S. authority.<br>
<br>
On September 17 Wright conferred with the principal chiefs of the Coeur d'Alenes, on the twenty-third with the Upper and Middle Spokanes, and during the last week of the month with the Palouses.  Each tribe placed itself without reservation at the colonel's mercy.  From each he singled out culprits accused of depredations and of inciting the attacks on Steptoe.  Altogether, including four Walla Wallas considered trouble makers, Wright hanged fifteen men, and others he placed in irons.<br>
<br>
Kamiakin had almost been persuaded to give up, but at the last moment he wisely backed down and with Skloom lost himself in the Rockies.  Not so fortunate were Kamiakin's brother in law Owhi and Owhi's son Qualchin.  Never one of the fire-eating Hostiles, Owhi 
came <B>in </B>to make his peace with Colonel Wright, whom he recalled favorably from the 156 campaign.<br>
<br>
Wright seized him and forced him on penalty of death to summon Qualchin.  When Qualchin appeared, he was summarily hanged.  Later in the march, the embittered Owhi tried to escape.  Lashing Lieutenant Michael R. Morgan across the face with a horsewhip, he made a dash for safety.  Morgan lodged three pistol balls in his body, and Sergeant Ball put a fourth through his head.<br>
<br>
After detaching a detail to clean up the Steptoe battlefield and recover the buried howitzers, Wright's victorious troops headed south, their mission accomplished beyond any shadow of doubt.  On October 5 they marched into Fort Walla Walla and proudly paraded for Inspector General Mansfield.  The next day the officers gathered for a "handsome collation" in honor of the visiting brass and of a campaign that would feed the fond reminiscences of its participants for the rest of their lives.<br>
<br>
Colonel Wright had organized and conducted the "Expedition against the Northern Indians" with a skill that stamped him as one of the Army's ablest regimental commanders and with an insight into Indian character that testified to lessons learned in the Yakima War.<br>
<br>
Contributing significantly to his triumph were an uncommonly superior officer corps of whom Keyes, Ord, Gregg, and Robert 0. Tyler became Union major generals and Winder, Davidson, and Pender wore Confederate general's stars; an efficient quartermaster department presided over with rare competence by Captain Ralph W. Kirkham; the new rifled shoulder weapons, whose range and fire power came as an unhappy and costly surprise to the Indians; and above all the Indian decision to fight, which gave him two conclusive victories in place of an inconclusive tour of the
Spokane country.<br>
<br>
Wright's peremptory treatment of the hostiles after their defeat in battle, especially the execution of Qualchin, exposed him to some criticism.  But as the perceptive E. S. Curtis has remarked, "If in the march of civilization the Indians were to be dispossessed of their lands . . .decisive measures were more humane than the temporizing policy of the army in the trouble with the Yakima."<br>
<br>
A year later Delegate Isaac Stevens at last won ratification<br>
of the 1855 treaties, and all the tribes involved in the wars of 1856 and 1858 accepted the inevitable.  Reservation life proved fully as unhappy as they had expected, but the memory of Colonel Wright hung over them, and never again did they try to deflect their destiny by force of arms.<br>
<br>
Twelve years later an agent of the Indian Bureau found Kamiakin living with a small band south of the new town of Spokane.  He "is a large, powerful man, about fifty years old, and six feet high," wrote the investigator; "he is peaceable, but does not go much among the whites, and seems broken-hearted, having lost his former energy. In him as in those he had led, the martial flame had been smothered by the heavy hand of Colonel Wright.<br>
<br>
Military operations in the Pacific Northwest during the late 1850s, in contrast to those elsewhere in this period, were notably conclusive.  The people against whom Colonel Buchanan campaigned suffered a disaster so final that they all but vanished as identifiable groups.<br>
<br>
Those on whom Colonel Wright made war met military defeat permanent in its effect.  Never again would these Indians defy the alien force shaping their destiny.  Never again would the settlers spreading over the fertile valleys west of the Cascades and the rolling plains of eastern Washington have cause to fear serious Indian trouble.<br>
<br>
For this result the Regular Army could claim only partial credit.  In the campaign of 1858 against the "Northern Indians," adequate manpower and logistical support combined with competent leadership had indeed contributed importantly.  But in the earlier hostilities of 1855-56, which occurred closer to population centers, the<br>
Regulars never gained the initiative from volunteer forces expressing the attitudes of the passionately involved citizens and their political leaders.<br>
<br>
Unwilling to embrace extermination policies, unable to control the civilian forces that were, the federal military establishment played a secondary role in ridding western Oregon and Washington of the Indian menace.
And yet for the finality of their conquest the Indians themselves bore a large responsibility.  Elsewhere Indian resistance was usually a rather diffuse, unplanned response to a threat only dimly perceived.<br>
<br>
A few raids and skirmishes took place, and even a battle if it could not be avoided, but rarely was there any inclination to resolve the issue by a formal test of arms.  For the tribes of the Pacific Northwest, however, the threat was so real and so immediate that they perceived it with unusual clarity.  They resorted to war consciously and with fairly well-defined aims.<br>
<br>
In its conduct they gravitated increasingly from the guerrilla style harassment that so confounded their adversary to the open battlefield encounter that permitted his superior numbers, arms, and military organization to prevail.  By fighting on the enemy's terms, they contributed significantly to the totality of their defeat.<br>
<br>
Rarely would the U.S. Army again grapple with Indians willing to concede such advantages.  But rarely, too, would the Army again have to conduct operations under such disadvantages of hostile public opinion and conflicting civil policy.<br>

BATTLE OF SPOKANE PLAINS<br>
<br>
Jack Dodd, "The Soldiers have theirs; Spokane Plains," <B>Great Western Indian Fights.</B> by the Members of the Potomac Corral of The Westerners, Washington D.C. Garden City, New York: Doubleday and Company, 1960, p. 65-72.<br>
<br>
The troops rested at the Four Lakes campsite for three days. They broke camp early on September 5 and moved northward to fight a battle which is officially listed as the 'Battle of Spokane Plans.-<br>
<br>
After a five-mile march an open plain or prairie was reached.  Mounted Indians were discovered moving parallel to the column about three miles distant from the right flank.  Their speed indicated they were attempting to intercept the column before it reached the pine forest across the north end of the prairie.<br>
<br>
The column, especially the long pack train, was closed up without delaying the forward movement.  The Indians were observed setting fire to the grass at points in advance and to the right of the column.<br>

Three artillery companies were deployed as skirmishers to the front and to the right of the main column.  These were Ord's K Company, Tyler's A Company, and Gibson's M Company.  Captain Hardie's G Company of artillery was deployed to the left at the same time.<br>
<br>
The two howitzers supported by E Company, Ninth Infantry, were also advanced to the line of skirmishers.  There was a brisk interchange of fire.  The entire command was about to be enveloped by the grass fires which had spread into a single "wall of fire."<br>
<br>
Colonel Wright ordered an advance, and the skirmishers, the howitzer units, and Captain Grier's dragoons moved forward through the flames.  The Indians fled to the shelter of thee rocks and trees in the pine forest when they saw that the flames had not stopped the soldiers.  They retreated still farther when shelled by the howitzer.  As they retreated, they were followed by the skirmishers and the dragoons.<br>
<br>
At this point the border of the plain had been reached.  Ahead were rocky hills and gullies covered with an open ponderosa pine forest The line of skirmishers was ahead of the main column and the entire command was in a T formation.  The skirmishers formed the cross-bar and the column the stem of the T.<br>
<br>
The trail the column had followed so far that day had led almost due north, but now it turned sharply about seventy degrees to the right.  The main column turned to follow the trail.  By this time most of the skirmishers had already passed the turning point, and when the column behind them changed directions, they did not.<br>
<br>
This turning movement placed all of the skirmishers except M Company on the left flank.  Most of the Indians who bad been in front of the skirmishers were now concentrated on the left flank as a result of this turning movement, and the moving column was not subjected to enemy fire most of its length.  The right flank of the column faced the  open plain, but no Indians were near.<br>
<br>
The Skirmishers on the left flank advanced away from the column and  drove the Indians ahead of them.  The main body halted about two miles past the turn to permit most of the skirmishers to return to the column.  Up to this time Lieutenant Gibson's M Company had protected the right flank.  Later when a group of Indians formed on this flank Captain Crier with the two dragoon companies, C and I, passed through the skirmishers of Gibson's company and charged the Indians.  Two Indians were killed and three wounded.<br>
<br>
When the march continued, Captain Ord's company remained on the extreme left of the skirmishers.  His company charged when the scattered opposition consolidated, and drove them from three high table rocks where they had taken refuge.  He continued to pursue them along the flanks until he overtook the main column.  His company then assigned a position on the left flank assisted by M
Company and the howitzers.  In the meantime B Company had kept the Indians away on the right flank.<br>
<br>
The command continued to the Spokane River, <B>continually</B> driving the Indians on ahead, and meeting with little resistance.  When the troops camped on the river, at a site now within the present Fort George Wright Military Reservation, they had completed a march of twenty-five miles from the previous camp.  Over fourteen miles of this distance had consisted of a marching fight of seven hours' duration.<br>
<br>
Every man who had left the Four Lakes Camp arrived at the camp on the Spokane River.  Not one had been killed and only one was wounded slightly.  Indian losses in the Battle of Spokane Plains are not known.  Two chiefs and two brothers of Chief Garry of the Spokanes are known to have been fatalities, besides many Indians of lesser note either killed or wounded.  It is alleged that Chief Kamiakin of the Yakimas was wounded by the flying debris from a nearby hit of a howitzer shell.<br>
<br>
The troops were tired from their long marching fight and rested all the next day.  During this day some Indians indicated from across the river their desire to talk to Colonel Wright.  Arrangements were made to meet them the following day at the ford two miles above Spokane Falls.  On September 7 the command moved to the ford, where Chief Garry told Colonel Wright that he regretted that his people had fought the soldiers and that he had been unable to control his chiefs and warriors.<br>
<br>
The colonel bluntly told Garry that his people had been badly whipped in two battles in which they had suffered many losses, and that he himself had not lost a man or animal.  He further advised Garry that he had come into the country of the Spokanes to fight, and if the Spokanes now wanted peace he would tell them what to do. He added if they did not want peace be would wage war until they were exterminated.  He then told Garry to return to his people, and to tell them what he had said.<br>
<br>
After Garry had left, another Spokane, Chief Polotldn, came to parley accompanied by nine warriors.  The colonel kept Polotldn as a hostage because be had been active in all the recent fights.  One of his warriors was taken into custody.  He was suspected of being implicated in the lulling of the two miners whose murder bad been reported by Steptoe.  This warrior was hanged several days later when his guilt was determined.<br>
<br>
The remaining warriors were told to assemble for a council with Wright. While the command was moving up the Spokane River, a great cloud of dust was investigated, and the soldiers discovered a large herd of horses being driven away from the route of the command.  It was pursued, and over eight hundred horses were captured.  
It was later determined that this herd was the entire wealth of Chief Tilcoax, whose band of Palouses had been guilty of hostilities for several years and were responsible for many of the horse and cattle-stealing raids upon the Walla Walla Valley.  These later crimes had been freely admitted by Tilcoax to Steptoe during the latter's expedition in May.<br>
<br>
What to do with the herd presented a problem.  A board was convened.  It decided that killing was the only practical way to dispose of them.  During the first day of this operation the horses were killed individually, but as this proved too slow a method, the slaughtering on the second day was accomplished by massed volleys of rifle fire into the corralled herd.<br>
<br>
While the command was disposing of the animals, a communication was received from Father Joset in which be reported that the hostiles were suing for peace.  He also advised that the friendly Indians were overjoyed by the victories of the soldiers.  The former had expected to be sacrificed if the hostiles won, because they had not joined them on the warpath.  The colonel wrote Father Joset to gather all the Indians at his mission for a talk.<br>
<br>
On the night of September 13 when the command arrived at the Coeur d'Alene Mission, they found most of the Coeur d'Alene tribe assembled to meet with Colonel Wright.  Some of the hostiles had fled eastward with other recalcitrant chiefs, including Kamiakin and Tilcoax.  The Coeur d'Alenes were repentant and most agreeable to the terms presented to them by Wright in a seven-point preliminary treaty.  On September 17, 1858, this treaty was signed by eighteen chiefs and sub-chiefs representing all but six or eight bands of the Coeur d'Alenes.<br>
<br>
In brief, the terms were: all hostilities should cease; all property of the United States should be surrendered immediately; those who had countenanced the fight with Steptoe should be surrendered; one chief and four men with their families should be given as hostages.<br>
<br>
All white men should be permitted to <B>travel</B> in Coeur d'Alene country unmolested, and no Indian hostile to the United States should be allowed within the limits of their country; the United States would remain at peace with the Coeur d'Alenes if the terms of the treaty were observed, and would return all prisoners and hostages unharmed within one year; a permanent treaty would be made when the articles had been complied with; and the treaty should also be extended to the Nez Perce Nation, as they had been allies of the United States.<br>
<br>
The Coeur d'Alene Mission was the farthest point east that the expedition visited.  To reach it they had marched 217 miles from Fort Walla.  On September 18 the troops left for a camp on Latah Creek, arriving there on September 22 after a 47-mile march.  The
Spokanes were assembled on Latah Creek when Colonel Wright arrived.<br>
<br>
Among them were Chiefs Garry and Polotkin of the Spokanes, Chief Milkapsi of the Coeur d'Alenes, and Father Joset.  Milkapsi had not been at the Coeur &Alene Mission, and now he wanted to sue for peace.  Father Joset had been working tirelessly for peace and at the conclusion of the council with the Spokanes, when he left to return to his mission, he was thanked profusely.<br>
<br>
It was reported that Kamiakin and Tilcoax had been at the camp of the Spokanes but had fled when the troops approached.  Chief Garry was sent to bring them back, but returned empty-handed because they refused to return with him.<br>
<br>
The council with the Spokanes was held on September 23, with 107 chiefs and warriors present.  Terms identical with those stated to the Coeur d'Alenes were specified by Colonel Wright, and the treaty was signed by 36 chiefs and other Indians, including Milkapsi.<br>
Owhi, the Yakima chief, came into camp the evening of the council.  He had not been considered trustworthy since Wright's Yakima campaign of 1856, because during the peace settlement he had failed to return with his people after promising to do so.<br>
<br>
Owhi, when placed in custody, told Wright that his son Qualchan was camped nearby.  A message was sent to Qualchan directing him to come to the camp, but he appeared before it would have been possible for the messenger to have reached him.  His record was so studded with killing, robberies, and attacks on the whites that he was hanged within fifteen minutes after entering the camp.<br>
<br>
It has been suggested that Kamiakin had sent him to the camp as a negotiator, since Qualchan cursed Kamiakin and accused him of treachery before he was executed.  His father, Owhi was fatally shot a few days later while attempting to escape.<br>
<br>
Captain Grier was sent on September 24 with three companies of dragoons to the Steptoe battlefield, which was situated about twelve miles southwest of the Latah Creek camp.  The two howitzers that had been buried on the hill were recovered.  The bodies of the personnel killed during the battle were found, and were removed for subsequent burial in the cemetery at Fort Walla.<br>
<br>
A large body of Palouse Indians came to the Latah Creek camp while Wright was waiting for Captain Grier to return.  They had participated in the recent fights but had decided to surrender after Kamiakin and Tilcoax had fled.  Fifteen of those who bad left their own country to fight the troops were seized and six of the most notorious were hanged.<br>

On the  twenty-sixth  the  troops  left  Latah  Creek  and  marched<br>
to the mouth of the Palouse River, arriving at that point on September 29.  While they were en route, Slowiarchy, a Palouse chief, came to Wright and told him that his young men had gone to war against his wishes.<br>
<br>
Slowiarchy was told to assemble his people for a meeting at the mouth of the Palouse.  At the council held there, Wright denounced the Indians severely.  He demanded that they should surrender the murderers of the two miners plus those guilty of stealing horses and cattle from the whites, and that all stolen property should be returned.<br>
<br>
The Palouses complied with his demands.  One of the murderers was banged.  Of the known cattle thieves, two had been hanged previously at the Latah Creek camp, and one had been lulled at Four Lakes.  Among the prisoners were three who were Walla Wallas or Yakimas.  They too were promptly hanged.<br>
<br>
Colonel Wright was more severe with the Palouses than he had been with the other conquered tribes.  He refused to sign a peace treaty with them at that time, but advised he would do so the next spring if their conduct was satisfactory.  He demanded that all white men must be allowed to travel unmolested in their country, and that all thieves and murderers not then available should be turned in.<br>
<br>
As a warning he advised that he would exterminate the whole tribe if be should be forced to return.<br>
<br>
The command arrived at Fort Taylor on October 2 and at Fort Walla Walla on October 5. The garrison at Fort Taylor accompanied Wright to Fort Walla Walla, and Fort Taylor was not used again.  The expedition had been a success.  The command had marched over four hundred miles; had fought two decisive battles; had lost no men in combat; had recovered stolen government property; had hanged eleven bad Indians; and bad completely pacified the Palouse, Spokane, and Coeur d'Alene Indians.<br>
<br>
Before Colonel Wright could return to garrison duty, he had one more Indian matter to settle.  He met with the Walla Wallas in a council and those who had fought in the recent battles were asked to stand up.  Thirty-five stood and four of the most notorious were immediately arrested.  These four were hanged without delay.<br>
<br>
The measures that Colonel Wright used to demonstrate to the Indians that he was determined to have peace in their territory<br>
were certainly not for the faint-hearted, but they did bring com-
plete pacification.<br>
<br>
Almost twenty years later, when both the Sioux and Nez Perce were at war with the United States, emissaries of those tribes tried to
solicit alliances from among the tribes concerned, but were flatly refused because the "hatchet was buried" by the Spokane, Palouse, and Coeur d'Alene Indians when they signed the peace treaties in 1858.<br>

BATTLE OF SPOKAN PLAIN<br>
<br>
Erasmus Darwin Keyes "The battle of Spokane Plain," <B>Fifty Years' observation of men and events.</B> New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1884. p. 270-276.<br>
<br>
The men and animals needed rest [after the Battle of Four Lakess]  we remained in camp at the Four Lakes until six o'clock on the morning of September 5, when we resumed our advance.  At first we saw no Indians, but at the end of an hour they began to show themselves, and to move along parallel with our line of march over the rough ground, beyond which was the great Spokan Plain.<br>
<br>
We had advanced. far within the prairie, when, all at once, we saw the savages setting fire to the tall dry grass with which the plain was covered nearly all around us.  A strong wind was blowing in our faces, and the flames were shooting high and constantly extending.<br>
<br>
Our situation was sufficiently alarming when we discovered, a few hundred yards to the front and left, a patch of bare rock and scant herbage.  Upon that we collected our animals in haste, and the drivers put out the fire on the short stubble, which gave room and saved us from a stampede.  Meanwhile the enemy had opened fire upon us, and our men passed through where the flames were least, Grier and his dragoons leading, and commenced the battle of Spokan Plains.<br>
<br>
That battle ended fourteen miles from where it began, and the field upon which it was fought embraced hills and ravines, woods, rocks, and bare level ground.  I kept one, and occasionally two, companies in close order, and the others deployed, so that my line of battle was often above a mile long.<br>
<br>
The woods and openings alternated in long strips, and riding at full speed to and fro, along the rear, enabled me to see the Indians when they passed across those openings, as they did frequently in both directions.  As soon as I saw them making to the right or the left, I ordered forward reinforcements to meet them wherever they opened fire.<br>

The activity and spirit displayed by the officers of my battalion left nothing to be desired.  They certainly did their best and did well.  It is not easy to discriminate, and I name them as they occur to my memory-Captains E. 0. C. Ord and J. A. Hardie, Lieutenants H. G. Gibson, R. P. Tyler, J.L. White, G. F.<br>
Ihrie, D. R. Ransom, B. Dandy, M. R. Morgan,  and my adjutant, Lawrence Kipp.<br>
<br>
There were probably 1,000 Indian warriors opposed to us, and among them were some of the Pend d'Oreilles and the famous Yackima chief, Kammiakin.   He was severely wounded by a splinter torn from a tree that was struck by one of White's howitzer shells.<br>
<br>
On our side not a man was killed, and only one wounded.  The loss of the enemy was considerable, but it could not bc ascertained, on account of their invariable habit of carrying away their killed and wounded.  The country fought over was without water, and when we reached the Spokan River, and pitched our camp, twenty-five miles distant from the former, the whole command, men and animals, were nearly exhausted.<br>
<br>
It was estimated that I had ridden eighty miles on the same pony of incredible endurance.  I kept my saddle till my tent was pitched; then I dismounted, took a glass of wine, gave orders not to disturb me, and lay down on my back to rest.<br>
<br>
For half an hour I did not move a muscle, and felt the whole time that if I did move one I should die.  At the end of an hour I was restored, and no one had noticed my debility.  Never before, or since, was I so nearly finished. by the toil of war.<br>
<br>
September 8.-Instead of crossing the Spokan River we kept up along the south bank over an extensive grassy plain.  As we advanced we saw a great cloud of dust rising up far ahead.  Then we discovered what we mistook for a patch of brown, bare earth on the side of the mountain, but by close watching we saw it move.  It was a band of cattle.<br>
<br>
After marching eight miles further, the train was halted and left in charge of Ord's and Gibson's companies of artillery and a company of dragoons.  Gregg's, with the balance of my command, I pushed forward, following Colonel Wright and staff, Grier's three companies of dragoons, and the Nez Perces guides.  I marched my foot-soldiers eighteen miles at quick time, without a halt, to the top of a range of hills.<br>
<br>
From their summit we discovered, far across a beautiful lake and plain, many moving specks, which were horses.  Grier had overtaken and captured them without opposition.  The band consisted of about 1,000 horses, mares, and colts, which were the property of a Tyee whose name was Tilcohitz; and he was a great thief and rascal.<br>
<br>
At first Colonel Wright and others were not disposed to kill the
horses, thinking them too valuable.  I told him I should not sleep so long as they remained alive, as I regarded them the main dependence and most prized of all the possessions of the Indians, who would find a way to stampede them.<br>
<br>
Finally the Colonel organized a board of officers, of which I was president, to determine what should be done with the horses.  The board decided to allow the officers and the quartermaster to select a certain number, and the friendly Indians were to choose one or two each, and in this way about 200 were disposed of for the present.<br>
<br>
For the others a high enclosure was constructed, the poor animals driven in, and the work of shooting commenced.  The soldiers soon learned that by planting a bullet just behind the ears the animal would drop dead at once.  In two days the number shot by actual tally was 690, and the expenditure of cartridges about twice as many.<br>
<br>
It was a cruel sight to see so many noble beasts shot down.  They were all sleek, glossy, and fat, and as I love a horse, I fancied I saw in their beautiful faces an appeal for mercy.  Towards the last the soldiers appeared to exult in their bloody task; and such is the ferocious character of men.<br>
<br>
While the work of destruction was going on I saw an Indian approaching our camp, carrying in his hand a long pole from which a strip of white cloth was flying and in  the cleft end of the pole was a letter.<br>
<br>
The letter was from Father Joset, S. J., of the Coeur d'Alene missions written to inform Colonel Wright that in consequence of our victories the hostiles were completely cast down, and that they wished him to be their intercessor for peace.  The father added in his communication that the friendlies were delighted at our victories, as they had been threatened with punishment by the hostiles for not fighting.<br>
<br>
On the 11th of September we crossed the Spokan, and ours was the first civilized army that ever passed that stream.  Our first march beyond was through a rich agricultural country, where we found many rude huts and numerous stacks of wheat.  The dragoons all fed their horses with wheat, and each carried away one or two sheaves.  The large balance we burned, so that desolation marked our tracks.<br>
<br>
We encamped on the edge of <B> </B>the beautiful Coeur d'Alene Lake, and after a tedious march over a narrow trail through the mountain forest we arrived, on the 13th, at the mission of the same name.<br>
The next day I visited the mission, which was established in 1846.  The church was built of logs, spacious, but unfinished.<br>
<br>
Everything within and around had a rustic appearance.  Father Joset, Father Minitrce, and two lay brothers were there.  In this savage, out-of-the-way place they were obliged to live and labor with the
aborigines.  In the evening I supped with the fathers.  They had plenty of excellent beef, vegetables, and milk, but the table and its service were as plain as possible.<br>
<br>
In Father Joset I found a cultivated gentleman in the prime of life, fit to adorn the most polished society in the world.  I was unable to restrain my expressions of astonishment when he informed me that he had passed the last fourteen years in the wilderness with the savages.<br>
<br>
I asked him if he had no longings for a better life and society.  " No," said he, " I am content and happy where I am.  In your profession an outward obedience to orders is all that is required of you, but in the society to which I belong obedience must be internal, and cheerful, and ready.  I am happy, and have no desire to exchange situations with any person."<br>
<br>
Twice every day while I remained at the mission I had conversations with Father Joset, which increased my admiration for his character and my estimation of his self-denial.  He instructed me how his Church had preserved the traditions and dogmas of Christianity, and sustained the purity of the faith, and it was primarily due to his influence that I enrolled myself, at a subsequent date, in the Roman Catholic Church.<br>
<br>
By his explanations and revelations Father Joset revealed to<br>
my mind vistas through which the light from Calvary shone more pure and brilliant than ever before.<br>
<br>
The hostiles who, in the beginning were so confident and audacious, finding, themselves absolutely powerless to resist us in the field, changed their policy and became the most humble supplicants for peace.  Large numbers came to the mission every day, and on the 17th of September a council was held at which ninety-five chiefs and head men were present, besides numerous squaws and pappooses.<br>
<br>
The terms of the treaty were not harsh, and old chief Polotkin was so much pleased that he assured Colonel Wright that all his people would cheerfully submit, which they subsequently did.<br>
<br>
Vincent, the principal chief of the Coeur d'Alenes, and Polotkin, the head of the Pelouses, both signed the treaty and kept their promises.<br>
<br>
While at the mission Colonel Wright invited me to read all his letters, orders and reports.  His orders, I knew, as they had all been published to the command.  I made a careful examination of every document written by the colonel during the campaign, and found in them continual proofs of justice, impartiality, and the absence of prejudice.<br>
<br>
It seemed to afford him especial satisfaction to set forth the
merits of his subordinates, and he omitted no subject worthy of praise, saving his own activity and fitness for command.<br>
<br>
All fears of further collisions being at an end, we left<br>
the Coeur d'Alene Mission September 18, on our return march.  To avoid the narrow trail through the forest, we crossed the Coeur d'Alene River below the lake and also the St. Joseph's.<br>
<br>
In crossing those deep, clear streams we had the assistance of many Indians with their birch-bark canoes.  The white birch grows to an immense size in that northern country-sometimes four<br>
feet in diameter and a hundred feet high.  The bark is tough, and peels off without breaking, so that a canoe can be made of a single strip.  An angular piece is cut out of each end of the sheet of bark, which is brought up, sewed together at the extremes, and the seams smeared with pitch.  In that way a boat is made in a short time, but as they are round on the bottom, and without a keel, they are easily capsized.<br>
<br>
On the 22d of September we arrived and pitched our camp on the banks of the Nedwall, a small stream, tributary to the Spokan River.  Here a treaty was made and signed by chiefs of the Spokans, Calespools and Pelouses.  The treaties, among other things, required the surrender of Indian murderers and thieves, and several, eight I think, were surrendered and hanged in this camp.<br>

STEPTOE'S BATTLES.<br>
<br>
Joseph McEvoy, "Joseph McEvoy and the Indian Wars," The Weekly Ledger, June 2,1893.<br>
<br>
Nothing of importance transpired until the Spring of 1856 when Colonel Wright came to The Dalles with the Ninth Infantry and took command.  On March 10th, Colonel Wright, with his command started to the Walla Walla country.  They camped at Ten Mile creek and the next morning the express brought news to the colonel that the town of Cascades was surrounded by Indians and the command marched back to The Dalles, went down on the old steamer Halso to the Cascades and landed at the old block house.<br>
<br>
The dead and wounded and the living were all in the blockhouse waiting for the soldiers to relieve them, and the place was surrounded by Indians.  When they saw the soldiers land they soon left and did not bother again.<br>
<br>
The command remained at the Cascades for some time, scouting the entire comuntry, and in that way learned that all the Indians had left for the Yakima country.  The command went from there to The Dalles again and from there to the Yakima country.  Centering here the country was scouted in all directions, but nothing was accomplished in bringing the Indians to terms.<br>
<br>
Some time in July, the command returned to The Dalles.  There was an expedition started to the Walla Walla Country under the command of Colonel Steptoe.  They arrived in the valley on the 18th day of August, 1856 and camped on a piece of land which now comprises my ranch.<br>
<br>
We moved up the Jameison creek about three miles, camping with the<br>
two companies of volunteers commanded by Governor Stevens, whose object it was to make a treaty with the Indians but he failed to come to terms with them.  Colonel Steptoe moved up Mill Creek about seven miles to build his quarters for the winter, Governor Stevens moving with his command to near the camp of Colonel Steptoe.<br>
<br>
The Indians evaded all terms of a treaty, and nothing was accomplished by either command in this respect.  Colonel Steptoe was built his quarters on the ground now known as McQuirk's ranch, having them nearly completed when Governor Stevens left with his command to go back to Olympia.<br>
<br>
He proceeded as far as Russell creek, when he was surrounded by Indians and was compelled to camp away from wood and water and to
fight Indians all the afternoon.<br>
<br>
He got an Indian by the name of Dick, of the Nez Perce tribe, to take word back to Colonel Steptoe's camp.  He carried the message with about five hundred Indians pursuing him.<br>
<br>
Colonel Steptoe immediately sent his command to relieve him. we had to bring the cannon to bear before we could stir the Indians, but that brought them to time.  The Indians were shooting all around us, but we reached the governor's camp without losing a man.  The governor accompanied us back to our camp on Mill Creek, and the next morning we were surrounded, but we made it hot for the Indians.<br>
<br>
There were about five hundred Indians across Mill creek on a hill.  The cannon was brought to bear on them.  The first shell struck a cottonwood tree and completely wrecked it.  The Indians saw the result and disappeared and did not return.<br>
<br>
Governor Stevens remained in Colonel Steptoe's camp about ten days, when Company E of the First dragoons & Company L of the Third artillery, U.S.A., of Steptoes command accompanied him to The Dalles.  Company K of the Fourth infantry in Walla Walla valley was left to take care of government property until Steptoes command should return.<br>
<br>
When he came back he immediately began the completion of their winter quarters on the banks of Mill creek, where now is Main Street bridge in Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
On the 24th of December, 1856, on the day I received my discharge at the expiration of my term of service I went to work for the quartermaster, where I worked two years.  When the old garrison was removed to the present site of the garrison, I took charge of the quartermasters stable and remained in charge until 1861, the troops being all called away to go to war in the east, which was then just breaking out.  That ends my military career.<br>
<br>
On March 10,1859, I was married in Portland, Oregon, and moved to my ranch on Mill creek where I still live.  I am the father of nine children, six boys and three girls.  My eldest son, P. A. McEvoy, was the first white boy born in Walla Walla County.  He is now employed by the Union Express Company at Portland and has worked for that company continuously for fourteen years.<br>
Just one word concerning the defeat of Steptoe in the Palouse Country.<br>
<br>
The defeat was not due to neglect on Steptoes part, but was the fault of Lieutenant Fleming of the 9th Infantry.  There were four boxes of ammunition left at the quartermaster's store at Walla
Walla through the neglect of the lieutenant.  After the train had gone I carried the boxes into the store.  This was the cause of the defeat.  When the call was made for ammunition it was found to be at Fort Walla Walla, one hundred miles away from the battle ground.<br>

<br>
However, this year the simmering problems boiled over again when Col. Steptoe set out from Ft. Walla Walla on May 8 with a command of 159 men. His object was to make a reconnaissance of the country, examine the affairs at Ft. Colville and to seize some cattle thieves among the Palouses.<br>
<br>
On May 14, a group of Indians appeared and told Steptoe the Spokanes would resist his coming into their country. Two days later, on Suncay, May 16, the Indians appeared in force. There followed what must certainly have been some of the most tense hours ever endured by American soldiers in the 82 years of this country's existence.<br>
<br>
While the chiefs and the officers talked, the troops sat on the alert in their saddles, arms ready, while 100 yards away the Indians taunted them. When it became apparent that a battle was inevitable, Col. Steproe took the troops to better ground while the Indians rode on the right flank, constantly taunting the soldiers and jeering at them.<br>
<br>
Steptoe halted the command at a small lake and the troopers sat in their sadddles three more hours while the leaders parleyed. The Indians, Spokanes, Coeur d'Alenes and Palouses, with some disaffected Yakimas, continued to insult the soldiers with words and gestures. The hostiles pointed out that "this is Sunday, but we will fight tomorrow."<br>
<br>
When the Indians withdrew at sunset, Col. Steptoe decided to return to Walla Walla. He sent a messenger to the fort, telling of his predicament.<br>
<br>
The next morning, Monday, May 17, the command was strung out for some 1,000 yards and Indians began massing at the rear. About then Father Joseph Joset, missionary to the Spokanes, arrived and warned
the soldiers the indians were going to attack.<br>
<br>
Col. Steptoe ordered the soldiers not to initiate any conflict and not to reply to the Indians' fire unless there was acute danger to the command or the individual soldier.<br>
<br>
Lt. Gaston's horse was shot out from under him and a ball grazed his hand, but still the soldiers did not return the Indian fire.<br>
<br>
The battle spirit of the Indians continued to grow and, as the troops went for the high ground, the Indians took it ahead of them. Gregg's company dislodged the hostiles from one hill, only to see themmoving toward another, higher eminence that commanded the field. Greff then took that.<br>
<br>
Taylor and Gaston had their troops, now returning the Indians' fire, charge, only to have the hostiles fall back out of range at the charge, then move forward again.<br>
<br>
When the troops under the latter two officers attempted to reach the hill where Gregg's command had been joined by Steptoe and Winder's company, a vicious, hand-to-hand battle ensued in which several were wounded on both sides.<br>
<br>
Although the hill provided a good defensive position, the troops were without water and Steptoe determined to push toward a small river southwest of the hill. With Taylor and Gaston on the exposed flanks, the troops moved down the long slope just before noon.<br>
<br>
Lt. Gaston was mortally wounded in the first attack.<br>
<br>
A half-hour later - the troops had moved barely a half-mile - Capt. Taylor was shot from his horse.<br>
<br>
There followed one of those vignettes of war in which men rise above themselves.<br>
<br>
Capt Taylor's mortally wounded body was an immediate target of the Indians, who wished to count coup on him and take his scalp. Pvt. R. P. Kerse of Company e, Pvt. Victor DeMoy of Company C and Pvt. Francis Poisell ran out to protect the captain. DeMoy, in a hand-
to-hand fight, suffered the wound which later proved fatal to him. But they brought the captain back under heavy fire. He was shot through the neck and lingered only a little while before succumbing to the wound.<br>
<br>
With the command completely surrounded, Steptoe decided to make a stand. He wheeled the command left and made his way to the summit of a hill. There the soldiers ringed the summit and lay down in the tall, rank grass to fire at the Indians. The wounded and the animals were at the center of the hill, in the most protected area.<br>
<br>
After an Indian charge was beaten off in the early afternoon, the battle died down slowly. As it turned out, it was just in time. The
troops, officers found, had no more than three rounds of ammunition per man.<br>
<br>
After a couple of conferences among the officers, a night escape was decided upon. The men who had fallen on or near the hill were buried, the howitzers cached, the 15 wounded men lashed to their saddles and given a companion to assist them on the flight.<br>
<br>
Kamiakin, it is reported, attempted to rouse the Indians to continue the fight into the night, but was unsuccessful. Although sentries were set out, they evidently went to sleep. With ooisy accouterments muffled to keep sound down to a minmum and the light-
colored horses blanketed to make them harder to see, the command moved out about 10 p.m. The animals not actually needed for the escape were left on the hill.<br>
<br>
Along the way DeMoy and Sgt. William Willians, the most seriously wounded, asked to be laid beside the trail. They were later killed or died from their wounds.<br>
<br>
The command made remarkable time. By dawn they were at the Palouse River. By 10 p.m., after 24 hours of hard travel, they were 75 miles away from the battlefield at a Nez Perce camp on the Snake River.<br>
<br>
The next day, May 9, they left the Nez Perce camp and were headed south when they ran into reinforcements from Ft. Walla Walla under Capt. F. T. Dent, who had led his men on a forced march. They returned to the fort.<br>
<br>
Indians have said they suffered nine killed and several wounded - perhaps as many as 50. The soldiers lost seven killed and 13 wounded.<br>

Marcia J. Cass, "The Century old Battle of Steptoe Butte," <B>The Seattle Times.</B> May 11, 1958.<br>
<br>
Colonel Edward J. Steptoe lay on his bunk at Fort Walla Walla and read over once again the message he just had relayed to his troops from Colonel George Wright, commanding officer at The Dalles.<br>
<br>
The message read, "Proceed immediately to the 49th parallel, between the boundary of the United States and Canada, and begin setting up a military post."<br>

Colonel Steptoe no doubt said to himself. "This is in the Couer d'Alene Indian territory and the Couer d'Alenes are none too friendly."<br>
<br>
Nevertheless the next morning, May 5, 1858, a company of some one hundred fifty soldiers set out from Fort WAlla Walla to execute this dangerous mission.<br>
<br>
Included were Captain Charles Winder, Captain O.H.T. Taylor, Lieutenant H. B. Flemming, a Lieutenant Gregg, Lieutenant William Gaston, Thomas J. Beall, master of the pack train; an interpreter, John McBean, and two Nez Perce Indians scouts, Timothy and Levi.<br>
<br>
As the troop formed a line to leave all were gayly laughing and singing. The whole cavalcade moved out to the north. Once beyond the shouting distance of the fort the laughter and singing died out slowly.<br>
<br>
The third day the column swung over towards the breaks of the Snake River, eight miles below the present town of Lewiston, Idaho. John McBean deserted and Steptoe appointed Charles Conness interpreter. The expedition had lost its first man.<br>
<br>
With the help of the scout, Timothy, Indian canoes were made and the company cross the Snake River.<br>
<br>
Travel from this point on was comparatively easy until the troops arrived at Tillio Lake, about sixteen miles north of Rosalia. Here the hostile Couer d'Alenes made their first appearance.<br>
<br>
Steptoe was warned to turn back by his Indians, who refused to aid in the crossing of the treacherous Spokane River. He decided to heed their warning, as he knew both his ammunition and forces were inadequate for any large scale battle.<br>
<br>
That night the troops camped by the edge of the lake and in the gray mist of the morning turned back toward Fort Walla. Near midday the troops halted. On a little open hillside Steptoe was holding a conference with Saltise, chief of the Couer d'Alenes.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Levi, who was in hearing distance of the talk  rode up and spoke to the chief. "You talk with a forked tongue," Levi said," To the white man you say you want peace, to your people you say wait a little, hold on, don't start yet."  With that Levi knocked Saltise sprawling in the dust.<br>
<br>
Without a word Saltise rose to his feet and with all the dignity he could gather went back to his braves. He gave a brief command and rode away at the head of his band without looking back.<br>
<br>
The company went on to North Pine Creek. The date was May 17, 1858. Lieutenant Gaston, in charge of sixteen men on the right flank, saw a long line of horsemen closing in on one side of his troops. Then a shot range in the distance, signaling the beginning of the famous
battle of Steptoe Butte.<br>
<br>
When the firing began Gaston sent a message to Steptoe asking for orders. Steptoe sent work for him to hold fire. Just then one of Gaston's men fell from his horse, fatally wounded.<br>
<br>
Gaston sent another message to Steptoe. He refused to see his men shot down without any resistance. At this moment hell broke loose. A blast of fire ran along the line. The advancing Indians wavered, broke, then charged down the hill.<br>
<br>
Gaston was forced to retreat to the main command that battled at the crossing of the North Pine. He was ordered to occupy points to the right of the trail ahead.<br>
<br>
Most of the men were without ammunition now. Using their guns as clubs, they attempted to stop the charge. Bodies crashed against bodies. There was a heavy thud of steel meeting flesh and a gentle wind carried the dust cloud away as the fighting swept toward the head of the line.<br>
<br>
Eventually Steptoe's command was pushed back so far that it was forced to make a stand on a high knoll about the point occupied by Gaston and his little squad of soldiers.<br>
<br>
After a wavering halt Gregg and Gaston were ordered to charge. The charge was partly successful; a few Indians were killed, all soldiers survived. Gaston then returned to the point he formerly had occupied. Soon the command moved on.<br>
<br>
Steptoe seat Beall, the pack train leader, with a message to Gaston. Gaston was to deploy his men as skirmishers on the left flank. Gaston was soon afterward killed on the skirmish line. The body was never recovered.<br>
<br>
Captain Taylor was killed near the present site of the school house in Rosalia. He was shot twice in the neck, with wounds that rendered him speechless. One of the men tried to understand a message the dying captain wished to send to his wife and children at walla Wall, but could get none of it.<br>
<br>
Toward the evening of the battle there was no ammunition left. So here remained a little group completely helpless surrounded by hundreds of Indians, and Fort Walla a hundred and fifty miles away.<br>
<br>
Steptoe made camp by the winding creek. "Escape. We must escape!" Steptoe brooded as he stared into a low burning fire.<br>
<br>
Timothy stepped before the fire and told Steptoe that he would find a way out. Some of the men immediately objecting saying that the Indian surely would give them away. But Steptoe had confidence in his Indian friend and let him go.
Timothy was gone about two hours and everyone was beginning to give him up for lost. Then he reappeared and in the glow of the campfire explained the method of escape. He told the men that by crossing a high knoll they could avoid the Indians completely.<br>
<br>
Some thought this a trick, but Steptoe gave orders that everyone would go. Fire were left burning, horses picked except for a few that were taken and guns were buried.<br>
<br>
The little troop marched all night and all day until it reached the Snake River.  Here some of Timothy's men met it and helped it across the river with canoes. On the other side, Timothy told Steptoe to let his men rest and his braves would keep watch.<br>
<br>
The next day toward noon the small band of men arrived at Walla, minus two officers, six soldiers, one packer and one Indian. This as the last day of may, 1858.<br>
<br>
A thankful people sought some way to memorialize Colonel Steptoe so selected as his monument the most prominent thing in an otherwise rolling prairie country, a 3,613 foot high conical mound.<br>
<br>
The mound, Steptoe Butte, can be scaled by automobile. The approaches bear permanent markers to the memory of the soldier whose name it bears.<br>

EDWARD STEPTOE.<br>
<br>
"The Steptoe Disaster," <B>Franklin Flyer.</B> XIX(July, 1986.) p. 1-3.<br>
<br>
Because of the Indian uprisings and general Indian unrest in the Inland Empire, a U.S. Army post had been established at Steptoeville by Lieutenant Colonel Edward L. Steptoe in 1856, anung the post Fort Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
This is not to be confused with the Hudson's Bay Company fur trading post which had existed at Wallula ever since 1818.  This post, too carried the name Fort Walla Walla, but there was no connection whatsoever between the two.<br>
<br>
It was from the army post, Fort Walla Walla, that Lt. Col.  Steptoe set forth on May 6, 1858 with three companies of dragoons and 25 mounted infantrymen, accompanied by several Nez Perce Indians who served as guides.  Several depreciations had been made by the Palouse Indians against white settlers near Walla Walla, and Step-
toe also wanted to question them about the murder of two white men near the Palouse River.<br>
<br>
When Steptoe's expedition reached the Palouse River the Spokane Indians informed him that they were unwilling for him to enter into their territory, and he was told that they would resist ... Lieutenant Gregg wrote in his diary, a few days' march after leaving Walla Walla,<br>
<br>
"We reached the Palouse River.  When we were about to pass into Spokane Country the Spokanes said they would resist our entrance 
into <B>their</B> country.  The Spokanes had always been regarded as friendly to the whites, and when we left Walla Walla no one thought of having an encounter with them or with any other Indians on this march."<br>
<br>
In spite of this defiance by the Spokanes, Steptoe decided to move forward.  By May 15 he had reached the valley near present day
Rosalia through which Ingossoman Creek flows, and which in only a few days would be a fateful escape route for Steptoe's defeated command.  Ever since crossing the Snake River he had been encountering small bands of scouting Indian parties, and after camping overnight near Ingossoman Creek they encountered thousands of warriors of various tribes.<br>
<br>
A member of Steptoe's command, Captain Windsor, wrote that now they were 150 miles from Fort Walla Walla, and only approximately 20 miles from the Spokane River, and they found themselves confronted with a "body of Indians, painted and dressed for war, bows strung and guns loaded.  At first sight, with my glass I could count 70, Windsor wrote, "In a few minutes, as if by magic they appeared all around us, possibly some 800 of them.  And in half an hour from 1,000 to 1,200, (the Indians say 1,600), which may be true.  "<br>
<br>
Steptoe too, wrote dramatically about this confrontation: "On Sunday morning, May 16, " he wrote, "we found ourselves suddenly in the presence of ten to twelve hundred Indians of various tribes - Spokanes, Palouses, Coeur d' Alenes, Yakimas and some others.<br>
Steptoe said they were all armed, and defiant.<br>
<br>
He moved his expedition slowly past several hills on which the excited savages were demonstrating.  Realizing that he was about to be attacked, he began moving to a safer encampment site, and during this maneuver the frenzied mass of Indians was moving parallel to him.  By yells and taunts they were apparently trying to force his command to start the firing, but he succeeded in preventing his men from doing so, even those who were green and panic-stricken.<br>
Later in the evening some chiefs rode up to talk to Steptoe and to inquire what the reasons and motives of this march of intrusion were.<br>
<br>
He tried to convince them that he was merely passing through enroute to Colville and that he had no hostile intentions towards the Spokanes, whom he had always considered friendly.  However, the chiefs would not let Steptoe proceed or to use Indian canoes to cross the Spokane River.  Without the canoes he could not cross the swollen stream, thus effectively stopping him, so he decided to march back to Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
Steptoe decided to settle into camp for the night.  The chiefs had left the powwow for their own camp, which was some distance east of his.  He placed a larger than usual number of guards on duty that night, and his men hardly needed to be told to take extra precautions.  They spent a sleepless and probably terrifying night in camp, and by 2 a.m. the next morning they were up and ready to start back to the Snake River and the safety of Walla Walla.  They had advanced only as far as Pine Creek near Plaza when the fighting commenced.<br>

According to Steptoe's report his beleaguered column had not marched three miles when the Indians on the adjoining hillsides began to attack his rear guard.  Especially making heavy attacks on his wagon train.<br>
<br>
Only a few of Steptoe's men were armed with carbines, and at least two companies of the dragoons carried only short muskatoons whose range was not much farther than a man could throw a baseball.  None of them were armed with sabers that the mounted dragoons so desperately needed in the close fighting that soon ensued.  As it turned out, the most unfortunate oversight of all was that only 40 rounds of ammunition per man were taken on this expedition.<br>
<br>
The reason for this was that the baggage wagons were considered overloaded and they did not have the capacity to carry more.<br>
It was not surprising, therefore, that Steptoe's command suffered the disaster that befell it.  They were under furious attack during the last several miles of his retreat toward the Rosalia hill on which he hoped to make his last stand.<br>
<br>
Captain Taylor and Lt.  Gaston both fell, fighting gallantly, according to Steptoe's report.  Taylor was shot through the neck and Gaston through the body.  A total of seven of Steptoe's men were killed, and thirteen were wounded.  The Indian losses seemed slightly greater, he said.<br>
<br>
Captain Winder, in charge of the baggage train, described the actual battle on the hill: "The scene beggars description.  One thousand of these infuriated devils painted and dressed in war regalia, charged in all directions, yelling, whooping and firing on us. But we moved on and got a good position on a hill near present day Rosalia.  Our men fought well, and the firing was hot and heavy.  This fight started about 8 a.m. and lasted until dark.<br>
<br>
Later, in recalling this battle, Steptoe wrote: "Towards evening our ammunition began to give out and our men were suffering from thirst and fatigue ... About that desperate situation on that hill," Steptoe went on to say, "To move from one point to another we had to crawl on our hands and knees in the tall bunchgrass amid the howling of the Indians, the groans of the dying, and the whistling of balls and arrows...<br>
<br>
"We were kept in this position until about 8 p.m., when as night came on, it seemed apparent that on the morrow Owe must go under,' and that not a one of us would escape.  It was plain that nearly destitute of ammunition we were completely surrounded by 600 to 800 Indians, and most of them were at points which we would have to pass to get away.<br>
<br>
Steptoe Plans Escape Maneuver<br>

Steptoe's men were stationed around the crest of the hill in tall bunchgrass, protected by two howitzers that protected them from the enemy who tried to creep up the hill with grass tied to their heads.  At nightfall the chiefs, realizing that they c@uld easily rush the hill the next morning, ordered the attacks to cease.  Their campfires could be seen everywhere surrounding the hill.  After holding a brief council of war with his surviving officers Steptoe decided to try to run the gauntlet, as it were, so that at least some might escape.<br>
<br>
Before embarking on this desperate dash to safety, Steptoe's men buried the two howitzers in the creek, buried their dead, lashed the severely wounded on to horses, quietly called in their sentries from the outlying bunchgrass and began going stealthily off the hill and down Ingossomon Creek, " and then began our 90 mile dash to the Snake River.  Our escape, mostly at a gallop and without rest brought us to the Snake River at Red Wolf's Crossing the next evening where we were met by our friends, the Nez Perces."<br>
<br>
There is much conjecture about Steptoe's lucky escape from that Ro-
salia Hill on which he was so hopelessly surrounded, and with only three or four rounds of ammunition per man still remaining.  Had the Indians pressed their advantage that evening, as Kamiakin had tried to persuade them to do, the annihilation of the Steptoe command would have been inevitable.<br>
<br>
It is incredible that his expedition could have passed unnoticed near the camp of the Coeur d' Alenes, who were guarding one of the main escape routes.  Chief Seltice of that tribe declared many years later that a deal had been struck between them and Steptoe whereby the latter would be allowed to pass their camp in return for the supplies that he abandoned on the hin.<br>
<br>
One of the sentries of the Steptoe command had been overlooked when they quietly fled from the hill at Rosalia.  Apparently he had gone to sleep in ihe tall grass and when he later awakened he realized he had been left behind.  Many weeks later he arrived back at Fort Walla Walla after negotiating the more than 100 miles from Rosalia on foot, doing his furtive traveling at night.<br>
<br>
Steptoe's defeat and humuiating retreat to Walla Walla was looked upon as the "Steptoe disaster" by the regular army.  To avenge the defeat and to restore order among the Spokanes.  Coeur d' Alenes, Yakimas and Palouse tribes, the army dispatched Colonel George Wright into the interior of eastem Washington.<br>
<br>
Setting forth from Walla Walla with well over 500 troops a few weeks later, armed with superior long-range rifles, sufficient ammunition and supplies, he retraced Steptoe's route north across the Snake River toward Rosalia, Pine Creek, the Spokane River, and hopefully to Colville.  
Wherever the Indians tried to make a stand he subdued the combined forces of the Spokanes, Palouses and some Pend Oreilles and Coeur d' Alenes at Four Lakes and nearer the Spokane River.  Wright's superior rifles proved to be the decisive equipment, and in both of the two above-mentioned battles the combined forces of the Indians didn't stand a chance.<br>
<br>
Their losses were heavy, while Wright did not lose a man.  On top of that, he rounded up over 800 of their horses, making it impossible for them to roam over the Yakima Valley and other sections of Eastern Washington and wage war.  Wright assigned some of his men to shoot the captured horses.  The Indians were definitely left on foot.<br>
<br>
Wright also destroyed their winter caches of food, further convincing them that their resistance was futile.  As the Indians surrendered, he rounded up a quota of ring leaders from each tribe and executed them by hanging, often using an upended wagon tongue on which to mount the noose, in the absence of trees.  Hangman Creek near Spokane was given that name as a result of the hangings.  On maps it is shown as Latah Creek.<br>
<br>
The permanent results of the Steptoe defeat, followed only two months later with Wright's campaign showed the army the true pugnacious altitude of the Indians, and that Chief Kamiakin of the Yakimas was probably the chief agitator.  It delayed by a few months, Lieutenant John Mullen's surveying the route for a wagon road from Fort Walla Walla on the Columbia to Fort Benton on the Missouri River.<br>
<br>
Instead, during Wright's campaign of subduing the Indians of east-
ern Washington, Mullan was attached to Wright's command, and Mullan proved to be a very valuable negotiator during the treaty making sessions.  The Indians found him to be a fair and strict negotiator.<br>
<br>
Wright's campaign ended Indian uprisings until the 1870's, when the Modocs in southern Oregon, the WalIowas under Chief Joseph in eastern Oregon went to war against the whites.  In the meantime Washington Territory was full up with white settlers, who often cheated the Indians out of their land and their personal property.<br>

THE STEPTOE BATTLE<br>

Edward S. Curtis, "The Steptoe Battle," <B>The North American Indian.</B> Edward S. Curtis, 1911. Volume VII, p. 54-62.<br>
<br>
The Coeur d'Alenes and the Spokan were most anxious lest the white men, and especially the soldiers, should enter their country.  After the outbreak of the Yakima, when Governor Stevens, hurrying to the coast from a treaty-making council with the Blackfeet, stopped for a conference with the Spokan chiefs, Garry said to him: " I hope that you will make peace on the other side of the Columbia, and keep the soldiers from coming here....<br>
<br>
"If there were many Frenchmen [former employes of the Hudson's Bay Company, many of whom had settled on Indian lands and made notification under the Donation Act] here, my heart would be like fighting.  These French people here have talked too much.<br>
<br>
"I went to the Walla Walla council, and when I returned I found that all the Frenchmen had gotten their land written down on a paper.  I ask them, Why are you in such a hurry to have writings for your lands now ? Why don't you wait until a treaty is made? Governor, these troubles are on my mind all the time, and I will not hide them.... When you talk to your soldiers and tell them not to cross Snake river into our country, I shall be glad."<br>
<br>
A Coeur d'Alene chief said: "You have many soldiers, and I would not like to have them mix among my people." Another repeated the same hope and the same fear: " I would not like to have the whites cross to this side.  If the whites do not cross the river, the Indians will all be pleased.  We have not made friendship yet. . .<br>
<br>
"When we see that the soldiers don't cross the Columbia, we shall believe you take us for your friends."' In the winter of i858 rumors began to be heard to the effect that the Indians in the Colville district were becoming restless, and then occurred the killing by the Palus of two white men on their way to the mines.<br>
<br>
On the sixth of May, Lieutenant-Colonel E. J. Steptoe, with about one hundred and fifty dragoons- and infantry and two howitzers, left the newly established Fort Walla Walla to investigate conditions at Colville.  He crossed Snake river and marched northward, and on the sixteenth, in the country south of Spokane, he was confronted by about six hundred Indians Coeur d'Alenes, Spokan, and some Palus-mounted and painted.<br>
<br>
These offered no violence, but remained massed in his front, shouting and gesticulating.  Steptoe moved on slowly and went into camp.  The chiefs came to inquire why he had brought soldiers into their country, and although he said his purpose was only to visit Colville on a peaceful mission, they insisted that he turn back.  His force was too small, and for some reason too ill-supplied with ammunition, to admit of forcing a passage, hence he agreed to
withdraw.<br>
<br>
At three o'clock in the morning the retreat began, and at daylight the troops were surrounded by an excited mob of Indians, more numerous than ever.  In a little while firing began, and a general attack followed.  A position was taken on a hill near what is now called Steptoe butte, and the fighting continued until nightfall.  Several of the soldiers, including two officers, were lost, and a number of others wounded, and several Nez PercE guides were killed.<br>
<br>
After a consultation among the remaining officers, the two howitzers were buried and a hurried retreat was begun.  Scarcely a halt was made until they reached Snake river, where they were ferried across by some of the Alpowa band of Nez Perces.<br>

STEPTOE'S BATTLE.<br>
<br>
"The Steptoe Battle, reports of Lieutenant John Mullan and Lt. Colonel Steptoe," <B>Washington Historical Quarterly.</B> XVIII (October, 1927) p. 248-253.<br>
<br>
The tragic story (of the Battle)  is told in the following excerpt from Lieut.  Mullen's Memoir, being Senate Exec.  Document No. 32 of the 35th Congress, 2nd Session, page 59 et seq.:<br>
<br>
"This detached command, starting early on the morning of the 24th, passed over a series of rolling prairie hills, and in two miles reached a narrow strip of cotton-wood, with a broad belt of pine timber to our right.  This same character continued for a distance of eight miles, when we reached a prairie bottom some 300 yards wide, lined on either side by walls of basaltic rock 100 feet high, in which was the dry bed of a lake, from which flows, in the spring season, a small creek that flows into, the Ingossomen creek.<br>
<br>
"At this point the pine timber had become more sparse and much scattered, save a few detached clumps where it was more dense.  At eight and a half miles from the Lahtoo, this prairie bottom, which runs north and south, is intersected by a canon running at right angles to it and fifty yards wide.<br>
<br>
"It was at the southwest comer of this intersection that the rear guard of Colonel Steptoe's command, under Lieutenant Gaston, was fired upon in the retreat of May 17, 1858.  The trail that Steptoe followed, which, at the intersection spoken of, was to the west of a small dry willow creek, in a mile to the south crosses it to the
east and ascended a hill some 250 feet high where a first position of the howitzers was taken.<br>
<br>
"Gaining the summit of this hill we had a fine view of a large portion of the ground upon which Colonel Steptoe's command operated.<br>
<br>
"Lieutenant Gregg commanding in advance, with Lieutenant Gaston on the hills to the left, Captain Taylor on the right, with Sergeant Williams in the rear, the retreat was made along the southern portion of the hill where they entered the valley of the Ingossomen creek.  This last stream rises m a range of low prairie hills and flows in a northerly direction until, reaching the base of the hills, it makes a sharp bend to the south and west.<br>
<br>
"This stream at this season has no current, is two feet deep, fif-
teen yards wide, and water lying in long canal shaped basaltic basins.  From this hill westwards the pines continued in its valley and near its border; while to the south nothing save a few clumps of scattered cotton-wood along the banks of the Ingossomen were to be seen.<br>
<br>
"The valley of this creek is about 300 yards wide, and lined on either side by ranges of prairie hills 200 feet high; and following the general direction of the stream for two miles, when, bending more to the east, we reach the point where the final'and decisive stand of Steptoe was made, and from which he comanenced his retreat.  The hill upon which the final position was taken was 150 feet high.  The howitzers were placed near the summit-one to defend the hills beyond, and one near the crest to guard the communication with the water.<br>
<br>
"It is not my purpose or intention to here give any detailed account regarding the position and affairs of that memorable contest ' but simply to relate the part we took in our present mis-
sion to the battlefield.<br>
<br>
"But for the information of those who never knew all the particulars, and as it is somewhat gerrnain to our own duties, I herewith append Colonel Steptoe's own official reports regarding the matter, extracted from the published official communication of the Secretary of War to the present Congress:<br>
<br>
"'Fort Walla-Walla, May 23, 1858.<br>
<br>
"'Major: On the 2d instant I informed you of my intentio to move northward with a part of my command.  Accordingly, on the 6th I left here with companies C, E, and H, 1st dragoons, and E, 9th infantry; in all, five company officers, and,one hundred and fifty-two enlisted men.  Hearing that the hostile Pelouses were
near Al-pon-on-we, in the Nez Perces land, I moved to that point, and was ferried across Snake river by Timothy, a Nez Perce chief.<br>
<br>
"The enemy fled towards the north, and I followed leisurely on the road to Colville.  On Sunday moming, the 16th, when near the To-hoto-nim-me, in the Spokane country, we found ourselves suddenly in presence of ten or twelve hundred Indians of various tribes-Spokanes, Pelouses, Coeur d'Alenes, Yakimas, and some others-all armed, painted, and defiant.<br>
<br>
"I moved slowly on until just about to enter a ravine that wound along the bases of several hills, which were all crowned by the excited savages.<br>
<br>
"Perceiving that it was their purpose to attack us in this dangerous place, I tumed aside and encamped, the whole wild, frenzied mass moving parallel to us, and, by yells, taunts, and menaces, apparently trying to drive us to some initiatory act of violence.<br>
<br>
"Towards night a number of chiefs rode up to talk with me, and inquired what were our motives to this intrusion upon them? I answered, that we were passing on to Colville, and had no hosthe intentions towards the Spokanes, who had always been our friends, nor towards any other tribes who were friendly; that my chief aim in coming so far was to see the Indians and the white people at Colville, and, by friendly discussion with both, endeavor to strengthen their good feelings for each other.<br>
<br>
"They expressed themselves satisfied, but would not consent to let me have canoes, without which it would be impossible to cross the Spokane river.  I concluded, for this reason, to. retrace my steps at once, and the next morning (17th) turned back towards this post.  We had not marched three miles when the Indians, who had gathered on the hills adjoining the line of march, began an attack upon the rear guard, and immediately the fight became general.<br>
<br>
"We labored under the great disadvantage of having to defend the pack train while in motion and in a rolling country peculiarly favorable to the Indian mode of warfare.  We had only a sihall quantity of ammunition, but, in their excitement, the soldiers could not be restrained from firing it in the wildest manner.<br>
<br>
"They did, however, under the leading of their respective commanders sustain well the reputation of the army for some hours, charging the enemy repeatedly with gallantry and success. -The. difficult and dangerous duty of flanking the column was assigned to Brevet Captain Taylor and Lieutenant Gaston, to both of whom it proved fatal.  The latter fell about twelve o'clock, and the enemy soon after charging formally upon his company, it fell back in con-
fusion and could not be rallied.<br>

"About a half hour after this Captain Taylor was brought in mortally wounded; upon which I immediately took possession of a convenient' height and halted.  The fight continued here with unabated activity; the Indians occupying neighboring heights and working themselves along to pick off our men.  The wounded increased in number continually.<br>
<br>
Twice the enemy gave unmistakable evidence of a design to carry our position by assault, and their number and desperate courage caused me to fear the most serious consequences to us from such an attempt on their part.  It was manifest that the loss of their officers and comrades began to tell upon the spirit of the soldiers; thatthey were becoming discouraged, and not to be relied upon<br>
with confidence.<br>
<br>
Some of them were recruits but recently joined; two of the companies had musketoons, which were utterly worthless in our present condition; and, what was most alarming, only<br>
two or three rounds of cartridges remained to some of the men,<br>
and but few to any of them.<br>
<br>
It was plain that the enemy would give     the troops no rest during the night, and they would be still further disqualified for stout resistance on the morrow, while the number of enemies would certainly be increased I determined, for these reasons, to make a forced march to Snake river, about eight-five miles distant, and secure the canoes in advance of the Indians, who had already- threatened to do the saine in regard to us.<br>
<br>
After consulting with the officers, all of whom urged me to the step as the only means, in their opinion, of securing the safety of the conunand, I concluded to abandon everything that night impede our march.  Accordingly, we set out about 10 o'clock in perfectl - good order, leaving the disabled animals and such as were not in condition to travel so far and so fast, and, with deep pain I have to add, the two howitzers.<br>
<br>
The necessity for this last measure will give you, as well as many words, a conception of the strait to which we believed ourselves to be reduced.  Not an officer of the command doubted that we would be overwhelmed with the first rush of the enemy upon our position in the moming; to retreat further by day, with our wounded men and property, was out of the question; to retreat slowly by night equally so, as we could not then be in condition to fight all next day; it was therefore necessary to relieve ourselves of all incumbrances and to fly.<br>
<br>
We had no horses able to carry the guns over 80 miles without resting, and if the enemy should attack us en route, as, from their ferocity, we certainly expected they would, not a soldier could be spared for any other duty than skirmishing.  For these reasons, which I own candidly seemed to be more cogent at the time than they do now, I resolved to bury the howitzers.  
What distresses me is, that no attempt was made to bring them off ; and all I can add is, that if this was an error of judgment it was committed after the calmest discussion of the matter, in which, I believe, every officer agreed with me.<br>
<br>
" 'Enclosed is a list of the killed and wounded.  The enemy acknowledge a loss of nine killed and, forty or fifty wounded, many of them mortally.  It is known to us that this is an under<br>
st m tha e imate, for one of the o icers infor s me t on a single spot where Lieutenants Gregg and Gaston met in a joint charge twelve dead, Indians were counted.  Many others were seen to fall.<br>
<br>
"'I cannot do justice in this communication to the conduct of the officers throughout the affair.  The gallant bearing of each and aR was accompanied by an admirable coolness and sound judgment.  To the skill and promptness of Assistant Surgeon Randolph the wounded are deeply indebted.<br>

<br>
(Resuming) "Having arrived near the battle field, we came upon the bones of many of our men that had laid bleach*ng on on the prairie hills for four months, and that had, in this interval, been scattered and dragged in every direction by the bands of wolves that had infested the place.<br>
<br>
"Having with us the Coeur d'Alene Indian who, after the battle, finding the body of Lieutenant Gaston, had himself covered it with leaves and bushes, and left it upon the field, we were directed to the spot of his rude burial, and there found the bones of that gallant officer, who fell bravely leading his men in a forlom charge.  On reaching the battle field proper we halted and encamped, and, picketing our animals in good grass, began to search for the remains of the men there so inhumanly butchered, and the guns lost in that desperate encounter.<br>
<br>
"The guns, having been well buried, were found as they had been left, undisturbed.  Passing along the slope of the hill, we came upon a small ravine, in which lay the graves of four men: Captain
Taylor, a half-breed, and two of the dragoons.  Silently and mournfully we disinterred their remains, and securely packing them bore them from the field to our camp, in order to transport them to Walla-Walla, there to give them proper burial with military honors.<br>
<br>
"Silently surveying the ground from the top of this hill scene of desolation and sadness met the eye at every Broken and burnt fragments of all that had once constitute equipage of this command lay scattered to the right and left, and everywhere were to be seen the urunistakeable signs of a relentless savage who  had  determined  on the utter annihilation of this small <B>command</B>.<br>
<br>
"But one thing remained not totally destroyed, viz: a pair of shafts of one of the buried guns.  Why this had escaped the general conflagration of such things as the Indians could not usefully appropriate was a wonder to us all.<br>
<br>
"This, with our rude means at hand, we framed and fashioned into a cross, which we erected upon the battle field as a Christian token to the honored dead, and to point the stranger to the spot where brave men bravely met their fate; and as each officer and soldier lingered near the spot, and heard rehearsed the sad recital of that memorable defeat, the silent tear stole down many a bronzed cheek that had confronted death and braved danger upon many a tented field, and all praying in their hearts "Requiescat in Paci," left behind them this hill of death, and moving to our camp we found everything quiet, as if the feelings of all were in sad unison with the place, and thus,- too, our camp merits the name of the Camp of Death.  The subjoined plans and sketches were made by Mr. Kolecki and Mr. Sohon, who accompanied the command.<br>
<br>
"Colonel Wright having presented us a bottle of fine brandy on the eve of our starting for the battle field, we had occasion to remember our friends present and absent.  Having accomplished the object of our mission, we resumed our march on the morning of the 25th over the same trail, reaching our former camp on the Ned-whauld at 12 m., where we learned the fate of Qual-chian<br>
and his confreres in crime."<br>

STEPTOE'S DEFEAT.<br>
<br>
Clinton A. Snowden, "Steptoe's Defeat," <B>History of Washington. The Rise and Progress of An American State.</B> New York: The Century Company, 1909. Volume IV p. 20-23.
Early in May Steptoe prepared to advance into the country of the hostiles, north of the  Snake River, and make a demonstration that would perhaps compel the Palouses, Spokanes and Coeur d'Alenes, inhabiting that region, to have more respect for the troops of the United States and the authority of the government.<br>
<br>
On the 8th he left Fort Walla with 159 men belonging to the 1st dragoons, including a detachment from the 9th Infantry, and two howitzers.<br>
<br>
One hundred pack mules had been provided to transport the supplies, which, strange to say, included little more ammunition than the men carried in their cartridge boxes.  The route taken lay through the present counties of Walla, Garfield and Columbia, to the mouth of AIpowa Creek, where the command was assisted in crossing the Snake by a party of friendly Nez Perces, from the camp of the native preacher Timothy.<br>
<br>
From that point Timothy and three of his people accompanied the expedition, Steptoe intending to use them as intermediaries and interpreters.  On the 16th, as the command was approaching Four Lakes, the hostiles were found to be assembling about it in formidable numbers.<br>
<br>
They sent word to Steptoe that he must advance no further or they would attack him.  He replied that he had not entered their country with any hostile intent; that he must remain where he was during the night on account of water, but that he would turn back next morning.<br>
<br>
True to his promise he started to retreat at 3 o'clock a. m. and by daylight found himself surrounded by from 1,000 to 1,500 warriors, all painted and armed for battle.  Before he had gone three miles the attack began, and the battle soon became general.<br>
<br>
Some of the soldiers were armed only with old musketoons that were of very little value, and some were recruits who had never seen a battle, and scarcely knew how to keep their places in the ranks.  These could not be kept from wasting their ammunition, of which their supply was short at best.<br>
<br>
The Indians, emboldened by their vastly superior numbers,, pressed close upon the troops, in flank and rear, who were greatly embarrassed by having to defend their pack train while in motion.  The rolling character of the ground was also advantageous to the<br>
Indians, because of their numbers.<br>
<br>
The defense of the flanks of the desperately fighting column was assigned to Captain Taylor of Company C and Lieutenant Gaston of Company E and they sustained their desperate positions with credit to themselves, and the army, until the former was mortally wounded.<br>

Steptoe then,took position on a hill which offered some advantages for defense, hoping in this way to make a more effective battle.<br>
<br>
But his men were rapidly disabled by the well directed fire of the savages, who sometimes pressed so close upon them that they could be driven back only by charges with the bayonet. In one of these, in which Lieutenant Gaston and Gregg, with a few men each, united, twelve Indians were reported to have been killed and many more wounded.<br>
<br>
About noon Gaston, a brave officer, was killed and his men fell back in confusion, and were rallied only with great difficulty.<br>
<br>
Twice  during  the  day  the  savages seemed about to make a charge in which they would doubtless have overwhelmed the entire command, could they have  mustered courage to make it.  The soldiers dispirited by the loss of their officers and comrades, and by the seeming certainty that, if wounded, they could not be carried away, and would be left to the mercy of their savage assailants.  Night alone saved them from utter and final destruction.<br>
<br>
Indians rarely continue a battle after night. When the firing began to slacken and then finally ceased, Steptoe consulted with his officers and determined to march during the night and if possible escape.  His men had been fighting most of the day without food or water.<br>
<br>
There  was  no  water to be had where they were. It was 85 miles to the miles to the Snake River, beyond which if he could reach it he might hope to be no further pursued.<br>
<br>
He was greatly encumbered by his wounded, but as many of his men had now only three or four rounds of ammunition left, they could not hope to maintain the battle through another day where they were.  They accordingly buried their howitzers, left their dead unburied, and, gathering up as many of the wounded as could be reached, started for the river.  The horses were forced to a gallop.<br>
<br>
Some of the wounded, who could not walk, were bound upon horses or mules, and one of them suffered so much that he begged to be shot, or to be given a pistol with which to shoot himself.  Two wounded men fell behind the column during the night; one of them afterwards reached the river alive, but the other fell into the hands of the savages and was killed and scalped.<br>
<br>
According to Steptoe's report, two officers and two men were killed in this battle, two were mortally, six severely and seven slightly wounded, while one, Sergeant Edward Ball, was missing.  The Indian losses were believed to be much larger.<br>
<br>
It was now so evident that Wool's policy was a failure, and that there would be no peace until the Indians were made to feel the power of the government, that reinforcements were hurried up from
California as soon as possible, and Colonel Wright himself took the field.<br>
<br>
Wright was a capable soldier when fighting was to be done, and now that fighting could no longer be postponed or avoided, he inau-
gurated a campaign that even Stevens himself would not have pushed with more vigor; it is even probable, if not absolutely certain, that he would have used the rope less frequently, upon those who fell into his hands after the actual fighting was over.<br>

The Steptoe Disaster<br>
<br>
George W. Fuller, "The Steptoe Disaster," <B>The Inland Empire of the Pacific Northwest.</B> Spokane: H.G. Linderman, 1928, Volume III, p. 1-14.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Colonel Steptoe commenced, sending disquieting reports to headquarters in April, 1858.  It was said that two men had been killed near the Palouse river, on their way to Colville.  Palouse Indians raided the Walla Walla valley early in April and carried off horses and cattle belonging to whites and Indians, including thirteen head of beef cattle belonging to the army.<br>
<br>
Some forty persons living at Colville petitioned for troops, believing that their lives and property were iia danger.  Steptoe decided to march his command through the Palouse country, in search of the thieves, then to go among the Spokanes for the purpose of conferring with them, and finally to investigate the situation at Colville.  His hope was to check the reported disturbances by peaceful means, and he was not equipped for a campaign.<br>
<br>
He was obliged to await the return of his horses in May from Fort Vancouver, where they had been sent for the winter on account of lack of hay at Walla Walla.  When his expedition set out, on May 6, he had 158 men, three companies of dragoons and part of a company of infantry with two mountain howitzers.  Two of the dragoon companies were armed with musketoons, short muskets with a very limited range, useless beyond fifty yards and therefore utterly ineffective agaiiast Indians armed with rifles.<br>
<br>
The other dragoon company had Mississippi Yager rifles, which carried well but could not be loaded on horseback.  There were ten good carbines in the infantry company.  Some of the men had re-
volvers, and others had only old-fashioned muzzleloading pistols.<br>

The cavalry did not have sabres, a weapon which proved very useful in the Wright campaign.  At one point in the Steptoe fight, when several men were engaged in a hand-to-hand fight with Indians seeking to take the body of a wounded officer, they fought with clubbed rifles.  One of them, who had been in the French army, swung his gun barrel like a sword, "My God, for a sabre!"<br>
<br>
Thomas Beall, chief packer, stated in a newspaper article, in 1916, that the officers and non-commissioned officers carried swords, but that Steptoe ordered the cavalrymen to leave their sabres behind because he did not wish them to be encumbered in any way.<br>
<br>
The small supply of <B>ammunition</B> was the thing which General Winfield Scott mentioned as surprising, in transmitting Steptoe's report to the Secretary of War.  The expedition carried only forty rounds to the man.  The blame seems to rest with the chief packer, who found that his train could not carry all the supplies which had been allotted to the expedition.<br>
<br>
The amount of baggage was cut down before the departure from Fort Walla Walla, and several boxes of ammunition were left behind.  This serious omission may have been overlooked, or the officers may have considered that the supply was sufficient.  "When we left Walla Walla," wrote Lieutenant David Gregg, "no one thought of having an encounter.  "<br>
<br>
A band of Palouses were reported near Red Wolf's crossing, and it was decided to march in that direction.  The Palouses fled on learning that troops were coming, and Steptoe crossed the Snake at the mouth of the Alpowa, where Timothy and his Nez Perce's had a fleet of canoes.  This was the only point at which it was possible for a military expedition to cross.<br>
<br>
The supplies and equipment were taken over in the boats, and the Indians swam the horses across.  After leaving the Snake, Indians were frequently seen, and some came within the lines and talked with the officers and men.  These were spies, who sent information ahead regarding the strength and equipment of the troops.<br>
<br>
On crossing the Palouse river, Steptoe was informed that the Spokanes would resist the entrance of troops into their country.  The officers were not yet ready to believe this report, and the column advanced on Pine creek, then known as the Ingossomen by the Spokanes and the Tohotonimme by the Nez Perces.<br>
<br>
Camp was made on the night of the filfteenth a little south of the present site of Rosalia, near the hill which was selected for their last stand against the Indians two days later.  The march was resumed on Sunday morning, the sixteenth, though it was reported that a force of Indians was assembling somewhere ahead.<br>
<br>
At 11 o'clock a war party of from 600 to 1,200 Indiaias suddenly appeared.  They were well mounted and were mostly armed with rifles.
The two forces halted a hundred yards apart, and several Spokanes came forward.  They said they had heard that the army intended to annihilate them and announced that they were ready to fight.  Steptoe explained the friendly purpose of his journey.  Though they professed to believe him, they made their objection to his plans clear by announcing that they would not supply the means of crossing the Spokane.<br>
<br>
This was enough, according, to Steptoe's report, to convince him that it was useless to go on.  He told his officers, at the close of the conference, that they would have to fight.<br>
<br>
His first concern was to find a camp site for <B>that</B> night.  The troops moved ahead, with the Indians on their right flank, until the trail approached a defile, into which it would have been foolhardy to venture, for the Indians swarmed over the surrounding hills.<br>
<br>
When the troops turned to the west and marched a mile to a small sheet of water, the enemy showed its appreciation of this act of caution by taunts and jeers.  The command halted, but did not dare to dismount for three hours, when the Indians withdrew, towards sunset.<br>
<br>
Another conference with the chiefs had proved futile, and while it was going on, other Indians were assuring the troops that Timothy's canoes on the Snake would be seized to cut off their retreat, and that the only reason why a battle had not already started was the fact that it was Sunday.<br>
<br>
Steptoe broke camp at daylight on the seventeenth and took a short cut back to the main trail.  Lieutenant David Gregg was in advance with H Company of dragoons.  Captain 0. H. P. Taylor followed at a distance of <B>1,000 </B>yards with C Company of dragoons.<br>
<br>
Then came the infantry and howitzers, under Captain C. S. Winder, and the pack train.  Lieutenant William Gaston covered the rear with E Company of dragoons.  The Indians appeared by 8 o'clock and dogged the march of the rear guard.<br>
<br>
Father Joseph Joset of the Coeur d'Alene Mission rode up, soon after the appearance of the Indians, and warned Steptoe that an attack was imminent, suggesting, however, that it might still be averted if another conference could be held with the chiefs.  Steptoe was unwilling to halt, and the priest offered to bring in the chiefs for a talk while they rode along, but he was able to bring only Vincent of the Coeur d'Alenes.<br>
<br>
Steptoe told the chief that he was returning to Walla Walla because he had found that the presence of his troops was offensive to the tribes whom he regarded as friends, and because he could not cross the Spokane at the season of high water without the boats which they had denied him.<br>

While they were talking, a Nez Perce scout accused Vincent of speaking "with a forked tongue" and struck him with a whip, at the same time asking why he did not fire.  Vincent paid no attention to the insult, which has been taken as evidence that the Nez Perecs hoped the troops would have to fight.<br>
<br>
The scout was rebuked, and Vincent seemed ready to believe Steptoe, but the conference was abruptly ended by a messenger who informed Vincent that the Palouses were about to open fire, and asked him to rejoin his tribesmen.<br>
<br>
The engagement opened as the column crossed a stream near the junction of the Palouse and the Inland Empire highways.  The firing was at first at long range and was directed at the rear guard.  The troops moved on, without replyin and took to the hills on the east.<br>
<br>
The Indians gradually rode closer and threw their lines along the flank.  The advance soon became a race for favorable positions on the hills, with maneuvering to keep out of the ravines.  The necessity of conserving ammunition was impressed upon the men, and they fired chiefly using the short charges by which they continually drove the Indians back.<br>
<br>
The lack of sabres was keenly felt in this kind of fighting.  The Indians always ran when the dragoons charged and were on their heels again as soon as they wheeled baek toward the line of march.  The pack train was moved with great diffie,ulty, as the animals were badly frightened and sought to break away.  Many were shot down.<br>
<br>
After two miles of more of slow progress under continuous<br>
fire, it was observed that the Indains were making for a hill at a considerable distance ahead which would command the line of advance.  Gregg's company raced for it and won.  The Indians moved around to another hill close by which was here still and Gregg was obliged to leave a detachment to hold the first hill and to rush the Indians off the other.<br>
<br>
The Indians retired as usual before the charge of the dragoons, but not far, and the troops had to stay on the hill and await the arrival of their comrades.<br>
<br>
Captain Winder's section with the howitzers, reached the hill at 11 o'clock.  Steptoe was with this part of the column.  The guns were fired, more to frighten the Indians than for the actual damage they could infliet.  The Indians now made a desperate attempt to cut off the other two companies of dragoons.<br>
<br>
Gaston repeatedly drove back the pursmug force, but before he could reach the hill a large party of the enemy swept in between, <B>and </B>he was subjected to a cross fire.  His critical position could be seen from the hill, and at the moment when he turned from his pursuers and charged the enemy in front, Gregg's company rode down.  
Gregg so timed his movement that the Indians were caught in an angle, as they sought to extricate themselves from the same kind of trap which they had prepared for Gaston.  The dragoon companies met, and twelve Indians where were killed and many wounded at the point towards the trap closed.<br>
<br>
The two companies moved the <B>hill, </B>with the enemy pressing on both flanks and at the rear.  Meanwhile, Taylor's dragoons reached the hill by a series of short charges, and the entire command was assembled for the first time since morning.<br>
<br>
Only one soldier had been killed, but there were a number wounded.  The Indians were furious over their losses, which included three important Coeur d'Alenes: Victor, Jacques and Zachariah, a brother-
in-law of Vincent.  These men had all entered the fight reluctantly, after hearing the reports of Vincent and Father Joset on their conference with Steptoe.<br>
<br>
The troops could not rest for long on the hill.  It was necessary to reach water and the Indians were evidently receiving re-enforcements.  Much signaling was going on, from the hills.  The way toward Pine creek lay down a long slope, and the Indians rode in from all sides as the march was resumed.<br>
<br>
Safety for the troops now depended upon retaining a compact formation.  Taylor and Gaston were ordered to protect the flanks.  Gregg guarded the rear, and Winder kept the pack train moving, clearing the way by frequently unlimbering the howitzers and firing ahead.  The <B>Column</B> had moved about half a mile, when Gaston was killed.<br>
<br>
Elated at seeing an officer fall the Indians massed and charged his company, which fell back in a demoralized condition upon the pack train.  Steptoe succeeded partially in rallying them, and Gregg's men rode in and stopped the enemy's charge.  In this movement a part of the train was unavoidably exposed and lost.<br>
<br>
Fighting was equally sharp on the other flank, and Captain Taylor was mortally wounded half an hour after Gaston's death.  Lieutenant James Wheeler took command of his company.  There was a handto-hand fight, with clubbed rifles,  over Taylor's body, until the wounded officer could be carried within the lines.<br>
<br>
Taylor fell at a point on the main highway about one mile north of Rosalia.<br>
<br>
Steptoe realized that <B>the</B> advance could not continue much longer, through a horde of enemies who found fresh opportunities to attack at every turn he took.  He could only choose a spot which might be successfully defended as long as his ammunition held out.  A Nez Perce scout had started for Fort Walla Walla the night before, but there was no hope that aid would arrive in time.<br>
<br>
The distance was too great, and the messenger had a small chance of
getting through.  So the column, relieved for a brief interval from the violent onslaught of the enemy, moved up a ridge to an eminence at its top, from which the ground fell away steeply on the further side, to the creek.<br>
<br>
The baggage was stacked near the steep decline, and the animals were picketed in a circle around the supplies.  The men were posted in a larger circle around the crest of the hills lying flat on the ground, in high grass.  One howitzer was placed where it would command the long ridge up which the troops had marched and the other at the rear.<br>
<br>
Some of the men dug shallow trenches, and the officers crawled around the circle to give their instructions.  Captain Taylor died soon after the hill was occupied.  Assistant Surgeon J. F. Randolph cared for the wounded at a spot which was out of range of the enemy.<br>
<br>
The Indians surrounded the hill at once aiad crept up the slopes, with grass tied to their heads.  Twice they started to carry the position by storm.  At nightfall, about 8 o'clock at this time of the year, the chiefs.ordered firing to cease.<br>
<br>
Camp fires appeared along the creek and signal fires on the hills.  Three rounds of ammunition remained to the troops, and no one doubted that the fight would end with the first rush by the enemy in the morning.<br>
<br>
To remain on the hill meant certain death for all.  A retreat by night offered a chance that some might get away.  Steptoe had been an artillery officer, and he seems to have hesitated partly because it would be necessary to abandon hig guns.  He also felt that the chance of escape was very slight, and his men might be captured in small groups and subjected to torture before being put to death.<br>
<br>
After considerable discussion, however, it was unanimously agreed among the officers that a dash for the Snake river, ninety miles away, should be attempted.<br>
<br>
If the Indians had not relaxed their vigilance, in their confidence that the fight was won and in their desire to finish the whites by daylight, Steptoe could not have escaped.  A. J. Splawn, whose information was from Indian sources, claims that Kamiakin was present and that he urged his people not to rest, reminding them of similar occasions when the prey had slipped away.<br>
<br>
The  Indians might plan a night attack, but it was not their habit to sustain an action after darkness had set in.  In this case they were sure that the troops were at the end of their resources.<br>
<br>
When Steptoe's decision was made, a party of scouts was sent down the hill to the south.  Both sides of the creek were explored, and it was found that no Indians remained.  As soon as the scouts re-
ported, the howitzers and the dead were buried, and horses were led over the ground to conceal the place of burial with their tracks.  
The gun carriages were taken down to the creek and submerged.  Fifteen wounded men were mounted and lashed in their saddles and each was placed under the care of a comrade.  Horses of light color were blanketed.  All the extra animals were left picketed on the hill, and the supplies were abandoned.<br>
<br>
It is said that the division of this booty among the several tribes occasioned a dispute which prevented immediate pursuit, when the flight of the troops was discovered.<br>
<br>
Steptoe, with the first detachment, consisting of Wheeler's dragoons and Winder's mounted infantry, left the hill between 9 and 10 o'clock.  Gregg waited, with the other two companies, until the out-
posts could be called in.  It was necessary to hunt carefully for these men, who were lying in the tall grass.  Some of them were so exhausted that they had fallen asleep.<br>
<br>
So quietly was the retreat conducted that Gregg did not know of the departure of the first detachment until Randolph notified him that it was well on its way down the valley; whereupon the last two companies moved off, with equal success in preserving silence.  Steptoe proceeded slowly until Gregg caught up with him and then the dash for the Snake river commenced.  Most of the distance was covered at a gallop.<br>
<br>
One or two survivors, in newspaper interviews given half a century after the battle, have stated that the Nez Perce Timothy discovered the unguarded pass and led the troops to safety.  Others have as-
sumed that Timothy accompanied the expedition, after ferrying it aeross the Snake.<br>
<br>
He has not only been hailed as its savior but has also been charged with double-dealing, in guiding it directly into the Spokane country instead of taking the main trail to Colville.  This alleged treachery has been viewed as art of a Nez Perce plot to involve the troops in warfare with the northern tribes.<br>
<br>
It was Steptoe's intention to visit the Spokanes, and there are many reasons for believing in Timothy's loyalty.  There is also good reason to doubt that he was with the troops after they left the river.  If he performed the notable service with which he has been credited, it would surely have been mentioned in the reports.  No officer refers to his presence, and Lieutenant Gregg afterwards said he did not recall that Timothy was with the troops.<br>
<br>
Two severely wouiaded men were soon obliged to abandon hope of escape.  Victor C. De Moy, the French soldier previously mentioned, was laid beside the trail.  He retained his revolver, with several charges, the last of which he said would be for himself.  Splawn was told by the Indians that when they came upon him, he wounded two of them.  After retiring to a safe distance, they heard another shot.  They then dismountted, crept forward and riddled his body with bullets.<br>

Sergeant W. C. Williams was also laid beside the trail when he could no longer endure the pain of riding.  Several stories are told of his fate, the most credible being an account given by the Indians to John O'Neil, a survivor of the expedition, when he was in the country a few years later, and related by Masering.<br>
<br>
This story is that Williams was found by some Coeur d'Alenes, and begged them to shoot him, but that they declined to do so, and an old squaw attended him until he died.<br>
<br>
The Palouse river was reached at dawn on the eighteenth.  A short halt was made after crossing, and observations taken from the hills revealed no sign of pursuit.  Yet the column hurried on with a<br>
far extended line of scouts.<br>
<br>
<B>The  troops</B>  rode  into the Nez Perce village at the Snake river crossing soon after 10 o'clock that night.  Camp was made with the Nez Perces, as it was impossible to cross the swollen stream in the darkness the squaws took care of the wounded, and the Indian men posted a guard on the hills.<br>
<br>
The pursuing hostiles, when ten miles from the place, were informed by their scouts that the Nez Perces were guarding the approach, and they turned back.<br>
<br>
The Nez Perces ferried the troops across the river on the following morning.  Nothing had been seen here of the Indian messenger who left Steptoe's camp on the sixteenth, but before the column was ready to resume its march to Fort Walla Walla, Captain F. T. Dent rode up, with a part of the garrison.  The messenger had crossed the river at a point further west and had taken the news to the fort.  No time had been lost by any of the parties concerned.<br>
<br>
After one day's march toward Walla Walla, a large body of Indians were seen approaching at a gallop.  The troops hurriedly prepared for a fight, but as the riders came nearer they displayed an American flag, and they were recognized to be Nez Perces.<br>
<br>
Chief Lawyer came forward and said that when the news of Steptoe's defeat had reached his people, probably by the rapid system of Indian signaling, they had hurried to his rescue.  Lawyer offered the services of his warriors and proposed that the combined forces march back into the north country and punish the hostiles.<br>
<br>
The offer was fully appreciated, but the troops were in no condition for another campaign.  They continued the march to the fort, and Lawyer's band passed <B>on </B>toward the Snake river.<br>
<br>
First Sergeant Edward Ball, who was reported among the missing when Steptoe reached Walla Walla, afterwards came in, having made the journey on foot and alone.  He awoke towards morning on the eighteenth, in the brush near the creek, and found that all his comrades were gone.<br>

It is said that he had assisted the commissary in destroying the stock of liquors, on Steptoe's orders, before the supplies were abandoned.  Ball was <B>commended</B> for bravery by Steptoe and, later, by Wright and eventually won the rank of Major.<br>
<br>
Steptoe found consolation for the disaster in several fortunate circumstances.  His command escaped the massacre which he had believed for a while to be inevitable.  His reconaissance disclosed the actual temper of the northern tribes.  And the episode was timely in cheeking another expedition about to enter the field, which was even more poorly prepared to defend itself and would probably have been annihilated.<br>
<br>
Father Joset told Steptoe that the Indians had heard that the government planned to seize their lands.  As evidence of this intention, said the mischief makers, they would soon see a surveying party at work in their country.  The northern tribes had agreed that this would be sufficient proof, and they had bound themselves to massacre any such party.<br>
<br>
The tricky agitators, who were mostly Yakimas, had accurate information about the surveying party, but the purpose of the survey was to locate a milltary road from old Fort Walla Walla at Wallula, to Fort Benton.  Lieutenant John Mullan was placed in charge of the survey, and he was at The Dalles on <B>May</B> 15.<br>
<br>
He started at once with his surveyors and road crew, and forwarded a <B>requisition </B>to <B>Fort</B> Walla Walla for the military escort which had been ordered, one officer and sixty-five men.<br>
<br>
The news of Steptoe's defeat came when Mullan's road work had advanced only as far as Five Mile creek.  He realized that the prospects for road buildiing would be bad, but he bridged Five Mile and Ten Mile creeks and improved the road as far as the Deschutes river while awaiting definite word from the fort.<br>
<br>
He received a message from Steptoe on May 30, returned to The Dalles and disbanded his party.  Beside notifying the War Department, he suggested to General Clarke that he was ready to accompany any expedition which might be sent into the field.  This offer was fortunately accepted; Mul<B>lan's </B>maps and report on the Wright campaign are invaluable.<br>

THE BATTLE OF STEPTOE.<br>

Carl Cosier, "The Battle of Steptoe,"  <B>The Coast.</B> VI (September, 1903) p. 101-104.<br>
<br>
We are prone to regard the State of Washington, its interests and its history as something new.  Scarcely could this be otherwise since within the memory of all of us the hills on which we live were covered by wild grass and to some extent with wild men.  But when our grandparents were making history these same wild men had begun to feel the effect of a taming force and the pressure of a conquering grip.<br>
<br>
The battle of Steptoe occurred almost exactly three years before the civil war began.  At that time people were too much absorbed in greater matters to give much attention to Indian fights on the frontier.  The battle of Steptoe was fought on the 17th of May, 1858.  Early in the spring of the same year there was reported the murder of two white men, prospectors, in the Palouse country, presumably by the Palouse Indians.<br>
<br>
General Clarke, then in charge of the Pacific Coast division, or. dered Colonel E. <B>J. </B>Steptoe to make an expedition through the section of country lietween Walla Walla and Colville to investigate the condition of affairs and find, if possible, the murderers.  Accordingly Col.  Steptoe left Fort Walla Walla on May 6th with a force of 152 enlisted men, five officers and thirty civilians in charge of a good-sized supply train.<br>
<br>
He was a young man somewhat overconfluent of his ability, and disregarded the advice of older and  more experienced men.  In preparing for  the expedition he gave orders that his men should equip themselves in light marching order whieb meant that only officers had pistols and sabres, and privates had "musketoons," which were short smooth-bore guns with 22 inch barrels.<br>
<br>
They were muzzle-loaders and had the ramrods attached by a swivel.  They were loaded with a paper cartridge containing three buckshot and ball, and were fired by a percussion cap shaped something like a derby hat.<br>
<br>
One writer remarks that the most effeetive, work that could be doue with sueh a blunderbuss was by its use as a "shillaleh."<br>
Colonel  Steptoe seemed to think there was little if any danger from the Indians, and that they would not molest the expedition.<br>
On the third day out they were ferried across Snake river at the mouth of Alpowa creek by Timothy, a chief of a small band of Nez Perces who lived in that vicinity.<br>
<br>
Timothy, Levi, and Blanket-Made-ofGeese-Feathers accompanied the expedition as guides.<br>
<br>
John MeBane, a half-breed, had been engaged io act as guide and chief interpreter, but refused to go, as he knew the Indians to be
in a dangerous mood.<br>
<br>
From the Snake river they marched leisurely along toward old Fort Colville, till on Sunday, May 16th, they found they were surrounded by a great number of Indians who appeared to be waiting for them to enter a narrow ravine through which the road passed.<br>
<br>
It was estimated that there were at least 1,200 Indians and probably many more.  They included Indians from all the tribes east of the Cascades except the Nez Perces.<br>
<br>
A halt was ordered and camp made near a place called Te-hots-ne-mah, where there were groves of quaking aspens and large swales.  It is known, now, to have been very near the present site of the town of Spangle.<br>
<br>
Though camp was made it could hardly be called camping, for the men remained mounted all night.  On the following morning it was very wisely decided to retreat.<br>
<br>
In his reports to Major W. W. Mackall, Assistant Adjutant General at San Francisco, at that time, Col.  Steptoe said: "I moved slowly along until just about to enter a ravine that wound along the bases of several hills, which were all crowed by the excited savages.<br>
<br>
"Perceiving that it was their purpose to attack us in this dangerous place I turned aside and  the whole frenzied mass moving parallel to us, and by yells, taunts and menaces apparently trying to drive us to some initiatory act of violence.<br>
<br>
"Toward light a number of chiefs rode up to talk with me and inquire what were our  motives of this intrusion upon them.  I announced we<br>
were passing on to Colville and had no hostile intentions towards the Spokanes, who had always been our friends, nor towards any other tribes who were friendly; that my chief aim in coming so far was to see the Indians and white people at Colville and by friendly discussion with both try to strengthen their good feelings for each other.<br>
<br>
"They expressed themselves satisfied, but would not consent to let me have canoes, without which it would be impossible to cross the Spokane river.  I  concluded for this reason to-retrace my steps at once and the next morning turned back toward the post."<br>
<br>
The popular idea is and has been that the battle of Steptoe occurred on Steptoe Butte and that the soldiers were besieged on the summit of that butte until almost starved for water.  But the idea is
wrong, for the battle did not occur there nor in that immediate vicinity.<br>
<br>
It was at least fifteen miles north of the butte where the main part of the fight occurred, as was shown by the finding of arms and relics and identification of the spot by Indians many years afterward who were in the battle.  There are many official reports which arevery fragmentary but taken all together the whole account can be pretty accurately worked out.<br>
<br>
On the morning of the 17th, after the retreat began and Father Joset from the Old Mission had visited Steptoe and attempted to reconcile the Indians, Seltice, then a sub-chief of the Coeur d'Alenes, came up to Steptoe and conversed with him as they rode along, professing friendliness.<br>
<br>
Levi, on seeing this, dashed up and struck Seltice on the head with a heavy whip, almost knocking him off his horse, and accusing him of talking with whites to gain their attention while his people could prepare an ambush for them.<br>
<br>
At this turn of affairs Seltice rode off in great anger and a little later a Coeur d'Alene was seen to come near them, dismount and fire into the pack train.<br>
<br>
This was done as they were entering a ravine.  Lieut.  Gaston was detailed with a company to guard the left flank of the column and soon sent a messenger saying he was being fired on and asking for orders.  Col.  Steptoe ordered no firing.  Gastoh asked again for orders and again Steptoe ordered him to hold fire, but one of Gaston's men had been killed; the Indians were closing in, and Gaston did not propose to see his men killed without making a resistance, so he disobeyed and opened fire.<br>
<br>
Lieut.  Gregg was ordered to guard the right flank and Capt.  Taylor was sent ahead to cross a stream now called Pine creek, and occupy the top of a hill.  The Indians seeing this move attempted to gain another hill which commanded the first and at the same time cut Taylor off from the rest of the force and surround him.<br>
A general charge was ordered, bringing the three companies together in the form of a triangle.<br>
<br>
It was here that the most deadly work was done by both sides.<br>
Immediately after this Gaston's riderless borse dashed into the pack train, followed by his men who were out of ammunition.<br>
<br>
Gaston's body was afterward very bravely rescued by men who received special mention and honor from the war department.  One of them, however, was wounded later in the fight and lost from the force during the following night, but in some way he made his way to Snake river where he was killed in a boat set adrift by the Indians, who
amused themselves by shooting at him from the shore.<br>
<br>
A man who was with him succeeded in swimming to the other shore, where he was found and <B>r</B>escued by Humpy, a crippled Nez Perce.<br>
Nearly the whole day of the 17th was taken up in a series of running fights and many counter charges.<br>
<br>
Not long after Gaston was killed, Capt.  Taylor was shot through the neck and as he fell from his horse two of his men jumped from theirs and succeeded in getting him back on and eluded the Indians. He was wounded again later in the day and died before the next morning.<br>
<br>
The command succeeded in gettin<B>g</B> across Pine creek and reaching high hills on the south side by doing very brave and determined righting nearly all day.  But ammunition gave out and they were worn out.<br>
<br>
This high position they held by lying down and only attempting to repel the charges of the Indians.<br>
<br>
It had become apparent by this time that they would have to abandon everything possible in order to get away.  So that night they buried the bodies of their dead comrades along with a Nez Perce boy who had been killed by mistake.  He had slipped among the enemy to capture some of their horses and during a charge a sergeant mistook him for an enemy and ran him through with a sabre.<br>
<br>
In the same trench with the bodies they buried the cannons to keep the Indian from finding them. The cannons had lready been dismounted  and   the   carriages pushed into Pine creek.<br>
<br>
Lieut. Gaston's body, as previously stated, was recovered, but his  head had been cut off.   It   has   never   been   learned   what<br>
Indians did this.<br>
<br>
After the graves were made the men led their horses back and forth over them for a long time to obliterate all indications of having buried anything there.<br>
<br>
It was now that the faithful Timothy volunteered his services as scout to find if possible a means of escape.  Most of the officers were unwilling for him to leave the camp lest he should betray them, but it was finally agreed to let him try.<br>
<br>
He succeeded in slipping through the lines of the enemy and in two hours returned saying the only hope was to climb a steep hill which
the Indians thought inaccessible and was not guarded.  It was agreed to do this and at the dead of night they began the march with Timothy as guide.  All extra horses were left picketed, fires burning, and everything done to give the camp the appearance of being occupied.<br>
<br>
All that night and the following day they continued over the rolling bare country, crossing the Palouse river about two miles below the old trail and near the present site of the town of Palouse.<br>
<br>
When they deserted their camp the packs containing supplies were stacked tip.  Dr. RandoIph wanted to put poison in them but Col.  Steptoe, fearing the whites would stumble across them, would not consent to this.  It was, however, a needless precaution.<br>
<br>
On the next morning when the Indians saw that the camp had been deserted they pounced down on the provisions and began quarrelling among themselves for them, and this is probably one reason why the troops had time to escape before they could be surrounded again.<br>
<br>
On the second night out they reached Snake river at a point opposite the mouth of Alpowa creek, having made a forced march of eighty or ninety miles.  Hore, worn, jaded and hungry. they niade camp.  Col.  Steptoe feared a night attack from the hostiles, but here Timothy once more kindly came between him and danger  by offering a night guard.<br>
<br>
He called forty young men from among his own people, who guarded and scouted around the vicinity all night, thus giving the men the rest they so much needed.<br>
<br>
On the evening of May 20th, as they were making camp a peculiar incident occurred.  While they were picketing their horses a dust cloud was seen up the creek and the clatter of many hoofs was heard.  In a moment or two a band of fifty or sixty Indians appeared around a point, coming at full gallop toward the camp.  The soldiers stampeded, orders were issued, and directions given to prepare for battle, when it was discovered that in the middle of the band waved the stars and stripes.<br>
<br>
It was Chief Lawyer from Kamiah, over a hundred miles distant, accompanied by sub chiefs and noted Nez Perces who wanted Steptoe to turn back and defeat all the Indians north of Snake river.  They pledged the aid of all the Nez Perces.<br>
<br>
It has never been known how they learned of the defeat so quickly, but it is supposed that it was through some sort of signalling, for they knew of the defeat before leaving Kamiah.<br>
<br>
The expedition got back to Fort Walla Walla May 22d.
Later in the same year Col.  Wright was sent out on the same errand as Steptoe, and was eminently successful, giving the Indians a lesson they never forgot.<br>
<br>
He went well prepared and know what to expect.  He dealt out very summary and severe justice and hanged several Indians.  His first engagement with them <B>was </B>at almost the same place in which they at-
tacked Col.  Steptoe.<br>
<br>
He recovered the buried cannon and remains of the men killed In Steptoe's party, and took them back to Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
The Indians of this section have never forgotten him nor his lesson.<br>
<br>
Timothy died in June 1890, having lived ninety years at the mouth of Alpowa creek, his birthplace.  He was never rewarded by the government and became a naturalized citizen and took up a homestead where he lived and on which he planted one of the linest orchards of Snake river valley at that time.  The story of his life would<br>
make an interesting biography.  I think it would be a reasonable and fitting tribute to the memory of a brave <B>man</B> if the people of the Inland Empire should erect a monument, properly inscribed, at the mouth of Alpowa creek.  His life work embraced many brave deeds besides those recorded here.<br>
<br>
Seltice became a firm and fast friend of the white man and also very wealthy.  He died at a very advanced age in January or February, 1902. Col.  Wright was drowned on the bar at the mouth of the Columbia while trying to cross in a storm.<br>

<br>
Major Steptoe informed his Headquarters, Department of the Pacific, by letter dated April 17, 1858, that he planned to lead an expedition from Fort Wall Walla to Colville to try to develop an understanding between the miner-settlers there and the Indians.  En route be stated be would take corrective action against the Palouse Indians for the cattle-stealing raid in the Walla Valley and that he would try to locate and capture the murderers of the two miners. 
The general situation being what it was, the Department of the Pacific offered no objections to Steptoe's proposed expedition.<br>
<br>
On  Thursday  morning,  May  6,  1858,   Steptoe's   command   left For Walla with a strength of  152  enlisted  men  and  five<br>
company officers.  Included were C, E, and H Companies, First Dragoons, and a 25-man mounted detachment from E Company, Ninth Infantry, the latter to man the two twelve-pound mountain howitzers.<br>
<br>
Additional personnel were Assistant Surgeon John Field Randolph; First Lieutenant Hugh Brady Fleming, the commissary officer; civilian packers, and several Nez Perce Indian scouts.<br>
<br>
Departure had been delayed because the assembled baggage was too heavy a load for the pack animals.  When the adjustments had been made the amount of ammunition was reduced to about forty rounds per man.  This limited amount was to be a significant matter several days later, and also the single subject of censure of Steptoe's leadership of the expedition by Winfield Scott, Lieutenant General of the Armies.<br>
<br>
The command did not head directly north for Colville but proceeded in a northeasterly direction for the Red Wolf crossing of the Snake River, located at the mouth  of Alpowa Creek because the hostile Palouses were reported to be gathered in this locality.  Chief Timothy, a long-time friend of the whites and owner of a fleet of canoes, was camped with his band of Nez Perces at this crossing.<br>
<br>
The location of the hostiles, as well as the canoes, probably influenced Steptoe's decision to cross the Snake here.<br>
<br>
The Palouses moved northward when the troops approached the Snake.  Timothy's canoes were used to ferry the soldiers and their baggage across the river, and his people swam the horses to the other side.  After the crossing, the command proceeded down river several miles to the mouth of Skalassams Creek, now named Steptoe Creek, and, by following a route up this stream, reached the plateau north of the Snake.<br>
<br>
The retreating Palouses were then pursued in a leisurely manner over what is believed to be the old Indian trail between Lapwai and Colville.<br>
<br>
While Major Steptoe was camping on the Palouse River eight days out of Fort Walla, some friendly Indians advised him that the Spokanes would resist any movement of troops into their country.  This warning was unexpected but was not considered serious enough to cause any deviations from the northward route bemuse the Spokanes
had been friendly to the whites in the past.<br>
<br>
An uneventful night was spent on May 15 at a camp on Tohoto-nim-me creek near the present town of Rosalia, Washington.  This creek was also called Ingossomen Creek and today is named Pine Creek.  On May 16 the troops continued their march but at about 11 A.m. an estimated force of a thousand to twelve hundred Spokane, Coeur d'Alene, and Yakima Indians suddenly appeared.<br>
<br>
They did not attack, but from their threatening actions, war paint, and attire, it was obvious they were not friendly.  Major Steptoe halted his troops at about a hundred yards distance from the massed Indians.  He told the Indians he wished to parley, and several spokesmen came forward to tell him they had been informed the soldiers had come to make war, and if so, they were ready to fight.<br>
<br>
The major replied that his mission was peaceful, as he was going to Colville to bring about a better understanding between the whites and their Indian neighbors.  His answer somewhat satisfied the Indians, but they said they would not allow him to cross the Spokane River.<br>
<br>
The parley was dismissed when Steptoe saw that little was to be gained by continuing the discussion. He advised his officers to be alert for a fight was possible.<br>
<br>
At this location the terrain was not suited for a small force to battle an overwhelming number of warriors.  Steptoe decided to move on up the trail to find a more favorable site, but cautioned his command not to fire until an order had been given.  The advance was slow because of the crowding Indians.  Steptoe had to abandon the trail when it entered a gulch surrounded by hills that were thronged with Indians.<br>
<br>
They leered and taunted the soldiers when the detour was made.  The troops reached a small lake about a mile away and halted with the water at their backs.  They remained mounted and alert.<br>
<br>
The Indians wished to resume the parley and, when the discussions began, sought to explain their hostile manner.  They asked Steptoe why had he taken such an indirect route to Colvile, and why had he brought the two howitzers with him.  They considered these to be evidences of hostile intent.  They reiterated that there would be no canoes available for him at the Spokane River, and they threatened to destroy the canoes on the Snake to prevent his return to Fort Walla.<br>
<br>
The Indians not engaged in the conference continued to taunt and insult the troops.  In the afternoon the Indians informed the soldiers there would be no fighting that day because it was Sunday, but that they would return to fight Their respect for the Sabbath
was no doubt due to the work of the missionaries who had been among them.  At sunset the Indians withdrew, and by dark none could be seen.<br>
<br>
When the Indians had left, Steptoe reviewed the critical situation his command was facing.  Believing his small force had little chance of reaching Colville against such a large and determined enemy, he decided to return to Fort Walla.  His decision was influenced by the fact that no help could be expected in crossing the Spokane River and by the knowledge that his small supply of ammunition was inadequate for a prolonged fight.<br>
<br>
A messenger was dispatched to Fort Walla to advise the garrison of the situation and of the need for assistance.  But Steptoe realized that delivery of the message would not alleviate the desperate situation the command was facing.<br>
<br>
On the morning of May 17, after an uneasy and restless night, the troops began to retrace their trail.  Second Lieutenant David McMurtrie Gregg with H Company took the lead, with C Company commanded by First Lieutenant (Brevet Captain) Oliver Hazard Perry Taylor following.<br>
<br>
The infantry detachment commanded by Captain Charles Sidney Winder was third in the column, and it was followed by the pack train.  Second Lieutenant Wilham Gaston with E Company brought up the rear.<br>
<br>
The column had gone only a short distance when it was overtaken by Father John Joseph Augustine Joset, a Jesuit priest in charge of the Coeur d'Alene Mission.  Some Christian Indians bad informed Father Joset of the presence of the military in the country and of the contemplated opposition by the tribes.  He had hurriedly ridden ninety miles at the suggestion of the Coeur d'Alene chief, Vincent, who believed Father Joset might be able to avert a disaster.<br>
<br>
Steptoe had not previously met the priest but, although it had been rumored the missionaries were supplying the Indians with powder and were encouraging their hostility toward the government, he greeted Father Joset in a kindly manner.<br>
<br>
Father Joset asked Steptoe to confer again with the chiefs.  The major agreed but insisted that all talking be done on the move be-
cause the restlessness of the pack stock would not permit halting the column.  Father Joset left to bring back the chiefs, but he was able to return with only Chief Vincent and some sub-chiefs of the Coeur d'Alenes.<br>
<br>
Major Steptoe told them he was returning now to Fort Walla because the presence of his command was offensive to the Spokanes and Coeur d'Alenes, and because it would not be possible to reach Colville without their help in crossing the Spokane River.  Unexpectedly one
of Steptoe's Nez Perce scouts stepped forward and struck Chief Vincent with a quirt and accused him of "talking with a crooked tongue."<br>
<br>
Before more could be made of the incident one of Chief Vincents uncles rode up and warned him to leave, as the Palouses were about to open fire.  With this warning Chief Vincent and his companions left, followed by Father Joset.<br>
<br>
By 8,a m, about three miles had been retraced but a <B>large num</B>ber of Indians bad gathered about Lieutenant Gaston's company at the rear of the column.  Suddenly Gaston's company was fired upon, but the dragoons obeyed orders and withheld their fire even though the Indians were sweeping back and forth, shooting at them in an irregular manner.<br>
<br>
Upon receiving no return fire the Indians became quite brave and galloped along the flanks of the column.  Within about twenty minutes all of the troops were under long range fire.<br>
<br>
The route being followed was through narrow bottom lands surrounded by rolling hills.  The five hundred or more Indians recognized the advantage of bolding the higher terrain.  Each time it appeared that the soldiers were heading for a hill the attackers raced madly to head them off.  A large hill in advance of the column appeared to be the objective of a large group of Indians.<br>
<br>
Fire from this hill would have been disastrous to the troops.  Gregg's company was ordered to occupy the hill in advance of the Indians.  He succeeded, but when the Indians saw they had lost the race for this hill, they advanced to another which <B>commanded</B> the first.  Gregg, left some men on the hill he had just taken, and successfully charged the second.<br>
<br>
By this time the units of the command were widely separated.  About a mile of retraced trail had been gained by short charges since the start of the attack.  Each time the dragoons charged, the Indians would scatter, only to wheel about and strike back at the dragoons as they returned to the column.<br>
<br>
Gaston's company at the rear of the column was taking the brunt of the attacks.  By this time one soldier had been killed and Gaston had been wounded in the hand.  Lieutenant Taylor, with C Company, was also fighting desperately, making many short and furious charges from the flanks.  The gunfire and the yelling Indians terrorized the pack train, and the frightened animals required constant attention to prevent them from stampeding.<br>
<br>
About eleven o'clock Captain Winder reached the hill occupied by Gregg.  The two howitzers were brought into action, causing fear but few casualties.  Taylor's and Gaston's companies fought desperately
in an attempt to join up with the rest of the command.  To prevent this union the Indians concentrated their attack on these two companies.  Gregg from his position on the hill, saw a body of Indians in front of Gaston's company.<br>
<br>
When it was apparent Gaston's company was about to charge this group, Gregg ordered his men to charge down the hill at the same time.  The Indians were caught in an angle between the lines of the two charging companies, and they suffered many wounded plus at least twelve fatalities.  Chief Victor of the Coeur d'Alenes and several of his prominent tribesmen were killed in the "angle."<br>
<br>
These losses infuriated the Indians, and the combined companies had to fight vigorously to reach the her which had been held by Winder's men.  In the meantime, by many short charges, Taylor had managed to join Winder and the pack train on the hill.  For the first time in three hours the entire command was united.  Casualties were, so far, one man killed, several animals lost, and a number of men and animals wounded.<br>
<br>
From the hill the troops could see large and apparently increasing groups of Indians on the surrounding heights.  Some were signaling to more distant allies.  Major Steptoe re-formed his command.  Because water was sorely needed, his immediate objective was to reach To-boto-nim-me (Ingossomen) Creek.<br>
<br>
Taylor's and Gaston's companies were assigned protection of the flanks.  Gregg's and Winder's units were ordered to defend the rear and to keep the pack train moving ahead.  Final instructions to the men included the necessity for conserving ammunition.  The movement of the troops down the slope, shortly before noon, was immediately met by Indian demonstrations on all sides.  The crowding of the horde of warriors was so great the troops did not dare charge any distance from the main column for fear they would be cut off.<br>
<br>
About twelve o'clock, E Company attempted to reduce pressure from a group of attackers by charging them.  Lieutenant Gaston was fatally wounded.  His death demoralized his men, but some fought bravely and furiously to save his body from the elated Indians, who were inspired by the killing of a "soldier chief." These Indians, who bad previously retreated from organized charges, now reversed their usual tactics and charged E Company.  Their attack was so fierce that it required the combined efforts of Gregg's and Winder's companies to hold the Indians until Gaston's disorganized dragoons could be re-formed.<br>
<br>
Some of the pack animals were lost because many of the men<br>
attending them had been needed to save E Company.  The command continued to fight as it moved slowly forward, using the<br>
howitzers whenever possible.<br>

While Gaston's company had been under attack, C Company led by Lieutenant Taylor was also fighting vigorously on the other flank.  About 12:30 P.m. Taylor was shot through the neck and tumbled from his horse.  He was lifted back onto his mount while his men fought a gallant hand-to-hand fight with the Indians who rushed in when he fell.  First Lieutenant James C. Wheeler, Jr., took over Taylor's company.<br>
<br>
Major Steptoe decided that it was not possible for a moving column to continue such a fight and that a defensive position was required.  His command was now about half a mile north of the campsite used the night of May 15. Ahead and to the left was a long ridge with a high point on one  end.<br>
<br>
The column moved to its summit.  The horses were picketed in the center of the knoll, and the men took prone positions in a circle around the crest.  One howitzer was placed with a field of fire down the slope and the other was aimed along the ridge.<br>
<br>
The hill was completely surrounded by determined Indians who kept up a constant fire on the troops.  Some of it came from warriors on distant hills and some from Indians who had crept up the slope to shoot at closer range.  Organized charges by dismounted Indians were repulsed several times, but each charge taxed the depleted supply of ammunition.<br>
<br>
If these attacks continued, the command knew it was but a matter of time until they would be annihilated by a frenzied charge of hostiles, who now outnumbered them eight to one.  The strength of the companies was weakened by the loss of those killed and wounded; they were also suffering from lack of water; their ammunition was down to two or three rounds per man; and they were strained and fatigued.<br>
<br>
Eight hours of constant action after an almost sleepless night had left them in poor condition for more fighting.  At sunset the Indians withdrew, believing they could finish off the soldiers later.  The withdrawal was a relief to the besieged soldiers, but the ring of twinkling campfires reminded them of what the next day would bring forth.  Surgeon Randolph attended Lieutenant Taylor and the other wounded.  Unfortunately Taylor's  wound was so severe that he died on the hill.<br>
<br>
Major Steptoe discussed the almost hopeless situation with his officers.  He first believed the command should remain on the hill, but decided to leave it after several of his officers convinced him that the odds for survival were better if an escape was attempted.<br>
<br>
One of the Nez Perce scouts was sent to find a way through the encirclement, and Lieutenant Gregg was assigned the duty of preparing for the evacuation.  The dead that could be reached were buried.  The two howitzers were dismantled and also buried.  The
light-colored horses were blanketed, and all loose equipment that might rattle was tied down.<br>
<br>
The scout returned with a report of a gap in the Indian lines in the direction away from the trail.  Those of the fifteen wounded who could not sit their saddles unaided were lashed to their horses.  Only supplies that could be tied to the saddles were taken.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Wheeler's dragoons, accompanied by Captain Winder's infantry and the wounded, led off about 10 P.m. All supplies, camp equipment and extra animals were left behind.  Campfires were not extinguished.  The first group left so quietly that the remaining dragoons on picket duty or busy preparing for the departure did not hear them leave.  Little time was wasted in the final evacuation when Surgeon Randolph, who had assisted the first group, advised Gregg that the others had left.<br>
<br>
Father Joset wrote later that the Indians had planned to maintain a round-the-clock attack by means of reliefs.  The Coeur d'Alenes had the night shift and were to be relieved in the morning by their allies.  About midnight the Coeur d'Alenes were then surprised to find the hill unoccupied after they had made an assault.  They did not notify the other Indians of the evacuation and did not pursue the troops, because the abandoned supplies and equipment became their first interest.<br>
<br>
When the Spokanes returned in the morning they apparently decided that it would not be possible to overtake the fleeing soldiers.<br>
It is estimated to be ninety miles from the her beside To-hotonun-me Creek to Red Wolf crossing.  At dawn the weary troops stopped for a brief rest after crossing the Palouse River.  They had ridden at a fast pace most of the night, anticipating that the Indians would overtake them.<br>
<br>
Twenty-four hours after leaving the battle field they arrived at Chief Timothy's camp on the Snake River.  They were welcomed by the Nez Perces, who fed them and guarded the camp the remainder of the night while the soldiers slept.<br>
<br>
The troops pushed on to Fort Walla after spending most of the next morning crossing the river.  An uneasy moment occurred when a large party of Indians was seen approaching.  The troops deployed into a defensive formation but, as the Indians drew near, saw a large American flag in their midst.<br>
<br>
Word of the fight had reached Chief Lawyer, and he and about sixty Nez Perce warriors had come to offer their services.  The offer was declined, as Steptoes command was in no condition to fight a return engagement.  The march continued to a campsite about fifteen miles from the crossing of the Snake.  A welcome sight that evening was the appearance of Captain Frederick Tracy Dent with B Company, Ninth
Infantry, and provisions from the fort.<br>
<br>
Steptoe's messenger, who had left the night before the fight, had reached Fort Walla after a 125-mile ride.  Dent had lost little time in starting out and by forced marching had met<br>
Steptoe a little short of the midway point.  Two days later the entire command reached Fort Walla.<br>
<br>
Two weeks had elapsed since the expedition had left the fort.  In that time Steptoe's men had fought gallantly against a foe that outnumbered them eight to one, and had miraculously escaped from an almost certain massacre.<br>
<br>
The final losses were two officers, ten men, and three friendly Indians killed, plus ten men wounded, and 29 horses killed or lost from wounds in the "Battle of To-hoto-nhn-me." The exact hostile losses are not known, but acknowledged losses were nine killed and 40 or 50 wounded.<br>

STEPTOE'S BATTLE.<br>
<br>
Robert M. Utley and Wilcomb E. Washburn, "The Yakima War," <B>American Heritage Library of Indian Wars.</B> Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1977. p. 177-181.<br>
<br>
Many of the regular soldiers sent to the Northwest to try to maintain peace between Indians and  whites viewed the Indians more compassionately. They found themselves torn between duty to protect threatened settlers and a duty to protect innocent Indians.  Thus, to the dismay and fury of the local whites, the army pursued an ambiguous course, sometimes helping parties of citizens to run down offending Indians, but also sometimes standing between such parties and their intended victims.<br>
<br>
More and more the settlers responded by forming the kind of vol-
unteer force that Colonel Gilliam had led against the Cayuses in 1848.<br>
<br>
Embodying the conflicting viewpoints were Isaac I. Stevens and John E. Wool.  Stevens was a brash young man of great ambition and enthusiasm.  In 1853 he resigned an army commission to accept appointment as governor of Washington Territory, which had been carved out of Oregon north of the Columbia River.  En route west
Stevens headed one of the War Department's Pacific railway surveys, marking out a northern route for a transcontinental railroad.<br>
<br>
As governor he set himself the task of clearing all his territory of Indian land titles, restricting the natives to reservations, and promoting settlement.  His <B>methods</B> featured the fast talk. bluster. and intimidition that <B>so</B> helped to discredit the treaty system.<br>
<br>
John E. Wool was the opinionated and combative little general who headed the army's Pacific department, with headquarters in San Francisco.  A stiff professional with forty-two years service and a bright Mexican War reputation, Wool openly sympathized with the lnd ans.  He directed his field officers not to fight Indians unless forced to do so, and at all other times to persuade the tribes to become peaceful.<br>
<br>
Wool condemned the citizens for their exterminatory attitudes.  Their readiness to fight their own battles in territorial volunteer units, he felt, sprang less from genuine impulses of self-defense than from a cynical intent to plunder the Indians of stock and other property while also billing the federal government for pay, equipment, and supplies.  Wool considered Stevens a scoundrel and Oregon's Governor George Curry little better, and he did not shrink from feuding with them publicly and vitriolically.<br>
<br>
In the autumn of 1855 the Northwest erupted into open hostilities on two fronts.  In the mountainous Rogue River country of southern Oregon, Captain Andrew Jackson Smith, the tough, fair-minded commander of Fort Lane, had long labored to keep the peace, not hesitating to interpose his dragoon company between frightened Indians and wrathful settlers.....<br>
<br>
Robert M. Utley and Wilcomb E. Washburn, "The Yakima War," <B>American Heritage Library of Indian Wars.</B> Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1977, p. 177-181.<br>
<br>
The simultaneous war on a second front sprang from some of Stevens's treaties even as the governor pushed deep into the northern Rockies to conclude still more.  The first treaties bound the tribes of the Columbia Basin to exchange their lands for reservations.<br>
<br>
This prospect, coupled with a gold rush across their domain to Colville, alarmed the wise and forceful Yakima chief Kamiakin, long the most powerful native leader of the Columbia Basin.  Kamiakin forged an alliance of tribes aimed at contai 'ning the whites on the west side of the Cascades.<br>
<br>
In September 1855 a group of young braves that included Qualchin.  Kamiakin's nephew murdered six whites- Kamiakin, while not condoning the killings, sent word that a like fate awaited all Bostons who crossed the mountains.  When a military reconnaissance tested the ultimatum in October, five hundred warriors chased it back to Fort
Dalles in disorder.<br>
<br>
Like the Rogue River conflict, the Yakima War quickly became the province of volunteers.  Advancing up the Columbia, the Oregon militia pushed the Wallawallas into hostility.  The Oregonians seized the respected Chief Peo-Peo-Mox-Mox at a truce parley, shot and killed him, and sent his ears and scalp home for display.<br>
<br>
The militia also rescued Governor Stevens, returning from his treaty-making sojourn.  Stevens excoriated General  Wool for keeping the regulars in their forts and demanded his removal for "utter and signal incapacity" and "criminal neglect of my safety." Wool in turn scored "the two war governors" for provoking a needless war solely in the interest "Of plunder of the Indians and the treasury of the United States."<br>
<br>
Not until the spring of 1856, much to Stevens's annoyance, did General Wool mount a regular army offensive.  Colonel George Wright, a veteran of thirty-four years in the army, commanded the five-hundred-man infantry column.  After some initial skirmishing at the Cascades of the Columbia, the troops passed almost two months trying to bridge the swollen Naches River.<br>
<br>
When they finally got across in mid-June, they found no one to fight.  Kamiakin and other war leaders had fled eastward, to other tribes beyond the Columbia.  Wherever Wright marched, he found Indians placidly harvesting the spring salmon crop.<br>
<br>
Although Stevens's volunteers routed a group of Wallawallas in July, killing forty, the Yakima War ended inconclusively.  The Indians continued to roam their homeland, unconquered and unconfined by reservations.  Stevens complained that the Indians scorn our people and our flag and denominate us as a nation of old women."<br>
<br>
The people of Oregon and Washington were dissatisfied with the vague nature of the "peace," scandalized at the army's apparent sympathy with the Indians, and outraged over Wool's attacks on Stevens and the militia.  Largely because of this negative public opinion, well coordinated by the two governors, Wool was relieved of duty in May 1857 and replaced by Newman S. Clarke.<br>
<br>
The only visible consequences of the Yakima War were the <B>building</B> of two forts: Simcoe and Walla Walia.  They would provide bases from which to prosecute the next war-which would not end so inconclusively.  To Kamiakin and other chiefs, the Yakima War left a legacy of rancor that would contribute to future trouble.<br>
<br>
Still bristling with war fervor, Kamiakin sounded the alarm among the tribes east of the Columbia River: there must be a general uprising or else the white people would seize their land and enslave their women.  Violence between Indians and gold seekers headed for Colville, together with continuing apprehension about the Stevens treaties, gave force to his words.<br>

By 1858 almost any provocation could have brought about the alliance he urged.  In May of that year the Indians discovered that a column of white soldiers had crossed the Snake River and was advancing boldly into the heart of their country.<br>
<br>
The military command, out of Fort Walla Walla, consisted of three companies of dragoons, a detachment of infantry, and two howitzers, 164 men in all.  The commander, Lieutenant Colonel Edward J. Steptoe, intended to march to Colville to reassure the miners, showing the flag en route to the increasingly aggressive Palouses, Spokanes, and Coeur d'Alenes.<br>
<br>
As he proceeded, hundreds of warriors, mounted and painted for a fight, swarmed on his flanks.  And one evening their chiefs, presenting themselves at Steptoe's bivouac, bluntly ordered him out of their country.<br>
<br>
Badly outnumbered, Steptoe prudently submitted to the demand.  On May 17 he turned back.  But the warriors, inflamed by the tensions of the confrontation, attacked anyway.  All day they stabbed at the retreating column.  The dragoons fanned out to screen the flanks and rear, and close combat flared on all sides.  Mortal wounds felled two officers.  The short musketoons of the horse soldiers barely held back the Indian forays.<br>
<br>
Finally, at noon, Steptoe halted on a hilltop in order to use his artillery.  The howitzers and the rifles of the infantry kept the assailants at a distance, but they surrounded the hill.  That night, with ammunition down to three rounds per man, the officers discussed their predicament.  Annihilation seemed inescapable.<br>
<br>
Steptoe argued for a fight to the last man on the hill.  His officers urged an escape plan, and at length they prevailed.  Burying the dead and leaving the howitzers and other equipment behind, the troops shouldered the wounded and groped their way quietly down dark slopes successfully <B>circled the Indian</B> camps without rousing the warriors, and by daybreak were safely on the way to Fort Walla Walla.<br>
<br>
Steptoe's dazzling escape scarcely offset the humiliation.  Army leaders reacted with outrage.  "You will attack all hostile Indians with vigor," General Clarke instructed Colonel Wright.  "Make their punishment severe, and persevere until the submission of all is complete." Especially to be sought were Kamiakin, his brother-in-law Owhi, and Owhi's militant son Qualchin, who had helped precipitate the Yakima War three years earlier.<br>
<br>
Colonel Wright's campaign fulfilled the most optimistic hopes.  Some officers had predicted the usual futile and exhausting march in search of Indians who would not stand and fight . But the rout of
Steptoe had elated the foe and left them spoiling for another fight.  Late in August some six hundred gathered on the Great Spokane Plain, southwest of present-day Spokane, Washington, to contest Wright's advance.<br>
<br>
It was a foolish move, for thereby they fought on his terms.  New long-range infantry rifles, backed by artillery, easily outgunned the short trade muskets and bows and arrows of the Indians.  In the battles of Spokane Plain and Four Lakes, September 1 and 5, 1858, he showed the tribesmen the dangers of challenging the white man in open battle where superior firepower, discipline, and organization could prevail.<br>
<br>
Chastened, the Indians returned to their homes.  But Colonel Wright was not ready to let them shed the label of "hostile" so easily.  Grimly he marched from tribe to tribe exacting submission and seizing Indians accused of depredations or of complicity in the attack on Steptoe.  Fifteen he summarily hanged, and others he put in irons.<br>
<br>
Kamiakin, severely injured in the Battle of Spokane Plain when a bursting artillery shell dropped a tree limb on him, sought safety in the British possessions to the north.  When Owhi came to make peace with Wright, he was seized and forced upon penalty of death to summon Qualchin.  When Qualchin appeared he was hanged almost immediately.  Owhi, grieving over his son's death, was shot and killed while trying to escape.<br>
<br>
Wright's harsh measures, however dubious their humanity or even their legality, decisively and permanently smothered the spirit of resistance among the Indians of the Columbia Basin.  In 1859 Congress at last approved all the Stevens treaties.  Even before Congress acted, two thousand settlers had taken up claims in the Walla Walla valley, the vanguard of an immigration that would overspread the entire basin.<br>
<br>
Resignedly the dispossessed Indians accepted the fate spelled out in the Stevens treaties and went to the reservations assigned them.  Ultimately Kamiakin returned to live out his life quietly on the reservation, a defeated and embittered man, a personification of the tragedy that had overtaken his people.<br>

STEPTOES BATTLE.<br>

<br>
"Steptoe's Battle," <B>The New Washington Historian.</B> II (December, 1936), p. 5.<br>
<br>
Colonel Steptoe was sent north to assure protection to the gold-seekers at Colville.  He found that the friendly Spokanes, through whose lands he had to march, had turned hostile and he was forced to fight.  After a running battle his soldiers were worn out and were also short of ammunition.<br>
<br>
Towards night they took a stand on a hill, now called Steptoe Butte, and soon were compl'etely surrounded by Indians.  The officers talked the matter over and decided that as they had but three rounds of ammunition left, they must attempt a retreat.<br>
<br>
A retreat may sometimes show as much military skill as a battle and this one was well conducted.  All white horses were covered wit4 blankets, all buckles and any thing which might make a noise were muffled, the wounded were tied to their saddles and the troops prepared to slip away in the night.<br>
<br>
Scouts reported the Indians had withdrawn from the south and were now in camp for they did not like to fight at night.  The retreat began so silently that the last company did not know the first had gone until they were informed.  All were away by eleven o'clock and dawn saw them at the Palouse river although they were tired from fighting and the march was hard.<br>
<br>
Twenty four hours from the time they left camp, they were safe on the Snake river and the friendly Nez Perce squaws were taking care of the wounded.<br>
<br>
Colonel Steptoe himself took the blame for the shortage of ammunition rather than let it be held against any of his men.<br>

THE BATTLE OF ROSALIA.<br>
<br>
Mary W. Avery, "The Battle of Rosalia," <B>History and Government of the State of Washington.</B> Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1961, p. 174-176.<br>
<br>
Until 1858, however, the United States Army officers in the interior continued to believe that a decisive battle with the Indians was not necessary.  That attitude, however, was changed suddenly in May of that year by the defeat of Colonel Steptoe in the neighborhood of present Rosalia Washington.  Steptoe left Fort Walla Walla with 158 men on May 1 6, 1858, intending to try to find some Indian cattle thieves, confer with the Spokane Indians, and go on to Colville to investigate reports that the Indians there were becoming hostile.  
Since he regarded his expedition as an investigative one and some-
thing in the nature of a peace mission, he evidently felt no necessity for seeing that his men had a normal supply of ammunition.  In fact, the quantity taken amounted only to forty rounds for each soldier.  Later, some of the soldiers said that the packer loaded liquor in preference to ammunition, but that was denied.<br>
<br>
Near present Rosalia, Steptoe's party met over six hundred Spokane Indians on horses, who warned the whites that they would not help them cross the Spokane River because they feared that Steptoe intended to attack them.  Steptoe camped there that night and the following day turned back toward Fort Walla Walla when Father Joseph Joset from the Coeur d'Alene mission brought one of the chiefs up to Steptoe to see if an attack could be averted by another conference.<br>
<br>
Steptoe thought another parley would be useless, and the whites had continued only a few miles when the Indians began to fire on them.  Because Steptoe's troops had so little ammunition, they had to make a charge which would drive the Indians off long enough for them to dash to a more protected spot.  In several advances of this kind, they reached the hill just to the east of what is now Rosalia, where a monument now commemorates the battle.<br>
<br>
On the dash for the hill, two officers and one private were killed.  Twelve Indians were killed, including three prominent Coeur d'Alene leaders, and Steptoe knew that such a loss would make the Indians more determined to continue the fight.  Without more ammunition, however, the whites were certain to be captured, and furthermore, their situation was becoming desperate because they could not get to water from their position on the hill.  Consequently, Steptoe de-
cided to make an attempt to get his men away after dark when the Indians left the battlefield for the night.<br>
<br>
As soon as scouts investigated and found that the Indians had left, the whites buried the dead and strapped the wounded men onto their horses.  They left their extra horses and supplies on the hill.  Then they rode down the hill as silently as possible, and) as soon as they were far enough away that they thought the Indians could not hear them, they galloped as fast as possible south toward the Snake River.<br>
<br>
By dawn they had reached the Palouse River and needed very badly to stop to let their horses rest.  However, although they saw no signs of pursuing Indians, they were afraid to risk stopping and hurried on, reaching a Nez Perce village that night at the ' point where Alpowa Creek enters Snake River.<br>
<br>
They learned later that when the Indians returned the next morning to finish the battle on the Rosalia hill, they quarreled over dividing up the supplies left by Steptoe and so were late starting after the white soldiers.  Otherwise, they might have overtaken
Steptoe and his men.<br>
<br>
As it was, the pursuing Indians found out when they got near the Nez Perce camp that the whites were spending the night there under their protection and, consequently, they retired.  The Nez Perces used their boats the next morning to take Steptoe's party across the Snake, and it continued to Fort Walla Walla without further trouble.<br>
<br>
In later years because Steptoe Butte, not far from Rosalia, was named for Colonel Steptoe, people began to think that the battle was fought on it.  That was not the case, howevers and historians now usually refer to Steptoe's encounter as the Battle of Rosalia in order to place it properly in its geographical setting.<br>
<br>
Some controversial points about the campaign may never be settled definitely.  There were reports that Timothy, a friendly Nez Perce who lived at the Alpowa village (known as Red Wolf's Crossing), stayed with Steptoe after he ferried the soldiers across the Snake on their way to the Spokane country and helped get them back through a short cut on their flight to the Snake after the battle.<br>
<br>
Some of the officers with the expedition later insisted, however, that Timothy was not with the troops and gave no help except with ferrying them across the river.  Kamiakin is said by some writers to have been present at the battle, urging the Indians to fight.  Others have evidence that he was miles away and had nothing to do with it.<br>
<br>
Another puzzling point has been the ease with which the white soldiers got away in the night without making enough noise to arouse the Indians camping nearby.  Judge William C. Brown of Okanogan in an unpublished manuscript tells of a probable agreement between the Nez Perces with Steptoe and the Coeur d'Alenes who guarded the Pine Creek ford which Steptoe's troops had to cross to escape.<br>
<br>
Judge Brown says, ". - - the inevitable conclusion to be drawn from all the facts and circumstances, is that in the early evening a deal was arranged between the Coeur d'Alene fighting leaders in the field in the southern sector, and Steptoe's Nez Perce auxiliaries, prob-
ably Levi and Chief Timothy's nephew, whereby it was proposed that if Colonel Steptoe would abandon everything to the Coeur d'Alenes, they would permit the command to pass through the ford, which con-
stituted the only possible crossing of Pine Creek available, and would then secretly and without the knowledge of the Palouse and Spokanes, permit the command to start its escape retreat toward Snake River, taking with them nothing but the saddle horses they were riding and their firearms and such individual effects as they carried on their persons."<br>

STEPTOE.<br>
<br>
Charles Carey, "The defeat of Steptoe," <B>General History of Oregon.</B> Portland: Binfords and Mort, 1971, p. 614-620<br>
<br>
Reports of disaffection among the tribes, together with rumors, which now reached Clarke through official channels, to the effect that Mormons, in Utah, were supplying Indians with ammunition and fomenting disorder among them, caused Clarke, early in January, 1858, to direct Steptoe to place his command in a state of full efficiency, at the earliest possible date, for the purpose of going on an expedition to obtain full information in relation to the eastern tribes.<br>
<br>
Steptoe reported, January 29, 1858, that he doubted that the Indians in the immediate vicinity of Walla Walla were disposed to involve themselves in war, but that he believed that the Palouse, Yakima and Spokane tribes awaited only slight encouragement to revive hostilities.<br>
<br>
Only a day later Maj.  R. S. Garnett, commanding the military post at Fort Simeoe, sent word that he had received word for the second time from Skloom, brother of Kamiakin, that Mormon emissaries had been among the Yakimas, seeking to incite them to hostility toward the United States.<br>
<br>
As a result of this condition, and in obedience to the order of General Clarke, Colonel Steptoe left Fort Walla Walla, May 6, 1858, with three companies of dragoons and a detachment . of mounted infantry, 158 men in all.<br>
<br>
Two of the dragoon companies were armed with the musketoon, a short gun of musket pattern, but incapable of efficient execution at any great range.  At the last moment of loading the pack train, it was found that the baggage exceeded the carrying capacity of the train, and a large portion of the ammunition was left behind.  Steptoe's mission being peaceful, rather than punitive, this omission did not then attract attention.<br>
<br>
The route of Steptoe's march also was fateful.  Leaving Walla Walla, he travelled northeast to the Snake river, which he reached at the mouth of Alpowa creek, where the friendly Nez Perce's chief, Timothy, had a fleet of large canoes likely to be useful in making the crossing, and also where, he had been informed, a large party of Palouses were gathering.<br>
<br>
He then followed a succession of Indian trails which led him close to the present Washington-Idaho boundary line, and so doing, he
approached very near to the country of the Coeur d'Alenes; whereas, a direct route from Walla Walla to Colville by the then travelled trails would have led him thirty miles or more to the westward.<br>
<br>
On reaching the Palouse river and being about to attempt a crossing, he was informed that the Spokanes and Coeur d'Alenes would oppose his entrance to their country.  He continued his march, however, meeting occasional parties of Indians, probably spies, who professed friendship and had ample opportunity to obtain information concerning the strength of his command.<br>
<br>
On Sunday, May 15, 1858, while the column was encamped on Pine creek, a tributary of the Palouse, a band of mounted warriors variously estimated at from 1000 to 1500, Spokanes, Yakimas, Palouses and Coeur d'Alenes, appeared suddenly from the hills.  Spokanes and Coeur d'Alenes, acting as spokesmen, told Steptoe they had been inforzned that he had come to annihilate them, and said that if this were so they were ready to fight.<br>
<br>
In reply to Steptoe's explanation that he was merely on his way to Colville on a friendly mission, the Indians retorted that he had not come by the most direct route to Colville, and pointed to his howitzers as confirmation of their belief in his warlike purpose.  Appreciating the fact that he was outnumbered seven to one, and that the Indians carried rifles of longer range than the musketoons of his own dragoons, Steptoe resolved to retrace his steps.<br>
<br>
The Indians, who had not forgotten their early religious training, told Steptoe that they would not fight on Sunday; but they opened the attack as soon as the retrograde movement was begun, on the morning of May 18, and surrounded the troops, who took refuge on a hill near the present site of Rosalia, Washington, where the battle continued into the night.<br>
<br>
Reduced to three rounds of -ammunition for each man, Steptoe then abandoned his howitzers and pack train, and retreated under cover of darkness by a forced march of eighty miles to Snake river crossing.<br>
<br>
He had suffered the loss of a captain and a lieutenant and six enlisted men, killed, and eleven wounded, and left his dead hastily buried in shallow graves on the battlefield.  The prestige of the army was impaired and the confidence of the native tribes was strengthened by this military failure.<br>
<br>
Steptoe's defeat, however, hastened the conclusion of hostilities in that region by putting the whole army on its mettle, and by convincing General Clarke that hostiles could be brought to terms only by punishing them.<br>
<br>
The expedition which Clarke now organized omitted no detail of equipment that would make fulfillment of its purpose certain.  He obtained, as reinforcements, three companies of artillery from San
Francisco, one company of the Fourth infantry from Fort Jones, and another from the Umpqua district, and he concentrated nearly 2000 men of all arms at Fort Walla Walla, where they were diligently drilled in the tactics of Indian warfare.<br>
<br>
Command of the expedition was committed to Colonel Wright, who sent three companies under Major Garnett to the Yakima country, to drive the Indians east toward the main column, which meanwhile proceeded north.<br>
<br>
Wright took the precaution before starting out, however, to make a formal treaty of friendship with the Nez Perce's, with a view to protecting his rear, and this curious compact was signed August 6, 1858, by Wright for the government of the United States and by 38 chiefs and sub-chiefs of the Nez Perce's.<br>
<br>
It was subsequently countersigned by General Clarke, at Fort Vancou-
ver, but it never received the consideration of the senate.  How-
ever, it was faithfully kept by the tribe, until 1877, when its first article was violated by Chief Joseph, who was pursued by Gen. 0. 0. Howard across the present states of Idaho and western Montana, and who finally surrendered to Gen.  Nelson A. Miles.<br>

<br>
BATTLE AT VICTORIA.<br>
<br>
Edward S. Curtis, "Allied Puget Sound tribes strike Northern Indians at Victoria," <B>The North American Indian.</B> IX, p. 14-16.<br>
<br>
There was constant internal strife (rather thieving and assassina-
tion than war) among the Puget Sound Indians, but on rare occasions there was cooperation for the purpose of checking the warlike northern tribes who made life so uncertain for the men and slavery an everpresent possibility for women and children.<br>
<br>
In the very early years of the nineteenth century a great flotilla bore northward a host of southern fighting men, of whom only six ever returned to tell of the fearful slaughter at the hands of the Cowichan tribes of the southeast coast of Vancouver island.<br>
<br>
In organizing this ill-fated expedition, couriers were despatched far and wide among the tribes, and there assembled warriors of the 
Suquamish under the leadership of Kitsap,<B> </B>Squaxon and Sahewamish under Kolush; Stehtsasamish under Swiyap; Shomamish under T'hwdtkdt; Dwamish and Stukamish under Huloqub; Puyallup under Chidaskud; Nisqualli and Klickitat under Tshoultid; Upper Chehalis under Tselis; and Cowlitz under Wieno.<br>
<br>
The warriors of the inland tribes Cowlitz, Chehalis, and Klickitat were furnished canoes by the Nisqualli and the Puyallup, and the fleet proceeded northward, passing between Whidbey island and the mainland.  Here they laid in supplies of food by pillaging small villages of the Snohomish and the Skagit, and turned westward, coasting along the southern shores of the San Juan archipelago.<br>
<br>
In what is now Victoria harbor they attacked a Sooke village, pursued the fleeing inhabitants to an inland prairie where the Sooke had been wont to find safety from marauders, killed a few, and captured a considerable number, including the chief Hwchilub.  Now Hwchilub had received information that a large party of Cowichan and Sanetch warriors, bound for the southern coast of the Strait of Juan de Fuca to raid the Clallam settlements, would that very day stop at the Sooke village.<br>
<br>
Knowing that if his captors were attacked their first act would be the immediate execution of their prisoners, he imparted the news and advised them to embark without delay.  The southerners however were incredulous, and spent the remainder of the morning digging camas in the meadow, while the main body back at the village continued their work of looting the houses.<br>
<br>
About noon the camas diggers returned, to find that the others had
taken their booty and prisoners aboard.  The roots and the second lot of captives were at once stowed away, and the raiders were just pushing off when around the point swung a fleet of Cowichan and Sanetch war-canoes.  The newcomers drew up at a respectful distance and addressed the others in a friendly manner; for they intended to take some Clallam village by surprise, and had no desire for a bloody pitched battle.<br>
<br>
But the southerners, taking their friendly overtures as a sign of fear, began to taunt them and to threaten them.  Wi6no, the Cowlitz chief, leaped up in his canoe, waved his arms, and called on his companions to show their "fighting medicine." Then he raised a war-song.  At this unmistakable evidence of hostile intention, the Cowichan backed,water, massed their canoes, and began their impressive war-chant in unison.<br>
<br>
The canoes of the allies moved forward, and at the same time the Sooke captives were run through with spears and thrown overboard to drown.  The chief however leaped into the water and swam unharmed to the Cowichan.  Water fights as a rule were at very close quarters, short spears being the principal weapons, and in such a combat the Cowichan, in their larger, heavier canoes, possessed a great advantage.<br>
<br>
As their enemies closed in, divided into compact groups for mutual protection, they drove their great canoes crashing into the smaller craft, sometimes sinking them and always scattering them.  And the crew of a single canoe of the allies were no match for the twenty or more warriors of a Cowichan war-canoe.  Seeing this, the allies began to lash their canoes together, two and two, so that a solid front of spears could be presented to the enemy; but all in vain, for already the tide of victory was so strongly against them that it could not be stemmed.  Many of the southern invaders, par-
ticularly the inland tribes, had never fought on water, and scores went down because of their very inaptitude.<br>
<br>
The Sahewamish contingent fought stubbornly, keeping their canoes well together and presenting an unbroken front; but one by one their warriors fell, one by one the canoes were abandoned.  Sud-
denly a few lucky paddle-strokes carried a canoe out of the thick of the mElEe.  Three men leaped ashore and escaped into the sheltering thicket.  One of them was the chief Kolush.<br>
<br>
Early in the fight Kitsap, perceiving that continued resistance could mean only destruction, urged his Suquamish to break for<br>
liberty toward the open water of the strait.  The attempt was made, but only Kitsap's canoe escaped.  Tulebot, one of his two compan-
ions received an arrow in his eye, and the other was wounded in the chest and the thigh.<br>
<br>
A rain of arrows fell about the fleeing craft, but Kitsap was an
expert with the bow and held his pursuers at bay until they abandoned the chase.<br>
<br>
After the departure of the victorious northerners, Kolush and his two companions made a small raft, and with sticks for paddles they succeeded in reaching the upper end of Whidbey island, where they were picked up by some Clallam and set over on the mainland near the site of Port Townsend.  Here they borrowed a canoe and pro-
ceeded homeward.<br>

BATTLE OF WOUNDED KNEE.<br>
<br>
Robert M. Utley and Wilcomb E. Washburn, "The Battle of Wounded Knee," <B>American Heritage Library of Indian Wars.</B> Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1977. p. 298-301.<br>
<br>
One other chief who worried General [Nelson] Miles [after the death of Sitting Bull] was Big Foot, whose band of Miniconjou Sioux lived in rude cabins on the Cheyenne River a few miles below its forks.  Actually, though once a leading Ghost Dancer, Big Foot had lost confidence in the religion.<br>
<br>
Miles did not know that, however, and he planned to have him arrested.  But like Sitting Bull, Big Foot had already received an invitation from Pine Ridge.  It was not from the dancers in the Stronghold but from Red Cloud and other "friendlies" at the agency, who wanted him to bring his well-known peace-making talents to bear on the troubles with the whites.  On December 23, therefore, before Miles's orders for his arrest could be carried out, Big Foot and his band abandoned their village and journeyed south toward Pine Ridge.<br>
<br>
Miles naturally assumed that Big Foot was headed for the Stronghold, where his appearance could not be more untimely.  Brooke's agents had at last persuaded many of the dancers to move to the agency; the slightest incident might stampede them<br>
back to the Stronghold.  Vigorously, therefore, Miles's columns laced the prairies and badlands between the Cheyenne and White rivers looking for the Miniconjous.<br>
<br>
Not until December 28 were they found, and then scarcely thirty miles from the Pine Ridge Agency.  The intercepting unit was a squadron of the 7th Cavalry, Custer's old regiment.  Big Foot, struck down by pneumonia, lay in his wagon, but he persuaded Major Samuel M. Whitside that he meant no harm.  Together the Indians and soldiers camped for the night twenty miles east of the agency beside a pleasant stream called Wounded Knee Creek.<br>
<br>
Although the Sioux awoke on December 29 with a sense of fear and distrust, neither they nor the troopers intended to have a fight.  There were only 350 Indians, and 230 of these were women and children.  Furthermore, the soldiers had been strengthened during the night by the other squadron of the regiment and now counted about 500 men.  Colonel James W Forsyth had taken command.  He posted his men on all sides of the Indian camp.  From a nearby hill four Hotchkiss cannon pointed at the tepees.<br>
<br>
Clearly resistance would be suicidal. For his part,  pursuant to orders, Colonel Forsyth planned to disarm the Indians and escort them to the railroad, in Nebraska, to be taken out of the zone of
military operations.<br>
<br>
But as the soldiers began to search for the Indians guns powerful emotions built up on both sides.  A medicine man pranced about inciting the men to fight-their ghost shirts would protect them.  The troopers grew more and more nervous.  One seized a deaf man to take away h's rifle. it went off.  The medicine man tossed a handful of dirt in the air.  A knot of warriors threw off their blankets and leveled their Winchesters at a rank of cavalrymen.  Both sides fired at once, and the fight that neither side intended or expected burst upon them.<br>
<br>
The clash at Wounded Knee was a horror of murderous fighting.  Soldiers and Indians faced each other at close range and shot, stabbed, and clubbed one another.  A bullet shattered Lieutenant John C. Gresham's elbow.  Another carried away the top of Captain George C. Wallace's head.  A warrior slashed at interpreter Philip Wells with a long knife and left his nose hanging by a shred of skin.<br>
<br>
Weakly Big Foot rose from his pallet to watch.  A volley killed him and most of the other chiefs behind hint.  As the two sides separated, the Hotchkiss guns went into action, each belching forth 50 rounds a minute.  The exploding shells flattened the Indian camp and filled the air with deadly flying fragments.<br>
<br>
A participant remembered seeing a shell punch a six-inch hole in a man's stomach.  Caught in the fire, women and children went down along with the men.  In less than an hour most of the fighting had ended.  The battlefield was a scene of carnage.  Almost two thirds of Big Foot's band had been cut down-at least 150 dead and 50 wounded, perhaps more who were never reported.  The army lost 25 killed and 39 wounded.<br>
<br>
Wounded Knee, of course, ruined the peace initiative.  Miles later preferred charges against Forsyth for the killing of women and children, but the colonel won exoneration.  Both "hostiles" and "friendlies," alike outraged by the slaughter of their people, united in White Clay valley, north of Pine Ridge Agency.  Their encampment contained four thousand people, including some eight hundred to a thousand angry, vengeful warriors.<br>
<br>
On December 30 some of them ambushed the 7th Cavalry at Drexel Mission and exacted a slight measure of revenge before black cavalrymen of the 9th came to the rescue. But the fugitives hesitant and undecided.<br>
<br>
Expertly Miles exploited the confusion and divisions among the Sioux leaders.  He sent in conciliatory messages urging surrender
and promising decent treatment.  At the same time he drew his circle of troops-by now a formidable concentration of thirty-five hundred men-closer and closer around the big village.  Slowly they moved toward Pine Ridge as the chefs debated and quarreled over whether to trust the general and do his bidding.  Thus combining force and diplomacy in just the right proportions, Miles turned the deadly incident of December 29 into a complete surrender on January 15, 1891.<br>
<br>
On January 21, 1891, a grand review rang down the curtain on the Ghost Dance campaign-and on the Indian wars of the West.  With Sioux stolidly watching from the hills, and with a winter gale whipping the brightly colored capes of the soldiers, regiment after regiment passed before an animated General Miles.  Sabers flashed, rifles were presented, guidons snapped in the wind, a band played Custer's old battle air "Garry Owen" as the decimated 7th Cavalry trooped by, and the deadly Hotchkiss guns, their carriages riddled by Sioux bullets, brought up the rear.<br>
<br>
"It was the grandest demonstration by the army ever seen in the West," wrote a correspondent; "and when the soldiers had gone to their tents, the sullen and suspicious Brilles were still standing like statues on the crest of the hills."<br>
<br>
Yet it was not the formal parade at Wounded Knee that symbolized the disappearance of the Indian frontier so much as a poignant scene that had been enacted at Fort Yates, near Standing Rock Agency, on December 17, 1890, two weeks before Wounded Knee.  While in the agency cemetery an infantry company fired three volleys over the graves of slain Indian policemen and a bugler sounded taps, at the Fort Yates cemetery a detail of prisoners unceremoniously 
shoveled dirt into an open grave.  In <B>it </B>was a rough wooden box containing the canvas-wrapped remains of Sitting Bull.<br>

A Cannibal Story<br>
<br>
James Wallas, "A cannibal story," <B>Kwakitul Legends.</B> Blaine: Hancock House, 1981, p. 190-193.<br>
<br>
A long, long time ago two boys went out hunting deer with their bows and arrows.  They went a long way back in the mountains-so far that they were beginning to think they were lost.  When they saw a little house with smoke coming from it, they went to the door.<br>
"We were wondering where the best place is to hunt deer," they asked the man that came to the door, "and which is the best way to get back to where we came from.<br>
<br>
The man seemed to be very pleased to see them and invited them in the house.  "There are a few deer around here," he said.  "I can show you the best route to take to your village, but first sit down, and we will cook something for you to eat."<br>
<br>
The  boys  were  hungry,  so  they   sat   down,<br>
their backs leaning against a board that was propped up on a post.  Behind them was a pit where the family made their fires.<br>
<br>
The man was building a fire there and putting rocks on it.  "When these rocks are red hot, we will cook the food," he said to the boys.<br>
<br>
His wife noticed blood on the leg of the younger boy.  It was from a scratch he had got going through the brush.  She handed him a stick and asked, "Would you scrape that blood off your leg? Our son would like to have it."<br>
<br>
So he scraped the blood off his leg and handed the stick back.  The little boy licked the blood off the stick with relish, then started chewing the wood.<br>
<br>
The visitors looked at each other.  The older whispered to the younger, "It looks like it is us that they intend to cook!"<br>
Their host looked up from the fire.  "It won't be too long," he smiled.  "The rocks are getting hot now."<br>
<br>
"Why don't you people sit down here where we are?" suggested one of the boys, getting up.  "We'd like to get to know you better."<br>
"Yes," agreed the other boy, rising.  "You tell us about this place-how long you've lived here-and we will tell you about the place we come from.)'<br>

The cannibal and his wife had not talked to anyone for a long time, 
so they eagerly came around and sat down on the seat.  When they were comfortable, their backs leaning against the propped-up board, they started talking.  The brothers squatted, facing the cannibals, and joined in the conversation.  They could see when the wood of the fire had burned low and the rocks were red hot.<br>
<br>
Then one of the boys stood up and yawned and stretched.  Suddenly he kicked the post out from behind the board against which the cannibals were leaning.  The man and his wife tumbled over backwards into the pit and the boys quickly covered them up with the dirt that had been removed to make the pit.  Only the little cannibal was left crouching in a corner.<br>
<br>
Just then there was a knock on the door.  It was the boys' father, who had been searching for them.<br>
<br>
"What are you doing way back here?" their father demanded.<br>
<br>
"We were hunting and wandered farther than we intended," answered the older boy.<br>
<br>
"I don't like this place," said the father.  "I have heard that there are cannibals somewhere in these mountains."<br>
"There are two of them right in there," cried the boys, pointing to the cooking pit.  "They are under the earth."<br>
<br>
The father turned toward the door, "It is better if you come home now," he said.  "You come home now," he repeated.<br>
<br>
"Wait, Father," said the older boy.  "They should be cooled off now." He started digging where the fire had been.  When he reached the remains of the cannibals all that was left of them was very fine ash that flew up in the air.  It flew all over the room and out the open door.  Anywhere it settled it tried to take blood-and that is how the mosquito came into being.<br>
<br>
When the father and his two sons had left that place and were on the trail home, the father said, "Sons, I have never seen a cannibal.  You haVe seen a family of them.  When we reach the village you must describe what you have seen, and we will make a mask."<br>

<B>II.  </B>THE CANNIBAL WOMAN.<br>
<br>
(Skagit : told by Josephine Leclair.)<br>
<br>
There were two orphans, a boy and a girl.  They lived with their grandfather whose name was Carrot (calgaq).  This old man had four dogs who were wolves.  The boy was older than his sister and getting sensible.<br>
<br>
One day he told his grandfather that he wanted to go home and visit his uncle and aunt who lived in another part of the country.  The two children got ready to go.  Their grandfather told them that they were going to a strange and unknown land.  There were two roads.<br>
<br>
He said, " First you will follow a single road, then you will reach a place where this road forks.  The road to the left is wide and good, but do not take that one.  Take the one to the right, it is very narrow and can hardly be seen; that is the road you must take, it leads to your uncle.  " Before they left, their grandfather told them to take some of his water along.<br>
<br>
Then the cMIdren started out and travelled a long way until they finally came to the place where the roads forked.  There they sat down and rested.  The boy had forgotten what his grandfather had told him and he said, " We will take the wide road.  " The little girl said, " No, grandfather told us to take the narrow road.  "<br>
<br>
They talked about the matter, but finally the girl yielded to her brother because he was older.  They travelled along the wide road for a long distance and came to a river.  There was a big house on the other side of the stream and a great big woman came out.  The boy called to her and asked for a canoe to take them across.  The little girl began to cry and said, " Now we don't know what will become of us.  Grandfather told us to take the narrow road.  "<br>
<br>
The woman came over and put the children in a canoe.  It was towards evening.  She took them across the river and put them in her house.<br>
<br>
There were five women of enormous size in the house.  They were called swayo'k!u.  These women used to eat persons alive.  That evening the oldest woman said, " We will keep the children until to-morrow.  Then they were going to have a big feast.  The little girl began to cry.  The children were put in a basket and hung up.<br>
<br>
The women danced all night.  The boy knew that they would sleep
very heavily towards morning after such vigorous dancing.  He bad a small knife Nvith him.  When the women were sleeping he told his sister not to cry.  " We will try to get out in some way.  " He cut the bottom out of the basket and said,<br>
<br>
Now be careful.  " He put the girl down through the bottom of the basket and then he followed.  They walked over the women without waking them.  The youngest woman was the smartest.  Her name was Young-Woman (Ixo'mx).  She always slept by the door.  The children<br>
passed over her and got into the canoe and  crossed  the  river.<br>
<br>
They  went back along the same road by which they had come.<br>
When the women woke up it was very late.  They made a fire and then one of them said, " Take the children down for our breakfast.  " The basket was very light.  They looked into it and saw that it was empty.  The women said, " The children cannot be very far away; let us follow them.<br>
<br>
" They were great runners, especially the youngest one.  They chased the children and finally caught sight of them.  The little girl looked around and saw the women.  She began to cry.  The boy remembered the water his grandfather had given them.  I-le poured a few drops of this water in four different places and the drops became four big trees.<br>
<br>
The children climbed up one of these trees.  When the women came they saw the children up the tree.  How would they get them ? They decided to gnaw around the foot of the tree and fell it.  They started to gnaw and after a wlile the tree began to fall. just before it fell the boy took his sister over to another tree.  The women went to look at the fallen tree anci saw that they were fooled.<br>
<br>
Then they began to gnaw at the second tree and when it fell the children were sitting on the third one.  The women gnawed on the third tree and when it fell the children were on the fourth tree.  The little girl began to cry and said, " What shall we do when the fourth tree falls ? " The women started gnawing at the fourth tree.<br>
<br>
The boy had one drop of water left.  As the tree began to fall he poured the water on it and it became whole again.  The women promptly started again gnawing around the butt end.  At this moment the boy remembered that his grandfather always told him that when he was in danger he should call for him.  The children's grandfather was a great man and could hear over a great distance.<br>
<br>
The boy thought, " I will call and my grandfather will send his dogs.  " The boycalled for his grandfather three times.  Then the women heard a noise like thunder.  They asked one another, " What kind of noise is that ? " One of them said, " That was my long
hair.  " But it really was the noise made by the dogs, as they were coming toward the place where the children were.  When the dogs shook themselves there was a noise like thunder.  The youngest woman said, " I hear the noise coming nearer.  " She was the wisest one among them; but the older woman told her to go on working and not   pay any attention to the noise.  " No, " she said, " I  will go away. She had just left when the dogs  came.  The  other  women  were  still  gnawing.<br>
<br>
The dogs bit and killed them all except the youngest one; she got away safely.  The children came down from the tree and went back to their grandfather with the dogs.  The grandfather was glad to see that they were safe.<br>
<br>
Fox (smyau) who lived near by heard of the witches and kn<br>
the youngest one was still alive.  He came to the place where the children had been.  He went into the house of the witches.  There were many little children in the house and they came and picked at Fox and bit him.  The woman was not there.  The children bothered Fox so that he left the house.  But his spirit told him to go back into the house even if the children did bother him.<br>
<br>
You will see many hearts hanging on the wall.  They are the hearts of the children and of the youngest woman.  Take a stick and hit every heart.  Then all these people will die.  " The woman was out gathering fern roots.  Fox went into the house and struck all the hearts with a stick and every time he struck a heart, one of the children died.  Every time a child died the woman would know that something had happened'at home because her digging stick broke.  " Something must be wrong, " she said, " because my stick is breaking aH the time.  "<br>
<br>
She started to go home.  While she was on her way Fox struck her heart and she fell dead.  Fox came out of the house and began to sing, " Their uncle killed them all, hal'ya.  " He walked on towards a mountain singing this.<br>
<br>
He had heard of some wonderful birds a long way off.  He thought that this might be the place where those birds lived.  He came near a house, so he stopped singing.  He went into the house and saw many birds sitting around the fire.  He said, " I shall kill all of you.  " He made a hole where the ashes were, took all the little birds and put them into the hole and covered them up with the hot ashes.  He came out of the house and began to sing the same song.  He walked higher and higher up the mountain, singing the same song.<br>
<br>
Finally he came to the very sununit.  Then the mother birds heard him and knew it was Fox.  They flew over him and this killed Fox and he rolled down the mountain.<br>
<br>

Fox had a brother who was a very much better man than he.  His name was dokibel.  He discovered that Fox was dead and travelled to the place where his body lay.  Only the fur was left.  Da'k,,ibEl said, " Fox does not know what is good for him.  " Then he placed the bones in the position in which they had been when Fox was alive.<br>
<br>
He walked over the body three times and then Fox woke up and became alive.  Fox fixed his fur and shook himself and said, " I must have been asleep a long. time.  " Dokuibel said, " No, you were dead.  Don't bother those birds anv more, they are wonderful birds and they can kill you.  " Dukuibel left Fox.<br>
<br>
Fox went out on new adventures.  He met a tiny boy who was dragging a large bow and large arrows behind him.  Fow said, " Why havevou that bow and those arrows ? Don't you know that they belong to your father ? " Fox scolded in this way as if he had sense himself.  The boy said, " I have no father, the bow and arrows are niine.  " Fox answered, " If they are yours, then shoot me.  " Fox did not believe that they belonged to the boy.  The boy said, " You are too near.  "<br>
<br>
Then Fox went off at some distance aDd called, " Shoot me now.  " The boy said, " No, you are too close.  " Then Fox went  on  a  great  distance  and  called  again,<br>
<br>
Shoot me now.  " Again the boy replied, " No, you are too close.  Fox was angry then and said, " I'm not going to call for you again.  He walked on for many days and never thought any more of the boy.  Then one day he was struck by an arrow in the back of his head.  This was the boy's arrow, The boy was Woodpecker (tSEsa'q!')-<br>
Fox was dead three days when Dukuibel came along.  He found the arrow and recognized it as Woodpecker's.<br>
<br>
Then Dukuibel placed Fox's bones in order as he had done before and passed over the body.  Fox woke up and said, " I have been asleep a long time.  " dokibel said, " No, you have been dead.  You must not meddle with Woodpecker again.  He is a great shooter.  " Then Dukuibel left Fox.<br>
<br>
Fox walked on and finally heard a great noise and much shouting.  He came near and found all kinds of birds and animals.  He saw them shoot arrows right up to the sky.  The arrows would come right back to where the people were.  Fox asked them, " What are you doing ? " The people said, " Our land has no fire.  There are people in the sky who have fire and we want to make war on them.  We want to get the best shooter so that we can make a road of arrows up to get fire.<br>
<br>
" Fox tried to shoot but he could not do anything.  The best shooter was the youngest brother of Wolf (so'P.TEnr,). He was the only one who could come near to the sky with his arrows but even he
could not reach it.  Fox said, " There is a boy whose name is Woodpecker.  He is a great shooter.  I guess he will<br>
shoot for you.The people said, " We will pay him the finest plumes<br>
for his arrows.They made this offer to Woodpecker.  He agreed, but<br>
he said he was not     at all sure that he could reach the sky.  He had a grandmother, Snail.  " What do you think, Grandmother, do you think I can shoot that far ? " he asked her.  His grandmother said, " I will go with you.  " She tied a tumpline around her waist.<br>
<br>
They travelled a long distance to the place where the people were.  The people made room for the boy and bis grandmother.  The boy shot up to the sky and the old woman looked up and started to sing and dance.  She sang, " I see the arrow of my grandson, I see it yet, I see it yet.  " Finally she said, " Now I see it stop.  " She saw it stop in the sky.  Every time the boy shot she would sing and dance.<br>
<br>
She sang, " Now I see the arrow of my grandson, I see it yet, now I see it stick to another arrow.  " As the boy shot, the arrows stuck end on end and formed a chain.  He shot four times and the people themselves could see the last arrow.  The boy said to the people, " Now you can shoot for yourselves.  " Then the best shooter shot arrows until the last one touched the ground.<br>
<br>
When this was done, the old woman, Snail, went up the chain of arrows and fastened them together.  When she had reached the top she came down again.  She told the people when she got to the ground that they must be careful in going up, otherwise the chain would break.  Then all the people climbed up to the sky.  Towards the end two sisters began to climb up.  They were Black Bear (tc2'tkuEn) and Grizzly Bear (sta'mtami).<br>
<br>
Black Bear went ahead.  This looked so funny to Grizzly Bear that she said, " Oh, sister, how funny you look, " and thev started to laugh.  Then Black Bear said, " Then you go first.  " They went down and this time Grizzly Bear started up the chain.  Black Bear had to laugh and she said, " You look just as funny as I do.  " They laughed and Grizzly Bear wanted to have her sister start again.  By trying to change the chain broke and the sisters were left down below.<br>
<br>
When the people reached the sky they talked with one another, " Who will go to these people and steal the fire without fighting ? Who can lie just like a dead person and not laugh when he is tickled ? That is the person who will have to get the fire for us.  " So they started to tickle everybody but they all laughed and could not lie still like a dead person.<br>
<br>
Finally they came to an old man named Beaver (statx4).  They put him down and tickled him but he would not move and did not even smile.  The people said, " Here is the man who will get fire for
us.  " They put him in the water and he floated to a fence which was a fish trap.  One of the sky people who owned the fire came to the trap and found Beaver.  He said to himself, " That is a wonderful animal.  There are no beavers around this part of the country.<br>
<br>
" He told his people that there was a beaver in their fish trap.  A chief said, " This may be just a trick.  Haul him out and see if he is dead.  " They pulled him out and began to tickle him all over.  " Surely he must be dead, " they said.  They took him to the house and laid him near the fire.<br>
<br>
Now one of the people who had come from the earth said, " Now the sky people will cut up Beaver. @ch one of the birds will fl y to the<br>
house where Beaver is and distract the attention of the sky people ? Thunder Bird (slEhe'm) said he would go.  He flew there and just as the sky people were about to cut up Beaver he alighted on the house opposite the one where Beaver was.  The sky people saw the bird and said, " Oh, there is a wonderful bird over there, come and see<br>
<br>
" They all ran out to see it.  Immediately Beaver snatched up the fire and ran away.  The people who had come from earth had chosen the fastest runner to meet Beaver and take the fire from him and run back to earth with it. TMs person was the youngest brother of Wolf.  Young Wolf took the fire and ran to his people.  The people did not know how to get back to earth.  They said, " Our grandfather lives near by.  We will see if he can take us back to earth.  We will pay him grass for netting (q!a'g-ai).  " They went to him.  He was called Spider (sopsa'pEn).  They asked whether he could help them get back to earth.  He took their pay and let them down on his rope.  And the people got back to earth with the fire.<br>
<br>
When they reached the earth they heard of a man whose name was Dukuibel.  They heard that he was going about making aH things dif-
ferent.  Dukuibel had a long rod which he carried with him and every nine he touched the earth with this rod he would make a hill.<br>
<br>
When Dukuibel came to the  people  who  had  been  in  the  sky  he  turned  them into animals and birds.<br>
<br>
But the fire was there.  When the people got back to earth the fire began to burn and the world was all ablaze.  dokibel was frightened by the fire.  He started to run and came to a trail.  The fire burned alon behind him and he knew he could not save himself.  So he lay right down in the trail.  The fire swept over him and burned his back.  When he got up he went down to the river.  He saw a little fire across the river.  He stepped right over the stream and there he found his brother Fox again.  Fox was cooking some fish and D6'kuibEt thought he would play a trick on him.  He put Fox to
sleep and took all of Fox's fish away and then he turned Fox into the animal that he is to-day.  He was no longer a human being.<br>
<br>
When Fox woke up he said, " I am still hungry.  I must have been eating fish, for my hands and face are all greasy, but still I am hungry.  He went to the river to drink.  There he saw his reflection in the water.  He said, " Somebody must be in the water.<br>
<br>
" Then he became frightened.  He looked in the water three times and each time he became more frightened.  He went and asked his spirit " who the person in the water really was.  The spirit answered, " Why don't you know that that is yourself ? Don't be afraid of yourself.  You have been changed into an animal.  " Fox went over to the water again and drank; he was no longer afraid of himself.<br>
<br>
Then Dukuibel continued his journey.<br>

LOON AND THE CANNIBAL WOMAN.<br>
<br>
(Snohomish.)<br>
<br>
Hans Haeberlin, "Mythology of Puget Sound," <B>Journal of American Folklore.</B> XXXVII (1924).<br>
<br>
Loon  was  a  young  Snohomish  man.  The  Sxwayok!-   woman   who  was   a cannibal wanted to capture  him.  She  had  a  powerful  love-magic  and  she went down to where the young man lived and by means of this magic made him come out of the house.  Her magic made Loon fall passionately in love with her.  " There never was such a beautiful woman before, " he thought.<br>
<br>
He went up and tried to embrace her.  As he did this she seized him and put him into her basket, and ran off with him.  She ran up the river and he saw that he had been deceived and began to cry.  The woman took him home.  She lived with her grandfather, Black Bear.  She roasted some camas and fed them to the stolen man.<br>
<br>
In the morning Sxwayok!" went out to bathe.  She told her
grandfather to look after the man.  But when she had gone Black Bear told Loon to beware of Sxwayoklu who was a bad woman.  He pulled out the man's finger nails and gave him his bear claws instead.  He also gave him him strong teeth and his tough hide to wear under his buckskin.  When Sxwayoklu came home, she was anxious to sleep with her husband.<br>
<br>
When she embraced him she found that he was very strong and she became alarmed.  As she embraced him they bit one another.  In the morning she roasted some more carnes.  Loon pretended to eat very much in order to make Sxwayok!u think he was a very strong man.  In reality he stuffed the camas into a concealed bag which Black Bear had given him to tie around his waist.  Sxwayoklu said, " You are the first whom I have seen eat so much.  " Loon however replied, " I am still hungry.  " Then he went out of the house and dumped the food out of the bag and buried it.<br>
<br>
Sxwayoklu again went away and Black Bear told Loon to be careful, because Sxwayoklu was going to roast him and eat him.  He told Loon to run off towards the west.  " There you will come to Thunder and Flint; they are cousins of your father.  Give them my finger nails and they win return your own to you.  " Loon did as he was told.  He ran towards the west and came to a prairie where he met Mole and her daughter digging cainas.  The girl noticed Loon first and told her mother.  Mole bade her daughter take the man to Thunder and Flint.  The girl packed Loon on her back and ran to Thunder and Flint.<br>
<br>
While Sxwayoklu was digging for roots her digging stick broke.  This told her that there was something wrong at her house.  She ran home.  Black Bear had twelve hollow cedar trees for his houses.  He Md himseff in the last one.  When Sxwayok!u came home she looked for her grandfather.  She went to the first tree and asked, " Grandfather, are you at home ? " - " Yes, " answered the tree, for Bear had told the trees to answer that way so that Sxwayok!u would be delayed in chasing Loon.<br>
<br>
Sxwayoklu broke open the tree and did not find her grandfather in it.  She then went to the second tree and there got the same answer.  She tore the tree open but again found it empty.  In this way she tore open four trees.  Then she ran back to the house.  There she saw the tracks of Loon.  She followed his trail until she reached the prairie where mole lived.  " Have you seen my husband, Loon ? " she inquired.<br>
<br>
" Yes, " said Mole and sent her to Thunder.  Sxwayok!u ran on and came to Thunder and asked him, " Have you seen my husband ?     No,  "  said  Thunder, " probably he is at Flint's house.  "  Thunder  himself      was  not  powerful, he could only make a noise, so he sent Sxwayok!u to his more powerful brother Flint.  "<br>
<br>
Is my husband here ? " she asked again.  " Yey, he is here, "
answered Flint, " come right in.  " But the door of Flint opened and closed and Sxwayoklu was afraid to go in.  Flint told her not to be afraid if she wanted to see her husband.  Finally Sxwayoklu became enraged and rushed into the house, but just as she was halfway through the door, it closed and cut her to pieces.  They buried her in the ground.  Thunder was delighted and produced thunder and lightning.  Flint gave Loon his own finger nails back and took the bear claws from him.<br>
<br>
The father of Loon went out to find his son.  Finally he caine to the house of Thunder.  He was told that his son was there and had married the daughter of Mole.  Loon and the Mole girl returned to his home and they had a little boy.<br>

VANCOUVER'S CANNIBALISM STORY.<br>
<br>
George Vancouver, "Lunch with the Natives," <B>Vancouver's Discovery of Puget Sound.</B> Portland: Binfords and Mort, Publishers, 1942. p. 140-41.<br>
<br>
About a dozen of these friendly people [ at Brown's Point] had attended at our dinner, one part of which was a venison pasty.  Two of them, expressing a desire to pass the line of separation drawn between us, were permitted to do so.  They sat down by us, and ate of the bread and fish that we gave them without the least hesitation; but on being offered some of the venison, though they saw us eat it with great relish, they could not be induced to taste it.<br>
<br>
They received it from us with great disgust, and presented it round to the rest of the party, by whom it underwent a very strict examination.  Their conduct on this occasion left no doubt in our minds that they believed it to be human flesh, an impression which it was highly expedient should be done away.  To satisfy them that it was the flesh of the deer, we pointed to the skins of the animal they had about them.<br>
<br>
In reply to this they pointed to each other, and made signs that could not be misunderstood, that it was the flesh of human beings, and threw it down in the dirt, with gestures of great aversion and displeasure.  At length we happily convinced them of their mistake by showing them a haunch we had in the boat, by which means they were undeceived, and some of them ate of a remainder of the pie with a good appetite.<br>
<br>
This behavior, whilst in some measure tending to substantiate their knowledge or suspicions that such barbarities have existence, led
us to conclude, that the character given of the natives of North-West America does not attach to every tribe.<br>
<br>
These people have been represented not only as accustomed inhumanly to devour the flesh of their conquered enemies; but also to keep certain servants, or rather slaves, of their own nation, for the sole purpose of making the principal part of the banquet, to satisfy the unnatural savage gluttony of the chiefs of this country, on their visits to each other.<br>
<br>
Were such barbarities practiced once a month, as is stated, it would be natural to suppose these people, so inured, would not have shown the least aversion to eating flesh of any description; on the contrary, it is not possible to conceive a greater degree of abhorrence than was manifested by these good people, until their minds were made perfectly easy that it was not human flesh we offered them to eat.<br>
<br>
This instance must necessarily exonerate at least this particular tr The from so barbarous a practice ; and, as their affinity to the inhabitants of Nootka, and of the sea-coast, to the south of that place, in their manners and customs, admits of little difference, 
b<B>ut </B>is but charitable to hope those also, on a more minute inquiry, may be found not altogether deserving such a character.<br>
<br>
They are not, however, free from the general failing attendant on a savage life.  One of them having taken a knife and fork to imitate our manner of eating, found means to secrete them under his garment; but, on his being detected, gave up his plunder with the utmost good humor and unconcern.<br>

OGRESS<br>
<br>
Vi Hilbert, "Basket Ogress," <B>Haboo, Native American Stories from Puget Sound.</B> Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1985 p. 42-
44.<br>
<br>
A group of children knew a woman who lived all alone near the river.  The children knew that she was lonely, and they wanted to go visit with her.  When they asked their parents for permission to go, their parents said, "No.  You can't go, because it is too far away: the Giant Woman might get you when you are away from home.  The Giant woman is powerful.  She would put you in her huge clam basket."<br>
<br>
The children ignored their parents.  They got into a canoe and went on their way to visit the lonely woman.  When night came, they made themselves a camp on the other side of the river.  They built a fire and cooked their supper.  One of the children was a liunchback.  When the children divided their supper, Hunchback was given the tail part.<br>
<br>
They traveled for several days.  Each evening they would stop to camp overnight and eat their supper.  Every time, they would give Hunchback the tail part for his share.<br>
<br>
Hunchback finally said, "If you folks are always going to be giving me the tail part when I woulet really rather have the tips, I will call the Giant Woman!"<br>
<br>
When night came again and they stopped to camp and eat their supper, it was still the tail part which he was given.  Now Hunchback hollered! He hollered:<br>
<br>
Come downhill, Giant Woman, Come downhill, Giant Woman. It is just the tail part that I am given by my playmates.<br>
<br>
The Giant woman heard right away.  "Oh, there is someone hollering  at  me!  She put her basket on her back and she walked.  She was a huge  person, this Giant Woman.  She chewed on everything as she traveled.<br>
<br>
She arrived where the children were.  Right away she began to pick up the children one by one and put them into her basket.  She grabbed Hunchback first and put him there.  When all of the childran were in the basket, the Giant Woman walked. she carried these children upland. suddenly she could feel something catch at her basket.  She thought, "oh, it must be Hunchback who has caught onto something."<br>

Hunchback had squirmed and squirmed until he managed to get himself up on top of the other children.  Each time he came to a leaning tree he tried to grab ahold of it.  No I He couldn I t do it. on the fourth try, he did it.<br>
<br>
Giant Woman went on walking.  When she arrived at her home with the children she immediately gathered rocks and placed them on her fire to heat.  When they were good and hot she began to take the children out of her basket.  Then she found that Hunchback was missing.  "Oh, Hunchback isn't herel Where is he? Maybe he managed to run away."<br>
<br>
Giant Woman ran!<br>
<br>
Hunchback was in the canoe, shoving off from shore.  He had a paddle with holes in it.  This paddle had holes.  When Giant Woman threw rocks at him, he held up his paddle and the rocks just went through.  Hunchback paddled hard.  Each time she threw a rock at him, he raised his paddle and the rock just went through a hole.<br>
<br>
Giant Woman gave up. she went home and put more rocks on her fire.  She wanted the rocks to be very hot to cook her supper fast.<br>
The children huddled together and began talking to each other.  They watched the Giant Woman heating all of those rocks on the fire.<br>
<br>
Giant Woman noticed and said to them, "What are you children saying?"<br>
<br>
The children carefully answred, "oh, it is just that we are so happy for you that you are heating rocks.  We would like for you to sing and dance before you cook us there."<br>
<br>
Giant Woman was so flattered at the request that she said, "All right!"<br>
<br>
The children said, "You will dance!"<br>
<br>
She proudly said, "Yes, I will." Now Giant Woman danced.  She sang this as she danced:<br>
<br>
The children will be roasted on the rocks.<br>
The children will be roasted on the rocks.<br>
The children will be roasted on the rocks.<br>
The children will be roasted on the rocks.<br>
<br>
The children said, "Oh my, but your song is so nice.  Sing more. " And again Giant Woman sang and danced.<br>
The oldest and strongest of the children were making plans: "We had<br>
better push her onto the hot rocks."<br>

Giant Woman asked, "What. are you children saying?"<br>
<br>
They cautiously answered,, "Oh, we are just so happy for you."<br>
<br>
They whispered to each other, "When she comes near us, let's all push her."<br>
<br>
Ohl Giant Woman was coming closer, singing:<br>
<br>
The  children  will     be roasted  on  the  rocks<br>
The  children  will     be roasted  on  the  rocks<br>
The  children  will     be roasted  on  the  rocks<br>
The  children  will     be roasted  on  the  rocks<br>
<br>
As she came close to them, all of the oldest, strongest children pushed her.  Right onto the hot rocks she fell. She screamed, "Remove me, children. Remove me from the fire and I will return you to your home. "<br>
<br>
One of the children said, "Get a forked stick, and we shall remove your grandmother from the fire.  We shall remove her.  Get a forked stick."<br>
<br>
However, the children took the forked stick, and everyone pressed her down onto the hot rocks until she was just stuck there, roasting.<br>
<br>
That is the end of the story.<br>

THE BASKET ORGESSES CHASE COYOTE<br>
<br>
Told in English by Charley Anderson at Everson, Washington, in 1954<br>
<br>
Vi Hilbert, "The Basket Orgesses chase coyote," <B>Haboo, Native American Stories from Puget Sound.</B> Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1985, p. 8-9.<br>
<br>
This Coyote was traveling, and he saw some children play:Lng. coyote asked them, "Wose children are you? What are your mother's and father's names?" The<br>
children couldn't understand him.  They couldn't speak.  Their mouths  just  went mmmmmmmmm, mmmmmmmmm, mmmmmmmm.He couldn't understand these  children, so he killed them and he went on away.  Yeah.<br>
<br>
?@adus.  There were two sisters; they followed the tracks that were coyote's.  Pretty soon Coyote saw the ?@adus coming.  He ran.  Then
he came to a place.  It was a rock by the beach, and there was a hole in it, way, way inside.  The hole wasn't big enough for a big person to go in, but it was big enough for Coyote to crawl through. well, he stayed there.<br>
<br>
He would peek out, and there were those two ?@adus right there, sitting on each side of the entry.  He stayed inside.  Well, he didn't know what to do now.  He was hungry, and there was no water to drink.  He was getting so bony.  Just skin and bone now.<br>
<br>
Well, he thought to himself, "I'll make believe that there are lots of people who live here.  I'm going to holler to my neighbors across the river." He hollered to his neighbors, "oh, you, my friends, tomorrow we move down the river." After that he hollered and pretended that his friends were answring him from across the river.  He kind of said, low, "Oh, all right.  Yes." Yeah.<br>
<br>
Well, those ?@adus gave up waiting for that coyote to come out.  They found out that there <B>are</B> lots of people in there who are going to move down the river tomorrow.  Well, when coyote would move, all of his bones rattled.  It sounded like dry poles (used for shades inside the house), and that's what the ?@adus thought.  But it was Coyote's bones rattling.  Coyote went to the opening and peeked out.  He saw that the ?@adus were gone now.  They had given up. He was in there all by himself.  He went out.<br>
<br>
Oh, when he got out, he wished for a drink of water, He ran down to the water and Put his face down to drink.  He saw something coming from under the water.  It was a real tough-looking <B>animal</B> coming to bite him.  He got scared and stepped back.  He was so thirsty.  After a while he tried again.  He went slow, slow, so he could get a drink of water.<br>
<br>
He put his face close to that water, and he saw the animal coming from under the water, ready to bite him. He ran back again, he was so scared.  Four times he did that; then he thought to himself, "I wonder if it is my shadow that I see under the water?" He went and drank, and he found out.  "It's my shadow that looks so tough--just bones with teeth sticking outill He had gone without food for such a long time.  He drank that water.<br>
<br>
That is the end of the story.<br>

BASKETT ORGESS.<br>

Vi Hilbert, "Basket Orgess," <B>Haboo.</B> p. 17-22.<br>
<br>
In the time of legends, it seems that the children were sent to gather together by the shore of the salt water.<br>
<br>
When they arrived there they were hungry, so they built a fire to roast their salmon.  They roasted their salmon.  When it was cooked, they divided it into little pieces, one for each child.  Little Hunchback was given the tail, He was told, "The tail part will he your share, Little Hunchback."<br>
<br>
Little Hunchback felt so insulted.  He hollered, "Come on, Orgess, come only I have just been given the tail of the roasted salmon.  "<br>
<br>
The frightened children said, "Be quiet, be quiet, Little Hunchback! Be quiet! The Basket Orgess might come here to us!"<br>
<br>
Again they roasted a salmon.  Four times they roasted their salmon, and always it was just the tail that was given to Little Hunchback.  Now he thought: I am gotng to holler."<br>
<br>
"Come on down to the water, Basket Orgess.  These little children just give me the tail."<br>
<br>
"Be quiet, be quiet! Be quiet, Little Hunchback! The Basket orgess might come to us."<br>
<br>
"Let her come."<br>
<br>
"If she comes, you will be the first one that she takes, Little Hunchback."<br>
<br>
"Oh, no.  I will always be on top,"<br>
<br>
Then he hollered again: "Come on, Basket Orgess, come on down towards the water."<br>
<br>
Again  the  frightened  children  pleaded,  "Don't,  don't   call  the   Basket orgess--she might come!"<br>
<br>
Suddenly they heard something making noise.  It was Basket Orgess' cane.  She had deer hooves tied there, and they rattled as she walked.<br>
<br>
"See there! Basket Orgess is coming."<br>
<br>
"No, no! Don't call her! No!"<br>
<br>
They were grabbed.  Put into a big clam basket. It was on the back
of the Basket ogress.  She put in another child.  Little Hunchback squirmed around, always getting himself up to the top as the Orgess threw more children into her basket.  This clam basket of ogress I was made entirely of snakes.  Just snakes.<br>
<br>
There were eleven children, including Little Hunchback.  There were eleven.<br>
<br>
She arrived.<br>
<br>
She sang as she happily built a hot fire and placed rocks there to heat.  When the rocks were hot, the Basket orgess pushed. Then she sang a different song:<br>
<br>
Take me out of the fire,<br>
<br>
Children, please!<br>
<br>
Take me out of the fire,<br>
<br>
Children, please!<br>
<br>
Take me out of the fire,<br>
<br>
Children, please!<br>
<br>
The children answered, "We are taking you out of the fire.  We are taking you out of the fire, but the flames and the rocks are so hot."<br>
<br>
"Put out the fire, children.  Put out the fire."<br>
<br>
"No, no, Basket orgess! We can't get it out.  We have tried in vain to put it out."<br>
<br>
Basket Orgess again sang her request four times:<br>
<br>
Remove me from the fire,<br>
Children, please!<br>
Remove me from the fire,<br>
Children, please!<br>
Remove  me     from the fire,<br>
Children,     please!<br>
Remove  me     from the fire,<br>
Children, please!<br>
<br>
The  happy  children  danced around as she  sang.<br>
<br>
They  sang   in   reply:<br>
<br>

We are removing you, Basket Orgess- but we can't seem to manage to get you out."<br>
<br>
The fire burned until it went out.  They tried in vain to get the Basket orgess out.<br>
<br>
Little Hunchback ran.  He went down to the water.  He got there.  He wanted to be in the bow of the canoe.<br>
<br>
"No, no, Little Hunchback.  No! You get in the middle, get in the stern." But no. They didn't get Little Hunchback on board.  They went where they were going.<br>
<br>
Little Hunchback threw rocks at them.  Held fix them.  Their paddles would break.<br>
<br>
The children arrived where they had come from.<br>
<br>
"What did you children do? What did you do with your younger brother?" They were all women at that place.  There were no men among them.<br>
<br>
"We left Little Hunchback because he wouldn't listen to us when we tried to stop him."<br>
<br>
"Oh, okay.  It was all right that you left him."<br>
<br>
Now his grandfather went out looking for Little Hunchback.  He put his grandson on board and they traveled through the swamp grass and reeds that grew there.  When he arrived home he asked the children,<br>
<br>
"Why did you leave your younger brother?"<br>
<br>
They answered, "Well, it was because he called the Basket orgess and she would have burned us.  That is why we got angry with him and we left him!"<br>
<br>
That is the end of the story.<br>

THE STOLEN CHILDREN<br>
<br>
(Told by Snuqualmi Jim.)<br>
<br>
Hans Haeberlin, "Mythology of Puget Sound," <B>Journal of American Folklore.</B> XXXVII (1924).
A great many people were camping near a river and there were many children with them.  The children went out to play together.  There was a little humpbacked boy among them whose name was Askekuitc.<br>
<br>
This boy would sing, " You watch out, you girls, the big animal will carry you away in his basket.  " The oldest girl said to him, " Don't say that, the wild animal will get you too.  " The nameof this animal was Sxway6'k!and it was a woman with a large basket on her back.  This woman came down and got the little humpbacked boy first of all.  Then she got the other children too.  The basket was full of children and the boy climbed up and held onto the rim of the basket.<br>
<br>
Sxway6'klu took the children to her house in the woods.  On the way she brushed against a branch.  The boy held on to it but the woman shook her basket and he fell back.  This happened five times.  Finally the boy clung to the limb of a tree and the woman did not notice it.  Then when the woman was out of sight he let Mmself down and ran home to tell his people.  He told them that Sxway6'k!" had stolen all the children, " I saved myself by getting hold of the branch of a tree while the woman carried us in her basket.  " The people chased after the woman with spears to kill her.<br>
<br>
The woman carried the children into her house and made a fire.  She made stones hot to cook them.  She began to dance around the hot stones and sang, " The stones are hot; I shall eat the children.  " Sxway6'k!u closed her eyes as she sang and danced.<br>
<br>
The oldest girl said, " How would it be if we pushed her on the hot stones ? " As soon as the woman came dancing around to the place where the oldest girls were, they pushed her over on the hot stones.  She cried, " My children, help me, get me off the stones, I will send you back to your people.  " But the girls did not believe her and they took a forked stick and held the woman down on the stones until she was cooked.<br>
<br>
Then the oldest girl took the children - back home. just as they were halfway home they met the people coming after them with the little humpbacked boy leading the way.  The people were glad to see their children again and they asked how they had escaped.  The girls told how they had killed the woman, but the old people would not believe it, so the children took them to the woman's house and they saw it for themselves.  Then they all went home together.<br>

Told by  Martha LaMont at Tulalip in 1968<br>
Vi Hilbert, "Basket Ogress," <B>Haboo, Native American Stories from Puget Sound.</B> Seattle: University of Washington Press,  1985 p. 108-
110.<br>
<br>
Basket Ogress spoke to her little daughter, Tree Roots.  "Little Roots, I want you to build a fire and h4tat those rocks.  We are going to have tender roasted children for our supper."<br>
<br>
Basket Ogress put her hug a clam basket on her back and hurried down to the water where the little children were playing.  She grabbed them all up and stuffed them into her basket.  Little Hunchback kept wriggling himself up over the children.  He managed to be at the top of the basket as ogress lumbered upland thinking about her supper.<br>
Little Hunchback saw a tree branch that was hanging sideways.<br>
<br>
He grabbed ahold of it and swung himself out of the basket as ogress crawled under with her pack.  Then he ran.  He went home.  When he got there he told how the bad Basket Ogress had stolen the children.  The people immediately prepared themselves to go and rescue them.  They sould kill that ogress.<br>
<br>
When Basket ogress arrived at home with her basket full of children, she took them out and seated them around the fire.  As she thought about her dinner, she began to sing and dance.<br>
<br>
She sang:<br>
<br>
The children will now be roasted,<br>
<br>
The children will now be roasted,<br>
<br>
The children will now be roasted,<br>
<br>
Around the fire she went.  It was a great big fire, and her daughter, little Tree Roots, had lots of  rocks heating there. ogress was very happy. she was glad because now she had lots of tender little children to eati She became alightly dizzy as Ehe danced around the fire, and she staggered just a little. oh, but she was so happy as she thought about the dinner she would have in just a little while. It was such a big, hot fire!<br>
<br>
The older boys and girls noticed how she had staggered as she danced.  They whispered to each other, "She could burn!  We could push the dirty thing, because she gets dizzy when she dances and staggers toward the fire. we could push her down and push her neck onto the fire with a forked stick.<br>

We could all poke her and hold her down on the fire.  We could manage to kill her.  It would would be a good thing if she died, anyway!"<br>
<br>
The children discussed their plan; then one of them ran and brought back a forked stick.  They said to little Tree Roots, "Little Tree Roots, go and get a forked stick so that we call get your mother out of the fire if she should get dizzy and fall there." Little Tree Roots went and returned with the good forked stick that they used when they were out hunting.<br>
<br>
Now they watched carefully as Basket Ogress happily danced around her big hot fire.  As soon as she staggered just a little, they pushed her toward the fire and poked her neck onto the hot rocks with the forked sticks.  She thrashed around for a little while.<br>
<br>
Then she died in the fire! They kept her pressed onto the fire.  Basket ogress, the monster who liked to eat children, diedi She would have eaten them if she had not been killed herself.<br>
<br>
It was little Hunchback who ran and told.  Then the people came.  They made certain that she was truly dead.  There was still a little life left in her when the relatives of the children arrived, so they completely killed her.  She died!<br>
<br>
After Basket Ogress was dead they covered her over with ashes and left her there.  Her little daughter, Tree Roots, left. she walked at first, but then she went running away from the place where her mother had died.<br>
<br>
The younger sister of Basket ogress, had been hunting far away from home.  Now she quietly returned.  As she glanced around the area, she noticed that a big fire had died down, but there appeared to be something there covered with ashes.<br>
<br>
Then she chuckled to herself and said, "Well, well as usual, the great, powerful one has her game cleverly hidden.  This is probably her game that she has roasted and hidden here." She went closer to investigate what was covered at the fire. she knew it had been roasted.  She uncovered part of it.  True!  It was cooked and falling apart, it was so well done! This younger sister had been out hunting and hadn't had time to stop and cook herself a good meal. She was so hungry.<br>
<br>
Now she ate. She thought that this was some game that her sister had cooked and left covered at the fire.<br>
<br>
After she had eaten her fill she began to feel a little sick, and she said, "Oh, my goodness, this tastes like it might have been the dear one I -- She realized now that it was her own sister whom she had eaten.  She got scared and went away from there.<br>
<br>
She walked a long way until she came to some people in a village.
she asked them, "Where is your door?.<br>
<br>
They answered, "It is through the roof that people enter who come here." They already knew, however, that Basket Ogress, sister would be traveling, and they had built a huge fire beneath the roof.  When she came through the hole in the roof, they threw her into the fire, where she died.<br>
<br>
Now both monsters were dead, and that is why there are no monsters here on top, the way the world is now.  They would still be here if they hadn't been killed in the fire, the bad Basket ogress and her younger sister.<br>
<br>
The younger sister was also bad.  This story is about the way it was in the beginning.  Those monsters liked to eat children.  They killed them.  They didn't eat old people, just the children.<br>
<br>
The daughter of Basket Ogress, little Tree Roots, lived.  Coming generations will now be all right, because the monsters were killed.<br>
<br>
That is the end.<br>

CENTRALIA MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
----------<br>
<br>
Those who were killed were Ben Casagranda, Wesley Everest, Warren O. Grimm, John Haney, Dale Hubbard and Arthur McElfresh.<br>
<br>
---------<br>
<br>
The defendants in the case were Eugene Barnett, Ray Becker, Bert Bland, O. C. Bland, Bert Faulkner, John Lamb, James McInerney, Thomas Morgan, Loren Roberts, Mike Sheehan, Britt Smith and Elmer Smith [the attorney.].<br>

Donald A. Macphee, "The Centralia Incident and the pamphleteers," <B> Pacific Northwest Quarterly,</B> LXII (July, 1971), p.110-116.<br>
<br>
Nineteen was a year of violence and unrest in many sectors of American society. A series of bloody race riots, several bitter labor clashes and a rising incidence of vigilante justice give this year a special significance in relation to the period of which it was a part. It was no accident that John Dos Passos chose 1919 as the title of the middle volume of his trilogy on American Society in crisis.<br>
<br>
One example of such violence was the encounter between members of the Industrial Workers of the World and the American Legion on the streets of Centralia, Washington, on November 11, 1919. The Centralia affair provides a useful illustration of the way in which local and regional conflicts often become entangled with and indeed contribute to tensions that shape opinions and attitudes on the wider national level.<br>
<br>
This episode can be studied with profit not only as a final violent chapter in the history of the IWW in the Pacific Northwest, but also as an example, along with the Sacco-Vanzetti case and the Wall Street bombing of the so-called Red Scare of the post  World War One years.<br>
<br>
The local and regional setting of the Centralia dispute gave it
much of its distinctive neofrontier flavor; but the rhetoric and passion, especially of the legionnaires and their supporters, were drawn from the nation wide crusade against radicalism. World War One, with its toll of American dead and unresolved problems had left a residue of brittle patriotism and disillusionment and incidents like the one in Centralia served to accelerate the tendency toward polarization of American opinion.<br>
<br>
This converging of local and national issues may be illustrated by the very stereotypes of the protagonists. The Wobbly represented at once the discontented logger of the Northwest woods and the draft dodging seditious Bolshevik. The parading legionnaire, on the other hand, fit easily the image of acquisitive and repressive lumber baron, one hundred per cent American, and triumphant veteran.<br>
<br>
The Centralia case, then, may provide fertile ground for the kind of microanalysis suggested and employed elsewhere.<br>
<br>
If, as David M. Potter has said, " a microcosm is just as cosmic as a macrocosm." this incident presents us with the raw materials for a kind of case study in the struggles of the radical wing of the labor movement, the operation of small town mob rule, and the recurrence of the Red scare phenomenon in American society. Whether "cosmic" or not, this most interesting and lively writing allows critical evaluation of conflicting and highly partisan testimony based on widely divergent interests and view. But whatever the conceptual framework, it must account for this dualism of provincial and national concerns.<br>
<br>
The purpose of the present paper is not to attempt such an analysis or to render another verdict in the case, it is, rather, to comment very selectively on some of the significant materials which resulted from the incident. No attempt is made here to comment on the official sources, such as the voluminous court proceedings, available to the historian of the Centralia case.<br>
<br>
The writer intentionally has focused, instead, on some of those accounts which were designed to influence public opinion concerning the case.<br>
<br>
In the years immediately following 1919, secondary accounts of the Centralia controversy were almost entirely those of directly interested parties and they took the form of apologia for the principals in the case. because of their clearly intended purpose of self justification and persuasion, they are biased, emotional and often contradictory. This polemic purpose of most of the early accounts of the Centralia case contributed to a continued polarization of opinion regarding its meaning for American society.<br>
<br>
As Robert Tyler has said: "For many years historians and publicists viewed the bloody...riot...as the evidence of frightening tendencies in American Society, either as the aggression of a fanatical Bolshevik cadre or the attempted bullying of a bona fide Fascist squadron (Robert Tyler,"Violence at Centralia, 1919,"
<B>Pacific Northwest Quarterly,</B> XLV (1954) p. 116.).<br>
<br>
It would be a mistake, however, to dismiss these important sources too quickly because of their admitted point of view and purpose. It is this very quality which gives them their special appeal. Taken together, these writings provide a valuable opportunity to study the anatomy of conflict, explicit, urgent, distorted, and yet full of meaning for the student of this troubled period.<br>
<br>
The two most interesting and possibly also most significant documents resulting from the Centralia episode are the quasi official, authorized description of the event produced by the American Legion and by the Industrial Workers of the World (Ben Hur Lampman, <B>Centralia:Tragedy and Trial.</B> Tacoma, 1920 and Ralph Chaplin <B>The Centralia Conspiracy: The Truth about the Armistice Day Tragedy,</B> Chicago, 1924.).<br>
<br>
Ben Hur Lampman, special correspondent for the <B>Portland Oregonian</B> at the trial in Montesano, Washington, was retained by the Tacoma and the Centralia American Legion posts to write an account of the "red assassination." Lampman was best known for his homespun, sentimental poems and essays which appeared occasionally in the <B>New York Times</B>, <B>Saturday Evening Post</B>, and <B>Sunset Magazine,</B> as well as the pages of the Portland daily.<br>
<br>
Three books of his collected pieces have since appeared and all are quite devoid of any material of social or political significance. They are concerned only with the wonders of nature and earned for Lampman the designation by his editor as "the American Izaak Walton." It is hard to imagine a more unlikely candidate for the task of chronicling the Centralia disaster.<br>
<br>
The eighty page pamphlet produced by Lampman was dedicated to the memory of the four legionnaires "...stricken down unawares by the cowardly hand of anarchy." In a foreword by the national commander of the Legion in an introduction by George Leonard Wood, and throughout the entire account, radicalism, anarchy, lawlessness, and communism are juxtaposed with law and order, one hundred per cent Americanism, patriotism, and American First.<br>
<br>
From the sinister sketch on the front cover depicting a gun wielding, desperate looking figure poised in a hotel window, to the Legion's Americanism program printed in the final pages, the Lampman pamphlets presents its case without equivocation; the IWW was guilty of unprovoked and premeditated murder; they were spokesmen for an alien doctrine threatening the very fabric of American society; and they should have been hanged rather than jailed or freed.<br>
<br>
Ralph Chaplin, whose booklet has provided a basic source for most of the liberal commentators on the Centralia affair, wrote his account while hiding out in a Seattle skid road hotel. Chaplin was a descendant of 17th century Puritans; his father voted Republican and despised Eugene V. Debs. Despite this background, Chaplin had
been converted to socialism, and radical unionism while he was still a sensitive adolescent.<br>
<br>
In his autobiography <B>Wobbly, the rough and tumble story of an American Radical.</B> published in 1948, Chaplin described the effects on his family of the social and economic crises of the 1880s and 1890s and their struggle for a livelihood in Illinois, Kansas, and Iowa. He characterized himself in the years that followed as a "rebel editor, writer of battle songs, and agitator, and as a friend and fellow worker, for half a century...of the old time migratory revolutionaries.<br>
<br>
As an old man, mellowed by the passing years and a changed labor scene, Chaplain could still recall the difficulties of his task in 1919, " I tried to be fair in my reporting of the Centralia trial. But having been so close to the picture of IWW persecution, I found it almost impossible to be objective."<br>
<br>
The Chaplin booklet began with the assumption that there was a conspiracy of the lumber interests to rid the Northwest of brave men of the woods, who were striving for economic justice through the advanced working class movement.  The Centralia loggers, according to Chaplin and the IWW were guilty, not of murder but only of defending themselves, and their union hall against a well organized attack by the legionnaires, who were doing the bidding of the lumber barons.<br>
<br>
"There is no question that the whole affair was the outcome of a struggle, a class struggle, if you please, between the union loggers and the lumber interests; the former seeking to organize the workers in the woods and the latter fighting this movement with all the means at its disposal."<br>
<br>
Time will not permit a complete analysis of the positions taken by the loggers and the legionnaires in their literature. However, in attempting to capture something of the color and controversy which was generated by the case, it may be helpful to sample the contrasting descriptions of various facets of the episode.<br>
<br>
Aside from the fundamental difference over the motivation and responsibility for the shooting. Lampman and Chaplin, speaking respectively for the Legion and for the IWW reaching predictably contrasting conclusions regarding a variety of other significant parts of the story. Their treatment of the background and setting of the case, the parade and shooting, the lynching, and the trial, will illustrate the nature and qualities of the arguments presented.<br>
<br>
Ralph Chaplin, in the IWW account of the case devoted nearly half of his booklet to putting the fateful day and its aftermath in context. He described such background factors as the plight of organized labor in the lumber industry of the Pacific Northwest, the evils of wage slavery, the Everett massacre of 1916, the Seattle General Strike of 1917, and the development of a conspiracy
against the IWW in Centralia.<br>
<br>
Chaplin's description of the town itself will illustrate his style and the mood he attempted to convey:<br>
<br>
"Centralia in appearance is a creditable small American city, the kind of city smug people show their friends with p ride from the rose scented tranquility of a super six in passage...Centralia is somewhat of a coquette but she is as sinister and cowardly as she is pretty.<br>
<br>
"There is a shudder lurking in eery corner and a nameless fear sucks the sweetness out of the breeze...<br>
<br>
"A red faced business man motors leisurely down the west street. He shouts a laughing greeting to a well dressed group at the curb who respond in kind. But the roughly dressed lumber workers drop their glances in passing one another...<br>
<br>
"Around Centralia are wooded hills; men have been beaten beneath these trees and lynched from them...The vistas through the trees seem enchanted rather than real, unbelievably green and of form and depth that remind one of painted settings for a Maeterlinck fable rather than matter-of-fact timber land." (Chaplin, p. 31-32).<br>
<br>
Chaplin concluded his detailed description of the developing conspiracy with a flourish:<br>
<br>
"The Commercial Club was seething with intrigue like the court of old France under Catherine de Medici; only this time it was industrial unionists instead of Huguenots who were being marked for a new night of St. Bartholomew. The heresy to be uprooted was industrial instead of religious protestantism; but the stake and the gibbet were awaiting the New Idea just as they had the old." (Chaplin, p. 51).<br>
<br>
An Armistice Day parade, arranged by a joint committee of the American Legion and the Chamber of Commerce and routed directly by the union hall confirmed labor's fears.<br>
<br>
The American Legion account gave little space to the setting and background of the case. Lampman described his pamphlet as a "...comprehensive review of the trial at Montesano, Washington." Accordingly he used the framework of the trial proceedings to present and interpret the Legion's case, with only a few pages of introduction.<br>
<br>
The Centralia "assassinations" were put in the context of Communist inspired radicalism and were coupled with the Seattle general strike as manifestations of a "...propaganda of falsehood and renewed intrigue--piling lie upon lie until Munchausen himself has been brought to envy and Judas and Arnold outshone as traitors." (Lampman.<B>Centralia</B> p. 12.).<br>

In describing the parade and its tragic conclusion, Chaplin followed the contention of the IWW defense that the legionnaires, in collusion with local business men, had planned the route and arrangement of the parade so that on its return to the city park, the Centralia contingent would be at the rear, in a position to duplicate the "scorpion sting" of the 1918 parade. (Chaplin p. 66).<br>
<br>
Chaplin, depending on testimony and other accounts friendly to the loggers reconstructed the crucial moments:<br>
<br>
"The Chehalis division had marched past the hall and the Centralia division was just in front of it when a sharp command was given. the latter stopped squarely in front of the hall but the former continued to mar. Lieutenant Cormier of the secret committee was riding between the two contingents on a bay horse.<br>
<br>
"Suddenly he placed his fingers to his mouth and gave a shrill whistle. Immediately there was a hoarse cry of 'Let's go-o-o! At 'em boys!....<br>
<br>
"At the words "let's go..." the paraders from both ends and the middle of the Centralia contingent broke ranks and started on the run for the union headquarters. A crowd of soldiers surged against the door. There was a crashing of glass and a splintering of wood as the door gave way. a few of the marauders had actually forced their way into the hall.<br>
<br>
"Then there was a shot, three more shots...and a small volley. From Seminary hill also rifles began to crack." ( Chaplin, p. 67).<br>
<br>
Lampman'description of the shooting wrapped the prosecution's contention of unprovoked murder in the garb of postwar patriotism:<br>
<br>
"...while members of the American Legion laughed and jested, in parade line, the zestful autumn air suddenly was rife with whistling lead. Back from France and Siberia they were, those boys, with the fancy in their hears that peril was past....<br>
<br>
"The shots that broke the parade formation, that plunged spitefully through the throngs of women and children on the gala streets came from the haggard windows of the IWW hall, on Centralia's main thoroughfare, Tower Avenue, from the blistered old rooming houses that flanked the avenue, and from the distant vantage point of Seminary Hill. As each hidden rifle cracked it spoke the welcome of radicalism to men who had returned from peril overseas." (Lampman, p. 14).<br>
<br>
Lampman added a rather oblique defense of what was to follow that night:<br>
<br>
"...but Centralia, above the bodies of her sons, vowed vengeance. Are  you among the critical? Had you been in Centralia that day yours would have been the first among the voices lifted for retributive justice." (Lampman p. 14).
Despite the dramatic quality of the terror on Tower Avenue and the uncertainty and ambiguity which surrounded it, the climax of the violent incident was yet to take place, the lynching of Wesley Everest late that same evening.  Everest, an IWW member had fled from the hall and was captured on the banks of the Skookumchuck River.  Before he was forcibly overcome, he had fatally wounded Dale Hubbard, nephew of F.B. Hubbard, a prominent lumberman and leader of the Citizens Protective League.<br>
<br>
Understandably, the American Legion account did not dwell on the details of the Everest lynching. Lampman's brief reference can be quoted in full:<br>
<br>
"Everest died that night. From among his fellow prisoners in the Centralia jail, when the lights of the city were turned out, unknown avengers took him forth to the outskirts of the town, and hanged him from the river bridge, sending a rifle bullet through his dangling body.<br>
<br>
"The lynching of Everest was an unlawful error. Not only did it afford additional propaganda for the radicals, but and in this was the greater harm, it removed from trial one of the ring leaders of the Centralia reds, against whom evidence was damningly complete and conclusive.<br>
<br>
"In cartoon the lynched "wobbly" has bee depicted as an ex-service man executed by his buddies. He worm the uniform by compulsion, after nimble draft dodging, as the records attest, and died the violent death of one who preached and advocated violence. (Lampman, 14-15).<br>
<br>
Far from dismissing the lynching as an "...unlawful error..." Chaplin's account was painfully complete and prepared the way for preserving the name of Wesley Everest as a durable martyr in the cause of radical labor. Chaplin pointedly described Everest as "American, old Washington pioneer stock." In contrast to the persistent anti-alien theme of the Lampman treatment and the Legion's Americanist campaign, Chaplin also pointed  out that Everest had seen service overseas, and he included a picture of the logger that showed him in his uniform with a caption characterizing him as earnest, sincere, and quiet. (Chaplin p. 60).<br>
<br>
The point of view and polemic intent of Chaplin's account are apparent throughout. Constructing his story from the trial defense and from statements by sympathetic union members and towns people, Chaplin told of the pursuit and capture of Everest, his near lynching at the scene of his capture, and the nightmare that followed during the late evening hours.<br>
<br>
While the city was momentarily plunged into darkness, Everest was taken from jail and spirited away by men in three luxurious automobiles. The assailants were always referred to as "business men."  The guard at the jail offered up his charge without resistance. the defense assertion that the mayor of Centralia and
the City electricians were responsible for turning off the city lights was repeated uncritically.<br>
<br>
Chaplin was the first to mention Everest's emasculation on the way to his lynching. Many of the later sympathetic writers also reported the incident, even though the Federal Council of Churches study in 1930 concluded that it could not be substantiated.<br>
<br>
The brutal lynching itself is best described in Chaplin's own words:<br>
<br>
"Wesley Everest was dragged out of the middle machine. A rope was attached to a girder with the other end tied in a noose around his neck. His almost lifeless body was hauled to the side of the bridge. THe headlights of two of the machines threw a white light over the horrible scene.<br>
<br>
"Just as the lynchers let go of their victim the fingers of the half dead logger clung convulsively to the planking of the bridge. A businessman stamped on them with a curse until the grip was broken. There was a swishing sound; then a sudden crunching jerk and the rope tied to the girder began to writhe and twist like a live thing. This lasted but a short time." (Chaplin p. 77-78).<br>
<br>
There was never an official inquest into Everest's death. An often repeated account was that of Coroner David Livingstone with which he regaled the "...gentlemen of the Elks Club..."<br>
<br>
"Wesley Everest had broken out of jail, gone to the Chehalis  River bridge and jumped off with a rope around his neck.  Finding the rope too short he climbed back and fastened on a longer one; jumped off again, broke his neck and then shot himself full of holes."<br>
<br>
Chaplin reported that "...businessmen still chuckle over the joke in Centralia..." (Chaplin p. 79).<br>
<br>
Only brief reference can be made to the treatment by Lampman and  Chaplin of the trial at which the eleven surviving IWW members faced charges of murder. Both writers were in attendance at the trail, Lampman as a special correspondent for the <B>Portland Oregonian</B> and Chaplin with credentials from the labor press.<br>
<br>
The descriptions of leading personalities involved in the trial suggest the writers' treatment of more substantive issues. To Judge John M. Wilson, Lampman applies such qualities as "...remarkable forbearance and leniency," "firmness" and "exact justice."<br>
<br>
To Chaplin, however, the trial judge appeared as a "bird of prey" in his black robe, "perched above the courtroom," ruling "always adversely to the cause of labor."<br>
<br>
 Prosecutors Herman Allen, W.H. Abel and C. D. Cunningham, were "suave," "dignified" "resourceful" men, "...excelling in argument..." and masters of the law, when described by Lampman, but
as sounding the "gamut of rottenness" and as hirelings of the "...lumber interests..." when referred to by Chaplin. On the other hand Lampman described George F. Vanderveer, attorney for the accused Wobblies, as the high priest of the IWW who had been retained  by the national organization at a fee of fifty thousand dollars; he was "cynical, persuasive, tense, with a smile that turned at times to comradeship and again to a fighting sneer."<br>
<br>
But to Chaplin, Vandeveer was "...a man of wide experience and deep social vision" who singlehandedly "opposed six high priced lumber trust prosecutors. (Chaplin p. 91 and 125).<br>
<br>
Chaplin, especially, took full advantage of the dramatic element sin the courtroom scene. He commented on the logger in "stag shirt and overalls," and the women "neat and smug in appearance, busy with bits of sewing or crocheting." He described the pathetic picture of the young children in the court room; Warren Grimm's baby daughter "...who had to be restrained from playing with the tots across the way whose fathers were accused of having killed her papa," and Eugene Barnett's baby son who was "...sitting beside his mother...and casting childish looks of unspeakable affection at his boyish father on the prisoner's bench. (Chaplain p. 131).<br>
<br>
Years later, writing his autobiography, Chaplin remembered another reaction to the trial:<br>
<br>
"Through the courtroom windows I watched the pointed tops of ragged fir trees in the rain, and I felt like crying out against the hatred and misunderstanding that pitted the fine young Americans, one against the other like wild beasts.<br>
<br>
"I was convinced of the justice of the IWW case, but the constant repetition of violence, bloodshed, and imprisonment was beginning to make me wonder. I had reached the stage where I was groping for a more rational type of labor relations. (Chaplin, Wobby, p300-
301).<br>
<br>
It seems likely as is often the case with such recollections many years after the fact, that these comments represent Chaplin's views reconstructed in 1948, rather than a modification of the position he held nearly thirty years before.<br>
<br>
Characteristically, the two booklets ended with divergent appeals. Chaplin called for the release of the men still buried alive in prison, and asked his readers: "What are you going to do?" Lampman raised a different question in his closing appeal against radicalism: "Have you a Wobblie in your town?  While calling for restraint of sentiment against the convicted as individuals, he asserted that the slavering beast known as the IWW should be shown no such mercy.<br>
<br>
"When Americans hear the plaza orator pour out his vitriol, as he does, the smile of tolerance should fade and never reappear. For the scored and ensanguined seeds he sows are the same dragon's
teeth from which Centralia reaped her harvest of most lamentable death." (Lampman, p. 73).<br>
<br>
During the 1920s and early 1930s the Centralia case frequently found its way into print as liberals took up the cause of the prisoners and pressed for their release. The pages of <B>New Republic, Christian Century,</B> and <B>Current History,</B> among others, joined the official publications of the IWW General Defense Committee in appealing to the governor of Washington for commutation of the sentences.<br>
<br>
Dozens of affidavits were gathered from jurors, marchers, and towns people supporting IWW claims. Eugene Barnett, one of the convicted loggers, wrote a moving piece pleading his innocence but defending the role of radical labor. Upton Sinclair submitted correspondence to the <B>New Republic</B> to demonstrate that the governor was not considering the merits of the case, but merely disliked the political views of those who were making the appeals.<br>
<br>
The American Legion even produced its own gadfly in the somewhat quixotic person of Captain Edward Patrick Coll. A western Washington insurance man, legionnaire, and distant cousin of Eamon de Valera, Coll began to raise questions during the 1920s about the role of the Legion in the Centralia case.<br>
<br>
His investigations produced thirty affidavits supporting the prisoners, leading him to believe that the marchers had been at fault. When his attempts to secure an official legion investigation failed, he sparked a careful study by cooperating Protestant, Catholic and Jewish social action groups.<br>
<br>
Their report, although highly critical of the Centralia business community and the conduct of the trial, was not received with much enthusiasm by the IWW. It was considered too moderate and as representing only a comfortable middle class liberalism attempted to salve its conscience. <B>Industrial Solidarity</B> dismissed the report as "merely evident of where church people and their ilk inevitably lined up in the class struggle.<br>
<br>
Historiographically, however, the Federal Council of Churches study does represent the first relatively systematic and unbiased attempt o arrive at an accurate assessment of the case. Later scholarly studies have in the main supported the conclusions of the report. In focusing on what it called the "passion of the community" which made sane moral judgments impossible, it went to the heart of the matter: "Both sides used social dynamite and neither seems to have realized the magnitude of its offense."<br>
<br>
Publication of this moderate report, however, hardly ended the partisan appeals, In 1931 Louis Adamic wrote his angry study called <B>Dynamite: The Story of Class Violence in America,</B> and the next year John Dos Passos' <B>1919</B> included an essay on the Centralis martyr. Both books, reflecting the dismal milieu of the early 1930s gave new life and relevance to the struggle a decade earlier between
logger and lumberman in the Northwest woods.<br>
<br>
Although Wesley Everest became Paul Bunyan in the Dos Passos piece, the content and point of view were the same as those in the flaming pamphlet that Chaplin had written in the Seattle hotel. Indeed, Chaplin seems almost to have anticipated Dos Passos' Bunyan analogy in his comparison of the martyrdom of the Centralia lumberjack with that of the Nazareth carpenter: "A rebel unto Caesar, then as now, Alone, thorn crowned, a spear wound in his side."<br>
<br>
Despite the emotional content of these publications and their appeal to the Left, it was probably the degree of respectability and legitimacy given to the release appeals by the Federal council of Churches study, as well as a substantial change in public opinion in the Northwest that led to the release of all but two of the convicted men by the early 1930s.<br>
<br>
James McInerney was still imprisoned when he died on August 13, 1930. Only Ray Becker remained in prison during most of the decade; he was not released until September, 1939.  (Albert F. Gunns, "Ray Becker, the Last Centralia Prisoner," <B>Pacific Northwest Quarterly,</B> LIX(1968), p. 88-99.).<br>
<br>
With the raison detre of the crusade removed the Centralia case lost its appeal to the publicists, and the arena shifted to the more objective  but less pungent style of the scholarly journal, to an illustrative role vis a vis the Red scare, in under graduate textbooks, and most recently to be come part of Melvin Dubofsky's major study of the IWW.<br>
<br>
The alarums and violence abroad in America during these troubled years have produced some valuable monographs. Perhaps the foregoing will suggest to the historian and to the social scientist the potentialities of the Centralia incident for further study.<br>
<br>
A convergence of highly charged local and national issues, involving elements of intergroup conflict, class consciousness, and community pressure gives Centralia in 1919 much of the same appeal which has continued to attract scholars to such incidents as the Sacco-Vanzetti and Haymarket cases.<br>
<br>
More than a generation ago, Captain Coll predicted that Centralia's memorial statue to its slain legionaries would someday assume the likeness of Wesley Everest. The statue in the city part remains unchanged today, but through the efforts of pamphleteer and scholar, the story of logger as well as legionnaire has been recorded for all to read.<br>

Walter Evensk "The Centralia Massacre," <B>The Seattle Post Intelligencer,</B> October 26, 1975.<br>
<br>
Centralia, November 13, 1919-<br>
<br>
The State of Washington was in a state of near-hysteria today, two days after the shooting of four American Legionnaires by members of the Industrial Workers of the World and the lynching of an IWW man here.<br>
<br>
Although Governor Louis Hart, who returned to Olympia from Spokane following the Armistice Day Massacre, has not called martial law, he did call for an all-out legal war on "treasonable and criminal elements."<br>
<br>
All across the state, bodies are being formed - primarily among American Legion posts - to assist police in "eradicating the IWW and other Bolshevists organizations."  The police, state and local authorities are participating wholeheartedly in the campaign.<br>
<br>
And if Gov. Hart has not declared martial law, there is something very like it here in Centralia, where groups of ex-servicemen patrol the streets and armed guards are at every bridge and entrance to town.  If civil law has not been suspended, it has certainly taken a leave of absence.  This city's police affairs are under direction of a special committee of the American Legion.<br>
<br>
Already controversy is swirling around the few minutes just before 3 p.m. day-before-yesterday when gunfire marked a tragic end to Centralia's Armistice Day Parade.<br>
<br>
The Legion and the country authorities contend there was a plot by the IWW to "get the men prominent in anti-Red activities" here.  The IWW maintains it was simply defending its hall against an attack by the ex-servicemen.<br>
<br>
Certainly there has been a great deal of agitation for removal of the Wobblies from Centralia.  And in April of last year, during a Red Cross parade, a group of Centralians smashed the IWW hall and beat up several members.<br>
<br>
There were rumors again earlier this week that the Armistice Day parade would give a repeat performance.  The owner of the Roderick Hotel, in which the IWW hall is located, asked Police Chief  A. C. Hughes if the police would protect the property. The police chief replied:<br>
     
"We'll do the best we can for you, but as far as the Wobblies are concerned they wouldn't last 15 minutes if the businessmen don't want any Wobblies in this town."<br>
<br>
The IWW published a pamphlet November 4 to the citizens of Centralia, which read, in part, "To the citizens of Centralia, and to the working class in general: We beg of you to read and carefully consider the following:<br>
<br>
"The profiteering class of Centralia has of late been waving the flag of our country in an endeavor to incite the lawless element of our city to raid our hall and club us out of town.  For this purpose they have inspired editorials in the Hub, falsely and viciously attacking the IWW, hoping to gain public approval for such revolting criminality.<br>
<br>
"These profiteers are holding numerous secret meetings to that end and covertly inviting returned servicemen to do their bidding.  In this work they are ably assisted by the bankrupt lumber barons of Southwest Washington who led the mob that looted and burned the IWW hall a year ago."<br>
<br>
The pamphlet outlined the false charges of subversion the IWW said was laid against it and told of the sufferings of its members for "no crime save that of loyalty to the working class" and ended with:<br>
<br>
"Many IWW in and around Centralia went to France and fought and bled for the democracy they never secured.  They came home to be threatened with mob violence by the law and order outfit that pilfered every nickel possible from their mothers and fathers while they were fighting in the trenches in the thickest of the fray.<br>
<br>
"Our only crime is solidarity, loyalty to the working class and justice to the oppressed."<br>
<br>
The IWW asked attorney Elmer Smith if they could defend their hall from invasion and Smith informed them they could.  The IWW, however, went a step further and instead of arming men in their hall alone, set up a field of fire around it.<br>
<br>
Wesley Everest, who was lynched by the mob following the shooting; Britt Smith, the IWW secretary; Ray Becker; Bert Faulkner; Mike Sheehan and James McInerney were in the IWW hall on Tower Avenue.  O. C. Bland and John Lamb were in the Arnold Rooming House across the street; Loren Roberts, Bert Bland and Ole Hanson were a quarter-mile away on Seminary Hill, a ridge east of Tower Avenue.  Supposedly a man named Davis and Eugene Barnett were in the Avalon Hotel also across Tower Avenue from the IWW hall.
The men were armed with a variety of weapons ranging from a Colt .45 to a high-powered Savage rifle.<br>
<br>
They were in place Tuesday when the parade came marching up Tower Avenge from the city park, led by the Centralia veterans, then the Chehalis Legionnaires (there were 520 veterans in uniform in the parade), Boy Scouts, women who had taken an active part in war work and the Elks Club and its band.<br>
<br>
The parade proceeded north on Tower Avenue to Third Street, past the IWW hall located between Second and Third Streets.  At Third Street it reversed the order and marched south on Tower.<br>
<br>
Everybody, including one platoon of Centralia veterans, had passed the IWW hall when the group of Centralia veterans started marking time to close up ranks.<br>
<br>
Exactly what happened then may never be known exactly.  Either the veterans started charging the IWW hall and were met with a volley of gunfire or there was a volley of gunfire and the veterans then charged the hall.<br>
<br>
Evidence given in a coroner's jury earlier today tend to support the former version, although the Legionnaires are now denying that they had any intentions of doing the IWW harm.<br>
<br>
Dr. Frank Bickford, a Legionnaire who was in the line of march, said at the inquest that the door of the IWW hall was forced open by the ex-servicemen before the shooting started.<br>
<br>
Dr. Bickford said while the men were marking time in front of the IWW hall, someone suggested it be raided. "I spoke up and said I would lead if enough would follow," Dr. Bickford told the coroner's jury, "but before I could take the lead there were too many ahead of me.  Someone next to me put his foot against the door and forced it open after which a shower of bullets poured through the opening about us."<br>
<br>
Another witness, Dr. Herbert Beli, said the men broke ranks and charged the hall simultaneously with the outbreak of shots.<br>
<br>
Arthur McElfresh, 26, manager of a pharmacy here, was the first to fall in front of the IWW hall.  Dr. Bickford crawled to him and loosened his collar, then attempted to get him to a hospital.  He died before the hospital was reached.<br>
     
Ben Casagranda, 25, a bootblack and a veteran of the fighting in France, doubled over, clutching his stomach.  He was fatally injured.<br>
<br>
Warren O. Grimm, 30, Centralia attorney and former University of Washington football star, was struck by a bullet.  He reeled and William Scales, who was standing beside him asked if he was badly hit.<br>
<br>
"I don't think so," Grimm, who had been commander of the Grant Hodge Post of the American Legion here for just one week, said and started toward an auto.  The wound, however, proved fatal.<br>
<br>
Four persons were wounded in that brief, but bloody, battle at 2:55 p.m.  Emery Coleman, Eugene Pfitzer and H. W. Eubanks suffered minor wounds and John Earl Watt was seriously injured.  His condition was reported better today.<br>
<br>
All of the people injured by gunfire were in the line of march, which lends further credence to the Wobbly claim that they fired only into those charging the hall.  No spectators were injured, although two women reported that ricocheting slugs passed through their skirts.<br>
<br>
All of the Wobblies except the man named Davis and Ole Hanson were captured after the incident and there have been rumors that perhaps one of them fell victim to the lynch mob, also.  It is possible, however, that they made their way clear of the area in the first few minutes of confusion.<br>
<br>
Although most of the men in the IWW hall surrendered without a fight after the first scuffle, Wesley Everest, and Army veteran and IWW organizer, attempted to escape through a back door.  He led a group of pursuers on a chase of 1 1/2 miles through the streets of the city, firing as he ran and reloading when his gun was out of ammunition.<br>
<br>
He was stopped by the Skookumchuck River.  He attempted to wade it, then apparently changed his mind - or, perhaps he could not swim and the river was high - and came back to the bank:<br>
<br>
"Come on and take me, you ..." he said.<br>
<br>
Hubbard, who was in front of the pursuers came on and was within 10 feet of Everest when two bullets dropped him.  Everest emptied his gum into Hubbard then was overwhelmed by the group chasing him.  The mob beat him severely before dragging him back to jail.<br>
<br>
Near the jail someone threw a rope around everest's neck.  The IWW organizer defied them to hang him.<br>
<br>
"What's your name?" someone in the crowd asked.<br>
<br>
Another man in custody, being taken into jail, shouted, "Tell 'em
it's none of their damned business, Red."<br>
<br>
Everest answered "Brick Smith," and a murmur went through the crowd that Britt Smith, the IWW secretary had been caught.  A rope was thrown over the cross-support of a telephone pole and Everest said:<br>
<br>
"Hang me - go ahead and hang me."  There are reports he also told the mob they didn't "have the guts " to hang him in the daytime.<br>
<br>
He was taken to the jail and thrown into a corridor, where he lay, bleeding and moaning.<br>
<br>
The mob continued to grow around the jail when, at 7 p.m., the lights of the city went out.  It was no accident.  The only engineer on duty on duty at the city's light plant was due several blocks away at 7 p.m. to throw a switch that furnishes several sections of the city.  While he was gone, someone pulled out a connection switch that feeds electricity to the entire city.<br>
<br>
By the time the engineer stumbled back to the plant in the dark, found the trouble and connected the circuits, the purpose of the blackout had been served.<br>
<br>
After the lights went out, two cars swung onto Tower Avenue with headlights blazing.  The crowd shouted for the drivers to extinguish the lights, but before the they could comply, they were smashed out by the mob.<br>
<br>
While that was going of a third auto came from the opposite direction and parked in front of the jail.  Several men got out and entered the jail.  They smashed through a wooden door to the jail office, opened the door of steel bars and took Everest from the corridor where he lay.<br>
<br>
Jailer Robert Jackson said he was in the rear of the jail with a special deputy when the mob broke in and the "corridor filled with men."  He said the barred door between the office and the corridor had been left unlocked.<br>
<br>
Everest was taken to a bridge over the Chehalis River - on the ride there he was castrated by one of the lynch mob - a rope was placed around his neck and he was dropped over the edge of the bridge.  While he was hanging there his body was riddled with bullets.<br>
<br>
Sometime early yesterday morning it was cut down and floated in the river for several hours before being recovered at 2 p.m.  It was taken to the jail after both undertakers in town refused to handle it.<br>
<br>
Finally, today, four of the IWWs among the 42 under arrest here, guarded by armed soldiers, took the body to the local cemetery and buried it in an unmarked grave.<br>
<br>
Until today it was thought that the lynched man was Britt Smith.
While Everest was being lynched the men still held in jail were going through a night of terror.<br>
<br>
"I have heard tales of cruelty," James McInerney said, "but I believe what we boys went through can never be equalled.  I thought it was my last night on earth and had reconciled myself to an early death of some kind, perhaps hanging.<br>
<br>
"I was taken out by the mob once and a rope was placed around my neck and thrown over a cross-bar or something.  I waited for them to pull the rope, but they didn't.  I heard voices say, 'That's not him,' and they put me back in jail."<br>
<br>
Britt Smith said, "Every time I heard a footstep or the clanking of keys, I thought the mob was coming after more of us.  I didn't sleep - couldn't sleep.  All I could do was strain my ears for the mob I felt sure was coming."<br>
<br>
Ray Becker, said, simply: "It was one hell of a night."<br>
<br>
The light of day yesterday didn't slacken the tensions, but there has been no more violence in the city.  Instead, a hatred for the IWW seems to be spreading throughout the state, a hatred that could spell the death knell of the organization as a force in the timber industry here.<br>
<br>
Certainly there will be a series of official moves to eradicate the IWW.  Although Gov. Hart would not call a special session of the Legislature, saying there were laws already to "wipe out sedition and prevent seditious organizations," he urged state officials to "renew our allegiance to the Constitution and the law and go forward with a determination speedily and lawfully to rid this state of these enemies of society and of constitutional government."<br>
<br>
United States Attorney Robert Saunders was even more outspoken.  He told police organizations in the state to "arrest every IWW whether he has a card or is known to be affiliated with that organization."  Saunders said he would charge them with attempting to overthrow the government.<br>
<br>
The Seattle police began a "campaign of extermination" after hearing of the Centralia massacre.  Chief Joel Warren appointed a special detail under Sgt. P. F. Keefe to conduct operations against four meeting places and arrested 38 persons suspected of being IWW members.<br>
<br>
Chief Warren said the leaders of the Seattle IWW might have known of the Centralia "plot," but that the rank and the file were ignorant of any such knowledge.<br>
<br>
The Spokane post of the American Legion demanded that city and county authorities take immediate steps to deport all IWWs and
offered the services of its 2,700 members as deputies.<br>
<br>
E. A. Klebba, state adjutant of the American Legion, said 11,000 ex-servicemen of Washington "stand ready to assemble under arms and fight to the last ditch to wipe out at once and for all, Bolshevism in this state."<br>
<br>
Captain J. R. Dean of the Elmer Noble Post No. 1, in Seattle, said the rank and file of the Legion could be held in check and that they would act only with the consent and cooperation of organized authority.  But he warned that "no one could predict the immediate future if efforts of peaceful authorities to round up agitators failed to accomplish the annihilation of the organization."<br>
<br>
The Seattle post also sent a resolution to the national convention of the Legion, now meeting in Minneapolis, blaming the Centralia tragedy on the "failure of the federal government to prosecute or deport men preaching sedition."<br>
<br>
That the Centralia massacre had an impact on that national convention is shown in the statement made today by Milton J. Foreman, the Illinois state commander.  He said his state would organize an "Americanization  Committee" of vigilantes to detect radicalism of all types.<br>
<br>
"We are determined that there shall be no repetition of the Centralia tragedy in our state," he said.<br>
<br>
Such a committee is patrolling Centralia today and it has been heavy-handed at times.<br>
<br>
At the Wilkins Pool Room on Tower Avenue a patron uttered some uncomplimentary remarks regarding the manner in which radicals have been handled here.  Someone told a citizens' group about his statement.  Five minutes later a squad of Legionnaires appeared, ordered the 100 men present to raise their hands and subjected them to search.  They arrested 16 men with IWW cards.<br>
<br>
Other groups of ex-soldiers meet every train and if they have any suspicions about passengers, they are searched and jailed for investigation.  Those who pass the investigation are allowed to go about their business.  Others are placed on outgoing trains under armed guard and told to stay out of town.<br>
<br>
Centralians have taken the law into their own hands with radicals before.  They took a blind newsman, Tom Lassiter, from his newsstand (which they burned) and dumped him outside of town with a warning not to come back.  That happened last June 30, and when Lassiter later returned to the city he was indicted for criminal syndicalism for selling radical papers.  He still is in jail in Chehalis, the county seat.<br>
<br>
Though all of the cries against the IWW, only one voice has come out in support.  The Seattle Central Labor Council yesterday pass
a resolution placing the blame on the "lawless business element of Centralia."<br>
<br>
The resolution opposed violence but asked that judgement against the IWW be withheld until that organization was given a chance to state its version.<br>
<br>
Regardless of whose version is true, the fact remains that four young men will be buried here Saturday, struck down in the prime of their lives, and another young man - like them a war veteran - lies in an unmarked grave.  And a state seethes.<br>
<br>

<br>
The state brought first-degree murder charges against 12 IWW members.  The trial began in February, 1920, in Montesano, the county seat of Grays Harbor County.  The trial was held in a circus atmosphere, with a Legion encampment on the courthouse grounds.<br>
<br>
Attorney Elmer Smith, Mike Sheehan and Bert Faulkner were acquitted; Tom Morgan turned state's evidence and disappeared after the trail; Loren Roberts was adjudged insane - the IWW claimed from the tortures he was subjected to after his arrest.<br>
<br>
Eugene Barnett, John Lamb, O. C. Bland, Bert Bland, Britt Smith, James McInerney and Ray Becker were found guilty of second degree murder and, despite the jury's recommendation for clemency, were sentenced to 25 to 40 years in the state penitentiary.  The men lynched Wesley Everest were never brought to trial.<br>

THE CENTRALIA MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Vernon H. Jensen, "The Centralia Massacre," <B>Lumber and Labor.</B> New York: Farrar and Rinehart, Inc, 1945 p. 137-147.<br>
<br>
Very damaging to industrial relations in the lumber industry was the tragic Centralia massacre. The causes of this tragedy, the fact that it could occur, and the aftermath constitute a black chapter in the history of the lumber industry.<br>
<br>
It was largely a product of war hysteria but it was also a spectacular climax to a long sequence of events which reach back into the roots of labor relations in the industry.<br>
<br>
As early as the autumn of 1916, in a manner all too typical of many communities in the area, a committee of Centralia townspeople had carried a group of IWW members to the country line, where they were
told never to return.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, the I.W.W. "brazenly" opened a hall in 1917, which was raided by "a group of businessmen" during a Red Cross parade in May, 1918.  The building in which the office was located was practically demolished.<br>
<br>
In June, 1919, a group of businessmen, in broad daylight, raided a newsstand operated by a blind news agent, Tom Lassiter.  His stand and literature were destroyed because it had been his custom while distributing the Seattle Union Record, an A.F. of L. publication, to slip I.W.W. literature between the leaves.<br>
<br>
Lassiter was taken out of town and "warned" against his undesirable activities.  The Seattle Union Record protested vigorously against the treatment of its agent, but no one was ever prosecuted for this illegal behavior.<br>
<br>
In June, 1919, G. F. Russell, secretary of the Washington Employers Association and president of a local lumber company, called a group of businessmen together in the Chamber of Commerce.  At this meet-
ing the Citizens Protective League was formed and F. B. Hubbard, president of the Eastern Railway and Lumber Company, was selected to lead the organization.  Its declared purpose was to deal with the I.W.W.<br>
<br>
In September the I.W.W. had the effrontery to open another hail, which resulted in calling the Citizens Protective League together on the night of October 2o with the newspaper-announced objective of getting rid of the Wobblies.  Plans were discussed at length and the leader of the league was reported to have become "highly incensed when the Centralia Chief of Police informed the gathering that the I.W.W. had a legal right to remain in Centralia."<br>
<br>
The local commander of the American Legion, Wilham Scales, expressed his belief that, while he was opposed to a raid, no jury would convict men who led it.  When a trade union representative refused to serve on a committee to oust the I.W.W., a committee could not be appointed in open session, and "it was agreed to appoint a secret committee." Whether this committee was set up is not known."<br>
<br>
A raid was expected by the I.W.W., and Mrs. J. G. McAllister, who owned the hotel in which the I.W.W. hall was located, appealed to the police for protection of her property-she knew what had happened to the I.W.W. hall in May, 1918.<br>
<br>
In addition, Elmer Smith, the I.W.W. attorney, made a trip to Olympia to seek protection from the governor.  Moreover, about a week after the meeting of the Citizens Protective League, the
I.W.W. distributed leaflets from house to house which declared:<br>
<br>
To the Citizens of Centralia We Must Appeal<br>
<br>
To the law-abiding citizens of Centralia and to the working class in general.<br>
<br>
We beg of you to rcad and carefully consider the following.-<br>
<br>
The profitecring class of Centralia have of late been waving the flag of our country in an endeavor to incite the lawless element of our city to raid our hall and club us out of town.  For this purpose they have inspired editorials in the Hub, falsely and viciously attacking the I.W.W., hoping to gain public approval for such revolting criminality.  These profireers are holding numerous secret meetings to that end, and coverity inciting returned service men to do their bidding.<br>
<br>
On Armistice Day, 1919, a parade was held under the auspices of the American Legion.  The line of march was announced.  Twice it was to pass the I.W.W. hall.  Anticipating a raid and believing they had a right to defend their property, Britt Smith, secretary of the local I.W.W., Wesley Everest, Ray Becker, James Mclnerny, and others were gathered in the hall.  Loren Roberts, Bert Bland, and Ole Hanson were stationed on Seminary Hill to the east.<br>
<br>
0. C. Bland and John Lamb were in the Arnold Hotel and "John Doe" Davis was in the Avalon Hotel on the opposite side of the street.  As the parading Centralia legionnaires reached the hall the second time, they stopped in front of it.<br>
<br>
Shortly after, shooting began-whether before or after the attack on the hall has been in dispute.  Some people testified that the paraders marked time, and others that a rush was made on the hall.  In the affray that followed, three legionnaires were killed, W. 0. Grimm, A. McElfresh, and Casagranda.<br>
<br>
Others were wounded.  Great excitement followed during which the hall and its contents were destroyed, while all the I.W.W. men found were placed under arrest.<br>
<br>
One I.W.W. war-veteran member, Wesley Everest, who had done considerable shooting from the hall, escaped through a rear door of the building only to be pursued by legionnaires.  Brought to bay on the bank of the Skookumchuck River, he shot Dale Hubbard, the leader of his pursuers.  But he was soon overpowered, beaten, and led to jail with a stfap around his neck, barely escaping lynching.<br>
<br>
That night a lynching did occur.  The town lights were turned off while a crowd entered the jail and took a man supposed to be Britt Smith.  Near the outskirts of town the man was brutally maltreated and hanged to a bridge over the Chehalis River.  The next morning
the Centralia papers told of the lynching of Britt Smith.<br>
<br>
And not until Smith was captured during the day was it discovered that Everest had been the victim.  The body hung on the bridge until someone cut the rope the next day, dropping it into the shallow water where it lay for some hours.<br>
<br>
Afterwards it was taken to the jail and placed in sight of the other prisoners.  No undertaker would care for the body, and it was buried at night without services by four jailed I.W.W. members, accompanied by a squad-of armed guardsmen.<br>
<br>
Suspicion and fear contributed to the tenseness which pervaded the atmosphere of Centralia.  Placards were mounted in shop windows:<br>
<br>
Have you any information of the whereabouts of an I.W.W.?<br>
<br>
Any person or persons having information, no matter of how little importance, concerning the whereabouts of a member of the I.W.W. or any information whatever concerning the outrage on Armistice Day will confer a favor on the city officials if they will call at once at the city hall and give whatever data they have to the chief of police.<br>
<br>
All information will be treated strictly confidential.  Office open at 8:30- Come at once.<br>
<br>
The American Legion, which was strongly influenced by the lumber interests of the community, took over the law-enforcing function with the justification that it wished to avoid further lawlessness.<br>
<br>
The Centralia Chronicle asserted that, "to even sympathize with the perpetrators of the tragedy is proof evident that the sympathizer is a traitor to his country." A reflection of the current hysteria lay irt the arrest of the editor, the president, and the secretary of the board 6f directors of the Seattle Union Record, and the closing of the press on the ground that it published an unpatriotic editorial which violated the Espionage Act.  This editorial read:<br>
<br>
DON'T SHOOT IN THE DARK<br>
Violence begets violence<br>
Anarchy calls forth anarchy<br>
<br>
That is the answer to the Centralia outrage.  And the reason for it is found in the constant stream of laudation in the kept press of unamerican, illegal and violent physical attacks upon the person of those who disagree with the powers that be.<br>
<br>
The rioting which culminated in the death of three or four returned ex-service men at Centralia last night was the result of a long series of illegal acts by these men themselves-acts which no paper in the state was American enough to criticize except the Union
Record ....<br>
<br>
Contrast the tone of this statement with the frantic assertions in the extra edition of its bulletin which the 4L published.  Under the heading "Centralia Affair Makes Issue Clear" was given a rabid<br>
account of the tragedy which patriotically lauded the parade and declared:<br>
<br>
It chances that their [the company of legionnaires] temporary halt comes opposite the headquarters which bear the significant letters, I.W.W. lberc is nothing in the moment to, presage an eventuality. . . .<br>
<br>
It was not murder.  It was not an attack on the American government. it was monumentally worse than either of these crimes. . . . It is rebellion.  It is treason. . . . It was an attack upon society.  It holds every man who went at his country's bequest to risk his life, in utter contempt.  It spits in the face of every mother who gave her son that democracy might be safe.  It holds up to derision the American nation and every individual who claims its protection....<br>
<br>
It was not simply an attack on the American government. . . . These were not bodies of troops under arms. . . . Ilese were a company of free men, exercising the right of free assemblage for purposes undeniably worthy and noble.  It was an attack on American sentiment, American honor, American traditions of right and wrong; on American ideals of freedom, democracy and fair dealings.<br>
<br>
In an entirely different tone the lynching was referred to as "the rough and ready justice of the old-time Vigilance Committee.  But it was justice."<br>
<br>
Eleven members of the I.W.W. were charged with murder-those not accused of the actual shooting being indicted on a charge of conspiracy to kill.  The defense sought a change of venue and the trial was moved to Montesano in Grays Harbor County, which, of course, did not satisfy the defense because public feeling ran high there.  A request for a second change of venue was denied in spite of evidence of the widespread distribution of a circular which read in part as follows:<br>
<br>
No outrage since the World War has so thoroughly aroused public indignation as this ruthless slaughter of four heroes . . . struck down by members of a traitorous organization. . . . If at their trial their guilt is proven beyond doubt, and this guilt is practically admitted by the I.W.W. themselves, it is the duty of every juror, as an American citizen to cast his ballot for conviction and maximum punishment and thu' sever a few heads of a many-headed monster that is eating at the heart and vitals of the
nation Centralia's armistice day victims fought to save.  For a juror to not so cast his ballot would be as traitorous an act as the Armistice day massacre itself .<br>
<br>
The denial of a satisfactory change in venue meant that the trial was held in a community charged with the sharpest prejudice.<br>
<br>
The prosecution built its case around the death of W. 0. Grimm, whose body was found in the middle of the street following the melee.  This was unfortunate for the defense because it frustrated its attempt to introduce evidence to prove the existence of a conspiracy to destroy the I.W.W. in order to justify the argument that the defendants were simply protecting themselves and their property.<br>
<br>
Judge J. M. Wilson refused to permit the introduction of such evidence until the defense could prove an overt act on Grimm's part.  G. F. Vanderveer, attorney for the defense, was not able to prove that Grimm had committed an overt act, and this literally hamstrung the defense.  If the defendants had been charged with the murder of A. McElfresh or B. Casagranda, whose bodies were found immediately in front of the I.W.W. han, proof of an overt act might have been easier.<br>
<br>
While the defense could not prove an overt act on Grimm's part, the testimony of Dr. Frank Bickford at the coroner's inquest is inter-
esting.  He said that the raid was suggested when the parade halted and that the door of the I.W.W. hall was ki@ked open before the shooting from inside began.  Conflicting statements on the question of aggression are difficult to reconcile, but the evidence points to the likelihood that a rush toward the hall preceded the shooting.<br>
<br>
Vanderveer argued that evidence of a conspiracy against the I.W.W. should be accepted by the court to prove apprehension, 'to show why the I.W.W. had armed themselves, to refute the prosecution's contention that the I.W.W. fear of assault was mere "bunkum" to conceal other motives, and to refute the contention that an I.W.W. conspiracy existed.<br>
<br>
Vanderveer offered evidence to prove the existence of an intricate state-wide conspiracy to do away with the I.W.W. In addition, he offered to prove that Grimm had cognizance of the plans of the raid and supported them.  None of this evidence was allowed by the judge.<br>
<br>
Other aspects of the trial were unfavorable to the defense.  In spite of Vanderveer's vehement objection, troops were stationed near the courthouse.  In addition, Legion men in uniform were paid
four dollars a day by the Centralia American Legion to sit in the courtroom throughout the trial.  Two defense witnesses whose testimony placed Grimm near the I.W.W. hall when the raid began were arrested for pe@ury.  This was plainly intimidation.  State witnesses discredited by their own testimony, however, were not subjected to such treatment .<br>
<br>
Ninety-three persons were examined during a two-week period before the twelve jurors and two alternates were chosen.  The jury was made up of four farmers, a teamster, two stationary engineers, a real estate agent, a fisherman, a carpenter, and two laborers, and was not unrepresentative.<br>
<br>
When the trial was concluded, the jury spent a full day in deliberation before reaching a verdict, which the court would not accept.  The jury found two of the defendants, E. Barnett and J. Lamb, guilty of only third-degree murder.  The judge held that this was inadmissable-that a verdict of first- or second-degree murder or of acquittal had to be rendered.  The second verdict, delivered after the jury had been out another two hours, found seven of the men guilty of second-degree murder, two acquitted, and the tenth declared insane .<br>
<br>
With the second verdict the jurors submitted to the court this petition, which they had all signed: "We the undersigned jurors respectfully petition the court to extend the [sic] leniency to the defendants whose names appear on the attached verdict .11 79 When a sentence of a minimum of twenty-five years and a maximum of forty years was given-the Washington law simply prescribed punishment of not less than ten years-some of the jurors were astonished by the court's complete disregard of their plea for leniency.<br>
<br>
The first verdict is especially interesting because Barnett was accused by the prosecution of having fired from the Avalon Hotel the shot that was fatal to Grimm.  The defense alleged that it was "John Doe" Davis, escaped, who fired the shot and that Barnett was in the Roderick Hotel.  A number of witnesses, and Barnett himself, testified that he was in the Roderick Hotcl as a spectator during the affray.<br>
<br>
The report of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America concluded that "The weight of the evidence tends to support his 
[Barnett's] own contention." <B><br>
<br>

</B>The jury evidently thought along similar lines in formulating its more lenient first verdict of third-degree murder against him.  A legionnaire, E. P. Coll, "to clear the Legion's name," made a study of the case and concluded that Barnett had been framed.<br>
<br>
And why did they frame Barnett? Because he had been in the front
room of the Roderick Hotel alongside the I.W.W. hall when the raid took place.... The prosecution knew that he could prove there had been a raid by legionnaires.  So they made him a defendant to keep him from being a witness, and to do that they placed him across the street in the upper window of the Avalon Hotel with a blazing rifle in his hand."<br>
<br>
An "unofficial jury," composed of six labor men elected by as many A.F. of L. labor organizations in the Northwest, sat through the trial and reported on the findings.  Their presence seemed to give validity to Vanderveer's contention that it was a class trial-that the I.W.W. was on trial, not the individual defendants whose lives were in jeopardy.<br>
<br>
Overlooking the point of law raised by the judge, and also mindful of the evidence which the judge would not accept, the labor jury held that the defendants were "not guilty," that there was a C'conspiracy by the business interests of Centralia ... that the hall was unlawfully raided and, finally', that "the defendants did, not get a fair trial."<br>
<br>
It has since been revealed that the verdict was a compromise among the jury members, and between justice and hysteria.  Even the state and the defense agreed on one point: that the nature of the charges required either a verdict of first-degree murder or acquittal.  If there was a conspiracy and murder, the verdict should have been murder in the first degree; if there was no conspiracy to murder, but protection of seer and property, then the verdict should have been acquittal.<br>
<br>
The Montesano verdict violates both justice and common sense.... The men accused were either guilty of premeditated murder-murder in the first degree they were innocent.... Here is a case of jury in-
competence-of a verdict born of compromise or fear of personal consequences, or of plain lack of comprehension, or of reluctance to accept a sworn responsibility.... The jury finds that it was murder without premeditation.  As well have held that Grimm committed suicide.... Fear of personal consequences can only be inferred.... Lack of comprehension was revealed in the jury's invidious discrimination between conspirators.<br>
<br>
Since the fateful days of the trial, most of the jurors have openly expressed their true feelings.  Many signed affidavits admitting that they had believed the defendants to be innocent.  They had agreed to the compromise verdict because of the hysteria that prevailed and to )rotect themselves, and because some members of the jury had, been in favor of hanging the defendants regardless of the evidence.<br>
<br>
P. V. Johnson, one of the jurors, afterward said that "I know I
make mistake but it was too much for one man to do. . . . I cannot get it out of my mind these many years; maybe I go back to Sweden . . . no one will say 'There goes Pete Johnson; he helped send innocent men to rison.' You know we took a ballot, and it was four for acquittal.<br>
<br>
But they would not stick with me.  First it was two left me and then three.  The other Johnson said, "You must be a God-damn wobbly yourself.' And Seflars kept yelling, 'It is P. V. Johnson who is holding out, it is P. V. Johnson!' I thought the bailiff would hear him; he was a stool pigeon.  Another juror, W. E. Inmon, later said, "I signed the leniency petition the same as the rest. . . . I thought they'd get two to five years. . . . When me and Sweitzer give in to second degree, we figured we was doin' the right thing under the circumstances-but we made a terrible mistake. . . . It's not a good thought to live with, that you've sent innocent men over the road." "<br>
<br>
Some of the jurors worked tirelessly with other interested persons and sought for the release of the men.  J. Mclnerny died in p rison of tuberculosis.  L. Roberts was released in I930, after being declared sane.  The two Bland brothers, J. Lamb, B. Smith, and E. Barnett accepted paroles in i932 and 1933.  Ray Becker refused to accept a parole at that time, insisting upon a pardon, but he finally did accept a parole in 1940.<br>

<br>
Sometimes it got a lot more violent.  In 1919, it was Centralia.  I had been in the harvest from Kansas to Canada and had come into Washington to pick apples.  It was the night of November 1 lth in Seattle when the message came to the hall that the American Legion had raided our hall in Centralia.  About a hundred of us took the big G, the Great Northern, to Centralia, where we were met by about a thousand Legionnaires and company gunmen.<br>
<br>
They had raided the hall that day.  When they broke in, four Legionnaires had been killed, and they had captured about ten Wobblies and thrown them in the can.  Supposedly, only one Wobbly was lynched that night, Wesley Everest, but three or four others
were taken out and we never saw them again.  A doctor told an Elks meeting one night that Wesley Everest had been castrated before he was lynched.<br>
<br>
At the Centraha trial, eight Wobblies were found guilty.  Members of the American Legion went into the courts and were paid three dollars a day by the lumber barons to intimidate the jury.  Any worker that showed up was either put out of town or given thirty days.  I was given thirty days because I had on a sack shirt and they found my rigging.<br>
<br>
The convicted Wobblies were given twenty-five to forty-five years in Walla Walla Penitentiary.  Later, the jury said they were intimidated by the Legionnaires with their uniforms, and they all signed affidavits to that effect throughout the years to get our guys released.  There is a monument in Centralia to the four Legionnaires that were killed.  I'd donate money to see it blown off the map.<br>
<br>
Centralia was a very emotional part of my life.  It made me hate the employing class more than ever.  The morning when Elmer Smith was brought back to jail to gather his blankets up-in those days you had to have blankets in jail too-he turned to the eight of them that had been found guilty and said, "Just remember, fellas, I've got a few dollars and my brother's got a few dollars, so as long as we have any money, I'll continue to fight for you to get you out." Which he did, until the day he died.<br>
<br>
We were up in Yakima, Washington, myself and another Wobbly, when the waitress, I don't know why she picked me out, but she said, "Did you know Elmer Smith died?" Well, we beat our way to Centralia for the funeral.<br>
<br>
Out of the clear sky there must have been five hundred lumberjacks and construction workers and Wobblies and friends of Wobblies.  I guess that was about 1928.  There weren't many lawyers like Elmer Smith.  He fought so often he was disbarred as an attomey in the state and could only practice federal cases, but he gave decent attomey's advice on compensation cases.  Finding an attorney to defend workers was a hard thing to do in those days.<br>
<br>
The background to Centralia was our campaign to organize the lumber camps.  We were carrying on a struggle to get the eight hour day.  We wanted to get beds and decent living conditions.  In the lumber camps, the beds were three bunks high and there were no baths.  Workers were lousy and food was lousy.  We ate pig jowls, pig tails, and pig feet.<br>
<br>
We'd say, "Pass the running gears," or "Pass the gate feeder!' Breakfast would be oatmeal and bread with the worst coffee in the world.  Everything was the cheapest you could get.  Each man carried a couple of blankets in an empty sack to be used as a
mattress.<br>
<br>
He'd have to go to the corral where the horses were kept and get straw to fill it.  It smelled bad, especially in the middle of the tent, because most of them were tents, not real bunkhouses.  There would be all those wet clothes, because nine months of the year Washington is full of water, so workers had to boil up and hang their clothes as close to the stove as they possibly could to dry them out.<br>
<br>
One way we harassed the company was to stop working after eight hours, or work two ten hour days and one four hour day and say that equals three eight hour days, and we'd pull out.  We burned blankets whenever we could.  Lots of them wouldn't burn, so we threw gasoline on them and set them on fire.  It was a stinking mess.  Some of the men hated to see their blankets burn because they needed them to sleep in a boxcar, but some of them liked it a lot.<br>
<br>
Whether you liked it or not, your blankets were taken and thrown into the pile.  It was the best way to get some action.  We got the blanket reforms.  We got spring beds, white sheets, two or four to a room instead of forty.  We even got better food.  We ran the belly robber, the cook, out of camp unless we got decent food.  After a while we started to get pork chops and rib steaks instead of joints, tails, livers, kidneys, and hearts.  A lot of these reforms didn't come until the early 1920s.<br>

CENTRALIA MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Joan and Gene Olson, "The Centralia Massacre," <B>Washington Times and Trails.</B> Grants Pass, Oregon: Windyridge Press, 1970, p. 243-255. (excerpts).<br>
<br>
But no one really expected the I.W.W. to go out with a whimper, not in Washington nor anywhere else.  That which lives in violence often dies in violence and the last great outpouring of blood was to take place in Centralia, Washington.<br>
<br>
There are three paramount Wobbly heroes: Joe Hill, Frank Little and Wesley Everest.  All died martyr's deaths.  Hill was a Swe&h immigraflt who wrote stirring words for the Wobbly songbook.  Hill was executed in Utah in 1915 for allegedly killing a Utah grocer during a robbery.<br>

He may have deserved execution, but Wobblies will always believe that his death was ordered by the copper mining kings.  Little, half-Indian and proud of it, was a master organizer.  Masked men lynched Frank Little in Butte, Mcintana, in 1917, after first dragging him, his previously broken leg in a cast, by a rope behind a car.<br>
<br>
Wes Everest was neither poet nor organizer; he merely happened to be sitting in the I.W.W. hall in Centralia, Washington, on Armistice Day, 1919.  Yet Wes Everest's name rings out as loud and clear as any in the Wobbly Valhalla.<br>
<br>
As 1919 wore on, lumbermen in Centralia decided that the time had come to rid Centralia of Wobblies once and for all and they so warned the I.W.W. through advertisements in local newspapers.  They chose a veterans organization, the American Legion, to accomplish their aim. (The Legion in Centralia had,previous experience with the Wobblies, had, in fact, invaded the union hall earlier in the year wielding pipes and mbber hoses.)<br>
<br>
The union fortified the hall and the stage was set for the Centralia Massacre.<br>
<br>
On November 11, 1919, the Legion marched, armed with pipe and hose.  They passed the Wobbly hall and perhaps they stopped in front of it.  At any rate, somebody, somewhere, fired a gun and then another.<br>
Who fired first? Each side, of course, said the other had.  Neither proved its point; perhaps it doesn't really matter.  Both sides could have; both sides wanted to.  At any rate, the legion felt called upon to break its parade formation and storm the building.<br>
<br>
Wes Everest was inside the building, wearing his army uniform. (Not all Wobblies refused military service; Evere ' st had served in France.) The army had taught Everest how to use guns.  When the Legionnaires entered, Everest rose and emptied his rifle into the advancing horde, then dropped the rifle, snatched out a pistol and ran for the woods, pursued by a bellowing mob.<br>
<br>
The fugitive waded to his waist in the Skookumchuck River.  Then, feeling the wild current and realizing that he was about to drown, he stopped and turned to face his tormenters and offered to submit to police arrest.<br>
<br>
It wasn't enough to stop the mob, which plunged into the water after<br>
him.<br>

<br>
Wes Everest fired his pistol four times before it jammed.  He snapped the trigger again and again.  Finally the gun fired and killed Dale Hubbard, nephew of one of the lumbermen who had organized the march on the I.W.W. hall.<br>
<br>
His gun empty, Everest fought the mob with his fists, but soon was overpowered.<br>
<br>
Everest raged, "You don't have the guts to hang a man in the day-
time!<br>
<br>
He was right, for what little it was worth.<br>
<br>
They tied Everest to a car's bumper and dragged him back to Centralia and through Centralia.  Then they had him locked in jail.<br>
Evening came to Centralia.  Lifesaving lights blinked on, lights which Wes Everest knew would protect him.  Perhaps, gentle citizens prayed, the horror had ended.<br>
<br>
Then lights went out all over town.  Figures moved through the blackness and soon beat at the jailhouse door.<br>
<br>
They wanted Wes Everest and they got him, threw him onto the floor of a car and drove to the Chehalis River bridge.<br>
<br>
They hanged him there and riddled his body with bullets.<br>
Only Wobblies were tried for the Centralia Massage.  No one tried to bring Wes Everest's killers to justice.  The American Legion raised $11,750 to pay $4 per day to 50 Legionnaires in uniform to occupy the front seats of the courtroom where the Wobblies were tried.<br>
<br>
Three witnesses who testified that Legionnaires attacked the Wobbly hall before a shot was fired were arrested for perjury as they left the stand; it was that kind of trial.<br>
<br>
After 15 years in prison, the Wobblies were paroled.  No one spent as much as one day in prison for murdering Wesley Everest.  The story ends . . .<br>

CENTRALIA MASSACRE.
Harvey O'Conner, "Tragedy in Centralia," <B>Revolution in Seattle.</B> New York: Monthly Review Press, 1964, p. 170-197.<br>
<br>
So fiercely did the flames of persecution lick around the I.W.W. late in 1919 that only two halls in the entire state of Washington were open, in Seattle and Centralia.<br>
<br>
Continued police raids on the Seattle hall had led Lumber Workers Industrial Union 500, representing some 20,000 loggers in the Pacific Northwest, to canvass its membership on methods of protecting that hall, the nerve center of the union and its central means of contact with the men as they came in from the camps and returned to them.<br>
<br>
Active members, passing through the Seattle hall, voted to call a general strike in the woods <B>if </B>the hall were closed.<br>
<br>
The loggers also voted by 1,282 to 34 to enforce the eight-hour day from the time of leaving the bunkhouse till the return.  In the bigger camps it took 30 minutes to an hour to get from the camp to the scene of logging operations - "dead time" for which the men got no pay.  They also voted overwhelmingly to ban overtime work except in emergency, to provide more jobs at a time when unemployment was mounting.<br>
<br>
In the big camps along the slopes of the Cascades and the Olympics, the I.W.W. was a potent force in holding the basic eight-hour day and working conditions against postwar pressures.  But by its nature the I.W.W. was more of a movement than an organization; in con-
fronting the companies, most of which were implacable in their opposition to any form of unionism, and particularly to it, the I.W.W. maintained conditions only by an incessant guerrilla struggle.<br>
<br>
In the Grays Harbor region and the rest of southwest Washington the I.W.W. was by no means so well entrenched.  No Wobbly halls were tolerated in Aberdeen, Hoquiam, and the other mill towns.  In Raymond, a sad little sawmill town, Wobblies were rounded up early in 1918 and tried en masse in the Commercial Club on charges of vagrancy.  Their crime - refusal to work 12 hours a day in the woods.<br>
<br>
Mark Litchman, the doughly Seattle socialist lawyer, faced not only the hostile court, a battery of lumber company lawyers, but also a hundred soldiers compelled to attend the trial in an effort to terrify the I.W.W. and their attorney.  The soldiers however enjoyed their respite from working the twelve-hour day in the woods, to which they had been consigned to break the I.W.W. general strike for the eight-hour day.<br>
<br>
Many of the soldiers said after a taste of logging that they too
would have struck if they could have.  Ironically, only a few weeks after the vagrancy trial the eight-hour day was decreed by the government.<br>
<br>
In the fall of 1919 unemployment was spreading and wages were slipping.  A labor market report in New Solidarity, the I.W.W. weekly, read:<br>
<br>
ABERDEEN, Oct. 16 -The market this week is noticeably sluggish and buyers are very cautious because of the large number of slaves offered.<br>
<br>
lt is the general opinion that the masters will, if the offerings continue so heavy, dispose of their old stock and supply themselves in a disaper market.  On the other hand the slaves, not being able to sell their services, are considering reducing the labor supply by continuing with the I.W.W. and creating a shortage by establishing the six-hour day.<br>
<br>
Good strong young common labor slaves are selling for $4.50 and $5 a day; semi-skilled and skilled, $5 to $7; runts, cripples and old slaves find few buyers.<br>
<br>
About midway between Seattle and Portland lies Centralia, then a town of some 7,000, a lumber, railroad, and trading center for Lewis County, which sweeps down from the summit of the Cascades to the Grays Harbor country.  In September, 1919, Britt Smith leased a store-front hall in the two-story wooden Roderick Hotel, a workingmen's rooming house on drab Tower Avenue, for an I.W.W. hall.<br>
<br>
It took a man of uncommon courage to consider opening an I.W.W. hall in Centralia in 1919.  There had been a Wobbly hall a few blocks away the year before but during a Red Cross parade April 30, 1918, a group of business men stormed it, smashed doors and windows, piled furniture and files in the street and beat up the Wobblies inside.  After setting fire to the hall, the hoodlums then lifted the I.W.W. by the ears onto trucks and took them out of town, where they were dumped into a ditch, beaten again, and warned never to return.<br>
<br>
An old blind news vendor named Tom Lassiter had a little stand where he sold the Industrial Worker, the Union Record, and other labor and radical papers.  One night in June, 1919, a bunch of men overturned his stand, destroyed his papers and warned him to quit.  Undaunted, Lassiter re-established his business.  On June 13 he was seized at his stand, thrown into an auto and dumped into a ditch at the county line and warned not to return.<br>
<br>
 At that the Union Record up in Seattle became interested and sent a reporter to inquire into the state of affairs in Centralia.  Later, even more disquieting news reached Seattle.  The Record
reported on October 24:<br>
<br>
ANARCHY URGED BY CENTRALIA BUSINESS REDS<br>
<br>
Prepare to Ignore Law in Hysterical Plan of Direct Action<br>
<br>
CENTRALIA - The "business reds" of this city are again preparing to drive out the "wobblies" and at a recent meeting organized a secret committee of ten who are said to be pledged to drive every member of the organization and every citizen who sympathizes with it out of the district.<br>
<br>
The alleged action was taken at a meeting of the Centralia Citizens' Protective League, held in the Elks' hall and presided over by William Scales, a grocer who was accused of playing a leading part in the kidnapping of Thomas Lassiter, Union Record agent, last June.  F. B. Hubbard, the so-called "busted lumber baron of Southwest Washington," is said to have taken an active part in the meeting and to have clashed with members of the city council and the chief of police over methods to be employed in -forcing the I.W.W. out of town.<br>
<br>
Hubbard, it is said, declared if he were chief he would rid the town of wobblies" in 24 hours.  This statement is alleged to have been made after the chief of police had declared there was no law under which he could drive the organization out of the city.  Scales is reported to have advocated direct action, declaring that he did not believe any jury would be obtained that would find those taking part in a raid on the I.W.W. hall guilt@ of violating the law.<br>
<br>
Every "wobblie" is to be listed, business men themselves to refuse to employ any man known to be a member or suspected of sympathizing with the organization.  The gathering- of these lists has already started.<br>
<br>
Reports of this meeting excited the admiration of the Tacoma News-Tribune, which applauded the good old vigilante spirit, in the tradition of the West of yore.  It appeared that after the various acquittals in trials of radicals, the Employers Association of Washington, dominated by the lumber interests, was through with legality.<br>
<br>
The I.W.W. must go; if juries chosen from the people wouldn't do their duty, then it was time for the torch and the noose!<br>
<br>
The secret committee, composed of employers, businessmen, and American Legion officials, laid its plans, which were announced November 7. The Legion post was to parade Armistice Day, November I
1, and its route included that part of Tower Avenue where the I.W.W. hall was located.  As that section of town consisted of third-rate hotels, pool halls, cheap restaurants, and nondescript stores, the choice was ominous.<br>
<br>
In alarm Mr. and Mrs. James McAllister, proprietors of the Roderick Hotel, in whose building the hall was rented, appealed to the police chief for protection.  He replied quite coolly that there weren't enough police in Centralia to stop the marchers if they decided to invade the hall.<br>
<br>
The group of I.W.W., some dozen or more then in town, gathered with Secretary Britt Smith to consider what to do.  There were three choices before them: Close the hall on Armistice Day and allow it to be sacked, as the earlier one had been in the previous year.  Stand by in the hall and be beaten up by the Legionnaires and deported - the Everett treatment.<br>
<br>
Or they could defend their hall.  The I.W.W. conferred with a young attorney, Elmer Smith, who had incurred the wrath of the upper<br>
crust by defending workinghmen against employers in wage and<br>
other claims.  Smith told them that under the law they were within their rights in defending the hall against attack, even with guns.<br>
<br>
Prudent men, valuing their own skins, would have closed the hall in the face of the obvious threat.  But prudence was not a Wobbly trait.  Rather their shining glory stood out in audacity, courage, and stubbornness in defense of their rights, and for that they are remembered in history.<br>
<br>
It was typical too of their utter decentralization and local autonomy that apparently it did not occur to any of them to get in touch with the western headquarters of the I.W.W. in Seattle on a matter which was to prove of transcendental importance to the entire I.W.W. movement.<br>
<br>
Nearly all the I.W.W. in Centralia were loggers, young men, and some were returned servicemen - all familiar with weapons.  In those days knowledge of firearms was not the monopoly of sportsmen and soldiers; on the western frontier guns were the common equipment of the pioneers, and Washington was still near the pioneer days.<br>
<br>
The returned soldiers among them considered the best methods of defense.  On the other side of the street in the next block and some 300 feet away was the Arnold Hotel, another workingmen's place, and down Tower Avenue, near the intersection of Second Street, was the Avalon House.<br>
<br>
At some distance from the Roderick Hotel was Seminary Hill which overlooked the avenue.  From the hall itself and from these vantage points, the hall could be protected if need be.<br>

The I.W.W. printed a thousand copies of a circular which was widely distributed in Centralia November 4, a week before the parade.  It read:<br>
<br>
TO THE CITIZENS OF CENTRALIA WE MUST APPEAL<br>
<br>
To the Law-Abiding Citizens of Centralia and to the Working Class in General:<br>
<br>
We beg of you to read and carefully consider the following: The profileering class of Centralia have of late been waving the flag of our country in an endeavor to incite the lawless elements of our city to raid our hall and club us out of town.... These profileers are holding numerous meetings to that end, and covertly inviting returned service men to do their bidding....<br>
<br>
These criminal thugs call us a band of outlaws bent on destruction.  This they do in an attempt to hide their own dastardly work in burning our hall and destroying our property.  They say we are a menace; and we are a menace to all mobocrats and pilfering thieves.  Never did the I.W.W. burn public or private halls, kidnap their fellow citizens, destroy their property, club their fellows out of town, bootleg, or act in any way as lawbreakers.... Our only crime is solidarity, loyalty to the working class, and justice to the oppressed.<br>
<br>
It was no secret on the streets of Centralia that the I.W.W. hall was to be raided Armistice Day.  The weekly meeting of the Lewis County A.F. of L. Trades Council was troubled by these reports; Vice President William Dunning got in touch with Warren 0. Grimm, who had just been elected commander of the Legion post, and told him that the labor unions strongly disapproved of such lawlessness.  "You fellows are making a mistake," Grimm replied.  "Decent labor should keep out of this."<br>
<br>
Clearly there was no "third force" to stand between the Legion and the I.W.W. Ministers of the church either whooped it up for violence or were silent; the "better element" was all for blasting the I.W.W. out of town; the ordinary working people didn't count for much.  The Legionnaires were determined to clean out a nest of vipers; the Wobblies were just as determined not to permit a second sacking of their hall.<br>
<br>
The parade formed downtown about 2:00 P.m. on November 11, a drizzly day that cut down attendance a good bit.  After traversing the main streets, the line of march led off to Tower Avenue.  With the Legionnaires at the head, the marchers passed the I.W.W. hall, its window emblazoned with the three-star Wobbly emblem in red, and then stopped at the next cross street where the Legionnaires held back as
the rest of the parade formed ranks and reversed its march to pass the I.W.W. hall again.<br>
<br>
Watching carefully in the I.W.W. hall were Wesley Everest, Britt Smith, Ray Becker, James McInerney, Tom Morgan, Bert Faulkner, and Mike Sheehan.  On Seminary Hill were Loren Roberts, Bert Bland, and Ole Hanson; in the Arnold Hotel, O.C. Bland and John Lamb; in the Avalon House, "John Doe," Davis.  Eugene Barnett was in the office of the Roderick Hotel.<br>
<br>
The Elks in the parade and some youngsters, headed by the color guard, passed the I.W.W. hall for the second time and then the Chehalis Legion post, followed by the Centralia Legion men, formed the tail of the procession.  The Chehalis contingent had already reached the next cross street beyond the Wobbly hall when the Centralia group stopped in front of the hall.<br>
<br>
The postmaster of Centralia and a minister who had opposed state abolition of capital punishment both dangled ropes in their hands.  Annoyed by the progress of the Chehalis Legionnaires, the parade marshal rode up to them on his horse and challenged: "What is the matter with you fellowsl Aren't you in on this?" He signaled with his whistle and from the Centralia marchers rose the cry, "Come on, boys! Let's get them."<br>
<br>
There was a dash toward the hall, the window with the infuriating I.W.W. emblem came crashing down, and men surged forward against the sagging door, which yielded.<br>
<br>
Shots rang out from inside the hall, from Avalon House and the Arnold Hotel, and from Seminary Hill.  Post Commander Warren 0. Grimm was shot in the abdomen and staggered to a nearby store.  Arthur McElfresh, shot in the head, died almost instantly.  Ben Casagranda fell on the street, mortally wounded.  Several paraders received minor wounds.<br>
<br>
The Legionnaires swarmed into the hall; the Wobblies retreated to a disused ice storage compartment in the rear.  After wrecking the hall, the Legionnaires forced open the ice compartment and dragged out the I.W.W. But one ' Wesley Everest, an ex-serviceman, had darted out the back door, firing his .45 Colt as he went.  Everest fled down an alley, pursued by rifle bullets, and gained the bank of the Skookumchuck River, which he attempted to ford.<br>
<br>
It was too deep and swift, and he came back up the bank, revolver still in hand.  Dale Hubbard, nephew of F. B. Hubbard of the Eastern Railway & Lumber Company and former president of the Employers Association of Washington, headed the mob.  Everest shouted that he would surrender to an officer of the law, but not to the mob.  He fired and Hubbard fell, mortally wounded.<br>
<br>
His revolver hot and empty, Everest was seized by the mob, his teeth were knocked out, and he was led to jail with a belt around his neck.  "You haven't got the guts to lynch a man in broad daylight,"
he jeered through bloody lips.  He was right.<br>
<br>
That night at 8 o'clock the lights went out  all  over  Centralia.<br>
<br>
Soon thereafter a group of men drove up to the jail, smashed in a door and dragged Everest out.  They threw him into a car which headed a procession to the Chehalis River bridge on the outskirts of town.  The lights then went back on in Centralia.<br>
<br>
Badly beaten again, Everest would not give up.  From his position on the floor in the back of the car he hit out at his assailants.  Someone in the back seat then proceeded to castrate Everest as the others held the screaming man.<br>
<br>
"For Christ's sake, men," he pleaded, "shoot me-don't let me suffer this way." Years later a visiting Legionnaire who was looking into the events of that horrid night interviewed the castrator.  Every few minutes, the visitor said, the man got up and washed his hands.<br>
<br>
In any event his business shrank, for self-respecting workers said they'd rather die than have anything to do with him.<br>
<br>
At the bridge Everest was dragged out and a rope knotted around his neck, and his body flung over.  Everest clutched at a plank; Legionnaires stamped on his fingers, and he fell.  Dissatisfied with the knot, the lynchers pulled the body back up and used a longer rope, and hurled the body over again.<br>
<br>
Still dissatisfied, they hauled Everest's body up a third time - by then he must have been dead - and tied a more professional knot on a longer rope and flung the body over.  Then, with car lights playing on the scene, they amused themselves awhile by shooting at the swaying body.  Satiated at last, the mob left and darkness returned.  Next morning somebody cut the rope and the body fell into the Chehalis River.<br>
<br>
Fearful that friends of Everest might rescue the corpse and bear it away, a posse searched the river and recovered it.  Then they dumped the horribly mutilated body on the floor of the <B>jail where</B> the Wobblies from their cells could <B>see it, and</B> there it stayed for two days.  Finally the deputies on November 15 gave shovels to a detail of four imprisoned I.W.W.'s and took them to a field on the outskirts of town where they were forced to dig a grave into which the body was flung.  Such was the end of Wesley Everest, who died grim, game, and staunch in his principles.<br>
<br>
A grisly kind of perverted humor marked the coroner's report on Everest's death.  Everest had broken out of jail, the coroner said, and taken a rope with him to the bridge.  There he tied the knot
around his neck, jumped off, but failing to kill himself, climbed back up and jumped off a second time; still alive, he climbed back up, shot himself in the neck and jumped off the bridge again; woke up at seven in the morning, cut the rope, fell into the river, and was drowned.<br>
<br>
The coroner's grim whimsy was no surprise to townspeople who knew what had gone on the previous night.  This joker was rewarded by being made superintendent of the state insane asylum in Steilacoom.<br>
Followed days of horror and nights of terror for the imprisoned I.W.W. By day they were grilled incessantly by prosecutors, kept incommunicado and denied legal counsel.<br>
<br>
By night the mob gathered outside the jail, cursing, blowing auto horns, flashing lights into the darkened jail room, throwing various missiles through the windows, pointing loaded guns through the bars.  In the cold November nights there were neither mattresses nor blankets.  Loren Roberts, a youngster of 19, went insane.  For ten nights the hellish scenes were re-enacted.<br>
<br>
In the meantime posses searched the hills around Centralia for those who might have escaped.  The American Legion took over control of the region from the police and sheriff.  On November 15 a posse came across a lone armed man, John Haney.  They shot and killed him; it turned out that he too was a posseman, out hoping to bag a Wobbly.  The first reports said he had been killed by roaming I.W.W.'s and these made the headlines across the nation; later reports of the truth were buried on inside pages.<br>
<br>
Across the state more than a thousand were arrested in the various man hunts for Wobblies.  They were supervised by the county prosecuting attorneys who had been called into session by the state's attorney-general and instructed to hunt down every Wobbly, and use the criminal syndicalism statute to try them en masse.  Federal warrants were issued for T.F.G. Dougherty and Walker C. Smith to impede publicity for the defense.  Dougherty left for Canada and Smith went into temporary seclusion to carry on his mission.<br>
<br>
The nation was stunned by the news that came over the wires from the Associated Press in Centralia.  Armed Wobblies had deliberately and wantonly fired into a parade of Legionnaires, killing four.  Even Big Bill Haywood, out on bail in Chicago, was said to have blanched.  He was quoted as saying that the I.W.W. did not condone murder.  From one end of the nation to the other came cries for the extermination of the I.W.W., with or without waiting for due process.<br>
<br>
The news appalled the editorial staff of the Seattle Union Record, too.  Two reporters were sent posthaste to check the facts, in a
flivver flying side curtains to shield them from the rain.<br>
<br>
They found Centralia beleaguered by the Legion, the jail out of bounds, and they felt fortunate to escape with their lives.<br>
The inquest over the bodies of the four Legionnaires was held November 12, and by the next day the Centralia tragedy began to take on another aspect.  The Associated Press reported:<br>
<br>
CENTRALIA, Nov. 13 - Testimony tending to show that the marching ex-
service men started toward the I.W.W. hall before shots were fired from the building or from the Avalon hotel opposite, featured the coroner's inquest over the bodies of four former soldiers killed here last Tuesday and is said to have been responsible for the failure of the jury in rendering its verdict to fix responsibility for the shooting.<br>
<br>
Dr. Frank Bickford, one of the marchers, testified that the door of the I.W.W. hall was forced open by participants in the parade before the shooting began through the doorway or from the Avalon hotel opposite.  Dr. Bickford said he was immediately in front of the I.W.W. hall at the time and that during a temporary halt some one suggested a raid on the hall.<br>
<br>
"I spoke up and said I would lead if enough would follow," he stated, "but before I could take the lead there were many ahead of me.  Some one next to me put his foot against the door and forced it open, after which a shower of bullets poured through the opening about us."<br>
<br>
The AP reported that Dr. Herbert Y. Bell, also a marcher, said the surge toward the hall and the shots were "as nearly simultaneous as any human acts could be." The correspondent who had blurted out the truth was hounded out of Centralia.  The lumbermen back of the Legion wanted no more of that kind of reporting.<br>
<br>
One  lone  Legion  voice  spoke  out   against   the   hysteria.   Commander Edward F. Bassett of Silver Bow Post in Butte, Montana, said:<br>
<br>
The I.W.W. in Centralia who fired upon the men that were attempting to raid the I.W.W. headquarters there were fully justified in their act.  Mob rule in this country must be stopped, and when mobs attack the home of a millionaire, or of a laborer, or of the I.W.W., it is not only the right but the duty of the occupants to resist with every means within their power.  If the officers of the law cannot stop these raids, perhaps the resistance of the raiders may have that effect.<br>
<br>
To the Employers Association of Washington, which had masterminded the attack, the blood on the streets of Centralia must have seemed
a cheap price to pay if it helped achieve the ultimate goal - the destruction of all organized labor in the state.  Still smarting under the fiasco of Mayor Ole Hanson's revolution" after the Seattle general strike earlier in the year, which had failed to smash the labor movement or even to convict a single victim, the employers wheeled in quickly for the kill this time.<br>
<br>
Their favorite organ, the Seattle P-I, sounded the shrill warcry the day after the Armistice Day tragedy.  In a lengthy editorial November 12, it said:<br>
<br>
BACK TO THE SOURCES<br>
<br>
The blood of our servicemen assassinated in Centralia demands some plain speaking.  The Centralia outrage is the culmination of a long series of events, in which several agencies have played a disloyal, a discreditable and a hypocritical part.<br>
<br>
Frankly, we charge:<br>
<br>
That organized labor in Seattle and in the state of Washington has given aid and comfort to the I.W.W. and to every anarchistic organization and influence within the state;<br>
<br>
That the Seattle Union Record, the official organ of organized labor, has given every encouragement to the I.W.W.; has used every artifice of propaganda to incite them to violence in peace and to sedition in war....<br>
<br>
The Union Record is today an I.W.W. organ, and every union man in this city and in this state knows it.  It stands for revolution, soviets, proletarian dictatorships; and by every art of suggestion, innuendo and falsehood it seeks to bring these things to pass.  Dur-
ing the war it was just as disloyal as it dared to be, and now it is just as anarchistic as it dares to be.<br>
<br>
The same day the Union Record replied to this attack in an editorial to become nearly as famous as the "We are on the road -NO ONE KNOWS WHERE" editorial before the general strike.  It was headed:<br>
<br>
DON'T SHOOT 1N THE DARK<br>
<br>
Violence begets violence.<br>
<br>
Anarchy calls for anarchy.
That is the answer to the Centralia tragedy.<br>
<br>
And the reason for it is found in the constant stream of laudation in the kept press of unamerican, illegal and violent physical attack upon the persons of those who disagree with the powers that be.<br>
<br>
The rioting which culminated in the deaths of three of our returned service men at Centralia last night was the result of a long series of illegal acts by these men themselves - acts which no paper in the state was American enough to criticize except the Union Record.... Organized labor has had no connection with nor had <B>it </B>any sympathy for the perpetrators of the violence at Centralia, <B>NO </B>MATTER WHOM <B>THEY MAY </B>BE, and from the facts at hand both sides have earned the severest condemnation of law-abiding people.<br>
<br>
We advise all to await with us the development of the truth about the whole affair.<br>
<br>
Such counsel did not please the choleric Seattle Times.  In a flaming editorial, it declaimed:<br>
There is but one effective answer to the methods employed by the<br>
I.W.W.<br>
<B><br>
TERRORIZE THE AMERICAN BOLSHEVIKIT ....</B><br>
<br>
Organized labor must be made to understand that unless it <B>CLEANS</B> HOUSE there will not be, anywhere in this section, any of organized labor left!<br>
<br>
It was at this point that the roof fell in on the Union Record.   On November 13, two days after the Armistice Day tragedy, the Department of justice seized the Record's plant and arrested Editor Ault and Frank A. Rust and George P. Listman of the Record's board, on charges of sedition.  Barrels of documents were carted off to the federal building for examination.<br>
<br>
The Record staff moved fast.  As soon as the marshals had departed an extra edition was prepared that came rolling off the press at 9:00 P.m. Some 25,000 copies were sold that night - the biggest "extra" in Seattle history.  The next day the marshals<br>
appeared again and padlocked the plant.<br>
<br>
On a flatbed press of a suburban paper the Record then published a bob-tailed edition by running the machinery day and night.  The copies sold like hotcakes for a nickel a copy, though the regular price was two cents.  The "extra" carried this editorial:<br>
<br>
REASON WILL TRIUMPH
"Terrorize the Reds," they say, and describe all who venture to hold different opinions from themselves as "Reds."<br>
<br>
From news reports of latest events in Centralia it appears that the I.W.W. hall was attacked before the fatal shots were fired.  The coroner's jury, because of the testimony of competent witnesses, has failed to fix the blame for the shooting.<br>
<br>
These developments do not justify the shootings.  They do justify the stand taken by the Union Record, when the first reports of the tragedy arrived.  We told the truth then and we will continue to do so always.<br>
<br>
Just as long as the "kept" press of the city incites to riot, just as  long as they continue to lie, there will be little social and industrial peace here.<br>
<br>
On November 21 the U.S. Commissioner ordered the Union Record's plant returned, holding that the warrant was faulty.  Embarrassed perhaps by the too-flagrant show of prejudice against the labor paper, the Department of justice even-handedly cracked down also on the P-I and the Star.<br>
<br>
The federals did not go so far as to seize their plants but merely suppressed editions in which appeared an unusually virulent paid advertisementby Edwin Selvin, editor of the Business Chronicle.  Among choice items from Editor Selvin's editorial statement were these:<br>
<br>
Real Americans must rise as one man in the righteous wrath of outraged patriotism.  First, invoke such legal machinery as we have, and if that is not sufficient, then hastily construct something foolproof.  We must smash every unamerican and anti-American organization in the land.  We must put to death the leaders in this gigantic conspiracy of murder, pillage and revolution.  We must imprison for life all its aiders and abetters of native birth.  We must deport the aliens.<br>
<br>
The I.W.W., the Nonpartisan League, the so-called Triple Alliance in the state of Washington, the pro-German Socialists, the Closed Shop Labor Unions, the agitators, malcontents, anarchists, syndicalists, seditionists, traitors - the whole motley crew of Bolshevists and near-Bolshevists - must be outlawed by Public Opinion and hunted down and hounded until driven beyond the horizon of civic decency.<br>
<br>
Selvin included in his devil-list President Wilson whose New Freedom had unlocked the treacherous chain of events, President Samuel Gompers of the "UnAmerican Federation of Labor," and Louis F. Post, the assistant U.S. Secretary of Labor who "came to the Pacific
Northwest on a speaking tour inflaming the masses and inciting to resistance to law by his preachments of Sovietism and Bolshevism." "The whole Labor Movement," cried Selvin, "is putrid, its rottenness taints the atmosphere of every industrial center....<br>
<br>
"The chief exponent of anarchy in this community is the Union Record ... a journalistic sewer into which flows all the slime of moral perverts.... Public policy requires that the mouthpiece of applied anarchy cease to exist."<br>
<br>
Selvin was arrested for mailing unmailable matter.  His bail was set at only $1,000, although the Union Record's officials had<br>
post bail of five thousand dollars and six thousand dollars each.<br>
<br>
When Selvin's ad appeared in the early edition of the P-I, the chapels of the printing trades met hastily at 10:30 P.m. and noti-
fied the management that no union man would touch type or press if subsequent editions carried the Selvin outburst.  The printing trades resolution, presented to the management, read:<br>
<br>
As members of the several trade unions employed in the production of your newspaper, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, we make the following representations:<br>
<br>
We have been patient under misrepresentation, faithful in the face of slander, long suffering under insult; we have upheld our agree-
ments and produced your paper, even though in so doing we were braiding the rope with which you propose to hang us; day after day we have put in type, stereotyped, printed and mailed calumny after calumny, lie after lie, insult after insult.<br>
<br>
Little by little, as our patience seemed to be unbounded, your editorial and business policy has encroached upon and further and further overstepped the bounds, not only of fairness and truth, but decency and Americanism itself.  We have even meekly witnessed your unfair and reprehensible campaign of falsehood and ruin result in the suppression of the last medium of honest expression for<br>
our cause in Seattle, not only denying our brothers the means of livelihood, but denying us a far greater boon - the American right<br>
of a free press.<br>
<br>
So long as these things appeared to be a part of your unfair fight against organization - our organization and others - we have been able to endure them in the hope that at last truth might prevail.<br>
<br>
But there must be a limit to all things.<br>
<br>
In the page advertisement in the Post-Intelligencer of November 18, 1919, purporting to have been written and paid for by one Selvin, but which had as well have occupied the position in your paper usually taken up by your editorial page, your utter depravity as a
newspaper, your shameless disregard of the laws of the land, your hatred of opposition, your reckless policy of appeal to the passions of citizenry, rearched depths of malice and malignancy hitherto un-
believable.  It.is nothing less than excitation to violence, stark and naked invitation to anarchy.<br>
<br>
Therefore, be it resolved, by the whole committee of your organized employed in meeting assembled, That if your business management cannot demonstrate its capacity and sagacity, if your editorial directing heads must remain blind to the thing they are bringing us to; if together you cannot see the abyss to which you are leading us - all of us; if you have no more love for our common country than is manifested in your efforts to plunge it into anarchy, then as I American citizens - many of us ex-service men who very clearly proved our faith in America and its institutions - we must, not because we are unionists but because we are Americans, find means to protect ourselves from the stigma of having aided and abetted your campaign of destruction.<br>
<br>
J.     M. HEPSHEY, Chairman; JOHN J. WENNER, E. A. GRABER, M. OLNEY, ALVARO C. SHOEMAKER, Committee.<br>
<br>
The offending ad was dropped from subsequent editions.  It was perhaps the first and only instance in American journalistic history when the union printing trades staff presumed to reprimand their employers.<br>
<br>
The Department of justice scrutinized the Union Record to obtain evidence to support its charge of sedition.  To strengthen the indictment, Anna Louise Strong was also arrested.  The Department charged that Ault, Listman, Rust, and Miss Strong had tried to<br>
incite, provoke and encourage resistance to the United States by the following means and methods, among others, to wit: by presenting and purporting to advance the interests of the laborers as a class<br>
and giving them complete control and ownership of all property and of the means of producing and distributing property through the abolition of all other classes of society described as "capitalists,"  " the capitalistic class," "the master class," "the ruling class," "exploiters of workers," "Bourgeois," such abolition to be accomplished not by political action, or with any regard for right or wrong, but by the continual and persistent use and employment of unlawful, tortuous and physical means and methods involving threats, assaults, injuries, intimidations, and murder upon the persons, and the injury and destruction (known to said defendants and their said confederates and associates as "sabotage...... direct action," "working on the public," "wearing the wooden shoes," "working the sab cat," and slow down" tactics) of the property of such other classes, the forcible resistance to the execution of the laws of the United States and the forcible, revolutionary overthrow of existing Governmental authority in the United States, use of which said means and methods was to accompany, and to be accomplished in art by, local strikes, industry strikes and general strikes . . . depicting as heroes and martyrs Kate
<br>
O'Hare, Eugene V. Debs, Hulet M. Wells, William D. Haywood....<br>
<br>
As if all this were not enough, they were also accused of using the post office to distribute "indecent and unmailable matters,<br>
to wit: printed matter of a character tending to incite arson, murder and assassination..."<br>
<br>
The indictment read like a paraphrase of Edwin Selvin's most lurid prose; indeed instead of indicting Selvin on a parallel charge it would have seemed more logical for the government to subpoena him as its chief witness.<br>
<br>
This farrago was filed in federal court December 2. A month later judge Jeremiah Neterer took a look at the mess of evidence handed up to him and decided that "nowhere is there apparent any statement advocating any change other than by constitutional methods ... nor is there anything printed which would tend to support Germany and Austria-Hungary." Case dismissed.  So was Selvin's.<br>
<br>
Thus once again the open-shop forces of the state had overshot their mark, in trying to crucify the whole labor movement for the Centralia tragedy, after failing to destroy it at the time of the general strike nine months earlier in 1919.<br>
<br>
But in Centralia it was quite otherwise.<br>
<br>
There the imprisoned Wobblies stood alone, physically at any rate.  The only man in Centralia who might have helped them legally, Elmer Smith, their attorney, had been thrown into jail with them.  The Lewis County Bar Association voted to ban any Iegal assistance from its members.  The prisoners were sealed off from the world - it was revealed only that one by one they were being questioned by a staff of prosecutors recruited around the state, some of them attorneys for lumber companies.<br>
<br>
Tom Morgan yielded to the inquisition and confessed.  In the main what he revealed could be assumed logically by anyone, that the I.W.W. had planned to defend their hall, but his confession enabled the state to pinpoint the location of the various defendants on the fateful day.  The 19-year-old Loren Roberts collapsed into insanity, clouding his confession.  Eleven men were indicted for the first degree murder of Warren 0. Grimm, among them Elmer Smith, for advising them of their rights.<br>
<br>
As late as November 21, the Centralia Chronicle reported: "Centralia police affairs are still under complete control of the Amer-ican Legion, a special committee of the local post, headed by Lt. Frank Van Gilder, directing all investigations of Wobblies arrested and organizing the man hunts."<br>
<br>
In this case the prosecution was taking no chances, such as a trial
in a big city where organized labor had influence.  A change of venue was granted to Montesano, the county seat of adjoining Grays Harbor County, a town of some 2,000, innocent of any vestige of labor organization.<br>
<br>
This change was granted over the vehement opposition of the Centralia Legion, which wanted a legalized lynching party right at the scene of the tragedy.  Attorney George F. Vanderveer, who was busy in Chicago handling appeals of the national I.W.W. prisoners, hurried to Montesano to plead for a second change of venue to Olympia or Tacoma farther removed from the scene of passion. judge George D. Abel agreed with him; the prosecution then retained the judge's brother as associate counsel so the judge hail to disqualify himself.<br>
<br>
The other Grays Harbor judge was held to be too favorable to labor, so Governor Hart named judge John M.Wilson, who had delivered a eulogy of the dead Legionnaires.  He promptly vetoed a change in venue.<br>
<br>
Montesano was bursting at the seams when the trial opened January 25.  The Legion had raised a fund of $11,750 among employers - mostly lumber companies - to pay some 50 Legionnaires at $4 a day and keep to attend the trial in uniform, and they occupied the front of the courtroom.  Because, the state said, the I.W.W. might descend en masse on the little town to free the prisoners, a troop of federal soldiers was encamped on the courthouse lawn; their martial music floated in to add to the tension.<br>
<br>
Vanderveer's case rested upon the arguments that the I.W.W. had defended their hall, as they were entitled to do by law, and that they had every reason to fear violence from the Legion parade.  He was alone, pitted against six attorneys for the prosecution.  In his opening statement he cited the demolition of the carlier hall in 1918; organization of the citizens' committee in June, 1919; the kidnapping of Tom Lassiter; the vote to set up a secret committee <B>with the open</B> aim of <B>drivinz the Wobblies</B> from Centralia; the articles in the Centralia papers openly proclaiming that purpose; the I.W.W. circular pleading with towiispeople to avert the attack; and numerous placards posted around the I.W.W. hall and elsewhere threatening violence.<br>
<br>
Curtly judge Wilson demolished practically all of Vanderveer's case by ruling that evidence of the attack on the earlier hall and of all the ominous preparations for repetition of that act on Armistice Day was irrelevant.  The sole question before the jury was, Who murdered Warren 0. Grimm?<br>
<br>
Vanderveer sought by every legal stratagem to connect Grimm with the attack on the hall and indeed what was presented in court would have satisfied most.  But what could be done in Montesano? Three
witnesses who testified to Grimm's attack on the hall were promptly arrested for perjury as they left the stand.  At that Vanderveer almost came to blows with the sheriff.<br>
<br>
Though arrested, the witnesses were never prosecuted, but the threat of instant arrest threw a pall over efforts to obtain more defense witnesses.<br>
<br>
Who were the men in the dock?<br>
<br>
First, there was Eugene Barnett, charged directly with the murder of Grimm - the rest being accomplices.  He was a coal miner and member of both the I.W.W. and the United Mine Workers.  He had not been in the hall at all but in the adjoining Roderick Hotel, unarmed.  When he heard the shooting, he slipped out by a back door and went home.  Escaping to the woods, he was captured in the manhunt.<br>
<br>
Ray Becker, logger, age 25, had studied for the ministry and his father and brother were preachers.  He joined the I.W.W. in 1917.  Armed with an Ivor Johnson .38 revolver, he defended himself in the hall until his ammunition was exhausted.<br>
<br>
James McInerney, logger, born in Ireland, joined the I.W.W. in 1916 and was wounded on the "Verona." He was in the hall and resisted with arms.<br>
<br>
Britt Smith, I.W.W. secretary, who lived in the hall.  A logger, age 38, he was the man the mob was looking for when they lynched Wesley Everest by mistake.  He was armed.<br>
<br>
Bert Bland, logger, joined the I.W.W. in 1917.  He fired from Seminary Hill and took to the woods, being captured a week<br>
later during the manhut.<br>
<br>
Loren Roberts, logger, age 19, who broke down under prison<br>
treatment and went insane.  He fired from Seminary Hill.<br>
<br>
0. C. Bland, logger, resident of Centralia for many years.  A brother of Bert Bland.  He was in the Arnold Hotel, armed.<br>
<br>
John Lamb, logger, joined the I.W.W. in 1917, a resident of Centralia.  He was in the Arnold Hotel, unarmed.<br>
<br>
Mike Sheehan, 64, born in Ireland, and a lifetime union man.  He was arrested, unarmed, in the union hall.<br>
<br>

Bert Faulkner, 21, a logger, member of the I.W.W. since 1917, and an ex-serviceman.  He was in the hall, unarmed.<br>
<br>
Elmer Smith, lawyer, who advised the I.W.W. about their legal rights.<br>
<br>
Ole Hanson, who was on Seminary Hill, made his getaway and disappeared.<br>
<br>
"John Doe" Davis, in the Avalon House, armed, also escaped.<br>
<br>
Tom Morgan, who was in the hall, unarmed, turned state's evidence and was not indicted.<br>
<br>
None of the indicted men, aside from Britt Smith and Elmer<br>
Smith, could be called leaders.  They were rank-and-file union men, loggers, imbued with a faith in their class and with the high courage to defend their rights against odds which in reality were insuperable.  Their dogged determination was of a piece with that of the martyrs in all ages.<br>
<br>
The press table at Montesano was crowded; never before had there been a time when the name of the sleepy little courthouse town had appeared in the nation's press.  Side by side with the correspondents for the big news services and the Pacific Northwest dailies was a new type of correspondent the labor reporter.<br>
<br>
The Seattle Union Record sent its ace reporter, Frank Walklin.  And the New York Call, socialist daily, assigned a staff member, John Nicholas Betel, to cover the trial.  Thus Eastern readers were given a telegraphic report of the proceedings.  Not daring to send a representative into Montesano, the I.W.W. weekly in Chicago, New Solidarity, enterprisingly reprinted all of Betel's dispatches.  Meanwhile the Wobblies' weekly paper in Seattle, the Industrial Worker, <B>managed somehow</B> to obtain regular and comprehensive unsigned accounts of the trial.<br>
<br>
Montesano's atmosphere in those weeks was tense, and Walklin, Betel, Attorney Vanderveer, and three defense investigators found it prudent to go back each evening to a hotel in Aberdeen, 13 miles west, rather than to trust to the mercies of the Legionnaires who seemed to be everywhere in the county seat day and night.<br>
<br>
Walklin's reports were later republished in a pamphlet, A Fair Trial? - A Record of the Prejudice and Passion that Dominated the Legal Profession and the Press in the Famous Centralia Labor Case.  Walklin, a seasoned newspaperman from the East ivith no radical background, concluded:<br>
<br>
I found that nowhere else on earth is there such evidence of the methods of the abysmal brute as in Southwest Washington.  There are
hundreds of men there who are identified with the lumber interests in all capacities from wage slaves to managers, who understand nothing but brute force and money gained from the blood of others. ... I am convinced that nothing, not even arson, rape or murder, would deter these lumber barons if they thought it would bring their desired financial ends.<br>
<br>
He described judge Wilson as "perching above the courtroom like a black bat ready to spring over a ruined wall."<br>
<br>
On the night of March 12 the fate of the indicted men was given to the jury, the State having presented all of its evidence, and the defense that portion of testimony which the court would tolerate.  After 20 hours the jurors returned with a verdict finding Eugene Barnett, accused of firing the shot that killed Grimm, and John Lamb guilty of third-degree murder, a nonexistent crime in Washington State.<br>
<br>
They acquitted Elmer Smith and Sheehan, found that Loren Roberts was insane at the time of the shooting, and adjudged Britt Smith, the two Blands, Becker, and McInerney guilty of second-degree murder.  Faulkner had already been freed for lack of evidence at the end of the State's presentation.<br>
<br>
The verdict threw the courtroom into an uproar, judge Wilson being covered with confusion.  He had instructed the jury that only three verdicts were admissible, murder in the first or second degree, or acquittal.  The first degree charge covers premedi@tated murder; second degree, intentional but unpremeditated.  Vanderveer, in his closing address to the jury, had emphasized that only two verdicts were possible, first-degree murder or acquittal, as the charge against the men was premeditated murder.<br>
<br>
Recovering his composure presently, judge Wilson refused to accept the jury's findings, and sent it out again to reconsider.  Two hours later it returned, and now found Barnett and Lamb guilty, like the other five, of second-degree murder.  Ironically the court accepted that finding.<br>
<br>
To the new verdict the jury unanimously added this plea: "We the undersigned jurors respectfully petition the court to extend the leniency to the defendants whose names appear on the attached verdict" - referring to all who were found guilty.  The contradictions in the verdict reflected the mixed thoughts and emotions of the jurors.  Some wanted outright acquittal, others a first degree verdict.<br>
<br>
The attack by the Legionnaires on the hall influenced those favoring acquittal; the dispersion of the I.W.W. in hotels and on Seminary Hill seemed to others not to be a genuine defense of the hall.  The unanimous plea for mercy was wrung from these latter by those favorable to the defendants on the threat that otherwise they would "hang" the jury.
The rage that swept the ranks of the Legionnaires and the business press would have seemed to indicate that the I.W.W. had won a great victory.  Outright hanging had been demanded as the only possible penalty; refusal of the jury to give them the blood they demanded seemed grotesque.  The Legion declared the verdict to be "an impossible, monstrous miscarriage of justice."<br>
<br>
The jury was "incomprehensible." The state insisted that all the men would be tried anew, for the murder of McElfresh, and Elmer Smith and Sheehan were rearrested immediately upon their acquittal.  "The verdict," said the prosecutor, "is a travesty on justice.  We shall continue to prosecute these men until a proper conviction is procured."<br>
<br>
But all was not lost for those who lusted for blood.  On April 5 judge Wilson, who had presided with such cold fury during the trial, evened the scales <B>of justice to</B> his own satisfaction.  The jury's unanimous plea for mercy was tossed into the wastebasket.  Each I.W.W. was sentenced to the maximum, 25 to 40 years, the equivalent of a life sentence.  The law provides a minimum of ten years for second-degree murder and many legal experts contend that the Washington law did not permit more.<br>
<br>
No effort was ever made to prosecute the lynchers of Wesley Everest although their names were well known in Centralia.  The deadly contrast between freedom for the perpetrators of this peculiarly revolting crime, and the long imprisonment for the men who were d @efending their union hall, is too obvious to underline.  But there is no statute of limitations for murder, and who knows....<br>
<br>
The savage sentences imposed on the defendants were a lethal blow to the I.W.W. Even the Chicago defendants had been given maximum sentences of only 20 years, and most were much less.  All the Chicago defendants were freed by 1923.<br>
<br>
But the Centralia prisoners endured imprisonment in Walla Walla state penitentiary until 1933.  Five of the jurors in 1922 signed affidavits that the conduct of the trial had been unfair and that pertinent information had been withheld from the jury.  They would have stood out for acquittal, they swore, if they had known that their plea for leniency would be ignored.  Four other jurors agreed in part with the five but declined to sign affidavits, perhaps because of fear of economic reprisal.  The five jurors pleaded personally with the governor for a pardon.<br>
<br>
Walker C. Smith, the indefatigable Wobbly editor, lampooned the Montesano trial in a pamphlet, The Kangaroo Court of the State of Lumberlust.  The defendant, A. Wise Wobbly, was charged with comical syndicalism and ten thousand crimes in the Inferior Court of Sawdust County, judge Lynch presiding.  Proceeds of this pamphlet and of innumerable affairs held throughout the Puget Sound country went into the coffers of the Prison Comfort Club, which furnished tobacco and other small amenities to the Centralia prisoners.<br>

In response to an appeal by some church groups in the state, <B>the Federal</B> Council of Churches, the National Catholic Welfare Conference and the Central Conference of American Rabbis in 1930 conducted an investigation.  Their careful report ended on the note: "The six I.W.W.'s in Walla Walla Penitentiary are paying the penalty for their part in a tragedy the guilt for which is by no means theirs alone.  They alone were indicted; they alone have been punished."<br>
<br>
James McInerney died in prison in 1930.  Barnett became a fur rancher in Idaho, was an organizer for the CIO International Woodworkers Union (an old fighter in the I.W.W. Lumber Workers Industrial Union 500 must have had some qualms in joining the new CIO unionl) and was active in the Progressive Party in 1948 (another deviation from the Wobblies' resolute anti-political position).<br>
<br>
John Lamb, upon his release, returned to Centralia where "he continued," according to the Industrial Worker, "to work for the cause of human freedom by speaking up on every possible occasion for the I.W.W." He died in 1948 when his house burned down under mysterious circumstances, his family barely escaping with their lives.  Britt Smith returned to his work in the woods and joined the CIO Woodworkers Union; in his later years he was active in the Washington Pension Union, a radical until his death.<br>
<br>
Ray Becker, the indomitable one, scorned the parole offered in 1933, on the ground that he was not guilty, and remained in prison until 1939, when he won a complete pardon.  After his release Becker opened a small leather goods store in Vancouver and when he died in 1950 the Portland Oregonian, which had wished them all hanged in 1920, ran a quaintly nostalgic obituary.<br>
<br>
Elmer Smith, the lawyer, devoted the rest of his life to freeing the Centralia Seven.  Although after their acquittal the state reindicted him and Mike Sheehan for murder again, the fire had gone out of the Legion-lumber authorities, and the charge was never pressed.<br>
<br>
Young Smith, a red-headed six-footer of athletic physique, had come from Minnesota after graduation from McAlester College where he had prepared for the ministry, and the St. Paul College of Law. to practice in Centralia where <B>his father had gone</B>.  Soon he earned the enmity of the business interests by taking cases of workingmen defrauded of wages, or seeking compensation for accidents, or suffering violations of labor legislation.<br>
<br>
A girl on the Centralia Chronicle who had been working for $3 a week in violation of the minimum wage law went to him for help and he won her case.  After that the Chronicle took a dark view of the young lawyer.  One case in particular aroused his indignation - a worker with a large family who held he had been defrauded by a subsidiary
of Hubbard's Eastern Railway gc Lumber Company.<br>
<br>
A small daughter died of malnutrition during her father's unemployment and Smith charged that Hubbard's firm was responsible for her starvation.  A suit for libel and the threat of disbarment failed to deter him in that case.  When an out-of-town speaker came to a meeting at the Wobbly hall, a vigilante committee was in the audience.  Sensing the danger, Smith after the meeting sauntered to the railroad station with the speaker to see that he got out of town safely.<br>
<br>
Warren 0. Grimm warned Smith that he was playing with the wrong crowd.  "You'll get along all right if you will come in with us. How would you feel if one of your clients would come up to you in public, slap you on the back, and say, 'Hello, Elmer'?" "Very proud," replied Smith.<br>
<br>
He handled the case of Tom Lassiter, the blind news vendor.  Gathering affidavits concerning the men who kidnapped him, Smith went to the Lewis County prosecutor, but that worthy was too busy to concern himself with such petty matters.  The affidavits were taken to the Governor for action, and were duly filed away.<br>
<br>
"Handle these I.W.W. cases ff you want to," a brother lawyer told him, "but sooner or later they're all going to be hanged or deported anyway."<br>
<br>
After his imprisonment for three months awaiting trial, Smith was broke, his law office gone, and he was disbarred from practicing in state and local courts.  Grateful Centralia workers, among them many railroad men (for Centralia was a division point), chipped in to buy building materials and took part in erecting a small law office, where he worked with a partner who could practice.<br>
<br>
There was little prospect of affluence for such a man, and on the one chance, the disposal for $25,000 of a timber claim that he owned, all his family got was a piano, a set of dishes, and payment of back bills.  The rest went into the campaign for freeing the imprisoned I.W.W. and for cases of working people seeking redress of injustices.<br>
<br>
In the summer of 1920 Smith decided to  run for prosecuting attorney of Lewis County on the new Farmer-Labor Party ticket.  As no paper in the county would even carry news about the Party, Smith decided to start a weekly paper.<br>
<br>
In the backwoods town of Toledo, once important, before the coming
of the railroads, as the head of navigation on the Cowlitz River, he acquired the printing equipment of the defunct Toledo Messenger and moved it to Centralia for the new Farmer-Labor Call.  A quaint old editor was installed who distinguished himself in one issue by running a top headline -<br>
<br>
CAPITALISM THE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION.<br>
<br>
After that Smith consulted with Editor Ault of the Seattle Union Record and obtained the services of a young Record reporter.  Smith campaigned up and down Lewis County, basing his talks on the need for an honest enforcement of the law for farmers and workers.  In the election of November, 1920, Smith and the Farmer-Labor Party carried every rural precinct in Lewis County and lost only because of the adverse votes in Centralia and Chehalis, the business centers.<br>
<br>
By 1921 another Wobbly hall had been opened in Centralia, built by members on land donated by Elmer Smith.  Whether from consciousness of guilt or because they had an awesome respect now for the Wobblies' determination to defend themselves, the Legionnaires did not molest the hall, aside from occasional hooliganism.  For many years, tool hoodlums would heave rocks and bricks through the windows of Smith's home, often following up with gobs of mud.  But by 1927 the persecu tion had died down.<br>
<br>
Despite everything, he maintained an eventempered good nature: friends remember that "he never said a mean word." They can still see the tall, red-headed fellow, doing square dances like a big teddy bear in the Wobbly hall, graciously whirling little old miss Young, who picked him for every square she could.<br>
<br>
In 1929, when the Centralia prisoners became eligible for parole, he and Captain Edward P. Coll, a Legionnaire, arranged a meeting attended by 1,200 townspeople in the Labor Temple to petition the governor for release of the seven men.  Captain Coll had been Commander of the American Legion in Hoquiam, Washington, and had made several visits to Centralia to get the facts for a fair history of the case.  He stated, "Breaking into the workers'hall was a felony, and he who perpetrates a felony and in so doing causes others to lose their lives is also guilty of murder."<br>
<br>
Smith died in 1932 of a hemorrhaging ulcer, at the age of 46, at the Puyallup "sanitarium" run by a man who years later was imprisoned for practicing medicine without a license.  His memory is still green in Centralia and among friends scattered to the four winds - memory of an incorruptible, able, friendly man who dedicated his life to his principles.<br>
<br>
True to its principles, too, in a way, was the Centralia Chronicle,
which did not even carry a notice of the death of one of the city's most notable residents.  Ironically, the day he died, Elmer Smith's disbarment was rescinded.<br>
<br>
On Memorial and Armistice Days school children are still herded to City Park where a monument to the four Legionnaires bears the legend: "Slain on the streets of Centralia, Washington, while on peaceful parade wearing the uniform of the country they loyally and faithfully served."<br>
<br>
There is no corresponding monument for Wesley Everest who also, according to his lights, served his country and his fellow workers loyally and faithfully, overseas and in Centralia.  The last memorial services held for Everest were conducted in 1939 at the bridge where he was hanged.<br>
<br>
The Washington Commonwealth Federation, successor of earlier radical and progressive movements, joined with the CIO International Woodworkers Union in sponsoring the memorial meeting, attended by hundreds of union people.<br>

<br>
By 1918 the lumber interests were thoroughly embittered against the I.W.W.s, who had been more intent on their battle than on the war. Their strike in 1917 had crippled the industry at a time when the production of lumber was both patriotic and profitable, and now there was strong government pressure for granting the eight -
hour day.<br>
<br>
In Centralia, at the southern end of the Puget Sound basin, the bitterness came to a head with a Memorial Day parade led by the Governor and the Chief of Police, and including a National Guard Company with a contingent of civilians.  The parade was routed along Main Street, but before disbanding it turned into a side street that brought it near the I.W.W. hall, an isolated frame building with an outside stairway and a false front.<br>
<br>
As the end of the parade came abreast of it the citizens broke
ranks and stormed the hall.  Windows and doors were smashed, and boards were torn off.  Inside, the rioters tore down partitions and carried the furnishings and records to the street, where they made a bonfire of them.  Two items escaped destruction-a phonograph, which was auctioned on the spot for the Red Cross, and a roll-top desk, which was appropriated by a lumberman.<br>
<br>
The I.W.W. members who had been surprised in the hall were beaten and threatened with hanging, and they were lifted onto trucks by their ears and feet.  Those who were not taken to jail were dumped across the county line and warned not to return.<br>
<br>
The wrecked building was never again occupied by anyone; but about a year later the I.W.W.s secured another hall a block away.  The second hall was opened in a more ominous atmosphere than the first.  The World War had ended suddenly, leaving an unexpended wave of patriotism that had to break on some shore.  Part of it was channeled into the American Legion.  In lumber towns the lumbermen helped finance the Legion posts, and it was natural therefore that Legion<B>naires side with</B> their benefactors, who saw the conflict with the I.W.W. as a continuation of the war.<br>
<br>
In Centralia business and Legion sentiment was strong against the Wobblies, and a proposed Armistice Day parade was looked on by many as a show of strength against them.  To the I.W.W.s another parade meant another attack; their belief was strengthened by the formation of a citizens' committee to combat I.W.W. activities in Centralia and the surrounding country.  Their belief that their hall was to be raided was strong enough for them to ask for protection, which the Chief of Police could not guarantee.  Their secretary then prepared a leaflet which was distributed through the town:<br>
<br>
TO THE CITIZENS OF CENTRALIA WE MUST APPEAL:<br>
<br>
To the law-abiding citizens of Centralia and to the working citizens in general; we beg of you to read and carefully consider the following:<br>
<br>
The profiteering class of Centralia have of late been waving the flag of our country in an endeavor to incite the lawless element of our city to raid our hail and club us out of town.... These profiteers are holding numerous secret meetings to that end, and covertly inviting returned service men to do their bidding.  In this work they are ably assisted by the bankrupt lumber barons of southwest Washington who led the mob that looted and burned the I.W.W. hall a year ago....<br>
<br>
Tension was heightened by the published details of the parade. 
The line of march was directly past the I.W.W. hall on Tower Avenue, and it ended at Third Street, less than a block away.  It would stop with paraders in front of the hall.<br>
<br>
The Sunday before the parade the I.W.W.s held a public meeting which was attended by some working men and women who did not belong to the organization.  The expected raid was discussed and Secretary Britt Smith reported on his attempt to secure police protection; but nothing tangible was accomplished.<br>
<br>
On November 10 Elmer Smith, a young lawyer who championed underdogs, told the Wobblies that nothing could stop the raid on their hall.  "Defend it if you choose," he told them; "the law gives you the right."<br>
<br>
The hall was already being guarded; loggers from nearby camps, armed with rifles, were watching the place night and day.<br>
<br>
Armistice Day was dismal.  The parade assembled at City Park in raw gray mist.  The procession was led by Lieutenant Warren Grimm, Commander of the Centralia Legion Post, at the head of a company of legionnaires in uniform, followed by local businessmen, two of whom carried coils of rope.  After them came a few sailors and marines, and a large body of Elks.<br>
<br>
The I.W.W.s had anticipated that the procession would carry a sting in its tail-a party of raiders who would drop out and attack them when the rest of the parade had passed the hall.  But the rear was brought up by Boy Scouts and automobiles filled with pretty girls in Red Cross uniforms.<br>
<br>
In the cold, gloomy day and tense atmosphere it was an almost silent parade through an almost silent town.  From their hall in the little Roderick Hotel building seven Wobblies watched the Centralia Legionnaires march by; then the Centralia businessmen, two of them with coils of rope that suggested a lynching bee; then the Chehalis division; and at the end of the procession Boy Scouts and Red Cross girls instead of the expected raiders.<br>
<br>
A shouted order was passed along the the and the procession stopped at Third Street.  On a second order everyone did an about-face, and the procession marched by again, in reverse, with the Centralia division last in the.  The rest of the parade continued up Tower Avenue, but the Centralia marchers halted in front of the I.W.W. hall.<br>
<br>

According to some witnesses, the shooting started while the marchers were standing in the street; according to others, it happened after they had rushed the building.  One of the marchers, Dr. Frank Bickford of the A.E.F., testified that there were calls for a raid on the hall:<br>
<br>
"I spoke up and said I would lead if enough would follow, but before I could take the lead there were many ahead of me. Someone next to me put his foot against the door and forced it open, after which a shower of bullets poured through the opening about us."<br>
<br>
Spectators and paraders heard the crash of glass, the splintering of wood, and the burst of revolver fire from inside the hall.  There followed a deadly cracking of rifles from farther away.<br>
<br>
Legionnaires outside the hall winced and stumbled.  Two men carrying a limp body in uniform dropped their burden in the gutter and joined the onlookers in a scurry for cover.  A big young man in officer's uniform staggered away doubled over, holding his abdomen.<br>
<br>
Six of the I.W.W.s inside the hall ran to the rear of the building; it was already surrounded and they took refuge in a large disused icebox.  The seventh man was Wesley Everest, a logger who had been shooting from the inside.  He still had his automatic pistol and a pocket of ammunition, and he ran out of the back door and through the crowd.<br>
<br>
Everest, too, was a veteran; he was wearing his army tunic over his striped overalls and he was momentarily accepted as one of the attackers.  He was scrambling over the board fence at the rear when somebody mistakenly recognized him as Britt Smith, the union secretary.<br>
<br>
The crowd surged in pursuit, flattening the board fence with their weight and revealing Everest running down the alley.  They slowed momentarily, as he turned and fired. Bullets zipped around them, but no one was hit, and the chase went on, the young logger  reloading his pistol as he ran.  He fired again, then ducked through a gateway and ran between two houses to the open street.  Some of the pursuers fired their rifles, but no one on either side was hit.<br>
<br>
The running fight led to the Chehalis River, where Everest waded powerfully out into the cold gray stream-then stopped as if he had changed his mind and turned back to shore.  He stood there dripping and hatless, with the river at his back, waiting for his pursuers.<br>
<br>
He met them with a half-quizzical smile, holding the pistol at his hip.<br>
<br>
"Stand back" he called.  "If any of you are bulls, I'll let you
arrest me; otherwise lay off me."<br>
<br>
They answered by rushing him and he fired four times from the hip, again without hitting anyone.  His pistol jammed, but he managed to free it, raised it with both hands, and took careful aim.  One soldier continued to come on.  As he charged, Everest shot him twice; but he continued his rush until two more bullets dropped him at the young logger's feet.<br>
<br>
Everest threw his empty pistol into the river and the crowd was upon him.  His teeth were smashed by a rifle barrel jammed into his mouth, and his face was battered beyond recognition.  When a rope was put around his neck, Everest said through his broken mouth, "You haven't got guts enough to lynch a man in daylight."<br>
<br>
He was taken to the city jail, half conscious, and thrown into the bug pen.  In the surrounding cells were the I.W.W.s who had remained in the hall.<br>
<br>
That night the jail lights were turned off; as if in answer to a signal, every light in town went out.  Under cover of total darkness Wesley Everest was taken from the jail to one of three waiting automobiles.<br>
<br>
When the cars were on their way, the lights <B> came</B> on again.<br>
<br>
On-the way out of town a Centralia businessman castrated Everest with a razor.  At the Chehalis River, while two cars blocked the approaches, Wesley Everest was hanged from the bridge and his body riddled with bullets.  Later someone cut the rope and dropped the body into the river.  Still later it was retrieved by the forces of law and order and buried secretly.<br>
<br>
In a bad day's work at Centralia, four young veterans died in a celebration of the peace they helped to win, and several were wounded.  One of the dead was Warren 0. Grimm, prominent young aristocrat of the town, who had been made commander of the Legion post a few days before.  Grimm was a big, personable young man, a lawyer, a famous college athlete, and a social lion.  He had served with the American forces in Siberia and believed passionately that in taking sides against the I.W.W. he was fighting the American Bolsheviki.<br>
<br>
Another of the dead, killed by revolver fire near the door of the ball, was Arthur McElfresh, a handsome and well liked Centralia druggist.  McElfresh's wife, having a premonition of disaster, had begged him not to take part in the parade.<br>
     
Another was Dale Hubbard, the fearless young man who had charged into the fire of Everest's pistol while others held back.  Dale was a nephew of F. B. Hubbard, head of the Eastern Railway and Lumber Company, owners and operators of large tracts of land, sawmills, and mines, and a railroad.  In Centralia the elder Hubbard was the leading spirit in the fight against the I.W.W. The nephew came home from war to embrace his uncle's cause, and died in one of its more hazardous operations.<br>
<br>
The fourth veteran was Wesley Everest, of pioneer Washington stock, who returned to defend the I.W.W. hall and himself with his army pistol.<br>
<br>
The state of Washington reacted swiftly to the news that came out of Centralia: Members of the American Legion on Parade shot down without warning by I.W.W.s lying in ambush.  A thousand men and women were arrested in a statewide roundup; all I.W.W. halls were closed; and labor papers were suppressed.<br>
<br>
One of them, the moderate Seattle Union Record, had its stock confiscated for suggesting that there might have been provocation for the shooting.  The conservative press carried one story more daring than the Records.  From Centralia an Associated Press correspondent reported Dr. Bickford's account of the attack on the hall before the shooting; he was not given time to collect his suitcase and typewriter before leaving town.<br>
<br>
Ten men were tried for the murder of Legionnaire Warren Grimm: four who had been found in the hall; five accused of shooting from the Avalon Hotel across the street and from Seminary Hill; and Elmer Smith, the young lawyer who told the others they had a right to defend their hall.<br>
<br>
The defense attorney, George Vanderveer, secured a change of venue to Montesano in Grays Harbor County.  Before long so much hostility developed that he applied for a second change, but it was denied.  During the trial Vanderveer and the defense witnesses were refused accommodations in Montesano; they were obliged to stay in Aberdeen, sixteen miles away, and commute to court by auto stage.<br>
<br>
A feature of the trial was the fact that several hundred members of the American Legion were financed and brought from various posts in the state to Montesano.  A contingent of fifty, in uniform, was in the courtroom at all times in the earlier days of the trial, some of them inside the railing in the space reserved for the principals.<br>
<br>
After repeated protests <B>from the defense</B> they were ordered to sit
with the spectators.  Later the number of Legionnaires dwindled; many who went home early expressed the conviction that they had been brought there under false pretenses to influence the jury.<br>
<br>
Another feature was the appearance of a company of regular-army soldiers, who pitched their tents on the courthouse lawn and drilled within sound of the courtroom.  The soldiers had been sent at the request of the prosecution, who had not consulted Judge Wilson.  The judge protested at first and declared there was no need for the soldiers; but they stayed, and the trial went on in the atmosphere of a military tribunal.<br>
<br>
A curious twist in the trial was the fact that judge Wilson barred the introduction of any evidence regarding the first raid on the I.W.W. hall or the plans for the second raid.  The had to make its decision on the prosecution's picture of jury men  who  had  never  been molested shooting down passers-by with whom they had no quarrel, and the defense's crippled case which made it appear that a spontaneous demonstration at the door of the hall had been met with revolver fire from inside and rifle bullets from nearby buildings and from Seminary Hill.<br>
<br>
Both sides agreed that I.W.W. riflemen had fired into a street filled with holiday crowds, and that fact weighed heavily against the defense.<br>
<br>
Seven of the defendants were found guilty of second degree murder; two, including Secretary Smith, innocent; and one, Loren Roberts, insane.  Roberts, a nineteen-year-old logger, had broken under the third degree given the jail prisoners on the night of Everest's lynching.<br>
<br>
The jury recommended mercy for the convicted men.  Judge Wilson sentenced them all to twenty-five to forty years in the penitentiary.<br>
<br>
When the wave of hysteria passed, scattered I.W.W. halls reopened and the faithful put up the picture of a new martyr -the homely likeness of Wesley Everest in army blouse and campaign hat.  The faithful did the kind of thing they had done before with stirring results-and nothing happened.  It took several years for the truth to sink in: the I.W.W.s were through.<br>

1919, Year of Trouble<br>
<br>
John McClelland, Jr.  Wobbly War: The Centralia Story.  Tacoma, Wa.: Washington State Historical Society.  1987., p.54-8.<br>
<br>
The first six months of 1919 were not good ones in the Northwest lumber industry, employing nearly 150,000 men.  Mills reported an average loss of fifty-five cents per thousand board feet.  Then in July the market improved and operators looked forward to recouping their first-half losses in the final two quarters.  At this point the IWW made another move.  Its Lumberworkers International Union called strikes.  The operators were furious.<br>
<br>
They had given in on the eight-hour day, fixed up the camps, and raised wages.  Now the radicals were at it again with new demands in addition to old ones.<br>
<br>
The Wobblies had always disdained political action, but they changed after the Russian revolution, and when their top leaders went to prison under sedition convictions they began using the strike as a weapon to back demands that the U.S. immediately withdraw its troops from Russia and release those who had come to be called "class-war prisoners." While pursuing these objectives the Wobblies did not overlook their own wants, which now included a minimum wage of five dollars a day; a maximum charge of one dollar a day for board; free blankets, sheets, and pillows; bathhouse wash and dry rooms; right of free speech, press, and assembly; and hiring to be done on the job rather than through job sharks.<br>
<br>
"The lumber industry is prosperous just at present," the Chronicle commented in November, "and more men are employed at higher wages than ever before.  If the radicals ... cause a disturbance among the lumber workers, they will greatly damage many lines of industry in the West and thousands of people will be out of work."<br>
<br>
Oregon loggers, drifting home after being lured north by higher wage scales in Washington, reported that nearly every logging camp in the state was working under IWW conditions.  They said, "One never<br>
knows whether he will work an hour or half a day or all day when he commences in the morning for the Wobblies are constantly stirring up trouble and walkouts are common.... Even the foremen of the camps are obliged to join the IWW." At several places where these Oregon men were employed while in Washington they saw IWW members tear emblems from the clothing of 4-L members and "throw them in the dust." They said nobody dares resist such usage "for the Wobblies are in the ascendency."<br>
<br>
L. H. May, an official of the McKenna Lumber Company near Olympia, verified this conclusion.  He said a majority of the men working in the logging camps of Washington were members of the IWW.<br>
<br>
Such reports of increased Wobbly activity alarmed not only employers
but those concerned with patriotism, notably the American Legion and the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks.<br>
<br>
The Elks lodge maintained a spacious hall on the top floor of the largest building in downtown Centralia.  In the basement was the Chronicle plant.  On the second and third floors were offices,      including those of C. D. Cunningham.  The Elks hall was the convenient meeting place downtown for the lodge's membership, which included most of those who were part of the business establishment.  To be an Elk in a city the size of Centralia was to be accepted.  It was the largest organization in town and provided a kind of male bastion where men who were friends could gather from noon on, with the bar open and the pool and card tables always available, and, on meeting nights, assemble in a big hall with massive elk heads staring down from the walls to go through a ritual in which patriotism was a dominant theme.  A stone fireplace in the entry hall at the top of the stairs provided a welcoming fire on winter nights.<br>
<br>
The Centralia lodge sometimes initiated as many as fifty-four at a time, as it did on July 12, 1919.  The occasion was important enough to bring Governor Louis Hart down from Olympia to take part in the ceremonies.  He too was an Elk.<br>
<br>
"There is no more patriotic order than the BPOE," proclaimed the Chronicle on November 7, quoting from a resolution passed by the Grand Lodge at its recent convention.  "Whereas the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks is distinctly American," it began...... it condemns all things and all persons that are in any degree or any manner opposed thereto...... The resolution proclaimed implacable hostility toward all forms of dangers and doctrines that threatened free institutions and the flag, including Bolsheviki, anarchists, and, of course, the IWW.<br>
<br>
Reports concerning the IWW, carried on the news wires, in general were of two kinds.  One brought the disturbing news that the radical union seemed to be in the ascendance again, gaining members and making trouble in the woods.  Other reports told of actions being taken to combat the menace.<br>
<br>
An IWW organizer was seized in his hotel room in Baker, Oregon, taken to the edge of town, beaten, and threatened with death if he returned.<br>
<br>
In Everett the IWW requested permission to hold a parade on October 6 to generate public support for the campaign to release class-war prisoners.  The sheriff and the mayor conferred, denied the request, then wrote Governor Hart asking him to send Company M of Centralia back to Everett because "it is feared that an attempt may be made to hold the parade regardless of the denial, and from the apparent public sentiment of the city it is feared that great disorder and riot may result from an attempt to hold such a parade." Hart did not see fit to comply and the Centralia men were spared another tour of
anti-Wobbly duty in Everett.  Nor did the Wobblies attempt to hold the parade.<br>
<br>
The most prominent class-war prisoner of the day was Thomas Mooney, convicted in San Francisco of throwing a bomb into a 1916 parade.  Wanting to show their concern for him and others of their kind being held in various prisons, the Wobblies called for all workers to strike for a day on October 6. Many did, but none of the mills in Centralia was shut down.<br>
<br>
The state Legion convention in 1919 requested every local post to offer its services to law enforcement authorities "for the suppression of disorders and riots or anything threatening the constitutional form of government." The post in Montesano, Centralia's near neighbor in Grays Harbor County, responded eagerly to this call to duty with a ringing offer of volunteerism which said, "Whereas there is a feeling of unrest in the country at large and especially in this county on account of the enormous amount of IWW... literature ... being circulated, and whereas our services may be needed at any time ... to uphold that for which we as an order stand - Americanism - now therefore. . . ." The resolution went on to offer the Legion's services as might be required for the "sup-
pression of sedition, to quell riots, or to be used in any way for the servants of good government." Sheriff Jeff Bartell shared the Legion's belief that the Wobblies were capable of terroristic activity in Grays Harbor County serious enough to require men under arms to preserve order, and said he was ready to swear in the entire Legion post as special deputy sheriffs as soon as the Legion's membership drive was completed.<br>
<br>
Such willingness to help in suppressing Wobblies told the public that trouble probably could be expected and that the local men who had gone off to fight a foreign enemy now stood ready to fight the enemy at home.  Antiradical activities became so numerous that the Associated Press occasionally grouped reports of them in a "roundup." One in early November told of recent raids in New York, Detroit, Trenton, and Bridgeport, Connecticut.  In New York alone, the report said, seventy-one raids had been conducted and five hundred prisoners taken.<br>
<br>
The Seattle Union Record, although a conservative paper compared to the Industrial Worker, still could not countenance what was going on.  Its critical comments included enough references to Centralia to bring about what frequently resulted when local indignations were aroused - a meeting.  Twenty-five local businessmen met and agreed to boycott the paper.  What little advertising the Record was getting in Centralia would be reduced to nothing.<br>
<br>
The few liberal labor and political leaders in the solidly Republican state - but no Wobblies - had a chance to plead their case at a high level in mid-September when President Woodrow Wilson, a democrat, came west seeking public support for the League of Nations, which Congress would not support.  A committee representing the Seattle Central Labor Council, the State Federation of Labor,
and the Triple Alliance met with the president on a Sunday afternoon and presented a memorandum which included this:<br>
<br>
That there is a fundamental unrest among the workers of the United States is admitted by you, Mr. President .... The purpose of this meeting, as you admit, is to try to reach some conclusions as to a remedy for this unrest.... Suppression and the methods employed under the emergency war measures, coupled with the inhuman and brutal treatment of those convicted and imprisoned ... is a cause of the extreme bitterness expressed by the workers in their demonstration of unrest.<br>
<br>
The delegation told the president that many workers had been thrown into prison when their only offense was insistence on rights guaranteed them by the Constitution.  The memorandum charged:<br>
<br>
During the war, the lumbermen of this state, in our nation's hour of need, attempted to raise the price of spruce from $40 to nearly $200 a thousand feet.  They defied the President, the National Council of Defense, the State Council of Defense, the governor of the state, the public sentiment throughout the whole nation in their attitude upon the basic eight-hour work day and this very materially and effectively prevented the utmost efficiency in the war.  We ask how long it will be before you, Mr. President, will use the power invested in you to grant amnesty to political prisoners ....<br>
<br>
The union men asked the president why the government was prosecuting "political prisoners" while failing to prosecute war profiteers.  Wilson's responses to the group were not reported, since the meeting was closed, but news accounts did say he appealed for peaceable resolutions of labor's problems in the Northwest after hearing that a nationwide general strike in sympathy for the imprisoned Thomas Mooney was being planned.<br>
<br>
By the end of summer, 1919, fifteen months had gone by since Centralia businessmen raided and demolished the local IWW hall on First Street.  That raid turned out to be a successful repression.  The focal point of IWW activities in Lewis County was eliminated and the members were scattered.  It did not mean that there were fewer Wobblies in the area, only that they were not in evidence.  They had no hall.<br>
<br>
The new syndicalism law made it risky to hold open meetings, although going to jail was no disgrace for a Wobbly, and those who had been around for a while were used to being taunted, cursed, and even beaten.  They felt nothing was to be gained by deliberately inviting more repressive actions.<br>
<br>
Because of its industries and location, Centralia was something of a labor center in 1919.  Seventeen unions made up the Central Trades Council, which had an estimated three thousand members.  The Council felt sufficiently prosperous to announce in July that a thirty-thousand-dollar Labor Temple would be built.<br>

The Chronicle, though antiunion editorially, saw fit to launch a weekly labor page which even carried news of a labor convention in Great Falls, Montana, attended by IWW delegates, where demands were made for withdrawal of troops from Russia and for recognition of the Soviet government.  This convention was described as the launching of the "one big union" movement in America.<br>
<br>
The Wobblies felt that they should not be pariahs indefinitely in a town otherwise so hospitable to organized labor.  The other unions were building a temple.  Perhaps the time had come when they could have a hall.  The local Wobblies, the ones in Lewis County, were particularly eager to try again to establish a headquarters.  They were not homeless wanderers like so many of the old bindle stiffs.  Many were men who were born in the county, grew up admiring strong men who wore caulked boots, and took to the woods themselves in their teens, not aware that the camp conditions were poor, the pay low, and the bosses all tyrants until they read the IWW literature and listened to the older men, adept at complaining, tell about the<br>
bright future for workers when their day would come.<br>
<br>
One of these was Britt Smith, born in Bucoda, a sawmill village beside the Northern Pacific tracks a few miles from Centralia.  A round-faced, auburn-haired man of medium height, described in records of the law later as "sober, honest and reasonably industrious," he became a convert to radical theories and grew more radical as time went on.  After two decades in the woods, living as loggers had to live, he was ready for the reforms that only the IWW was struggling for.  He told Anna Louise Strong, gathering material as "Anise" for her blank verse sketches in the Seattle Union Record, "I have slept weeks at a time in wet clothes, working all day in the rain without anyplace to dry out.  I have washed my clothes by tying them to a stake in the river, letting the current beat them partly clean.  It was often the only place we had for washing."<br>
<br>
Britt Smith, single and a firebrand Wobbly, was a logical selection as the local leader.  He was named secretary and put in charge of organizing, collecting dues, and, very important, opening a hall that could be kept open, if that were possible.  Smith was aware that employer hostility had not subsided.  He read the newspaper reports about the Chamber of Commerce meeting on June 28 when, at the urging of George F. Russell, secretary of the Employers Association of Washington, F. W. Hubbard was authorized to form a local organization to deal with the radical labor element.  But nothing more appeared in the paper about this move during the summer and in late August Smith set out to find space he could rent for a hall.  It could not be in the main business district, of course, but should be near the railroad tracks, handy for traveling fellow workers.  It needed to be large enough for sizable meetings and to provide the secretary with living quarters.  Also the rent had to be cheap.<br>
<br>
Far out North Tower were a cluster of the kind of hotels to be found near the railroad in most Western towns - two stories, false fronts, flush up against the sidewalk, with sleeping rooms just large enough
for a bed, washstand, and chair.  Loggers, making as much as three dollars a day, were among the main patrons of such hotels when they came to town on weekends or were between jobs because they had walked off or been fired.  On North Tower were the Avalon, the Arnold, the Michigan House, and the Roderick, all close together near the corner of Tower and Second.  The Roderick had a canopy extending over the sidewalk at the second-floor level, supported by turned posts.  The hotel was fifty feet wide and had store space on the ground floor to rent.  It consisted of a space sixteen feet wide and seventy feet deep, running from the sidewalk to the alley.<br>
<br>
The Roderick was owned by Mr. and Mrs. James McAllister but operated by Mrs. McAllister, a strongminded woman whose judgment her compliant husband did not question, and who had enough loggers among her patrons to have heard the Wobbly story frequently.  She was sympathetic enough to take a chance and rented the vacant space in her building to Britt Smith on September 1. He moved in promptly.<br>
<br>
A partition divided the long room about equally.  The front thirty-five feet was the hall.  The back part was Smith's living quarters.  The hall was furnished with several benches and chairs, a table, a rolltop desk, and some bookshelves.  It was heated by a stove.  The space was intended for use as a shop and had tall display windows in the front and a double door recessed two feet.  Well established in his new headquarters, Smith implanted a large IWW sign in the window and hoped for the best.  This time, on the third attempt, a Wobbly hall in Centralia might survive.<br>
<br>
September 1 was Labor Day in 1919 and the numerous AFL unions, eager for a show of strength, made the most of it.  They staged what the press described as the "biggest parade ever held in Centralia." The teamsters, timber workers, coal miners, barbers, printers, carpenters, retail clerks, and railroad brotherhoods - but not the IWW - marched amid floats and bands.  "It was Labor's Day," said the papers, "and Labor once more put Centralia on the map as a city of hospitality." Britt Smith could see some fellow workers marching in the parade.  Some Wobblies were not above carrying two union cards.<br>
<br>
Warren Grimm was considered an authority on the Russian revolution after his year of service in Siberia and was invited to make the Labor Day speech.  He described what the Bolsheviks were doing in the Soviet Union and warned that America should be on guard against a similar threat from within - the Industrial Workers of the World.<br>
<br>
Several days later when Elmer Smith went to Grimm's office on legal business, Grimm asked him what he thought of his speech.  Smith replied that he thought it was "rotten" and did not agree with Grimm's antiunion utterances or his comparison of the IWW with the Bolsheviks.  Smith reminded Grimm of the way Tom Lassiter had been handled, saying it was an example of the kind of "Americanism" he considered disgraceful.  Grimm disagreed and defended the treatment given Lassiter.<br>
<br>
Two days after the Labor Day festivities the Chronicle took note of
what had taken place on North Tower.  On its front page appeared this:<br>
<br>
WOBBLIES RENT LOCAL BUILDING<br>
Indications are that Centralia will again be headquarters for the Industrial Workers of the World who have secured a structure on North Tower as a meeting place.<br>
<br>
The Chronicle went on to report, it being nothing for the city to be ashamed of, what had happened to the last IWW headquarters on First Street: "It was raided by citizens two years ago, the furnishings being piled in the street and burned."<br>
<br>
In the next few weeks not much was said openly about the opening of the hall, much as it was taken to be an affront to a city that had made it completely clear on previous occasions that the IWW would not be tolerated in Centralia.  Britt Smith and the other local Wobblies felt encouraged.<br>

Vance Noel, the only professional newsman on the staff of the Centralia Chronicle, was out of town on November 11.  He went east on a family matter a few days earlier, remarking that he wasn't worried about news coverage while he was gone because nothing much ever happened in Centralia.  When something did happen, it was up to Harry Bras, publisher, and Ray Edinger, his son-in-law, to write the news that suddenly focused the whole nation's attention on Centralia.  Edinger was the Chronicle's business manager.  The headlines on the story screamed the news and the city's outrage:<br>
<br>
McELFRESH, GRIMM AND CASAGRANDA<br>
KILLED BY THE IWW<br>
<br>
FIVE MORE WOUNDED<br>
<br>
SOLDIERS WHO DEFENDED OUR COUNTRY<br>
SHOT DOWN ON THE STREETS BY IWW<br>
AS THEY MARCHED DOWN TOWER AVENUE -<br>
BOYS HAD NO CHANCE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.<br>
TOWN COWERS BEFORE SKUNKS.<br>
<br>
The news story carried an ominous warning: "At the time of going to press the jail is surrounded by soldiers and citizens and if the IWWs contained therein are not hanged, they will be fortunate."<br>
<br>
Bras and Edinger may not have been qualified reporters but their
hastily written account summed up the situation accurately.  Mayor Rogers and Police Chief Hughes sensed trouble.  The crowd downtown and around the jail, growing rapidly as news of what happened spread, obviously was now a mob bent on vengeance.  The clamor and excitement heightened when word came from the hospital that Hubbard had died and that Watt might not live through the night.  That would make five killed.  The sense of grief over the fallen, mingled with anger at the Wobblies and fear about what might happen next, put Centralia into a severe state of shock accentuated by feelings of sheer terror.  Men went home for their guns and to tell their families to stay off the streets.  When James Eubanks, friend of the Elmer Smith family and father of Bernard, who was one of the wounded, heard that Elmer was in jail, he went to the Smith home and, without alarming Mrs. Smith by saying she might be in danger, unobtrusively stood guard through the night.<br>
<br>
The response was immediate when a call was issued for fifty men to meet at the Elks Club in ten minutes to organize for whatever might need to be done.  In less than ten minutes, several hundred men swarmed up the stairs at the Elks Club, eager to be sworn in as deputies.<br>
<br>
The prospect of mob action was enough to convince Rogers and Hughes they should summon help.  Centralia needed the National Guard.  A call was made to the Adjutant General at five-thirty, just as daylight was fading on Centralia's streets.<br>
<br>
The irony of this was little noticed - outside guardsmen being called to guard jailed Wobblies in Centralia, the home of Company M, rather than Centralia Guardsmen being sent out as in past years to keep Wobblies under control elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Company F of the Third Washington Infantry in Tacoma moved as fast as it could in response to the emergency.  A train, hastily put together at the Union depot, was ready to depart as soon as forty men, each with full field equipment and one hundred rounds of ammunition, reported in.  Guardsmen in Tacoma were summoned to duty by telephone and taxis were sent to the homes of those needing transportation.  Captain Thomas L. Shurtleff was placed in command of a company of two officers and thirty-five enlisted men.  Their train left for Centralia at 10:25 p.m., too late to prevent what the mayor feared might happen.<br>
<br>
The long-dormant spirit of vigilantism was fully revived as night fell in Centralia.  It demanded that something be done.  The vicious killers should have a taste of viciousness themselves.  Plans were laid.  Word of them got around.  Kate Robinson, secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, confided them to her friend Hollis Fultz, manager of the Olympia Chamber and a writer of "true detective" stories.  He had raced to Centralia in a taxi when he heard about the shootings.  Robinson told him to be on hand at the jail at seven o'clock "because the lights are going out and something will happen."<br>

Fultz was there.  He saw several cars drive up with their lights out and park near the jail.  Other motorists who turned into Pearl Street were warned to turn their lights off, and when one did not, the headlamps on the car were smashed.<br>
<br>
Night patrolman Robert Jackson was on duty in the jail where Everest, Britt Smith, and the other Wobblies were held in two rows of small barred cells on either side of a central corridor.<br>
<br>
Suddenly all the lights in the city went out.  Someone pulled a main switch in the power distribution building adjacent to the jail.  A Seattle newspaper report the next day said the vigilantes gained entrance to the jail by kicking out a panel in the wood door and reaching in to turn the key.  Men entered and demanded that Jackson give them keys to the cells.<br>
<br>
Fultz heard loud voices inside the jail and then a sound "like someone hitting a pumpkin with a ball bat." He saw one man half-carried, half-dragged out the jail door and shoved into the backseat of a car.  The man was Wesley Everest.<br>
<br>
From the crowd around the jail, estimated by reporters the next day at two thousand, came shouts of encouragement: "Lynch 'em!" The car carrying Everest, followed by several others, took off through the dark streets headed westward.  Many others, curious about an awful event they knew was about to happen, followed also, Fultz among them.  The death squad for Everest drove to the bridge over the Chehalis River at the western edge of town.<br>
<br>
Bob Burrows, a farmer who lived near the bridge, provided the best eyewitness account, reporting, "The man was struggling between the men who held him.  They worked without a word.  I saw them stop not far from the end of the bridge near the city and throw a rope over the cross beam.  The body went over with a thud and then a shot was fired.  Then more shots.  I stood a distance away while perhaps twenty shots in all were fired close to the body." Burrows said that one bullet went through the wobbly's neck "close to where the noose had torn a gaping hole in the flesh." He said the lynchers went to their cars silently and drove away.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, many of those who came to watch hurried back to the jail to see if any more were going to be seized and hanged.  They found the crowds still excited, still milling about.  "All night long the crowd wove back and forth in the Centralia streets," the Tacoma News-Tribune reported the next day,<br>
<br>
swarming like bees about the entrance to the jail.  They were rough men, angry, scornful men whose pockets bulged menacingly with the weapons they made small effort to conceal.  There were many in uniform in that throng, both of blue and olive drab, and they were set, determined young faces with the light of battle in their eyes.  Their buddies had been shot down by scoundrels worse than Boches and their hearts called for vengeance.  Women, too, were among them ... some with lips set and eyes flaming.
"Lynch them, lynch them!" urged one petticoated firebrand as she pled with passionate zeal with man after man in her mad effort to incite the mob to frenzied action.  "Are you cowards? Would you let them shoot you down like dogs?" she shouted while under her whiplash tongue men straightened their shoulders, growled savagely, and promised her the vengeance she demanded.<br>
<br>
The mob around the jail was startled when photographers from a Tacoma newspaper took two flash pictures of the scene from the porch of the James Churchill residence across the street from the jail.  The exploding flash powder sounded like bombs.  No relieved humor was expressed when the cause of the noise was discovered.  Instead the camera was jerked away from the photographer and his plates taken out and smashed.<br>
<br>
Photographic records of Armistice Day in Centralia never turned up, although stories and legends about them are numerous.  Pathe News was reported to have made a newsreel, but it was never seen.  Assistant Attorney General Saunders in Seattle received a letter five days after the shootings from an Archie Henderson who said he stood across the street from the IWW hall and took a picture showing the men from the parade running toward the hall with its door still shut and the window intact.  Later, he said, he was searched by soldiers at the depot and his camera confiscated but he was able to keep the film pack.  He submitted the pictures to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer he wrote, but they were not published.  The letter was strongly pro-Wobbly in tone.<br>
<br>
The first assignment taken on by the posse hastily organized at the Elks Club was to comb the city for more Wobblies who were involved in the violence, looking especially for the one who fired from the Avalon window.  Officers said the man's name was known.  The name probably was that of Eugene Barnett, a suspected Wobbly who was seen in town after the shooting, and subsequently the one accused of firing the shot that killed Grimm.<br>
<br>
Barnett, after watching the excited throng gather around the jail when Everest was brought in, and seeing Everest's narrow escape from a daylight lynching, had concluded that no Wobbly was safe in Cen-
tralia.  He climbed on his horse and headed for home.  On the way he talked to farmer acquaintances, describing in bitter terms what he had seen in town.  One of these, Barnett said later, went into town and told officials that Barnett was one of the Wobblies who had been on the scene.<br>
<br>
The roundup of known or suspected Wobblies proceeded so fast that by late evening, after the lynching, the city jail was jammed with twenty-two prisoners, including Elmer Smith's two brothers and Tom Lassiter, the news dealer who was run out of town but came back.<br>
<br>
Families of the slain men were distraught over the tragedy.  A call was placed to William Grimm, Warren's brother, at the University of Washington.  The call was taken by Lloyd Dysart, out of the army and again studying for a law degree.  Dysart found Grimm, his fraternity
brother, on the football field.  They quickly borrowed a car and headed south over rough county roads, reaching Centralia about ten o'clock.<br>
<br>
They found the city in turmoil.  The downtown area was crowded with people, milling around, talking excitedly.  A Wobbly had been lynched.  The two young men were told that more were probably going to be lynched for they all deserved it.  Dysart joined hundreds of others who drove to the bridge, shining car lights on the body of Wesley Everest, dangling in the shadows beneath the Chehalis River bridge, then went home.  Judge Dysart had left instructions for Lloyd to put on his uniform, take his army pistol, and go to the Elks Club.  There he found his father standing on a chair, pleading with the few among the hundreds jammed into the hall who would listen to him.  When the judge saw his son, he said, "Lloyd, for God's sake help me control this mob." Most of the men in the hall were ex-servicemen still in their uniforms "and everybody was saying, 'Get a gun.'" The judge said the National Guard was expected to arrive any minute and "we have got to keep this crowd in hand so nobody innocent is harmed."<br>
<br>
A man described to Lloyd Dysart as the "ringleader" of the lynching a few hours before was pointed out to him.  Then two men urged him to lead a group who would go down to the jail and "get some of those bastards and string them up."<br>
<br>
"I told them to calm down and go home," Dysart related.  "I said, 'You can't stir up anything more.  You can't go down to that jail and start breaking in and taking anyone because you don't know who you'd be taking.  You don't know who they are.' Finally the National Guard did arrive and that broke up any organization of another lynch party."<br>
<br>
Before he left the Elks Club Dysart was asked to form a posse that would search for Wobblies in the coal-mining region east of town.  He agreed providing they wait until morning and that no more than fifteen or twenty men go along.  He didn't want a mob.<br>
<br>
The train bringing Company F from Tacoma arrived at 11:35 p.m. The soldiers were sent to the Chamber of Commerce office to wait while the officers conferred with Mayor Rogers and Assistant Attorney General Frank Christiansen in the city hall.  The Guard officers were told about the lynching.  In his report of the affair, Lieutenant Windsor of Company F said, "Conference with state, county and city officials developed the fact that the citizens generally were in a dangerous mood and that there was a strong possibility of further trouble unless great care was exercised in handling the situation."<br>
<br>
The danger point was the city jail but the Guard was not ordered to go there.  The possibility of a clash between armed soldiers and civilians, many of whom were armed too, in an atmosphere of mob hysteria, worried the mayor and Christensen.  They waited.  Finally midnight came, and fewer clamors for another lynching were heard.
The news spread quickly that out-of-town soldiers had arrived.  In the hours after midnight the crowds gradually dispersed, and as the noise diminished a feeling of massive relief came to the terrorized prisoners as they realized they were going to live through the night after all.  They were told what happened to Everest.  They listened for hours to the shouting mob outside the jail, lusting for another lynching.  Now at last the worst was over.<br>
<br>
Seventeen additional Guardsmen from Tacoma arrived and it was considered safe to assign them to guard duty at the jail.  Other detachments were sent to five places where main roads entered the city with orders to examine all persons entering or leaving and to hold "all suspicious characters." Several men carrying IWW cards were caught in the next several hours at these outposts and turned over to the sheriff.  Excitement erupted at one point when soldiers were fired on from a wooded area.  The soldiers fired back and then searched the area but found no one.<br>
<br>
The most frequently quoted accounts of the Everest lynching, none finally verified, accused the lynchers of emasculating him during the ride from the jail to the bridge.  It made a likely story.  The worst thing that can be done to a man, so the folklore of violence goes - the one irreversible punishment, a procedure used only on the most hated - is the hacking off of genitals.  It is something done to a man by other men caught up in a mood of uncontrolled fury, yielding to the urge to bite and gouge like one animal attacking another.  What the Wobbly killer had done that day was enough to arouse the worst animal instincts.<br>
<br>
Emasculation was the fate of at least one Wobbly in Southern California.  In the University of Washington library IWW picture file in 1983 was a photograph of a nude male body, lying on its back, legs spread to show what had been done.  The feet of numerous onlookers, male and female, showed in the picture.<br>
<br>
The report that Everest had been castrated gained credence that never diminished.  It originated almost immediately and spread at least as far as Olympia by the next day.  Sixty years afterward a senior Centralian could point to a photograph of a prominent Legion-
naire of 1919 on the wall of the county museum and say with assurance, "He did it."<br>
<br>
A belief that neither he nor anyone else did perform such an act is best supported by the record of an examination of Everest's body in the Centralia jail.  Since the investigator typed his report on a Tacoma police form, it can be assumed he was a member of that force, acting at the request of local police who did not have fingerprinting facilities.  He wrote that no marks could be found on the body other than bullet wounds.  He noted that the neck, still with a piece of rope around it, was cut.  This report found its way into the files of Luke May, retained by the county and lumber opera-
tors.  It was given no publicity, although it seems to constitute evidence that Everest was not castrated, and such evidence would have been useful in quieting the rumors of such an atrocity that
began to spread the day after the lynching.<br>
<br>
Whatever the facts, the report of the castration was generally believed because it was the kind of thing men acting outside the law, when an offender deserves punishment worse than the law allows, could be expected to do.  So if Everest was castrated, hanged, and then shot, the reasoning went, it served him right.  He was without doubt hanged and shot.  If he was castrated, no matter.  He was dead.  Anyone who killed unarmed men as he did deserved the worst.<br>
<br>
C. D. Cunningham had an explanation concerning the origin of the emasculation report.  He said that when Everest's body was brought in and no one around the jail wanted to examine it for scars or other identifying marks, a young man from Portland, in Centralia to solicit advertising for a Legion magazine, volunteered to cut off the bloody, wet clothes and search the body for marks.  To impress or frighten the Wobblies in the jail the Portland man remarked in a loud voice that while he was at it, he would castrate him also.  Ac-
cording to Cunningham, the imprisoned Wobblies either mistook what they heard as a report that he had been emasculated or started a rumor to that effect which was widely circulated.<br>
<br>
No one element of the Centralia story received more attention than the report about castration.  The verdict of those who have researched the records cannot be free entirely of reasonable doubt, but this researcher concludes that the reports, originating within hours of the lynching, were not a lie made up by Wobblies, for any Wobblies still at large on that fateful day in Centralia had fled for cover by nightfall when a mob was threatening to storm the jail.  They were not in a position to start false rumors on November 12.<br>
<br>
One of the legends that developed out of the chaotic events of Armistice Day concerned the supposed killing of another Wobbly.  Eugene Barnett, who was not in jail the night of the 11th, wrote forty-two years later, "Fellow worker James McInerney saw him (Jack Davis) killed in the Centralia jail the first night of the rioting.  He saw who did it.  And loggers from Saginaw camp saw the body being covered with ashes and cinders later that night." This report is counted as a legend because the report was not widely circulated, like the castration matter, and because there is no record of McInerney relating what Barnett quotes him as saying.  But it is true that nothing from or about Jack Davis, who almost certainly fired the shot that killed Warren Grimm, was ever heard afterward by those concerned with the Centralia affair.<br>
<br>
McInerney did say that the prisoners were mistreated in the jail.  "I have heard tales of cruelty," Ralph Chaplin, writing in 1920, quotes McInerney as saying about that night, "but I believe what we boys went through on those nights can never be equaled.  I thought it was my last night on earth and had reconciled myself to an early death of some kind, probably hanging.  I was taken out once by a mob and a rope was placed around my neck and thrown over a crossbar or something.  I waited for them to pull the rope, but they didn't.  I heard voices in the mob say, 'That's not him,' and then I was put
back in jail."<br>
<br>
Chaplin makes a bare mention of the rumor that Davis was also lynched.  If there actually was a second lynching, it is likely that the several investigators employed by the defense during the subsequent trial would have discovered some evidence of it.<br>
<br>
In the days following November 11 a few men were heard to boast that they were among the lynchers of Everest, but soon the horror of what had taken place prevailed over any feelings of satisfaction at having gotten back at the Wobblies.  A hush concerning the lynching and the lynchers became an accepted mandate in the always before quiet city after the newspaper editors undertook to assuage feelings of guilt by writing that what was done was fully justified in terms of morality and understandable in the light of what had provoked the action.<br>
<br>
The Centralia Hub the next day commented, "No county official would admit that any lynching had taken place.  No official wanted to be told of such action and it was generally understood that no effort would be made to learn the details or to bring any of those implicated before the courts."<br>
<br>
When the weekly Lewis County Advocate in Chehalis came out two days  later it said, "We cannot blame the lynchers when they forgot all else but the biblical injunction of 'an eye for an eye.' The Wobblies more than deserved what they got." The paper said the people showed "commendable reserve" in not hanging more of "the assassins."<br>
<br>
The names of the lynch participants were widely known.  Despite the attempt at concealment by turning out the city's lights, those who dragged Everest from the jail and hanged him from the bridge were seen and recognized by many, but no attempts to identify them publicly were ever made.  Certainly no prosecution of them was ever attempted or even seriously considered by those in office.<br>
<br>
Several lists of known or suspected lynchers were prepared in the course of defense efforts for the accused Wobblies.  One list has more than fifty names on it. Not all the lists are the same.  Julia Ruuttila, who undertook an independent investigation on her own in the 1930s, sought to identify the most likely lynchers by preparing a list of those whose names appeared on more than one of the early lists she found in Elmer Smith's files after he died.  She showed it to Bob Burrows, the farmer who witnessed the lynching near his home, who told her, "You've left two names out."<br>

CENTRALIA MASSACRE.<br>
<br>
Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, "The Legion Attacks, Centralia, 1919," <B>I Speak My Own Piece.</B> New York: Masses and Mainstream, 1955. p. 252-
256.<br>
<br>
During World War One lawless force and violence were rampant in this country, as I have described.  After the war ended, it con-
tinued, now led by ex-soldiers, fomented by stay-at-home patriots, employers and their hirelings.  Many violent scenes had occurred in 1918 and 1919.  The Rand School in New York City was attacked by a mob of soldiers and sailors who tore down the American flag flying from the building.<br>
<br>
The Socialist daily paper, the New York Call, was raided and wrecked.  Employees were driven out and beaten as they were forced through a gauntlet of armed men.  On Memorial Day in 1918, the I.W.W. hall had been raided by paraders in Centralia, Washington, its records and literature burned in the street, its furniture wrecked or stolen.  All who were found in the hall were beaten, arrested and driven out of town.<br>
<br>
The Governor, the Mayor, the Chief of Police and a company of National Guards were in the parade.  The mob action was led by the President of the Employers' Association.  The hall looked like a war ruin.  But the undaunted I.W.W. opened another hall.  They determined to defend themselves and their headquarters from further lawless at-tacks.<br>
<br>
Many attempts had been made to smash the Lumber Workers' Industrial Union of the I.W.W. during the war, especially during and after the great strike of 1917-for the eight-hour day.  Men had been beaten and jailed for long periods in Yakima, Ellensburg and other lumber towns.  Rope, tar and feathers, and clubs were used time and time again.<br>
<br>
The Eastern Railway and Lumber Company controlled much of the lumber land, sawmills, railroads and banks around Centralia.  The head of this outfit, F. B. Hubbard, was also President of the Employers' Association of Washington.  The American Legion had been organized in Centralia after the war and was in the forefront of the campaign to smash the I.W.W. and imprison its members.<br>
A blind man, Tom Lassiter, made his living at a little newsstand in Centralia.<br>
<br>
Among the papers he sold were the Seattle Union Record and the I.W.W. paper, The Industrial Worker.  In June, 1919, the newsstand was broken into and everything there taken out and burned.  He was warned to leave town in a note signed "U.S. Soldiers, Sailors and Marines."<br>
<br>
Later, when he refused to leave, he was seized, beaten and dropped in a ditch over the county line.  When he returned to Centralia, he was arrested under the criminal syndicalist law.  All attempts
of his lawyer, Elmer Smith, failed to bring the perpetrators of these outrages to justice, which emboldened the lawless elements in Centralia.<br>
<br>
The Employers' Association continually incited its members to action by regular bulletins, proclaiming such slogans as "active prosecution of the I.W.W.; Hang the Bolsheviks; Put the I.W.W. in jail; Get rid of the I.W.W.; Deport about ten Russians from this community; Deport the radicals or use the rope in Centralia," and similar sentiments.  A Citizens' Protective League was organized, which called meetings to discuss how to handle "the I.W.W. prob-
lem."<br>
<br>
The police, the Elks, and the Legion participated in these discussions.  A secret committee, similar to the Vigilante Committees of the old West, was set up.  The news leaked out that a raid was being planned on the I.W.W. hall, and was discussed at the Lewis County Trades Council.<br>
<br>
Some members from there warned the I.W.W. of the threats.  The I.W.W. issued a leaflet, "To the Citizens of Centralia We Must Appeal," in which they recited the threats and accusations against them.  It closed by saying: "Our only crime is solidarity, loyalty to the working class and justice to the oppressed"<br>
<br>
At a Legion meeting on November 6th, the line of march was changed to pass in front of the I.W.W. hall and it was agreed that they would halt in front of it, make a swift attack upon it and proceed with the parade.  They voted also to wear their uniforms.  The line of march was publicized.  Walter Grimms, in charge of the Legion, replaced Commander William Scales, who did not favor raiding the hall.<br>
<br>
Grimms was a veteran of the Siberian Expedition of the American Army.  He had attacked "the American Bolsheviki -the I.W.W.," in a Labor Day Speech.  Elmer Smith, the I.W.W.'s lawyer, advised his clients: "Defend the hall if you choose to do so -the law gives you the right." For this remark he was subsequently charged with murder.<br>
<br>
Armistice Day, November 11th, 1919, was the day of the parade.  Some of the paraders carried coils of rope.  At the words, "Let's<br>
Go!" the Centralia Legionnaires raided the hall, led by Grimms.  Shots were fired from inside the hall as the invaders smashed door and windows.  Shots came also from a nearby hillside.  Grimms was shot, at the head of the invaders.  He died later in the hospital.<br>
A Centralia druggist, Arthur McElfresh, was killed.  Wesley Everest, an I.W.W. member and veteran of World War 1, had done the shooting.  Five of the I.W.W.'s left in the hall took refuge in an unused ice-box at the rear, where they remained until they were arrested.<br>
<br>
Everest escaped from the back door, chased by the mob.  Everest
fired again as they closed in on him, and killed Dan Hubbard, a veteran and nephew of the lumber baron who had instigated the plot and then planned "to let the men in uniform do it." Everest was kicked and beaten, a rope put around his neck, and he was dragged senseless to the jail.<br>
<br>
In the night he was taken out, castrated and lynched, his swinging body used as a target for shot after shot.  The next day the body was brought back to the jail and thrown in among the prisoners, then taken out and surreptitiously buried in an unknown grave, so the I.W.W. could not take pictures of it, the authorities said.<br>
<br>
The men in jail were tortured and third degreed to make them "confess." One, Lorens Robert, became insane as a result.  A reign of terror against workers prevailed in Centralia.  A newspaper reporter from the Associated Press was compelled to leave town hurriedly, without his suitcase or typewriter, because he had sent out a report containing a damning remark made by a Dr. Bickford that the hall was raided before the shooting started.  This was the first statement to reach the outside world as to the shootings.<br>
<br>
Lumber trust lawyers appeared as special prosecutors at the trial at Montesano, County seat of Gray's Harbor County.  A change of venue had been granted but it made little difference.  Threats were made that the defendants would never get out of that county alive -if they were acquitted.<br>
<br>
The men on trial were ably defended by labor lawyer George W. Vanderveer.  Two defendants, Elmer Smith and Mike Sheehan, were acquitted.  Loren Roberts was declared insane.  Five men were found guilty of murder in the first degree because of the death of the Legionnaire Grimms.  Britt Smith, 0. C. Bland, James McInery, Bert Bland, Ray Becker, Eugene Barnett and John Lamb were found guilty of second degree murder.  They were sentenced to from 25 to 40 years in Walla Walla Penitentiary.<br>
<br>
Not one of the mob who attacked the hall, who murdered Wesley Everest and drove Roberts insane, were ever punished.  A Labor jury of six workingmen of A. F. of L. unions from Tacoma, Washington, met on March 15th, 1920, in the Labor Temple there and gave their verdict.<br>
<br>
It was that the defendants were not guilty; that there had been a conspiracy to raid the hall on the part of the business interests of Centralia; that the hall had been unlawfully raided and that Warren Grimms had participated in that raid.<br>
<br>
During the trial, the courthouse was surrounded by soldiers who camped on the lawn, and jurors admitted later that they were intimidated by the atmosphere.  The court was full of Legionnaires, in uniform, from all the surrounding towns.  They were now private citizens but they had an armed camp set up under command of former army officers.  
Two years later, six jurors gave affidavits to Elmer Smith, who worked on the case until his death in the early '30's, stating their fears and that if they had known the full story of the raid they would have voted to acquit the defendants.  As it was, the jury recommended leniency, which the judge ignored.<br>
<br>
Some law-abiding elements in the Legion spoke out.  Edward Bassett, an overseas veteran, commander of the Butte, Montana, post, issued a public statement before the trial, stating that the I.W.W. were justified in defending their hall and that the Legionnaires disgraced themselves by becoming party to a mob.<br>
<br>
Ten years later, in 1929, the Centralia Publicity Committee issued a four-page leaflet called "The Centralia Case," by an American Legionnaire of the Hoquiam Washington post of the Legion-a former Captain of the U. S. Army, Edward Patrick Call-urging people to "rectify a great wrong" by writing to the Governor to release the "eight innocent workers beginning their tenth year of imprisonment."<br>
<br>
He said: "A short resume of the Centralia case shows Centralia Legionnaires were used by local business interests to eject the I.W.W. On Armistice Day, 1919, the workers' hall was raided before a shot was fired in self-defense.  A gigantic frame-up followed, and the trial at Montesano bears all the earmarks of being an attempt at 'lynching'."<br>
<br>
Meetings were held on behalf of the Centralia victims for years.  Leaflets in 1919 were issued by our Workers' Defense Onion in New York City and funds raised to help Centralia defense.  One donation Of $500 came from the joint Board of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers.  I spoke with Elmer Smith in March, 1929, at the Seattle Civic Auditorium.<br>
<br>
I recall saying: "If the I.W.W. had raided a Legion hall, imagine what heroes the Legion would be to shoot them down!" Elmer Smith died of cancer shortly afterwards.  The legal struggle was taken over by Attorney Irwin Goodman of Portland, Oregon, a valiant civil liberties lawyer.  Roberts had been released as insane.<br>
<br>
Five were paroled in 1936, after seventeen years of unjust imprisonment, and the others, who refused parole, were released a short time later.  The Legion defiantly erected a statue to Grimms but the truth has prevailed, and what happened in Centralia is now known as the murder of Wesley Everest, ex-soldier, and the frame-
up of eight innocent workingmen.<br>

Will D. Jenkins, "Claim Jumpers," <B>Last Frontier in the North Cascades.</B> Mount Vernon: Skagit County Historical Society, 1984.<br>
<br>
[In the winter of 1916-1917] Mother and I were holding down the claim. We sat tight that winter for two good reasons.  One was, I had earned only a little money the previous summer and most of it went for food, back-packed in from Rockport.  The other was - and most important - the purported surveys of the numerous homesteads in our section of the hills had been accepted by the United States Land Office.  That was according to an official letter Mother had received.<br>
<br>
This letter also called to our attention the fact that legal residence was a requirement if we expected to retain possession of our quarter section.  In other words, unless we actually lived there, anyone could jump the claim.<br>
<br>
We could prove up and get a patent in three years if we could stick it out.  We did.  I can add here that in all the years I roamed and hunted the timbered hills between the Sauk and the Illabot Creek country, I found little evidence to indicate a surveyor's transit had ever been carried into the big wilderness.<br>
<br>
I grew up to believe the federal land agents were mostly a bunch of crooks beholden to the railroads and timber barons of our times and I've never had reason to change my mind....<br>
<br>
Several claims on Sauk River were jumped that year, opportunists taking advantage of the absence of squatters who had gone Outside for the winter, apparently thinking their claims were safe.  In our area there had been only one instance of this kind, probably because with few exceptions the claim holders were remaining as we were, in their cabins.<br>
<br>
Hugo Bauman, who ran the Rockport Hotel, jumped the Hamer claim in the high valley between Porter Mountain and Saddleback.<br>
<br>
I remember a day just before freeze-up in December, I was back-packing a load of grub when Hugo caught up with me on the Martin Rrnch road about a mile east of Rod O'Connor's homestead.<br>
<br>
Hugo was driving an old plug of a horse hitched to a little rubber tired sulky.  He invited me to lash my heavy pack back of the little bucket seat of the sulky, which I was happy to do.  There was no room for me in the sulky but I had the load off my back, anyway.<br>
<br>
I walked along then, visiting with Hugo as his old nag plodded over
the muddy road, and it was then that Hugo said he was going up the Porter Mountain trail.  I supposed he was probably heading for Frank Felch's claim or maybe Sam Walls' on Scatter Creek as they were friends of Hugo, and I knew they were both at home.<br>
<br>
Where the high valley trail left the Martin Ranch road Hugo hitched his horse to a tree, tucked a little haversack under one arm and headed for the pack trail switchbacks as we said our so-longs, and I went on east with my load of grub.<br>
<br>
It was not until the following spring that I learned what Hugo's trip into the high valley was all about.  I was eating dinner one day in Matey Rose's family style dining room in the Rockport Hotel when in came Hugo smiling in great elation and showing everybody a check he had just received in the day's mail.  It was for $700 and it bore the signature of Frank Hamer.<br>
<br>
Hamer had paid Bauman to get off Hamer's claim!<br>
<br>
I learned in time that Hugo had hired Happy Albert the Finn to build a cedar shake cabin on the Hamer quarter-section.  The $700 according to Hugo, was simply just compensation to defray the "legal" expenses of "making location" - which was a polite way of describing what was more generally referred to in our hills as claim jumping.<br>
<br>
Funny thing about it was, Hugo and Hamer had always been pretty good friends-"kloshe tillicums" as the Skagits would say.  Hamer had never built a cabin.  In fact, as an official in a high ranking federal government position at the time, Hamer was not qualified to hold a claim under the residence laws.  And Hugo was in the same boat, because he was running a hotel in Rockport, at least seven miles from the big stand of virgin timber that was known as "the Hamer homestead."<br>
<br>
I guess you could say it was just one of those things that made life interesting for homesteaders on the upper Skagit, including a little legal larceny.  As it turned out, neither Hamer nor Hugo could have held the claim in any event.  When the loggers came to our hills they bought the quarter section from the Northern Pacific Railroad.  The N.P.'s scrip covered the entire area under an old federal grant, as it did so many others in those days of highly speculative ownership.<br>

COCK FIGHTING<br>
<br>
Will D. Jenkins, "The Chicken Fighters," <B>Last Frontier in the North Cascades.</B> Mount Vernon: Skagit County Historical Society, 1984.p. 89-91.<br>
<br>
One of my good friends at Darrington was Fred Griffith, whom I had known when my folks lived at Lake Whatcom.  His father and brothers had built our original log house in Geneva, near Bellingham, in 1905.  That's where I got to know Fred.  He played the fiddle and raised game chickens.<br>
<br>
In 1917 when I was stationed at the Blue Bird with Ranger Eilert Skaar, Fred was running a little six-stool lunch counter in Dar-
rington, called the White Horse Cafe, for the mountain of the same name.  The patronage was mainly loggers from Sauk Valley and camps along the Stillaguamish.<br>
<br>
Fred had an active sideline, however a surreptitious one, of fighting gamecocks.  He owned some mighty fine birds, including Cu-
ban Reds, Hatch Clarets, Blues, Grays, and English Games.  He swore by his Cubans, especially, and claimed there was never a dunghill among them.  Fred had collected quite a few good bets as evidence of his judgment of fighting quality.<br>
<br>
So that no one, particularly the law, would get the idea he was leading a double life, Fred kept his birds walked out on Old Uncle Aaron's ranch near Lyman.  Uncle Aaron was an acknowledged dean of the Tarheel cock fighting fraternity.  He and Fred did considerable dealing in hot-blooded birds.  The two men had a profitable working arrangement involving their game chickens, and in the winter months, when the cocks were in full feather, they often attended secretly held mains together.<br>
<br>
Of course there were people in the valley who considered cock fighting wicked, and there had been raids by the sheriff at various times, most probably based on information supplied by local informants.  I doubt that any of the squealers who stool pigeoned on the mains were Tarheels because the North Carolinians and their kin who made up the bulk of the population, were known to regard cock fighting as they did moonshining - a traditional inherited birthright which could readily be supported by any unbiased interpretations of the Bill of Rights.<br>
<br>
In a raid on a pit barn on the North Prairie one snowy night, the game cockers were jumped before they had a chance to start the main.  The birds, including Fred's Cubans and Uncle Aaron's Clarets, were all in their tight little pens as the boys fled the<br>
barn.  The men escaped by running down a shallow creek-bed, leaving no tracks for the sheriff to follow.  There were no arrests but some brave and willing chickens were confiscated in their pens.<br>
<br>
From what I heard of it, the sheriff held the birds for about two weeks in the futile hope their owners would show up but none did.  He was getting awful tired of feeding and watering his scrappy, crowing prisoners when Fred decided the time was right to approach<br>
the law with a proposition.<br>
<br>
Possibly because no actual crime had been committed when he made the raid, and the legality of the seizure of penned birds might reasonably be challenged, the sheriff appears to have been open to suggestions for a way out.<br>
<br>
"I could use them chickens for stews in my place in Darrington," says Fred, referring to the White Horse lunch counter.  "But, of course, Sheriff, I couldn't afford to pay much for them.  I only get two bits for a chicken stew."<br>
<br>
The sheriff sold the gamecocks to Fred for twenty-five cents apiece and the way Fred related it to me, seemed glad to get rid of them.<br>
<br>
I met Fred walking home one moonlight night.  He had a beautiful Cuban Red snuggled under his coat.  Its natural spurs had been filed short to receive the sharp pointed gaffs it would ultimately wear in battle, and the nubbins were carefully wrapped in chamois.  We talked about the raid in North Prairie.<br>
<br>
I can still see Fred's white teeth grinning in the moonlight as he related how he and Uncle Aaron and several of their friends got all their birds back - at very nominal cost.<br>

Cock Fights<br>
<br>
Roy Franklin Jones, Boundary Town: Early Days in a Northwest Boundary Town.  Vancouver, Wa.: Fleet Printing Co.  1958, p.150-3.<br>
<br>
It must have been the railroad section hands who first brought the cock fights to Sumas.  I suppose it was a good place because it was up there against the boundary line where a man could take his birds and scoot across in case of raids by the sheriff.  There were always plenty of saloons where the visiting owners could whoop it up in<br>
celebration afterwards and losers could salve their bitterness.<br>
<br>
But cock fighting was something else my father would have nothing of.  It was only at the blacksmith shop or around the saloons, when we boys went in to sell some gathered up empty bottles, that we would hear the enthusiastic tales about the feathered fighters.  Some of the older boys like Al Warnick, Clarence McBurney and Jim Smith talked about the "birds" while we small fry were trading marbles.  It got to be quite a deal for several years, and here is what the Daily Reveille, at New Whatcom, had to say in their issue of Jan. 28, 1898:<br>
<br>
"Cockfight at Sumas" - "The greatest cocking main on record took place near Sumas last Saturday night, and as a result, Billie Belong, 'The Original Mug', went back to Seattle with $2100.00 in his pocket.  The other fellows were broke.  One of them owes Billie a pig, another a shirt."<br>
<br>
"The main, proper was to consist of eleven battles.  Only nine were fought, as Billie's birds won six out of the nine, thus making a majority, no matter how the others would have ended."<br>
<br>
"After the main was over, six 'shake' fights took place.  Belong won five out of the six."<br>
<br>
"The main was the outcome of a persistent effort on the part of some of the sports to show Belong that he is not the owner of the greatest fighting cocks in Seattle.  It was Belong against a combination consisting of Frank Burns, Frank Dollarby, Ed Clark, Smith, McGee, Phinney, Perry and another whose name could not be learned."<br>
<br>
"They scoured the country to get the best birds possible.  That they were confident in winning is shown by the fact that they readily agreed to have the main for $350.00 with $20.00 aside on each battle.  Those who were in on the fight left Friday night and went to the battleground near Sumas.  The main took place Saturday night and was witnessed by many of Seattle, Whatcom and Vancouver's best known sports."<br>
<br>
The cockfights furnished a lot of entertainment.  When advertised, the billing gave the impression that the fights were held across the line, but that was a misleading statement.  Perhaps this was to save face for the sheriff because the fights were illegal.  Most bouts were put on in a pit in a shed adjoining Ottestead's saloon.  It was there, one night, the sheriff raided and Jim Smith and Will Eaton made a quick exit through a window, jumping eight feet to the weeds below.<br>
<br>
But Billie the Mug was not always tops as the Reveille article seemed to claim.  George Handley had a Wyandotte rooster which killed one of Billie's best birds.  Billie then put up another and George's bird put that one away, too.  Then Billie offered George $25.00 for his bird.  A rooster like that at market prices was worth
about fifty cents but George wouldn't sell for twenty-five dollars.<br>
<br>
After the raids the pits were moved to other spots.  One fancy place was in the back of the I.O.O.F. Hall, which made it a brotherhood activity.  A check of attendance there would have revealed the names of most of the leading men in town.<br>
<br>
These were all on an organized basis but occasionally there was a private match to bolster up an owner's ego, just the same as the dog fights, which sometimes preceded a fight of the owners of the dogs.  One of the funniest things we kids learned about was the cockfight by Jessie Lindsey's pet.<br>
<br>
Jessie Lindsey was a little girl, but quite a few people had bantams or fighters for pets so her father gave her a small rooster.  A fighting cock or a gander made a pretty good watch dog to have around in the yard.<br>
<br>
Jessie had a dog, too, Rover, full of fun and mischief.  Rover was very much intrigued with the little rooster and would lower himself on front elbows and bark at the feathered member of the family.  Jessie had named him "Warhorse" at her father's suggestion and he soon began to show that he was well named.  When Rover barked, the bird was annoyed and began to flutter to the attack.  With spurs and beak he made quite a commotion against Rover's black shaggy shoulder.  In time, Rover too, went to the attack.  He would catch his playmate in his mouth and shake him, but at Jessie's watchful supervision, he was careful not to hurt the bird.  When Warhorse was grown he got lots of exercise in the yard chasing the dog and being chased.<br>
<br>
One day neighbor Williams dropped over to talk to Mr. Lindsey.  He had a fine fighting cock at home, kept carefully closed up in a fancy wire enclosed run.  As he left he saw little tomboy Jessie chasing her rooster.<br>
<br>
"Nice looking bird you have there, Jessie.  I don't suppose you'd let him fight a real game cock, would you?"<br>
<br>
"Me, my bird! that bird of yours in the cage! Why, no, I wouldn't want him to fight because your bird isn't tough like Warhorse.  My bird would lick him in a minute!"<br>
<br>
"Ha, ha, ha! What do you say we let them have a little exercise."<br>
<br>
"All right, Mr. Williams, you bring him over and we'll see."<br>
<br>
Williams was soon back with his prize bird.  They went around behind the house.<br>
<br>
"I'll put Dixie Traveler down first and then you can throw Warhorse down," said Williams.<br>
<br>
"Oh, no, Mr. Williams. my bird is going to lick yours.  You better
let me put Warhorse down first, then you can throw the Traveler."<br>
<br>
"All right, Jessie, I'm afraid it won't make any difference, but I'll watch the Traveler and pull him off."<br>
<br>
When Dixie Traveler was thrown down he flew to the attack as only a fighting cock can.  But Warhorse went up in the air, too, and as they came down together, he closed the attack with beak and spurs, just like a battle with Rover.  They had the air full of flying feathers.  Fluttering back for fresh starts the fury of the battle was renewed again and again.<br>
<br>
Blood showed on Warhorse and Dixie Traveler alike.  Soon the Traveler began to lose ground.  When he saw Warhorse coming in again, he suddenly turned tail, made a fast run and flew through the hedge in the back, ran across the pasture and disappeared in the woods.  It was about a week before Mr. Williams found his Traveler and got him back in that nice enclosed pen.<br>

COXEY'S ARMY.<br>
<br>
Carlos A. Schwantes, "The Rivals, or Gambling on Jumbo," <B>Coxey's Army.</B> Lincoln: University of Nebraska, 1985. Chapter Fifteen p. 230-245.<br>
<br>
Suppose they put us in the chain gang.  The government merely dem-
onstrates that it can support the unemployed and the question will arise: If the government can support us that way, why not have us employed on public improvements where the country could benefit?<br>
<br>
"General" Edward J. Jeffries, quoted in the Alliance Standard R<br>
August 2, 1894.<br>
<br>
The Rivals; Or, Gambling on Jumbo<br>
<br>
A mixture of motives drove the westerners toward Washington.  For some it was idealism; for others the alternatives to life in the ranks were even worse, as Jack London learned after he left Kelley's ranks and ran afoul of vagrancy laws near Buffalo.  Members of a group found safety in numbers , as Kelley's steady progress up the Ohio Valley illustrated.  Finally, for members of two armies that formed. In the Far West , there was the added impetus of a longstanding urban rivalry, and for them the trip across the continent became something of an endurance contest.<br>
<br>
The history of the American West is punctuated with tales of urban rivalries, but few were more vigorous than that between Seattle and Tacoma, two competing ports on Washington's Puget Sound.  Tacoma, nicknamed the "City of Destiny" by the eccentric George Francis Train, won the contest to become the Pacific terminus of the first northern transcontinental railroad, the Northern Pacific.  Seattle, however, refused to surrender and in <B>1893 </B>became the terminus of an-
other transcontinental railroad, James J. Hill's Great Northern,<br>
<br>
The rivalry found many modes of expression, as m graffiti scrawled on the men's room wall of a Seattle railroad station during the Spanish-American War in <B>1898:</B><br>
<br>
Remember the Maine<br>
To Hell with Spain<br>
And don't forget<br>
To pull the chain-<br>
          Tacoma needs the water!
Tacoma school children and businessmen, too, chanted at luncheon meetings, "Seattle, Seattle! Death rattle, death rattle!" During the Coxey movement, the Evening Telegram of Portland poked fun at the adolescent rivals to the north when it claimed that Seattle had begged its Coxeyites not to march to Washington: "If the unemployed move out, Tacoma will stand a chance to lead Seattle in the next census."' Large armies formed among the unemployed of both Seattle and Tacoma, and on April 27 they converged temporarily in the tiny railway junction of Puyallup to await a train.<br>
<br>
The Seattle contingent, nine hundred strong and led by a mild-mannered surveyor, Henry Shepard, arrived first and found shelter from the rain in an unfinished and abandoned hotel.<br>
<br>
An hour later someone shouted, "Here comes Jumbo!" In the distance loomed the bulky form of the Tacoma general, Frank T. Cantwell, riding in a buggy.  There was an immediate rush to greet him- "Three cheers for Jumbo!" shouted a Seattleite- Jumbo, dressed in a new navy-blue uniform decorated with shiny brass buttons, grinned from ear to ear; he looked like a cross between a railway conductor and a cannibal chief.<br>
<br>
One of United States marshal James C. Drake's deputies handed him a copy of an injunction issued by federal Judge Cornelius Hanford.  Jumbo looked briefly at the document, then laughed, saying he could draw up a paper like that himself.  It was not worth a thing, he added.<br>
<br>
Cantwell's seven hundred followers arrived a short while later, and though they camped in another part of the village, the two leaders put in a joint appearance before the temporarily united armies.  Jumbo energized the troops with his red-hot oratory and simple solutions to complex problems: "The Northern Pacific is in the receivers' hands now.  Haven't we got the right to use our property? Are we not the government?"<br>
<br>
The big man made quite an impression on Seattle's troops.<br>
Shepard, by contrast, scemed ineffective, particularly when his com-<br>
missary wagon did not arrive until late in the evening: "Never was a commissary so taxed to get through a meal.  Another such one and the Seattle industrials would have mutinied and gone home." Over at<br>
Cantwell's commissary, everything went smoothly.  Bread, pretzels, bologna, fish, and other edibles were piled high on the tables, and hungry men enjoyed a feast.  "Jumbo declared his men would eat if they got nowhere."<br>
<br>
Jumbo was always the center of attention.  A crowd of admirers followed him about, and women begged men to introduce them so they might shake his hand.  When he spoke, his words carried over the whole town, even though he was a bit hoarse from speaking fourteen consecutive nights in Tacoma.  Carlotta Cantwell came to Puyallup,
too, and in the eyes of the press she "seemed to enjoy the whole affair as a huge joke.  She heard her husband speak in the afternoon and seemed to regard the matter as very amusing.""<br>
<br>
One thing not very amusing was the continued want of a train.  The federal government's use of the army to corral train pirates in Montana and Oregon strengthened the resolve of the Northern Pacific to resist Commonwealers from Puget Sound.  "We ain't too good to steal a train, " warned Jumbo.  "Them fellers in Congress has broke the law, so why can't we."<br>
<br>
Jumbo's listeners never seemed to tire of his bravado stvie of haranguing.  While Jumbo thundered, Carlotta tried to charm the Northem Pacific out of a train.  Handsomely dressed in a spring outfit and diamond jewelry, she marched with four hundred supporters to the Northern Pacific building in Tacoma to see the road's assistant general superintendent, G. W Dickinson.  He was suddenly away on business.<br>
<br>
After some difficulty, Carlotta located a minor company official and tried to hire enough freight cars to transport her husband's army, but the railroad stood its ground.  Conunonwealers appealed to the governor of Washington, John Hart McGraw, asking him to intercede with the company; but unlike his Oregon counterpart, he had no sympathy for the movement.   There seemed no easy way out for the two industrial armies."<br>
<br>
During the first week of May, the press carried yet another story sure to add to the woes of the folk in Puyallup: "Unless supplies are received in forty-eight hours these men will be in a starving condition." Added to that was the problem of drenching rain.  With each passing day the dampness took its toll on the crusaders' morale and contributed to friction within the ranks.'<br>
<br>
From the time that Seattle marchers had first seen Shepard and Cantwell together, they could not help making individual comparisons.  Shepard was small of stature-he looked like a boy when standing beside the great Jumbo-and he was colorless.  The Seattle men spent hours discussing the merits of the two leaders.<br>
<br>
They hated to give in to their Tacoma rivals, but everyone could see that Jumbo's men were a better-fed and happier lot.  Whatever desire the marchers from Seattle had to join the Tacoma army decreased, however, when old urban rivalries resurfaced and jumbo proclaimed he would not take in any new recruits.  He refused to share any provisions with the Seattle men, saying, "That money was raised for the Tacoma boys and they'll get it all."<br>
<br>
A few days earlier, the Seattle men had looked upon Jumbo "as a sort of Moses, who would lead them out of the wilderness and bondage."
But many had now come to the conclusion that he was frothy, an opinion that grew stronger every day that the armies remained trapped in Puyallup.  That, however, did not make Seattle marchers like their own leader any better.  They accused Shepard of becoming dictatorial in his unposition of military discipline on the men, of usurping the powers of the executive committee, and of not providing an adequate accounting of their funds.<br>
<br>
Flexing the muscles of democracy, the marchers demoted Shepard and elected in his place a voung journalist and lawyer, Edward Jeffries.  To guard against any dictatorial tendencies on the part of the private suddenly elevated to general, they created a supreme council to function as a court of last resort.  Jeffries, though quite the opposite of Cantwell, could hold his own against the big man-ver-
bally if not physically.<br>
<br>
And intellectually there was no comparison: the twenty eight year old Jeffries had attended the University of Michigan Law School after teaming the ropes of joumalism on'several daily papers in his hometown of Detroit.  In 1889 he had moved his family to Spokane, where during the next four years he was active in various labor and agrarian reform organizations, most importantly the Populist Party.<br>
<br>
Jumbo, by contrast , was a self-appointed bouncer for the Tacoma Democrats. Jeffries's interest lay in defending the underdog through the reform press or in court.  Cantwell was ever the blustering frontier gambler and prizefighter looking out mainly for himself."<br>
<br>
For a time it seemed as if Shepard's fall was but a prelude to the general collapse of Coxeyism at Puyallup.  After remaining there for<br>
ten frustrating days, the crusaders started slipping out of town as individuals or in small groups, leading the press to report that the armies had broken up 'Mto an "unemployed band of tramps." In fact, Cantwell and Jeffries had hit upon a new tactic- to send their men across the state in small bands to Spokane, where they would recol-
lect into armies.<br>
<br>
Each general invoked a sense of honor and the old urban rivalries to spur their troops along in what was at times an undisguised race.  "Talk about Jumbo's army breaking up into squads and going east," bragged Jeffrics.  'Why, we can give 'em two days start and beat 'em in every time."<br>
<br>
The four-hundred-mile obstacle course from Puyallup to Spokane wound up the west face of the Cascade Mountains to the long tunnel under Stampede Pass and then descended to Ellensburg, at the edge of the and side of the state.  They would have to pass through the narrow canyon of the Yakima River and cross the wide Columbia near Pasco-where the only bridge was operated by the Northern Pacific and guarded by federal marshals.  From there they would have to continue northeast through a sparsely settled desert of sand and sage until they reached Spokane.  
This they did, encountering trouble all along the way.  A large raft built in Ellensburg overturned in the icy waters of the Yakima River and drowned four men.  A fight with federal deputies at Yakima led to the arrest and jailing Of <B>120 </B>Coxeyites.<br>
<br>
But Commonwealers also had several sources of support, not the least of which was Jumbo himself.  As the Tacoma men left Puyallup, Cantwell purchased a railway ticket to avoid trouble with the mar-
shals and rode up and down the line encouraging his men.  "Spokane or bust!" he would yell from the rear platform of a passing train.<br>
"Come on, boys, I'm with you." He advised his men to avoid passenger trains, but a number nonethless climbed aboard when his train puffed out of a station.  A short distance down the line it stopped in order for marshals to pull them off.<br>
<br>
But Cantwell climbed out and boosted his men up to the tops of the cars as fast as marshals could remove them.  And railroad employees typically stood around with their hands in their pockets.  When the Coxeyites were still stranded in Puyallup, the railroaders invariably greeted Jumbo with cheers as they rolled through town, and he responded with a wave of his hat and a loud, "You're all right, boys; we'll fix these guys."'<br>
<br>
A Northern Pacific conductor confided to a reporter, "No matter<br>
what the men may tell the bosses you can put it down as a fact that they are as a nde in sympathy with the Commonwealers. <B>it </B>would not surprise me much to see one of our men help Jumbo's gang, although I doubt very much there would be more than one or two among all our boys who would lend themselves to bucking the United States government." He added that the Northern Pacific employees disliked having the deputy marshals riding their trains and bossing them around.<br>
<br>
"The railroad men are our best friends," Jeffries told a group of sympathizers when he got to Spokane.  "Down at Yakima one told us: 'Now when I say "get off all you sons of bitches,," just climb on as fast as you can.  We've got our orders, but you can ride as far as you want to."' "Hooray for the shacks [conductors]!" shouted a listener."<br>
<br>
Some of the deputies, too, quietly helped the Commonwealers along.  On occasion thev fed the men as brothers, which in a sense they were.  Marshal Drake and others who recruited them did not realize that some of the newly hired deputies were members of Eugene Debs's American Railway Union.  They had signed up as marshals in order to help the Coxeyites cross the state and thus prevent them from succumbing to the temptation to scab on the union during its strike against the Great Northern.<br>

Other members of organized labor had quietly signed up as well.<br>
<br>
It was no easy game to play.  Union men serving as deputies did not like being called "pinheads" and other names by those who did not understand what was happening.  Nor was it much fun to ride up and down the railway line in a pelting rain trying to police the trains.  Two deputies generally rode in the locomotive and several more scattered among the cars.  In general, though, they pulled off only enough of the freeloaders to make a show of force, and let the majority go through, unless railway officials ordered the whole train sidetracked.<br>
<br>
The press reported that if it became necessary to use extreme force, many marshals would turn in their badges."<br>
<br>
After a week of playing a serious game of cat and mouse with the deputies and the railroaders, Coxeyites from Puget Sound collected in Spokane.  There they picked up several hundred more members when a local army disintegrated after its general attempted to decamp with the treasury.  During the days they remained in Spokane, Jeffries and Cantwell put on benefit performances to raise money for<br>
the trip east, explained their mission in public meetings, and proved their patriotism in frequent games of baseball with Spokane teams.<br>
<br>
Accompanying Jumbo when he arrived in Spokane were his wife,, her little girl (Mabel Morgan), and Jumbo's canine counterpart, a pet Saint Bemard named Colonel.  The general's family continued to Chicago, where they were to serve as the army's advance guard.  At a large public indignation meeting in Spokane, Cantwell vowed to ob-
tain transportation for his men.  "I ain't broke , " he said as he flourished a wad of money.  "But they won't take us for money.  My wife offered them $10,000 to take the boys from Seattle, Tacoma, Spokane, and Butte to Washington, but it didn't go."<br>
<br>
With each passing day, it became increasingly clear to the Coxeyites in Spokane that they would never continue east unless they resorted to the proven tactic of riding the trains in small groups.  Jeffries was quite proud of the resourcefullness of his troops: "Our boys are artists, every one of them.  When we say we are going to meet at a certain time, it is a point of honor with us to get there." His men sang:<br>
<br>
Jeffries, Jeffries, he's all right;.<br>
Seattle boys are out of sight.<br>
<br>
Every time a train goes through<br>
It takcs out a dozen or two.<br>
<br>
Ta-ra-boom-de-ave; ta-ra-boom-de-ave<br>
<br>
We, the Coxey men, will win the day.
Ta-ra-ra boom de ave."'<br>
<br>
The rival armies left Spokane in late May and headed toward Montana destinations, where each planned to regroup, hold meetmgs, collect donations from svmpathizers, and continue on. Jumbo proposed to take the high line-the Great Nonhem route through Montana to Great Falls-and Jerries the Northern Pacific route through southern Montana to Helena.  After crossing some fifteen hundred miles of mountains and prairies, both railway lines met again at the twin cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, and which army would win that leg of the race was anyone's guess.<br>
<br>
First, though, they had to get through the rugged country of the Idaho panhandle and waiting there for them were deputy sheriffs, soldiers from the United States Army, and federal marshals armed with rifles and a court injunction.  With help from numerous sym-<br>
pathizers among the region's metal miners and a little bit of native wit, most crusaders made it.<br>
<br>
A marcher nameed Callahan, who was quite adept at imitating a Swedish accent, displayed his technique when he climbed aboard a train heavily guarded by lawmen.  One of them immediately ordered him off.<br>
<br>
"Vat?" responded the Irish Swede.  'Get off!"<br>
<br>
"I not ond'stand Anghs," said Callahan with a blank look on his face.<br>
<br>
"Well ride then, you dumb Swede.""<br>
<br>
Cantwell and Jeffries both reached Minneapolis during the last half of June.  Jumbo arrived first, having suddenly and somewhat mysteriously switched roles with his wife.  She went to Great Falls to lead the troops east, and he assumed the role of advance agent.  Jumbo arrived in Minnesota claiming that he had organized con-
tingents in Grand Forks ard Fargo and that twenty-five hundred men were coming behind him.  But with his usually smooth-shaven face wearing a week's growth of beard, he looked more like a fugitive from justice than anvffiing else.<br>
<br>
In any case, after a stay at one of the finest hotels in Minneapolis, he seemed his old expansive self once again.<br>
<br>
Jumbo regaled a Minneapolis audience with tales of his adventures in the Far West and presented a series of bombastic arguments that seemed even more outrageous than usual: "If the Commonwealers had shouldered arms when they left Tacoma thev would have had a clear
road through to Washington.  The tin horn gamblers and pimps and United States marshals would never have troubled us."<br>
<br>
He mused aloud that it was no more wrong for the Commonwealers to go to Washington and hang a few senators and congressmen than it was to permit the Congress of the United States to steal from the people.  The crowd of a thousand people that had gathered in the old Haymarket Square vigorously applauded his three-hour harangue, but the sulliness of his arguments earned him the animosity of city officials in both Minneapolis and Saint Paul.<br>
<br>
Armed with a letter of introduction from the Spokane Trades Council, Cantwell won the support of organized workmen in the Twin Cities.  With the aid of their donations, he soon collected an army of nearly two hundred men.  He led them east across Minnesota and Wisconsin, but it was not an easy trip.  They were frequently harassed by law officers and near Racine were clubbed by a squad of railroad policemen employed by the Chicago and North-Western.<br>
<br>
Cantwell's erstwhile rival, Jeffries, waited in the Twin Cities to collect his men.  Crossing the plains of North Dakota in small bands) they had encountered considerable difficulty with federal deputies.  From Saint Paul, Jeffries advised his men to head 150 miles due north to Duluth, Minnesota's third-largest city.  But why Duluth and why north? Washington lay to the southeast.<br>
<br>
Jeffries had read about the hostility that Cantwell encountered in Wisconsin and also about the Pullman strike that had tied up railway lines into Chicago.  As a native of Michigan, he also knew something about the geography of the Great Lakes country.  By going to Duluth and hiring a boat to Cleveland or Buffalo, he could take his men to towns that had as yet had little or no direct contact with the Coxey movement.  Furthermore, it beat walking or riding under freight cars.  Mavbe Cantwell would reach Washington first, but traveling through parts of the Midwest already visited by three or four other armies did not appeal to Jeffries.<br>
<br>
Only one problem remained for him to solve: where would he get the money to hire a boat? He had several hundred dollars in contri-
butions from organized labor and wealthy mine owners in Montana, but that was not enough.  For starters, jeffries collected $25 from members of the local branch of the Interntional Typographical Union when he showed them his membership card.<br>
<br>
Through public meetings and private contributions, the Seattleite raised enough money to pay his army's way across Lake Superior on a steamer bound for Marquette, in the iron-mining country of Michigan's upper peninsula.  Jeffries and about four hundred followers sailed out of Duluth on July 7. From Marquette they traveled by chartered boxcars to the Straits of Mackinac, which they crossed by boat, and then hiked sixteen miles to Cheboygan.  
From there the Michigan Central Railroad reluctantly hauled them south to the lumber town of Bay City, which proved the most congenial stopping place they had found since leaving Seattle.  "The hearts of the people of Bay City were big and their pocketbooks overflowed with wealth  observed a local paper.  In Bay City and nearby Saginaw, the friends and enemies of the movement combined to raise a purse to charter a lumber schooner to take them to Cleveland, with an intermediate stop in Jeffries's hometown of Detroit.<br>
<br>
In Detroit, Jeffries was reunited with his recently widowed mother for the first time since he had gone west, but even that tear-jerking story, duly reported in the press, was not enough to make citizens of Michigan's largest city open their purses.  Few Detroiters donated food or clothing to the visitors, not even members of organized labor.  Because of the disappointing reception, the Coxeyites sailed for Cleveland a day earlier than planned.  So little food remained in their commissary that only the seasickness caused by a lake storm kept them from eating it bare.<br>
<br>
Cleveland proved even less hospitable than Detroit.  Police officers would not permit Jeffries to speak in the public square, nor would they find the army shelter for the night.  'Well this is the meanest place we have struck yet," announced one of Jeffries's lieutenants.  But Jeffries was clever.  He and his men muzzled themselves with handkerchiefs and strips of cloth and paraded silently through downtown streets and around but not on the public square.<br>
<br>
Their banner read "Free Speech in Cleveland." The unusual demonstration created quite a stir and aided their cause by calling it to public attention.  "People are not so dull witted as to fail to see the point the Washingtonians were making against the policy of the city government observed  the Plain Dealer.<br>
<br>
As the crusaders continued overland from Cleveland to Pittsburgh during the last week of July, Jerries found opportunities to im-
provise other forms of passive protest.  Fifty of his men aboard a freight train at Ravenna were ordered off at gunpoint and lodged <B>in</B> jail, prompting several hundred comrades to pitch camp on the courthouse lawn and dare police to arrest them, too.<br>
<br>
They had no food and no money, and every freight train from the West brought in reinforcements.<br>
<br>
Jeffries used the occasion to elaborate on his method of operation: "The only way to transport a large body of men over a long distance is to give them orders that thev will obey.  I always ordered them to ride; I knew they wouldn't." He also explained the virtues of passive resistance.  "They can't shoot or club a fellow who won't fight back.  The authorities may order a fellow away, but they can't kill him for not going." (This was more than a decade before Gandhi
began practicing his own version of Passive resistance.) "The only force we evcr use is the force of numbers,)" gloated Jerries.<br>
<br>
That same tactic, he believed, would win the day in Washington.  "If we can get a million men there we can just swarm aff over the Capitol grass and everything else.  What could they do? Arrest us? Let them arrest.  For everyone they could arrest there would be ten to take his place.<br>
<br>
Using passive resistance and variety of other tactics, Jeffries and his men managed to remain a step or two ahead of those who would send them to the workhouse or jail.  At the entrance to Allegheny City, where Coxey's army had come to grief and nearly disbanded (and where other armies had been turned away), Jeffries refused to be rerouted.  He gave police the choice of arresting all 430 of his men and paying the cost of feeding them, or allowing them to proceed.<br>
<br>
The police stepped aside.  Being the seventh or eighth army to reach Pittsburgh meant that his men received a tepid wekome at best, al-
though the Post conceded that Jeffries was "the most intelligent and unique commander who has visited this city."<br>
<br>
Jeffries's troops walked sixty miles from Pittsburgh to Connells-
ville, a railway town and coke-producing center nestled in the moun-
tains of western Pennsylvania; but they refused to walk farther.<br>
<br>
When they clambered aboard a Baltimore and Ohio freight, the railroad that had persuaded Governor McKinley to send out the Ohio National Guard to clear its trains gave battle.  The air was filled with clubs, heavy chain, coupling pins, and scrap iron that flew back and forth between the Coxeyites and railroad crewmen and detec-
tives.<br>
<br>
Jeffries fought beside his men and received many bruises.  Several on both sides were injured seriously and had to hospitalized.  At least a hundred of the soldiers of misfortune were arrested and taken to Uniontown', the county seat, for trial.  Sixty-five men were sentenced to pay a five-dollar fine or serve five days in jail. Jeffries realized that the brief confinement was not all that bad.<br>
<br>
Failing in his legal efforts to get the men released, he and the remainder of his army continued to Washington, where in early August the long journey from Pike Street in Seattle to Pennsylvania Avenue ended."'<br>
<br>
In the race to reach Capitol Hill, Jumbo won handily, but under very suspicious circumstances and at the cost of leaving embittered members of his original army scattered all the way to Great Fails and beyond.  Having apparently traveled east from Chicago by regular<br>
coach, Cantwell and a handful of followers recruited from the Mid-
west reached Washington in time to participate in Browne's July 4.
<br>
funeral for the Goddess of Liberty.<br>
<br>
They brought a promise of many more troops to follow.  But Jumbo could be thankful that the national wire services were no longer carrying news of the Coxey movement, for he could regale people in Washington with tales of his western adventures without fear of contradiction until his wife or some of his followers from the Pacific Northwest arrived.  Then the final story of the mess he had created in Montana would leak out, and the reason for the sudden switch of roles with his wife would become clear.'<br>
<br>
The circumstances that led to Jumbo's downfall originated in Spo-
kane.  True to form, the big man grabbed the headlines as he made his way east from Spokane toward Great Fails, where his army planned to rendezvous.  But if the press was correct, the "sporting man" had a rendezvous of another sort in mind, and it was not with his men or his wife.  While his devoted followers were beating their way to central Montana by boxcar and stolen train, Jumbo went by coach in the company of Hilda Steen, a teenager he had met in Spokane.<br>
<br>
Steen, according to witnesses, was a tail, blue-eyed beauty who had been introduced to Jumbo at a Home Guard meeting, found him quite appealing, and indicated a desire to accompany him east.<br>
<br>
Spokane papers made the most of the episode,, especially the inci-
dent in the village of Havre, where the pair was to change trains for Great Falls.  In Havre, Jumbo reportedly pulled out a pistol and threatened the young girl if she tried to return home.  Responding to reporters who inquired about the altercation, Jumbo provided a plausible explanation for their friendship and the quarrel; but the story grew.<br>
<br>
One Spokane woman wired ahead to a Methodist minister in Great Falls saying that friends of the girl "feel it is our duty to do all we can to save them from eternal ruin." But Cantwell had already sent Hilda back from Havre.  Upon reaching Great Falls, he denounced reports that he had had "criminal relations" with a teenager, and offered $100 to any one  who could prove him wrong.",<br>
<br>
Waiting for Jumbo in Great Falls were hundreds of his half-starved followers, who ever since Spokane had grown increasingly disillu-
sioned with the big man.  Also awaiting him in Great Falls was his -advance guard," who had just returned from Chicago.  What<br>
Carlotta said to Jumbo about the Spokane teenager went unrecorded, but at this point the two switched roles.  Jumbo now traveled ahead to act as the army's advance guard, his steps no doubt quickened by rumors of an arrest warrant following close behind.<br>
<br>
Carlotta could have abandoned her husband and the whole depressing enterprise at this point, but instead she summoned up the inner strength to fulfill a prophecy she had made earlier in Puyallup.  Jumbo, she had declared, might fall by the wayside, but she was
going through.  To the men who were experiencing hard times, Carlotta was nothing less than an angel of mercy.<br>
<br>
"The men were not ashamed to be under her control,, "' reported one, "as it was not a case of petticoat tyranny." She nursed the sick to health, and in towns along the way she spent her fortune renting empty structures to house her followers.<br>
<br>
She and her eight-year-old daughter Mabel staged benefit perfor-
mances to raise money for food.  Carlotta sang a lament for poor workingmen called "After the Fail, "' patterned after a popular song, and Mabel sang too and then passed the hat.  Colonel, the Saint Bernard, solicited by carryiny a little bucket in his mouth.<br>
<br>
"His large, full brown eyes were often suffused with tears at the suffering and helplessness he beheld among the big, husky, hungry men in the army," the Tacoma News later recalled.  "But woe to anyone who tried to rob his bucket."' Stories of Carlotta's kindness reached the Coxeyites camped in Washington, D.C., and they eagerly awaited her arrival.<br>
<br>
"The men of the army are anxious to see her and admire her for her bravery and self-devotion to the cause," reported the Washington Post.  When she arrives, "a royal welcome will be extended her by all the members of the industrial army.  This will be partly due to the reports of her good deeds which have preceded her and also on account of the fact that she was brave enough to organize an army of unemployed workmen and champion their cause."<br>
<br>
On July 15 a telegram reached Washington, stating that Carlotta would arrive two days later, bringing 250 men.  Two days passed.  A newspaper reported her in the Washington suburb of Georgetown.  Another placed her just across the Potomac in Virginia.  More days passed and still she did not appear.  "Where is General Mrs. Jumbo?" the Washington papers asked."'<br>
<br>
At the time she was expected to make a triumphal entry, Carlotta was three thousand miles removed from the city on the Potomac. She was indeed nearing Washington-but it was Washington state.  "Mrs.  General, as she was carred by her followers, had arrived in Great Falls to find her husband's troops languishing along the banks of the Missouri, suffering from a lack of shoes, and near starvation.<br>
She immediately set about to rebuild the army's morale and physical strength.  "But what uphill work it is for me.  Oh, the irony of fate! Twelve hundred men depending on one woman and a child for food, clothes, etc."<br>
<br>
She got the men as far as Chicago, where her health gave out.  The swelling in her hands and feet became so severe that she could hardly walk.  Heeding the advice of a physician, she headed home to
Tacoma, though she planned to rejoin her "boys" if her health improved.<br>
<br>
A few days after she returned to Tacoma, several hundred Home Guards gathered to hear her story.  "Mrs.  General" appeared on stage wearing an evening dress of black lace, a red rose corsage, and sparkling diamonds on her ears and fingers.  Accompanying her were her daughter Mabel, who sang and recited, and the Saint Bernard, who lent dignity to the proceedings.<br>
<br>
Being a woman, Carlotta noted during her talk, had enabled her to accomplish more than a man might have done.  She found North Dakota the toughest state to cross, while Washington was "a picnic." The audience took up a small collection for the cause.<br>
<br>
Harry Holmes, one of the men in her command, returned to Tacoma a few months later.  He praised Carlotta, but damned Jumbo for exploiting the men while he went around giving lectures that swelled his "wad." According to Holmes and others, the big man fi-
nally stole the army's treasury and fled to South America.<br>

COXEY'S ARMY<br>
<br>
Leslie M. Scott, "Coxey's Army," <B>History of the Oregon Country.</B> Cambridge: Riverside Press, 1924. Volume III, p. 222.<br>
<br>
In the early part of 1894, numerous "armies" of unemployed were "marching" to Washington, D.C., to petition Congress for issuance of $500,000 non-interest-beaxing bonds for improvement of roads- the object being to afford employment for idle men.  The movement was headed by Jacob S. Coxey, of Massillon, Ohio, who in November, 1893, announced that he intended to lead 100,000 men to the national capital.<br>
<br>
Coxey left Massillon March 25, 1894, with his followers, reached Washington May 1, attempted to make a speech frorg the Capitol steps, and was axeested and imprisoned twenty days for stepping on the grass.<br>
<br>
Oregon and Washington had numerous "commonweal" companies of this "army," the members of which Mr. Scott severely scored in The Ore-
gonian, calling them "herds of vagrants." Mr. Scott asserted that the men should malce employment for themselves at tasks which the country needed done, and should not be fastidious about the kind of work available, the pay or the hours of employment.  The " armies " retorted with threats of riots.
On April 27, 1894, an " army" at Troutdale, Oregon, some eighteen miles west of Portland, seized a train of the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company and started for Washington, D.C. Their train was halted at Arlington, Oregon, by United States cavalry troops sent from Walla Walla, on orders from President Cleveland.<br>
<br>
The troops brought the "army" before the United States district court at Portland, where Judge C. B. Bellinger reprimanded some 439 members and released them.  A mob of Coxey followers, incensed by the denunciatory articles of The Oregonian, surrounded the establishment of that newspaper on April 30, 1894.<br>
<br>
While the mob was clamoring, Mr. Scott was writing a denunciatory editorial which was published next morning.  Friends of the editor, reaxing for his personal safety, surrounded him in The Oregonian building at Sixth and Alder streets, armed with rifles.  The mob dispersed without violence.<br>

COXEYS ARMY<br>
<br>
John P. Hartman, "The Coxey Army invasion of Puyallup," <B>Building a State.</B> Tacoma: Washington State Historical Society, 1939, p. 543-
546.<br>
<br>
During all of 1894 employment in Washington was at a low ebb.  Many loggers, sailors, fishermen, and miners were unemployed and hungry.  Unrest became very pronounced in the Puget Sound and Grays Harbor areas, with disturbing elements largely in Aberdeen, Tacoma, Seattle, Everett and Bellingham.<br>
<br>
Street curbers were nightly haranguing the crowds against the "haves," often urging violence.  Trouble was imminent.   The foundation for a new and radical political Party was being laid and urged at all meetings.  Immediate conscription of wealth was freely advocated.  This advocacy was nation-wide.  Free coinage of silver at 16 to 1 was a leading fetish.<br>
<br>
Jacob Coxey, a large scale breeder of and dealer in thoroughbred horses in Ohio, capitalized the nation-wide agitation, offering to lead a large "army" to the President and present "a petition with boots on," demanding money, food, jobs and "Equal distribution of all wealth."<br>
<br>
In the middle eighties, a saloon-keeper, Morgan, enlarged his place on Pacific Avenue in Tacoma by adding a dance hall, beer
slingers, and women upstairs, and called it the Theatre Comique; but this closed with his death in late '89.  His bouncer was Jumbo Cantwell, a prize ring favorite, who later married Morgan's widow.<br>
<br>
The restless element in western Washington organized in several places and agreed to rendezvous at Puyallup, form a permanent organization and march to the National Capitol.  Mostly they came on the train "brakes." On arrival "Jumbo," an ardent leader, was elected captain and ordered to secure a free box car train on the Northern Pacific to carry the bunch to St. Paul.<br>
<br>
In the '88 boom, speculators at Puyallup had started a three-story hotel, but got no farther than the frame, siding, roof and rough floors.  The men arrived in early March, 1894, 3,500 strong <B>and without let took possession of the hotel</B> as their home.<br>
<br>
Each morning, under orders from the commander, delegations went about the town, calling on housewives to prepare food and have it ready by four o'clock for delivery. If not done, trouble would arise.  The women complied.  The town was terrorized.  The gang numbered double the population.<br>
<br>
Demand was made upon Ezra Meeker and J. P. Stewart to put up money.  Each refused.  Threats were made against these two and others, and dire things promised if the bunch were not fed and given a train.  The Northern Pacific refused the train, which left the citizens facing a further terror.<br>
<br>
These people were backed and urged on by undisclosed radical leaders, who there evolved the political campaign for 1896, which later nominated a full state ticket at the famous "haystack" convention in Ellensburg and swept the state by a 13,000 majority, choosing Bryan over McKinley.  The party name was Anti monopoly Democratic Silver Republicans.<br>
<br>
Finally, courageous Governor John H. McGraw was induced to visit Puyallup to confer with the citizens at the home of Ezra Meeker and lay plans to relieve the terror.  The governor Was told by Cantwell to force the Northern Pacific to give the "army" a train, but if he failed he would not be governor very long.  However, these men did not realize that Governor McGraw feared no man.<br>
<br>
The governor determined that he would face the bunch at the theater, but wanted one man only to accompany him.  This man he selected.  On arrival he found the place packed with 600 to 700.  Commander Cantwell was on the platform, accompanied by his wife, adorned with flashing diamonds and a beautiful seal-skin coat.<br>
<br>
Everybody was vociferous in demanding the train, threatening dire results if it wasn't granted.  Speakers harangued fully thirty minutes.  Cantwell was a superb bluffer, with a real flow of language.  This was his third day in command.
Then the Governor walked to the platform front, unintroduced and looked the mass squarely in the face showing unquestioned courage and determination. In truth his appearance was leonine.<br>
<br>
Soon it was clear that the mob was at bay rather than the Governor.  Looking the crowd over he recognized a number of personal friends who had forsaken their jobs in barber shops, logging camps, etc., to join the mob; and, after a ten-minute silent survey, he started by singling them out, one after the other, by their given names.<br>
<br>
He told those whom he knew that they had each left a good job, had been forced to do so under threats.  Governor McGraw made the most eloquent plea of his life, and handled the chaps without gloves, telling them frankly and pointedly that he would do nothing for them, that all were guilty of criminal acts, that they should return to their homes; but if they did not break up and leave on the morrow he would call the State Militia and had already arranged with the U. S. Army Commandant at Fort Vancouver to send his entire command, if necessary, to clear the town.  He called the bunch a mob, led by a man. whose reputation was not worthy.<br>
<br>
Gradually the crowd began to leave the hall.  At 9:30 when the Governor ceased, the hall was not half full.  Without any noise or demonstration they departed, leaving the Governor and his friend alone on the platform.  A few of the men beat their way on the trains east, while the large majority returned to their homes.  In three days the town was normal.<br>
<br>
Thus a dangerous human tide was successfully stemmed at its source, sanity enthroned and order established, all due to Washington's truly great governor.  Today our citizens cannot fully appreciate the worth of what was done by Governor McGraw, who risked his life to stop a movement that, unchecked, would undoubtedly have led to bloodshed and loss of life.<br>
<br>
This event created a crisis in the political and commercial circles of Washington.  The immediate trouble was met by a real man, who stopped what might have been a most dangerous and regrettable affair, for many of the marchers had threatened to destroy both life and property.<br>
<br>
Nothing  has  ever  occurred  in  the  state  that  endangered<br>
more the future good and safety of all than the gathering of<br>
the Coxey Army.  When the solution at Puyallup was telegraphed over the country, other similar gatherings melted.<br>
<br>
Finally, "General" Jacob Coxey, on his one-ton Percheron stallion, did ride up to the White House door, but attended by less than 1,000 followers and not 10,000 as he promised throughout the
nation's press.  Thus the affair ended, locally and nationally, in a dismal failure, due to the prompt and vigorous action taken at Puyallup.<br>

COXEYS ARMY IN IDAHO<br>
<br>
Carlos A. Schwantes, "Law and disorder, the suppression of Coxeys Army in Idaho," <B>Idaho Yesterdays.</B> XXV (Summer, 1981) p. 10-15, 18-
25.<br>
<br>
Idaho is not often thought of as a state significantly involved in major American protest movements.  But the depression of the early 1890's hit the Northwest hard, and the remarkable "march"of Coxey's Army of protest across the country confronted its most significant legal barriers in Idaho.  Professor Schwantes, a member of the history department at Walla Walla College, is working on a history of the Coxey's Army movement<br>
<br>
Reports from the Coeur d'Alene  mining   district   in   mid-May    of  1894 were disturbing -none more serious than the telegram Idaho federal judge James H. Beatty received on the 16th from deputy United States marshal W. S. Sims.  The industrial violence that had convulsed the area in 1892 appeared ready to erupt once more.<br>
<br>
Sims described social tensions there as "worse than two years ago" and feared he was "powerless" to prevent trouble should a spark ignite the state's infamous tinderbox of labor management conflict.  The spark he frost dreaded was the Coxey's Army movement, which had suddenly assumed menacing proportions throughout the northwest.<br>
<br>
Sims and the Coeur d'Alene mineral kings were particularly concerned about the support the Coxeyites enjoyed among union miners and townspeople who bitterly resented the domination of their lives by mine an-i railroad owners.  An alarmed Beatty, sharing Sims's fears, immediately requested federal troops-advising that "the situation in Coeur d'Alene is perilous."<br>
<br>
He hoped that posting soldiers in potential trouble spots would prevent the killing he expected at any moment.  The federal government ultimately stationed four companies of troops in the mining region to protect the life and property supposedly threatened by the Coxeyites; but no one in Idaho, or other parts of the West where similar troubles occurred, imagined how difficult it would be to suppress this movement.<br>

More than anything else, the "Coxeyite war" of 1894 demonstrated the difficulty of upholding the law in a hostile environment, a situation that forced Judge Beatty and his counterparts in other states and territories to play leading roles in a most unusual confrontation between the nation's frontier past and its industrial future.<br>
<br>
The Coxey's Army movement that alarmed Beatty and numerous other Americans originated in the spring of 1894.  The nation's jobless, made destitute and desperate by the worst depression in memory, formed themselves into industrial armies (or Commonweals) and vowed to deliver a protest to President Grover Cleveland and<br>
Congress a message that could not be ignored.  Few if any Americans had ever witnessed a more bizarre crusade.<br>
<br>
From points as widely scattered as Boston, Seattle, and Los Angeles, from every region but the South, twenty or more armies of protest marched toward the nation's capital.  Five of the largest and most troublesome contingents originated in the sparsely settled but economically devastated Pacific Northwest.'<br>
<br>
During the latter part of April, 1894, large armies massed in Portland and Butte and a thousand or more men comprising three armies congregated in Spokane, just across the Washington border from the volatile Coeur d'Alene region.  Beginning in the second week of May, companies of Coxeyites (also called "industrials" and "wealers") started eastward from Oregon and Washington across Idaho.<br>
<br>
The Portland army, led by stonemason S. L. Scheffler, followed the route of the Union Pacific Railroad across the southern part of the state through such communities as Weiser, Payette, Caldwell, Nampa, Pocatello, and Montpelier.  Members of the three Washington armies distributed themselves over several railroad lines that crossed near or through the Coeur d'Alene region as they made their way to Helena, where they planned to regroup.<br>
<br>
Many people anticipating their passage feared widespread destruction and worried about the motives of the men who led the protest.<br>
<br>
Jacob S. Coxey bestowed his name upon the industrial army movement by leading a well publicized band of two or three hundred followers from Massillon, Ohio, to Washington, D.C. Arduous as Coxey's four-hundred-mile march was, it seemed almost a Sunday school outing compared to the cross-country trek of the unemployed from Portland or Puget Sound to Pennsylvania Avenue, some twenty-five hundred miles as the crow flies.<br>
<br>
And Pacific Northwest Coxeyites never marched as the crow flies.  They followed railway lines that threaded the narrow canyons and mountain passes of the Cascades and Rockies, and sometimes they
stole rides on passing trains.  Occasionally they stole the trains themselves.  People called the soldiers of misfortune a petition with boots on and wondered what they portended.<br>
<br>
Was it work alone that the marchers wanted, or were they the vanguard of revolution? "We can't overthrow the government, "explained General E. J. Jeffries of the Seattle contingent.  "We don't want to. All we want is to run it a while ourselves." Full of incendiary talk and law-defying bravado, the swashbucklers from the West gave the entire protest an ominous appearance."<br>
<br>
Newspaper accounts of a bloody battle between Coxeyites and federal marshals for possession of a Northern Pacific freight train in Yakima, Washington, and the commandeering by industrials just east of Portland of a special train used by the Union Pacific's general manager conditioned Idaho readers to expect the worst when the armies entered their state.<br>
<br>
In most instances, however, Coxeyites proved far less fearsome in the flesh then in print.  When a contingent passed through Bonners Ferry, curious citizens did not find the "mean looking set of men" they anticipated.  They recognized among the industrials many who had in more prosperous times worked for the Great Northern Railway.<br>
<br>
Future Idaho senator William E. Borah encountered some Coxeyites during a trip from Caldwell to Boise and was surprised to find, instead of the mob of hobos he expected, a group of educated, fairly well dressed men.  They were patriotic too.  Setting up camp at Caldwell, they first unfurled an American flag, saluted with uplifted hands, and swore to protect and defend it.<br>
<br>
Each man wore a red, white, and blue badge and carried a membership card that pledged him to uphold the Constitution and the law.<br>
<br>
The people of Bonners Ferry, who donated flour. bacon, potatoes, and other foodstuffs to the industrials, "enjoyed the visit of the modern crusaders immensely... and thought the occasion "as good as a circus." Coxeyites making their way through Coeur d'Alene mining towns benefitted from similar displays of public generosity.  When General Jeffries addressed a gathering of people from Gem and Burke, listeners greeted his every phrase with deafening applause and contributed liberally to the protest.<br>
<br>
Enthusiastic metal miners in the Wallace area pressed wads of money into the hands of march leaders.  Other indications of support occurred in southern Idaho communities.  Weiser citizens, for example, fed this Coxeyites breakfast, then gave them three rousing cheers.  Industrials returned the cheers, unfurled three American flags, and fell in for the march to Payette.<br>
<br>
Cynics claimed that Coxeyites intimidated townspeople into feeding
them, but others disputed that.  "The Coxey men are fed every where," noted the Emmett, Idaho, Index, "and it is not altogether from fear either." The Index believed citizens supported the industrial army movement because they heartily shared its condemnation of the "unwise, unjust and class legislation" passed in recent years by Congress, legislation that many believed benefitted the nation's new moneyed elite at the expense of wage earners and small farmers.<br>
<br>
"It is not strange that Coxeyism is here.  It is strange that it delayed its coming so long."<br>
<br>
The many donations of food, money, and temporary lodging easily convinced Coxeyites in the Pacific Northwest that they spoke for all people battered by the depression.  Displays of popular support, industrials told their hosts, "give us heart, cheer us on our way and make us determined to brave all obstacles."<br>
<br>
The most formidable obstacle was the law as personified by federal marshals assigned to keep marchers from stealing train rides, but<br>
Coxeyites counted on sympathetic townspeople to overawe the marshals.  Besides, many people were not convinced that it was really a crime to steal rides or even the trains themselves.<br>
<br>
They remembered the frauds perpetrated on the public by railroad promoters and stock jobbers.  "Stealing trains nowadays," observed the Spokane Chronicle, "is almost as popular as stealing railroads was a few years ago." Such comments brought knowing smiles from westerners who had for years resented the power of the rail barons, questioned their financial ethics, and disputed the legality of their title to vast stretches of the public domain.  Thus to a good many people the frustration of the railroads at the hands of the Coxeyites was well-deserved punishment.'<br>
<br>
Managers of the several transcontinental railroads serving the Pacific slope squirmed uneasily and pondered the Coxeyites' widespread popular support when confronted by marchers demanding transportation.  The industrial armies that formed on the West Coast realized from the beginning the futility of walking all the way to Washington, D.C., and instead requested that railroads grant them special charity rates.<br>
<br>
Many expressed a willingness to ride in clean cattle cars if necessary.  Railroad managers had essentially three choices: comply with the marchers' demands for cheap fares, refuse their demands but look the other way if they stole rides on empty freight cars, or charge regular coach rates and eject those who attempted to ride without paying (which proved an almost impossible task where the public sympathized with the Coxeyites).'<br>
<br>
The first western railroad to grapple with the problem of transporting Coxeyites was the Southern Pacific, which operated a line from Oakland, California, to a connection with the Union Pacific at Ogden, Utah.  It granted charity rates to San
Francisco-area Coxeyites, thereby evoking a storm of protest in Utah and demonstrating the perils of hauling such unusual cargo.<br>
<br>
Citizens of Utah who feared that the unemployed of California were about to be dumped in Ogden took legal steps to stop the Southern Pacific.  Railroad spokesmen defended their low rates as a humane act that had to be done regardless of the legal effect.  The unfortunate men wanted to get on the road toward their homes and we helped them.  If the law wants to punish us for that, I guess we can stand it.<br>
<br>
The Southern Pacific, feared and hated by many Californians as a financial octopus, did not really have a bigger heart then other western lines, just a fatter pocketbook.  Therein lies a paradox.  The Union Pacific and Northern Pacific, so rich in history but so impoverished by the depression of 1893, both entered receivership, a legal device that in effect made them wards of the court in order to prevent their dismemberment by creditors.<br>
<br>
Trustees thus refused to provide Coxeyites special rates and appealed to federal judges in the states that they served to enjoin the industrials from stealing rides on their trains.  Compliant judges in all the northwestern states quickly granted their requests and directed federal marshals to secure enough deputies to enforce the injunctions.  The unlucky Coxeyites caught riding one of their trains without a bona fide ticket could be jailed for contempt of court.<br>
<br>
This was a novel use of the injunction, and it allowed the Union Pacific and Northern Pacific lines to wrap themselves in the protection of federal courts and marshals-a protection the Southern Pacific could not claim when it agreed to transport Coxeyites to Ogden at charity rates.<br>
<br>
Managers of the Union Pacific and Northern Pacific lines were soon dismayed to learn, however, that court injunctions and platoons of deputy marshals only complicated their struggle with t,he Coxeyites.  Perhaps they even wondered if the Southern Pacific had not demonstrated the better course after all.<br>
<br>
The railroads' problems seemed greatest in those parts of the West where they held the most power.  The reason is obvious.  Not only were their passenger, freight, and express services often the sole links to the outside world but their rate-making authority gave them ability to prosper one community and blight another.  In short, railroads dominated the lives of townspeople to a degree unthinkable after the coming of the automobile and publicly financed highways, and many citizens resented it.<br>
<br>
Union Pacific and Northern Pacific managers knew the popular hostility and expected their federal protectors to free them from dependence upon local law officers who generally shared the community viewpoint.  In many cases, the alliance of the federal
government with the railroads only increased public sympathy for the injunction defying underdogs who wanted simply to ride eastward unmolested.<br>
<br>
Railroad officials also worried about their own employees' sympathies with the Coxeyites.  On the Great Northern-a financially healthy line that, like the Southern Pacific, enjoyed no federal court protection section men hurried a band of Coxeyites across the Idaho state line into Montana on their handcars and thus helped them elude and delay the sheriff.  Federal deputies had to be assigned to ride every Northern Pacific freight through Idaho "to see that the railroad men do not connive to defeat the order of the court and aims of the deputies," and Union Pacific officials admitted to Judge Beatty that "there is no disguising the fact that a large part of our trainmen sympathize with these Coxeyites."<br>
<br>
In the Pocatello area some of the strongest defenders of the Coxeyites were Union Pacific workers, many of whom were members of the Knights of Labor.  The railroad threatened to dismiss track workers who <B>hooted </B>and jeered a trainload of deputy marshals passing through the Pocatello yard; when a young fireman mistook a deputy marshal for a Coxeyite and offered him a ride to Montpelier in an empty boxcar, the Union Pacific suspended him for two weeks "in order to give him time to work off his surplus sympathy.""<br>
<br>
Given the popular hostility that deputy marshals aroused in trying to protect railroad property, their lot was a most unhappy one.  After a peaceful group of Coxeyites arrived at Weiser, a local newspaper commented sarcastically that "some snipes with big, long guns and commissions as U. S. marshals also slowed up to protect railroad property from the desperate and blood-thirsty band of insurrectionists."<br>
<br>
In northern Idaho, deputies were popularly regarded as tools of the mining interests dogging the heels of innocent Coxeyites.  On a very isolated section of Northern Pacific track near Clark Fork, according to one rumor, federal marshals arrested a band of industrials who had stolen a handcar and headed east, but thirty or more bystanders brandishing revolvers disarmed the marshals and freed the Coxeyites.<br>
<br>
Another potentially bloody clash occurred when marshals attempted to eject industrials from a train bound for Wallace.  One Coxeyite grabbed up stones to fight back but was shot through the arm by a deputy alleged to be the son of Idaho governor William J. McConnell.  Tensions ran high throughout the Coeur d'Alene mining district.<br>
<br>
A local newspaper, the Gem Silver Star, called the shooting "doubtless the most cold blooded attempt to commit murder" in Shoshone County, hinted that young McConnell was lucky the populace did not lynch him, and argued he "ought to have a life sentence at hard labor." This was one example of the social tension that so worried Judge Beatty and the mine owners and rail operators who
beseeched him to get federal troops sent to the area.<br>
<br>
Ironically Idaho's most significant outburst of industrial army violence occurred not in the Coeur d'Alene region where it seemed so imminent but in the southeastern corner of the state, and it was there that federal troops were first used in Idaho's "Coxeyite war." It was not, however, the first encounter between Uncle Sam's army and Scheffler's army."<br>
<br>
When members of Scheffler's army crossed the Snake River bridge from Oregon into Idaho, they had already earned an advanced degree in train stealing.  Barred from Union Pacific trains headed east from Portland, Scheffler's men marched twenty miles along the right of way to Troutdale.  There on April 28 they defied an injunction and commandeered a special train being used by the railroad's general manager, E. Dickinson.<br>
<br>
The Coxeyites, with federal marshals in hot pursuit, steamed east for more than 120 miles before being stopped at Arlington by cavalrymen rushed from Fort Walla Walla. The military escorted its prisoners to Portland for trial.  Oregon's federal judge Charles B. Bellinger was a kindly man who saw no point in jailing the protesters despite their defiance of his injunction.  After securing their promise not to steal trains, he freed them."'<br>
<br>
Bellinger's leniency surprised the Union Pacific and threw it on the defensive.  It virtually gave up trying to prevent Coxeyites from stealing rides on its trains in Oregon.<br>
<br>
Scheffler's army thus resumed its march by climbing onto break beams and empty cars at night.  Because railwaymen ignored their illicit presence, many Coxeyites assumed that the Union Pacific had tacitly agreed to help them reach Kansas City, the railroad's eastern terminus.  The Union Pacific, however, knew that the Coxeyites must soon cross into Idaho, Judge Beatty's district.  Protected in Idaho by a new injunction and squads of deputy marshals, the railroad prepared to take a firm stand.<br>
<br>
The advance guard of Scheffler's army had scarcely passed the Snake River bridge into Idaho before the Union Pacific attempted to throw them off its cars.  It stopped its trains; when Coxeyites alighted, deputy United States marshals read them the injunction Judge Beatty had issued on May 8 and threatened to arrest them should they try to reboard.<br>
<br>
The railroad's action stranded the Coxeyites and angered townspeople along its line.  Caldwell citizens held a public meeting, passed a resolution of sympathy for Scheffler's men, and censured the Union Pacific for bringing the Coxeyites into the community and refusing to take them out.  The people of Weiser petitioned Governor McConnell to send relief for the industrials, but the governor coldly replied that he had no funds to feed hungry men because Democrats and Populists who controlled the last state legislature had refused to make any appropriations for contingent expenses.  
A "nice little campaign speech," snorted the Caldwell Argus.  MCconnell was not noted for his sympathy "for starving workers," added the Idaho World.  In fact, neither McConnell nor Union Pacific officials were really sure what course of action to follow.  No precedent existed for dealing with a problem the size of Coxey's Army.<br>
<br>
After enduring public condemnation for two days, Union Pacific managers again reversed themselves and grudgingly agreed to haul the Coxeyites in small groups.  Scheffler's men took immediate advantage of the railroad's offer and headed for Pocatello, where they planned to regroup and add thirty local Coxeyites waiting to join their ranks.<br>
<br>
Citizens collected four hundred pounds of meat and four hundred loaves of bread in anticipation of their arrival, but city officials grew apprehensive upon learning that an unexpectedly large group of two hundred fifty men was due from the west and urged the Union Pacific to take them through without stopping.  Coxeyites shot through Pocatello with their flags flying. Towns people forwarded provisions to nearby McCammon, where industrials picked them up before proceeding to Montpelier."<br>
<br>
At Montpelier, a division point where crews changed and trains were serviced, Coxeyites climbed off to enjoy what they expected to be a brief rest stop.  But Union Pacific officials had concluded that "it was a great mistake to allow these men to occupy our trains." After reexamining every possible way to thwart the freeloaders, including destroying railroad property to block the track, they decided the time had come for a showdown and ordered crews to sidetrack all trains carrying Coxeyites.<br>
<br>
Several hundred industrials thus found themselves stranded in Montpelier, and the meat and bread donated by Pocatello citizens would not feed the hungry army very long.<br>
<br>
The next day, May 13, a group of about fifty industrials comprising Company H concluded that if the railroad would not haul them, they would simply have to haul themselves.  They had already learned how: before the depression cost them their jobs, several had worked as locomotive engineers and firemen.<br>
<br>
Forgetting their pledge to Judge Bellinger and ignoring the injunction of Judge Beatty, they stole an engine and steamed out of Montpelier into Wyoming to a point near Cokeville, a distance of about thirty miles.  There they abandoned their engine and calmly retired into the sagebrush wilderness to pitch camp.<br>
<br>
They could easily have gone on to Green River, but by stopping near Cokeville they acted as if they expected the Union Pacific to reverse its policy once again.   They also seemed convinced that federal marshals would make no attempt to pursue and arrest them.<br>

Telegraph wires along the right of way pulsed with messages of alarm darting back and forth between railroad and government officials, from Idaho to Wyoming and Washington, D.C. Senders carefully encoded their words to prevent the several experienced telegraphers in Scheffler's army from eavesdropping.  Had the men of Company H been able to decipher the peculiar pattern of dots and dashes, they would have overheard several urgent requests for federal troops and learned that one trainload of marshals was speeding west from Cheyenne, another east from Boise.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, people in Montpelier anticipated the next act with mounting apprehension.  As the Coxeyite drama in Idaho neared it climax, the problem of upholding the law in a hostile environment was increasingly obvious.<br>
<br>
On the morning of May 14 the large group of industrials stranded in Montpelier began making plans to follow the example of the advance guard.  When an eastbound mail train rolled into town, they clambered aboard; crewmen followed the orders of management, uncoupled the engine, and left the Coxeyites sitting.<br>
<br>
At about 10:45, Scheffler's men were surprised to see a special train bearing Joseph Pinkham, United States marshal for Idaho; thirty deputies; and E. E. Calvin, a Union Pacific division superintendent from Pocatello.  Pinkham once again read Beatty's restraining order to the Coxeyites and warned that anyone stealing aboard a train would be shot, but industrials paid no attention.<br>
<br>
Montpelier's mayor and a group of concerned citizens called a special town meeting to demand that Pinkham and Calvin allow the Coxeyites to move on.  Pinkham responded that the court had tied his hands.  He read Beatty's restraining order to his listeners and asked if they would be willing to help round up the Coxeyites that he planned to arrest and send west for trial.<br>
<br>
One of his hearers, saloon  keeper John F. O'Connor, jumped to his feet and shouted that he would never help arrest men whose only crime was that they were broke.  The audience applauded vigorously, the meeting adjourned, and sullen townspeople filed out.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in the railroad yard, Coxeyites and deputies glared at each other.  When a freight train pulled into town that afternoon, industrials remembered Pinkham's threat and hesitated to board it, but a group of sympathizers shouted, "Climb on that train.  Climb on you fools.  They daren't shoot you." Dick Williams, local constable and formerly one of Pinkham's deputies, climbed atop one of the cars and shouted to the industrials "Follow me. I'll lead you to Washington.  I'll take you out."<br>
<br>
Impressed by Williams' bravado, Coxeyites rushed for the handhold and empty doors and swung aboard .<br>
<br>
Pinkham's men immediately arrested the army's new "general." As they
led Williams off to jail, he yelled to his troops, "Just wait a minute boys, and I'll be back.  We'll take this train out then, and if these sons of bitches follow us they will follow a trail of blood."<br>
<br>
Williams, also the town jailer, refused to produce his keys for the marshals and forced Pinkham to call the Bear Lake County sheriff to take the prisoner to a jail in nearby Paris.  The sheriff absolutely refused.  Reluctantly Pinkham and his deputies escorted Williams to Superintendent Calvin's special car.  A growing crowd of spectators watched as deputies dragged him up the steps and into the car where Williams struggled like a madman cursed his jailers, and shouted to the Coxeyites to free him.  Marshals finally clamped him in irons.<br>
<br>
"Come on boys! They've got Dick," someone yelled.  The crowd surged toward Calvin's car.  Instantly thirty Winchesters poked from its windows and Marshal Pinkham warned that he would shoot the first man on the car.  Williams continued to bellow.  Witnesses noticed Jack Westfall, a Bear Lake County deputy sheriff, rip open his shirt, wave his hat frantically, point to his chest, and shout, "Shoot me.  I'd just as lief die as see that man taken away from here."<br>
<br>
Turning to the crowd, he cried: "Come on boys, we'll get him." Brandishing coupling pins, clubs, stones, and any other weapon they could lay their hands on, sympathizers rushed toward the car; but before they could mount its steps, the train lurched and steamed west toward Pocatello.  With tears of rage streaming down their cheeks, members of the crowd Continued to yell until someone noticed that in their haste to depart the deputies had left Calvin behind.  "Catch him!" -and in a moment a hundred people chased after the superintendent.<br>
<br>
The imperiled Calvin happened to spot an idle switch engine, grabbed a handhold, sprang aboard, and raced out of town.  A couple of miles west he overtook the federal marshals, who had stopped to plan their next move.  Pinkham rather foolishly wanted to return immediately to Montpelier to arrest the ringleaders, but Calvin dissuaded him, arguing that the Coxeyites and their sympathizers far outnumbered the small force of deputies and any clash would result in a general killing." Pinkham agreed instead to wire for federal troops and retreated to Pocatello with his lone prisoner.  Several deputies disturbed by the confrontation resigned.<br>
<br>
Although excited Coxeyites in Montpelier talked of obtaining dynamite and firearms, they went instead to the roundhouse, took an engine and five empty boxcars, and steamed off to join their comrades in Wyoming.  The temporary victors in the showdown with federal law officers proudly displayed their American flags as they chugged slowly down the track.<br>
<br>
Union Pacific officials turned all signals red but the train nappers paid no attention.  The railroad contemplated pulling up track but decided instead to protect lives and property by sidetracking or rerouting all trains between Pocatello and Green River.  The Fossil,
Wyoming, telegraph. operator attempted to halt the Coxeyites by warning that the way ahead was blocked.<br>
<br>
They calmly replied that they would go through even if they had to lay track all the way to Green River.  Hoping to secure the protection of federal troops, railroad officials advised federal authorities that the Coxeyites were "running wild," though they admitted privately that the thieves knew what they were doing and were proceeding with great caution.  Beatty and Wyoming's federal judge John A. Riner beseeched Washington to send troops.<br>
<br>
After Wyoming's federal marshal J. P. Rankin and his deputies surprised and arrested the Coxeyites camped near Cokeville, the prisoners were taken to Green River, where law officers had captured the second party of train stealers.  Some industrials managed to slip away, but a group of one hundred fifty found themselves confined under the watchful eyes of deputy marshals backed up by two hundred seventy-five soldiers rushed from Fort Russell, near Cheyenne.<br>
<br>
Locked in empty boxcars, Schefflers men threatened to cause further trouble unless taken east.  Some attempted to escape by whittling through the wooden sides of the cars but dared not emerge when confronted by leveled weapons.  Other prisoners foolishly set their car afire in protest.  Guards quickly extinguished the blaze before Coxeyites extinguished themselves.<br>
<br>
Under cover of darkness, Scheffler's men embarked on their boldest escape plan yet.  Creeping unnoticed out of their quarters, they hid in the tufts of sage brush that ringed the soldier's camp.  At a given signal they rushed for the firearms stacked in front of the tents.  Startled soldiers got to the guns first, halted the prisoners, marched them back to their cars, and doubled the guard.<br>
<br>
Federal Officials were not sure what to do with so many troublemakers.  The Union Pacific  advised  that  because the  Coxeyites wanted  very  much  to  be  taken  east Cheyenne for trial, they should instead be returned to Boise.  Judge Riner went to Green River but concluded to take only fifteen ringleaders back to Cheyenne.<br>
<br>
Presumably the rest would go free.  Dismayed Union Pacific attorneys telegraphed Judge Beatty to extradite the men to Idaho, warning that unless he took effective steps, "nothing can prevent continued repetitions of these outrages and advance of numerous armies towards Washington." Beatty agreed .<br>
<br>
Late in the afternoon of May 16, Marshal Pinkham, a dozen deputies, and twenty-five regulars from Ft.  Boise started for Green River to extradite the Montpelier train stealers.  The marshal wired ahead, "I waive no jurisdiction over them.  The outrage against the law and the right of property was too vicious.  I want them back." Upon reaching Green River and looking over the motley crew of prisoners,
however, Pinkham concluded that he did not really want them all back.<br>
<br>
He worried that caring for them would be expensive, that there was no facility in Boise large enough to confine them, and that his small force of deputies was incapable of guarding so many troublemakers.<br>
<br>
Pinkham's proposal to take only forty prisoners to Boise angered Union Pacific solicitor John M. Thurston, who undertook to stiffen the marshal's backbone.  He wired railroad receiver E. Ellery Anderson to put pressure on Pinkham's superior, Attorney General Richard Olney.<br>
<br>
"These men are desperate," he added.  "It will be utterly impossible for Union Pacific to prevent eastward movement of great and growing exodus unless government United States will institute most vigorous policy." The attorney general's office ordered Pinkham to remove all remaining prisoners to Idaho and promised that the federal government would pay the expenses and provide troops to back up his deputies."'<br>
<br>
Pinkham transported the prisoners in sealed coaches under heavy guard.  They paused at Montpelier, where seemingly the whole town turned out to view the special train.  Sympathizers suddenly surged around the cars in an apparent effort to free the men, but deputies and soldiers warned them back.  The train stopped long enough at Pocatello for marshals to pick up Coxeyites and Montpelier citizens jailed earlier, including Dick Williams, Jack Westfall, and John O'Connor, the saloon keeper who had dared defend Coxeyites in the Montpelier town meeting."<br>
<br>
Pinkham arrived in Boise Saturday evening with a total of 158 prisoners.  After deputies fed each man a warm meal, they took Scheffler and the Montpelier citizens to the Ada County jail and herded the rest into a roundhouse and empty boxcars-quarters that Pinkham admitted " were not as comfortable as they should have been."<br>
<br>
A severe rainstorm made it impossible for him to quarter prisoners outside.  As in Pocatello and Montpelier, a good many townspeople sympathized with the underdog.  When Knights of Labor leader James R. Sovereign lectured in Boise the following day he drew a large crowd, which, according to the Idaho Statesman greeted every utterance adverse to the rich "with a thunder of applause." Rumors that sympathizers would attempt to free the prisoners kept infantrymen stationed near the roundhouse on the alert.<br>
<br>
Coxeyites had been confined to the roundhouse scarcely half a day before they sent a protest petition to Governor McConnell. lie visited them Sunday morning to see their living conditions for himself, and the man who had earlier blamed Democrats and Populists f,:)r making it impossible for him to help was visibly moved.  He
complained to Attorney General Olney that "they should  not be<br>
crowded like wild cattle into a pen without sleeping and sanitary accommodations."<br>
<br>
McConnell urged Olney to make federal officials supply Pinkham with beds and blankets so that he could more humanely care for the "misguided, unfortunate men." Pinkham angrily responded to Olney that McConnell's complaint was motivated by sympathy for the Coxeyite cause--an absurd allegation-but he agreed, nonetheless, to improve his prison.<br>
<br>
When the weather cleared, he allowed small groups of men to go outside where under the watchful eyes of deputies and infantrymen they frolicked on the grass like schoolboys on a picnic.  Meanwhile!, everyone speculated what Judge Beatty would do when he returned from holding court in <B>the </B>northern part of Idaho."<br>
<br>
Beatty, who looked upon Coxeyites as "deluded people" and believed that their "wild crusade" must be stopped, held several precedents he might follow.  Emulating Judge Bellinger, he might slap the industrials on the wrist and release them if they promised to steal no more rides.  This plan would keep expenses down and solve the problem of how to imprison so many men.<br>
<br>
But Beatty made no secret of his intense disapproval of what Bellinger had done, which he believed was an irresponsible attempt to foist the <B>unemployed</B> of Oregon onto the people of Idaho.<br>
<br>
Montana's federal judge Hiram Knowles and Wyoming's Riner had adopted the course of ending the ringleaders to jail and freeing the rank and file, and Beatty might do likewise.  Or he might take the radical step of jailing the whole lot; but that was impossible unless he found a place large enough to confine so many prisoners, and no such place existed in Idaho.<br>
<br>
Pressuring Beatty to crush the movement by imprisoning all the men were the Union Pacific and Richard Olney, who though attorney general of the United States continued to serve as one of the nation's leading railroad lawyers.<br>
<br>
The trial opened in Boise on May 28. Coxeyites marched from the round  house  to  the courthouse between lines of soldiers,   and<br>
Scheffler and the Montpelier defendants arrived from the county jail. United  States district attorney James H. Forney and Union Pacific attorney Parley L. Williams conducted the prosecution, and James H. Hawley and 0. E. Jackson the defense.<br>
<br>
First to be tried were five Montpelier citizens accused of encouraging Coxeyites to defy Beatty's injunction.  The judge early released saloon keeper O'Connor and   another Montpelier citizen for lack of evidence, saying he was convinced they acted as they did only to get the Coxeyites out of town.  Dick Williams' attempt to persuade Beatty that he was motivated by the same concern failed.<br>

The weather during the trial grew miserably hot and Soon the courtroom stank with the odor of more than one hundred fifty unwashed bodies.  The main drama of trial was the reconstruction of the circumstances that led Coxeyites to the showdown at Montpelier.  Defendants argued that leading citizens of Portland assured them that they had arranged for the Union Pacific to transport them to Kansas City.<br>
<br>
The railroad had allegedly agreed to look the other way, provided Scheffler's men traveled in small groups and pretended to be stealing rides despite the company's protests.  In addition, Portland citizens gave the advance guard, Company H, twenty dollars and four days' rations, enough to reach Idaho but not Kansas City.  Beatty interjected a vigorous condemnation of the self-serving callousness of the Portlanders, and some observers may have wondered if Schemer's men had gained the judge's sympathy.<br>
<br>
Defendants also argued that they had stolen the locomotives at Montpelier with the tacit approval of the Union Pacific.  They claimed railroad officials had told them that Wyoming law forbade the company from transporting paupers into the state, but the company had no objection if industrials used railroad property to haul themselves across the state line.<br>
<br>
Once in Wyoming the railroad would carry them as before.  Although there is no evidence in Union Pacific records to suggest that this discussion actually took place, the Coxeyites by their peculiar display of bravado and confidence upon entering Wyoming appeared to believe that such an arrangement had actually been made.<br>
<br>
The testimony of the Coxeyites occasionally evoked pathos.  Thomas Colehan, who escaped custody near Green River and got as far as Omaha before being captured and extradited to Idaho, noted that he had been very sick since leaving Portland.  When Beatty asked why he had not stopped some place or gone back instead of endangering his health by traveling in all kinds of weather, Colehan replied that he had no place to go back to.   Undoubtedly he spoke also for a good many of his codefendants<br>
<br>
S. L. Scheffler took the stand.  He corroborated the testimony of several others who argued that the Union Pacific had a reed to carry them-but added quickly, in an apparent effort to save his own neck, that he was not really the leader of the army, that he had relinquished his command during the time the army proposed to travel from Portland to Kansas City.  He had purchased a bona fide coach ticket to Kansas City and claimed to have accompanied the army across Idaho merely as custodian of its funds.<br>
<br>
Under further questioning, the reluctant general explained that the object of the march was to persuade Congress to provide work for Americas unemployed by funding an inter-oceanic canal across
Nicaragua, noting that the majority of Coxeyites were ready and willing to work."<br>
<br>
Beatty listened carefully to all testimony, periodically released a few Coxeyites for lack of evidence, and gave every indication that he was being scrupulously fair.  Thus the decision he announced on June 5 surprised many defendants.  He called the movement a conspiracy, meaning that each individual was responsible for anything said or done by anyone else to carry out the objectives of the conspiracy, and asserted that industrials knew fall well that their action were unlawful "or they would not attempt such ridiculous denials."<br>
<br>
He admitted that the Coxey's Army movement doubtless contained good men, but during the trial he had seen too many faces "which bore the indelible stamp of the criminal." He thus found every defendant guilty of contempt of court, the three citizens of Montpelier and privates as well as generals.  He sentenced everyone to prison: Scheffler and Williams for six months, Westfall and another Montpelier citizen for three months, and rank and-file Coxeyites for thirty to sixty days.  The court promised, however, to grant early releases to industrials who agreed to leave the state.<br>
<br>
Beatty then explained how he had solved the problem of confining so many prisoners.  He <B>returned </B>Scheffler to the Ada County jail and sent the Montpelier citizens to the Bingham County jail and two especially troublesome Coxeyites to the Canyon and Washington county jails.  But most ingenious was his plan for confining the 184 rank and file (the body of prisoners returned from Green River and Pocatello having been augmented by the arrest of 57 would-be train stealers near Nampa).<br>
<br>
Batty ordered Pinkham and his deputies to construct and operate a special prison in the <B>sa</B>ge brush wilderness where the Union Pacific <B>cr</B>ossed the Snake River from Oregon into Idaho.<br>
<br>
Beatty chose the locale for reasons both practical and symbolic.  He registered his disapproval of the actions of his Oregon colleague by sending prisoners as far west in Idaho and as close to Judge Bellinger's district as possible.  He also located the camp where it was most likely to discourage additional Coxeyites from entering Idaho from Oregon.<br>
<br>
It was rumored that as many as three thousand industrials planned to start east from Portland after Oregon's June 4 state election.) Summarizing his plan to Olney, Beatty explained, "I get them started back instead of forward and hope to continue them westward to their place of starting.""<br>
<br>
Worried that his plan of confinement might not work, Beatty requested help from both the federal government and the Union Pacific.  He warned Olney that "I must be sustained in what I have
done, or all will prove a failure" and thereby not stop the tide of unemployed that he believed Oregon was about to send east, and he asked that federal troops serve as guards.<br>
<br>
The role he wanted the Union Pacific to play was simple yet important.  Planning to release the Coxeyites in groups of five to ten men each, he expected the railroads to transport them west: "I am sure it will be far better for the railroad to carry them even at some inconvenience than that I turn them loose in bad temper to tramp and steal their way out."<br>
<br>
After considering briefly whether this request violated its policy of refusing to carry freeloaders, the Union Pacific consented.,,'<br>
<br>
By June 12 Pinkham was ready to move prisoners to the Snake River confinement, which some called "Camp Pinkham" and others more accurately labeled "Camp Despair." The large crowd that gathered at Boise's railroad depot was reminded of a stockyard as it watched deputies armed with rifles and six shooters herd Coxeyites into ten waiting boxcars and nail the doors shut.<br>
<br>
Nearby, infantrymen relaxed and watched the proceedings, the Army Department having refused to allow them to serve as guards.  It had agreed, however, to station troops at Camp Pinkham to back up Marshals in the event they proved unable to cope with prisoners.  A special train of twenty cars carried the industrials, two infantry companies, Pinkham and his thirty men, and lumber for housing to the Snake River bridge.<br>
<br>
Except for the bridge and the railway line that ran across it, the depressing wasteland of sand and sage was devoid of all signs of human habitation.  Crushed by the bleakness of confinement and the hopelessness of their cause, may Coxeyites sank into apathy and resignation.<br>
<br>
Others, burning with resentment, outrage, and a determination to escape, attacked deputies and turned on their former comrades.  Many camp conflicts were no doubt rooted in longstanding differences between Oregonians and a minority of Californians, mostly members of Company H, who had traveled from Oakland to Portland to join Scheffler's army.<br>
<br>
Their aggressive ways, displayed most spectacularly during the short confinement in Montpelier, irritated some Oregonians, and in the Snake River prison these tensions flared into open conflict.<br>
<br>
When one group of Coxeyites helped deputies erect wooden barracks for shelter, another group, presumably led by members of Company H, cursed and threatened to drown cooperators in the nearby river.  Marshals segregated cooperators and resisters on opposite sides of the track, but insults and abuse continued, especially when cooperators won special privileges and early releases.<br>
<br>
One group of resisters tunneled seventy feet out from beneath its
barracks before marshals discovered the potential escape route and forced them to fill it in.  Troublemakers savagely beat the supposed informer before guards stepped in, saved the man, and put the rest on a diet of bread and water.  Many supplemented their meager meals by catching an occasional fish.  Once in a while a passenger tossed prisoners a newspaper from a train window.<br>
<br>
Beatty released Coxeyites in small groups until, on September 1, he freed the last man.  The Union Pacific dutifully transported them to Portland. (The railroad later billed the federal government for this and other services it supposedly rendered without charge as its contribution to the "Coxeyite <B>war.")<br>
</B><br>
The Coxeyites who crossed northern Idaho generally fared better.  After running a gauntlet of federal marshals and deputy sheriffs, many reached the nation's capital, but their efforts to impress upon President Cleveland and Congress their need for work failed.<br>
<br>
In mid-August, after they had camped along the Potomac River opposite Washington for several weeks, the governor of Virginia lost his patience, dispatched the state militia to destroy their shanty town, and drove them across the river into the District of Columbia.  Officials there provided diehard Coxeyites free transportation to various cities in the midwest.  Most from the Pacific Northwest went to St. Paul, Minnesota, where they disbanded and disappeared.<br>
<br>
The suppression of Coxey's army in Idaho was only one act in a nationwide drama, but it <B>was </B>an important act.  No federal judge before Beatty had dared to sentence an entire army to prison.  His example may well have inspired a federal judge in Nebraska to use similar draconian measures to crush the last of the major industrial armies in the West, a contingent from Salt Lake City and Denver that stole aboard a Union Pacific train near Ogallala.  The wholesale imprisonment of eastern Coxeyites during June, not the arrest of Coxey on May 1 for walking on the Capitol grass, effectively ended the crusade.<br>
<br>
In the short run the industrial army movement failed; but what of its long-term significance? Americans were by no means of one opinion.  Some treated Coxeyism as a symptom of deep-seated social malaise such as f recedes a revolution.  For others it was merely comic relief from the serious business of the economic depression.<br>
<br>
Optimists regarded the movement as a positive sign of the nation's underlying strength, as "fresh evidence of the Elasticity of the American spirit.<br>
<br>
Whatever it meant, few could ignore the way Coxeyism highlighted the declining power of the local community to cope with the new economic realities of industrial America.  In earlier years the nation's unemployed would have turned to town fathers or local charities for help, but not this time.  "These men," observed economist Thorstein Veblen, who disapproved of the crusade, "disregard the fact of local
units and local relations with a facility which   bespeaks   their complete emancipation from the traditions of local self-government<br>
<br>
Conversely, the small-town loyalties that made workers a power in such places as Idaho s mining and railroad towns and created sympathy for the armies of unemployed also threatened the freedom of action prized by the nation's new breed of industrialists.<br>
<br>
Reaching out to state and federal officials for help in dealing with striking <B>workers </B>and insolent Coxeyites, they discovered new allies in their battle to extend corporate power into isolated and often hostile communities.  To undermine the pervasive localism that sustained workers' power, they used as their primary tool federal laws and courts.<br>
<br>
How ironic that many of the nation's opinion leaders denounced Coxeyite efforts to enlarge the function of the federal government as paternalistic, yet failed to regard federal protection of railroads as equally paternalistic."'<br>

The Coxeyites, the Seattle Press-Times editorialized, "are building more wisely than they know of.  An impression had been made on the national conscience, and once the national mind agrees upon the fact that a new direction must be given to affairs, there is no telling to what great and good ends it may lead."<br>
<br>
Forty years passed by before the Coxeyites realized their primary goal.  During the depression of the 1930's the federal government in its several New Deal programs accepted the responsibility for putting unemployed Americans to work.<br>

COXEY'S ARMY<br>
<br>
Marge Davenport, "Coxey's Army and Governor McGraw," <B>Fabulous Folks of the Old Northwest.</B> Tigard, Oregon: Wagonwheel Press, 1986, p. 29-
32.<br>
<br>
In 1894 a brave Washington State governor faced an angry mob of 3,500 that was terrorizing a town and he was able to send them home without bloodshed or loss of life.<br>
<br>
Washington State's courageous Governor John McGraw probably didn't get as much credit as he deserved for his bravery and accomplishments.  As King County Sheriff he controlled the riots against the Chinese in 1855 and as governor, he controlled Coxey's Army that had moved into Puyallup and was threatening violence.
Following the depression of 1893, unemployment was high in Washington.  Sailors, fishermen, miners and loggers were out of work and many were angry and hungry.  There was unrest all around Puget Sound.  Aberdeen, Seattle, Everett and Bellingham all were trouble spots with "street curbers" urging violence and haranging against the "haves." Trouble seemed imminent.<br>
<br>
This was the foundation for a new and radical political party nationwide.  The money standard of $16 silver to $1 gold also was an issue.<br>
<br>
A man called Jacob Coxey capitalized on the agitation and offered to lead a large "army" to the president to demand food, jobs and equal distribution of the wealth.  Coxey was from the south, but he called for followers nationwide.<br>
<br>
In Tacoma, another man named "Jumbo" Cantwell emerged as a Northwest leader in the unrest movement.  Jumbo was the bouncer at the Theatre Comique in Tacoma, a place that featured a dance hall, beer garden and women upstairs. jumbo had been a prize fighting favorite and he soon got the restless element in Washington organized.  They agreed to rendezvous at Puyallup, form a permanent organization and join the march on the national eapital.<br>
<br>
Most of the 3500 participants "rode the rails" there, but they managed to straggle in to Puyallup, a town of less than 1800 inhabitants at the time. jumbo duly was elected captain and ordered to secure a free box ear on the Northem Pacific Railroad to carry the "army" to the east.<br>
<br>
Then most of the 3500 moved into a partly rinisfied three-story hotel in Puyallup that had been started several years before the depression hit, but had never been completed.  Each morning a delegation went about town ealling on housewives to prepare food and have it ready for 4 o'clock delivery.  When they threatened violence, the women complied.  The town was terrified.<br>
<br>
Members of the army went to Ezra Meeker and other leading Puyallup citizens and demanded money, but these gentlemen and the Northern Pacific Railroad refused their demands.  More dire threats were made, leaving the outnumbered citizens facing further terror.<br>
Townsfolk appealed to the governor for help, and he came in person.  When he arrived he was told by Jumbo Cantell that he had better force the Northem Pacific to give the army a train, "or he wouldn't be governor very long."<br>
<br>
But Governor McGraw was not easily frightened.  He said he would face the army in the local theatre, and he wanted only one man to accompnay him.  On arrival there he found the place packed and in an angry mood.  Commander Jumbo Cantwell was on the platform, ac-
compained by his wife adomed in diamonds and with a sealskin coat.  Everyone was vociferous in demanding the train and making threats.<br>
After a number had their say, the governor walked unannounced to the
<br>
platform and stood facing the crowd.  Looking them over he rec-
ognized a number of personal friends who had forsaked their jobs in barber shops and logging camps to join the mob.<br>
<br>
After a long, silent, survey, the governor started his speech by singling out the men he knew by name.  Then he told them that he realized they had left good jobs under threats and he advised them to go home.  He told the group they all were guilty of criminal acts, and he said that if they did not break up and leave Puyallup the next day he would call out the state militia and have federal troops,brought from Ft.  Vancouver.  He called the bunch a "mob led by a man who is not worthy."<br>
<br>
Gradually, before the governor was through speaking, the crowd began to leave the hall.  By the time he was finished over half had gone.  There was no more noise or demonstrations.  A few men beat their way east on trains, but most returned home.  In 3 days, Puyallup was<br>
back to normal.<br>
<br>
A Washington Historical Society account of the affair says.  "Nothing ever occured in the Washington State that engendered more to the future good and safety of all." When the news of the governor's action was telegraphed over the rest of the country, similar gatherings melted.  Finally, "General Coxey's Army" did ride up to the White House door with him in the lead on his oneton Percheron stallion, but he led fewer than 1,000 followers not the 10,000 he had promised.<br>
<br>
"The whole Coxey affair ended as a dismal failure, both locally and nationally, and this was probably due in large to the prompt and vigorous action taken by the governor at Puyallup."<br>

COXEY'S ARMY.<br>
<br>
Herbert Hunt, "Tacoma and Coxey's Army," <B>Tacoma, its history and its builders, a half century of activity.</B> Chicago: S. J. Clark Publishing Company, 1916, volume II, p. 154-159.<br>
<br>
Conditions steadily had grown worse.  Day by day the groups of idle men increased, and as they discussed the conditions and the causes which they thought had led up to them they became so inflamed that property interests felt alarm.  From the East came news of a great army which Coxey, of Massillon, O., proposed to march to the City of
Washington and there demand of Congress and President Cleveland that they adopt legislation such as Coxey and his followers believed would cure the national ills.  Coxey's appeals caused movements of some kind in almost every city in the Union.  In Tacoma the response was quick.<br>
<br>
With the battle cry of "On to Washington!" the "industrial army," with Frank, known as "General Jumbo," Cantwell, at its head, marched out of Tacoma on the afternoon of April 29, 1894, bound for Puyallup, where it went into camp in a vacant building.  For weeks the army had been organizing.  Meetings were beld in the old National Theater built by Pincus several years before on A Street.  The departure was a source of great relief to Chief of Police D. 0. Smith.<br>
<br>
"Jumbo" had early developed into the leader of the Tacoma contingent.  By his side at the head of the column marched two lieutenants. and his big St. Bernard dog.  Next in line came the bearers of a great, handsome flag which the Grand Army of the Republic had presented to the army.<br>
<br>
Some 600 persons were in the marching column, 300 of whom were soldiers pledged to go to Washington, while the remainder were those who sympathized with the movement and had agreed to remain and assist in caring for the wives and children left in Tacoma.<br>
<br>
"Jumbo," wearing a bright new uniform, doffed his widebrimmed hat, and, with an engaging smile, took up a collection from the spectators who had gathered to witness the departure.  Several wagons loaded with commissary stores preceded the army to Puyallup and it was said some $2,000 in cash was in the treasury of the organization.<br>
<br>
At Puyallup the Tacoma brigade was joined by that from Seattle, consisting of almost seven hundred soldiers, with General Shepard in command.  Here the Federal Government became interested in the army, which it was thought would make an attempt to seize the Northern Pacific Railway.  Deputies under direction of United States Marsbal James C. Drake went into camp as guards of railroad property.<br>
<br>
General "Jumbo" offered G. W. Dickinson, of the Northern Pacific Company $1,000 for a train of twenty cars to St. Paul, members of the army to man it without cost.  The offer was declined.<br>
<br>
Camping at Puyallup and doing nothing soon began to tell on the soldiers and "Jumbo" and other speakers found their hands full in trying to keep them in line.  None of the men was armed and their orders were not to drink nor steal.  But the presence of so many idle men became irritating to the people of the valley and they petitioned Governor McGraw to come and try to work out a solution.<br>

McGraw went to Puyallup May 2d and a meeting was held. 3,000 attending.  It was a wild meeting, almost without semblance of order, each speaker talking in a go-as-you-please manner, with frequent interruptions.  The governor told the men he could not force the railroad to carry them, that conditions East were as bad as they were in the West and that they, the soldiers, were not wanted back there.<br>
<br>
"Jumbo" then took the floor, declared that his men had been induced by the railroad to come West, they had paid their money to the railroad for transportation and now they proposed to make<br>
that "foreign-owned corporation" carry them back.  The net result was the appointment of J. G. Davis, A. E. Bennett and H.  B. LeFevree to confer with the Great Northern Railroad officials.<br>
<br>
The men on the Great Northern had struck and that road was in bad condition, its tracks obstructed with rocks and dirt slides and train service demoralized.  The army heard that Hill had offered to furnish a train for its use provided it would operate the same to St. Paul, clearing the track as it went.  The strikers told the army leaders that they would only be assisting the road to break the strike, and the plan was given up.<br>
<br>
The Northern Pacific was in the hands of receivers appointed by and responsible to, the federal courts.  Deputy marshals guarded every train.  Freight trains moved out of Puyallup only in daylight.<br>
<br>
Then the army heard that the railroad company bad mined the bank of a cut near Buckley and intended to fire the mine and block the track should the army capture and attempt to operate a train.  A carload of the Coxeyites were billed out of Puyallup as hay and the railroad hauled the car many miles before its true contents became known.<br>
<br>
About 7 P. M., May 3d, 150 members of the army flagged a train between Alderton and Orting, climbed aboard and told the crew to go ahead.  At Palmer Junction the train was sidetracked and the brigade was left to care for itself.<br>
<br>
Realizing the impossibility of moving the army as a unit, the leaders decided that in order to reach Spokane the soldiers must travel as they could, and small bands appeared all along the line.  Deputy marshals moved up the line with the bands, both sides soon being scattered all the way from Puyallup to Pasco.  "Jumbo," dodg-
ing back and forth along the line, but always riding as a first-class passenger, assisted the men to climb aboard trains or to get over, the road in other ways.<br>
<br>
The Roslyn coal miners had struck and sixty strikers went to Cle Elum May 9, captured a coal car and started down grade to Ellensburg.  Gravity was the motive power used in this twenty-eight mile trip, the journey being made in two hours, twenty-two minutes.  All trains were side-tracked upon orders from Tacoma.<br>
<br>
At Ellensburg the coal car was abandoned.  A larger crowd went to
the stock yards, captured two cattle cars and started for North Yakima.  Deputies sent west from Yakima to intercept the cattle cars built an obstruction on the track, and forced the army to bring its down-hill train to a stop.  A large number of the riders were arrested.<br>
<br>
The army now decided to sail down the Yakima River.  A large scow was loaded with soldiers and set adrift.  About four miles down stream a whirlpool upset the scow, drowning four men and leaving the remaining fourteen clinging to a log.  One man swam ashore and brought assistance to his stranded comrades.<br>
<br>
At all points the army found sympathizers who were ready to assist it.  Several Yakima citizens were too sympathetic in speech and deputies arrested them for inciting a riot.  The constant friction between deputies and soldiers began to tell on nerves.<br>
<br>
When the movement began there had been a half-way friendliness between the guards and the guarded, but this disappeared as the tension grew, and May 9 the first serious clash occurred.<br>
<br>
A fight started in Yakima and Marshal Chidester, in drawing his revolver, shot himself through the leg.  Deputy Jolly also was wounded, some said by a shot from Chidester's revolver while others maintained that the shooting was done by "the Big Swede" of the army.  Guns were forbidden the soldiers, but most of them carried heavy clubs.<br>
<br>
Cantwell finally reached Chicago in comparative luxury on the collections of a vaudeville and glee club composed of his soldiers, who performed in various towns for the benefit of the "general." But his 300 soldiers had dwindled by desertion or arrest to 100 by the time they reached Spokane.  May 12,  soldiers and sympathizers were brought back to Seattle, jailed and tried before Judge Hanford.<br>
<br>
Their arrival in Seattle caused a riot and resulted in calling out the federal troops.  Cantwell and "San Jose Bill" had been "bouncers" in the notorious Morgan resort. He had had fights with policemen time and again, and he was regarded as a dangerous man in a fight by almost everybody in town except "Eagle Eye" Flannigan, a city detective', who later became known as Ed Flannigan, Northwestern champion weight thrower.<br>
<br>
Flannigan found his superbest pleasure in arresting "Jumbo" on every possible excuse, and if it meant a rough and tumble fight the greater his joy.  Cantwell in after years became a member of the city council of Chicago.  He died a few months ago.<br>
<br>
He was once arrested and charged with having picked the pockets of a small man.  "Jumbo" went into court, held up his hand and asked if it was possible for such a fist to enter a pocket so small.  The case was dismissed.  His hands were enormous.<br>

A strike that threatened calamity to the United States began in June, 1894.  Northern Pacific trainmen quit work on the 29th.<br>
<br>
The railroad was in the hands of a receiver appointed by the federal court, and as soon as the strike began United States Judge Hanford placed it practically in Government bands.  For three weeks the train service was utterly demoralized.  Only a handful of engineers and firemen could be employed.  Every man who took employment risked his life.<br>
<br>
Engineer Marsh, a half-breed Cherokee Indian, is said to have gone to his engine with four enormous revolvers in plain view.  Engineer A. B. Todd was attacked by strikers at Thirteenth and Pacific Avenue and terribly beaten, but be escaped into the California Building, where "Jimmy" Jones, the elevator man, probably saved his life.<br>
<br>
Todd entered the elevator and Jones kept the car running, or standing, between floors.  The mob hissed and hooted and stoned the United States deputy marshals.  The Edison car shops were closed.  For five days no transcontinental train left Tacoma.<br>
<br>
The first one to get through was "Dickinson's Special," the engine of which was run by George W. Dickinson, the general manager of the railroad, who in his earlier years had been an engineer.  He ran this train almost all the way to St. Paul.<br>
<br>
The state populist convention was in session in North Yakinia when the strike began.  The delegates had no way of reaching home except by walking.  A few miles out of Yakima a group of them found a railroad bridge burning.  It had been fired by strikers.  The populists determined to let it burn, though they reported that they could have quenched the blaze with ease.<br>
<br>
All of the employes of the railroad were required to take the same oath as the federal officers.  Many of them displayed the greatest bravery in their attempts to run trains.  But the situation got entirely beyond them and the sixty deputy marshals.<br>
<br>
About eight hundred United States troops were brought from Vancouver barracks and they encamped in the enclosure about the Northern Pacific station.  W. C. Albee, now superintendent, then was chief train dispatcher and the troops were assigned to the trains by him.<br>
<br>
This made the situation much easier.  But there was continual trouble from soap and bran in the water used by the engines, and in obstructions placed on the tracks, sand in boxings and many other difficulties.<br>
<br>
The National Guard had been encamped at Woodland.  Company G refused to ride on a train manned by a nonunion crew and denounced Engineer <B>J. </B>J. Cameron and "Peg-leg" Alward as scabs.  The railroad then
refused to haul the soldiers at all unless they apologized to the engineer and conductor.<br>
<br>
There was a great demur, but Brigadier-General Curry lined the men up and, after giving them a severe lecture on their mutinous con-
duct, exacted a promise that they would obey orders and shoot to kill, if necessary.  The men were required to apologize to the trainmen.  Failure to inflict more drastic punishment upon them was sharply resented by Colonel McCarty, wbo insisted that the soldiers should be tried for mutiny.<br>
<br>
The strike continued for about three weeks.  Gradually the men fell away, and the railroad forces increased until trains could be handled with some regularity.  It was, however, nearly a year before normal service was restored.  A great amount of vandalism was committed, and the operation of trains was hazardous in the extreme.<br>

COXEY'S NAVY<br>
<br>
Carlos A. Schwantes, "Coxey's Montana Navy: a protest against unemployment on the Wageworkers' frontier," <B>The Pacific Northwest Quarterly.</B> LXXIII (July, 1982) p. 98-107.<br>
<br>
From the moment the flotilla left the Fort Benton waterfront it was in trouble.  An inexperienced crew of 340 sailors, mostly metal miners, challenged the Missouri in 10 homemade pine scows, and the river, swollen by the waters of an unusually heavy spring runoff, determined to drown them all.  Apprehensive spectators watched as the Big Muddy spun the craft around crazily, and oarsmen struggled to regain control as they swept beyond view.<br>
<br>
So began, on June 5, 1894, an expedition designed to carry a personal protest from the unemployed of Montana to lawmakers in Washington, D.C. Though the voyagers never reached the Capitol, their 2-month, 2,000-mile trip downriver became one of America's great, if unsung, adventures, an adventure that recalled the nation's frontier past no less than it raised unsettling questions about its industrial future.<br>
<br>
Indeed, the Coxey's Army movement, of which this protest was a part, confirmed the worst fears of those who believed that postfrontier America lacked enough free land to diminish working-class discontent.'<br>
<br>
The trip downriver was a vignette harking back to an earlier era.  For the better part of a century, frontier explorers and exploiters had traveled the Missouri River highway.  Fort Benton, head of steamer navigation on the waterway, was from the 1860s through the 1880s the supply and transportation center for the northern plains and Rockies, and its waterfront a hub of activity.<br>
<br>
But the coming of the railroad drained the upper river of traffic, and in 1891 the last steamboat called at Fort Benton.  For a fleeting moment the building and launching of the Coxey flotilla reanimated the silent waterfront and rekindled memories of the river's former importance.<br>
<br>
Despite its familiar appearance, however, the drama that began in June 1894 was essentially a parody of long-standing popular percep-
tions of western opportunity: rather than searching the West for relief from hard times, members of Coxey's Montana navy preferred to look eastward, to the legislative halls of Congress.<br>
<br>
Protestors planned to float, row, and sail downstream until they reached the mouth of the Ohio, hire a steamer for Pittsburgh, and there beg or steal a train ride to Washington.  If necessary they might even steal an entire train.  They had already proved they could.  
The main reason the Coxeyites were traveling down the Missouri instead of by rail was that they had earlier stolen a train in Butte to hasten their journey east, been overtaken by the United States Armv, and forbidden by a federal court to again appropriate the property of the Northern Pacific Railroad.  The train stealers believed that suffering for weeks and months without work justified their bold and desperate actions.<br>
<br>
Their torment began with the panic of 1893.  The economic depression that followed was the worst the nation had yet experienced, and when spring 1894 promised little or no relief from the hardships of the previous winter, America's jobless arose en masse.  Almost spontaneously, they formed 20 or more "industrial armies" representing every region of the nation except the South.<br>
<br>
The protesters who proposed to travel down the Missouri were in many ways typical of other western contingents that formed in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Spokane, Salt Lake City, and Denver.  Groups from smaller communities like Walla Walla, Pocatello, and Reno joined the metropolitan armies marching east.<br>
<br>
The sheer novelty of the overland trek by thousands of men and an occasional woman attracted extensive newspaper coverage that fostered further growth of the movement.  No American spectacle since the Civil War had been the subject of so much press comment.<br>
<br>
Especially was that true in parts of the West that could be described as the wageworkers' frontier, places where the intersection between a frontier heritage and the new industrial order was especially abrupt, both chronologically and geographically.  There the armies enjoyed far greater support than elsewhere .<br>
<br>
Westerners enlisted under the banner of Jacob S. Coxey, the Ohioan who gave his name to the industrial army movement by leading the first and most publicized march in the East, but they paid him only nominal allegiance.  Coxey planned to present Congress "a petition with boots on." He expected that a living petition, too unwieldy to table and too large to ignore, would force lawmakers to put the unemployed to work building roads.<br>
<br>
Westerners, however, were less interested in road building than in voicing regional demands for immigration restrictions on Chinese, federally funded irrigation  projects,  and   free   and   unlimited coinage of silver.<br>
<br>
Every western army promoted free silver, but none more vigorously than Montana's.  Silver was the paramount issue in the state, where
unhappy citizens from all walks of life singled out congressional repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in late 1893 as contributing most directly to their economic distress.  Federal purchases of the metal had long subsidized the western silver industry, and repeal caused the already low price of the mineral to tumble.<br>
<br>
Silver production became uneconomical.  Mines closed, idling thousands and shaking the foundation of Montana's prosperity.  Many believed that eastern financial interests encouraged Congress to act as it had and that Montanans must now persuade Uncle Sam to resume large-scale buying and minting of silver not only to return life to the silent mines but also to halt the deflationary pressures that squeezed the state's business and agricultural interests.  The silver issue thus cut across class lines and explains why Montana's Coxey crusade had so many sympathizers.  All who believed that the East considered the West an economic colony wished the marchers well.<br>
<br>
In mid-April 1894, William Hogan organized Montana's first Coxey contingent among the unemployed of Butte.  Soon the army attracted recruits from all over the state.  Hogan's 500 followers expected that the Northern Pacific would provide them cheap rates east, but when it refused, they grew angry and stole a locomotive and 10 boxcars.<br>
<br>
Oblivious to danger and defiant of a federal injunction that had warned them away from the trains, Hogan's men headed east at high speed.  Wherever they stopped, local sympathizers contributed liberally to their commissary.  Federal troops intercepted the train thieves near Miles City and returned them to Helena for trial.  In late May, judge Hiram Knowles sentenced Hogan and several army leaders to prison for contempt of court and, upon extracting a promise to steal no more trains, freed everyone else.<br>
<br>
The city of Helena now took upon itself primary responsibility for Montana's unemployed army, which was still determined to go east.<br>
<br>
After examining several alternatives, including an overland walk to Washington, Helena decided to launch Hogan's men on a mission down the Missouri.  The city purchased wood for building scows, hired a master boatwright to oversee construction, and restocked the army's commissary.  It also paid the men's rail fare to Fort Benton.<br>
<br>
For almost a week several hundred would-be sailors hammered together 10 sturdy flatboats under the expert direction of William Sprague, a man wise in the often brutal ways of the Missouri, who insisted that each vessel be constructed of a double thickness of pine planking.  As a Fort Benton resident from 1864 to 1868, Sprague had constructed and sold many similar craft to frontier
adventurers.<br>
<br>
Nine of his scows for Hogan's men measured approximately 10 feet wide and 40 feet long.  He extended the flagship Montana to 60 feet because it carried a brick oven and a carload of provisions.  Builders affixed to each vessel a rudder, four oars (six for the flagship), and a name.  Besides the Montana, the Hogan, and the Free Silver, there were vessels christened after each of the seven cities (Billings, Bozeman, Butte, Fort Benton, Great Falls, Helena, and Livingston) that had befriended the men.<br>
<br>
On the sides of one boat, they painted gigantic silver dollars, and on the oars the cryptic inscription "16 to l." Overhead floated banners bearing the legends "In Congress We Trusted," "We Come in Peace," and "Going to Meet Grover." To give the flotilla a colorful finishing touch, Fort Benton residents donated American flags and red, white, and blue bunting.<br>
<br>
As the hand-crafted navy took shape, Hogan's men eagerly anticipated the start of their great adventure.  Following a fare-
well parade through Fort Benton, which netted them 120 pounds of tobacco to add to the supplies furnished by Helena, they returned to their waterfront quarters for one last restless night.  Launch day, June 5, brought unexpected complications.  Gale-force winds whipped the Missouri's already high water into whitecaps and sent them crashing against the north bank.<br>
<br>
Only fools dared to venture forth.  When the winds finally dimin-
ished around 4:00 that afternoon, Hogan's navy hurriedly shoved off.  Even without the high winds, the swift-running river was still dangerous.  Powerful currents frequently spun the boats com-
pletely around and but for the strength of their construction would have smashed them.<br>
<br>
As Fort Benton receded from view, the navy's contact with the outside world ceased.  Until they reached Williston, several days distant, the sailors passed through some of the loneliest, most isolated parts of the American West, a land of big sky and fantastic rock formations that appeared virtually unchanged since Lewis and Clark passed that way 90 years before.<br>
<br>
The romance of the voyage caused Fort Benton's River Press to comment, , 'Just think of it.  Boats and grub furnished, and free water passage for over 2,500 miles, with nothing to do but float, eat, sleep, admire the scenery, and discuss the Wilson bill.  Who wouldn't be a Coxeyite?"<br>
<br>
But after several days passed without word of the sailors' fate, the River Press predicted that "there is little probability that 340 men, so inexperienced as they are, will make the long journey to Bismarck without accident or fatality." The equally pessimistic Butte Miner commented, "If the Coxey navy makes its trip on the treacherous Missouri without drowning half its men, it will be in
luck.  Navigation on the wicked old stream is none-too-safe even with the best of craft, but to attempt the journey in weak and e hurriedly constructed boats is to invite disaster."<br>
<br>
The papers' premonitions of disaster probably were fostered by news of a terrible accident in Denver two days after Montana's navy departed Fort Benton: several hundred Colorado Coxeyites set sail on the South Platte but reportldly lost 15 men to the swirling waters when some of the vessels flipped over.  The tragedy caused most of the novice sailors to abandon the South Platte for the more familiar course of the Union Pacific right-of-way."<br>
<br>
Its first full day on the river, Hogan's navy navigated 30 miles in four hoursnot a particularly rapid rate, but the men needed to adjust to the routine of life,on the Missouri.  Far from being the leisurely excursion the River Press imagined, the voyage demanded discipline, cooperation, and hard work.<br>
<br>
They typically spent 16 hours on the river, from 4 a.m. until 8 p.m., and for many the workday lasted even longer.  Every man per-
formed a variety of tasks.  Sailors manned the oars in four shifts, alternating between half an hour of rowing and half an hour of doing something else.  The third day out they rigged each scow with a square topsail to increase their speed, but the wind seldom cooperated.<br>
<br>
After tying up for the night, men ate supper before bedding down on a riverbank to contemplate the stars and moon in a clear Montana sky.  Then, said one, "We dream of free silver and the good times coming that must surely arise after we have performed our mission.  "<br>
<br>
Anight watchman on each scow made sure it did not slip from its moorings.  At 2 a.m. he awakened the cook.  Each boat had its own cook, who along with his helpers prepared meals from foodstuffs provided by the commissary.  They served breakfast at 3 a.m., after having spent the previous evening preparing a noon meal, which crewmen ate on the run to avoid delay.<br>
<br>
The commissary also provided each boat with fresh bread.  Four bakers working in two shifts turned out 300-600 loaves a day.  Doubtless, few crew members worked harder than cooks and bakers.<br>
<br>
On the morning of the second day of the voyage, Hogan's navy made an unusual stop.  In the best tradition of the frontier West, the men reenacted a ritual of popular democracy: they elected an interim leader to serve until the imprisoned Hogan could rejoin them.  Their unanimous choice for "Hogan," as they jokingly en-
titled their new leader, was John Edwards, an unemployed metal miner who joined the crusade in Butte.  Edwards, a 36-year-old native of Newark, New jersey, the son of Irish immigrants, had 20 years earlier come west in search of gold and silver.<br>
<br>
A man of medium height and dark complexion, he had a refreshingly
straightforward manner that earned him the respect of his fellow voyagers.  They obeyed his orders to the letter.  The only<br>
punishment for insubordination was expulsion.  In the forbidding country of eastern Montana and North Dakota, where men believed their chances for survival apart from the navy were the same as in the Sahara wastelands, none dared disobey or desert.<br>
<br>
Almost a week out of Fort Benton, after bucking nearly constant headwinds and running rapids that made "some of the able 'seamen' think of home and mother," the flotilla rowed into Williston, the first stop in North Dakota.  Their arrival was no surprise to townspeople.  Rumors that they intended to quit the river at that point and capture a Great Northern train on the main line that par-
alleled the north bank had panicked railway officials, who hired Indian scouts to go upriver to warn them of the navy's approach.<br>
<br>
They implored the commander of nearby Fort Buford to send three companies of troops to guard railway property.  Failing that, they persuaded local officials to deputize 50 citizens.  Along the north bank, armed deputies built bonfires and waited nervously all night for the presumed band of pirates.'<br>
<br>
Hogan's men, who had earlier been warned by judge Knowles that they would find few sympathizers outside Montana, calmly halted on the south side of the river.  From there three emissaries crossed in a lighter to obtain medicine for the sick.  On the opposite shore they found deputies armed with Winchesters and women begging them not to shoot the visitors unless it was necessary.<br>
<br>
Once the three got past that distraction, however, they found the townspeople, especially the women, surprisingly sympathetic.  An elderly black woman exclaimed that she had not danced for 12 years but now she felt like "footing a jig for Coxey's men." To the navy, Williston contributed tobacco, pipes, and several recruits.  Such signs of popular support were invariably the best medicine to revive the spirits of the protest navy.<br>
<br>
From Williston to Bismarck, the men again traveled through a great and lonely land.  Their main concern was to reach the North Dakota capital before their dwindling food supply ran out.  And even if they reached Bismarck ahead of starvation, they were afraid to travel on unless sympathizers restocked their commissary.<br>
<br>
They knew that to the south remained several hundred miles of sparsely settled country and that the ever cantankerous Missouri would lose much of its water as the summer progressed, exposing the sandbars and snags that complicated and slowed navigation.  Events in Bismarck would thus determine the mission's future course.<br>
<br>
When Hogan's navy reached the North Dakota capital on June 14, a
tumultuous welcome initially lifted the sailors' spirits.  Crowds from Bismarck and Mandan, across the river, lined both banks, wav-
ing, clapping, and yelling themselves hoarse.  Adding to the noisy salute were the whistle blasts of powerhouses and railway locomotives.<br>
<br>
The Bismarck City Council struck a sour note, however, when it refused to reprovision the navy, saying that it had enough trouble supporting the local poor.  Sympathizers donated an impressive array of foodstuffs, but not nearly enough to see protesters through to the next significant population center, Pierre, a town of 3,500 people.<br>
<br>
At this bleak juncture, when for the first time the sailors realized they might fail, supporters in Butte sent a check for $100, enough money for food to reach the South Dakota capital.  After three days in Bismarck, the navy-diminished to 247 men-raised its gangplanks and with flags, banners, and sails snapping in a stiff breeze proceeded single file down the Missouri.<br>
<br>
The supply problems that bedeviled Hogan's navy-and at times all other western contingents-revealed  clearly the workings of the protest movement's institutional underpinning.  Contrary to -<br>
popular belief, Coxeyites never lived the haphazard life of hoboes and tramps.  Only rarely did they rely solely on doorto-door solicitation and streetcorner panhandling for their next meal.<br>
<br>
The Coxey movement instead adopted a military style of organization that systematized procurement and distribution of food.  Some contingents might even in an emergency turn to their home guards, as Hogan's men in Bismarck had appealed to Butte for aid.  Because two-thirds of the men in the Montana navy were married and many had children, they could not have joined the trek to Washington had not local supporters in Butte provided for their families during their extended absence.<br>
<br>
Home guards not only sustained wives and children but also gave men on the road legal help, psychological support, and, in times of desperation, hard cash.<br>
<br>
In addition, Coxeyites in the West benefited from the special relief work often conducted on their behalf by the Populist party and organized labor.  In the North Dakota capital, these two institutions were weak or ineffective, but in Omaha, on the other hand, a strong labor movement helped reprovision Charles T. Kelly's California army and several additional contingents that followed.<br>
<br>
Members of Hogan's navy, almost all union men, anticipated this support as they made their way south from Bismarck.  In rural Iowa, Populists were the main sustainers of Coxey contingents that crossed that state.  Where the Populist party and organized labor
were both strong, as in parts of Montana, Idaho, and Colorado, Coxeyites fared best of all.<br>
<br>
In a less tangible way, the Coxey movement also benefited from extensive newspaper coverage.  Sympathetic editors were common in the area from the Missouri Valley west, but even negative press was sometimes better than none at all.  For example, several South Dako a river towns that feared the worst contributed most liberally to Hogan's men in hopes that they would quickly pass on.<br>
<br>
The press was well aware of its role in sustaining the crusade.  In mid-April the Kansas City Star editorialized that whatever Coxey and Kelly and their so-called armies of Industrialists may become or do, they must give credit to the newspapers.  If it were not for the press, which has exploited their mad performances, they would neve, have been heard of, and when the press tires of them they will sink back to the obscurity to which they belong.<br>
<br>
The Chicago Tribune published a cartoon depicting Coxey and Kelly as hot air balloons kept aloft by a constant stream of "newspaper notoriety." In late June and early July, though, the men of Hogan's navy worried little about the sustaining stream of publicity failing, for in the valley of the Missouri above Omaha they still caused quite a stir.  Depending on the local paper, they appeared either as reform-minded Huckleberry Finns or as depraved, work-avoiding thieves.<br>
<br>
The men admitted that they had butchered a stray cow or two, and as they adjusted to shipboard routine, they increasingly adopted the carefree life of Huckleberry Finn.  They took time to swim, fish, play cards, smoke, boat race, and admire the wild flowers and birds.  For countless hours they sang free-silver songs, recited poetry, or polished their oratory in preparation for the big day in Washington.<br>
<br>
Each boat contained a great deal of well-thumbed reading material, the favorite item being a Forum article entitled "What Can We Do for the Poor?"<br>
<br>
On the unpleasant side were chigger bites and sunburn.  Daily exposure to sun, wind, and rain prompted them to rig canopies from strips of tenting, blankets, and old clothes.  Occasionally they festooned these shelters with wild roses and green boughs plucked from the riverside.  Try as they might, though, they could never take their minds off their biggest problem: food.<br>
<br>
Quartermaster General Dick Berthold needed every bit of the experience he had gained during his 25 years as steamboat captain to run an efficient commissary.  The men had plenty of utensils-
fashioned mostly from tomato and sardine cans-and an occasional
powder can, which they used as a boiling kettle.  They made the yellow water of the Big Muddy drinkable by cracking an egg into a barrel of it.  But seldom did they have a reassuring supply of food.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, several towns lined the river in South Dakota, and the people there were exceptionally generous.  Pierre officials not only contributed beef, bacon, flour, coffee, rice, and salt but also allowed Hogan's men to solicit individual citizens.  The village of Chamberlain was equally generous, donating a two-day supply of food consisting of 500 pounds of flour, 200 pounds of bacon, 200 pounds of beef, 100 pounds of beans, 50 pounds of coffee, 40 pounds of rice, and 2 pounds of hops.<br>
<br>
The hops were used in baking not brewing.  To almost identical donations Yankton added a bottle of liniment and 100 bricks, a stovepipe, and a barrel of mortar for repairing the oven, which had been badly damaged in a storm.<br>
<br>
Though citizens may have sometimes given out of fear, Hogan's men never threatened if they were not fed.  "Admiral" Edwards told Pierre citizens that " while his men wanted provisions they were not to be understood as making a demand for them, only a request, and if they were not supplied they would have to go without." Upon leaving the South Dakota capital, Edwards stood on the bow of his flagship, and as the fleet passed slowly before a crowd of specta-
tors, his men gave cheer after cheer for Pierre's generosity.<br>
<br>
In Chamberlain, too, polite crewmen seem to have won the grudging respect of townspeople.  A U.S. marshal who went there to appraise Hogan s men reported to Yankton citizens downriver that "I saw everybody in the army and they are average laboring men and not tramps.  They desire no trouble and only ask for food.  "<br>
<br>
People who imagined the worst about the sailors before they arrived were surprised to find that they used no loud or profane language, carried more Bibles than weapons, and took pride in their respect for law and good order.  They regularly washed themselves and their clothes and visited the fleet's makeshift barbershop.<br>
<br>
Hogan's voyagers were especially fortunate that a series of favorable reports preceded them to Yankton, for the high winds and waters that pummeled their craft and damaged the vital Dutch oven forced them to remain there several days longer than expected.  Although the state's worried governor ordered militiamen to stand by in case Hogan's navy became unruly, townspeople responded positively, as if the visitors were entertainers in a Wild West show.<br>
<br>
Crew members seldom appeared on Yankton streets without a friendly crowd gathering around to hear details of their adventure.  In the
process, residents also learned about hard times in Montana and how well posted the unemployed were on political and economic issues.  Hogan's men left Yankton with fond memories, a commissary rebuilt and restocked, and a wagonload of clothes and old shoes.<br>
<br>
Except for the damaging storm near Yankton, the trip from Bismarck to Omaha was uneventful.  On the last day of June, Hogan's navy made a brief overnight stop in Sioux City, where police brought them two carloads of food and an ultimatum to move on.  They needed little urging, for they were now so eager to reach Omaha that they started rowing double time, motivated, in part, by thoughts of apple pie and other treats that the city had earlier lavished on Kelly's Californians.<br>
<br>
Omaha surveyed the Missouri Valley from a plateau 80 feet above the west bank.  Its population of 140,000 was the largest of any city on the river, larger by 10,000 than Kansas City's, larger even than that of the entire state of Montana.  For Hogan's men, it was the biggest city they had seen since moving to the far Northwest.  With hard rowing the sailors arrived hours earlier than expected, just at dusk, when from the river the lightbejeweled metropolis appeared most enchanting.  What they could not know as they moved in awe toward the great city on a hill was that in a few moments a serious accident would spoil their reverie and portend troubles to come.<br>
<br>
Hogan's men threaded their way down the unfamiliar stretch of water when suddenly, dead ahead and barely visible in the darkness, loomed the East Omaha bridge.  From above someone shouted, "Turn to the right, or you'll upset." The sailors, though exhausted by an unusually long and arduous day, reacted quickly, perhaps too quickly, for the current caught the Livingston broadside, threw it against a bridge pier, and rolled it over.  Into the river pitched 17 men and their belongings; six found handholds on the pier and scrambled up to safety, but the rest fought for life in the inky water.<br>
<br>
Fellow crewmen and policemen finally rescued all but one sailor, who floated away in the darkness.  The missing man later turned up unhurt, but the accident spread gloom among Hogan's men, gloom that was made worse by a most disappointing welcome to Omaha.  Actualiv it was hardly a welcome at all: on the shore a dozen policemen and six or seven sympathizers waved lanterns to guide them to a dubious camping spot circumscribed by a railroad bridge, a garbage dump, and a large sewer.<br>
<br>
Life looked a little rosier the next day.  Omaha's Central Labor Council, which explained that it had not greeted the vovagers at the waterfront because it expected them the next morning, arranged a public rally to demonstrate the city's support.  The Omaha World-Herald also prodded citizens to help Hogan's men, commenting that they are "very much in need of help, and if some of the
enthusiasm displayed during Keltv's stay is revived, the army will fare very well."<br>
<br>
The Central Labor Council collected from businessmen gifts of potatoes, crackers, onions, eggs, sugar, coffee, and flour.  County commissioners contributed $225 worth of supplies, including 100 bars of soap, and individual members of the city council gave $53 in cash.  Local merchants provided fresh bunting to spruce up the navy for the Fourth of July.  Each man also got a shiny new badge.  It was the last big handout the protest navy received.<br>
<br>
Their Omaha stay taught Hogan's men an important lesson in human psychology.  As a rule, the first army to visit a community got the apple pie; all others got leftovers-or nothing at all.  Little of the movement's novelty value remained after an initial visit.  Thus it must have sobered Hogan's men to know that they would be the second, third, or, in some cases, fourth Coxey contingent to visit the remaining big cities on their itinerary.<br>
<br>
In fact, because Kelly's men had already traveled the water route from Saint Louis most of the way to Pittsburgh, Hogan's flotilla would likely attract little press coverage in the Ohio Valley.  News accounts of their adventure were already becoming scarce when they left Omaha.  The public was by that time far more interested in the gigantic Pullman strike that radiated out from Chicago and caused the greatest railway tie-up westerners had ever experienced.<br>
<br>
Hogan's men sympathized with Pullman strikers, and at every landing they sought latest news of the conflict.  So, too, did most other Americans.  As the strike dragged on, becoming increasingly dis-
ruptive and violent, it crowded news of the Coxey movement from the papers and caused many frightened people to turn against the working class in general.  For Hogan's navy, that meant loss of popular support and lean times that grew progressively leaner as they floated through parts of Missouri where Organized labor-like Yankee soldiers-had never been welcome.<br>
<br>
Unlike people in the Dakotas, Iowa, and Nebraska, many Missourians were most unimpressed by letters of introduction reminding readers that a number of Hogan's men had fought during the Civil War for the North.<br>
<br>
The flotilla reached Leavenworth, Kansas, a town once noted for its Southern sympathies, on July 1 1. The men desperately needed a show of popular support to inject life back into the flagging crusade.  The day before, they had lost a scow, and the clothes and food inside, when it hit a submerged snag and overturned.  It was a loss they could not afford, with more mouths to feed now than at any point since Bismarck.  Their number had increased to 325 men at Plattsmouth, Nebraska, where Hogan's men were joined by four skiffs of Coxeyites, the remnant of the ill-fated Colorado contingent,
which itself included eight survivers of an army of 600 that left Portland, Oregon, in late April.<br>
<br>
About the only thing Coxey's navy had in its favor in Leavenworth was a Pop list police force, which allowed the vi si_ tors liberty of the city.  Their show in Leavenworth was a familiar one.  With banners flying and fifes shrieking, thev marched from their boat camp uptown to the courthouse square for some fiery oratory, during which spokesmen explained to townspeople their reform mission.  The fact that only about 75 of the curious turned out nettled Edwards.<br>
<br>
He lost his temper and criticized the community, saying that people were slaves when they took so little interest in the nation's politics.  His assistant, John Byron, likewise complained that Leavenworth's lack of sympathy made it difficult for the reformers to make any impression on Congress.  Edwards then passed the hat , but onlookers gave only 87 cents.  The men returned to the fleet in a downcast mood.<br>
<br>
Claiming that he was physically ill, Edwards withdrew $6 from the treasury and took a train to Kansas City for unspecified treatment, promising to rejoin the men when they passed through a few days later.  Some perhaps wondered whether Edwards would do what other discouraged army leaders had done: get drunk and disappear.<br>
<br>
When the navy got to Kansas City it received the municipal cold shoulder.  Mayor Webster Davis would not permit the men to land within the city limits, and he posted mounted policemen along the waterfront to enforce his edict.  From atop a high bluff along the river, the chief of police anxiously scanned the horizon with an ancient spyglass; his men waited in the sweltering heat, mopping their brows and preparing to repulse the invaders.<br>
<br>
Coxeyites, having been forewarned of possible trouble, kept to the middle of the river as they rounded the bend and rowed by slowly in single file.  All the while they hooted derisively at the mounted escort that followed along the shore.  According to previous arrangements, the commissary boat dropped out of line and drew near to a place where the mayor, a crowd of the curious, and a police guard waited.<br>
<br>
There Hogan's emissaries collected a token gift from the mayor consisting of flour, bread, and coffee-about enough food, observed a sailor ruefully, for one meal.  Complaining that they had re-
ceived no meat, men hungrily eyed a small pig picked up in Nebraska by one boat's crew.<br>
<br>
As Coxeyites debated their meager food supply, police warned again that they would "vag" any crewman found inside the city limits.  In other words, they would arrest men for vagrancy, a charge that likely meant an unpleasant stay in the local workhouse.  Once more Hogan's men suffered the consequences of being latecomers in the
progression of western armies.<br>
<br>
Mayor Davis claimed that he barred Hoganites from the city because he had earlier given a Coxey contingent permission to remain there for three days, but it defiantly remained for three weeks, pillaging residences and raiding saloons.  He feared a repeat from Hogan's outfit.  Hogan's men discounted the mayor's story and in effect thumbed their noses in contempt when they pitched camp on a stretch of riverbank just beyond the Kansas City limits and dared him to evict them.<br>
<br>
They refused to move until they had searched the city's hotels for the missing Edwards, fearing that he might be too ill to summon aid.  Mayor Davis fumed but did not attempt to stop a small search party led by the navy's treasurer, 1. D. Sullivan.  The men were relieved to locate their absent leader in a hospital.  He was well enough to return to the flotilla but relinquished command to a new "Hogan," John Byron.<br>
<br>
As the men continued down the Missouri, they found food increasingly scarce.  Sometimes they had barely enough to get them from one population center to another.  At Jefferson City the mayor and councilmen donated a meager amount of flour, bacon, and bread.<br>
<br>
To this they added 30 pounds of coffee after a Coxeyite cried out, "Mr.  Mayor, we want some coffee worse than anything else, and we would be very thankful if you could let us have a few pounds."<br>
<br>
Hogan's navy finally arrived at Saint Louis during the last week of July, half starved and wholly demoralized.  The reform crusade had become a battle for personal survival.  About the only group to give them any aid was the tiny Socialist Labor party.  Its members held a public rally that netted $11.80, and they collected from businessmen two dozen loaves of bread and a few bundles of clothing.  Though Byron maintained that the men would still reach Washington before the snow flew, most sensed that their once grand crusade was tottering toward collapse.<br>
<br>
Approximately 60 days and 2,670 miles from Fort Benton, life left the movement at Carondelet, on the south side of Saint Louis, but not before the men suffered one last disillusioning blow.  After enduring several frustrating and unproductive days at Carondelet, the men convened a council to debate their fate and therein decided to let the crewmen of each boat decide the future for themselves.<br>
<br>
Five crews elected to proceed down the Mississippi to Cairo or New Orleans and from there travel overland to Washington.  The remainder agreed to sell their boats, divide the proceeds, and separate for individual destinations.  The sailors also decided to divide equally the navy's $435 treasury, most of the money being a
recent gift from a Dubuque philanthropist.<br>
<br>
Sullivan, their treasurer, headed for town to get the necessary cash.  The men trusted Sullivan, who for the past 12 years had been a hod carrier and parttime miner in Butte, but they also sent along John Edwards and Edward H. Hogan (apparently no relation to his more famous namesake).<br>
<br>
The sailors waited for the three to return.  Eventually it became obvious that their erstwhile companions had betrayed and abandoned them.  Penniless and dispirited, Hogan's navy broke up.  Singing a bitter version of a song entitled "He Never Came Back," a few men headed down the Mississippi, others continued east toward Washing-
ton, but most apparently returned to Montana in "side-door Pullmans," better known as boxcars.<br>
<br>
The day after the great betrayal, Saint Louis police arrested Edward Hogan for public drunkenness, and while in jail he confessed to taking  $145 of the navy's money.  Sullivan, he said, had headed for Denver and Edwards to another western city.  Doubtless, if Edwards made it back to Butte he found some angry people awaiting him.<br>
<br>
As for the original Hogan, at about the time of the breakup, judge Knowles released him from prison to take a job.  Now that he had work, quipped Knowles, he hoped Hogan would stay away from railroading, especially the kind that landed him in jail.  Hogan received many congratulations from local supporters, although the man that bore his name halfway across the continent was no more .<br>
<br>
Because few newspapers noted the demise of Montana's protest navy and because any records kept by the men themselves apparently failed to survive, it is impossible to say how participants looked back upon their adventure in reform.  What did they think they had accomplished? Until the final days Hogan's men quite clearly believed they were making history.<br>
<br>
The fleet's journalist, Nolan Davis, intended to immortalize the adventure in a book.  Another voyager, upon showing his membership book to a reporter, remarked, "I would not part with that book for anything, for long in the future it will be'something for my people to be proud of." Many indicated that they endured present hardships because they expected their mission to result in better times.<br>
<br>
Men also believed that their protest would further the economic and political education of people they encountered along the way.  In fact, though, the historical record fails to say how successfully they enlightened people; neither does it indicate whether Hoganites still regarded their membership books with pride after their leaders betrayed them and their movement collapsed.<br>
<br>
Though Hogan's navy, like the Coxey movement as a whole, failed to
secure its reform demands, it nonetheless served an important purpose: it provided a way for one group of unemployed workers to vent their discontent.  It gave men involuntarily idled-men feeling sorry for themselves and growing increasingly bitter as they watched their families suffer privation-a new sense of purpose, a<br>
new feeling of being able to direct their own destiny.<br>
<br>
By channeling their discontent into a novel form of self-help, the reform navy heightened workers' selfworth, Hogan's men stopped short of the Capitol, but perhaps surviving a twomonth raft voyage down the Missouri without the loss of a single life was for many protesters accomplishment enough.<br>

JAKE BIRD'S HEX.<br>
<br>
John Dennis McCallum, "The Jake Bird Hex," <B>Crime Doctor, Dr. Charles p. Larson,</B> Mercer Island: Writing Works, 1976, p. 144-45.<br>
<br>
The Jake Bird hex? Was it a hoax? You figure it out.  Judge Hodge, who'd been in excellent health, died one month after sentencing Jake.  Before January ran itself out, Joe Karpach dropped dead of a heart attack.  Chief Court Clerk Ray Scott was buried in February-also of heart failure.<br>
<br>
Six months afterward Police Lt.  Sherman Lyons, who had obtained Bird's confession, died-again of a coronary.  The next one to go was one of Jake's attorneys, J. W. Selden.  He died on the anniversary of Jake's sentencing.  Assigned to defend Jake against his own wishes, Selden had told the jury during the trial: "My heart does not beat in sympathy for this man, who fixed his Ire as more important than that of others."<br>
<br>
The sixth man to die by Bird's socalled "hex" was Arthur A. Steward.  Arthur had been one of Jake's guards at Walla Walla.<br>
The only two that Jake's hex didn't affect were Pat Steele and Dr. Larson.<br>
<br>
"Jake didn't put his so-called hex on me personally," Dr. Larson remembers.  "The way I found out about it was from Pat Steele.  Pat walked into my lab one day and @d that he and I, among others, were hexed; that Jake had predicted we were going to die within the year.  We both laughed and went out and had a drink on it.  The fact that Pat and I were the only two out of eight who survived is a matter of pure coincidence.  Those six men who did die didn't die of Jake Bird, they died of coronary occlusions."<br>
<br>
In his practice throughout the years, Dr. Larson has helped convict in courts of homicide, he estimates, about 100 men.  A number of these men have threatened to kill him in reprisal.<br>
<br>
It never occurred to him to remember their names or when they would get out, or to take any precautionary measures if he happened to be told when they did get out.  "The desire for revenge is a very immature reaction," he says, "and whereas your average murderer is seldom a very mature, well-rounded character, he is nevertheless subject to the cooling process-the changes that come with the passage of time.<br>
<br>
Come to think of it, that's what our penal system is all about, isn't it-to put people on the shelf until they cool off.?"<br>

Dr. Larson chuckled softly.  "I like the thought, anyway."<br>

JAMES W. SELDEN<br>
<br>
Larry Harper, "Fifth man in Bird's 'Hex' dies, J. W. Selden stricken; won acclaim for solution of famous Connor murder case," <B>Tacoma News Tribune.</B> November 29, 1948.<br>
<br>
James W. Selden, who as Pierce County prosecuting attorney in the early 1920s broken the Connor murder case and more than twenty years later got on another murderer's 'hex' list, died of a heart attack Friday afternoon.<br>
<br>
Selden, 76, was one of the lawyers who defended Jake Bird, itinerant Negro, who was convicted of the slaying of Mrs. Bertha Kludt here last year.<br>
<br>
"All you guys who had anything to do with this case are going to die before I do," Bird predicted after he was condemned to death last November.<br>
<br>
His defense attorney was the fifth. Like all other others he was a victim of a heart attack.<br>
<br>
WORKED ON NEWSPAPER<br>
<br>
Selden was born February  8, 1872, in Blair, Nebraska, where his father published a newspaper. While a lad Selden began to learn all phases of the newspaper business and when his father died, he ran the paper himself.<br>
<br>
A few year later he entered the University of Nebraska where he was graduated in law. After practicing in Omaha for four years he came west, remaining, in Portland a year before coming to Tacoma in 1904.<br>
<br>
Selden became deputy prosecuting attorney under Fred G. Remann, now a superior court judge and continued under William D. Askren. In 1920 Selden was elected prosecutor and served two terms.<br>
<br>
It was during one of his terms that Selden participated in the famous Richard Connor murder case. Mrs. Connor, residing at Fern Hill disappeared and weeks of search revealed no trace of her.<br>

During this search Selden met Ione Holt, a friend of the Conner family. She succeeded in obtaining from Conner the admission that he had thrown his wife's body into a well on the Fort Lewis reservation. Selden recovered the body and Connor, tried in federal court was sent to prison for life.<br>
<br>
MARRIED IONE HOLT<br>
<br>
A short time later Selden, who had been divorced from his first wife, Mary Agnes, two years previously, married Ione Holt. In 1939 she divorced the attorney and six months later Selden and his first wife were remarried. Judge Remann officiated. Their home in recent years has been at 1411 North Cedar Street.<br>
<br>
The friendship between Selden and Judge Remann, began when they were both in the prosecutor's office had continued through the y ears. Selden was one of a quartet that for many years made annual excursions to Judge Remann's summer cam on the Elwhat river. H.A. Doc Sanford, Tacoma auto dealer, and the late Judge E.D.Hodge were the other members of the party, all ardent fishermen.<br>
<br>
Friday noon Judge Remann, Selden and Sanford had lunch together, as they often did the group including also Norman Bradley, John Dimmer, and Art Pease. Selden, they said seemed in good spirits.<br>
<br>
The attorney, who had been in private practice since leaving the prosecutor's department with offices in the Puget Sound Bank building as a member of the Lebanon Lodge NO 104 f the F and A.M. Scottish Rite bodies, Afifi Temple of the Shrine and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.<br>
<br>
Besides his wife, Mary Agnes, Selden is survived by a daughter, Mrs. C.W. Harnack of  Sherman Oaks, California; a sister, Mrs. Minnie Williams of Los Angeles, and two grand children; Ronald and Anthony Harnack of Sherman Oaks.  Services will be announced by Buckley King.<br>
<br>
Selden's death came shortly after 2 o'clock in his office in the Puget Sound Bank building. He was seated at his desk reading Supreme Court Decisions when he gasped suddenly and died.<br>
<br>
With his death, Pierce County officials were asking each other: "Who's next?"<br>
<br>
Bird, the man who pronounced the grim "hex" on all those associated with his trial, is in the Pierce County jail while the State Supreme Court prepares an order for his re-sentence after an unsuccessful appeal.<br>
<br>
When told of his defense lawyers's death, the Negro smiled and said with ghoulish delight: "The Bible says, Rejoice when anyone dies, feel bad when anyone is born."<br>
<br>
Where he found the quotation is not quite certain. The concordance
to St.James version failed to reveal the source.<br>
<br>
Bird,  however, apparently has his own sources. He at least is not without resourcefulness. In the year he has been in jail he has written reams of self defense material with the assistance of a couple of unofficial secretaries, fellow prisoners, and he has surprised many a gullible visitor with his "knowledge" of the law.<br>
<br>
He also surprised the courtroom during his trial with the announcement that during his forty-four years of life in and out of prison, he participated in or knew of the slaying of forty-four persons .<br>
<br>
Bird was convicted here of bludgeoning to death, Mrs. Kludt, 45 year old house wife, with an ax. Mrs. Kludt's 17 year old daughter died in the defense of her mother.<br>

EARTHQUAKE. 1949.<br>
<br>
Harland H. Edwards," Lessons in Structural Safety Learned<br>
From the 1949 Northwest Earthquake," <B>Western Construction.</B> XXVI (February, 1951) p. 70-74.<br>
<br>
On April  13, 1949, the people of western Washington and Oregon were shown that strong earthquakes could occur in their locality.  Property damage as a result of the quake on that date totaled more than $15,000,000 and seven lives were lost.  With the quake classified as VII and VIII on the Modified Mercalli scale, major damage resulted in the low, soft land areas extending from Seattle southward to Longview including the cities of Puyallup, Tacoma, Olympia, Centralia and Chehalis.  Minor losses were suffered by other communities and outlying areas.<br>
<br>
(From an introduction written for Washington Divisiion of Geology and Earth Resources, Information Circular Number 81 published by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources. Olympia: The Department, 1986.).<br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
<br>
About noon , Pacific Standard Time April 13, 1949, radio listeners were startled by excited announcements of a violent earthquake in western Washington and Oregon.  By declarations of disaster which grew in size with each broadcast the impression was given that the cities of the area were a shambles, though it was far from the truth.  However, frantic friends, relatives and others in distant areas who jammed communication lines for days in efforts to reach their loved ones could not know that this Pacific Northwest area was the world's luckiest place that day.<br>
<br>
But the Northwest was favored!<br>
<br>
Outstanding in natural beauty and moderate in weather, favored as a playground of the nation, the Northwest was unquestionably favored at 11:56 a. m. that April 13 by not only the earthquake but also by the fact that many of the schools were closed "on vacation."<br>
<br>
Neither scenic beauty nor natural wealth would have availed anything had the shaking continued a little longer, or had there been the strong aftershocks that have characterized most of the severe earthquakes of recent time.  Thousands of people who were on the streets at lunch time, that most-feared time for the occurrence of an earthquake, could have been buried under tons of parapet walls, ornamentation and broken building fronts.  
Thousands of children could have been filing out of the doors of their schools on their way to lunch or play only to be struck down by a hail of lethal masonry, could have been crushed in their rooms by collapsing buildings, or struck down on their playgrounds by failing walls and chimneys.<br>
<br>
Yes, luck-if you want to call it that was with us that day.  Or could one call it the "handwriting on the wall?"<br>
<br>
In the comparatively small proportion of buildings damaged, shocking conditions of building weakness were disclosed, conditions of inadequacy of design and of almost criminally cheap con-
struction, duplicates of which exist in almost every city and state.<br>
<br>
Exposed to public gaze were the too-often-unrecognized results of penny-wise and pound foolish policies which convicted owner, architect and builder alike of neglecting to consider in their structures the effect on human life of natural seismic forces which long since should have ceased to be "acts of God," which have occurred for ages and which may be expected to occur anywhere from time to time just as are heavy winds and floods.<br>
<br>
An on-the-spot account of damage just before noon on that fateful though fortunate April 13, 1949, I was in a construction shack in Chehalis, Washington, checking over plans for a building being erected.  Suddenly I sensed a vibration and heard a dull rumble that was foreign to the hustling and hammering of the job.  It was more like a heavy truck approaching rapidly over a rough road.<br>
<br>
"Something's not right," I thought, because vibrations of structures usually mean trouble to me.  My work is that of a construction supervisor and structural engineer.  From years of experience in the West I knew that such sounds and movements were not conducive to the health of structures, and particularly the health of the old brick buildings nearby.<br>
<br>
The thought had scarcely flashed through my mind when the old frame shack weaved and shook, creaking in its every joint to the accompaniment of the unearthly rumble and muffled roar of an earthquake.  My curiosity getting the better of my training to "stay put" during an earthquake, I dashed out of the door, saw the poles in the alley weave crazily and the taut wires swing in jerky circles like the jump rope of a pair of kids.<br>
<br>
I heard the rattle and dull roar of the brick walls of the garage across the street failing outward upon the cars parked closely in the lot adjacent.  I saw the cloud of dust arise, then settle
slowly upon the wreckage of cars that a moment before were the pride and joy of many families.  I heard the shouts of excited people, then all was still like the lull after a storm.<br>
<br>
I wondered what was happening to the noonday crowds in Olympia, Tacoma, Puyallup and Seattle whether the quake there had continued long enough to cast down upon them the tons of brick, terra cotta, glass and stone that are loosely attached to the many buildings that line the streets.  Heaven forbid such a disaster!<br>
<br>
Mindful of the destructiveness of the aftershocks, if they came, I dashed to my car parked in front of the job, got it away from the old masonry buildings, grabbed my camera and started taking pictures.  As usual, the ornate City Hall and Library entrances were blocked by fallen masonry.  The structures were racked and broken, From a vantage point a few blocks up the hill I could see that the wood frame residences and similar structures visible from there bad fared well so far.<br>
<br>
Only chimneys were down, but in that respect the damage was almost universal; 1,334 were later counted by the building inspector of that small city.  Down the street the Methodist Church tower had broken, partly falling through the roof into the sanctuary and partly, as usual, over the front entrance stairs.  Luckily, this was not a church day.<br>
<br>
Public buildings  damaged,  as  usual<br>
<br>
A block further on, the children of the Junior <B>High</B> School were all 
out on the lawn.  Their building did not seem damaged but on circling to the rear the high brick chimney above the boiler room shattered, with a large chunk on the building side loosened ready to fall into the school.  It was a good thing for the kids that the shake didn't last longer.<br>
<br>
Downtown, a similar chimney did fall from a building, coming to rest in the tangled debris of the display room of a store.<br>
<br>
To the south of town several buildings at the State Training School for Boys were badly shattered and partly collapsed, reminding me of the wrecked schools of Long Beach, California, on March 10, 1933.  At Castle Rock  High School one of the students was struck down by falling brick from above the entrance as he left the school for 
lunch, while at Longview, on the alluvial plain of <B>the </B>Columbia River, heavy damage had occured at places.<br>
<br>
At Centralia damage similir to that of Chehalis had been suffered, killing one man downtown who was struck by the falling walls of a 2-story coiner building.<br>
<br>

By this time I had calmed down sufficiently to turn on the radio in the car.  Hearing the reports of disaster broadcast, I realized that I had better start for home.  As I neared the town of Tenino, north of Centralia, the broadcast told of its shattered buildings and of streets strewn with wreckage, but as I drove through, it was "business as usual." False Alarm! Although real damage had<br>
been done in many areas, the radio broadcasts were increasingly     excited, exaggerated, and not dependable.<br>
<br>
It soon became evident that the shock over the whole area had been of a rolling nature which, like the shaking of a bowl of jelly, amplified the movement of structures on the earth's surface, par-
ticularly on soft ground.  Some damage was done to buildings on firm, co-pacted gravelly deposits also, but only sufficient to indicate that these areas, too, could be shaken strongly, given the right provocation.<br>
<br>

<B>Concealed weaknesses come to view</B><br>
<br>
Outside Olympia at an old I-story and basement wooden elementary school structure one complete chimney fell away from the building and spread its lenlth over the playground.  The top thr@e feet of another chimney crashed through the roof and ceiling to the solid floor beside the blackboard of a classroom.  No, there were no casualties, for the children were on vacatlon.<br>
<br>
The School Board had apparently foreseen the need for a better building, because across the street was a new stucco   school    just ready for occupancy.<br>
<br>
It showed no damage, for according to qualified observers from California it was of the earthquake resistant design closely approaching the concept of engineers and architects experienced in areas where earthquakes admittedly occur.<br>
<br>
In Olympia another school was nearing completion.  An unreinforced masonry partition showed a very distinct crack about 8 ft. long, although green mortar generally concealed this weakness from public view.  It was interesting to note that the reported cost for the new, substantially safe elementary school was $10 per sq. ft. of floor area wfiile that of the other, uncertain but ornate school was approximately $15 per sq. ft.<br>
<br>

<B>Capitol buildings sitting ducks</B><br>
<br>
Olympia was close to the epicenter of the earthquake and damage was noticeably greater in the larger structures.  Buildings of the State Capitol group, typical of many stone-faced masonry structures built throughout the country without regard to seismic shock were materially damaged.<br>

The 80-ft. diameter stone-faced reinforced concrete dome of the capitol building erected in 1925 and rising 231 ft. above the entrance terrace showed little damage but that was not so concerning the stone lantern above it.  As might be expected in a building of this type built without a continuous frame and having 
a heavy inverted pendulum forming the dome, large deformations were set up by the earthquake which caused the near-collapse of this lantern as well as typical shear cracks and minor movements in other parts of the structure.<br>
<br>
Many of the stones of the lantern were separated from the adjoining ones, a few had dropped out and others were hanging loose when the quake stopped.<br>
<br>
Other buildings of the capitol group were broken, too.  Parapets and cornices were down and many characteristic diagonal cracks were noted in interior partitions and walls.  It was particularly evident that the large blocks of stone, wherever they were, had practically no mechanical anchors or ties to each other or to the backing, if any existed.<br>
<br>
They were just sitting there like ducks on a pond.  It was noted and confirmed later, too, that in common with many similar structures of the same or greater age, Little mortar existed in many vertical joints and not much more was seen in any of the bed joints.<br>
<br>
In Olympia's business district substantial damage was suffered, too, while two tall brick chimneys on the tongue of the harbor alluvial fill were damaged.  One broke and fell through the roof of its adjoining boiler plant and killed a man.<br>
<br>
Substantiating the severity of the shock which caused all this and other damage in Olympia, authenticated accelerograph records were obtained on instruments of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, located near the State Highway Laboratory on the downtown tideflat fill.<br>
<br>
These records showed that the force exerted by this quake was more than 4 times the force normally used in designs for complete earthquake reinforcement as done in California where carthquake-
resistant design is now standard practice.<br>
<br>

<B>Damage at Tacoma</B><br>
<br>
At Tacoma, too, were occurrences of great interest, both on the lowlands and upon the hard gravel of the high land above the business district.  To the westward the new Tacoma Narrows Bridge was under construction.  A very heavy cast steel saddle which ultimately was to receive one of the great cables supporting the bridge was temporarily resting on wood blocking 3 ft. above the top
of the high bridge tower, bolted tight to the tower top plate with four 1-in. vertical rods.<br>
<br>
During the quake, according to the testimony of men working on the tower, the top moved at least 6 ft. from its position of rest, then snapped back the same or greater distance the other way, breaking the bolts and throwing the casting off.  It crashed through a work barge on the water 65 ft. to one side and 507 ft. below.<br>
<br>
On the Tacoma lowlands as in Olympia, high factory chimneys broke off, parapet walls fell, and a 75-ft. high brick wall fractured 15 ft. from the top, moved out 5 in., but didn't collapse.  On hard ground high above the business district the stone masonry tower of the 60-yearold county courthouse was badly racked by the shocks.  It was so fractured in the uppor portion that collapse probably would have been certain had the earth movement continued, according to testimony of the building inspector and consulting structural engineers later on.<br>
<br>
In contrast, a local senior building group pooh-poohed the danger of collapse and pleaded "don't demolish it-only the cracks need be pointed up.  It is a fine example of period architecture and it would be a shame to tear it down." They gave little thought to the fact that structures once cracked and broken remain in that state of suspended destruction until the next quake occurs, then anything could happen.<br>
<br>
They gave no consideration to the fact that the main structure far below was used by the public, or that it contained the county jail which housed many people against their will, all carrying definite responsibilities for maintaining protection. (Note: the dangerous portion of the tower was later removed.)<br>
<br>

<B>Strange things at Puyallup</B><br>
<br>
In nearby Puyallup, strange things had happened.  Located on natural alluvium having the ground water level 2 to 3 ft. below the surface, many of the brick buildings (which dated back many years) were damaged.  Cornices and upper walls had collapsed.  Low build-
ings bumped against higher ones having a different rate of motion in the earthquake, breaking the higher walls as they stopped short in their square dancing.<br>
<br>
Brick moved on brick as much as 3 in. outward at floor and roof levels of some large buildings, leaving the walls precariouslv near failure.  Broken brick lined the wide cracks that were left when street faces of stores stopped on their weaving way, to the sidewalk below, lacking the "pushover" of the usual aftershocks.<br>
<br>
But this was not all.  Throughout the town at least 200 chimneys
were rotated up to 45 degrees, generally in a clockwise direction with respect to the building, but few fell.  Geysers of muddy water rose in many yards to heights as much .is 3 ft., forming circular de posits of black, sandy clay while in some basements the surging earth pushed the floors up, crushing the furnaces and piping against the joists above.<br>
<br>
Closed to public view and not under jurisdiction of the city building department and code, the unanchored roof and ceiling beams over the stage of the Puyallup High School auditorium slid off their supporting masonry walls and crashed down upon the floor below.  Three students who were there when the quake started 
managed to be <B>clear</B> when the $100,000 crash came.<br>
<br>
"Almost" at Seattle<br>
<br>
Seattle, fortunately, was on the northerly border of the earthquake's strong rumbling and rubbling and except for buildings on soft ground, it suffered comparatively little from the shakeup.  Not that the buildings were resistant to earthquakes, I hasten to add (for they were far from it) but because the shaking stopped too soon for damage to develop much beyond the cracking stage.<br>
<br>
Structures on hard ground were shaken, but not hard enough to hurt much.  Masonry partitions were cracked and spalied, plaster fell, terra cotta facing loosened or sheared.  On soft ground especially, many old building fronts and parapet walls broke their bonds to the rest of the structure but did not receive impetus enough to crash to the street.<br>
<br>
With a goodly part of their "earthquake life" gone, they now remain in their weakened condition ready to fall upon the people on the walks, come the next quake.  Even without the seismic urge, three or more heavy chunks of masonry have fallen in downtown streets of Seattle in recent months, narrowly missing pedestrians.<br>
<br>
Damage on the tide-flat<br>
<br>
On the water-saturated, jelly-like tideflat fill extending from west Seattle to the lower downtown section, however, substantial damage was done.  Structures built on piles along the waterfront were whipped violently.  A 50,000-gal. wood stave water tank resting on a reinforced concrete platform on 20-ft. high concrete columns above the building had suffered damage to the columns in the 1946 earthquake.<br>
<br>
Presumably adequately repaired at that time, but still fractured and weakened at the points of greatest stress, in this the succeeding quake it was precipitated to demolition.  Its concrete platform crashed down through the concrete roof slab to the floor below breaking refrigeration lines, destroying the building's two elevators and putting the 7-story reinforced concrete refrigeration
warehouse out of service for weeks.<br>
<br>
Cables supporting elevators in other buildings jumped out of their sheaves.  A heavy track-mounted electric transformer moved up and off its supports at a substation and landed on the ground 17 in. away.<br>
<br>
Elsewhere in the area pre 1900 brick walls were collapsed, frac-
tured or bulged and several old downtown buildings south of James Street were so dangerously damaged tilat they were later condemned and removed.<br>

<br>
THE 1949 EARTHQUAKE.<br>
<br>
Franklin P. Ulrich, "Reporting the Northwest Earthquake from the Scientific Point of View," <B>Building Standards Monthly.</B> June 1949, p. 8-11.<br>
<br>
The Coast and Geodetic Survey using instrumental data from 
thirty-five seismological stations received by April 21 fixed <B>a 
</B>provisional epicenter at 47.1 north latitude and 122.7 west longitude (between Olympia and Tacoma).<br>
<br>
The following is abstracted from a recent press report: "The Geology Department of the University of Washington at Seattle tentatively placed the epicenter along the Bordeaux Fault near the junction of Lewis, Thurston and Grays harbor counties.  This fault runs from Independence Creek, near the counties' juncture, northeastward toward Olympia." (In the direction of the epicenter determined by the Coast and (Geodetic Survey).<br>
<br>
"The evidence of the existence of this fault is the marked difference in the kind of rock on the west side which is largely hard lava while on the east side it is shale and sandstone in which original layers have been raised and folded.  The extent of this fault is not known as several hundred feet of glacial deposit cover the earth from Olympia to Tacoma."<br>
<br>
The extent and direction of the most heavily damaged area would indicate possible movement along the fault for a considerable distance. (In the 1906 earthquake in California the surface rupture was visible for about 270 miles.) Locations of the epicenter im-
mediately after the earthquake and from only a few stations were
considerably in error as the severity of the shock and inadequate time control made interpretation of records of near-by stations very uncertain.<br>
<br>
The isoseismal map (subject to revision as additional information becomes available) shows the extent of tile area over which the shock was felt and also the intensities at the various places.  The information for the isoseismal map was compiled from many press reports; from field investigations by C. K. Stiff engineer, Factory Mutual Insurance Companies) and S. E. Warner (geophysicist, U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey) ; from a special questionnaire to building inspectors in the damaged area and regular questionnaire coverages made bv State Collaborators in Seismology for the Coast and Geodetic Survev: Professor Harold A. Culver, Pullman, Washington; Dr. Vernon E. Scheid, Moscow, Idaho; and Professor E. L. Packard, Corvallis, Oregon.<br>
<br>
The isoseismal map shows that the shock was felt over an area in the United States of approximately 150,000 square miles.  The area of greatest intensity extended from Granite Falls south along the east side of Puget Sound to Olympia then south through Chehalis, Castle Rock to Longview and east and west of this line in river valleys.<br>
<br>
In the region of greatest intensity eight deaths were caused directly or indirectly by the earthquake and at least sixty-five persons were seriously injured.  Shortly after the earthquake the press estimated damage at twenty million dollars.  From latter and more complete information it is believed that this estimate is entirely too small and the writer tentatively estimates that the ultimate total damage will be nearer to fifty million.<br>
<br>
A representative of a group of insurance com anies tentatively estimated that the total damage would be between thirty and fifty million dollars.<br>
<br>
Other estimates of damage range from ten million up. Washington State Superintendent of Schools estimated the damage to thirty public schools in western Washington as between six and ten million dollars.<br>
<br>
Damage from an earthquake is not always immediately apparent.  Settlement of foundations and walls with consequent cracking of walls and plaster may not be discovered until several months after the shock.<br>
<br>
Detailed reports of all damage would be beyond the scope of this report.  The University of Washington is undertaking the collection and compilation of the earthquake damage as a special project which will require months to complete.  In general, damage was confined mostly to the less stable ground, such as marshy, alluvial or
filled land and to older structures, particularly old masonry construction with lime mortar which was built prior to modern building regulations.<br>
<br>
However, there were many exceptions where old buildings on firm ground and new buildings on soft ground were destroyed.  There was considerable cracking of ground, ejection of sand and water by temporar)' geysers; considerable damage to bridges, docks, water mains and pavements.  A cliff 300 feet high and a half-mile long in the northern part of Tacoma toppled into Puget Sound.<br>
<br>
Abstracts of damage for a number of the larger cities are<br>
given as follows:<br>
<B><br>
AUBURN.<br>
<br>

EARTHQUAKE OF 1949.<br>
<br>
Clyde N. Dirlam, "Reporting the Northwest Earthquake, damage to buildings," <B>Building Standards Monthly.</B> XVIII (June, 1949) p. 4-11.<br>
<br>
In accordance with instructions, I visited the Puget Sound area for the purpose of investigating the damage to buildings and other structures following the earthquake on April 13. I arrived in Seattle on the morning of April 15 and spent a considerable amount of time examining and photographing buildings damaged in Seattle.  Later I visited Tacoma and Olympia for the same purpose.<br>
<br>
This earthquake, which occurred on April 13 at 11:50 a.m., has been 
classed as <B>a </B>"near strong" shock.  The epicenter has been located near Shelton, which is about fortyfive miles southwest of Seattle.  The shock was felt from Portland, Oregon, northward to Vancouver, B. C., and was apparently strongest along the coast, the principal 
damage having been in Olympia, Tacoma, Seattle and <B>a </B>few smaller cities.<br>
<br>
Press notices state that the intensity has been fixed at about seven or eight on the Modified Mercalli Scale.  The building damage does not seem to bear out this value of intensity at the points of maximum damage.<br>
<br>
There have been no destructive shocks in this region for man), years.  One notable shock occurred in 1939 and two in 1946.<br>
<br>
SEATTLE
The principal building damage at Seattle is confined to an area 
adjacent to Pioneer Square.  This area was <B>at </B>one time <B>a </B>tide flat, which has since been filled in.  The damaged structures rest on wood pile foundations.  Most of them were built about sixty years ago.  They are of brick masonry of inferior quality with a weak 
mortar and <B>are</B> largely lacking in the anchorage of floor and roof joists.<br>
<br>
The story heights are high and there are generally many openings in 
the <B>walls.  </B>These features, combined with the unstable foundation, together with neglect and deterioration of buildings, make such 
structures <B>an </B>easy prey to earthquake forces, although it should be noted that there are many buildings of the same age in the same area which are apparently undamaged.<br>
<br>

The damaged structures comprise only <B>a </B>small percentage of the total number of buildings in the area. Outside of this area an old 
school building located <B>at </B>California and Lander Streets in West Seattle was badly damaged. There is a noticeable lack of joist anchors in the gables.  The quantity of brick falling from the 
gables and chimneys could easily have produced fatalities had <B>the</B> school been in session.<br>
<br>

<B>It </B>is noteworthy that the interior of the building and walls below 
the roof line were not damaged beyond <B>a </B>few plaster cracks and that the building could be reoccupied with little repair work.  Other school buildings in Seattle sustained only slight damage, princi-

pally from falling brick chimneys.  Only two are <B>to </B>be abandoned 
for the <B>present.</B><br>
<br>
The larger and newer buildings in Seattle were only slightly 
damaged, mostly in the way of <B>plaster </B>cracks <B>and</B> cracked <B>terra 
cotta </B>facing.  There <B>are, </B>however, <B>a </B>few loose parapet <B>walls </B>which 
<B>will </B>require rebuilding.  The newer portion of the business 
<B>district </B>is built on higher and more solid ground.  There <B>were a 
</B>few breaks in <B>water </B>and gas <B>mains; not </B>enough to be <B>a </B>serious menace, however.<br>
<br>

Viaducts and bridges were not damaged with <B>the </B>exception of the 
movable bridges <B>over </B>the Duwamish Waterway.  Movements of <B>the earth 
</B>banks caused displacement of the abutments.  Lift bridaes which were open at the time of the shock could not be closed, and those 
which were closed could not be opened.  <B>Tall </B>chimneys, of which 
there <B>are a </B>number in Seattle, were undamaged and were obviousiv 
not subjected <B>to </B>the forces to which similar structures in Olympia were exposed.<br>
<br>

Very little damage to residential chimneys <B>was </B>observed, although there are many brick chimneys of more than ordinarv height on the dwellings in that city.<br>

<B>TACOMA</B><br>
<br>

Only a comparatively small amount of damage <B>was </B>done in Tacoma.  A 
school building similar to the Lafayette School in Seattle <B>was 
</B>damaged, a brick gable having fallen above an entrance, causing one fatality.  A steel cable saddle which was being placed on the top of the tower of the new Tacoma Bridge was shaken off and fell 
through <B>a </B>barge in the channel.<br>
<br>
The earthquake cracked ground adjacent to the banks of the Tacoma 
Narrows <B>caus</B>ing a landslide some time after the earthquake.  This 
<B>eii</B>dangered a number of dwelling houses.<br>
<br>

Little damage <B>to </B>residential chimneys was observed, although, <B>as </B>in Seattle, there are many brick chimneys of more than ordinary height.<br>
<br>
OLYMPIA<br>
<br>
Olympia is located nearer the epicenter than is Seattle or Tacoma.  Damage was sustained by several industrial and commercial buildings, by the old State Building and by buildings on the new Capitol grounds.  The dome on the Capitol is considered unsafe because of the shifting of a heavy stone lantern at the peak of the dome.  The State Insurance Building was damaged.<br>
<br>
A brick chimney 250 feet high was broken off 60 to 75 feet from the top and masonry fell on a boiler house and on another structure, producing one fatality.  This chimney rested on a wood pile foundation on a tide flat fill.  Other brick chimneys close by were similarly shattered.<br>
<br>
A considerable amount of damage to residential chimneys was observed, unlike the experience in Seattle and Tacoma.<br>
<br>
The press reports eight fatalities in the entire state; only four of these, however, were due directly to the earthquake, in each case being caused by falling masonry.  The total amount of damage seems small compared to the reputed violence and large extent of the shock, and the many places of habitation within the area of disturbance.<br>
<br>
Appreciable damage has been sustained by about eleven hundred dwelling houses in the western part of Washington.  The total loss has been placed at various sums, but fifteen million dollars sftms to be the average.<br>
     
One of the principal lessons to be learned from our study of building behavior in this shock is a re-emphasis on the hazard due to unanchored and improperly built parapet and gable walls which can be thrown to the sidewalk during an earthquake shock.  These are usually located over the entrances where people are likely to be exiting during the course of an earthquake.<br>
<br>
If existing hazardous walls could be eliminated, lives could be saved when a heavy shock visits the community.  Consideration should he given to the enactment of legislation that would make this possible in localities where earthquakes are to be expected.<br>
<br>
My observation indicates that our present Uniform Building Code provisions regarding lateral force do not need to be changed.  It is my opinion that any structure designed in compliance with the Uniform Building Code would have passed through this shock with practically no structural damage.<br>
<br>
SUMMARY<br>
<br>
1.      Damage in this shock was confined largelv to old buildings of inferior construction.<br>
<br>
2.     A building can be a serious menace to life through falling parapet or gable walls although the total damage to the building may be light.<br>
<br>
3.     Old masonry structures whch have high story beights and are of inferior construction and may have been neglected become a serious hazard in an earthquake.<br>
<br>
4.      Parapet walls should be properly designed and anchored to resist lateral forces.<br>
<br>
5.      If the masonry parapet walls on existing buildings could  be removed or rebuilt through legislation or persuasion, lives could be saved in the event of an earthquake.<br>

A KIDS VIEW OF THE 1949 EARTHQUAKE.<br>
<br>
One of the privileges of being in the Fifth grade at Madison School
in Tacoma's South Tacoma Neighborhood was being allowed to work in the Lunch room kitchen.  The hot lunch program had only been in operation for a couple of years at Madison and pupils were selected to help out in return for a free lunch.<br>
<br>
I did my best at dish washing and could get plates into the hot rinse water as fast as the woman who was running the lifter could get them out. It was hot work but the women seemed to like me and I believe I received extra large portions of lunch for my help.<br>
Besides it was a "job" even though I didn't get paid the only drawback being I missed time with the teacher Delma Mickleson who had just moved to Tacoma from Hawaii and had replaced  Gladys O'Neill as a teacher at Madison.<br>
<br>
When the earthquake of April 13, 1949 first hit the large refrigerator in the kitchen on the east and outside wall of the school starting rattling. Thinking something was wrong with the machinery one of the women pulled the plug and when it still kept going she yelled, "Lets get out of here!"<br>
<br>
I was dressed in a rubberized apron and had gloves on but I ran too. We exited from the school through the outside door by the kitchen. Since it was getting close to the end of the lunch period most of the pupils were out in the playfield anyway and they just stayed put.<br>
<br>
The chimney was billowing black smoke as it never had before and everyone just stood there, frightened as they could be not knowing what to do.  After a short time the rumbling stopped and the ground stopped swaying. The silly girls who cried were crying and even some of the boys.<br>
<br>
I soon returned to my post in the kitchen and someone  plugged in the refigerator and after we got most of the dishes done we sat down to our lunch since food for a fifth grader was certainly more important than a little rocking around.<br>
<br>
We heard a little later of damage done to other schools in the area. Larry Baldwin who I knew from Church activities was at Lowell School and was close to the place where the boy who was killed by falling walls was standing.<br>
<br>
Later we found out that Whitman School had been condemned and thereafter Madison school received a number of students who had gone to Whitman before the quake including Herman Nettleton.<br>
<br>
The newspapers reported the complete destruction of life as we knew it around the country and we even got a telephone call from Uncle Carl Fuller in Utah to see if he should come to rescue us.<br>

INTRODUCTION</B><br>
<br>
On April 29,1965, at 8:29 a.m., Pacific Daylight Saving Time, the Puget Sound, Washington region was shaken by the second largest earthquake known to have occurred in the area since 1833.  This re-
port is a preliminary interpretation of seismological data obtained from permanent seismograph stations throughout the world, temporary seismograph stations established in the epicentral area immediately following the earthquake, intensity reports, and inspection of the epicentral area.<br>
<br>
Seismological data available were unusually abundant.  Four permanent seismograph stations recorded the earthquake at distances less than 80 km from the epicenter, thus permitting the determination of a somewhat more accurate focal depth for this earthquake than is normally possible.  Excellent seismograms were written by three strong motion seismographs, all located within 50 km of the epicenter. Felt data reports were received from locations in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and Idaho.<br>
<br>
Four temporary seismographic stations were in operation within three days after the earthquake.  The widespread cover of glacial material in the area reduced the operating magnification of the temporary stations and is also believed to be an important factor in ex-
plaining the distribution of seismic intensities near the epicenter.<br>
<br>
<B>GEOLOGIC SETTING</B><br>
<br>
The Puget Sound region is a geomorphic and structural depression characterized by low rolling hills and depressions occupied by rivers, lakes, or the waters of Puget Sound.  It separates the Cascade Mountains to the east from the Olympic Mountains to the west.  The two ranges are arches or broad antidines and Puget Sound is a broad depression consisting of a series of shales, sandstones and lavas of Tertiary age folded into antidines and synclines.<br>
<br>
The Olympic Mountains are composed of folded and faulted quartzites, graywackes and highly indurated sandy shales probably of
pre-Tertiary age.  Fringing the Olympics is an enormous thickness of basaltic flows and pyroclastics of early Eocene age (Coombs and Barksdale, 1942).  The Cascade Range is a post-batholithic volcanic complex in southem Washington but consists of the Nevadan complex in northern Washington (Eardley, 1962).<br>
<br>
The Puget Sound area consisted of a vast erosion surface at the beginning of Tertiary time.  Early in the Eocene epoch this erosion surface began to subside and was subsequently covered with Metchosin volcanics with a minimum average thickness of approximately 3,000 feet.  A north-south trough with its axis in the approximate position of the present Puget Sound depression had formed by the close of Metchosin volcanism.<br>
<br>
Eight to fourteen thousand feet of sediments, known as the Puget group in the Seattle region, were deposited in this trougli.  Liesch, Price, and Walters (1963) have summarized the Tertiary and Quatemary history of the Puget Sound area as follows:<br>
<br>
"Tertiary:<br>
<br>
A.     Late in the Eocene epoch over 12,000 feet of earbonaceous shale, sandstone, coal beds, andesitic tuff and volcanic breccia accumulated on a gradually sinking coastal plain.<br>
<br>
B.     During the Oligocene and Miocene epochs about 8,000 feet of marine shale, sandstone and conglomerate were deposited, probably concurrently with the extrusion of andesitic flows of unknown thickness.<br>
<br>
C.     Commencing late in Miocene time, the area was deformed by folds       trending approximately N700W.<br>
<br>
D.     The north-trending Cascade and Olympic Mountains were uplifted in the Pliocene.<br>
<br>
Quatemary:<br>
<br>
E.     The Puget Sound Basin was partially filled by at least three periods of glaciation separated and followed by lacustrine, alluvial, and marine deposition of clay, silt, sand, gravel, and peat.<br>
<br>
F.     Relative uplift of the Puget Sound Basin resulted in a period       of canyon cutting.  Much of the present depth and width of the Puget Trough, and the valleys occupied by Lake Washington, Sammamish Lake, and the Snoqualmie River, may have been formed during this period.<br>
<br>
G.     Advance of the Vashon glacier in Wisconsin t i m e deepened and widened north-trending valleys.  Thick bodies of sand, gravel, and till were deposited over the area, particularly in valleys transverse to the direction of ice movement.
H.     Retreat of the Vashon iee occurred at ImA 14,000 years ago.  A series of ice-dammed finger-shaped lakes eroded spillways across the uplands. Ice-contact stratified drift was deposited over much of the area.<br>
<br>
I.     Period of alluvial valley filling and localized peat deposition, minor erosion, and soil development."<br>
<br>
Folding occurred in Miocene time which, according to Eardley (1962), was of low to medium intensity and trending generally northwest.  It has, in general, been difficult to identify faulting in the Puget Sound area because of the predominance of glacial material.  In most cases faults have been shown in the literature as normal.<br>
<br>
The preponderance of glacial deposits in the epicentral area has a significant influence on the seismic intensity observed.  LieKh, Price, and Walters (1963) have prepared geologic maps of northwestern King County, Washington, and Paulson, et al. (1952), have presented a comprehensive soil survey of the same ama.  It is hoped that subsequent work may be able to closely relate the known geology to the observed seismic intensity.<br>
<br>
The western slope of the Cascade Mountains is an abrupt escarpment which rises from the lowlands bordering Puget Sound at elevations of 50 to 200 feet, to a height of several thousand feet above sea level.  The northern part of the Cascades is composed mostly of a complex mass of plutonic and metamorphic rocks which represent the basement upon which the lavas of the southern Cascades were poured.  In the northern Cascades, volcanics occur only as a discontinuous veneer.<br>
<br>
The northwest-southeast folding in the Puget Sound area consequently intersects the north-south escarpment of the western slope of the Cascades at an angle.  This relationship has suggested to geologists that the northern Cascades were bordered <B>on </B>the west by a great fault.  Bradford and Waters (1934), in the course of their study of the Tolt River earthquake of July 17, 1932, investigated this suggestion of faulting and discovered evidence for a fault striking more or less north-south between the towns of North Bend and Sultan.<br>
<br>
They gave the following evidence for faulting: (1) At a point about 4 miles from North Bend a section of sedimentary rock more than 3,000 feet thick dips toward Mount Si at angles of 20" or more and the exposures can be traced continuously to within 100 yards of <B>tlie </B>4,000 foot escarpment of Mount Si.<br>
<br>
In the space of 100 yards the thick section of uniformly dipping rocks could not be bent into a position so that it could pass over the top of the mountain in unconformable relation, and the contact cannot be intrusive because of the age relationship of the rocks,
the absence of metamorphism, and the lack of veins and clikes in the sedimentary strata.<br>
<br>
They concluded that only a major fault could explain the observed field relations. (2) Fault breccia and slickensides were found at several locations discussed in detail by the authors.  Geologic mapping in western Washington and particularly in the Puget Sound area is extremely difficult because of the widespread cover of glacial material.  Consequently, the nature of faulting is difficult to establish and much of it is unknown -at the present time.<br>
<br>
The Puget Sound region is part <B>of a</B> moderately active zone of seismicity extending from the vicinity of Portland, Oregon north through Puget Sound to the Canadian border and Vancouver Island. ne first earthquake listed by Townley and Allen (1939) in their cata-
logue of Washington earthquakes occurred on June 29, 1833 in Thurston County, near the southern end of Puget Sound.<br>
<br>
The same authors state that their listing is practically complete for moderate shocks perceptible over areas of 50,000 square miles for that portion of the State lying west of the Cascade Range.  Heck and Eppley (1958) and records of the Coast and Geodetic Survey since 1958 list 113 earthquakes with a Modified Mercalli intensity of V or greater in Washington from 1841 through April 1965.<br>
<br>
The earthquakes are distributed in maximum intensity as follows: One of intensity VIII; seven of intensity VII; thirty-one of intensity VI; sixty-three of intensity V; and eleven others for which the maximum intensity could not be determined but are believed to have an intensity of V or greater.<br>
<br>
Historically, the Puget Sound area has been subjected to frequent earthquakes of moderate intensity.  The four largest earthquakes in the Puget Sound area since 1833 occurred in 1939, 1946, 1949, and 1965.<br>
<br>
The largest known earthquake in the history of the State Occurred on April 13, 1949.  <B>The </B>epicenter was located between Olympia and Tacoma along the southern edge of Puget Sound.  The maximum Modified Merealli intensity was VIII and the magnitude was 7.1 (Murphy and Ulrich, 1951).<br>
<br>
The spatial relationship between the April 13, 1949 and the April 29, 1965 shock is shown in Figure 1. Eight people were killed in the 1949 earthquake and many injured.  Property damage in Seattle, Tacoma and Olympia was approximately $25,000,000.  The earthquake was felt over an area of 150,000 square miles.  The seismological aspects of the 1949 earthquake have been discussed by Nuttli (1952).<br>
     
The November 12,1939 earthquake with a maximum intensity of VII and a magnitude  of 5 3/4 was felt over an area of 60,000 square miles in the United States.  The felt area in Canada could not be eom-
Plately determined.  Earthquake damage was confined to fallen and twisted chimneys, creeked masonry, concrete and plaster (Bodle, 1941).<br>
<br>
No structural collapse of buildings was reported.  The most severe damage was in Centralia, Elma and Olympia.  Coombs and Barksdale (1942) have discussed the macroseismic effects of the earthquake in some detail.<br>
<br>
The epicenter of the February 14, 1946 few deaths were charged indirectly to the earthquake was 18 miles north of Olympia shocks, <B>and </B>damage was estimated at $250,000 and about 7 miles northeast of the 1949, most of it occurring in Seattle.  The shock.  The magnitude was &3/4 and the depth of focus was estimated at 25 km or maximum reported intensity was VII. more (Bodle and Murphy, 1948).  Felt The felt area was 70,000 square miles.  A aftershocks occurred 20 to 30 seconds after the main shock and the following morning at 4:18 a.m. (Barksdale and Coombs, 1946).<br>
<br>
In July 1949, modern seismic instrumentation was installed in Seattle and a much clearer picture of local seismicity emerged.  During 1950, the Seattle station recorded 77 earthquakes with epicentral distances of 70 or less from Seattle (Vesanen and Jones, 1951).<br>
<br>
Thirty-nine of these shocks were within a distance of 1" from Seattle.  Neumann (1959) discussed the instrumental location of earthquakes in the Puget Sound area from 1951 to 1957, developed travel times, and studied the crustal layering and velocity distribution.  Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the seismicity of Puget Sound and vicinity is the increase in seismic activity within the last quarter century.<br>
<br>
With the possible exception of a shock in 1872, no earthquake with a reported intensity greater than VI has been known to occur between 1833 and 1939.  From 1939 through April 1965, three earthquakes of intensity VII and one of intensity VIII occurred within an area of approximately 800 square miles.<br>
<br>
Several authors (Heiskanen, 1951; Bodle and Murphy, 1948) liave remarked on the large gravity anomaly associated with Puget Sound.  The epicenters of all four large earthquakes that have occurred in the last 26 years are loeated on the flanks of rather large Bouguer anomalies as shown on the Bouguer Gravity Map of tlie United States (1964).<br>
<br>
<B>HYPOCENTER, </B>ORIGIN <B>TIME </B>AND <B>MAGNITUDE</B><br>

<br>
The digital computer program described by Engdahl and Gunst (1965) was used for the computation of the hypocenter of the April 29 earthquake.  Four hypocenter computations were made using various dat,,t sets.  In some cases, the depth of focus was const..rained to an arbitrary, but reasonable value.  The first computation used P phase arrival time from 120 stations.  These data were considered to be the most reliable that were available.<br>
<br>
The depth of focus was not constrained.  Stations located at distances greater than 250 were used in tlie second hypocenter com-
putation in order to eliminate the effects of velocity and crustal layering variations in the crust and upper mantle on hypocentral location.  The focal depth was constrained to 60 km since there is practically no focal depth resolution possible when all the data are recorded at distances greater than 250.<br>
<br>
Twenty-five stations grouped to provide as nearly as possible uniform coverage in azimuth were used in the fourth hypocenter computation.<br>
<br>
For the two data sets in which the depth was computed, the variation in depth of focus is only 2 km.  The calculation using 60 stations at distances greater than 250 probably displaces the epicenter eastward for the following reasons: First, the crustal velocity is, on the average, lower than it is to the west of the epicenter and second there were more stations used that are east of the epicenter than west of it.<br>
<br>
The calculation using stations distributed as equally as possible in azimuth may be significant.  Unfortunately, only a rather small number  of stations are available for this type of calculation.  The depth of focus is believed to be well determined, probably within <B>@10</B> km.<br>
<br>
Four stations were within 80 km of the epicenter and the largest residual among these stations was 1.2  seconds. It is concluded that the best hypocentral location was obtained using readings from 120 stations.  This location is 47.40N latitude and 122.3"W longitude, focal depth, 59 km.  The origin time was 15:28:43.6 G.M.T.<br>
<br>
The body wave magnitude (Mb) as com-puted routinely by the Coast and Geodetic Survey was 6.5. This magnitude is corrected for a focal depth of 59 km using the charts published by Gutenberg and Richter (1956).  A surface wave magnitude (M.) was also computed using the computed horizontal ground amplitude, in microns of the maximum amplitude surface wave with periods near 20 wonds recorded on a horizontal seismometer. in practice, the amplitudes determined from each horizontal seismometer are combined vectorially.  No depth cokrection was applied to the surface wave magnitude.<br>

<B>INTENSITY</B><br>
<br>
The April 29 earthquake was felt over 130,000 square miles, a felt area exceeded only by the 1949 earthquake in the same vicinity.<br>
<br>
The earthquake was characterized by a relatively large intensity VII area and small pockets of intensity VIII damage in Seattle and surrounding suburbs.  Extensive damage to chimneys was noted in West Seattle.  The number of damaged chimneys in 188 city blocks of West Seattle were counted.  It was found that 1,712 chimneys of the 5,005 in this area were damaged. The ratio of damaged chimneys to the total number in each block has been plotted for each block surveyed.  Since the city blocks in this area are rectangles of approximately tive of the damage in the area.<br>
<br>
The relative same size, the ratio of damaged to tion of this observed damage to the local total number of chimneys is representative of geology, particularly the distribution and<br>
pockets of high intensity which might be considered as fitting marginally into the Modified Merealli VIII intensity were Harbor Island in South Seattle and Issaquah, about 15 miles cast of Seattle.  A brick garage partially collapsed and one school was extensively damaged in Issaquah.<br>
<br>
There was also considerable damage to chimneys in this area.  Damage in the Harbor Island area of Seattle and the other observed vibration damage are discussed in detail in the engineering por-
tion of this report.<br>
<br>
Although intensity VIII damage was observed in a few areas, this earthquake is best described, in terms of intensity, as an earthquake with maximum intensity near the upper limit of intensity VII.  Observed intensity VIII effects are difficult to evaluate because many of the buildings in these areas were damaged in previous earthquakes, notably in 1949.<br>

PUGET SOUND EARTHQUAKE OF 1965.<br>
<br>
Karl V. Steinbrugge and William K. Cloud, "Preliminary Engineering Report," <B>The Puget Sound Earthquake of April 29, 1965.</B> Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1965.<br>
<br>
Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia and neighboring cities in the State of Washington were damaged as the result of an earthquake which occurred at 8:29 a.m., Pacific Daylight Saving Time. The  Magnitude as given by the Coast and Geodetic Survey is 6.5, and the earthquake's epicenter has been placed at 13 miles southeast of downtown Seattle.<br>
<br>
The 1965 earthquake had a smaller Richter magnitude than did the last major earthquake in the same area which occurred on April 13, 1949 and had a 7.1 magnitude.  The 1949 shock had its epicenter between Tacoma and Olympia and was therefore located somewhat southwest of the 1965 earthquake.<br>
<br>
The damage pattern from the 1965 earthquake resembled that of the 1949 shock, with preliminary damage surveys indicating that the 1949 shock was the more destructive of the two.<br>
<br>
The focal depth of the 1965 earthquake has been tentatively placed at about 36 miles.  The focal depth of the 1949 shock was reported in USC&GS Serial 748 to be "slightly greater than nominal." In view of the 10 mile focal depth commonly given for the majority of California earthquakes, the deeper focal depth in these two shocks in Washington suggests <B>a </B>somewhat more moderate surface intensity over <B>a </B>wider area than comparable magnitude but shallower Califomia earthquakes.<br>
<br>
A general view of the 1965 preliminary damage data tends to confirm
this observation.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION  AND  ANALYSIS OF DAMAGE<br>
<br>
Property loss in the 1965 shock has been estimated at $12,500,000 by the Washington State Civil Defense Department, with much of this loss being in Seattle and in King County.  Reliable sources report $500,000 to $1,000,000 loss to the Boeing Company facilities and $1,500,000 damage to Seattle public schools.<br>
<br>
All of these estimates, made so shortly after the earthquake, are subject to considerable revision as more thoroughly developed data become available.  However, in view of the billions of dollars in property value in the affected area, the overall property loss from the earthquake must be considered to be slight.<br>
<br>
Three persons were killed from falling debris, three died apparently from heart attacks, and numerous injuries occurred.  Total collapses did not occur as far as is known to the authors.  In general, damage patterns repeated those of the 1949 shock.  Buildings which apparently had been damaged in 1949 often sustained additional damage in 1965.  This reccurring earthquake damage was sometimes intermixed with pre-earthquake settlement cracks which opened wider or caused failure in the 1965 earthquake.<br>
<br>
Single family dwellings in the affected areas are generally of wood frame construction, and are rarely more than two stories high.  Chimneys are usually brick masonry.  Interior partitions are gener-
ally plaster or gypsumboard on wood studs.  Performance of the wool frame dwellings was almost always excellent, and when damage occurred it was confined to plaster cracking and to unreinforced brick chimney failure at, or above, the roof line.<br>
<br>
By no means was the dwelling damage uniform throughout the city.  For example, pockets of intense chimney damage to dwellings were found in Seattle (notably in the West Seattle section) while nearby areas of similar construction had no chimney damage.  The damage pattern would sometimes change radically within several city blocks.  As a rule, wood frame dwelling damage rarely approached as much as 5 'yo of building value.<br>
<br>
One exception to the foregoing rule was unit masonry veneered wood frame structures, particularly brick veneer.  Fourinch brick veneer peeled off of a number of wood frame structures even though the veneer was anchored to the wood backing wall with galvanized metal anchors.<br>
<br>
The anchors usually remained nailed to the wood frame when the brick peeled off, and an examination of the mortar indicated that the mortar could be crushed by hand.  This type of veneer damage has been noted in many previous earthquakes, and the anchorage certainly demands more careful engineering supervision than is normally given
to it.<br>
<br>
Multistory buildings generally had slight or no damage, with the damage reported to new and to old structures.  Plaster cracking and other non-structural damage was found in multistory buildings in Seattle as well as in Tacoma (these cities being about 30 miles apart).  The spectacular damage reported by the press to a 10 story building in Tacoma may have been entirely confined to exterior window glass in a structure being essentially all glass on 3 sides, with the fourth side solid.<br>
<br>
Unreinforced brick bearing wall buildings with sand-lime mortar, as usual, bore the brunt of the damage.  This type of building generally lias wood roofs and wood supported floors, and is not earthquake resistive in any sense.  Numerous instances of parapet and gable failure occurred, and death and injury resulted from this type of damage.<br>
<br>
As previously mentioned, some of this could be associated with 1949 earthquake damage as well as with settlement damage which was not related to earthquakes.  The photographs accompanying this report, are typical examples of this type of damage in Seattle.<br>
<br>
A classic case of cumulative damage was found on the mud flats of Tacoma.  A two story brick bearing wall building was significantly damaged in the 1949 shock and the second story was subsequently re-<br>
moved.  It was apparent when inspected after the 1965 shock that differential settlements also had been occurring, and the 1965 shock found a building which had been weakened by both previous earthquake and settlement.<br>
<br>
The high apparent intensity at this location requires careful attention before being taken at face value.<br>
<br>
Modern buildings which were designed and constructed to be earthquake resistive performed well, as indicated they should in a moderate earthquake.  Not all modern structures performed well and four exceptions warrant mention.  A one-story warehouse, having a precast prestressed reinforced concrete roof and precast concrete tilt-up walls with poured in place pilasters, had no anchorage between the roof diaphragm and its end shear wall.<br>
<br>
The roof moved back and forth over the end shear wall, damaging the side walls.  A second instance of damage to a building presumably intended to be earthquake resistive occurred at a one-story market in which the steel angle earthquake x-bracing was embedded in a hollow concrete block wall; the relative rigidities of the elements were such that the hollow concrete block had to fail before the steel x-bracing could function.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the x-bracing was so located as to cut in two most of
the wall reinforcement.  A third instance of note was a large manufacturing facility having a very large, floor area; the second story precast reinforced concrete panels appeared to have worked loose from their supporting frame.<br>
<br>
The fourth example was a four story hollow concrete block apartment house in which the block shattered at several locations, and a remarkable absence of vertical reinforcing steel was noted.  The mere enactment of earthquake bruing laws does not automatically insure safe construction as was also shown in the 1964 Anchorage, Alaska earthquake.<br>
<br>
Eight Seattle public schools, housing 8,800 pupils, were closed until their safety could. be established.  Of these schools, the West Alki school was the most severely hit and may not be worth repairing.  Its 60 foot brick stack fell into the boiler room (see Figures 18 and 19) ; x-cracks were found in the unreinforced sand-lime mortar brickwork in the 1914 wing; stairs shifted; the north wall of the new wing moved outwarn; however, not everything fell from the shelves.  It should be added that the West Alki school was located in a pocket of high earthquake intensity.<br>
<br>
Pockets of high earthquake intensity, as typified by damage such as fallen chimneys, could almost always be associated with the local geology.  Damage was the most pronounced in what is commonly termed "poor ground" areas.  Ilem pockets were distributed over a large region, with the areas around these pockets having damage so slight that it was difficult to find it.<br>
<br>
In Seattle, a particularly noticeable damage pocket was the Alki Beach section of West Seattle where virtually every chimney was down. -Reportedly, similar intensified damage also occurred hem in 1949.  Additionally, the low lying and filled areas along the Du-<br>
wamish River and its mouth settled and were the locations of considerable building damage.<br>
<br>
Harbor Island at the mouth of the Duwamish River was a special high damage location.  Much, if not all, of this island was man-made, perhaps 50 or more years ago. The soils are not seismically stable by any standard.  On this island are located a number of major in-
dustrial facilities and it is of interest to discuss two damage examples of those known to have occurred.<br>
<br>
For one example, the Fisher Flouring Mills had extensive damage to its various buildings.  A 50,000 gallon wood roof tank on top of a 15-story structure fell seven stories onto the concrete roof of a grain bin, breaking the grain bin roof and spilling water onto the grain.<br>
<br>
Elsewhere, portions of the unreinforced brick walls fell from the
sixth story as may be seen in Figure 17.  An examination of this structure showed pre-1965 cracks in the brick walls, some of which apparently opened funlier in this earthquake.  Underground piping around the plant also broke.  Equipment in the building shifted and was out of line, and several days were required to put it back into alignment.  This plant reportedly had $50,000 damage in the 1949 shock, and the damage in 1965 appears to be greater.<br>
<br>
A second instance of damage on Harbor Island occurred at Piers #15 and #16.  These piers shifted toward the water by about one foot due to the soil losing much or aJI of its strength, or partially liquifying, and pushing the dock toward the water.  An exception was the northern extension of the pier which was under construction and did not yet have its soil backfill.<br>
<br>
Fire following the earthquake was not a serious problem.<br>
<br>
In Seattle, one house shifted and this shifting apparently resulted in an electrical short, with fire ensuing.  The fire alarm system remained in operation.  During the day the Seattle Fire Department had several hundred calls regarding loose chimneys and similar problems.  Olympia had no fires although seven alarms were turned in.<br>
<br>
Utility damage was not severe.  An excellent summary was prepared by the Washington Surveying and Rating Bureau:<br>
<br>
"Service from the various public utilities was, on the whole, uninterrupted.  Damage at the Spokane Street substation of Seattle City Light interrupted service for a few hours in a small area.  The Washington Natural Gas Company reported one minor break in the Puyallup area.<br>
<br>
"The Seattle Water Department had one break in a 12-inch main in the Harbpr Island area and minor breaks in small pipes in residential areas of unstable ground.  Four days a@r the earthquake, a break in a 20-inch main on Western Avenue at Spring Street resulted in water supply impairment for about one day to four sprinklered buildings supplied off this main.<br>
<br>
"In Everett, two of the three 48inch main supply conduits to the city failed.  These failures occurred where the lines are carried on trestles over Ebey Slough.  Industrial supply to the large consuming pulp mills was then shut down, the mills either closing down or going to river pumps.<br>
<br>
"With the 50 m.g.d. supply from the remaining line plus 10 m.g.d. from the 28-inch line No. 1 from Lake Chaplain and reservoir stcirage, normal fire flows were maintained available throughout the city.  Full service was restored the following day.  One other break
was reported in a 4-inch line in a residential district.<br>
<br>
"A number of breaks occurred in underground mains on plant sites and to overhead sprinkler piping.  These were mainly to those p@perties located on artificial fills in the southern part of Seattle, particularly Harbor Island, resulting in varying periods of impairment with some not yet being restored.<br>
<br>
Damage to overhead sprinkler piping was mainly to older systems without eartliquake bracing and flexible couplings.  An exception was to a number of newer systems in buildings located on artificial fill where suspended ceilings and light fixtures damaged sprinkler heads and piping."<br>
<br>
A damage survey of the city of Seattle is <B>iii </B>its closing stages at this writing.  The following is quoted, in part, from a letter report written by Fire Chief Gordon Vickery.<br>
<br>
"In the day or two following the earthquake, it became evident that the Fire Department, working in conjunction with the Building Department, might be in a position to render valu-<br>
able service by conducting a buildingby-building survey, to more accurately assess the extent of damage from the quake.  The effort was coordinated between the Fire Department, Building Department, and represntatives of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  On May 3, four days after the earthquake struck, our personnel were out in force actually conducting this survey.<br>
<br>
"In developing the mechanics of the program, it was d@ided tliat in those buildings where Fire Department inspectors found evidence of possible serious structural damage, the reports would be forwarded to the Building Department for re-survey by teams of qualified experts.<br>
<br>
"One survey was conducted on a continuous basis from May 3 through<br>
May 21.  During this time, a total of 1,440 man hours were expended, and 1,405 buildings were surveyed from roof to basement.  As a result of the survey, 91 buildings were found to have sustained apparent serious or extensive damage, and were recommended to the Building Department for re-survey by experts as rapidly as possible.<br>
<br>
One hundred and thirteen buildings were found to have sustained apparent moderate damage, and were recommended for re-survey as time and personnel would permit.  Two hundred and fifty buildings were found to have sustained superficial or light damage only.<br>
<br>
In this group there was no apparent need <B>for </B>a follow-up survey, as damage consisted of plaster cracks, missing chimney bricks, and things of this nature.  The remaining 951 buildings were either found to have suffered no apparent damage, or damage was so slight thgt it could not be readily recognized.
"As of this time, May 24, 1965, the re-survey teams are approximately two-thirds complete with the list of 91 buildings in the serious damage category.<br>
<br>
Within the felt area of the Puget Sound, Washington earthquake of April 29, 1965, there were six strong motion seismographs of the Coast and Geodetic Survey network.<br>
<br>
At the time of the previous major earthquake in the Puget Sound area (April 13, 1949), there were strong motion instruments only at Olympia and Seattle.<br>
<br>
As the Olympia instrument was the same and was in the same location during both earthquakes, the records can be used for comparison of the two shocks at this site.<br>
<br>
Response spectra from the April 29 ree,ords <B>are </B>being prepared, but at this time only rough acceleration, displacement, and period estimates based on preliminary scaling of records are available.<br>

EARTHQUAKE. 1993.<br>
<br>
"Quake cracks Oregon capitol, trembler registers 5.4, causes minor injuries," <B>The Seattle Times.</B> March 25, 1993, p. A-1.<br>
<br>
An earthquake centered in the Cascade foothills east of<br>
Silverton rattled northwest Oregon and parts of Western Washington<br>
early today, cracking the rotunda of the Oregon Capitol in Salem and causing minor injuries.<br>
<br>
The quake, focused about 12 miles deep and about 30 miles southeast<br>
of Portland, registered 5.4 on the Richter scale of ground motion at 5: 34 a.m. and lasted about 45 seconds.<br>
<br>
"It felt like I was on a boat going down rapids. It woke me right<br>
up," said Bill Holder, a cook at Rod's Lafayette Restaurant in<br>
Lafayette, near the epicenter.<br>
<br>
The original wing of the state Capitol in Salem was closed after<br>
serious cracks were found in the rotunda, House Speaker Larry Campbell said. A newer wing remained open. Engineers were considering removing the gold-plated pioneer statue on top of the Capitol.<br>
<br>
Two people came to the emergency room at Salem Hospital with minor<br>
cuts from falling glass.<br>
<br>
In Molalla, 27 miles southeast of Portland, two walls at the high<br>
school partially collapsed. Bricks and a chimney fell from the school, which was built in 1925.<br>
<br>
Brick planters and windows also were broken at some homes and<br>
businesses in the town of 3,800, and goods were knocked off grocery<br>
store shelves.<br>
<br>
Jose Alberto Nunez of Molalla said the quake cracked the walls and<br>
chimney of his house.<br>
<br>
"The kitchen cupboards blew open and glasses and dishes flew onto<br>
the kitchen floor. Pictures fell off the wall. It just kept rumbling and rumbling," he said.<br>
<br>
No damage was reported in Portland, but residents said the quake<br>
knocked books off shelves, left pictures askew on walls and set off car alarms.<br>
<br>
The Oregon Department of Transportation closed about a half-dozen<br>
bridges to check for structural damage but reopened most of them when none was found. The only bridge that remained closed at
<br>
midmorning was on Oregon Highway 18 in Dayton, near the Yamhill River. The bridge shifted off its supports.<br>
<br>
The epicenter was about 15 miles south-southeast of Oregon City.<br>
<br>
Reports of the quake extended to Roseburg, Ore., 165 miles to the south, west to Lincoln City on the Oregon coast, 145 miles north to Seattle and east 120 miles to Bend, Ore.<br>
<br>
Aftershocks were occurring every few minutes, but most were very<br>
small, said Chris Jonientz-Trisler, a seismologist for the Federal<br>
Emergency Management Agency in Bothell. She said one aftershock about 6:20 a.m. measured 3.2 on the Richter scale.<br>
<br>
An earthquake's magnitude is most commonly measured on the<br>
logarithmic Richter scale. An increase of one unit of magnitude<br>
represents a tenfold increase in ground motion. Quakes of magnitude 5 are considered by scientists to be moderate.<br>
<br>
The seismology laboratory at the Geophysics Program of the<br>
University of Washington in Seattle said this morning's 5.4 reading was preliminary and that it could end up being higher.<br>
<br>
Today's quake was comparable in magnitude with the larger of<br>
previous earthquakes in the area. In 1877, Portland was hit by a quake estimated in modern times to have been magnitude 5.3.<br>
<br>
In 1962, Portland was shaken by a 5.5-magnitude quake, and in 1981<br>
there was a 5.5 quake in the South Cascades of Washington.<br>
<br>
Geophysicists say the region is vulnerable to far more powerful<br>
quakes - perhaps even so-called great quakes of magnitude 8 or larger.<br>
<br>
The biggest earthquake since immigrants settled the Northwest was in 1872 and was later estimated to be magnitude 7.3.<br>
<br>
It was centered somewhere in the North Cascades.<br>
<br>
The most famous Puget Sound quakes came in 1949 and 1965. In 1949,<br>
a magnitude 7.1 earthquake, with an epicenter near Olympia, shook the region for 30 seconds and caused damage throughout the Puget Sound region and Southwestern Washington. Particularly hard-hit were brick and masonry buildings in areas of fill, such as Seattle's historic Pioneer Square district. Eight people were killed.<br>
<br>
In 1965, a similar quake of magnitude 6.5 occurred between Seattle<br>
and Tacoma, killing six people in a similar spread of damage. In fact, some buildings failed in 1965 because of weaknesses from the
<br>
1949 quake.<br>

EARTHQUAKE.1995.<br>
<br>

<br>
The strongest earthquake to hit the Puget Sound region in 30 years sent people scurrying for their telephones and porches Saturday. [January 28, 1995].<br>
<br>
The 5.0 quake, centered just off Maury Island, wasn't strong enough to cause major damage or injuries. But it was powerful enough to scare.<br>
<br>
"It started shaking the whole trailer," said Scott Shabaz, who lives near Federal way. "I have a rude friend that comes by once ina while and likes to do that with his truck. It lasted 30 or 40 seconds.<br>
<br>
Everyone had stories about the earthquake and they all got on the phone to share them. U.S. West spokesman Harry Grandstrom said the flurry of calls overloaded the network and disrupted service throughout the region.<br>
<br>
A dispatch supervisor estimated that 300 people called 911 in Pierce County in the half hour after the quake hit at 7:11 p.m.  The University of Washington Geophysics Program Seismology Lab reported it was the strongest tremor in the Puget Sound basin since the 1965 Seattle-Tacoma quake that measured 6.5 on the Richter scale, killing seven people and doing $12.5 million in damage.<br>
<br>
Western Washington's largest recorded quake 7.1 hit Olympia in 1949....The quake was felt as far north as the Canadian border as far south as Salem, Oregon, and as far east as Yakima.<br>
<br>
Seismologists said the epicenter was nearly the same as the killer 1965 quake. Preliminary estimates put Saturday's quake at ten miles below the earth's surface, a depth considred shallow for this region.<br>
<br>
"I suspect we'll get a few more 'felts' later," said Bruce Presgrave, a physicists with the USGS National Earthquake Information Center in Golden Colorado....<br>
<br>
The quake caused minor damage at two aging Tacoma fire stations, prompting fire officials to park fire trucks outside throughout the city.<br>
<br>
New cracks zigzagged along the walls of the 1909 brick fire house
at South 43rd and L Streets. The largest extended from a window through the exterior wall and split the foundation to ground level.<br>
<br>
Dozens of hairline cracks appeared in the walls at another south end station at South 73rd and Park Avenue.<br>
<br>
A 911 dispatch supervisor in Pierce County said there were two reports of people needing help. One woman fainted, the supervisor said and antoher woman in Northeast Tacoma reported her walls heated up after the quake. A Tacoma Fire Department dispatches said the hot walls were caused by an overloaded electrical circuit, but he couldn't confirm the quake caused the problem.....<br>
