Early on Monday 18th April, a vandal exploiting a not-unknown security hole
started disrupting services and corrupting files at Stirling University in the
UK. Stirling University is a SuperJanet site, with a microwave link to
Edinburgh. The entire site was affected. I was working intensively with a
colleague in Stirling at the time. My experience was that the site was
unreachable by Internet services for over 24 hours, and that telnet and ftp
services were seriously degraded for 3-5 days. Email service was unavailable
for 2-3 days. It would be conservative to estimate that at least 6
person-weeks of expert time were required to discover and repair the damage. I
cannot assess the amount of disruption, not only in terms of work time lost
but in terms of reorganising one's planned work time, to users of the systems.
It must be considerable, if my experience is any guide.

Someone believed to be the vandal, and a member of the University, was
identified I believe on Tuesday 19th. I understand he is no longer on
University premises, and the University authorities are considering what
further action is required. Because of possible legal proceedings, I'll
identify my sources of information and exactly what they said in an Appendix.

In a separate submission, I'll offer a few comments of my own on this
incident.  I had been a member of the Stirling Department of Computer Science
and Mathematics for 18 months up until April 94. Knowing that it was an
`inside job', I queried a colleague as to whether more than one member of the
department knew the suspect. The answer was yes.  &gt;From this information
alone, I was able to identify my own suspect X, and ask whether X was any
longer around, or whether anyone expected to see him back. The answer confirms
to me with high probability that X is the suspect. (I note that nothing has
been proved concerning X.)

If X did it, the process by which he came to it would be interesting, both for
psychologists and for those who wish to secure their systems against
corruption. [I'll drop the conditional and use the indicative, for stylistic
not semantic reasons. Readers should reinsert it, since nothing has been
proven against X.]  And it provides a cautionary tale that shows how
vulnerable we all are.  After the fact, I can guess who X is with a bare
minimum of hints.  However, before the act, only X's therapist, if he had one,
is likely to suspect that anything may happen. And of course, in any case if
he had been able to communicate his feelings to anyone sympathetic or
understanding - but otherwise uninvolved - the chances are that the incident
would not have happened. It's a very self-destructive act.  Playing with
computers is an important part of X's life, and indications are that he was
good at it and liked it.  Now, no one but no one is likely to offer him a job
doing it. A major part of his life is in ruins. Despite all else, I can feel
some sympathy for what must be his current plight. It isn't even zero-sum.
Everyone has lost in a big way. [And it must be far, far worse for him if he's
not the culprit!]

Peter Ladkin

Appendix: Sources of Information.

I talked to the Senior Computer Officer of the Department of Computing Science
and Mathematics by phone on Tuesday 19th. He confirmed that the Stirling site
was off the Internet on Monday, that disruption started early Monday morning,
luckily just after Computer Science had made backups of their subnetwork of
systems. He confirmed an estimate of at least 3 person-weeks of the DCSM
staff, and suggested at least an equal number for Computing Services staff, to
identify damage and effect some repair. He said that the disruption was caused
by someone exploiting a not-unknown system weakness, and that a suspect who
was a member of the University had been identified and removed from the site.
He identified the gender of the suspect by his choice of pronoun. He gave no
further information, citing administrative and legal responsibility.

I talked to one member of the Department of Computing Science and Mathematics,
who confirmed that a suspect was known to more than one member of the
Department, and that he (male) was identified through a piece of `luck'.

,In the 5/1/94 Sunday New York Times, the Business section includes one of
those nice experiential articles about new technology, in this case a Ford
with DSP circuitry in it that makes the inside of the car sound like a
cathedral (concert hall, night club, opera house, stadium, etc).  The full
reference is:

  Hans Fantel, A recital hall on wheels, New York Times, 1 May 1994,
  Business section page 7.

Here is a brief quotation:

  "Subjectively it's eerie.  Sitting inside this hologram, I felt bathed
   in music, virtually forgetting where I was.  Engine and traffic noises
   faded from awareness.  The car somehow seemed like a space capsule.
   I was gliding along, swathed in Puccini, while outside the harried
   scenes of Manhattan rolled by like a silent movie."

On the same page is another article about plans by the US government and
Rockwell International for "intelligent vehicle highway systems".

The April 24 edition of the Sacramento Bee (page B5, staff writer) publishes a
story about a miniature camera that will "revolutionize" the Sacramento area
security alarm industry.

Some important points of the article:

A miniature "camera on a chip," about the size of a postage stamp, is attached
to an alarm system.  When the alarm is tripped, the camera sends four pictures
back to the the alarm monitoring service.  Presumably, the pictures are
digitally encoded and sent through some sort of modem.

The first picture arrives twenty seconds after the alarm is tripped.

Police are particularly excited about this because it will let them use the
pictures to detect false alarms.

The system is intended to be used in a wide variety of businesses, and also
residencies.

The photographs will be usable as evidence in court against robbers
and burglars.

The camera is so small that it can be easily hidden anywhere.  It is also
inexpensive -- one third to one half the cost of a closed-circuit video
camera.

"The pictures come out pretty clear," according to a police
communications supervisor.

The device was developed by Automated Security Holdings in England,
licensed to TVX Inc. of Broomfield, Colorado, and test-marketed by
Roseville Telephone (near Sacramento).

.....

The risks?  Many.  Here are a few:

It only takes four pictures, which are presumably freeze-frames.  A burglar
may trip the alarm yet not be photographed (perhaps going by the camera
between pictures).  The alarm agency or police may see that the pictures don't
show anything, and thus believe that it is a false alarm.  They may then
decline to respond or may respond inappropriately.

This is a perfect spy device, and will be easily available at a price less
than a simple video camera.  The potential abuses of such a device are many,
but employee monitoring is one.  Your boss could point one at your work area
to watch you, and you'd never know.  A hidden security camera is really a spy
camera, equivalent to an audio bug.  In fact, the article mentions that it
could be used against internal thefts.

If someone says the pictures are "pretty" clear, that means that they aren't
entirely clear.  If police trust pictures too much, the potential is there for
police to misidentify a suspect (based on a picture), but firmly believe that
they are right.  This is especially likely if the pictures are monochrome.  As
the first picture arrives in twenty seconds, they are certainly low resolution
(consider connection time for the modems).

A camera in my residence?  What if it starts sending pictures back to the
alarm company at random?  What if some voyeur at the alarm company figures out
how to get pictures whenever he wants?  Most people who have these alarm
systems will not know how they work, so they won't be aware of these risks.

A remote digital camera would be useful in some situations.  For instance, it
could send pictures of a bank robber holding a gun, so that the police could
more easily identify a suspect.  The main risk here is (again) too much trust
in the technology.  Also, there's not a great need to hide a security camera.
You generally want potential crooks to know they're being monitored.

The Saturday, 30 April 1994 issue of the _Rocky Mountain News_ (and probably
every other paper within 500 miles) had a massive front page story on the
utter failure of the luggage system during tests at Pena International.  (IMHO
these design failures have reached the point where the current Secretary of
Transportation needs to answer some questions.)

Apparently, Mayor Webb is considering an *indefinite* delay, at the request of
the hub airlines United and Continental.

Of interest to comp.risks readers are the following paragraphs from the
article:

  Webb, who has regretted setting -- and missing -- other airport deadlines
  during his three years in office, said other one isn't a good idea.

  Although deadlines motivate some people, they don't work well
  for computer programmers who must fix what is wrong at DIA, he said.

Strictly speaking, this is probably true.  The incredible design flaws (e.g.,
designing the airport to use an untested luggage transportation system with
*no* fallback capability) and construction snafus (e.g., the "messy" power
system despite contractual agreements to provide a "clean" power feed, leading
to significant delays while BAE scrambled to find power filtering equipment)
leave software as the only practical way of getting out of this mess.

And very few experienced programmers would tolerate the same people who have
screwed up things to this extent trying to impose an unrealistic deadline on
them now...

... but Joan Q Public will undoubtably read this as yet another example of
computer software screwing up the system.  It's the 90's -- your dog didn't
eat your homework; the software garbled it!

It's almost enough for me to move 30 miles so I can vote against Webb in the
next election. :-)

Reading later articles (there were several pages of DIA coverage today, not
just Mayor Webb's flamebait), it appears the scapegoat du jour for the DIA
delay is the "buggy software" that reads the bar codes in the luggage and
determines where to send the cart.

A fascinating (for the wrong reasons) newspaper article included
such interesting factoids as:

  Software -- essentially the brains of a computer system -- is
  so complex that a misplaced comma or an omitted semicolon can
  crash entire computer systems.

  Even the smallest error can cause a ripple effect that turns
  into a tidal wave of the kind that swamped AT&amp;T's main switching
  system several years ago and shut down nearly 90% of the phone
  company's domestic long-distance operations for hours.

Strange how us computer types have never figured out how to check
for syntax errors like this.  (Compilers can't catch all such
errors, but that's why we set up human checks like coding standards
and code walkthroughs.)

  The BAE system employs laser scanners that read bar-coded labels
  placed on baggage.  Experts say that means the BAE computer system
  probably employs real-time, numerical-control software.

Hmm... doesn't "numerical control" refer to machining equipment?

   At Louisville-based Storage Technology Corp., such software is
   a key feature of the company's robotic tape library storage
   systems.

   "What they are probably seeing, and I saw it many times, is that
   you fix one problem and you're just peeling back a layer of the
   onion," said Mark Hopkins, an engineering manager for StorageTek.

Which explains why Iceberg has been such a successful product.

Strangely absent from the article is the reason Denver (or BAE)
decided to build a system which reads tags on luggage (which can
be oriented in an arbitrary direction) instead of reading permanent
tags on the cart itself.  The latter case would require keeping track
of what luggage is in which cart, but eliminates all of the headaches
of reading the tags on the luggage itself.  (Hmm, the wording of
a newspaper graphic implies that a copy of the luggage tag may
be placed on the cart as well, but its alignment may not be perfect.)

Even stranger was an item in another article which identified "gaps"
in the tracks as a biggest problem right now (the software being
a bigger long-term problem).  It seems the wheels on the cart are
falling into gaps between sections of track, causing jams or
derailments.  (Failing luggage is a serious construction worker
hazard.)

This is truly bizarre since the luggage system is in a protected environment,
located in underground tunnels.  For the tracks to be damaged by "vibration"
caused by a couple limited tests implies that this infrastructure was
*seriously* underdesigned.

  SACRAMENTO - The California Department of Motor Vehicles has informed a
  flabbergasted legislative committee that it has spent $44.3 million on a
  computer modernization program that will never work.
	...

Note that this amount of money is approximately equal to the $50M per year in
highway funding that the federal government has been withholding from
California because we have not yet instituted the rule that anyone caught in
possession of any amount of any illegal drugs or prescription drugs without a
prescription will have their driver's license suspended for six months.
That's whether you're driving at the time or not.  According to the SJ Mercury
News a week or two ago, the CA state legislature is most unlikely to put off
adoption of this rule any longer, presumably at least in part because of the
effect of recent disasters on highway construction budget requirements.

Even without the DMV debacle the state might have decided to do this, but
perhaps one can hold them partially responsible for the declining quality of
legislation these days.

In Risks 15.79 I asked:
&gt;Perhaps one of your readers can explain how the Midwest edition of *The New
&gt;York Times* today had a photo on the front page with the caption.  "Joseph P.
&gt;Kennedy Jr. being arrested at the White House yesterday", with no further
&gt;explanation or story anywhere in the paper?
 
Several respondents have reported that, in the Metro edition, the explanation 
was found in three paragraphs at the end of the adjacent story about Haitian 
refugees. Apparently these paragraphs were cut by the person who made up the 
continuation page in the Midwest edition, leaving Joe Jr. hanging there
on page 1. (Yes, I checked back and they are not there in my copy).

According to the "Boston Globe", Congressman Kennedy and several other
colleagues (7 or 8?) were arrested for demonstrating in protest of the US
government's policy on Haiti.  The arrests were made by the Park Service
police.  My guess is that the congressmen had every intention of getting
arrested as a way of increasing publicity.

The error was in a correct, but misleading caption.  We usually assume that
when a politician is arrested it is unintentional.

For what it's worth, my wife asked the same question, and she was looking
at the New York Metro/Suburban edition.  While I can't speak with any real
authority about the Midwest (national) edition, I will say that in my
experience the first page doesn't change much; the big difference is in the
metro section: the national editions don't carry the local stories.

The picture with the caption ("Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. being arrested at the
White House yesterday") accompanied the story about the Administration's
policy on Haiti.  While there was no mention of Rep. Kennedy anywhere in
the story, it did state that (quoting from memory) "four members of the
House of Representatives were arrested during a protest at the White
House."  To my eye, this is sloppy copy editing, not a bona fide technology
blunder....  The technology does seem to encourage such sloppiness, though,
a fact to which our moderator (and the RISKS archives) will bear witness.

Sorry - I was mistaken when I claimed that LaMacchia was arrested.  The
correction noted by Tim Shepard and Douglas Rand in <A HREF="/Risks/15.79.html">RISKS-15.79</A> was
accurate.

As to the issue of his intent to pirate software, that was not the charge
against him.  It was wire fraud! I have read the copy of the indictment and
commentary and I find this awfully strange.  Furthermore, I find little if any
substantive evidence of intent to pirate software in my reading of the quotes
from the indictment.  If you assume he is innocent and ask yourself if these
comments could have been innocently made by a person of that age in that
environment, you may find that the assertion of guilt is not warranted.

Those of us who have been around the computer world for any length of time have
seen a great many "How to Buy a PC" seminars, articles and user group meeting
talks.  They generally offer a lot of helpful advice and useful information for
the novice.  I have, however, often noted personal bias being delivered with
the same force and weight as known and tested fact.  The neophyte generally
comes away with a much better knowledge of the computer market--but also with a
number of unsubstantiated prejudices.
 
Here, then, is a book on the same topic.  Containing far more material than any
one-hour talk or magazine article, it nevertheless has some of the same tone. 
Those wise in the ways of computer purchasing will many times breathe an
"Amen!" to much of what is here.  There are also, however, personal biases and
blind spots that the newcomer will have difficulty recognising.
 
Chapter one is a general diatribe against the industry as a whole.  As
vitriolic as it may sound to the newcomer, the authors may, in fact, be
*under*stating the case.  Chapter two states that software is central to the
whole process, and gives tips for evaluating the major applications.  The
remaining eight chapters are devoted to hardware.
 
There are some easily identifiable oddities.  The statement that Windows'
management of resources makes things easier obviously comes from someone who
has never had to check the five completely different print menus under Windows
to find out why nothing is coming off the printer.  Some items seem to be
subject to time lag, as with the insistence that 386 and 486 CPUs are maker-
independent.  (This might have been true earlier, but the 486 market is now an
utter shambles.)  The authors still cling to their claim that all surge
protectors are created equal.  I found the section on virus protection to be
fairly reasonable--except that they still get the Stoned message wrong, think
all scanners are equally effective, and don't know about shareware scanners. 
In fact, shareware doesn't get much of a shake in spite of the railing against
overpricing and software bloat.
 
In addition, some of the recommendations for protection may give a false sense
of security.  The authors frequently repeat the refrain that one should never
by anything with cash or cheque: put it on a credit card so that you will have
some fallback.  The use of a credit card, however, does *not* necessarily
protect you.  Once you sign the charge slip, you are committed to honour that
debt.  The credit card company *may* choose to reverse the charge and not pay
the merchant, but that is at *their* discretion, and they are not automatically
on your side.  (The credit card company may take several months even to decide
whether or not to reverse the charge: the representatives I talked to, at the
credit card service office, the local bank, the head office complaint
department and the head office PR office refused to give any upper bound or
time limit for a decision.  The PR department initially stated that paying by
card was the same as paying by cash, but refused to answer when asked to
comment specifically about the case of defective equipment.)
 
You really are alone out there: I recently checked up on the Better Business
Bureau, and found that while the technology the BBB is using for phone access
to reports is impressive, the reports themselves are less so.  A company which
has had several disputes in the past, and has a current dispute outstanding, is
listed as being in "satisfactory" standing, and the BBB had "received no
complaints" during its existence.  The BBB also had a chance to respond to this
and indicated that it was because of their "standard reporting language"
imposed from head office.  (BBB is a franchise.)  Complaints are not entered
into the automated system until proven, beyond doubt, to be "valid": the
consumer is not allowed an opportunity to respond to the final offer from the
merchant.  Decisions on validity are made by the BBB.  The BBB is paid by the
vendor.  The conclusion is left as an exercise to the reader.  (The General
Manager of the local BBB stated that more detailed information is available
from the counselors, although this is not made at all clear from the automated
system.  I checked this out later, and it turns out not to be the case.  She
also stated that most people deal with the counsellors rather than the
automated system, which doesn't surprise me in the least.)
 
In the absence of any better, though, this book is to be recommended for
beginners *before* they buy a computer.  One of the particularly nice features
is a sample advertisement introducing every chapter and dissected for "lies". 
Get some street smarts before you go buy a PC.  And never buy anything on the
spot.

The April 4, 1994 issue of the NEW YORKER had a long article by Nicholson
Baker on library automation: "ANNALS OF SCHOLARSHIP: Discards".  It runs from
pages 64 through 87.  My issue also came with a flyer stapled to the cover
with the headline, "THE TRASHING OF AMERICA'S GREAT LIBRARIES."

Baker reports that when most libraries replace their paper card catalogs with
on-line systems, they simply discard the card catalogs.  Baker argues that the
card catalogs are an irreplaceable resource, and contain much scholarly
content which is not carried over into the new systems.  Baker also argues
that the on-line systems often suffer from poor data quality, and make some
kinds of searches (particularly subject searches) more difficult.

RISKS readers will find much of interest about the difficulties of maintaining
integrity and consistency in very large databases.  Baker reports one instance
where all instances of "Madonna" were replaced with "Mary, Blessed Virgin,
Saint," causing reclassification of recent works by Ms. Ciccone.

Some letters responding to the article appear in the May 2, 1994 NEW YORKER.

&gt;From the Reuter newswire via Executive News Service on CompuServe (GO ENS):

     "BONN, April 30 (Reuter) - The German car manufacturer Volkswagen,
  accused by rival Opel of industrial espionage, on Saturday denied a magazine
  report that incriminating material had been found in the office of an
  employee.
     Der Spiegel magazine said on Saturday prosecutors found a computer disc
  containing plans for a high-tech small car factory in the office of Jaero
  Arthur Wicker, office manager of production head Jose Ignacio Lopez de
  Arriortua."

The article continues with the following key points:

o	Lopez used to work for General motors; he's accused of having stolen
confidential files when he was hired by VW.

o	VW claims the disk has plans submitted to both GM and VW and rejected
by both companies.

o	The situation is under investigation by both German and US authorities.

o	The newest scuttlebutt is that GM has asked German prosecutors to
investigate daughter Begona Lopez, whom they accuse of having stolen a disk
containing information on cost reductions at GM.

  between movie stars.]

&gt;From the Reuter newswire via Executive News Service on CompuServe (GO ENS):

  "KINSHASA, April 30 (Reuter) - Zaire's main cellular telephone company, at
  loggerheads with a rival firm trying to muscle in on its territory, said on
  Saturday its signals were being deliberately jammed. 
     Jim Galan, head of coordination at Telecel, said five or six microwaves
  had been trained on its main antenna for the last four days, drowning out
  many calls made from central Kinshasa."

The article explains that the jamming is making cellular phone use impossible
for Telecel's 4000 Kinshasa users.  It is generally believed that a new
company, Comcell, which is supported by the Zairian government, is using the
frequencies originally assigned to Telecel by that same government.

Legal action is in the works.

SUPREME COURT GRANTS ATTORNEY'S PETITION TO RESIGN PERMANENTLY

       TALLAHASSEE, Oct.13-- The Florida Supreme Court has granted
attorney Laurence A. Canter's petition to resign permanently,
effective November 7, 1988.

       Canter, of 240 North Washington Boulevard, Sarasota, was
charged with numerous violations of the attorney disciplinary rules
including neglect, misrepresentation, misappropriation of client funds
and perjury.

       Several of the complaints against Canter involved his failure
to file the necessary or appropriate documents with the United Stated
Immigration and Naturalization Services in matters of permanent
residency and work visas. In addition, Canter refused to refund
clients' funds and neglected to notify his clients that he has been
suspended from the practice of law as a result of a previous
discipline.

       The Florida Bar further alleges that Canter committed perjury
by filing a false affidavit with the Bar and while testifying under
oath in a deposition. These charges resulted after an audit of Canter's
trust account by the Bar showed that trust funds were held in Canter's
account during the time period when he denied any funds were present.

       Canter was born in 1953 and admitted to The Florida Bar in 1980.

       The resignation without leave to apply is not final until time
expires to file motion for rehearing and if filed, determined. The
filling of a motion for rehearing shall not alter the effective date
of this resignation.

       As an official agency of the Supreme Court of Florida, The
Florida Bar and its Department of Lawyer Regulation are charged with
the administration of a statewide disciplinary system to enforce
Supreme Court rules of professional conduct for all lawyers.

Re: Firewalls and Internet Security - Repelling the Wily Hacker.
Ray Kaplan - May 2, 1994

Buy this book!

Gentle folk,

Here is a risk reducer.  With the wholesale rush to Internet connectivity,
it's about time someone sat down and wrote a good book about how to do this
exercise safely!  And, sure enough, Cheswick and Bellovin have done just that,

Heaping superlatives on something of which you are enamored is always
problematic - the possibility of overstatement looms large.  Accordingly I`ll
cut to the chase.  Buy this book!  I do not get any money for saying this - I
just believe you are well justified in getting it on your reading list -
today. In May of this year, Addison Wesley is releasing an excellent new book
by Bill Cheswick and Steve Bellovin: Firewalls and Internet Security -
Repelling the Wily Hacker.  ISBN 0-201-63357-4.  It will retail for $26.95. 
Bulk purchases: 800- 238-9682, individual orders: 800-824-7799 (FAX
617-944-7273).  Email orders over the Internet from <A HREF="mailto:bexpress@aw.com">bexpress@aw.com</A> (no they
don`t take plastic via Email). For those that are net-challenged, U.S.
snailmail orders from Addison-Wesley, c/o Arlene Morgan, 1 Jacob Way, Reading,
MA  01867 USA. 

Rumors loom large that at least one of the authors (Ches?) will be at Interop
with copious quantities of this work of art.  As dues of superlative
authorship that is destined to be popular, I hope they both get writer`s cramp
autographing! 

Details 

While worthwhile, well written, pace-setting, technically astute works of art
are rare - this is certainly one of them.  I am always hard pressed to
identify any one thing as unique in its decade (especially when the decade is
still in progress). Suffice it to say that this work is the most complete
treatment of firewall technology and experience that is available.  The
availability of this work is exciting news for security firewall builders -
including Internet security firewall builders - and, for the great number of
people that seem to be befuddled by the complexity and the general issues of
interconnecting networks. 

The book 

While my review copy (well dog-eared, now) is a bit dated (March 7, 1994), I
think you can expect that it is close to the book`s final form: a standard
(w=7.5in, h=9in) Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series book like the
ones that should already dot your shelves.  (I don`t get any money for my
obvious favorable bias toward this series.  My bias is born out of the fact
that the series (Brian Kernighan is the consulting editor for it) contains
great authors and titles like Radia Pealman`s Interconnections - Bridges and
Routers and Richard Sevens` TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume I - The Protocols.) 

305 pages in 14 chapters, appendices, a bibliography, a list of "bombs"
(security holes) and an index. 

Out of the box, the authors set the tone for their work by quoting F.T. Gramp
and R.H. Morris: "It is easy to run a secure computer system.  You merely
have to disconnect all dial-up connections and permit only direct-wired
terminals, put the machine and the terminals in a shielded room, and post a
guard at the door."  This is followed by a detailed discussion of the art
and science of building a firewall. There is so much good stuff here, that all
I can do is list the book`s contents - lest I write a tome which distracts you
from picking up a copy of it ASAP.

I have criticisms, complaints and suggestions.  However, considering that this
is such a darn fine piece of work - I hasten to get my recommendation that you
buy this book out ASAP. 

Meantime, to whet your appetite: 

- Index - (a well done, 26 pages worth - you can actually find pointers to
what you want to know!  What a concept. 

- TCP ports discussion - a Comprehensive list and reasonable advice on what to
do with them. 

- Bombs - a summarized list of the 43 major security holes that they identify.

- Bibliography - Ahhhh.  19 pages of the best firewalls-related bibliography
that I`ve seen. 

- Where to from here - excellent advice for techies and managers who don`t
want to keep working at the job of firewalling or who simply want to spend a
bit of resources on it only once. 

Kudos to the authors - buy this book. 

Of course - these are my own views, and they don`t necessarily reflect those
of anyone - including my employer.  However, in this case, they probably do.

stated policy: it was permissible to drink alcohol, as having a beer
with lunch, but ONLY if one did not plan to return to work that day.
It was stated further that we were obligated to give the customer our
best work, and alcohol was not consistent with that effort.

I understand that British Rail have a policy that no personnel who can affect
the safety of others is allowed to have alcohol in their bloodstream during
working hours - the penalty for violating this rule is, I think, dismissal.
This grouping includes engineering staff involved in the R&amp;D of systems such
as signaling.

This is more than just "drunk in charge of a computer", this is, sensibly IMHO,
"being under the influence of alcohol while capable of influencing the safety
of others". I hope that the next time I fly in a fly-by-wire aircraft or drive
my systems heavy car I can have confidence that the developers of the systems
that could affect my safety applied a similar abstemious regime.

Driving requires quick response time; electric work requires manual
dexterity.  Alcohol impairs both these things, and as noted, the dangers
are obvious, immediate, and tragic.

Software engineering requires very little in the way of fast responses
or manual dexterity, unless one considers an inordinate number of typos
a serious RISK.

Moreover, the skills which *are* required to write software tend to be
more of the problem-solving variety.  I don't dispute that alcohol dulls
these; however, when you take away one's problem solving skills, the
result is that the problem doesn't get solved.

I seem to vaguely recall an old study in which a group of people, some
of which had been given a couple of drinks, were called upon to solve
arithmetic problems of moderate difficulty, with no time limit.  I
believe the outcome was that those who had had the drinks took much
longer to finish the problems, but their responses were *more* accurate
than the teetotalers, presumably due to their awareness that they were
prone to make errors.

(I would therefore advise project managers to take Friday pub lunches
into account when setting deadlines.)

Incidentally, I'm not sure how one would distinguish between mistakes due to
being under-the-influence and those due to being under stress (perhaps due to
looming deadlines), or simple inexperience or incompetence, or even
honest-to-God oversights.  if the QA system for critical systems doesn't catch
all such types of mistake, there's already a serious problem.  Obviously this
is not intended as an argument against reducing the number of errors to be
found by QA, but still... a bug is a bug.

(I'm reminded of a phrase a colleague used to repeat: "Sure, alcohol
kills brain cells.  But only the weak ones.")

What is the risk here?  People like to put blame one other systems all the
time.  I see this as only a matter of misconfiguration and miscommunication
among the different system admins.  What do the DEC stations need to run tftp
for?  Shouldn't they be logging in to a non-critical partition?  Shouldn't the
Suns have a similar tcpwrapper installed?  Maybe they should all log to some
central machine, with syslog maybe.  The could be several machines that can
serve a diskless station.  The broadcast allows them to find the right one on
the local network and come on up.  I do not think it is at all fair to try to
blame a hardware manufacturer because the equipment worked exactly as
documented, but that happens not to be the way you want it to work.

STAYING INFORMED: Resources for Privacy Seekers &amp; Computer Security Buffs
by David Johnson

(Copyright 1994 under the International &amp; Pan-American Copyright Conventions)

Having conducted various types of security and investigative work that
has taken me to ten Asian countries, I am quite familiar with various
obstacles one must hurdle to obtain hard-to-find and elusive data.

Even though our computers are valuable tools, adopting a multi-faceted
approach to information gathering is the most effective way to cover
all the angles.

We've had plenty of notes about spelling correctors, but I find this one
particularly interesting.  The otherwise excellent April 1994 issue of Z
Magazine contained a particularly horrible editing error in an article by Sara
Diamond about the "American Center for Law and Justice" (ACLJ).  The ACLJ was
created by conservative Christians in order to oppose the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) in court cases over issues like school prayer.
Everyone has assumed that the similarity of acronyms is deliberate; ACLJ seems
part of a fairly systematic conservative strategy of positioning
public-interest groups as "liberal" by creating conservative mirror images of
them.  Well, as the Z editors explained in their May issue, their spelling
correction program included ACLU but not ACLJ, with the result that every
instance of "ACLJ" in Diamond's article got changed to "ACLU" except, somehow,
for the very first one, which occurred (much as it does above) in parentheses
after the first mention of "American Center for Law and Justice".  Apparently
there was an uproar, with some Z readers calling up the ACLU to ask why it had
suddenly reversed its positions.  The risk is subtle: in politics, things are
often designed to outwardly resemble their opposites, or to invite confusion
or sharply defined contrast (or both) with their opposites.  As a result, it
becomes impossible to define "close enough" in (for example) a spelling
corrector without a great deal of specific background knowledge.

Peter Ladkin introduces his post with the polite phrase:

&gt;  a vandal exploiting a not-unknown security hole

or, in American English:

Some lazy person at the target site failed to plug a known hole, probably
reasoning along the lines of "Oh, no one will know about this hole so I
don't have to deal with it."

There is no excuse for vandalism, including failure by sysops to plug known

      [Old news to some of us.  Oddly no one reported it to RISKS until now,
      and I did not get around to entering anything on it.  PGN]      

Excerpts from an article on page 14 of the May 2 issue of Network World:

   A team led led by Bell Communications Research last week announced
   it has cracked a 129-digit encryption code, which scientists had
   predicted would take "40 quadrillion years" to break.  ...

   Breaking the RSA-129 public key required that the team find the two
   prime numbers that, when multiplied by each other, resulted in the
   129-digit key number.  ...

   This mathematically arduous task was accomplished in eight months by
   600 volunteers in 24 countries who used their organizations' spare
   computing capacity.  ...

In a TV report (magazine FRONTAL, 2nd German TV channel ZDF, Tuesday May 3,
1994), recent motorsport accidents (3rd World Championship, formula 1 racing
cars, Imola/San Marino) were discussed and analysed by experts (e.g. former
World champion Niki Lauda/Austria). Besides general questions about
deficiencies in safety and protective measures, the question was discussed
whether the recent decision to forbid the computerized ground distance control
may have contributed to the strange behaviour of both racing cars which after
a curve went straight into a concrete wall, without visible signs of steering.
In both cases (Austrian driver Hackenberger, in training for his 2nd race, and
Brasilian driver Ayrton Senna, 3-times world champion), the cars crashed at
almost 300 kilometers per hour, with both drivers dying upon impact.

Until end-of-1993, formula 1 racing cars were equipped with a computerized
control system aimed at maintaining a fixed but very small distance between
the car's bottom and the track's surface, to allow for maximum contact and
therefore maximum transfer of power on the wheels. Following arguments that a
defect in the computer system may lead to serious crashes, the international
authority for this sport forbidded this computer system from 1994. This
decision may now have caused the problem on the very high speed track of
Imola, where the cars reach maximum velocities over 300 km/h. According to the
discussion quoted, the hydraulic steering support may be affected when the
car's bottom contacts, at high speed, an uneven part of the track; in such a
situation, the driver would no longer be able to steer the car and may even
loose the ability to brake. Evidently, the decision to forbid the computer
system was neither accompanied by an adequate risk analysis not were any
additional measures taken to diminish the risks e.g. by reducing the car's
speed or by enlarging the minimum distance between car's bottom and track
ground. Only now, discussions take place to reduce the speed in certain parts
of the track.

This morning (3 May 1994), Transportation Secretary Federico Pena appeared on
at least one morning TV show in addition the _MacNeil-Lehrer_ show to inform
the public about the shocking state of the nation's air-traffic control
technology.  On both appearances that I saw, Pena said that the FAA needed to
be a private corporation so it could acquire technology more quickly, outside
of federal regulations.

He used as an example the humble vacuum tube.  He said that the FAA is the
world's largest buyer of vacuum tubes.  That I can believe.  But then by way
of comparison, he held up a vacuum tube and a computer chip.  The tube was a
big one, about the size of a #30, which is much bigger than the tubes used on
any tube computer like ENIAC, whose tubes were about the size of a 5U4.  He
compared it against a computer chip (something packaged like an Intel 486),
and claimed the latter could replace 3.5 million vacuum tubes!

Apparently, Secretary Pena either: a) believes the FAA is running enormous,
obsolete vacuum tube computers containing millions of tubes, or b) doesn't
mind telling bald-faced lies to the American public to get support for his
objectives.  I'm not sure which is worse.

As someone who has been involved in fixing a number of terrible situations 
involving computers, and as someone who has not been involved in the DIA 
fiasco, other than as a fascinated observer, I'm sure that when the book is 
written on this, we'll find that there is ample blame for all of the parties 
involved in the project.  Small groups of people make small messes.  To get a 
really large mess, you need a large group of people working for many 
organizations.  Anyone, or any reporter, claiming to know the source of the 
problems as this stage, is either quite naive or has an axe to grind.

I think Bear Giles misses the point (in RISKS 16.01) about simple software 
errors leading to massive, unintended consequences.  The issue is not (just) 
syntax checkers. Sure, we've got 'em...So what?  The issue is that in a 
mechanical or analog system a small error in the input or operation 
generally leads to a small **and traceable** error in the output.  But in a 
digital system, especially a software-based digital system that can experience 
memory or data corruption, a small error in the input or operation can have 
huge **and virtually untraceable** errors in the output.  I seem to recall 
that it was indeed a small error that brought down the AT&amp;T long-distance 
switching system. I have to agree with the writer on this one.

Finally, judging by the number of bar-coded labels that I have to rip off my 
luggage, many airports must use bar-code readers. I have to believe that this 
piece of airport technology is reasonably mature.  Finally, common sense says 
it has got to be more reliable to bar-code the luggage than the carts.

Subject: Followup on credit card policies (re: "Streetwise Guide ...")

PGN asked me to summarise the responses to my comments in the review of "The
Streetwise Guide to PCs" by Jerome/Taylor.  I had suspected that it might be a
bit controversial, but I was surprised that the only substantive comments I
received were in regard to the difference between Canadian and American law
regarding credit card purchases.  The most apposite information was from Bear
Giles &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bear@tigger.cs.Colorado.EDU">bear@tigger.cs.Colorado.EDU</A>&gt; who wrote:
 
========
 
I don't remember the exact language, but in the U.S. consumers have the
right to refuse charges made more than 50(?) miles from their home address.
The refusal must be in writing, within 30 days, possibly with an explanation,
etc.  The bank must complete its actions within 60 days of receipt of this
letter, cannot charge interest or late fees on the disputed amount, etc.
(I would imagine the exact details are in the FAQ of various consumer
advocacy groups.)
 
The presumption is that the purchase was made over the phone or while on
a trip, either situation making it difficult to impossible for the consumer
to evaluate the quality of the merchandise prior to purchase.
 
There is no corresponding law applying to purchases "near home"; this
distinction is often lost on people.  And of course the existence of
an American law has no significance to a Canadian making a domestic
purchase.
 
BTW, another restriction (either U.S. law or merchant agreement) which
is often overlooked is a requirement that charges not be placed against
your account until the merchanise is actually shipped.  I believe
companies can still "reserve" credit, but the only effect the customer
sees from this is a reduced available credit -- she does not have to
make payments against it.
 
==========
 
Much the same was said by Andrew Klossner &lt;<A HREF="mailto:andrew@frip.wv.tek.com">andrew@frip.wv.tek.com</A>&gt; who added:
 
==========
 
Holders of U.S. credit cards can find these procedures detailed on the
back of each monthly account statement.
 
==========
 
So check the back of your statements for further details.
 
(As I said, I suspected there would be some controversy: I expected it,
however, to be in regard to my statements about the Better Business Bureau.  I
guess that most people have such low expectations on that score that they
simply couldn't be bothered to comment  :-)

On 02 May 1994, ABC News _Nightline_ aired a program entitled, "Law and Order
on the Information Superhighway_, which focused on the case of David
LaMacchia, an MIT student accused of wire fraud for allegedly having run a BBS
which permitted traffic in stolen software.

The host was Chris Wallace, substituting for Ted Koppel.

I ordered a transcript of the program from Journal Graphics, Inc. / 1535 Grant
Street / Denver, CO 80203 / phone 303-831-9000 / fax 303-831-8901.

The transcript is copyright (c) 1994 American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. and
therefore I can provide only an abstract.  

   [I received the entire abstract from Mich, who also provided me with an
   annotated version, which is included here.  My apologies if I omitted
   anything necessary for understanding.  However, because Mich included
   chunks of the abstract before each of his annotations, I could not run
   both the full abstract and the annotated version.  PGN]

U.S. Attorney Donald Stern accuses David LaMacchia of having tolerated the
exchange of stolen software worth more than $1 million.  Prof. Laurence Tribe
of Harvard University Law School questions the implications of such an
accusation; he argues that LaMacchia's BBS should be accorded the legal status
of a common carrier, thus exculpating the owner of crimes committed through
his communications channel.

Analysis of the Nightline program about David LaMacchia and the software 
exchange BBS:

[set flame = on]

&lt;&lt;LaMacchia's attorney, Harvey Silverglate, argues that providing a venue for
the commission of a crime is not a crime: "The question is whether someone who
activates the system should be liable for what anyone else does, or do you
look to punish the person who actually commits the wrong, who actually copies,
steals the software?"&gt;&gt;

Silverglate's legalistic attitude is understandable (he _is_ a lawyer, after
all) but fails to address the question of values.  Many BBS operators exercise
control over content of communications or files on their systems--not out of
fear of legal prosecution, but because they don't want to be tacit or active
supporters of bad things.  As Sysop in the NCSA's security forum on
CompuServe, I have removed abusive messages and written to their authors with
reminders of the standards of decorum my fellow Sysops and I expect on the
forum.  Free speech doesn't enter into it: CompuServe is a privately owned
network and Sysops have a responsibility to maintain an environment in which
participants address the issues without descending to abusive, ad hominem
attacks.  We do these things because they fit our _values_.  We do not assume
that if something is not illegal it must be right.

....

&lt;&lt;Silverglate claimed that Congress does not want to penalize BBS operators for
criminal acts carried out with their systems, "... because nobody would then
operate these systems, and the communications highway, the information highway
would grind to a halt."&gt;&gt;

These predictions are wrong.  Many people, including the Sysops on CompuServe
and many moderators in Internet news groups, regularly impose restrictions on
content on moral grounds and out of respect for possible legal entanglements.
For example, although I regularly post extracts of the RISKS FORUM DIGEST on
the NCSA Forum, I don't post what appear to be entire copyrighted articles.

....

&lt;&lt;Corley replied, "...On the Internet there are no tangibles.  You can ...
steal something and they no longer have it, or you can go on the computer
system or computer network and copy something, but it's a copy.  It's not the
same as stealing.  I think that's the first thing we have to get over.  We
can't use the same analogies that exist in the real world, because this is no
longer the real world."&gt;&gt;

Corley exemplifies an attitude prevalent among criminal hackers:
dehumanization of cyberspace.  It seems to them that there are no people on
the other end of the communications channel, only things.  Stealing software
in this context seems victimless; in reality, companies are losing money, and
people are suffering monetary losses.  Some small companies can go out of
business entirely if they cannot get sufficient revenue to cover the months of
grinding, often poorly-paid work by their employees.  Human beings have
smaller salaries or even lose their jobs because of software theft.
Cyberspace is as much a part of the real world as speech, books, and
telephones.  No one would argue that stealing a book is a victimless crime--or
would they?  Some unscrupulous bookstores rip the covers off books, return the
covers to the publisher for a credit, and then sell the mutilated books--with
not a penny going to the _people_ who wrote, edited, printed, bound, and
marketed the book.

....

&lt;&lt;Wallace protested, "... what's the difference between copying a program which
I'm then going to appropriate and use, and stealing?"

Corley continued, "It's not stealing, because you're not depriving somebody of
it....  we're presuming that people are not selling this material.  This is
something that someone is simply copying to either examine, to analyze, what
have you.  There's different reasons why somebody would legitimately copy
something."&gt;&gt;

Criminal hackers and software thieves miss the key point about intellectual
property or confidential information.  It isn't the copying that causes harm,
it's the owner's loss of control over a valuable resource.  Software companies
sell a license to use a product, not the product itself.  Software thieves steal
the ability to enter into a contract with a user; it is the lost revenue that is
in question, not the extra copy itself.

....

&lt;&lt;Jim Settle, retired member of the FBI Computer Crime Squad, argued that it is
the software creator which determines whether software shall be freeware,
shareware, or commercial software.

Corley said, "The problem with that is, though, that somebody can put a
particular value on a piece of software and say, `This costs $10,000,' and then
somebody copies it with a single keystroke and they're charged with stealing
$10,000...."&gt;&gt;

Corley implies that it is illegitimate to apply whatever price the creator
wishes to a product or service.  But a producer normally charges what the market
will bear:  a price which maximizes profit.  Too high for perceived value and
the market chooses alternatives--or they develop by less greedy competitors.
Too low, and the producer risks going out of business.

The other peculiar (wrong) suggestion in this passage is the idea that the
ease with which an act is performed somehow mitigates responsibility.  So a
single-keystroke copy is more of an excuse for stealing software than a
20-character command?  If a vandal demolishes a building by attacking it with
an ice pick over a 5 year period, are we expected to perceive his act as worse
than if he had blown it up by pressing a button to explode a nuclear bomb?
Once again, Corley confuses technology with morality.

....

&lt;&lt;In a discussion on the extent of copyright violation, Corley explained his
view of why programs get copied: "... computer programs are designed to be
copied, so naturally people are going to copy them.  If we don't want people
to copy them, then we make them so that they are uncopyable, or so that people
want the original."&gt;&gt;

Ah, the familiar fallacy of moral possibility.  This error consists of
believing that if something is easy it must be right.  The corollary is that
the victim is to blame for being victimized.  Thus if a bank robber uses a
howitzer to blow a hole in the wall of a bank, it serves the bank properly for
having failed to encase its building in three-foot thick titanium beryllium
alloy.  So software manufacturers should impose the endless nuisances of copy
protection on their products--even though these methods increase costs, enrage
consumers, and don't work anyway because little creeps find ways of countering
every single programmatic technique invented to date.

Just because it's _possible_ to steal doesn't make it right.

&lt;&lt;Corley explained that many people tape record albums illegally; "from the
band's point of view, though, it's a good thing that their music is being
distributed, you see.  And that's how I think we should look at copywritten
software.  The software is getting out.  I don't think Microsoft is going to
go out of business, and they're probably the company that is copied the
most."&gt;&gt;

Here we have Corley taking up the unpaid position of marketing director for
musicians as well as software companies.  Decisions on how to market a product
or service are rightfully the responsibility of the owners of that product or
service.  Criminal hackers have no moral justification for interfering with
those decisions.

&lt;&lt;Settle reminded Corley that Microsoft doesn't offer DOS for free
distribution.  Corley replied, "Well, they know that there are people that
will pay for it, and there lots of people that will pay for any particular
program, there are companies that will pay the corporate rate."&gt;&gt;

So Corley recognizes that honest people either agree to abide by the software
license agreement _or they don't use the product_.  So what are we supposed to
do about the creeps who jack _our_ price up by stealing the same products?
Corley's attitude reminds me of the idiots who race by traffic jams by using
the emergency lanes; these people are contemptuous of the rest of us, sitting
in orderly lines, waiting to take our turn past the obstruction causing the
holdup.  But no, the scoff-laws, like Corley, feel that they don't have to
abide by such rules.

&lt;&lt;Settle repeated his point: "But they're not saying, `Do you choose to pay or
not pay?'  They saying, `You owe me X number of dollars for this product."

Corley replied, "Right, but that's not very realistic.  There are college
students that want to use computers, and according to organizations like SPA,
they cannot have access if they cannot afford whatever price the software
company says they have to pay, and the same thing for people in other
countries."  He then made an analogy between programs and books, saying that we
encourage literacy with libraries but don't encourage computer literacy.&gt;&gt;

Ah, a new right.  Many criminal hackers espouse the view that they have a
_right_ to use any software they please without paying for it.  The reasoning,
such as it is, seems to be "I wannit--so it's mine."  No one on this planet
has a _right_ to use the database I have designed to track my projects.  I
wrote it, I debugged it, I refined it.  It's mine and mine alone.  If I
_choose_ to let Albert use it and not Bob, that's my choice.  If I _choose_ to
sell it only if the buyer agrees not to shoot sparrows, this eccentric term in
the license agreement can be accepted or rejected by a prospective buyer, but
they have _no right_ to use the product without that contractual agreement.
Can't afford MS-Word?  Use another word processor. Don't like the terms of a
license that doesn't let you make a copy for your portable computer?  Buy
another product or do without.  But wanting to use somebody else's tool is not
moral justification for stealing it.

<I>Wed, 4 May 1994 21:56:20 -0400 (EDT)</I><PRE>

The underlying risk of electronic car door locks is that the state of the 
lock depends on what a microprocessor believes rather than whether 
someone has turned a key or pushed a latch button. In addition to the 
obvious failure modes (do you need a working battery to unlock the car?) 
the manufacturer can also program in more complex lock behavior. Drivers 
and passengers may find out the full range of lock states only when 
bitten by a previously unknown "feature".
 
For example, last week I drove a two-door Chevy Cavalier that unlocks both
doors when the ignition is turned off. Makes it harder to lock keys in the
car, but could also pose a risk of theft if you don't notice.  Compared to the
Buick Century I was driving for a few days prior to that (and you'll
understand why shortly), the Cavalier's behavior is positively benign.
 
During a sudden spring blizzard at 2,500 meters in Northwest New Mexico, I
discovered the Buick's quirk. I went onto the shoulder to avoid a pickup and
trailer that had decided to stop in the middle of the road during a brief
zero-visibility whiteout, and found myself stuck in a newly-minted snowbank.
So I turned on the hazard flashers and went to see how hard it would be to dig
out. Since I had left the engine running, the doors locked automatically
behind me (I later verified that this is a "well-known" behavior to the rental
agents in Albuquerque). The risks of standing outside a locked car in driving
snow on a lightly-traveled mountain road (wearing clothing more suitable for
low-altitude desert) should be obvious. Without the timely passage of two
other tourists (bound from a monastery near Abiquiu to a commune at Taos) this
posting might not have been possible.
 
I was somewhat taken aback to note that it took the tow-truck operator less
than a minute to unlock the car, equipped only with a small pry bar and a bent
steel rod. So the electronic locking mechanism does not seem to add security.
 
During the mechanical era, auto manufacturers figured out various way to make
it difficult or impossible to lock your keys in a car; it's not a good sign
that they seem to be relearning those lessons from scratch.

An article in _The_Toronto_Star_ on 5 May 1994 described secret codes which
are necessary to maintain elevators at Metro Hall, the building which houses
Metro Toronto municipal council and services. The elevators, made and
maintained by Schindler Elevator Corp., require secret password codes in order
to maintain them. This means that only Schindler staff can maintain the Metro
Hall lifts, and as such forced Metro Council to award a 10 year contract of
$3.5 million to Schindler. Meanwhile, Metro is also suing the building's
developer, Marathon Realty, to try to get the codes. Without the passwords,
elevator maintenance contracts cannot be given to a competing firm.

Metro Councillor Howard Moscoe wanted the Council to issue a $10 000
reward to the first person to successfully crack Schindler's Code.
This motion probably didn't get approval.

RISKS usually features risks in high technology area, especially with
computers. I am tempted to site one example for risks in a relatively low
technology area encountered in a developing country like ours!

In the '50s or early '60s, there had been a massive drive to eradicate malaria
(a disease cheracterized by high fever and spread through mosquito bites) from
India. The attack was primarily on the mosquitos; their lot were killed by
pesticides and their hideouts destroyed. The operation was considered to be
successful and a case of malaria was rare for about twenty years to come!

Unfortunately, in late '80s, mosquitos came back with renewed a vigour and
brought malaria back. How did the mosquitos come back? Some 'experts' assign
the following reason:

In '60s or '70s, most of the Indian household used hearths (coal-fire) to
prepare the food. At that time, a popular sight at the dusk at an Indian town
was the smoke coming out of every dwelling unit to mark the ignition of the
hearth for preparation of the evening meals. In a city, where the population
density had been high, the volume of smoke was significant and caused concern
about pollution! But, that was the time, when the mosquitos invading the
households (dusk is the peak activity hour for the mosquitos!) were repelled
by the smoke.

In the '80s, the hearths were replaced by 'modern' 'non-polluting' gas stoves.
The coal-lit hearth was even banned in many cities in an attempt to curb
pollution. So, now there is nothing to prevent the mosquitos to come and join
us for dinner and spread malaria in the process!

I am not sure, if the reason cited is a valid one, but the concern about the
re-advent of malaria in India is beyond any doubt!

   [Next time, lease a collection of mutant boll weevils to eat the 
   mosquitos and you will be confronted with a lessor of weevils.  PGN]

Here is some old news that was new to me:

According to the _Dartmouth Life_ newsletter (Feb 1994--I'm just clearing up
my in basket today), an article appeared in _The New York Times_ on 94.01.05
entitled "Confronting changing ethics of the computer age."

The unsigned article begins, "Hanover, N.H. -- Somebody in Prof. David
Becker's course on Latin American politics did not want to take the midterm
exam, so he or she used Dartmouth's innovative electronic mail network to
impersonate a department secretary and cancel the test.
     "At 11 o'clock on the night before the test in the Government 49 class, a
message flashed on students' computer screens.  Because of a family emergency,
the message said, Professor Becker would be unable to administer the midterm."

The article explains that half the class understandably failed to show up for
the test.  No one has been identified yet as the culprit.

The rest of the article talks about the extensive electronic mail system on
campus.  One of the key concerns of the unregulated network is the rapid
spread of rumours: "Late in August computer flashed an account of a woman
being raped while jogging near campus.  The message was intended as a warning,
but there had been no rape."

The Hanover police department were swamped with calls.  The Chief of Police now
has his own electronic mail account to try to squelch rumours.

According to the _Friday Report_ &lt;April 29, 1994&gt;, Gene Del Polito, Exec. Dir.
of the Advertising Mail Marketing Assn. is urging the Postal Service to adopt
an 11 digit ZIP code.  The 11 digits would consist of the original five +
four, and the last two will be the last two numbers of YOUR house address.

&lt;&lt;Developing and using an 11-digit code, called a delivery point ZIP Code, is
a way to 'purge the costs out of the postal system...  and add value to mail
as a communications medium,' said Del Polito.&gt;&gt; Translation? Better targeted
junk mail.

This means that, with only a ZIP code, marketers and harassers will darn near
be able to pick out my house. Marketers do a lot of demographic research based
on ZIP code. This could lead to _extremely_ targeted marketing. Although not
everyone would consider this a risk...

Another concern arises for people who are being stalked or
harassed. Again, with just the ZIP code, the stalker could pin-
point, at the very least, the victim's street. Systems which claim
to protect privacy and confidentiality because it _just_ uses a ZIP
code for identifiers, may have to be redesigned.

&lt;&lt;'The reality we're stuck with is that many people in this country simply
don't know what their accurate and complete address is,' said Del Polito.&gt;&gt; I
am sure a lot of people make mistakes when addressing an envelope. I do not
think the way to solve this problem is to create a system where 11 digits
create a path to my doorway.

In the last RISKS someone writes about the dangers of automatically-locking
doors when standing in a blizzard at 2500 feet wearing light clothing.  The
author posits a somewhat amusing possible outcome, had he not been saved by
travelling communists: a computer scientist frozen to death next to his

&gt;   predicted would take "40 quadrillion years" to break.  ...

&gt;   This mathematically arduous task was accomplished in eight months by
&gt;   600 volunteers in 24 countries who used their organizations' spare
&gt;   computing capacity.  ...

There are two risks, one amusing.  Ron Rivest now regrets ever making that 40
quadrillion years estimate.  It was silly when he made it; his papers in the
scientific literature from that era give estimates which are within an order
of magnitude of how much computation we actually used.  From those estimates,
and the observation that way back then it wasn't feasible to hook together
hundreds of computers, we can deduce that a late 70's supercomputer using the
best algorithms available then would have taken a few decades, maybe a
century.  Certainly much less than the 40 quadrillion years.  The risk is:
making predictions about the runtime of computer programs can sometimes make
you look silly 8-)

The other risk is more serious.  RSA is widely used to protect commercially
significant information.  512-bit keys are widely used for this.  Most, if not
all, smart-card implementations are restricted to 512-bit keys.  RSA-129 has
425 bits.  I estimate (taking a risk 8-) that 512-bit keys are only about 20
times harder to break than 425-bit keys.  Readers are left to draw their own
conclusions.  However, it is not by chance that I have a 1024-bit PGP key.

Oh yes, as Arjen Lenstra had pointed out: if you had used RSA-129 as
the modulus in a digital signature for a 15-year mortgage, you would
have been cutting it pretty fine.  It is the use of RSA for long-lived
signatures which needs to be examined with a very critical eye.

Perhaps because there is no risk beyond the known ones?  Bob Silverman of
MITRE (well known in number factoring circles) has publicly predicted already
some time ago that it would require about 5000 MIPS years to factor the
number.  Reasonably close to the actual figure.

That the team was led by Bell Communications Research is untrue.  It is a team
led by four people from Bellcore (Arjen Lenstra), MIT (Derek Atkins), Iowa
State University (Michael Graff) and Oxford University (Paul Leyland).

I've heard this 40 quadrillion years figure a couple of times now and I
find it odd.  Is that what the Scientific American said?  I have the
original document from MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science.  It's
titled "A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key
Cryptosystems" by Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman, April
1977.  I can't do superscripting with vi so 10 10th means 10 to the
10th power.  It has the following table in it:

Digits        Number of Operations          Time
===================================================
50            1.4 X 10 10th                 3.9 hours
75            9.0 X 10 12th                 104 days
100           2.3 X 10 15th                 73 years
200           1.2 X 10 23rd                 3.8 X 10 9th years
300           1.5 X 10 29th                 4.8 X 10 15th years
500           1.3 X 10 39th                 4.2 X 10 25th years

200 digits was supposed to take 3.8 trillion years and 100 a mere 73.
So where does the 40 quadrillion figure come from?

Subject: Risks of following up on credit card laws (last one)

In response to my initial posting of the "Streetwise Guide" book review, and
subsequent summary of the initial responses, I (and, I presume, PGN as well) am
still receiving mail on the subject.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of
disagreement and a shortage of direct quotes from the relevant statutes.  I
pass along these messages, therefore, since they contain at least references to
the names of specific acts.
 
From: <A HREF="mailto:avm4@crux4.cit.cornell.edu">avm4@crux4.cit.cornell.edu</A>
===========
The quoted material appears to be backwards, judging foom the text on
the back of my credit card statement and also from the misc.credit FAQ:
 
Q504. Exactly which purchases qualify under the Fair Credit Billing Act?
 
    You are protected if all of the following are true:
 
    - The purchase was made with a credit card.  (If it was a debit
      card, the money is already gone from your account and the bank
      won't get involved.)
 
    - The amount charged is more than $50.  (The amount in dispute could
      be less, for example if you bought a $90 lamp but were billed
      $100.  The amount in dispute is $10.)
 
    - You made the purchase somewhere in your home state, or within 100
      miles of your mailing address.  (I am not an attorney, but my
      understanding is that if you are having goods shipped to you by
      mail or phone order, the place of purchase is the address you are
      having them shipped to.)
 
    If some of the above are not true, you are still protected if the
    credit-card company owns or operates the merchant, or the credit-
    card company mailed you the advertisement for what you bought.  In
    that case your purchase is covered by the rules no matter where you
    bought or how much you paid.
 
    In addition, you MAY successfully protest charges outside of these
    parameters, but there is no legal requirement for the credit card
    company to do so.
============
 
From: <A HREF="mailto:cramer@world.std.com">cramer@world.std.com</A> (Bill Cramer)
============
&gt;I don't remember the exact language, but in the U.S. consumers have the
&gt;right to refuse charges made more than 50(?) miles from their home address.
&gt;The refusal must be in writing, within 30 days, possibly with an explanation,
&gt;etc.  The bank must complete its actions within 60 days of receipt of this
&gt;letter, cannot charge interest or late fees on the disputed amount, etc.
 
This statement would seem to be in conflict with 15 USC 1666i(a), which
states, in part, that a card holder can withhold payment only when the
place of the transaction was **within 100 miles**.
============
 
There was also mention of a Consumer Credit Protection Act.
 
This is as far as I go, since 1) I am not a lawyer, 2) I am not an American and
3) I am part of the larger world to which my original comments still basically
hold good.

For the past few months, my baby daughter has had a large rash. My wife took
her to our HMO a few times and the doctor (gatekeeper) finally authorized a
blood test and a visit to a dermatologist once the blood test results were
available.  Last night, we received a form authorizing the visit to the
specialist that contained a clearly labeled diagnosis of Lupis.  We assumed
that this was the result of the blood test and I logged into Prodigy to find
out more about Lupis.  The online encyclopedia had a detailed description and
my daughter appears to have some of the symptoms. Furthermore, the disease is
very serious and can lead to death. We were very worried and I immediately
contacted the HMO. This was about 6:30p and the front office staff couldn't
help us (the doctors were gone) even though their computer generated the form!
(I expressed my displeasure as forcefully as possible without using colorful
language...) I then called the dermatologiest and what he had to say is very
interesting. Apparently, the HMO contacted the dermatologist last week,
described the symptoms, and asked for a list of possible diagnoses. He
provided about half a dozen possibilities and the HMO doctor then picked the
worst possible one so that it would get past the review committee! If he had
put a more likely diagnosis, like an allergy or fungus, a specialist visit
probably would not have been authorized. Also, the blood test results are not
in, and based on my daughter's response to some medication, it looks like she
has something simple that will clear up. Of course, she still gets to visit
the dermatologist based on the "diagnosis" on the form.

I'm thankful that the HMO doctor "worked the system" to get the best possible
care for my daughter. However, this form with a diagnosis of a serious disease
has me angry. Do health care providers really think it's okay to mail out
something like that without making a personal contact? Do they tell people
they have AIDS by mail now? Why didn't the front office staff at the HMO have
a clue? Shouldn't doctors be spending their time helping people, not trying to
figure out how to get around the system? And finally, do we really want the
Clinton Administration to mandate this kind of system for all Americans?

White House May Issue National ID Cards

The Clinton administration is working on a national ID card that every
American would need in order to interact with any federal agency, reports
Digital Media: A Seybold Report, a computer industry newsletter based in
Media, Pa.

The so-called U.S. Card would be issued to citizens by the Postal Service.  It
would be issued as a "smart card," with its own internal CPU, or as a plug-in
"PCMCIA" card with megabytes of built-in memory.

Administration approval of the plan "could come at any time," states the
newsletter.

In November 1993, I signed up with a long-distance service reseller in Canada.
I won't give the name because there's no longer any reason to embarrass the
company.  Shortly after registering, I received a friendly welcoming letter
explaining how to use their service.  As expected, there was a special number
to dial; when we got the dial tone, we'd punch in a 3-number PIN and our own
telephone number.  Then we'd get another dial tone and we would dial our
destination number.

In the envelope were printed labels to stick on our phones with all of these
instructions--including the PIN!

I called the company and asked to speak to the chief of security.  When I
finally got to speak to her, she expressed horror at the prospect of having
customer PINs stuck to their phones in plain sight, where any passing
dishonest person could pick up their access codes and call expensive places.
It seems that no one in marketing or customer service had every discussed this
brilliant plan with her or with her staff. She assured me that she would
report the breach of security and effect changes.

Months passed.

In January, I spoke to the chief of security again.  This time, I cheerfully
told her she was running out of time.  I sent her a registered letter warning
her of the dangers to consumers; pointed out that although theoretically the
user of a phone system is responsible for calls, there would be no way to
squirm out of the irresponsibility of having sent out thousands of stickers
showing the PINs of countless users; and that even if the company absorbed the
costs of fraud, they'd be unable to prosecute even dishonest users who abused
their own phone codes.  I then added what I think was the clincher: if I
didn't hear back from them within a week I'd publish a report in the RISKS
FORUM DIGEST and in Computing Canada and make them a laughingstock.

I got a call from the VP to whom the security chief reports.  He assured me
that the problem was being solved.  Indeed, a few weeks later, I received new
stickers _without_ a pin.  The system now uses ANI to identify the client.
Attempting to access the trunk from an unauthorized phone immediately causes
an alert at the company switchboard; repeated attempts to abuse the system can
lead to termination of service.  The authorized user is informed of such
attempts.

Moral:  don't just ignore security breaches, fight them!

Although this forum is primarily for giving examples of computer
problems, I'd like to give credit to two companies I recently dealt with
that made an extra effort to reduce the risks in their systems.

My company recently switched to Fidelity for managing it's 401(k) retirement
plans.  Fidelity has a phone number one can call to check balances, transfer
investments between different funds, etc.  When you call for the first time,
you're asked to select and enter a PIN.  To identify yourself, you need the
plan number for your company, your social security number, and your birthdate.
All these are easily obtained by others.  To prevent misuse, the system sent
confirmation by mail to the person's home address that a PIN was set up.
(Allowing a PIN setup by phone worried me when I read their literature, but I
felt this was a good way of minimizing the risk.  Also it should be noted that
one couldn't transfer money from one person to another, only transfer to
different funds.)

A few days ago I stayed at a Mariott Courtyard in Landover, MD.  They have an
express checkout system in which a copy of the bill is printed and slipped
under your door your last night there.  On the bill is printed the credit card
number used for billing.  The copy slipped under the door had the number
overwritten with a heavy black marker.  It's possible that one could determine
the number anyway, but it reduces the risk of casual observance, and at least
demonstrates that they're thinking about the problem.

Cheers to both companies for thinking about the issues.

According to his lawyer on Nightline (and this was not contradicted by
the former FBI computer-crime head), Congress wrote the copyright law so
that pirating software is not specifically criminalized unless one does
it for profit.  Whereas the wire fraud statute requires only a "scheme
to defraud"; there need not necessarily be a profit motive.

Illinois has off-track betting on horse races. You can place your bet at
one of these legalized bookie joints, then watch the race on TV and
collect your winnings. If you place your bet early in the day, you don't
even have to wait around for the race. You can watch the race at home and
come back later to collect. That's the theory, anyway.

On Saturday, April 23, the computer system handling the betting for some of
the remote sites crashed after the fourth race. People at the betting parlors
were told that they couldn't place any more bets. But what about those who had
placed their bets and left? When winners returned on Sunday to collect, they
were surprised to learn that, from the racetrack's point of view, they had
never placed a bet, and were offered only a refund of the cost of their
ticket.

So were losers, if they had kept their tickets and happened to hear about the
computer crash. However, the fact that refunds were available was not listed
in the newspaper with the race results, mentioned on the telephone hot line,
or mentioned on cable TV broadcasts of the races.

On Monday a class-action lawsuit was filed. By Tuesday, racetrack management
had decided to pay up.

The system, designed by Amtote International, had only been in operation for a
month. On the other hand, state officials had sued Amtote before for
deficiencies in the previous system. No description was given of the original
failure, but newspaper reports (Chicago Tribune, 4/26/94 and 4/27/94) said
that a hardware problem caused the backup system to fail.  The new system was
designed to be "user-friendly." I hate to say it, but the most user-friendly
component in this incident was the lawyers!

                             [IMAGE] MTV SUES CURRY
Last update: May 10 1994
_New Jersey, May 10 1994_

I had planned to keep the following quiet until more information was available,
but since several journalists have already caught wind of it, I decided to get
it out into the open so my side of the story is heard as well.

The domain I maintain and operate on the Internet, mtv.com was founded
approximately one year ago. At that time I registered mtv.com with the
InterNIC, purely because it was a cool address to have, and it was available.
What a great "vanity plate"!

The site quickly became a frequently accessed "hangout" on the net, with an
average of 35000 accesses daily from Mosaic clients alone. During the start up
months I had many conversations with executives at MTV Networks about my
endeavours, which btw, were all financed out of my own pocket, and vps from MTV
Programming as well as Viacom New Media were aware of what I was doing on the
internet, and although they stated "MTV has no interest in the internet" they
gave me their blessing and supported my efforts.

This was enforced when I set up several email accounts on mtv.com for use in
MTV's on-air programming. Ever since the summer of '93, <A HREF="mailto:popquiz@mtv.com">popquiz@mtv.com</A> was
used for trivia quiz questions, that were then aired on MTV's "Most Wanted" a
program I hosted at the time. Solicitations were made on the air, and the
address was shown on the screen. For MTV's annual Valentines video dedications,
viewers were offered the choice of calling in their dedications, or sending
them via email to <A HREF="mailto:elove@mtv.com">elove@mtv.com</A>.

I never charged MTV Networks for this service, I purely saw it as a cool
feature to introduce to MTV's programming, spreading the "gospel", so to speak.


Then I started to get a lot of press about mtv.com, and some people started to
wake up at 1515 Broadway (MTV's HQ in New York City). And I was served with a
"Cease and desist" on the use of mtv.com. MTV's attorneys claimed that there
could be "confusion" for users of the internet, when connecting to *anything*
that had the letters mtv in the address, and then receiving music and
entertainment information. I was obviously hurt by this move, but did see what
point they were driving at, an asked if we could settle this matter amicably.

The situation cooled down for a couple of months, but when I resigned on-air
from my job as a VJ, which MTV chose not to air btw, things started to get
ugly.

Long story short, MTV Networks has filed a lawsuit against me, for copyright
infringement of their "trademark", that being their "MTV" call letters, as
well as having information online that was MTVN "property". In this case they
are referring to several press releases I put up on mtv.com, such an
announcement about Beavis and Butthead's "experience" cd release. Understand
that MTVN sent me these releases over their own internal computer network for
this very purpose! Again, I was only doing this to promote the channel, not
for my own personal gain..after all...mtv.com is free access for all, no
charge.

Throughout all of this I have offered to maintain the site specifically for
mtv, but again they said "we're not interested". Of course, I have no problem
whatsoever removing all references to MTV Networks and it's projects from
mtv.com, no that I don't work there anymore gives me even more reason to want
to do this, but the kicker is they are moving for an injunction to make me
stop using the internet address mtv.com!

This is of course totally unacceptable: I registered the domain name, and I
don't plan on giving it up. Sure MTV and their parent company Viacom have a
vast legal team, but david also nailed goliath, so I have faith. In the long
run, everyone knows that the only *true* winners will be the lawyers.

There are many different viewpoints on this situation, but I feel that the use
of mtv in an addressing scheme can't be seen as an infringement of
intellectual property laws, and a search of the InterNIC database shows at
least 15 domain names registered with mtv in the address. Irony is that I
incorporated a company called ON RAMP, Inc (tm) and onramp.com was already
registered to someone else, but I'm not suing them :)

It appears to me that MTV has their mind set on the address mtv.com, maybe not
for now, but possibly for future use, and I feel extremely used, in that I
built up quite an audience for that address, and they are basically saying
"thank you very much, you may go".

A pre-motion hearing is scheduled for this thursday morning at 11am, wit the
honourable Judge McKenna presiding, in an attempt to get an injunction to make
me stop using the address mtv.com. I will update the situation as it unfolds.

The L.A. Times today (May 11) published a story on the A300 crash last month
at Japan's Nagoya airport. I'll quote the first paragraph and then summarize
the remainder of the story.

"A terrifying battle between an inexperienced co-pilot and his airplane's
super-sophisticated computer system preceded last month's crash of a Taiwanese
jetliner that killed 264 people..."

The events described in the rest of the article are as follows:
1. The plane was being hand-flown on approach to landing by
   its 26-year-old copilot.
2. About 2 minutes prior to landing, the A300 went into
   "go-around" mode for reasons unknown.

3. Even though the pilot warned the co-pilot 3 times in 30 seconds, as
   recorded by the voice recorder, the co-pilot continued to attempt to land 
   the plane. The effect was that the auto-pilot was trying to pitch the 
   nose up using the "horizontal stabilizer flaps" while the co-pilot was 
   trying to pitch the nose down using the "elevator flaps" (the Times 
   author might have this a bit confused).
4. The crew then switched the "go-around" mode off. However, the "stabilizer
   flaps remained set at a sharp angle."
5. The crew realized the plane was too high to land, so they set the 
   "go-around" mode back on.
6. This caused the plane to climb sharply and approach a stall.  The A300 
   stall-prevention system automatically increased the engine thrust but 
   this INCREASED the climb angle to 53degs.
7. The airplane stalled.
8. The nose dropped and the airspeed increased to 150mph at an altitude of 
   260 yards.
9. At this point, the entire electrical system stopped functioning
   for reasons unknown, including the flight data and voice recorders.
10. The plane crashed, killing 264 people. There were 7 survivors.

The root cause of this crash seems to be a confused co-pilot. However, the
A300's automatic systems contributed in two ways.  First, it continued to
attempt the go-around even though the plane was still being flown by hand. Had
the auto-pilot disengaged (with a suitable warning!) this whole disaster may
have been adverted.  I think a human supplying control inputs is the "final
authority" and the automatic systems should "back off".  Second, the
stall-prevention system's actions (increasing thrust) contributed to the
stall. This is a serious kind of failure, if a automatic system designed to
prevent a problem makes it worse, it should do nothing at all!

I once talked to a major elevator company about doing just what the Schindler
Elevator Corp. is accused of doing by the Toronto government. (<A HREF="/Risks/16.04.html">RISKS-16.04</A>).
The company told me that they were in the habit of selling the elevators at a
loss so they could make up the money in service contracts. Then they found
themselves battling independent service companies who undercut their prices.
They hoped to use cryptography to lock out any other service provider without
the right key.

Of course, this loss-lead approach is common in many businesses. Car companies
often sell their cars at a low price and hope to make it up selling spare
parts later. That is why I discovered that a spare bumper for my car cost over
$500.

The difference is that other companies are now making duplicate parts.  The
major automakers can try and discourage them, but they can't lock them out of
the business.

Cryptographic locks, though, are a different story. They probably can't be
broken in a reasonable amount of time. (See also 16-04) I'm not sure of the
case law on this, but I would suspect that it might fall under questionable or
illegal trade practices. At least in the US.

I think a lot of people are missing the real point about the RSA.  On my
pocket PC, I can create a code that requires 5,000 MIP years to break in a
matter of seconds.  If I am willing to use several more seconds, I can make a
code that takes 10^25 MIPS years to break.  Compare this to any other
encryption scheme, and you will find that the workload amplification of the
RSA is quite good.

And Shannon told us in 1949 that any non-perfect information transform can be
broken with enough cyphertext - and developed the concept of workload for
evaluating cryptosystems.  If we want perfect cryptosystems we know how to get
them, but it requires secure distribution.  On the other hand, the RSA
provides any degree of complexity we wish to generate (finite) and a fantastic
complexity amplification factor, and the advantages of a dual public key
system that can be used for both encryption and authentication.

The point is that the RSA has not been broken, rather it has shown just how
much of a David is required to defeat a given Goliath.  After all, in terms of
that story, David would have been a MIP second and Goliath 5,000 MIP years in
relative sizes for a break-even fight.  I'll take that David any day.  FC

&gt; So where does the 40 quadrillion figure come from?

It comes from this very table. 10^9 is a billion, not a trillion, in the US
system, and 40 quadrillion is 4 x 10^16, which is even less than what I get by
interpolating to 425 bits (can anyone who has access to the original RSA
article verify this?).

There seems to be an interesting risk here: most encryption methods rely on
"hard" problems, i.e. problems whose "brute force" solutions require
computation resources which are an exponential function of the key length.
But in a world in which computing power grows exponentially, such problems can
be solved in polynomial (or even linear) time!

&gt;...they have _no right_ to use the product without that contractual agreement.

This confuses several issues--that of theft, that of use and that of
licensing, and in an important case Kabay's implied position is wrong.
Certainly---and this is his main point---theft of intellectual property is
theft. However, property protected by U.S. intellectual property laws, notably
copyright and patent protection (especially the latter)---can not simply be
withheld from use at the whim of the owner. For example, patent holders MUST
license equally to all who meet reasonable terms. Indeed, the _purpose_ of
copyright and patent protection is to promote the widest possible access to
the new ideas by insuring that their creators have economic motivation to do
develop them. The owners of intellectual property who want to restrict its
distribution are expected to look to the trade secret laws to protect them.

I'm not sure what requirements are imposed on copyright holders (and as an
aside, I sure would like The National Computer Security Assn. to argue that
copyright, not patent, is the only appropriate form of protestation for
software! heh, heh, heh.), but I suspect they can not capriciously and
arbitrarily withhold copy permission from some but not others, and it will
even surprise me if they can put irrelevant terms in the copy permission. None
of this speaks to licensing, but (I speculate) the only legal culprit in a
licensing violation is the licensee who allowed the copy. And presumably that
contract violation is a civil, not a criminal matter in American law.

One of the more subtle RISKS of E-Mail is in believing what you see.  Recently
a good friend of mine was repeatedly accused of posting not-so-nice messages
on various news-groups. Not so blatant as to be unbelievable but morally
damaging. This irritates me.

A few months ago I was flamed in RISKS for talking about the use of Ethernet
card firmware addresses as for tracking. Two weeks ago it enabled me to
quickly and positively identify the source of repeated failed attempts to log
into an Ethernet server as supervisor. When I asked the administrator for the
data in the log, he told me that he had never known that the six hex bytes had
a meaning.

Similarly, forged E-Mail is possible only because many E-Mail packages throw
away the Ethernet wrapper that made the communication possible in the first
place, a wrapper that *must* contain the return address or "the mail won't go
through".

Here I have FTP Software's (plug) PCTCP which provides an MSDOS machine with
more built-in features than many UNIX implementations (won't go into them all
else it would be an adv't but will just say that it allows me to identify not
only the source, but the path used to get here).

For example what most people see in an E-Mail posting is this (lines have been
wrapped to 80 characters &amp; true returns masked) - Judge and Goat are two PCs
in my office.

 Demonstration of message headers.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------

Note that not only the originating name is sent but also the true IP 
address [123.456.789.000]. Again this *must* be there.

Not to say that this is not a valuable capability since I prefer that
all incoming E-Mail come to a common point, just don't rely on them
since they can be *anything* the sender wishes.

Don't just toss those wrappers, dispose of them properly.

Subject: My tv show

(I thought you might be interested in this.)

New Cyberspace TV Program

I am developing a new program on cyberspace in conjunction with WGBH-TV, PBS'
Boston affiliate.  The show is intended to be a window onto the world of
computer networks for the television viewer, whose point of view is that the
world of on-line communications is interesting because of what people do
there, not because of the digital plumbing which enables it.  We will be
focusing on the human aspects of networking and the individual and social
aspects of being on-line.  Cyberspace will be portrayed as a not-so-really
strange territory after all, where all of us will increasingly come to live
and work.  My role is to guide people through this new territory, introducing
the audience to its native culture, its scenic attraction, and its sights and
sounds.

We assume our audience is motivated by curiosity to learn more about what goes
on in cyberspace, but we do not assume they are knowledgeable or, in general
experienced with it.  On the other hand, we will not trivialize the subject
matter by reducing it to a least common denominator.

We will give the show a look and feel which is approachable and down-to-earth.
Interview guests and roundtable participants will be drawn from the net
community itself.  There will be plenty of demos of cool net stuff from
Mosaic, CU See Me, and other cutting-edge applications and services.

We are taping two test shows in mid-June which will be shown in Boston and
other cities and hope to have some sort of national distribution (to be
determined) in the fall for a regularly scheduled program.  We are also going
to create a WWW server for the show, the segments of which will be
downloadable.  The server will be have on it additional material which won't
fit into the show format.


An Invitation:

We would like to include some video clips of net citizens expressing their
greatest hope and worst fear about the future of the net which we will edit
into an on-air piece for our regular feedback session.

It's important to me to have the voices heard (and faces seen) of people
already on the net.  This is an opportunity for those of us who enjoy
appreciate the decentralized and democratic character to express that
sentiment to a mass audience.  I hope you'll take advantage of the
opportunity.


Guidelines:

Since an individual on-air clip will run at most 20-30 seconds, please keep
your statement succinct.

In shooting the clip, please feel free to pick a location which says something
about yourself, whether it's your computer, your pet, or the great outdoors.

We can accept Quicktime movies, VHS cassettes, or 8mm tapes.  If you enclose a
mailer, we will return your tape.  We can also pick up digital submissions
from any FTP site, etc.

Oregon State University, America West Airlines, and Honeywell are conducting a
study of flightdeck automation for the Federal Aviation Administration which
requires input from the scientific community.

The increasing use of automation on the flightdecks of commercial transport
aircraft has raised concerns about the overall safety effects of this
equipment.  While several studies have attempted to address some of these
automation issues, until now no one has tried to systematically identify all
issues that exist about flightdeck automation.  The objectives of this study
are to collect and compile a comprehensive list of all flightdeck automation
problems and concerns and to address them in order to identify or generate
recommendations and guidelines for the FAA, manufacturers, and operators.

To achieve these objectives we are soliciting information on automation
problems and concerns from individuals in a variety of disciplines.  When we
have compiled these problems and concerns we will prioritize them, study the
highest priority items using analytic methods and simulator studies, and
identify and develop recommendations based on our findings.

Although we are primarily targeting the aviation community for sources of
automation problems and concerns, we recognize that individuals in other
disciplines have knowledge of other kinds of system automation and know of
automation problems or have concerns about automation that would be very
relevant to our study.  Experts in computer science, human factors
engineering, psychology, and other fields often deal with the automation of
industrial systems, office equipment, and even consumer devices, so we welcome
information from them.

If you have direct knowledge about system automation and you know of problems
with or have concerns about the safety of such automation, you can help us by
filling out a copy of our Automation Problems and Concerns Questionnaire. This
is an opportunity for you to contribute to flight safety and, if you wish, we
will put you on our distribution list to receive copies of reports on the
results of our study.

If you would like to fill out a questionnaire, send a message to
<A HREF="mailto:flight@engr.orst.edu">flight@engr.orst.edu</A> (don't post your request to this newsgroup!).  Request a
copy of the Automation Questionnaire, and I will send you a copy via e-mail.
When you have completed it (which should take between 15 and 30 minutes), just
e-mail the completed version back to me.  The problems and concerns you
identify will be added to our database and used in our study.

I work at a local HMO, Harvard Community Health Plan, on evenings and
weekends.  When we see patients, we get a printout of the recent visits by
those patients, along with diagnoses, major and minor problems, medications,
etc.  HCHP uses a 4 character code for most of these, consisting of a letter
followed by 3 numbers (for example, O991 is a headache).  However, the same
code can mean different things in different areas.  I saw one chart that had a
diagnosis of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, which is odd as an isolated finding
in a young adult.  Curious as to how this devastating diagnosis got on this
persons chart, I did some looking, and finally found that the same code was a
procedure code for the administration of a particular vaccine, but it had been
cast as a diagnosis instead.  I alerted the patient (and medical records) to
the problem, since otherwise I could see this person being denied life
insurance in the future.

Obviously, identical codes should not mean different things in different
fields.

Hello. I'm the Sysop of one of the BBSs in Italy.

I'm writing this message in this list to inform you, the BBS community, of
what is going on in Italy.

Some days ago, starting from Pesaro (Italy), our Police started a large
perquisition through [inquisition against] many Amatorial [amateur] BBSs,
mostly connected to the main networks (One for all: Fidonet... but also
PeaceNet and many others)

They're getting everything they can find: computers, monitors, drives, hard
disks, floppy, cdrom, streamer tapes ... everything, without looking if they
are or not in any way "illegal" ...

Generally, every network in Italy is now full of holes... and many of us lost
everything "in the name of the anti-piracy"...

Nobody of us is doing anything in any way illegal, but they are still getting
everything...

They got more than 50 BBS and Police's work is still going on...

I hope that everyone diffuses this message ... or in any way tells everybody
what's going on ...

...and if you have any way to help us...please do it!  We made our best to
make the Italian telecommunication scene working...  they are killing us!

See you later... if they don't get me!

Subject: Umass/Amherst Suffers From Week-long Service Degradation
Newsgroups: comp.dcom.telecom
X-Telecom-Digest: Volume 14, Issue 229, Message 4 of 14

After slightly over a week of unreliable phone service things returned to
normal and the following appeared in the May 13th edition of "The Campus
Chronicle".

Jonathan Welch  VAX Systems Manager  Umass/Amherst  <A HREF="mailto:JHWELCH@ecs.umass.edu">JHWELCH@ecs.umass.edu</A>

                                  - - -

Telephone system returned to normal 
         
As you know, the University had a major problem with the campus telephone
system which began last Monday, May 2. The symptoms of the problem included
calls being cut off, static, a "fast busy" tone when calling on campus and
telephones without dial tone. The symptoms were sporadic and fairly random for
both academic/administrative telephones and residential telephones.

As soon as the problem started, Ericsson, the manufacturer and maintainer of
the telephone system, responded. Ericsson staff worked straight through from
Monday morning to late Thursday evening to diagnose and remedy the problem. In
addition to the normal three on-site technicians, Ericsson brought in staff
from their regional headquarters in Northboro, and flew in a high level
technician/ system programmer from the Technical Assistance Center in Cypress,
Calif.  They also had programmers in Cypress and Sweden working remotely to
stabilize the system and to determine the cause of the problem.

The problem with the system resulted from a unique set of circumstances
involving software parameters, system clocking and a normal maintenance
procedure performed on the system. The problem was exacerbated by the
increases of load on the telephone system we have experienced this year.

The campus telephone system is a complex, distributed computer. Such systems
are designed with a great deal of redundancy and can self-correct for many
faults. Once the problem occurred, parts of the system were continually
trying to reset themselves. In this instance, the complexity of the system and
its attempts at self-correction made it difficult to trace the problem and
stabilize the system. By Wednesday afternoon, Ericsson had made substantial
progress in correcting the problem. They made a configuration adjustment in
the system and implemented a slight but important programming change in the
software. This adjustment, while straightforward, was difficult to install on
the system because of the heavy call volume on campus and the size of the
campus system (18,000 lines on 119 system modules).  What Ericsson
accomplished is analogous to fixing an electrical problem in a car traveling
down the highway at 50 miles per hour. The parameter they adjusted did not
initiate the problem, but the change allowed the system to return to normal
operations.

By early Thursday morning in the residence halls and noon on Thursday in the
academic/administrative area of campus, service had considerably improved.
Except for a brief interruption of service while circuits were being tested,
calls in progress were no longer interrupted by static or cut off. There may
have been some problems completing a call or placing long distance calls while
work was in progress. However, in general TelCom was quite successful at
assisting individuals in making their long distance calls. Ericsson has made
adjustments in the system configuration, system clocking and maintenance
procedures to ensure that this problem will not recur. I realize the telephone
service problems last week were very frustrating for everyone. Telephone
service is an important part of our daily lives and any interruptions or
degradations in service are a very serious problem. I truly appreciate the
patience of the campus community while we struggled to deal wilh the problem.

We in TelCom, as well as the Ericsson staff, were even more frustrated (if
that is possible) at not being able to get the problem resolved quickly. We
apologize for the difficulties and will work closely with Ericsson to prevent
this problem from occurring again.

<ADDRESS>
Peter Ladkin

<I>Fri, 13 May 1994 21:24:17 +0200</I><PRE>

On 26 April, a China Airlines A300-600 crashed on landing at Nagoya airport,
killing 264 people. The crew had announced they were `going around' (aborting
the approach and gaining altitude to come back for another landing attempt),
but continued the approach. Near the ground, the aircraft pitched up (raised
its nose in the air), stalled, and `hit the ground at a high rate of descent,
tail-first and completely stalled'. (Flight International, 11-17 May 94, p5).
Part of what is known so far is that the Flight Director or FD (a form of
autopilot) was in `go-around mode', and the co-pilot was physically trying to
counteract the guidance of the FD, specifically against published procedures
(FI, op. cit.). The FD, trying to fly up with the co-pilot commanding fly-down
on the elevator, counteracts with nose-up trim (the horizontal stabilizer at
the tail is repositioned by the pilot or by the FD so as to maintain a desired
attitude of the aircraft, climbing, cruising, or descending, simply by
aerodynamic equilibrium.  This is called `trim').

At 700 ft, both autopilots are disconnected. The aircraft pitches up steeply
because full nose-up trim has been applied (this cannot be overcome by
control-column input alone -- pilots must readjust trim).  At 540 ft, the
anti-stall system triggers full power, which gives additional pitch-up moment,
and the aircraft enters a very steep climb with a pitch of 36 degrees.  The
pilots fail to readjust trim. At 980 ft, a pilot selects flaps-up to go-around
setting causing a pitch-up to 52 degrees, and a speed decay from 124kt (slow)
to 78kt (disastrously slow) (FI, op.cit.)

To give an idea, light planes stall (their wing ceases to provide lift) when
the angle of the wing to the `relative wind' (the airflow vector considered
relative to the wing of the aircraft) becomes roughly 15 degrees. Transport
aircraft are similar, but I don't know the stall angle of the A300-600 wing in
landing configuration.

The Japanese Transport Ministry's Aircraft Accident Investigation Committee is
also looking into an apparent loss of all electrical power moments before the
crash. The chairman, Manabu Matsumoto, has `no recollection of a case like
this, an apparent failure of all power'. (International Herald Tribune, 11 May
94 p2).

Features of this accident of potential interest to RISKS readers at this point
are (a) the preliminary confusion of the crew about which control mode was
selected on the autopilot; (b) the full nose-up trim consequence of the
interaction between the co-pilot and the FD; (c) the autopilot triggering
full-power and therefore a high nose-up moment when the nose was already high;
(d) the apparent failure of all power.

One should be cautious if trying to `second guess' the accident investigation.
Airplanes such as this are meant to be flown a certain way, in which pilots
are thoroughly trained. Pilots are generally legally required to hold to those
procedures except in case of emergency.

In the May 12 Financial Times of Canada, there is an article entitled "How
palm-reading can speed your way into the U.S."

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Put your hand up if you've had it with the interminable lineups to pass
through airport immigration checkpoints when travelling to the United States.
That upraised hand could be your ticket to zipping right through.

The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is testing a new
system that turns your hand into the only piece of identification you need
to bypass immigration officials ans skip right through customs, cutting up
to 45 minutes off the procedure for heading south.

Called the INS Passenger Accelerated Service System (INSPASS), it works
like this: a three-dimensional image of your hand is electronically
recorded on a white, plastic, wallet-sized card.  You run the card through
a scanner, place your palm onto an electronic reader and, as long as your
hand and the card match, you're issued a computer-generated receipt that
opens a gate arm, sending you past immigration officials to custom
inspection.

[Summarizing the next few paragraphs, INPASS is being tested at three
sites: Pearson (Toronto), JFK, and Newark.  The article goes on to explain
registration at INS offices, which takes about 10 minutes and is free
during the indefinite test period.  Open to citizens of Canada, Bermuda,
Japan, New Zealand, most of Europe and the U.S., but have to make at least
three business trips per year to qualify.]

Concerned about privacy?  Sally Jackson, director of public affairs for the
Offices of the Information and Privacy Canada, says you shouldn't be.  The
only people participating are those who consent to putting their hand
impression on the card; besides, no other record of the hand image is kept.

So far, 26,502 people have signed up for INSPASS, including 2,764
Canadians.  More people, no doubt, will follow when they realize how, uhhh,
handy the system is.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

What happens if the systems does not recognize your hand?  I'm curious as to
the recognition rate.  For example, if you get married after registering, will
a ring throw the system for a loop?

Also, I find it interesting that the image is kept on the card only.  Will
the INS keep a record of your travels?  (Or do they already?)

<A HREF="/Risks/16.05.html">RISKS-16.05</A> and -16.06 included discussion of problems with cable-TV
notice-generation systems crashing and leaving cryptic or amusing error
messages for all to see ("Amusing computer-related anecdote about local cable
service," Long, Jones, Hrisko). Failures and usability problems with such
computer-driven notice boards can sometimes have more serious consequences:

My father lives in a retirement community in a high-rise building. While I
was visiting there recently the building's fire alarm went off. My father
immediately said, "Turn on the TV -- channel 8."

The building's cable system includes a local notice-board channel that
typically shows screens rotating through the dining room menu, daily
events, and so forth. It's also used for emergency notices.

Sure enough, within a few seconds, the notice channel stopped showing the
lunch menu and switched to something like:

        The fire is on the 75th floor.
        Please follow the directions of your floor warden.

(Evacuation procedures apparently differ according to location above or
below the fire floor.) The problem with this notice is that the building
has only 24 floors!

Evidently someone in the management office soon realized the error.
Everyone in the building was then treated to several minutes of
cursor-dancing around the screen, as that person tried, unsuccessfully, to
change the notice. A cursor would move around the screen, closing in on but
failing to select the floor number; the screen would switch to a Master
Menu Page and back to the fire notice again; more vain attempts would be
made to select the floor number; back to the Master Menu; and so on.
Finally things remained static for several minutes. "Aha," said I, they've
gone to get The Expert." Sure enough, when screen activity resumed the
floor number was immediately changed to a reasonable one, just in time for
the all-clear. (It was a false alarm, as are most of the alarms in that
building, but that's a different RISK.)

Electronic notice boards in public or semi-public settings can be used for
things other than routine bulletin-board postings. If they're going to be used
for getting across emergency information, then the same requirements for
usability under stress and that we'd expect for other safety-critical
applications apply to them, too. We'd also expect that users of such systems
ought to be thoroughly trained for emergencies, but system design ought to
allow for situations where a not-so-thoroughly-trained user is all that's
available.

	Mich Kabay complains about criminals wanting their 4th amendment
rights preserved.  If the state wants to wiretap their conversations, odds are
good that a judge could be convinced of probable cause.  The fact is these
wiretaps are warrantless, and should be replaced by wiretaps authorized by
warrant.  I've also yet to hear of criminals (outside of Congress) who want to
deny others rights they claim for themselves.

	There are several clear risks in denying someone all of their rights
because of a conviction.  They include false convictions, a growing disregard
for the Constitution, and the moral problems of punishments being chosen by
prison officials/cops, rather than the judicial system.

The following notice was released by NIST a couple weeks ago, but
doesn't seem to have made it to RISKS yet.

No additional information is available regarding the nature of the "minor
flaw."  I called NIST and the NSA when the announcement first came out, but
was told that details of the problem were confidential.  They also didn't know
when a revised version would be available.

It will be very interesting to see whether non-NSA cryptographers find the
problem...

	NIST ANNOUNCES TECHNICAL CORRECTION TO SECURE HASH STANDARD


     The National Institute of Standards and Technology today announced it
will initiate a technical modification to a computer security standard used to
support the authentication of electronic messages.  The revision will correct
a minor flaw that government mathematicians discovered in a formula that
underlies the standard.

     The Secure Hash Standard, adopted as a federal information processing
standard (FIPS 180) in May 1993, can be used for computing a digital signature
and remains a highly secure way to ensure the integrity and authenticity of
data used in electronic mail, electronic funds transfer, software distribution
and data storage applications.  NIST expects that products implementing the
current standard can be used until the technical correction becomes effective.

     Researchers at the National Security Agency, who developed the formula
and discovered the flaw in a continuing evaluation process, now believe that
although the formula in FIPS 180 is less secure than originally thought, it is
still extremely reliable as a technical computer security mechanism.  The
discovery of this flaw indicates the value of continued research on existing
and new standards.

     The Secure Hash Standard specifies a secure hash algorithm for computing
a condensed representation of a message or data file.  This 160-bit condensed
message "digest" represents the original message and can be used in computing
a digital signature to authenticate the integrity of the message.  It is
highly probable that any change to the message after it has been signed will
result in a different message digest, and the recipient will not be able to
verify the signature.  Signing the message digest rather than the whole
message usually improves the efficiency of the digital signature process.

     It is very highly improbable that today's computation equipment can
figure out any message that corresponds to a given message digest.

     The standard applies to agencies of the federal government for protecting
unclassified information when a secure hash algorithm is required.  Private
and commercial organizations have been encouraged to use this standard on a
voluntary basis.  The SHS was designed to be used with the proposed Digital
Signature Standard, which is based on the digital signature algorithm and has
not yet been approved.

     As a non-regulatory agency of the Commerce Department's Technology
Administration, NIST promotes U.S. economic growth by working with industry to
develop and apply technology, measurements and standards.  NIST also is
responsible, under the Computer Security Act of 1987, for developing standards
and guidelines for the cost-effective protection of unclassified federal
computer systems.

Recently I've had a problem with incoming mail to my home address. A few
months ago, mail started arriving (late) with just the wrong zip code and
sometimes with the wrong town name too.  The incorrectly addressed mail was
usually magazines and junk mail but when credit card bills started arriving
(or not arriving) with the wrong address it was time to investigate.

My wife checked at the local post office and they said that this was a problem
for the whole zip code; the whole town had been affected.  The post office
officials had no explanation as to how this might happen.  They explained that
it our responsibility to correct those who have the wrong address.

The more important ones were corrected over the phone, although it was
sometimes difficult to convince the operator that we hadn't moved, the address
had spontaneously changed.

Whatever generated the wrong address is still at work.  After getting the mail
addressed correctly for a few months, the wrong address would reappear.

The post office's solution to this problem is to print bar-coded labels with
the correct zip code and stick them to the mail.  Mail is now arriving on
schedule even with the wrong address.

I've all but given up on correcting the wrong addresses.

I'm guessing that some address verification service shipped a data base with
the wrong zip code for our town.  (I wonder how many other towns were
affected?)  Some mailers just updated the zip code and others trying to get a
canonical address used the new (wrong) zip code to determine the town name.

  "There is something a little eerie about picking up a car phone and having
  a voice describe your location to within a few feet on a pleasant if
  unremarkable street of colonial and tudor-style houses."

That's a quote from a second article in the New York Times promoting the Avis
project to track the company's rental cars through GPS hardware and wireless
communications.  The full reference is:

  Peter Marks, For a few lucky motorists, guidance by satellite, New York
  Times, 2 April 1994, pages 1, 16.

The reporter apparently went for a ride with the system, and was enthralled.
No doubt it was a fascinating experience.  This article does at least mention
privacy concerns, in a parenthetical note, as follows:

  "On the Nynex computer screens, the cars show up as small dots moving along
  the roads on the computer maps.  Nynex officials say, however, that for
  the sake of privacy, a car's position will only show up on a screen for the
  duration of a driver's call to the Project Northstar number."

Note that "privacy" only extends to what's presented on the operator's screen.
Nothing is said about the more fundamental issue, what records are stored in
the computer.

[EDUPAGE:]

&gt; A sweepstakes promotion sponsored by Nynex-owned New York Telephone used
&gt; replicas of customers' calling cards, including their secret personal
&gt; identification numbers, or PINs. The mailing has caused an uproar among
&gt; some of the three million recipients, who worry about unauthorized use of
&gt; their calling cards. Nynex has offered to change the PINs of customers who
&gt; complain and cover any fraudulent charges. (New York Times 4/7/94 A1)

What's wrong with this picture?  Well, changing the PINs only of customers who
complain is a bad plan -- what if I didn't see the ads and don't know I should
change my PIN?

Giving out real data (even card #s, let alone PINs) to a 3rd party (the ad
agency) is another bad plan.

Not treating customer data as secure is a third bad plan; it's especially
galling since NYNEX sends out these little reminder cards to customers telling
us not to divulge our PIN to anyone.

Speaking of galling, how "generous" of them to cover fraudulent charges.  As
if they didn't already do this.  It's a fancy way of saying "we're not going
to do anything about this."

The thing that particularly strikes me is that it appears NYNEX is, once
again, treating this as a special case.  This is a particularly annoying RISK
we see over and over again, where incidents are treated as aberrations and the
symptoms are treated with no thought given to the structural problems which
caused them.

I have no idea how to counteract this particular RISK, except by target
educating the relevant people, assuming we can find them.

	I was travelling from San Jose to San Diego two weeks ago (Fri.
evening: 29 April) and showed up at the airport an hour early (Fri. evening
rush hour expectations.. )  This is when the fun started: I found that the
phone systems in the airport were not working.  The supposed reason was a
pacific gas and electric problem (that's the local utilities company).

The immediate effects included:
   a&gt; air traffic control computers were no longer able to talk to each other?
	(Southwest airlines assured people that they would go back to the 
        technology of the 60's and there was no real danger) 

   b&gt; flights were delayed. 

   c&gt; reservation computers were down and out.. 
      - the fact that I had a reservation and for certain flight was
        known only to me and the airline personnel took me on trust. 
      - the fare amount was not known to the airline personnel in
 	general, and they had to confer with their manager for some of the
        fares .. (in my case they accepted the figure I told them ) 
      - The computers could not talk to the central database and this
        led to my being given a one way ticket while I really wanted a
        round trip.  (This led to my waiting in line for another 
        hour in San Diego on my return trip.. ) 

   d&gt; credit card approvals were no longer possible.. they took me on trust.

   e&gt; oh, the most comic of them all, flights were delayed and a number
        of people (I have to admit, I fell for it too !) were seen trying to
        call up their receiving parties in other parts of the country (and 
        slowly realizing that the phone were not working !) 

I assume there were other effects which i was not able to witness.

and to use a phrase I see on the digest fairly often : 
        The risks are obvious.

This _really_ alarmed me; but this is Un*x, so I guess it could just be a 
well-known `feature' ...

We mount a couple of disks from a neighbouring department's machine, mbfs.bio.  
They had some emergency maintenance to do (well I assume it was an emergency -- 
taking the machine down with &lt; a minute's warning is pretty d*mn unsound 
otherwise) so did a shutdown.  When I got the notification for this, I set 
about unmounting the disks asap:

<A HREF="mailto:eddy@eddy">eddy@eddy</A>&gt; su
Password:
NFS server mbfs.bio not responding still trying

but never got as far as delivering a password because of the downtime.  So my
machine hung and there was nothing I could do about it.  Perfectly normal 
hassle, irritating but no surprises.  So I go shopping and come back to find
mbfs.bio is back up and running ... however, my `su' has _succeeded_ despite 
the fact that I never typed the password:

NFS server mbfs.bio ok
eddy.gen.cam.ac.uk# whoami
root

Nice secure operating system this.

I'm surprised that no one has commented on the case of Joseph Jett, a managing
director/chief government bond trader at Kidder Peabody, who allegedly created
an estimated $350 million in phantom profits, resulting in his 1993
performance-based bonus of $9 million. Experts quoted in in recent articles
indicate that he must have made something like $35 BILLION in false trades
without anyone asking questions or the controls raising alarms. At this time,
lots of blaming is going on within Kidder Peabody as well as GE, the corporate
parent of Kidder.

Is this a computer crime?  It seems to me that this manipulation could only
have been accomplished through extensive computer manipulation by Jett and
possibly by others.  This may turn out to be one of the largest computer crime
losses to date.  It illustrates several points.

1. The growing problem of high level executives who are not being adequately
or in many cases even partially supervised.  They are in position to commit
crime by instructing others to enter a transaction and then destroying
evidence of their instructions or the transaction. This is a growth area for
computer crime.  Not a hacker in sight for this case.

2. Audit and accounting controls are often insufficient for large financial
systems and inadequate review requirements result in many of crimes being
overlooked, buried, or disregarded.  Wait until companies sign onto the
Information Superhighway!

3. Computer crimes and financial misdeeds get some (but inadequate) coverage
in the business press but very little in the material read by other relevant
people, such as computer professionals.  If this is a $9 million crime (his
false profits), a $350 million crime (the company's false profits) or maybe an
even larger loss (the company's negative reputation and possible financial
penalties due to legal proceeding), then how large of a loss must be reached
before a crisis is indicated?  Even the Volkswagen case of several years ago,
where an employee working in foreign currency transactions used his access to
computers to cause the loss of the equivalent of $US 256 million, didn't raise
many eyebrows in the business or computing communities.  If around a quarter
of a billion dollar loss doesn't indicate that computer crime is serious, then
what figure is enough to decide that the controls and the laws are inadequate
to meet the technological challenges?

Finally, anyone want to comment on the following statement of GE Chairman John
F. Welch, Jr.?  "It's a pity that this ever happened.  (Jett) could have made
$2 or $3 million honestly."

The 9 May 1994 "Aviation Week" (pp. 46-51) has an article on Controlled Flight
into Terrain (CFIT) -- when controllers or procedures fly you into the ground
short of the runway, usually in mountainous and/or poor weather conditions.
The article includes the following data (but given as a bar chart, and
oriented the other way).

                    Worldwide Airline Fatalities
            Classified by Type of Accident 1988 - 1993
    Source: Boeing (for aircraft &gt; 60,000-pound takeoff weight)
               (Excludes sabotage &amp; military action)

    Category                          # accidents  # fatalities
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    Controlled Flight into Terrain         28       1883
    Loss of Control (airplane caused)      10        460
    Loss of Control (crew caused)          14        357

    Other                                   5         15

76 total accidents, 3513 fatalities.  (How do you have *1* mid-air? 
They must be counting accidents, not aircraft involved.)

I'm dismayed by the size of the category called "Loss of Control (airplane
caused)", especially since they differentiated between that and airframe.
This implies (to me at least) software errors.  I can't help but remember all
the discussions we've had in RISKS about poorly-designed cockpit management
and fly-by-wire systems.

Rather than pointing out the obvious, as they do in the article,
I chose to rework the table a little, and make the bins wider.

    Category                                          Totals
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    Procedural  CFIT-28/1883, Mid-air-1/157, runway-3/43  32/2083
    Aircraft    LoC (plane)-10/460, airframe-4/278        14/738
	Crew        LoC (crew)-14/357,  fuel-5/107            19/464
    Weather     Ice/Snow-4/134, LoC (WX)-2/79              6/213
    Other       ???-5/15                                   5/15

One the one hand, if the flight crews blindly follow procedures, they risk
CFIT.  On the other hand, if they don't follow procedures, or forget things,
they run out of fuel or into adverse weather or onto an active runway.  We
should also remember that, unlike private pilots, these transport pilots are
expected to fly into and through moderate to severe weather all the time.

The risks?  We can all learn from this, no matter what we're working on.  We
need to examine all of our procedures with an eye to long-term consequences
when put into actual practice.  The human tends to learn, then memorize, and
eventually internalize (habituate) routine behavior.  Sometimes this routine
can be fatal.  I'm not sure how we make procedures good enough to be complete
and quick, yet flexible enough to not grow boring.

It's not just procedures in use on the aircraft, either.  Consider our own
motivation in whatever job we have.  How many of those airframe failures could
have been prevented on the shop floor?  How many of those software failures
could have prevented before the first compile?  We who manipulate symbols all
day don't often get the opportunity to "feel" the true meaning or impact of
our work.  Finding a way to do so might produce both better products and more
satisfied programmers.

The following story was related to me by a colleague of mine this morning.

She was editing some C source using a 'vi' compatible editor called
'vim'.  vim is a vi clone that adds some very useful features to the
editor. Many of us use it in place of vi. On this occasion she was
logged in to a Sparcstation via a terminal annex and modem from home.

She observed that numbers in here code kept on changing. Specifically,
decreasing by one for no apparent reason. A screen redraw might change:
	x = 1;
into
	x = 0;
and then
	x = -1;

It turns out that vim has a nifty feature whereby CTRL-A and CTRL-S add 1
and subtract 1 from a number respectively when in command mode. At the same
time, her modem was set up for XON/XOFF flow control and it seems that
somehow the CTRL-S's were getting through not only the modem but also
through her stty settings which might otherwise have interpreted the CTRL-S
as a STOP character. 

The upshot of all this was that in an attempt to regulate data flow through
the modems, the XON/XOFF protocol was actually mutating her source if the
cursor was on a number when a CTRL-S came through.

The RISKS of this are painfully obvious. Critical code can end up being
mutated and having serious effects later on if the changes are undetected.
I am reminded of stories about a missing '-' causing a certain NASA mission
to fail in decades past.

Whether this situation can occur easily or whether it was an unfortunate
combination of settings, especially 'stty stop' which I suspect was changed
from the normal ^s, I do not know, but I will certainly be verifying all my
modem and terminal settings when I get home tonight.

According to the Reuter newswire (via Executive News Service on CompuServe),

  LONDON, May 16 (Reuter) - Crooks used a stolen cash dispensing machine set
  up in a fake finance shop to steal 250,000 pounds ($374,400) in a high-tech
  swindle, a British newspaper said on Monday.
     The cash dispenser, ripped out of its legitimate location using a
  mechanical shovel and a fork-lift truck, was installed in a shop in London's
  Bethnal Green district painted to look like an advice centre for home loans,
  the Sun tabloid reported."

Apparently the stolen ATM simply recorded the card info and PIN of everyone
who tried to use it.

Total thefts from other cash dispensers amounted to over 240,000 pounds in 6
weeks.  The Sun reports that "A man has been charged with conspiracy to
defraud...."

[MK comment: now consider whether this scam would have been effective if users
were issued smart cards for their bank and credit functions.  The user
approaches the ATM and inserts the smart card.  The ATM challenges the smart
card (or prints a challenge string on a screen) and the smart card responds
with a cryptographic function of its serial number and a seed such as time of
day and date (or the user enters the challenge on a membrane keyboard and
copies the one-time response from the card's LCD into the keypad).  The ATM or
banking network validates the response and continues the transactions.
Results of setting up a spoof on a stolen ATM: zero.]

I bought a lot of money orders at my local branch bank (to pay bills, they're
free and clear faster) and watched the teller make them.  Here's what goes on:

1) I give her the check.
2) She verifies the funds.
3) She makes the money orders.
4) She hands them to me.
5) She hits the "Hold Funds" button and stamps the check "HELD" in red ink.
6) Transaction ends.

I asked why she waited until she gave me the money orders to hold the funds.
She said they do so because the procedure to un-hold funds is very difficult
and time consuming, requiring many signatures.

Fraud opportunity:
1) Steps 1 and 2 as above.
2) While she is in steps 3 &amp; 4, I use my cell phone to signal my accomplice.
3) My accomplice withdraws the cash from an ATM.
4) She does step 4. I run out (or hand off the money orders).  Whatever.
5) She cannot HOLD the funds, but I have the money orders. My accomplice
   has the cash.

RISKS to this fraud?
1) They know me by name at my local branch.
2) My account is real. It would need to be enough cash to escape the country,
   yet be under my maximum daily withdrawal limit ($1000). The maximum value
   of the funds would be $2000, unless multiple people coordinated multiple
   simultaneous withdrawals (like the bank personnel wouldn't notice)
3) many others... the cash reward for the risk is too small, but the window of
   opportunity exists.

The 17 May 1994 Wall Street Journal includes an article, excerpted from a new
book (which I have not seen) entitled "Tainted Truth" by Cynthia Crosson,
about the practice of "tactical research", the creation of customized policy
research as part of public debates.  She details the example of computerized
life-cycle analysis for cloth versus disposable diapers.  As with most
computer models, you can get a wide variety of answers depending on the
estimates you give for a large number of hard-to-measure quantitative
variables.  (How many times does a cloth diaper get changed in its lifetime?
How often do people use two diapers rather than one?)  I have heard many, many
anecdotes of computer models being manipulated to give the desired answers;
you probably have too.  It's certainly not a new phenomenon, having risen to
prominence in during the zenith of the systems modeling fad in the 1960's.

Crosson's article tries to explain how this manipulation comes about.  Are 
the modelers consciously trying to fool people?  Much as I resist that answer,
out of an ideological preference for more more complex and systemic kinds of
answers, that's basically what she says.  Once you start making your living
making models whose answers are convenient to certain sorts of people, she
says, a sort of treadmill gets going and it's hard to get off.  The phenomenon
is particularly important in the context of the ongoing US health care debate,
in which a blizzard of made-to-order numbers circulates through advertisements
and talk show hosts, all of them resting on more assumptions than you could
shake a stick at.

What's the answer?  How about a public education campaign about the concept 
of sensitivity analysis?  The more reputable polling agencies might frequently
use loaded questions, but at least they feel obligated to explain that the
numbers have a statistical margin of error of +/- 3% or whatever.  Likewise,
people presenting models should expect to be asked, "what are your input
variables, and how sensitive is your answer to the range of plausible values
for each?"  That's a simple enough question that a fairly large percentage of
the population can understand and ask it.  It's not adequate, of course, since
assumptions can be built into computer models in a wide variety of ways.  But
I expect that it's sufficient to get rid of the first 90% of the bogus uses of
modeling.

There are two interesting lessons hidden in the fact that the NSA discovered
some flaw in the Secure Hash Algorithm (<A HREF="/Risks/16.07.html">RISKS-16.07</A>) and announced that
they were working on a fix:

*) They're become slightly more open-- if only to authentication technology.

*) This proves the RISK of using a hardware based standard. Apparently
there is a whole batch of now obsolete CAPSTONE chips sitting in a warehouse.
Capstone was supposed to be Clipper + authentication, but now it will have
to wait for a new version. 

Imagine if Capstone was widely distributed when the error was found? Would
you replace your phone/modem/PCMCIA card is you had bought a version that
was made obsolete by progress? How long would it take the country to
recover from such a problem? What if the standard was blown wide-open?

John Oram finishes an interesting submission about the installation of
"palm readers" at the border with:

&gt; Also, I find it interesting that the image is kept on the card only.  Will
&gt; the INS keep a record of your travels?  (Or do they already?)

Anybody who wonders about that need only have gone to Nicaragua in 1985, as
I did.  My travels take me out of the country a few times a year, so it
became immediately apparent that I had made some sort of list when, on
scanning my passport, the immigration officer would invariably write the
magic code on my entry form that means something like "give this one a hard
time."  For about 4-5 years (after which I evidently aged off the list for
lack of further "infractions") I had to allow a solid three hours of
connection time when entering the country so that they could search my
bags, count my money, grill me about my life, and so on.  I had never been
searched before this period; I have never been searched since.  But I was
searched *every* time in between.

Many people who travelled in Central America during that period have much
worse stories to tell.

As a result of all this, (1) I am not worried about palm readers, since
they give the INS no capability that they do not already have, and (2) I
have no illusions about the benign nature of government power, even in a
relatively free (so far) country such as this.

Adam Shostack, in bemoaning the invasion of convicted killer's privacy 
said probably the most outrageous thing I have ever seen in the RISKS forum:
"I've also yet to hear of criminals who want to deny others rights they 
claim for themselves"
Really? I believe that the right to =life=, =liberty=, and the pursuit of 
happiness is somewhat well known, and a convicted killer, kidnapper or 
robber has certainly shown a willingness to deny others those rights....
In our ongoing and totally justifiable drive to insure the integrity of 
our informational system, I think we should, at least once a day, do a 
reality check.
The RISKS of not doing so is to have safety, security and privacy =only= 
in virtual realities, and not in physical ones.

Alan Wexelblat &lt;<A HREF="mailto:wex@media.mit.edu">wex@media.mit.edu</A>&gt; writes about NYNEX/New York Telephone
mailing out replicas of customers' calling cards, complete with PINs.

There is an underlying historical problem with telephone calling cards in
North America that leads to a lot of this sort of trouble: those last four
digits were not intended to be a PIN in the first place.  The concept of PIN
as a 'something you know' identifier to be combined with the 'something you
have' card was kludged on to the original calling card scheme only after
massive fraud in the 1970s.  A simple (and widely publicized) check digit
scheme was previously used by operators to manually verify card numbers.

Current calling cards are unlike any other card one might carry, in that
they usually have the 'PIN' embossed on the card and encoded on the
magstripe.  Some newer cards (typically those that do not have a phone
number as the first ten digits of the number) do not have this problem.

It is inexcusable to use code numbers in the first place, much less to re-use
them.  This is left over from human procedures on paper forms.  The computer
is capable of freeing us from this kind of stupidity -- with arbitary length
on-line form fields, either intentionally readable by a human or intentionally
encrypted for privacy.  Even in the latter case, a decent code for a field
will be both unique and redundant (checked) so that a 1 or 2 digit typo won't
hit another defined code word.

From rec.humor.funny, but it belongs in Risks, too...

(True)

In an effort to snag more long distance telephone calls (charged to a credit
card or a third number), AT&amp;T reserved the toll-free number 1-800-OPERATOR.
Not to be outdone, and perhaps knowing the public better, MCI reserved the
number 1-800-OPERATER and has been scooping up calls intended for its
arch-rival.

&gt;From the Tampa Tribune, Wednesday May 25, 1994

Howard Jenkins was a multimillionaire for about a half a day.  About a week
ago he lost his checkbook and called his bank to have a hold put on his
account.  "When he went to make a deposit Fiday morning, he was told to check
the automated teller machine outside to make sure the account was working."
He made a small withdrawal and the receipt told him his account balance was
$889437.93.  He went home and called the bank's automated telephone account
inquiry system, and was informed that his balance was now more than $88
million.  He went back to the bank and asked a teller for his balance, and was
given an 8 digit number.  She asked if he had received "an inheritance or
something".

He withdrew $4 million in cashier's checks and cash, requiring a bank
manager's signature on each check, and they "didn't bat an eye".  He returned
later that day, accompanied by his lawyer, and returned the money.

The bank attributes the erroneous balance to a computer error, probably linked
to the hold transaction.

Several things stand out to me:

1) He was told to check an ATM to see if his account was working.  Whoever
told him this should have been able to check directly using the bank's
terminal.  The bank (and reasonably so) puts a great deal of trust in the
computer.

2) The balance shown on the ATM receipt was different than that given him by
the automated telephone information system and the teller.  Is this a user
interface problem, or something more involved?

3) The computer error is likely to be the fault of inadequate testing or a
user interface inadequacy (calling up a deposit transaction instead of an
account hold transaction).  Both topics have been discussed at length in this
forum.

4) Nobody questioned this withdrawal or the large deposit.  The teller who
checked his balance was the only one mentioned in the story that even noticed
his windfall.  Proper software and human procedural checks would have caught
this error.  If a pre-computer bank teller had been handed a deposit of this
size, the bank manager would have been notified.  When the withdrawal was made,
the manager would have known about the deposit and been confident that the
request was legitimate.  Are similar human checks and balances included in
modern banking computers?

ATTENTION LIBRARIANS -- FATAL BOOKSHELVES
        A union claims that Library of Congress employees are exposed to
potentially fatal crushing hazards caused by sliding mechanical bookshelves,
and asserts in a lawsuit that the bookshelves have occasionally started up
unexpectedly, undeterred by safety sensors.  The government insists the
bookshelves have experienced "only three or four failures," none of which
resulted in employee injury. (BNA Occupational Safety &amp; Health Reporter
5/18/94 p.1787)

RISK-TAKING
        Information technology visionary George Gilder calls Michael Milken a
risk-taker, "who was willing to plunge $2 billion into a company with $100
million in assets and $200 million in revenues. He had a great eye and really
did it brilliantly. The people who prosecuted him did not understand what he
was doing at all. It was mysterious to them and he was making too much money
to be legal [laughs]." (Upside, June 94, p.55)

Dell has issued a recall of 63,000 monitors after receiving 32 reports of
overheating or fires starting. The problem monitors bear the number DL-1460NI
on the back.
    Owners of the monitors with that number should call 1-800-913-3355 to set
up free pickup and repair.
    Arrangements also can be made through Dell forums on CompuServe and
America Online or by dialing Dell Computer Corp.'s bulletin board at
512-728-3589. Dell will ship packing materials to owners of the monitors, who
then will send them by Airborne Express to the company for repair within three
to five working days.

As reported in Toronto's EYE Newspaper [<A HREF="mailto:eye@io.org">eye@io.org</A>] (similar to New York's
Village Voice) dated 19 May 1994:

The London Ontario detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police have begun a
campaign of harassment against local University Internet users who are
attempting to use the net to gain information on the Karla Homolka trial. A
University of Western Ontario (London) student had his Internet account frozen
by the university computer staff when requested by the Police. The reason for
this lay in the student's name being left on the text of a FAQ of the details
of the trial. Another student in Toronto had Faxed this material (which had
been Emailed to him) to the Toronto media, and the offices of the Premier of
Ontario and the Attorney-General as an act of provocation against the Ban (his
regular anonymous forwarding site was not working). The problem was that he
had forgotten to remove the other persons name and account number from the
original E-mail that was sent out.

    The police action against the student's account was done without a
warrant, and also involved the questioning of the student at the local police
station. Likewise the students home computer was searched without a warrant by
using the threat of criminal charges. The Student's computer account was
reinstated, but he was required to turn over all incoming Email to the police
under the threat of criminal charges if he did not cooperate. A list of about
50 people who had received Homolka FAQ's were passed on to the police.  The
important part of this entire situation is that no one, including the Ontario
Attorney-General office is certain that the ban applies to the Internet. The
ban states that details of the trial cannot be published in the print media
but there is no ban on possession of information. There is no mention of the
Internet, nor the use of computer systems in the ban.  Further, there is no
official investigation of the Internet on the part of the Ontario Provincial
Police, except for this one detachment.

   One of the questions raised is the ethics of the University of Western
Ontario's computer department. Their cooperation with the police was based on
a fear of having their computer equipment confiscated (similar to the case of
the University of Cambridge in England). If the situation had taken place with
in the library system of the university, it would not have been tolerated by
the library staff due to the long held tradition in that profession of the
defence of freedom of speech. If the Internet is to remain open this set of
values will have to become part of the professional commitment of the MIS
staff of universities as well.

&gt; ... This is a serious kind of failure, if an automatic system designed to
&gt; prevent a problem makes it worse, it should do nothing at all!

This is probably true for conventional aircraft. For fly-by-wire aircraft,
however, the computer systems can never "do nothing".

I understand that the main computer system (in, e.g. A320) has six (approx)
flight modes, and that it responds slightly differently to manual inputs
depending on which mode it is in.  Pilots are required to understand the
differences between the modes.  I imagine that, in non-emergency situations,
the pilot would not need to worry about these differences: the aircraft would
respond "intuitively" to command inputs.  In very unusual situations, the
required inputs to the machine may be counterintuitive.  This can probably be
overcome in two ways:

(i)  Give the flight computer more modes to be in, so that it could behave
     "properly" or "intuitively" in the various situations.

(ii) Give the pilots enough simulator training so that the intuition takes into
     account the mode that the aircraft is in.

In critical manoevres, like landing and go-around, pilot confusion is to be
avoided at all costs.

re: joe jett's alleded fraud:

&gt; It seems to me that this manipulation could only have been accomplished 
&gt; through extensive computer manipulation by Jett and possibly by others.

I believe this is incorrect. 

It probably happened because the accounting system did not handle the trade
properly. i would guess that no outright manipulation of data or code was
necessary. also, his gross strips position was probably growing larger and
larger as time went on. this should have raised some red flags.

John Gersh writes regarding an information channel display that showed an
incorrect floor number during a fire alarm.  Other contributors have written
regarding cable-TV channels reporting "Software Failure" for hours or days
on-end.  As a manufacturer of such equipment for the Cable Television
Industry, I hope I can provide some insight.

A very common computer used in systems for broadcast applications is the
Amiga.  This is because of it's relatively low cost for this application, as
well as the fact that it generates clean video at standard NTSC/PAL rates. On
older versions of the operating system, if a program crashed severely (the
Amiga OS does not provide memory protection or resource tracking, yet is fully
multitasking), a flashing red "guru" message would appear, requiring an
acknowledgement from the user to reboot the machine.  Unfortunately, due to
the nature of cable transmission, these machines are usually located in very
remote sites.  Of course, many cable companies are too lax in even monitoring
for crashed displays.  Under newer versions of the OS, this problem is solved
in that after a timeout (usually 30 seconds), these requesters go away and the
reboot proceeds normally.  Since the Amiga isn't a very widely supported or
understood platform, most of these cable operators do not upgrade to newer
OS's, and some machines cannot legally be upgraded (physically they can, but
since ROMs are not available from Amiga, you have to make a copy of the OS and
install it on the hard drive of the machine, which is technically illegal.)
Our solution for our customers was to create a "watchdog" program that would
reboot the machine in the event that our main task failed in any way. We then
discovered something interesting: Most of the crashes occurring were not a
result of our program (or our competitors), but of line spikes and brownouts
trashing the machine.  We now insist that our customers at least purchase a
line conditioner or a UPS as a result.

One contributor to this list asked what cable companies will do now that
Commodore is out of business, regarding replacement parts.  For quite some
time now, it has been quite difficult to obtain support from Commodore anyway,
so my company as well as others have been acquiring spare parts from used
machines.  One should note, however, that Commodore's death is being
exaggerated on the net, and that there is indeed a buyer, but specifics have
not been made public at this time.

An interesting incident reported to me by a customer: During the March, 1993
earthquake in Klamath Falls, Oregon, cable service was not interrupted. The
911 emergency center was being swamped with calls, many of them for
non-life-threatening situations.  They called the cable company and requested
that a message be posted on the air to tell people with minor emergencies to
use an alternate number to reach the 911 center.  Unfortunately, the number
provided to the cable company was incorrect, and was for the main 911 center's
outgoing lines (non-emergency). The administrative office was then swamped
with calls, and could not obtain and outgoing line to call the cable company
and tell them to change the number.  As a result, the 911 center wants modem
access to our software so that they can alter displays themselves. (I don't
see how that could have prevented this particular situation.)  We are
currently evaluating how best to achieve this.  There are several liability
issues that open up when you allow third parties access to your airwaves.  Not
to mention the fact that while our software is password-protected at this
time, anyone with a password also has access to the billing and setup
functions.  We now have to segment our security further so that outsiders can
not mess with private or operation-critical information.

I am somewhat skeptical of the apparent failure in security described by
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:eddy@gen.cam.ac.uk">eddy@gen.cam.ac.uk</A>&gt; in <A HREF="/Risks/16.08.html">RISKS-16.08</A>.  I have been in the situation eddy
describes many times, and the "NFS server ..." message always appeared AFTER I
typed the password, if the password prompt appeared at all (sometimes it did
not).  In fact since the code in question queries you for the password and
then waits to collect it, it is difficult to imagine what it could be doing in
between those two operations that would involve NFS access.

Also, if the included transcript is literally accurate

 <A HREF="mailto:eddy@eddy">eddy@eddy</A>&gt; su
 Password:
 NFS server mbfs.bio not responding still trying

then, since the "Password:" prompt does not end in a newline, eddy must
have at least typed a newline before getting the "NFS server ..." message,
and the possibility that the entire password was typed before that newline
cannot be ignored; after all, until that much-loathed message appeared,
eddy was presumably expecting to "su" as usual so as to be able to unmount
the soon-to-disappear filesystems.

Of course, this is computer software, so I'm not saying it's impossible! 
But I'd like to see it duplicated before I believe it.  Unfortunately
eddy's message did not give the UNIX version involved in this scenario, so
I cannot do it here.

The _real_ risk is that once you've entered the password, you've got a
nascent superuser shell that anyone can type at once the server comes back
up.  Yet one hardly wants to stick around and guard it...  In a university
environment, this seems risky indeed.

Interesting point.  The risks of leaving the terminal unattended aren't the 
usual ones for a university; this is a lockable office which I share with folk 
that I trust not to abuse a root shell and who would have locked the office if 
they'd gone out in my absence -- ie, we don't get random undergraduates 
wondering in in our absence -- but I hadn't typed the password, so this 
wouldn't have been a problem (except that I'd feel shy of letting random UG's
get at _my_ account, of course; which is one of our reasons for locking the 
door).

&gt; ... if ... literally accurate ... possibility ... cannot be ignored ...

The transcript is literally accurate; I copied the text from the command-tool 
to the mail window by raw cut-and-paste.  I had not typed anything at the 
password prompt when the NFS server message came up; what I did type (a tenth 
of a second later -- thus before I'd noticed the message) was only the first 
three letters of the password and I soon removed those with ^U because they 
were being echoed !  I followed that with a return and several ^Cs (a strategy 
which doesn't trick su normally -- the first experiment I tried on discovering 
what had happened) so that nothing should sensibly have been able to go wrong.

&gt; ... after all ... eddy was ... expecting to "su" [so as] to unmount ...

Dead right there; but, as I say, I noticed what was happening _before_ I'd
typed the whole password.

&gt; I am somewhat skeptical ...

And all Dan's reasons for skepticism (which I respect as such given that he
only has the information third hand) are exactly the reasons for my horror
upon discovering that I'd managed to become root without having typed the
magic words.

&gt; I'd like to see it duplicated before I believe it. ... UNIX version ...

Yes, duplication under controlled conditions is the only way to confirm.  The
machine I'm running on is a Sun SPARCclassic running SunOS 4.1.3.

&gt;.....copies the one-time response from the card's LCD into the keypad).  
&gt;The ATM or banking network validates the response and continues the 
&gt;transactions.  Results of setting up a spoof on a stolen ATM: zero.]

Surely this is an example of the risk of becoming too enamoured of your own
ideas.  Regardless of the elaborate scheme proposed, all the fake ATM machine
needs to do is look like it is responding correctly, and the user will enter
his or her PIN.  The issue isn't validation, it's getting information out of
the user by deceit, and anything that fools the user will work.  Only other
information, not available easily either to the user or to the credit card
thief, will fill this security hole.

Instead, there probably has to be a piece of information possessed by the
"smart" card which cannot be obtained without correct authorization.  Only an
ATM hooked up correctly to the bank could obtain the passwords to unlock the
card, which then provides some internal code unrelated either to the PIN or to
the card account number.  However, this raises other issues, such as how could
you use such a card for phone charges?  Or how could charges be validated at
the point of sale?  Somehow the same challenge/response would have to occur at
Macy's as it does at the ATM, or what good would the internal validation code
do?  Thus, the challenge would be available for analysis on the general
telecommunications system, and a significant communications burden would be
placed on the system due to wide spread usage.  Somehow, I don't think it's
quite so simple.

Periodically I will remind you of TWO useful digests related to privacy, both
of which are siphoning off some of the material that would otherwise appear in
RISKS, but which should be read by those of you vitally interested in privacy
problems.  RISKS will continue to carry general discussions in which risks to
privacy are a concern.

* The PRIVACY Forum Digest (PFD) is run by Lauren Weinstein.  He manages it as
  a rather selectively moderated digest, somewhat akin to RISKS; it spans the
  full range of both technological and non-technological privacy-related issues
  (with an emphasis on the former).  For information regarding the PRIVACY
  Forum, please send the exact line:

information privacy

  as the BODY of a message to "<A HREF="mailto:privacy-request@vortex.com">privacy-request@vortex.com</A>"; you will receive
  a response from an automated listserv system.  To submit contributions,
  send to "<A HREF="mailto:privacy@vortex.com">privacy@vortex.com</A>".

* The Computer PRIVACY Digest (CPD) (formerly the Telecom Privacy digest) is
  run by Leonard P. Levine.  It is gatewayed to the USENET newsgroup
  comp.society.privacy.  It is a relatively open (i.e., less tightly moderated)
  forum, and was established to provide a forum for discussion on the
  effect of technology on privacy.  All too often technology is way ahead of
  the law and society as it presents us with new devices and applications.
  Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.  Submissions should go to
  <A HREF="mailto:comp-privacy@uwm.edu">comp-privacy@uwm.edu</A> and administrative requests to
  <A HREF="mailto:comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu">comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu</A>.

There is clearly much potential for overlap between the two digests, although
contributions tend not to appear in both places.  If you are very short of time
and can scan only one, you might want to try the former.  If you are interested
in ongoing detailed discussions, try the latter.  Otherwise, it may well be
appropriate for you to read both, depending on the strength of your interests
and time available.

GUARD DIED AFTER DOORS FAILED IN COURT FIRE.
The Glasgow Herald, Glasgow, Scotland, 25 May 1994

A failsafe system on security doors at Edinburgh's new sheriff courthouse did
not work on the night of a fire in which a security guard died, a fatal
accident inquiry heard yesterday.  Graham Scott, 39, managing director of
computer firm System 4, told the inquiry at Edinburgh Sheriff Court that
security doors which should have opened automatically in the event of fire had
remained locked.  Security guard George Campbell, 57, of Claremont Grove,
Edinburgh died when he was trapped in a lift by the fire on November 19 last
year.  Mr Scott said that a programmable computer chip in the system had its
information wiped accidentally and did not signal the doors to open.  The
doors normally worked by having a security card "swiped" through a device
which identified the card and allowed them to open.  The inquiry heard that
efforts by another security guard to reach Mr. Campbell failed when his card
would not open a door on to the sixth level where Mr.  Campbell was trapped.
Mr. Scott said that because the fire had burned for some time before being
discovered, it had probably burned through the cable connecting the door to
the main control computer, but a push button on the inside should still have
opened it.  He said that under the new system any door which was cut off from
the main control for more than 10 seconds would automatically unlock itself.

  [This tragedy seems to have been the result of a combination of
  problems: no escape route from the lift (elevator); no way of opening
  doors from the outside without the door computer working (sounds
  familiar!); and a specified but untested exceptional case.  The new
  failure mode is interesting too: they'd better keep that computer
  working if they don't want thieves to break into the courthouse! KH]

The May 25th edition of the Wall Street Journal has a long story by Daniel
Pearl about a crash of a small commuter airplane. The company seems to be
blaming the pilot and the story goes to long lengths to document his bad
attitude. His anger, the theory proposes, lead him to screw up in the bad
weather and misjudge the position of the ground by 300 ft.

The story is well-written and essentially balanced, but I wonder if the author
really thought about the spin he was putting on the story.  For instance, the
author "documents" the pilot's anger and abrasive behavior as such:
  
   "Always a meticulous person, Mr. Falitz became even more of a 
   stickler. He filed 14 anonymous (sic) air-safety reports,
   including one about a flight attendant who didn't have up-to-date
   paperwork." (I hope their anti-terrorist security is better
   then their protections for anonymity.)

   (Before the Flight) "Mr. Falitz had an angry argument with a
   gate agent over his paperwork, and a ramp worker in Minneapolis
   told the safety board that he saw Mr. Falitz chew out Mr. 
   Erickson (the co-pilot) for not checking the landing light
   from outside the plane. After the Hibbing-bound passengers were
   aboard, Mr. Falitz insisted on bumping one passenger to meet the 
   weight limit; a woman travelling with her family volunteered to get off."

To be fair, the writer also documents a time when Falitz slapped the headset
of a co-pilot after the co-pilot set it to the wrong channel. There are a few
other quotes that make Falitz seem a bit too disgruntled. For instance, Falitz
was annoyed because the airline was forcing him to make the doomed flight and
he would have to fly home on his day off.

But, I still was rather disturbed by the fact that the writer seemed to be
building an argument about Falitz's abrasiveness by citing Falitz's desire to
abide by the rules. The second paragraph I quoted ran directly under the
sub-heading "Quarrels with Colleagues." I wonder if the woman who was bumped
by the flight believes that the doomed plane should have taken off with too
much weight as well?

The best "fact" that proves Falitz was an abrasive pilot with an attitude was
that "On one sweaty flight, he announced to passengers that 'the company is
too cheap to fix the air conditioner.'"

Incidentally, the co-pilot on this flight that crashed made $18,000 a year. At
the time, small commuter planes were not required to have low altitude warning
devices that would have alerted the pilots to the fact that they were too low.
Big jets had them, but the companies didn't have to spend the money on the
little planes. They became required last month. The article also mentions that
the altimeters often stick.

The most dangerous subtext hidden in the article is the fact that the Federal
Aviation Administration is funding a program to develop personality tests for
pilots. I just hope that they can find a way to tame the anger without turning
the pilots into lemmings that accept low pay and badly maintained planes that
are overloaded with passengers and luggage.

A front-page story (!) in the May 26, 1994 _Detroit Free Press_ tells the tale
of a 31-year-old suburban Dearborn Heights man who has been arrested and
charged under Michigan's new anti-stalking law for alleged harassment of a
29-year-old Farmington Hills (another Detroit suburb) woman via E-mail. The
article refers to this as "one of the first cases of stalking based primarily
on E-mail.

Under a large color photo of Mr. Archambeau with his arm draped casually
over his computer, the story tells of how he was jilted five days into an
E-mail relationship carried out over America Online. After the woman
(anonymous in the article per her request) sent the "Dear John" E-mail
message, he has been sending her E-mail trying to win her back.

The two met via a video dating service. The woman states that received a
total of "about 20 E-mail letters" from Archambeau since the day she met
him, hardly mail-bombing by most RISKS readers' standards. She has saved
and printed the messages for her lawyers.

Archambeau claims that E-mail, by its nature, is non-harassing, because she
can refuse to read the message after seeing the sender: "I was courting her
in a way that she could easily ignore."

The recipient of his unwanted advances points out that her system won't
delete unread mail for 37 days, so she has to look at it for that long,
"which is more harassing than postal mail."

After being contacted by a Farmington Hills detective, Archambeau sent
several more messages to the woman, as well as one to the detective
explaining his side of the story. The detective said that the woman wasn't
"terribly concerned" about the E-mail until she received a phone message
from Archambeau in which he apologized for watching her leave her
workplace, which is a block away from where he lives.

The woman seems to be claiming that E-mail itself is harassing by its very
nature. She does not claim that the content of any of the messages were in
any way threatening, although the Farmington Hills detective said after he
had initially contacted Archambeau, later messages contained "other methods
of harassment if she carried through with a police complaint."

The Michigan "stalker" law makes it a misdemeanor to maliciously and
relentlessly harass and pursue someone, punishable by up to a year in jail
and a $1,000 fine. This is the charge against Archambeau.

The offense becomes a felony if threats are made or the person is under
court order to stay away from the alleged victim. Then the perpetrator
faces five years and $10,000.

Women's rights groups who helped draft the law say they are certain that it
covers E-mail harassment, but the ACLU, which has expressed concern over
the law being able to withstand constitutional challenge, is not so sure.

There is a strange and extreme dichotomy in this story. On the one hand, we
have the alleged perpetrator is claiming that E-mail by its nature *cannot*
be threatening, and on the other hand, the alleged victim is claiming the
opposite, that unsolicited E-mail is *harassing* by it's nature. Both
positions don't consider about the *content* of the message at all! This
case brings the all the RISKS of treating the medium of E-mail differently
than other channels of communication to the forefront in what may be a
precedent-setting court case.

A second RISK is in the news media's overemphasis on E-mail as a stalking
tool. In fact, the text of the article indicates that the only blatantly
threatening act (watching the victim leave work) was related over the phone.
Nonetheless, the media spin on this issue is solely the ground-breaking act of
stalking by E-mail.

Denyability/accountability of E-mail is a RISK that is not dealt with in this
article, mostly because Archambeau openly admits sending the E-mail in
question.

&gt;From the Washington Post newswire (94.05.23) via Executive News Service (GO ENS)
on CompuServe:

"In Silver Spring, the Public Can Log On to the Police Log"
 By Veronica T. Jennings 
 Washington Post Staff Writer 
 
    "In the corner of a second-floor office in the Silver Spring district
police station sits a computer terminal that may launch Washington area police
agencies onto the information superhighway.
    "The computer contains information on crimes and suspects and, as of last
week, it's available to the public on a pilot basis."

The author makes the following key points:

&lt;&lt;begin summary&gt;&gt;

o	The Police BBS makes local crime information, updated twice weekly,
available at all times.

o	Statistics include crime reports per block and county-wide.

o	The BBS also supplies "carjacking prevention tips and information on
new laws."

o	Neighbourhood Watch groups communicate with each other and with the
police.

o	The BBS supplies no new information beyond what is already available
on Police central computers.

o	The BBS is run by James Hockenberry, who removes sensitive information
before transferring files from the district computer into the BBS.  He also
translates code numbers into ordinary language.

o	The experiment is being closely watched by academics and by other
police forces around the U.S.

o	Access port:  301-565-5737 N/8/1.

o	"Several safeguards have been built in for privacy and security,
Hockenberry said. For example, it is not connected to the Maryland or national
criminal information networks that provide data to law enforcement officials
on vehicle registration or suspect information."

o	No disclosure of "exact street addresses of reported crimes or the
names of victims."

o	Authorities hope that improved availability of timely, accurate,
detailed crime statistics will lead to a more realistic appraisal of crime and
crime prevention.

&lt;&lt;end of summary&gt;&gt;

  [Comments by MK:  The manual transfer of data will eventually lead to a
  screw-up.  Confidential information will leak into the public domain and all
  hell will break loose, including lawsuits (O, Horror!).

The initiative sounds positive; I hope that the authorities will arrange for
automated processing of information to help the human supervisor prevent
errors.]

The newsgroup and offending details of this list also made their way to our
machine; I suppose the Ontario police object to details being published in a
case which is "sub judice". I have read (this may be wrong information) that
the details are being published by people who object to a plea bargain by the
(equally guilty?) Karla Homolka. This is not the way in which sub judice is
dealt with in Austria (I have recently moved back to the UK); often papers
will carry details from major court cases, but not name the defendants and not
quote any prosecution allegations. Many VERDICTS do not contain the convicted
man's name, so a "family" murder might be reported:
  "Dragan K. stabbed his father to death after an argument over the war in
  Yugoslavia" - the report will continue to expand on what took place, but the
  name is not given (anyone who thinks "Dragan" is a good clue has not met many
  (Yugoslav)s..).
The biggest advantage I can see to this approach is presented in minor crimes-
in the UK many minor crimes are wiped from the record 3 years after the end of
the sentence, but local newspapers indefatigably pillory the local fast
drivers, petty thieves etc by name - the only way to genuinely lose that
conviction 3 years after leaving prison is to move away, because someone may
dig up the newspaper report (indeed they WILL do so in Hicksville/
Nempnett Thrubwell).

"sub judice" publication of details of a case does of course cast doubt on
fair trials; I am sure that the individuals named as Lt. Starbuck etc in the
Homolka case do not want either of the accused to go free for lack of a fair
trial, but their actions could well cause a mistrial to be declared.

The Risk? The Internet is providing a sort of international newspaper; at the
moment it doesn't display a great deal of commitment to that role.  If The
Internet is "the new press", it's a pretty flabby alternative to the old one.

The Baltimore Sun ran an AP wire story (5/27/94, pg1) reporting that Dunkin
Donuts owners routinely places audio mikes in their stores for "security." The
story notes that the DD near Fort Meade, MD (the home of the NSA) contains the
equipment.

The story notes that the main corporate headquarters says that these hidden
microphones would be wrong. But it also cites Security systems dealer Jeff
Meuse who "told the Concord Monitor he has installed systems in 500 Dunkin'
Donuts in Massachusetts in the last five years; of those, 300 had audio
monitoring."

Several articles in a recent RISKS caught my eye in their common style of
taking too simple-minded an approach to a risk, thus missing important issues.

1.  Editor functionality mutates code

Kevin Lentin reports on an "extended vi" editor that has a CTRL/S command
which, if the cursor happens to be sitting on a number, decrements the number
by 1.  In a particular communication setup, CTRL/S was being used as XOFF and
also passed through to the editor, resulting in random mutations of code being
edited.  Mr. Lentin suggests that the fix is to be more careful about terminal
settings.

While this fixes the immediate problem, it ignores the underlying issue of
adaptation to the real world.  CTRL/Q and CTRL/S have been used for in-band
signalling as XON and XOFF for many years.  Using them as editing commands is
simply *very* poor design.  It's very poor because it's inherently dangerous:
There are too many ways to accidentally misconfigure an asynchronous terminal
connection so that XON and XOFF end up being passed to programs.  Further, in
the case of dial-up or network connections, the "proper" settings often have
to be made at so many intermediate systems, often systems with wildly
different interfaces, that errors are certain.

EMACS has always been the primary focus of this particular problem.  Its
designer has made it a point to bitch and moan about and generally refuse to
come to terms with any system that has the audacity not to deliver CTRL/Q and
CTRL/S.  Well, OK; that's fine for after-dinner conversation.  Safe software,
however, must adjust to the realities - and the realities for CTRL/Q and
CTRL/S are long established.

2.  UK ATM Spoof

Mich Kabay reports on an incident in London in which thieves stole an ATM
machine, repainted it, set it up in a shop, used it to gather card info and
PIN's, and eventually used those to steal some 240,000 pounds.  Mr. Kabay
comments that had the banks used smart cards and a challenge/response system,
this crime could not have occurred.

He's right, but for a different reason: Had banks waited for smart cards to be
practical before setting up ATM's, there would probably still be few if any
ATM's.  ATM's date back about 20 years by now, and it took a good ten of those
years from ATM's to become really widespread.  Smart cards are only just
becoming practical for mass use now.  They are still considerably more
expensive and fragile than the well-proven magnetic stripe card technology.

Meanwhile, the cost of conversion has inevitably mounted.  There's a huge
installed base of magnetic card readers, and a huge number of magnetic cards
in customer hands.  Conversion would be a very non-trivial task.

Should we as a society have waited before putting our trust in a technology
that has proved to be so easily abused?  A difficult question in general -
among technologists, there's always a push to just go ahead a build the
thing and see what happens.  In this particular case, I think you'd be hard
put to argue that waiting was called for.  What's ignored in just going ahead,
however, is that it inevitably raises the future costs of fixing the problems.

In practice, my bet is that we will *never* see the replacement of magnetic
stripe cards by smart cards.  Instead, we'll see improvements in stripe card
technology.  I saw a report not long ago about a technique that samples the
random noise on the magnetic stripe.  This noise is unique to a particular
card, is not changed by recording information on the stripe, and cannot be set
in a particular way by any known technique.  If, indeed, this technique is
practical - and the principle certainly appears sound - it would eliminate the
class of crime described here equally well.  (Curiously, a similar thing is
happening in the cellular phone arena, where the same kind of crime - the
theft of identification information for the purpose of faking a valid access
token - is being combated by analysis of the details of a phone's transmission
characteristics, which again appear to be unique to each unit, and not
forgeable.  There's a significant commonality here: These crimes are made
possible because in the digital world, "bits is bits".  Those of us who deal
with higher-level abstractions, where circuits really are binary - much less
those of us to whom the lowest level of abstraction is the software
architecture - easily lose sight of the fact that underlying our abstractions
is a physical world in which parts are not exactly interchangeable.  My
prediction: We'll see many more techniques based on looking "below" the
digital level in the years to come.)

3.  FIPS to be tied... [hashing, Capstone]

Peter Wayner notes that the recently discovered flaw in, and modification to,
the Secure Hash Algorithm "...proves the RISK of using a hardware based
standard."  It proves nothing of the sort.

	a.  Software isn't nearly as "soft" as people like to think.  There
	are still many systems out there running MSDOS Version 3.  Security
	bugs reported and patched years ago are still live in many Unix
	systems.  It's widely acknowledged that no fundamental change can be
	made in the UUCP algorithms or protocols, since many sites either
	would not, or simply could not, upgrade.

	The world of the individual programmer, ever ready to replace his
	copy of gcc with the latest and greatest release of yesterday morning,
	has little to do with the way most of the world works.

	b.  Hardware may be easier to change than software, if appropriately
	designed.  ROM updates are a common thing.

	c.  A ROM update blurs the line between software and hardware, but
	in practice any low-end implementation will have more of the 
        characteristics of hardware than of software, simply because the
        economics favor something that can be duplicated very quickly and
        cheaply - and that's either a specialized chip, or a general purpose
        CPU plus ROM.

	d.  In any case, the Secure Hash Algorithm isn't a hardware-based
	standard - whatever that means - to begin with!

If, as Mr. Wayner worries, SHA were found to have a significant problem after
it was in wide use - it really would make little difference *how* it had been
realized.  Software, ROM, custom hardware - updating a million instances of
*anything* is an immense problem.

The industrial first aid class that I was in had come to problems associated
with bones and joints.  The instructor was discussing bursitis, and was using
the example of carpet layers.  The tool used to stretch carpet is designed to
be "kicked" with the knee while the worker is kneeling and tacking the carpet
in place.  Because of the repeated blows to the knee joint, bursitis is a
fairly common result.  Once it sets in, the worker can only hope to get a new
job before the pain gets too bad.  Someone in the class wouldn't accept this,
and kept asking what could be done.  The instructor patiently kept explaining
that nothing could be done.  Finally, the student pulled out what she thought
was her trump card: what if the worker's whole *life* was carpet laying?
"Well," replied the long-suffering teacher, "I guess he'd die, then."
 
This was immediately recalled to me by the anecdote used to open this book. 
Some conditions are tragic and some are preventable.  The prevention, however,
may not always be within the control of the worker.
 
Still, this is an important book.  When you consider the possibly painful and
costly alternatives, "Zap" is probably well worth the price for any and every
computer user.  Home users may cavil, but they are the ones who probably have
the worst work setups and the most control over their environment.  Certainly
every large office should have a copy, although I suspect it will be used more
by staff than management, alas.
 
Given that the book's chapters cover not only body systems but also external
and environmental factors, it tends to seem a bit disjointed.  The jumps from
subject to subject are sometimes difficult.  It is, however, undoubtedly useful
in bringing together all manner of factors and problems into one place.  The
suggestions tend to be along the lines of common sense; relax; if something is
uncomfortable at first, it will get worse with repetition; keep moving, etc.;
but it is not to be despised on that account.  When the subject gets more
technical, as in the chapter on radiation, Sellers tends to waffle more.  (He
recommends a commercial monitor retrofit which can be accomplished more
effectively and for less money at home with a roll of tin foil.)  The resources
at the end of almost every chapter are helpful for further study in specific
areas.  There are, however, some odd gaps (such as the chapter on back pain). 
Hopefully, future editions of the book will add more contacts and information.
 
The book is written to the user.  This might seem an obvious audience, but it
is probably management who need more prodding here.  It is a pity that more
information is not directed towards the solid business advantages of an
"ergonomic" workplace.  In discussing chairs, for example, one could note that
the cheapest steno chair might be available for sixty dollars, whereas the most
expensive is ten times that much.  This might appear to be a substantial price
difference--until you consider that the cheapest receptionist costs twenty
times as much, per year, as the most costly chair.  If you get only five
percent more work out of someone with a better chair, you pay for the chair in
a year.
 
While there are gaps in this work, it is significant for bringing together a
number of health issues in one place.  For this reason, I highly recommend it
and look forward to improved editions in the future.  Give it to your computer
novice friend and it might just save his or her neck.  Or eyes.  Or hands ...

The following is summarized from an article in the _Detroit_Free_Press_, 
2 June 1994, pages A5-6.  The article was written by John Markoff of the New
York Times [and appeared on the front page of the Times on that day].

AT&amp;T Bell Labs researcher Matthew Blaze has been quietly circulating a report
among computer researches and federal agencies which demonstrates a flaw in
Clipper.  Using Blaze's technique, two parties can use Clipper to have a
conversation which could not be decrypted by government officials using the
proper escrowed keys.  The flaw would not permit third parties without the
escrowed keys to decrypt the conversation either; essentially, this technique
would reduce Clipper to the status of other commercially-available
cryptography which is computationally infeasible to break.

Stanford's Martin Hellman, who has reviewed Blaze's work, states "People who
want to work around Clipper will be able to do it."  In a written statement,
NSA directory of policy Michael Smith stated that Clipper would still remain
useful: "Anyone interested in circumventing law-enforcement access would most
likely choose simpler alternatives."  Smith claims that Blaze's technique
would be too difficult and time-consuming for practical use.

Comments: of course, this will probably re-ignite most of the Clipper
controversy again, since this seems to strike at the heart of NSA's purposes
in creating Clipper (secure cryptography with a mandatory back-door for the
government).  I'm more interested in NSA's statement that says in essence that
Clipper can be avoided more simply: perhaps this shows that Clipper won't be
all that useful after all?

The account of a collision with a sky-diver reminds me of an incident some
years ago when a commercial jet hit a salmon at altitude, which smashed
through the nose, demolished the co-pilot's rudder pedals and broke his leg,
ending against the rear bulkhead of the cockpit [the salmon, presumably,
not the rudder pedals or the leg].

The accident report assumed an eagle had dropped it.

In the 3 Jun 1994 Wall Street Journal there is an article about a Whitbread
sailboat race.  The story includes a description of how one team is accusing
one of its members of telling another team about the weather, which is
apparently against their rules.  The evidence for this is *computer logs of
faxes* sent between the individuals, who are also possibly romanticly linked.
(There may also be financial motives connected with boat sponsorship.)

Anyway, the risk to perpetrators in not covering their electronic trails
(tails?) is present even on a sailboat in the South Pacific.

There is the RISK of not double-checking dubious information, including
information in the Risks Digest.

I dialed 1-800-OPE-RATO[R] (I didn't dial that last R -- for "redundancy"),
and sure enough, I got a "(pong) AT&amp;T".

Then I dialed 1-800-OPE-RATE[R], and sure enough, I got . . . nothing.
Is there a regional discrepancy, or is the rumor of MCI's devious cunning
just an urban myth?

   [I got RINGING with NO ANSWER after 20 rings.  Maybe that is 
   exactly the point?  Ultimate denial of service, intended to
   make you want to go elsewhere when you think you are getting
   AT&amp;T?  PGN]

There were also several Risks Digest items about clever color copiers blocking
the reproduction of US and some foreign currencies.  This seems almost
impossible algorithmically, and indeed appears to be fictional, based on what
testing one can do legally.

   [We have gone around on that one in the past.  PGN]

What are the Risks here?  Just that people will go about spreading urban
myths, I guess.

	This appeared in rec.humor.funny.  I'm submitting it to RISKs because
nothing on the risks of faxing has appeared in a while.  The problems are that
there is often little way to ensure your fax is going to the correct place,
and that the faxed paper is out of your control once faxed, and might be
copied, and redistributed with your name &amp; private correspondence.

	Public-key encryption programs, such as PGP, would have allowed the
unfortunate applicant to encrypt this (as email).  If it was mail, he would
have to type the wrong address twice, once for the mail address, and also for
the encryption recipient.  He might have had a chance at getting the job.  (Of
course, using the phone would also have avoided the problem, but can be
inconvenient &amp; expensive when colleagues are overseas.)

&gt;    You might enjoy this.
&gt;    A candidate for the Director of our Research Center faxed a
&gt;    colleague to request a letter of recommendation.  It was
&gt;    accidentally faxed here instead. It read in part:

&gt;        "Iowa is too wet and droll.  But it's a directorship
&gt;        so I should apply..."

&gt;    The fax is now part of his permanent application file.

                   From the Concrete Interstate

              By Richard Sclove and Jeffrey Scheuer

     Vice President Gore envisions the information superhighway as the second
coming of the interstate highway system championed by his father, former U.S.
Senator Al Gore, a generation ago.  Let us hope that the junior Gore is proven
wrong.  Rush-hour traffic jams, gridlock, garish plastic-and-neon strips, high
fatality rates, air pollution, global warming, depletion of world oil
reserves--have we forgotten all of the interstate highway system's most
familiar consequences?

     It's not that Gore's analogy is wrong, only that his enthusiasm is
misplaced.  Comparing the electronic and asphalt highways is useful--but
mostly as a cautionary tale.  Building the new information infrastructure will
not entail the degree of immediate, physical disruption caused by the
interstate highway system.  But sweeping geographic relocations, and
accompanying social transformations, seem probable.  And the risk of inequity
in contriving and distributing electronic services--or, conversely, imposing
them where they are not wanted--is clear.

     Indeed, disparities in access to new information systems have already
begun to surface.  A study released this past week by a group of public
interest organizations, including the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People and the Center for Media Education, notes that low-income
and minority communities are underrepresented in U.S. telephone company's
initial plans for installing advanced communications networks.

     Unequal access is only the most obvious among many social repercussions
that may lie in store for us.  The real history of the interstate highway
system suggests how we can think about and control the vast implications of
new technologies and a new national public infrastructure.

     It is widely assumed that Americans' infatuation with cars led to the
construction of America's superhighways.  But actually when Congress passed
the Interstate Highway Act in 1956, car sales were slack, and there was no
popular clamor for building a new road system.  At the time only about half of
American families owned an automobile; everyone else depended on public
transportation.  Congress was responding to aggressive lobbying by auto makers
and road builders, plus realtors who saw profits in developing suburban
subdivisions.

     The act's key provisions included support for bringing freeways directly
into city centers and earmarking gasoline tax revenues for highway
construction.  As the interstate highways were built, city and suburban
development adapted to the quickening proliferation of autos.  Soon more
Americans found themselves forced to buy a car in order to be able to shop or
hold a job.  The Highway Trust Fund, by assuring the rapid atrophy of
competing public transit systems, bolstered this trend.

     Thus the asphalt highways--and the society around them--are a reflection
of successful lobbying by powerful business interests and external compulsion,
not simply the free choices of consumers.  There is no guarantee that the
process of wiring consumers and employees into the electronic highway system
will be different.

     The effects of the interstate highway system on American communities were
profound, especially in the cities.  As historian James Flink notes,
"Ambitious programs for building urban freeways resulted in the massive
destruction of once viable poor and minority neighborhoods."  In other cases,
new highways encircled poor neighborhoods, physically segregating minorities
into marginalized ghettos.

     Gradually, a black and Hispanic middle-class did emerge.  Its members too
fled along the interstate to the suburbs, further draining economic and
cultural resources from the inner city.  This contributed to the emergence of
a new social phenomenon: today's desperately deprived, urban underclass.

     Elsewhere the effects were subtler but still significant.  The noise and
danger from growing numbers of autos drove children's games out of the street,
and neighbors and families off their front porches.  Before long, suburbs
without sidewalks came to signal an unprecedented paucity of local
destinations worth walking to.  Suburban housewives found themselves leading
increasingly isolated daytime lives at home.

     Highways made shopping malls possible, enabling franchise and chain store
sales to boom.  But this sapped downtown centers.

For some teenagers and senior citizens, today's anonymous, consumption-mad
expanses provide a semblance of community space-- having swallowed up the
general store, the soda fountain, the Main Street sidewalk, and the town
square.  There is ample danger of the new electronic technology extending
these losses.

     Remember too that it is easy to romanticize new technology.  The popular
arts glorified life on the highway.  People read Jack Kerouac's "On the Road,"
watched "Route 66" on television, and recall the Merry Pranksters' psychedelic
bus-capades during the '60s.  In fusing alienation and rebellion with youthful
exuberance, each of these foreshadows contemporary cyberpunk culture.  Yet
real-life experience on the interstate is mostly banal and uneventful.
McDonald's, Pizza Hut, and Wal-Mart look about the same wherever you exit.

     There are also political ramifications of a vast new public
infrastructure.  Interstate highways contributed to national and even
international economic integration.  But while GNP soared, mom-and-pop
production and retailing declined.  That meant greater local dependence on
national and global market forces and on distant corporate
headquarters--powers that communities simply couldn't control.  The locus of
effective political intervention thus shifted toward more distant power
centers.  But because those are realms in which everyday citizens cannot be as
effectual as in smaller political settings, democracy was impaired.

     If the growth of the highways is revealing, so too is the opposition to
freeway construction that emerged.  As citizens became more politically
mobilized during the 1960's and early '70s, opposition to relentless highway
expansion arose from environmentalists and from local communities, both rich
and poor.

Transportation engineers reeled at the specter of upright citizens rejecting
their good works.  Many current telecommunications engineers and
true-believing entrepreneurs are no less convinced of the unalloyed
beneficence of their art.

     The importance of the analogy between the information and asphalt
highways lies in the political procedures that create them.  What if a wider
range of people, including non-car owners, had been involved in transportation
planning all along?  Considering the alternatives envisioned by critics such
as Lewis Mumford, it seems likely we would have a smaller and different road
system today.  As in Europe and Japan, there probably would have been greater
investment in public transit.  Modern America might exhibit less sprawl, less
dependence on foreign oil, and more cohesive urban neighborhoods.

     Three lessons for the construction of the information superhighway
suggest themselves:

     o _No Innovation Without Evaluation_: To help reduce adverse social
impact, the federal government should mandate evaluated social trials of
alternative electronic services.  Analogous to environmental impact
statements, these trials should precede full-scale deployment of any major
components of new information infrastructures.

     o _No Innovation Without Regulation_: We should conserve cultural space
for face-to-face social engagement, traditional forms of community life,
off-screen leisure activities and time spent in nature.  How about a modest
tax on electronic home shopping and consumer services, rebating the revenue to
support compensatory, local community-building initiatives?

     o _No Innovation Without Participation_: A number of European nations are
out-competing America in including lay people in technology decision-making.
For instance, the Danish government appoints panels of everyday citizens to
cross-examine a range of experts, deliberate among themselves and then publish
their own social assessments of technological alternatives.  Sweden, Norway
and Germany have pioneered processes for involving workers directly in
designing new production systems.

     The coming revolution in information systems is going to change life for
everyone--including the multitude who, by circumstance or choice, never use
computers.  It is imperative to develop mechanisms for involving all segments
of our society in designing, evaluating and governing these new systems.

     Data highway enthusiasts may see such measures as wasteful obstructions
of market forces.  But what entrepreneurs call red tape is really democracy in
action.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

From:  Philip Zimmermann, author of PGP
To:    People interested in PGP
Date:  28 May 94

On 24 May 1994, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology released
PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) version 2.6.  PGP is a software package
that encrypts electronic mail, using public key cryptography.  Over
the past three years, PGP has become the worldwide de facto standard
for email encryption.  PGP 2.6 is being published under the terms of
the RSAREF license from RSA Data Security, Inc (RSADSI).  This is a
significant milestone in PGP's legal development.

Export of this software from the US or Canada may be restricted by
the US Government.  PGP version 2.6 is being released through a
posting on a controlled FTP site maintained by MIT.  This site has
restrictions and limitations which have been used on other FTP sites
to comply with export control requirements with respect to other
encryption software such as Kerberos and software from RSA Data
Security, Inc.  These special mechanisms are intended to preclude
export of cryptographic software from the US.  The MIT FTP site that
carries PGP is net-dist.mit.edu, in the pub/PGP directory.

This new freeware version of PGP is for noncommercial use.  For
commercial use, you may get ViaCrypt PGP, available on a variety of
platforms.  ViaCrypt may be contacted at 602-944-0773, or via email
at <A HREF="mailto:viacrypt@acm.org">viacrypt@acm.org</A>.

PGP 2.6 is as strong as earlier versions.  It contains no back doors.
It can read messages, signatures, and keys from PGP versions 2.5,
2.4, 2.3a, and 2.3.  Beginning in September, a built-in software
timer will trigger PGP 2.6 to begin producing messages, signatures,
and keys that cannot be read by earlier versions of PGP.  It will
still retain its ability to read things from earlier versions after
that date, so that users who upgrade to 2.6 will not be
inconvenienced, particularly if everyone else upgrades by that time. 
The reason for the change in format is to grant RSADSI's request to
MIT to encourage all users to stop using older versions.  ViaCrypt's
new products will support the new formats used by PGP 2.6.  Details
of the compatibility issues and their reasons are outlined in the PGP
User's Guide, included in the release package.  See also the official
statements released by MIT for further details.

Version 2.6 also has some bug fixes and improvements of the version
2.5 released by MIT on 9 May 1994.  Both the 2.5 and 2.6 versions
were produced in a joint project between myself and MIT.  Both
versions were released by MIT after extensive review by MIT's
administration and their legal counsel.  I am told by MIT that MIT's
legal counsel believes that both versions 2.5 and 2.6 do not infringe
the RSA patents in any way, and they both comply with the terms of
the RSAREF licenses that each were released under.  But regardless of
the noninfringing nature of version 2.5, I urge all PGP users in the
US to upgrade to version 2.6, to help move toward eradication of
earlier, pre-RSAREF versions of PGP.  This will improve the overall
political and legal landscape surrounding PGP.  MIT will publish
details on the simple format change so that earlier European versions
of PGP may be independently upgraded by the Europeans.

This note does not attempt to answer all the questions you may have
about the implications of this new release of PGP.  For further
details, see the information released by MIT, or see the PGP User's
Guide in the new release package.

Subject: "The Hacker Crackdown" by Bruce Sterling

BKHKRCRK.RVW  940314
 
Bantam Books
1540 Broadway
New York, NY  10036
"The Hacker Crackdown", Sterling, 1992, 0-553-56370-X, U$5.99/C$7.50
 
It is important to keep in mind that the crackdown of the title refers to a
specific incident:  the series of raids in 1990 by various United States law
enforcement agencies which tend to be collectively, if incorrectly, subsumed
under the code name, "Operation Sundevil".  The book brings together a number
of the stories surrounding this event, as well as giving some background,
particularly in regard to AT&amp;T and the US Secret Service.  There are, however,
significant gaps which prevent it from being an overall analysis of either the
cracker/phone phreak culture or the data security/law enforcement community.
 
As an overview of the 1990 raids, the book is entertaining, often informative,
and generally well written.  Digressions often provide very interesting
background, although at times they consume entire chapters without much bearing
on the central issues.  Those who were around for the electronic discussions of
the 1990 raids will possibly be glad of the collection of all the stories into
one place.  (Those who have dealt with the crackers, phone phreaks and wannabes
will readily recognize some of the descriptions, as well as the repeated
emphasis on braggadocio as a primary character trait.)
 
Although Sterling is aware of the debate over the term "hacker"; indeed, he
worries over contributing to the degradation of the term; he does not
distinguish between the various communities of electronic outlaws.  In fact, he
states, at one point, that all are the same.  Similarly, his contacts with law
enforcement and data security people are limited.  For these reasons, the book
is not useful as a general introduction to the field.
 
The writing is highly opinionated.  The US-centric view of technology borders
on jingoism.  In general, neither law enforcement nor the cracking communities
are seen with any favour.  Although we can sympathize with Sterling's
motivation in wanting to bring to light the injustice done to his friend, the
extreme sarcasm which cloaks most of the first half of the book makes it
difficult to understand what point he is trying to make.
 
For those involved in data security, a very entertaining read.  For newcomers,
please take it with a very large grain of salt.

Our local newspaper, The Herald Times, had a several page spread on the
problems relating to a switchover of the local prison to a new control system.
Given the length of the spread, and considering that most of it was human
interest and not technical, I summarize it here.

The prison is being switched from a mechanical to a fully automated system,
and this is being done while it contains prisoners.  The jailers are
complaining about huge amounts of overtime, and spending the whole day "on a
dead run".

One incident of a technology breakdown was especially insightful.  The lights
are going to be controlled by this new system, and the wiring for the new
system must be run through some of the old wire traces.  In order to safely
install the new wiring, the existing wiring had to be disconnected, for both
the lights and an intercom system so that inmates can contact the guards for
requests.  To maintain functionality, temporary wiring was used to replace the
existing wiring for the lights.  To save money, no on-off switches were
included.  The prisoners must sleep with the lights on.

One of the prisoners has sued, requesting release because of cruel and unusual
punishment.  This has been rejected.

A more serious incident occurred with another prisoner.  A light had started
to burn out, but since it couldn't be turned off, it couldn't be changed, and
it started blinking rapidly.  One of the prisoners had epilepsy, and the
blinking light triggered a seizure.  The inmates injuries were exacerbated by
the other prisoners not being able to call for help.  Pounding on the cells
did no good, as this is a common sound in the prison.  A lawsuit is in
progress.

Another prisoner is now using this as grounds for his immediate release.  He
has a heart condition, and is claiming that this situation puts him too much
at risk.  No ruling yet.

I see one more lawsuit from this.  The best defence in a criminal case is
frequently delay.  I can see what may be a very valid comment from the a
defendent's lawer.  "I must request a continuance on the basis of temporary
incompetence of my client.  The county has been illegally depriving my client
of sleep, and he is now too sleepy of competently participate in his own
defence."  Under the right circumstances, I would say this might be worth
about a two-month delay.

I encourage everyone to have a look at an issue of the magazine "Campaigns 
and Elections".  It's a monthly, sold at many newsstands (in the US anyway),
for the people who run political campaigns.  Every issue includes numerous
references to the growing role of computers in campaigning.  Now I'm sure that
this trend has its good sides and its neutral sides and its complicated sides.
But inside the back cover of the May 1994 issue is an advertisement from a
political software company whose headline is "The age of individual targeting
is upon us".  In other words, everyone gets their own personalized direct-mail
pitch, based on a detailed database of information relevant to your likely
political leanings.  One use of such databases is basic demographics for
choosing issues to emphasize; another is deciding who should be approached
personally and urged to vote.

But a scarier use of such databases, not mentioned in the ad, is the tailoring
of messages to individual voters.  For example, a group of land developers 
in San Diego is promoting an initiative for tomorrow's primary election that
would open up the last parcel of wild land in San Diego to development.  Their
campaign has been incredibly sophisticated, including numerous tactics that
aren't relevant here.  The part that *is* relevant here is a letter I received
over the weekend encouraging me to vote Yes on the initiative.  Along with 
the letter were two inserts containing endorsements from the leader of the
local AFL-CIO and a Hispanic city council member from another district.  Did
the guy around the corner with the "Rush is Right" bumper sticker get the 
same inserts?  He didn't have to, if the developers had access to a suitably
"enriched" database.  In the future you won't even have to bother putting
together a coherent coalition; just find out what everybody's hot issues are
and make them all whatever promises you need to make, one by one, the Saturday
before the election, so nobody has time to compare notes.

&gt;From an article by Rebecca Bryant in the Los Angeles Times Valley
Section, Thursday May 19th:

The Los Angeles City library system is sending out overdue notices for books
that had been checked out before the January 17th earthquake.  The only
problem is that readers have been told that they can hang on to their books
until the damaged branches reopen.

"Now wait a minute," writes Bryant.  "Who[m] do you believe?  The library?
Or, uh, the library?"

The problem arose because the computer system used to generate the notices
does not allow notices to be selectively disabled based on the branch at which
the book was originally checked out.  The only way to stop the notices would
be to stop sending notices for all branches.  But many branches remain open,
and of course there are always delinquent readers.  According to Robert
Reagan, a library spokesman, the system is due to be replaced soon.  Although
the article does not state this explicitly, there is an implication that the
new system will support better per-branch control.

This is in many ways not just a computer risk.  The original programmers,
designing an integrated system, can be forgiven for failing to predict the day
when their customers would want to shut down only half of it, based on
unforeseen criteria.  Furthermore, it is easy to imagine an integrated manual
system with the same (if you will excuse the expression) fault.

Nevertheless, readers are confused and the library is embarrassed.  I guess
it's a pretty minor, though amusing, footnote to a major disaster.

RISKS readers might find John Seabrook's article in the June 6, 1994
issue of the New Yorker interesting. He had previously written a profile
of Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft (January 10, 1994) and received
an obscene and obnoxious message from "a technology writer who does a
column about personal computers for a major newspaper."

In true New Yorker tradition, Seabrook used this message as a vehicle to
comment on network etiquette and on the possibility that some strange aspects
of the message might indicate that the message contained a "worm" or "virus."
(My own reading of the evidence presented is that there is nothing to worry
about.)

Of particular interest to Risks readers might be Seabrook's fear that any
strangeness in the message might indicate an attack, and on the general way in
which extending the net to "an estimate twenty-three million users ... ten
million of which have come on-line in the last nine months" has affected the
culture of network communications.

RISKS readers -- at least those of us who have been around since the net was a
self-regulated anarchy -- will find his comments on the way this anarchy is,
or soon will be, dying away very interesting.

&gt;From a Canadian newspaper, _The Globe and Mail_, 28 May 1994, p. D1:

&lt;&lt;Stay out of the laundry room, son, your mother is playing Tetris: Computer
software houses want to know why grown women are transfixed by one particular
video game.  Psychologists have been hired.&gt;&gt;

by Jim Carlton of the Wall Street Journal

&lt;&lt;Nintendo Co., master peddler of cyberpuzzles to young boys, has a riddle of
its own: Why are so many grown women hooked on Tetris, the geometric video
game?  Fourteen-year-old Bobby Meade would certainly like to know.  "Almost 24
hours a day she plays Tetris," the Johnstown, Ohio boy writes of his mother in
a letter to Nintendo.  "I can't hardly play more than one game a day."  Peggy
Rudden's family would also like to know.  "My husband thinks I'm hooked on
it," says 46-year-old mother of six in Englewood, Colo., who plays in her
laundry room, away from the kids.&gt;&gt;

The author continues with the following key points:

&lt;&lt;begin summary&gt;&gt;

o Nintendo estimates that 40% of the purchasers of its handheld video game,
Game Boy, are women--twice the percentage of woman buyers of other game
machines. Nintendo guess that the difference may be due to the Tetris game
bundled into the Game Boy.

o Several anecdotes are presented about women who enter trance-like states as
they play the game.

o Seattle psychologist Barbara Mackoff works for Nintendo; she thinks that
busy women see Tetris as "a mind-soothing break."

o Gini Graham Scott is a sociologist from Oakland, CA who also works for
Nintendo. She wonders if "neatly aligning Tetris' falling clusters" is
peculiarly satisfying to women because of their "craving for order."

o Dr Scott also wonders if Tetris appeals to women's "holistic way of seeing
things."

o Dr Mackoff warns that playing compulsively with Game Boy can lead to
"driven, pleasureless participation that excludes socializing and other
creative forms of relaxation."

o One woman wrote to Nintendo in alarm because her mother, a 66-year-old
retired teacher, now spends an average of five hours a day playing Tetris.
Her reading has fallen from two books a week to two books a month.  Her mother
doesn't think there's anything wrong.

&lt;&lt;end of summary&gt;&gt;

[MK comments:

1) There is no convincing evidence provided in this article about the
supposedly different rates of addiction or compulsion to Tetris by men and by
women.  The article simply relates anecdotes and speculation.

2) Professor Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi of the University of Chicago has been
studying what he terms "autotelic" behaviour for many years.  Examples include
computer programming, rock-climbing, many competitive sports, running, making
models and so on.  The essential attributes of an autotelic activity are that
it is repetitive, is at the limits of one's skill, and provides many
opportunities for measuring progress or achievement.  When in the midst of an
autotelic activity, Prof. Csikszentmihalyi explains, one loses track of time
and even of normal body responses such as hunger or tiredness.

Programmers who have said to themselves (or their spouses), "Just one more
compile and then I'll come home" and then found themselves fourteen compiles
and three hours later have experienced what Csikszentmihalyi calls "Flow" (the
title of one of his recent books*).

Participating in this Forum, for example, is an autotelic activity.  I have to
consciously govern how often I log on to check on new messages.  Left to
uncontrolled impulse, I might end up online all the time--to the detriment of
the rest of my life and with severe consequences for my marriage (here my wife
concurs vigorously).

Computer games are analogous to any other kind of game.  However--and this is
sheer speculation--the combination of speed, colour, sounds and control may
make the games even more likely to cause Flow than mechanical games do.
Consider, for example, the attraction of mechanical pinball vs games with
marbles; or of a mechanical shooting gallery compared with a video gun game.
Another factor may increase addictiveness: computer-controlled games often
increase their difficulty as a function of the player's skill; this tendency
puts them in line with Csikszentmihalyi's ideas about Flow.

I wonder if the propensity for flaming is an expression of Flow?  Do people
provide a positive feedback loop simply by seeing their own expressions of
anger or dislike?  Devoid of other people's reactions while they write,
perhaps flamers reach a paroxysmal state of rage and bliss all by themselves.

Finally, the same phenomena may be part of the attraction of role playing
games, discussed in RISKS some months ago in connection with a young man who
became addicted to his fantasy world.]

    Failure to provide a reliable emergency exit is usually a violation of
local fire and other ordinances. The RISK is civil and criminal prosecution,
not MERELY lost sales.

    This, and many other seemingly senseless problems have at their root, a
failure of the analyst to IMAGINE HIMSELF using the system.  Sometimes this is
the fault of the analyst, often it is simply because management refused to
give the analyst (or the programmer) time to calmly "daydream" himself using
the system and encountering typical situations and problems.  If you cannot
imagine in your head what you are building, you RISK building trash, often
dangerous trash.

	Jerry Leichter suggests that ATMs be "hardened" to spoofery by reading
the "noise" built into the card during manufacture rather than the digital
signals encoded on them.

	The risk to this is once the scanner that detects the noise is out in
the field in large numbers, it becomes just another fixed system to spoof.

	Before you counter with "We'll just push down to the quantum level!"
consider if you'd want real people in the real world walking around with cards
depending on this. (And please no "Are you displeased to see me, or is that
just a quantum in your pocket?" jokes from the moderator.)

	Digitally secure smartcards are not only the geek thing to do, they're
the right thing to do.  As for the installed base of "dumb" cards, this can be
wiped clean by proper legislation or simple liability.  All that is needed is
to abolish the NSA and go back to being a free nation.

Perhaps Jerry has never been to France. All French credit cards are smart
cards, and have been in mass use for several years now. The French don't
seem to be having any problems with fragility or expense.

As to backward compatibility, this is solved by the extraordinarily simple
measure of allowing the card readers to deal with both smart cards and
ordinary magnetic stripe cards. Thus I can use my Visa card in France with 
no problem (the only difference is that there is no immediate validation
using my PIN as there is for smart cards).

&gt; In practice, my bet is that we will *never* see the replacement of magnetic
&gt; stripe cards by smart cards.

I think this is a little too pessimistic.

On Henry J. Cobb's fixed system to spoof:

We've been using pin-tumbler and mechanical combination locks for many, many
years.  In fact, that's exactly what protects the money actually stored inside
of ATM's - along with fairly simple electrical alarms, which haven't changed
much in many years either.  All "just another fixed system to spoof".

Clearly the only hope is "digitally secure smartcards", a technology that
has seen all of 20 years worth of development and testing in the real world,
against real attackers.  By all means, let's convert everything immediately.
After all, these new systems are based on *digital computers*!  Clearly they
are better, more secure!  Computers never make mistakes, after all!

On Mathew Lodge's response to my statement ("In practice, my bet is that we
will *never* see the replacement of magnetic stripe cards by smart cards."),
saying that he thinks this is "a little too pessimistic":

As Mark Twain said, it's a difference of opinion that gives us horse races.
(Well, he said it better, but I don't recall the exact words.)  We've both
made our predictions.  I'll sharpen mine: Five years from now, smart cards
will represent no more than 5% of the US market for bank and charge/debit
cards; some variation of magnetic stripe technology will make up essentially
all the remaining 95%.  Shall we revisit this in 1999?

In today's mail I got a glossy brochure extolling Clipper.  It
promises to "Expand your creative universe with real-world solutions."

Is it a new ploy by the government to subvert our privacy?  No, it's an
advertisement by a company named Dynamic Graphics for their CD-ROM clip art
magazine.  "Clipper" is their registered trademark.

I wonder if they registered the trademark recently?  I would have pitched the
flier immediately had I not noticed the word "Clipper" in large letters.  I
can't recall hearing about them before, either....  Has "Capstone" been
registered yet, or "Tessera"? :-) On the other hand, it might be they had the
name picked out over a year ago and their business will go south as a result
of recent events.

The risk?  Naming a product something catchy just before a government agency
nicknames something unpopular the same name.  (Alternatively, there's a risk
in trying to avoid this -- naming a product "Facist Thought Control" is likely
safe from collision, but won't help sales.  :-)

I have seen lots of discussion about the New York Times report on Matt Blaze's
discovery of a flaw in Clipper's key escrow system, with more confusion than
anything else. Here is the best article that I have seen on the net explaining
exactly what Dr. Blaze has found. There's also confusion about the
implications. My understanding is that this method might allow someone with a
Clipper chip device to have a secure communication with another person with a
Clipper device that could not be decrypted by law enforcement *and* it does
not require the cooperation of the second person.  That last part is what
makes this significant, since two people can agree to just encrypt their
messages with, say PGP, if they want to be secure from law enforcement
decryption. But if Blaze's method is practical, the widespread use of Clipper
would make it harder on law enforcement by making it easier than it is now for
someone to have secure communication with people without having to plan with
them to do so.

Many people have misconceptions about what Matt did.

Based on his paper (no, you can't have a copy since he told me not to
distribute it; I'm sure he'll release it when its ready for prime time) and
discussions with him, the trick is this.

[The Escrowed Encryption Standard is abbreviated as EES.]

The LEAF acts much as an key to tell the EES unit that it should
function. It contains three elements:

1) the 32 bit unit id of the EES unit generating the LEAF
2) the 80 bit session key, encrypted in the escrowed key for that unit.
3) a 16 bit checksum based on the unencrypted session key and the
   initialization vector (IV) for the session.

All three components are concatenated to form a 128 bit unit, which is
encrypted in the family key in order to produce the LEAF, reportedly using a
unique mode of Skipjack.

The remote unit takes in the LEAF, decrypts it with the family key, and checks
the cleartext session key and IV to see if they produce the proper 16 bit
checksum. If so, it accepts the LEAF and functions properly. Note that the
encrypted key inside the LEAF is useless to the remote EES since it doesn't
have the other EES's escrowed key. It has to rely on the cleartext session key
and IV alone to check that the checksum looks right.

Sadly for the NSA, the checksum is only 16 bits long. Given a session key and
initialization vector, I can fairly quickly generate a large number of fake
LEAFs (chosen at random) and find one that a captive EES unit will accept as
being the right LEAF for a given session key/IV. The contents of the LEAF will
be garbage, but the remote unit will not know that, and will happily go along
with using it. I needn't know the family key, or even the checksum algorithm.

The point here is, of course, that I can freely interoperate with non-rogue
EES units -- I can communicate with non-subverted units without revealing my
privates hidden beneath the LEAF. (sorry for the pun.) [*]

By the way, Matt had to figure out the components of the checksum on his own
-- the mechanism for calculating it and where it came from were not
documented.

BTW, for those who have asked, in case the preceding didn't make it clear,
can't you just reuse an old LEAF or a stolen LEAF because the session key/IV
won't correspond and the checksum won't be right -- you have to generate and
test.

Matt Blaze is the AT&amp;T researcher who has made the news recently for
discovering a flaw in the Clipper protocol. I saw an announcement from him
that a preliminary draft of his paper "Protocol Failure in the Escrowed
Encryption Standard" is available via anonymous ftp from resarch.att.com in
the file /dist/mab/eesproto.ps in PostScript format. He cautions that there
will be a final version of the paper which will likely include additional
material on the production version of the PCMCIA card, and that this draft is
based on his examination of a prototype card.

This has already gotten out of hand on the Usenet. In simplest terms, what
Matt Blaze found is that is is possible to spoof a CLIPPER LEAF (law
enforcement access field).

IMHO this is almost meaningless since *both* ends will need to do this (AFAIR
each side sends a LEAF. If only one LEAF is spoofed, it will just be 
necessary for a legal tapper to use the other one).

Thus to be effective, both ends will need special spoofing equipment and in
that case they might as well use something other than Clipper. Even better use
something different but prefix a valid Clipper LEAF. Right. Remember Occam's
Gillette.

Dr. Blase also mentioned that it would take about 20 minutes to come up with a
valid checksum. Much easier would simply be to record a valid LEAF from
another chip and use that.

The most important element is that the SKIPJACK algorithm is in no way
affected by this and is as strong as ever, only the government's ability to
use the LEAF may be compromised.

I still expect the government to drop key escrow when the hardware is ready
and that there will still be two means available to defeat Clipper available
to the government - without using any backdoor/trapdoor and without any
weakness in SKIPJACK (see my earlier postings - one is similar to the way GSM
can be tapped now).

Personally, I feel that Clipper is a valuable mid-range low-announced- cost
device that is "good enough for government work". PGP or triple DES used in
combination with Clipper is a viable next step up.

Although I doubt people will modify devices with hard-wired Clipper chips,
this is seems to be a very serious blow to Tessera (the government's PCMCIA
card with a Clipper chip).

Tessera has a standard programming interface that passes the programmer's
calls to the encryption card.  Any experienced assembly language programmer
could easily add "support" for Blaze's technique for bypassing the LEAF (Law
Enforcement Access Field) validation check.  This could be done transparently
and without significantly impacting performance.  It could also fix up the
side effects of the attack (e.g. the first block is bad in CBC mode, etc).
Under MSDOS this could be done with a TSR that would intercept calls to the
card directly, so it would work with all Tessera applications.  The same TSR
could also substitute pre-computed and/or brute-forced LEAFs for
interoperability with non-cheating users.

We were told that the reason for having escrowed keys and a secret algorithm
was to keep terrorists from having strong crypto.  Now the bad guys have
full-strength SkipJack, the public has a flawed "standard," and because the
algorithm is classified we can't look for other problems.  I'm also wondering
what's going on inside NSA -- DSS originally had alarmingly-small keys and has
been widely criticized, SHA was defective, and now this...

RISKS is about to enter its customary summer slowdown period, including the
next month or so during which I will have only sporadic net access.  Please
do not expect to get rapid response to your requests or frequent issues.
However, please keep the incisive contributions coming, and I will get to
them whenever possible.

I wish you all a peaceful and productive summer season.

As reported on BBC Radio, Wednesday 8 June 1994:

A train travelling through the Channel Tunnel from England to France, was
evacuated after an emergency light came on in the driver's cabin.  The
drivers of the 10 lorries [Amer: trucks (JC)] who were being carried on the
train were evacuated to the English end of the Tunnel, through the access
tunnel. This was the first emergency on the Channel Tunnel which officially
opened last month.

It turned out that the emergency was a false alarm.

The Worcester (MA) Telegram of Saturday, May 28, carries a front-page article
regarding "a mistake by the city Election Commission [which] nearly cost
[name deleted] his wife."

A week before, a city resident "opened his mail to find a computer-generated
census form from the city." Apparently, he didn't look at the form closely,
and when he handed it to his wife for her signature, she noticed the name of
the person living with him at the same address was not hers.

She had just returned from one of many extended visits with an out-of-town
daughter.

"'Who is this Beverly that's living with you?' his wife, Barbara demanded.
'Come on, Barbara ... nobody is living with me,' he shot back. 'Well, they
got it right here,' she countered, pointing to the name Beverly A. [different
last name] on the form. 'If I find out, I'm going to get a divorce.'"

After a call to the city Election Commission, he discovered that the presence
of the Other Woman is an error that may be attributed to the fact that he lives
in an apartment building for senior citizens, and the Other Woman lives in
another apartment in the same building.

A spokesman for the Election Commission said if the victim "crosses out the
incorrect information and mails the form back to City Hall, it will be
corrected in the computer."

The victim "says he has no intention of signing and sending in the erroneous
form - and if his name is removed from the voter registration list, which is
the penalty for failing to respond to the census, 'somebody else is going to
have a lot more trouble.'"

"'I'm not going to send it in. They make too many mistakes, and I'm not going
to rectify their mistakes,' he said. 'I can't see why people have to keep
paying for their mistakes all the time.'" He says this is the "last straw."

The RISKS? If the City Election commission relies solely on returned census
forms, accidental and intentional inaccuracies will remain. Given the current
economic climate in the NorthEast, it's not likely local government will verify
the information on every returned census form containing corrections.

Another risk is the perceived apathy on the part the public. If this fellow
refuses to correct and return the form, how is the Election Commission going
to correct the error? What if others follow his lead?

A third risk was mentioned by the Other Woman, who had not received a census
form this year: "The census form is supposed to be confidential, but went to
the wrong place."

Several perfect examples of software risks here.  First is running a security
mailing list with software that has security problems.  Then the ever popular
quick change to complicated software that generates unexpected (and annoying)
results.  Finally, there were the users sending messages complaining about
the duplicate messages to the list which were promptly forwarded to the list,
in triplicate.

&gt; Sorry.  I made some changes to the list code because of a serious

I'm currently involved in a software development project, writing software
to assist medical diagnosis of brain scans. Although I've ploughed through
abound 50 pages of documentation now, without actually coding a single line,
I decided it was time to whip up some "vapourware" snap shots of the screen
I was intending to use.

These I created in a paint program, and whisked off to the supervisor
for a critical review, etc.. Paper can only say so much..

The response I got was going as would be expected. Some suggestions for
layout, color schemes, font sizes, etc.. Until I got to section 6..

    ----
    5  yellow cross-hairs stand out better - is the red arrow for some
       reason?  Not apparent what (or if)

    6  not knowing what all the options were, I tried playing with a few.
       I certainly ended up with some images I did not expect.  I figured
       I should be able to get back to where I started by a judicious choice
       of operations.  Alas - not so judicious.  I certainly did not expect to
       get the text in mirror-image form, even if the picture was.
       I also thought 'normal' would redraw the original image, but this was
       not so.  Is there some easy option to get back to where you started?
    ----

I was quite taken back. I had only submitted a gif, but my supervisor was
suddenly telling me about all the "options" etc. Gollies, a GIF with a built
in OS independent GUI...

Turns out, the supervisor had been using "xv" to view the GIF, and had
accidentally clicked the right mouse button on the picture at some stage,
opening the "xv edit screen", and assumed that the new window was part of the
submission ,etc. (Gosh, that _IS_ overwork.)

The RISK ? Having a totally foreign program pretending to be mine, without
any intent. Was "xv" too user-friendly? Gollies, I was subsequently told that
if I hadn't questioned the response that it would have been assumed I was
working extra hard.. :)

We all had a good chuckle over it, and went back to work :)

   [Hmm, I suppose that someone is going to come along and refer to "xv"
   as the FIFTEEN program, which is NINE more than "vi", which is sometimes 
   mistakenly referred to as the SIX EDITOR (according to a sighting 
   reported to me by Caveh Jalali)!  PGN]

Regarding a recent RISKS posting of the article "THE GHOST IN THE MODEM" by
Richard Sclove and Jeffrey Scheuer of The Loka Institute, I fail to see how
the rather insightful analysis of the impacts of government meddling in favor
of highway-based transportation supports the conclusions:
 
&gt;      Three lessons for the construction of the information superhighway
&gt; suggest themselves:
&gt; 
&gt;      o _No Innovation Without Evaluation_: ... federal government should
&gt; mandate evaluated social trials ...
&gt; 
&gt;      o _No Innovation Without Regulation_: We should conserve cultural
&gt; space ...
&gt; ... modest tax on electronic home shopping and consumer services ...
&gt; 
&gt;      o _No Innovation Without Participation_: ... the Danish government
&gt; appoints panels of everyday citizens ...

These conclusions would lead us down the same road of the government using
regulatory and taxing powers to distort the application and development of
technology.  A common mistake is for people to observe or foresee a danger and
demand that government do something about it.  They fail to take into account
the risks involved in getting government involved, with its tax and regulation
sledgehammers.  This is appropriate when the dangers to be mitigated are great
enough, but is not something to be suggested lightly.  In many cases, people
may be better off accepting the risk of the danger than putting up with the
effects of government involvement.

The kind of preemptive government involvement advocated in this case is
particularly questionable, since the dangers aren't really known and premature
government meddling may actually make things worse (as the authors argue may
have happened in the case of transportation).

The proper solution is not to increase the number of modes, but to decrease
the number of modes--to ONE.

`Less advanced' aircraft, which I believe include Boeing aircraft, use their
sophisticated flight control systems to make the plane behave like a simple
plane with simple controls.  `Fly by wire', to their designers, means `make
the best, and best-behaved, simulation of a plane with direct linkage from
controls to control surfaces.'  `More advanced,' in Airbus case, means
`having a greater chance for error.'

This has been debated in the aircraft industry, but the FAA has not seen
fit to refuse certification to Airbus.  My own belief, unsupported by
professional qualification of any kind, is that this is a serious mistake,
perhaps unavoidable due to the political nature of the Airbus Consortium.

If I understand correctly, Airbus was forced to use these multimode control
systems because some of its aircraft use sidestick controllers.  Sidestick
controllers provide very little range of motion compared to the traditional
yoke (wheel on a moving stick/post), and the pilot effectively flies using
pressure rather than position of the sidestick.  This is fine during normal
flight, but during takeoff and landing the control surfaces must be moved
through large excursions, and the additional control modes are needed to
allow this.

There is another serious problem with the control mechanism described: the
autopilot used one set of control surfaces (stabilizer trim) while the
pilot continued to operate another (elevators).  In effect, the aircraft
and its inherent flight laws provide the summing of the control inputs.  For
such an arrangement to work at all, the summing process must remain linear,
must not interfere with the flight of the aircraft in other ways, etc.
Clearly, this did _not_ happen.  An unqualified person such as myself has to
wonder what happens when the stabilizer is canted one way and the elevator
is canted the other.  The result, it seems to me, should be excess drag and
a disrupted airflow, leading to reduction or loss of control response to
both inputs.

There is a third problem: the pilot has no indication through his controls
that the autopilot--in effect, the aircraft's control laws--are actively
working against him.  In an emergency, there are only two things he is
likely to pay attention to--the primary instruments and the controls
under his hands and feet.  If he were to put the plane to the edge of a
stall, either the natural buffet of the stall or an artificial stick-shaker
designed to simulate the buffet would alert him.  _That_ is probably the
proper place to inform the pilot that he is working the aircraft against
the edge.

I don't fly much, but if I find myself booked on an Airbus plane I will
look for an alternate booking.

Earlier I wrote re Clipper LEAF spoofing:

&gt;&gt; IMHO this is almost meaningless since *both* ends will need to do this
&gt;&gt; (AFAIR each side sends a LEAF. If only one LEAF is spoofed, it will
&gt;&gt; just be necessary for a legal tapper to use the other one).

and received the following correction:

&gt;According to a talk here at MIT given by two NSA mathematicians the
&gt;day the NYT broke the story (a happy coincidence :-), this is not
&gt;true.  Using Capstone/Tessera, only one LEAF is sent, by the
&gt;originating party.

I wrote:

&gt;&gt; Dr. Blase also mentioned that it would take about 20 minutes to come
&gt;&gt; up with a valid checksum. Much easier would simply be to record a
&gt;&gt; valid LEAF from another chip and use that.

and was again corrected:
&gt;Can't do that, as Perry said.  The LEAF is a function of the session
&gt;key, so it needs to be spoofed for each session.

What happens appears to be (after reading the draft of Dr. Blase's paper
but with some inference - any mistakes are mine) that the receiving 
Baltimore Clipper decodes the LEAF sent by the originator using the
family key, replaces the sender's unit-key-encrypted session key with its 
own clear session key, mixes in the originator's unit id (also in the LEAF), 
calculates a new checksum, and compares this with the one received.

The obvious implication is that what Dr. Blase was altering may not have 
necessarily been the checksum (IMHO it was the unit ID) but probably was 
the last sixteen bits of the LEAF. I leave the implications to those who have 
the good fortune to have received samples.

But then and again it is all moot since IMHO the gov (or at least the
Clips, Billary may not have been completely filled in) do not intend 
to use the LEAF anyway.

  &gt; it will just be necessary for a legal tapper to use the other

   As far as I am concerned, this is why the flaw Dr. Blase discovered is so
damning.  If the effect of an authorized wiretap on an EES phone is that the
correspondents [?] key is removed from escrow, this destroys the entire
purpose of the system.

   For example, a call in a mobile system would involve a chip in the phone,
and a chip in the base station.  If the result of a legal wiretap on a
LEAF-blower equipped mobile phone is that the keys of all the base stations
in the vicinity are turned over to the tappers, the escrow system protects no
one.

  &gt; Dr. Blase also mentioned that it would take about 20 minutes to
  &gt; come up with a valid checksum. Much easier would simply be to
  &gt; record a valid LEAF from another chip and use that.

    This is a double misapprehension.  First, the twenty minutes (divided by
the number of chips used) delay is only associated with some modes of use.
Second, the problem is not in collecting LEAFs, but in finding one that will
be accepted by your correspondent for THIS call.  In some cases that will be
doable in advance, in others it will be easy, and in a few cases it may have
to be done "the hard way" after the call has been initiated.

  &gt; The most important element is that the SKIPJACK algorithm is in no
  &gt; way affected by this and is as strong as ever, only the
  &gt; government's ability to use the LEAF may be compromised.

     Not quite true.  Being able to "peer through" the crypto protection is
usually the first step in a complete crack.  In this case it opens up
(actually makes more effective) avenues of attack, which while they seem
computationally infeasible today, may shorten the effective lifetime of the
EES system.

It's hard to have confidence in a book on data security that starts off with
two examples of "back doors" -- neither of which have the slightest connection
to back doors.  Then, there is the example of radiation risks which cites a
study probably more related to chemical exposure.  Do not lose heart, however. 
These are apparently aberrations in what is otherwise a very practical and
down-to-earth security manual.
 
That opening chapter on specific examples starts a section on risk analysis. 
Security mavens may find it lacking in rigour and overlong in verbiage, but
most micro/LAN/office managers have little formal training in the formal
aspects of data security and need the example after example approach.  The
questionnaires and quizzes probably drive the point home as well as, or better
than, Stang's love of charts.
 
Part two is a bit weaker.  It opens with a questionable chapter on the
"players" in the game:  data security versus the hackers.  There is a chapter
on the security aspects of network design.  Given Stang and Moon's background
in the NCSA the two virus chapters are no surprise, and generally good.
 
Part three gives more detail (*lots* of detail in the tabular reviews of
chapter 12) on security solutions, policies and products.  Not exhaustive:  the
password chapter, in looking at security *breaking* programs, makes no mention
of the HACK program for obtaining any passwords used over Ethernet or the KNOCK
program which exploits a bug in versions of NetWare which allows anyone to gain
SUPERVISOR access without passwords.  Still, there is much practical help for
the LAN manager here.
 
Part four looks at specific network operating systems and the security features
and functions thereof.  As well as comparisons of the different systems, there
are chapters collecting the security commands and concepts of each.  These are
handy, but not necessarily more so than the original documentation.  NetWare
"effective rights", for example, continue to bedevil LAN managers using
Novell's software.  All the parts are included here, but the calculation of
effective rights is not deal with.  (There is also one "oops".  The chapter on
UNIX security contains a description of the VMS "WANK" worm.)
 
Part five looks at ways to implement security.  An unusual, but very valuable,
section in the chapter on training is an extensive list of training available
in a variety of security related areas.  (Most of the virus courses seem to be
given by an outfit called Norman Data Defense Systems.  Oh well.)
 
Part six briefly describes the shareware files on the included disks.  A series
of appendices primarily give contact information.
 
It'll be difficult to get a busy LAN manager to sit still long enough to read
this.  But it'll be worth it.

  The Hacker Crackdown
  Preface to the Electronic Release of The Hacker Crackdown

  Out in the traditional world of print, The Hacker Crackdown  is ISBN
  0-553-08058-X, and is formally catalogued by the Library of Congress as "1.
  Computer crimes -- United States. 2. Telephone -- United States -- Corrupt
  practices. 3. Programming (Electronic computers) -- United States --
  Corrupt practices." `Corrupt practices,' I always get a kick out of that
  description. Librarians are very ingenious people.

  The paperback is ISBN 0-553-56370-X. If you go and buy a print version of
  The Hacker Crackdown, an action I encourage heartily, you may notice that
  in the front of the book, beneath the copyright notice -- "Copyright (C)
  1992 by Bruce Sterling" -- it has this little block of printed legal
  boilerplate from the publisher. It says, and I quote:

   "No part of this book may be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by
   any means, electronic or mechanical, including photocopying, recording, or
   by any information storage and retrieval system, without permission in
   writing from the publisher.  For information address: Bantam Books."

  This is a pretty good disclaimer, as such disclaimers go. I collect
  intellectual-property disclaimers, and I've seen dozens of them, and this
  one is at least pretty straightforward. In this narrow and particular case,
  however, it isn't quite accurate. Bantam Books puts that disclaimer on
  every book they publish, but Bantam Books does not, in fact, own the
  electronic rights to this book. I do, because of certain extensive contract
  maneuverings my agent and I went through before this book was written. I
  want to give those electronic publishing rights away through certain not-
  for-profit channels, and I've convinced Bantam that this is a good idea.

  Since Bantam has seen fit to peaceably agree to this scheme of mine, Bantam
  Books is not going to fuss about this. Provided you don't try to sell the
  book, they are not going to bother you for what you do with the electronic
  copy of this book. If you want to check this out personally, you can ask
  them; they're at 1540 Broadway NY NY 10036. However, if you were so foolish
  as to print this book and start retailing it for money in violation of my
  copyright and the commercial interests of Bantam Books, then Bantam, a part
  of the gigantic Bertelsmann multinational publishing combine, would roust
  some of their heavy-duty attorneys out of hibernation and crush you like a
  bug. This is only to be expected. I didn't write this book so that you could
  make money out of it. If anybody is gonna make money out of this book, it's
  gonna be me and my publisher.

  My publisher deserves to make money out of this book. Not only did the
  folks at Bantam Books commission me to write the book, and pay me a hefty
  sum to do so, but they bravely printed, in text, an electronic document the
  reproduction of which was once alleged to be a federal felony. Bantam Books
  and their numerous attorneys were very brave and forthright about this
  book. Furthermore, my former editor at Bantam Books, Betsy Mitchell,
  genuinely cared about this project, and worked hard on it, and had a lot of
  wise things to say about the manuscript. Betsy deserves genuine credit for
  this book, credit that editors too rarely get.  [...]

I just got a new 900 MHz telephone made by Bel-tronis.  Plastered all over it
is the fact that it "Styled by BRONDI, Italy".  I guess I should be impressed.

Well today I prepare to make a call on it to SouthWest Airlines
(1-800-I-FLY-SWA).  Guess what?  The phone does not have a "W" on it.

On the #9 key it has XYZ.  It is missing the "Q" though.

It kind of reminds me of the (sorry about the non-PC reference) Polish
joke of the day 555-POLZ.  Except it would not work on this phone.

&gt;From the Reuter newswire (94.06.10 @ 16:59) via Executive News Service (GO
ENS) on CompuServe:

  LOS ANGELES, June 10 (Reuter) - A former deputy police chief who is now a
  private detective has been accused of obtaining highly sensitive criminal
  records from his old department, a spokeswoman for the District Attorney's
  Office said Friday. 
     Spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said Daniel Sullivan, former deputy chief of
  the Los Angeles Police Department, was charged Thursday with 11 misdemeanor
  counts of being in possession of criminal records.

According to the article, Sullivan allegedly used an inside collaborator to get
the data.  The collaborator and another private detective who received
confidential police files were also charged with misdemeanors.  Some of the
stolen information concerned people in official witness-protection programs,
relocated to protect their lives.

A colleague (call him ZX) has just told me about how he voted in the 
recent European Elections, and I thought I would share it with you.

He realised that he didn't have his voting card with him, but went to vote
anyway.  The voting hall contains several tables, where you exchange your card
for a voting slip, and the usual booths / boxes etc.

The procedure:  Go to the table which is labelled with your street name,
hand over your card, and receive a voting slip.

ZX (with no card), went to the appropriate table, and explained that he
wanted to vote, but did not have his voting card with him.  The clerk
said ``Oh, that's OK -- which street do you live in?''.  ZX replied
[RISK area -- pick a street, any street, from the following...]
The clerk then looked up in his copy of the electoral register for
that street, and asked ZX for the number of the house he lived in.
[RISK area -- the names in the register were marked in a way that
indicates who has voted already]  ZX replied with his house number,
the clerk said ``Oh, you must be Mr X'', and handed ZX a ballot slip.

The obvious conclusion is that J. Random Voter can go to any polling
station, say he's left his voting card at home, give a street name
(supplied on the tables), pick the number of a house on that street
from which no one has voted (by reading the electoral roll copy),
and vote, without having had to produce any for of ID.

The RISKs here are even higher when you consider that approx only 30%
of the total electorate participated in this election....

Question: Should the UK update its voting system?

Here's another risk on the horizon.  We may have to wait a few
years, though.  From the June 1994 issue of Bobbin, "The premier
news and information source of the global sewn products industry":

     Groups such as the American Textile Partnership (AMTEX), a
     research consortium that links the sewn products industry with
     the Department of Energy's national laboratories, also are looking
     at RF technology as a means to improve the production process.  In a
     research project called the Embedded Electronic Fingerprint, long-term
     work is underway to develop a computer-type device the size of a grain
     of wheat that could be attached to a garment and used through the
     entire product life cycle.

     "A manufacturer could program into the device information unique to
     a garment, such as the size, color, style, line, or plant of
     manufacture, care instructions, etc.," explains Jud Early, director
     of research and development for the Textile/Clothing Technology
     Corp, [TC]**2.  "There also would be a large amount of blank memory
     that could be used for anti-counterfeit tracking and more."

     Since each tag would have a unique identity, in-process inventory
     could be tracked easily using RF units--without ever touching garments
     or having to open shipping boxes.  For example, a carton could be
     passed through a reading system, which would verify the contents
     against the packing list.

So, all that is needed is for the clerk at the store to capture the
identity of the shirt, perhaps through a barcode on the tag (so they
wouldn't have to install the special shirt readers), and they already
know your identity from your credit card number (unless someone else
buys your shirts for you), so they can track your movements by setting
up shirt readers in various places.

But that might take more collusion between government and the stores
than we want to speculate.  So try this: a crime is committed.  A few
days later, you walk past a hidden shirt reader, and are immediately
approached by an officer of the law, who arrests you for the crime.
"But I was nowhere near the scene of the crime," you protest.
"On the contrary," the officer counters, "one of our hidden shirt
readers detected you shirt in the vicinity of the crime.  You must
be guilty."

One would hope that the manufacturers of these devices don't accidentally
program duplicate serial numbers in them.  And you should think twice
about lending your shirt to your girlfriend.

Mark Terribile offered some interesting comments on Airbus aircraft
design. But some of his speculation is ill-founded, and should not
pass without comment.

&gt; If I understand correctly, Airbus was forced to use these multimode control
&gt; systems because some of its aircraft use sidestick controllers.
&gt; [...]
&gt; There is another serious problem with the control mechanism described:

This is confused.  His first comment refers to the Airbus A320
aircraft, which is the first `fly-by-wire' commercial transport.  His
second comment refers to the crash of a China Airlines A300 in Nagoya,
which is a different aircraft, with the usual mechanical and hydraulic
primary control systems and relatively limited use of computers. It
does not have sidestick control.

His speculation on the A320, that Airbus were forced to use modes
because they chose a sidestick design, is incorrect. Fly-by-wire
aircraft use modes because they have to. What toys you give the pilot
to convey her instructions to the computer is almost an independent
choice. If the plane is flown by computer, she doesn't need a large
lever to move the control surfaces.

&gt; There is another serious problem with the control mechanism described: the
&gt; autopilot used one set of control surfaces (stabilizer trim) while the
&gt; pilot continued to operate another (elevators).

This arrangement is used on more or less every transport aircraft
flying, as well as all tiny planes big enough to warrant a three-axis
autopilot. If this is a `serious problem', all aircraft have it.
(Also, the trim system is not primary control as the elevators are. It
serves a different function.)

&gt; There is a third problem: the pilot has no indication through his controls
&gt; that the autopilot--in effect, the aircraft's control laws--are actively
&gt; working against him.

This is false for the A300, as for most conventional transports. In
fact, the copilot who was flying had to work quite hard to counteract
the nose-up trim. This is one of the puzzles of the accident.

A further comment about the Nagoya accident is appropriate. Current
knowledge is that the pilots failed to follow normal, explicit
procedure for control of the aircraft, and secondly that they had both
been drinking alcohol, which is illegal for good reason.  Responsible
senior management of China Airlines has resigned because of this
accident.  The FAA has virtually insisted that China Airlines work
with it on improving safety procedures including crew training and
oversight.  Trying to draw conclusions about aircraft design from
details of this particular accident is probably unwise.

Those wary of fly-by-wire transport aircraft design might also like to
know that Boeing's next airplane, the 777, is full fly-by-wire - just
like the A320, but, of course, different.

re: Mark Terribile's posting:-

1) Boeing sell similar automation to the A320 - they also caused the second-
worst Japanese crash and in this case much more directly (the fuselage broke).

2) whether you se sidestick or yoke, a modern airliner has no direct "cables"
to the rudders - it relies on multiple links either electrical or hydraulic
which would work equally well with sidesticks. A300s have been around for 20
years - this was an A320.

3) This is one of three crashes involving a simple confusion that I remember -
the first Tri-Star crash (neither pilot had switched off the auto-pilot); the
Kegworth crash (on a BOEING - the pilot shut down the wrong engine when it
caught fire) and this one (the younger pilot didn't switch off the auto-pilot
and didn't relinquish control. I automatically think of my poor (fortunately
very quick-witted) gliding instructors when I read of this particular crash-
thank you for not letting me land on the crosswind runway, Barry Hogarth!.

4) as for mode-switching and elevators etc - the senior pilot seems to have
tried to recover without switching off the auto-pilot, the junior pilot seems
to have flown as if the auto-pilot wasn't on. Reports will not say this as
it's a conclusion, not a fact - it does however sound like the explanation.

5) Since several A320s have crashed when silly things have been happening,
perhaps the automation, like the "watertight" hull of the Titanic, is
creating a too-complacent pilot. As a far-too-complacent pilot myself in the
past, I can understand this.

I do not pretend any insight into the cause of the crash, all I can say is
that if Mark Terribile is basing his preferred flight on the logic presented
here, he won't fly at all.

One might predict that these will be common at first.  In the public's 
lexicon "False Alarm" might be replaced by "Channel Tunnel Syndrome" :-)

I had a first hand demonstration of a new road-side traffic monitoring system
here in the UK earlier this week.

I was driving into some road works on the M1 motorway and was slowing down
to take account of the 50m.p.h. speed limit which had been imposed.
Immediately (10 yards) after the speed limit sign was a bridge, and mounted
on this bridge was a camera.  On the other side of the bridge was a large
dot matrix display, which immediately flashed up the message:

	SPEEDING
	L123 ABC     
	 58 MPH

(actual registration number changed to protect the guilty).

RISKS: first of all, I'm expecting to get a warning about the consequences of
speeding in the mail.  (In the UK, the police usually won't give you a ticket
unless you're at least 10mph over the speed limit).  More importantly some
drivers might be surprised by this and cause an accident.

This technology starts to get real "big brother" overtones if it's used to
actually send out tickets (camera/radar systems which produce photographic
evidence of speeding are already in place, but human intervention is required
to actually send out the tickets).  And just how accurate is the character
recognition anyway?

There are indeed deep psychological forces that draw women to the game of
Tetris.  I've been a Tetris junky, and I can give my testament to the risks of
this particular addiction.  First, I admit that I am, by nature, susceptible.
I've been through several 12 step programs to rid myself of addictions in the
past: adventure, pacman, rogue, hack.  Yes, I've been there, and in several
other autotelic hells as well: elisp, C++, interrupt handler bugs, and more
recently I've been developing a WWW browsing problem.  It started in childhood
with a Revell model of a "car of the future" (lime-green with huge tailfins
and clear bubbles over the occupants in their bucket seats) and continued with
more plastic cars, battleships, airplanes, then those chests of little steel
girders, then calligraphy, ..., OK, OK, I'm autotelic, I'm a woman, and I'm
going to tell my Tetris tale.

First, let me establish my credentials as a Tetris hard-core.  I found it
while on vacation in Maui.  I dragged my family in our Aloha clothing to a
video games den every evening after we cleaned up from a day on the beach.
The clientele was young, local, kind of tough.  Ordinarily I'd feel
uncomfortable spending 5 minutes in such a place.  But with a stack of
quarters and a Tetris machine, I was transported.  The locals would sit behind
me sneering and asking if they could "PLEASE" use the machines.  At first, I'd
let them.

But things changed when we got back home to Los Angeles.  I found a
video parlor in Marina Del Rey with Tetris.  The clientele was even
more disturbing, but again, the game presented a world of its own.
One afternoon, a woman with two small children attempted to take the
machine away from me.  While I was concentrating on the play, she
informed me that her kids wanted to use the machine.  Without looking
up, I told her that I'd only yield if it was management policy to
impose a time limit.  After a moment of shock she began screaming
insults at me and dragged the children away.  Though I didn't ever
look up to see what kind of person she was, it did pretty much ruin my
timing for that level.  I got busy with various home and work
projects shortly after that, and I haven't played much since.

For a while I tried using xtetris on my workstation, but it wasn't the same.
And I've never actually used a GameBoy, because it's hard to get the little
kids to share them, and even if they do they won't let you play for more than
a few minutes before they start whining.  So I'm going to talk only about my
experiences with the big machines in the video arcades.

So what is it exactly that draws women to Tetris?  I think it's refrigerators.
At first I thought it was cabinets, but I've been over this in my mind a lot,
and I'm convinced that refrigerators are the key.  The sociologist who
mentioned women's "craving for order" seemed way off base, she'd obviously
never been within a mile of a teenage girl's room, but still, that's the key
to it.  Women spend a lot of time trying to get things into refrigerators.
The point is, they don't have a natural sense of order, but they've got to get
the damn stuff into the fridge so it doesn't fall out, and that requires
ingenuity.  Cabinets are similar, but they use different reasoning skills than
refrigerators.  For example, it's OK to push something to the back of a
cabinet and lose it for a year.  And things that go into cabinets nest ---
you've got to be careful with those graduated bowls if they're from different
sets, because if you put one inside the other you'll need a screwdriver and
pliers to get it out.

Now refrigerators and Tetris are much the same thing.  The Tetris shapes are
like Tupperware boxes and milk cartons and packages of cheese.  But unlike
real household items, they remain sparkling and attractive no matter how long
you leave them there.  And if you pack them very carefully along the bottom,
instead of rotting and giving off foul odors, they are conveniently whisked
away, while more continue falling.  This is sort of like having your husband
help unload the groceries --- there you are trying to get the vegetables
packed carefully into the bottom bins, and there he is stuffing soft drink
cans into the dairy products section.

As you move through the various difficulty levels of Tetris, it's even more
like a refrigerator --- you don't get to start with a clean space, but instead
have what looks like piles of debris from unknown previous users.  Women know
that these unseen entities are teenagers and you've got to be very resourceful
and controlled to work around them.

But what's the payoff in this contest?  Well, mainly it's being able to
exercise a skill that women already have, but with lots more positive feedback
than real life.  And for me, the video arcade games have two really important
features.  One is a cute little Slavic dance tune that plays in the background
and helps with the timing.  But the real clincher is that as you get proceed
through the difficulty levels, there's entertainment.  Little Russian men come
out onto the screen and dance in that style where they fold their arms and
bend their knees and kick straight out.  Yes, that's the real thing about
Tetris for some of us older ladies, it's the dancing men.  In all my years of
cleaning out the refrigerator, I've never had a man dance a jig for me.  Well,
that's why I play Tetris; I'm not sure about anyone else.

&gt;"'I'm not going to send it in. They make too many mistakes, and I'm not going
&gt;to rectify their mistakes,' he said. 'I can't see why people have to keep
&gt;paying for their mistakes all the time.'" He says this is the "last straw."

The RISKS?  If people place unreasonable trust and expectations on the
accuracy of computer information, they are bound to be disappointed.

Also, people quickly forget the advantages of using a particular system,
and zero in on the drawbacks.  Does this guy really want to stand in line
for 8 hours or so, like they do in non-computerized elections?

Finally, this illustrates the RISK of working for government institutions -
people are far more aggressive in dealing with government agencies --
they speak in terms of `rights', they make demands rather than requests.
The relationship is different from the company-customer framework - even
the most obnoxious individuals must be humoured.

One of our customers employees asked me to have a quick look at two security
packages for VMS that he was evaluating. The purpose of my quick look was to
determine if there where any obvious holes that these packages introduced or if
their auditing features where easily evaded. I spent less than a couple of
hours on each one (I wasn't getting paid just having a laugh :-)).

Package 1

This s/w had a facility for performing checksums on various files to enable
detection of tampering. I asked their representative what algorithm they used
for their checksum. All he would say was that it was proprietary. You would
expect 'proprietary' to mean that there was at least some thought behind it. I
found the algorithm to consist of summing the file as a contiguous set of
longwords and a recording of the modification date. Files could easily be fixed
up after modification! Why didn't they implement one of the many checksums
something like tripwire supports?

This s/w trapped AUDIT_SERVER messages via a mailbox. The protection on the
mailbox allowed read and write access to the world so that data could be read
out before the auditing s/w could get at it with a simple copy command. Fake
audits could also be introduced. This s/w had mechanisms for DCL command
procedures to take actions based on the audits passing parameters extracted
from the alarm data (evil grin).

Package 2

On looking what this s/w installed I spotted a privileged image that looked a
good target. Within 20 mins I had decided that I could probably use it to
obtain all privileges as an unprivileged user. After an hour or two of
programming I had done just that. In the end I exploited what I thought was the
quickest bug to use but this bit of code appeared to be teaming with problems.

Both of these packages looked very flash and professional from the outside.

Sad but true.

I remember reading about this in NETWORK WORLD.  It's kind of funny: MCI
already owned 1800 OPERATER long before AT&amp;T released 1800 OPERATOR (Which was
5 months after MCI released 1800 COLLECT).  MCI was using the OPERATER number
internally for something, but not collect calls.  They noticed after AT&amp;T
released their collect call product: 800 OPERATOR they were getting a lot of
calls from people who misdialed.  MCI was directing them to the correct
number or 800 COLLECT.  Due to the large number of calls MCI finally decided
to send 800 OPERATER to the 800 COLLECT system.  According the NETWORLD WORLD
article, MCI was making about $200K a month thanks to people with the 'Quayle'
syndrome.

&gt; ... All French credit cards are smart cards, and have been in mass use 
&gt; for several years now. The French don't seem to be having any problems 
&gt; with fragility or expense.

This is not quite so. One of the standard ways of defrauding the French
smartcard system is to destroy the chip, whether by stamping on it or by an
overvoltage.  This causes the terminal to revert to standin mode, which is
quite vulnerable.  Fraud was reduced slightly by the introduction of
smartcards - in France it is about 0.08%, against 0.2% for MasterCard and
0.1% for VISA - bit it has by no means been eliminated (source: `Cards
International' 22 July 1993).

Quite apart from fraud, the French card failure rate of 3% was the reason
why smartcards were not introduced in Belgium (source: `Cards International'
27th October 1993).

Also, there was a furore recently when French banks announced that all
merchants would have to move over to electronic terminals. This would have
cost over half a million small family businesses perhaps Ffr20,000 each, and
the main beneficiary would have been Bull - a struggling state-owned company
which was losing billions and being supported by the French government
(which seems to have been behind the move on terminals).

The risk? There are several - in not understanding the trade-off between
security and reliability, and in letting governments set security standards
before the technology is properly mature.

ABC's Nightline programs on June 9 &amp; 10 focussed on invasions of privacy that
are facilitated by computers and other electronic media.  The program mainly
covered things that we are familiar with but performed a valuable service, I
believe, by bringing some important privacy issues to the attention of the
general public in a fairly clear and direct way.

The program began with Ted Koppel presenting results of a public opinion poll
on two questions:

  Is the sale of records to mail order companies an invasion of privacy?
    YES - 73%  NO - 27%

  Are you concerned about threats to your privacy?
    YES - 85%  NO - 15%

Koppel went on to assert that the amount of personal information that is
available online is currently quadrupling each year.  An interview followed
with an information broker named Al Schweitzer, who they mentioned is
currently on probation for bribery in connection with information gathering.
They gave him names and social security numbers of a couple of people and he
showed that in less than 24 hours he could get a great deal of information
about them from legal sources, including their residential addresses going
back a number of years, the amounts of all outstanding loans and credit card
debts and terms of a divorce settlement.

Schweitzer could not resist mentioning that he could get additional
information, including detailed phone bills and lists of credit card purchases
through illicit but readily accessible channels and could get the person's
income through another such channel at a cost of $50.  He showed a list of
kinds of information, both legal and illegal, that are available and the
schedule of fees for these services.

There was a discussion of the fact that state and local governments sell a
great deal of information to direct marketers, including voter registration,
property owners lists, court records, and (in many states) motor vehicle and
drivers license registrations.  These agencies derive a great deal of income
from selling this information, which has assisted direct marketers to keep
track of 80 million Americans.  Thus they have a mutually beneficial
relationship, arguably at the expense of the public.

It was mentioned that Barbara Boxer's bill, which has passed the U.S.  Senate,
would restrict dissemination of information by all state departments of motor
vehicles.

They interviewed a "reformed hacker" named Ian Murphy who is now a security
consultant.  Murphy pointed out that all calls to 800 or 900 numbers make the
caller's phone number available and that with a computer and an available
database this can be mapped into the subscriber's name and address.  He also
discussed how it was possible to intercept a telephone conversation from a
specific cellular phone.  He noted that this is illegal but that it is almost
impossible to catch anyone who does it.  He concluded that "Laws can't keep up
with technology."

In a discussion of the Clipper Chip there was a short interview with John
Perry Barlow in which he remarked that with it "The government can sit in your
living room and hear everything you say."

A woman from Houston, Texas, named Carol Gibbs told her horror story about
having her credit usurped by another person and the fact that it has taken her
two years to get her life back together.

It was pointed out that even though it is now illegal to sell video rental
records, it is perfectly legal to sell personal medical records!

The second program concluded with a discussion between Koppel, Schweitzer,
Sally Katzen of the "Clinton Privacy Group" and Representative Ed Markey, who
discussed his proposed "Privacy Bill of Rights."  Markey said that this bill
would impose two requirements:

(1) That individuals must be given knowledge that information is being
    gathered about them electronically;

(2) Individuals must be given notice when information that has been
    gathered is proposed to for a use other than the one for which it
    was gathered.

Katzen mentioned that it has been over 20 years since the Code of Fair
Information Practices was developed and that technology has changed
substantially: in 1973-74 most records were paper-based but computer-based
records now dominate.  She asserted that the law has to catch up.

In parting it was mentioned that a representative of one of the "big three"
credit information houses had originally agreed to participate in the
discussion but decided not to come after learning who else would be there.

This is a Risk only fans of The Simpsons will appreciate:
(Paraphrased from New Haven Register Sunday, June 12, 1994 [With my comments!])

Northeast Utilities reported that it had failed to follow proper safety
procedures on 2 occasions in April at its Millstone 2 plant in Waterford.

On April 23, an indicator showed that some of the control rods were stuck.
The crew concluded that the problem must have been with the indicator and left
for the day.  When the new crew arrived, they discovered the rods were indeed
stuck but failed to shutdown the reactor as quickly as they should have and
underclassified the seriousness of the event.

(After a HOT day at work, everyone's _dying_ to get home)]

After the incident, some of the plant's operators failed a Northeast
Utilities test on reactor theory and were removed from duty for training.
The utility's report blamed the problem in part on the operators'
failure to understand reactor theory and a failure of plant
management to "fully appreciate the implications" of the safety-related
event and to provide sufficient oversight.

[sound clip of Homer: Dough!]
[sound clip of Mr. Burns: Excellent...]

The other incident involved a coolant leak from the plant's reactor.
In this case, the operators again underclassified the seriousness of
the event.  Notification of federal authorities was delayed by 16
hours.

[Guess they were just letting off a little steam after failing their tests...]

"Computer Ethics", Johnson, 1994, 0-13-290339-3
 
Unlike the famous quote about life in the state of nature being nasty, dull,
brutish and short, Johnson's examination of the state of ethics in computing is
readable, interesting, discerning--and short.
 
Unlike the usual treatment of ethics as proof by exhaustion, Johnson does a
complete and reasonable job.  Without recourse to mounds of collected work (of
dubious merit), the major points of professionalism, property rights, privacy,
crime, and responsibility are addressed.  Even in this brief space, ethics are
studied more rigorously than in more weighty tomes.  Not content with the usual
reliance on relativism and utilitarianism, Johnson points out the flaws in
each.
 
"Complete" is, I suppose, an overstatement.  Although it is difficult to
imagine a scenario that the book does not touch upon at some point, ultimately
this book is a good primer and discussion starter.  Although possibly the
definitive work in the field to date, it does not, in the final analysis, get
us much closer to a computer ethic.
 
Recommended.  Should be required reading for all computer science students. 
Exposure wouldn't hurt any number of professionals and executives, either.

Phil&gt; 1) Boeing sell similar automation to the A320 - they also caused
Phil&gt; the second- worst Japanese crash and in this case much more
Phil&gt; directly (the fuselage broke).

Not true--Boeing does not have any fly-by-wire aircraft in operational status.
They have flown precisely ONE fly-by-wire aircraft, the prototype 777.  And it
made its first flight last week.

Phil&gt; 2) whether you se sidestick or yoke, a modern airliner has no
Phil&gt; direct "cables" to the rudders - it relies on multiple links
Phil&gt; either electrical or hydraulic which would work equally well
Phil&gt; with sidesticks. A300s have been around for 20 years - this was an A320.

Not entirely true, as the Douglas DC-11 and DC-12 have cables that run from
the pilot controls (yoke and rudder) all the way back to the wing and tail,
for ailerons or elevators and rudders respectively.  The control surfaces are
hydraulically actuated, it's true, but most of the control run is cables.  I
think that the 747 also has similar cables.

Phil&gt; 5) Since several A320s have crashed when silly things have been
Phil&gt; happening, perhaps the automation, like the "watertight" hull of
Phil&gt; the Titanic, is creating a too-complacent pilot. As a
Phil&gt; far-too-complacent pilot myself in the past, I can understand this.

Well, no doubt, but wasn't this accident a 300, not a 320?  The 300 has a
conventional FCS, not fly-by-wire.  Just because they both start with 3's
doesn't make them the same aircraft.  That's like saying that an A-10 and a
KC-10 are identical because they both have 10 in the designator.

&gt;His speculation on the A320, that Airbus were forced to use modes
&gt;because they chose a sidestick design, is incorrect. Fly-by-wire
&gt;aircraft use modes because they have to. 

This is not true.  Early FBW aircraft were essentially open-loop analog
systems.  They were reactive, very simple, providing very simple feedback and
control loops.  They were not anywhere near as modal as modern systems.  Keep
in mind that Airbus' position is that fly-by-wire systems have to provide a
supermarket of user features.  In reality, the primary operational benefit is
to be simplicity and weight savings.  What a manufacturer does from that point
onwards is totally arbitrary and subject to market forces.

The Airbus design has long struck me as a being in support of an interface
which, in turn, was probably the result of a marketing decision.  Certainly,
the decision to use sidesticks--which provide no active feedback, and which 
are not interlinked--ran contrary to the preferences of many pilots.  The
lack of said characteristics has resulted in more modes (and the necessity
of protections) and a variety of rather impressive kludges (such as the 
"take-over" arrows which point to the other pilot when he pushes his "take-
over" button).

&gt;From what I've read of the Boeing 777 design, it's much less modal than
the Airbus design, providing unified and conventional flight characteristics
from takeoff roll through landing roll.

&gt;A further comment about the Nagoya accident is appropriate. Current
&gt;knowledge is that the pilots failed to follow normal, explicit
&gt;procedure for control of the aircraft, 

Really?  I've not seen that anywhere.  "Explicit" suggests that the systems'
characteristics were clear and well-understood.  Such is not the case here.
In fact, given that Airbus control philosophies tend to be rather subtle
in their feedback and invocation procedures, I'd certainly not suggest
that "pilot error" was a likely or trivial error in this case, at least not 
at this point.

&gt;and secondly that they had both
&gt;been drinking alcohol, which is illegal for good reason.  

This has also not been substantiated.  The investigators will not comment,
and it is not clear whether the presence of alcohol in the corpses was a 
result of ingestion or decomposition of tissues.  In any event, the 
*presence* of alcohol is not illegal.  The illegality is determined by
the *amount* of alcohol present.

&gt;senior management of China Airlines has resigned because of this accident.  

Because of the fifth major accident in as many years, was the way I understood
it.

&gt; re: Mark Terribile's posting:-

I do not understand this paragraph.  To the naive reader, it could appear
that you're claiming a Boeing automation issue was responsible for the struc-
tural failure of an airplane.  This is clearly false.

Nor was the JAL crash the simple result of structural failure: it was
primarily the result of a faulty repair, which destroyed the tail, taking
the airplane's hydraulic systems along with it.

Moreover, Boeing automation is significantly different from AI automation,
from the ground up.  The 777 flight control system (assuming you're referring
to flight control systems) uses a different machine architecture and has a
fundamentally different mission requirement, governed by the use of a
different interface.

If you're referring to more conventional functions, such as cockpit auto-
mation and the navigation systems, again, Boeing philosophy is demonstrably
different from Airbus philosophy.  It's debatable whether either is "better,"
but to even a casual observer, they are sufficiently different to cause
at least a few customers to scratch their heads when it comes to running
fleets with airplanes from multiple vendors.  In many cases, the differences
are not trivial.

&gt; 2) whether you use sidestick or yoke, a modern airliner has no direct 
&gt; "cables" to the rudders - it relies on multiple links either electrical or 
&gt; hydraulic which would work equally well with sidesticks. 

In point of fact, the hydraulic actuators are controlled via cables.  And
in a few airplanes (727, DC-9 derivatives) the pilots still retain aircraft
control via control tabs in the event of complete hydraulic failure.

&gt; 4) as for mode-switching and elevators etc - the senior pilot seems to have
&gt; tried to recover without switching off the auto-pilot, the junior pilot seems
&gt; to have flown as if the auto-pilot wasn't on. Reports will not say this as
&gt; it's a conclusion, not a fact - it does however sound like the explanation.

And reports also claim a 15-year-old boy crashed an A310-600 when he nudged
against the control column.  Hmm.  I wonder why two airline pilots couldn't
figure THAT one out.

After a mail from Peter Ladkin I am now sure of my ground and wish to write
what I wanted to write in the first place - despite your correspondent (and a
newspaper report I unfortunately used to check my memory, not my Independent
or Peter Ladkin's Herald Tribune which got it right), the worst crash in Japan
was AN A300 (ie an "old", un-computerised type NOT with sidesticks).

The Taiwanese plane did not crash after any kind of automation or airframe
failure, but when the auto-pilot was left on until too late.  Peter Ladkin
tells me that the president of the airline resigned after the crash, so it
doesn't sound as if they are trying to transfer responsibility to the
manufacturers.

The crash at Nagoya was not like Japan's second-worst disaster when a Super
747 (high-altitude model) crashed when the pressure bulkhead at the rear
collapsed; on that occasion the makers were Boeing, however I leave
accusations to lawyers -- there are plenty of these around and I may have
flown on one (and lived :-) ).    [lawyers?] 

I could have phrased it better, but I would point out that Boeing also now use
fly-by-wire (on the brand new 777), so the earlier correspondent was misguided
in thinking that Boeing were staying away from fly-by-wire. The 777 is also a
much bigger plane than the A320...

The average persons response to all of the A3?? technical discussion would
probably be that it frankly it does not matter why these planes crash!.  To
me, if we play only on the statistics, I want a airplane with a good safety
record.  Already, Airbus Industry has lost more planes per delivered plane
than other major aircraft manufacturer in the past 3 decades (Lockheed,
Boeing, MD).  To the average person, who for example reads in Consumer Reports
that XYZ product can burst into flames after extended use, does not care why!.
The same is true for airline equipment.

It is also reassuring to note that some committee decided (or individual)
decided that an A320 does not think it has landed until the wheels
spin up to something like 90 kts.  How reassuring to think that all of
the possible consequences of this decision have been carefully thought
out and that a full fault-effect analysis has been performed.

Andy Cunningham mentions some possible risks of over-zealous speed
enforcement, with (presumably) a radar gun linked to a video camera and some
automatic licence-plate recognition software.

Such a system was until last year under test in New Jersey.  A law was then
passed banning it after it was found that there was no way to let people off
after they had been ticketed, so that politicians, off-duty police officers
and other members of the nomenklatura would then have to conform to the same
rules of the road as the rest of the populace. I guess the risk here is that
of trying to apply rules to people they obviously weren't meant for!
Designers take note - you always have to leave *some* way to circumvent the
system :-)

I should note that in the U.S. speeding tickets are frequently (many
would say primarily) used to generate revenue, rather than for
any considerations of safety or traffic management.

On the other hand, I understand that photo-radar systems work in the
infra-red. This is preferable to an experience I had some years ago while
driving late at night at high speed on an autoroute in Belgium - I drove under
a bridge and was dazzled by a *powerful* flash going off behind me. Now
there's an unexpected risk of driving too fast...

The UK is not alone in their lack of voting security.

In Canada, as "proof of identification" all we had to do to identify 
ourselves at the registration station was to bring an envelope mailed
to our address (with our name on it) with a second piece of identification.

Sounds straightforward... The people are nice and accommodating too: A
roommate of mine couldn't make it to the registration, so we were able to
register for him *very* easily.

Given the (lack of) care being put into actually checking the
identification (to test this, I deliberately didn't show them the address
on my envelope, I merely waved it at him, and that was sufficient)
literally anyone could have registered to vote.

The registration process was optimized for speed (we had to wait 30-40
mins) and for friendliness, (they were very willing to accept my word at
face value) but no REAL effort was made to authenticate the participants.

In the two towns I've lived in here in Massachusetts, they have a similar 
voting system to that mentioned in England, except that no voter card is 
required.  They ask for a street address and a house number, but anyone 
who can read upside down could simply pick a name out of a hat.  

The risks to the would-be fraudulent voter is that even in our relatively 
large town of 25,000 people there is a decent chance that the person 
behind the counter knows the person you are naming, or that the person 
will later attempt to vote and uncover the fraud (not that there's much 
that could be done about it at that point).

The news media, in covering questionable elections around the world, often
speak of "massive election fraud".  It seems to me that since massive fraud is
really the only kind that has any predictable benefit, spoofing the
blue-haired volunteers behind the desk is not really all that much of a worry.

This is not uncommon - I did exactly the same thing. Admittedly there
is a RISK, but you also have to consider cultural factors. Accusations
of ballot-rigging in UK elections are rare. If someone picked an
address at random and voted as a resident there, as suggested, then
there would be major investigations &amp; lots of publicity when the real
voter turned up with a valid poll card. Yet this does not happen.
There is no culture of ballot-rigging in the UK (except long ago
in Northern Ireland, but that was done a different way).

&gt; Question: Should the UK update its voting system? 

Answer: No.

Actually, at least, in Northern Ireland, the election procedure has been
tightened: because there is a real, as opposed to theoretical, problem with
impersonation (vote early, vote often) they insist that you now have to have
some form of ID with you (or at least did, I haven't voted there for some
years, but I don't imagine that it has changed). Traditionally, polling
stations in Britain have someone local who is familar with the people of the
area, a doctor or vicar or something, around as an informal check for
impersonation (this would probably work better in rural, than urban areas
though).

I don't think there is much of a problem really, with the UK procedure.  If
they need to be careful (like in NI) they can make things much better, just by
always asking for ID, or to see the registration card.  But since they don't
actually need to at the moment, why bother.  After all, a problem with voter
impersonation would be obvious if it happened on any sort of scale and if it
does happen there are separate procedures for dealing with it.

There is the risk here of fixing something that is not obviously broken,
by assuming a purely theoretical worst case.

Subject: Re: Risks in UK Election Voting Process (Rushton, RISKS 16-14)

Thomas Rushton is correct to identify this problem (of getting names from the
electoral roll. There are two points to make.

1) You don't need ID to vote in the UK. Instead you must satisfactorily 
answer two "statutory questions" having given the name and address:
   a) Are you XY, resident at (address)       (yes)
   b) Have you already voted in this election  (no)

2) The problem is worst in the case where the "real" turnout is low, because
it would be possible, in disguise, to vote several times under different names.
However, in a high turnout election, it's more likely that the person whose ID
you have used will turn up to vote. They are *not* denied a vote.

If you turn up at the polling station, and give your name, and it's already
marked on the register, then you will be asked the questions, and given a 
different colour of ballot paper, which you complete in the same way. If the
final result is close enough for these papers to matter, then the election may
have to be resolved in court.

I agree that for low-turnout elections there is a problem with the system.
This strikes me as a common risk in any democratic system: if you don't use
your influence, someone else will.

                 ENCRYPTION POLICY ENDANGERS U.S. 
              COMPETITIVENESS IN GLOBAL MARKETPLACE
  
  
       For some time now, a debate has been raging in the media 
  and in the halls of Congress over the Administration's 
  intention to require U.S. corporations to use and market the 
  Clipper Chip, an encryption device developed in secret by the 
  National Security Agency.
  
       The Clipper Chip will provide industry and others with 
  the ability to encode telephone and computer communications.  
  The use of the Clipper Chip as the U.S. encryption standard 
  is a concept promoted by both the intelligence and law 
  enforcement communities because it is designed with a back 
  door to make it relatively easy for these agencies to listen 
  in on these communications.
  
       The law enforcement and intelligence communities have a 
  legitimate concern that advances in technology will make 
  their jobs more difficult.  But the issue here is whether 
  attempts to restrict the development, use and export of 
  encryption amounts to closing the barn door after the horse 
  has already escaped.
  
       The notion that we can limit encryption is just plain 
  fanciful.  Encryption technology is available worldwide -- 
  and will become more available as time goes on.
  
       First, generally available software with encryption 
  capabilities is sold within the U.S. at thousands of retail 
  outlets, by mail, even, over the phone.  These programs may 
  be transferred abroad in minutes by anyone using a public 
  telephone line and a computer modem.
  
       Second, it is estimated that over 200 products from  
  some 22 countries -- including Great Britain, France, 
  Germany, Russia, Japan, India, and South Africa -- use some 
  form of the encryption that the Government currently 
  prohibits U.S. companies from exporting.  According to the 
  May 16, 1994 issue of _Fortune_, not only are U.S. companies 
  willing to purchase foreign encryption devices, American 
  producers of encrypted software are also moving production 
  overseas to escape the current export controls.
  
       Third, encryption techniques and technology are well 
  understood throughout the world.  Encryption is routinely 
  taught in computer science programs.  Text books explain the 
  underlying encryption technology.  International 
  organizations have published protocols for implementing high 
  level encryption.  Actual implementations of encryption -- 
  programs ready to use by even computer novices -- are on the 
  Internet.
  
       The only result of continued U.S. export controls is   
  to threaten the continued preeminence of America's computer 
  software and hardware companies in world markets.  These 
  restrictive policies jeopardize the health of American 
  companies, and the jobs and revenues they generate.
  
       I support, therefore, the immediate revision of current 
  export controls over encryption devices to comport with the 
  reality of worldwide encryption availability.
  
       I believe law enforcement and the intelligence community 
  would be better served by finding real, and targeted ways to 
  deal with international terrorists and criminals rather than 
  promoting scattershot policies, which restrict American 
  industries' ability to design, produce and market technology.
  
       Now -- more than ever -- we cannot afford to harm our 
  economic competitiveness and justify it in the name of 
  national security.

The 15 Jun 1994 Wall St. Journal has an interesting front-page article about
how RFI generated by radios &amp; cellphones is screwing up operation of sensitive
medical equipment such as heart defibrillators, diagnostic equipment, and even
electric wheelchairs.

Some of the horror stories sound apocryphal, like the electric wheelchair
"zapped by radio waves" that sent it's passenger over a cliff.  Others sound
entirely possible: a 72 year old man died in an ambulance when the heart
defib. device he was on failed due to RFI from the ambulance two-way radio.
The ambulance mfgr. had replaced the steel roof with a fiberglass dome, and
put the antenna on top (duhhhhh).  The best story however was about some poor
sap who had a pacemaker installed after diagnostic equipment indicated he
needed one.  It was later discovered the diagnosis was in error, and was
caused by RFI from a television in the same room.  Runners up for best story
were from the mother who's use of a cellphone in the car affected the
ventilator her child was using in the back seat.  In a hospital ward a whole
bunch of ventilators alarmed when the handyman keyed his transceiver.

As is demonstrated by the TV case, even having technicians install and test
new equipment can't account for the fact that just moving the stuff around
during a spring cleaning might put two pieces in juxtaposition to cause
problems.

Having recently seen more than my share of medical equipment, I'm solely
unimpressed with the ruggedness of it (it sort of reminds me of ICOM radios).
Still, with more and more people using cellphones I figure we'll have more and
more problems.  I wonder if cellphones will be the health hazard in the '90's
that radium watch dials were in the '40's?

Given the interest in RISKS on computers in aviation, and some confusion
concerning characteristics of Airbus aircraft, I thought it might be useful to
summarise for RISKS readers some of the current state of things.

I believe there have been three major accidents involving Airbus aircraft in
the last year: an A320 ran off the end of the runway in Warsaw in September
1993, killing two people and injuring many; the crew of an Aeroflot Airbus
A310 lost control during cruise flight, which led to the death of everyone on
board; and a China Airlines A300 crashed recently tail-first (!) on landing at
Nagoya, killing all or almost all on board.

The A300 and A310 aircraft have `conventional' control, that is, physical
control of the aircraft is transmitted by mechanical or hydraulic means to
most of the flight control surfaces. The normal flight control of the Airbus
A320, A321, A330 and A340 aircraft, in contrast, is achieved by computer, to
which the pilots' sidestick movements are one set of inputs. This is
colloquially known as `fly-by-wire'. `Fly-by-wire' aircraft have been in
regular use by the military for over 20 years, but the A320 is the first
commercial `fly-by-wire' transport, introduced in the early 90's. Pilots have
extremely limited direct physical control of A320/21/30/40 aircraft should the
flight control computers be unavailable, a situation which is anticipated not
to occur during the lifetime of the fleet.

The first flight of the Boeing 777 took place on Sunday 12 June, 1994.  The
B777 is Boeing's first `fly-by-wire' commercial transport, which it is hoped
will be `certificated' in April 95 with delivery to its first customer, United
Airlines, in May 95.

The B777 is a significantly different design from the A320, and I would be
very surprised if there were to be any accidents attributable to features
common to A320/21/30/40 and B777 aircraft which are not also common features
of conventional aircraft such as the B737.

Airbus claims its design philosophy is `evolutionary', that is, the systems
are not designed from scratch, but introduced gradually into the company's
designs after success in previous designs. Nevertheless, there are steps, such
as that to `fly-by-wire' in the A320, which RISKS readers may consider more
significant than others. See the article by J.P. Potocki de Montalk, Head of
Airbus Cockpit/Avionic Engineering at Airbus, in Microprocessors and
Microsystems 17(1).

A useful and readable reference for those interested in A320 accidents is
RISKS contributor Peter Mellor's long paper `CAD: Computer-Aided Disaster!'
which contains a description of the design of the A320 Electrical Flight
Control System, and detailed commentary on all A320 accidents to date, and is
to my knowledge the only single source to do so.  A version of this paper is
to appear in High Integrity Systems journal.

Apart from the flight control on A320/321/330/440s and B777s, there are
potentially RISKy computer-based systems on almost all modern transport
aircraft, of which maybe the most important are the autopilot/Flight-Director
and the FADEC (Full-Authority Digital Engine Control). All commercial aircraft
have autopilots of various degrees of sophistication (and most have Flight
Directors, which provide passive guidance rather than active control), and
these may be suspect in certain incidents (e.g.  the Collins autopilots on
B757 and B767 aircraft: see PGN in <A HREF="/Risks/15.08.html">RISKS-15.08</A>, and my posting in
<A HREF="/Risks/15.13.html">RISKS-15.13</A>).  Many modern aircraft also have FADEC, which has occasionally
come under investigation, but I can't think of occasions so far on which they
have been considered primary cause of accidents or incidents.

Human factors are very important. A taskforce has recently been convened to
study incidents of `controlled flight into terrain', in which the continued
safe flight of the aircraft is impeded by a cloud with a crunchy center (see
The Economist, June 4-10 1994, p92). In these accidents the physical
performance of the airplane is generally not a factor, but they may
nevertheless be computer-related, since guidance and air traffic control
relies on computers to various degrees.

Aircraft accidents are amongst the most well-studied of failures in any
engineering discipline. I have never held any position in the aviation
industry, but some of my research interests and hobbies bring me there.  My
continuing experience is that it pays to try to take as much care in forming
opinions about them as it does to report them accurately in the first place. I
wish I could be better at both.

Subject:  Correction of my post on "A-THREE-HUNDRED" crash at Nagoya
&gt; 
&gt; The Taiwanese plane did not crash after any kind of automation or airframe
&gt; failure, but when the auto-pilot was left on until too late. 

This is not clear.  There are normally three or four ways to disengage any
autopilot:
	- a switch on the glareshield.
	- a deactivate switch on the yoke
	- pushing or pulling forcefully on the yoke
	- a circuit breaker as a last resort

In this case, it appears the crew were aware of the problem for over TWO 
MINUTES--an eternity--and fought the airplane to the ground.  I refuse to 
see this trivially dismissed as "operator error" or "they didn't turn off 
the autopilot until it was too late."  

This is a horrifying situation, and if there is a mechanical or interface or 
modal failure lurking beneath the scenes, it needs to be rectified.  AND
UNDERSTOOD: if it's even as simple as a service or maintenance issue, then the 
problem could recur on other airplanes.


&gt; Peter Ladkin tells me that the president of the airline resigned after the 
&gt; crash, so it doesn't sound as if they are trying to transfer responsibility
&gt; to the manufacturers.

Again, after a long string of crashes.  I believe the president or VP of
JAL was ultimately compelled to resign after the 747 SR crash in Japan.
This has nothing to do with culpability: it's accountability.  A form of
personal responsibility which seems to be quite absent in Western 
corporate culture.  There is nothing more one can draw from it than that.

&gt;I could have phrased it better, but I would point out that Boeing also now use
&gt;fly-by-wire (on the brand new 777), so the earlier correspondent was misguided
&gt;in thinking that Boeing were staying away from fly-by-wire. The 777 is also a
&gt;much bigger plane than the A320...

Airbus has continued evolving its aircraft line.  There are now the A330 and
A340, heavy long-range transports.  Same interface.

&gt; The average persons response to all of the A3?? technical discussion would
&gt; probably be that it frankly it does not matter why these planes crash!. 

There are many people reading this newsgroup whose job descriptions include
understanding and solving these problems so that future generations of 
aircraft do not cost lives or resources.

The reason that RISKS keeps harping on airplane automation is that it has 
broad ramifications to the computer industry in general, and safety-critical 
systems in particular.  What gets established as "safe" in aviation will 
undoubtedly define standards of "safety" for other disciplines: this includes
specification and development paradigms.  So these crashes should be of 
interest to ALL computer professionals and computer scientists. 

And there are certainly people out there whose job descriptions do include 
making managerial-level equipment decisions, who may not be aware or 
sensitized to some of these issues.

In <A HREF="/Risks/16.15.html">RISKS-16.15</A>, Robert Dorsett disagrees with two quotes from my
posting in <A HREF="/Risks/16.14.html">RISKS-16.14</A>. I disagree with his disagreements:

&gt; &gt; Fly-by-wire aircraft use modes because they have to. 
&gt; 
&gt; This is not true.  Early FBW aircraft were essentially open-loop analog
&gt; systems.  

I wasn't thinking about history when I made my assertion.  There are
many fly-by-wire aircraft types around *nowadays*, all but two of
which are military, as of last Sunday.  Do any of these aircraft *not*
use modes? I can't think of one (but I would like to know of the
exception that proves my rule). Robert's strong rejection may be as
misleading as he thought my assertion was.

Robert holds the view that sidestick control may have been the result
of non-engineering decisions. That may be true (or not), but I don't
consider it relevant to whether sidestick control is well-engineered
or not in a given aircraft.

&gt; &gt;A further comment about the Nagoya accident is appropriate. Current
&gt; &gt;knowledge is that the pilots failed to follow normal, explicit
&gt; &gt;procedure for control of the aircraft, 
&gt; 
&gt; Really?  I've not seen that anywhere.  

Flight International, 11-17 May 1994 p5, "a pilot pushes forward on
the control column to counteract the autopilot nose-up input. *This is
against the published procedures ...*" (my emphasis).  FI and David
Learmount are regarded as accurate on such matters.

&gt; &gt;and secondly that they had both
&gt; &gt;been drinking alcohol, which is illegal for good reason.  
&gt; 
&gt; This has also not been substantiated.  The investigators will not comment,

Robert's assertions do not necessarily contradict mine.  It may help
to understand more of the context.  The investigators will not
comment officially, but then they're required not to - the official
report on the Warsaw A320 accident is not out yet either, but that
doesn't stop us knowing most of the factors involved there. Concerning
the Nagoya A300 accident, there are normally-reliable aviation journal
reports (sorry, the ref's buried) on the precise blood-alcohol level of
the pilots which lead to my conclusion.

&gt; &gt;senior management of China Airlines has resigned because of this
&gt; &gt; accident.  
&gt; 
&gt; Because of the fifth major accident in as many years,
&gt; was the way I understood it.

..which are two ways of reporting the facts associated with the same event.

Thanks to Peter Mellor it has some to my attention that my statement about
loss of craft per craft delivered is not true.  Unfortunately, I added that
comment based on previous information about per-mile crash rates.  The focus
that I intended was that the average person does not really care why, only
that they perceive that there is a potential safety problem.  A good parallel
might be the Audi 5000 series of reported "sudden-acceleration" problems.
Although the Audi 5000 may not have had a larger incident rate of sudden
acceleration than other cars, ultimately perception was the driving factor.
People did not say: "oh that sudden acceleration problem, well that Audi 5000
was owned by someone from the '3rd' world, it must be his fault".  Ultimately,
the car had at least its name changed, and it probably cost Audi car sales.
At least in the case of the Audi, I could choose not to buy the car.  In the
case of airline travel, and cannot make the choice between airframes because
the information is not available.  I may be making the choice based on poor
information, but it is my poor decision to make.

Also, the airframe loss statistics can be somewhat misleading as well, as
crashes in the information Peter sent to me does not say, for example, if the
747 statistics includes losses such as the Canary Island collision, or the
Lockerbee terrorist loss.

Once again, I apologize of the incorrect statement.

Dear Pete,
	Unfortunately I did a back of the envelope calculation that is
probably more suited to comparing the number of takeoffs/landings against
accident rates.  I remember seeing statistics on the number of 757 lost per
total mile (or sorties) vs. A3??.  The numbers were quite heavily in favor of
the Boeing.

	However, you are absolutely correct.  I should not have made sure that
I have accurate data before such a broad statement.  Please delete that
section the message.  I should know better.

	The real point that I wanted to make is that the general public does
not care about root-cause analysis, fly-by-wire, or different flight modes.
Perceptions of safety, like those that plagued the DC-10 for several years,
and like the Audi 5000, are what people care about.  Our rationalization that
these crashes occurred due to pilot error in 3rd world countries does not make
me feel any safer.

	It would be interesting to know the breakdown of the essential
reasons for the airframe losses in the table you provided.  There are
three categories I would like to see:

	1) Loss on the ground (at least 2 of the 747's were lost this way)
	2) Loss due to mechanical defect
	3) Crew error.

	Also, which accidents cause a total loss or just loss of the frame.
For example, a 747 was lost part of its skin, but landed safely (with MOST of
its passengers).  A 737 got a moon roof, but landed safely (with all of its
passengers and MOST of the crew).  A DC-10 (with the blown cargo door) landed
with most of its passengers and crew.  I assume that these airframes are 
gone, but are they really "losses" in the sense that the average person
would think they are crashes.  Moreover, some of these craft were blown out of
the ski by terrorists, or set fire on the ground.  I believe that this
changes the numbers in the table.  For example, if one does the following

	22 hulls lost for the 747 (are there really only 988 in service?)
      -  2 Canary Island
      -  1 Lockerbee
      -----
        19 "Crashed Hulls"

	19/988 = 1.92% losses 

this is compared to the 2.23% losses in the table.

Another possibly category, since the blame seemingly points to problems of
third world operators, is how many of these crashes are airlines that have 
questionable maintenance. 

The last category is time.  Although I am chancing fate, when was the last
DC-10/MD-11 crash?  What is the current rate, as compared to previous years.
Do these planes just need to get over "infant" problems, or is the rate 
essentially constant?

	Moreover, if we look at unexplainable crashes, at least for the Boeing

&gt; ... if we play only on the statistics, I want a airplane with a good
&gt; safety record.  ...

If the statistics bear this out, it raises a point I haven't seen mentioned in
the periodic discussions about the AirBus Industrie family of flying machines.

If AI is indeed experiencing more hull losses than comparable airframes from
other makers, then as a passenger, I don't really care that AI is having
greater success in obtaining "pilot error" determinations in many of the
crashes.  If their aircraft are more susceptible to pilot error, then AI's
aircraft in fact have a problem, and I won't ride them.

Whether computer or airliner, successfully blaming system inadequacies on
the user is no substitute for designing usable systems in the first place.
A comparison of incident/accident rates by airframe, showing the percentage
resolved as "pilot error", would be interesting.

"Hacker Pleads Guilty to Fraud", By ELKA WORNER

  LOS ANGELES, June 14 (UPI) -- A computer hacker accused of breaking into
  computer systems to rig promotional contests at radio stations, eavesdrop on
  private citizens and thwart police investigations, pleaded guilty Tuesday to
  fraud.  Kevin Poulsen, 28, of Menlo Park, faces 40 years in prison and a
  $1,750,000 fine when he is sentenced Oct. 17.
    He pleaded guilty in federal court to computer fraud, interception of wire
  communications, mail fraud, money laundering and obstruction of justice.

The author summarizes the case against Poulsen [I added details she didn't
include]:

o	[manipulated the phone systems to cheat in radio-station call-in
contests that awarded prizes to a specific caller in sequence]; he stole "two
Porsches from radio station KIIS-FM, $20,000 in cash from KPWR-FM and at least
two trips to Hawaii and $2,000 in cash from the same station."

o	used lies and counterfeit IDs to claim and then sell his prizes.

o	uncovered FBI-run businesses, spotted FBI wiretaps and listened in on
conversations of ordinary citizens.
   
o	called a confederate "minutes after his arrest to ... hide the
computers used in his illicit activities."

o	lived on the run for 18 months after being indicted in San Francisco
by a grand jury until his arrest in April 1991 .

o	in July 1994, he will be tried "on 18 counts of telecommunications and
computer related fraud, including charges that he stole Pacific Bell access
codes to invade an Army computer network and to obtain information used in FBI
investigation of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos."

o	worked for the Soviet consul in S.F. by obtaining unpublished telephone
numbers."

  DARTMOUTH ALUMNUS CAUGHT SELLING PHONY GRADUATION TICKETS

    HANOVER, N.H., June 14 (Reuter) - A former Dartmouth College student was
arrested for selling counterfeit graduation tickets for the event at his Ivy
League alma mater, police said Tuesday.  Corby Edward Page, 23, a computer
programmer from Houston, Texas and a 1992 Dartmouth graduate, admitted to
making the fake tickets on his computer and selling them before the June 12
graduation for $15 each, said Hanover Police Sergeant Christopher O'Connor."

According to the story, a student who bought a bogus ticket "called police
after noticing the fake tickets were different from the real ones."  The idiot
grad was caught "in the lobby of the posh Hanover Inn, opposite the Dartmouth
campus, as he sold tickets, police said."
He was charged with fraud.

On Wednesday, June 15, 1994, the Los Angeles Times reported on page D7 in
their relatively new weekly section called "The Cutting Edge
Computing/Technology/Innovation" the following:

	"Virtual Billboard" Is Sign of the Times	

Baseball teams would love the revenue from behind-the-batter billboards, and
advertisers like the idea of being on screen without fear of remote-control
zapping. But purists denounce the idea as antithetical to the tradition of the
game, and some players say the signs make it harder to see the ball.

Now inventors have devised a system that will create electronic billboards
visible only to people watching on TV. Princeton Electronic Billboards Inc. in
Princeton, N.J., has been testing "virtual billboards" with the Baltimore
Orioles and its telecasters. Working with the David Sarnoff Research Center,
the firm developed a computerized system that inserts images electronically
into TV shows.

Before a game, the TV cameras scan the arena and "memorize" features of the
park, such as creases in the padded wall behind home plate and other
boundaries that define a virtual billboard. When the camera passes those
features during the telecast, the system inserts the sign, or the part of it
visible in the camera's frame of reference.

Ballplayers on the field appear to walk in front of the sign. Ideally, the TV
audience will be unable to tell whether the billboard hangs in the ballpark or
only in cyberspace. Local sponsors could buy a billboard in a national
telecast, and a national advertiser could deliver different messages in each
market.

Princeton Electronic hopes to make the system available commercially before
the baseball season ends this fall."

It seems obvious that the RISKS increase as the truth of the picture in the TV
medium can be selectively and partially modified. It is difficult enough now
for many people to tell whether what is seen on TV is real or fake [note the
many similarities between national network TV news, major metropolitan network
news and the recreated news in Hard Copy and its several competitors.]

Something has just come to light that might be of interest to Risks readers
concerning my end of the year taxes here in Canada. For whatever reason, my
new accountant (who resides in a different city) filed my tax with a typo on
it: my birthday was off by one day. Well, as expected, the system the Feds
have sent me a note saying my birthday had changed from the last time I had
filed. The form asked me to come down to my local office to correct the error,
or if this wasn't an error don't worry about it.
 
How can they say "don't worry about it"? As far as I know people aren't
allowed to change their birthday! I chatted with the teller that helped me
correct the error. He said that his most memorable error was a situation where
a senior had transposed the middle digits of his year of birth to make him
younger by decades. The error was caught when the computer found a young
person claiming pension benefits.
 
The teller enlightened me by saying that personal data is taken from only the
most recent filing. I suppose this would be ok for a change of address or even
of name, but of birthday! Imagine your favorite ten risks....

Note: The following material was released by NIST in response to recent
articles regarding AT&amp;T/Matt Blaze and the key escrow chip.  A second more
technical response follows.

                    -------------------------
June 2, 1994
Contact:  Anne Enright Shepherd
(301) 975-4858

The draft paper by Matt Blaze* describes several techniques aimed at
circumventing law enforcement access to key escrowed encryption products based
on government-developed technologies.

As Blaze himself points out, these techniques deal only with the
law-enforcement feature, and in no way reduce the key escrow chips' inherent
security and data privacy.

     --   "None of the methods given here permit an attacker to
          discover the contents of encrypted traffic or
          compromise the integrity of signed messages.  Nothing
          here affects the strength of the system from the point
          of view of the communicating parties...." p. 7.

Furthermore, Blaze notes that the techniques he is suggesting are
of limited use in real-world voice applications.

     --   "28 minutes obviously adds too much latency to the
          setup time for real-time applications such as secure
          telephone calls." p. 7.

     --   "The techniques used to implement them do carry enough
          of a performance penalty, however, to limit their
          usefulness in real-time voice telephony, which is
          perhaps the government's richest source of wiretap-
          based intelligence." p. 8.

Anyone interested in circumventing law enforcement access would most likely
choose simpler alternatives (e.g., use other nonescrowed devices, or super
encryption by a second device).  More difficult and time-consuming efforts,
like those discussed in the Blaze paper, merit continued government review --
but they are very unlikely to be employed in actual communications.

All sound cryptographic designs and products consider trade-offs among design
complexity, costs, time and risks.  Voluntary key escrow technology is no
exception.  Government researchers recognized and accepted that the law
enforcement access feature could be nullified, but only if the user was
willing to invest substantial time and trouble, as the Blaze report points
out.  Clearly, the government's basic design objective for key escrow
technology was met: to provide users with very secure communications that will
still enable law enforcement agencies to benefit from lawfully authorized
wiretaps.  It is still the only such technology available today.

Today, most Americans using telephones, fax machines, and cellular phones have
minimal privacy protection.  The key escrow technology -- which is available
on a strictly voluntary basis to the private sector -- will provide the
security and privacy that Americans want and need.

*    Statements from "Protocol Failure in the Escrowed Encryption
     Standard," May 20 draft report by Matt Blaze, AT&amp;T Bell
     Laboratories
                              -----

Note: The following provides additional technical material in response to
questions regarding a recent paper by Matt Blaze on key escrow encryption.

        --------------------------------------
                              
Technical Fact Sheet on Blaze Report and Key Escrow Encryption

     Several recent newspaper articles have brought attention to a report
prepared by Dr. Matthew Blaze, a researcher at AT&amp;T's Bell Labs. These
articles characterize a particular finding in Blaze's report as a ~flaw~ in
the U.S. government's key escrow encryption technology. None of the findings
in Dr. Blaze's paper in any way undermines the security and privacy provided
by the escrow encryption devices.

     The finding which has received the most publicity could allow a
non-compliant or ~rogue~ application to send messages to compliant or
~non-rogue~ users which will not be accessible by law enforcement officials
through the escrowed encryption standard field called the Law Enforcement
Access Field (LEAF).

     Dr. Blaze's approach uses the openly disclosed fact that the LEAF
contains 16-bit checkword to prevent rogue users from modifying the law
enforcement access mechanism. This 16-bit checkword is part of the 128-bit
LEAF, which also includes the enciphered traffic key and the unique chip
identifier.
 
     Dr. Blaze's method is to randomly generate different 128-bit LEAFs until
he gets one that passes the checkword. It will take on average 216, or 65,536
tries.  This is not a formidable task; it could be done in less than an hour.
Dr. Blaze questions the adequacy of a 16-bit checkword and suggests using a
larger one, to ensure that the exhaustion attack would be so time consuming as
to be impractical.
 
     The chip designers recognized the strengths and limitations of a 16-bit
checkword. Following are the reasons why they chose to use a checkword of only
16 bits:

* There were four fundamental considerations that the designers considered in
choosing the LEAF parameters.

These were:

(1) ease of access by authorized law enforcement agencies, 

(2) impact on communications, 

(3) a sufficiently large identifier field which would not constrain
manufacturers, and

(4) the difficulty required to invalidate the LEAF mechanism by techniques
such as those described by Dr. Blaze.

* The purpose of the LEAF is to preserve law enforcement's ability to access
communications in real-time. The encrypted traffic key, which enables them to
do this, is 80 bits long. In addition to this 80-bit field, the LEAF must
contain the unique identification number of the key escrow encryption chip
doing the encryption.

* The size of the identifier field was the subject of considerable
deliberation.  In the earliest considerations it was only 25 bits long. The
chip designers recognized that 25 bits did not offer enough flexibility to
provide for multiple manufacturers of key escrow devices. Different chip
manufacturers would need manufacturer identifiers as well as their own chip
identifiers to ensure that identifiers are unique. Eventually, the designers
agreed that 32 bits would adequately meet this requirement.

* In many environments, error-free delivery of data is not guaranteed, and
there is considerable concern by communication engineers that requiring
error-free transmission of a fixed field (the LEAF) could make the encryption
device difficult to use. In early discussions with industry, they were opposed
to any checkword.  In the end, they agreed it would be acceptable if the size
of the LEAF was restricted to 128 bits. This left 16 bits for a checkword to
inhibit bypassing the LEAF. While recognizing the possibility of exhausting
these 16 bits, the designers concluded that 16 bits are adequate for the first
intended application. Security enhancements are being made for other
applications, such as the TESSERA card.

Note that computations are required to search for a matching checkword, which
then has to be properly substituted into the communications protocol. The
performance and cost penalties of the search operation are significant for
telephone, radio, and other such applications, thus providing adequate
protection against this technique for bypassing the LEAF.

In summary:

* Although this technique would allow one to bypass the LEAF, the security
provided by the escrow encryption devices would not be altered. Users'
information would still be protected by the full strength of the encryption
algorithm.

* Dr. Blaze was accurate in noting that these attacks are of limited
effectiveness in real-time telephony.

* When designing the key escrow chip, NSA emphasized sound security and
privacy, along with user friendliness. The attacks described by Dr. Blaze were
fully understood at the time of initial chip design. The use of 16 bits for
the checkword was an appropriate choice in view of the constraints of a
128-bit LEAF.  It provides excellent security for real-time telephone
applications with high assurance that law enforcement's interests are
protected.

* Dr. Blaze's research was done using prototype TESSERA cards.  As part of the
family of planned releases/upgrades, NSA already has incorporated additional
security safeguards into the production TESSERA cards to protect against the
kinds of attacks described by Dr. Blaze.

Here at the University of Rochester, students are given ROLMphone 120DCMs
in their rooms. These phones (or, more precisely, the digital switch that
they are connected to) have a function called "do not disturb". When the
appropriate code is entered into the keypad, the line is put into DND mode,
and it -will not ring- for any reason. However, if someone tries to call,
they hear ringing.

There are two problems with the implementation of this feature. First, the
code to activate and de-activate the feature is anything but intuitive. 
Having lived off-campus for a while, I forget the exact code, but it is along
the lines of #6x. The code for speed-dialing numbers is #3x. On more than
one occasion I meant to hit a speed-dial and instead activated do-not-disturb.

This wouldn't be a big problem... except that there is no indication
whatsoever that you are in DND mode. No lights, no tones, no message to
callers. I missed calls for days the first time I did this... and a lot of
people got concerned because I "was never home".

This system should at the least have some sort of different dialtone or
indicator light to show that you won't be getting any calls. (God knows the
ROLM 120 has enough blinky-lights...) Likewise, since the switch is equipped
with PhoneMail, it would be nice if it could give an announcement... "The 
party you have dialed is not accepting calls at this time."

The privacy may be nice when you're using your dorm room for, shall we say,
after-hours social research ;) -- but if you're forgetful like me, the
implementation is pretty troublesome.

&lt;<A HREF="mailto:kaploww@cs.rpi.edu">kaploww@cs.rpi.edu</A>&gt; in RISKS DIGEST 16.15 under the title: "Does it matter
why A3??'s have a poor record?"

To recap, Wesley said (without citing a source): 

&gt; Already, Airbus Industry has lost more planes per delivered plane
&gt; than other major aircraft manufacturer in the past 3 decades (Lockheed,
&gt; Boeing, MD). 

I contradicted this in RISKS 16.16, citing a table of statistics from an 
article entitled ``Der Traum von Total Sicherheit'' ["The Dream of Total 
Safety"], in the German magazine Focus, 38, 1993, pp18-21, and Wesley has 
since agreed that his statement requires support (see his follow-up mailings). 
The table was as follows:- 

&gt;Aircraft         No. in     Hulls      % Losses 
&gt;Type             Service    Lost              
&gt;
&gt;DC-9/MD-80       2065       68         3.29  
&gt;Boeing 727       1831       62         3.39  
&gt;Boeing 737       2515       57         2.27  
&gt;Boeing 747       988        22         2.23  
&gt;DC-10            446        21         4.71  
&gt;Airbus A300/310  636        7          1.10  
&gt;Airbus A320      411        4          0.97 

Focus magazine cited "Luftfahrtindustrie" (NOTE: not "Lundfahrtindustrie", 
as I originally transcribed it) as the source. 

Since then, I have been jumped on from a great height by several RISKS 
contributors who have accused me of abusing statistics. Since this is not 
something I do deliberately, I would like to make the following points 
(taking into account the various objections raised by those who have 
written to me):- 

1. I am well aware that the statistics above are incomplete. They do not 
   allow for the total operating time of each type. They do not distinguish 
   between losses due to on-board system failure and losses due to other 
   causes which could not possibly be blamed on the manufacturer (e.g., 
   the Lockerbie bombing, the Vincennes shoot-down). They do not take  
   account of wear-out and natural retirement, so that the number shown 
   may be the "number sold" and not the "number in service". I quoted them 
   because they were all I had at the time (while being acutely aware of 
   their imperfections). 

2. Wesley's original statement *is*, however, refuted by these statistics 
   *provided they are correct* (see point 3). A secondary question arises: 
   "Is this a meaningful measure of the safety of a type of aircraft?" 
   I will return to this in point 4. 

3. Peter Ladkin pointed out to me that the source name that I had originally 
   misread as "Lundfahrtindustrie" and assumed to be some official body 
   which records air accident statistics, is in fact "Luftfahrtindustrie" 
   (well, it was in small print! :-) and means simply "Air Travel Industry". 
   In other words, the source cited by Focus magazine is totally vague, and 
   (as Peter said) about as authoritative as "I read it on the net"! :-) 
   The statistics I naively quoted therefore need substantiation. 

4. What would convince Joe Public that a given aircraft type was safe to 
   fly? There are several possible measures of the safety of an aircraft 
   design (note: I do *not* pretend that this list is exhaustive):- 

   a) Deaths per passenger mile on the given type. This is used by the 
      aircraft manufacturing industry. Conclusion: air travel is the safest 
      way of going anywhere. 

   b) Deaths per passenger *hour* on the given type. This makes flying 
      about as safe as driving, but the risk would seem to be tolerable, 
      since a probability of 10^-4 per year of dying in a road accident 
      doesn't seem to worry most people (figures based on official UK 
      statistics). 

   c) Crashes (i.e., hull write-off) per revenue flight hour. This is used 
      by the certification agencies (FAA, JAA, etc.) when awarding an 
      airworthiness type certificate. The target is a maximum probability 
      of loss of aircraft of 10^-6 per flight hour due to *all* causes. 
      Historically, statistics show that *system-related* causes account for 
      1 in 10. The conservative assumption that there are 100 critical 
      systems on board then leads to the famous 10^-9 requirement for 
      probability of failure of an individual flight-critical system. 

   d) Crashes per cycle (take-off plus landing). 

   e) Crashes per example delivered (which is where we came in! :-) 

   f) Passenger deaths per cycle. 

   g) Serious incidents per flight hour or per cycle. (Q: "How many accidents 
      has the A320 had?"  A: "Five - You forgot about Lille, where an A320 
      landed on top of a Mooney, taking off both its wings and the empennage, 
      and collapsing the A320's front gear. Since nobody was hurt, it doesn't 
      count, or does it?") 

   The whole picture is confused by the fact that the public perception 
   of risk is biased *against* rare events that kill lots of people, and 
   less against common events that kill a few. (In assessing any event that 
   loses the aircraft, you must assume the worst case: that you kill everyone 
   on board. If you crash a car, it's just you and the guy you hit!) 

   I don't pretend to give an answer here, simply raise a few pertinent 
   questions, whose answers (IMHO) are far from obvious. 

5. A fairer comparison would be between the A320 and competing aircraft 
   *of the same generation*. I would like to thank Robert Dorsett for 
   the following:- 

   757  = 0 in eleven years.
   767  = 1 in twelve years. (Lauda)
   A320 = 4 in five years. (Air France, Indian Airlines, Air Inter, Lufthansa)

6. Given that all the statistics above are deficient (basically, they lack 
   an exposure time base), they do still tell us *something*. (In considering 
   a fleet above a certain size, we could assume roughly the same operating 
   hours per day for each example, and things like maintenance time, etc., 
   would average out.) We could *tentatively* conclude that the A320 is a 
   long way from being a flying coffin, but also a long way from being the 
   safest aircraft ever, or even as safe as it should be, given its modernity. 
   The public perception of the A320 seems to be that it is the most 
   dangerous thing that ever left the ground. IMHO this is wrong, and we 
   should be careful not to spread false alarm. 


There are, of course, better statistics (e.g., from Flight International) 
and I shall attempt to locate a few. The best come from the air insurance 
industry, but I am not sure that I can get my grubby paws on those for 
reasons of confidentiality. 

In the meantime, if anyone knows of a good source ... :-) 

Also, how can I phrase an argument to convince my mother that I stand a 
greater chance of being run over crossing St. Johns Road while walking from 
Farringdon tube station to the University than I do of dying in an air crash? 
Then I won't have to make long distance 'phone calls from the airport in 
B*m***k Egypt to tell her we landed safely every time I go to a conference! :-)

I'm sure many people have heard this already, even though it only happened
yesterday (Friday, 17 June).  I'm sure most people have heard about O.J.
Simpson [he was charged with a double murder], and Friday evening he took a
long drive around the LA Highway system.  Police said that they discovered his
location (and even his very car) through the use of the Cellular Phone system.

The RISKS are obvious: Being able to locate someone just by their cell phone,
and by extension, just keeping a cell-phone turned on transmits enough
information to be located.  For example, if anyone carries a Digital Personal
Communicator (DPC), or other such flip-top cell phones, or any cell phone, for
that matter, they can be physically tracked, basically, anywhere in the
country through the cellular phone system.

And as the cells get smaller, the location detail gets better.  What
will happen when we have micro-cellular phones, a cell for every
building, or even a cell for every office!  Think about the level of
personal tracking that can be done with this level of detail!

Subject: IS THE WHAT EDI IS ALL ABOUT?

The following article was published today in the Jackson Clarion-Ledger.
Is this what Electronic billing does for us?  Are the Medicare fiscal
intermediary software programs for claims processing really that stupid?


WOMAN GETS THE MESSAGE, OK?

Dorothy Joyce's mailman brought her 131 letters in one visit, and
none of it was junk mail.  All were from one correspondent:  MEDICARE.
"The postman said, 'Lady, I've never delivered so much mail to one person
before,'" Joyce, 77, said.  Each envelope contained four notices concerning
Joyce's claim for a $29.97 doctor's visit.  Each cost 46 cents to mail; the
government spent $60.26 to tell Joyce her claim was invalid.

After her May 17 visit to Dr. Samual P. Robinson's Gulfport office, Robinson's
computer notified Medicare's computer that Joyce had been there.  And kept on
notifying, said Margaret Brundidge, a clerk with Travelers Insurance Co.
Medicare office in Jackson.

Phil Agre recently said he found it "scary" that some political campaigners
are apparently tailoring political ads to probable interests of individuals,
based on extracts from available databases.  He is, however, describing an
activity that is already happening with advertising in general.  I don't
understand the grounding for his assessment that tailored political ads are
"scary".  Few of us like the telemarketers who call at dinner and seem to know
things about us, but most people would call this "annoying" not "scary".

If I recall correctly, this thread began when someone asserted that AI
aircraft were just too unsafe for him.  I remember thinking at the time
that that was a "nationalist" position not supported by facts.  One set of
facts looks something like this:

&gt;DC-9/MD-80       2065       68         3.29  
&gt;Boeing 727       1831       62         3.39  
&gt;Boeing 737       2515       57         2.27  
&gt;Boeing 747       988        22         2.23  
&gt;DC-10            446        21         4.71  
&gt;Airbus A300/310  636        7          1.10  
&gt;Airbus A320      411        4          0.97 

According to this data a rational person might actually prefer AI airframes.

Based upon the data a rational person would certainly prefer the A320 to,
let us say the B727.  However, based upon public perception, one would
certainly prefer the B727.  The 727 enjoys a well-deserved public
reputation for safety.  On the other hand, those of us who have been adults
since the 727 was introduced remember that early in their use they fell out
of the sky like hail stones.  In response to a number of crash landings the
operations manual was changed.  The landing configuration was changed from
nose-down low-revs to nose-high high-revs.  That change contributed greatly
to the enviable safety record of the 727.

Based upon the data above, one might prefer the A320 to the DC10.  On the
other hand, the data could be very misleading.  The DC10s, having been around
a great deal longer, may have lost far fewer airframes per operation.

(Besides, I like to fly on DC10s.  In many configurations, they are the most
comfortable planes in the air.  I do not pretend to be completely rational.
If I were, I would certainly prefer any of these planes to my car.)

My point is that, given the sizes of the (Ns) numbers above and given what
they measure, it is simply not possible to make a rational choice between
the planes.  It probably is not possible even to rationally prefer them to
automobiles.  

I make my living trying to help my clients make rational and safe choices
in areas where there is all too much data about the consequences of an
event and all too little about the rates of occurrence.  Given the
statistical significance of this data,  I doubt that I could change the
client's life expectancy by more than a few seconds, one way or the other,
by making a systematic choice between those planes, on that or any other
available data, even if she took a flight every day.  

Taken across the entire population likely to fly on those planes, I could
do a tiny bit better.  However, I could not do sufficiently better to
justify public policy.  I sympathize with those charged with doing so.

There seems to be a political demand, or at least an  expectation,  in our
current culture for zero risk.  The real world does not work that way.

Unfortunately, there is no way to interpret this data. Maybe the
DC-10s were flown several times a day and the A320s were parked.
You must supply miles flown vs. hulls lost, or, even better yet,
hops vs. hulls lost (since most accidents happen in takeoff/landing).

On a lighter note, this discussion of Airbus RISKS reminds me of an article in
Flight International a few years ago, on the Airbus and its software problems.

The Airbus has many new software-related systems, and had many teething
troubles with them. Navigation systems were mentioned as problematic, as were
the concerns about fly-by-wire. The crucial problems, as far as operations
were concerned, weren't about any of these high profile systems; they were
about something as mundane as the computer controlled lavatory valves. If you
have a navigational failure, the co-pilot needs to get their manual plotter
and charts out again, but you can still fly on. OTOH, a plane full of a few
hundred incontinent pensioners on their way to Tenerife isn't going *anywhere*
unless the toilets are working !

I can't believe that anyone would propose such numbers as a useful measure

compared to.  727s, for instance, are quite old (most of 'em are
approaching retirement, are they not?) and would have seen many more
flights than A3xx craft.  The low rates reported for A3xx probably just
reflect the youth of the fleet.

I would find loss rates per mile flown, or perhaps per departure, far more
credible.  Anyone have that data?

   I am sure most people reading the RISKS DIGEST have been bitten by the
automated supermarket checkout machines. However, having been bitten recently,
I believe it bears repeating.

   It has been a weekly routine with my family to help my mother on thursday
nights do the shopping. Normally we take along a list, a calculator and
generally have a fairly good chat while we take care of the groceries. Now the
supermarket we shop at has a checkout system based on a barcode scanner that
they pass the goods over to tot the price up. We double check the price using
the calculator by adding up the shelf listed prices as we procure the items
from the shelf.

   But in over two years of doing this we have *never* had a calculator result
that tallied exactly with the given price. Often this can be explained as
human error but the supermarket has an array of interesting tricks that often
account for this difference.

1) Not listing the price. Anywhere. This is often the case in the bread
section.

2) Listing the *wrong* price. Several times we have bought a product that has
been listed at one price and has rung up on the checkout counter at another
price. Usually we only spot the difference once we have returned home and
tried to identify why the calculator result was out. Invariably the price
change is in the supermarket's favour.

3) Double scanning products. That way it gets rung up twice and you get charged
twice for the one product.

4) The bar code information is for the wrong product. Presumably data entry
errors occur and the bar code on the product you are buying is linked to the
wrong price data.

Now I am not suggesting that any of these practices are deliberate but it is
easy to see why supermarkets are not terribly keen to stamp out such problems.
All it requires is a hundred or so errors, a week, like this to occur and the
supermarket accrues, on average, another $300 of profit. (Our average
difference is usually around the $3 mark.)

   What makes it worse is that alot of the supermarket staff believe the
computer to be infallible and incapable of error. When I assure them that, due
to my profession of programming the things, I know very well that they can go
wrong it a large number of ways they almost invariably remain dubious of my
assertion.

   The risks are fairly clear. It is worthwhile double checking the price you
get charged for your groceries. While the system itself is fairly reliable it
naturally cannot cope with the human error side of things due to faulty use or
data entry into the system.

A330 FLIGHT TEST ACCIDENT, 30TH JUNE 1994 

Airbus Industrie regrets to confirm that a flight test A330, powered by Pratt
&amp; Whitney PW4168 engines, crashed at 17.50 today at Blagnac Airport, Toulouse,
within the airport boundary.  Seven people were on board the aircraft: four
members of Airbus Industrie personnel, including the Chief Test Pilot, and
three airline pilots. There were no survivors.

The aircraft involved in the accident was serial number 042, which made its
first flight on 14th October 1993 and had accumulated 362 flight hours as part
of Airbus Industrie A330 flight test programme.

The flight being undertaken aimed to test a new autopilot standard intended
for certification with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines for all-weather Category III
operations.

The test was planned to take place with maximum aft centre of gravity, at
minimum speed and with maximum angle of climb.

Immediately after take-off, once the maximum flight attitude was reached
(between 25 and 30 degrees), the test sequence involved switching on the
aircraft's autopilot, simulating an engine failure and cutting off the
engine's associated hydraulic circuit.

For reasons which are yet to be determined, the aircraft suffered a sudden
loss of lateral control. Although it would appear that the pilot regained
control, the altitude of the aircraft was too low to avoid impact with the
ground, especially bearing in mind the extreme conditions of this particular
test flight.

Commentary, quote choice, and paraphrasing by Mark Seecof &lt;<A HREF="mailto:marks@latimes.com">marks@latimes.com</A>&gt;.

In a story on page D-2 of the 1 July 1994 Los Angeles Times by Scot J. Paltrow,
we learn of "investigations and enforcement actions directed at individuals who
solicit money for dubious or fraudulent investments through the financial
bulletin boards of on-line services such as Prodigy, America Online, and
CompuServe."

Missouri, New Jersy, and Texas regulators are leading the charge with the
members of the "North American Securities Administrators Assn., the
organization of state regulators" behind them.

"The action also represents an effort by state regulators to assert
jurisdiction over financial solicitations on the bulletin boards, even if the
messages are posted from other states or countries.  The Securities and
Exchange Commission enforcement staff confirmed Thursday that the federal
agency is also looking into the issue."

Among other things, "regulators say penny-stock scammers have moved onto the
bulletin boards, hyping thinly traded low-priced stocks by posting notes with
wildly inflated claims about the companies' propects."

"The on-line services say they are cooperating with regulators but are not
equipped to police the thousands of messages posted daily.  They also say it
is not a proper role for service operators to limit the free flow of
communication, although on-line services often censor sexually explicit or
politically offensive messages."

[PGN excerpting]

Good cop, bad cop at fingertips: Computer could see possibilities
Peter Kendall, The Chicago Tribune, 1 July, 1994

  The Chicago Police Department has a new computer program that they say will
produce a list of officers likely to "go bad" by committing crimes using
excessive force or participating in other offenses that can get them fired.
The program, built on an $850 off-the-shelf software package, looks at
demographic data and work histories of officers who have been fired for
disciplinary reasons, then scours police personnel databases for current
officers with similar profiles.  Officers who appear on the list would be
contacted by supervisors and counseled on how to avoid committing acts that
could get them fired, sued or even arrested.

  The profile of "bad" cops was developed on the basis race, sex, age,
education, number of traffic accidents, reports of lost weapons or badges,
marital status and other factors, relating to 191 officers discharged between
1988 and 1993.  A comparison of that profile with 2,000 current officers
turned up 141 of those officers who were considered "at risk" for committing
an offense that could get them fired.

  Not surprisingly, the officers' union, the Fraternal Order of Police, is
wary.  "It's another form of Big Brother watching you," said Bill Nolan,
president of the FOP.

At the fourth Computers, Freedom, &amp; Privacy conference in Chicago last month,
the spotlight was on the growing conflict between the rights of individuals
and the role of government in the digital age.  A luckless Whitehouse House
representative and a lawyer for the NSA tried to convince a varied and
skeptical crowd that government control of cryptography was somehow a Good
Thing;
 
Meanwhile, in their search for fugitive criminals Kevin Mitnick and
wooden-legged "Agent Steal", the FBI erroneously arrested one unfortunate

"I-Way Robbery", By DAVID GRAM, AP Writer

   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Say you're cruising the information superhighway
from the comfort of your home computer and come across what appears to be
private, inside information on a hot new company. 
   "You spend $10,000 on stock -- and lose your money. 
   "You've just become a victim of what securities regulators say is the
latest trend in investment scams: frauds perpetrated over computer networks or
bulletin board services by hard-to-track hucksters.
   "Call it I-way robbery."

The author explains that there is a growing number of scams on the Internet and
local BBSs.

Some of the frauds perpetrated through Cyberspace are no different from the
usual techniques: false claims of expertise, theft of investments.  The only
specific technique involves deliberately posting what is intended to look like
private communications in a public venue, then taking advantage of
unscrupulous people's attempt to make a killing in the stock market.  The
specific case mentioned by the author involved two "Canadian companies ...
heavily hyped on computer bulletin board services. Their stock prices tripled
or more in a short period of time, then collapsed. One of the companies was
said to have won a major housing contract in the former Soviet Union; the
other was said to own a diamond mine in Zaire where a major strike had been
made."

The author identifies the nominal non-commerciality of the Internet as a reason
for its popularity among thieves.

[Comment from MK: perhaps these frauds will eventually lead to requirements for
effective identification and authentication of users.  Ultimately, it would be
helpful to see non-repudiation as a feature of all electronic communications.
For the time being, caveat lector.]

    COMPUTING SOCIETY RELEASES REPORT ON ENCRYPTION POLICY;
      "CLIPPER CHIP" CONTROVERSY EXPLORED BY EXPERT PANEL

     WASHINGTON, DC - A panel of experts convened by the nation's foremost
computing society today released a comprehensive report on U.S. cryptography
policy.  The report, "Codes, Keys and Conflicts: Issues in U.S Crypto Policy,"
is the culmination of a ten-month review conducted by the panel of
representatives of the computer industry and academia, government officials,
and attorneys.  The 50-page document explores the complex technical and social
issues underlying the current debate over the Clipper Chip and the export
control of information security technology.

     "With the development of the information superhighway, cryptography has
become a hotly debated policy issue," according to Joseph DeBlasi, Executive
Director of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), which convened the
expert panel.  "The ACM believes that this report is a significant
contribution to the ongoing debate on the Clipper Chip and encryption policy.
It cuts through the rhetoric and lays out the facts."

     Dr. Stephen Kent, Chief Scientist for Security Technology with the firm
of Bolt Beranek and Newman, said that he was pleased with the final report.
"It provides a very balanced discussion of many of the issues that surround
the debate on crypto policy, and we hope that it will serve as a foundation
for further public debate on this topic."

     The ACM report addresses the competing interests of the various
stakeholders in the encryption debate -- law enforcement agencies, the
intelligence community, industry and users of communications services.  It
reviews the recent history of U.S. cryptography policy and identifies key
questions that policymakers must resolve as they grapple with this
controversial issue.

     The ACM cryptography panel was chaired by Dr. Stephen Kent.  Dr. Susan
Landau, Research Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of
Massachusetts, co-ordinated the work of the panel and did most of the writing.
Other panel members were Dr.  Clinton Brooks, Advisor to the Director,
National Security Agency; Scott Charney, Chief of the Computer Crime Unit,
Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice; Dr. Dorothy Denning, Computer
Science Chair, Georgetown University; Dr. Whitfield Diffie, Distinguished
Engineer, Sun Microsystems; Dr. Anthony Lauck, Corporate Consulting Engineer,
Digital Equipment Corporation; Douglas Miller, Government Affairs Manager,
Software Publishers Association; Dr. Peter Neumann, Principal Scientist, SRI
International; and David Sobel, Legal Counsel, Electronic Privacy Information
Center.  Funding for the cryptography study was provided in part by the
National Science Foundation.

     The ACM, founded in 1947, is a 85,000 member non-profit educational and
scientific society dedicated to the development and use of information
technology, and to addressing the impact of that technology on the world's

     COMPUTER POLICY COMMITTEE CALLS FOR WITHDRAWAL OF CLIPPER 
            COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY "TOO IMPORTANT" FOR 
                     SECRET DECISION-MAKING

     WASHINGTON, DC - The public policy arm of the oldest and largest
international computing society today urged the White House to withdraw the
controversial "Clipper Chip" encryption proposal.  Noting that the "security
and privacy of electronic communications are vital to the development of
national and international information infrastructures," the Association for
Computing Machinery's U.S. Public Policy Committee (USACM) added its voice to
the growing debate over encryption and privacy policy.

     In a position statement released at a press conference on Capitol Hill,
the USACM said that "communications security is too important to be left to
secret processes and classified algorithms."  The Clipper technology was
developed by the National Security Agency, which classified the cryptographic
algorithm that underlies the encryption device.  The USACM believes that
Clipper "will put U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage in the global market
and will adversely affect technological development within the United States."
The technology has been championed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
the NSA, which claim that "non-escrowed" encryption technology threatens law
enforcement and national security.

     "As a body concerned with the development of government technology
policy, USACM is troubled by the process that gave rise to the Clipper
initiative," said Dr. Barbara Simons, a computer scientist with IBM who chairs
the USACM.  "It is vitally important that privacy protections for our
communications networks be developed openly and with full public
participation."

     The USACM position statement was issued after completion of a
comprehensive study of cryptography policy sponsored by the ACM (see companion
release).  The study, "Codes, Keys and Conflicts: Issues in U.S Crypto
Policy," was prepared by a panel of experts representing various
constituencies involved in the debate over encryption.

     The ACM, founded in 1947, is a 85,000 member non-profit educational and
scientific society dedicated to the development and use of information
technology, and to addressing the impact of that technology on the world's
major social challenges.  USACM was created by ACM to provide a means for
presenting and discussing technological issues to and with U.S. policymakers
and the general public.  For further information on USACM, please call (202)

   =============================================================

       USACM Position on the Escrowed Encryption Standard

The ACM study "Codes, Keys and Conflicts: Issues in U.S Crypto Policy" sets
forth the complex technical and social issues underlying the current debate
over widespread use of encryption.  The importance of encryption, and the need
for appropriate policies, will increase as networked communication grows.
Security and privacy of electronic communications are vital to the development
of national and international information infrastructures.

The Clipper Chip, or "Escrowed Encryption Standard" (EES) Initiative, raises
fundamental policy issues that must be fully addressed and publicly debated.
After reviewing the ACM study, which provides a balanced discussion of the
issues, the U.S.  Public Policy Committee of ACM (USACM) makes the following
recommendations.

  1.  The USACM supports the development of public policies and technical
standards for communications security in open forums in which all stakeholders
-- government, industry, and the public -- participate.  Because we are moving
rapidly to open networks, a prerequisite for the success of those networks
must be standards for which there is widespread consensus, including
international acceptance.  The USACM believes that communications security is
too important to be left to secret processes and classified algorithms.  We
support the principles underlying the Computer Security Act of 1987, in which
Congress expressed its preference for the development of open and unclassified
security standards.

  2.  The USACM recommends that any encryption standard adopted by the U.S.
government not place U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage in the global market
or adversely affect technological development within the United States.  Few
other nations are likely to adopt a standard that includes a classified
algorithm and keys escrowed with the U.S. government.

  3.  The USACM supports changes in the process of developing Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS) employed by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology.  This process is currently predicated on the use of
such standards solely to support Federal procurement.  Increasingly, the
standards set through the FIPS process directly affect non-federal
organizations and the public at large.  In the case of the EES, the vast
majority of comments solicited by NIST opposed the standard, but were openly
ignored.  The USACM recommends that the standards process be placed under the
Administrative Procedures Act so that citizens may have the same opportunity
to challenge government actions in the area of information processing
standards as they do in other important aspects of Federal agency policy
making.

  4.  The USACM urges the Administration at this point to withdraw the Clipper
Chip proposal and to begin an open and public review of encryption policy.
The escrowed encryption initiative raises vital issues of privacy, law
enforcement, competitiveness and scientific innovation that must be openly
discussed.

  5.  The USACM reaffirms its support for privacy protection and urges the
administration to encourage the development of technologies and institutional
practices that will provide real privacy for future users of the National
Information Infrastructure.

A particularly disturbing aspect of the cell phone story as it relates to the
Simpson case is that one of the local L.A. television stations had obtained,
by the night of the chase, the printout of all calls made from Simpson's
phone, and was showing the printout, in detail with all numbers exposed, on
the air.  They were also busily calling the numbers and questioning whoever
answered.  By Monday evening, the station was demonstrating how Simpson's
original voicemail announce message had been changed (I would presume by a
hacker) to something I'll categorize as being in very bad taste.

There is some apparent confusion in what was reported by Atkins re locating
the Cawlings-Simpson Bronco.  The following is from local media reporting.

The local TV news interviewed a young couple who were on the way to the
beach, pulled alongside the Bronco, recognized Cawlings, fell back and got
the license number, stopped at the first roadside emergency fone [which
are spaced every mile along Southern California freeways], and reported
the event/location.  Parts of the phone conversation with the emergency
dispatcher were played over TV, and the young couple were both present on
TV to tell their story.

Shortly thereafter, a police [Santa Ana ??] patrol car spotted the Bronco
and the Great Freeway Chase was underway.  The same car was said to be the
lead vehicle throughout the chase right up into the driveway at the home.

The Sunday LATimes did have an article concerning the role of the cell
phone in the event.  It is correct that the car received and originated
many calls during the chase.  Some of the calls were from people trying to
persuade Simpson to surrender [e.g., McCabe his former coach], others were
from the police in a negotiating mode, others were with the chase cars
alerting them intended turnoffs onto other freeways and reporting the
status of the occupants.  Parts of some of these calls have been played on
TV, and the content of others described verbally.

The Sunday article reported that "local law enforcement" subpoenaed the
cellular carrier [AirTouch] to cooperate, and the company reported that it
did monitor calls to/from the cellular number.  The article also reports
that law enforcement had obtained a court warrant authorizing tapping of
the cell phone, but it is not completely clear whether this was a separate
action or related to the subpoena action.

The legal facts are that actual tapping does require a court-authorized
warrant [the Wiretap Act of 1968] but access to "transaction records"
requires only a subpoena.  It is possible that law enforcement did both
things just to be safely legal.

The Times interviewed a security consultant from Houston who seemingly
speculated that triangulation had been used to locate the Bronco.  I put it
that way because there has been no statement by law enforcement that it did
more than have AirTouch monitor the calls. Moreover triangulation equipment
for a fast moving nearby target is not likely something that the local law
enforcement authorities would have.  There has been no mention of the
FBI but it is conceivable that it played a support shadow role; it probably
does have triangulation equipment.

The local reporting has been quite explicit that visible sighting of the
car was the basis of locating it, and that the cellphone became involved
only in attempting to resolve the situation.  There have been no official
statements that the cellphone was involved in location; there were the
comments by the consultant that triangulation was - or could have been -
used.

General comment.  A cellular system must know which cell an active call is
in because the system control must monitor adjacent cells and be prepared
to pass the call to one of them when the signal level falls below some
threshold.  So the Bronco's location within some cell could have been
known but it would not be very precise.  If cells get smaller in the
future, then the precision of location will increase - as Derek Atkins
properly points out.  In the case of the Cawlings-Simpson chase, however,
the evidence is that visible sightings were the basis for initiating and
conducting the chase.  Seemingly the facts got garbled as they wandered
around the country and were rewritten for various media occasions.

A cellphone in standby mode also is in contact with cell stations so that
its location will be known for incoming calls.  Again, the location will be
known by the system but only to within the extent of a cell-size.  A
cellphone that is turned off does not transmit and is invisible to the
system.  Whether system designs are such that "sustaining background
monitoring data" is available to the operators is beyond my knowledge --
the same LATimes article did make reference to AirTouch conducting
monitoring for the purpose of detecting fraud.

Derek Atkins wrote of the risk of cellular phones as exemplified by the OJ
Simpson case. I say, what risk? The risk that an accused double murderer will
be arrested? That is a RISK?  Often I have heard of politicians, criminals (my
redundancy checker is broken) caught unawares by the lack of privacy of
cellular phones. There is no insidious plot to this, only the fortunate
stupidity of the cell phone user, who has forgotten how the technology works.
Just because a previous form of communication afforded a degree of privacy,
one cannot assume, or logically legislate that all succeeding forms have the
same. If you use a form of communication it is incumbent upon you to match
your expectations of privacy with the technology, not the other way around.

Just ran across confusion about cellular service in two disparate sources.
Ann Landers and CNN.

The AL column mentioned Cellular in the headline. The centerpiece was a claim 
by Ameritech about how hard it is to listen in and that it was possible to 
get secure phones (from whom?). This is, of course, disinformation. The risks 
of listening in are not that someone will carefully follow both sides of a 
conversation, but that listeners will glean key information from portions of 
random conversations. One can argue about how big the threat is, but we know 
it is real. The key to the confusion is that the risk is viewed in terms of 
tapping a land phone line rather than recognizing that the nature of the risk 
has changed because cellular phones are not simply phones with long wires but 
a very different base technology.

This same confusion is the basis for the CNN story. As with Ann Landers, CNN 
itself is confused. First it reported the story as if this is a new problem 
that occurs only far away in the Philippines. The issue is a simple one -- 
assigning duplicate ESN numbers to phone. The "legitimate" excuse is that 
multiple ESN's are simply a way to allow a relative to use your number 
without an additional monthly charge and the theft of service is viewed as 
the real threat. The loss was quoted as $1,000,000 a year -- obviously a 
serious underestimate. I would guess that the provider is attempting to 
minimize the fears. What was interesting was the terminology used mimicked 
landlines. In fact, they talked about using some one else's "line". The use  
of duplicate ESN's is also based on the model of adding an extension not 
recognizing the complexities of call routing.

Whatever the risks are of new technologies, viewing them in terms of the old 
technology adds a new level of risk and confusion.

As an aside, I'll give the local Cellular One provider (SW Bell) credit for 
having a companion phone charge of just $10/month. But, in general, I'm 
frustrated by getting a separate bill for each number as opposed to having an 
account.  This is a different aspect of the inability of the Telcos to move 
beyond a model of single line phone service to the home. (OK, Sprint and some 
others supposedly do have smarter ways of handling this).

Of course, there are those that would view this difficulty in changing models 
as what keeps technology from changing too fast and is thus a way to reduce 
risk.

The oft discussed risk of EM RF radiation to devices like pacemakers can now
sport a case of anti-risk. A 42-year old man of The Hague (Netherlands)
collapsed in front of a swimming pool when his pacemaker failed. A police
officer in the vicinity radioed for help, and as soon as he did, the pacemaker
started working again. The officer was able to keep the man alive until an
ambulance arrived by using his transceiver.....

    Clarinet reports that Spyglass, Inc. has signed a licensing agreement with
the NCSA for the right to work with, enhance, and redistribute versions of
Mosaic as a commercial product.

    The obvious risk comes in the confusion that could ensue with some people
thinking that their commercial version is also freeware, and distributing it,
or some people getting in trouble for distributing the free version because
someone else thinks it's the commercial version.  Also, there are risks due to
the differing feature sets provided by each.

    The more menacing risks (to my thinking, at least) come from the fact that
Spyglass will be working on some security and authentication systems to allow
credit card transactions over the net.  I am highly dubious of the www's
ability to safely protect credit card transactions (although I could think of
ways this could be handled, I do not trust a browser system that was not
originally designed with highly secure transmission in mind).

    Also, sources to various NCSA projects are not particularly difficult to
find (I found Telnet on wuarchive, and I've seen Mosaic at CMU) - with access
to Mosaic sources people could build fakes of the commercialized Mosaic to
trap credit card numbers.

I recently had the opportunity to discuss at length the various RISKS Digest
pieces on air safety and computer controls with a relative who is an
experienced military and civilian industry pilot.

He agreed with the thrust of the threads here, but added a specific and
general comment about the A-320.

Specifically he noted that the greatest problem with the aircraft is that it
is unique in lacking a unified "off switch" for the autopilots. All other
aircraft have one control that can be flipped or pressed that will turn off
the computer pilot(s) and return control to the aircraft.  Apparently doing
this in the A-320 is no small matter.

Generally, though he and other pilots like the A-320, it is known for having a
"mind of its own" literally. Most pilots, according to my relative, have
stories of the plane suddenly "up and deciding to begin an approach, go around
or enter a traffic pattern" It seems amusing usually, but then my relative had
never had it happen low to the ground....

        Barbara Simons, chair of the USACM committee recruited me to organize
this panel a little over a year ago, after the announcement of the escrowed
encryption initiative.  Barbara provided suggestions for candidate panel
members, but allowed me complete freedom in inviting panel members.  Barbara
also pointed me towards Susan Landau as a candidate staff member to support
the panel, and I am especially grateful for that recommendation as Susan has
done a tremendous job in writing this report, from inputs provided by the
panel members, from her own research, and through extensive editing sessions
including all of the panel members.

        The panel I assembled is intentionally a mix of individuals with
represent differing perspectives on the complex issues surrounding crypto
policy.  These individuals work for a variety of organizations, including
government agencies, academia, commercial and non-profit organizations. These
organizations graciously donated the participants' time so that they could
participate in this activity.  The panel members did not represent these
organizations in the production of this report, but rather contributed as
individuals.

        The panel members worked together in a cooperative effort to produce a
consensus report.  Not all panel members agree with all of the statements
contained in this report and the report contains no policy recommendations,
because of the diverse panel membership.  The report distinguishes between
facts, opinions and speculation.  It provides a very balanced discussion of
many of the issues that surround the debate on crypto policy, and we hope that
it will serve as a foundation for further public debate on this topic.  I
personally became better informed about some of these issues as a result of
working on this report and I suspect many of the panel members also gained
personally from their participation.

        The statement of the USACM committee, which Barbara will read, and
which is available in hardcopy form, should be viewed as independent of this
report.  The USACM committee reviewed this report, and suggested a variety of
changes, some of which were acted upon while others were not.  Both the panel
and the USACM committee agree on the need for continued public debate on this
topic.  However, the specific recommendations of the USACM committee do not
reflect the consensus views of the panel nor are they necessarily supported by
the contents of this report.  The press, policy makers, and the public should
read the report and use it as a starting point in reaching their own
conclusions about these issues.

&gt;And as the cells get smaller, the location detail gets better.  ...

While recently cruising the WWW, one of the people here discovered a location
in England using active pagers to track their staff in the building.  While
some of it was best guess on our part, There was definitely some kind of
meeting going on, since many of the staff were identified as being in a
conference room(even which phone was closest to their location.)  From our
observations, it looks like there is no "cell" for either the hallways, or the
rest rooms.  There was however, identification of those last spotted at the
car park exit, and how long they had been out of the building.

The question of phone records is an interesting one.  On one hand, there's the
release of records to law enforcement under court action.  There are many
cases where this is important to the solving of a crime and the merits need to
be determined in each individual case.

What I found disturbing in the recent Simpson situation was the *television
station* getting the records and airing them (complete with numbers exposed)
so rapidly.  I've been unable to determine if the release of these records to
the station was somehow legal, or was completely under the table.  The station
had what appeared to be complete, detailed computer printouts in hand.

If you read your phone bill inserts carefully, you may have already received a
notice allowing you to choose whether or not you want your called number
information released to VENDORS of telecommunication services!  Apparently a
new FCC ruling requires this choice be made by subscribers--I believe it
defaults to "no call info" if the subscriber doesn't respond and has no prior
instructions on file.  Of course, this begs the issue of how widespread the
practice was of telcos and long distance companies handing out this info for
commercial purposes in the past.

In a report on the BBC last night (Tue July 5, 1994) the merits and RISKS of
the recent installation of a city centre wide television monitoring system in
Liverpool was discussed.

After the abduction and murder of James Bulger a year or so ago, most of the
residents of Liverpool were all in favour of having their movements monitored
by the bank of high resolution cameras, covering all streets in the main
centre of town.

A private company is in charge of the system, but the police (both local, and
as the report suggested, national) have instant access to any of the camera
views.  There was some discussion as to the dangers of companies,
organisations, and even the government obtaining access to these tapes to
discover who shops where, buys what, etc; yet by and large people seemed
willing to allow Big Brother to move in to combat crime and make the streets
safer.

The RISKS are obvious.  With enough crime, poverty, social decay, people may
be willing to assign away all personal freedom in the perhaps futile attempt
to recover the lost days of leaving your front door open and unlocked, and
your car window rolled down whilst you shop.

What is the legal position on this?  The article lists the factors used by the
program to make decisions: it does not consider the weighting given to these
factors.  The software could quite possibly be ignoring one or more of the
factors.  In the worst case, the software might just be considering the race
or sex of a police officer.  This would be blatent racism/sexism.  When race
and sex are combined with other factors to produce a criminality estimate does
not their inclusion still amount to sexism/racism?

If the program's output were to have any influence on the promotion prospects
of an individual and that individual could demonstrate that changing only
their race or sex (as inputs to the program rather than genetically!) moved
them into the non-potential-criminal group then would that not provide grounds
for them to claim discrimination and take whatever legal action was
appropriate?

I suspect that what Phil finds scary is that an unknown candidate (a la
Perot) can appear to each voter to be promising exactly what that voter
wants, and diametrically opposed voters could wind up voting for a
candidate who actually didn't intend to satisfy either of them.  With
broadcast media, there is some chance that everybody will see what the
candidate is promising other people.

It's not quite so scary when applied to a brand of perfume or motor oil,
maybe because they don't have fixed terms of office.

   [This would be a useful item for RISKS, so I am including 
   JAN's request here.  Please respond to him and CC: RISKS.  PGN]

I am interested in having our students in our Computer Professionalism course
do a homework writing assignment related to the development of environmentally
favorable machines, systems, etc.  While there has been some newspaper
articles about the "clean-up" of Silicon Valley and the hazards of working in
computer manufacturing environments, there seems to be little in the
"technical" press.  I am looking therefore to collecting a bibliography of
articles which address these topics -- including not only hazards and clean
up, but also references to "Green Machines".  Along the same line there has
been some references to VDT radiation and RSI but I do not know of a
bibliography in this area.

Your assistance is sought.

"Repetitive Strain Injury", Pascarelli, 1994, 0-471-59533-0, U$18.50
 
My first actual case of repetitive strain injury (or RSI), as a first aid
attendant, was not in the logging camps, railway gangs or spacing crews, but
with a young student athlete at an outdoor school.  He had, literally, outdone
himself the day before on a steep downhill hike.  He was one of the best jocks
in the school and had no problems with stairs and hill climbs--none of which
had prepared him for the repeated extension of his foot which downhill walking
required.
 
Work-related repetitive strain injury has been known for a long time now. 
Writer's cramp shows up in an Italian treatise almost three hundred years old. 
Research and treatment, however, has lagged.  For one thing, RSI generally
involves soft tissue damage which does not show up on x-rays (or, indeed, on
anything much besides microscopic examination of the tissue).  For another, few
jobs up until this century have required the kind of environment where actions
had to be repeated so often without variation.  Until very recently, the most
common repetitive strain situations involved gross motor activities, where
strains showed up early and responded well to exercise.  With the advent of the
computer keyboard and data entry as major factors in job situations, RSI has
become a serious issue in the workforce.
 
This is a comprehensive, factual and practical guide to RSI.  It is directed
primarily to the computer user or repetitive strain injury sufferer, covering
facts about RSI, symptoms and warning signs, diagnosis, choosing a physician,
recovery, legal aspects, maintenance and prevention.  A major emphasis is to
put users/sufferers in charge of, and responsible for, their own health.
 
The book continually counsels patience.  My student athlete, when asked if he
could walk out with the rest of the group, visibly tried to calculate how much
better he could be in the three days before they had to leave.  I had to ask
him if he could do it right then, since I knew it wasn't going to heal very
fast, and he had to admit he couldn't.  His case was actually extremely mild,
after only a few hours, and would have faded within a week or so of reduced
activity.  Most RSI cases, however, traumatize the area for months or even
years, and the healing process is correspondingly lengthy.
 
Although the book is written for users, I would strongly recommend that every
manager get a copy.  Averaged over all employees, RSI accounts for about $200
expense per year and per person.  If you have four people working for you,
using computers, it is almost certain that at least one will develop RSI at
some point.  RSI is almost entirely preventable, and is almost entirely caused
by ignorance.  Most of you reading this are probably nodding your heads and
muttering something about carpal tunnel syndrome--unaware that this over-
diagnosed syndrome actually accounts for only one percent of RSI, according to
one study cited in the book.
 
Highly recommended.   A very minor investment in keeping free of an ailment
which could severely affect your job--not to mention everything else you do
with your hands and body.

Subject: "Computer Ethics" by Forester/Morrison

"Computer Ethics", Forester/Morrison, 1994, 0-262-56073-9, U$14.95
 
As a collection of stories on computer crime and problems, this is fascinating
and wide ranging.  As a text on the social, ethical and professional issues
facing the information technology community, it is interesting and possibly
provoking.  As a textbook for a course on computer ethics it lacks analysis,
ethical background and structure.  The sub-title, "Cautionary Tales and Ethical
Dilemmas in Computering," is much more descriptive of the book.  It is full of
"tales"; a cross between "Spectacular Computer Crimes" and "Digital Woes".  The
ethical dilemmas are an add-on, but generally well written.  As a adjunct in a
course on computer ethics, or the social implications of technology, it would
certainly hold students' attention.  The authors seem to be slightly too aware
of this.  The preface states that the authors found computing students to lack
"awareness of social trends, global problems, or organizational issues," and
that the book had been correspondingly directed to the closer details of what
students would face on a daily basis.  One can sympathize with the frustrations
the authors must have felt, but this very example would seem to indicate that
students must be given a broader view of society rather than a narrower one.
 
Chapter one gives a good introduction and overview, as well as a brief
explanation of the major current ethical philosophies.  It is, unfortunately,
the last statement on ethics that is made.  Until chapter nine, a set of
scenarios for classroom discussion, the remainder of the book is the various
tales, padded with a thin structure of observations from other writings. 
Chapter two covers computer crime.  It has a slight tendency to edge towards
the border of the hacking/cracking/phone phreak topic, but the discriminating
reader will note what law enforcement agencies generally find:  most computer
crime is an inside job.  Chapter three deals with software theft and notes,
perhaps a bit smugly, the litigious mess of the American software industry. 
(The authors hail from Australia and Singapore, respectively.)  Chapter four
explores "Hacking and Viruses" and, given the confusion of hacking with
computer abuse, is more than slightly confused.  Chapter five looks at issues
of computer reliability or the lack thereof.  Chapter six purports to deal with
invasion of privacy, but spends much of its time with computer errors and,
then, a significant space talking about workplace surveillance (which
anticipates chapter eight).  The examination of artificial intelligence, in
chapter seven, seems mostly to have been a recap of the reliability issues from
chapter five.
 
Instructors, even when simply using the book as a discussion starter, should be
on top of the subject.  The MacMag/Brandow virus appears, not in chapter four,
but in chapter three as an illustration of software piracy.  This indicates
that the authors have no understanding of viral spread.  Indeed, the authors
define a virus as a self-replicating program that causes damage--even though
three out of the five specific examples do no "damage".  A "trojan horse" is
also defined as a program that allows access to an already penetrated system--
with no mention of pretense, deceit or damage at all.  (The authors also report
the "Twelve Nasty (sic) Tricks" trojan as a virus, the "AIDS" extortion attempt
as a virus and the "Desert Storm" virus as fact.)
 
This book is definitely a good adjunct text for a social, ethical or
professional computing course.  It will definitely provide interesting
material.  It does not, however, provide the necessary background for such a
course without other materials.

This book is fun.  I mean, it starts out with the statement, "I would like to
start with a formal definition," followed by about a paragraph's worth of
symbolic logic, followed by, "So, much for that!"  I assume that the surface
joke is accessible to all: for those who know of the troubles Dr. Cohen has
had over the years with those who insist on an informal translation of his
work, it is doubly funny.  From that beginning right through to Appendix A (a
joke) the light tone is maintained throughout, and it makes for a thoroughly
enjoyable read.
 
Besides being fun, though, the book is solid material.  Possibly one could
raise quibbles over certain terms or minor details, but almost nothing of
substance.  The only halfway controversial point in the book is Dr. Cohen's
continued crusade on behalf of "benevolent" viral programs.  While I agree
that the concept is worth further study, Dr. Cohen has not yet applied the
rigour of his earlier work to proofs that such programming can be guaranteed
safe or that benevolent viral programs are the best way to accomplish the
examples used.
 
The material in the book will be accessible to any intelligent reader,
regardless of the level of computer knowledge.  The most benefit, however,
will be to those planning data security or antiviral policies and procedures.
They will find here a thoughtful, provoking and insightful analysis.

WIRES CROSS AS LOVERS DIAL M FOR MOTHER

LONDON, July 2 (Reuter) - A terrified British mother put police on red alert
after mistaking the sound of lovemaking for a cry for help from her daughter.
*The Independent* newspaper said on [July 2] that two accidental phone calls
woke the woman in Devizes, southern England, in the small hours of the
morning.  Hearing moaning, groaning and shouting, she dismissed the first as
an obscene call, but in the second she recognised her daughter crying: "Oh my
God," and heard a man's voice.

Convinced her daughter was being attacked in her bedroom 100 miles (160 km)
away, she dialed the emergency number 999 and a police squad sped to the
daughter's home to investigate.  "Officers rushed round and found she wasn't
being attacked -- in fact she was quite willing," a police spokesman said.
"They explained that during the moments of passion one of the couple
accidentally pushed the last-number redial button on the bedside telephone
with a toe.  Unfortunately on both occasions it was the girl's mother's phone
number," he said.  "This is a warning for other people -- if you're going to
indulge in this sort of thing, move the phone."

The mother and daughter have apologized to police for the confusion.

      [Reach out and toe someone?  This gives new 
      meaning to "having your buttons pushed".  
      And the mother was left to her own Devizes.  PGN]

On Saturday night, during Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals on ESPN, a
commercial for the Prodigy on-line computer service came on. They were
talking about how great the hockey game was, but it didn't compare to the
excitement available on Prodigy. They cut to the computer screen showing
Prodigy, and all of the sudden a big window came up on the screen, saying
"COMMUNICATION ERROR". Users of Prodigy say that when that happened, the
system locked up for almost a minute, then their screen went completely
blank. ESPN quickly cut away to another commercial.

The curse of the live demo!

On another ranch, AOL managed to get its main server building flooded,
knocking out the whole network for hours and denying email service for hours
more after that.  No word yet on lost data...  [You'd think after the mess

This time of year, taxes are far from mind.  That is until I received a letter
from the IRS stating that I had incorrectly figured the credit for child care
expenses on my 1993 return.  This is the first year my tax preparer, an
enrolled agent (EA), used the 1040PC format: only the necessary lines are
printed without descriptive text.  My EA checked and reports that the software,
Simply Tax by Computer Associates (CA) of MD, carried the incorrect figure to
line 4 of form 2441.  To my surprise, he said there were a number of such bugs
resulting in incorrect line transfers on other forms, but he corrected them
manually. What's the point of software that's automatically wrong? 
Interestingly, the software can print either the 1040PC version or a graphic
facsimile of the IRS forms.  When the graphic facsimile was printed, Simply Tax
calculated a second _different_ set of incorrect numbers.  I would have assumed
the program implemented a single algorithm, with different output options.  It
now appears that the software implements independent (and different)
calculations, depending on which output format is selected!  This complicates
the debugging task.

The RISK?  Aside from reliance on software that is revised every year (never
debugged?), the 1040PC version threatens to further obfuscate our tax system
and create a new elite of tax preparers.  Since I have my taxes prepared
professionally, the IRS no longer sends the forms and instructions.  How
comfortable will I be signing next years 1040PC, which I can not decipher, in
the face of suspected bugs?  The IRS is moving away from graphic facsimiles, so
that may no longer be an option.  In future, expect to file taxes by hand,
1040PC, or electronically.  Graphic facsimiles will be allowed only if
identical to the IRS form including the color of the ink (you'll need a full
color printer).  

My EA believes that the programmer was not a tax expert.  Unlike straight line
programming, tax forms have backwards references (to whit, my incorrect
transfer from line 25 to line 4 on the same form).  He suggests tax software be
tested by former IRS agents with experience preparing taxes for the public
(there are many such qualified individuals).

The IRS, with uncharacteristic understanding, is requiring only the tax and
interest, waiving the penalty for an "honest" error.  Have they recognized a
software bug?  My EA insisted on paying the interest (a paltry 0.5% per month).
 Apparently there is a preparer's code covering this.  CA, on the other hand,
is under no such obligation.  In most industries, a defective product is
exchanged, refunded or repaired by the seller.  With the short use life of tax
software, CA assumes no such liability.  According to one theory, profits are
maximized when the cost of quality assurance equals the cost of defective
returns.  When there is no cost to the seller for defects, quality will be
minimized  :-(

[Ben Wright, an attorney teaching the online seminar on The Law of Electronic
Commerce in the NCSAFORUM of CompuServe, has granted permission to post the
following article on signatures.  I recommend that it be posted in RISKS
because it addresses assumptions about the need for non-repudiation of

&lt;&lt;begin article&gt;&gt;

       THE VERDICT ON PLAINTEXT SIGNATURES:  THEY'RE LEGAL

Summary: Contrary to conventional wisdom, commercial law generally does not
require that a signature be "secure" to be legally effective.  That is good
news for e-mail, and electronic commerce in general.


By Benjamin Wright

According to the digital cognoscenti, the only legally effective way to sign
an e-mail message is to run it through a cryptographic algorithm (such as that
for DES or RSA), compute a mathematically unique authentication code,&lt;1&gt; and
append it to the message.  But if that's true, it will be many years before
real (legal) electronic commerce comes to e-mail users because very few people
authenticate their e-mail with cryptography.

But fortunately, that reading of the law is not true.  Many business e-mail
users already practice electronic commerce.  What's more, the law should
generally recognize and enforce it.


Forming Contracts

In commerce the central transaction is the contract.  Classically speaking, a
contract is born any time an offer (e-mail from Joe Nightclub owner: "Will you
make me three custom discs for $1000 and deliver next week?") meets acceptance
(e-mail from Artist: "Yes!").  Once a contract is formed, the law gives one
party a remedy if the other backs out.

The orthodox view is that a simple, wholly plaintext e-mail contract cannot be
enforced because it is not signed in a secure way and it will be impossible to
prove in court.  This excerpt from a popular magazine exemplifies the
orthodoxy:

     [C]onsider an attempt to create an enforceable contract by
     exchanging an E-mail offer and acceptance.  In the real world,
     exchanging letters of offer and acceptance does create an
     enforceable contract (assuming something of value is also
     eventually exchanged).  Unfortunately, without authentication
     techniques (e.g., digital signatures), E-mail agreements are
     probably unenforceable in court.  Under legal rules governing
     evidence and contracts, it's hard to prove the existence of a
     contract based on E-mail; fabricating an E-mail message is
     just too easy.&lt;2&gt;  

With all professional respect to the author of this passage, I disagree.  The
orthodoxy is wrong.

Many types of contracts do have to be signed, says a law called the Statute of
Frauds (which dates back to Seventeenth Century England),&lt;3&gt; but that law is
admirably liberal in its use of the term _signed_.  One signs a document when
he adopts a symbol (any symbol) on the document as his signature.  A signature
need not be in ink; it need not be an autograph; and it need not be the least
bit secure against forgery.  Remember the illiterate geezer in the western
movies who couldn't write his name?  He just marked an X on the document.  The
law recognizes that X as his signature.

A signature can be the ASCII characters "Joe Nightclub" appearing in plaintext
in the From line of an e-mail message.  "Joe Nightclub" need not even be the
sender's real name.  What is important is not the nature of the symbol Joe
uses to identify himself, but rather the intent behind the symbol.  If Joe
intends the characters to be a token of his responsibility, then they are his
signature.  When Joe sends e-mail offering to buy discs, he intends the
characters in the From line to show he is responsible for the message and the
consequences that flow from it.  If that's not his intent, what is it?

Along with Canada, Australia and many other countries, the United States
inherits the common law tradition of ancient England -- a set of living,
breathing principles that are more limber than you might think.  The common
law, being the law of the leading industrial civilization over the past
several centuries, has ample experience negotiating waves of new technology --
handwriting, printing press, typewriter, telegraph, telephone, telex, fax --
and it is today suffering no particular problems digesting e-mail as a medium
for transacting commerce.

Given how many thousands of courts and judges there are, it is possible that
the odd one will disagree with my reading of the law.  If this worries you
(and those conducting more valuable transactions might be worried), you can
minimize the risk by insisting that the e-mail sender include a statement that
his name in the e-mail is his signature.  This makes it very difficult for him
later to claim in court that his name, written in plaintext, is not his
signature.


Proving It

"But wait!" cry the advocates of cryptographic authentication.  You can't
prove that e-mail came from Joe Nightclub.  Anyone could have sent it.  The
Artist herself could have fabricated it.

True.  You can write e-mail and make it appear to come from someone
else.  You can easily send e-mail from an address opened under a
false name.  But just as you can send fake e-mail, so you can send
fake letters, telegrams, telexes, and faxes.

Nonetheless, regardless of the medium through which a business
message is carried, the origin and genuineness of the message can
usually be proven in court.  Rarely are they proven from the
signature that happens to be attached to the message (or document),
despite what you may think from watching _Perry Mason_.  Much more
often, origin and genuineness are determined in court from all the
facts and circumstances that surround the message -- the full
relationship of the people involved.

We don't do business in vacuums.  We do business based on
relationships.  When the Artist receives e-mail from Joe Nightclub,
she wants to learn more before she parts with her precious discs. 
If she's never dealt with this customer before, she's going to
check the guy out:  call him on the phone, go meet him, ask for
references, or ask for advance payment.  Lest she be a fool, the
Artist wants to collect evidence that this is a bona fide customer
who is very likely to pay as promised.

All the mundane facts and circumstances she collects can be,
through testimony and otherwise, used in court to lend credence to
Joe's e-mail.  Sure, there will be disputed evidence.  And under no
circumstances are the judge and jury guaranteed to believe that any
given message is genuine.  But that is just the way commercial law
works.  Proving things in law is much more sloppy than proving
things in science.


Forgeries

A supposed virtue of paper over e-mail as a legal medium is that it
is hard to make inconspicuous changes to paper, whereas plaintext
ASCII can easily be changed.  Upon receipt of Joe's e-mail offering
$1000, the Artist could change it to say the offer is for $2000. 
If she took this e-mail to court, there would be no way to tell
from the face of the message whether it originally said $1000 or
$2000.

Yet paper suffers the same infirmity.  If the Artist receives a
letter from Joe offering $1000, she could rip it up and write a
replacement, offering $2000, on a sheet of cheap, fake letterhead. 
She could then scribble something that purports to be Joe's
handwritten signature.  Later, a court could not tell from the face
of the document whether Joe did or did not send it.  Although Joe
would repudiate it, sternly declaring that neither the letterhead
nor the signature is his, the Artist would swear that this is
indeed the letter she received.  If this is not Joe's normal
letterhead and signature, she'd contend, then Joe must have sought
to deceive her, and the court, by sending an offer using unusual
letterhead and signature.  Although the Artist would be lying, the
court would not know it just from inspecting the letter.

Indeed, we can play the same authentication games with paper that
we can with plaintext e-mail.  When you receive a paper letter in
the mail, bearing what looks to be an original autograph, you have
no technical proof of its origin.  Neither do you have technical
proof of origin when you get a telegram or telex (unless you
require it be authenticated with a cipher code, which is rarely
done).  So the reality is that routine business communications are,
and have always been, risky.  Still, business traders seem to have
compensated for this risk.


Cryptography's Role 

Don't misunderstand.  I'm not denigrating cryptography as a means
for ensuring the authenticity of messages or denying its rightful
role in electronic commerce.  Just as the engraved and magnetized
paper used for currency is necessary for financial transactions in
the world of paper, so cryptographic authentication is needed for
electronic funds transfers.  But just as we don't securely engrave
and magnetize the pulp on which we write business letters and
contracts, so we don't need to cryptographically authenticate most
of our business e-mail.

Sure, if you use e-mail for business you should keep complete
records, and the more secure the records, the better.  Consult your
own lawyer.  If you work for a large organization, records can be
secured by placing them under the control of an independent
department (e.g., internal audit).&lt;4&gt;  But if you work solo, you
can just establish a routine for making a log of business messages
on your PC.  Yes, someone could claim you falsified your log.  But
if you faithfully keep the log as a regular business practice, you
can, if ever called to court, confidently vouch for the integrity
of your records, and your story will more likely jibe with the
ambient facts and circumstances.

It is ironic that some of the most ardent champions of e-mail are
so quick to assume that plaintext e-mail is somehow deficient.  If,
as they suggest, it is necessary to use fancy cryptographic methods
to make e-mail legal, then they ask much more of digital media than
we do of its predecessors.

=========
NOTES:

&lt;1&gt;  The proponents of cryptography often refer to unique
authentication codes as "message authentication codes" or "digital
signatures."  These are streams of scrambled numbers that, when
unscrambled using the necessary cryptographic keys, give
mathematically supportable evidence as to who created a message and
whether the message has changed.  See Larry Oyama, "Using
Encryption and Authentication for Securing Data," EDI Forum,
Special Edition on EDI Legal and Audit Issues (1992) p. 111.

&lt;2&gt;  Victor J. Cosentino, Virtual Legality, BYTE (March 1994) p.
278.

&lt;3&gt;  For example, the statute of frauds, as rendered in Section 2-
201 of the Uniform Commercial Code, says that a contract for the
sale of goods worth $500 or more is generally not enforceable
unless it is supported by a "writing" that is "signed."

&lt;4&gt;  See, Benjamin Wright, The Law of Electronic Commerce (Boston: 
Little, Brown and Company) Section 6.4.

Political prevarication is part of the scene, unfortunately, and part of the
reason that politicians are finding themselves faced with term-limit referenda
around the country.  (I support those movements.)  At the same time, I am not
"scared" by the prospect that Perot (or any other) might tell me "promises"
that are tailored for me and antithetical to the "promises" that he makes to
you.  Why?  The same technology that enables him to do that enables him to be
revealed.  Many of the people who get such tailored notes are going to compare
notes on public bulletin boards.  Prevarications, if they exist, will be
instantly revealed and the candidate discredited.  This will help prevent them
from getting elected.  Let them reveal their stripes early, I say.  Let the
prevaricators be detected before election, not after.

In Volume 16 : Issue 20 : <A HREF="mailto:pjt1@scigen.co.uk">pjt1@scigen.co.uk</A> (Piers Thompson) worries about the
legal implications of screening cops for attributes shared with bad cops, when
attributes include race and gender.

In machine learning work I once came across, techniques that automaticly build
decision processes were applied to known data to estimate students' expected
performance in college.  These techniques find the most
information-theoreticly useful attributes and use these to sort new instances.
It turned out that race was found to be a very useful attribute in making
predictions in this domain, but for political reasons the decision process had
to be doctored to exclude this.

I think similar things have been found in financial areas, eg., predicting
loan defaults.

(NB: Since present politics allows age and geographical discrimination, auto
insurance companies can and do use these properties in their assessments.)

An interesting report.  Even more interesting to me because I first read about
the efforts to instrument society w/ video cameras in a comic book about 5
years ago, and the comic had been written at least 10 years ago.  For those
interested in seeking it out, the comic was a limited series (perhaps 10
issues) called V for Vendetta.  It was written by an English author (I believe
it was Alan Moore) who had a 1 page editorial in one of the issues wherein he
decried the slide of English society into what he saw as facism.  In his
preface he wrote that he hoped to get himself and his family out of England as
soon as possible because of what he saw happening to society.  I believe he
specifically mentioned TV cameras on street corners, and these were definitely
central to the story.  They also had audio pickup capability, and vandalizing
them was a capital crime.  The story dealt with how the English gov't became
facist after a 3rd world war.  "V" is a lone hero (?) who bucks the system,
assassinating various gov't figures, with an ending I won't spoil for you.

Life imitates art.  The complete series is available at any decent comic book
store (check your yellow pages) or even a large book store, in bound, graphic
novel format.

   While buying a bag of cat food at a local PetCo, I was asked to sign my
credit card receipt upon the machine that printed the receipt out.  After the
receipt was torn from the machine, I noticed that I had written my signature
on a rubber pad of some sort.  I asked the young lady what exactly this was.

   She then went into a cheerful explanation of this machine, showing me how
it keeps a low resolution digitized "picture" of the customer's signature.
She put it into test mode and had it print her signature back out.

   Her final comment raised my eyebrows: the full system will simply digitize
the customer's signature and keep it as proof of purchase.  No second copy at
all -- the customer keeps what the customer signs.

   There are, however, a few bugs to fix first, she admitted.

   I haven't seen discussion of this machine before and casual examination of
the machine didn't reveal the name of the company that makes it.  I'm not
especially thrilled of the notion that someone can have a digitized version of
my signature.  Does anyone else have information about the machine and/or
comments on risks of this CC machine's use?

In Australia there is a code of practice for supermarkets that use scanners.

Here if the item scans at a price higher than the price shown on the shelf you
are entitled to receive that item free. If you are purchasing several of the
same item and this happens, you get one free and the rest at the lower price.

Of course supermarkets do not go out of their way to draw your attention to 
this, although some state it on a tiny sticker at each checkout.  A few months
ago an elderly couple who had some difficulty with English were ahead of me
in the checkout queue when one of their items scanned at a higher price they
complained, and the checkout operator's did not know about the code of
practice. I pointed out the store's stated policy to both the customers and
the operator, who then referred it to the supervisor.

If you want to avoid being ripped off at the checkout, find out if there is
such a code of practice in your area, and make sure your supermarket sticks
to it.  If they don't, make a complaint or go someplace else.

27 Hurt in Roller-Coaster Train Crash
By Victoria Combe, London Daily Telegraph, 8 July 1994

More than 20 people were hurt last night in an accident on the world's highest
and fastest roller-coaster at Blackpool's Pleasure Beach.  Two trains on the
new 12 million pounds ride, The Big One, collided 30 feet above ground.  Eight
passengers, trapped by jammed safety bars, had to be cut free.  27 people were
taken to hospital with minor injuries, while others were treated for shock.
The ride's computer-driven trains reach 85 mph but had slowed to 40 mph when 
the crash happened.

The Pleasure Beach said "One train collided with the rear of another which had
stopped in the braking system.  "At the moment we have no idea how this could
have happened.  The fullest enquiries are being undertaken."  Mr Geoffrey
Thompson, the Managing Director said: "I have asked the American designer to
return as quickly as possible.  Until then the ride will be shut."

On the roller-coaster's first day, May 28, 30 people were trapped 235 feet 
up after a fault in the computer system.

  [Mr Thompson said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning that the 
  collision had taken place at 5 or 6 mph, not 40 mph.  (quote from memory)]

Jonathan Moffett  Dept of Computer Science  University of York, UK

   [5 or 6, not 40?  Big difference!  But probably not 50 or 60...  
   American designer, eh?  Perhaps the same one that did the Timber Wolf
   at KC's Worlds of Fun (<A HREF="/Risks/9.96.html">RISKS-9.96</A>) and Hercules at Dorney Park 
   (<A HREF="/Risks/14.83.html">RISKS-14.83</A>), both of which had crashes?  PGN]

[...] Because the passengers needed to be cut out, I would assume that the
safety bars worked as designed (they failed locked rather than failed open,
especially important for the inverted loops), though an unlocking
mechanisms may have been a useful addition.

The essence of this 1040PC RISK is that a signature on the 1040PC does not
indicate that the filer understands and agrees with what it says.  A readable
version is absolutely required to make an informed decision. I prepared my
1040 with personal tax software this year and submitted 1040PC. I keep printed
copies of the full return as well as the PC version for my records. They
matched up well enough to sign.

I find it incredible that a preparer only provided the PC version for review
and signature.  At the very least the preparer should submit both versions for
review. In Craig Smith's case, this would have flagged the fact that buggy tax
prep software was being used.  If the two didn't match, he shouldn't have
signed either, and perhaps should have looked for a different preparer.

Today, the IRS accepts their own printed forms, facsimiles produced by
particular software packages, 1040PC, and electronic filing.  For years, the
IRS has accepted facsimile forms generated on "letter quality" dot matrix as
well as plain laser printers. They have _never_ required reproduction the
colors appearing on their original forms.  While I believe the IRS will widen
their use of machine readable input, I don't believe the IRS could eliminate
readable forms even if they wanted to.  There are too, too many people in this
country that just don't get it when it comes to encoded line numbers and other
such intangible stuff. They'd suffer a really sharp rise in compliance
problems if they eliminated "real" forms (a similar argument applies to the
likelihood of a completely cashless society).

I have been a consumer of tax software for several years and have some
perspective on the problem with "bugs." The bottom line is that the tax
software vendor had better not sell buggy software two years in a row, or
nobody will come back for Year 3. There is a competitive market for tax
software and unreliable products suffer a deserved disadvantage.

Regarding "endorsement" of tax programs, there does seem to be a process by
which the IRS will "approve" the appearance of signable forms generated by
various tax programs. There's no implication that they approve of the
programs' tax computations, just the appearance of critical forms like 1040.

&gt;Apparently there is a preparer's code covering this.  CA, on the other hand,
&gt;is under no such obligation.  In most industries, a defective product is
&gt;exchanged, refunded or repaired by the seller.

While there's no legal obligation, and CA may not have such a policy, note
that some other tax software vendors do.  I believe ChipSoft promises to pay
any penalties you incur due to a miscalculation by Macintax or Turbotax.

It often seems to take people by surprise when they realize how lightly
secured voter authentication is in most elections.  Thomas Rushton's note,
and some of the replies in 16.15, are typical examples.  This concern,
coupled with deep cynicism about politics, leads people to generalize
this "lack" of security into a vision of a risky process open to easy
fraud and stolen elections.  But this conclusion is wrong.

I'm not specifically familiar with voter authentication and balloting
practices in the UK, Canada or Massachusetts.  What is described, though,
sounds substantially similar to practices here in Michigan, where I have
been a voter, an election worker, and a county commissioner.

Michigan voters receive a voter registration card, but it plays no role
in the actual voting process.  Indeed, no identification card of any
kind is required; if presented, it is waved away.

The voter fills out a slip of paper with name, address and signature.
Supposedly, the signature on the slip is verified against the signature
in the voter files.  In truth, almost any signature will do.  The
training for election workers doesn't discusses this step; especially
in busy precincts, the signature may not even be glanced at.  In any
case, the card with the voter's official signature is a public record,
which anyone could have inspected prior to election day.

Another way to "spoof" the process would be to register to vote multiple
times -- no proof of identity is required.

Thus, it would be easy for a miscreant to vote twice, three times, a
dozen times.  So why aren't we worried about this?

The fact is that Michigan's election laws have evolved over a century
and a half of responding to different kinds of fraud and vote buying
schemes.  (For example, if a voter reveals or displays his ballot in
the polling place, it is invalid.)  Most other jurisdictions have had
similar experiences.  Considering both the laws and the practicalities,
effective vote fraud is very difficult to do.

First, the law: vote fraud is a felony.  The penalties are in the same
range with things like arson and armed robbery.  Certainly there are
people who are willing to commit felonies, but most people are not.
The public thinks of vote fraud as being a crime of serious moral
turpitude, something more like stealing cars than exceeding the speed
limit.  Moreover, a perpetrator of vote fraud is at serious risk of
being caught; and the more people who are involved, the greater the
risk.  On the other hand, the fewer people who are in on it, the more
difficult it is to "spoof" a sizable number of false votes.

The nature of the political scene magnifies this problem.  Practically
by definition, someone who wants to commit vote fraud has to be a person
with some investment in the political process.  Scoffing about politicos
aside, practically all of them are strongly motivated to avoid any taint
of criminal activity.  Though there have been cases where a sitting
officeholder has been re-elected despite indictment or conviction, on
the whole it usually spells the end to one's political career.  Further,
a felony conviction in many states (though not Michigan) terminates
one's voting rights as well.

But there's still another problem: until the vote totals start to
appear, it is never clear how many stolen votes would be needed, and
for whom.  Polling can't tell you this -- not with the requisite
degree of precision.  The costs and risks of vote fraud are pointless
if your candidate is winning anyway, or losing by too wide a margin.

Effective election stealing (with a minimum of co-conspirators) requires
knowing exactly how many votes you need.  Thus, it has to be an "inside
job" and happen AFTER the polls close.

The most famous American vote fraud of all time, Lyndon Johnson's
stolen victory in the 1948 Democratic primary runoff for U.S. Senator
from Texas, took place AFTER it was known that Johnson was 115 votes
behind his opponent, Coke Stevenson.  Word was passed to George Parr,
the infamous "Duke of Duval," with a plea to come up with at least
that number of votes; and Ballot Box #13, Alice TX (with 202 votes
for Johnson and none for Stevenson) showed up THREE DAYS after the
election.  LBJ was declared the winner by 87 votes.

I'd guess that Texas in 1948 was far more corrupt than any state is today.  In
any case, the political process *does* sometimes learn from experience; the
most exacting safeguards in election law have been built around the
(vulnerable) tabulation and reporting phase.

The social implications of street-corner (etc.) cameras have been the subject
of literary exploration for much longer than 10 years.  For a particularly
deep (though not exceptionally old) fiction treatment I refer you to David
Drake's stories about a character named Jed Lacey, last collected in full I
believe in a paperback titled "Lacey and his Friends."  Drake explores the
implications of cameras everywhere.  Just to name one, people might be forced
to share their living and work space with many others to minimize the number
of cameras required (separate offices would require many cameras, bullpens
could be covered by a few).  Mark Seecof &lt;<A HREF="mailto:marks@latimes.com">marks@latimes.com</A>&gt;

The issue of screening is an old one. I've already pointed, in RISKS, that
arrest records are probably a very good predictor of whether one is guilty.
But arrest records are not conviction records! Some of the problems arise
because such statistical analysis denies the individual's ability to depart
from the stereotypes. If I was once mistaken for someone who robbed a liquor
store because I happened to have a beard at some point in my life, am I now
less entitled to protect from unreasonable searches? Or does my profile mean
that I am now subject to extra scrutiny.

I might accept the idea of a profile in airport security fallible thought the 
approach is). I'm much more reluctant to accept it if it denies an individual 
opportunity. 

Of course, this assumes that the statistics and analysis are meaningful -- a 
very big assumptions.

[re the Spyglass version of Mosaic, and using it for credit card transactions]

There are several licensees of Mosaic who are building their own enhanced
versions of the program.  As far as I can tell, the primary security feature
that is likely to be added is some sort of public key digital signature, so
a client can send a message to a server in a presumably unforgeable way.

&gt;    Also, sources to various NCSA projects are not particularly difficult to
&gt;find (I found Telnet on wuarchive, and I've seen Mosaic at CMU) - with access
&gt;to Mosaic sources people could build fakes of the commercialized Mosaic to
&gt;trap credit card numbers.

This Trojan Horse threat is indeed a possible one, although it seems to me
that the same "safe software" techniques that one uses to avoid getting a
virus with one's PC software would be appropriate to avoid getting Trojan
Mosaics.

PS re Trojan Mosaics: Actually, most of the mosaics in that part of the world
are Byzantine, but from what I've heard about the internals of the Mosaic
source code, we have a Byzantine Mosaic now.

In the July 6th 1994 issue of our local paper - The San Bernardino
Sun-Telegram there is an odd letter from one Daniel Jeffs of Apple Valley,
date June 29th.

I'm not sure if I'm seeing evidence of the RISK of luddite paranoia or a
useful early warning of a real risk to the public. It states that Bill Gates
"is authoring a book about the information highway" which "will provide you
with a left-handed warning about what's in the works for us" [...] "your PC
will be miraculously be replaced and transformed into your PE(Personal
enslaver) and PD (personal demon)"[...].

So far I'd suspect a clever publicity stunt... but the letter ends with an
appeal for "unselfish foresight and vision"[...]"traffic controls of
public policy in the hands of all people"[...]

So 
(1) Does Bill Gates vision actually imply a RISK worse than any other
		vision?
(2) Have similar letters been appearing in other local papers - a mail
		merged version of internet spamming?

The confirmation of the A330 crash stated that "the altitude of the aircraft
was too low to avoid impact with the ground."

Perhaps there is additional information that was withheld in the name of
brevity, but why would Airbus conduct such an amazingly dangerous test so
bloody close to the ground? If they were just after maximum aft centre of
gravity, high angle of attack, and maximum climb, why couldn't they do the
same at 2000 metres? At least until they got it right at altitude, and only
*then* bring it down to ground level and simulate it shortly after a real
takeoff.

Perhaps we in the software industry should take a cue from Airbus. For
instance, network software developers should start testing their pre-alpha
catastrophic failure recovery code on live heavily-trafficked networks...

Air et Cosmos, 11-24 Juillet 1994, p15, contains an extensive report on the
A330 accident of 30 June 1994 by Jean-Pierre Casamayou.  The general story has
been reported by Peter Mellor (<A HREF="/Risks/16.19.html">RISKS-16.19</A>). The new info is highly relevant,
and implies that control of the aircraft was lost while the aircraft was under
automatic control.  This is the first case, to my knowledge, in which this has
been proved to have happened to Airbus aircraft, without any concomitant pilot
error.  Sadly, the test pilots allowed the departure from control to continue
for up to 12 seconds in order to analyse the incident. This delay was gallant
but fatal. That's the English for you (RIP Capt. Nick Warner).

The autopilot was using experimental software. This A330 was
undergoing a flight test required for certification of the autopilot
for Category III operations with Pratt and Whitney 4168 engines (the
other A330's already in operation use CF6-80E1's, and such equipment
has already been through this particular flight test sequence).
Category III operations mean use of the autopilot for landing, up to
and including main gear on the runway, and requires special
certification of both aircraft and crew. It follows that a Category
III operation can potentially be aborted, i.e. the pilots can select
go-around while under autopilot contol, with the main gear on the
runway, and in the worst case an engine can fail at this point. One
can see why it's required to conduct this test from an actual takeoff,
rather than at altitude.

The flight was supposed to test the mode SRS (speed reference system)
of the autopilot, which should control the speed and angle of attack
(AoA) of the aircraft in case of an engine-out. AoA is defined to be
the angle that the wing makes with the undisturbed airflow in front of
the wing. The test was performed at rearmost center-of-gravity.  

Following is a translation of a continuous fragment of the article. I have
included the originals of phrases I am unsure of. My thanks to Pete Mellor for
confirmation of some of the meanings.  I don't have a dictionary of French
aeronautical terms (although such exist, and they're quite large).  It refers
to the following `V-speeds', defined in FAR Subchapter A Part 1 Para 1.2 for
those in the US.  V_1 is takeoff decision speed (the speed at which the
decision is made to abort or to continue takeoff in the case of engine
failure); V_R is rotation speed (the speed at which the pilot commands
nose-up); V_2 is takeoff safety speed (the speed at which the airplane may
takeoff safely, even with one motor out); V_{mca} is the minimum single-engine
control speed (the speed at which control of the aircraft may be maintained
with one engine out).

[begin translation] 

The takeoff (V_1 = V_R = 126kts and V_2 = 135kts) took place at 136kts, 25
seconds after full power was arrived at (`la mise en plein piussance des
moteurs'], then the aircraft took its speed of climb of 150 kts. After the
takeoff, an altitude of 600m QNH (roughly 460m QFE) was selected on the flight
director FCU [the Flight Director on the A330 is called the FCU. pbl] This
means that the aircraft should restore level flight [`retablir en palier'] at
450m from the ground.

Conforming to the test order, the pilot attained a speed of 150 kts, and 28
degrees AoA in order to maintain this speed. Six seconds after takeoff, the
autopilot was engaged, then the left engine retarded and the corresponding
hydraulic pump cut to simulate a complete failure of the left engine. As
predicted, the AoA began to diminish and passed from 29 degrees to 25 degrees,
the limit authorised by the FMGES (Flight Management Guidance and Envelope
System) which protects the flight envelope. But quickly, because of the low
altitude selected on the FCU, the autopilot departed from mode SRS and entered
mode ALT-STAR, the mode for acquisition and retention of altitude, in which
mode the autopilot tries to attain altitude as quickly as possible, without
taking into account the limiting conditions that the airplane was in: rearmost
CoG, one engine retarded and the other at full power, high `incidence'
[another word for AoA. pbl] [this is not a good explanation of ALT-STAR mode.
pbl].  Result: the AoA started to increase again, and the speed decreased
extremely quickly [`brutalement'].

The flight team noted immediately the anomaly, but purposely let the situation
degrade for about 12 seconds, in order to analyse it better, as is their role.
The AoA attained 33 degrees with speed decaying to 100kts, which is 18kts less
than V_{mca}, the minimum single engine control speed . At this moment, the
pilot disconnected the autopilot and took over control.  But the speed
continued to decrease. At about 90 kts, 28kts less than V_{mca}, the aircraft
departed in a stall [`part en decrochage'] to the left with an angle of bank
[`angle de roulis'] which attained 110 degrees.

The pilot reacted quickly and well in retarding the right engine then bringing
the wings horizontal. Unfortunately, because of the low altitude and fast
rater of descent, he couldn't avoid impact with the ground, 35 seconds after
takeoff.

On the ACM Crypto Policy Statement -- to which I strongly agree - and all the
discussions on Clipper and associated phenomena, I would like to state my
opinion with my European mind and my European trust in some of our
authorities; in this case our Police authorities.  All the meddling of the
National Security Agencies ( not only the U.S.A.'s NSA ) with reference to
Sealing, Signing -- and last but certainly not least -- Encryption is very
hard to understand, as for their own and MIL data/voice traffic these
authorities up to now use their own means.  They want to go COTS ( Commercial
Of The Shelf ), but have a problem in stating the categories of "time of
protection" wanted for strategical, tactical and 'national interest'
information, thereby making it difficult for COTS-suppliers to help them out
the "COTS" way.

RE: The "listening in" part: 

1) For some purposes, one could even make a statement through "clear"
    telephone, which has a different meaning to the intended recipient; thus
    "listening in" is of 'no' use, even for a "clear" communication
2) It is a "bloody shame", and the CEC-INFOSEC ( European Commission-
     INFOSEC ) people know my opinion on that for a log time now, that not
    all data-communications is enciphered in some "standardised" way, just to 
    have a 'general' barrier against 'criminal energy'. 
    The adversary then has to spend processing power = money to decipher
    and will loose out by using money on -- for him -- unuseable information.
3) The only way, to solve the legal part, is NOT to forbid encryption, but
    provide legislation on the obligation of 'handing' over the required info
    on mechanism(s), algorithm(s), and key(s) used, if required -- case by 
    case -- in proven law cases [ to be edited by a lawyer, specialised on 
    the subject ]
4) Just as a reaction on what is going on, the use of PGP ( even 2.6 ) is 
    exploding over here; and a European EFF will be there within short.
5) Furthermore many European RSA-based, FEAL-based and "other"-based
    products are on the market, and in use ! 

RE: Relation to "Police Forces", including e.g. Criminal Investigation Teams:

Apparently the some European Police Forces, and related Forces, are still
considered -- in general -- to be the "friends" of the population, by the
population.  The requirements for reaching such a relation with the 'public'
are:
- to be "of assistance to the public"
- trustworthy staff
- to be a trustworthy organisation, accompanied by a free press and 
  political will
- to be supported by the judicial apparatus, for the Forces to stay motivated
- a "quality of life" worth defending it

We will need a lot of "trustworthy" energy to protect us -- and our children
-- against "criminal" energy.

Our Police organisations use several means to protect access to their various
Databases, and this protection has to be the strongest available, because of
the 'real risks' involved.

 
I fully agree with the following statements in the article by Ted Bunker in
LAN Magazine of August 94:

- "We must give our full support to the development of OPEN international
  security standards, that protect the interests of all parties fairly

- There is a "constant" tension between the need for privacy and the need
  for protection

- We do have serious privacy concerns
   - NOTE: e.g. when a Police official is performing an SQL request on a 
     number plate, the official in the van should only get information on:
                   - whether the car is looked for
                   - whether the probable driver is looked for
                   - whether the probable driver might be armed
                   and nothing more, surely not the address of the pretty lady-driver ! 

Do NOT get me wrong:
- I also fell victim to injustice ( to my opinion ) in a case versus an 
  'official'.
- I even have been insulted in writing by a member of the Council of Ministers.
But, we have to trust ( and at the same time: control ) the forces which
should protect the "law-abiding" ( or = sullen ? ) citizen, and are paid by
that same citizen to do so !  Might be the price of "democracy".

&gt; ...  Do we really need to require users to show their identification
&gt;papers before they can participate on the Internet?

Your reaction is naive.  The short answer is yes.

However, there is no *the internet*, what you refer to is an internetwork of
internetworks. The current popular conception is to have one huge internetwork
that serves all needs and desires of all participants all the time in all of
its parts. In short - I don't think so.

Just as we zone our physical space, we must zone our data-space.  Our
internetworked services and data-spaces, must provide proper security in the
form of authentication and authorization for those transactions that
absolutely require such. Our internetworked services and data-spaces, need not
provide over-zealous security with absolute authentication and authorization
for those transactions that don't requier it. ( or where such is undesirable).

This whole ball of wax falls into what I call The Un-real estate business.

     [No, I did NOT make this post up!!!   Elana]
&gt; ...  I heard that if you had high enough RF power
&gt;you could disturb the electric fuel pump, so I tried this one day using
&gt;a 600 Watt PEP amp and keyed an AM carrier, and what did I see???

SOMEBODY is making this up!  1963 VW Bugs had a MECHANICAL fuel pump (a fact I
am totally certain of).  I believe VW Bugs at least until the 1970's had a
mechanical fuel pump.

Good story, but only a story.

There was a piece under the above headline in the Times (a UK quality paper)
on 5 July. The byline is Adam Fresco.

`Prisoners at a top security jail beat an expensive security system using a
mirror and a piece of wire to join each other in late-night card games.
Inmates at Albany prison on the Isle of Wight had been roaming around at night
for weeks, unknown to staff.

`The sophisticated computerised security system was designed to end slopping
out by allowing one prisoner at a time from each landing to go to the toilet
during the night. [Sanitation is not the UK prison system's strong point,
prisoners usually have to make do with a bucket in the corner of the cell,
even if there are 2 or 3 people in the cell.  Buckets are `slopped out' into a
drain in the morning. PJI] By pressing a button in his cell, a prisoner was
allowed out for a certain amount of time. When he returned he was supposed to
punch in a number which would appear on a console inside his cell and the door
would lock.  The computer would then let the next inmate out.

`However, the prisoners were staying outside their cells, shutting the door
and threading a wire though the hinge to tap in the required number, which
they could see through the mirror, set up before they closed the door. The
computer, thinking the prisoner was back in his cell, would let the next
person out.

`The prisoners were found out when they made too much noise one night.  An
astonished guard discovered three of them in one cell playing cards.

`Max Morrison, the governor, has started an enquiry into the incidents and has
turned off the system, which has been installed in other prisons around the
country. A Home Office [the government department responsible PJI] spokesman
declined to comment on the cost of the equipment, which was installed a few
months ago, but confirmed that the computer system had been suspended and
alternative sanitation arrangements introduced.'

CBS Evening News just reported that Clinton has "tentatively signed off" on a
National ID card recommended to him by a commission on immigration reform. The
ostensible reason for the card is for employment and immigration.  Each card
will contain a name, photo, mag stripe with info and a "verified SSN." It was
supported by Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, a long-time supporter of ID
cards. Gov. Pete Wilson of California has apparently offered to make
California a test-bed for the proposal.  The proposal was opposed by Xavier
Beccera, a Congressman from California.  A previous effort to impose a
national ID card was rejected by Congress in 1986.

EPIC is working with Privacy International to investigate this report. PI has 
led successful campaigns against national ID cards in Australia, New Zealand, 
and the Philippines. 
  
In Australia, the PI-led campaign led to the dissolution of both houses of the
federal Parliament in 1987 after hundreds of thousands marched in protest. The
Australian campaign brought together groups from all parts of the political
spectrum from the Communist Party to the Libertarian Alliance, farmers and
conservation groups, rock stars, academics, large businesses such as banks and
mining corporations, but the overwhelming support came from the public who
created the biggest civil protest in Australian history.

The spring issue of the liberal journal "The American Prospect" includes a
detailed critique of policy simulation programs such as SimCity.  The full
reference is:

  Paul Starr, Seductions of Sim: Policy as a simulation game, The American
  Prospect 17, Spring 1994, pages 19-29.

The gist is that the real politics of policy and its implementation are much
more complicated than the basic framework of such simulations can possibly
accommodate.

The following comes from _New Scientist_, 21 May 1994.

FEEDBACK

JOHANNA Darlington often watches the news on television with her mother, who
is deaf and relies on teletext to follow what is broadcast. Darlington has
discovered that the words spoken by the news-caster and the words on the
teletext frequently disagree with each other in surprising ways. Over the past
18 months she has culled a list of teletext "translations", some of which we
give below. The first words in the list are what the newscaster said, the
second are the teletext version:

   initially: in Italy
   romantics: Roman tricks
   Europe:    querp
   Liverpool: limp pool
   nutrition: new electrician
   psychologist: sigh ecologist
   semblance: semi ambulance
   succeed:   suck see
   rescue:    regulars cue
   it really: trillion
   his street: history
   ozone:     owe zone
   lesbians:  lez beans
   solves:    as far as
   categoric: cat gurk

Darlington also reports a long news item about someone called the Princess of
Whales. She adds, unsurprisingly, that watching the news is sometimes a rather
baffling experience for her mother. Feedback finds these errors fascinating
and wonders how they arise. Is a voice-recognising computer involved? Or is
our old friend the spellchecker running amok again?

EDUPAGE (gopher to educom.edu) cites the 7/10/94 New York Times (Sec.3, p.9):

ARE YOUR DOCUMENTS FULL OF GLYPHS?
        A Xerox technology known as glyphs will allow documents to carry
thousands of characters of information placed unobtrusively in gray background
patterns. One possible use: "If you see a spreadsheet in an annual report, it
sits there, lifeless on the paper. But if there was a glyph border that had
the mathematical model of the spreadsheet, you could scan that into a computer
and make it come to life." Another possible use would be to encode info about
the recipient of a direct mail piece or a survey, for ease of processing when
the document is returned. (End quote from EDUPAGE)

In that case, I'll be sure to xerox [sic] the anonymous survey form 
at a "light" setting to keep from telling them who I am.

VWs of a certain vintage are indeed subject to EMI. This is a known
'bug' (so to speak) and is mentioned, I believe, in the later editions
of "How To Keep Your Volkswagen Alive For The Complete Idiot" -- the
standard reference for VW shade tree mechanics.

The confusion arises from two things. First, it was not the 1963 models
which were affected. The '63s had a thoroughly conventional ignition and
fuel system. (I have owned two of them). Second, I don't think it was
the fuel pump per se that was the problem.

The problem comes in the later models fitted with the Bosch fuel injection
system, one of the most misbegotten pieces of crap ever hung on an
automobile. This used electronically operated injectors controlled by
an on-board computer. Unfortunately the Bosch implementation as found
on the 1969 or so VWs was not well designed, to put it mildly. Not only
was it subject to EMI, but I am told it also had no way to adjust for
the changing resistance of the wires as they aged. Meaning the thing
would get flaky as it aged and there was nothing you could do about it.

The standard advice on getting a bug or squareback with Bosch fuel injection
was to discard the system and replace it with carburetors.  As as result I've
never had much dealings with the system personally -- except for pulling it.

In my partial translation of the article from Air et Cosmos 11-24 Juillet
concerning the A330 crash on 30 June, I translated `assiette' as `angle of
attack', or `AoA'. Mea culpa. `Assiette' means `pitch', the angle that the
airplane makes to the horizontal (`incidence' is `angle of attack'). The
difference is important. Goodness knows what caused me to write that. The
mistake may be rectified by replacing all occurrences of `AoA' (except only in
the parentheses in which I comment on `incidence') by `pitch'.

An autopilot can effectively command pitch, but not effectively angle of
attack. Whether an aircraft stalls or not depends on the angle of attack.  The
two concepts are related via angle of climb.  Roughly, 
angle of climb = pitch - angle of attack.

Other vocabulary omitted from my article for US residents and non-pilots: QNH
is indicated altitude above sea level with the altimeter set to mean pressure
at sea level for that day/time (as given by Flight Control). QFE is indicated
altitude above highest elevation of the field with the altimeter set to
airport measured pressure. So 460mQFE = approximately 460m above the airport
surface's highest point.

politicians might use individually targeted communications to make
personalized promises based on information from demographic databases.  He
considers that contradictory promises would be exposed through public bulletin
boards.  This is conceivable, but it's not something I'd want to bet the
future of democracy on.  Nobody would be stupid enough to make clearly
contradictory promises to different people.  Rather, extrapolating some
current practices, they would find out the "hot button" themes for particular
segments of the electorate and tailor strongly worded but vague statements for
each group, based on its particular themes.

(Right now the most common way to find out the "hot button" themes is to call
people on the phone and ask them under the guise of poll-taking.  If someone
doesn't have any buttons you can press, you simply say "thank you" and leave
them out of your get-out-the-vote plans.  The expense of this method limits
its application, but once the data collected this way is pooled, stored, and
merged with other available databases, the costs should come way down.)

When analyzing the pathologies of electoral systems, I think it's a big
mistake to focus on "politicians".  It's a system with a logic, and changing
the faces won't change the logic.  Quite the contrary, term limits (which PD
says he supports) will intensify the role of money and campaign experts, since
candidates will be even more unknown to voters on average than before.  (For
those outside the US, the US is currently experiencing a wave of plebiscites,
promoted by a far right-wing organization, limiting political candidates to
one or two terms of office.)

The computer-related Risk here pertains to the construction of the sphere of
public debate.  When public debate is conducted through a common medium, such
as the newspaper, there exists at least a *chance* that public decisions that
affect everyone equally will be made by the citizenry reasoning together as a
group.  But when every campaign has a separate channel to every voter, the
whole notion of a public goes out the window, replaced by fragmentary
micropublics who know they're being manipulated but cannot do anything about
it without investing enormous effort in organizing.  If computer networks
facilitate that organizing then that's terrific, but first we need to achieve
something much more like universal access to them.

Subject: Laptops and Airplanes Not Recommended
Date: Thu, 7 Jul 1994 23:01:59 GMT

Here's something to think about for anyone who's considering using their
laptop computer, cellular phone, or radio on an airplane.

Non-pilots should be aware that a course deviation of plus or minus 10 degrees
is the maximum tolerance for an approach to landing using instruments, e.g.,
in clouds or bad weather.  In general flying more than 10 degrees off course
is considered "flying all over the sky."

This excerpt is reproduced from "Callback" which is a safety bulletin for
pilots derived from the reports of pilots, controllers, and other aviation
personnel to NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System. ASRS is a research
organization and not a regulatory organization such as the Federal Aviation
Administration nor an oversight organization such as the National
Transportation Safety Board.

Callback, Number 180, May 1994

A Monthly Safety Bulletin from The Office of the NASA Aviation Safety
Reporting System, P.O. Box 189, Moffet Field, CA 94035-0189

Flight Interference

More than 40 reports submitted to ASRS over the last few years indicate that
in-flight operation of personal electronic devices by passengers may be a
factor in aircraft track deviations, communications problems, and other
incidents.  While some crews are quick to pick up on the possibility of
electronic interference, others find these events initially difficult to
detect.  More from this ASRS report:

* After takeoff, we were given a turn direct to the fix.  The ONS (Omega
Navigation System) checked good on the ground and was used to turn towards
fix.  The heading seemed good, cross-checking with the VOR.  There was a
strong crosswind from the northwest which made determining a quick fix-to-fix
on the VOR only a rough estimate...  Center gave us about a 20 to 30 degree
correction to the right or north of course to intercept...  We then noticed an
intermittent "DR" [Ded Reckoning] light on the Omega... Jet route was
intercepted and VOR track was annunciated on our FMA [Flight Management
Annunciator].  We appeared to be tracking Jet route outbound when Center gave
us about a 20 to 30 degree turn to the north, saying it was "a vector for
climb."  We were now around 25,000-27,000 feet.  The VOR fluctuated 30 to 40
degrees again, settled down, and we appeared to be south of course.  Upon
intercepting Jet route, Center gave us a left turn of 10-20 degrees and said
we were established on Jet route and to continue our flight planned course...
[This] was a surprise to us since we had not been apprised we were off course
initially...

After level-off, the Captain went back through the cabin and found a portable
radio with headset in use.  A cellular phone was also found on, although its
owner claimed it had not been used.  We believe the VOR fluctuations and
navigation problems could have been caused by these items...  Several
passenger announcements were made explaining the importance of leaving these
items off as well as the required announcements concerning electrical items.


Loss of EFIS and Autonav

* During climb EFIS [Electronic Flight Instrumentation System] screens blanked
suddenly, then indicated missed approach fail along with loss of all auto nav
functions.  We immediately reverted to manual lateral nav and kept the
aircraft climbing on autopilot while requesting the flight attendants to see
if any personal electronic devices were in use.  As this aircraft is equipped
with inertial reference units that were properly aligned at the gate, it was
very suspicious that a failure occurred.  The flight attendants found 3
passengers using laptop computers and one listening to a portable radio.  We
asked that they be turned off and, after reprogramming the FMS [Flight
Management System], resumed auto nav.  At cruise altitude the laptops were
allowed to be used... [but] the listener was asked not to use his [radio].

A serious study needs to be made of the electronic interference problem on
today's modern fleets in order to resolve the issue of what the newspapers are
telling the public that they may bring aboard and use in-flight.  The printed
material on the aircraft does not seem to be effective.  While in this event
no serious harms was done, the effect could have been different if the
aircraft was in heavy weather flying a complicated departure or arrival...


Compass Deflection

* In cruise flight at FL310 [31,000 feet] 24 NM [nautical miles] west of the
VOR, the #1 compass suddenly precessed 10 degrees to the right.  I asked the
First Flight Attendant if any passenger-operated electronic devices were in
operation in the cabin.  She said that a passenger had just turned on his
laptop computer.  I asked that the passenger turn off his laptop computer for
a period of 10 minutes, which he did.  I slaved the #1 compass, and it
returned to normal operation for the 10-minute period.  I then asked that the
passenger turn on his computer once again.  The #1 compass immediately
precessed 8 degrees to the right.  The computer was then turned off for a
30-minute period during which the #1 compass operation was verified as normal.
It was very evident to all on the flight deck that the laptop computer
operation was adversely affecting the operation of the #1 compass.  I believe
that the operation of all passenger-operated electronic devices should be
prohibited on airlines until the safe operation of all of these devices can be
verified.


Short Hops

Turning to a different type of flight interference, here's a report that gives
new meaning to the expression, "short hop":

* On a night flight... we had a passenger with a massive bladder attack and
poor timing.  Traffic was stacked up and we had a 20-minute delay in taking
off.  We were cleared into position on the runway behind landing traffic and
prepared for an immediate takeoff ahead of traffic on a two-mile final
approach.  We had signaled the flight attendants (F/As) that we were taking
the active runway when a passenger bolted out of his seat and headed into the
lavatory.  The flight attendant asked him to return to his seat.  He ignored
her request.  She then demanded he be seated.  He still ignored her command.
She promptly called the lead F/A who called us in the cockpit.  We cancelled
our takeoff clearance and headed for the nearest exit.  It was blocked by
departing traffic.  We then headed 2,000 feet down the runway to the next
turnoff.  Traffic on final approach was closing in on our tail as we departed
the runway, an aircraft whizzing past our tail with precious few feet to
spare.  It was the quick thinking and timing of our flight attendant that
allowed me the time to clear the runway...

OK, it's fictional.  I don't know if it's interesting to the RISKS readership
or not, but it caught _my_ eye.  (Someone else can figure out whether
it actually indicates some kind of actual RISK).

from Sara Paretsky's mystery novel, "Indemnity Only," copyright 1982,
chapter 15, p. 206 in the Dell 1990 reprint:

"'... one of the things they asked him to do was check records of claim drafts
against claim files--see if they matched, you know.  Did Joe Blow get fifteen
thousand dollars when his file shows he should only have gotten twenty
thousand dollars.  That kind of thing.  They had a computer program that did
it, but they thought there was something wrong with the program, so they
wanted Peter to do a manual check....  You know, if Ajax had a good computer
system, Peter would still be alive.  I think of that sometimes, too, and it
makes me want to shoot all their programmers.'"

I heard an item about this on the radio last week. According to this item, the
roller coaster is of a standard design: trains are hauled up to the high
point, and then run free under gravity without brakes until they approach the
station. On the approaches to the station are several more braking units -
movable clamps which grip the train wheels to slow it down. The system should
stop each train just behind the previous one.  The various stopping points are
called "berths" in railway terminology.

The problem appears to be that there was one train in the station, and a
second waiting to enter. The third train was braked so as to stop in the berth
nearest the station (occupied by the second train), rather than the previous
(empty) berth.

You claim that there is no reason for the police stopping a vehicle to 
know the registered address of the vehicle or the driver?

   "Officer, I was just going out to buy some groceries."

   "But why do you shop for groceries 150 miles from your home?"

Sounds pretty believable to me.

I think this is more than just me being picky.  Rather than me trying to
explain why, just ask yourself, Dear Reader: Why did you first read Mr van

As I remember it the giving of information to vendors of telecomunication
services is normal if you don't state you want it private. The reason is the
local telephone company already has the information as a part of its service,
and if they don't share it with their competitors, it gives them an unfair
advantage. It is all part of trying to open the telephone utilities to
competition in as fair as possible way.

In RISKS DIGEST 16.21, Benjamin Wright was quoted:
   You can write e-mail and make it appear to come from someone
   else.  You can easily send e-mail from an address opened under a
   false name.  But just as you can send fake e-mail, so you can send
   fake letters, telegrams, telexes, and faxes.
   !!!-----------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Small error. Telegrams in Australia have a copy made by the communications
authority that is kept on file for six (?seven) years. I think that is part 
of the Berne convention. Other countries' communications companies would 
also keep copies - expressly for legal verification. 
I believe the same is true of Telex.

*Also in Australia a FAX is legally binding, as is a VERBAL AGREEMENT OVER THE
TELEPHONE. (You merely have to "believe you are talking to a company officer"
even if the other party is actually not authorised to negotiate - like the
cleaning staff answering the Sales department phones at night)

Neither would I be, but let's be fair: if they have your signature in

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (one of the U.S.'s three nuclear
weapons labs) has had one of its unclassified Internet computers hacked
to provide a repository for 2 Gigabytes of pornographic images, storing
over 1000 pictures.  (You thought a picture is worth 1000 words?  In this
case it is worth 2000 kilobytes, i.e., 2 megabytes each.)  This was
reported in a Los Angeles Times article by Adam S. Bauman (appearing in
the San Jose Mercury, 12 July 1994, front page); the Times article also
noted that the Software Publishers Association and the FBI are tracking
something like 1600 B-boards that contain pirated software.  [Thanks to

This is one for the Highway, not the I-way (Information Dirt Road):
     
On 2 July 1994, on Route 29 in Virginia, one of those roadside variable
message electronic signs was reported as flashing:
     
                       "DUMB FROGS AHEAD"
     
This wasn't a case of someone fat-fingering "dense fog ahead".  Some
prankster(s) had gotten access to the controls and had a little fun
confusing the public.  Stacy Pruitt, spokesbeing for Virginia Department
of Transportation (VDOT), was quoted in the Washington Post as saying,
"We think someone got in there during the night.  What is mysterious is
that it takes a password to sign onto the system.  We're calling it
'highway hacking'."  VDOT officials reported that the security box (on
the back of the unit) was left unlocked, allowing physical access to the
keyboard.
     
Obviously, the so-called highway hacker(s) could have concocted a far
more dangerous prank (the mind boggles!) but that merely begs the REAL

Often when driving, one is confronted with those big digital display boards

a cellular antenna.  Am I correct in thinking that there is a modem on the
cellular "line"?

The risks are somewhat obvious - one could call and change the message!  While
"COP AHEAD - SLOW DOWN" would be a bit amusing, a change from "BRIDGE OUT

I received an e-mail that was distributed over a large mail-group today.  It
had a line, just below the "Subject" line, that read:

&gt; Sensitivity: Company-Confidential

There are several RISKS here:

1)  Misuse of this label can cause your company problems when it
    comes time to sue someone for stealing confidential information.
    This label should mean what it says in order to be valid in court.
    My company has told the employees several times to use this
    label ONLY for actual confidential material, for this reason.

2)  It did not say which company the material was confidential for.
    It would not be a valid in court on actual confidential material
    because the company's name is not mentioned.

3)  The person who sent this message is not paying attention

The 24 June 1994 issue of The Wall Street Journal contains a long article
about a wave of "fax scams" that has been emanating from Nigeria.  People
receive quasi-official-looking faxes with elaborate stories about money that
needs to be parked in their bank accounts for short periods, with large
profits promised.  The recipients of these faxes, of course, start dreaming of
big bucks.  Just before the deal is closed a temporary "hitch" arises,
requiring the person to send over some money or goods to bribe a government
official.  Needless to say, the money and goods are never seen again.  Part of
what makes these scams so effective is that the scammers manage to come up
with enough personal information about the victim to play on his or her weak
points and make the faxed "documents" more compelling.  The scam requires
faxes rather than just airmail because the parties need to exchange increasing
numbers of faxes as things get more complicated, and speed presumably helps
keep doubt from setting in.  The article says:

  Nigerian scam artists have claimed so many victims in Texas that the
  Nigerian soccer team and its fans have received a less-than-enthusiastic
  welcome at the World Cup games there.  In Addison, the Dallas suburb where
  the Nigerian team is practicing, a local newspaper quoted the police chief
  warning restaurateurs to beware of Nigerians bearing credit cards.  After
  outraged Nigerians called for his resignation, the chief said his remarks
  had been misinterpreted.

The full reference is:

  Geraldine Brooks, How a recurring scam cost an accountant and his wife
  $54,000, The Wall Street Journal, 24 June 1994, pages A1, A6.

The Risk, of course, is not specific to faxes.  When communications are cheap
and personal information is readily available, scams like these can readily
cross borders, so that criminal communications can originate in "off-shore"
locations where they are not likely to be punished.  Just think what will be
possible when global broadband communications become widely available.

Re: Mosaic risks (Levine, <A HREF="/Risks/16.22.html">RISKS-16.22</A>)

 At the RISK of sounding like a commercial, "Mosaic" (a brand-name for the
generic World Wide Web (Web) technology) is and has been available in privacy
and integrity enhanced versions from the MicroElectronics and Computer
Technology Corporation (MCC - my employer).  MCC EINet has secured Web client
versions on Mac and Windows, as well as Unix servers.  Web is the latest in a
series of internet products that MCC has secured, including WAIS and FTP.  We
also maintain commercial grade access control and key servers on the network,
available to any registered user.

The two most obvious RISKS in an internet Web environment are the
authentication of the user and the server.  Just as a user must authenticate
to a server, responsible users will want non-reputable evidence that the
server is what it says it is.  This two-way authentication process is fully
deployed today.  And before everyone responds, we agree that their are many
more RISKS, and secured clients and servers are only part of our system, which
includes an internet security plan, risk analysis, fully integrated firewalls,
and transparent encryption.

Re: Fraud on the Internet (Rowley, <A HREF="/Risks/16.22.html">RISKS-16.22</A>)

  ... Your reaction is naive.  The short answer is yes.

The internet is a wonderful collection of networks of all shapes and
sizes, for many purposes.  There is no reason to try to impose additional
rules and regulations on it.  What is happening, however, is that as
commercial entities are looking to make use of it, they want additional
security features in place.  If a company puts in links to the internet
with a firewall and authenticating server, that does not 'require' the
rest of the users to change anything.  It just means that one
organization is making use of an advanced technology in a safe and secure
manor.

A minor but (mildly?) interesting bar-code risk lies in coupons which are part
of the packaging of products.  The manufacturers have figured out that they
shouldn't put barcodes on those which appear on the outside of packaging, lest
the store pay you for taking the product (although this means that the scanner
cannot verify that you bought the necessary product when redeeming the
coupon), but continue to put barcodes on those which appear *inside* the
product.

In the case of Healthy Choice frozen fake eggs, the coupon happens to be
on the inside, but *opposite the normal product bar-code*.  I found
myself paying for 2 products instead of paying for one and cashing a
coupon, when the checker scanned the wrong side of the coupon!

Hardly earth-shattering, but a nice gotcha.

One more contribution on the use and abuse of cellular phone technology, if
the forum can tolerate it.  As a technology planning engineer in the trade,
I find the amount of ignorance-fueled fear of telephony and the vast amount
of misinformation on cellular telephony in particular to be a source of
constant amusement (but hey, I'm easily amused :).  I'll address some
specific remarks from earlier contributions first, then raise the noise
floor another few dB with my own views.

Willis H. Ware writes:
&gt;If cells get smaller in the future, then the precision of location will

In a subsequent issue of Risks, Lauren Weinstein writes:
&gt;If you read your phone bill inserts carefully, you may have already 
&gt; received a notice allowing you to choose whether or not you want your 
&gt; called number information released to VENDORS of telecommunication services!

The concern about monitoring is justified only up to a point -- remember, the
only reason for this information to be saved is because it has value to
someone.  Wireline telcos long ago abandoned detailed billing, and today don't
even retain that information unless required by a government agency; the cost
of collecting and storing this tidal wave of data is still too prohibitive to
make it useful on an everyday basis (this is a situation I don't see changing
in the foreseeable future, either).  The cellular phone industry, on the other
hand, has employed detailed billing from its infancy, for reasons driven both
by customer needs (why did this call cost so much?)  and economies of scale
(the processing needs have been orders of magnitude smaller than what is
required by our wireline brethren, and at the same time the silicon revolution
has made low to midrange computing power cheap -- many smaller cellular phone
companies still do billing on a single PC!).  So, for instance, seeing LA
reporters with copies of OJ's cellular phone bill are no surprise at all,
given that the information is readily at hand and the weakest security link in
a system is usually the human operator.  For all the high tech, gee whiz
methods of obtaining cellular phone IDs, the most common way is still for
unscrupulous sorts to bribe or blackmail company insiders into sharing lists
of valid subscribers.  In the case of a large company like AirTouch (or my
own), a corruptible someone with access to subscriber data can probably also
get billing data.

Robert Morrell, Jr. and Bob Frankston pointed out different aspects of the
risks of eavesdropping on cellular phone conversations (Mr. Morrell made the
point that it is incumbent upon the user to ascertain and protect his level of
privacy, and Mr. Frankston pointed out the fallacy of comparing wired and
wireless technologies from a privacy perspective).  The so-called security of
the wired telephone is conceptually similar to "security through obscurity" in
that it is the medium itself that makes listening to an otherwise unencoded
communication difficult.  It is something that virtually no phone user has
thought about but takes for granted anyhow.  I could agree with Mr. Morrell's
extreme-sounding position if there was some assurance that once the user body
was educated about the risk and began demanding truly secure communication
(which I believe will happen eventually) the option was still available.
Right now the US government is trying to usurp the issue while the body
politic is still ignorant, and I see that as a violation of the public trust.
BTW, several companies make scramblers for analog cellular phones (which work
in conjunction with a companion device on the target phone, either wired or
compatible cellular).  The big drawback to these is that they must do most of
their cryptographic work in the frequency domain, and 3300 Hz is not a lot of
bandwidth to play in.

On the general issue of location tracking, I think the greater concern should
be with real-time monitoring.  I can sit at my desk today and find out which
cell sites in our network any given phone number has placed calls on for the
last 24 hours (after which time the data is rolled off into oblivion but
continues to be available offline in printed detailed billing reports).  But,
as has already been correctly pointed out, this information is highly
imprecise.  Triangulation can be employed with a greater degree of precision
(within a few hundred feet at best), but not consistently enough to be
reliable.  Data from technologies such as GPS must be transmitted in-band, so
it is useless to the phone company unless the receivers are integrated into
the network.  However, I can't -- and probably won't ever be able to -- get
any of the same information from a competitor, because that type of data is
highly competitive in nature.  No competing carriers will share that
information with one another, nor will they be enthusiastic about providing
the data to a clearinghouse where it might be generally accessible.  So in
this case competition is our friend.  In any event, every large cellular
carrier is already performing real-time network monitoring, and using called
number information to get to the weak human link is probably more effective
for law enforcement anyhow.

Michael Stern writes in <A HREF="/Risks/16.23.html">RISKS-16.23</A> about an alarming number of errors in a
closed-captioned news program, and wonders if these are induced by faulty
voice-recognition systems or spell-checker bugs.  The truth is far simpler.
Many live programs (such as news) are live-captioned by a service provider.
In other words, a live human stenographer listens in (and usually views) the
program while it is being broadcast, and types along as best as they can keep
up.  This is a somewhat outdated method when it comes to news, but many
stations still use it, and it is quite error-prone.  This is probably what
happened in the reported case.

More modern newsrooms with integrated teleprompting/news composition software,
have the newsroom computer automatically generate live close-captioning data
from the teleprompter display.  So the home viewer actually gets to see the
news slightly before the anchor reads it off the display.  The problem here is
that commentary from persons on screen, such as people live in the field, must
still be provided manually or not at all.

Some stations elect to caption the news program after it has aired, then
re-broadcast it during the late-night hours.  The problem here, of course, is
that hearing-impaired viewers aren't able to get the news until hours after
everyone else.

Unlike most programmes, teletext conversion of the news is done live. As I
understand it, a typist transcribes what the newsreader is saying using a
special phonetic keyboard (like those devices you sometimes see being used in
Parliamentary Committees or Congress). This is linked to a computer, which
makes a "best guess" at the corresponding words and outputs the teletext
directly. Obviously there is no time to correct errors.

It's interesting that one looks for a high tech explanation for these errors.
Many Risks readers seem to forget that we already have a fairly reliable
speech to text system. I presume that the TV stations use the same kind of
system that one encounters when using the text to speech mechanism that is
employed in the page networks. This is an efficient system that runs on 2000
to 3000 calories a day and can handle a wide variety of speech.

A human.

Unlike the paging systems which allow the typist to confirm the message
(though I do get messages like my wife's request that I buy some "weak germ"),
the TV systems require someone to type at a furious pace without any chance to
correct or think. It's surprising how few errors occur. Wait for the story on
Unix.

Is it too much to expect that when airlines find problems with laptop 
computers they report which ones? It is possible that particular 
manufacturer's machines are out of compliance. As part of assuring safety, it 
would be worthwhile to report the brands to the FCC rather than just 
condemning all devices.

As to lavatories, is it indeed worth risking an aircraft because one

I recently saw the Flight Safety Department of the Swedish CAA comment on
interference by the use of cellular phones.

In one instance, operating a cellular phone caused the aircraft transponder to
stop replying to interrogations from ground secondary radar stations. When the
phone was turned off the transponder replied normally again.

The FSD speculates that transmissions from the cellular phone on frequencies
close to the interrogation frequency of the transponder had caused the
sensitivity of the transponder receiver (which is automatically adjusted) to
be reduced to the point where it could no longer receive interrogations.

Neither the cellular phone type (NMT or GSM) nor the aircraft type was given.

(PS. A "transponder" is a device that provides ground radar stations
with coded replies that identifies the aircraft and gives information
about its altitude.)

I may not be as up on this issue as I should be.  I do however fly fairly
often, and have become aware of the subject of interference to in-flight
instruments by electronic devices being used by passengers, and the rules
regarding the use of electronic devices.

It is clear that there is plenty of circumstantial evidence reported by flight
crews of this phenomenon.  When this first became an issue my understanding
was that no one was sure that there was any link between the electronic
devices and the occurrences, however for safety's sake, the restrictions were
being instituted.

What I don't understand is why after all this time there isn't more
substantial data available.  How hard would it be to reproduce the problem?
Certainly if one such device can cause a problem, then a cabin full of
devices, which can be switched on and off in a controlled experiment should
yield some measurable effect.  Has something like this been done already?  Has
this been done without being able to reproduce the problem?

It isn't that I don't believe there is a problem.  It just seems to me that
the kind of evidence I've seen reported does not help pinpoint the problem.
Therefore, the restrictions on the electronic devices may inconvenience
travelers without diminishing any risk.  Or perhaps once the effect can be
reproduced and isolated, alterations could be made to shield the
instrumentation from the effect.  This would be a far more effective approach
than expecting a few flight attendants to police an entire cabin full of
potential abusers.

Also, if the phenomena are caused by other unidentified sources, then there is
certainly a risk that too much attention to this theory could be diverting
attention from the real cause of the potentially disastrous occurrences.

NASDAQ Computers Crash, Halting Trading for More Than Two Hours
By Diana B. Henriques, The N.Y. Times, 16 July 1994 [PGN ABSTRACTING]

The U.S. automated over-the-counter NASDAQ marketplace went down for 2.5 hours
on the morning of Friday, 15 July 1994 when the computer system died.  (It was
finally restored just before N.Y. lunchtime.)  The problem was traced to an
upgrading to new communications software.  One new feature was added each
morning, beginning on Monday.  Thursday's fourth new feature resulted in some
glitches, but the systems folks decided to go ahead with the fifth feature on
Friday morning anyway.  It overloaded the mainframes (in Connecticut).
Unfortunately, the backup system (in Rockville, MD) was also being upgraded,
in order to ensure real-time compatibility.  The backup of course died as
well.  ``[The backup system is] really for natural disasters, power failures,
hardware problems that sort of thing,'' said Joseph R. Hardiman, Pres and CEO
of NASDAQ. ``When you're dealing with operating software or communication
software, it really doesn't help you.''

Volume on the day was cut by about one third, down from a typical 300 million
shares.  The effects were noted elsewhere as well, including several stock
indexes, spreading to the Chicago options pits, trading desks, and the media.
That in turn affected the large stock-index mutual funds.

Cable TV fiddlers ensnared by Garda's World Cup trap
Alan Murdoch in Dublin, The Independent, 15 Jul 1994

HUNDREDS of fraudsters in Cork have been nabbed in an ingenious "sting"
targeting three human weaknesses: greed, cable television, and the World Cup.
For two years Cork Communications, a cable television supplier to 30,000
homes, has been plagued by revenue-sapping fiddles. Former subscribers were
getting their "black box" cable decoders tampered with to let them watch
pay-only channels such as Sky Sport and the Movie Channel for free.  An
illicit black-box black market appeared, supplied by a wave of house
burglaries. "Hot" decoders were sold at an average Ir#60 a time. The result
was 4,500 miscreants watching on the cheap, defrauding the firm of an annual
Ir#750,000.  The solution had echoes of an FBI sting in the mid Eighties when
dozens of US crooks were lured with congratulations on winning a non-existent
competition, only to be arrested on arriving to collect their "winnings".  The
solution devised by Cork Communications blended hi-tech ingenuity with an
unerring sense of the one passion guaranteed to unite criminal classes this
summer.  A continuous message was broadcast on a cable channel which could be
received only by decoders on which the scrambler system had been illegally
by-passed. "To mark Ireland's first ever May Day bank holiday, YFBT Promotions
is offering an Irish World Cup T-shirt absolutely free," if promised, giving a
freephone number.  Some 2,000 replies were taped. Weeding out those who heard
about the offer in the pub, local gardai focused on former subscribers among
the earliest callers. Last Monday Cork District Court granted 416 search
warrants.  The next 48 hours saw a blitz of raids such as J Edgar Hoover would
have relished. An initial 150 people face charges and possible fines or
imprisonment. A Garda spokesman said. "I hope this will prove a deterrent.
We've scared a lot of people."  Incidentally, three letters of the name YFBT
Promotions stand for "Your Box is Tampered".

Some of you may have seen the rather unbalanced piece NBC Dateline piece on
the aircraft collision avoidance system, TCAS (July 14). The Dateline piece
implied that TCAS was unsafe and, in fact, increased the risk of flying.
Before the piece was aired, The Air Transport Association (ATA), Air Line
Pilots Association (ALPA), and the Allied Pilots Association (APA), along with
TCAS manufacturers, sent a joint letter to the President of NBC News
expressing concern about the Dateline: NBC segment on TCAS.  The letter states
that indications from those already interviewed, "as well as promotional
pieces already aired, clearly suggest that the segment will not present a
factual, balanced viewpoint of TCAS."

The fact is that TCAS substantially reduces the risk of midair collisions.
Airlines and pilots overwhelmingly support it, and in a number of incidents
pilots credit TCAS with saving lives.  The most recent testimony involved a
situation over the Pacific between Northwest and Cathay Pacific jumbo jets in
which TCAS helped avert a potential disaster.  The Northwest pilot later said
something to the effect that "700 people owe their lives to TCAS." (No mention
of this by NBC.)

FAA's R&amp;D Service has concluded after extensive analysis that when both
aircraft are equipped with TCAS 2, the risk of collision is reduced by a
factor of 26.  And, despite what was reported on Dateline, TCAS has not
induced a single collision or near collision.  These assertions are not made
lightly.  They come after four years of experience with the operational
evaluation of TCAS II that FAA began in 1990 in cooperation with the aviation
community, including pilots and controllers.  This represents some 25 million
hours of TCAS operation.  During that time, almost 14,000 reports from pilots
and controllers have been received.

A quote from one of FAA's Public Affairs staffers puts this in context:
"Clearly, the trend in television news is towards the news magazine shows,
versus the straight news news programs.  Even CNN, whose straight news
broadcasts are among the best, is losing audience share, according to recent
statistics.  Bucking this trend, I plan to focus a lot more of my attention on
televised sports, although I haven't broached that subject with my wife yet.
Sports is one thing that TV does exceptionally well.  Which reminds, if you
still think soccer is boring after watching Romario of Brazil and Baggio of
Italy, then you need help.  Might as well just jump in your jammies, put on
your slippers, watch the news magazine shows, and wait for the final bell."

Now it seems that since an aviation authoritative source is talking about the
RISKS that I have been identifying for over 4 years, it's OK to be wary.  But
how easy people forget.

It is not in the best interest of the government, the FAA, the airlines or the
aircraft manufacturers to openly discuss, much less admit what *could* go
wrooonnngggg.  RISKS readers should be referred to my original works on the
subject which appear in:

	RISKS: (You know the issue better than I do.)

	Security Insider Report,   August, 1993. "The FAA Discovers 
	HERF: Is John Q. Flyer in Danger?"

	"Information Warfare: Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway," 
	Thunder's Mouth Press.  ISBN 1-56025-080-1.

In ongoing research in related areas, we are presently identifying at least 19
(nineteen) actual HERF attacks against high tech organizations.  We will be
publishing the results of this work when we are permitted to release the names
and events.

I stand by the original work despite the nay-sayers.  If anything, recent
events and current discussions fully support what I have been saying since
1990: Magnetic weapons are the nuclear arms of the Information Age, and
governments from hither and yon are trying to figure out what to do about it.
Kind of puts Michelangelo in perspective, doesn't it.

Thanks to RISKS for staying on the leading edge of technology and for not
being distracted by those who would prefer the subject be kept in the closet.

Since Lockerbie was caused by a device hidden by consumer electronics, and
since it appears to be at least suspected that navigational devices are
vulnerable to interference from outside consumer devices carried by passengers,
has anyone thought that a terrorist attack might be carried out on the avionics
instead?. It is not easy to screen for electronic devices in baggage etc. After
all the mail about the A320, I have come to realise that avionics are already
past the point of no return in modern jets - on an architecture programme last
night, Norman Foster was extolling the virtues of the 747; on the flight deck
was a very simple layout using four CRTs; is anyone claiming that the plane is
not avionics-dependent when the instruments are condensed in this manner?. I am
sure there are means of switching it all off, however what is the plane like to
fly after the switch-off? When my car's power steering failed, I was VERY glad
to be travelling slowly even though the steering would have been quite normal
to a van driver: I can imagine that this effect is at its worst in helicopters.

In the more mundane computer world, are any desktops vulnerable to reverse
TEMPEST attacks aimed at denying service?  We have some 286s I would quite
gladly test..

In RISKS DIGEST 16.23 it was reported:
&gt; A cellular phone was also found on, although its owner claimed it had not
&gt; been used.                     ^

It should be noted that a cell phone periodically transmits to the control
site so that the system knows its location, even if it's not 'in use'. A
powered-up phone could easily generate the intermittent problems reported.

I agree we need more information on using electronic devices in aircraft.  The
following article has the most particular information I've seen yet.  However,
Idon't know if the suspect laptop computer was examined for FCC interference
compliance.  If all these "electronic devices" are so dangerous, why are our
aircraft so sensitive, and why aren't computer manufacturers shielding their
products better?

Compass Deflection

[begin quote] In cruise flight at FL310 25 NM west of the VOR, the #1 compass
suddenly precessed 10 degrees to the right.  I asked the First Flight
Attendant if any passenger-operated electronic devices were in operation in
the cabin.  She said that a passenger had just turned on his laptop computer.
I asked that the passenger turn off his laptop computer for a period of 10
minutes, which he did. I slaved the #1 compass, and it returned to normal
operation for the 10-minute period.  I then asked that the passenger turn on
his computer once again.  The # 1 compass immediately precessed 8 degrees to
the right.  The computer was then turned off for a 30-minute period during
which the #1 compass operation was verified as normal.  It was very evident to
all on the flight deck that the laptop computer operation was adversely
affecting the operation of the #1 compass.  I believe that the operation of
all passenger-operated electronic devices should be prohibited on airlines
until the safe operation of all these devices can be verified.  [end quote]

     I note that the California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) is in
the process of greatly expanding it's network of Changeable Message Signs
(CMS) and freeway surveillance cameras.  In many cases, cameras are being
installed in locations where they can observe the text on the nearby CMS.  (in
many remote locations, CalTrans is using VSAT technology to feed a CMS and
monitor a camera).

INTRODUCTION and BACKGROUND:

Organizations and individuals are becoming increasingly dependent on
sophisticated computing systems. In differing circumstances, the dependency
might for example center on the continuity of the service delivered by the
computing system, the overall performance level achieved, the real-time
response rate provided, the extent to which catastrophic failures are avoided,
or confidentiality violations prevented. These various concerns can be
subsumed into the single conceptual framework of dependability, for which
reliability, availability, safety and security, for example, can be considered
as particular attributes.

This, the first European Dependable Computing Conference, aims to provide a
European venue for researchers and practitioners from all over the world to
present and discuss their latest research results and developments. The
conference scope addresses all aspects of dependable computing, including:
fault-tolerant systems and components, safety critical systems, software
dependability, secure systems, validation, verification, testing and
evaluation. The conference program has been purposely organized in a single
track to encourage cross-fertilization between different viewpoints of
dependable computing.

EDCC-1 is the successor of two European conference series on fault
tolerance and dependability as well as on aspects of testing and diagnosis.
The first series, known as the "International Conference on Fault-Tolerant
Computing Systems" was organized (from 1982 up to 1991) by the German
Technical Interest Group "Fault-Tolerant Computing Systems". The other
series, known as the "International Conference on Fault-Tolerant Systems
and Diagnostics", was annually organized (from 1975 up to 1990) by
Universities and academic research institutions in the former
Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria and the former GDR. EDCC will be organized
every two or three years in different European countries.

The 19 August 1994 New York Times carries a long article about hundreds of IRS
(Internal Revenue Service, the American tax collection people) employees being
disciplined for peeking at tax returns that they shouldn't have been.  The
IRS's investigations concluded that the employees' suspicious behavior ranged
from out-and-out fraud to simple curiosity.  The discovered the need for
guidelines about which degrees of wrongdoing merited which punishments.  The
full reference is:

  Robert D. Hershey, Jr., IRS staff is cited in snoopings, New York Times,
  19 July 1994, pages C1, C12.

It's one of those stories that can be invoked as evidence for either of two
contradictory positions: that employees' illicit use of personal files is 
a serious problem, or that it's not a real problem since the wrongdoers are
getting caught.  It's clear that private businesses have the same problems
with illicit peeking at personal information.  We might ask whether public 
or private organizations have a greater incentive to prevent this kind of
thing.  Since information can be copied readily, it's not like pilfering in 
a warehouse, where the organization loses capital in a straightforward sense
and thus has a straightforward interest in preventing it.  An exception would
be information that is leaked to customers who would otherwise purchase the
information from the organization, as opposed to being leaked to people whose
status or purposes would not otherwise permit them to buy the information
through the front door.

Instead, the organization's interest is generally more indirect, having
primarily to do with its reputation and the reputations of its leaders.  In 
a society without privacy activists or a free press serving a public that is
aware that its privacy is threatened, I think organizations would have little
incentive to do anything about leaks of personal information.  In the society
we have right now, I would suggest that the IRS has a greater incentive to
prevent leaks of personal information than does a credit bureau or other
private information holder, since it is politically much more practical 
for the legislature to make the IRS bureaucrats miserable than to make the
officers of private firms miserable.  Others may disagree, but the important
thing is to understand the mechanisms which create, or *could* create,
organizational interests in genuinely protecting private information.  Fear 
of legislation is a good one, but others exist as well.

[I presume you call a cash till that does not give cash a TELLER?  KGG]
              [Well, we might as well for the purposes of this message.  
              It is certainly not an ASKER!  PGN]

Today, in my local branch of Banca di Roma, in central Rome, Italy I
encountered a bank teller which had crashed.  These machines allow you to
obtain bank statements but do not dispense cash.  The display I encountered
contained a number of error messages (file not found, could not create file,
etc) followed by the prompt (A&gt;).  Feeling somewhat guilty, I typed DIR, which
worked and listed a number of executables and some documents.  I looked at one
called "fine", meaning "end" in Italian, which contained instructions for the
shutdown of the system.  At this point I alerted the lady at the counter: "Are
you aware that your system has crashed and that I can modify whatever I want
in the system?".  The latter to emphasise the gravity of the situation; I'm
not sure how much I could have done in practice.  This did indeed produce some
alarm, and I was told that there was a systems person who'd take of the
situation.  I did not see this person arrive during my subsequent wait in the
queue (which this teller is supposed to diminish btw).  As for the cause of
the crash, the computer terminals at the counters were dead at roughly the
same time, perhaps due to a common cause.

As RISKS readers know, I have ruffled more than a few feathers here in the US
and with foreign governments over the issue of HERF (High Energy Radio
Frequency) interference as a potential weapon system. Recently, RISKS readers
have seen mounting evidenced of anomalous electrical interference behavior at
37,000 feet.  Boeing and Apple and others companies have tried to quantify the
phenomenon but EMI and RFI interference is highly elusive.

Maybe the July 18, 1994 issue of the New York Times will shed additional
light.  The FBI mounted a whistle blower sting operation against General
Electric with the assistance of one of their engineers who alleged that the
company was improperly grounding its jet engines to the detriment of safety to
both commercial and military aircraft.  So alarmed was the Air Force One pilot
that he refused to take off from Rome's airport with President Clinton until
he was assured it was safe to do so.

The GE engineer and whistle blower Ian Johnson, said he discovered the
problems with improper engine grounding in 1989 but was subsequently brushed
aside by his concerns.  Engine grounding is critical to proper electrical
performance in the air, and the technique GE uses to insure a quality
connection is called electrical bonding.  Is it any coincidence that laptop
EMI stories began about a year later when protable digital electronics became
popular?

As any electrical engineer knows, any connection will introduce a given amount
of electrical resistance (measured in ohms .  .  .  Ohm's law, remember?) into
a circuit.  The goal is to approach zero resistance in any connection.
Period.  Poor connections not only change the values in the circuit thus
changing the circuit performance, but can also become diode-like and act like
unpredictable rectifiers.  Not good.

According to the article, GE engine's electrical bonding should result in an
added impedance (resistance) of 2.5 milliohms (.0025 ohms) but were found to
in some cases exceed 60,000 milliohms (60 ohms) and that is a lot: off by a
factor of 24,000!  In my former life as a circuit/systems designer, such an
intolerable error would GUARANTEE a failure.

The need for adequate bonding is clear: make sure that stray electrical
signals such as from lightening bolts or from laptop computers or other
consumer electronic devices do not interfere with the safe and reliable
operation of a 100 tons of metal hurtling through the atmosphere.

GE denies it (what else is new!) and there is bound to be a debate as to
whether there really was an intentional cover-up as stated by Mr. Johnson.

In an interesting side note, the FBI had Mr. Johnson wear a wire (a tap
recorder on his person) over a period of 6 months to get the goods on GE.

I guess this case will take over our minds and souls soon enough, on the "All
O.J. Network."

An academic journal called _The Information Society_ has just published a
special issue (volume 10, number 2, April-June 1994) entitled "The Digital
Individual".  (I'm the issue's guest editor.)  It includes five articles whose
general theme is that people's activities increasingly cast "shadows" onto 
the insides of computers.  As a result, the whole notion of a human individual
is beginning to change.  Everyone has their physical self and surroundings and
possessions, but they also have an elaborate digital aspect to their selves
which follows them around through life.  People use their digital shadows in 
a variety of beneficial ways, for example in sending messages to mailing lists
like Risks, but they are often managed and controlled through their digital
shadows as well.  Since the outcome of this ambivalent situation is neither
all-good or all-bad, it helps to make distinctions and put things in contexts,
and that's what the articles in this special issue try to do.  If you would
like to see the full contents and abstracts for the special issue, send a
message that looks like this:

	I learned the other day that I am a victim on the information
superhighway. It's a long story; I'll relate it in hopes that there are folks
out there who have had similar experiences and can tell me about them.
	 My wife and I had been getting about 15 anonymous calls a day for the
past three weeks. The caller would contact us at all hours, and would never
say anything at all. We were quite rattled because, as it happened, the calls
began coming just as I, a freelance journalist, began work on a murder story
and just as we prepared for the birth of our first child. The unknown man on
the other end of the line was, in our haunted imagination, a crazed murderer
after our new child.
	We tried to invoke "Caller ID" to catch our harasser, but this did not
work. Next, we called our phone carrier, US West, and our local sheriff to get
them to look into the matter. We kept a log of all the "harassing" calls, and
asked ourselves who so hated us that they would spend the money to call us via
long distance 15 times a day and hang up each time.
	Finally, the other day we got an answer: A computer software firm had
inadvertently entered our number into a database and prompted one of its
modems to keep trying our number, over and over. The lawyer for the company
called me today to apologize for the disturbance his firm had caused us. He
said, "I guess you were just a victim on the information highway. I'm sorry,"
but I was quite struck how minimal this whole thing was on his end (a few
misstrokes on the keyboard) and how massive the disturbance was on our
end--getting woken in the middle of the night, etc.
	I'm thinking now of writing a magazine article on our experience, and
am posting for two reasons. First, I'd like to hear from people who, like me,
have become "victims on the infobahn," and second, I'd like to get some
broader perspective. Do people know of any groups which monitor modem-caused
problems?  Are you aware of any laws covering such matters, and do you know
how frequently mishaps like mine occur?
	Any imput would be greatly appreciated. Thank you,

The Benefits Agency (the 65,000 strong government agency responsible for the
administration and payment of welfare benefits in the UK) has announced a new
method of payment system, to be introduced over the next three years
throughout the UK.

Customers will present their personalised smart card to the Post Office, who
will swipe it, do an (as yet unspecified) id check from info held
electronically on the card, and check on-line to the BA office to find out how
much money the person is due.  This will replace Girocheques and order books;
a system of 'valuable paper' which has been essentially unchanged since 1948.
The prototype uses a digitised photo and pressure-pad signature.

As the cards will have no inherent value, rough estimates are that payment-
related benefit fraud will be reduced by approximately 90%.

The BA has some 23,000,000 customers at any given time; approximately half
the adult population of the UK.  Customers will have an alternative to the
smart card, in the form of ACT payments to their bank.

One of the several RISKS of using computers is that ordinary people
(i.e., NOT computer gurus) may tend to listen TOO much to computer gurus.
Why?  Probably for reasons akin to why we listen to our doctors or our
auto mechanics: if they are good they know more than we do about something
that is important to us.

OK so far.  But we (too many of us) are spoiled to getting news in "sound
bytes" (or their e-mail or paper memo or slide presentation equivalents).
Too many of us do not appreciate the difference between CNN's Headline News
and PBS's McNeil-Lehrer Report; or their computing equivalents, for example
INFORMATIONWEEK and IEEE COMPUTER.  Both valuable, but very different.

So we hear one week that ISDN (or some other recent technology) has been
revised and is now thriving; and within a month we hear from some other
guru that the same technology has not lived up to its promise.  Promise?
or just hype? not only that, but hype by those same gurus, perhaps a bit
too eager for more clients?  or just not reading each other's stuff?
OK, gurus have only 24 hours a day, and can't keep up either.

In early Aug 94, I retire from 34 years of federal service; and will thus
for a while at least be off the InterNet.  I'll especially miss RISKS
because it is one of the very few forums that is both current and thorough
which is a tribute to its clients and especially its Moderator.

According to some of these same gurus I am an old dog not able to learn
new tricks; but others say that people like me are a valuable resource.
I believe the latter opinion, not only because it is flattering, but also
because the former may misunderstand the difference between 30 years 
experience and 3 years repeated 10 times.

I have been wearing hearing aids for over twenty years and on numerous
occasions have allowed me to listen to things most people are "deaf" to.

This is made possible by the inductive pickups in my hearing aids, throwing a
switch turns off the microphone and on the inductive pickup &amp; a whole new
world appears.

Just as an example, once upon a time, many people in a particular section of
the building I worked in began complaining of headaches though no reason could
be found. I happened to walk through the area in inductive mode &amp; began to
hear a beeping. Turned out that a RADAR unit at the nearby airbase had become
misaligned and was sweeping the corner of the building. Realignment cured the
headaches.

Through the years I have had many such incidents of being able to identify
electrical problems this way by characteristic "sounds". The point is that the
interior of a commercial aircraft is one of the "noisiest" environments I have
ever encountered with the 400 hz being almost "deafening" and a myriad of
other jingles, jangles, and hums also apparent.

One cannot but think that there must be almost no shielding of any signals in
a modern aircraft and to me the amazing part is not that instruments are
affected by laptops (low amplitude but I can "hear" them) but that they manage
to operate at all in such an electronic bedlam.

Padgett

ps I have no idea what the spectrum of my hearing aids is, just that they
   have enabled the detection of too many diverse things to be very limited.
   Once they determined that a "haunted" corner in a house was nothing more
   than a power box on the other side of the wall.

     [Ah, Padgett is an auditory canary, similar to the canary the miners
     used to take down with them to provide an early warning on toxic gases!  
     Think of it as a *gift*.  PGN]

The Internet has a reputation for a lack of security.  Those books which
mention security on the Internet generally suggest setting up a firewall
machine in order to protect yourself, but stop short of giving anything
resembling details of how to do such a thing.  Cheswick and Bellovin not only
give practical suggestions for firewall construction, they also address other
aspects of Internet security, as well.
 
Part one gives a basic background, both of security, and of TCP/IP.  If you
didn't think you needed security before, you will after reading chapter two. 
Part two details the construction of firewall gateways, as well as
authentication, tools, traps, and cracking tools for use in testing the
integrity of your system.  Part three discusses attacks, and the logging and
analysis, thereof.  The book also looks at legal aspects, secure communication
over insecure links, resources and various helpful information.
 
Although the book deals specifically with TCP/IP, the concepts, which are the
parts stressed, are applicable to any network-connected systems.  This is
probably destined to become one of the security classics within its specialized
field.

I very strongly suspect that whoever wrote the screenplay for "Sneakers" read
this first.  There is a mob connected corporation.  They wish to do some
espionage.  They hire a tiger team to do it for them.  They try to betray, and
possibly destroy, the tiger team.  The team is then forced to "crack" their
former client.  There is the same paranoia about the National Security Agency.
 
I don't know who the technical consultant was for this book, but he, she or it
did an even better job here than Captain Crunch did for the movie.  We have
insider information, phone phreaking, database surfing, social engineering and
overconfident systems managers.  Chapter thirteen introduces computer viral
programs, and I had to go back and check the copyright date.  At a time when
the supposedly technical books were printing absolute garbage, this novel had
the concepts down pat (although slightly shaky on the details).
 
Probably it won't become a classic in either literature or data security, but a
reasonably fun read, and refreshingly accurate technical details.

FIRST CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

Second International Conference on Information Warfare:
"Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway"

Conference Date:    Wed 18 January 1995
Conference Locale:  Dorval Airport Hilton Hotel
                    Montreal, Canada

1.   INTRODUCTION

Cultures that depend on information systems are vulnerable to Information
Warfare.  Attacks on data confidentiality, data integrity and data
availability will damage individuals, corporations and other private
organizations, government departments and agencies, nation-states and
supranational bodies.

It is essential to erect legal, organizational, and cultural defences 
against information warfare.

The Second International Conference on Information Warfare will focus on panel
discussions of Winn Schwartau's new book, _Information Warfare: Chaos on the
Electronic Superhighway_, published in 1994 by Thunder's Mouth Press (ISBN
1-56025-080-1).

This announcement serves as a request for participation by those wishing to
appear on panels, those wishing to suggest speakers, and others wishing to be
added to a mailing list (electronic and snailmail) for further details as they
develop.

Panelists will be asked to analyze selected portions of _Information Warfare_
and to present refutations or support for the author's statements, assertions,
predictions, warnings and recommendations.

The Conference will serve the interests of information security
specialists and strategic planners from the corporate world, military
and government circles, and academia.  The Press will be permitted
to cover the event, providing opportunities for increased public
awareness of vulnerabilities of the information infrastructure.

The Conference Proceedings will contribute to the national and
international debates about information warfare and the need for
careful planning to avoid disruption by hostile forces as national
and international information highways develop worldwide.

Following recommendations from last year's participants in the First
International Conference on Information Warfare, we have scheduled more free
time for the animated discussion among participants.

Informal discussions will be aided by Special Interest Group signs allowing
people with specific interests to congregate.

The organizers are making a special effort to reach members of the defence
establishments of Canada and the United States.  In order to foster the
greatest degree of serious and productive discussion, room has been reserved
for no more than 100 participants.

2.   PROGRAM:

     07:30-08:30  Registration and Continental Breakfast
     08:30-09:00  Keynote Address:Warfare and InfoSec
     09:00-10:15  Class I InfoWar:  Attacks on Personal Information
     10:15-10:45  Break for informal discussions by topic:
                    Privacy, Cryptography, Laws, Law Enforcement
     10:45-12:00  Class II InfoWar:  Corporate InfoSec
     12:00-13:30  Buffet lunch and informal discussions by sector:
                    Corporate, Government, Military, Academic
     13:30-14:45  Class III InfoWar:  Global InfoSec
     14:45-15:30  Informal discussions by network technology:
                    PCs, LANs, WANs, Internet
     15:30-16:15  General discussions among panelists and other
                    participants
     16:15-16:30  Closing comments

The official language of the Conference is English.

3.   SUBMISSIONS

The Program Committee will select a suitable number of
participants for the panel discussions.  Selection will be based on
subjective judgements of who is likely to offer the most thoughtful
and stimulating expositions and analyses of the topics.

Once panelists have been selected, the Program Committee requests
that they submit a brief written analysis of the topic they agreed to
speak on.  This one- to ten-page document will be published in the
Conference Handbook and will then appear in the Conference
Proceedings along with additional materials added during the
Conference.

Deadline for consideration as a panelist:  30 Sep 1994.

Confirmation of panel participation:  15 Oct 1994.

Deadline for submissions for inclusion in Conference Handbook: 
15 Nov 94.

&gt;From the Associated Press newswire (94.07.21 @ 12:15 EDST) via Executive News
Service (GO ENS) on CompuServe:

Internet-Hackers

By JOHN DIAMOND, Associated Press Writer 

   "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Intruders have been tapping into the Pentagon's
unclassified computer system through the Internet for the past seven months and
some have stolen, altered and erased records, officials said today. 
   Investigators have found no indication that the hackers have entered
classified systems that control critical functions such as nuclear weapons and
the movement of troops and ships."

The author provides the following key points:

o	"...Betsy McDonald, spokeswoman for the Defense Information Systems
Agency, said the compromised systems include those used for ballistic weapons
research, aircraft and ship design, military payroll, personnel records,
procurement, electronic mail, supercomputer modeling of battlefield
environments and computer security research."

o	The Pentagon is taking the attacks seriously: the intruders evidently
breached data confidentiality, damaged information integrity and threatened
system availability.

o	The US and foreign attackers were able "to guarantee their ability to
gain later access and to keep tabs on passwords needed to get into the
system."

o	Michael Higgins, Deputy Director for Information Security at DISA
(Defense Information Systems Agency) is reported as having said that '"major
portions" of the Defense Department's unclassified networks had been
penetrated by hackers, "adversely affecting DOD military readiness."

o	The attacks are related to the February 1994 CERT alert about network
sniffers trapping passwords.

o	Because of the nature of computer crime, the Pentagon admits that it
is difficult or impossible to determine the extent of the security breaches.

o	The Senate Armed Services Committee has been echoing the warnings of
analysts [such as Winn Schwartau] about systematic attacks on the information
infrastructure: "With almost no security protections, the nation faces the
prospect of potentially grievous assaults by even small groups with limited
resources."

o	Pentagon sources pointed to "the inherent difficulty of security for a
computer system that, by its very design, allows outside access and easy
communication."

of the Second International Conference on Information Warfare, too... &lt;g&gt;]

Chemical Bank's ATMs were out of commission for more than five hours,
beginning at 6:45 a.m. on 20 July 1994.  A routine file update was botched,
overloading the computer system.  This came six months after Chemical
systematically [no pun intended] charged its customers twice for cash
withdrawals.  [PGN abstracting from a NY Post article by Paul Tharp, Wed 20

&gt; The display I encountered contained a number of error messages (file
&gt; not found, could not create file, etc) followed by the prompt (A&gt;).

Users of operating systems, such as MS-DOS and Unix, in which the operating
system is owned by or owns the "standard input" often believe that the normal
way for an application to fail is to return control to the user.  (I have had
this discussion ad nauseam with our beloved moderator, who seems unable to
believe in any other failure mode for more than a few minutes at a time.)

In fact, for the first 30 years of computing that was an unusual way  of
failing.  With the exception of those running on Unix, most applications
failed by doing nothing or by returning the user to logon.  IBM's MVS, the
successor to an operating system for processing punched paper input and
producing printed paper output, did not even know about terminals and had
no operating system prompt.  The prompt that the users saw came from a
subsystem such as CICS.  CICS Applications failed in many mysterious and
disruptive ways but almost never by giving a legitimate user of an
application unintended operating system privileges.

Applications running on Unix, an operating system originally intended by
programmers for programmers, usually fail by returning control to the user
at the operating system prompt.  To limit the exposures associated with
this mode of failure, Unix was extended with the "setuid" (set user id)
function. The intent was to have applications run with a special limited
profile.  This would permit a user to run an application with privileges
that would not be appropriate with all of the generality of the operating
system.  In practice programmers use the function to have their programs
run with either their privileges or with "root" privileges.  Setuid has
hurt instead of helped.

Modern operating systems, such as OS/400, often have a mechanism like
setuid that permits a user to run an application with privileges that are
unique to the application.  However, they do not permit the user to retain
those privileges across the failure of the application.  (Indeed, one of
the things that characterizes such operating systems is that they have very
few failure modes.)

Application machines, such as ATMs or the Teller described by the poster,
should normally fail by doing nothing.  While it is appropriate for my
program to fail by returning ME to the operating system, my program should
not fail by returning YOU to the operating system prompt with privileges
that are different from those that you have on your own.  

Application machines should fail by doing nothing.  PAC-MAN never fails by
exposing either itself or its host environment.

 [1] Administration "Reversal" on Clipper
 [2] EPIC Statement
 [3] Letter from Gore to Cantwell

=======================================================================
 [1]  Administration "Reversal" on Clipper
=======================================================================

	A letter from Vice President Al Gore to Representative Maria
Cantwell (D-WA) sent this week during Congressional debate on the
Export Administration Act has raised important questions about the
current state of the Clipper proposal.  Some have hailed the statement
as a major reversal.  Others say the letter seals a bad deal.

	Below we have included the letter from the Vice President, a
statement from EPIC, and recommendations for further action.

=======================================================================
 [2] EPIC Statement on Gore Letter to Cantwell
=======================================================================

	News reports that the Clinton Administration has reversed
itself on encryption policy are not supported by the letter from Vice
President Gore to Maria Cantwell regarding export control policy.  In
fact, the letter reiterates the White House's commitment to the NSA's
key escrow proposal and calls on the private sector to develop
products that will facilitate electronic surveillance.

	The letter from the Vice President calls on the government and
the industry to develop jointly systems for key escrow cryptography.
Key escrow is the central feature of the Clipper chip and the NSA's
recommended method for electronic surveillance of digital
communications.

	The letter also reaffirms the Administration's support for
Clipper Chip as the federal standard for voice networks. There is no
indication that the White House will withdraw this proposal.
Statements that Clipper is "dead" are absurd.

	The letter offers no changes in export control policy.  It
recommends instead that the status quo be maintained and that more
studies be conducted.   (The White House already completed such a
study earlier this year.  The results were never disclosed to the
public, despite EPIC's request for release of the findings under the
Freedom of Information Act.)

	This is a significant setback for groups expecting that export
control laws would be revised this year.

	The White House expresses a willingness to allow unclassified
algorithms and to hold key escrow agents liable for misuse.  These are
the only provisions of the Gore letter favorable to the user
community.  But neither provision would even be necessary if the White
House did not attempt to regulate cryptography in the first place.

	The Administration's willingness to accept private sector
alternatives to Clipper for data networks essentially ratifies an
agreement to develop "wiretap ready" technologies for data networks.

	 We believe the letter from the Vice President is essentially
a blueprint for electronic surveillance of digital networks.  The
government will set out the requirements for surveillance systems such
as key escrow, and the industry will build complying systems.

	The plan dovetails neatly with the FBI's Digital Telephony
proposal, which will establish legal penalties for companies and users
that design systems that cannot be wiretapped.

	We do not believe this is in the interests of users of the
information highway.  Key escrow necessarily weakens the security and
privacy of electronic communications.  It makes networks vulnerable to
tampering and confidential messages subject to compromise.  It is the
approach urged by organizations that specialize in electronic
eavesdropping.  No group of Internet users has ever called for key
escrow encryption.

	If this proposal goes forward, electronic surveillance will
almost certainly increase, network security will be weakened, and
people who design strong cryptography without key escrow could become
criminals.  This is not a victory for freedom or privacy.

	We support unclassified standards and relaxation of export
controls.  We cannot support the premise that the government and
industry should design key escrow systems.  We also do not believe
that Clipper is an appropriate standard for federal voice
communications.

	We are asking the Vice President to reconsider his position
and urging network users to make known their concerns about the
proposal.

 [3] Letter from Gore to Cantwell
=======================================================================

THE VICE PRESIDENT
WASHINGTON

July 20, 1994

The Honorable Maria Cantwell House of Representatives Washington, DC 20515

"Dear Maria,

	"I write today to express my sincere appreciation of your
efforts to move the national debate forward on the issue of
information security and export controls.  I share your strong
conviction for the need to develop a comprehensive policy regarding
encryption, incorporating an export policy that does not disadvantage
American software companies in world markets while preserving our law
enforcement and national security goals.

	"As you know, the Administration disagrees with you on the
extent to which existing controls are harming U.S. industry in the
short run and the extent to which their immediate relaxation would
affect national security.  For that reason we have supported a
five-month Presidential study.  In conducting this study, I want to
assure you that the Administration will use the best available
resources of the federal government.  This will include the active
participation of the National Economic Council and the Department of
Commerce.  In addition, consistent with the Senate-passed language,
the first study will be completed within 150 days of passage of the
Export Administration Act reauthorization bill, with the second study
to be completed within one year after the completion of the first. I
want to personally assure you that we will reassess our existing
export controls based on the results of these studies.  Moreover, all
programs with encryption that can be exported today will continue to
be exportable.

	"On the other hand, we agree that we need to take action this
year to ensure that over time American companies are able to include
information security features in their program in order to maintain
their international competitiveness.  We can achieve this by entering
into a new phase of cooperation among government, industry
representatives and privacy advocates with a goal of trying to develop
a key escrow encryption system that will provide strong encryption, be
acceptable to computer users worldwide, and address our national
security needs as well.

	"Key escrow encryption offers a very effective way to
accomplish our mutual goals.  That is why the Administration adopted
the key escrow encryption standard in the "Clipper Chip" to provide
very secure encryption for telephone communications while preserving
the ability for law enforcement and national security.  But the
Clipper Chip is an approved federal standard for telephone
communication and not for computer networks and video networks.  For
that reason, we are working with industry to investigate other
technologies for these applications.

	"The administration understands the concerns that industry has
regarding the Clipper Chip.  We welcome the opportunity to work with
industry to design a more versatile, less expensive system  Such a key
escrow scheme would be implementable in software, firmware or
hardware, or any combination thereof, would not rely on a classified
algorithm, would be voluntary, and would be exportable.  While there
are many severe challenges to developing such a system, we are
committed to a diligent effort with industry and academics to achieve
such a  system.  We welcome your offer to assist us in furthering this
effort.

	"We also want to assure users of key escrow encryption
products that they will not be subject to unauthorized electronic
surveillance.  As we have done with the Clipper Chip, future key
escrow schemes must contain safeguards to provide for key disclosure
only under legal authorization and should have audit procedures to
ensure the integrity of the system.  Escrow holders should be strictly
liable for releasing keys without legal authorization.

	"We also recognize that a new key escrow encryption system
must permit the use of private-sector key escrow agents as one option.
It is also possible that as key escrow encryption technology spreads,
companies may establish layered escrowing services for their own
products.  Having a number of escrow agents would give individuals and
businesses more choice and flexibility in meeting their needs for
secure communications.

	"I assure you the President and I are acutely aware of the
need to balance economic and privacy needs with law enforcement and
national security.  This is not an easy task, I think that our
approach offers the best opportunity to strike an appropriate balance.
I am looking forward to working with you and others who share our
interest in developing a comprehensive national policy on encryption.
I am convinced that our cooperative endeavors will open new creative
solutions to this critical problems."

Sincerely
  /s/ Al Gore


=======================================================================
 [4]  What You Can Do (Email the VP)
=======================================================================

The Clipper debate has reached a critical juncture.  The White House
and industry are about to seal a deal to make key escrow the standard
for encrypted communications.  If you believe that individuals should
have the right to make full use of new technologies to protect
privacy, now is the time for your voice to be heard (and your email to
be sent).

EMAIL the Vice President at <A HREF="mailto:vice.president@whitehouse.gov">vice.president@whitehouse.gov</A>

- Thank him for the Administration's willingness to reconsider its
  views on Clipper.

- Express support for the decision to support unclassified algorithms
  and liability for key escrow agents.

- But urge him not to require key escrow as a standard for encryption
  products.

- Emphasize that key escrow is the soul of Clipper, the method for
  conducting electronic surveillance of digital communications.

- Call for extensive testing and studies before any key escrow system
  is deployed.

You should also:

- Urge him to withdraw Clipper as a standard for voice communications.

- Urge him to support relaxation of export controls.

- Ask for the public release of the earlier White House study on
  cryptography.

- Ask for the public release of White House documents reviewing the
  weaknesses of the key escrow proposal.

	The Vice President has clearly shown a willingness to listen to the
concerns of the user community on this issue.  Your letter could make a
difference.

   [This message is included for your information.  Whether you agree
   or disagree with David's recommendations, if you care to, write

&gt;&gt; 	I'm thinking now of writing a magazine article on our
&gt;&gt; experience, and am posting for two reasons. First, I'd like to hear
&gt;&gt; from people who, like me, have become "victims on the infobahn," and
&gt;&gt; second, I'd like to get some broader perspective.

If this is a problem with the information superhighway, it's been
around since the horse-and-buggy days the information dirt road.

This is not a new problem.  I can recall similar incidents happening over a
decade ago, and I'm only 23 years old.  I suspect occurrences that this
problem will increase for a short period of time, while networking gains
popularity, but decrease soon after, as data telecommunications (ISDN, frame
relay, ATM, etc) becomes more popular.  It's really hard to wake somebody up
in the middle of the night with a misdirected ATM packet!  I've yet to have
someone complain at an errant ICMP echo, myself.

This sort of situation is not new. I remember a problem we had with a uucp
dial-out line in 1983. Someone added a dial-out entry but transposed two
digits in the destination telephone number. This meant that once an hour
we were calling up some poor folks and annoying them all night long!

Luckily this only happened over one night. In the morning I investigated why
none of our uucp connections to that host completed, and noticed the typo. I
did call up the people who we had been bothering (sort of hoping that the
number would be invalid and no one had been bothered!) and emphatically
apologized for our error. They were understanding. I guess it helped that I
was *not* a lawyer and was able to empathize with their plight. In fact I felt
good about the call afterwards... now I knew that these folks would know what
had happened and would not fear that someone was after them!

Mr Donahue's predicament is symptomatic of a wider problem which will grow
over the next few years - 'semantic overload' of the telephone system. PTT's
and Telco's are still stuck in a mode where a telephone line is used to allow
one human being to talk to another. In fact, more and more phone lines are
connected to machines, many of which can initiate as well as receive calls,
and vary in levels of human compatibility. Examples range from answering
machines, through voice mail systems, fax machines, 'smart boxes', pagers,
alarm systems, modems, all the way up members of the International Union of
Deaf-Mute Dyslexic Telephonists :-). The current telephone system is a mess -
it allows anything to connect to anything at any time, regardless of
compatibility, and regardless of the consequences.  Yet this proliferation of
machines that use the telephone network has arisen precisely because of the
flexibility of connection on the telephone network. People use the phone
system to send text messages via fax and email, although the Telex system in
theory provides most of the same facilities. It just wasn't flexible enough.
To make the situation more bearable, without restricting connectivity, an
extension of caller ID could be made, so the calling line can say 'I am a xxxx
and I understand yyyy protocols'. Only once a 'speech' protocol is negotiated
between the ends of the link does the phone actually ring. Of course, this
requires Mr Donohue to purchase a phone with this facility. However, such a
phone could also route calls around his fax, modem, answering machine &amp;WHY,
and would provide a better solution than the various 'smart boxes' currently
on the market.  Or we could sit back and wait for the Coming Of Broadband
ISDN/ATM.

  In <A HREF="/Risks/16.26.html">RISKS-16.26</A> Bill Donahue writes of an incident of a 'modem' dialing his
home and giving him and his wife some apparent cause for worry for their
safety.

    I'm not so sure I'd call his experience a fatality on the info-bahn,
maybe a pebble on the windshield(!).

  I had a similar experience when a local school district put my home phone
number into their FAX machine as the number for the local TV station.  I'd
get calls every 5 minutes for random amounts of time and random times of
the day.  By the time I'd run upstairs and get my fax software ready to go
(faxes have a "chirp" from the calling to caller machines that make it easy to
tell it was a fax) it would stop.  Then it would quit for days or weeks...

  I finally caught them, read the organization from the top of the fax,
and called.  They were profusely sorry but...

  I wonder tho, most of the failure here was purely human - mis-setting the
number and then failing to notice that the fax never got sent to its 
intended recipient.  I'd assume the machine would somehow tell the operator 
that an automatic retry had failed after &lt;x&gt; attempts.  But then again, when
I called it took a bit to explain what the problem was to them....

Bill Donahue's experience at least happened "all at once." We had the
misfortune to get a new phone number which had once been that of a genealogy
BBS -- it took us a few weeks to realize that this number was being shared by
genealogy buffs all over the world! For several reasons, we could not change
our number. The calls continued at the rate of 2 to 3 a week for over a year!
I put appeals on a number of FORUMS in PRODIGY &amp; Compuserve (DO NOT CALL
512-250-xxxx) and after 18 months the calls are down to about one or two a
month.

My TAD response, you might believe, is just a trifle surly!

Thanks to Mr. Donahue for posting the interesting anecdote about the
heavy-breathing modem.

Periodically over the years, people have set their fax machine to dialing my
voice line instead of my fax line.  Some of the fax machines have been quite
persistent; usually the fax operator will notice the repeated failures and
call up to complain that my fax machine isn't responding.  However, in one
case, the maddening thing dialed me up every ten minutes for over two hours. I
fixed _that_ one by hooking my fax machine to my voice line just before the
next scheduled interruption and actually receiving the fax.

It would make sense for fax and modem manufacturers to distinguish between a
non-responding telephone line (no answer or busy) and a non-responding
_device_.  Most modems can generate an error message (e.g., "VOICE") when
appropriately programmed; it would be helpful if both fax machines and modems
treated an answer-but-no-tone event by alerting the operator immediately
instead of mindlessly redialing.

I've said it before and I'll say it again.

Modems and fax machines should be programmed that on an outgoing call, until
they establish a connection, they play a digitized recording along the lines
of "This is a modem call" -- and there should be an AT command to append
"from xxx-xxx-xxxx" Of course, this isn't the kind of feature that will cause
many potential customers to choose your line over someone else's.

- Andrew Greene

    [Bob Frankston suggested once again that we should have some redundant
    check digits on phone numbers as well, to minimize wrong numbers.  
    Our subsequent off-line discussion went into how knowledge of the 
    algorithm would not prevent people from fabricating consistent but 
    incorrect numbers.  I just thought I'd mention it...  PGN]

Hoods Hit the Highway; Computer users warned of scams

By Charlotte Anne Lucas
Austin Bureau of The Dallas Morning News
Dallas Morning News, 1 July 1994, 
REPRINTED WITH PERMISSION OF THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS

AUSTIN -- Computer users, beware: Driving on the information highway,
it's possible to get fleeced.

Scam artists have hit the cyberspace, offering high-tech ponzi schemes,
sending illegal electronic chain letters and hyping virtually worthless
stock, according to state securities regulators across the nation.

In Texas, regulators say an Austin retiree lost $10,000 in a fake mutual
fund deal sold by a man who promoted his "money managing" skills through
an on-line computer service.

"The danger here is that cyberspace, which could be a beneficial way for
consumers to do a better job of informing themselves, will instead be
discredited as a haven for fast-buck artists," said Denise Voigt
Crawford, the Texas Securities Commissioner.

In New Jersey and Missouri on Thursday, securities regulators filed
cease and desist orders against promoters who used computer links to
tout allegedly fraudulent deals.  Texas regulators say it is likely that
they will seek an indictment in the case of the nonexistent mutual fund.

But with nearly 4 million computer users nationwide linked into
commercial computer services and 20 million people on the internet,
a world-wide computer network, "it is almost too big to police
effectively," said Jared Silverman, chief of the New Jersey Bureau of
Securities and chairman of a multi-state team that investigates computer
fraud.

In response, regulators in all 50 states issued a bulletin to
investigators, describing the potential frauds and listing steps small
investors can take to protect themselves.  "We're trying to tell people
to be careful," said Ms. Crawford, "there is a new fraud on the
horizon."

Although regulators are concerned about the problem, Ms. Crawford
acknowledges enforcement will be a challenge.  Because electronic
conversations, or E-mail, are considered private, "we don't know what
difficulties we are going to have getting subpoenas enforced or what
kind of cooperation we will get from (commercial bulletin board
systems)." [sic]

Officials say promoters tend to advertise offers or stock tips on the
financial bulletin board sections of on-line computer services such as
CompuServe, America Online and Prodigy, or in the specialized discussion
forums in the Internet.

Regulators said that of 75,000 messages posted on one computer service
bulletin board during a recent two-week period, 5,600 were devoted to
investment topics.  While some commercial computer bulletin board
services try to control the publicly posted investment tips, most do not
try to control most communications on the service.

What begins as innocent E-mail can end with an unwary investor "getting
cleaned out by high-tech schemers," said Ms. Crawford.

In Texas, the case under investigation began when an Austin retiree
posted a public note in a commercial bulletin board system looking for
conversations about the stock market, according to John A. Peralta,
deputy director of enforcement at the Texas Securities Board.

"He was contacted.  It turned into a private E-mail conversation, a
telephone conversation and then exchanges through the mail," said
Mr. Peralta.  But the person who promoted himself on the computer as a
skilled money manager turned out to be unlicensed -- and the mutual fund
the retiree invested in turned out to be nonexistent.

Mr. Peralta said at least one other person, not from Texas, invested
$90,000 in the same deal, "We are aware of two, but we don't really
know," he said.  "There may be dozens of victims."

Securities regulators began taking interest in on-line scams last fall,
after Mr. Silverman -- a computer junkie -- raised the issue at a
national meeting of regulators.  "I heard stories about things going on
on computer bulletin board services, and I have been monitoring these
things for close to a year," he said.

In fact, the New Jersey case came from Mr. Siverman's off-hours cruising
of an on-line service.  "I sit at a keyboard two hours a day -- to the
chagrin of my wife -- scanning these things," he said.

What he found was a promoter pushing an E-mail chain letter.  The
promoter, identified only as from San Antonio, claimed that in exchange
for $5, investors could earn $60,000 in three to six weeks.

Regulators said participants were told to send $1 to each of five people
on a list in the computer bulletin board, add their own name to the list
and post it on 10 different computer bulletin board sites.

That, regulators said in a statement, "amounted to a high-tech
variation on the old pyramid scam, which is barred by federal and state
laws."

In Missouri, regulators Thursday moved against an unlicensed stockbroker
for touting his services and "making duubious [sic] claims for stocks
not registered for sale in the state."  Among other things, regulators
said, the promoter falsely claimed that Donald Trump was a "major,
behind-the-scenes player in a tiny cruise line" whose stock he pitched.

Ms. Crawford said that while computer users may be sophisticated in some
ways, they still are attractive targets because they tend to have
discretionary income and frequently are looking for ways to invest their
money.

Some of the commercial services also allow users to use various aliases,
making it all the more difficult for investigators to figure out who
they are really communication with.

Usually law enforcement's arguments for regulated encryption center around 
their ability to tap criminal's conversations. In the Netherlands this 
discussion has taken a whole new twist when Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf 
laid hands on phone-tap recordings not from the police, but from 
criminals who had tapped various high police officials' home and work 
phones. Needless to say the newspaper published transcripts of the 
recordings which proved to be quite interesting. (Proving police used 
several illegal means of gathering evidence and revealing a lot of 
internal trouble in the police dept.)

Soon after publication police officials called for more funding to be 
able to buy encryption  devices. Was this just naivety on the part of the 
police to assume criminals couldn't wire-tap or was it an isolated 
incident where the criminals got lucky? Evidence supports only the first 
assumption. Hopefully this incident will lead to more discussion on 
encryption technology. A while ago legislation was proposed to ban 
encryption without having a permit for such devices. This proposal was 
cut down in light of strong opposition from industry and commerce. After 
that, no-one in the Netherlands really took up the issue, which I think 
we all agree upon is one of the most important ones of the information age.

Oh, the RISK? I dunno, but I think it's obvious :-)

&gt;From the United Press International newswire (94.07.21 @ 12:17 EDST) via
CompuServe's Executive News Service (GO ENS):

Ants help BT improve computers

By SIMONA de LOGU

   "LONDON, July 21 (UPI) -- British Telecom scientists are exploring ways of
making computer programs more robust and adaptable by using ant colonies as
models for interactive programs that respond to changing conditions in computer
networks. 
   A team of computer specialists based at BT's Martlesham Heath
laboratories in Ipswich, east England, has been studying research material
on ants for the past two years and using their findings on developing
programs."


Key points from the article:
 
o	"Our system is made up of small, autonomous, reactive, mobile
blocks of computer code that interact in a way derived from ant behavior,"
said scientist Simon Steward. "The control system that emerges from all of
these mobile software agents working together is inherently adaptable and
robust unlike normal computer programs."

o	The goal of the work is to prevent system crashes when an
unanticipated [PGN, please forbear] condition occurs.

o	The distributed computing model uses message-passing to coordinate
computation.

o	"The programs are mobile like ants, moving from one computer to
another, when needed."

o	After making software or parameter changes, the "mobile programs"
would "leave messages for other programs on how the system has been
adapted."

o	Modules will display "a certain amount of random behavior...."
   
o	The system will display heuristic, goal-seeking behaviour.


[Comments from MK follow:]

Programs that move from system to system are usually called worms.  The
work described above is related to Von Neumann's concepts of cellular
automata, and I guess would count as an example of "artificial life" or
a-life.  The idea that semi-autonomous computer programs would migrate
from place to place reminds one of the debate about "useful viruses."

I was getting antsy about this (the idea was really bugging me), so I
searched on "ant or ants" in the Ziff Computer Database Plus (GO COMPDB on
CompuServe) and located an article in Computergram International (June 10,
1994), p. 15 entitled, "British Telecom's research lab claims to have
found the fastest Travelling Salesman algorithm."  In this application,
which runs on a single RISC workstation, "The search algorithm is set in
motion on a problem to find the shortest travelling distance between
several cities, for example.  In effect a whole series of `ants' are
thrown on a map of the area and if the system doesn't find a destination
city, it dies, whereas if it does find a chosen destination city it `gives
birth' and grows."  A path is then established between cities.  The
algorithm is very fast--two seconds for a 100-point optimization problem
and 2.5 minutes for 1000 points.

All this is fascinating, and I naturally wondered about the implications
for system reliability.  Turning back to the UPI story, it seems to me
that there must be a lot of work to include quality assurance principles
into heuristic, semi-autonomous algorithms that change system or network
configuration.  The consequences of malfunction increase when the problems
occur in control structures e.g., a hole in your hose can swamp your lawn,
but a bug in your electronic shutoff valve that reverses inputs (off -&gt;
on) can really put a bee in your bonnet.

One of the main objections to free-roaming software worms and viruses is
that they (themselves) offer no opportunity for a system manager or owner
to block their activity (one can usually do so with antivirus tools,
though).  When a system is seeded with these rogue programs, one never
knows what will flower.  Who wants untested software making changes in her
computer system?  Similarly, how do we cope with "genetic" algorithms that
spontaneously make changes in, say, operating system tables or even
executable code?  How does one test a real-time change in the operating
system?

It will be interesting to follow this work and see how concerns for reliability
are worked into this evolving field.

Many denizens of the Internet think of it as a place of untrammeled free
speech and decentralized democracy.  Evidence is accumulating that it's
more complicated than that.  Writing in the liberal journal _The Nation_,
Jon Wiener (a historian at UC Irvine whose does a sort of investigative
journalism) outlines some of the complications.  The full reference is:

  Jon Wiener, Free Speech on the Internet, The Nation 258(23), 13 June 
  1994, pages 825-828.

He describes the Karla Homolka trial in Canada, a group of Turks who swamp
newsgroups with automatic messages denying the Armenian genocide, gun
activists taking over alt.motherjones, libel suits provoked by on-line
statements, gender imbalances, abusive behavior by unreformed net-guys,
and more.  None of which means the net is bad; it just means the net is
part of reality.  At one level the Risk is computer-related: bad stuff can
happen on-line, just like in real life.  But the real Risk comes from
believing the hype: just because it's decentralized doesn't make it
democratic.  If we want democracy we have to actively make it.  Just like
in real life.

The past week I have been getting filled-out copies of a survey form completed
by beta users of the netsurf.com services.  Each day up to a half-dozen of
these forms would show up in my Internet mailbox.

Evidently the problem caused by three factors: (1) the original survey form
had in the "cc:" field the listserv address for mailing to the entire beta
user group, (2) many of the beta users had "reply to all" set as the default
for their mailer software, and (3) the folks at netsurf.com hat configured
their listserver to remail the incoming Emails with the completed forms back
out to the addresses on their beta user list.

The only interesting thing about getting the completed survey forms is
that most of the respondents to the survey seemed to be middle-aged males
with "erotica" as one of their interests in using the Internet.  Netsurf's
questionnaire specifically stated that they had no interest in invading
anyone's privacy, so that the questionnaire would be effectively
confidential, even though they could not guarantee that formally.

Notes Emailed to netsurf.com had no effect.  Finally, out of frustration,
I did a "reply to all" on one of the incoming forms with a note about the
problem back out to the same listserver.  Although this was an act of
"spamming" on its own, it did get the people at netsurf.com to address
(intentional pun) the problem.

A last note: I got a note from netsurf.com blaming __me__ and all those users
who had set "reply to all" as the default in their mail software for spamming
their beta user list, rather than admitting that they had overlooked the
possible effects of their listserver and mailing configuration.

By the way -- this is being sent with a cc: to netsurf.com.

Subject: Leahy Statement on Gore Statement on Clipper

                U.S. SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY, Vermont

                      STATEMENT OF PATRICK LEAHY ON
                VICE PRESIDENT GORE'S CLIPPER CHIP LETTER

                              July 21, 1994

     I have read the July 20th letter from the Vice President about the 
Administration's current thinking on Clipper Chip and, to my mind, it 
represents no change in policy.  In fact, when this letter was sent, I 
would be surprised if the Administration even thought it was news.

     The letter makes clear to me that the Administration continues to 
embrace key escrow encryption technology, and stands behind Clipper Chip 
as a federal standard for telephone communications.  The official 
standard makes clear that this standard applies to any communications 
over telephone lines.  Those communications include not only voice, but 
also low-speed computer data and facsimile messages.  The Administration 
is working on encryption technologies for higher-speed transmissions, 
such as for computer networks and video networks.

     The Vice President says that they want to work with industry to 
design a key escrow system that could be implemented not just in 
hardware, but also in software, that would be voluntary, exportable and 
not rely upon a classified encoding formula.  The Administration said all 
this last February when the federal standard was approved.  Yet, when 
Administration witnesses were questioned about the progress they had made 
in this effort at my Judiciary subcommittee hearing in early May, I 
learned they had held only a few meetings.

     Last week, the Appropriations Committee accepted strong Report 
language I suggested on Clipper Chip.  The Attorney General is directed 
to report to Congress within four months on ten areas of concern about 
Clipper Chip.

     I agree with the Vice President that balancing economic and privacy 
needs with law enforcement and national security is not always an easy 
task.  But we can do better than Clipper Chip.

                           CALL FOR PAPERS
1995 IEEE Symposium on                              May 8-10, 1995
Security and Privacy                    	Oakland, California
  
                             sponsored by
  IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy
                         in cooperation with
    The International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR)

The Symposium on Security and Privacy has for fifteen years been the
premier forum for the presentation of developments in computer security,
and for bringing together researchers and practitioners in the field.

This year, we seek to build on this tradition of excellence by
re-emphasizing work on engineering and applications as well as theoretical
advances.  We also seek to broaden the scope of the Symposium by
introducing new topics.  We want to hear not only about new theoretical
results, but also about work in the design and implementation of secure
systems and work on policy relating to system security.  We are
particularly interested in papers on policy and technical issues relating
to privacy in the context of the information infrastructure, papers that
relate software and system engineering technology to the design of secure
systems, and papers on hardware and architectural support for secure
systems.

The symposium will focus on technical aspects of security and privacy as
they arise in commercial and industrial applications, as well in
government and military systems.  It will address advances in the theory,
design, implementation, analysis, and application of secure computer
systems, and in the integration and reconciliation of security and privacy
with other critical system properties such as reliability and safety.
Topics in which papers and panel session proposals are invited include,
but are not limited to, the following:


Secure systems   	Privacy Issues 		Access controls  
Security verification 	Network security  	Policy modeling 
Information flow 	Authentication 		Database security 
Data integrity  	Security Protocols      Viruses and worms
Auditing	        Biometrics		Smartcards
Commercial and industrial security		Intrusion Detection
Security and other critical system properties   Distributed systems

A new feature of the symposium this year will be a special session of
very brief (5-minute) talks.  Our goal is to make it possible for us to
hear from people who are advancing the field in the areas of system
design and implementation, and who would like to present their ideas to
the symposium audience but may lack the time and resources needed to
prepare a full paper.  Submissions for this session will be accepted
up to five weeks before the symposium, to permit us to hear of the most
recent developments. Abstracts of these talks will be distributed at
the conference. 

INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS:

I have started to get strange email requests wanting to chat with me about
security, DES encryption standards, and advice on how to get rid of hackers
who are intruding on their machines.  When I reply that I am not a security
expert, the replies have been equally as weird.  I found out that somebody has
published a book called "Email Addresses of the Rich and Famous" (of which I
am neither) and that I am listed on the center of page 8 as a security expert.
Apparently, my entry is not the only error in this book.

	Godin, Seth "E-MAIL addresses of the Rich &amp; Famous"
	Copyright 1994 by Seth Godin Productions, Inc.
	Addison-Wesley Publishing Company Inc.
	ISBN: 0201408937

This book appears to be on the same level as those who sell maps and addresses
to the stars homes in Hollywood (and about as accurate), and I am appalled
that a reputable publisher like Addison-Wesley would be involved in such an
obviously unchecked invasion of privacy.  The time involved in dealing with
this unwanted mail is starting to interfere with my work.  Can I sue?  Is this
happening to other readers of the RISKS Forum?

I wrote to the editor of my software safety book at Addison-Wesley and asked
him to get me the name and email address of the $!&amp;^%# editor at
Addison-Wesley responsible for this so I can post his/her address on the
alt.sex.kinky bboard :-).

[Taken from Ford UK's (free) magazine for drivers, without permission.]

Car thieves who broke into a Ford driving event at Oulton Park in Cheshire,
has a nasty surprise when the car they pinched turned out to be a specialised
reverse steer Fiesta equipped with an upside down steering rack.

Used normally to improve driver's co-ordination and concentration, it is an
exceptionally difficult vehicle to drive, requiring the driver to think in
opposites. However, the thieves were not to know this.

Attempting to turn left out of the main exit, they turned instead straight
into a concrete bollard on the right. Dazed but unhurt they escaped on foot.

Reuter (94.07.24 @ 23:19 EDST) via CompuServe's Executive News Service 
(GO ENS):

  CHINA JAILS FOUR FOR COMPUTER FRAUD

  BEIJING, July 24 (Reuter) - In one of China's first officially reported
  cases of computer crime, four Beijing hoteliers have been jailed for
  cheating guests by manipulating computerised billing records.
    Beijing Friendship Hotel managers Jiang Zheng and Du Yize, were sentenced
  to seven years, the state-run Legal Daily reported on Sunday. Two
  co-defendants were given three- and one-year terms."

Key points in the article:

o	Computer fraud a growing problem in China.

o	Two managers embezzled about U$9,000 from guests from Feb-May 93.

o	"They connived to use the computer to cancel or change hotel accounts,
alter the records of 39 cash receipts and make fraudulent reports of daily
hotel accounts," the report said.

[MK: This is clearly a case where Peking at your hotel bill is a good idea
before you pay.][Apologies to PGN.]

&gt;From the Washington Post newswire (94.07.23) via CompuServe's Executive News
Service:

  D.C. Residents Shocked by Gas Bill for $2,248
  By Daniel Southerland, Washington Post Staff Writer 
 
  Rachel Carlson, a law student on a tight budget, was shocked when she
  opened the mail recently and found a monthly gas bill for $2,248.28.
  Carlson, 23, and four others sharing a brick house in the District had been
  paying bills ranging from $50 to $60 a month."

The story continues with the explanation.  Seems the gas-meter reader had been
unable to get into the house to read the meter, so the Washington Gas
estimated usage for three years.  When they finally got a reading, they
invoiced the tenants for the unpaid difference between reality and estimation.

The mildly interesting portion of story for RISKS and NCSAFORUM readers is
that the company will be installing low-intensity FM transponders "by March
1995 in all of the homes that currently are receiving estimated bills....  A
van drives by the house and sends a `wake-up' signal to a unit attached to the
gas meter.  The meter reading is transmitted to the computer in the van and
then to the company's billing department."

Now, this scenario brings up a couple of RISKS that correspondents in the
Washington, DC area might like to investigate (and report back to RISKS or the
NCSAFORUM):

1) Integrity: what is the reliability of the system?  How is a low error-rate
ensured in the transmissions?

2) Confidentiality: how easy would it be for Nasty People Interested in
Robbing Houses to tap the gas-meter signals?  For all the automated timers
attempting to camouflage the residents' absence, a gas meter showing little or
no usage would indicate that absence for extended periods.  I think this is a
minor threat, but fun to think about for a few seconds.

3) Robustness: how easy would it be for Nasty People Interested in General
Havoc to jam / spoof / corrupt the data transmissions?  For that matter, is
there any other source of interference which might cause faulty readings?  One
can imagine bills for $22,482.80 if Rotting Rotifer the local criminal hacker
decides to have his bit of fun while the Gas Van is roaming about the
neighbourhood.

RISKS readers tired of real-world security will seize the opportunity to have
a gas investigating this new threat to world peace and prosperity &lt;g&gt;.

A friend recently sent me a copy of the "Hacking FAQ" (Frequently Asked
Questions) that was posted to alt.2600 on July 9, 1994. (I wasn't able to find
it in our Usenet archives, but we purge often.) It was posted by
"<A HREF="mailto:will@gnu.ai.mit.edu">will@gnu.ai.mit.edu</A> (Will Spencer). It's too long to include in Risks, but
may be copied from the Risks ftp archives as [[***]].  This note summarizes
the 20 page, 30,000 byte original.

The FAQ has two main sections: hacking computers (mostly Unix) and telephone
systems.

Hacking Computers:
-- A list of programs for guessing passwords for Unix and VMS (both store
   passwords in a one-way encrypted fashion).
-- Getting the list of encrypted passwords, even if they are shadowed or
   otherwise hidden on Unix. Getting the list of encrypted passwords from VMS.
-- Breaking out of restricted Unix shells. Becoming root on Unix (an 8 line
   program), erasing yourself from the Unix logs (a 1 1/2 page program).
-- Faking mail by using Telnet. Faking News postings.

Phone system hacking:
-- Description of red, blue, and black boxes. These are (traditionally),
   small boxes with components that defeat telephone security, letting you
   make calls for free. For example, a red box mimics the sounds that money
   makes when coins are deposited in a pay phone. You can make one by
   changing the crystal in a tone dialer, or by recording the tones on
   a Hallmark "record your message" greeting card.
-- A list of every "box" color, and a brief description of what it does.
-- Finding the number of the telephone you're calling from. Traditionally,
   this is done by calling telephone-company provided services that were
   created for phone workers. The new method is to use the ANI service that
   delivers the calling phone number to 800 and 900 service providers:
   call (800) 471-8859. "It is an 800 phone sex line. The system will give
   you an account number. The first 10 digits of the account number will
   be the telephone number from which you are calling." (I haven't tested
   this since I don't particularly want my home phone number in their
   database.)
-- Ringback numbers: these ring the phone from which it's called.
-- Loop numbers: a loop is two telephone numbers linked together. if you
   call one number and your collegue calls the other number, you will
   be able to talk to each other.
-- Reverse directory numbers: given a (listed) number, it returns the
   subscribers name and address. Two companies provide this information
   via 900 numbers, charging about one dollar per minute.

Internet sites of interest:
-- FTP sites; many seem to have encryption software.
-- Usenet newsgroups. alt.2600, alt.dcom.telecom, alt.hackers, etc. comp.risks
   is not mentioned, but perhaps we're not that interesting.
-- WWW sites, including what appears to be two belonging to Gene Spafford,
   who is a computer security expert.
-- IRC (Internet Relay Chat) sites. IRC is an internet broadcast facility.
-- Hacking IRC to hide your username, and to hack ChanOp.
-- one BBS site

I don't think that giving the Hack FAQ greater publicity in Risks is a serious
risk in itself: the bad guys know this stuff, and it is useful for the rest
of us to realize just how limited, for example, Unix security really is. For
example, I hadn't realized that it was so easy to get the encrypted password
list on VMS, and that it was so easy to get system privileges on Unix.

[From the Baltimore Sun, July 23, 1994]

it's combined with computer databases (which never "lie") it is even
worse. I've edited out the noise/filler with [...].

Couple mistakenly listed as abusers lost in court
No rights violation found by judges
By Anne Haddad, Sun Staff Writer

	David and Marsha Hodge were mistakenly listed as child molesters in a
state database for two years without a chance to know it or to correct the
error.
	But that did not violate the Taylorsville family's civil rights or
invade its privacy, three judges in the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals in
Richmond, VA., ruled this week.
	The decision overturns one by Judge Herbert F. Murray in US District
Court in Baltimore in September, 1992.
	"While it is true that such records may be expunged," the appeals
court ruled, "there is no *automatic* right to expunction once an individual's
name has been cleared."
	Mr. Hodge says he plans to appeal the ruling.
[...]
	"There is no constitutional right ro have the state destroy records of
an investigation," Ms. Cannon [MD Attorney General's Office] said. "The fact
that the records exist does not hurt them. That's the key." [...]
	In January, 1989, a misdiagnosis of 3-month-old Joseph Hodge's swollen
arm led a pediatrician to report possible child abuse. The doctor thought it
was a fracture, bu the swelling was a bone infection later diagnosed and
treated surgically at Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore.  [...]
	David and Marsha Hodge, both scientists who hold national security
clearances for their jobs, said the listing in the state database could harm
them, but the court said that claim was not tangible.
	The judge said that because of the confidentiality of records in abuse
investigations, "we see no avenue by which a stigma or defamation labelling
the Hodges as child abusers could attach."  

----Article Ends----

	The judge's finding is particularly amusing in the light of recent
revelations of widespread accesses of IRS databases by curious employees [Sen
Glenn announced some 1300 IRS employees are being disciplined for "browsing"
databases.]  -- any database that is not properly secured, which contains
personal information, can cause someone problems. What's frustrating about
these stories is that the technologies exist today to provide "need to know"
access and good audit trail for confidential databases. Moral: Don't trust
someone else to keep their facts about you straight.

Here's another instance of how careless use of a listserver produced an
unintended deluge in subscribers' mailboxes.

An associate editor of the American Journalism Review (a paper magazine) was
researching an article about the plagaristic practice known as
"rip-and-read"; i.e., radio reporters reading print articles over the air,
sometimes verbatim, without giving credit. The AJR editor posted a message
on a professional journalists' mail list called SPJ-Online, asking print
reporters to send him "rip-and-read" anecdotes. 

However, the editor neglected to include a private address for replies.
Apparently, many respondents sent their messages to the SPJ-Online
listserver, which dutifully posted them to every subscriber. 

I ran across this story in a humorous weekly on-line newsletter, BONG BULL
(Bulletin of the Burnt-Out Newspapercreatures' Guild), which described the
spamming as "an avalanche" and added this comment:

&gt; Which is no way to protect a scoop.
&gt; But that's AJR's problem, isn't it?

Bill Donahue harassment by an automated caller is simply a new version of
the old problem of bad data inputs attached to systems that did not take
into account the possibility of such erroneous inputs. Workers in
hospitals have long been aware that the tiniest of erroneous keystrokes
can have grave consequences, as have (though with less concern,
apparently) workers in large bureaucracies (the old stories of people who
had "died" in the Social Security System comes to mind).  
I recently had the idea that any output "downstream" of a manual input be 
presented to all user interfaces in cursive script, so that the user is 
aware that keystroke errors are a possibility. 

A separate kind of computer risk is represented in several threads in
RISKS is the use of expert systems or near expert systems in scenarios not
envisioned by the designers (auto-pilots, safety and anti-theft systems
linked to airbag deployment, and others). Here is a much newer kind of
risk that will become more apparent as AI enters the mainstream,
particularly as the mainstream seems oblivious to the differences between
standard computer programs and AI. In one, all possible scenarios are
supposedly thought out by the programmer, and errors generally result from
inputs. Proper escape mechanisms (un-deceasing a Social Security
number, for instance) can be anticipated by simply analyzing input error
possibilities. In the other, all possible scenarios by definition cannot
be thought out. Yet more global escape routines or even better, 
systems that automatically question human users about unusual scenarios 
it finds itself in, have not been added to make the system sensitive to 
its limitations. That is, people are designing, using and trusting AI and 
quasi AI systems in the same way they have dealt with standard computer 
programs.

In the case of Mr. Donahue's tele-nightmare a convergent solution might 
be an expert system that alerts autocaller users to any phone number that 
results in a certain number of failure to connect.

While readers of RISKS will continue to call for such common sense
measures, the real problem remains a public that has inappropriate
expectations and understanding of modern computer systems. We are still in
the era where chainsaws have been handed out without any clear explanation
of how they differ from axes.

At our old building, we had a non-PBX line into the computer room.  It
was hooked to a Radio Shack environmental monitor, which would detect
high temp, noise, etc. and call a list of phone numbers until someone
responded.  That part worked fine.  But we started getting wrong numbers
-- we'd be in the room and hear the phone ring, and the robot would pick
up and start talking, but nobody who worked there would own up to it.
This happened several times per day -- too many even for telemarketing
-- and we couldn't figure it out for the longest time.  Then one day I
was driving home and heard an ad on the radio for a suicide hotline, in
nearby Maryland -- at number (301) 685-0525.  Our robot's line was
(703) 685-0525!  So some poor depressed person would get it together
enough to call the number, but without the 301, and would get a robot
saying "This is telephone number 6 8 5 0 5 2 5, the time is xx:yy,
temperature is OK, noise level is OK, alert 1 is OK, alert 2 is OK,
listen to the surrounding area for 15 seconds", after which it would
switch on a microphone so they could either uninterrupted hear machine
room noise or machine room noise with people saying "Hey, the robot's
talking" "Yeah, it does that" "Wow, weird" and the like.

I shudder to think of whether there were any lasting ill effects of this
problem.  The good news is that shortly after discovering it, we moved to a
new building with a new number.

On what species of ant are they modelling their software automata? 

A few possibilities occurred to me:- 

Army ants: These form nice quiet little colonies for a while, then (when
population pressure builds up to a certain level) they change their
life-style, and go on a random march through the jungle (read "usenet"? :-)
devouring everything in their path.

Leaf-cutter ants: These carve up leaves and take them back to their colonies
where they chew them into a mulch on which they grow an edible fungus.

Honey-pot ants: Some individuals "volunteer" (i.e., are "programmed" in BT's
terms) to hang from the roof of the nest and be fed by the others.  Their
abdomens become grossly distended with the digested food, which the other
members of the colony then suck out of them.

Pharoah's ant: A small variety emanating (as its name suggests) from Egypt, 
which is notorious for being able to get into *anything*. There are reports 
of surgeons opening sealed sterile dressings in the operating theatre, only 
to be confronted by a cute little ant waving its feelers. 

The common British black ant: This forms neat little nests, usually under a
crack in your kitchen floor, from where they make daily raids on your larder.
According to entomologists (see ref. [1] below), these follow well-trodden
trails each day, except that 10% of the individuals are more adventurous than
the others, and persist in discovering new places to find food, instead of
just following the rest. Every year, a set of winged fertile females is
hatched and fly off at random to mate and found new colonies in totally
unpredictable places (but probably under that other crack in your kitchen
floor! :-).

The red ant: Similar to the black ant, but capable of biting through the skin
and injecting painful amounts of formic acid if disturbed. Members of a colony
recognise each other by smell. A colony that gets too large splits in two, and
the members of the break-away colony develop a different smell, so that, if
they come across members of the parent colony, there is a fight to the death.

The termite (and before any entomologist jumps down my throat, let me say I am
well aware that termites, although colloquially referred to as "white ants"
are not "ants" at all): This builds truly impressive hills of chewed and
hardened mud up to 20 feet tall. They are averse to light, and very skillful
at building covered tunnels to get to where they want to be, i.e., to the
nearest available source of cellulose (read "software library"? :-) which they
devour with unbelievable voracity. When my father served in India during the
war, everything had to be kept in steel trunks, otherwise the little darlings
would make short work of your spare uniform! :-) Termites come in various
forms: the queen is an enormous sluggish thing whose sole function is to lay
eggs to make new termites. The soldiers are ferocious things with big jaws
which rush to any breach in the nest and fight off the attacker. The workers
are sterile females whose job is to tend the eggs and larvae and build the
nest and tunnels by chewing and piling up pellets of mud which harden like
concrete when mixed with their secretions.

QUESTION: Which species could BT be thinking of? 

Returning to the key points from the article (as presented by Mich):- 

&gt; o	"Our system is made up of small, autonomous, reactive, mobile
&gt; blocks of computer code that interact in a way derived from ant behavior,"
&gt; said scientist Simon Steward. "The control system that emerges from all of
&gt; these mobile software agents working together is inherently adaptable and
&gt; robust unlike normal computer programs."

Must be worker termites. Entomologists have developed models of termite 
building behaviour which allow for the construction of large nests from 
very simple rules, e.g., "pile up mud pellets on top of one another, unless 
the worker nearest to you has made a taller pile than you have, in which 
case, stop working on your pile and help her to build hers". 

OK, termites don't need to be too bright to build fancy nests, but is the 
resulting structure of any use to humans? If the requirement for the overall 
system is simply "I want big towers of chewed mud stuck at random over the 
landscape", then the "termite worker" model might just be the one we want. 

&gt; o	The goal of the work is to prevent system crashes when an
&gt; unanticipated [...] condition occurs.

Must be modelled on warrior termites. Simply rush to the hole in the nest 
(read "system") and chew the head off anything in sight! 

&gt; o	The distributed computing model uses message-passing to coordinate
&gt; computation.

Like using smell to communicate messages such as "Follow me to the food!"? 

&gt; o	"The programs are mobile like ants, moving from one computer to
&gt; another, when needed."

Army ants? The flying form of the common black ant? 

&gt; o	After making software or parameter changes, the "mobile programs"
&gt; would "leave messages for other programs on how the system has been
&gt; adapted."

"The fungus garden is over here!" "Nip up that rose-bush and milk those 
aphids!" 

&gt; o	Modules will display "a certain amount of random behavior...."

Really? There's a surprise! :-) 

&gt; o	The system will display heuristic, goal-seeking behaviour.

Whose goals? The statement is correct. An ant colony *does* display exactly 
such behaviour, and the behaviour of the colony is more complex than the 
behaviour of the individual. A colony of social insects behaves more like 
a single organism than a collection of individuals. This is due to the 
distribution of genes among the colony (all workers are half-sisters of 
the queen [ref. 2 below]). Next time you dig a wasps' nest out of a pile 
of garden rubbish (as I once made the mistake of doing) you could make 
sense of the consequences by reflecting that you have just been attacked 
by an animal the size of a small dog with 3,000 venomous teeth! :-) 

The "goals" of an insect colony [ref. 2], however, are:- 

1. Feed  2. Breed (or vice versa) 

Can we be sure that our software "ant colony" would stick to *our* goals? 

&gt; All this is fascinating, and I naturally wondered about the implications
&gt; for system reliability. 

So did I! :-) 

Reliability is defined as: The probability that the system (i.e., the 
environment in which the "ant colony" "lives") will perform a required 
function for a given period of time under given conditions. 

If the system is continually modified by software "ants" the implications 
are not obvious, and my gut reaction is that chaotic behaviour could manifest 
itself. Could the ants actually modify the required system behaviour? 
If so, will they also rewrite the functional spec.? :-) 

&gt; It will be interesting to follow this work and see how concerns for 
&gt; reliability are worked into this evolving field.

I agree that the implications for reliability are interesting, but that 
is all that I can be adam-ant about at the moment! :-)

Nasdaq once again was shut down by an energetic squirrel who apparently
chomped on a power line near the stock market's computer center in Trumbull,
Connecticut, yesterday.  The system failed to perform the automatic
switchover to the temporary backup power supply (designed to last until the
backup system in Rockville, Maryland, could be brought up), and consequently
the market was down for 34 minutes.  A similar problem occurred in December
1987.  (A 2.5-hour outage on 15 July was reported in <A HREF="/Risks/16.25.html">RISKS-16.25</A>, due to
risky software upgrades.)

According to the Washington Post newswire (94.08.01 via CompuServe's Executive
News Service), MCI's inbound Internet gateways were saturated last month,
resulting in days of delay in delivery to MCI customers.

I had a really interesting experience in one of our labs today, an
electrician was adding a new outlet into an office and tied the outlet into a
junction point in the dropped ceiling.  While tying in the neutral line he
let the 'home-run' neutral line (the one going back to the main 3-phase
distribution I assume) come loose from the junction.  After a minute he
discovered this at reconnected it... he didn't notice a thing.  All of us in
our offices however were really charged up....  There was smoke, sparks and
crackling belching from numerous PCs, X terminals, surge protectors and
fluorescent lamps.

One of our programmers who is an EE figured that when he dropped the main
neutral the current instead started to flow between two branches of the three
phase and that one office had very little equipment turned on and the other
had great gobs of stuff powered up so that the office with everything turned
on had almost the full 220V across its outlets.  Total body count: 2 surge
protectors, a fan, and one Gateway 2000 (which was spewing sparks out of the
fan opening!) [I'm not a EE-minded person so hopefully I haven't botched this
description too bad]

Lessons:
1. Don't trust your surge protectors blindly, the Gateway that got fried
   was plugged into one.
2. Its worth the money to buy an autoswitching 110/220 power supply, the
   Gateway was right next to an RS/6000 that has an autoswitching supply.
   We figure the RS/6000 was running until the breakers blew... it just thought
   it had made a quick trip to Europe.  Another IBM machine with an auto
   supply made it too.

I would have thought that some type of automatic device could prevent these
type of overvoltages, but given the electrician's actions I guess not.  (This
electrical contractor was *real* happy when we discovered the RS/6000 wasn't
toast!)

I lost my checkbook a couple of weeks ago.  Despite turning the house inside
out that evening, I couldn't find it.  So, I called the bank and had them put
a watch on the account.  Yesterday, I found the checkbook.  (Wedged behind the
seat of the lawn mower, must have fallen when I was cleaning the garage.)  I
called the bank to cancel the watch, needing to tell them only the account
number and my name (printed on the check, naturally).  They didn't ask me my
mother's maiden name or anything.  Obviously, what's to stop a finder or thief
from making the same call?  I didn't raise this question then because I didn't
want to raise suspicion and have to go through some trouble to get the watch
lifted, but I will raise it with them on the next working day.

&gt;From the Reuter newswire (94.07.31 @ 21:10 EDST) via CompuServe's Executive
News Service:

"FBI HUNTING FOR AGENT STEAL, FLASHY COMPUTER HACKER.

    "LOS ANGELES, July 31 (Reuter) - The FBI is searching for a computer
hacker suspected of committing high-tech crimes at the same time he allegedly
worked undercover for the bureau catching other computer hackers, the Los
Angeles Times reported Sunday.
     The hacker, who goes by the moniker "Agent Steal" and whose real name is
Justin Tanner Petersen, vanished last October and is on the run from the very
federal agency -- the Federal Bureau of Investigation -- he told friends was
paying his rent and flying him to computer conferences to spy on other
hackers, the paper said."

Key points from the article:

o	Petersen admitted having committed computer crimes even while working
with federal prosecutors.

o	He is alleged to have cracked federal computers and stolen information
from a credit card information bureau.

o	He was involved in Kevin Poulson's fraudulent successes in radio
phone-in contests in L.A.

o	Petersen claimed to have been responsible for "nailing" Kevin Mitnick,
the infamous criminal hacker who is sought by authorities for breaking into
police computers and impersonating a police officer.

o	J. Michael Gibbons, an FBI computer crime specialist, is sceptical
that his agency ever hired Petersen: "It's not safe. Across the board, hackers
cannot be trusted to work -- they play both sides against the middle."

o	"Petersen was arrested in Texas in 1991, where a grand jury returned
an eight-count indictment accusing him of assuming false names, accessing a
computer without authorisation, possessing stolen mail and fraudulently
obtaining and using credit cards."

o	Convicted of six counts after pleading guilty, Petersen faces
imprisonment for up to 40 years plus a fine of $1.5 million.

o	"...[O]n Oct. 18, 1993, 15 months after entering his first guilty
plea, Petersen was confronted outside federal court by Assistant U.S. Attorney
David Schindler, who asked if Agent Steal had committed any crimes while free
on bail.
     "Petersen said he had, according to the federal prosecutor. Petersen fled
immediately after that meeting."

The Washington Post newswire (94.08.01; via CompuServe's Executive News
Service) provides an analysis of PCMCIA card problems:

"Add-In Card Standard: Good Plan, Bad Execution," by Brit Hume.

Hume summarizes the situation when the Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association (PCMCIA) was founded in 1990: lack of slot standards
made it difficult for manufacturers and users to have economical add-in
devices.  The new association devised three standards, but unfortunately the
bugs are not quite out yet.

The author describes the problems trying to work with a new PCMCIA fax/modem
card.  It worked OK with PC-DOS 6.1 but the drivers failed with DOS 6.2.

Even on 6.1, after resuming from both the "suspend" and "hibernate"
operations, the operating system had lost track of its PCMCIA port.  After
extensive discussion with IBM support, the writer got function back after
resuming from "suspend" but still lost the I/O port after "hibernate."

&gt;From the NIST UPDATE for 94.08.01:

ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS

   Paper Details EMF Shielding Theory

   In work supported by the Federal Aviation Administration, NIST
   researchers have developed a mathematical model and theory for
   predicting the electromagnetic field shielding effectiveness of large
   metal enclosures with apertures and interior loading. The model also
   should allow for estimations of the average field strength inside
   enclosures such as electronic equipment cases and aircraft bodies. It
   can be used for any enclosure regardless of size, shape, type of
   material and number of apertures, as well as for any frequency above
   a lower limit related to the dimensions of the enclosure. The model
   was experimentally evaluated using a rectangular aluminum cavity of
   about 0.57 cubic meter (approximately 20 cubic feet), with one
   aperture, and for a microwave frequency range from 1 gigahertz to 18
   gigahertz. The agreement between model and actual measurement was
   within 20 percent after a number of additional sources of loss were
   incorporated into the original model. A report, "Aperture Excitation
   of Electrically Large, Lossy Cavities" (NIST Technical Note 1361), is

The Associated Press newswire (94.07.28 and 29) via CompuServe's Executive News
Service) reported on the recent conviction of Internet porn peddlers

The following summary is based on reports by WOODY BAIRD and ELIZABETH WEISE, 
Associated Press Writers.  The first, by Baird, deals with the legal issues.

 "MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- A husband and wife were convicted of distributing
pornography via computer Thursday in a case that raised questions about how to
apply federal obscenity law to the information superhighway.
   Robert and Carleen Thomas, both 38, of Milpitas, Calif., were each
convicted of 11 counts of transmitting obscenity through interstate phone
lines via their members-only computer bulletin board. Each count carries up to
five years in prison and $250,000 fine."

Apparently the Thomases sold pornographic graphics files on their BBS.  A
Memphis postal inspector deliberately joined the BBS under an assumed name,
downloaded some of the pics to his system and then complained to law
enforcement authorities.

There's discussion of just what it means to try someone on the Internet under
local pornography laws which refer to "community standards."  "The opinion was
designed to let local citizens say whether they want X-rated bookstores or
movie theaters in their communities and get judges out of the business of
deciding what is obscene, said Stephen Bates, a senior fellow with the
Annenberg Washington Program, a communications think tank."

However, if this approach is applied to the Internet, "federal juries in the
most conservative parts of the country could decide what sexually explicit
images and words get on the information superhighway, Bates said."

Weise's article covers reactions on the Internet:
   
   "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Hours after a couple were convicted of sending images
of bestiality and sexual fetishes over a computer bulletin board, the Internet
was humming with warnings and protests. 
   "`If this case stands, you can bet there will be a hell of a lot more
prosecutions on the same basis in extremely short order," Karl Denninger of
Chicago wrote Friday on the computer network.'"

The EFF's Mike Godwin is reported as saying, "This case ... has one community
attempting to dictate standards for the whole country."

At least one BBS operator has stated that he'll quit as a result of the ruling,
although he didn't explain what kind of files his BBS stocks....

Assume, that we need a 'balance' in the RISK Digest, the balance between
"benefits" of certain techniques against their "risks"

I have to react, as we are in a limbo on this issue.  As a Dutchman, living in
Belgium, I follow the outcome of a weekly T.V. program, called "Opsporing
verzocht" (Help sought on Criminal Investigation), a program in which the
Police Forces try to get necessary input for solving serious crimes.  In that
program, the presence of video-material from shopping malls and within shops
has proven to be a big help in getting required input, and so we have to
accept that we are "video-ed" when we are, for example, shopping; also for our
"own" protection.

- Would not you feel better, with a camera 'at your shoulder', 
  as e.g. a cashier in a petrol station at a highway ?

So: Benefits appear to outweigh risk !

Note: Apparently the Dutch Police Forces, and related Forces, 
      are still considered -- in general -- to be the "friends" of 
      the population by the Dutch population.
      I thought that the same attitude towards the Police Forces 
      was true for the U.K.; the relation to the "Bobbie".
      (As the original "risks message" originated in the U.K., 
      I also refer to the "Bobbie")

          I wish, this would be the case in other countries as 
          well; but the requirements for reaching such a 
          relation with the 'public' are:

         - to be "of assistance to the public"
         - to be trustworthy, accompanied by a free press 
           and political will
         - to be supported by the judicial apparatus, for 
           the Forces to stay motivated
         - a "quality of life" worth defending it

      We will need a lot of "trustworthy" energy to protect us -- 
      and our children -- against the "criminal" energy.

Do NOT get me wrong:
- I also fell victim to injustice (in my opinion) in a case 
  versus an 'official'
- I even have been insulted in writing by a member of the Council 
  of Ministers

But, we have to trust (and at the same time: control) the forces which
should protect the "law-abiding" (or = sullen ?) citizen, and are paid by
that same citizen to do so !  Might the price of "democracy".

The July issue of Byte has a good technical review of systems for integrating
PC's and telephones.  The full reference is:

  Jon Udell, Computer telephony, Byte 19(7), 1994, pages 80-96.

The applications are still pretty primitive, since the necessary capabilities
within the phone system itself don't quite exist yet, are just coming on-line,
or are just receiving regulatory approval.  Still, enough stuff is just over
the horizon that non-trivial architectures are being built.  Many of them 
use Caller-ID, for which the FCC just set US national standards over the dead
bodies of several state utilities commissions; and despite the strange idea
that Caller-ID is mostly for residential use, the article makes clear that
developers see a world of commercial applications.  In general, as the article
points out in the case of sales and collections systems,

  "As these tools find their way into the hands of smaller, more mainstream
   businesses, you can expect better service in some cases and more efficient
   harassment in others."

Indeed.

&gt; [...] Setuid has hurt instead of helped. [...]  While it is
&gt; appropriate for my program to fail by returning ME to the operating
&gt; system, my program should not fail by returning YOU to the operating
&gt; system prompt with privileges that are different from those that you
&gt; have on your own.

Mr. Murray's article on the behaviour of various historical systems is
interesting, but makes a rather bizarre claim about the behaviour of setuid
under Unix.  In fact, a setuid program only has privileges in the process in
which it is running and any child processes that it creates without first
disabling the setuid privilege.

The problems we've seen on the Internet with setuid programs generally are the
result of poor coding which leaves loopholes in the executing setuid program
that a clever cracker can exploit.  I don't see any reason to believe that
OS/400 setuid-like programs are any safer from this sort of exploitation.  The
proper solution to this problem is probably either to program more carefully,
or to set up an environment in which it's harder to make mistakes like this.

From his description, Mr. Murray appears to think that setuid was introduced
in order to restrict access rights, and has been abused by lazy programmers.
Quite the contrary. The purpose of the `setuid' bit is to allow a program to
run with the permissions afforded to the program's owner, rather than those of
the user. To say that `setuid has hurt rather than helped' is like saying
`electricity has hurt rather than helped'. Setuid is *fundamental* to how Unix
operates and its invention by Dennis Ritchie has been described as the only
genuinely original idea in the Unix design (which is not to say it doesn't
have problems).

  William&gt; ...  However, they do not permit the user to retain
  William&gt; those privileges across the failure of the application.

Neither does Unix. If my setuid program fails, I fall back to whatever
invoked it, usually a Shell. I do *not* retain setuid privileges.

I highly recommend a book entitled The Cult of Information: a Neo-Luddite
Treatise on High-Tech, Artificial intelligence, and the True Art of Thinking,
by Theodore Roszak (second edition, c1994).  Roszak, in this book, is not
attacking the idea of computerization, but he is warning our society against
equating information with knowledge (the idea that if one can access
information one, therefore, has knowledge on that given subject) and against
over-computerization of our society. I found it to be a very readable book and
quite illuminating.

**NEW INFO. SECURITY BOOK ON PUBLIC KEY LAW &amp; POLICY**
 
TITLE:   FEDERAL CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY LIABILITY AND POLICY --
 Law and Policy of Certificate-Based Public Key and Digital Signatures

AUTHOR:   MICHAEL S. BAUM, J.D., M.B.A.
	  Independent Monitoring

Report No. NIST-GCR-94-654
450+ pages, highly annotated; multiple appendices; indexed.
 
   U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
   National Institute of Standards and Technology

Produced in support of the Federal Government's public key infrastructure
study, this book identifies diverse technical, legal and policy issues
affecting a certificate-based public key cryptographic infrastructure
utilizing digital signatures supported by "trusted entities." It examines
potential legal implications, surveys existing legal paradigms and the
structures and roles of relevant governmental agencies and presents various
institutional approaches to controlling liability. It considers the
underpinnings of a legal and policy framework which might serve as a
foundation for security policies and their implementation and concludes with
a series of recommendations, both general and specific concerning
certificate-based public key. Both public and private sector issues are
addressed.
 
This publication is the result of legal, business and security management
research, as well as interviews and analysis predominantly with public- and
private-sector lawyers, policy makers, managers and management information
system and security professionals in the United States and abroad.

The Dante II robot (successor to Dante I, whose fiber cable snapped only 21
feet down into Mt Erebus in 1993) has been exporing the volcanic crater of Mt
Spurr in Alaska, apparently with great success in gathering information in a
human-risky environment after the 1992 eruption.  En route to the bottom,
Dante II survived being hit by rocks and slopping through mud and snow; prior
to its descent its satellite dish antenna was chewed on by a bear.  However,
the last few days have provided grist for the RISKS mill as to what can go
wrong going wrong.  Last Wednesday (3 Aug 1994) the robot lost power, and then
its transmitter went dead.  On Thursday, a short-circuit (due to condensation)
was fixed in a connector to the 1000-volt power and communications cable.  The
robot then was able to begin its ascent (at three feet per minute).  On Friday
night, the 1700-pound Dante II lost its footing when one of its eight legs
malfunctioned, and it toppled over.  Plans are now afoot (no pun intended) to
hoist it out by helicopter, or if that fails for a geologist (John Laskeivitch
of the Alaska Volcano Observatory) to climb down and attach a tether -- using
the knowledge obtained from Dante II that there are lots of rocks but that the
expected hot gases are no longer present.  The robotic software seems to have
functioned well throughout.  [SOURCES: PGN News Service from articles by
Charles Petit in the San Francisco Chronicle, 4-5 Aug 1994, and AP items, 7

It looks as if the folks in Denver have figured out what they need to do to
finally get their new airport open.  As you may recall, it has failed to open
for quite sometime because the amazing, computer-controlled, $200 million
baggage handling system simply doesn't work.  Nor does it appear that there is
much hope of making it work quickly.  The more deeply the system is inspected,
the more problems are found.

Videos of the failing system under test are great fun to watch.  Bags being
flung at carts that aren't where they're supposed to be, carts flying off
tracks, bags flying through the air smashing into the ground, and so on.
Quite a show.

So how to open the airport?  Simple!  They've apparently decided to spend more
bucks and build *another* baggage handling system--the conventional kind with
conveyer belts.  After they build this new, old-style system, they'll finally
be able to open the airport, which is currently losing something like $1
million/day just sitting there.

The plan is to shift back to the computerized system when (if?) they get all
the bugs out of it.

Squirrels aren't Nasdaq's only problem. According to an article in New York
Times, there are also some race conditions in their procedures.

The article describes attempts to stop trading in Newbridge Networks stock.
Apparently the attempt to stop trading was entered at 9:32 instead of 9:30 due
to an error entering a command. Many options (more highly leveraged than
shares) got through and were confirmed. They were retroactively cancelled.

There are two basic problems. One, as the article noted, is that a 
confirmation is not a confirmation. The other is the contrast between human 
speeds and computer speeds. Two minutes is a very very long time.

Regarding the electrician who blew out some equipment by dropping the neutral
from a circuit, causing a power leg to go to around 220V (about double the
North American standard of ~117V).  One might suggest that (even though it can
be inconvenient) turning *off* the power to areas that could be directly
affected by ongoing electrical work would be a simple and mandated procedure.
No fancy protective gear is needed in this case.  Just turn off the breakers
until the work is done.

I am writing an article on Rapid Application Development (RAD) and would like
to include a risky horror story or two, if anyone has one they want to share.
If you can BRIEFLY describe a project where RAD techniques were used to
develop a system or software which resulted in quantifiable losses (in terms
of time, money, etc.) to an individual or organization, I will consider
quoting you (with proper citation of course). The anecdote must be traceable
to an organization or individual involved (there can be some anonymity, but
some person or group must be identifiable so the story can be verified).

Please send replies DIRECTLY to <A HREF="mailto:mercuri@gradient.cis.upenn.edu">mercuri@gradient.cis.upenn.edu</A>

Sorry, I don't have time to address other matters (like "what is RAD?" -- if
you don't know then you probably weren't using it).

BTW, I'm especially interested in projects where an outside consulting team
came in, used RAD, developed something and left it either unfinished,
undocumented, untested, and/or unsupportable. Hope someone wants to go on
the record with their experience(s).

Thanks in advance, Rebecca Mercuri

causing her to go overdrawn.

After writing letters and waiting for weeks, she got a letter from Barclays
explaining that the loss was ``a quirk in our accounts processing system which
is effectively debiting twice the amount of a customer's unpaid in cheque''.
It goes on: ``Your helpful comments are valuable to us in prioritising the
resolution of difficulties such as those experienced by you''.

I suspect that many firms only fix software bugs when enough 
customers have complained about them. But how many make a virtue 
out of it?

   for seven deaths on the test-flight takeoff of an Airbus A330.  PGN]

My comment is that in the absence of an obvious single fault in the hardware
(which in this case mostly is software) the default explanation is "human
error". It looks rather as if the combination of automation, ill-defined
tasks, and an unsupportive organisation were the real causes. But I would not
expect Airbus to ever acknowledge that.

PDCS2 2nd Open Workshop         Safety-Critical Systems Club
(Predictably Dependable
Computing Systems 2)    &amp;       14th Meeting and Seminar on
                                New Technologies
Newcastle upon Tyne             Leeds
19-21 September 1994            22-23 September 1994

Introduction

The issues addressed by the PDCS2 research project and SCSC members are
closely related.  It is because of this, and the geographic proximity of
the locations, that we hope to facilitate attendance, by interested
parties, to both events.


PDCS2 2nd Open Workshop

The 2nd Predictably Dependable Computing Systems (PDCS2) Open Workshop will
be held on 19-21 September, at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne,
starting at 2.00 p.m. (with registration and lunch from 12.30 p.m.).

The PDCS2 Workshop will comprise technical presentations of the year's
work.  There will also be demonstrations of prototype software and systems
developed by the project. Further details are provided in the preliminary
programme shown below.

PDCS2 builds on, and takes significantly further, the work of ESPRIT Basic
Research Action PDCS on the problems of making the process of designing and
constructing adequately dependable computing systems much more predictable
and cost-effective than at present.  In particular, it addresses the
problems of producing dependable distributed real-time systems and
especially those where the dependability requirements centre on issues of
safety and/or security.  The research programme is concentrated on a number
of carefully selected topics in fault prevention, fault tolerance, fault
removal and fault forecasting.  It ranges in nature from theoretical to
experimental and in a number of cases the acquisition or implementation, in
prototype form, of software tools, and their experimental interconnection.

SCSC 14th Meeting and Seminar on New Technologies

The 14th meeting of the Safety-critical Systems Club will be held on 22-23
September at The Marriott Hotel in Leeds, starting at 10.00 a.m. with
registration and coffee from 9.30 a.m.  On Thursday 22 September the theme
will be "New Technologies for Safety-critical Systems" and the programme
will address the application of technologies such as formal methods, neural
networks, knowledge based systems, and robotics to the safety critical
domain, enquiring into their readiness for this role, and examining actual
experience.  On Friday 23 September the event will focus on "Introducing
Formal Techniques" and will provide an overview presentation on how to
manage the introduction of formality, together with talks describing real
case histories.

The Safety-critical Systems Club was formed in 1991 with support from the
DTI and SERC.  It provides a regular forum for presentations and
interaction on a wide range of topics concerning the use of computing
systems in safety-critical applications.  The majority of participants are
practitioners and users of such systems, but developers and research
workers are also represented in the membership of almost 2,000.  Each year
the club holds a series of meetings and seminars, circulates a regular
newsletter and organises a three day conference on the theme of
safety-critical systems.

                    announces its forty-second meeting,
               to be held at Brighton on 12th October 1994,
                               a seminar on
                         =========================
                        ||  Process Improvement  ||
                         =========================

Learn from the practitioners

The morning session will be devoted to talks by leading experts in the
increasingly important field of software process improvement, dealing
with significant practical issues:

   *  How to measure software process improvement
   *  Identifying opportunities for process improvement
   *  Defining and describing processes
   *  Reasoning about process effectiveness
   *  Achieving and quantitatively demonstrating improvement

Explore the key issues

After meeting with their peers over lunch, groups of delegates will work
together, sharing their collective experience, and discussing some of
the topical issues in the field of process improvement:

   *  Bottom-up or top-down?
   *  How to get started
   *  Which comes first - the process or measurement?

Delegates are encouraged to suggest other topics for discussion in this
part of the meeting; to do so, fill in the relevant part of the tear-off
slip on the next page.  The working session will be followed by reports
back to the main meeting, and an open discussion of the issues raised.

Discover the future

Following informal discussion over tea, the final session of the day
will be led by one of the key players in determining the future
development of this important field.  This perspective will be important
for all who are planning to be, or are already, involved in the software
process improvement area.

Who should attend

This meeting is aimed at anyone with a professional interest in
improving software development processes, including:

   *  software engineers, project managers and quality personnel wishing
      to learn about the practice of process improvement
   *  experienced process improvers who wish to broaden their knowledge
      and keep in touch with the latest developments
   *  researchers wishing to learn from the practical application of
      process improvement ideas.

Why you should attend

The benefits of attendance at this meeting include:

   *  exposure to the practical experience of other professionals who
      have successfully applied software process improvement within
      their companies and for the benefit of their clients
   *  opportunities to share your experiences and problems with other
      professionals, both during the formal sessions and informally
      during the breaks
   *  updating on the practice of the leaders in the process improvement
      field, and on likely short term future developments which will
      have implications for the whole industry.

On 9 Aug 1994, an attempt was made to rescue Dante II (see <A HREF="/Risks/16.31.html">RISKS-16.31</A>) from
the Mt. Spurr crater.  A helicopter tried to lift Dante II by its half-inch
Kevlar-reinforced tether, but the tether snapped from the force of the
attempted liftoff.  The tether had survived earlier tests that demonstrated it
had sufficient strength to lift the 1700-pound robot; however, the tether may
have been wrapped around one of the VW-sized boulders as a result of Dante's
earlier movements.  (Tim Hegadorn, a CMU grad student, was injured in the
process.)

And, finally, on 12 Aug 1994, David Bares (civil engineer, and leader of the
CMU robot development effort) and an Army ``pathfinder'' climbed into the Mt.

This is from *New Scientist*, 2 Jul 1994.

'Tis just 40 years since North American TV stations started broadcasting in
colour, using the NTSC system. Officially NTSC was named after the National
Television System Committee which chose it. Unofficially NTSC has often been
called Never Thrice the Same Colour.

A journalist who used to cover the NTSC told us recently of a lighter moment
at the laboratories of the record company RCA in Princeton, New Jersey, where
the system was developed. Team leader George Brown laid on a final
transmission test. A colour camera was focused on a bowl of colourful fruit in
one lab, and the received signal was displayed in another lab on a prototype
colour tube. Just before the test Brown took a banana from the bowl and
painted it blue.

For the rest of the day the engineers at the receiving end struggled
desperately to find out how their new system was faithfully reproducing the
colour of red apples, orange oranges and green grapes, but resolutely
converting yellow into blue.

  Saul Hansell, New breed of check forgers exploits desktop publishing, 
  *The New York Times*, 15 August 1994, pages A1, C3.

This article reports that it's easy to manufacture fake checks with widely
available desktop publishing software.  You need an original check, which you
can get from the trash, from a paid insider (usually a low-level employee), or
by standing outside check-cashing shops and paying people to let you photocopy
their payroll checks.  Then you need a scanner, and software to manipulate 
the image.  Then you need check paper and a check printer (both of which are
readily obtained).  Finally, you need someone to pass the check -- someone
who'll take a cut to risk getting arrested.

The forgers and the banks are engaged in a technological arms race.  Tellers
can run checks through scanners to make sure they've got the right kind of
magnetic ink on them, but then magnetic-ink printers are widely available.
Image manipulation programs allow for "authenticating" stamps and signatures
to be forged as well.  When forged checks are discovered, some banks fax 
the pertinent information to every other bank branch in the same region of 
the country, figuring that the forgers have made several copies of the check
and are driving around cashing them as fast as they can before the alarm is
sounded.  And so on.

This story illustrates one of the many subterranean interactions between
computer technology and social institutions -- the tendency of applied
computing to change physical objects into hybrid things that have one foot
planted in cyberspace.  We've always relied on the relative immutability of
physical objects to do various kinds of work for us.  Computers make it easier
to synthesize many kinds of objects, including mutated copies of originals.
The obvious solution -- at least, the solution that's obvious within the
conventions of computer design -- is to give every check a digital "shadow".
For example, when an employer issues a payroll check, the check number and
amount might be registered digitally and made available on a server.  When 
a check is presented for payment, the teller feeds the check into a scanner 
that recovers the check number and payment amount from the magnetic ink and
then, rather like credit cards now, consults that server to see if the check
has been presented yet.

This is only one of the many social mechanisms through which people, places,
and things acquire digital shadows.  Each mechanism has a seemingly inexorable
logic through which the shadows cast by human artifacts and activities grow
more expansive and more detailed.  This process might be planned out in
advance or it might proceed through a reaction to unanticipated holes in the
system.  When the trends that precipitate further growth in the shadow system
are bad, or at least stigmatized, little attention is paid to alternatives
that might minimize the amount of personal information that is being gathered
while still providing genuine benefits and helping to prevent genuine ills.

What's your shadow like?

From the "New England News In Brief" section of the August 10, 1994 edition of
*The Boston Globe*, here's a description of a situation in which a
technological innovation had a positive but unanticipated side-effect:

		   Suspects dial ahead, are caught

Naugatuck, Conn. - Telephone technology has helped nab two burglary suspects
who had allegedly called ahead to see if anyone was home.  Police said one of
the suspects called Sunday and left a message on an answering machine asking
if anyone was there.  The burglars rewound the answering machine when they
arrived at the home, but did not notice that their number was recorded on a
Caller ID device.  Police traced the call to the apartment of Gregory Alves,
23, and his roommate, Gary Ingham, 19. (AP)

Given a class of data that it is unlawful to possess (e.g. child pornography
in the US, government secrets almost anywhere), escrowed encryption keys can
be forced out of escrow by simultaneously transmitting such data to a site
(e.g. via e-mail or anonymous FTP), and asserting to the appropriate
authorities that there is probable cause to believe that such data is present
at the site.

Even if evidence obtained in this way cannot be used in court, it still puts
the victim through the (perhaps considerable) expense of replacing the
compromised key (which may be embedded in hardware) and of tracking down
anything else that may have been affected, as well as opening the door to a
generalized fishing expedition that may well turn up something that *can* be
used.

A user at the site can easily be tricked into requesting the data, for example
by means of a URL that simultaneously transmits the data to the user, and
notifies the appropriate authorities.  This attack can easily be used against
a selected set of users, e.g. those on a mailing list or subscribers to a
Usenet news group.

I came upon this excellent warning about the dangers of six-digit dates
(with the year represented by two decimal digits) recently on USENET and
have reproduced it here for the readers of RISKS digest with permission:

&gt;NNTP-Posting-Host: access3.digex.net

Please excuse the long delay between the prior posting and this one, I
have been busy with a number of very critical issues.

I've been trying to think of a way to solve the problem.  I - and
probably many of you - have been trying to figure out what to do about it.

At the end of "The Andromeda Strain" the Senator asks Dr. Stone what they
can do if another biological emergency occurs.  "What do we do then?" he
asks.  "Exactly, " responds Dr. Stone, "What do we do?"

The problem is the issue of six-digit dates and the turn of the century,
now less than six years away.

The problem is probably not as bad as it was, because with the introduction of
IBM PCs which support dates past the year 2100, the issue isn't a problem
except to the extent of programs that still use six-digit dates.

Some of you might not understand why this is a serious issue.  I'll explain.

Much software which is still in use - especially on mainframes - was written
ten, fifteen, even twenty years ago for use in the solving of current problems
at that time.

Some of that software survives, even twenty years later.  As I once pointed
out in a posting on the newsgroup alt.cobol, a large company might have a
massive 2,000,000 line cobol program with 500 modules that requires 50
programmers for its constant maintenance, care and feeding, and that over the
years the company has probably spent in excess of fifteen million dollars.

These applications are the "bet the company" applications that are
used every day to keep it in business.  They are the "crown jewels" that
if anything goes wrong with the application, the company might actually go
into Chapter 11 or suffer massive customer backlash.

These applications cannot be rewritten because it would be too expensive,
and the company can't afford to be without them.  Thus, unless something
happens to encourage the company to change its systems, they will continue
running these old, maintenance-heavy applications.

In some cases, the program is so huge and so complicated nobody knows
everything it does; it is beyond the capacity of any one person to know
every function and interface and module.

Therefore it can't be said with certainty what the different sections are
doing with each other.  Thus finding where things are happening can be
frustratingly difficult.

Which comes to the issue at hand.  Many of these programs were written to
use dates which are six digits in length.  Three days from now it will be
August 14, 1994.  You can write that as 08/14/94 or 14/8/94 depending on
which way your system codes dates.

Figuring out the difference between 8/14/94 and 8/15/94 is no problem, and
figuring out that 8/13/95 is after 8/14/94 is also no problem.

The last date of this century is Friday, December 31, 1999.  12-31-99.
Want to tell me what the next date after that is?  Saturday, January 1, 2000.
01-01-00.

Which date is earlier, 01/01/99 or 01/03/00?  What is the difference
between 12/15/99 and 12/31/99?  About two weeks.  What is the difference
between 12/15/99 and 01/03/00? About 99 years.

Hypothetical Example #1. I use my Visa Card to charge $15.00 on December
15, 1999, and the bill is calculated on Monday, January 3, 2000.

99 years of 21% compounded interest on $15 can be over a billion dollars.
Depending on where the minus sign is, either the company is going to
think I haven't paid them for 99 years, and freeze my account, send me a
bill for $1 billion in interest, or roll over into positive numbers, and
tell me my account has $1 billion in available credit.

Or it simply dumps every account with outstanding balances for manual
handling as the numbers are outrageous, which effectively stops automatic
billing.  Or the system simply crashes.

Scenario #2.  A major petrochemical processing plant has a system that
cooks a batch of chemicals for a certain period of time, before pushing
that load out to the next process.  The plant runs continuously, and
batches are cooked according to time.

A plant computer shoves a load in to cook for one hour beginning at 11:45
pm on December 31, 1999.  At Midnight, one of these things happens:
(1) the system notices that the batch has been in the oven too long, and
pushes a batch of molten chemicals into the next process, where the
process of spraying them causes an explosion.
(2) the clock counter overflows and shuts down the whole system.
(3) the system counter overflows and the batch isn't released, so it
overcooks in the oven and perhaps explodes under high heat.
(4) the batch stays in the oven while a new batch is shoved in,
overloading the oven and causing an explosion.
(5) any of these explosions carries back through the utilities and
supplies, causing gas line explosions or power surges, as a plant that is
eating perhaps 2 megawatts of power suddenly drops off the grid, causing
an instant overflow and shutting down power for several areas.

Scenario #3.  Several power plants go into maintenance shutdown because
they've been running continuously for 98 years and 7 months longer than
the maximum 90 day operating maximum.  Some Nuclear Power plant goes
critical or shuts down because the system believes that the rods have
been installed too long.

So having looked at this issue, what can we do about it?

I got thinking about this.  In some systems, there's little or no room to
expand their data files and the ability to remove running applications is
impossible.  Therefore any method that changes the system must allow
their applications to continue running.

And I thought of a method.

By coding the date into a character field, effectively in base 32, it
would be possible to encode a larger date and still only use 6 characters.
By encoding the year to use the letters of the alphabet, e.g. AA through
ZZ plus A0 through Z0, it is possible to cover more than 900 years, e.g.
start counting with 1400 through 2300, thus covering any date that could
have occurred during civilization.

In fact, if one wants to encode the month and day - Month encoded to add
A,B and C and day encoded as 0-9 and A-U, it is possible to use 4 digits
for the year and still fit everything into 6 bytes.  Or use both and fit
everything into 4 bytes.

This would also then work for places using packed decimal for the
six-digit year and thus only allowing 4 bytes.

One of the things that is necessary is to make programs expecting numbers
fail so that they can be changed.  Programs that read these records will
have to expect both old and new format records, while programs that write
them should only output the new format.

The point is that with many sites having hundreds or even thousands of
programs, the effort could be equivalent to three full-time people over a
three year period at some sites.  (Some companies have thousands or tens of
thousands of programs in their libraries.)  This is extra and additional
maintenance on top of current maintenance.  Expensive overhead that will
get worse in the future as it needs to be more urgently done.

What is needed are automated searching and checking facilities to find
programs that manipulate dates and change those programs to handle a new
date format.

If we do not make the changes, we could be looking at failed programs,
massive errors, disasters and setbacks that could produce serious,
perhaps even fatal problems.  It can't be done in a hurry in the last 6
months of 1999.

Let us not forget the amount of time needed to do updates, which could be
days or weeks, depending on how good the automated tools are and how many
applications they have.

What do we need to do?

(1).  If your site has in-house applications, and lots of source files,
      you need to push for the acquisition of automated checking tools.
(2).  You need to push for the manpower and resources necessary to do the
      work now rather than later, because "later" won't be budgeted for.
(3).  You need to push for the updating of databases to allow full
      8-digit dates.
(4).  Push for all reports to eliminate use of 6-digit dates, even in
      display fields.
(5).  Find out what your vendor is doing if you use canned applications.

If we work on the problem now while there is time, we can do this with
less error and better control, then trying to rush fixes in November of
1999 when errors could spell disaster.

If you have better ideas on how to solve the six-digit problem, please
write back.

A friend told me I should mention this bug here, so here goes....

In some ircII (Internet Relay Chat) clients (v2.2.9, I believe but possibly
other versions as well), there is a bug called the GROK or JUKE bug which
allows other people to take over your client.  Irc clients have functions
built in by default that allow access to an account, most notably the ability
to run shell commands and such, and as long as the only person accessing the
client is the one whose account it is, these commands have their uses.  When
someone with malicious intent gets control of a client, they can cause major
troubles such as deleting the entire account or compromising system security.

This bug seems to have been in copies of the code that was available last
spring.  Personally, I got a client compiled through the auto-compiler at
sci.dixie.edu sometime last April or early May, I believe, and that client had
the bug.  I believe that since then however, they have fixed their code as
have the people at cs.bu.edu and the bug no longer appears.  

To determine if the bug is present in your client, login to irc and then type:

/ctcp &lt;nickname of person running client you want to check&gt; clientinfo

This will return a string of words.  If the words "GROK" or "JUKE" appear in
the list anywhere, then that client has the bug in it.  I do not know how the
bug itself works, because the way I found out about it was by having someone
pointing out I had it and then doing a few non-malicious demonstrations (I
checked my account thoroughly afterwards, and found no evidence of tampering),
but the demonstrations I saw lead me to believe that the entire range of
client commands available to someone using a client legitimately are available
to someone who takes over a client through the bug.  I only saw a couple of
commands demonstrated but to anyone with a little knowledge of the more
advanced irc features, many more possibilities are available than just making
the user logout of irc, or echoing to their client. 

Apologies if this has already come up here, I searched the archives and didn't
find anything about it, but I am not a normal reader of this group and as I
said, I am posting this at the advice of a friend. Please send any followups
to me personally as well as to the list....

There's a bug in Microsoft Word 6.0 and 6.0a: what you see is not what you
get.  I saw this in _Windows Magazine_, May 1994 (Fred Langa's column
"Win.INI", pages 11 and 14).  I checked the problem with a copy of Word 6.0a,
and confirmed it exists.  I'm surprised I haven't seen it in RISKS, and
checked the archive, but could find no mention of it in volumes 15 or 16.

THE BUG: 

Word has a summary info area, for each document, that cannot be turned off.
If you do not enter information in the summary (which is the default setting)
then Word will lift sentences out of the beginning of your document and place
them in the summary, without telling you.  Even if you then change the summary
info, the lifted sentences may still remain hidden in the document, visible to
any text editor (but not visible in Word).

If all you use is printed copies, you're okay.  However, if you give somebody
the file on disk or send it by email, then there may be unintended information
in the file -- not great for people working with sensitive, competition
sensitive, or classified information.

According to the _Windows Magazine_ article, Microsoft denies this is a
problem.  For the time being, you can:

1. Turn on the "Prompt for Summary Info" in the Tools/Options/Save menu (this
requires you to enter summary information, or accept what you've already
entered, each time you save the document.  This way Word will not lift
sentences out of the text.)
-or-
2. Block copy all your text to another document before transferring the file.
-and-
3. Notify Microsoft if you believe this is a problem, to encourage them 
to fix it.

The RISKS? well ...
1. You start to write a flame-o-gram, but later tone it down.  Those
first sentences may still be buried in the document.

2. You're involved with sensitive information (competition sensitive, source
selection sensitive), or classified information.  You don't see anything
sensitive or classified so the document goes out.  But those first sentences
may still be there.

3. A software company sets their product to do something without telling you,
particularly something that uses information from you, in ways unintended by
you, without your knowledge or permission.

   [NOTE: PGN introduced an error in the original copy of this,
   1992 instead of 1993.  That is corrected here.  PGN]

The accident report is now in on the February 1993 off-course Continental
Airlines Boeing 747 with 233 people aboard that flew within 500 feet of the
Gatwick passenger terminal during a landing attempt at Gatwick Airport.
Apparently computer failure prevented the automatic pilot from locking on to
the radio beams that would have guided the plane to the runway.  A manual
landing followed.  The crew had expressed doubts as to the accuracy of the
instruments.  [Source: A Close Call for U.S. Jet at Gatwick, excerpted by PGN
from The International Herald Tribune, 24 Aug 1994, p.2]

It sounds as though there was a failure to capture the localiser.  But that
happens. And how on earth were they following it if they hadn't captured it?
I'd also guess there was some discrepancy amongst the instruments that they
were busy trying to troubleshoot. Maybe one of the UK people can grab the
report?  Peter Ladkin

There has been a bit of news in the business sections about the new NSA
contract given to Cray to develop a hybrid machine that combined the 
best of the old Cray vector approach with the best of the old Thinking
Machine CM-1/CM-2 architecture. It is somewhat ironic that this was
released in the same time frame that Thinking Machines went into Chapter
11, but it may turn out that this marriage really brings out the best
in both approaches. Some of the news stories concentrated on the 
quasi-Chrysler-like bailout of an important technological treasure,
but that is a question for political scientists who cleave to moldy debates
about the relationship between private enterprise and the state. 

The biggest question for citizens of the techno-tribe of cyberspace, though,
is what does this mean for digital privacy. Will the NSA be able to crack
passwords with abandon? Will they be able to cut through the protection of
DES like it was butter? Any speculation is, of course, pure speculation.
But it is possible to make some educated guesses about the machine. 

News reports and other research states that this machine will include 512,000
processors that contain 256 bits of memory apiece. Each processor contains 
an ALU and three one bit registers. It really isn't a processor as much as
a programmable logic gate that will take three inputs and spit out one of
the 8 possible outputs. The architecture is supposed to borrow heavily from
a neat machine called the Processor-In-Memory (PIM aka TeraSys) developed
by the Supercomputer Research Center, a semi-public branch of the NSA.

I happened to play with a very similar architecture several years ago
developed by a company called Coherent Research Inc in Syracuse, NY. It turns
out that it does a pretty good job of breaking DES.  One hypothetical machine
with 1 billion processors should be able to test all 2^(55) possible keys for
DES in 1 day.

How long should it take the Cray/SRC? The Cray/SRC processors are supposed to
run at 2.08 ns/cycle. The Coherent Chips ran at 50MHz or 20 ns/cycle.  This
means the Cray/SRC is about 10 times faster. This is a very rough estimate,
though, because it is not clear how many cycles it takes the Cray to complete
each operation. The Coherent Processor took 2-4 cycles per operation. This
would imply that the Cray/SRC could knock off all 2^{55} possible keys in 100
days.

Given that DES may still be used extensively in financial transactions that
move billions of dollars, it becomes clear that it might be worth it to
spend $10 or so million on a machine and let it crank for a bit. (That's my
wild estimate on the price. I think it could be as low as $2-3 million). 

But even if most of us don't have $100 million to steal, we still have
reason to wonder about the effects of this machine. UNIX security systems
use DES to encrypt the passwords 25 times before comparing them to a
encrypted version stored in the central password file. A popular attack on
the systems is to grab this central file and encrypt all of the words in
the dictionary looking for a match. This is easy to do with a garden
variety RISC machine today which is why many decent system administrators
require gibberish passwords with numbers. 

How long would it take to attack gibberish passwords with this new
Cray/SRC? I extrapolated some earlier work of David Feldmeirer and Phil
Karn to show that a 64k processor version could knock off all 6 character
passwords in about half of a day. (6 characters drawn from the set
A-Z,a-z,0-9) If the 512k processor Cray/SRC can really run 10 times faster,
then it could knock off these 6 character passwords in less that 15
minutes. All seven character UNIX-style passwords would take less than 2
days and all eight could searched in less than four months. 

There is one interesting side-effect of this approach. It takes about the
same amount of time to attack 1000 passwords as it does to attack 1. After
the 512k processors complete their encryption, they check to see if they've
got a match. The encryption process was about 10,000 times slower than the
matching on my design. So if you could grab a password file for a computer
with 1000 users it would still take you about 15 minutes to find the one
sucker with a 6 digit password. 

This means that even the maximum-sized 8-character UNIX-style passwords are
really on the edge of obsolesence. It is really time for a new system to be
developed.  16 characters might be best. But who can remember that many?  Sure
some know millions of digits of pi, but a bunch of politicians tried to
shorten it to plain 3.  This means we need to rethink many of the modes of
protecting machines.

   [I presume that when Peter wrote "a plain 3" he was implying just 3
   digits, as opposed to the old mathematical physicists' joke about pi 
   being equal to 3 for small values of pi and large values of 3.  PGN]

All of what I've written falls into the realm of informed speculation. You
can read about my design in a paper which was presented at Crypto 92. Mail
me if you want a TeX version of it. I suggest that you dig up conference
proceedings about the PIM/Terasys machine to get a better estimate of the
new Cray/SRC's machine's performance.

&gt;From the Associated Press newswire (94.08.16 @ 00:00 EDST) via CompuServe's
Executive News Service (GO ENS):

"Home Security", By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer 

The author describes the current problems caused by home security systems.
Key points:

o	Burglars can easily disable some home security system control panels.

o	Estimates of false alarms from these systems range from 70% to 90% and
even higher.

o	`"The false alarms are astronomical," says Sgt. Steve Emmons,
spokesman for the Tulsa, Okla., Police Department. "It ties up two officers
every time we get one, and 98 percent of our alarms are false. It is causing
our call load to grow to an extreme level."'

o	Dallas police field 140,000 alarms/year, "most of them false."

o	Los Angeles charges $80 per false alarm after the first four free false
alarms per location.

o	Miami tolerates five false alarms but then charge increasing fines.

o	Portland, OR. impose escalating fines and provide training.

o	"Security specialists advise buying a more sophisticated system that
can provide protection for windows, motion detectors and a control system not
easily disabled. Sirens are useful to shorten the burglars' stay."

   [NOTE: PGN removed PZ's PGP signing, for brevity.  Besides, I 
   corrected a few typos, which would blow the integrity check.  PGN]

I'd like to clear up some widely held misconceptions about PGP version 2.6
from MIT.  I get a lot of email and phone calls from people who report a lot
of misinformation on many Internet newsgroups about this MIT version of PGP.

(For those of you who need an introduction to Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), it is
a free software package that encrypts email.  PGP is the worldwide defacto
standard for email encryption.  It's available via FTP from net-dist.mit.edu,
in the pub/PGP directory.  But then, if you haven't heard of PGP, you don't
need to read this letter.)

Here is a list of misconceptions:

Myth #1:  PGP 2.6 is incompatible with previous versions.
Myth #2:  PGP 2.6 is weaker than previous versions, with a back door.
Myth #3:  PGP 2.6 was released without Zimmermann's cooperation.

All of these misconceptions would be cleared up if you read the PGP
User's Guide that comes with PGP 2.6, but a lot of people seem to be
spreading and believing these myths without looking into the matter
empirically and getting the new PGP and reading the manual.  Let's go
over these myths in detail.

- ---------------------------------------------------------
Myth #1:  PGP 2.6 is incompatible with previous versions.
- ---------------------------------------------------------

This is untrue.  PGP 2.6 will ALWAYS be able to read stuff from earlier
versions.

PGP version 2.6 can read anything produced by versions 2.3, 2.3a, 2.4, or 2.5.
However, because of a negotiated agreement between MIT and RSA Data Security,
PGP 2.6 will change its behavior slightly on 1 September 1994, triggered by a
built-in software timer.  On that date, version 2.6 will start producing a new
and slightly different data format for messages, signatures and keys.  PGP 2.6
will still be able to read and process messages, signatures, and keys produced
under the old format, but it will generate the new format.  This change is
intended to discourage people from continuing to use the older (2.3a and
earlier) versions of PGP, which Public Key Partners contends infringes its RSA
patent (see the section on Legal Issues).  PGP 2.4, distributed by Viacrypt
(see the section Where to Get a Commercial Version of PGP) avoids infringement
through Viacrypt's license arrangement with Public Key Partners.  PGP 2.5 and
2.6 avoid infringement by using the RSAREF(TM) Cryptographic Toolkit, under
license from RSA Data Security, Inc.

According to ViaCrypt, which sells a commercial version of PGP, ViaCrypt PGP
will evolve to maintain interoperability with new freeware versions of PGP,
beginning with ViaCrypt PGP 2.7.

It appears that PGP 2.6 has spread to Europe, despite the best efforts of MIT
and myself to prevent its export.  Since Europeans now seem to be using
version 2.6 in Europe, they will have no problems maintaining compatibility
with the Americans.

Outside the United States, the RSA patent is not in force, so PGP users there
are free to use implementations of PGP that do not rely on RSAREF and its
restrictions.  Canadians may use PGP without using RSAREF, and there are legal
ways to export PGP to Canada.  In environments where RSAREF is not required,
it is possible to recompile the same PGP source code to perform the RSA
calculations without using the RSAREF library, and re-release it under the
identical licensing terms as the current standard freeware PGP release, but
without the RSAREF-specific restrictions.  The licensing restrictions imposed
by my agreement with ViaCrypt apply only inside the USA and Canada.  It seems
likely that any versions of PGP prepared outside the US will follow the new
format, whose detailed description is available from MIT.  If everyone
upgrades before September 1994, no one will experience any discontinuity in
interoperability.

Some people are attracted to PGP because it appeals to their rebellious
nature, and this also makes them resent anything that smacks of "giving in" to
authority.  So they want to somehow circumvent this change in PGP.  Even
though the change doesn't hurt them at all.  I'd like to urge them to think
this one through, and see that there is absolutely no good reason to try to
get around it.  This new version is not "crippled" -- in fact, it is the old
versions that are now crippled.  I hope that PGP's "legalization" does not
undermine its popularity.

This format change beginning with 2.6 is similar to the process that naturally
happens when new features are added, causing older versions of PGP to be
unable to read stuff from the newer PGP, while the newer version can still
read the old stuff.  All software evolves this way.  The only difference is
that this is a "legal upgrade", instead of a technical one.  It's a worthwhile
change, if it can achieve peace in our time.

Future versions of PGP now under development will have really cool new
features, some of which can only be implemented if there are new data format
changes to support them.  Like 2.6, the newer versions will still read the
older stuff, but will generate new stuff that the old versions can't read.
Anyone who clings to the old versions, just to be rebellious, will miss out on
these cool new features.

There is a another change that effects interoperability with earlier versions
of PGP.  Unfortunately, due to data format limitations imposed by RSAREF, PGP
2.5 and 2.6 cannot interpret any messages or signatures made with PGP version
2.2 or earlier.  Since we had no choice but to use the new data formats,
because of the legal requirement to switch to RSAREF, we can't do anything
about this problem for now.  Not many people are still using version 2.2 or
older, so it won't hurt much.

Beginning with version 2.4 (which was ViaCrypt's first version) through at
least 2.6, PGP does not allow you to generate RSA keys bigger than 1024 bits.
The upper limit was always intended to be 1024 bits -- there had to be some
kind of upper limit, for performance and interoperability reasons.  But
because of a bug in earlier versions of PGP, it was possible to generate keys
larger than 1024 bits.  These larger keys caused interoperability problems
between different older versions of PGP that used different arithmetic
algorithms with different native word sizes.  On some platforms, PGP choked on
the larger keys.  In addition to these older key size problems, the 1024-bit
limit is now enforced by RSAREF.  A 1024-bit key is very likely to be well out
of reach of attacks by major governments.  In some future version, PGP will
support bigger keys.  This will require a carefully phased software release
approach, with a new release that accepts larger keys, but still only
generates 1024-bit keys, then a later release that generates larger keys.


- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Myth #2:  PGP 2.6 is weaker than previous versions, with a back door.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is not true.  I would not allow MIT or anyone else to weaken PGP
or put a back door in.  Anyone who knows me will tell you that.

This is not to say that PGP doesn't have any bugs.  All versions have
had bugs.  But PGP 2.6 has no known bugs that have any net effect on
security.  And MIT should be releasing a bug-fixed version of PGP 2.6
Real Soon Now.


- ----------------------------------------------------------------
Myth #3:  PGP 2.6 was released without Zimmermann's cooperation.
- ----------------------------------------------------------------

Well, that's not true, either.  Or I wouldn't be telling you all this.

MIT did not steal PGP from me.  This was a joint venture by MIT and myself, to
solve PGP's legal problems.  It took a lot of maneuvering by me and my lawyers
and by my friends at MIT and MIT's lawyers to pull this off.  It worked.  We
should all be glad this came off the way it did.  This is a major advance in
our efforts to chip away at the formidable legal and political obstacles
placed in front of PGP; we will continue to chip away at the remaining
obstacles.


I hope this clears up the myths about PGP 2.6.  I urge all PGP users to
upgrade to the new version before September.  And I urge you all to use the
official 2.6 release, not anyone else's incompatible bastardized mutant strain
of PGP.  Please pass the word around, and help dispel these misguided rumors.
This letter may be (and should be) quickly reposted to BBS's and all
appropriate newsgroups.

"Secrets of a Super Hacker", Fiery, 1994, 1-55950-106-5, U$19.95
 
Despite Loompanics' reputation as a "dark side" publisher, this may be a very
good book.  It deals primarily with social engineering, despite the purported
coverage of other topics.  It would therefore be valuable reading material
around corporate lunchrooms, since forewarned is just a little bit more
paranoid and, therefore, forearmed.  As those involved with data security in
the real world well know, cracking is basically a con job.  Thus, The
Knightmare, if he really is "super", is a con artist par excellence--and is
pulling off a really great con here!
 
Revealing the secrets of social engineering poses very little threat to
security.  Con men already exist and will continue to exist.  Cracker wannabes
are unlikely to be able to carry off a successful con if they need to rely on
canned advice like this.  On the other hand, it is much more likely to shock
naive and non-technical users into an awareness of the need for suspicion and
proper procedures--albeit possibly only temporarily.  Thus, this information is
almost inherently of more use in data protection than in data penetration.
 
As for technical help for the cracker; well, are you really expecting great
technical revelations from someone who knows there is a difference between baud
and bits per second--and gets it backwards?  Or, who thinks 140 and 19,900 baud
are standard modem speeds?  Who thinks Robert Morris' worm found "original"
bugs?  (And who doesn't know the difference between "downgrade" and
"denigrate"?)  All the successful hacks in the book rely on social engineering
rather than technology.  Lots of jargon is thrown in along the lines of, "You
need X," but without saying what X really is, where to get it, or how to use
it.
 
The official definition of a hacker in the book is of the "good side" seeker
after knowledge.  As it is stated early on, a hacker *could* do lots of
mischief--but doesn't.  In the course of the text, though, the image is much
more convoluted.  The book almost seems to be written by two people; one who is
within the culture and has the standard confused cracker viewpoint, and
another, sardonically aware of pulling the wool over all the wannabes' eyes. 
The chapter on contacting the *true* hacker community is EST-like in its
refusal to define when you might have made it, or how.
 
Like I said, buy it for the corporate or institutional lunchroom.  Make sure
that the non-techies get first crack at it.  If you'll pardon the expression.

	     The National Intellectual Property Law Institute 


The International Cryptography Institute will focus on problems and challenges
associated with the use of cryptography within nations and for international
communications.  The Institute will address such questions as: What are the
different national policies and regulations governing cryptography and how
might these evolve?  What cryptographic technologies are on the market in
different countries, what is being used, and what is it being used for?  What
problems is cryptography causing law enforcement?  What are the requirements
of businesses and other organizations?  What are the new trends in
cryptography and what will be their impact on society?  What efforts are
leading toward an international cryptography framework?  The Institute is for
government officials, industry leaders, policy makers and analysts,
researchers, and users of cryptographic technologies.

According to the U.K. Press Association newswire (94.08.10), the final culprit
has been jailed for defrauding the British social security administration of a
small fortune:

LAWYER'S DAUGHTER JAILED FOR BENEFITS FRAUD

By Melvyn Howe, PA News

  `The daughter of a wealthy and respected lawyer was jailed for three and a
half years today for her part in a massive countrywide social security fraud. 
   Public school educated Olu Atobatele, regarded as a "pariah" by her
"shamed" family, took a leading role in a highly sophisticated operation which
involved 2,000 false identities and was the largest benefits conspiracy of its
kind in Britain.'

Key points from the article:

o	Part of a gang of 11 who defrauded the Crown of 1 million pounds.

o	She herself stole 90,000 pounds in 20 months.

o	The gang members used "details of students' identities" and fabricated
identities using information "from the Death Register at St Katherine's House,
as well as identities from the British and African edition of Who's Who to
make more than 240 bogus claims for income support between early 1992 and
August last year."

o	The Department of Social Security "has instituted new procedures" to
reduce fraud as a result of this scam.

[Comments from MK: 

Please skip on to the next message if you're not in the mood for a leisurely
stroll through some speculation.  I got to thinking about this case of a
Saturday afternoon and wrote down this little essay on identity in the real
world and in cyberspace.

Impersonation is one of the techniques used by criminals, including criminal
hackers, to acquire goods and services belonging to or due to others.  Many
people will be familiar with the techniques of "social engineering" (properly
called "lying, cheating and extorting") used by criminal hackers to obtain
information need in penetrating restricted systems.  Such techniques include
impersonating journalists, technicians and high-ranking personnel.
High-resolution colour scanners, photocopiers, printers and image-processing
software, have been turned to evil effect by high-tech forgers of currency and
of authenticating documents.

In the case above, criminals were able to bamboozle human beings into entering
false information into computerized systems--a kind of data diddling at one
remove.

Disproportionate public outrage over much-publicized social services fraud by
immigrants is pushing many jurisdictions towards insisting on biometric
pattern recognition (e.g., fingerprints) to authenticate claims on social
entitlements.  Such a system would preclude inventing identities to be claimed
by the same human being, since the "different" people would all have the same
fingerprints.

However, biometric systems do not solve the fundamental problem: the
difficulty of authentication of identity in today's world of fragmented
communities and highly mobile individuals.  Consider the true story underlying
the film "Le Retour de Martin Guerre" (severely distorted in the US remake
called "Sommersby").  A young man in mid-Renaissance France is forced to marry
an even younger woman against their wishes because of family pressures.  After
seven years of unconsummated marriage, he runs away, only to reappear many
years later.  With his detailed knowledge of everything he ought to know as
Martin Guerre, he is re-integrated into his village despite oddities like the
wrong shoe size and hostility from his own dog. Even his wife welcomes him
back to the conjugal bed.  However, envious relatives eventually challenged
him as an imposter.  The real Martin Guerre reappears and the imposter is
hanged.

This story has been part of French history for centuries precisely because
successful imposture was so unusual in agrarian Europe.  Most people never
travelled more than a day's journey from their place of birth in their entire
lives.  They married the people they had known all their lives; they were no
more likely to take on other identities than to learn to read.

Now contrast today's world: there would be nothing unusual about being born in
Tucson, growing up in San Francisco, going to college in Boston, taking the
first job in Chicago, moving to Denver, and ending up in Syracuse with a
spouse from Edmonton.  In such a society it's a wonder that there aren't
_more_ impersonations--and who knows, maybe there are lots but they're real
successful &lt;g&gt;.

Benjamin Wright, author of _The Law of Electronic Commerce_ and instructor in
the National Computer Security Association's online seminar on _EDI Security_
has often commented that we seem to demand more of identity in cyberspace than
we do in reality.  Suppose Able Baker carries on a discussion with Charlie
Delta; does it matter to either "who" the other is in another context?  What
_would_ matter is for an imposter to pretend to be Able or Charlie and
interfere in their communication by inserting fraudulent messages or
intercepting legitimate messages.

Real-world authentication fails because of reliance on paper documents which
are just too easy to falsify; perhaps computer-based authentication could
reduce such fraud.  Despite relatively poor reliability for any one biometric
technique, the error rates for combinations are very low.  Combining any two
of, say, fingerprints, retinal scans and signature dynamics, for example,
would provide trustworthy authentication.  The question will be
cost-effectiveness; would the enormous expense of installing huge numbers of
biometric input devices and the network and database infrastructure be seen as
justified?  And would the costs of protecting the "cyberspace shadow" (as some
writers are calling it) against tampering exceed the reduction in fraud?

The remaining difficulty is the bridge between social identity and identity in
cyberspace.  How does one ensure that the person registering as Echo Foxtrot
_really is_ Echo Foxtrot in other aspects of his life?  And how much do we
care?  Enough to implant a non-forgeable device in the person's body at birth
or upon receiving legal immigration status?  Yuk!  Sounds like the basis for a
police state, doesn't it?

I predict that under the increasing pressures of immigration (legal and
illegal), increasing economic disparities, and continuing entitlement
programs, the occurrence of impersonation will increase.  At some point,
fingerprinting will become mandatory for all claims on the social welfare
systems; eventually, pressures will mount for authentication even in the
initial claims for entitlements.  At that point, societies will turn to
mechanisms of authentication familiar to computer system users.  Will the time
come when microprocessors will be implanted under people's skin to transfer
their cryptographically-sound identifiers on demand? And what will the
consequences of such institutionalized scepticism be on social relations?
Will people meeting in person for the first time press their wrists together
to exchange public keys?  Will those who refuse to participate in rituals of
authentication be frowned upon?  And will such tokens become valuable
commodities--valuable enough to steal and trade in the underworld?  Sounds
like the subject for an interesting science fiction novel.]

<ADDRESS>

&lt;<A HREF="mailto:Peter.Ladkin@loria.fr">Peter.Ladkin@loria.fr</A>&gt;
</ADDRESS>
<I>Sat, 20 Aug 1994 21:32:45 +0200</I><PRE>

The German newsweekly Der Spiegel, issue 33 (1994) dated 15 Aug 94, contains
an interview with Bernard Ziegler, described as Technical Director of Airbus
Industrie, responsible for flight test and certification (`Zulassung') of all
Airbus aircraft.  There is a short background statement concerning the
accidents on pp160-161, and the interview is on pp161-164.

The interview focuses on the reliability of Airbus aircraft, in the light of
the following crashes: Bangalore, Feb 90 (A320: landed short of the runway in
clear weather, 92 dead); Strasbourg, Jan 92 (A320 descended into a hill in
clouds on a backcourse approach to the airport, 87 dead); Warsaw, Sep 93
(A320, landing in a thunderstorm, overran the runway, 2 dead, many injured);
Nagoya, Apr 94 (A300, copilot and autopilot in control conflict, eventually
nose rose at an extreme angle and the plane stalled, crashing tail first onto
the ground, 246 dead); Toulouse-Blagnac Jun 94 (A330, testing engine-out
go-arounds, stalled and crashed, 7 dead including the Airbus chief test
pilot). The Habsheim A320 accident is not mentioned. The header to the intro
says:

"Airbus Industrie is under pressure. Twelve total-losses since 1987 with 815
dead have awakened doubts about the concept of airplanes dependent on
electronics [`elektronisch hochgeruesteten Flugzeuge'].  Do technical failures
contribute to the series of accidents? Or are pilots overextended by the
`flying computers'?"

Here is a summary of what I surmise are the salient parts of the interview for
RISKS readers.

[begin summary]

Ziegler says they've had a lot of bad luck recently, contrasted with the first
14 accident-free years (except for the Iranian Airbus shot down by the US
Navy). But he suggests comparing the record of the A320 with that of the B727,
B737 or DC9 when they were introduced.  He says that Airbus is 30 per cent
better than the average of all builders - but he wants to be 100 per cent
better. He says there's no reason to change the Airbus `philosophy' of taking
over some of the pilot's tasks by computer, pointing out that all of the new
technology developed by Airbus, from `glass cockpit' to new types of
autopilot, has been followed by `all the others'. And, `[..] the pilot still
has the last decision. Whoever suggests the contrary doesn't know what they're
talking about.'

They discuss the problems in Warsaw concerning the late deployment of
airbrakes and thrust reverse, concerning which he points out that (a) it's a
requirement for all modern airplanes that deployment is not enabled until the
plane is firmly on the ground; and (b) there are particular limits on landing,
for example not when a tailwind is stronger than 10 knots, or when the landing
speed is too high. In Warsaw, these boundaries, which were carefully
ascertained in test flights, were crossed. Also, runway overrun is one of the
`classical' airplane accidents, regardless of type. When asked why the Polish
investigators singled out late deployment of airbrakes and reversers, he noted
that the report also misses important details, including the problem with the
false weather information given to the pilots, and notes that many of the
Polish recommendations contradict various requirements of the air transport
supervisory authorities. He said that the level of the compression sensors on
the landing gear, and the landing logic, has been changed for Lufthansa at the
request of the client, but that only an expert can tell the difference between
the old and the new landing logic.

There follows a discussion about computers vs other kinds of flight control,
during which he says that there is in principle no difference between more
traditional methods of control and the fly-by-wire of the A320, and that it's
an illusion to believe that there's ever a direct connection between the
pilot's hand and the behavior of an airplane - flying is in this sense
something artificial.

He says that there are always ways to improve airplanes, and they remain in
close contact with the clients to make such improvements.

He is asked about the involvement of the autopilot in Nagoya, and about a
prima facie similar problem with an autopilot in 1991 in Moscow (an A310), and
why Airbus had not modified all the autopilots of these types. He replies that
requiring expensive modifications is not a simple matter, and must first be
thoroughly investigated to see if they cause more problems than they solve
[not his phrase - I am paraphrasing. pbl]. He notes that Boeing has waited
twelve years before recommending modifications in one case.  He says that in
conjunction with the certification authorities, Airbus had developed an
autopilot modification and recommended that A300-600 clients perform it, and
after the Moscow incident had notified everyone officially of the correct use
of the autopilot [there are standard procedures for doing these things - he's
pointing out that the standard procedures for clarification of operating
procedure were vigorously pursued. pbl] After the Nagoya accident, Airbus
decided that the modifications they had recommended to A300-600 and A310
aircraft should be mandatory. It will take about 2 years and $60m to alter the
fleet.

When asked about the `spectacular crashes' in India, he rejects the
categorisation and points out the statistics for India show that it's a
difficult environment for airlines, and that the A320 crash happened right
after two B737 crashes. There's then some discussion of pilot training and
capabilities.

Concerning the A330 test flight crash in Toulouse, he points out that it was a
difficult but not dangerous test, and in response to a question concerning
entering the right autopilot `flight level', he points out that it was
mistakenly left at 2000ft but should have been at 7000ft according to the
checklist. He says that the fundamental error was that the crew let the
nose-high, low-speed situation persist too long, and speculates why: because
they took the nose-high situation for an anomaly and they wanted to see what
would develop [according to the preliminary report, it was pilot commanded.
They were confused as to which mode the flight control was in. pbl]; because
the test engineer trusted the pilot to know when to return to normal; and Nick
Warner [the chief test pilot of Airbus, one of the two pilots. pbl] had been
critised before by test engineers for retaking control too quickly, and maybe
was sensitive to potential criticism in this case also. It was a question just
of two seconds delay.

The consequences, he says, will be that automatic protection will be developed
that will rule out such extremely unlikely accidents, and that the A330 and
A340 will be the first aircraft to be protected automatically against the
development of such a flight condition (`entsprechend ueberzogenen
Flugzustand').

[end summary]

A few comments - 

Warsaw: Ziegler correctly points out regulations concerning thrust reverse and
airbrakes. However, no mention was made by the interviewer or Ziegler of the
wheel brakes themselves. The wheels did not spin up on landing to the required
speed to allow the anti-skid system to function as designed.  Ziegler's
selection of the tailwind for commentary raises some hypothetical
considerations.  At the given landing speed, with the tail wind, the wings
were developing less lift than they would have been without the tail wind,
making it more likely that the braking functions would have been enabled by
the sensors. On the other hand, had there been no tailwind, the pilots would
have landed at the same indicated airspeed, which would have given them 10 kts
slower ground speed, but the same amount of lift preventing the sensors from
indicating ground contact. For similar problems not to have occurred in this
situation, the wheels would have not to have aquaplaned at this slower landing
speed. But in the accident situation, they did not appear to spin up to speed
until the ground speed was well below this, and much more of the airplane
weight was on the wheels.

It's a simple consequence of the landing logic that braking systems did not
deploy under the landing condition in Warsaw, as may be seen from an
inspection of the description of the logic in the Flight Crew Operating
Manual.  The sensor settings and landing logic has apparently been changed
sufficiently so that A320s landing in similar conditions, in a similar manner
to the accident airplane, will not suffer a lengthy delay in activation of
braking systems (brakes, airbrakes, thrust reversers).  The logic is written
in the Flight Crew Operating Manual which your local A320 pilot might be happy
to show you.

Bangalore: it appears the pilots were confused as to which control mode the
airplane was in. Under the particular conditions of flight, the engines went
to flight-idle and the airplane descended rapidly into the ground while the
pilots were trying to figure out what was going on.

Nagoya: The autopilot appears to have been engaged and in `go-around' mode
(`abort landing, gain altitude quickly'). The copilot, who was flying, was
pushing hard forward on the control column trying to land the airplane. The
autopilot was counteracting this by configuring the airplane aerodynamically
for full nose-up (this `trim' feature is a standard control in all airplanes).
When the copilot eventually let go of the column, the airplane's nose rapidly
rotated upwards to an extremely high angle (given the trim condition, this is
what one would expect) and the speed decayed severely, causing the aircraft to
stall nose-high, close to the ground. It hit the ground tail-first.  The
standard procedure in which pilots are trained (on this and all other
transport airplanes) is to disconnect the autopilot and ensure it is
disconnected if they want to hand-fly the plane onto the runway. There are
numerous puzzles concerning this accident.

Toulouse: Under the correct checklist settings, the pitch (nose-upward angle)
of the aircraft on takeoff would have been automatically controlled when the
autopilot was engaged.  The co-pilot who was flying rotated on take-off to a
high angle.  Meanwhile, Warner engaged the autopilot (which took three tries)
and `failed' the left engine.  It's surmised they were expecting the autopilot
to return the aircraft to a precise pitch as it handled the situation, as
planned.  The aircraft was flying in a different control regime than planned
due to the mistaken altitude-capture setting of 2000ft rather than 7000ft on
the autopilot. Pitch was not `protected' by the autopilot in this regime.
Speed decayed rapidly since the nose did not go down, the aircraft was unable
to maintain lateral control when it was below the airspeed required to do so,
and yawed and rolled. After this situation had developed, Warner throttled
back the right engine to regain lateral control, as well as regaining
wings-level and nose-level.  When control was regained, the ground was just a
little too close.  There are a couple of important reports on this accident in
Flight International for 10-16 Aug and 17-23 Aug.

Actually, my home state of Indiana did try to legislate that the value of pi 
should be 3. Here is some information from the alt.folklore.urban archives
from an article written by Mark Bader (<A HREF="mailto:msb@sq.com">msb@sq.com</A>) (Further information can
be found in "Mathematical Cranks", Underwood Dudley, The Mathematical 
Association of America, Washington D.C.).  James Dudley


THE STORY

The author of the bill was Dr. Edwin J. Goodwin, an M.D., of Solitude,
Indiana.  It seems that he was a crank mathematician.  He contacted his
Representative, one Taylor I. Record, with his epoch-making suggestion: if the
State would pass an Act recognizing his discovery, he would allow all Indiana
textbooks to use it without paying him a royalty.

Nobody in the Indiana Legislature knew enough mathematics to know that the
"discovery" was nonsense. In due course the bill had its third House reading,
and passed 67-0.  At this point the text of the bill was published "and, of
course, became the target for ridicule", "in this and other states".

By this time a real mathematician, Prof. C. A. Waldo, had learned what was
going on.  In fact, he was present when the bill was read on February 5, 1897.
("...imagine [the author's] surprise when he discovered that he was in the
midst of a debate upon a piece of mathematical legislation.  An ex-teacher was
saying ... 'The case is perfectly simple.  If we pass this bill which
establishes a new and correct value for Pi, the author offers ... its free
publication in our school text books, while everyone else must pay him a
royalty'", Waldo wrote in a 1916 article.)  But the House had passed the bill.

Fortunately, Indiana has a bicameral legislature.  The bill came up for first
reading in the Senate on Thursday, February 11.  Apparently in fun, they
referred it to the Committee on Temperance.  The Committee reported back on
Friday, February 12, approving the bill, which then had its second reading.

The Indianapolis Journal reported what happened: "The Senators made bad puns
about it, ridiculed it, and laughed over it.  The fun lasted half an hour.
Senator Hubbell said that it was not meet for the Senate, which was costing
the State $250 a day [!], to waste its time in such frivolity ... He moved the
indefinite postponement of the bill, and the motion carried.  ...  All of the
senators who spoke on the bill admitted that they were ignorant of the merits
of the proposition.  [In the end,] it was simply regarded as not being a
subject for legislation."


ANNOTATED TEXT OF THE BILL

/*  Following is the text of Indiana House Bill #246 of 1897, with my
 *  own annotations (in comment signs and exdented, like this text).
 *  In my annotations, A, r, d, c, and s are respectively the circle's
 *  area, radius, diameter, circumference, and the side of the inscribed
 *  square.  */

              A bill for an act introducing a  new  mathematical
        truth  and  offered as a contribution to education to be
        used only by the State of Indiana free of cost by paying
        any  royalties  whatever on the same, provided it is ac-
        cepted and adopted by the official action  of  the  leg-
        islature of 1897.

/*  You normally have to pay royalties on mathematical truths?
 *  The Pythagoras estate must be doing well by now...  */


        SECTION 1.
              Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State
        of Indiana: It has been found that a circular area is to
        the square on a line equal to the quadrant of  the  cir-
        cumference,  as  the area of an equilateral rectangle is
        to the square on one side.

/*  The part after the last comma is a remarkable way of saying
 *  "as 1 is to 1".  In other words, this says A = (c/4)^2, which
 *  is the same as A = (pi*r/2)^2 = (pi^2/4)*r^2 instead of the
 *  actual A = pi*r^2.  */

                            The diameter employed as the  linear
        unit  according  to  the  present  rule in computing the
        circle's area is entirely wrong, as  it  represents  the
        circle's  area  one  and  one-fifth  times the area of a
        square whose perimeter is equal to the circumference  of
        the circle.

/*  The formula A = pi*r^2 is interpreted as A = d*(c/4), which is correct.
 *  The author claims that the d factor should be c/4, so the ratio of
 *  the area by the author's formula to the area by the real formula
 *  is c/(4*d), that is, pi/4.  Since he believes pi = 3.2, this ratio
 *  is 3.2/4, which is 4/5.  Therefore the area by the author's rule
 *  is 1/5 smaller than the actual area.  Now he apparently thinks that
 *  the reciprocal of 1-1/5 is 1+1/5, and thus that the other area is
 *  1/5 larger than his area, which of course would actually require
 *  the ratio to be 5/6.  */

                            This is because one-fifth of the di-
        ameter  fails  to  be  represented  four  times  in  the
        circle's circumference.

/*  In other words, c = (1-1/5) * (4*d); consistent with pi = 3.2.  */

                            For example: if we multiply the per-
        imeter  of  a square by one-fourth of any line one-fifth
        greater than one side, we can in like  manner  make  the
        square's area to appear one fifth greater than the fact,
        as is done by taking the diameter for  the  linear  unit
        instead of the quadrant of the circle's circumference.

/*  He says that if we consider the area of a square of side x to be
 *  (4*x)*(x/4) and we replace the second x by (1+1/5)*x, we get an
 *  area 1/5 too large, and this is analogous to using d in place of
 *  c/4 with the circle.  */


        SECTION 2.
              It is impossible to compute the area of  a  circle
        on  the diameter as the linear unit without  trespassing
        upon the area outside the circle to the  extent  of  in-
        cluding one-fifth more area than is contained within the
        circle's circumference, because the square on the diame-
        ter produces the side of a square which equals nine when
        the arc of ninety degrees equals eight.

/*  I can only assume that "nine" is a mistake for "ten".  See also
 *  the annotation after the next one.  */

                            By  taking  the  quadrant   of   the
        circle's  circumference  for the linear unit, we fulfill
        the requirements of both quadrature and rectification of
        the circle's circumference.

/*  Getting repetitive here...  */

                            Furthermore, it has revealed the ra-
        tio  of the chord and arc of ninety degrees, which is as
        seven to eight, and also the ratio of the  diagonal  and
        one  side of a square which is as ten to seven, disclos-
        ing the fourth important fact, that the ratio of the di-
        ameter and circumference is as five-fourths to four; and
        because of these facts and the further fact that the rule
        in  present  use fails to work both ways mathematically,
        it should be discarded as wholly wanting and  misleading
        in its practical applications.

/*  The meat of the bill.  He says that s/(c/4) = 7/8, and d/s = 10/7,
 *  therefore d/c = (10/7)*(7/8)/4, which he reduces only as far as
 *  (5/4)/4.  Of course this is 5/16, and gives pi = c/d = 16/5 = 3.2.
 *  It also implies that the square root of 2 is 10/7.  */


        SECTION 3.
              In further proof of the value of the author's pro-
        posed  contribution  to education, and offered as a gift
        to the State of Indiana, is the fact of his solutions of
        the trisection of the angle, duplication of the cube and
        quadrature of the circle having been already accepted as
        contributions  to  science  by the American Mathematical
        Monthly, the leading exponent of mathematical thought in
        this country.

/*  When I first posted this I assumed that the A.M.M. must have had a
 *  policy of politely acknowledging crankish submissions, but apparently
 *  at one time they simply printed whatever they were sent.  I haven't
 *  checked this out.  */

                            And be it remembered that these not-
        ed  problems  had been long since given up by scientific
        bodies as unsolvable mysteries and above  man's  ability
        to comprehend.

/*  "Given up" is not the same as "proved insoluble"!  */

There are two biblical verses that show PI to have a value of three.
They seem to be the same information repeated, but from the King James
version as reported in the Library of the Future CDROM, which seems to
be filled with texts from the past:

Kings-1 verse 7:23  And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one
brim to he other: [it was] round all about, and his height [was] five
cubits and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

Chronicles-2 verse 4:2  Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from
brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and
a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

VANDALS CUT CABLE, SLOW MCI SERVICE

 By Elizabeth Corcoran 
 Washington Post Staff Writer 
 
    "Telephone calls between New York City and Washington on the MCI network
encountered traffic jams yesterday afternoon after vandals removed a segment of
cable in Newark. The problems began just before 2 p.m. and lasted until 5:45
p.m. 
    "MCI Communications Corp. spokesman Jim Collins said vandals `neatly cut'
out a 20-foot segment of fiber-optic cable that ran along a railroad overpass
above a street in Newark. The cable, which was wrapped in a thin plastic
casing, was not easy to reach."

The article continues with the following key points:

o	Repairs took about an hour after the break was located.

o	NJ residents, in particular, got many busy signals when alternative
routes were saturated.

o	Brokers on the NASDAQ exchange, including Dow Jones, were affected.

o	Motives for the theft of 20 feet of fiber optic cable are unknown.

[Comments by MK:  could this be a dry run for a class-3 (international)
information warfare attack?  "Let's see what happens when we deliberately
interfere with one of the major carriers...."]

RISKS readers will recall that six years ago, the Mexican ruling party PRI
evidently stole the presidential election through tricks with the
vote-counting computer.

Last month, the Economist had an article about preparations for the elections
this year in Mexico.  Their reporter interviewed a government official in
charge of elections; when he asked about the computer irregularities six years
ago, the interview was abruptly ended.

It seems that the elections this year were more open and fair than those six
years ago.  But there have been some questions raised again about the computer
system.  The IFE (Federal Electoral Institute) has delayed releasing the final
vote totals.  PRI representatives say the delay is because the PRD (opposition
party) is demanding recounts of each ballot box.  But, according to Reuters,
PRD representatives to the IFE claim instead that the delays were "due to
suspicious problems with the official computer system".  The Reuters report
continues to say that:

       IFE officials denied Thursday there were any problems with
    the computer system but said an investigation was continuing
    into an apparent effort by unknown individuals to infiltrate a
    computer virus into the main electoral computer.
       Interior Minister Jorge Carpizo said Wednesday that
    investigators had found some clues indicating who might have
    been responsible for the effort but did not say who they were or
    whether the effort was politically motivated or not.

Seen on page 2 of the New River Valley Current section of the
Roanoke Times &amp; World-News, Aug 24, 1994:

Corrections:

   Because of an overzealous computer spellchecker, a number of names in a
story on Radford University sports in the Welcome Students section appeared
incorrectly and were not caught by a sports-ignorant editor.

   Phil Leftwich is the former Highlander now in the pros.  Chris Connolly
plays ball in WIlmington, Del., not Laminating, Del., and there's no such
place as Educator, Ga. -- Eric Parker is from Decatur.  Chibi Johnson is not
in the least bit Chubby, and Done Staley is legendary, not Don Stellae.
Meanwhile, Paul Beckwith, who is no relation to Paul Backwash, departed for
Cornell.

   Because of a reporter's error, a story in Saturday's New River Current
incorrectly reported a July 20 vote by the Montgomery County Planning
Commission on a Price Mountain tower proposal.  The vote only recommended the
proposal for a public hearing.  But by a 5-4 vote, the commission recommended
approval of the tower Monday.  The Board of Supervisors will consider it next
month.

.....

The obvious first-order RISK is of course not keeping your spellchecker in
line.  However, the following should also be noted:

1) The correction contained the WIlmington with an upper-case 'I' - there's
nothing like having a typo in an apology for an errant spellchecker.

2) The first 2 paragraphs have an unusual amount of levity - the third is
reprinted as a sample of their usual correction style.  One almost needs to
wonder if in fact, the original error never happened, and that the retraction
is itself a creation of an AI gone amuck... ;)

Residents of Oak Avenue in San Rafael, CA, are victims of a burgeoning mail
problem caused when their street was "inadvertently" deleted from the Postal
Service's national ZIP code database.  San Rafael has several ZIP codes for
various areas;  two of these (94901 and 94904) have Oak Avenues with similar
street numbers.  Somehow the Oak Avenue in 94901 was deleted from the master
database of streets, and this deletion was propagated to all commercial 
mailers in the USA who subscribe to the Post Office's ZIP code update service.
The result of the deletion was that commercial mail programs automatically
changed all Oak Avenue addresses in code 94901 to the Oak Avenue in 94904.
The resulting flood of misdirected mail has caused the usual problems 
associated with missing bills, mortgage statements, etc.  Further, any
ZIP code changes back to 94901 requested when residents discovered this
error were automatically "corrected" back to 94904 by the programs which
relied on the Post Office's bad data.  This situation will persist until the
next revision tapes for the national ZIP database are distributed.

The article I saw (Marin Independent-Journal, 12 August 1994) did not explain
how a record was "inadvertently" deleted from the national database. I 
checked a printed ZIP code directory for San Rafael, and saw at least four
other pairs of streets which could also have fallen victim to the problem.
Fortunately, they did not.

Until the problem is fixed, Oak Avenue mail is being manually sorted.

&gt;&gt;Word has a summary info area, for each document, that cannot be turned off.

I wasn't aware of this specifically, but there is a much more substantial but
similar feature that I encountered in version 4.x &amp; 5.x of Word for the Mac.
I suspect that it exists in the PC versions as well but have not checked.
Fortunately, it's easy to test it yourself.  Just create a Word file.  Save it
with "Fast Save".  Re-open the file, delete something and save again with
fast-save.  Now use any external file viewer and look for your deleted text.

The following is an internal memo I sent out a couple of years ago:

                    --------------------------

Do you send WORD files via e-mail ?  If so, be aware that you may be
accidentally sending out your underwear along with your intended message.
 
        &lt;Dramatic pause for puzzlement and underwear checking&gt;
 
The default configuration in WORD for file saving is "Fast Save".  The way
this works is it only saves a list of edits and appends them to the existing
file.  When this file is opened, only the end result is displayed. However
when you send this file via e-mail, the entire file is sent.
 
So what does this mean ?  It means that if you use Word to delete stuff that
you change or that you don't intend to send or be seen; the supposedly deleted
stuff may still be present in the file.  The recipient of that file may be
able to recover some or all of the deleted information.
 
Under ordinary usage, this is not a problem.  Recovery of deleted text by the
recipient requires some specific knowledge and time.  For obvious reasons, I
won't explain the method.
 
If you have some specific reason to be sure that no deleted text can be
recovered, turn off Fast Save prior to saving for transmittal.  Otherwise,
your underwear may be visible.

                          ---------------

Actually recovery is not difficult at all, but the above was intended for 
a non-technical audience.

One should be careful pushing the envelope while calculating on the back of
it. I made one misstep in my piece in <A HREF="/Risks/16.34.html">RISKS-16.34</A> when I stated that 1000
passwords could be attacked as easily as one. I neglected to take account of
the Salt, which is a neat part of the UNIX password system that effectively
increases the size of the password space by a factor of 1024.

If you are attacking one password, then the time limits from the earlier
piece still hold if you're able to guess the salt ahead of time. This
may not be possible and it certainly isn't possible if you're trying
to use the "neat" trick of compare 1000 passwords in one swell FLOP. 

There are additional weaknesses that should be pointed out. If people only use
lower-case characters and numbers, then the size of the key space is even
smaller. This is only 36^8 possible choices which is about 1/76th the size of
the space made up of {A-Z,a-z,0-9}.

But who uses digits? Many don't. The number of 8 character passwords made
up of just lower-case letters can be searched about 1026 times faster. That's
less than an hour given the rough estimates. This pretty close to the 
size of the salt so the two cancel each other out and the running times
from the previous post would apply here. This emphasizes the need for
using different cases, numbers and punctuation in the password. 

When people use DES manually, they often just type in the key like a password.
(Many of the automatic systems choose keys randomly from the entire key
space.)  If this is the case, then all of the estimates from the earlier piece
in 16.34 also apply to this case without having to worry about the salt.
Clearly, any new standard encryption algorithm should include a method for
hashing a longer phrase down to a shorter key in such a way that the entire
keyspace is covered.

Finally, some have asked about shadow password files, a common UNIX system
hack that prevents ordinary users from access to the password file that used
to be kept open for all to read. It is unclear how common these are, but this
problem is really independent of the problem of attacking encrypted passwords.
People can get at encrypted passwords by sniffing the network as well as a
variety of other file system hacks. If the users could never get at encrypted
passwords, we wouldn't need to encrypt the passwords anymore.

I should point out again that my estimates of about the Cray came from thin
air. I have no direct knowledge of the exact architecture of the machine or
many of the small and medium sized details that could impose factors of 2 or 4
on the results.

There are several other details. Although most focus their paranoia on the
NSA, there are many others who might come to own such a machine. The Cray
computer eventually emerging from this project should be available on the open
market. It will undoubtably have many uses in many arenas. The memory
architecture may grow to be popular in desktop machines because it can be used
to do ray tracing, CAD applications and many other computational projects.
Other Cray innovations are now common on desktop machines. That may be well
into the future, but concentrating on that is one way to keep from getting
mired in the past.

The Washington Post newswire (94.08.29) reports on the growing use of Internet
services by the US Congress and Senate:

"E-Mail Puts Congress At Voters' Fingertips; House, Senate Venturing Onto the
Internet"
 By Elizabeth Corcoran 
 Washington Post Staff Writer 
 
    "When the House of Representatives was weighing an amendment to a bill on
education earlier this year, constituents swamped Rep. Elizabeth Furse's
office with questions and concerns.
    "The Oregon Democrat took to the information highway: Along with
conventional interviews, she posted soothing explanations on various computer
bulletin boards. The uproar died down, and the bill passed."

The author makes the following key points:

o	Growing use of Internet access throughout the US government, including
legislators, support staff, and government employees.

o	White House plans to put multimedia documents online by mid-September.

o	"...about 40 representatives and 30 senators have acquired Internet
addresses; about that many more members and committees in both houses have
requested access."

o	Enthusiasts praise the immediacy of the electronic communications
channel.

o	Voters can obtain detailed information online about legislation.

o	Congressional staffers are working on security measures "to protect
its paths onto the Internet from hackers bent on disrupting databases."

o	Remote voting by legislators is a possibility under discussion for the
long term.

[Comments by MK:

1) Disproportionate weight

In social psychology, one of the observations about how people form judgements
about issues ("social cognition") is that _salience_ influences judgement.
That is, the unusual, the exceptional, the striking--these factors insensibly
lead us to overestimate their importance.  In experimental work over many
years, psychologists have found that anyone who is noticeably different in a
group picture is assumed unconsciously by observers to have special
importance.

Until Internet access becomes more widespread, anyone sending E-mail to a
Congresscritter is likely to be considered with greater interest than someone
sending snailmail--simply because of the novelty.

2) Spoofs

Congresscritters naturally weigh public comments with an eye to voter
preferences.  If there 20,000 messages supporting a particular initiative and
500 opposing it, the recipient may be influenced in favour of the proposal.

And how will the congressional staff judge how many people sent the 20,000
messages if there is no authentication of the identity of the senders?  Yes,
fraudsters could go to the trouble of generating thousands of printed messages
and mailing them from the appropriate district (so the postmark would fit).
Mind you, it would be quite a job, what with using different fonts, margins
and wording to simulate the contributions of individual voters.

What a contrast with E-mail!  Without public key signatures, a computer
program could generate thousands of E-mail messages using randomizers for the
text and a list of fraudulent identifiers.  Even _with_ public keys, if the
Bad Guys chose to certify thousands of their own pseudonyms, nobody could stop
them--and it is unlikely that Congresscritters would know which keys had been
certified by criminals.

3) Representative democracy

Each letter and phone call to a legislative office is assumed to represent the
opinions of many others who have not taken the time to communicate with their
representatives.  The practice of allowing free mail to representatives is
supposed to increase the availability of such communications.

What assumptions will legislators make about E-mail?  And what will be the
demographic attributes of E-mail senders?  I think there's scope for some
pretty intensive research here before anyone draws conclusions about the
population sending political E-mail.

Legislators must analyze issues, not merely tally indices of popularity.  And
with electronic communications, they must be especially wary of taking the
easy path of vote-counting.  Some of those "voters" may be phantoms, and the
rest may be very different from "normal" voters.

Many commentators have suggested that access to the Internet may widen the gap
between the enfranchised intelligentsia and the disenfranchised masses.  As
E-mail links to legislators increase, it will be important to monitor the gap.
If it becomes intolerable, that gap will have to be closed by widening access
to the proposed National Information Infrastructure.]

It doesn't take a law to make pi = 3. On some old versions of Basic for
PDP-11s, you could assign any value to the "constant" pi.  The constant was
contained in a shared run-time system (with write permission!), and changing
it in one program changed it for all Basic programs (until the rts was
reloaded).

Here's an obvious risk that I am not sure exists for all banks but here's the
deal:

I use to live in dorms and when I opened an account with a local bank,
they sent 3 or 4 packets of checks.  I put the extra packets in my desk.
Unfortunately, my roommates were less than honest and forged a check
for some pizza. I noticed 1 or 2 packets missing so I had the bank stop
payment for all the packets of checks that were missing.  More than 6 months
later, after I moved, I grabbed a packet of checks, and wanted to verify
these were good ones and not ones I had previously stopped payment on.

I called up the bank and the lady told me , if the checks had been stopped
payment for more than 6 months, it is automatically purged from the system ,
and are good again.  I asked her, `If I stole a few packets of blank checks
from someone, I could just wait 6 months for the stop payment to roll over in
your system, and begin forging again?'  And she said, `Yea, but not a lot of
people know that.'  Well, gee, that makes me feel safer.

I am not sure if this is true for most banks, but I wouldn't be surprised if
it were so.

I just purchased a 900Mhz spread spectrum phone from Escort (the radar
detector people).  They don't take P/O's, so I had to order with a credit
card.  I'm not sure I want to show the following credit card receipt to the
ladies down in purchasing...

A pressure valve in the St. Louis city water system opened inadvertently and
the resulting pressure spike damaged water mains in 15 locations throughout
the City.  It also tripped 14 fire alarms by disrupting sprinkler systems.
 
The city water division suspects that a Southwestern Bell Telephone Company
repair crew caused an "errant electronic command" which opened the 66-inch
(168 cm) diameter valve.  The crew was working on a data transmission line at
the pressure control room at the Chain of Rocks water works in St. Louis.
Southwestern Bell is not officially aware of any link between the repair and
the mishap but will "be happy to work with the city to determine if there is
any link."  [Source: Article by Tim O'Neil and Melanie Robinson in the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch, 30 August 1994.]

A 25 Aug 1994 article in the *San Jose Mercury News* discusses BADGER (Bay
Area Digital GeoResource), an "electronic library of maps, census data,
property lines and environmental features."

This is a project funded by NASA and involves Bay Area cities+towns, a company
called Smart Valley, NASA Ames, Lockheed, and other companies to "create a
shared data base of geographic information about the Bay Area and the software
to help cities use it to identify polluters, prevent power failures or plan
land-use policies."

Sounds pretty benign until you get to the discussion of use of this data by
private companies for identifying potential customers, to wit:

        Organizers say private companies might make use of the mapping service
        as well.  For example, a satellite photo that located swimming pools
        could be cross-referenced to a property-tax map to create a data base
        of pool owners.  That could be useful to pool-cleaning services.

        With high-resolution satellite images, roofers might be able to locate
        homeowners with aging wood shake roofs.

The risks to personal privacy are, I think, obvious.

KINGSTON, Ontario -- The success of a recent trial of the Northern Telecom
Millennium pay phone at Collins Bay Prison in Kingston, Ontario, may mean the
system is set to go to prison for life.

Northern Telecom partnered with the Canadian Federal Correctional Services,
telephone consortium Stentor, and Bell Canada, to customize the flexible
Millennium system architecture to fit the unique demands of a prison setting.
The resulting "Millennium Inmate Solution" includes real-time management of
inmate phone traffic to allow or restrict numbers, and enhance fraud control.

Production on the Millennium Inmate Solution is slated to begin in Calgary by
year-end, after final reviews by Stentor and the federal government. Roll out
to federal prisons coast to coast is planned for the first quarter of 1995.
The new prison phone system was also very well received by the American
Correctional Association when it was shown at their conference this month in
St. Louis, Missouri.

[Based on radio reports]

Last night (Tue Aug 30), callers to the NSW Police's emergency 000
phone number in Sydney could not get through for a period of about
five hours from 7.30 pm.  Emergency calls to fire and ambulance,
which are also reached by 000, were not affected. One caller, who
was reporting a robbery in progress, was asked to call the local
police station.  000 calls in other areas e.g. Newcastle and
Wollongong were not affected.

The State Commander [Officer in charge of day to day operations for NSW]
said that nothing like this had ever happen before, to his knowledge.

Police are investigating the failure.

I noticed the following on net-happenings as an explanation of why a promised
World Wide Web search tool was not released.  It doesn't give full details,
but, for those who can read between the lines, you can see that such a local
client search tool would consume enormous amounts of bandwidth.  I'm glad that
the developer had the good sense not to pursue it.  "Some searches were not
meant to be meddled with, Dr. Lemieux!"  :-)

SENDER: Mac WWW Worm &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lemieuse@ere.umontreal.ca">lemieuse@ere.umontreal.ca</A>&gt;
Subject: [announce] Mac WWW Worm

     First, sorry for my french colleagues for this english answer.  I
     just didn't want to write it twice...  

			      ----------

Here are my presents thoughts about that:

1- Due to the net traffic that would be produce by such an easy-to-use
   'bot, I first decided that it should _never_ be widely released.

2- My Mac WWW worm was an engine designed to search for specific
   topics.  He was downloading lots of pages, but kept informations
   only about a little portion of them.  This way there's a lot of
   wasting in net resource.

   So, if you were striving to get such a tool, you should consider
   using one of the publicly accessible WWW Database.

3- Everyone running a bot without letting other people acces the data
   is _wasting_ resources, and should not be permitted to do that...

Anyone interested in the subject of WWW Robot should consider reading
the following document:

  <A HREF="http://web.nexor.co.uk/mak/doc/robots/robots.html">http://web.nexor.co.uk/mak/doc/robots/robots.html</A>

Before flaming me for not releasing the 'bot, read every thing you can
find under that URL.

			      ----------

Beside that, the MacWWW worm program still contains lots of neat HyperCard
script that can be easily recycled for any internet based material...  I would
accept to share all this material with any other HC-minded people.

Be aware that building net program is not a little thing.  Even if HC
permit it to be really easy, you should always keep in mind that the
internet is a _public_ network.  Don't waste other's resources...

Anyway, thanks for your interest.

In <A HREF="/Risks/16.36.html">RISKS-16.36</A> it was noted that `On some old versions of Basic for PDP-11s,
you could assign any value to the "constant" pi.'  I believe that on some
versions of FORTRAN you could do even better.  You could assign any value to
numerical constants.  While I never tried it, our FORTRAN lecturer told us
that (at least in the local implementation of the time) numerical constants
were collected by the compiler and stored in writable memory.  Statements like
`3=4' could then cause the chaos that you might expect.

I would suggest that another plausible explanation is that the cut was
designed to allow for insertion of &lt;something&gt; into the line at another point,
while the first cut was being fixed.  While the line was down for repairs,
such an insertion wouldn't be noticed...  I hope someone at MCI is thinking.

&gt; If all you use is printed copies, you're okay.  However, if you give somebody
&gt; the file on disk or send it by E-mail, then there may be unintended info...

This problem is not at all limited to Microsoft Word--there is another way in
which a file can end up containing unintentional disclosures visible to a raw
data editor.  Checking my own disk, I have found several instances of this.

There are many applications that don't write to every byte of their files.  On
the Macintosh (and presumably some other systems), when file space is
allocated, the system doesn't zero the allocated blocks.  Whatever data was
written there previously remains.  Thus, documents can end up with bits of
other--completely unrelated, perhaps sensitive--documents trapped inside them.

It's a particularly insidious problem, because once the old bits are trapped
in the new document, they remain with the document forever.  Even if you
prepare your CD-ROM (or whatever) on a pristine, newly formatted hard disk,
you may be copying little excerpts from the disks of all the machines the
documents originated from.

Gadzooks!  You (and the fellow that originally reported it!) are correct.  The
problem also exists on the Mac - though I don't see the "Summary" problem as
he stated for Windows.  Norton revealed the truth of the matter on the Mac.
Still, I don't consider this _fatal_ by any means.  I just won't send out any
Word (Fast Saved - which I keep don't use / disable, BTW!) discs. Thanks to
both of you for the warning(s).

I thought MS fixed the Fast Save bugs in 5.1a (note the "a"!).  Evidently not
this one!  Hullo Mr. Gates, are you there?

Tell me, do you know if this is a problem in Word 5.1a for Macintosh?  I
haven't encountered it yet, but I seldom rip into Word files with anything but
Word. I'm curious, if this might not be used for a (future?) "restore to
previously saved version" type thing... but again, why just on "Fast Save"?!
Hmmmm.... I'd like to hear MS explain/correct this one (making a note to call
tomorrow!).

Bullwinkle sez: "Watch this Rocky! Now I'll use CPS Tools to do a Word file
recover operation and see which variation of the file it prefers... "  I
suspect I know... :-&lt;

&gt;Word summary info area for each document that cannot be turned off.

   I was using On Location (an excellent Mac utility which builds indices and
enables you to find every document on your hard disk containing a given text
string) to look for a letter to "Richard Jones" I had written 2 years ago.  OL
found such a document -- a WriteNow template letterhead I employ -- but when I
opened this document the contents appeared to be a later letter to someone
else.

   On a hunch I tried the WriteNow "Revert to Saved" menu command, and the
original letter to Richard Jones appeared.

   Whether this could be a security hole if I sent the later letter by file
transfer or over a net to someone else who also had WriteNow, I can't say.
Maybe I had only printed the later letter and not Saved it; maybe I typed it
in and did a "Save As", leaving the Jones letter still hidden in the
template's hidden backup area.

I believe I can explain the reported 6-month auto. purge on check stops, in a
way which precludes the obvious risk in the usual check-stop case, although
not in the actual case reported by Christopher Klaus.

There is a U.S. federal banking regulation which says that a check dated more
than 6 months ago is deemed "stale," relieving the maker of the check of
obligation to honor it.  (The banks don't however themselves generally monitor
the currency of this date, any more than they generally verify that the
signature is valid.  Instead, they generally accept the check only with
recourse to the payee, and subject to collection from the maker; and they send
the maker, their account holder, a periodic checking account statement saying
that he has 10 days [or whatever] to protest, after which he is deemed to have
accepted the checks for payment.  Thus the banks mostly leave it to you to
know and claim your rights, while making very sure that they don't get caught
in the middle.  Thus the only time the bank will actually fully vet a check is
when they're cashing it without recourse back to the payee.)

Anyway, the 6-month-stale rule was presumably established in
pre-current-computer-technology days, to bound the records and balances which
must be maintained for outstanding checks, by the maker for all such checks,
by the maker and the bank for stopped checks.

In conjunction with this rule, a 6-month check stop works fine for checks
which have been made and dated and issued and then stopped for some reason.

In contrast, a check stop doesn't hold up beyond 6 months for blank checks
which have been lost or stolen.  However, you've got the right to simply
refuse a forged check on your account, per the discussion above, so
technically you're still protected; but the bank may make you sweat to
exercise that right.  In this case, I believe the only response that's secure
against even attempted forgery is to close the account, which is what most
banks would push for here.

Regarding Mich Kabay's article that reports the welfare benefits fraud case in
the UK and then goes on to make some interesting speculations regarding the
larger issues raised...

If it is indeed true that we can take approximate measurements of multiple
body characteristics and combine them to get a reliable indicator of
identify (passes the common sense test; has any authority written on this
subject?), then why not measure attributes of the face?

&gt;From what I have read of genetics and inheritance, and of course from my
own observations, the human face is highly variable.  We can speculate why
random variation and natural selection has given our species this
characteristic (reliably bonding parents and children?), but given that it
is there, we can also take advantage of it.  For example, we already
measure head size (for hats) and inter-eye distance (for glasses).  Other
advantages are that it is noninvasive, fairly permanent, always at hand,
difficult to forge, and well-established as an acceptable, nontechnical
means of identification.  Some difficulties would be separating identical
twins (and someday, perhaps, clones), and accounting for the effects of
injury, disease, and aging.

As a footnote, I read recently that people whose faces are considered
beautiful have facial measurements that are close to the average.
Measuring faces could be fairly compute-intensive.  If so, in the future,
Helen of Troy could be the face that launched a thousand chips.

&gt; Actually, my home state of Indiana did try to legislate that the value of pi 
&gt; should be 3. Here is some information from the alt.folklore.urban archives
&gt; from an article written by Mark Bader (<A HREF="mailto:msb@sq.com">msb@sq.com</A>)

There are three important corrections to be made here.  First, the act did
not assign pi the value 3; this is quite clear if you actually read my
article.  Taking the term "pi" to mean the ratio of circumference to
diameter, the bill assigned the reciprocal of this ratio the value (5/4)/4,
or in other words, pi = 3.2.

Second, my name is not Bader.

Third, "try to legislate ... the value of pi" is not really accurate.
A closer description of the legislation was that it attempted to
*recognize* a better value for pi.  However, because of the wording
used, if passed it would, as a side-effect, have assigned that value.
The intent is fairly clear from the description in...

(900#s in cyberspace)

I.      Overview

        During the final hours before the Senate telecommunications bill
(S.1822) was marked-up by the Senate Commerce Committee, a provision was added
which would expand the current FCC regulation on obscene and indecent
audiotext (900 number) services to virtually all electronic information
services, including commercial online service providers, the Internet, and BBS
operators.  This proposal, introduced by Senator Exon, would require all
information service providers and all other electronic communication service
providers, to take steps to assure that minors do not have access to obscene
or indecent material through the services offered by the service provider.

       Placing the onus, and criminal liability, on the carrier, as opposed to
the originator of the content, threatens to limit the free flow of all kinds
of information in the online world.  If carriers are operating under the
threat of criminal liability for all of the content on their services, they
will be forced to pre-screen all messages and limit both the privacy and free
expression of the users of these services.  Senator Exon's amendment raises
fundamental questions about the locus on liability for harm done from content
in new digital communications media.  These questions must be discussed in a
way that assures the free flow of information and holds content originators
responsible for their actions.

II.     Summary of Exon Amendment

       The Exon amendment which is now part of S.1822, expands section of the
Communications Act to cover anyone who "makes, transmits, or otherwise makes
available" obscene or indecent communication.  It makes no distinction between
those entities which transmit the communications from those which create,
process, or use the communication.  This section of the Communications Act was
originally intended to criminalize harassment accomplished over interstate
telephone lines, and to require telephone companies that offer indecent 900
number services to prevent minors from having access to such services.  The
900 number portions are known as the Helms Amendments, having been championed
by Senator Jesse Helms.  These sections have been the subject of extension
constitutional litigation.

       If enacted into law, these amendments would require that anyone who
"makes, transmits, or otherwise makes available" indecent communication take
prescribed steps to assure that minors are prevented from having access to
these communications.  In the case of 900 numbers, acceptable procedures
include written verification of a subscriber's age, payment by credit card, or
use of a scrambling device given to the subscriber after having verified his
or her age.  Failure to do so would result in up to a $100,000 fine or up to
two years imprisonment.

III.    Carrier Liability and Threats to the Free Flow of Information

       These provisions raise serious First Amendment concerns.  (Note that we
use the term 'carrier' here to refer to a wide range of information and
communication service providers.  This does not suggest that these entities
are, or should be, common carriers in the traditional sense of the term.)

       Overbroad carrier liability forces carriers to stifle the free flow of
information on their systems and to act as private censors

       If carriers are responsible for the content of all information and
communication on their systems, then they will be forced to attempt to screen
all content before it is allowed to enter the system.  In many cases, this
would be simply impossible.  But even where it is possible, such pre-screening
can severely limit the diversity and free flow of information in the online
world.  To be sure, some system operators will want to offer services that
pre-screen content.  However, if all systems were forced to do so, the
usefulness of digital media as communication and information dissemination
systems would be drastically limited.  Where possible, we must avoid legal
structures which force those who merely carry messages to screen their
content.

       Carriers are often legally prohibited from screening messages

       In fact, under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986,
electronic communication service providers are generally prohibited from
examining the contents of messages or information carrier from one subscriber
to another.

       Extension of the 900 number rules to all electronic information
services may be unconstitutional

       The regulation of indecent 900 number programming was only accomplished
after nearly a decade of constitutional litigation, with rules being
overturned by the Supreme Court.  The regulations were finally found
constitutional only after being substantially narrowed to meet First Amendment
scrutiny.  Since the access methods offered by online service providers are
significantly different than simple telephone access to 900 services, we doubt
that the same constitutional justifications would support the newly expanded
rules.  This issue requires considerable study and analysis.

       Content creators, or those who represent the content as 
their own,
should be responsible for liability arising out of the content

       In sum, it should be content originators, not carriers, who are
responsible for their content.  Any other approach will stifle the free flow
of information in the new digital media.

IV.     Next Steps

       Having only just received the language offered by Senator Exon, EFF
still needs to do further analysis, and consult with others in the online
community.  We also hope to speak with Senator Exon's staff to understand
their intent.  Another important hearing will be held on S.1822 in
mid-September by the Senate Judiciary Committee.  By that time, we hope to
have this issue resolved.  While we agree that these carrier liability
problems are in need of Congressional consideration, we do not believe that
the time is ripe to act.  Before any action is taken, hearings must be held
and careful evaluation of all the issues, not just indecency, must be
undertaken.

National Football League coaches will have radio transmitters this year to
send plays in to their quarterbacks.  RISKS readers may suspect that unless
the communications are encrypted, the opposing coaches will be able to
listen in.  However, a different security problem must also be solved.  The
last time this was tried in the World Football League, quarterbacks
sporadically picked up signals from local radio stations and air traffic
controllers.  You can imagine a situation in which the flight instruction
just happened to coincide with the name of a play.  Well, apparently the
NFL techies believe they have solved the interference problem this time
around; perhaps they resorted to the Playfair Cipher.  [Thanks to Tom
FitzGerald in the San Francisco Chronicle, 2 Sep 1994, p. E6, for reminding
me of this risk.]

The _Globe and Mail_ newspaper in Canada for 94.09.02 (p. A8) reports on
radio-frequency interference with building-construction cranes and other
devices:

	Breaking the spell of `winchcraft'
	by Mary Gooderham, Applied Science Reporter

	....Without warning--and with no obvious electrical or
	mechanical fault--the Kroll K-154 crane would shut itself
	off, sometimes while hoisting a bucket filled with a
	couple of thousand kilograms of concrete.  Two transmissions
	blew, their gears suffering when the machine's emergency
	braking system stopped the bucket in mid-air.  The crane
	sputtered, losing power last week to the point where it
	could lift loads only slowly, only a few metres off the
	top of the building.

The article explains that these problems caused major delays in the
construction site at Simcoe Place in Toronto.  Investigation revealed that the
equipment was being disrupted by radio-frequency interference (RFI), probably
from nearby microwave relay dishes and broadcasting stations.

Workers with experience at the Scotia Plaza site built during the late 1980s
recalled similar problems there; intermittent problems began once cranes were
raised above the 60th story and depended on the orientation of the
cranes--apparently because the cranes acted like antennas.  In that case,
engineers figured out that the RFI was disturbing "the wiring on the cranes'
direct-current motors."

Significantly, the Simcoe Place crane also has a new DC motor, whereas the
other, unaffected crane uses an AC motor.

The engineers installed some metal-coated foam usually applied to ductwork.
The problems stopped.  A lead shield is now being installed for more secure
isolation.

According to the contractors erecting the outer walls of Simcoe Place, their
laser level "started acting funny when it was used above the 20th floor."

	The receiver that picks up the laser signal beeped when 
	the laser was off-target or wasn't even turned on.  Wrapping
	all but its tiny electronic eye with the aluminum foild that
	usually keeps sandwiches fresh in the workers' lunch boxes 
	seemed to solve the problem.

The Evergreen Point Floating Bridge across Lake Washington in Seattle (SR 520)
has been notorious for its control problems -- either it gets stuck open or
stuck closed, or opens partially for no reason (which has led to one death and
one serious injury, on two separate occasions).  The draw span has been
rebuilt this summer, although the following account (from the Seattle Times of
September 1) of the new controls will perhaps not be as reassuring to RISKS
readers:

  To ensure that the center lift span never again pops up accidentally, the
  old mechanical system has been replaced and is now controlled by a
  computer with a series of safety features that must be overseen by the
  bridge operator.

  "You have to push buttons to make the gates go down, the lights come on
  and the [actuating hydraulic] pumps to start," [project engineer Jay]
  LaVassar said.  "Every step has to be completed before you can go to the
  next step."

    MULTICARRIER TELEPHONE SYSTEM COLLAPSES AFTER 4 DAYS--
A telecommunications system that allows callers to choose their own
long-distance telephone company, called the multicarrier, collapsed only 4
days after its inauguration. The system failed because callers were using
codes obsolete with the start-up of the multicarrier, confusing the
system. Talca and Curico, the first cities to have the multicarrier
installed, were the first to experience problems. The entire country will
be hooked up by late October. (La Epoca, p. B6)

The Montreal _Gazette_ for 94.09.01 reports on page E1 about a pipe-bomb
explosion related to computer bulletin board anarchist files:

	Boy loses 3 fingers in pipe-bomb explosion:
	Kirkland youngster, 13 and 15-year-old friend
	were following instructions on a computer.

	by Ann Carroll, _The Gazette_

	A 13-year-old Kirkland boy lost three fingers on
	one hand and his 15-year-old friend was seriously
	injured last week when a pipe bomb they were making
	--following instructions on a home computer disk--
	accidentally exploded.

The article states that the boys had "decided to try an experiment they had
picked up from a computer information network."  The little idiots ignited the
"high-powered flare" and it exploded in the hands of the 13-year-old.  The other
boy is undergoing continuing treatment to remove shrapnel from his hand.

The mutilated victim's mother destroyed the diskette containing the instructions
but does not know the information's source.

Q: 	"What about the Alansky case in Hartford where the cops 
	are attacking a BBS for having bomb-making info?"

A: 	[Deth Vegetable answers] I wrote those files when I was 
	15; and the files are in the news again in Montreal.  
	Some kids used my files and blew up their fingers.  
	I feel bad about that.  However, anyone stupid enough 
	to use the files to make bombs deserves what they get.  
	It's like Darwin, you know?  In Canada they don't have 
	guaranteed free speech, so the cops are taking boards 
	down for having this stuff on them.  Alansky got 28 
	onths in jail.  His lawyer said he didn't want to get 
	involved with the First Amendment.  So Alansky 
	plea-bargained and then went to jail.  There were other
	irregularities; e.g., they didn't inform the lawyer of 
	the location for the indictment.

Q: 	[MK, loudly] "Why publish such files at all?" 
	[Furious faces circle on me from all quarters; 
	people recite, "Information Wants to be Free" and snarl, 
	"There was nothing illegal about it" and "He had a 
	right to post it."]

A: 	[Someone hands me a note written by Voyageur] 
	"We provide the files in order to protest our rights 
	to the freedom of information.  If we voluntarily 
	censor ourselves, we do as much as if the government 
	were doing it itself.  We maintain our rights through 
	the exercise and use of our rights.  In addition, many 
	adults enjoy pyrotechnics as a recreational activity.  
	Quality information provided at low or no cost greatly 
	reduces the risk of pyrotechnic experimentation 
	resulting in unfortunate accidents."

	....

	Discussion about posting bomb files with Deth Vegetable 
	and others:

	[Would you like to be called Mr Deth or Mr Vegetable?]

	Most people call me, "Veggie."

	[Why did you post the bomb-making files?] 

	"The government has the power; so publishing the anarchy 
	files is important.  It's as if one day the revolution 
	will come and these files will arm the masses to rise up 
	against the establishment.  Anyway, it was funny to me 
	at the time [when he was 15, 4 years ago]".

	[What about now?] 

	"I wouldn't do it now.  I can't say exactly why.  I'm a 
	different person now....  Anyway, who's to say if it's 
	right or wrong?"

	[MK, seizing D.V.'s shirtfront and slowly drawing him 
	to an inter-nose distance of 1 inch:  "Who's to say if 
	it's right or wrong?  _YOU_ are.  _I_ am.  [sweeping arm 
	to indicate entire room] _We_ are.  We live in a society 
	of human beings who have responsibilities to each other.  
	We don't live in an anarchic paradise where you can 
	ignore the consequences of your actions by appealing 
	to a vapid ideology of non-involvement."]

\set disgust = on

I wonder if the fools who posted the pipe-bomb information have any shred of
self-respect.  "If it's legal it must be OK" is a prescription for amoral
anomie.  The National Computer Ethics and Responsibility Campaign sponsored by
the National Computer Security Association and the Computer Ethics Institute
includes a discussion of this attitude; we call it the "video-game syndrome."
The syndrome entails assuming that if something is feasible it must be
acceptable; "after all, if the game designers meant to forbid pressing
CTL-ALT-7 to shortcut to the winning frame, they should have programmed the
game to prevent it."  The next stage is, "If the system administrator wanted
to keep us out of the medical records, she should have put up better
security."  And then "If it were wrong to [name of reprehensible act], it
should be impossible to accomplish it.

The Reuter newswire for 30 Aug 1994 issued a report on the capture of Justin
Petersen, a criminal hacker involved in Kevin Poulson's radio-station contest
fraud in Los Angeles:

	HACKER NABBED AFTER NEARLY A YEAR ON THE LAM

	LOS ANGELES, Aug 30, (Reuter) - After nearly a year of
	searching, the FBI nabbed a computer hacker who pleaded 
	guilty to tapping radio station phone lines to win 
	contest prizes, a federal prosecutor said Tuesday.
 
	Justin Petersen, 34, was arrested after an agent spotted 
	him getting out of a car in West Los Angeles on Monday, 
	Assistant U.S. Attorney David Schindler said. Petersen 
	tried to flee, but was apprehended after a brief foot pursuit.

The article explains that Petersen admitted June 1993 to having committed
"computer fraud, conspiracy and illegally accessing computer files of a credit
rating agency...."  in connection with his nefarious deeds as a close
collaborator of the notorious Kevin Poulson.

At his October 31 sentencing, he could receive 40 years of jail and be fined up
to $1.5 million.

Although he cooperated with law enforcement officials in tracking down other
criminal hackers, Petersen disappeared from view and an arrest warrant was
issued for him.

Petersen called himself "Agent Steal" and boasted about how much he was being
paid by the FBI to inform on his pals at hacker conferences.

Barclays Bank in the UK have a new computer system, and are currently inviting
customers to check their records, in groups. This week, customers with
surnames beginning with J-M are asked to check their records. So I did.

I gave my surname and postcode to the assistant, who promptly brought up my
records on a pretty Motif interface (used to be Windows, as I recall).
Numerous records needed updating. Some were rather dubious. The first recorded
how long I had held an account with them. This hadn't been altered since the
last time I gave them this information, two years ago. It's bad enough telling
them how long they'd had a record of me when they first got the earlier system
going, but they don't seem to update this information at all, and it doesn't
seem to be a time reference. sigh.

The other dubious field was my salary, which occurred in two places (general
form, and employment form), and needed updating in both places. Why is there
this duplication?

A couple of other things bothered me about all this. The first was that I
wasn't asked for any more proof of identity other than my surname and
postcode, and I got to play with all the fun figures that affect my life. I
know this information about at least one friend who banks with Barclays, and
their surname's further down the alphabet. :-&gt; More seriously, this
information is pretty easy to obtain. I raised it with the assistant, and she
informed me that these two pieces of information were considered more secure
than an account number. Sigh. I wasn't even asked to produce an physical ID.

The other problem didn't occur to me until I started writing this. The
assistant turned the screen towards me, and away from all the other people in
the bank. Unfortunately, this also means that she turned it towards the large
wall-like window, and all the people in the street. :-(

I have discovered that living outside the US puts you in the
database-never-never-land of People with Foreign Addresses.

I now expect to have to follow up several times after giving my address to
just about any US business: the first time to be told "we can't mail out of
the country" (read: "we can't make the computer mail out of the country"); the
second time to talk to a supervisor, who checks the procedure and tries to
enter the address; the third time to call back and discover it was somehow
mixed up (frequently as an American address with the German postal code as the
ZIP); the fourth time to request a resend with the correct additional postage,
which often must be hand-carried to the mail room... you get the picture.
With luck, I eventually receive a tattered envelope bearing several layers of
metered postage stickers, US postal reject stamps and some handwriting from
the Bundespost employee who managed to successfully interpret the address once
the letter finally crossed the ocean.

Then there are the firms like the credit reporting agency that told me the
only way to fix my garbled address was to contact each of the companies listed
on my credit report...which of course couldn't be mailed out of the country.

The risks?  As usual, computerization can greatly streamline handling of the
routine, but can also eliminate the flexibility to handle exceptions.  And, in
an increasingly international world, not everybody has a ZIP code.

Re James Ashton's comments in <A HREF="/Risks/16.37.html">RISKS-16.37</A> on changing the value of constants
in Fortran compilers, it was indeed possible to do so on some Fortran and
other compilers. I demonstrated this to my students in the fall of 1972 using
one of the Fortran (I think it was either G or H) compilers on MTS (the
Michigan Terminal System, a time sharing system using IBM 360 tools).

The compiler would not let you assign a new value to a constant directly. One
had to pass the constant as an argument to a subroutine. Inside the
subroutine, one referenced the argument as a variable and hence one could
assign new values to it. Since subroutine arguments were passed by reference,
the value was changed by the assignment and subsequent references to the
constant at any later time and in any procedure reflected the new value.

My guess is that this trick would have worked on any IBM 360 system using the
same compiler. Other compilers would flag the assignment line in the called
subroutine, complaining that one was changing the value of an argument of the
subroutine.

The issues arising from overwriting supposedly constant memory with new and
``useful'' information have been discussed many times in Risks.  This example
is more insidious than some because both the calling and called procedure
appear to be ``correct'' as stand-alone modules. It is the glue (calling
mechanism) which causes the problem. My application of this particular
compiler ``feature'' is just another example of what happens when the
``equivalence'' between algorithms and implementations fails in obscure and
hidden ways.

On the IBM 1130 system (circa 1970 for me), constants were kept in
memory.  The following would output 1 + 1 = 4 as the answer:

       CALL X(1)
       I = 1 + 1
       WRITE (6, 10) I
    10 FORMAT (1H1, 7H1 + 1 =, I2)
       STOP
       END
       SUBROUTINE X(I)
       I = 2
       RETURN
       END

Additionally, floating point operations were done via subroutines.  One night
during "student time", I exchanged the + and - subroutines (actually entry
points in one routine) on the system disk for about an hour.

Some years ago when I was at university I heard about a student who had
tried a similar statement in whatever language they were working in at
the time (I think it was a COBOL dialect) and it had worked.  The student
showed the program to a more knowledgeable person with great concern --
in case the program had "broken the 3 in the computer."

Fortran wasn't so bad as to allow "4=3". The problem is that parameters were 
always passed by reference, including constants. so that if you had a 
subroutine that incremented its parameter, calling it would increment the 
constant. This was worse than "4=3" since you couldn't tell by inspection that
   CALL SCORE1(3)
would change the constant. There would normally be a single copy of the
constant in memory since machines like the IBM 7094 didn't have inline
constants.

Believe it or not, there *is* a useful application for this sort of thing.
The IEC1131-3 compiler generates object code where all data objects are stored
in a lookup table, with constants and variables being virtually
indistinguishable. One reason for this is that while commissioning control
systems at site, field engineers often have to tune "constant" values to get
maximum results from the system. The object file format allows the engineer to
change what the programmer originally considered as a constant.

Ok, so I'm talking about changing the constants after compilation is complete
- the compiler won't allow the programmer to write to a constant - but it's
near enough.

  ... Statements like `3=4' could then cause the chaos that you might expect.

This is syntactically incorrect and should not work. However, the
following fragment could have the effect of changing 3 to 4.

	SUBROUTINE ASSIGN(I,J)
	I=J

While at RCA in the early 80's I was developing Fortran code for PDP/11-70's
and showed a colleague an example of what you described.  I believe the
example you cite is incorrect since the compiler could determine that the
left hand side of the equation contained a constant making the statement
illegal.  The procedure that would work, turning the constant '3' into any
other value is as follows.

Subroutine Foo

call change (3)

printf (I5)3
return

Subroutine Change (I)
Integer I
c change the value of 3 for routine Foo
I=4
Return

In subroutine Foo after the call to change, the compile time constant '3'
would  be equal to the value assigned in subroutine change.  This change
occurs because PDP Fortran parameter passing was call by address.  I believe,
and with age my memory is getting dimmer on the technical details, the PDP
Fortran compiler would gather all constant declarations in a subroutine and
allocate memory for the constants and load the constants in the memory.  I
don't remember if this memory was in the code space of the routine or in the
data space.  If the memory was allocated in the code space, the modification
of '3' would remain until the subroutine was overlayed.  If the memory was
allocated in the data space, the modification of '3' would remain until the
program stopped.

This problem would not modify the value of the constant '3' in other
subroutines, since the compiler would generate a new (local) copy of all
constants for each subroutine.

Close -- the actual problem was a bit more obscure.  I know; I've been bitten
by it.

Years ago (about 1983), I worked on Finite Element Analysis software at a
small company in Pittsburgh.  Of course, all of this stuff is done in Fortran
since the original public-domain SAP-IV and PLOT-10 packages were in highly
condensed and uncommented Fortran.

We ran into a problem with the "constant" zero occasionally assuming other
values in one particular module on a Prime 750 running PRIMOS.  The problem
was caused by a sequence of statements of the form:

	call somefunction(iargument,0)
	...
	call anotherfunction(0)

The first callee looked something like this:

	subroutine somefunction(iarg,icount)
	integer*4 iarg,icount
	...
	icount = icount + 1
	...
	return
	end

Of course, Fortran uses call-by-reference rather than call-by-value, so it has
to push an address on a stack instead of a literal value.  To do this with a
constant, like 0, it has to dump the constant into a literal pool and pass the
address of the literal pool entry to the subroutine.  The compiler "optimized"
the other zero-value references in the same module to refer to this
"convenient" constant.  Then, when the subroutine modified the value of zero
in the literal pool, the optimized references were then subtly wrong.  The
following call passed a value of 1 instead of 0 to the next function,
resulting in a skipped element in an array.

Fortunately for my sanity, PRIMOS had a superb debugger, and I knew enough
assembly to figure out what had happened.  (Playing with memory- to-memory
only architectures like the Westinghouse W2500 -- a machine with core memory
and a RAM scratchpad -- in my misspent youth also helped.  ;-})

I've never seen a Fortran compiler that allowed assignments of this form, as
this should be easily detected by the parser.  However, code similar to the
following has worked on every Fortran I've ever tested it on (various DEC,
CDC, Cray, and Sun compilers, at least);

      program modify
      
c     attempt to modify the value of a constant
c     output will probably be 987.654, not the expected 123.456
      
      call modif(123.456)
      
      print *,123.456

      stop
      end
      
      subroutine modif(x)
      real x
      
      x = 987.654
      
      return
      end

Tricks like this generally don't work with small (absolute value) integer
constants, as most machines provide instructions to load such values into
registers without accessing memory.  But as Mr. Ashton noted, other constants
are often stored as literals in memory, with the compiler efficiently reusing
the same location for each use of a particular value.

I finally found time to take a closer look at the encryption algorithm
by Roger Schlafly that is used in PKZIP and have developed a practical
known plaintext attack that can find the entire 96-bit internal state.

The basic encryption algorithm has four steps, two of which are based on
linear shift registers, one is like a linear congruential, and the final
converts the contents of an internal state register into an 8-bit value to XOR
onto a plaintext byte.  A complete description of the algorithm is included in
the file APPNOTE.TXT, which is included with PKZIP version 1.1 (check Archie
for "pkz110.exe").

Although the algorithm is substantially better than the toy ciphers used in
many products, I have developed a practical known plaintext attack that finds
the 96 bit internal state.  Unlike the ZipCrack program I released a couple
years ago, this attack finds the internal state registers directly and does
not involve a brute-force attack on the password.  If adequate known plaintext
is available, my attack will find the state, regardless of the password's size
or content.

My attack is an improvement on a known plaintext attack described in a paper
by Biham (unpublished work) that takes 2^38+ operations.  My improvements
reduce the amount of work required by approximately a factor of 1500 with 200
bytes of plaintext.  With less plaintext the attack will take somewhat more
time, but just 40 bytes should be enough to be practical.  I've written code
for all steps of the attack; a version written in C with a few optimizations
in inline assembly runs in less than a day on my '486.  The attack will work
with versions 1.1 or 2.xx of PKZIP and other programs using the same
algorithm.

A more in-depth description of the attack will be made available soon, but I
wanted to let people using PKZIP (and any other programs that use the same
algorithm) know immediately about the weakness.

The September issue of *Smithsonian* magazine includes a long article on
"ubiquitous computing" research at Xerox, with some attention to the moral
issues relating to tracking and monitoring.

The 5 Sep 1994 issue of *Business Week* has a cover story on database
marketing.  Like most *Business Week* cover stories it's a superficial rehash
of items you might have seen elsewhere.  But it might be useful as a summary.

Finally, here is a wonderful quotation from a much longer article by Edwin
McDowell, ``The scrambling is on for off-season tourism'' (*The New York
Times*, 5 Sep 1994, business section, pp. 17-18) on off-season tourism
marketing:

  "Another reason for the growing success of off-season strategies is that
  "states have become a lot more sophisticated with their data bases", said
  James V. Cammisa Jr., a travel industry consultant in Miami.  "They know
  where the peaks and valleys in their tourism operations are, and they know
  how to market the off-season effectively.

  "Kentucky's data base showed that only 350,000 of the 2.5 million Canadians
  who drove through the state last year stayed overnight.

  "Our research showed that 83 percent of them come from January to 
  June, headed for Florida, South Carolina and the beaches of Alabama and
  Mississippi", said Robert Stewart, the Commissioner of Travel Development
  for Kentucky.  To entice more of them, Kentucky officials will soon hold 
  a press conference in Toronto and Canadians will be offered a card giving
  them discounts at hotels, restaurants and attractions along three of
  Kentucky's interstate highways.

  "Also for the first time, Kentucky is using direct mail to bolster anemic
  winter occupancy rates in its 15 resort parks that offer overnight
  accommodations year-round."  (page 18)

This kind of database marketing is worth thinking about in the context of
rapidly advancing proposals for thoroughgoing instrumentation of cars and
roads under the rubric of "intelligent vehicle-highway systems", particularly
given that most of the marketing organizations mentioned in the article are in
fact government agencies using commercial methods for the benefit of private
businesses.

The cover story of the current issue of Business Week (5 Sep 1994), a
conservative business magazine (sorry, Phil), is on Database Marketing.  The
goal of Database Marketing is to build detailed customer profiles so that a
company can target advertisements to specific customers for products and
services. This approach is highly successful: response rates are double digit
as opposed to 2%--3% for junk mail.

The data collection process starts with a customer's past purchases.  Other
sources include surveys, rebate requests, and warranty cards.  American
Express scans a customer's individual transactions to find patterns and to
suggest local places that take the card.  Many hospitals sell the names and
addresses of families with newborns.  The data is then combined with public
records, such as drivers' licenses, auto registrations, and property tax
rolls.  Ohio sold its drivers' license and car registration lists for $375,000
to TRW.  What results is a detailed profile of each customer.

The computing technology used to mine a database for prospects includes
parallel processing and neural networks. Neural nets are trained to look for
people likely to buy a product or service given the parameters in the
database, e.g.,

  what combination of income level, investment activity, and credit-card
  spending is most likely to be seen among people who are in the market for 
  mortgages?

The net is applied against each profile in a process called "drilling down."
This is a compute intensive operation and companies are starting to resort to
parallel processing or workstation clusters.  Indeed, it's estimated that a
large portion of the projected growth in commercial parallel processing, from
$400M today to $5B in 98, will be for database marketing applications.

When asked about the privacy issues, one marketer responded that the loss of
privacy is offset by the convenience to the customer of highly selective
advertising. I'll forgo the commentary and simply refer the interested reader
to the original source for more details and anecdotes.

I subscribe to the NETCOM Internet service provider.  Although new to UNIX, I
have been using computers for over 25 years, and had once worked for one of
the largest timesharing service providers in the world.  I currently work as a
consultant in the areas of software development on PC's and mainframes.

On a number of occasions while writing E-mail using NETCOM's MAIL utility, I
was chagrined to discover that my backspace/DEL key has been disabled,
yielding a "^?" rather than deleting the previous character.  This problem
also occurs at the UNIX command level, yet utilities, such as the PICO editor
and slower to use ELM E-mail utility interpret the backspace/DEL key
correctly. (Except for the subject line!)

Further investigation suggests the once this failure occurs on a server, it
remains till corrected by the staff.  Reloading my telecom package changes
nothing, getting another server does; but there is no means of selecting which
server will answer my call.  My E-mail complaints to NETCOM yielded various
responses from a rather insistent and unfriendly person regarding a "^H" in
the text, and flaming me as incompetent when I tried to point out that I
neither typed a "^H" in the E-mail, nor see it on my screen, and do not find
it consistent across servers; to several more gentle statements by other
persons to the effect that there are some differences between servers but that
is "Not a Problem", "not a bug" -- if you see a "^H", go fix your terminal
program.  I have even had one E-mail me that if I was not satisfied, I should
change to another internet service company.

     (For the last time, I see a "^?", NOT a "^H"!  And not on every
server!  If it is MY problem, how is it that their staff fixes it on
their end every once in a while -- even when I don't complain?)

The RISK of not reading E-mailed complaints is finding it in RISKS.

The RISK at command level is entering unintended ambiguities when attempting
to correct parameters.

The RISK is sending out correspondence with garbage characters and unmeant
words.  (As in earlier correspondence with the Moderator.)

And as a person who started in the field on a help desk in 1970, the GAIN in
LISTENING to what customers say, ESPECIALY when everyone else is telling them
to go away, is making good friends.  Their problems usualy turn out to be Very
Simple!

This problem reminds me of another problem I had as a student working on the
old IBM 360, where I would occasionaly see this error on my ONLINE-OS 2250(?)
video terminal:

   (IBM-ese number) ILLEGAL ERROR. 

whereupon my partitioned data set would be trashed.  There would be NO
hardcopy of the message.  The center staff would tell me, with varying degrees
of politeness, that I was "working too hard" or "staying up too late".

   Finally, after months of occasional problems, I spent one night looking
through A LOT of manuals to find the explanation that the error routine had
found an illegal pointer in the traceback chain, and thus it was the error
information that was "illegal".

   The first step in solving a problem, is listening to the person having 
the problem.   How can you solve a problem, when you don't know what it is?

I have to wonder whether there was any intended marketing connection
between the name chosen for the above-referenced communication system
(Millenium Inmate System) and the resulting acronym...

One can derive a lot of humor envisioning a Millenium press release
extolling the virtues of the system, but using only the acronym, and
then applying the discussion out of context in a community of automators!

The RISK here isn't entirely intuitive, but smells something like the
risk of choosing a product name without regard for semantics that might
be invoked by a segment of the product's potential market...

	I realize you are probably sick to death of the "3=4" thread,
but the thing that struck me was that all the contributions were of
the "When I was a kid we had to walk ten miles through the snow and
use a compiler that could bung up its constants" form. What saddens
me is that the introduction of the "reference" operator in C++ indicates
that computer science has apparently _not_ learned the lesson taught
by the earlier and very well documented problems. It is simply not
advisable to have a single character buried in a 1000+ line "include"
file radically change the behavior of:

{
	double my_angle,result1,result2;

	/* we can't make my_angle const, because it needs to be
	 * "tweaked" on a per-run basis, so neither prototypes
	 * nor MMU's can save us...
	 */
	my_angle = get_current_operating_assumptions();

	result1 = some_library_function(1,my_angle);
	result2 = some_library_function(2,my_angle);
}

	In C, one can be confident that no matter what else mat be
wrong with some_library_function(), it will _NOT_ damage my_angle.
In C++, the addition of a single '&amp;' character destroys the basis
of that confidence. I can forgive Backus for "changeable constants",
but Stroustrup should have known better :-)

	The average sailor will not spit into the wind a second time. The
average computer scientist does not, apparently, learn from experience.

There are a few points worth emphasising which follow from the Air et Cosmos
issue 1482 summary of the A330 accident preliminary report, along with the
1480/1 AeC summary of the preliminary-preliminary findings from the telemetry
data.

The A330 preliminary accident report singles out lack of pitch
protection with the autopilot in ALT* mode as a determining factor.

According to the report by Casamayou in Air et Cosmos 1480 (11-16 July), the
copilot rotated to 28deg to hold 150kts of speed (the airplane actually went
to 29deg), and the autopilot was engaged by Warner, who also retarded the left
engine and cut the left hydraulic pump to simulate an engine failure: `As
planned, the pitch of the aircraft started to diminish and passed from 29deg
to 25deg, the [pitch] limit authorised by the [flight] envelope protection
system FMGES (flight management guidance and envelope system).'

It is presumed that the pilots were expecting that the autopilot was to remain
in SRS mode (`Speed Reference System') under which there is automatic pitch
protection.  However, because the altitude was set too low (2000ft) in the
flight director (FCU), the autopilot reverted almost immediately to ALT* mode,
under which there is no pitch protection.  However, it was non-obvious for the
pilots to know they were in ALT* mode since it wasn't displayed on the PFD
under those flight conditions - mode info disappears from the PFD at 25deg,
**the same point to which pitch is protected by the FMGES**.

The preliminary report noted the lack of PFD display of mode as a contributing
factor, but not a cause.  Bernard Ziegler, technical director of Airbus,
singled out in interviews the action of achieving 25deg of pitch as one of his
main contributing factors [<A HREF="/Risks/16.35.html">RISKS-16.35</A>, also the specific figure of 25deg, a
`particularly high pitch angle' is found in Flight International, 17-23 Aug
1994, p4]. (The other two factors mentioned in the Speigel interview were the
2000ft altitude setting and that the pilots waited too long to recover.)

However, if you want to test pitch protection it follows you have to put the
airplane into more than 25deg of pitch, which is what the pilots did.  But
this is a flight condition such that you can't tell on the PFD what AP mode
you're in, and hence whether pitch is actually protected!  This info might be
available, but it is not displayed on the PFD.

Contributory factors that were also noted by the report: the full-aft center
of gravity, and the TOGA thrust on the engines. However, the airplane may be
legally loaded to full-aft CG, and if a go-around is needed on an automatic
landing, that's what TOGA thrust is for. TOGA conditions are statistically the
most likely conditions under which there is an engine failure.

All of the above is a matter of record, or of common knowledge.  I'd like to
add a few comments and questions of my own.

Firstly, the report implies that autopilot mode confusion played a role in the
late reaction of the pilots to the flight condition. They were expecting SRS
mode and got ALT* (for whatever reason) - they were expecting pitch protection
when there was none - they were waiting for something that wouldn't happen,
and they couldn't tell from the PFD.  Pete Mellor, in his article `CAD:
Computer Aided Disaster' and Robert Dorsett have noted that mode- or
control-law-confusion seems to have played a role in many of the A320
accidents as well.

Secondly, this airplane was loaded to within legal limits and was using thrust
appropriate to a go-around situation. There are US airports at which
commercial flights take place at which the missed-approach procedure requires
one to climb-and-maintain altitudes in the region of 2000ft. So, one might
consider the possibility that these three of the identified `causes' of the
accident were plausible, although maybe unusual, operating conditions.  The
airplane was pitched up by the copilot to 28 deg, in order (I would surmise)
to activate the automatic pitch protection mechanism, under conditions of
engine failure. Under these conditions, under autopilot control, the airplane
flew itself into an flight condition from which an experienced test pilot was
unable to recover in time. I wonder why more attention is not paid to this
feature of the accident?

The trim setting was singled out as a cause, but the report also says that the
accelerated rotation caused by this was controlled by the copilot, so I don't
see how it figures as a cause, unless it was seen as one-task-too-many.

For comparison and discussion in RISKS, I'd like to mention a possible point
of view different from that provided by Airbus [Ziegler interviews, Der
Speigel 15.8.94, <A HREF="/Risks/16.35.html">RISKS-16.35</A>, and Flight International, 17-23 Auf 1994, p4].
Namely: if the airplane had not crashed, seven more people would be alive -
but we also wouldn't have known that an A330 with full aft CofG is unable to
fly itself out of an engine-out-during-go-around situation if the
altitude-select on the AP is set at or near 2000ft and the pitch is slightly
above its 25deg limit of protection.

Is this computer-related?  I'm sure the A330 software will be changed.
If only because the Commission of Inquiry recommended it.

I received an ad from TigerDirect, Florida, offering a set of "650
High-Quality Logos" of major corporations. The ad suggests using "these logos
in newspaper and yellow page ads, brochures and cross-promotions." It goes on
to say "all images displayed are the registered trademarks or trademarks of
their respective companies." Can be used by Macintoshes or Windows
applications.

What a wonderful gift for con artists!

Bayreuth, Germany - Three violators of the municipal parking code became war
criminals when an official entered the wrong code number. According to the
"Nordbayerischen Kurier" the three Bayreuth residents received summonses for
"Conspiracy to prepare agressive warfare," when they should have only received
citations for parking violations. According to the paper, the official, who
had just served ten hours on the night shift, filled out the forms relating to
the minor offenses and incorrectly entered the code number of the violation.

A colleague, Paul Gibson, arrived at INRIA Lorraine in France from Scotland at
the beginning of July. He set up an account with a local branch of the Banque
Populaire de Lorraine in Haussonville, a district of Villers in the Nancy
conurbation. The address on his account is that of our host, who lives in a
tiny village 75km from here. The bank put a false postal code on his address,
consequently his mail from the bank arrives either very late or, in the case
of important items such as his bankcard PIN code and checkbook, not at all (I
wonder if the important mail has a `Do Not Forward' instruction on the
envelope?).  However, whenever he notifies the branch and they check, the
correct postal code appears with his account information.  The bank employees
claim not to understand how the two addresses can be different and seem to be
at a loss to rectify the situation, even though he's been physically to see
them about it three times in the last two months.

There's an easy fix. Close the account and open another one. But there should
be an easier fix - ensure the right address. Either way, the bank lacks
effective procedures for troubleshooting. He still has no checkbook and no
functioning cash card.

A new teleconferencing system installed at JPL still has some bugs.
Participants are told to dial into the telecon themselves.  Two numbers are
provided: an area 818 local number, and an 800 number for distant callers.  I
dialed the local number for a NASA/Galileo project telecon which turned out to
be seriously depleted; half the expected participants, including the convener,
were missing.  Attempts to reach the convener by phone failed; the line was
always busy.  We went ahead and had our discussion anyway, only to learn later
that a dual telecon, among the people who had dialed the 800 number, had taken
place simultaneously.

This reminds me of a curiously similar situation on Telemail about ten years
ago.  A user complained of often missing important mail.  Months later,
investigation showed him to have two accounts, differing only by the appended
organization.  His default login went to one of these, but the group mail
distribution list went to the other.  About a hundred messages were there
waiting for him.  "The Black Hole of Telemail", we always called it.

Here's an interesting positive-risk (rather than negative-risk)...

The McLaren Peugot Formula One racing team was investigated for breaking
the rule against computerized driver aids.  During the investigation, the
governing body (FIA) contracted with LDRA Ltd to decode MacLaren's software
and determine if the rules were broken.  According to the press release:

   PRESS RELEASE FROM THE FEDERATION INTERNATIONALE DE L'AUTOMOBILE (FIA)

   ...lots of stuff...and then the interesting paragraph...

       The World Council noted that during the course of the
       investigation, LDRA Ltd discovered a bug (fault) in the McLaren
       software which was producing a power loss in the engine (due to a
       faulty signal from the gearbox control unit to the engine control
       unit).  McLaren will now be able to correct this problem.

My understanding of neural nets is hazy, so someone please correct me if I'm
way off-base.

Neural nets are being used more and more in commercial applications, for
example in evaluating mortgage applications.

It occurs to me that since the internal state of a neural net, and its
decision-making "process", is essentially opaque, a lender could depend on a
neural net to implement redlining in a manner such that, if the bank were in
fact to be accused of redlining, the bank could reply, "We don't redline, we
rely on objective computer programs to evaluate applications."

The training set for the net could itself contain redlining, and the net would
learn it.  Then the training set is discarded, and there is no proof of intent
to evade the law.

Any applications receives a final yes/no from a live human being, but how easy
is it for the lending officer to let a neural net do his or her "dirty work" ?

Don't you just love it when you read about something that might happen,
happens! After reading Daniel J. Weitzner's comments about the proposed new
indecency rules, I read the following article on the front page of this
weeks New Zealand COMPUTERWORLD (dated Sept 5, 1994):

INTERNET SEX GOES OFF-LINE, by Rob Hosking 

    The prospect of being the target of an indecency test case has caused
Internet service provider ICONZ (Internet Company of New Zealand) to pull
its pornographic news groups and bulletin boards off line.

   "We've pumped hundreds of thousands of dollars into ICONZ and I'm not going
to see that go in a test case," says systems administrator Jon Clarke.  The
company pre-empted the impending litigation after hearing "through the
grapevine" that an Auckland religious group was planning a lawsuit following
an item on television news about the Internet.  Approximately 20 news groups
were taken off the wire, out of about 440, and only two users had complained
since their removal, says Clarke.  "To put it into some sort of perspective,
it's effectively stopped us transmitting 100Kb out of 150Mb a day," he says.

   The action would have been under the Films, Videos and Publications
Classifications Act, passed earlier this year. There is some doubt as to
whether the Internet is covered by the act, and the issue has yet to be
decided in court.

   Clarke says the material being carried is tamer than that available over
the counter in most dairies &lt;JM comment - read cornerstore, newsagent, etc.),
and he queries what he sees as a double standard involved.  Network users in
the US have formed a group to lobby against restrictive legislation and, with
the Howick MP Trevour Rogers' Technology and Crimes private members bill
currently before Parliament, Clarke says it could be time for the information
of such a group here.

   The material is still coming into New Zealand but is now "being put in the
great big bit bin", as far as ICONZ is concerned.  Clarke believes the
material will be available - "there are millions of sites worldwide you can go
to for this kind of stuff, the only thing is you'll have to pay for it".

&lt;&lt;&lt; JM's comments follow &gt;&gt;&gt;

This article raises several interesting questions:

1.  Do we really want local network providers to become our censors?

2.  How does the network provider filter 150Mb of data a day, especially
when he doesn't know what the law states is and isn't allowed?

3.  If a network provider, whilst censoring the days 150Mb of information,
reads that a "religious group" was planning a lawsuit against him because
they didn't agree with one of his services, what should he do? 

The internet provider doesn't lose either way, since as Jon Clarke points out
himself, his users just have to go further afield, and I'm sure he'll be happy
to charge for this.

The 1994 CPSR Annual Meeting will be held on the weekend of October 8th and
9th at UC San Diego.  One focus of the meeting this year is teaching people
how to actually do something about computer-related Risks to privacy and 
the like.  We'll have a workshop on privacy activism by Christine Harbs from
the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and Dave Redell from CPSR's Civil Liberties
Working Group.  We'll also have a workshop on legal issues for BBS operators
from Mike Godwin of EFF, and a panel discussion on the issues that arise when
protecting privacy and intellectual freedom in various professions.  Everyone
is welcome to attend.

Assurance and Trustworthiness was to identify crucial issues on assurance in
IT systems and to provide input into the development of policy guidance on
determining the type and level of assurance appropriate in a given
environment. The readers of these proceedings include those who handle
sensitive information involving national security, privacy, commercial value,
integrity, and availability.

Existing IT security policy guidance is based on computer and communications
architectures of the early 1980s.  Technological changes since that time
mandate a review and revision of policy guidance on assurance and
trustworthiness, especially since the changes encompass such technologies as
distributed systems, local area networks, the worldwide Internet,
policy-enforcing applications, and public key cryptography.

1995 WORKSHOP

A call for participation for the 1995 workshop will be available in October.

(As reported on KHON-TV2).

The Hawaii Republican Party was up in arms today when it was discovered that a
"hard disk crash" caused a number of absentee ballots on the island of Maui
(state of Hawaii) to inadvertently omit two candidates running for state
legislature.

The crash, which reportedly occurred at a California company which had been
contracted to print the ballots, means that over 140 Maui residents are now
being asked to go in and re-cast their ballots. This printing error was
discovered when friends couldn't find their friend's name on the ballot.

The security risks are obvious--if the printing of ballots is so dependent on
a single hard drive, it would seem fairly straightforward that people could
sabotage elections this way.

An AP item from 15 Sep 1994 (e.g., San Francisco Chronicle, D3) noted that the
Federal Trade Commission filed a false-advertising complaint against Brian
Corzine of Sacramento, California, for making false claims in promoting a
credit-repair program.  A federal court ordered the promotion stopped.
Corzine maintained he was merely a reseller.

In his famous paper "The relation of habitual thought and behavior to
language" (published in his collected papers, "Language, Thought, and Reality"
by MIT Press), the American linguist Benjamin Lee Whorf began with some tales
from his day job as an insurance risk expert, in which he described the lapses
of reasoning that led to accidents that his company had to pay for.  He says,
for example, that people often assume that an "empty barrel" is wholly
innocuous -- even if it recently contained gasoline and can thus be reasonably
expected to be exhaling flammable vapors.  He suggests that part of the
problem is with the word "empty", which derives from a particular folk model
of objects and materials that unfortunately does not correspond accurately
enough to reality.

I am sure that Whorf is cringing in his grave at the power outage that hit
O'Hare Airport this past Wednesday morning, which is described in a brief
article in the Wall Street Journal:

  Daniel Pearl, A power outage snarls air traffic in Chicago region,
  Wall Street Journal, 15 September 1994, page A4.

It would seem that power was lost for two hours when someone shorted out the
power system for the Aurora air traffic control center while testing the
uninterruptable power supply.

  "There are certainly some additional precautionary measures that
  have to be taken to make sure this doesn't happen again", said Stan
  Rivers, the FAA's deputy associate administrator for airway facilities.

  One precaution, he said, is not to perform the work when air traffic
  is at its peak.  The power outage occurred at 8:45am CDT at the
  Aurora, Ill., facility, which serves traffic to and from the world's
  busiest airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport.

Now, I have no first-hand knowledge of this event, but I do think it is
legitimate to ask what could possibly have possessed someone to mess with the
power supply for O'Hare Airport's traffic control at 8:45 in the morning.  I
would like to suggest that, just maybe, it has to do with the phrase
"uninterruptable power system".  Says the Journal,

  It was the second time this year that the installation of an "uninterruptable
  power system" interrupted power at an air-traffic center.

Granted the first occurrence was more freakish than the second (a falling
ladder a hit "break glass and hit button" button).  But do you suppose that
these things would happen during the morning rush hour, as opposed to 4AM, if
uninterruptable power supplies were called "back-up kludges for highly
sensitive and fragile power supplies"?

Where do hubristic terms like "uninterruptable" come from?  They come from a
very narrow understanding of "the system" -- if the power supply can overcome
those mishaps that can happen within the narrow technical conception of the
system that is found in box-and-arrow type diagrams, then it's
"uninterruptable" so long as the world outside remains totally pure and safe.

And if you don't believe me, I've got an "inherently safe nuclear
reactor" to sell you -- I kid you not!

Dennis Lawrence reported on an ad from TigerDirect, Florida, offering a set of
650 high-quality logos of major corporations.  Logos are copyright by their
owners and in many cases trade marked.  This means that the copyright owner
has sole rights to control who gets copies and who distributes.  If
TigerDirect has the explicit permission of the owners of the logos, all is
well.  If not, then not only they, but anyone else using the logo without
authorization, is breaking the law.  Anyone who would use a logo,
authorization or no, to commit a fraud is also breaking the law.

100 Reasons to Oppose the FBI Wiretap Bill

Reason 55:   The largest purchaser of telecommunications equipment 
             in the federal government said the FBI wiretap plan 
             would have an *adverse impact* on national security.

     In 1992 the General Services Administration wrote that the FBI 
wiretap plan would make it "easier for criminals, terrorists, foreign
intelligence (spies) and computer hackers to electronically penetrate 
the phone network and pry into areas previously not open to snooping."
The confidential memo was obtained as a result of a Freedom of 
Information Act request.

What To Do: Fax Rep. Jack Brooks (202-225-1584).  
Express your concerns about the FBI Wiretap proposal.  

100 Reasons is a project of the Electronic Privacy Information Center 
(EPIC) in Washington, DC.  For more information: <A HREF="mailto:100.Reasons@epic.org">100.Reasons@epic.org</A>.

Reading Peter Ladkin's account of his colleague's address woes brought to mind
an incident that occurred to my friend recently.  He moved and sent an address
correction to a company in which he holds some stock.  The company
acknowledged his change of address, but sent it to his *old* address.  One
wonders if the database update occurred after the letter was generated or if
it never happened.  He has not received any mail since.

  CAFE (Conditional Access for Europe) is an ongoing project in the
  European Community's ESPRIT program. The goal of CAFE is to develop
  innovative systems for conditional access, and in particular,
  digital payment systems. An important aspect of CAFE is high
  security of all parties concerned, with the least possible
  requirements that they are forced to trust other parties (so-called
  multi-party security). This should give legal certainty to everybody
  at all times.  Moreover, both the electronic money issuer and the
  individual users are less dependent on the tamper-resistance of
  devices than in usual digital payment systems. Since CAFE aims at
  the market of small everyday payments that is currently dominated by
  cash, payments are offline, and privacy is an important issue.
     The basic devices used in CAFE are so-called electronic wallets,
  whose outlook is quite similar to pocket calculators or PDAs
  (Personal Digital Assistant). Particular advantages of the
  electronic wallets are that PINs can be entered directly, so that
  fake-terminal attacks are prevented. Other features are:
     * Loss tolerance: If a user loses an electronic wallet, or the
       wallet breaks or is stolen, the user can be given the money
       back, although it is a prepaid payment system.
     * Different currencies.
     * Open architecture and system.
  The aim is to demonstrate a set of the systems developed in one or
  more field trials at the end of the project. Note that these will be
  real hardware systems, suitable for mass production. This paper
  concentrates on the basic techniques used in the CAFE protocols.

We dinosaurs of procedural programming language orientation tend to have
problems with functional programming languages such as Prolog.  It is difficult
to reorganize your thinking into the existential model of the expert systems
programmer.  We have similar problems with object oriented programming.  The
difficulties we have with fuzzy logic are probably for the same reason.  Take
heart, fellow dinosaurs.  At the very least, this book explains *why* we find
fuzzy systems so troublesome.  They are simply expert systems with a better
conceptual grasp of probabilities.
 
The trade media has hyped fuzzy systems as the new and coming thing. 
Information systems professionals, who have lived through a great number of
"coming things" still know little more, basically, than the fact that control
systems are supposed to be better with fuzzy logic, and that close now counts
in both horseshoes and fuzzy systems.
 
The reason for the confidence in this science of imprecision can, in part, be
demonstrated in the control realm.  Suppose you are building an automatic
collision avoidance system for cars.  It is fairly straightforward to program
in the sequence of actions to be taken to slow the car as it approaches another
object.  If, however, the system fails, then what happens if you do hit the
object?  Will the "distance" become a negative number?  If so, will the brakes
bind or release?  Will the drive train stop, accelerate, or go into reverse? 
This situation is simplistic, but the outcome, in a procedural language, must
be accounted for, prepared and tested.  Fuzzy systems deal with ranges, and it
is much easier to see and understand that the concept of "close" should also
include "hit" -- even before you start to build the actions to be taken.
 
The potential disasters associated with systems that would flip planes upside
down when they flew over the equator are not confined to control systems, as IS
professionals are all too well aware.  Financial disasters can be precipitated
by "decision support" software which can generate market crashes.  Similar
damage can be done on a smaller scale by specialized programs which may have
undiscovered, and unintended, assumptions.  As with control systems, working
with ranges may make the pitfalls more obvious than working with static and
sterile values.
 
Even so, it is difficult for the programmer to translate the concepts of fuzzy
logic into code to play with.  Cox has, therefore, given you code to play with. 
A high density MS-DOS format floppy contains C++ source code to mess around
with.  (C programmers should be able to work with most of it, and, since it is
source code, Mac devotees should be able to use it, as well.)
 
For those wishing to explore this new field "hands-on", a slightly high-toned,
but very useful, introduction.

I have attended several presentations from neural net software vendors.  If
these sales pitches are any indications, then neural nets are being used for
just the opposite of the dark purposes Fred Baube fears.

Successful lenders (and insurance companies) are driven by two basic business
rules: avoid "bad" risks and sell more product (increase market size).  Very
broadly applied underwriting rules (don't write mortgages in ZIP codes with
high default rates, don't insure Corvettes driven by young males) support the
first rule but run counter to the second.

There is only so much market share that can be taken from the competition.
What used to be considered a marginal market needs to be reconsidered in order
to fuel the business growth that Wall Street demands.  Many companies are
essentially saying: "on first blush you sound like a bad risk - find me an
excuse to sell to you" - and neural nets help find that excuse (maybe 23 year
old male Corvette drivers who are Ph.D. candidates residing in a rural area
are excellent risks).

The initial "training set" for the neural net may be current underwriting
practices.  This would be the same starting point as a rules-based, inference
engine driven expert system.  Neural nets promise to gain the advantage over
this because more factors can be considered and the "model" is self correcting
based on actual sales results and loss experience.

F. Baube speculates that a neural net might hide an unlawful decision-process.
Two comments on this:

1.  A neural net -- indeed any other machine whether in black box or not --
cannot "be responsible" for actions that break the law.  In Baube's example,
it is the loan officer who makes the declaration that the loan is granted (or
not), not the neural net.  It is on the loan-officer's authority that the loan
is granted; the machine has no authority at all.

2.  It is easy enough to test whether a black box machine (e.g., a neural net)
is breaking the law.  One subjects it to a battery of test cases and sees what
it is advising.  In Baube's example, it would be satistically easy to
determine if there is probable cause to believe the loan officer is engaging
in redlining by relying on the advice of the machine.  Such tests can be
performed even if the "training set" has been lost.

Fred's comments will hold not only of neural nets but of any decision model
trained from data (eg. Bayesian models, decision trees). It's just an instance
of the old "gigo" phenomenon in statistical modeling. It is true that with
neural nets is that they typically have so many parameters that it is
difficult to "blame" a particular parameter setting for particular decisions.
However, proper evaluation of complex statistical models cannot depend on
examining particular parameter values anyway. Instead, evaluation requires the
behavior of the model on held-out test data to be documented, and the test
data to be made available for verification and certification purposes.

If the model has acquired biases from its training data, those should be
inferrable from its performance on its test data or new test sets, and the
original developer should be held responsible for those biases. In the same
way as ignorance of the law is not an excuse for breaking it, bad choice of
training data is not an excuse. For example, if the data comes from the
decisions of human beings (eg. loan officers) on particular cases, a lot of
care must be exercised to ensure that those decisions are not affected by
prejudice or confusion, rather than by examination of outcomes. On the other
hand, if the data is derived from outcomes (eg., for loans, cases that ended
in default vs cases that didn't, for loans with similar terms) and there is
reasonable statistical coverage of all relevant case types, the model
developer may be able to reasonably certify that any hidden correlations that
the system discovers (eg. between location and default rates) are not
demonstrations of intent to discriminate.

Overall, the whole issue of evaluation, let alone certification and legal
standing, of complex statistical models is still very much open. The
traditional machinery of linear or log-linear statistics does not apply
directly to nonlinear models such as neural nets or decision trees, so for
example it is difficult in general to compute model error estimates, and thus
the only source of such estimates is performance on test data. Unfortunately,
these difficulties are often swept under the carpet in the hype that surrounds
neural nets and allied methods.

(This reminds me of a possibly apocryphal story of problems with biased data
in neural net training. Some US defense contractor had supposedly trained a
neural net to find tanks in scenes. The reported performance was excellent,
with even camouflaged tanks mostly hidden in vegetation being spotted.
However, when the net was tested on yet a new set of images supplied by the
client, the net did not do better than chance. After an embarrassing
investigation, it turned out that all the tank images in the original training
and test sets had very different average intensity than the non-tank images,
and thus the net had just learned to discriminate between two image intensity
levels. Does anyone know if this actually happened, is is it just in the
neural net "urban folklore"?)

F. Baube was concerned that a disingenuous bank might use a neural 
network trained to redline loans, and then destroy the training 
materials to hide the intent.

Why would artificial neural networks have this advantage over the biological
ones that banks have used to redline mortgages with for years?  A human loan
officer could be trained with redline-based materials which were later
destroyed.  Human neural nets are also opaque, although they often seem
transparent.

The decision-making process isn't really opaque. The are techniques for
running a standard, feed-forward net "backwards", which will tell you what
types of input are required in order to get the desired output. If you do this
systematically, you can easily evaluate which areas of the input space result
in a certain decision.

Sure, if the training set contained redlining, the net would learn it - but
that's part of the job, isn't it? Any other statistical technique (and in this
case, a net trained by, e.g., backpropagation is just a non-parametric
estimator) would suffer from the exact same problem. In both cases, the
original data of which rules or weights are based could be hidden or
destroyed.

But we already use a neural net for redlining -- the human brain which can
hide all sorts of reasoning and, more likely, alternatives to reasoning. One
of the big issues in red-lining and other areas where social policy meets
business policy is that the argument is often over results and premises. More
to the to the point the same issue occurs when business policy meets business
policy.

The opacity of neural nets reasoning is still an issue. Though, perhaps, more 
of an issue when trying to build systems with reproducible results. In 
general, however opacity can be a result of any complex system.

I remember a case similar to this coming to light in England about 7 years
ago.  It was in relation to a medical school that was using some form of
artificial intelligence program to screen applicants.  One item of data that
was not available to the program was the race of the applicant, which should
have helped ensure a relatively unbiased decision.  However after complaints
and some investigation it was determined that length of last name did have an
effect on the outcome, and it was deemed that it was there because many
students of, among others, Indian descent have significantly longer last names
than the Anglo-Saxon applicants.  So, it seems even this method can be caught,
but obviously requires careful study to determine.

Did you hear about the plug getting pulled in Russia at a major missile site
not too long ago?  Apparently, the folks in charge didn't pay their electric
bill, so the company cut them off...backup generators took over.  One
wonders what happens if they also don't pay their rent...?  :)

It was in The New York Times not too long ago, and in the San Jose Murky News

              The Future of the Internet is Secure!
          On October 11, 1994, The Internet Will Become 
                  A Safe Place To Do Business.

                           Sidewinder:
               Internet Security That Strikes Back

The Internet is a dangerous place. Ask anyone.  

     * Between 85-97% of all computer break-ins go undetected.
     * Industrial espionage is up 400% since the late 1980's. 
     * Hacker attacks increase exponentially.
     * Over 1 million computer break-ins last year alone.
     * Theft of confidential information costs billions to  
       America's financial infrastructure.
     * Privacy is almost nonexistent.

Yet, the Internet is the fastest growing segment of the National Information
Infrastructure.  Over 20 million users and businesses conduct global affairs
on the Internet today, and over 125 million will by the year 2000.

Join us to witness the technological breakthrough in internetworking that
finally makes the Internet a safe place to be.

              The future of the Internet is secure. 
                          Come see how.

Just another horror story:

I called a major airline the other day to make reservations.  In the course of
my dialog with the agent she put me on hold for a minute or so while she
checked something, and I listened to the usual canned music interspersed with
promos for the airline.  Then, after more dialog with the agent, again she put
me on hold... but this time didn't switch on the music.

As I waited, I could clearly make out another reservations agent working in
the background: "yes, Mr. Smith, flight 234 from Portland to San Francisco..."
&lt;more dialog, and then the best part&gt; "thank you, Mr. Smith -- to confirm,
that was a charge of $567.89 to your Mastercard, account number 1234-5..."

I discussed this with my agent when she came back on the line.  She said it
was her mistake (she didn't press the right button or something), and that the
official policy was to switch the line to hold, so as to allow the customer to
hear the promotional ads while waiting.  I pointed out the privacy advantages,
too, and she agreed this was a good thing and promised to be more careful next
time. :-)

The falling ladder problem reminded me of something that happened at a
facility I was working at in Texas a number of years ago. Disaster planning
was taken very seriously and the facility had an emergency diesel generator
*and* backup battery supplies to hold the data center up in case the diesel
was hard to start.

Except for the dump truck that lost control while descending a rise, left the
road and slammed into the adjacent power pole.

The pole broke off at the base and fell onto the generator building, doing
grievous damage to the generator. The broken engine cooling &amp; fuel lines added
to broken water mains to flood the battery room with a noxious mess (the
engine bay had a fuel loss containment system but it was not designed to cope
with a water main). Along the way, the fire control system triggered adding to
the mayhem.

Needless to say, the data center lost power rather suddenly.

Lani Teshima-Miller, writing on Tue, 13 Sep 1994, commented on a computer
crash that led to misprinted ballots.  I'm a member of the Iowa State
Commission on Electronic Voting Machines (actually, the name is longer)
-- we oversee the approval by the state of voting systems.  Anyway ...

Last night, as it happens, I was reading the Federal Election Commission
standards document for electronic voting machinery, and I note that these
standards are generally very well thought out.  There were a few places
where, if anything, they seemed to require excessively expensive solutions
to problems, but few places where they seemed to be open to failures.

The standards mandate considerable fault tolerance in the systems actually
installed in polling places, whether they be mark-sense machines, punched card
machines, or direct recording computerized voting systems.  These have a
serious real-time response requirement -- they must work on election day, all
day.

The standards do not mandate a similar degree of fault-tolerance in
off-line systems, such as those used to prepare ballots.  What they do
mandate is a clear audit trail and strong safeguards against tampering.
In addition, they mandate provisions for many manual checks.  It is in
the latter area where the system in Hawaii clearly failed!

On taking delivery of a shipment of printed ballots, they should have been
inspected -- this means examining a sample ballot from every press run,
preferably from both ends of the run!  (Different press runs may have required
different ballot layouts, for example, by permuting the orders of candidate
names, as required in some contexts).  Furthermore, the workers at the polling
places, at setup time, are required to perform certain inspection tasks, for
example, by assuring themselves that the voting machine counters are all reset
to zero.

The system seems to be designed well; this error in Hawaii seems to be a human
error.  The risk we face is complacency "it's all computerized, these checks
in the system are just bureaucratic requirements, nothing ever goes wrong, so
we can skip this".  One of the fundamental requirements of a democratic system
is a corps of election workers who take the requirements for running an honest
election very seriously!  I cannot imagine any way to use automation to
eliminate this requirement.

After reading Paul T. Keener's comment about a friend's receiving a change of
address acknowledgement from a company that was sent to his *old* address, I
was overcome with deja vu.

Wasn't it here in RISKS that I read about the scam of changing the address
for your credit-card bills so a thief could run up $$$$ without your 
ever knowing about it (until it was too late, that is)? 

I would rather get the info at the old address and then forwarded by the post
office than run the risk of having to correct an "unauthorized" change of
address with the trouble that goes with it.

[...] We had a related problem recently, when the US Post Office decided on
its own to return all our mail with a yellow computer-printed sticker saying
"Addressee moved - no forwarding address".  We only found out when my parents
called up to ask where we had gone.  Of course, our mail box being empty for
several days was definitely suspicious.  Our credit card company thought we'd
absconded, when they got their statement back, and there were other unpleasant
effects.

The P.O. was non-repentant, saying only they had had a new man on the
route.  At least they didn't blame it on the computer.

Well, it's not as crazy as it sound.  Lots of stores use the logos and company
identities of their suppliers in advertising.  E.g. if WalMart sells, say,
Timex watches, their flyer uses the official Timex logo on ads on the watch
page.

Service bureaus can get a substantial amount of work creating good, clean,
accurate electronic versions of such corporate identities for such
advertisers. Once in a while a corporation actually supplies its corporate
identity in electronic form, but so far this is rare. More common is a printed
identity book with specs and samples for several fixed sizes, vertical and
horizontal arrangement, and the Pantone color specs for corporate colors. Also
common is trying to get by working from old output; this makes a lot harder to
get a clean electronic logo.

Heaven help the creative director who starts to get creative with a supplier's
corporate identity. This is greatly frowned upon. The one risk is not knowing
the trade standards. If you display another company's identity, you better
match it 100%.

Peter Denning writes:

&gt; ...  If TigerDirect has the explicit permission of the owners of 
&gt;the logos, all is well.  If not, then not only they, but anyone else using 
&gt;the logo without authorization, is breaking the law.  Anyone who would use 
&gt;a logo, authorization or no, to commit a fraud is also breaking the law.

What Peter says is technically true but ignores the doctrine of "fair use."
I've been a graphic artist for over 25 years.  Throughout that time there have
been clip-art books, either print and lately digital that provide libraries of
such logos for use in authorized situations.  Virtually all such books I am
aware of get their material directly from the trademark owners and therefore
are authorized, but a few have not.

A company certainly may impose and require that their logo not be distributed
within the trade in this manner.  But what does that gain them?  Then they
must supply such clip art to the artist.  In practice, many people authorized
to let advertising or some other use do not have easy access to their
company's style sheets, or simply don't think to provide them.  When the
advertising is created in-house this is not a problem since the art department
always has access to the style sheets, but a great deal of advertising is
created by contractors and specialty houses.

When that happens the artist is reduced to drawing them from memory or
making a fuzzy copy from the yellow pages.  Drawing from memory is usually
unsatisfactory.  The yellow pages are hardly much better.  And I have often
done both in my time.  Inclusion of such logos in a library is usually
considered "fair use" under the copyright law unless the copyright owner
specifically objects to the publisher.  Only the subsequent unauthorized 
reuse of the logo in a specific advertisement or other publication would 
constitute a violation of copyright and/or trademark.  Further, there are
other "fair use" situations that are also excepted, such as news and
personal photography (Amtrak derails! ...accompanied by footage of an
Amtrak emblazoned passenger car on its side... News at 11).

I will reiterate what Peter very rightly points out: anyone using a company's
logo in a fraudulent manner is breaking the law.

It may very well be that the DISTRIBUTION of these logos without the owner's
permission is legal [although USE may not be].  It would take a lawyer to
figure it out (and most likely two lawyers to make a debate on the subject).
In the printing industry we get books of clip art, and some of these books
contain a large number of Logos.  I can't believe that the people putting out
the books really got permission from everyone.  In fact, all of these books
that contain trademarks contain a disclaimer that says in legal gibberish that
you and darn well better have permission from the trademark holder before
using them.

The real risk I see is to the user who may not realize what they need to do 
in order to be legal.  This is another case where technology has brought a 
tool, which in the past required a specialist, directly to the users without 
bringing with it the knowledge of using it properly.

   [This interpretation may indeed violate copyright law.  However, we
   are drifting beyond the scope of RISKS...  PGN]

                   Call For Papers
      8th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Workshop
                   June 13-15, 1995
                 County Kerry, Ireland
         Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society

This workshop series brings together researchers in computer science to
examine foundational issues in computer security.  We are interested both in
papers that describe new results in the theories of computer security and in
papers and panels that explore open questions and raise fundamental concerns
about existing theories.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to: 
   access control       authentication     data and system integrity 
   database security    network security   distributed systems security
   security protocols   security models    formal methods for security
as well as foundational issues relating to other critical system
properties and in emerging areas such as ubiquitous computing.

The proceedings are published by the IEEE Computer Society and will be
available at the workshop.  Selected papers will be invited for
submission to the Journal of Computer Security.

Instructions for Participants: Workshop attendance will be by invitation only
and limited to about 35 participants.  Prospective participants should send 5
copies of a paper (limit 7500 words) or proposal for panel discussion to Li
Gong at the address below.  Please clearly identify the contact author and
provide email addresses and telephone numbers (both voice and fax).

Important Dates: Author's submission:         February 3, 1995
                 Notification of acceptance:  March 14, 1995
                 Camera-ready final papers:   April 3, 1995

Workshop Location: The Computer Security Foundations Workshop is known for its
peaceful rural setting, and in 1995 the workshop will be held at Dromquinna
Manor, County Kerry, which is situated on the South West coast of Ireland.
Built in 1850, and located in quiet picturesque countryside about 3 miles from
Kenmare town, Dromquinna Manor has its own private grounds of woodland and
lawns that sweep down to the sea.  The South West coast of Ireland claims some
of the most varied and spectacular scenery in the country, and the coastline,
sculptured by the ice-age and influenced by the warm waters of the Gulf
Stream, is steeped in ancient history and folklore.  This mountainous area has
an abundance of natural beauty and is enriched by sub-tropical flora produced
by the unusually warm and temperate climate.

The nearest international airports are Shannon and Cork.  There are direct
flights from North America to Shannon and Dublin, and from major European
cities (for example, London and Amsterdam) to Cork.  Connections from many
other cities can be best made by using London or Amsterdam or by availing of
the scheduled services from Dublin to Cork.  There are also car/passenger
ferries from the United Kingdom and Europe to Cork, Dublin and Rosslare.

   _Business Week_ (October 3, 1994) has obtained a tape of two telephone
calls made by an aide to Jimmy Carter on September 18 during negotiations over
Haiti.  The calls were made over an unsecured radio link from Port- au-Prince
to Carter's plane -- one to a National Security Council staff person, and the
other to Carter himself.  Shown transcripts of the calls during a CNN
interview, Carter responded that he was "taken aback", and commented "Now I
see what happened to Prince Charles".

John Sullivan quotes IFE (Federal Electoral Institute) officials who deny
there were problems with the computer system but continues an investigation on
an apparent effort to infiltrate a computer virus into the main computer
system.

In Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten on August 26., the election
is reported as "a great step forward for Mexican democracy" with
a turnout of 75% of the 45 mill. electorate, as compared to the normal 50%.

In a report from Mexico on The Norwegian Broadcasting System (NRK) Radio
Program 2 (P2) on Saturday August 27., Joar Hoel Larsen quotes a professor in
political science at UNAM (?) Louis Javier Garrido who claims that the means
for rigging an election are much more sophisticated now than ever before.
With todays computers and networks one person in the right spot can easily
manipulate a whole election, something which would require an army of election
officials in the earlier primitive systems employed.

Larsen's view was that the Mexicans really wanted to make the election open
and fair this time, and had control rules on election day that bordered on the
paranoid and went a lot further than procedures that are considered quite
acceptable in for instance Norway. So there were few irregularities reported
at the voting stations. Instead, according to professor Garrido, the
manipulation was done at the electorate registry level. 7-8 mill. voters from
districts that were known to have a clear majority in opposition to the ruling
PRI party, were removed from the electorate. Not everybody, but the necessary
percentage from each such district.

The result was a normal turn-out (percentage-wise) and the normal majority in
these districts, but their influence on the totals was reduced. Resulting in
the PRI staying in power. Again according to Garrido, a serious political
independent who is not a member of the loosing PRD, says Larsen.

I have seen reports of complaints on the Mexican election in various media,
but very little mention of this accusation. Has it been reported elsewhere?
Does it have any substance?

Does anybody know what kind of computerized system was used in Mexico this
time, before, during and after the election?  Any Direct Recording Equipment?

What follows is an excerpt of an article that appeared in the 26 Feb 1990
issue of "The New Yorker" magazine.

Specifically, the article is about a suit brought against Acme Company,
incorporated in Delaware, by Wile E. Coyote who lives in the Arizona Desert
and is seeking, "compensation for personal injuries, loss of business income,
and mental suffering caused as a direct result the actions and/or gross
negligence of said company's...  mail-order department..."

The article illustrates the RISKS of operating badly documented and labeled
equipment; the RISKS of using improperly designed equipment, and the RISKS of
using equipment for unintended purposes.

This is a quote from the opening statement of Mr. Coyote's attorney:

   Mr. Coyote states that on December 13th he received of Defendant
   via parcel post one Acme Rocket Sled. The intention of Mr. Coyote
   was to use the Rocket Sled to aid him in pursuit of his prey. Upon
   receipt of the Rocket Sled Mr. Coyote removed it from its wooden
   shipping crate and, sighting his prey in the distance, activated
   the ignition. As Mr. Coyote gripped the handlebars, the Rocket Sled
   accelerated with such sudden and precipitate force as to stretch
   Mr. Coyote's fore-limbs to a length of fifty feet.  Subsequently,
   the rest of Mr. Coyote's body shot forward with a violent jolt,
   causing severe strain to his back and neck and placing him unex-
   pectedly astride the Rocket Sled. Disappearing over the horizon at
   such speed as to leave a diminishing jet trail along his path, the
   Rocket Sled soon brought Mr. Coyote abreast of his prey. At that
   moment the animal he was pursuing veered sharply to the right. 
   Mr. Coyote vigorously attempted to follow this maneuver but was
   unable to do so, due to poorly designed steering and a faulty or
   nonexistent braking system. Shortly thereafter, the unchecked
   progress of the Rocket Sled brought it and Mr. Coyote into
   collision with the side of a mesa.

In another incident, Coyote purchased a pair of rocket skates which, his
attorney claims, Acme sold without sufficient caveat and with "little or no
provision for passenger safety", because the design attached very powerful
jet-engines to "inadequate vehicles"; i.e. the roller-skates.

Other products, manufactured by Acme, that have caused Mr. Coyote great
anguish include: itching-powder, giant kites, Burmese tiger traps, anvils, and
two-hundred-foot-long rubber bands.

RISKS readers are advised to be cautious with products purchased from the Acme
Mail-Order Catalog and especially with explosives purchased from the Acme
Mail-Order Explosives Catalog; the explosives tend to detonate prematurely
very possibly due to the use of faulty primer-cord.

(If ever there was a candidate suitable for the role of RISKS mascot, Wile E.
Coyote is that animal.)

Marc Rotenberg quotes a 1992 GSA report that the FBI's proposals for access
requirements to the telephone system would have an adverse impact on national
security.  He says this speaking for the "100 Reasons ... project of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center [EPIC]".

I haven't read the GSA report in question, but from context and the parts
quoted by Rotenberg, it seems clear that the particular issue concerning GSA
was one feature of the 1992 (1991?) version of the FBI proposal, which called
for the telephone companies to link to a central, government-controlled office
somewhere which would then have the ability to initiate taps anywhere without
any further assistance from the telephone companies.  The GSA was correct in
pointing out that any breach of the security of this centrally controlled sys-
tem could have serious implications.  The GSA was also not alone in pointing
this particular risk.

This year's version of the proposal explicitly states that tapping is to be
done *by telephone company personnel*, on telephone company premises (as is
the case today).  The central tapping facility is gone.

How shall we then classify Reason 55?  A straw man attack?  An appeal to
emotion?  (For many years, "national security" was the standard justification
for almost anything the government wanted to do.  Now EPIC has appropriated
that battle cry.)  Disingenuous?  Dishonest?

At the least, if EPIC is going to quote the GSA's report, honesty requires
that they quote enough context to show what the statement is based on.  If
their going to use an analysis of the 1992 bill, it's incumbent on *them* to
argue that analysis is applicable to the 1994 incarnation, which has undergone
substantial changes - some of them presumably a direct result of the GSA's
analysis.

In any case, proponents can as easily quote an FBI report to the effect that
*not* passing this bill would have an adverse effect on national security.
Why should one prefer the statement of one three-letter government agency over
another?  Duelling appeals to authority do not rational debate make.

There is nothing in the GSA memo that supports Jerry Leichter's
interpretation.  The memo did not even mention the problems associated with
centralized monitoring. Although, it's good of Jerry to bring that up. &lt;grin&gt;

The memo is reprinted in full, along with accompanying materials, in Banisar
and Rotenberg, The Third CPSR Cryptography and Privacy Conference (1993).  The
memo is also available at the CPSR ftp site.  CPSR.ORG
/cpsr/privacy/communications/wiretap/gsa_wiretap_memo.txt

The GSA memo contains at least *ten* Reasons to oppose the wiretap plan
(incompatibility, impact on federal communication networks, scope of proposed
change, powers of Attorney General, national security, network security,
standards, current capability, cost effectiveness, delay in development of new
systems, international trade, associated costs, impact on new services).

We cited only one Reason  -- national security.

A story appeared in *The New York Times* when the memo was obtained (15 Jan
1993, "FBI's Proposal on Wiretaps Draws Criticism from GSA").

Quoting from the NYT article, "the GSA said the proposed legislation was
unnecessary, could hurt the nation's competitiveness in the international
trade arena, and posed a possible danger to national security."

It is *much* more accurate and much more provocative to call the "digital
telephony" bill the "Government Wiretap Bill."

1.  It helps their propaganda and harms our propaganda to call it the "*FBI*
Wiretap Bill."

2.  The FBI Wiretap Bill implies that only the FBI would use its access,
whereas all the phrasing of the versions seems to include a catch-all like,
"... and as otherwise authorized by law."

3.  We need to emphasize that it's the *government* that wants the snoop-n-
peep power.

4.  We need to point out that *all* levels of government can use it, "when
authorized by law," of course.  &lt;sarcasm drips&gt;

5.  We need to emphasize that the public doesn't *know* when wiretaps can
be used, since the classified and secret lawful authorizations are ... well ...
secret.

6.  Most messages about the bill need to cite examples of past abuses of
wiretap authority by those in power, e.g. J. Edgar Hoover as well as Nixon's
Watergate attempt (i.e., he could have pulled it off if his FBI Director had
had "digital telephony" wiretap-at-a-keystroke access as now sought).

7.  We should start calling it "telephonEy."  :-)

In a recent issue of Forbes, Thomas Sowell reports that he's looking forward
to the day when market pressures require universities to distribute a large
proportion of their lectures over video.  The reference is:

  Thomas Sowell, Letting in the light, Forbes, 12 September 1994, page 98.

He anticipates many advantages of this system.  Among them, he says, is that
professors who engage in "propaganda", "pretentious mush", "strident
ideology", and "recruitment of disciples" will be caught on tape and exposed
to public censure.  Sowell is a conservative economist and these are all
obviously code-words for the expression of political views with which
conservatives disagree.  This is to be expected.

But the danger that such proposals represent is independent of your political
views.  Imagine what this new world will be like.  It will become unwise to
engage in unscripted give-and-take with students, lest an ambiguous remark be
placed in a foreign context by someone with video editing equipment and a
political axe to grind.  It will become unwise to express unpopular opinions
in lectures, and even fundamentally conformist lectures will have to be
structured as a series of soundbites, each of which will survive being edited
into arbitrarily unfriendly contexts.  University education, in other words,
will be converted into television -- 500 channels, all alike, and all subject
to the leveling force of external pressure.

These scenarios might seem paranoid, but one perfectly robust model for them
can already be found in journalism.  Substantial institutions have arisen for
harassing journalists whose articles diverge from the political views of those
who care to fund them.  Mistakes are magnified, passages are taken out of
context, and political evaluations are assembled and made available to people
whose cooperation the journalist may require to gather stories.  Of course,
these activities are all perfectly legal and covered by the First Amendment.
But they are regrettable nonetheless.

(Such practices could already be organized in universities simply through
having monitors sit in on classes and forward notes to a central organization.
This is indeed done on a small scale, but video recording would make it much
easier.)

It will be argued (and indeed, Sowell does argue) that the warnings of college
professors like me are just the self-serving obfuscations of interest groups
with something to hide.  But the consequences of such phenomena go far beyond
the university.  When work activities that were formerly conducted
face-to-face start to be mediated on a large scale by digital video and other
computerized telecommunications technologies, unless those communications are
given vastly more statutory protection than seems at all likely, the door will
be opened to greatly intensified monitoring and regulation of those activities
by anyone who has legal access to recordings of the signals.  If this happens,
we will realize how much slack we got from face-to-face interaction, and we
will be forced to look to one another to find ways of getting it back.

A rather humorous thing happened the other day. I was connecting up a scsi
disk to a sparc 10 (nice small power supply) and had powered everything of.
while leaning over the system to connect the various cables to the disk, my
pager went off in vibrate mode.

I wear my pager clipped backwards in my front jeans pocket (so the nice clear
face doesn't get scratched, it mutes the sound of the pager, and gives really
good contact when vibrating) a very tender spot on most people.

when that pager went off I had a flashback to a time when I forgot how much
power is in a sun 4/260 power supply and decided to test it with me as the
path.

both times I have made it across the room before I knew what happened.  From
now on when a system is open, the pager is elsewhere.

Phil Agre &lt;<A HREF="mailto:pagre@weber.ucsd.edu">pagre@weber.ucsd.edu</A>&gt; asked [<A HREF="/Risks/16.41.html">RISKS-16.41</A>] asked (re:
uninterruptable power supplies causing power failures):

&gt; Where do hubristic terms like "uninterruptable" come from? 

They come from marketing people and sales people. Scientists and engineers
often have contempt for these people, but unfortunately their mistakes and
their hubris may lead to an anti-science back-lash.  Therefore we can't just
let them get on with it: it's not the sales people who will get the sack when
a UPS proves to be interruptible; but the whole discipline of electrical
engineering loses a little credibility. So next time an engineer says
something like ``We must not do X because it is very unsafe'', it is possible
that those who have bee mislead by advertisements will say ``Yeah, yeah, what
do you know.''  This is a risk (not of computers, but applying to any
technical discipline).

Phil then added: 
&gt; I've got an "inherently safe nuclear reactor" to sell you

There _is_ a difference between inherent safety and engineered safety.  And
one of the first nuclear reactors _was_ inherently safe. It was in Sweden,
called the Triga, and the opening ceremony (by Niels Bohr) consisted of
removing all the cooling rods from the core. Within a minute, the reactor had
stabilised, rather than starting to melt-down, due to the physical properties
of the materials it was made from. (The damping effect went up exponentially
with increasing temperature.)  My guess is that the reason no reactors are
like this is commercial, i.e. it didn't make as much power per dollar's worth
of uranium, not technical. Another risk when scientists allow people they hold
in contempt to do a job that doesn't interest them; the anti-nuclear power
lobby has good reasons for its views, all due to mistakes made for commercial
reasons. Possible end result: the whole world is condemned to lack of power
when the oil runs out, because nuclear power will still be considered taboo.

All the postings about various incidents in which main power and backup were
both lost serve as examples of a point often missed by risk planners: the
multiplicative probability rule only applies if the events are truly
independent.  A common mode failure can take out several "redundant" systems
at once.

It's extremely difficult to design truly redundant systems.

The O'Hare incident also seems to illustrate another point.  All I know about
this incident is what was posted to RISKS; I gather they were doing some kind
of test on the UPS.

_Chernobyl_ was a disastrous failure triggered by a test of emergency
generation capabilities!  The problem was exacerbated by numerous problems in
design and maintenance, but the trigger event was a misguided test of
generating emergency power from the main turbines as they spun down and the
diesel generators were started up.

A test is an inherently hazardous situation; various common-mode failures can
be triggered by tests.  Therefore one must be especially careful about
scheduling and running tests!

Dave Barry (syndicated humorist) wrote an article a while back about another
similar situation in Russia.  The power to some military complex was shut off
because the bill was not paid, the officer in charge ordered a tank be driven
and parked next to the electric company building.  The business end of the
tank was pointed at the building and miraculously power was quickly restored.

The rest of the article was about the advantages of having a tank in resolving
disputes with creditors and how one acquires the tank.  The latter is done by
sending in all the credit card applications one gets in the mail, acquiring
enough credit and then charging the tank.  When the credit card companies
start demanding payments, it is easy to satisfy them because now you have a
tank.

I am a statistician and I sit on the Human Studies Committee (IRB) of a local
HMO.  I have been assigned as primary reviewer for our committee for a
recently submitted protocol dealing with security issues on the HMO's
computerized patient data base.  (Note: this may not need committee approval
under Federal rules, but it does under local rules.)  I am requesting some
help regarding issues I should be asking about and guidance on literature.

Brief explanation of project: the current computerized medical record has two
sections (I am oversimplifying some issues here, without, I hope, being
misleading): a coded section that can be searched via computer and a text
section that currently cannot be automatically searched.  The HMO has entered
into an agreement with a 'local' university (about 90 miles away) to attempt
to develop tools for exploiting clinical text data (e.g., access, search,
extract, manipulate the text portion of the record).

The process includes providing the university with example records (size of
sample not known), where the records have been 'sanitized'.  "The sanitization
process has three stages:

1. automated masking or identifiers such as addresses and
   telephone numbers in ... extract headers as created [at the HMO]
2. automated masking of medical record numbers
3. automated masking of each segment of each member's name
   everywhere these segments occur in the ... extract"

There are some known problems with this masking (e.g., regarding the
occurrence of names in the record other than than of the particular patient).
My problem is that I have no idea how much faith, trust, etc. to put into the
"automated masking" process.  Of particular help would be guidance on what
questions to ask about this process to help make decisions about whether it is
sufficient (guidance on literature would also be appreciated).

I note also that the people on the project appear to be unaware of the
possibility of identifying patients via combinations of coded information.  As
a statistician, I am aware of some of the large literature on this question,
especially with respect to Census information.  However, I am not familiar
with recent literature on this question or with computer algorithms; further,
I am not aware of any literature dealing specifically with this question for
medical records (except that I do have a copy of the 9/93 publication from the
Office of Technology Assessment entitled _Protecting Privacy in Computerized
Medical Information_; however, this is not a technical publication).

Another question relates to what we should be asking about the security of the
university computer; we have been told that the center "has implemented data
access security by granting electronic access to [HMO] data only to
researchers designated as members of the [HMO] project."  However, we have
been provided with NO details; again, what questions should we be asking and
how do we interpret the responses.

I should mention that our committee very strongly opposes any movement of HMO
data outside the HMO, but in rare circumstances we have agreed when we were
satisfied with the security situation (usually a stand-alone computer in a
room that could easily be locked).

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated and should, preferably, be
sent directly to me at "<A HREF="mailto:richgold@netcom.com">richgold@netcom.com</A>".  If desired, I could post a
summary of the resulting responses to this group.

Brian Randell's posts to early volumes of RISKS about the St. George's medical
school scandal are quite pertinent here.  They are well worth re-reading in
their entirety from the RISKS archives (<A HREF="/Risks/4.27.html">RISKS-4.27</A> and 6.34).  I give only
the highlights here:

"Leading medical schools face an investigation into allegations that they
are discriminating against women and black students.  This follows the
discovery by two consultants that their own school, St. George's in south
London, has been using a computer selection programme which deliberately
down grades applicants if they are female and non-white...

"The St. George's claim is particularly worrying because the school has a
better record on discrimination than most other colleges.  The computer
selection programme was designed to mimic the decisions of the school's
panel which screened applicants to see who merited an interview.  It
matched the panel's results so closely that the panel was scrapped and for
several years all St. george's applicants have been screened by computer...

"St George's was caught, officials admit, only because the attitudes of its
selectors in years gone by were enshrined in a computer program: that program
deliberately downgraded non-Caucasians and women...

"Being non-Caucasian, and or a women, resulted in a lower grade on the
interview scale: simply having a non-European name could take 15 points off
an applicant's score. Sex had less effect: on average, being female took no
more than three points off the score.  That was enough, the Commission
found in its investigation, to deprive 60 candidates a year of the
interviews for which they should have qualified...

"In fact, since the program mimicked the previous human assessors, it is
probable that discrimination occurred before the program was introduced, the
report says...

"In November 1986, Dr Collier discovered, by accident, that the program was
weighted. He wrote to the dean.  Dr West asked Mr Evans to run a few cases
through the program.  When he saw the effect, he immediately stopped its
use."

We understand a handful of RISKS readers wanted to know the sources of some
fascinating data we recently published in a Press Conference announcement.
Here goes.  

The 85-97% figure came from Jim Settle, former Head of the Computer Crime
Squad, FBI.  These are the figures he cited on "Under Scrutiny," an FX channel
(Fox network) TV show where he appeared with Robert Steele of Open Source
Solutions and Chris Goggans, 'national resource hacker.' One government study
he mentioned cites the higher figure of 97% of all computer intrusions go
undetected.  Settle also said that the experience of the FBI Computer Crime
Squad is in excess of 85% computer intrusions go undetected.
 
The million plus computer breakins figure came from USA Research as reported
by Information Week.  The industrial espionage figure is from Parvus and
Assoc. - an international Private Investigation company who specialize in high
tech commercial espionage - and ASIS, American Society for Industrial Security
representing the findings of a study into this area: (The figures are for 1985
through 1991.)

     * Foreign sponsored information theft is up 400% 
     * US sponsored industrial espionage is up 260%
     
According to the Washington Post, as of April 1993, the industrial espionage
case load of the FBI was up a whopping 500%!

The billions of dollars that espionage costs the US econotechnical
infrastructure is well documented in Schwartau's book, "Information Warfare:
Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway," available anywhere. Take a read.

We hope this settles any misunderstandings on the part of RISKS readers.

&gt;... according to professor Garrido, the manipulation was done at the 
&gt;electorate registry level. 7-8 mill. voters from districts that were known 
&gt;to have a clear majority in opposition to the ruling PRI party, were removed
&gt;from the electorate. ...

This technique is known as "shaving" the voter's list. It is one of many
techniques allegedly used by the ruling party to rig the elections.  How many
voters were shaved is anybody's guess. Estimates have ranged from 2-4% to 25%.

On the eight million figure, the minister of the interior declared:

  Luckily they [the PRD] came up with a ridiculous large figure for
  shaved voters. This places their claims in the realm of the absurd.

It should be said that the minister of the Interior, which is in charge
of the election procedure, is a noted academic known for his political
independence and does not belong to the ruling party.

&gt;I have seen reports of complaints on the Mexican election in various media,
&gt;but very little mention of this accusation. Has it been reported elsewhere?

The Wall Street Journal and/or the Washington Post explained several
known schemes for rigging the election, including shaving, the "taco"
(a roll or premarked electoral ballots inserted by a voter), and
the "carousel" (voters go around and around voting time and time again).

&gt;Does it have any substance?

The eight million figure certainly not. 

Were there some shaved voters?  Yes.

How many?  According to audits commissioned by the government and performed by
independent national and internacional firms, about 2-4% of the voters had
taken the steps to register but did not appear in the lists.

It is _not_ known how many of those are due to administrative errors (such as
entering and incorrect address and having the voter appear in an incorrect
voting station) and how many are intentional.

&gt;Does anybody know what kind of computerized system was used in Mexico this
&gt;time, before, during and after the election?  

There are no systems used during the election. All the voting is a manual
process done in see-through ballot boxes (to avoid pre-stuffing them with
votes).

After the election, a series of Tandem systems were used. The government has
refused to make details specific, according to "security considerations".
From declarations by election officials, it seems that the central system is
connected to computers in each state and that elections results were
transferred electronically, and later verified manually.

My note about uninterruptable power supplies in <A HREF="/Risks/16.41.html">RISKS-16.41</A> brought quite a
bit of interesting correspondence.  Most of it asserted (with no more evidence
than I presented in my own note) that phrases like "uninterruptable power
systems" come from sales and marketing people.  This might be, but it doesn't
explain why technical people go along with them.  They must accept that it's
reasonable to call something "uninterruptable" if it prevents one particular
failure mode, regardless of any others.  This would be like calling a child's
toy "unbreakable" if it cannot be broken by being chewed on, even though it
shatters into long, sharp needles when used to pry something open.  The point
is not to discredit electrical engineering, which brings many benefits to
society, but simply to encourage broader systems thinking and more rigorous
truth in labeling.

The same thing goes for "inherently safe nuclear reactors".  I'm sure that
such reactors can pass coolant-loss tests, but that's only one of the many
dangers from nuclear power.  This probably isn't the place to argue the merits
of nuclear power in general, but I do think that the analogy between these two
cases of misleading terminology is strong.  In each case, absolute statements
are made based on the defeat of single failure modes that can be represented
within a narrowly technical definition of the system's operation.

&gt; ...  Substantial institutions have arisen for
&gt;harassing journalists whose articles diverge from the political views of those
&gt;who care to fund them.  ...

Anyone with even a passing acquaintance with universities realizes that
this already happens internally at universities.  Even at the Graduate
School of Business at Stanford, there is a problem with at least the
perception of a "party line" over which it is not safe to step (regularly
bemoaned in the school newspaper, in case anyone cares to check).

At the most, video of university lecture just enlarges the group that
decides, through whatever mechanism, what is the "party line".  It's
not clear that one group's decision is any better than another's.

In fact I have serious doubts about two parts of Agre's scenario:

1) That many lectures will in fact be found interesting (or lucrative)
enough to bother broadcasting, outside of technical subjects like EE,
which are not subject to these kinds of controversy.  Face it, a heck
of a lot of stuff that goes on at a university is just plain boring to
the vast majority of folks.

2) In the event that any "radical" is caught in such a thing as the above,
s/he is more likely to be delighted by the attention.  Supposing the
professor has tenure (and few professors stick out their necks before
achieving this status) s/he is is perfectly safe from retribution, and
is more likely to leverage their new-found notoriety, a la Rush Limbaugh.
Imagine, everyone tuning into your lecture every week to hear your latest
pronouncements.  It's every professor's dream.

A new media star is born, the University makes a bundle selling off the
lecture broadcasts to HBO, and everyone goes home happy.

Peter Denning suggested that we could test away the uncertainty with
neural networks, however, doing a complete test is infeasible for all
but the simplest systems, and not doing a complete test leaves the
possibility that an unlikely (i.e., low enough probability that it was
not worth testing) chain of events will cause catastrophic results.
Recent research has shown that even the best tested systems fail under
the combination of only two unlikely events a lot of the time.  In a
random world, this is perhaps good enough, but in a world with malicious
attackers, testing neural networks will simply not do.

I'm not sure how safe it is to assume that an acknowledgement mailed to the
old address will be forwarded; I for one am seriously considering *not*
notifying the Post Office the next time I move, since filling out one of their
change-of-address forms automatically gets you lots of new junk mail.

Assume for privacy sake one will want to move _without_ leaving a forwarding
address, and notify all that one does business with about the new address.  
In that case the practice to send the acknowledgement to the old address will
backfire. And of course, try to tell that to the companies you do business
with, when their computers are programmed that way.

Forwarding by US Mail does create serious privacy issues.  I hear that the
Post Office stopped/will stop giving the new address to anyone. That's good.
But the PO will give your address to anyone who sends you a letter after one
year but before the record expires; the letter is sent back to sender with a
big yellow sticker with your new address on it...

Six months or so ago, my father went to the post office to put a temporary
hold on his mail because he was going on vacation, and the clerk he spoke to
said something to the effect of, "Now, when you say on this form that you want
your mail to start being delivered on date &lt;x&gt;, you really mean that you want
it to start being forwarded to your new address, right?"

Puzzled, my father responded, "What new address?"

The clerk responded, "The address you sent us on your change-of-address card."

My father hadn't sent in a change-of-address card.  Subsequent investigation
(and a number of interviews with the postmaster at that post office) revealed
that someone had sent a fraudulent change-of-address card in my parents' name
to the post office, forwarding their mail to a non-existent address in
California.  The card was sent from another state.  it seems unlikely that
whoever sent it will ever be caught.

Fortunately, the deception was detected before they started forwarding the
mail, because of the coincidence of the timing of my father's visit to the
post office.  If he hadn't gone in to put a hold on his mail, the post office
would have happily started forwarding it with no questions asked.

Obviously, the problem here is that there was no authentication whatsoever of
the change of address.  Admittedly, the post office does send a
change-of-address kit to anyone who files a card, but if the card asks for the
forwarding to begin immediately, it will start happening quite a while before
the kit arrives.  And the kit will be forwarded to the new address, which
doesn't do much good if it's a fake!

Even something simple like delivering a confirmation card to any address that
requests a change of address, and requiring that it be filled out and returned
before processing the change, would be a huge improvement over the current
system.  Who knows why the post office doesn't do this.

The California Legislature recently passed a bill forbidding prison inmates
from changing their names without the permission of the prison warden.  It
seems that a "resident" of Pelican Bay state pen, reputedly the state's
toughest prison, changed his name to that of the ex-husband of a woman who
had accused him of molesting her daughter.  The fellow succeeding in changing
this woman's postal address to his prison address so he could read all her
mail, and I believe he even obtained her credit record!

This went on despite her complaints until the San Francisco Chronicle ran
a full page article detailing this fellow's activities.

Apparently the prison had tried to punish him further, but they could not stop
him from sending mail.  Now mail from California prisons is stamped with the
name of the prison so that the recipient can get a clue to be suspicious.

Depending on such a feature can be a RISK, since Canada Post treats
such a service as an additional-cost item. It is purchased ahead of time,
and for a certain period of service. If the addressee is not aware that
a change of address notification will be mailed to the old address, they
may not bother purchasing the service.

Of course, during a recent move, the "guy in charge of putting the 
stickers on the P.O. boxes didn't trust his stand-in, so he didn't leave 
instructions to do it" -- and we had no mail forwarded for 10 days.

An additional RISK? Beware of internal processes that extract an address and
*use* it two months later! A recent, automatic credit-card replacement didn't
get to us because (1) it depended on an address taken from the database 2
weeks before we moved, but not used until 6 weeks *after* we moved, and (2)
for security, it was sent via a courier -- who does not have access to the
mail-forward info, even if you *have* purchased the service.

[...]  By sending the confirmation to the *old* address, it warns the person
who owns the stock that their address is being changed, *in the event the
change is fraudulent*.  If that confirmation is sent with a signature required
and a do not forward order on it, it provides excellent protection to the
original owner that the change of address is not fraudulent.

Realize that for most stock, ownership includes certain benefits including
right to vote at the stockholders meeting, and something important to a lot of
people, dividend checks.

Because of laws on the right of stockholders to submit candidates for the
board of directors, just about anyone, and certainly anyone who owns even one
share of stock in the company, has the right to obtain a list of every
stockholder in the company including their name and address (in order to
solicit them to support a new board of directors and to solicit them for
proxies for their vote).  This was common practice for doing a hostile or
friendly takeover before Michael Milken got the idea of selling bonds and
buying a company instead of simply getting the owners of a company to fire the
board of directors via proxy fights.

Now imagine what happens if someone decides to get the list of stockholders
and sends in fake change of address requests during the week just before the
dividend checks are issued, for the top five largest individual stockholders.
If the acknowledgement of change of address is sent to the new address, the
stockholder would never know that someone had changed their address.  Who pays
for it if someone then forges the signature of the recipients and cashes
thousands or tens of thousands of dollars in dividend checks?

Douglas Adams, author of Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, created a computer

a change of address card. (They insisted you inform them of changes of address
on an official form, which they were happy to send to the old address.) At one
stage you had to get a green form in order to get a red form, but in order to

People embroiled in the debate over anonymity on the networks might want to
check out an article entitled "Reuter's Instinet is Biting Off Chunks of
Nasdaq's Territory" in October 4th edition of the Wall Street Journal (p. C1).

The article doesn't deal directly with anonymity-- it just charts the success
of Reuter's Instinet, a computer network that matches up buyers and sellers of
large blocks of stock. The article mentions that many clients selling large
blocks of stock turn to the Instinet because it is anonymous. It's main
competitors are not. It reads, "Large investors, who wish to keep their long
or short positions confidential, especially want to avoid tipping other
investors off about their bets in the volatile, mostly small-capitalization
over-the-counter market."

Ideally, this feature allows the market to be more efficient and more fair.
People who just happen to be selling, say, Apple Computer Company stock to
say, Motorola, won't be able to use their casually acquired knowledge. (Just a
hypothetical example.) Another chance for "insider" like trading is gone.

This anonymity, though, is almost certainly not absolute. The SEC would
probably be able to unwind the trades if they needed to do so. But I'm just
guessing about this.

Front page news in "Computing", 6 October 1994:

Headline:   ICL loses 1.3m pounds poll tax case

In a landmark award, St Albans City Council has won a 1.3m pounds High Court
judgement against ICL for supplying flawed poll tax software, precipitating a
flood of similar claims against the supplier.  Monday's judgement has
industry-wide implications because the judge in the case, Mr Justice Scott
Baker, ruled that a clause in ICL's standard contract limiting the supplier's
liability if problems arose did not apply under the Unfair Contract Terms Act
1977.

Notes:

1. "Computing" is a UK computing industry weekly newspaper.
2. ICL is a Japanese owned UK based computer company.
3. 1.3m UK pounds is approximately $2 US million.
4. The "poll tax" was the abortive uniform local tax on individuals
   introduced by the Conservative government under Mrs Thatcher,
   but now replaced due to public resistance.

On the front page of the buiness section of the San Jose Mercury today (5 Oct
1994) is an article describing one of the most egregious privacy violations I
have heard of.  America Online, described in the article as the fastest
growing on-line service providers, has or appears to be ready to peddle
subscriber information.  The kind of information by AOL collected upon sign up
is (IMHO) excessive.  My wife signed up and I nearly told her to find another
service provider and if she had known about the possibility that the info
would be sold I am sure that she would have not signed up.

According to the article the information which might be included in the sale
of AOL subscriber info includes: "...name, gender, address, income, family,
type of computer equipment, and payments to the company." 

My hope is that other subscribers will rise up in anger and convince AOL that
this invasion of their privacy will cost them more $$$ in lost subscribers
than they can hope to gain via the sale of the info.

The German daily newspaper "Tagespiegel" notes this past weekend that for any
set of twins (or triplets, etc.), in Brazil, only one may register to vote for
the upcoming election.  Seems the unique key for the voter registration form
consists of the names of the parents and the birthdate. It was noted that the
problem could not be corrected in time for the election, presumably there will
a number of people contesting the election.

"Watchdog", a consumer affairs television program shown on the BBC, Monday
26th September, reported on the experiences of a customer of Dixons (a
computer and other electrical goods retailer).  The customer had bought a PC
from them, and had used it extensively, writing letters, doing business and
accounts and so on.  The PC started to malfunction, the symptoms being wrong
characters generated by the keyboard. For example, "w" translated to an "f"
and so on.

Dixons said that they couldn't fix it, but would charge UKP 250 for an upgrade
to a new machine. The customer agreed to this, and told them, before he gave
the computer back, that he had confidential information stored on it, and
would they remove it for him. Dixons agreed to this.  6 months later, he
received a phone call from a family who had purchased his old computer from
Dixons, saying that they had found his data still on the computer.

RISKS: Obviously, the retention of the data is a large risk. But in
addition, I think there are several others. Most obvious is the fact
that the customer, while storing important information on the machine
had made no efforts to make it secure. The situation could have been
much worse if the computer had been stolen, or if his children had
access to the data to change it.

Other risks include believing what the retailer tells you. We weren't
told any more technical information about the problem with the machine,
but it looked very much as though either the keyboard was faulty, or,
more likely, that one of the keyboard drivers had become corrupted.
Certainly not something that should UKP 250 to fix.

Also, the second owners of the machine believed that what they were
getting was brand new, with the caveat that it had been used a display 
machine. Obviously, it wasn't. But even if it had been a display machine, 
it should be a trivial matter to walk into one of the stores and put a
virus on many of the machines available. This could cause havoc for
first time buyers.

Periodically I remind you of TWO useful digests related to privacy, both of
which are siphoning off some of the material that would otherwise appear in
RISKS, but which should be read by those of you vitally interested in privacy
problems.  RISKS continues to carry general discussions in which risks to
privacy are a concern.  The most recent issues of PFD and CPD include
extensive material on the newly passed Digital Telephony Bill that now awaits
Presidential signature.  Because the of the extraordinary volume of that
material, we do not attempt to cover the issues here.  If you are seriously
interested in the discussions on privacy, I recommend you try BOTH digests for
a while (free trial subscriptions are terrific, but especially when the
long-term subscriptions are also free AND, perhaps more important, you don't
wind up on anyone ELSE's mailing list!).

* The PRIVACY Forum Digest (PFD) is run by Lauren Weinstein.  He manages it as
  a rather selectively moderated digest, somewhat akin to RISKS; it spans the
  full range of both technological and non-technological privacy-related issues
  (with an emphasis on the former).  For information regarding the PRIVACY
  Forum, please send the exact line:

information privacy

  as the BODY of a message to "<A HREF="mailto:privacy-request@vortex.com">privacy-request@vortex.com</A>"; you will receive
  a response from an automated listserv system.  To submit contributions,
  send to "<A HREF="mailto:privacy@vortex.com">privacy@vortex.com</A>".

* The Computer PRIVACY Digest (CPD) (formerly the Telecom Privacy digest) is
  run by Leonard P. Levine.  It is gatewayed to the USENET newsgroup
  comp.society.privacy.  It is a relatively open (i.e., less tightly moderated)
  forum, and was established to provide a forum for discussion on the
  effect of technology on privacy.  All too often technology is way ahead of
  the law and society as it presents us with new devices and applications.
  Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.  Submissions should go to
  <A HREF="mailto:comp-privacy@uwm.edu">comp-privacy@uwm.edu</A> and administrative requests to
  <A HREF="mailto:comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu">comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu</A>.

There is clearly much potential for overlap between the two digests, although
contributions tend not to appear in both places.  If you are very short of time
and can scan only one, you might want to try the former.  If you are interested
in ongoing detailed discussions, try the latter.  Otherwise, it may well be
appropriate for you to read both, depending on the strength of your interests
and time available.

                  Call for Participation - CFP'95
     The Fifth Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy
Sponsored by the ACM SIGCOMM, SIGCAS, SIGSAC and Stanford Law School
                       28 - 31 March 1995
    San Francisco Airport Marriott Hotel, Burlingame, California

INVITATION
This is an invitation to submit session and topic proposals for 
inclusion in the program of the Fifth Conference on Computers, Freedom 
and Privacy. Proposals may be for individual talks, panel discussions, 
debates, or other presentations in appropriate formats. Proposed topics 
should be within the general scope of the conference, as outlined below.

SCOPE
The advance of computer and telecommunications technologies holds great 
promise for individuals and society. From convenience for consumers and 
efficiency in commerce to improved public health and safety and 
increased participation in democratic institutions, these technologies 
can fundamentally transform our lives. New computer and 
telecommunications technologies are bringing new meanings to our 
freedoms to speak, associate, be left alone, learn, and exercise 
political power.

At the same time these technologies pose threats to the ideals of a 
just, free, and open society. Personal privacy is increasingly at risk 
from invasion by high-tech surveillance and eavesdropping. The myriad 
databases containing personal information maintained in the public and 
private sectors expose private life to constant scrutiny. Political, 
social, and economic fairness may hinge on ensuring equal access to 
these technologies, but how, at what cost, and who will pay? 

Technological advances also enable new forms of illegal activity, posing 
new problems for legal and law enforcement officials and challenging the 
very definitions of crime and civil liberties. But technologies used to 
combat these crimes can threaten the traditional barriers between the 
individual and the state.

Even such fundamental notions as speech, assembly and property are being 
transformed by these technologies, throwing into question the basic 
Constitutional protections that have guarded them. Similarly, 
information knows no borders; as the scope of economies becomes global 
and as networked communities transcend international boundaries, ways 
must be found to reconcile competing political, social, and economic 
interests in the digital domain.

The Fifth Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy will assemble 
experts, advocates and interested people from a broad spectrum of 
disciplines and backgrounds in a balanced public forum to explore and 
better understand how computer and telecommunications technologies are 
affecting freedom and privacy in society. Participants will include 
people from the fields of computer science, law, business, research, 
information, library science, health, public policy, government, law 
enforcement, public advocacy, and many others. 

Topics covered in previous CFP conferences include:

Personal Information and Privacy
Access to Government Information
Computers in the Workplace
Electronic Speech, Press and Assembly
Governance of Cyberspace
Role of Libraries on the Information Superhighway
Law Enforcement and Civil Liberties
Privacy and Cryptography
Free Speech and the Public Communications Network

We are also actively seeking proposals with respect to other possible 
topics on the general subject of computers, freedom and privacy. Some 
new topics we are considering include:

Telecommuting: Liberation or Exploitation?
Courtesy, and the Freedom to be Obnoxious
Commercial Life on the Net
How Does the Net Threaten Government Power?
Universal Access to Network Services
The Meaning of Freedom in the Computer Age
Online Interaction and Communities
Government-Mandated Databases

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION
All proposals should be accompanied by a position statement of at least 
one page, describing the proposed topic. Proposals for panel 
discussions, debates and other multi-person presentations should include 
a list of proposed participants and session chair. Proposals should be 
sent to:

with the word RProposalS in the subject line. Proposals should be 
submitted as soon as possible to allow thorough consideration for 
inclusion in the formal program. The deadline for submissions is 
1 November 1994.

STUDENT PAPER COMPETITION

sent via airmail).  The title page should contain the title, the name of the
authors, their phone and fax numbers, their postal and e-mail address and the
abstract.  The extended abstract should start with the title and the abstract,
but should be anonymous (Please, reserve the acknowledgments for the final 
version of the paper).  This should be followed by a succinct statement 
appropriate for a non-specialist reader specifying the subject addressed, 
its background, the main achievements, and their significance to cryptology.  
Technical details directed to the specialist should then follow.  A limit of 
10 single-spaced pages of 12pt type (not counting the bibliography and clearly
marked appendices) is placed on all submissions.  Since referees are not 
required to read the appendices, the paper should be intelligible without them.

Abstracts that have been or will be submitted in parallel to other conferences
or workshops that have proceedings are not eligible for submission to 
Eurocrypt.  The authors must state compliance to this rule in their cover 
letter.  A LaTex style file and an example of a cover letter will be available.

Conference proceedings 
Eurocrypt '95 will be the first Eurocrypt conference where proceedings will be
available at the meeting.  The proceedings will be published in the 
Springer-Verlag's  Lecture Notes in Computer Science.  Clear instructions 
about the final copy will be sent to the authors.  The final copies of the 
accepted papers will be due on March 6, 1995.  Authors of accepted papers 
must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference.

A limited number of stipends are available to those unable to obtain funding 
to attend the conference.  Students whose papers are accepted and who will 
present themselves are encouraged to apply if such an assistance is needed.  
Requests for stipends should be addressed to the general chairperson.

* I have been travelling extensively for the past few weeks (National
  Computer Security Conference, AAAS/ABA Conference on Computers,
  Ethics and the Law, National Research Council crypto study, etc.) and 
  have had neither much net access and nor much free time.

* I returned to find my monitor fried as a result of the FOURTH recorded 
  squirrelcide at SRI --- which brought down the entire institute last
  Wednesday (for something like eight hours) and created all sorts of internal
  power surges, despite the isolation supposedly provided by our cogeneration
  plant hookup.  [I presume this squirrel got turned into rodental floss.]

By the way, the RISKS book (Computer-Related Risks, ACM Press and
Addison-Wesley) is finally available.  I thank all of you whose contributions
to RISKS are noted therein.

&gt;From The Straits Times, 13 Oct 94:

A bug in a newly-installed computer software knocked out two-thirds of 
Singapore's telephone lines late yesterday morning.  Handphones, fax 
machines, pagers and credit cards were all hit by the disruption which 
began at 11.31am in the City Exchange.  It took Singapore Telecom's 
engineers about five hours to get services back to normal again.

At a press conference last night, Brig-Gen Lee Hsien Yang, its deputy 
president and executive vice-president for local services, said the 
disruption hit 65 per cent of the lines.  Subscribers on the remaining 35 
per cent of the lines had trouble putting calls through.

The problem started when a software bug corrupted one of the two common 
channel signalling systems.  These systems link the different exchanges.  
The problem soon spread to all but two of the 28 exchanges.  Only the Ama 
Keng and Pasir Ris exchanges were not affected.  When Telecom engineers 
shut down the affected channel, this caused the other to overload.

Big-Gen Lee said the new and the older systems run side by side and serve 
as mutual back-ups.  If there were only one system, then the whole 
island's telecommunications network would have been crippled.

Clinton L. Watson, 44, was arrested on 18 Oct 1994, along with his son and a
family friend, and charged in San Jose, California, with three counts of wire
fraud and grand theft, with a possible prison sentence of 30 to 45 years.
Watson allegedly altered and sold more than 1000 cellular phones with
illegally acquired identifiers, whose use resulted in millions of dollars of
phone calls being billed to unsuspecting persons.  Legitimate cellular-phone
identification numbers were allegedly captured using scanners, and entered
into identity-reprogrammable clone phones that were fabricated from new
programmable chips --- which permitted the original identity numbers to be
replaced, and the new purloined identifiers to be easily replaced at future
times when they were disabled because of detected misuse.  (The Secret Service
noted that Watson is currently on probation from a 1988 conviction on 14
counts of wire and mail fraud in Missouri.)  [Source: Article by Maria Alicia

Client-Server Gamble Pays Off for Barclays, by Tony Collins

Barclays Bank this week went live with the UK's largest client-server system
in spite of internal documents warning of the "high-risks" of its Big Bang
approach.  Without any announcements to the public about the project, the bank
stopped up to 10,000 end-users accessing the bank's main customer systems for
the whole of Friday and Saturday morning.  And while end-users reverted to
manual procedures, the IT staff commandeered the bank's mainframes to build a
new database holding 25 million customer accounts ready to go live on Monday
morning.  More than 1,200 IBM RS/6000 servers had already been installed in
branches ready to link up with the new database.

Barclays refuses to disclose the cost of the project, but it is believed to
have invested fllOm in customer-based systems.  Andersen Consulting, which has
had an average of 50 consultants managing and helping to develop the new
system, was warned by the bank that it would not be paid - and may never work
for Barclays again - if the systems did not go live.  But by noon on Monday
about 800 of the 1,000 branches planned for that time had gone live. The
remainder had local problems configuring their RS/6000 systems, running the
Ingres database, to interface with the new IBM DB2 mainframe database.  Later
on Monday, nearly 1,100 branches had gone live, leaving only about 12 branches
with residual hardware and configuration problems.

The pioneering project's success vindicates the "Big Bang" approach for major
client-server systems, and may lead to other major users being more
forthcoming with similarly large implementations.  But Barclays briefing
documents issued before Monday had warned of the risks of opting for a Big
Bang rather than region-by-region implementation.  "It is a massive
undertaking but we have to use this [Big Bang] approach .  . . since to create
one master database we cannot have existing systems running concurrently,"
said one briefing document.

The new customer system, the biggest IT project in the bank's history,
replaces three incompatible databases - which previously covered customer
accounts, Barclaycard and financial products - with a single database.  Bill
Gordon, managing director of the banking division, said the new database
replaces "current systems and practices that have hampered our ability to
serve the customer".  The new system will allow bank staff to see customer
transfer files and approve or reject a new account within 30 minutes and will
use a computerised credit scoring to give an almost instant "Yes" or "No" on
loan and overdraft requests. Customer records will no longer be "owned" by a
particular branch or manager but by the bank as a whole.

I laughed when I heard this on the news about a month ago:

There's this relatively well known writer in here in Iceland named Thrainn
Bertelsson. He was working on a script for a movie that is supposed to be shot
sometime soon. Then somebody goes ahead and breaks into his office, taking
care not to forget the computer on the way out; nothing else was stolen. Now
the writer realizes that, not only does someone have his script, but that
someone has the *only* copy of it in the world. The man hadn't made a backup
from day one!

It's sad, I guess, especially when you consider that the guy was desperate
enough to immediately offer hard cash for the data and sent out a plea to the
perpetrator. It looks like he was listening because he gave the computer back.
...after wiping the entire hard disk. And that's Government wipe, not
overwrite once!

I haven't heard any more, I guess Thrainn is busy rewriting his little
script now. I don't know if I should laugh or cry.

In Manga Mania (Nov 94):

Thieves broke into a London finance firm recently and stole all of the memory
chips from the firm's computers - over UK#5000's worth! That night, three
other outfits also lost their memory to the same gang. The week before,
another London company was hit, and replaced its chips only to be hit again
three days later.  Unlike banknotes, chips have no serial numbers and are
almost impossible to identify.

Jack Decker (<A HREF="mailto:ao944@yfn.ysu.edu">ao944@yfn.ysu.edu</A>) posted this to alt.dcom.telecom
and comp.dcom.telecom.tech:

  So tonight I get a call from my friend who sells beepers.  He just
  opened up a store on Thursday, and let's just say that there were
  still a few holes in his security.  Anyway, a couple of kids decided
  to each grab a beeper and make off with it.
  
  Now, my friend's beepers are all pre-activated, which means that if you
  buy one, you walk away from the store with a working beeper that you
  can start using immediately.  And these beepers were indeed activated.
  
  So when my friend gets back to his office, he starts to wonder if there
  isn't some way to get his beepers back.  And then he remembers... he has
  an 800 number that's provided by a company called Arch Telecom.  And
  Arch captures the ANI (Automatic Number Identification) of the calling
  party on all 800 number calls.  So he dials up the "missing" beepers and
  punches in his 800 number as the callback number.
  
  And believe it or not, the thieves CALLED HIM BACK!  Both of them!  And
  of course when he got the calls, he informed the kids that he now had
  their home phone number and it just might be a good idea if they stopped
  by his store tomorrow and either returned the pagers or paid for them!
  
  And THEN, he called the Arch Telecom customer service office (this was
  on a Sunday, mind you) and they looked up the ANI of the calls he'd just
  received.  He called the numbers back and got the PARENTS on the phone,
  and had a little chat with them as well.
  
  He told me that if by some odd chance the kids don't return his pagers
  first thing tomorrow, he'll take further action, but he really expects
  to see his pagers come back to him tomorrow.
  
  I figure that anyone who steals a beeper is pretty stupid anyway, since
  they are pretty useless if you're not paying for the paging service (and
  you can bet that if my friend hadn't received those calls, those beepers
  would have been deactivated tomorrow!) but to steal a beeper and then
  start calling numbers that appear on it... well, I'll bet those boys
  learned a little lesson about the capabilities of modern telephone
  technology (then again, maybe they still haven't figured it out... thieves
  generally aren't all that bright to start with!).
  
  I just thought it was funny that those kids would be dumb enough to call
  an unknown 800 number that appeared on a pager they had just stolen.  I'm
  sure that there have been dumber thieves, but these two sound like they
  might have half a brain between them!  :-)
  
  If you, too, find this amusing, feel free to cross-post it to any
  appropriate newsgroup if you like (e.g. rec.humor.* - I only posted this
  to the telecom groups) but please keep the whole thing including my .sig
  file intact.

There were several followups, including one by Stephan Piel

had also been stolen.  The police called the pager, and sure enough...

And Dale Farmer (<A HREF="mailto:dalef@bu.edu">dalef@bu.edu</A>) wrote about an acquaintance whose job
involves lending out pagers for things like trade shows.  These go
missing often enough that he has developed a repertoire of messages
to send when it happens.  Dale quoted three:

  "This pager has been deactivated, please return it to [address]"
  "Stolen pager tracing activated"
  "Pager tracing successful, located in [city]"

Calling-Number ID (abbreviated CNID [and sometimes misnamed Caller ID]) is a
technology that enables your telephone to digitally send its phone number to
the telephone of anybody you call.  Controversy about privacy issues in CNID
has swirled for years.  The NYT has an article on the subject:

  Matthew L. Wald, A privacy debate over Caller ID plan, *The New York Times*,
  13 October 1994.

The United States Federal Communications Commission recently proposed rules,
due to go into effect in April, to create uniform CNID protocols across state
lines.  While the FCC plan does protect privacy in some ways, e.g., preventing
a business that captures your phone number from selling it to others without
your permission, it does not mandate per-line blocking, which is necessary if
you never want to send out your phone number, or if you only want to send it
out when you enter a special code.

The article states clearly that the real reason for CNID is commercial.
Privacy advocates have been saying this for years, and for a long time they
have gotten patronizing lectures about how CNID is for residential use in
catching harassing phone callers.  But CNID is a poor way to catch harassing
phone callers.  Moreover, that single application wouldn't nearly make CNID
profitable.  The point is that CNID is a good way to let companies collect
marketing information and automate service interactions.

Which is fine.  Hardly anybody opposes CNID outright.  But in order for CNID
to avoid inadvertently giving away the phone number of someone who is being
stalked, or who otherwise needs to keep their number a secret, it needs a few
simple features:

 * per-line blocking -- a simple, no-cost way to declare that this telephone
   should not send out its number when dialling

 * per-line unblocking -- a simple, no-cost way to declare that this telephone
   now *should* send out its number when dialling

 * per-call blocking -- a simple, no-cost way to declare that, regardless of
   whether this line is blocked, this particular call should not include the
   calling number

 * per-call unblocking -- a simple, no-cost way to declare that, regardless
   of whether this line is blocked, this particular call *should* include the
   calling number

In order for people to get the benefit of these commands, some further rules
are needed:

 * All four of these commands should be entered with *different* codes.

 * Most especially, the blocking and unblocking commands should not be
   implemented with toggle commands (for example, *67 blocks the line and
   then another *67 unblocks it -- or, wait!, did the first *67 unblock
   the line so that the next *67 blocked it?).

 * All of these commands (or at least the per-call ones) should take effect
   instantly, without requiring a pause before dialling a number, so that
   phone numbers stored in modems can include the codes.

 * All of the commands should be standardized everywhere.

 * All of the commands should be clearly and concisely explained in some
   convenient place in the phone book.  If at all possible, the commands
   should be listed on a simple cue card that can be attached to the
   telephone alongside the emergency numbers.  (Of course, if a telephone
   had a real user interface then cue cards would not be necessary.)

Don't all of these rules sound like common sense?  Of course they do.  They
allow everyone complete freedom of choice.  If you like CNID then you can turn
it on and forget about it.  If you want to refuse calls that do not include
caller numbers then you're free to do that.  If you don't care to call anyone
who requires a caller number then you're free to adopt that policy as well.
If you never want to send out your number because you're being stalked or are
running a shelter then you can do that.  Free choice.

So why do proponents of CNID go to extraordinary lengths to defeat these
simple, ordinary protections?  Because they're afraid that large numbers of
people would use per-line blocking, thus making the system less attractive to
the businesses who want to capture lots of phone numbers.  Like many schemes
for using personal information, then, CNID is founded on trickery -- that is,
on the gathering and use of information without free choice, full informed
consent, and convenient, easily understood mechanisms for opting out.

You might ask, "doesn't per-call blocking alone provide the necessary choice?"
No, it doesn't.  Per-call blocking is like saying, "every single time you
drive your car into a gas station, your car instantly becomes the property 
of the gas station unless you remember to say abracadabra before you start
pumping your gas."  In each case, the cards are stacked against your ability
to maintain control over something of yours, whether your car or your
information.

What can you do?  Write a letter to the FCC, with a copy to your state
attorney general and public utilities commission and to your local newspaper.
Send them the list of CNID commands I provided above.  Spell it out for them,
and provide answers for the obvious pro-CNID arguments.  Your state regulators
might even agree with you already, in which case they need your support.

For more information, send a message that looks like this:

  * Electronic Frontier Foundation, <A HREF="mailto:eff@eff.org">eff@eff.org</A>

Or start something of your own.  The best way to predict the future, after
all, is to create it yourself.

I think that this approach is naive, but not *entirely* unfeasible.
Some general points:

(1) There is no way to do this solely at the client side.  Existing
services on the Internet are not reliably marked as to their
suitability for children.  Only by creating centralized authorities on
the *server* side could one add the markers needed to limit children's
access to objectionable materials.  So in the context of what a service
provider like Neosoft can do, Bruce Robertson was quite right.

(2) If the net establishes widely used protocols to allow central
authorities to control what children can and can't see, then those same
protocols could be used to control what adults can and can't see.  We
should be aware of this consequence before we adopt such technology.

(3) There are fundamental problems of scale in any such system which
would necessarily turn a many-to-many interactive medium into a
few-to-many broadcast medium, thus eroding the principal benefit of
computer networks.  You and I would be unlikely to have this
conversation under such a scheme.

(4) The major attraction of distributed document retrieval systems like
the World Wide Web and gopher is that they are *distributed*.  Many
individuals and institutions working in parallel come up with a greater
variety of useful resources than could ever be planned and executed by a
single, centralized organization.  This is fundamentally at odds with
the concept of a central registry of "approved sites".  Furthermore, a
central approval authority would have to be not merely a registration
service for sites which educators had deemed harmless, but would have
to exercise *control* (through a contract or other means) over the
content at those sites.  Otherwise, one would continually find that
yesterday's kid-safe site had today been blemished by objectionable
material.

(5) One fallacy common to proponents of isolated child-friendly
networks is that problems only occur when children can communicate
freely with adults other than their teachers.  In fact, children are
very good at communicating objectionable material to other children.
(I'm sure we can all think of examples from our own childhood.) What's
more, I suspect that the average adolescent (male, at least) is far
more likely to publish objectionable material than the average adult,
which casts doubt on the advantages of isolated K-12 networks.  Only by
limiting the children's ability to publish information -- denying
children access to E-mail, for instance -- could one be sure that an
isolated educational network would be free of objectionable material.

(6) The existing Usenet moderation mechanism is notoriously easy to
spoof.  Any bright 12-year-old with access to the manuals could figure
out how to forge an "Approved:" line.  Any rating or registration
mechanism would have to have complex authentication mechanisms built
into it or face the likelihood of being foiled (probably by the kids
themselves).

(7) Any system based on adding a backwards-compatible restriction
mechanism to existing protocols runs the risk of being foiled by users
surreptitiously gaining access to unrestricted versions of the same
client software.  Thus a kid-safe network would either have to
guarantee that children couldn't download an unhobbled version of
Mosaic, say, or it would have to isolate itself further by using
purposely incompatible protocols.

For all of these reasons, I have my doubts about the usefulness of
attempts to build an isolated "kidspace" on the net.  If you can't deal
with the risk that some children at some time will run into some
objectionable material, keep them off the net and stick to CD-ROMs.
(Or, the cynical might say: keep them locked in a closet and don't
teach them to read.)

Another anecdote illustrating the RISKS of ill-designed user interfaces....

Our office E-mail system is Microsoft Mail.  A couple of weeks ago I was
chatting with a co-worker, and asked her whether she had read a certain
mail message that morning.  She told me she hadn't, because she was
having problems with her password in Mail.

She told me that in the middle of changing her password, the window just
"disappeared," and that now her old password wasn't working anymore.

After thinking a bit about how the "change password" dialog works, I
figured out what had happened.  The form has three fields:

             Old Password: ********
             New Password: ********
    Re-Enter New Password: ********

along with the OK and Cancel buttons.  The OK button was only active
when the New Password and Re-Enter New Password fields matched.

What she had done, of course, was type her old password and press Enter,
thinking this would move her to the New Password field (she should have
pressed Tab); unfortunately, Enter meant "OK" for the change password
dialog.  Since "New Password" and "Re-Enter New Password" were both
empty (and thus matched each other), pressing OK set her password to the
null string without her realizing what had happened.

Perhaps it's reasonable for some systems to allow their password systems
to be disabled by setting a null password, but being able to do it by
accident is somewhat scary; it's almost farcical that my co-worker,
having deleted her password, was now unable to log on (since she was
presented with a password challenge, the *only* correct answer to which
was "nothing", yet she had no reasonable way of knowing this).

The 20 Oct 1994 Wall Street Journal contains an article about computerization
at Greyhound that you'll have to read to believe.  The full reference is:

  Robert Tomsho, How Greyhound Lines re-engineered itself right into a deep
  hole, Wall Street Journal, 20 October 1994, pages A1, A10.

After Greyhound came out of bankruptcy a few years ago, a new management team
declared that they would revolutionize the company but cutting costs and
creating a huge computerized reservations system to replace the existing
collection of incompatible systems and things done by hand.  They called it
"re-engineering".  Wall Street liked this idea and bid up the company's stock
price.  The managers, feeling obliged to keep the stock price up, promised
that the system would work on schedule.

But of course it didn't, for reasons that won't surprise Risks readers.  The
main problem is that buses make many more stops than airplanes, meaning that a
bus scheduling system is an order of magnitude harder to build than an airline
scheduling system, which is already one of the most complex things anybody
ever built.  The system started slipping behind schedule, and the prototype
had a terrible interface, crashed all the time, and hung up on people.

Meanwhile, Greyhound was falling apart.  Employee turnover was very high,
customer service was terrible, the computer was messing up everything it
touched, and the company advertised a discount program even though it had no
chance of handling the expected volume of business.  Yet the stock price
stayed high because stock analysts, who make dramatically more money than
Greyhound's customers, don't ride buses and so didn't see the problems.  This
postponed the day of reckoning long enough to cause tremendous disruption for
the customers -- and long enough for the top managers of the company to cash
in a pile of options while the stock was still at its highest level.

  "Looking back, Mr. [Thomas] Thompson [the vice president in charge of
   developing the system] says, "I should have quit or just said that
   I couldn't do it."  Instead, most copies of his report [warning of
   difficulties with the system] were destroyed, and any mention of it
   was purged from many Greyhound agendas, calendars and computer files,
   many people say."

It's distressing that words like "re-engineering" can have such magical force
for so many people that well-known pitfalls in system implementation can go
undetected for so long -- except, of course, by the working people who have
to use the systems or get around on the bus.

As to be expected, the governor's race in Illinois is pretty heated and
involving a fair bit of mud-slinging.  The latest story (reported in the Oct.
11 Champaign-Urbana News-Gazette) concerns the husband of one candidates, Dawn
Clark Netsch; apparently he failed to pay property taxes for four years on a
condominium in Chicago that they owned.  Of interest to RISKS readers is that
he blames the problem on a computer at the county tax office; he claims that
he didn't pay because the county sent the tax bill to the wrong address.  The
condo is on Goethe street, and the story is that both E's in the street name
were dropped in the county tax records, leaving `Go th' and making it appear
that the street was `60th.'  According to Netsch's husband, this meant he
never got the tax bill.  Whether or not this is a valid excuse, I thought it
was an interesting application of computers to spin control.

Susana Higuchi, deposed wife of Alberto Fujimori (president of Peru),
had her presidential hopes quashed by Peru's electoral board because
of a shortage of valid signatures.  Higuchi claims to have submitted
about 130,000 signatures, while the board claims only 11,851 were valid,
short of the required 100,000.  Higuchi claimed some 150,000 signatures
were erased from her party's computers during a blackout that affected
only the block in which her offices were located.  She blamed her husband's
cronies for high-tech fraud.  [Source: San Francisco Chronicle, 20 Oct 1994]  

The moral of this story is certainly familiar to RISKS readers.

&gt;[story of theft of a computer, containing the only copy of a writer's MS]

Some years ago I received a letter from the publisher of a small magazine
that I subscribe to.  Someone had broken into their office and stolen the
computer, and (this was back in CP/M days) all the floppy disks that were
nearby.  So they had done a mailing from some old paper copy of a list
of subscribers, and were asking us to tell them when our subscriptions
expired, by looking at mailing labels on the last copies received.

Ever since then, wherever I go, I preach to people about making backups and
keeping a copy of the backup in some safe place where it won't be easy to
steal along with the computer.  I wonder if there's a way to get this message
out to the myriads of small business and organization people who aren't in a
position to read the computer industry literature.  If only we could get the
story to be spread and repeated as well as the Craig Shergold plea and the
gold star tattoo urban legend!

This is a shortened translation of an article published in Le Monde, date
16-17/10/94, p. 9.

Le Monde is considered by many as the major and most-respected French daily
newspaper. It always has very documented and accurate reports.

Thanks to Francis Jambon for help with the translation of technical terms.

  In-flight stall of an A310 Airbus
  An automatic mode switch escaped the commandant's notice

The investigation commission shed more light this Friday on the incident that
involved an A310 of the Tarom airline on the 24th of September over the Orly
Paris airport. It appears that the aircraft which was in "landing approach"
mode was too fast. This triggered a "mode" switch response from the aircraft.
In other words, the aircraft started to go upwards to slow itself down.

The aircraft was flying at 364 kilometers per hour (226 mph or 202 knots),
slightly over the speed limit of this configuration which is 360 kmph (224
mph or 200 knots). This triggered the automatic response. The pilot tried
to counter its effect and thus started a process that provoked the stall of
the aircraft. This new information lead the French civil aviation authority
(DGAC) to decide to inform immediately the French airlines that use A310s
and A300-600s equipped with the same protection mechanism. The DGAC asked
the airlines to draw the attention of the crews on the required observation
of established speed limits. Airlines should also make sure that the crews
are perfectly-well informed of the logics of the protection system that
automatically triggers in case of abnormal speed.

A woman with whom I am acquainted recently wound up in the intensive care
unit of a local hospital due to a computer risk.

The woman, who has been in ill-health for some years and has been undergoing
regular dialysis, accidentally pulled out her shunt (a semi-permanent
connection point for the dialysis machine) while sleeping and had to undergo
urgent but relatively minor surgery at the local hospital emergency room.
During this procedure, the ER physician - who had been informed that the
woman had a pacemaker implanted - used an electrocautery device to stop the
bleeding. The surgery itself went well; however, the woman's condition
deteriorated. After some days went by and doctors had told relatives that the
woman was not expected to survive, it was discovered that the electromagnetic
field created by the electrocauterizer had apparently corrupted the software
of her microprocessor-controlled pacemaker, causing it to fire in a pattern
out of sync with her natural cardiac rhythm. The difference was slight enough
to avoid immediate detection but serious enough to cause problems. A
representative of the pacemaker's manufacturer was able to reprogram the unit
(using data transmitted to the still implanted unit as audio tones via a
transducer) and the woman is now recovering quite nicely.

I believe the risk here is pretty obvious.

There's an interesting letter in the October '94 IEEE Computer Magazine 
(page 5). I'll quote the first paragraph:

Marty Leisner of the League of Programming Freedom writes:

    Capers Jones had a nice article in Computer on the economics of 
    software re-use, but he should have changed "First, you cannot 
    safely reuse garbage." to "First, you cannot economically reuse 
    garbage." Many computer applications don't exhibit "safety" 
    aspects (the worse that can happen is they do not work as advertised).

I think this is a risky attitude in the modern world. Almost any program that
produces output that is used by humans can have a safety aspect - people can
be physically or economically injured if the application gives the wrong
answer. This means any program from a spreadsheet, to a C compiler, to a
nuclear power plant control system can be safety critical for some or all of
its users.

Published reusable software should be as carefully designed and verified as
any other safety critical software, since its publishers will have no control
over what systems it gets reused in.

We're a PC compatible office that may switch to Power Mac's (due to external
economic incentives).  While installing software on a new Power MAC my
colleague needed the serial number on the disk in the drive.  He reflexively
reached up and pressed the button below the disk drive to eject the disk,
except on the Power Mac this is the POWER button. This crashed the
installation (and generally confused the operating system).

For a company that actively seeks converts from the PC compatible market; they
(Apple) should have caught this problem and moved the power switch AWAY from
the disk drive.

This illustrated the risk of SEEMINGLY similar interfaces.

(maybe pressing the power off button should light a second button, labeled
"Are You Sure?"  :) )

A brand-new locally invented anti-squirrelcide device is currently under
test by Iowa Illinois Gas and Electric in my neighborhood.  Their initial
reports are extremely favorable (transformers equipped with the device
in a 6 month test run killed no squirrels, other transformers in the same
area had their usual kill rate).  Given that it costs the utility about
$100 a squirrel kill to replace blown fuzes etc, the device is showing up
as a winner (it's trivial to install and inexpensive).

The device is a band which snaps around the insulator on the high voltage feed
to the transformer (the favored site for squirrels to zap themselves) and
gives them a warning tingle before they get a chance to do themselves in.
Just a plastic band with stainless steel fingers, with all electric current
needed to provide the tingle coming from leakage through the air and over the
insulator surface.  SRI and PG&amp;E ought to look into something like it!

Another Anti-CNID fella misses the point:

&gt; The article states clearly that the real reason for CNID is commercial.

Be that as it may, we have CNID now and it's proven a valuable weapon
against telemarketers. Virtually all telemarketers call from their own
business phone, transmitting the business address. It's great: here's
three calls fifteen minutes apart from the Houston Symphony. No thanks.
We can pick and choose who we want to listen to (Hi! Sure, I've got a bag
of clothes for your charity) and who we want to do the receiver drop on
(companies with names like Allied Marketing are a good choice).

Best of all, I can call my wife! She's a little phone-shy, so she doesn't
answer the phone much during the day... but with CNID she knows it's
from work and I can talk to her.

&gt; Privacy advocates have been saying this for years, and for a long time they
&gt; have gotten patronizing lectures about how CNID is for residential use in
&gt; catching harassing phone callers.

CNID is for all sorts of things, including things the companies pushing it
have never thought of. I include telemarketers in the category of harassing
phone callers and it catches them just fine.

&gt; But CNID is a poor way to catch harassing phone callers.

Really? You think it's responsible to call the cops on some dumb kid with
a little spare time? I call their parents and let them resolve the problem
at home. Haven't used CNID for that yet, but Call-Return worked in one
case... in the other the kids called when their parents were out :-&lt; but
next time they'll have to deal with daddy :-&gt;.

[stock id-blocking feature list]

Your enhancements are fine, and I have no problem whatsoever with them. I
would still buy CNID with them in place. In fact I'm pretty sure they
are... I've had a couple of calls like that... and I still bought the service.
Certainly the local stores selling ID boxes are doing a brisk business.

I don't know who you think CNID proponents are, but it's nowhere near as
simple as you make it out.

&gt; What can you do?

Well for a start you can quit pushing it as a "pro-CNID" "anti-CNID" argument,
because all that does is polarise people who *would* be on your side into
taking an opposed position just to defend a capability they consider
important. And you can quit acting like all the pro-CNID people are nasty
telemarketers, too.

You can catch more flies with honey, and all that rot...

Phil Agre suggests some simple rules for calling-number ID.  I'd like to
promote a simple adaptation that would retain essentially all of the
subscriber benefit of CNID, even when blocked.  Require the phone company to
assign a second unique number (a blind identifier, not a directly dialable
number) to each telephone and supply that number, instead of the regular phone
number, when the caller is blocking.  This would allow the recipient to
identify the caller without giving the recipient a callable number.

As an enhancement, the phone company could be allowed to offer to attempt
calls through that number (call an 800 number then key the blind identifier),
but the subscriber must be able to specify that (1) all such calls are to be
rejected, (2) all calls from a particular number are to be rejected, or (3)
all calls from a particular number are to be accepted.

I don't think this represents a serious technological hurdle; I think it
answers the privacy concerns and provides a significantly more useful service
than one that allows simple blocking.

First, readers should be aware of the CNID FAQ which I wrote some time ago -
it is available at the Telecom archive or I can send a copy.

Second, I am strongly in favor of nationwide CNID as should be all system
owners with dialup lines (of course I am also in favor of Clipper as soon as
the gov - next month ? - drops key escrow so be forewarned 8*).

Why, because with CNID, crackers/phreaks/war dialers will have to find another
way - unless the number is known and on an approved list, the modem doesn't
answer at all. True, not all people call in from known numbers but in the two
years I have been testing, a very high percentage - over 80% - of the dialins
are local and known. Of the other 20%, nationwide CNID will handle about 5%
leaving 15% that will need a different number to dial and OTP devices.

Further, since starting to play with this two years ago (my FreeWare .ASP for
Procomm + is still in the Telecom archives), I have found it possible to not
only block unwanted calls but create a tailored menu/connection for employees
calling from home that connects directly to their preferred platform (normal
authentication is still required but it does not have to be multi-step).

Somehow in all of the noise, this market seems to have been missed entirely
but with more and more telecommuters/service providers/dial-up accounts/etc.
it is a natural protection and additional layer of security/logging that also
happens to be invisible to conventional attack.

True, a caller does not have to give their number and the telcos will provide
means to accomplish it but *I reserve the right not to answer blocked calls*.
Using crude equipment (a Supra (plug) v.32b modem - the CNID was a $20 option)
this was possible two years ago. What I do not understand if why more people
are not using it - a whole untapped market that seems to have been ignored.

Sure there are problems - my biggest one was the time to scan an "approved"
list that kept growing using a 386-25/ST-225 combination  - sometimes it would
take five rings before the whole list could be scanned &amp; the modem told to
answer - but that's what engineers are for 8*).
							Padgett

ps please do not inquire about a product. Other than the original freeware
   .ASP, the rest has been a hobby: there is no GUI or pretty packaging, 
   that's what vendors are for. The point is it *can* be done - after
   proving that, I tend to lose interest.

From The Atlanta Constitution, Tues 18 Oct 1994, p.1, by Christopher C. Warren

  Imagine a single monthly statement listing all utility charges, including
  phone, cable, gas, electricity, water, garbage collection and sewerage
  charges.  It could be the mother of all utility bills and would allow
  consumers to write only a single check for all their services.  One Check,
  as the proposal is being touted, would ease consumer's household management
  by reducing utility bills to one monthly payment, said Maureen Bailey, vice
  president of public affairs with American Express, the company proposing the
  service.

    The article goes on to describe the pilot test being proposed for the
Atlanta metro area. The cost of the service would be shared by the utilities
and the consumer.

    Risks?  A little late with one payment and you're instantly in arrears
with every company in town. Billing disputes "still would be handled through
the individual utility companies", but what if the utility says it didn't
get a payment you sent to the service company?  If your combined statement is
mailed on the 15th and a utility transmits a new charge to the service bureau
on the 16th, what happens to the payment grace period?  If you've ever had to
rob Peter to pay Paul, how do you deal with Peter &amp; Paul, Amalgamated?
    Perhaps the real question is 'Do I want to give a complete, itemized
description of all monthly utility consumption to American Express?' (and pay
for the privilege).

On Thursday 20 October 1994, I attended an Emergency Response seminar held in
the auditorium of a high-tech institute. There were a number of fire and
ambulance personnel there "in-service" with two-way radios. A radio
transmission inside the auditorium triggered all kinds of equipment - the
video projector turned on, the slide projector turned on, and some
unidentified motor noise started up.

Nothing new, but an example of a widespread problem (still sometimes not
accepted as real.)

The posting in <A HREF="/Risks/16.47.html">RISKS-16.47</A> about reprogramming pacemakers through audio
tones seems a bit alarming to me.  Does that mean someone could have a
tape player (i.e. "boom box") with a tape of pacemaker programming signals
which would be deadly to certain members of the public?  Imagine some guy
walking around with that on a crowded train or bus.

How about cutting into the SCA-encoded Muzak played in supermarkets?
That's broadcast on the same frequencies used for ordinary FM radio.
Often, wireless mikes are used at lectures and concerts.  Care to find
out how many Rolling Stones fans have pacemakers?  The power level
from the speakers at a concert hall ought to be much more than is needed
for programming.

Anyone know the name of the company that made the malfunctioning pacemaker?
It might be interesting to do a patent search on them.

I was surprised that a pacemaker would be susceptible to this interference,
that it didn't figure it out, and apparently had no fallback mode. I'm
not sure what EMI field strength the electrocauterizer created; should
a patient be advised to avoid proximity to arc-welders and to 50KW
broadcasting facilities like the one next to a bridge in San Francisco Bay?

Secondly, a state-verification circuit (or even a "heartbeat"!) could
have detected the malfunction, and regressed to a fallback fixed rate.
Your own heart has a 30 beats/minute tertiary protective function -
you're unable to engage in strenuous activity, but you remain alive
until you can seek help.

The following article summary is followed by some comments:

   In a Front Page article appearing in the Wed 19 Oct 1994 {Washington (DC)
Times} entitled "High-Tech sleuthing busts cellular phone fraud ring" reporter
Doug Abrahms tells us that Clinton Watson and two other persons were arrested
Monday for selling cellular phones with altered serial numbers, causing the
charges to be sent to legitimate cellular users.
   According to an Indictment in U.S. District Court in San Jose, when police
raided Watson's house, they found 30 phones with counterfeit ID, 16 altered
memory chips and 600 mobile phone numbers which could be used for fraudulent
calls.  Some of Mr. Watson's phones had as many as 12 different ID numbers,
thus spreading usage patterns over a large area.  Other phones were designed
to allow the ID to be changed at will.
   Police and cellular companies have turned to using 
more sophisticated means to find illegal cellular phones, including 
helicopters, voice prints and traffic analysis. 
   Mr. Watson is a Computer Programmer who designed his own software to
program integrated circuits to include numbers read from scanners used on the
cellular band.  The phones so set up were referred to as "lifetime" phones
since they never got a bill.  They sold for $1,200 to $1,500 and have been
found all over North America, according to Ron Nessen of the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), which estimates that cellular
fraud is a $1 million a day problem, with people stealing cellular IDs by
waiting near tunnels, airports and parking lots to snatch the ID code
transmitted.
   New York's NYNEX is introducing a PIN code on cellular calls.  The Mayor
and Police Commissioner of New York City have had the IDs for their cellular
phones stolen six times this year.  A division of TRW is developing a means to
prevent calls unless the user's voice print matches the print on file.

Comments:

1.  Cellular Companies have been notorious for evading security problems in
their phones.  Rather than spend the money to add encryption in their switch
software, they got a law passed to make it illegal to listen to cellular
frequencies and to build equipment that can monitor cellular bands.

2.  Cellular phones transmit call information in the clear, so a thief can
just use someone else's number and steal a few minutes of airtime from them;
if you bleed 10,000 customers of ten extra minutes a month, almost none of
them individually will recognize that their bill is ten minutes too high.
Unless customers complain, the Cellular Company won't care.

3.  A typical practice of an aerospace/military contracting company like TRW
is to try an implement and expensive complicated system such as voice print
matching instead of something simple and cheap like a device to implement
either Kerberos validation, S/Key style one-time passwords, or MD-4/MD-5
arithmetic checksum of some stored value.  Putting such methods in as an
inexpensive box like a Radio Shack tone dialer might cost users $20 and
installing it in new phones might cost an extra $2 or $3.  Persons having
portable PCs could run a program to generate the code.  Since everything is
done without a secret being transferred, the software to do this can be public
and nothing is compromised.

4.  Does using a biometric validation system on a communications network 
scare anyone?  I can think of a half-dozen reasons to dislike it, including:
- use of the system to track and locate dissidents and anyone the people
  who run the government don't like;
- my sister wants me to call someone for her and find out something 
  without them knowing it's her asking; I don't match her car phone profile; 
- I borrow her car to do an errand; I can't call her back to let her know 
  what I found out for her;
- Bugs in the software might not recognize the owner with a cold, after an 
  accident that damages their throat, or after some forms of surgery;
- Checking voice prints will require very heavy processing capability, 
  quite likely slowing down call connection times;
- I bug someone's car and simply play back the recording to unlock their
  phone.

I think that this is an attempt to "kill flies with nuclear weapons," e.g.
excessive overkill.  There are cheaper alternatives such as mathematical
verification that will probably be quite effective without using a system that
requires expensive and complicated subsystems such as voice print recognition.

Actually - FBI/Cellular operators/... could just buy suitable equipment from a

key-word spotting.

Certainly why I look forward to widely available portable crypto for mobile

The following concerns an acquaintance whom I'll call S, who works at the
corporate headquarters of a large firm which I'll call FooCorp (the pseudonyms
are used because none of what happened seems to be FooCorp's fault, but some
of their clients might be a bit distressed to hear about it).

Having recently changed residences, S filed a mail-forwarding order in her
name at her former post office.  A few days later, mail addressed to the
offices of a number of FooCorp employees started showing up at her new house,
complete with yellow computer-generated forwarding stickers.  How this
happened is partial conjecture on S's and my part, as the postmaster in S's
former town of residence wasn't terribly helpful in unraveling the mystery.
The trigger seems to be the fact that as part of her employment S has a
commercial credit card in the name of FooCorp, and the bills were mailed to
``FooCorp, [S's old home address].''  Somehow, some combination of postal
employees and postal software decided therefore to generate a forwarding order
such that mail addressed to FooCorp passing through the postal sorting
facility nearest to S's former home should be forwarded to S's new address.

The outcome is that various important-looking pieces of FooCorp's mail were
diverted to a rural mailbox in front of a horse barn in the middle of nowhere,
and apparently no one in the Postal Service thought this at all odd.

The postmaster thinks the forwarding order has now been eradicated, and S has
contacted her credit card issuer to cause the bills to be mailed in her name,
not FooCorp's.  However, the misdelivered mail hasn't totally stopped, since
while the order was in effect, the Postal Service dutifully notified anyone
whose envelope said ``Address Correction Requested'' that FooCorp had moved;
there are now at least a few mailing databases out there which think that
FooCorp is located at S's house.

The lesson, of course, is that procedures that try automatically to do the
right thing without being asked sometimes need a reality check applied to the
results.

In an article in The Nation, Allan Nairn asserts that the American military
force occupying Haiti is more concerned about the popular movement that
elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide than it is about the oligarchy that created 
the attaches.  I don't know whether this assertion is fair, but Risks readers
might be interested in one part of his evidence.  The full citation is:

  Allan Nairn, The eagle is landing, The Nation 259(10), 3 October 1994,
  pages 344-348.

Here's a quote:  

  ... the Pentagon's Atlantic Command (ACOM) has commissioned Booz, Allen,
  Hamilton, a corporate consulting firm, to devise a computer model of Haitian
  society.  A similar model was ordered for Iraq for Desert Storm.  The model
  tries to predict "the effects of social, political and economic actions on
  various sectors of society".  In an April 29 report Booz, Allen presented a
  "Power Relationship Matrix" which divides Haitian society into seven groups,
  including the "Lower Class Majority", and asks questions like "What would
  mobilize the masses to take action?"

  The crux of the Booz, Allen/ACOM planning theory is thus: "Whether political
  power is a direct function of popular support or based on the allegiance
  of key groups and coercion of the remainder of the populace, cohesion of
  support is a critical question in assessing political power".  They place
  greatest emphasis on the importance of "Organized Civil Society" -- popular
  and professional groups, unions and associations, development workers --
  seeking to identify the points at which mass cohesion will crack.  This,
  they say, is the key to any program for "control of the populace".

  Their priority is to build an "organized information bank" and to run a
  systematic, ongoing "assessment of the relative strengths of opposition
  organizations", as well as of leading "political personalities".  "The
  tracking of opposition organizations", they say, "should be limited to those
  which are known to have a basis of political action and some established
  capacity for taking political action".

  As the Washington Office on Haiti has documented in detailed reports, A.I.D.
  [the US Agency for International Development] is already exploring this
  divide-and-conquer strategy in Haiti, seeking to cultivate and fund, as on
  embassy memo put it, "responsible elements within the popular movement"
  along with "moderate Duvalierist factions".  (pages 347-348)

An exercise for the reader: if they implemented such a program for your home
town, what would it look like?

Tumbling a beeper's activation code is trivial.  You can take your beeper to
any beeper service company, ask to be switched to their line of service, and
they'll recode and activate you, assuming (a) that you're using the same
brands that they are and (b) you're *not* using the same service company they
are (or they can't switch you).  Presumably, a stolen beeper could be handled
as if you owned it, then there's a high likelyhood that you'd get it
reactivated.

ARRRRGGGHH!!  And the risk of idiots designing switches!  It does not take a
rocket scientist to figure out that a critical switch should be put in a
hard-to-access location or should have a protective cover over it.  This kind
of stuff is taught in very basic human engineering classes.

There are certain errors designers are doomed to keep repeating, and switch
design is one of them.

Geez!  Will Apple never learn?  The original Apple II was notorious for having
its reset button on the keyboard immediately adjacent to the return key, with

The late lamented Commodore company did the same with the Amiga 3000, which
has a push power switch in almost the same location as the disk eject button
of the A1000.  I don't suppose that was the only reason for the company's
demise.  Still, fond as I have been of the A3000 since the day I got it, that
design feature led me to wish an even worse fate on the company on numerous
occasions during my first several months of ownership.

&gt;Published reusable software should be as carefully designed and verified as
&gt;any other safety critical software, since its publishers will have no control
&gt;over what systems it gets reused in.

I think this is wrong.  Ensuring safety is the requirement of the human
organization producing a potentially hazardous product.  The *organization*
must have adequate quality checks.  One engineer's bad day, one alpha
particle, or one bolt's failure, should not harm people.

One wouldn't disallow the reuse of used power supply designs, for instance.
Instead, if you were putting them into an important machine, you would not
only test their published performance, but perhaps *add* additional
safety-relevant tests.  And then you would design in several of them if the
application justified it.

If you want to reuse some code (or other artifact) in a RISKy application,
maybe you'll have to characterize it more than a less critical user.  What
else is new?

Computer professionals should learn that (organizations of) people are
responsible; technical professionals are responsible for making technical
observations and their implications known to others in the organization.

While I haven't seen the original piece, I would expect that it glossed over
what may very well be a major, if not -the- major, cause of of the problems --
namely, the horrendous management-labor problems at the company that led to a
strike/lockout/mass firing (take your choice....) of the vast majority of bus
operators.  The bosses, though, as well as the finance MBA types, stayed in
office. And, as the article mentioned, cheerfully exercised their stock
options to make huge profits.

In Don Norman, in his book "Things That Make Us Smart", makes some interesting
points about Call Number ID.  He writes that the emphasis on NUMBERS stems
from a mechanistic view of the phone system -- a human view of the phone
system wouldn't depend so heavily on numbers (which we have trouble
remembering).

He suggests that other information should be sent instead of a telephone
number.  Perhaps each telephone owner could set a string that accompanies
their call instead of their phone number.  It need not be more than a few
characters -- maybe your first name, maybe the name of your company.

His point is that the average person wants to know WHO is calling, and only
businesses, etc., really care about the phone number.  This solution should
retain the value of CNID (knowing whether you want to answer the phone), but
eliminate the privacy risks (including the need for call blocking, etc.)

I found lots of excellent commentary on this and other sorts of RISKS in his
book.  I know he's posted here before, and I noticed he has a reference to
RISKS in his book.  I recommend it to everyone.

  Require the phone company to assign a second unique number ... to each
  telephone... I don't think this represents a serious	technological hurdle...

It does.  Almost all area codes in North America are more than half populated.
In order to double the number of phone numbers, most area codes would have to
be split.

Every technologist should, at some point in the educational process, be
required to read this book.  (The preceding proviso is, unfortunately, subject
to the risk that said technologist may fail to grasp the book's underlying
lessons.)

Peter G. Neumann is well known to the members of the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM), but to thousands more he is known as moderator of the RISKS-
FORUM Digest electronic mailing list (or its Usenet mirror, comp.risks). 
(RISKS is notable for the quality and interest of its material, and is a
recommended mailing list for all newcomers to the Internet, regardless of their
areas of interest.)  This work is not merely a compilation, but a distillation
of the type of material discussed on RISKS.  The occasional item is not
strictly computer related (an ongoing RISKS discussion itself), but all
demonstrate the variety of ways in which technology may constitute a hazard.

Written primarily in the format of a textbook for an academic environment, the
material is not only readable but fascinating for a non-technical audience. 
The end notes, challenge questions and bibliography make it an excellent choice
for any course dealing with security, safety or general systems development
issues.

(We interrupt this review to note that PGN is able to write over two-and-a-half
pages of the Preface before we find the first pun.  By the end of Chapter two,
he is in full flight.  I refer you to "Tempest Puget, or The Sound and the
Ferries" for full multi-model, cliche-referential punning entries.)

As well as system and software engineering students, this book should have a
place on the desk of anyone involved in a technology development project.  It
*can* happen here.

I recently obtained the new 5th edition of The Official Encyclopedia of
Bridge, the major reference book published by the American Contract Bridge
League.  It happens that several different numbers that relate to bridge can
occur in half-integers -- you can be in a 6.5-table duplicate game, hold 3.5
quick tricks, score 1.5 (in the American style) match points, and so on.  Where
I have used the two ASCII characters .5 in this posting, the book naturally
uses the single character 1/2 instead.

Or rather, it tries to.  Somehow, wherever the character 1/2 is supposed to
occur, instead there is a degree sign!

Somehow I doubt that that'd ever have happened without computer typesetting.
An obvious guess is that all drafts for proofing were done with a font
having a different character set or encoding from the one used in final
production.

&gt;&gt;NOTICE ADVISORY TO NAVSTAR USERS (NANU) 222-94266

I just wanted to make clear to anyone interested that the described problem is
not a defect in the GPS system, it is a failure by certain receiver
manufactures to properly implement the specifications.

The referenced subsection refers to the handling of "Leap Seconds".  
&lt;Note: Leap Seconds are unrelated to leap years.&gt;

GPS maintains time as second count from a base value.  Off the top of my head,
I believe that the base time is midnight Jan 5/6 1980.  GPS maintains a COARSE
time field as a 10 bit week count from this base.  There is also a sub field
that warns of leap seconds in the near future or recent past.  To save bits,
the leap second warning only uses the least significant 8 bits of the 10 bit
week field.  The receiver is supposed to performed a clearly specified
algorithm to account for this 4+ year subrange.  Apparently some receiver
manufactures did not properly implement this.

On a speculative note: The GPS satellite 10-bit week field should roll over
sometime around August 1999.  At that time the base time reference of Jan 1980
becomes August 1999.  I wonder how many receivers will correctly handle that
rollover?  If any of you out there have access to a receiver you can play
with; try initializing it with a date of Oct 1999 and see if it correctly
initializes itself to 20 years (1024 weeks) in the future from current time,
or drops back to current time implying a hard coded base of 1980 that may not
work after August 1999.  Note that this is speculation on my part; I don't
know for sure that this interpretation is correct.

As always; your mileage may vary!

FOR RELEASE:  SEPTEMBER 14, 1994

      FTC TARGETS ADVERTISING ON "INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY":
  Credit repair co. urged consumers to falsify data, FTC Charged

     In its first case targeting advertising on the "information
superhighway," the Federal Trade Commission has charged a Sacramento,
California, man with making false claims in the course of promoting his
credit-repair program on an on-line computer service.  The FTC alleged that
Brian Corzine, doing business as Chase Consulting, promoted his $99 program on
America Online.  The program allegedly advises consumers to take illegal steps
in order to repair their credit records, while representing that it is "100%
legal."  At the FTC's request, a federal district court has ordered a
temporary halt to the alleged deceptive promotion, and frozen Corzine's assets
to preserve any funds for consumer redress.

     "As these computer networks continue to grow, we will not tolerate the
use of deceptive practices here any more than we have tolerated them on other
recently-emerged technologies for marketing products and services to
consumers," said FTC Chairman Janet D.  Steiger in announcing the case.

     In its complaint detailing the charges in the case, the FTC alleged that
Corzine (also known as Brian Chase) advertised his credit program on America
Online, instructing consumers to contact Chase Consulting through the computer
service.  Corzine allegedly enticed consumers to do so by using statements
such as:

     -- "FOR JUST $99.00 WE WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO CREATE A BRAND NEW
     CREDIT FILE AT ALL 3 OF THE MAJOR CREDIT BUREAUS...100% LEGAL
     AND 200% GUARANTEED."

     Consumers who contacted Chase Consulting by computer received a
three-page description of the program instructing them to obtain a "taxpayer
identification number" from one of a few specific Internal Revenue Service
regional centers and then to use this number in place of their Social Security
number on credit applications.  The complete "file segregation" program
included a booklet which further instructed consumers to obtain two new
addresses: one for use on their driver's licenses and one for use on credit
applications.  Corzine allegedly represented that the program is legal.  But
consumers who falsify statements on certain loan and credit applications or
falsify their Social Security number would violate one or more federal
criminal statutes, the FTC said.

     The FTC has asked the federal district court to issue a
permanent injunction against Corzine prohibiting him from engaging
in these kinds of practices in the future, and ordering him to pay
consumer redress.

     The FTC vote to file the complaint was 3-0, with Commissioner Dennis A.
Yao not participating.  It was filed under seal in U.S.  District Court for
the Eastern District of California, in Sacramento, on Sept. 12, 1994.  The
seal was lifted late yesterday.

NOTE: The Commission files a complaint when it has "reason to believe" that
the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to the Commission that a
proceeding is in the public interest.  The complaint is not a finding or
ruling that the defendant has actually violated the law.  The case will be
decided by the court.

     Copies of the complaint and free FTC brochures for consumers titled
"Credit Repair Scams," "A New Credit Identity: A New Credit Repair Scam," and
"How to Dispute Credit Report Errors," which offer tips on avoiding these
types of schemes and correcting your own credit record, are available from the
FTC's Public Reference Branch, Room 130, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue,

Suddenly RISKS has become concerned over the placement of the power switch on
the on a model of the Mac. Sigh. The concern is justified, but the solution
not quite so apparent.

Would RISK readers be reassured or appalled to discover that several months
ago I thrust myself into the battle and now am in charge of solving the
problem? Ah, a simple problem, one I thought would offer some relief from the
more substantive issues I normally grapple with. All I had to do was find a
consistent logical spot to put the power switch, and do it right, once and for
all.

Wrong. Now several months later, after numerous meetings and roughly ten
draft proposals, meeting with roughly 30 people from several divisions of
the company, we are perhaps near a solution. Perhaps, but hardly a week ago
a new problem arose that, as yet, does not have a solution.

Let me tell you, it isn't easy to do a consistent policy on power switches.
The proposal, plus justification is 21 pages. First of all we have an
incredible variety of machines, from those used as high power workstations,
to servers (which need protected power switches), to office, home, and
educational machines. And portables. Some machines are placed on the desk,
often with the monitor on top.  Some are placed on the floor.  Some are
rotated to stand on their side. Some would seem to require clearly marked,
easily accessible switches. Some need switches out of reach.

On top of these problems, we don't even want people to use the power
switch: it invariably leads to damage. We prefer them to use the shutdown
menu which can do a neat, orderly quitting of applications and safe
shutdown. Under normal conditions, it would be best not to have a power
switch at all. But sometimes it is necessary to disconnect power. And I
have even heard it claimed that our software sometimes crashes (really?),
so that a soft, graceful shutdown isn't possible. In this case, some sort
of shutdown switch is required, one that bypasses system software.

Some otherwise simple solutions are ruled out by cost considerations. In
the low-end market, where cost dominates and the profit margins are
negligible, even a very slight extra cost can disrupt product sales, so if
we want a uniform policy for all machines, it has to be one acceptable to
the most cost-conscious product.

Finally, we must satisfy international safety requirements, have a solution
that works across the world with a variety of languages and cultural
expectations, and that can be used by people with a variety of
disabilities. It has to be readily understood by first-time users, people
who may never have used a Mac before, but not annoy our skilled, power
users. Moreover, the problems are tightly coupled with the need to reboot
occasionally, and programmers need a way of getting into the debug state.
And as I said, the solution has to work for both the normal situation and
the case where the system software is no longer responding. The power
switch problem therefore also becomes the problem of providing capabilities
to "reboot," to do an "emergency power down," and to get access to the
"debug state." Not to mention labeling the power key.

You wouldn't believe how much time we spent on the problem of appropriately
labeling the switch. The left-facing triangle on the keyboard switch is
there because it doesn't mean anything. (Honest.)  The earlier symbol
(vertical line inside a circle) was not permitted because the European
standards people wouldn't let us use it  -- that symbol was reserved for
hard power switches. The triangle has no meaning, so it didn't violate any
standards. Mind you, the legal symbols are just as non-meaningful to most
people. Few -- European or American -- are confident about the meaning of
the vertical bar and circle (on and off, respectively), let alone bar
inside of circle (a toggled on/off), or vertical bar inside broken circle
(toggled soft-power),  but the European standards committee is very strict.
There are safety risks associated with thinking a shutdown switch removes
all power from the machine when it doesn't. (Today, many electronic devices
never have all power removed. The "power" button on the television remote
does not do a hard shutdown, nor does the "shut down" menu choice on the
Mac.  After all, if they really shut down all power, the TV remote wouldn't
be able to turn the power back on, nor would the Mac's keyboard turn on the
machine. Your clock radio, for example, is not really off when you turn
"off" the power. If it were off, how would the clock be powered?)

So, what seemed to be a very simple task, one that would remove all the
confusions of our power switch locations, to say nothing of the infamous
problem newly discovered by RISKS readers (but well known within Apple)
where the keyboard can accidentally hit the power switch (nobody in RISKS
commented on that -- you guys are slipping!) turned out to be incredibly
complex. Yes, people turn off the power thinking they are pushing the
diskette eject button. Macs don't have a diskette eject button -- we eject
disks gracefully, under program control -- which is why the designers
failed to note this problem prior to manufacture: it is users of non-Mac
machines that have this problem. This is not justification, but I am
continually amazed by the number of usage combinations that have to be
tested -- it feels infinite -- so no matter how thorough the user testing,
new situations arise after the product is shipped, situations that the
bystander thinks so obvious that the designers must have been stupid not to
have noticed (ah, that famous paper again: hindsight is not equal to
foresight).

(By the way, you can't have a warning message come up when the power switch
is hit for several reasons, the simplest being that if the software has
crashed, you can't guarantee that the message would be displayed or the
response attended to -- you need some way of forcing a shutdown when
everything else has failed.)

(And while I am at it, don't suggest that our job would be simpler if we
simply made software that never crashed. Or that we could use a watchdog
timer to do automatic reboots.Yes, but ...  .)

So what will we come up with?  Can you live without a power switch on the
CPU box, assuming all other cases have been dealt with? Assuming the system
were protected against accidents. What if the switch were only in the rear?
(Remember, we don't want people to use it under normal circumstances.)

Will my committee actually be able to find a common proposal that all the
divisions of the company can accept? Who knows? Will the solution we are
close to adopting solve all problems? Almost definitely not. Will it be an
improvement over the current solution? Absolutely. Could we have done
better? Maybe, but  if we knew how, we would.

Whew: look how long this simple note has become, just to clarify the nature
of the problem. Symptomatic.

(As for Calling Number Identification: once the power switch task is
finished, it will be a relief to turn to something easy.)

I am a senior at UCLA in Computer Science and Engineering and we have no such
thing as 'human engineering classes', 'interface design classes', or 'software
management' classes. We are taught lots of theory about computer science but
absolutely nothing about how all this theory is supposed to translate into
products that people can use. So the next time you want to smash your computer
into pieces because its interface is a nightmare or the system has just
crashed for the 7,000th time you can feel sure that the next generation of
computer scientists, at least from UCLA, hasn't been taught a single thing
about how to do better.

The risks should be obvious.

The postings on the problems of similar looking buttons (<A HREF="/Risks/16.47.html">RISKS-16.47</A>&amp;48)
reminded me of a related RISK of failing to understand user perceptions.
 
Some years ago, an electronics/avionics/computer/etc company (best they remain
anonymous) manufactured a military C3 system for use in trucks.  Part of the
equipment consisted of a small minicomputer which was installed under a
desktop in the back of the truck.  The mini had a button on the front labelled
"BOOT".  The squaddies operating the gear took this to mean the method of
operating the button, rather than its function.  Not surprisingly, the button
and switch had a very short life.  Education consistently failed to solve the
problem, and in the end the switch had to be redesigned with a large, heavy
duty, heavily sprung steel button that then could ONLY be operated by a kick.

The recent article about the location of power buttons reminded me of an
incident that occurred a few years ago.

The bank that I used switched over from one version of ATM software to
another.  In the old version you had to enter your PIN, then press a
special key to get the ATM to accept it.

Somebody decided that this was a waste of effort, since all the PINs were
the same length, so the machine could tell when you were done.  Therefore,
they removed the extra keystroke.

This might have been fine except for what they did with that key.  It became
a selection of what you wanted to do.  Unfortunately, it became the Fast
Withdrawal button, which takes a fixed amount of money out of checking,
without any more chances to stop it.

Just imagine what this could do for people who were trying to put money
into checking because the balance was too low.

Anyway, there were huge signs up around the ATM for months warning up this.
Even so, I made the mistake myself once.

This shows the RISKs of even good-hearted changes to the user interface.

The power switch isn't the only button that can be dangerous to have near
other familiar buttons.  As a help-desk assistant at a small Minnesota
college, [I noted] the most common mistake students and faculty would make on
the Heath terminals wasn't the power switch.  (The terminal could just be
switched back on to pick up where they left off) Instead, people were often
pressing "Hold Screen" -- a pretty handy button for lengthy and scrolling
messages -- which was right next to the shift key.

Before notifying the lab assistants that their terminal "just froze up" they
would try everything in their power to get the terminal to respond.  This
included pressing every function key and command sequence -- often with
disastrous results and changes (which never appeared until "Hold Screen" was
toggled again) to their document in their favorite terminal based word
processor.

Many documents were lost and professors embarrassed by mistakenly pressing
that one key.

This discussion reminds me of a bit of folk-wisdom in the Software community
in this area: All PC's made to run Microsoft's Windows and DOS products seem
to be designed mechanical switches to open the floppy drive, and with the
reset (or at least the power or "hard reset") button mounted __conveniently__
on the __front__ of the computer for easy access.  Most machines made now to
run Unix (Sun, HP, other workstations) and Apple's MAC operating system do
__not__ have mechanical switches on the floppy drive, and do __not__ usually
have the "emergency" reset switch on the front.

The folk wisdom is that you __need__ these emergency switches located for easy
access when the software you are running is unreliable and crashes often.

The misplacement of the front-panel-mounted push-button power switch on a
Power Mac 6100 or Centris/Quadra 610 shows the interesting effects of the
interactions of manufacturing costs and human interface design.

It seems as if there were two goals:

1. Putting a power switch on the back panel of the computer hides the switch
and makes the user rely on memory to operate the switch.  So, moving it to a
place where it is visible is a good idea.

2. Power supplies with a relay triggered by a momentary action switch (or a
signal on the Apple Desktop Bus) are more expensive than power supplies
that have a simple on/off latching switch.

Finally, the unwritten assumption that all Macintoshes have a powered eject
of the floppy disk that automatically ejects the disk from the disk drive
when you ask for the disk to be removed. No Mac user every pushes a button
to eject their disk. This includes all the Macintosh hardware designers.

The goals (1) and (2) are combined to place a on/off latching switch on the
front panel, despite the fact that the Machintosh system software has always
used a shutdown command selected from a menu to do an orderly close down.

The original design problem was solved with the introduction of the Mac II.
A switch on the keyboard turns the Mac on, but the Mac can only be shut
down by the menu command. 

A combination of these two concepts plus a blindness (from good design) leads
to the poor design where a user can destroy all of his work in a second or so.
In the best case, I've seen a user press the button, realize that they've just
made a big mistake, and start to save their documents while keeping their
finger on the button.

Would you like to understand *why* Apple put an eject-looking power switch on
some of their machines?

Stupidity is too easy an answer.  A more subtle explanation revolves around
the fact that Macs don't *have* disk eject switches.  They eject floppies by
software.  How can a power switch look like something that doesn't exist?  It
can't.  This button is not much of a risk...to *Mac* users.  It is the
IBM-compatible folks who will be screaming bloody-murder.

Moral: Anticipate users from beyond your own little world.  (Particularly
if your marketing folks are trying to sell to them.)

&gt;...  Will Apple never learn?  ...

I find this thread a bit odd. I've used many Macs, including both the PowerMac
7100 and 8100, and none of them newer than a Mac SE even has an accessible
power switch.  Assuming the original poster is talking about the reset button,
on all of the machines I've used, it is a small button placed about as far
away from the floppy disk drive as is reasonable.  For example on the 8100 I'm
using to send this, it is at the bottom right corner while the floppy and CD
Rom drives are at the top.  It would be very hard to confuse the reset button
with an eject button.  Perhaps the 6100 has this problem, I haven't used one
of them, but if so it's the exception not the rule.

A New Zealand newspaper, "Waikato Times", for Sept. 2, 1994, reports a
coroner's court finding that a bank robber in Sydney (Australia) died after
being trapped for more than 15 minutes by a 250-kg steel security screen,
which rose to the ceiling and trapped him by the throat.

The screen had been activated by staff in July 1991, whilst the robber was
crawling across the counter.  The robber, Steven Kovacs (age 37), died of
asphyxiation.

The risk?  When designing control systems for steel bullet-proof security
screens that actuate in less than half a second, consider what happens if
someone is in the way!

&gt; ... we have no such thing as 'human engineering classes', 'interface design
&gt; classes', or 'software management' classes.  ...

I hope you will be pleased to note that here at Carnegie Mellon I am teaching
just such a course.  It's called Dependable System Design, and it's mission is
to teach students how to design/implement/evaluate dependable systems so that
we see fewer problems of the kind recently described in RISKS.  Excerpts from
the course description follow:

  System dependability has been a major concern since the dawn of the
  electronic computer age.  Dependability, taken in its broadest context,
  includes metrics such as reliability, availability, testability,
  maintainability, usability, mean time to failure, etc.
        ...
  The goal of dependable system design is to ensure that the system continues
  to deliver its specified service to the client even in the face of error on
  the part of the user, the system or the environment.
        ...
  User interfaces, while just as critical for dependability as reliable
  hardware and software, have received little attention from the dependability
  and fault-tolerance community. Because the philosophy of dependable system
  design crosses the boundaries of hardware, software and user interfaces, a
  major portion (but not all) of the course will focus on the most recently
  critical aspect of dependable systems: user interfaces and user-system
  communication.
	...
        Upon completion of this course, the student should be able to: acquire
  system requirements, develop system specifications embodied in one or more
  dependability metrics; critique an initial design; identify weak portions of
  a design; suggest a variety of alternatives to improve dependability; use
  contemporary techniques to evaluate, compare and contrast alternative
  designs, conduct system-evaluation experiments, and produce balanced,
  cost-effective system designs.
        ...
  Topics include: Theory and practice of traditional dependability; robust
  benchmarks and fault injection; dependable user interfaces; experimental
  design; concepts of reliability and validity; system evaluation techniques;
  requirements acquisition; human error and reliability - causes, effects and
  mitigation; system monitoring, diagnosis and data analysis; task analysis.

  Dependability Motto:
    Anyone can build something that works when it works.
    But it's how it works when it doesn't work that counts.

actual method stores the electronic signature of the telephone instrument
transmitter.  A cloned phone will have a different transmitter signature and
calls from that phone will be blocked.  This system has been described in some

&gt;...  Since "New Password" and "Re-Enter New Password" were both
&gt;empty (and thus matched each other), pressing OK set her password to the
&gt;null string without her realizing what had happened.

This is extraordinarily stupid on Microsoft's part.

I have only been programming for about 6 months now (and only with Visual
Basic), but one of my fundamental rules is to NOT allow the user to leave
a dialog box until he or she has supplied all required information (or,
in the case of something ambiguous, like an empty password, at least ASK
the person before moving on).

If anyone finds the programmer responsible for that mistake, he should be
taken out and shot (and then dug up and shot again).

In <A HREF="/Risks/16.48.html">RISKS-16.48</A>, V. Michael Bove Jr. writes about a post-office forwarding
problem.  We had a similar problem once.  My wife once ran a small business
called Engineering Services Group.  When we moved, she forwarded mail to our
new address.  One of the mailing lists she was on was at Hewlett-Packard (HP).
 HP got the change of address notice, and (apparently) maniacally changed 
*every* occurrence of Engineering Services Group in their list to our new 
address.  As you might imagine, several companies have an ESG as an internal 
group -- something like this:

	H. Dilbert Gweep
	Graphic Doodler
	Engineering Services Group
	Habeas Corp.
	Anytown, OH, 00666

All 25 of these people suddenly stopped getting their 6-color HP spreads on 
90-pound stock.  All 25 copies suddenly started arriving in our mailbox with 
disconcerting regularity, each one with a different name.

The hard part was getting HP to turn the bloody thing off.  The 800 numbers 
printed on the literature were useless.  I finally found a person named on the 
masthead of some "magazine", and called her directly.  After several 
cross-country phone calls, she eventually managed to reach someone who could 
(and did) make it stop.

The risks?  Besides the danger of herniated homeowners and mail carriers,
there are 25 people out there who are no longer on a mailing list they might
have actually wanted to be on.  I doubt HP kept their old addresses lying
around.  Imagine if her company had been named "Engineering Department", or
worse yet, "Craig Shergold".

}...  If only we could get the story to be spread and repeated as well as the
}Craig Shergold plea and the gold star tattoo urban legend!

If you could, it might make a difference to the small business people, but
might not make a difference to an individual.

Back in the "good old days", hard drives were small enough that backup to
floppies was feasible on a regular basis, and it was therefore cheap.

Today, I have a 1GB external disk on my Mac that I use for all my work,
including lots of transitory data that I don't care about, and I backup the
things I do care about to my internal 230MB drive. If my computer is stolen, I
will certainly lose everything.

Am I naive? Stubborn? Stupid? Well, possibly. But my motivation in this case
is cost. Unlike IBM-compatible PCs, sizeable removable media backup systems
for Macintoshes are extremely costly. It is *much* cheaper to simply keep
buying bigger and bigger hard drives, and use the older smaller one for backup
and the newer larger (and faster) one for main use.

I am choosing not to "pay for full coverage insurance" for cost reasons; I am
protected if my main hard disk dies an untimely death, but not if all of my
computer equipment is stolen.

Consider it a RISK of one technology far outstripping another technology on
which the first is dependent. Non-removable media cost per MB, speed, and even
reliability have far out- paced that of removeable media.

     At what point is it worth a lawyer's time to spam the net?  A certain
size of audience must be reached, and easily.  Public mailing lists risk
presenting an easy way to spam.
     Many lists accept posts from non-subscribers.  One need only know
that the list exists and where to send contributions.  It would be a simple
task to poll ten thousand LISTSERVs for a list of lists.  Having compiled
such a listing, one could then send one's advertisement into several
hundreds of thousands of mailboxes.
     A more pointless exercise, and one which would cause even greater
havoc, is to set up a LISTSERV list on one's own system which would link
every list to every other list.  It takes no imagination at all to see
how quickly this would create a logjam.

A few days ago, I was in the local Sears store (Cary, N.C.). I was purchasing
a few items and decided to charge them against a Visa card.  The clerk
dutifully rang in the charges. While she was doing that, I noticed that a
small digitizing tablet was attached to the register.  I had a feeling I new
what was coming next...

She pulled the receipt out of the register, slid it under a hold-down on the
tablet, and instructed me to sign within the little plastic guide.  I refused,
stating that I would gladly sign the receipt, but not on the tablet.
Apparently, I was the first to refuse :-) She had to look up a magic phone
number, ominously entitled "Loss Prevention", to determine what to do. The
person on the other end OK'd my signing without having my signature digitized.

Some might argue that my refusal was meaningless because Sears could always
scan my signature from the receipt. Maybe so, but nothing says I have to make
it easy for them. Small encroachments eventually lead to large losses.

The assertion has been made that perhaps calling number ID would be more
acceptable if something other than numbers were sent.  In fact, that is
already part of the CNID spec (calling name delivery), though it is not
implemented in all CNID systems.  In most implementations I've seen *both*
name and number are delivered--which rather kills the idea of delivering "who
is calling" info rather than "where are they calling from" info.

There isn't much enthusiasm among the commercial end-users for name-only
delivery.  The reason is obvious--you can't collect phone numbers for return
sales calls when you're just handed a name.  While the telcos have touted CNID
as being for individuals, the real focus has always been on commercial use as
the real money maker.

At this point, the CNID controversy boils down to the seemingly simple
question, "Since it is mandated that everyone must have per-call blocking
available, why can't per-line blocking be made available?"  Once again, I
think the reason is obvious.  Most people aren't on PBX systems that are
easily programmed to dial the three digit blocking code on each call, nor will
most people want to spend money for add-on gadgets to do this.  So the hope of
the telcos is that most people will forget or won't bother to use the per-call
code most of the time.  If per-line blocking were available (and surveys show
most subscribers would want it--people want to know who's calling, but don't
want other people to always know *their* number!) then CNID's commercial value
would be significantly lowered.

Andrew Klossner objects to the proposal to assign each phone a second unique
number solely for CNID; This would be accessible only through an 800 number.
Klossner claims this would be impractical because "Almost all area codes in
North America are more than half populated. In order to double the number of
phone numbers, most area codes would have to be split."  This does not present
a major obstacle, however.  The pseudo-number would not have to be a valid
phone number.  [This was also pointed out in a subsequent message by Scott
Preece himself.  PGN]  Such a number could fit within the existing CNID
transmission system if it utilized the same number of digits as a valid US
number (10 digits), but there are no valid 10-digit numbers beginning with 0
or 1 (20% of the numberspace), no valid 10-digit numbers with 0 or 1 as the
fourth digit (20% of the numberspace, overlooking overlap with the foregoing),
no valid 10-digit numbers with 11 as the second and third digits (reserved for
911, 411, and other service codes) (1% of the numberspace), no valid numbers
with 11 as the fifth and sixth digits (same reason) (1% of the numberspace),
no valid numbers with 00 as the fifth and sixth digits (to avoid confusion
with 800, 900, etc.) (1%), no valid numbers with 200, 300, 400, or 600 as the
leading digits, etc.  Over 40% of the numberspace is reserved, and the
remaining 60% is far from fully occupied -- only recently have a handful of
area codes with 0 or 1 in the middle been assigned (20% of the numberspace
remains relatively vacant), and likewise phone numbers with a 1 or 0 as the
fifth digit (i.e., in the middle of the NXX "exchange" group) have been
assigned only in major urban areas.  It is very unlikely that anywhere near
50% of the numberspace is actually assigned -- keep in mind that there are 10
billion unique numbers available in a ten digit numberspace.

Clearly, then, it would be technically possible for the foreseeable future to
assign each telephone number in the North American Numbering Plan a unique
second number.  This number would not be usable as a telephone number, but it
would only work through an "800" number, which would decode it.

Moreover, there is no reason why such a non-dialable number should be uniquely
assigned to each number.  The telephone companies could use the non-dialable
subset of 10-digit numbers as a pool of codes for one-time use in each area
code.  The real dialable number is actually transmitted between central
offices, but is not transmitted to the end user.  If the "privacy" bit is
toggled on, the central office could store the real number and transmit a
non-dialable number from a one-time pad, and it would only be mapped to the
real number for a limited time, such as 48 hours, if keyed into the "800"
number associated with the same telephone company and dialed from the number
that was called (i.e., from the phone that received the non-dialable number).
There is no reason for a permanent association between the non-dialable number
and the real number; in fact, that would defeat the purpose of CNID and
unpublished numbers.  Calling the pseudonumber, through the 800 gateway, would
be a one-time deal.  There's no major technical obstacle to that.

|&gt; [Don Norman] suggests that other information should be sent instead of a
|&gt; telephone number. ...

This is currently being tested by British Telecom in Edinburgh.  Subscribers
have been given the option of submitting their own identifying string (16
characters) instead of the default which is their name as it appears in the
phone book.

We're about to get calling number ID in the UK, too - from British
Telecommunication (BT) at least.  It is being promoted on the benefits to the
subscriber, e.g. "This service has already been available in North America for
some time, where it has had a major impact on malicious and fraudulent
calls.".

The fact that lines for which information has been previously withheld
(ex-directory numbers) will send information is hard to spot in the
literature!

The features listed in DIGEST 16.46 appear to have implemented, but not well
publicised - I get the distinct feeling that the service will be of most
benefit to companies who want to create lists of 'phone numbers!

We will be getting -
1. Per-line blocking - FOC, just call and ask for it.
2. Per-line unblocking - the default unless you change it.
3. Per-call blocking - dial 141 before the number you want.
4. Per-call unblocking - dial 1470 before the number you want.

1. and 2. need a phone call but it costs nothing.
3. is advertised in the literature.

BUT 4. took some discovering!  I want to block outgoing ID by default and
allow it only on certain calls (e.g. friends, certainly not businesses who
will record it, sell the lists etc.) so per-line blocking with per-call
unblocking is the answer.

This option is not mentioned in the literature, I phoned the further
information freefone number to be told that what I wanted is not possible.
Rather than give up here, as I guess most people would, I asked them to record
my requirement so that if enough other people also wanted it they might think
about providing it.  They said they'd get someone to call me back which they
did the next day.  A very pleasant call from Edinburgh from someone who knew
rather more about the system (it had been on trial in Scotland before being
introduced elsewhere).  No problem, he said, we already have what you require,
just have the line blocked and put 1470 in front of calls you want to unblock -
I'll put the line block on for you. The next day we had confirmation, by mail,
that it had been done.

So, it looks as though we will be getting a decent service (it goes live on
November 5th) - but only if you know what you want and work a little to get
the information!

I see a big RISK in "ignore all phone numbers I don't recognize".  At least
once every 6 - 12 months, I get an emergency call at my house from a friend or
family member.  The call usually comes from a pay phone, but has originated at
a business or a residential line as well.

By blocking "unknown numbers", I would have missed calls with the following
content in the past year.

- "best friend severly injured in a vehicle accident, come immediately"

- "we broke down coming back from a late nite concert, it's 0230 and
   we're stuck in the middle of a really bad section of town with no
   transportation.  can you come get us?"

- "my flight was canceled, so I caught one that arrives 3 hours earlier
   and at a different airport.  come get me before I'm bored to death!"

And, most importantly to *me*:

- "Hi, I just got your resume from a friend of yours, and we'd like
you to come in for an interview."

I ended up getting a great job from that one...

I don't see what is signifcantly gained by CNID that isn't gained by
using an answering machine to screen calls.  I do see what can be lost
by ignoring calls from numbers one does not recognize, however.

British Telecom is starting a CNID (Caller Number Identification) in the UK.
If you do nothing, your number will be sent out every time you make a call.
But if you dial 1471 (I think -- anyway, some 4 digit code) before dialling
the number you want to call, then your number will not be sent out.

Or you can ask for your number _never_ to be sent out. But in this case it is
_not_ possible to dial, say, 1472 to have your number sent out occasionally.

So if you don't particularly want to tell life insurance companies your phone
number, and if you don't trust yourself not to forget to dial 1741
double-bucky, you are put in the situation where you can never send out your
number, which will usually not matter, until the day that it does matter.

I feel that BT are not serving the needs of their domestic customers here:
CNID is great if someone you know is getting dirty phone calls, but otherwise
its main function is to benefit commercial customers. But there is nothing we
can do about it.

It would not take the database miners of the world long to build a cross
reference between user selected call number ids and the real phone numbers.
To keep off the list, you would have to never let a company associate your
real phone number with your id. This would be hard to do if you use credit
cards, mail order outfits, etc.  Also, given the penchant for phone companies
to charge a few bucks for every trivial service change, like changing an id,
the cross reference would tend to remain up to date.

Although, I should add that if people conspire to choose the same id,
like PRIVACY, we can give the marketers a real headache.

The NYT has an article about Bell Atlantic's video plans:

  Edmund L. Andrews, A launching pad for a video revolution, New York Times,
  27 October 1994, pages C1, C6 [business section].

The point of the article is that BA wants to deliver video to customers, and
is teaming up with Hollywood types to obtain the content.  The main focus for
Risks, though, is probably the privacy aspects of the scheme.  A few quotes
will probably give the idea:

  "Company executives, convinced that they must distinguish themselves from
  today's established cable programmers [and so they plan to] offer more
  customized entertainment and shopping.

  "Thus, the company has tied together a computer system that could, almost
  like Orwell's Big Brother, monitor the movies that a person orders and then
  suggest others with the same actors or themes.

  "Going a step further, the system would enable advertisers to send
  commercials directly to customers known to have bought particular kinds
  of merchandise.  Thus, people who bought camping equipment from a video
  catalogue might start seeing commercials for outdoor clothing."
  
  ... "The scale of the new center ... makes clear how serious Bell Atlantic
  is about this venture."

If this sort of thing is really what people want, of course, then that's 
their perfect right.  But advocates for other visions of technology can do
plenty to ensure that people make informed choices.  One is to inform people
(in honest but vivid terms) that their program selections and purchases are
being recorded, kept, and used for secondary purposes.  Another is to keep on
building things like the Internet and community networks, and redouble efforts
to publicize them by telling clear, powerful stories about them.  The point is
to show that privacy-enhancing and *genuinely* interactive technologies exist,
and that they are useful, accessible, democratic, entertaining and convenient.

As my colleague Francois Bar emphasizes, this sort of end-user experimentation
is crucial for defining the architectures of the future.  Bell Atlantic and
its brethren are creating top-down, privacy-invasive, 500-channel visions 
of the future -- even though they haven't worked very well in pilot tests 
in carefully selected communities -- because that's the business model 
they know.  We can try to suppress the Risks associated with this model, but 
that's like shoveling the tide back into the ocean -- a lot of work.  Another
approach to pursue in parallel is to create alternatives that offer *both*
democratic values *and* a lucrative business model for the people who can
supply the necessary infrastructure.

This process starts with experimentation and continues with public relations.
Here's a plan.  If you're doing something terrific with networks, volunteer 
to demonstrate it in your local school.  Have great stories ready to tell
about it.  Ask the kids to tell their parents.  Then write a press release.
Send it to all the newspapers and TV stations in your area -- especially the
small ones.  And make it available on the net as a model for others to follow.

A friend of mine who is from outside of the US, and who is now in
the US for graduate school, took the computer-administered version
of the GRE (Graduate Record Examination) General test last year.

The school where this individual was enrolled had a policy that allowed
accepted students in some departments to begin graduate studies prior to
having taken the GRE, so long as the GRE was then taken and passed with a
minimum aggregate score by the beginning of the second semester.  The
aggregate score was to be the total score in the verbal and quantitative
testing categories -- the other category, analytical, was not considered.

With analytical out of the picture and with this person being a non-
native speaker of Enlish, the math (quantitative) section offered
the best hope for scoring badly needed points.

With preparation, things would go fine.  The Computer-Based-Testing
option seemed perfect, because it was scheduled late in December
which allowed some vacation days for pre-test cramming, and it also
promised quick scoring, which would ensure that the results would
arrive at the school before the start of the spring semester.

When the day of the test arrived, my friend felt well prepared 
and was especially confident for the math section.

For the five-section test, the software makes a random assignment of
sections drawn from the three categories: verbal, quantatative, and
analytical.  Therefore some categories are repeated (with different
questions, of course).  With my friend's fortunes resting so heavily on the
quantitative category, naturally the computer's random algorithm chose to
assign not two, but THREE analytical sections -- the one category not
regarded by the school.  This left one verbal and one quantatative section.
(It seems strange that the computer was not programmed to choose
combinations of 2,2,1 and avoid those of 3,1,1 -- but there's more to this
story.)

The Computer-Based-Testing administration of the GRE is also known as the
"Computer Adaptive Test (CAT)," because it uses a new technique that
presents different questions of varying difficulty based on this examinee's
previous answers.  Since my friend had done a good job boning up on math,
the software, detecting a run of correct answers, began selecting more
advanced questions.  This was no problem, but it did mean that it took more
time to answer each question.  And the test had both a time limit, and a
minimum number of questions that had to be answered.

Now you see where this story is going -- when my friend had ALREADY clicked
the answer of the last required question, and was just about to click
"Confirm" with the mouse, the time expired and the screen went blank.  So
instead of a good score for answering difficult questions, or a low score
for leaving one question blank, my friend received a "No Score," or "NS."
Added to a low verbal score, this was enough to ensure that there would be
no more graduate studies for this student, at least not at the original
school.

The rest of the story:

In September 1994 a carefully hedged letter arrived from the ETS (the
Educational Testing Service, which administers the GRE).  "...We have
recently determined that it is possible that a small number of examinees who
took the [CAT] received a NS (No Score) because they were unable to confirm
an answer selection before time expired...."

The ETS offered to replace the NS with a newly calculated score based on the
completed questions.  The new aggregate score turned out to be 130 points
HIGHER than the minimum that would have been required for the student to
maintain graduate status at the school.

The offer of score adjustment is welcome, but seems to trivialize the
(already incurred) very heavy costs to the student, who had to sacrifice a
full semester of a graduate career while still being responsible for
maintaining cost of living abroad--many visitors to the US on student visas
are not allowed to work, so this was a great drain financially, in addition
to being very stressful for the student.

Compared to some of the stories we read about x-ray machines and airplanes,
this may not seem like much, but it is another reminder that as designers of
information systems we need to remember that our work affects people's
lives, and we should try to anticipate this in our designs.

AOL, now boasting 1.25M subscribers, up by a factor of more than three in
the past year, apparently cannot boast about its E-mail performance.  Yes,
it is handling something like 15 million E-mail messages a month, about 7
times any of its competitors.  But, No, it is not delivering 15 million
E-mail messages a month.  MANY MESSAGES sent to AOL are bounced back to the
senders.  Steve Outing, with 150 AOL subscribers on his discussion group,
complained of getting a few hundred bounces a day.  Message volume seems to
be overburdening AOL's Internet gateway.  AOL admits that a ``bug'' between
21 Sep and 5 Oct 1994 caused outgoing mail to ``go awry'' --- but that has
been fixed.  More recently, five-day delays have been reported for receipt
of mail on AOL.  [Source: An article by John Eckhouse in the San Francisco
Chronicle, entitled "AOL Users Find E-mail Going Undelivered", 28 Oct 1994,
p. D1.]

  [From my vantage point of sending out RISKS, AOL FINALLY provides RISKS
  (comp.risks) as a newsgroup, although most of my direct subscribers have
  not caught on yet and are still getting private subscriptions.  AOL
  apparently splits RISKS issues (normally just under 32K) into max-22K
  chunks, so perhaps one half of an issue gets through and the other half
  doesn't, which at least enables someone to realize that something is
  missing.  A reminder to AOL subscribers: Your mailbox is limited to 550
  messages, after which new incoming mail is simply rejected.
  More-than-week-old messages just vanish.  Presumably that means you should
  not use AOL if you are going to be away for more than a week, or if you
  get a lot of mail.  I presume the newsgroup stuff ages just as rapidly. PGN]

A follow-up to the backspace/delete problem I've been having with my
cut-rate internet service provider, NETCOM.

PROBLEM: Dialing the standard local NETCOM number will occasionaly give me
one server which displays ^? when I hit backspace; and in a later session,
_without_ reloading or restarting my telecom package, give me another server
with a backspace key that properly ERASEs.  I thank the avalanche(!) who
provided me with suggestions on STTY and UNIX arcania. I apologize for
resorting to form replies.  Particular thanks for info on "The UNIX Hater's
Handbook".

OBSERVATIONS:
1.) Others e-mailed me with the _same_ NETCOM problem!
2.) the duration of the blink of the SD light on my modem 
    clearly differentiates the Backspace key from the DEL key, and 
    indicates I am always sending BACKSPACE.
3.) The only thing which changes between these sessions is:
    a.) the telephone path, 
    b.) Equipment and software on THEIR end.
    c.) The modem's compressions session???

NETCOM's latest official response:
  "Sir, with all due respect, other UNIX personnel do not have the ability
to diagnose concerns about Netcom's system.  They may have experience with
differently configured Sparcs, but it's good to keep in mind that our
configuration may not necessarily be what you are used to."
  "You have repeatedly described a problem that is characteristic of
terminal software problems.  Our technical support staff has diagnosed this
kind of problem innumerable times.... it is in our opinion clear [?] that
any remaining problem is the fault of your terminal software. ... We have
concluded to our satisfaction that this is not an error on our end." [With
original a-gramatica.]  They then repeatedly tell me to put STTY ^H in my
.login, file, which they have already done WITHOUT my permission!  It does
NOT, and CAN NOT work as both my modem, and the command line clearly show
they receive the ^? code, hex 7F, "DEL"; Not ^H, 08, "Backspace"."

CONCLUSION: 
Something on NETCOM's end occasionally decides (at log-in) to map both
BACKSPACE and DEL together to the DEL code.
  The ONLY way I can fix the problem, is by typing STTY ERASE, and then
tapping the key which is, at the moment, producing the ^?  code at their
command level -- the backspace (^H) key; usually after I commit a blunder I
can not backspace out of!  I often hang up.
  The RISK of not fixing intermittent problems is having to increase your
marketing budget.  Same for not understanding English.

IMHO, the worst button-placement crime is one almost every
computer manufacturer for the last 20 years has perpetrated:
the CAPS-LOCK key on the keyboard.

Consider: this is a key which has a completely different
interface than every other key on a standard keyboard (toggle
instead of momentary contact), which performs a function almost
completely obsoleted 15 years ago (by decent text-editing and
word-processing software), and which is a factor in a number of
fiendish user-interface traps.

As an example of the latter point, consider the most common
solution around our shop to "I can't log into my account
anymore", namely, "Did you bump the CAPS-LOCK key on?"  Since
the characters of the password are (IMHO quite rightly) not
echoed, and since the password is (IMHO quite rightly)
case-sensitive, there is no obvious indication given to the user
of this error.

Another example, which has bitten me several times, is what
happens under many versions of UNIX when I inadvertently type my
login name (a single smooth motion) before realizing I have the
CAPS-LOCK key on.  The getty program (IMHO quite cleverly)
decides that I must be on an uppercase-only terminal (when was
the last time you used one of those babies?) and configures the
TTY driver accordingly.  The only ways I know of to cure this
condition are (1) type a control-D at the login process to
restart getty, or (2) get logged on (assuming that my current
password contains no uppercase characters, or that I remember to
backslash them) and type "stty -lcase" (I understand why the
parameter is called "lcase" instead of "ucase", but I'm still
amazed at the choice of name):  suffice it to say that I
consider neither method intuitive, or obvious to a novice.

Manufacturers, please: let's make this particular dinosaur extinct.

This is more of an anti-risk than a risk, but I thought a mention of the
Microsoft Natural Keyboard might be appropriate.  In case you haven't seen a
picture of it, it's an ergonomic keyboard with the left and right hand key
areas tilted in two planes for more natural hand positioning.

It was the best looking design I'd ever seen in a $99 keyboard, so I bought
one.  At the risk of being incredibly subjective, I love it.  This is one of
the nicest keyboards I have ever used.  (50th percentile hand dimensions
make me a keyboard-designers dream)

*BUT* it p***es me off that it is still a secretary's keyboard.  I
understand that it has to be as close as possible to an 1890's QWERTY
keyboard for backwards compatibility reasons, but:

The caps-lock key is where the control key *should* be, requiring an
impossible stretch of the left pinky every time a right-handed control
character is required.

A similar stretch of the right pinky past the '/" key is required to get to
the enter key.  That stretch of the pinky was fine when you only hit the
enter key every 60 characters or so, but it is (IMHO) unadvisable for
programmers, spreadsheet users, etc., who are likely to need to hit the
enter key every ten or fifteen characters.

Speaking from personal experience with a Dec keyboard I suffered
considerable hand pains from those pinky-stretching motions until I
rebound the control key on top of the physical caps-lock key and swapped
the enter and '/" keys.  The change in my hand problems was immediate and
dramatic.  [If anybody knows of a Dos/Windows way to do that rebinding
please let me know (email to me, not risks... I'll summarize if people
want).  I've tried doing it with the DOS ANSI driver but the '/" and enter
keys only seem to accept incompatible combinations of shift, control, alt,
etc. modifiers]

Anyway, on the whole I'd say Microsoft did a real nice job on the hardware
(installing the new keyboard driver software on my laptop was another
story, but we all know hardware companies rarely write good software :-)

programming one's telephone or modem to screen out unfamiliar incoming
telephone numbers.  Devices for screening out unfamiliar numbers are on the
market and may be used without subscribing to Caller ID.  These devices - or
software that does the same thing - present no privacy problems that I can

Minnesota is just introducing a new drivers license, with new security
features, as well as a bar code and a magnetic stip (with full name, date of
birth, and license number).  The photo and signature are digitized, and
presumably stored by the state as well as being printed on the card.  I
learned about the new licenses from an article in City Pages, a free weekly
here in the Twin Cities.

The new licenses are produced (for $1.29 apiece) by Deluxe (the check
printers).  About 4000 drivers had to go back to have their pictures retaken
because they were transmitted at night from one computer to another over
"incompatible phone lines" [whatever that means] and billions of bits went
"screaming into the ether".  Deluxe blames a subcontractor.

Since the magstripe can hold about 256bytes, there have been discussions
about what else might be stored there.  Things like a list of cars and guns
registered in your name, perhaps.  Or, people receiving food stamps or
welfare might use their license to obtain their benefits, either at a
food-store cashier or from an ATM.

Don Gemberling, director of MN's Public Information Policy Analysis Divison,
evidently did raise the privacy issues during the planning process, noting
that a "universal personal identifier ... has been consistently resisted in
this country".  Alice Gonzalo (assistant director of DVS, the state Driver
and Vehicle Services Division) notes that DVS already sells driver's license
information, sorted by different fields.  (One could buy a list of
Minnesotans over 6'3", for instance.)

There is already a national database of drivers with commercial licenses,
called AAMVANET, and there are plans to expand this to all drivers.
In Wisconsin, a driver's license can be suspended for failure to pay
fines unrelated to driving (like library fines).

MN dept of Administration's Bob Schroeder says
    In my opinion, the driver's license has nothing to do with driving.
    How many times have you pulled it out because an officer asked you
    for it?  You pull it out much more because someone at a store of a
    check-cashing place wants to know who you are.  It has less to do
    with driving and more to do with being a universal identifier, a
    way for you to be identified over the long term.  Business really
    relies on the state to establish this sort of identifier for them.

Computer Lied When It Said All Callers Were Winners
New Zealand's *Dominion* newspaper, 29 Oct 1994, 

The hundreds of people told they had won $100 after a glitch in the telephone
TV Trivia game last weekend will not get the money. The telephone game began
awarding $100 prizes to all callers during the weekend after a computer
glitch caused by a power surge on Sunday evening. Callers said as soon as
they pressed the number 1 on their telephones to start playing, a recorded
message told them they had won.

But News Media (Auckland), which runs TV Trivia, yesterday said it would not
pay the estimated 500 callers. The company said it was quite satisfied that
all the callers who rang the 0900 number during the weekend were aware of the
nature of the game. The company said the game involved participants using
their skill and knowledge and if they were successful, they were rewarded. It
was not covered by the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977.

It was clear the 500 callers had not been asked any questions: they did not
compete and so could not win. However, the company said it would reimburse
the callers for the cost of their calls. The Consumers Institute said the
legal issue was whether callers realised they were not playing the game
properly. If they knew there was a glitch they would not have much of a case.

I just read the section on defense in *Computer-Related Risks* and was
reminded of the following incidents:

During 1967 and 1968 I lived on Mare Island Naval Shipyard, a submarine
maintenance station just off the North end of San Francisco Bay, across a
channel from Vallejo, California.  Until recently most submarine repair
(nuclear, conventional, attack and missile) for the Pacific fleet was done
here; it has since been moved to Bremerton Washington; MINSY is being closed
down.

Sometime during 1968, the USS Gitarro (sp?) was being repaired.  The front
sonar cover was taken off, and a hatch was left open so the repair crew 
could get out to work on it.  The Gitarro was floating in the water, raised
high to expose the sonar to the air.

A test engineer, who had nothing to do with the sonar people, wished to 
perform a test of some mechanism that required the submarine to be level.
He went to the bridge (in the middle of the ship, far from the front) and
let some water in the ballast tanks at one end of the ship, until the 
submarine was level, then closed off the tank... but he neglected to consider
inertia.  The submarine continued to settle for a bit after he closed the 
valve.

He did not take the obvious route of blowing some air back into the tank.
Apparently he did not know how to raise the submarine, only lower it.
(Perhaps this was all that was given in his test plan; I don't know).
Instead, he let water in the ballast tanks at the other end.  Again he
overshot, and again, and again... until he wiggled the open sonar hatch under
the water.

Sea water came rushing in the front.  Now, this would not be such a disaster
under ordinary circumstances, as military ships are always compartmented so
that whole sections of a ship can be flooded without sinking the ship.  But
this ship was in for repair, and temporary pipelines, hoses, and power cables
had been run through the pressure hatches that were meant to close the
compartments.  Sailors tried to use fireaxes to cut through live power cables
in order to close the hatches, but to no avail: the valiant Gitarro sank to
the bottom of Mare Island Channel.

I don't know if anyone was killed or injured - I think not.  Damage was
mitigated somewhat by a quick thinking tugboat operator who saw the "sail"
starting to roll over into the water.  He rammed his tugboat up against the
sail and kept pushing against it until a floating crane was brought in the
next morning.  Even so, damage came to $30 million.

In another incident, the radioactive coolant water was being drained from a
reactor.  This submarine (not the Gitarro) was in drydock.  The usual
procedure is to cut a hole in the hull and run the water out a pipe into a
cement mixer.  The radioactive water is used to make cement and trucked to
Hanford, Washington (about 800 miles) for "disposal".

The pipe from the reactor reached out to the hull, where it was connected
via a flange to the pipe leading to the cement mixer.  Only one time they
forgot to bolt the flanges together; as the water was pumped out it showered
upon a shipyard worker walking on the drydock below.

I understand that the shipyard worker not only survived but was still working
at the shipyard during the '80s - but the clothes he was wearing at the time,
and the patch of drydock he was standing on at the time are buried at
Hanford.  Also, this fellow exceeded his lifetime allowance for radiation
exposure during this "hot shower", and is not allowed inside the nuclear
yard.

In still another incident, the above mentioned cement mixer was stolen by the
truck driver assigned to deliver the radioactive concrete to Hanford.  He was
caught - after he had used the mixer to pour a backyard patio at his house.

But wait, there's more!  The Navy contracted with a private manufacturer to
build a piece of equipment that would be installed in a room aboard a
submarine.  The Navy gave the manufacturer plans to this room.  When the
equipment was delivered, a hole was cut in the hull of the submarine, and the
equipment was lowered in by a crane.  Because submarines are very cramped
there was not much room and the designers used up every bit of available
space for their machine.  When it was lowered into the submarine, it was
found that this device did not fit!  The Navy made all sorts of accusation's
about the manufacturer's incompetence, but in the end it was found that the
manufacturer did meet the specifications; the Navy's mechanical drawing had
an error in which "1/2 inch" was written where "1/4 inch" was intended.
(Note that one of the factors that limits the life of a submarine is the
number of times holes have been cut in its hull.  After a while the hull is
weakened so much that the submarine has to be scrapped.)

And finally, a note about the circumstances in which I lived at the base, and
the importance of unambiguous language in giving commands.  I lived there at
the height of the Vietnam War, while my father was an instructor in the
antiaircraft missile school there.  I spent the third and fourth years of my
life living on a military base at the height of a war; I remember tanks
rolling by and trucks and trains loaded with bombs.  Being a small child I
regarded this with the wonder and curiousity any childhood would have for his
playground.

My parents sternly ordered me never to cross the street - but by walking some
distance down my street and crossing an open meadow, I could freely enter
the Marine Corps rifle practice range.  Being three feet tall, my friends and
I could easily walk unobserved in the culverts along the road.  I remember
watching the men firing their M16's, and one time I sat in a bunker below
the targets - one could lower a paper target into the bunker to replace it
or tally the score - watching bullet holes appear in the targets above.

The Marines did catch us, many times in fact, and always sternly warned us to
stay away, but they never did tell my parents.  I never felt I was doing
anything wrong as I did not cross the street.

I did cross the street once, though... and the next street beyond, and snuck
under the fence into the shipyard area itself, walking right past heavily
armed sentries - remember all the riots were happening in Berkeley just 20
miles away, so I'm sure they were on the lookout for saboteurs.  They just
didn't think to look for intruders that didn't reach up to their knees!  I
remember quite clearly looking up into the cranes used to lift heavy
equipment off of railroad cars, and all manner of heavy equipment that would
have ground a four-year old boy into hamburger.  [...]

  [CC of message to Doug Jones,]

I was forwarded your E-mail, which was posted in RISKS on-line.  I wanted
to comment on a few errors in your message. 

First of all, the FEC Voting "Standards" do not "mandate" anything.  These
are not standards, they are merely suggested guidelines. The guidelines are
just that because of "states rights." This is the right of states to have
certain choices in a variety of matters. There is precedent for the federal
government to mandate some things regarding voting. One of these is who can
vote (as in women, blacks, people over the age of 18). But currently the
federal government, although it oversees federal elections, does not MANDATE
any STANDARDS regarding voting machines. The FEC document you appear to have
been reading is just guidelines. Some of the states have adopted these
guidelines, and then they become a part of those states laws. But many
states have not.

Secondly, you should know that these FEC guidelines were created with
extensive assistance from voting machine vendors and other service
providers. It was in no way a balanced group. What I and others have tried
to point out in the years since the publication of these guidelines is that
there are already good STANDARDS for assuring accuracy and integrity in
computer-based systems. These standards are the "orange-book" system that
the federal government uses for other federally-used computation systems.
(Voting machines are exempt from the 1987 Computer Security Act and are not
required to conform to these standards.) Within these standards is a system
and organization for certifying secure systems at various levels. We would
hope that eventually states (or the federal government) would enact laws
that would bring voting machines into this system, and they could be
examined for conformity. The FEC guidelines fall far short of the NIST
standards, and we would like to see this changed.

I am not in any way suggesting that even the NIST standards would be
sufficient to ensure accurate and secure electronic vote tabulation.  I am
just mentioning all of this here, because you are misled regarding the
stringency of the FEC guidelines and of their application.

RISKS should be a forum for real risks, not pet peeves, not minor
inconveniences, not for harmless mistakes. I am amazed by the amount of
whining in this forum.

If you hit you Mac's power switch trying to eject your floppy, you obviously
just got your Mac, there's little of value on it, and it's unlikely that
anything damaging will *really* happen.  There is very little real risk.  You
are whining about a SELF-FIXING-PROBLEM.  You won't do it again.  And if you
do, it's called natural selection.  Stupidity is its own reward.

If you accidentally push a wrong ATM button and get out $40 when you didn't
mean to, there is NO RISK.  Just take the little envelope, deposit the $40
back in, and I'm sure you won't do it again.  And if you do, it's called
natural selection.  Stupidity is its own reward.

If these were nuclear warheads, municipal power stations, or something
important, fine.  Write about it.  But for Heaven's Sake, leave your whining
at the Gate.

Carlos McEvilly tells of his friend who was denied a semester at school
because of an interface problem with the computer-administered GREs.

While I sympathize with his friend's plight, it seems that blaming the test
administrators (ETS) seems too easy and too simple-minded.  As with other
cases, we should bear in mind that there is a system and a whole process in
place, with several opportunities for human intervention.

For example, the problem would never have been seen had the friend not
chosen to take the computerized version in order to give himself more study
time.  The risks of failure to plan in advance seem to apply here.

The college's use of the GRE score as a binary decision-making factor is
itself fraught with risks.  First off, ETS itself advises against this --
the risk of using a product in a way it was not intended to be used.
Second, my friends who are college professors all tell me that the best
predictor of how good a student someone will be is not a standardized test,
but rather the person's past performance as a student.

The college already had one semester's worth of evidence for this student's
abilities, but they ignored it -- the risk of not considering all the
evidence as well as the risk of ignoring the opinions of qualified experts.

I could go on, but let me just state my main point: We've all gotten to the
stage where when we hear a so-called explanation like "Pilot error" or
"computer error" we know to dig deeper.  We know that there are processes
involved, that there are opportunities for people to intervene, and that
focussing solely on one event/incident/problem tends to obscure other
possible causes.  But we continue to apply this kind of shallow analysis to
other situations.

In this case, while I can see the error in the ETS software as being a
contributory factor, I can hardly give it primary, let alone sole importance.

	It seems to me that one of the risks of robbing a bank is getting
killed by the guards, the security system, or the people you are taking money
from.  I am not convinced that we should try to make robbing banks safe.

Re: On-Off Switch on Macs ...

	I don't really understand this issue at all.  It seems to me the
solution is not a better on-off switch, but a better operating system.  My
Unix box doesn't seem to need an on-off switch, but every DOS, Windows, and
MAC system I have ever seen can't get along without one.

Re: Pacemaker failure ...

	I appreciate that if my pacemaker fails, I will die, but I don't
understand why that justifies not using a pacemaker.  Without it, someone who
needs it will die with P=1.  With it, they have P=.001 or whatever.  We seem
to overlook the issues of cost and probability in the risks forum when it
comes to accidental risks, and frankly, this is a big mistake.

Re: CMU course on dependable system design ...

	The description sounds interesting, but it also sounds like it
ignores a great deal.  I think that one of the problems with universities is
what we expect of them.  It has taken me many years of full time effort to
gain the knowledge I have in the fields I explore.  In a university, you get
9 hours per week (if you work hard) for 15 weeks on any particular subject.
135 hours on dependability is admirable, but that's about the same as 2-3
weeks of experience (depends on how many hours you work per week) in the
field.  Still, as a leading complainer about the lack of attention to
information protection in our educational system, I should support the CMU
initiative.  The only problem I have with the course description is that it
seemed to ignore the malicious aspects of risks in favor of accidental ones.
Of course, we certainly have a lot of accidents to worry about.

Re: The risks of reading risks

	Somehow, the news reader on this system, (tin) seems to believe that
it is the only program users should ever run.  It takes about 15 minutes to
examine every news group that has ever existed, and after offering me a wide
selection of new ones I have not previously asked not to get, finally allows
me to read the risks forum.  Of course, this process cannot be interrupted
by the normal Unix interrupt character, and there don't seem to be options
to have it simply read the risks forum and leave me alone.  Perhaps this
should be a class project at CMU's new class on dependability.  While they
are at it, they should look at the Elm email system, which insists that I
answer the same questions every time I read mail, even though I always give
the same answers.  No, there is no way to default them - or at least I
haven't found one.

In <A HREF="/Risks/16.51.html">RISKS-16.51</A> John Vilkaitis describes trying to get Netcom to understand
that his system is showing intermittent problems connecting to Netcom, and
that it is -not- failures of his "terminal software".  At the end, he
concludes,

&gt;   The RISK of not fixing intermittent problems is having to increase your

Understandable, but I suggest that the more frightening RISK is the following:

&gt; They then repeatedly tell me to put STTY ^H in my .login file, 
  which they have already done WITHOUT my permission!  

I will run the risk (no pun intended) of offending my fellow systems

<A HREF="mailto:bart@cs.uoregon.edu">bart@cs.uoregon.edu</A> (Barton C. Massey) writes of various problems with
CAPS-LOCK. There's another, even more infuriating problem that CAPS-LOCK has
a risk of creating, and already has on certain keyboards.

Under the X Window System, it is possible to remap the keyboard in any way
you choose. This includes getting rid of CAPS-LOCK altogether, or so you
might hope. I do this routinely to deal with some of the problems Barton
mentioned, by mapping it be just another control key.

This works fine at work, on a DEC keyboard. When I get home, however,
there's a problem. The keyboard on my NCD X terminal considers the "lock"
attribute of this key to be a hardware feature, and thus regardless of what
I map it to under X, it always behaves like a CAPS-LOCK in terms of latching
and unlatching. Since I map the key to be a control key, you may be able to
imagine my frustration when I accidentally press the key and find that my
emacs-editing-supported shell goes haywire as I try to type alphabetic
characters. It sometimes take me quite a while to realize why nothing I type
works.

One day, I'll figure out a better way to remap it. In the meantime, even if
we're stuck with CAPS-LOCK, please hardware types: don't make the latching
feature a function of the keyboard electronics, but leave it software
controlled, where if its broken, some of us can fix it.

While I can sympathize with the contributor who dislikes the CAPS-LOCK key
(my own keyboard has it placed cleverly just to the left of the space bar --
sure-fire sabotage), I'd like to point out that there is a growing group of
people for whom it is vital. Those are the people who don't have the
physical ability to press two keys at once.

For that reason I think CAPS-LOCK is a Good Thing and should remain standard
on keyboards.

On 10/25, Bart Massey posted an article on the risks associated with the use
of the CAPS-LOCK key on a keyboard &amp; challenged manufacturers to come up with
a better method.  Whether it's better or not can be debated, but in Japan, AT
compatible machines running bilingual (Japanese/English) DOS (called DOS/V)
have adopted a convention where, to toggle the CAPS-LOCK key, you have to
press both the Shift key &amp; the DOS/V key at the same time.  Personally, I
don't like this since it forces you to remove your hand from the keyboard to
toggle CAPS-LOCK, but, it does make it less likely that you will toggle
CAPS-LOCK by mistake, thus reducing this risk.

Just thought I'd let you know that at least somebody, somewhere has been
thinking about this issue too.

NeXT did this right in at least the revision of the keyboard I have on my
color slab.  The command key held down while hitting the shift key toggles
caps lock on/off (and toggles the LED that is in both shift keys)  That way
the control key can be in the IMHO correct place, left of the 'A' key.

An official from AOL was quoted in the San Francisco Chronicle Business

(might have been the president, I'm not sure) went on to invite the Internet
Community to "flood" AOL with mail.

Now, it's one thing to shoot your own self in the foot, but inviting the net

overloading all the routers from here to there.

It appears to be the Macintosh AOL software that has the 22K limitation on
messages which prevents seeing an entire issue of Risks at one time.  Even
so, the entire issue can be read; you just cannot keep more than about 22K
of it around at one time.  This has the unfortunate consequence that you
have to stay on-line for the time it takes to read it, rather than saving it
to a file and reading it later off-line.  The Windows AOL software does
allow one to read the entire issue at one time, and to save it to a file for
later reading.

  [Stuff on deletion deleted.  Also, clarification that comp.risks 
  came up at the same time as other newsgroups on AOL.]

AOL's newsgroup access is indeed limited (note that I had to edit the subject
heading to abbreviate America Online!), but it's not quite as bad as your
postscript made it sound.   [TNX.  PGN]

  }Or rather, it tries to.  Somehow, wherever the character 1/2 is\
  }supposed to occur, instead there is a degree sign!

As Mark Brader, the poster of the above, can intimately attest from the work
of both of us in certain international standards committees, this is a
primary area of concern when one is defining standards for font use and
especially font/glyph substitution. Our classic example in our ISO committee
was of the American who sends in a bid on a bit of business in the UK, only
to have his electronically-transmitted bid (these are the fast-moving '90s,
after all) printed out with the '$' replaced by the UK pound symbol. Quite a
hefty automatic bid increase, that one.  Curtis Jackson

RTw 11/04 0417  S. Korea says slim chance hacker got nuclear data

	By David Brunnstrom

	SEOUL, Nov 4 (Reuter) - The South Korean atomic energy 
	institute said on Friday there was a slim possibility 
	a teenage British computer hacker stole secret nuclear 
	data from its computer system.
 
	The Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) said 
	it was investigating possible damage to its system after 
	a report in the Washington Times newspaper on Thursday 
	[94.11.03] which said the hacker managed to access it 
	recently.

The article goes on to make the following key points:

o	"James Christy, director of computer crime investigation at the U.S.
Air Force's office of special investigations," speaking "at a conference on
global organised crime convened by Washington's Center for Strategic and
International Studies," said that "Data Stream" was a 16 year old in
Britain.

o	The youth cracked a system at the Rome Air Development Center at
Griffith Air Force Base in Rome, New York state.

o	He copied files from the "South Korean Atomic Research Institute
(sic)" to the disks on the Rome system.    [SKARI?]

o	The youth "curled up into a foetal position and cried when" the
British police arrested him.

o	KAERI officials said that technical information "such as that on
reactor systems and fuel rod design" was "stored separately from other data
and protected by multiple passwords."

o	"Chung Joon-keuk, director of public information at the
institute,....said .... it was still not clear whether the institute
referred to in the Times was in fact KAERI and it was possible the article
should have referred to the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI)."

UPn 11/04 1054 College blocks computer sex access

	PITTSBURGH, Nov. 4 (UPI) -- Carnegie Mellon University
	of Pittsburgh said Friday it will block access on its 
	campus computer system to sexually explicit material 
	available on the worldwide computer network called 
	the Internet.

	Carnegie Mellon officials said they are acting out of 
	concern that the university could by subject to 
	prosecution under Pennsylvania's pornography and
	obscenity laws.

The article goes to to explain that University spokespersons admit they will
be "be accused of stifling free expression" but feel that the risks are too
high, especially since children can easily access these materials.  The
decision was said to have been difficult and painful for the administrators,
who strongly support the tradition of academic freedom.  The decision was
criticized by a student spokesperson, who compared it to banning books.

[Comments by MK:

The anonymity of the Internet will continue to cause difficult problems
related to access by children.  Right now, the response of well-meaning
administrators and others is to put blanket restrictions on everyone so as
to prevent unsupervised use of the Internet by minors.

Imagine a world where no one had developed the concept of an ignition key
for automobiles.  We can imagine well-meaning highway administrators
concerned with access to the high-speed transportation infrastructure
exclaiming, "Gosh, but with these highways and cars, children could travel
to (gasp) brothels and pigsties!  They could see things that their parents
would never want them involved in."  And so the highway administrators would
shut down roads in an attempt to prevent access to bad places by children.

In both the real world and this imaginary world, these difficulties are
caused by the lack of identification and authentication in accessing the
highways.  In the real world, we have ignition keys for automobiles and
severe penalties for stealing automobiles or driving without a permit.  We
have no accepted standards for access to networks.

Parents who are concerned about access to a network by their children could
take the responsibility of locking their computers or their modems.
However, that's a pretty crude approach too--all or nothing.  And what about
the children's independence and growth?

There are already devices available for controlling access to television;
parents program the times, channels and duration of viewing permitted for
their children, who punch in a PIN to gain personally-tailored access to the
TV.  Maybe as Internet access grows, there will arise sufficient interest
and demand for menu systems for access to the Internet.  Parents could
select the sections of the Internet which they wish to allow for their
children; children and parents could explore the Internet together and add
or remove destinations and newsgroups as they see fit.

Right now, CompuServe has access to Internet newsgroups.  The administration
has settled on a middle ground in restricting access to the Internet by
limiting the _listings_ of newsgroups.  In fact, however, if someone already
knows the name of a newsgroup, they are free to subscribe even if it isn't
listed.

I think that we have to move beyond a crude TOTAL ACCESS / NO ACCESS
dichotomy in regulating access to the Internet.  We need finer granularity
in our restrictions so that we don't infringe on the rights of adults.

A final note.  In a recent thread on the NCSA FORUM on CompuServe, there was
a discussion about whether there were mechanisms for restricting BBS and
Internet access by children.  I answered, "Yes--one is PARENTAL
RESPONSIBILITY."]

Another one for the "date-dependent" bugs collection:

Last month, all five hundred or so Fujitsu model SRS-1050 ISDN display
phones here at Prodigy suddenly stopped their clocks at 11:59 PM September
30.  [Typoed 31 fixed.  PGN] The problem seems to be that the built-in clock
on the phone freezes when trying to roll over into the first day of a
two-digit month.  Resetting the clock/calendar to the current date and time
fixes the problem until the next month rolls around.  While the clock is in
its "stuck" state, the "message waiting" light will never go on, no matter
how many voice mail messages are waiting for you (you still get the
"stutter" dial tone, though).

These phones were newly installed in December of last year -- their EPROMS
are dated November 1993.  Apparently this bug crept in around then and has
been installed in all Fujitsu phones of that model since.  I'm told the
manufacturer will need to replace tens of thousands of EPROMs in the field
for their various business customers who have deployed these phones.  The
new EPROMs will be tested by an outside company before being delivered to
the customers.  Until then, we need to manually reset our phones on November
1 and December 1.

Previous RISKS reports of date bugs were usually overflows of 16 or 8 bit
quantities -- is this a new record in lower limits?

Since my original post concerning Sears now digitizing signatures when
you sign a credit card slip, bunches of people :-) have sent me Email,
either asking for elaboration on the risks involved, or adding anecdotes
of their own. I'll attempt to describe the potential risks as I see them.

Summary of previous post:

Sears in my area has recently started asking for people to sign their 
credit card receipts while the receipts are on what is obviously a small
digitizing pad. Sears doesn't make it obvious that this is the function of
the device. 

You can refuse to sign on the tablet. They'll probably have to 
call someone first to OK it.

Potential Risks of digitized signatures:

Capturing the act of signing gives the store more information than 
simply scanning a copy of a signed receipt would. In addition to the basic
image of the signature, the tablet can also effectively record stroke 
information (direction of strokes, and possibly, pressure of strokes).
This is important, because given stroke information, it is almost trivial
to write a program to fake a signature with a pen plotter. Simply use
the stroke points as control points for spline curves. Said control
points can then be perturbed slightly to yield what appears to be the 
same signature STYLE, without being a direct copy of an existing signature.

Of course, Sears wouldn't do anything so stupid. However, once the data is
available, a disgruntled or entrepeneurial employee could sell the data to
other parties. Let's see. Bill Gates goes to Sears and buys a screwdriver on
his credit card. How much is his signature potentially worth on the market?
Or, (for the really paranoid :-) ), some government agency, say, DEA, known
to be overzealous at times, decides to "apply" your signature to some
incriminating evidence...

I don't believe Sears (and others mentioned) can perform dynamic signature
verification on the fly. They can't possibly have that horsepower at
the terminal (at present). Even simple credit card number verification
takes 30 seconds or more. Imagine the complexities of looking up one
of N million signatures, correlating it to the new sample, then issuing
a go/no-go response in a reasonable time frame. The closest approximation
to this so far is the Apple Newton handwriting recognition. It looks in
a small (10k words) dictionary, has to be trained to your writing style
over time, and still screws up often enough to cause some headaches.
How tolerant is your customer base to having their charges denied when
they KNOW they wrote a valid signature?

More importantly, what REASON can Sears have for wanting this information?
I proposed that they can't do anything useful with it yet, so why should
we let them have it? Further, to the best of my knowledge, no credit card
provider requires card owners to supply digitized signature information
when initiating a transaction. My understanding is that, per the card issuer
agreement with the merchant, the merchant CANNOT require ANY other identifying
information, assuming they get an approval code from the card issuer.
Keep in mind, you don't even SIGN a receipt for a mail-order purchase...
Why should we let Sears et al digitize our signatures?

One limited use of a digitized signature could be to display a specimen of 
your signature on POS terminal so the clerk can compare with your receipt.
Of course, that is supposedly what the signature on the back of the card
is for (among other things)...

One responder mentioned that if the customer was signing paper on top of a
tablet, it was unlikely that much information could be captured beyond
stylus pressure. This is incorrect. I developed high-end CAD software for
civil engineering and land planning for many years. All of the digitizers we
used were capable of capturing positional information through quite a number
of layers of vellum, mylar, and/or paper. This was necessary because much of
engineering work involves tracing existing maps or drawings.

Several responders stated that they had run into similar digitizers at Sears,
Service Merchandise, and others. A few stated that my example of refusing
to sign had encouraged them enough to "just say no" :-) next time.

I'm not trying to be paranoid, but I attempt to see all of the angles when
confronted with a situation as described above. I operate under the rule
that unless you can give me an extremely good reason why I should give you
some class of information about me, you don't get it. Numerous posts to
RISKS have documented how quickly and easily information about someone is
disseminated, and how difficult it is to correct misinformation, once it
gets spread. I attempt to minimize acquisition of the information as a
preemptive measure.

*City Pages*, a great free news weekly here in the Twin Cities (Minnesota
USA), recently had an article [1] chock full of privacy issues and
implications of the new Minnesota driver license (not "driver's" but
"driver" on our license).  I approached the article with deep suspicions
about a new card, and came away only slightly less suspicious.

The old license has been the same for 25 years.  It has a picture, a license
number and some personal information (address, height, weight, signature,
birthdate, etc.).

  .. [O]fficials were tired of the ease with which the old card could
  be forged and altered.  In early 1990, local police officials uncovered 
  a forgery ring in the Twin Cities that used fake Minnesota licenses to 
  open bank accounts and pass close to $1 million worth of bad checks.

To make it harder to forge, the new card is printed in several fonts and the
location of your (digitized and stored) picture depends on your age.  For
the information age, there is a barcode with your driver license number, and
a magnetic stripe that can contain three lines of about 80 characters each,
currently slated to contain a person's full name, date of birth, and driver
license number.

The article raises a plethora of issues, some of which follow.  I have
hastily tried to put them into categories, which unfortunately overlap.

INFORMATION HANDLING RISKS

- The state government assumes that the public should trust government
agencies with these technologies.  This resulted in a lack of public
discussion or input because the government did not publicize the new
card proposal.  The article gave an example I had not heard why we
should not trust government: upon dishonorable discharge from the US
military, it assigned a code which potential employers and others
could get.  257 meant "unfitness, homosexual acts," 261 was
"psychiatric or psychoneurotic disorder," 287 was "unclean habits
including venereal disease," and 289 "unsuitability, alcoholism."

- Currently, the Driver Vehicle Services (DVS) department makes all
their information public except social security number and medical
information.  That is, registration and title info, driving records,
and the personal information from your license.  The state sells it
("provides it for a fee"), and currently has 600 online accounts
(presumably customers buying the information).  They can sort by age,
area, or size of person, for example.

- The card is a universal identifier, a notion often reviled in RISKS.

- The article mentions a national database of 7 million commercial
drivers (only truckers?) called (and operated by) AAMVANET which went
online January 1989.  It contains each person's name, date of birth,
social security number, and physical descriptors.  "It was mandated by
the federal government because truckers were getting licensed in
multiple states to avoid suspensions."  Barry Goleman is the president
of AAMVANET, Inc., a subsidiary of the American Association of Motor
Vehicle Administrators.  "Goleman says that in the future, the system
will include all drivers-- currently a total of 160 million,
nationwide."

- The license may be linked to issues unrelated to driving.  In
Wisconsin, your license may be suspended for failing to pay public
fines.  The article's example is a late book fine at the public
library.

RISKS OF SUDDENLY SWITCHING TECHNOLOGIES

- The company producing them (Deluxe Check Corporation, big in
Minnesota) promised quicker turnaround for new licenses, but their
digitizing cameras overheated, and their incompatible transmission
protocols lost about 4000 new pictures which have to be retaken.

RISKS OF MAGNETIC STRIPES

Goleman (see above) said "upward of" 22 states have magnetic
stripe-reading technology for driver licenses already.

- You, the card holder, cannot easily read the magnetic stripe to
ensure that there are no mistakes because a special machine is
required.

- Businesses could modify credit card readers to read the license
stripe "ostensibly to verify ID" and build databases of shopping
habits and personal information.

- Minnesota businesses are trying to get extra information put on the
magnetic stripe.

- A state group proposed distributing AFDC (welfare) money.  The
article hypothesized the card could be used (say) to track your
location.

Comments:

At first, I was impressed with the fact that all information in the
barcode and magnetic stripe would also be visible on the card.  In
other words, no hidden information.  However, other points listed
above drained away my relief.

I noted a fatalism about the article: it catalogued frightening
consequences without proposing solutions or interviewing privacy
experts.  This seems typical of even good journalism these days.

So are there simple guiding principles about the use of information
for a driver license?

Would it be a good idea to pass a law requiring cash machines to be
able to display (for free) any information on a magnetic stripe given
the appropriate PIN #?

How else can we solve the problems above?

&gt;IMHO, the worst button-placement crime is one almost every
&gt;computer manufacturer for the last 20 years has perpetrated:
&gt;the CAPS-LOCK key on the keyboard.

This "risk" is made worse by the fact that different interfaces cause users
to hack their way back to familiarity.  We're currently having that problem
at work, because our three-member UNIX team was imported intact from a
SPARCstation shop to an HP-UX shop.  SPARC keyboards have the caps lock in
the "standard" position, while HP's stick the caps lock in the CTRL position
and the CTRL key beneath the shift key (standard PC configuration).  And
each of us have addressed this in different ways.  One user has learned the
new keyboard, one user has simply switched the internal mapping for CTRL and
CAPS using xmodmap (without relabelling the keys), and the third switched
the mapping while also moving the ESC and a couple of other keys.

The end result is that we can't use each other's machines without sacrificing
as much as 25% efficiency (UNIX and vi being as CTRL-driven as they are).
We have yet to see a case where this caused an unrecoverable disaster, but
it's surely just a matter of time.

		REQUEST FOR DISCUSSION (RFD) SCI.ENGR.SAFETY

Name		: sci.engr.safety
Status		: unmoderated
Distribution	: World
Summary		: Safety of Engineered Systems
Proposed by	: <A HREF="mailto:rathinam@ins.infonet.net">rathinam@ins.infonet.net</A> (Sethu R Rathinam)

Proposed Charter:

This newsgroup is being proposed as an open forum to discuss safety issues
of systems built by humans.  All aspects of safety relating to the risk of
(or actual) loss of human life, loss of non-human life and/or property fall
within this charter.  Safety issues and concerns relating to all phases in a
product's life cycle as well as discussions of Regulatory Issues and System
Safety Processes and Software issues relating to safety fall within this
charter as well.

Since various Engineering disciplines are involved, it is recommended the
subject line be a clear reflection of the subject matter.  Factual posts and
informed discussion is encouraged and speculation should be kept to a
minimum.

Rationale:

There is presently no group with a primary focus on safety, though various
newsgroups discuss safety issues within the (relatively narrow) scope of
that group.  A more focussed group for safety will help people from one
discipline have more visibility to safety issues and practices of other
disciplines.

Other:

Newsgroup line "All aspects of Safety of Engineered Systems" 

Cross Postings:

  [This RFD is cross posted to many others.  Please excuse duplication.]

Voting process

This is the Request For Discussion.  There will be a 30 day discussion period
(discussion will happen in news.groups - followup is set correctly, so if you
follow-up to this message, your posting will appear in news.groups).  This RFD
may be modified incorporating suggestions, if required, during this period.  If
there is no serious disagreement, a Call For Votes (CFV) will be issued by a
third party.  The CFV will last between 21 and 31 days (as announced by the
third party vote taker).  Please follow the instructions of the vote taker when
we get to that point in time.  For the group vote to pass, there should be 100
more YES (create) votes than NO (don't create) votes AND at least two thirds of
the valid votes are in favor of creation of the group.

          THE INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS  
     2ND CONFERENCE ON THE MATHEMATICS OF DEPENDABLE SYSTEMS (MDS 95) 
             4-6 September 1995 University of York, England 

                   ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS 

The construction of dependable systems, by which we mean systems providing
high levels of reliability, availability, safety and/or security, is a
problem of considerable concern to both providers and users of information
processing systems of all types.  Historically, different aspects of system
dependability (e.g. reliability and security) have been studied quite
independently, albeit that many of the goals are similar.  For example, the
notion of certifying functionality assurance levels applies equally to
reliable systems and secure systems.  In addition, users will often require
some combination of security and fail-safe operation.
  
The purpose of MDS 95 is to consider the mathematical aspects of the
provision of dependable systems, one goal being a comparison and possible
unification of mathematical techniques for providing safe, reliable and
secure systems.  A number of different mathematical approaches have been
taken to the overall problem, including probabilistic/statistical reasoning,
formal models of safe, secure and reliable systems and logics of
authentication and access control/privilege delegation.  Papers on all these
areas are solicited, the unifying theme being the application of
mathematical techniques to the overall dependability problem.  Hence papers
will be particularly welcome which cross-fertilise the application domains.
The conference will consider dependability for both hardware and software
systems.
  
PROGRAMME &amp; PROCEEDINGS The conference will consist of three days of
presentations by contributing authors.  The programme will also include
invited lectures by prominent researchers and practitioners in dependable
systems theory and practice.  Time will be made available for discussions.
A digest of papers will be available to participants during the meeting and
the proceedings will be published after the conference.
  
INVITED SPEAKERS Monsieur P Chapront (GEC Alsthom, France), Professor J
Knight (University of Virginia, USA) and Professor D L Parnas (McMaster
University, Canada).
  
SUBMISSIONS Five copies of complete papers (in English) should be sent to
Mrs Pamela Bye, Conference Officer, The Institute of Mathematics and its
Applications, 16 Nelson Street, Southend-on-Sea, Essex, SS1 1EF, England
(Tel. +44 702 354020, Fax +44 702 354111, Email <A HREF="mailto:imacrh@v-e.anglia.ac.uk">imacrh@v-e.anglia.ac.uk</A>) by
31st March 1995.  Authors will be notified of the outcome of their
submission by 26th May 1995.  Revised manuscripts will be due by 14th July
1995.  Papers must not exceed 6,000 words in length (with full-page figures
counted as 300 words).  Each paper should include a short abstract and a
list of keywords for subject classification.  All papers will be refereed
and the final choice will be made by the programme committee on the grounds
of relevance, significance, originality, correctness and clarity.  Submitted
papers must not be published or be under consideration for publication
elsewhere in the same or similar form.
  
PROGRAMME COMMITTEE    Programme Chair : V Stavridou (Royal Holloway,
University of London), D Gollmann (Royal Holloway, University of London),
M Ingleby (British Rail Research), J Jacob (University of York), N Jefferies
(Vodafone Ltd), B Littlewood (City University), R Shaw (Lloyd's Register),
B Wichmann (National Physical Laboratory).
  
LOCATION The conference will be held at the University of York, a modern
campus built around a lake with excellent facilities.  The campus is two
kilometers from the centre of the medieval walled city of York, and 60
kilometers from the North Yorkshire coast.  The city is also well placed for
the Pennines and Yorkshire Wolds. York is very well connected by rail to
London, Edinburgh and Manchester and the nearest airports are Manchester and
Leeds/Bradford.

With the recent change back from daylight savings time, we can always expect
the usual havoc caused by lousy operating systems that aren't smart enough
to know how to switch time automatically. Of course, this issue has been
discussed here before, so what happens at this location here may or may not
be of particularly exciting news.

Anyway, there is a card-key system that locks up a certain development
facility between 5pm amd 8am. The system is run by one of the aforementioned
lousy operating systems that is not smart enough to change the time
automatically. So, for a few days each fall the facility is unlocked and
locked early, and for a few days each spring the opposite occurs; until
somebody bothers to report it to the right person who has control over the
system. I'm not sure which is worse -- the security risk of having an
unlocked facility, or the annoyance factor in being unable to get into the
building without the right key-card.

Fortunately, most of the systems I have to deal with are Unix boxes, which do
set the time correctly. I wonder why other operating systems are so far behind?

About two months ago I reserved a book at my local library. The library has
gone electronic in its reservation system.  You reserve a book, and when
your turn to receive it comes due a computer dials your home phone number.
If an answer occurs, it assumes you heard the message; if you do not pick up
the book in three days, you are fined $2.00.

Basically, this is what happened to me. Their computer called my number and
the phone went off hook, starting the meter running. For some reason my
answering machine did not pick up the message (I have an answering machine
and a fax modem hanging off the same line, but the fax modem is outgoing
only).

The RISK here is obvious, and I consider it nontrivial.  The librarian
insisted that the "system" is "reliable" and "almost always" works. Well, my
knowledge of datacomm says that if it does not always work it is not
reliable, and that they are fining people based on an assumption that the
message was received.

What's scary was the attitude of the librarian. Because she was told by
someone that the system works, she insisted that I had received the call. I
asked her for proof of that and she said that "the system said you got the
call, it must be true".  My attempt to describe the essence of data
communications and reliable communication fell on deaf ears, and she refused
to give me the name of her superior because "the system works and nobody
should complain about it."

Well, I am. I know that it is only two bucks, but the implications that
arise from misuse or overly trusting such a system are worrysome. What if
the government started issuing parking tickets or summonses in this manner,
or banks warning you of surcharges on financial transactions?  What if my
wife answered the phone and the book was "how to handle infidelity in you
marriage" :) (it wasn't).

So how do you handle two things:

 [One] An unreliable delivery system being assumed to be reliable.
 [Two] People placing trust in such a system.

                   Troubles with Tele-Phoney Systems

     Getting a wrong-number call in the middle of the night from another 
human can be irritating.  We may hope that future telephone numbers 
incorporate a check digit to reduce these errors, but I doubt they will.  
     But let us first look at our "Telephone Neighborhood".  Do you have 
any idea who or what exists in the 62 or so valid telephone numbers only 
a slip of the digit away from yours?  (Area codes brings it up to about 
80, but they are less often dialed.  Another problem.)  Apparently I 
have several interesting entities in my telephone neighborhood. And with 
most calls being dialed by embedded microprocessors and computers these 
days...
     What prompts this observation?  Funny you should ask that...
     On Friday, after the close of business for the weekend, (as in, when
else?!) I began receiving a strange series of persistent wrong number calls
from one gentleman in my area code.  As I answered, I would hear the
"musique de telephon" of another ten-digit number being dialed.  Although
apologetic, the caller insisted he was trying to reach several very
different numbers in two adjacent area codes.  Soon others joined him in
reaching out and touching me with a number of different touchy toney loony
tunes, complaining that I was not the party of their choice; then retrying
the process with more diligence, and sometimes more stridence.  But no
matter the area code or number they dialed, they all rang my phone.
     Some investigation on my part revealed they all originated from the 
same place, an apartment complex in a nearby city with a new PBX (Private 
Branch Exchange,) telephone system. To save the dwellers money, (or to 
line their coffers some more,) management had contracted with a private 
(discount) telephone and cable company called "Western Telephone and 
Television" (WTT) for a PBX with a feature called "least cost call 
routing."  The physical PBX is a 6 x 4 x 2.5-foot box containing twin 
680x0 processors for redundancy, each with its own hard drive, and each 
running a proprietary operating system called CORTELCO.  The box can 
handle up to 500 telephone lines, although only approximately 300 lines 
were hooked up at that particular site. 
     Under normal circumstances, this PBX is programmed to quietly intercept
the dialed number, dial a five-digit access code (a 10-xxx number) on one of
several outgoing lines, and when the access number goes off hook (answers),
echo the number that the customer dialed; whereupon the long distance
service provider takes over.  However at this particular location, a
five-digit access code was not available, and so a full seven-digit access
code had to be used.  In other words, the system simply forwarded all calls
to another ordinary-looking phone number.  Unfortunately, the technician
inadvertently entered _my_ phone number while correcting a previously(!)
erroneous number.
     Hence, all long distance calls placed from that apartment complex 
rang through to my number starting at 6pm Friday evening.
     This prompts some interesting observations:
     1. No caller ID is transmitted with the call, 
     2. There is no handshaking between PBX and the service provider.
     3. Audio is immediately enabled upon completion of number dialed.
Speculations:
     1. All accounting probably resides in the PBX
     2. Most billing info and programming is done via modem.
     3. Anyone with the seven digit access code...
            ...has unlimited free telephone service.
Kind of makes you wonder what the fraud rate is in this industry, and how
much is added to the average telephone bill to offset it. (No, I did not ask
what number the computers were trying to call or I'd be their prime suspect!)
     Of course, once awakened, Murphy did not stop there.  WTT's emergency
pager number had been _Disconnected_. Nor could Pacific Bell Information
find any local phone number for WTT.  When I finally got the correct number
from the apartment manager and called WTT, their automated attendant / voice
mail system kept telling me to dial 0 for their operator (receptionist),
then complained this and other automatically suggested extension numbers,
were not valid.  Whereupon the default error message, of course, again
instructed me to dial 0 for the operator.  (This kind of looping appears
rather common in corporate automated attendant systems.)  Eventually some
error count was exceeded and at least _this_ computer had the sense to hang up.
     The RISK of not checking your telephony systems for message loops, old
numbers, etc. is looking like a corporation of idiots.  Not to mention a
telephone company not having a publicly listed telephone number!  [I think
we now might understand WHY!  PGN]
     (My favorite ploy in the case of such loops and lockouts, is to look
for a Smith or Jones in their audio telephone directory, and inform him that
his company is losing thousands of dollars in sales because the telephone
system will not let callers speak to a human being; then ask he pass my
number on to an appropriate party.  Few ever bother.  They must think it's
not their job to help their company be profitable.)
     Finally, The local Bell Systems affiliate repair service (good old
611) told me that the RISK of harassing innocent telephone subscribers, as
they agreed WTT's automated equipment was clearly doing, was having
telephone service to their equipment, and thus the entire apartment
complex, disconnected.  (Probably by Monday...)
     But of course, Murphy being who he is, Repair could do nothing right
now. And in retrospect, they really could not do much.  Repair directed me
to several different Pacific Bell departments, each with its own 800 number,
but all of which had an identical automated voice issuing identical
instructions.  The RISK of using identical messages (computer voice
screens?) is having customers think they are reaching the SAME number.  For
all I know, I may have been!  Eventually, the chain of "if you have... then
call 1-800-..." messages, which are heard after one finds one's situation is
not on the menu, reached a recorded message informing me to call the local
police to handle the situation.
     Is the RISK of having electronic equipment becoming deranged, with no
obvious "OFF" switch, having it SHOT by law enforcement officials?
Something equipment designers really ought to think about!
     After numerous complaint calls to the apartment manager, WTT, and
Pacific Bell by apartment residents, Pacific Bell, the apartment manager,
and myself, a WTT technician entered another set of access codes into the
system.  The calls ceased shortly before noon, Saturday.  I received a long
and very apologetic call from the technician.  We ended up discussing the
operational details of the PBX.  The technician also checked the voice-mail
looping problem and reports they will have to completely reconfigure their
company office's automated attendant system to avoid the "dial operator"
loop problem.

               The RISKS of Busy Telephone Neighborhoods

     The people at the Misdialing Gardens Apartments were more polite than
those involved when Coca Cola published my number as their in-warranty
emergency repair number three years back.  Now I say that I can fix almost
anything (and often do), but those people insisted I fix their Coca Cola
machines _Right_NOW_For_FREE since soda was usually spewing forth onto the
carpet, etc.  Complaints to Coca Cola Corp.'s headquarters met with
Persistent Insistence that my number was Indeed _The_Correct_Number_ for
their in-warranty repair service.  They kept looking it up in their
corporate directory and their computers, and telling me it "The computer
says that _IS_ The Correct Number, so stop bothering us!"  (I couldn't seem
to get a VP's secretary to understand the true nature of the problem.  And
of course, she would NOT pass me on up the line because _I_ was
_Obviously_Wrong_.)  After a few go-arounds like that with Coca Cola's
Headquarters, I just gave up and chanced my number to an unlisted number
without a forwarding reference.  It only cost me several hundred dollars to
change stationary and notify all my clients...
     ... Some of whom had recently changed their fax numbers...  And 
since I usually set up a computer to send these overnight...  Well, I 
guess I just had all those "favors" returned this past week end!

                      The ADVANTAGE of Call Return

     I still get calls at all hours, but not as often; the present phoney
phone callers all hang up when they hear a human answer, making one think of
burglars trying to see who is home, or the odd former acquaintance,
ex-spouse, or ex-employee who might have traded a few marbles for some lead
pellets.  When I ordered call return to investigate this problem, the
Pacific Bell representative told me to call these phoney callers back and
say "I am working with" (not for) "the telephone company to determine why
people call this number."  The responses revealed that my current number in
the slipped digit neighborhood of a touch-tone-based Automatic Bank
Information system.  If I politely return those phoney phone calls, I can
keep the number of calls down to two or three a month as opposed to the
original three or four a week.  (Not to mention retain my peace of mind!) I
guess people do learn.
     Don't call me, I won't call you!  Please!

     Several individuals have commented that someone less ethical might have
set up one of those $95.99 voice mail cards to ask for the caller's account
and PIN numbers, then apologize for the rest of the computers being
unavailable.  In effect, a telephonic analog of a terminal with a phony
login screen.  Which reminds me of...

              The RISK of Borrowing Time Sharing Programs

     Back in college, some twenty two years back (seems like yesterday!), I
had been assigned the task of catching a student who was using a phony log
in-screen to steal account numbers on CPS, the time-sharing system which ran
on UConn Research Computer Center's IBM 360.  CPS (Conversational
Programming System) was an interactive PL/1-like variant of BASIC. In one
evening, I was able to cobble together parts of a utility program I was
writing to create a 1,400-line PL/1 program which performed a brute force
search over the CPS saved program hierarchy for the word "login".  (Not so
easy since CPS used its own file format, saving programs and data in
tokenized form; but my utility already scanned comments for expiration
dates.)
     It turned out that the offending programs were saving themselves with
the captured login data stored in arrays.  As in interactive BASIC, the
miscreant could query these arrays without executing the programs
themselves.  I "de-initialized" the arrays and subtly damaged the programs.
An "On Error" statement was used to activate a few new lines near the end of
the program to message the main operations console whenever the programs
were either run OR the now invalid array elements were queried.
     Several nights later, I arrived just in time to join two other staff
members as they ran across campus to catch an unexpected second miscreant.
She later managed to convince the powers that be that she was not The Real
Miscreant; but had "merely borrowed a program to see how it worked." I
always wondered about that.  Did you really do it, Ellen?  Or was it really
the other fellow?
     The RISK of stealing time-sharing programs is stealing Booby Traps.

     First, I'd like to disagree with Mr. Carasso's belief that user
confusion due to a lack of standards in control layout is "stupidity". It's
very easy for users to develop an automatic patterns for some frequently
performed operation, and then repeat that pattern in a circumstance where it
is not appropriate. For instance, I've developed a habit of hitting
Control-X Control-C y to exit emacs and confirm it's "Save file foo? (y or
n)" prompt. Then I went to use an editor that, upon exit, prompted something
like "File foo not saved - really quit? (y/n)" My fingers were running the
emacs pattern and hit "y", thinking that that meant to perform the save,
when in fact it meant to exit without saving. I can very easily imagine a
long time PC user whose fingers get ahead of his brain, confuse the floppy
eject with the power switch, and shut the machine off.

     I'd also like to question his assumption that if you made such a
mistake, you "obviously just got your Mac, there's little of value on it,
and it's unlikely that anything damaging will *really* happen." It seems to
me that to properly assess the risks of such a situation, one should always
assume a worst-case scenario.

     So what kind of "what-ifs" can we add to this situation?

     In the worst case, safety critical equipment might be controlled by
that Mac. (Yes, we know that there should be a protective cover over that
switch in such a case, but I'll bet you a nickel there's a system out there
right now that could hurt someone if such down at the wrong time and is
without such a cover.) That's a obvious risk.

     Less obvious is the possibility of losing very important data. To take
an example from my own experience, I was forced to do my first extensive
Macintosh work (aside from some light word processing at an old job) for a
robotics class Programs were compiled on the Mac and downloaded to the
controller board. We saved our work on floppies so we could move the work
between any one of several Macs. 

     Much of the work (at least for my team) turned out to be trial-and-
error setting of various constants. It might take a dozen compile-download-
test cycles to find a good value for one such constant. I can just imagine
the horror, the wailing, and the gnashing of teeth had one of us gone to
swap floppies to save some bit of work and, operating on auto-pilot (as is
known to happen when you're working at some ungodly hour to meet a
deadline) hit the power switch and sent that work to the bit bucket.

A few months ago I responded to a similar issue on another mailing list. As
a parent, I can appreciate the problems with adding to the burden of
parental responsibility in presenting one more threat we must shield our
children against.

The real question is how to prepare children for a world in which censorship
is not viable -- how to make them better participants in a world rich in
information and sleaze. Which is which is often a matter of personal
opinion.  Ultimately they will have to make the judgment of how to handle
it.

I realize that there are lots of issues here and that the mere presence of
objectionable materials does open organizations up to harassment suits. But,
ultimately, this country has made a bet that open access to information is
the better option. Other countries have more or less censorship on various
issues and are no longer across a wide ocean.

This does mean that one (as a parent, educator, whatever) needs to try to 
teach that not all information available is valid or representative of the 
real world.

But some information can be real and disturbing. At one point while I was in
elementary school, I had a great fear of news -- especially international
news. Considering that it was in the 50s and duck and cover was a part of
the curriculum and one standard topic was how big an H-bomb it would take to
reach our school if it landed (precisely?) at Columbus Circle in New York,
this was not totally irrational.

But is it better to grow up in a world unprepared, without an immune system?

"Mich Kabay [NCSA Sys_Op]" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:75300.3232@compuserve.com">75300.3232@compuserve.com</A>&gt; wrote of attempts to
resolve the problem of access by children to possibly unsuitable sexual
material in certain USENET newsgroups.  I would like to respond, as a
seemingly responsible parent, with some examples of real parental controls,
and real parental concerns about this issue.  In our case the family MODEM
is hardwired to a separate local-only phone line, somewhat reducing the
scope of possible teenage computer activities, but Internet is another
matter.  I have applied suitable access limitations to my son's AOL
sub-account, and my kids are never allowed any visual access to my
passwords.  My kids have also freely discussed these issues with me, and can
be expected to understand them to the degree that they are willing to
understand them.  To that extent I don't worry about my kids and their
activities.  I am concerned however, with the very real problem of adult
human "predators" who seek out congregating kids, whether it be outside the
neighborhood convenience store or on the Net.  It is a mistake to think that
"good", intelligent kids can necessarily resist or even be aware of the
attempts of an experienced adult "predator" to do them harm.  This is why I
remain concerned about the issue of suitable Net access for kids.  The
article by Mich Kabay appears to trivialize the real concerns of parents who
are trying to be responsible about giving their kids access to contemporary
tools, but also wish to avoid unreasonable risks to the well-being of their
children.  Art Hicks

Mitch Kabay comments at length about CMU's decision to block access to
alt.sex.* et. al. on its computer systems.  Mitch's comments focus
mostly upon access, calling for finer grains of access to the Internet
rather than total vs. no access.

While Mitch raises good points, they really don't address CMU's
dilemma.  The following is an excerpt from the official on-campus
announcement of the change:

	Pennsylvania laws prohibits us from carrying bulletin boards
	that are known to be used for the distribution of sexually
	explicit or obscene material.  It is against the law for
	anybody to knowingly distribute sexually explicit materials to
	people under the age of 18, or obscene materials to people of
	any age.  [...]

	[T]he only criterion that will be used when considering the
	withdrawal of a bulletin board is that either the intended
	purpose for which it was established or its primary use
	(majority of the posts) makes it illegal for Computing
	Services to provide access to the bulletin board.

(N.B. Usenet groups at CMU are usually called bulletin boards.)

This isn't really an issue of whether minors can get access -- the
vast majority of students at CMU are over 18, anyways.  The problem is
that obscene material cannot be distributed in PA, regardless of the
age of the recipient.  And so CMU needs to find a way to obey the law.

In some ways, this is already the finer-grain access that Kabay
suggests.  CMU isn't going to monitor every newsgroup for obscene
materials; it simply will eliminate those newsgroups where such
material is the most prominent.  

Of course, whether or not local definitions of obscenity make sense
anymore in a global infobahn is another question entirely, and one
in which I'm still undecided.

Mich seems to discuss only one of three problems here.  He notes that
there is material suitable for adults but not for children.  He
correctly notes that it is the parent's responsibility to build a
suitable barrier.

The other two issues of "censorship" he did not discuss are: 1) Highly
offensive material not suitable for anyone, and 2) Any material
offensive to a payer.

In category 1) may be child pornography, or bestiality pornography.
The material (at a state or more local level IMO) may be simply ruled
illegal.

In category 2) Realizing that CMU receives tax funds we should ask if
any of these tax funds pay for Internet?  If yes, then a case may be
made to eliminate several newsgroups because they are offensive to
some segment of the taxpaying public.

An article in Friday's *Seattle Times* (Nov. 5, 1994) reports that
"Microwave interference has stalled crane operations on the $74 million
Seattle Center Coliseum renovation project."  Broadcast towers on nearby
Queen Anne hill and consumer microwave ovens on the same hill are suspected,
but "`I don't know if we'll ever be able to pin that down,' said Jack
Donovan, construction manager for PCL Construction Services Inc."
Continuing from the article:

  ...when the crane operator tried the [crane's] electronic controls, they
  didn't respond correctly and haven't worked since, Donovan said.  He
  didn't think the problem would delay the project...  "Obviously, it's an
  inconvenience, but to this point we've been able to use alternate means to
  work around it," he said.
    The crane operators are testing filters or shields around the controls
  to ward off microwaves.  Electronic specialists were called in to work on
  the problem yesterday.

I recently bought an Apple LaserWriter Select 360.  While I wanted a laser
printer anyway, I chose that particular model because it can accept a
Postscript FAX card.  I want to make a FAX/Email gateway that can send high
quality faxes - one can mail a postscript file to the gateway, and a high
quality fax will be transmitted.  If one has the good fortune to be
addressing another PS fax, the postscript is transmitted instead of the fax
codes, for extra high quality.

But there's a big problem: PS is a programming language.  This would allow
people to program my laser printer via e-mail!  People could do such things
as change the printer password remotely.  If one used a printer with an
attached hard disk, one could mail in a command to erase the disk.  Oops.

Would anyone know whether this has been considered under the postscript FAX
standard?  It seems to me it would be a problem for just regular PS faxes -
one would just hack it over the phone line from another PS fax machine.

Can you imagine someone putting letter bombs in public domain clip art?  Eek!

One could disable certain commands, and do save/restores, of course, but it 
is possible for postscript to be quite obtuse, and every printer has a number
of undocumented postscript operators that would be hard to guard against in
any general way.

I had an unpleasant experience this past weekend, and I imagine some other
readers of RISKS will find it interesting.

I recently purchased an Apple Macintosh computer at a "computer superstore,"
as separate components - the Apple CPU, and Apple monitor, and a third-party
keyboard billed as coming from a company called Sicon.

This past weekend, while trying to get some text-editing work done, I had to
leave the computer alone for a while.  Upon returning, I found to my horror
that the text "welcome datacomp" had been *inserted into the text I was
editing*.  I was certain that I hadn't typed it, and my wife verified that
she hadn't, either.  A quick survey showed that the "clipboard" (the
repository for information being manipulated via cut/paste operations)
wasn't the source of the offending text.

As usual, the initial reaction was to suspect a virus.  Disinfectant, a
leading anti-viral application for Macintoshes, gave the system a clean bill
of health; furthermore, its descriptions of the known viruses (as of
Disinfectant version 3.5, the latest release) did not mention any symptoms
similar to my experiences.

I restarted the system in a fully minimal configuration, launched an editor,
and waited.  Sure enough, after a (rather long) wait, the text "welcome
datacomp" once again appeared, all at once, on its own.

As a next step, I contacted John Norstad, the author of Disinfectant, and
one of the international response team for dealing with new Macintosh virus
sightings.  Very promptly I received a response, which I shall quote here in
its entirity (it's brief):

&gt; Yes, we have heard of this. It's a practical joke in the ROM code in some
&gt; third-party keyboards. The only solution is to get your bad keyboard
&gt; replaced.

I was furious.  Apparently there are hardware products on the market which
have embedded "Trojan Horses," programs which affect the operation of the
system without the user's consent (or knowledge!).

I have returned the keyboard to the store where I purchased it, and I plan
to contact Sicon about the problem.  The potential for abuses in computer
systems here is apparent, especially when the system involves "intelligent"
peripherals - such as many popular types of disk drive, Apple Desktop Bus
devices (such as the offending keyboard), and so forth.

John Norstad informs me that he has little knowledge of the extent of this
particular problem, other than the fact that he has received quite a bit of
mail from people who have been bitten.  What is almost as disturbing as
having fallen prey to this particular joke is the lack of information about
it - I can't find any mention of such a problem in any of the USENET Mac
newsgroups' "Frequently Asked Questions" compilations, although those FAQs
*do* mention viruses and how to deal with them.  It definitely seems to me
that people ought to be made more aware that this sort of thing is
happening.

In the fall of 1990 a bomb threat was phoned in to the Waterloo (Ontario,
Canada) Regional Police.  The threat said that a number of bombs had been
placed in various buildings on the University of Waterloo campus.

There was a recent discussion of this threat in alt.folklore.college.  I
posted a followup to this discussion.  I thought I would post a shorter
version for risks readers.

The entire campus was evacuated.  It took several hours, as the University
had no central public address system.  The threat turned out to be a hoax.
The news was circulated around the campus via a "phone-tree" and word of
mouth.

I knew a few more details about this incident because the day before the
bomb scare I had a long discussion with a young hot-head, who had said
something stupid, and I had reported him to the campus police.

The young hot-head had been a devoted reader of the newsgroup
"alt.sex.bondage".  He was furious with the Dean of Computing because he had
banned this newsgroup from all the campus computers.  During the course of
our discussion he said, "If I had a copy of 'The Anarchist Cookbook' I'd use
it to bomb Johnny Wong's office!"  (Dr. Wong was the Dean of Computing.
'The Anarchist Cookbook' is a how-to book on sabotage techniques, including
how to build bombs.)

I reported his threat to the campus police.  During my discussions with the
campus police I learned that the their big lead concerned the rash of news
articles that had been posted to the newsgroup "uw.general" the afternoon of
the bomb scare.

The campus police had arranged for someone to print out the news articles
that concerned the bomb scare.  One of the posts seemed to have been posted
prior to the reception of the phone call that initiated the scare.

The risk?

I am sure that none of the people posting messages warning others of the
scare gave a moment's thought as to whether their system's clock bore the
correct time.  I am sure they would be quite surprised to learn that they
had become suspects.  (Fortunately wiser heads within the University's
Department of Computing Services were consulted first.)

There are some other risks I would like to comment on.  When the bombs
didn't go off as scheduled, the campus police were asked to check the
campus.  By the time I had my interview with them, the campus police had had
a number of resignations.  It seems to me that to do a proper job of
checking the campus would require a regiment of combat engineers.

In my opinion, a phone-tree is not sufficient to meet this threat.  The
threat gave about four hours notice, and it took close to three hours to
clear the campus.  What if it had been a real bomb with only two hours
notice?  What if it had been a spill of toxic waste?

A recent risks digest said that CMU had recently announced bans of various
newsgroups.  Let's hope that none of CMU's administrators receive any
threats.

The hotel I was in last weekend had a nifty video-based message system.
They had the standard spectra-vision pay-per-view interactive video hardware
in the rooms so they set it up so you could review your bill, check out, and
collect your messages using your TV and remote control as a terminal.
Pretty nifty.

So one night, I get back to my room and press the "check messages" button.
After a longish pause, my TV greets me with the message:

  "We're sorry, but the hotel records indicate that this room does not
   exist.  Please contact the front desk if this is not the case."

At first, this caused a sort of Sartrian crisis within me, but then I
relaxed.  According to the hotel phone directory, the front desk didn't
exist either, so I was obviously in good company.

P.S.  It would seem that someone inadvertently checked me out.

   [Or else the database was inaccessible; your hypothesis suggests
   that someone checked out the front desk as well.  PGN]

          ALTERNATIVES FOR SIGNING ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS
                       By Benjamin Wright

Hospitals, banks, insurance companies and other organizations are looking to
replace paper with electronic documents, but they need a way to "sign" those
documents for legal and control purposes.  This article considers the
practical features of two alternative signing methods: smart-card based
public-key cryptography and PenOp, a pen computer technology that captures
handwritten autographs.  The article argues that PenOp holds certain
advantages in that it does not require the signer to

*  retain a token or smart card;
*  remember a password;
*  register with a bureaucratic certification authority; or
*  depart from the custom of signing with an autograph.

PenOp also does not require the receiver of a signature to use

&gt; The other two issues of "censorship" he did not discuss are: 1) Highly
&gt; offensive material not suitable for anyone, and 2) Any material
&gt; offensive to a payer.  [...]

The concept of (1) frightens me.  There is _no_ material unsuitable for
_anyone_, however repulsive a majority might consider it.  By definition,
_someone_ wants it, otherwise it wouldn't exist.  Who decides what's
unsuitable?  How often do open-minded individuals make the choice?
It's usually made by a self-elected "moral majority" type, or a
committee afraid of possible legal action initiated by the same.

The Internet is, and always has been, self-policing.  If someone posts
material considered by the vast majority to be utterly offensive, mass
action ensures that the poster is effectively put out of business.  That,
not a "policy decision" made by someone _we_ didn't choose to represent us,
is the best way of dealing with socially unacceptable net use.

Once we permit certain limits upon our expression, we tacitly accept that
further limits can be placed.  I'd rather be free to express my opinions.  I
don't defend child abuse (or indeed animal abuse), but these are emotional
arguments used to manipulate us into accepting the first of many serial
limitations on our freedom to contribute to, and to enjoy, the Net.

A couple of years ago I checked into a hotel in Mississauga (near Toronto)

What an odd list of possibilities to propose for "Parental Responsibility."
What about 

	"That parents should spend time with their children discussing

or 
	"That parents have a right and an obligation to express their

Certainly the words "Parental Responsibility" do not by definition imply
support for authoritarian personality traits nor do they suggest the
exercise of simple-minded credulity as useful parenting skills.

As part of the National Computer Ethics Responsibility Campaign, Dr Peter
Tippett has prepared the following document which addresses these questions.
None of the suggestions, in my opinion, suggests that families become training
grounds for a police state &lt;g&gt;.

Computer Ethics Campaign Information and Article

TEN QUESTIONS PARENTS SHOULD ASK THEIR CHILDREN

Peter S. Tippett, Ph.D., M.D.  
Symantec's Peter Norton Group
Board Member, Computer Ethics Institute 

1. Do you legitimately own all of the software, games, and programs
 you have or use?

Software Piracy, Clarifying Questions:
 Are any of your programs or software bootlegged or pirated copies?
 Where are the manuals, boxes, license agreements for the programs
 you have or use?
 Where did you get that game? (program?, floppy?, software?)
 When programs first start running on your computer, whose name
 comes on the screen as the "owner" or "licensed-to."

2. Where did the contents of your report / project / homework come
 from -- does any of it belong to someone else?
 Did you write/create/author what you're passing off as your own work?
 Where did you get the text and images you're using?
 If you copied text and images from another source, did you have permission?
 If you didn't need permission from the "owners" of the information
 you're using, did you credit them for the material? 

3. Do you ever use other people's computer, disk-space or
 processing capability, or look at or copy their files or
 information, without their knowledge or permission?

4. Do you have any prank programs, computer viruses, worms, trojan
 horse programs, bombs, or other malicious software?
 Malicious Software:  Clarifying Questions:
 Do you use bulletin boards or systems that contain these things, or
 have friends or acquaintances who do?
 Do you write or create any software like this or deal with people who do?

 Malicious Software: Explanation of the Problem

5. Do you have any computer graphics files, clips, movies,
 animations or drawings that you would be embarrassed about?
 Do you have them legitimately (Piracy)
 Are they things you would be comfortable showing me?  Showing your
 grandmother?  
 Do you have any pictures, video clips, sound clips, articles, text,
 or other software or files which contain pornography, violence,
 dangerous instructions other distasteful material?
 Do you access or view any of these kinds of things when using the net?

6. Do you have any newsletters, plans, guidelines, or "how-to"
 documents or files that you would not be comfortable showing to your mother?
 Making Bombs, breaking into systems, stealing telephone access,
 stealing computer access, stealing passwords, pornographic or
 violent text, guides, descriptions, ......
 Do you create, contribute to or receive anything like this?

7. Do you ever connect your computer to a telephone, use a modem,
 or otherwise use a network?

Clarifying Questions:
 Do you use E-Mail (electronic mail)?
 Do you use Bulletin Boards (BBS) (electronic bulletin board systems)?  
 Is your computer ever connected to other computers?  
 Do you use a Modem?

Explanation:
 There is nothing either unethical or illegal about using networks
 or connecting computers to telephones.  But, you should be aware
 that when computers are somehow part of a computer network, then
 they are not just used for "computing," but also for
 "communication" in a very broad sense of the word.  Since
 "communication," by definition, always includes someone else, and
 since ethics, or lack of it, relates mainly to our interactions
 with others, the networking of computers, by any means, leads to
 many, many more potential ethical dilemmas for a computer user,
 than non-network computing.
 The Questions above this one are all possible with both networked
 or non-networked computers.  Whereas the questions below this
 mostly make sense for people who use networked computers.  But,
 even for those issues related to the questions above, being
 connected to a network makes it easier to stray into trouble.   

8. Who do you associate with when you use the Net?
 BBS, Internet, CompuServe, Delphi, Fidonet, America On-line...
 E-Mail, Discussion Groups, Gangs, Influence
 Just as you would like to steer your children (and friends) away
 from bad influences in their daily lives, so should you attempt to
 discern the character of their cyber-friends

9. Do you ever use an assumed name, a handle, or an alias  instead
 of your real name?  
 Do supply a false information about yourself when using a bulletin
 board, a news group, a message group, or forum, any part of the
 net, or when using e-mail or when otherwise communicating?
 Do you use your real age &amp; sex when communicating with your
 computer?
 Do you use any false information like addresses, or phone numbers
 or use someone else's credit card number when using your computer?
 Do  you ever send messages or e-mail in such a way that the
 recipient cannot tell that you sent it?  
 Have you ever modified data, text, messages, or other computer
 information so that it looks like someone other than you created it
 or made the changes?
 What are you trying to hide by not using your real name?
 Are you trying to pretend you are something or someone you are not?

10. Do use telephone, video, cable-TV, computer network, bulletin
 board, or other network services without paying for them?

Michael Slavitch (<A HREF="/Risks/16.54.html">RISKS-16.54</A>)

&gt;About two months ago I reserved a book at my local library. The library has
&gt;gone electronic in its reservation system.  You reserve a book, and when
&gt;your turn to receive it comes due a computer dials your home phone number.
&gt;If an answer occurs, it assumes you heard the message; if you do not
&gt;pick up the book in three days, you are fined $2.00.

There is also the possibility that a child picks up the phone, and before
daddy or mommy gets to the phone, the information about the reserved book
has been told to the child.

If the librarian does not accept a technical explanation (answer
machine/faxmodem), this scenario should convince them that there is a
problem.

Michael Slavitch asks:
&gt;So how do you handle two things:
&gt; [One] An unreliable delivery system being assumed to be reliable.
&gt; [Two] People placing trust in such a system.

I don't know.  I have certainly been aware of small problems, ranging from
nuisances to misunderstandings to hurt feelings, arising from the
following assumptions many people make about the telephone system:

a) Each "ring signal" you hear is synchronized with the actual sounding of
the bell (or electronic warbler) at the dialed instrument.  Corollary: if
you have heard four "rings," the party you are calling has heard four rings.
Second corollary: if you have heard twenty rings, it cannot possibly be the
case that the telephone you're calling did not ring at all; either nobody
was there or they heard the bell and decided not to answer.

b) A cyclic buzz is a "busy signal" and means the instrument you dialed
is off-hook, i.e. there's a strong presumption that somebody is there.

Telephone books once described these signals and their meanings.  The
ones I use today do not.  I am sure this because the signals, which
once were reliable and informative "error messages," no longer are.

When there is no connection, the telephone system does not reliably signal
the reason for the failure.  Overloaded system may deliver rings ("no
answer") rather than busy signals for off-hook phones.  They may deliver
busy signals for phones that are actually on-hook (and, no, it is NOT always
a distinguishable "fast busy.")  I'm not aware of serious problems resulting
from this, but one could construct scenarios in which the risks were
significant.

Daniel P. B. Smith  <A HREF="mailto:dpbsmith@world.std.com">dpbsmith@world.std.com</A>

   [Actually the synchronization is not precise.  You may have noticed
   calling someone and having them answer without your hearing a ring.
   A slight delay is common on LONG-distance calls.  PGN]

Worker cleared of deleting planning files
By James Burrus, Camera Staff Writer
Boulder Daily Camera Thursday, November 10, 1994

A former Boulder County Planning Department employee was cleared Tuesday of
charges that she deleted an unknown number of files from county computers.
Charges against Vina Windes were dropped for "insufficient evidence" and
because "information indicates no crime may have been committed," according
to a motion filed Tuesday by the county's district attorney.  Windes, 53,
has worked as a secretary in the current planning division of the county
Planning Department for five years.

Graham Billingsley, Boulder County land use director, said charges were
dropped after his department and Windes worked out a deal Monday in which
"she would tell us what she did so we can put together the missing
information. So far she hasn't done that so we don't know" what happened.

But Windes said the files were never erased to begin with.  "They just
didn't know where anything was" in the computer system, Windes said. "All I
did was leave. No one else did what I did, so they didn't know where to find
anything on the computer when I was gone."  Windes gave two weeks' notice of
her resignation on Sept. 8 and started a new secretarial job Oct. 3. She was
taken away from her new job in handcuffs Oct. 7 by Boulder County sheriff's
officers and charged with computer crime, a felony, and abuse of public
records.

"The whole thing got blown out of proportion because of a lack of
communication," Billingsley said.

"Lack of communication?" Windes said. "There was no communication. All they
had to do was call me and ask. Instead, they sent a sheriff's investigator
to arrest me."

Imagine how often your network could go down with this new service:

"Netsafe(tm) makes the Internet safe for K-12 schools.  
Netsafe keeps information away from minds that are not ready for it."

Netsafe consists of a black box that monitors school traffic to the Internet
and when an attempt to access a host with undesirable information is made
(you select what categories to censor, they maintain the list of hosts), it
shuts down all Internet access for 15 minutes and sends an email or beeper
message to the local administration.  Netsafe costs $20,000 the first year,
$10,000 in successive years!  They manage Netsafe over the Internet itself.

The Canadian newspaper, _The Globe and Mail_, reports today (94.11.14) on a
disastrous attempt to tally votes by phone:

	Alberta phone voting crashes:  Liberal fiasco casts doubt
	on future of high-tech balloting in Canada.

	By Scott Feschuk, Alberta Bureau.

	Calgary -- Alberta Liberal officials will be trying this 
	morning to determine how the party's weekend leadership 
	convention degenerated into what they concede was an 
	outright debacle.

	Edmonton MLA [Member of the Legislative Assembly] Grant 
	Mitchell, 43, was selected to head the opposition party, 
	but his second-ballot victory was all but overlooked as 
	the telephone voting system crashed, and many members 
	were unable to vote or their votes were not recorded.

The author continues with the following key points of interest to RISKS and
NCSA FORUM readers:

o	Rural Albertans "found it all but impossible" to vote by phone
during most of the first ballot.

o	The Maritime Telegraph and Telephone Co. claimed that "the system
could handle more than 500 calls a minute" but the system crashed when a
mere 11,000 people tried to vote in the 5.5 hours allotted.

o	The voting was stopped for 40 minutes in the middle of the process.

o	Distribution of the personal identification numbers (PIN) required to
vote was incomplete, prompting complaints from disenfranchised voters.

o	Some users were informed by the computer system that their PIN had
already been used to vote.

o	Some users reported that it took them over an hour to complete one
vote.

o	Many users were informed that their vote had _not_ been counted even
though later analysis suggested it had.

o	The sequence of touch-tone buttons required to vote on the second
ballot was _different_ from the sequence used during the first ballot,
resulting in confusion by an "unknown number of participants" whose votes
were therefore lost.

o	Liberal Party officials are now "reluctant to pay Maritime tel's
C$100,000 fee [~U$72,000]."

o	There were discrepancies in the numbers of people counted in the
votes; at one point, the chief electoral officer reported "that more than
12,500 people had voted in the first ballot...." but he later reported just
over 11,000 votes.  However, "...[a]bout 19,000 people paid C$10 to
participate."  Calgary MLA Frank Bruseker commented, "You really have to
wonder what happened to those other 8,000 people....  Did they not vote, or
did their votes get lost, or did they try to vote and just get too
frustrated?"

o	The problematic balloting has discredited the Liberals' claim to be
an efficient alternative to the current government.

o	Bad feeling has worsened between the rivals for the leadership as a
result of claims of unfairness due to the technological breakdown.

o	Maritime Tel's system will next "be used again this weekend in
Saskatchewan, where provincial Conservatives will select a new leader."

Please note that the following is a completely fair and unbiased review.  I
strive at all times to be even-handed in my reviewing.  My vested interest
in this work in no way can be said to influence my judgement.  I mean, to
say that just because I spent *THREE SOLID YEARS* writing it means I might

This is the most FANTASTIC virus book EVER WRITTEN!  This is the most
FANTASTIC virus book that EVER WILL BE WRITTEN!!  The day this book was
released the ENTIRE VIRUS WRITING COMMUNITY committed suicide from
depression over the fact that no one would EVER BE HURT BY A VIRUS AGAIN!

Book stores are advised to have LARGE STOCKS of the book on hand,
prominently displayed, and probably to hire extra staff for the crush of
buyers.  Grown men have been known to pull their own liver out when told
that they could not buy the book!  (And that was before it was PUBLISHED!)

When we sent the books to reviewers, they typically danced in the streets
for joy for several days.  However, we reprint here some of the less
effusive comments:

-           Dr. Fred Cohen

"Obviously some johnny-come-lately upstart."
-           Harold Joseph Highland

"Is this guy some kind of comedian?"

"Wonderful!  It certainly cured *my* insomnia!"
-           Dorothy Denning

"A mantlepiece!"

Cecil B. DeMille, Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford, John Houston and Federico
Fellini are working on a co-production of the movie version.  Casting is not
yet complete, but rumours indicate that Tom Hanks will play frisk, Arnold
Schwartzenegger will portray Padgett Peterson, and Mark Ludwig will be
Stoned.  The part of Vesselin Bontchev will be played by a Cray YMP.

Subject: Re: EMI and construction cranes (Summit, <A HREF="/Risks/16.55.html">RISKS-16.55</A>)

   While not directly related to computer RISKS, I feel a comment on how the
FCC allocates frequencies is apropos here.  Back in '91, the parts of the
72Mhz range that formerly were allocated in 40kHz wide ranges for R/C planes
were re-allocated.  Now, the R/C frequencies are 10Khz wide, 20Khz apart
with various other devices allocated the frequencies between.  These include
pagers and some crane operations, among others.  The old, pre-1991
transmitters are still legal to use until sometime around 1998.
   An older or poorly tuned R/C transmitter can cause short-ranged problems,
like spurious pager signals or disruption of crane operations.  R/C Tx are
very low powered.  Their effective range may be as far as 3 miles.
   The real RISKS are obvious to the public.  In the R/C community, cranes
are notorious for using very 'messy' and over-powered transmitters.  A
crane, pager tower, or other source of EMI could cause R/C fliers to lose
control.  A 10Kg object, hurtling through the air at over 200 KPH and
spinning a razor- sharp 15" prop at 18000 RPM can cause a lot of damage or
loss of life.

  "Broadcast towers ... and consumer microwave ovens ... are suspected,
  (of causing interference to the radio controls of a crane.)"

Not knowing the Seattle area, but assuming that the "Nearby hill" is
probably several thousand feet away, and maybe several miles away, the quoted
person's (Donovan) comment shows a very poor understanding of the technology
he is working with.

It is outraegous that the blame can be placed on a microwave oven.  Maybe,
if the oven were inside the crane, there would be enough leakage to cause
interference, but it is not likely even then.  Even a broken oven that would
work with the door open, and pointed toward the crane, wouldn't interfere
with the crane if it was more than several hundred feet away.  We know of
course that the "Broadcast Towers" themselves wouldn't affect the crane, but
the transmitters using those towers could.  The interesting thing is that in
most cases of isolated RFI (interference affecting only a particula person
or machine), the "Cause" is not the source of the interfering signal, but
the receiver being affected.  Poorly designed receivers are a major cause of
headaches to legally operating radio transmitters.

No, it isn't.  Our phone has a switch that turns the bell on and off.  As
we eventually discovered, a hard bump can switch off the bell; and in a
household with children and animals, the phone is inevitably bumped hard
enough.

Furthermore, it's unplugged at times.

It's obviously risky to assume that because one hears a ring signal, a
phone is actually ringing.

The goals of automated telephone notification are to reduce the postage
costs and to notify people more quickly.  For example, alerting you to
overdue books faster so the fines don't get as large.

DRA sells a few of different phone notification systems to libraries.
Ottawa Public Library is one of our customers, but I don't know their
exact setup.  However, here is the basic (the specifics may vary depending
on hardware platform) notification method.

   1) Dial phone
   2) Monitor call progress signals (if we're lucky the library
      has a telephone line that returns answer supervision)
   3) When telephone line "answered"
          speak notification message twice,
      otherwise
          after a number of failed attempts
              send a mailed notice
          otherwise
              rescheduled call and exit
   4) Wait up to 10 seconds for DTMF (touch-tone) key
      if DTMF digit "0" pressed
          go back to step 3
      if other DTMF key pressed
          record it in notice response (e.g. "Press 1 to confirm")
      otherwise
          record no response (rotary dial, answering machine?)

Its not a foolproof system.  DTMF talk-off, wrong phone numbers, children
answering the phone can cause the notice to be marked "SENT" (note: I don't
use the word "received.")  But it usually gets the job done under a
variety of adverse conditions on low-bid hardware.  (Hint, hint, pass
that next tax increase for the library, and maybe they'll be able to
afford a more sophisticated system.)

&gt;Well, I am. I know that it is only two bucks, but the implications that
&gt;arise from misuse or overly trusting such a system are worrisome. What if
&gt;the government started issuing parking tickets or summonses in this manner,
&gt;or banks warning you of surcharges on financial transactions?  What if my
&gt;wife answered the phone and the book was "how to handle infidelity in you
&gt;marriage" :) (it wasn't).

Some libraries use postcards to notify people when a copy of "How to
handle infidelity in your marriage" is available.  Parking tickets
are presumed valid even if someone rips it off your windshield before
you see it.  There are all sorts of risks in all sorts of notification
systems.  Nevertheless we accept many risks as normal.

Libraries rarely send notices via certified return receipt requested mail.  
The problem of "lost" notifications is something libraries have dealt
with for a long time.  The dog ate it.  The post office lost it.  The
kids hid the overdue notice before the parent gets home.  Different
libraries have different policies for handling reports of not receiving
a notice.  Generally proof of receipt is not a requirement.

What should be considered a reasonable attempt at notification?

A quick description of security for PostScript FAX (as implemented in
various laser printers) follows:

If the ReceivePostScript FAX parameter is false, the printer will
reject any attempt to inject PostScript through the modem.  In this
case, it will accept only the FAX format.

If the PostScriptPassword FAX parameter is not the empty string, then
the transmitting printer must supply a password.  Receiver challenge
and encryption are used.

The default values of these parameters are true and the empty string,
respectively, so a factory-new printer will accept PostScript without
requiring a password.  In this case, any attempt to change system or
device parameters (such as passwords) from within an incoming FAX job
will fail unless the (separate) system password is supplied.  Also,
attempts to generate outbound FAXes will fail.  If no system password
has been set (as in a factory new printer), then such attempts fail.

I can't find anything in the documentation which gives disk files
better protection from a FAX job than from a local job.

The reference for all this is "PostScript Language Reference Manual
Supplement for Version 2014" by Adobe Systems Incorporated.  This is
available, as a PostScript file (naturally), from ftp.adobe.com as
"pub/adobe/DeveloperSupport/TechNotes/PS.Supp.2014.ps".  "2014" here
refers to the major revision number of the PostScript interpreter, as
reported by the printer on the page that it prints at power-up.
Similar files are available for versions 2011, 2012, and 2013.

A similar situation may exist with NEXTSTEP's Mail application.  NEXTSTEP
uses Display PostScript as it's imaging model. When one selects for display
a piece of email that contains an encapsulated PostScript file attachment,
the PostScript is sent to the window server and executed.

This feature has led several clever hackers to create NeXTmail  
PostScript "viri". I have seen several of these, all pranks, none  
malicious. One causes a number of spiders to scurry across the  
desktop, which must be squashed with a mouse click before allowing  
you to regain control of your desktop. Another causes all the window  
objects to drop off the bottom of the desktop one at a time, yet  
another shakes the entire desktop, giving the impression of an  
earthquake.

Although I have personally not seen any destructive email viri, I can't say
that none exist. I'll ask roughly the same question as the original poster.
Was the possibility of malicious use of the PostScript language considered
when determining standards for intelligent PostScript devices??

In <A HREF="/Risks/16.55.html">RISKS-16.55</A>, Mike Crawford write about the risks of remote configuration
of intelligent devices such as his Postscript printer.

One possible solution to this risk is to require a switch to be thrown,
button pushed, jumper changed, or some other physical manipulation of the
actual device before any critical configuration information can be changed.
A physical "lock-out" would provide security when needed, yet still allow the
benefits of remote configuration if desired.

The company I work for manufactures X terminals, and we have incorporated
this type of feature into our terminals.  When a special type of keyboard,
called a "secure keyboard" is attached to the terminal, the critical portion
of the terminal's configuration data (stored in non-volatile memory) can be
locked against further changes.  The secure keyboard is then removed and
replaced with a standard keyboard.

In <A HREF="/Risks/16.55.html">RISKS-16.55</A>, Mike Crawford pointed out that accepting postscript to a fax
machine is really accepting a program to be executed.  Postscript is a
programming language with operators for renamefile, deletefile, createfile,
and some others that are risky in some situations.  Moreover, operators can
be created from other operators, so it is not even sufficient to scan the
postscript stream for the offending sequences before executing them because
they can be built from other strings at runtime.

Many web viewers such as netscape and mosaic can be configured to invoke
external viewers such as ghostscript that are in reality postscript language
interpreters.  It is therefore possible for someone to click on a URL inside
a web viewer, and in so doing have changes made to their local file system
that are not apparent to the user, because it caused a postscript file to be
brought back and executed.  The default mode (safer) for the recent version
of ghostscript does not execute these operators, but the risk still exists
for other configurations.  Postscript is probably also not the worst
offender for this - what if your local web viewer on a UNIX machine
processes Bourne shell scripts locally by feeding them to /bin/sh, or your
DOS viewer executes .bat files by feeding them to command.com?  Click here
to reformat your disk ...

It is clearly possible to write internet software that is dangerous to
operate, but the risk can easily be eliminated through proper
configuration and coding.  Many of us drive automobiles to work every
day, recognizing that they possess the capability to inflict serious
injury and death if used improperly or if they experience a
catastrophic failure.  Will the government someday legislate seatbelts
for web viewers and fax machines because of the risks to uninformed or
careless users?

&gt; Would anyone know whether this has been considered under the postscript FAX
&gt; standard?  It seems to me it would be a problem for just regular PS faxes -
&gt; one would just hack it over the phone line from another PS fax machine.

Indeed, this issue was considered at length in the design of PostScript fax.
There are several passwords that control access to both PostScript fax
specifically and to system administrator functions generally (such as
erasing the disk).

The defaults are set up to be relatively permissive. This decision is based
on the reality that many PostScript fax printers will be installed and
operated by unsophisticated users having no system administrator support and
who expect the product to work right out of the box. However, the defaults
are such that system administrator functions can't be executed by a fax job.

This, of course, solves only part of the problem. There is no
protection against a fax job that executes something like:

  1000000 {showpage} repeat

More comprehensive facilities for authentication, access control, resource
accounting, etc., await implementation in future versions of PostScript fax
products.

Don't you run the same risk when you print any PS file that you download
from the net or receive as email and then send to your printer?  Do you
examine every PS file for security holes before you print it?  PS FAX just
gets rid of the middleman.

As for changing the printer password, wouldn't they have to know the old
password in order to get into the mode that allows it to be changed?  [...]

What's needed is probably a general concept of trust levels associated with
PS document sources.  Dangerous commands would only be permitted for
documents that came from a trusted source.  When printing PS files, the
user could indicate the trust level (high trust if they generated the file
themselves from an application, low trust if they got it from the net).
For automated processing like PS FAX, it could simply default to low trust,
or perhaps permit passwords to be included (either in the PS code, or
perhaps in the FAX wrapper).

In effect, a PS FAX machine needs to be like a computer with a dialin modem:
you need to be able to define accounts and give them access privileges.

Yesterday evening I returned home from work and, as usual, checked the
answering machine on my normal voice telephone.  Much to my surprise,
I heard a somewhat muffled background conversation that I soon identified
as that afternoon's conference in the office.  This filled the tape to
the end, and had caused several later calls to be rejected.

  [aside #1: I hate these damn micro-cassette systems that only allow
             ten or fifteen minutes of message time, but they have become
	     ubiquitous!]

Two aspects of this message puzzled me: how had it found its way to my
answering machine, and why was it so muffled?  The office has just completed
installing a high-tech AT&amp;T digital phone system with all sorts of fancy
features, but I know that the trunk-to-trunk transfer features have all been
disabled for security reasons.  It is therefore not possible for our
conference call link to another office to have been forwarded to my home
phone.  The only possible way for my phone to have been included in the
conference would have been for it to have initiated the call (and then
worked its way through a set of control codes.)

  [aside #2: my former answering machine, which used real C-90 cassettes,
             did have the unfortunate habit of occasionally calling back
	     the last number to have dialed it!  Another story, and one
	     which can wait for a rainier day to tell.]

  [aside #3: the idea of disabling trunk-to-trunk switching to prevent
             improper (read: malicious cracker) usage really demonstrates
	     the lack of thought that goes into much of what today passes
	     for the design process.  Hey, just compile it and debug it,
	     that way you'll be *doing* something...]

Investigation at the office yielded disbelief followed by stunned surprise.
No one had forwarded the phone, and my home phone number was not programmed
onto any button in the system.  However, we all rush to the documentation
to check into just how the remote monitor feature works, and try to recall
whether any visible telltales had been lit to indicate monitoring.

Finally, light dawns.  A colleague's tiny Nokia cell-phone in his shirt
breast pocket.  He had called me at home earlier, and the phone has a last
number redial button.  The phone, non-folding, slipped into his shirt pocket
with the controls outermost, had somehow had that button tripped, and had
happily held the line open to my answering machine.  The muffled broadcast
was entirely attributable to the small microphone and the cotton pocket
between it and our conference table.

However, it is an extraordinarily sobering experience to hear a sensitive
work discussion issuing hours later from the speaker of your home voice
messaging system.

A number of risks here, but the predominant one seems to be the conflict
between added function and reduced footprint of portable cell-phones leading
to the creation of unergonomic control systems.  This is exacerbated by the
novel situations to which the diminished footprint can give rise.  This is
surely the first generation of cell-phones that are sufficiently small (a)
to be droppable into a toilet, and (b) actually flushed out of reach...

As this below tiny program from Thomas Koenig demonstrates the pentium
sometimes only returns single precision when dividing floating point doubles.

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main()
{ double x,y,z;
    x = 4195835.0; y = 3145727.0;
    z = x - (x / y) * y;
    printf("%f\n",z);
    return 0;
}

It will return 256 if you have the fdiv bug, and zero if you don't.

I've written 3 similar programs:
	1 like the above, but more resistent to compiler optimization
	1 that searches randomly for the bug (no special seeds)
	1 that searches linearly for the bug.

I'll leave it to the reader to interpret the risks of a cpu that
silently returns 1/2 the precision that you expect.

BTW in my test it happens about about 1 in 10^9 divisions or about
once every 21 minutes with a sequential search.  I.e. if your running 
flat out divisions and multiplies (to check the divs).

It can be MUCH higher, up to once a second, with biased random numbers.  

I'll make havebug.c rndsearchbug.c and linsearchbug.c available
for anonymous ftp at math.ucdavis.edu

For further references read comp.sys.intel under the fdiv bug thread.

I got a recent net leaflet that proclaimed that the US Geological Survey
would cease printing their National Water Conditions Report in January 1995
to save money. The information would only be available on-line. This will
supposedly save them plenty of liquid capital. 

Normally, I would be happy when they go with the flow of technology. But the
lack of a printed record seems like an invitation for adding Orwellian
changes to the report in the future. What if you want to go into the past
and use the report as a basis for some legal procedure? For instance, you
might want to sue someone about cyanide levels in the water down stream from
the gold mine. Suddenly two different versions of the report end up before
the judge. One gives the stream a clear bill of health while the other cites
the danger. Which one will the judge and jury believe? How do we know that
the archive in Washington is secure? No need to shred documents or stuff
them in your underwear when a strong magnet will do the job.

Anyone who wants to jump into the deep end of paperless publishing should
use both digital signatures and digital time stamps to ensure accountability.

The following sentence was taken from Richard Cohen's column on page A19 of
the November 15, 1994 Washington Post:

"GOP national chairman Haley Barbour instantly announced that New York City
was no longer in the running for the Republican National Convention, and,
more ominous, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the state's leading Republican and
Pataki's Disk Operating System (DOS), said he would not seek revenge on
Giuliani."

The only explanation I can come up with (other than Sen. D'Amato really
being a copy of DOS) is that Cohen typed 'doss' instead of 'boss', and the
spelling checker not only corrected it to DOS, but spelled the acronym out
since it's the first appearance of it in a non-computer-related news story.

*The New York Times* has an article about an attempt by tobacco company
lawyers to subpoena reporters' travel and telephone records in an indirect
attempt to identify their sources for stories asserting that the companies
deliberately added nicotine to their cigarettes.

  William Glaberson, A libel suit raises questions about the ability of
  journalists to protect sources in the electronic age, *The New York Times*,
  14 November 1994, page C10. 

Many readers of RISKS probably remember other attempted strategic uses of
the discovery process by tobacco companies, including at least one attempt
to subpoena raw survey data from smoking researchers and an attempt to
obtain an electronic mailing list of anti-smoking activists.  (Actually, the
article doesn't explicitly say that the companies want the subpoenas issued
as part of the discovery phase of the trial, just that they want them and
the major press organizations are trying to stop them.)

In any event, this case is an excellent example of why data security, while
obviously important, does not guarantee privacy.  I am sure that those
travel and telephone records are as secure as they need to be, but that may
not provide enough protection against the legal strategies of tobacco
companies.  Maybe this point is obvious to Risks readers, but it is
certainly not obvious to many others, including many of the politicians who
make laws about such things.  So remember to let these folks know:

  Security is not privacy.

The only guarantee of privacy is anonymity.  Fortunately, technologies such
as digital cash to implement anonymity are on their way.  Insist that they
be used in any new system that gets developed near you.  And spread the
word, because once privacy-invasive systems get standardized and installed
they're hard to regulate and even harder to change.

A surge of outside computers connecting to the National High Magnetic Field
Laboratory's public information computer was the first sign something was
amiss, with many of the suspect connections coming from a computer in the
Center for Educational Technology, two miles away at Florida State
University. "Hackers were using it so much it wasn't responsive to
legitimate users," says the director of the magnet lab's computer center.
The computers have now been cleaned of pirated software and electronic
burglary tools, but even as the crackers were scurrying to cover their
tracks, all related data was copied onto a back-up tape and turned over to
the Computer Emergency Response Team for further investigation. "I think
it's time to slap these little buggers upside the head," says the CEO of
DeScribe, one of the companies whose software was posted. (Miami Herald

In Australia, my wife brought home a calendar from the uni.  There was an
error in it.  Magnetic calendars you get from schools, politicians, plumbers
and others sometimes have errors as well.

In Finland, as a way to reduce RISKS caused by incorrect calendars the
publishing of Finnish-language calendars has long been a monopoly that the
government gives to one printer for a number of years. As a result some
other printers, institutions, shops, and tradespeople now publish their
unofficial calendars in other languages, mostly in English.

&gt;What about

&gt;        their (both parents'; and children's) interests and activities
&gt;        and exchanging views in a mutually respectful atmosphere?"

It is important to include the children's age in these discussions. For
teenagers the view above is indeed a proper statement of parental
responsibility. But that is not true for younger children, nor is it even
true for many younger teenagers who are not maturing at the same schedule
as some of their peers. They may know the values but not be able to judge
the situation. I shudder to think of my third-grader son trying to deal
with the e-mail response he would get if he posted to
alt.barney.dinosaur.die.die.die for example. It's hard enough for him to
cope with the taunts of a smug middle-schooler.

When a parent takes a child to see 'Jurassic Park' because the child wants
to and the child has nightmares for the next several weeks, that was the
parent's mistake, not the child's. The parental responsibility to say 'no'
for the child does not go away after a discussion about scary movies. The
child cannot yet judge what 'too scary' means. My most shameful moments as
a parent have come when I have made the wrong choice. My most wonderful
moments have come when I have made the right choice.

My son could thrive in a 'safe' on-line environment, asking children of
France what their weather is, or looking up the Space Shuttle schedule, or
monitoring the bombardment of Jupiter. But he can't act as his own censor
or ignore ill-judged email responses, he doesn't have the judgment and the
on-line services are not a controlled situation.

The proper analogy is the shopping mall versus the school. My son isn't old
enough to go to the mall without a parent. He can go to an elementary
school without a parent. He's not even close to being able to cope with the
environment of life in a high-school.

Similarly, he isn't old enough to go on the infobahn by himself. Perhaps
someone will develop a 'schoolnet' that he can navigate by himself. Until
then, I will have to be at his shoulder.

Where are the manuals, boxes, license agreements for the programs
you have or use?
	They don't have manuals or boxes.  Should I not use them?

Where did you get that game? (program?, floppy?, software?)
	Usually over the net - how do I tell if it's legitimate?

When programs first start running on your computer, whose name
comes on the screen as the "owner" or "licensed-to."
	Very few have this feature.

Did you write/create/author what you're passing off as your own work?
	I resent the use of 'passing off'.  Almost all modern works are
	collaborative in nature - the selection of citations is not a
	trivial issue.  Where did you get these questions?  Are you
	passing off some of it as your work when in fact others first
	came up with some of these ideas?  Where are your citations?

Where did you get the text and images you're using?
	Many of them come from on-line sources.  Does that make them
	legitimate or illegitimate?

If you copied text and images from another source, did you have permission?
	Rarely - in most cases, fair use allows you to use them without
	getting formal permission.  Kind of like these questions of yours.

If you didn't need permission from the "owners" of the information
you're using, did you credit them for the material? 
	Only if I republish it. I have lots of on-line information
	without citations attached to it.  But I see the author of this
	questionnaire thinks it's legitimate to do this without citation.
	I guess I should stop giving as much credit where due as I do.

3.  Do you ever use other people's computer, disk-space or processing
capability, or look at or copy their files or information, without their
knowledge or permission?
	I almost never get permission to look at each file I view.
	I go under the assumption that I may view anything that
	allows read access by me without going outside of the
	normal methods in use to read files.  If it is interesting,
	I copy it for future reference.  I hope they do not know any
	details about my use.  After all, I want to retain my privacy
	and they should not be watching what I do.

4. Do you have any prank programs, computer viruses, worms, trojan
horse programs, bombs, or other malicious software?
	Several thousand of them.  What's wrong with that?  Don't you
	have some too?

Do you use bulletin boards or systems that contain these things, or have
friends or acquaintances who do?
	Certainly.  The Internet has lots of these things, and I use it.
	The telephone system is used for abusive phone calls and I use
	it too.  I don't really know what my friends do when they use
	computers.  They have privacy rights too, and we rarely talk about
	what information service we use.

Do you write or create any software like this or deal with people who do?
	All the time.  I deal with Microsoft, Lotus, and many other
	companies that have widely distributed this sort of thing.
	I also know and deal with individuals who have done this, and
	I do it all the time.  Is there something wrong with that?

Are they things you would be comfortable showing me? Showing your
grandmother?
	I would not show either you or my grandmother my files, but it
	has nothing to do with embarrassment.  It is called privacy.

Do you have any pictures, video clips, sound clips, articles, text, or
other software or files which contain pornography, violence, dangerous
instructions other distasteful material?
	Lots of them.  It this wrong for some reason?

Do you access or view any of these kinds of things when using the net?
	All the time.  In fact, if you know of any, I would be happy
	if you would forward information on them to me.

6.  Do you have any newsletters, plans, guidelines, or "how-to"
documents or files that you would not be comfortable showing to your
mother?
	Same answer as above.  I value my privacy.

Making Bombs, breaking into systems, stealing telephone access, stealing
computer access, stealing passwords, pornographic or violent text,
guides, descriptions, ......  Do you create, contribute to or receive
anything like this?
	All the time.  In fact, the Risks Forum is one of my best
	sources for this information.  Should you stop making it
	available to me?

7.  Do you ever connect your computer to a telephone, use a modem, or
otherwise use a network?
	All the time.

8. Who do you associate with when you use the Net?
	Lots of different people.  How do I know who they really are
	anyway?  If you claimed to be John Smith at the West Hannover
	Institute, how could I tell this was true, and why would I
	bother?

... so should you attempt to discern the character of their cyber-friends
	How?  We have congress-people that seem to lie all the time,
	and yet the majority of voters vote for them and they have a lot of
	power, are on TV all the time, and are supposed to be highly
	respected.  Does this mean that lying is good or bad?  Judge
	not - lest you shall be judged!  Who shall cast the first stone?
	Do you attempt to discern the character of everyone on the net
	you communicate with?  How about the thousands who read your
	postings to Risks?  The nature of the net is that it provides
	anonymity and open forums for discussion.  Why would I want to
	stifle free speech by asking character questions.  The
	statements people make should stand on their own regardless of
	who states them. That is the best feature of the nets.  A high
	school kid can shine and a Ph.D. can look like an idiot - based
	on what they say, not who they are.

9. Do you ever use an assumed name, a handle, or an alias  instead
of your real name?  
	Sure.  I have asked this posting to be made anonymously in
	order to allow it to be judged based on its content rather
	than it's source.  It's kind of like the referee process is
	supposed to be on professional papers.  Maybe we would all be
	better off if all postings were anonymous (with a return
	address that permits response without identity).

Do supply a false information about yourself when using a bulletin
board, a news group, a message group, or forum, any part of the net, or
when using e-mail or when otherwise communicating?
	At times.  Especially when bbs systems ask extensive questions
	about who I am, my SSN, credit information, or other information
	that I don't think they have a right to have.  I have also lied
	when connecting to hacker BBS systems because I don't think they
	have a right to know who I am when they all use handles instead
	of names anyway.  I have also used telnet (25) into SMTP sites
	to forge e-mail as if I were Captain Kirk from the enterprise in
	order to have fun when communicating with friends.  Is there
	something wrong with having fun in this way, or is the Internet
	only for serious work and not for having fun or playing around.
	If so, why are there thousands of fun and games forums in the
	Internet?

Do you use your real age &amp; sex when communicating with your computer?
	I rarely use either.  Nobody has ever asked my sex (my name
	is probably a giveaway on that one) or my age.  Besides, I
	think that discrimination based on age and sex are wrong, are
	against the law, and that forging a sex or age in order to
	have equal access is fair, reasonable, and appropriate in the
	network environment.

Do you use any false information like addresses, or phone numbers or use
someone else's credit card number when using your computer?
	Yes, yes, and no respectively.  Theft (by deception) is very
	different than not telling someone where you live or what
	your phone number is.  These are privacy issues, and privacy
	is a very important thing to have.  Privacy through deception
	is not wrong.  Even becoming someone's friend by lying to them
	about having something in common is not particularly wrong.
	Certainly giving a salesperson a polite wrong number and address
	is a reasonable privacy precaution against getting on mailing
	lists.  It is probably even good to lie if you think someone
	is stalking you over the net.  I think we have a right to lie,
	perhaps even a social responsibility to do so under certain
	circumstances. 

Do you ever send messages or e-mail in such a way that the recipient
cannot tell that you sent it?
	In what sense?  I have certainly sent e-mail that never got
	through - the intended recipient didn't know I sent it.
	I have sent e-mail from group accounts where the individual
	was not identified, but the group was.  This is quite common
	in customer support.  I have also forged e-mail addresses so
	that I could remain anonymous.  Is that supposed to be wrong?
	Why?  If I sent you a seasons greeting card from a false identity
	would you be upset and try to find me and have me arrested?
	There is a difference between malice and fun.

Have you ever modified data, text, messages, or other computer
information so that it looks like someone other than you created it or
made the changes?
	Certainly.  I had to make a change to the TeX sources once
	to get them to compile right, and I used the TeX user ID to
	do so in order to allow the compilation to work right.  This
	is often called for in systems administration.

What are you trying to hide by not using your real name?
	My identity. It's called privacy and anonymity.  It's one of
	the basic principles of a free society - that's why we have
	anonymous voting - to protect anonymity and be certain that
	I can think and do what I feel are right without someone like
	you being able to seek retribution.  I believe that a free
	society requires privacy and anonymity.  Otherwise, someone like
	you who perhaps thinks that these ideas are too radical might
	try to black ball me.  Anonymity in pre-war Germany could have
	saved millions of lives.  Many in the US are trying to eliminate
	anonymity by such practices as federal ID cards, and I think that
	is very dangerous.

Are you trying to pretend you are something or someone you are not?
	I have a right to be whatever I want to be.  If I claim to
	be an expert in business consulting, you use my services, and
	I do a good job, what does it matter that I don't even have
	a high school diploma.  If you hire an MBA and they do a bad
	job, does that make it OK?  There is nothing wrong with
	pretending, as long as you don't lie in order to take advantage
	of someone else.  Theft by deception requires theft.  If I knock
	on your door and claim to be a Jehova's witness when I am not,
	why should that offend you more than if I were a real one?

10.  Do use telephone, video, cable-TV, computer network, bulletin
board, or other network services without paying for them?
	All the time.  When I am at a friend's house and I make a phone
	call, I don't pay for it.  I don't pay for Internet access, it is
	given to me.  I use Freenets and other bulletin boards without
	paying for them too.  I have even used friend's accounts to
	access the network on occasions when I didn't have any local
	access.  I also used free compu-serv, America-Online, and Delphi
	services when they had free offers.  The vast majority of people
	using the Internet until only a few years ago did not pay for
	their usage either.  Their company, the federal government, or
	someone else paid for their usage.

The bottom line: Are these things also true for my children? Yes, I think
they are.  I hope that they learn how to do the same things I have learned
how to do in order to protect themselves from the tyranny of the majority -
or is it the vocal minority? I hope they keep things private from me when
appropriate, and if they look at some dirty pictures once in a while, it
won't greatly offend me.

Please consider that most issues of right and wrong are matters of degree
and circumstance.  Given more choice and less control, I think more people
will make better decisions.  Illegalize dirty pictures, and you will have a
much larger audience.  That's why so many motion pictures add nudity or
violence if they don't get an R rating with the first cut.  After all, an R
picture on average sells a lot more tickets than a PG picture.

The London "Independent" newspaper of 24-Nov-94 leads with a story that a
"hacker" gained access to a sensitive database of telecommunications
information at British Telecommunications (BT), the UK's largest (and ex-state
owned) carrier. The story was also carried by all the major television and
radio news programmes.

Tim Kelsey, author of the Independent story, reveals that details such as
telephone numbers and addresses for secret installations of the Ministry of
Defence, MI5 (the British intelligence agency responsible for the UK) and
MI6 (like MI5, but handles non-UK affairs).

"Thousands of pages of highly confidential BT records were sent across the
Internet to a young Scottish journalist, Steve Fleming, in July". Mr
Fleming received the information after making a news posting asking for
information on BT and hacking. The informant remained anonymous -- details
of how this was achieved are not given.

The hacker also gave details to Mr Fleming about how he too could access
the information. He applied through an employment agency for a short-term
contract at BT as a database designer, clearly stating on his CV that he
was a freelance journalist. He got the job, and was able to gain access to
the information because passwords were just left lying around the office.

BT is still going through a major staff restructuring programme, and as a
result has a large number of temporary (contract) staff. These staff need
passwords to the system to legitimately carry out their jobs, but because
of the constant flow of people, the passwords are often written down.

Mr Fleming learned, among other things,

  *  The location of MI6's training centre ("spy school"), located in a
     non-descript building next to a pub in south London
  *  Information about the bunker in Wiltshire where the Government would go
     in the event of nuclear war
  *  Details of telephone installations at Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing
     Street [the Prime Minister's home], including personal lines to John
     and Norma Major.

The system itself, the "Customer Services System", was designed and
implemented by an American company, Cincinnati Bell. It is supposed to have
internal mechanisms to prevent hacking (!)

So, what are the risks (briefly!)

	1) Allowing temporary staff passwords that allow almost any data to
	be retrieved. It sounds as if the security levels of the database
	were either non-existent, or compromised.
	2) Keeping sensitive information in the same database as
	non-sensitive information.
	3) The age-old chestnut of the uses of passwords.

A BT spokesman, speaking on the "Today" programme on BBC Radio 4 confirmed
that a "top level" investigation had been launched, but refused to confirm
or deny that the hack had taken place.

According to a piece on the CBC Alberta News on Nov 24:

Pilots are complaining about the inaccurate weather forecasts
being provided by new automated weather briefing equipment
installed at an Edmonton airport (and soon to be operational at
the Calgary airport.)  The system apparently cannot keep up with
changing weather conditions and, in one specific case, a
Canadian Airlines plane landed in snow although the forecast did
not mention any snow.  The airline has complained, and union
members are arguing for a return to human delivery of weather
info to pilots.

On Saturday, Nov 19, Iowa City's telephone system, run by US West, shut down
at about 3:30 PM, local time, and service was not restored until between
7:30 and 9:30 PM (service was brought up a bit at a time).  As phone outages
go, this was fairly severe!  The population of the effected community is
over 60,000.

The Iowa City Press Citizen, on Tuesday, Nov 22, reported that the cause of
the failure has finally been determined.  In July, a new telephone switching
system was installed, and in the past week, the old system was removed from
the building.  As part of the removal process, the paper reports that an
electrical grounding cable was inadvertently removed, leaving the new switch
improperly grounded.

Apparently some customers noticed intermittent problems with their phone
service earlier in the day, and US West had technicians working on the
problem before the failure, but they were unable to diagnose the problem
until some time after the failure had occurred.

Once the failure was diagnosed, the paper's description makes it sound as if
the missing cable must have been easy to replace, but the 2 hour delay
between the fix and the complete restoration of service is disturbing.  They
had to cold-start the ESS system or systems involved (can you put over
20,000 phones on one system?), but this can't account for 2 hours, can it?
My alternate hypothesis is that the improper grounding connection blew large
numbers of fuses in alternate ground paths that weren't supposed to carry
current, leading to a very time consuming job putting things right.

Lessons: First, this failure seems to be a perfect example of the fact that
grounding problems are notoriously difficult to diagnose.  Second, I suspect
that nobody involved in the design of modern ESS systems would have guessed
that it would take 2 hours to restore service after the fault was repaired.
People who do such analysis or design other fault tolerant systems may need
to look at this failure as an example.  I'm eager to see more technical
detail than the newspaper provided!

 In the quiet western-Missouri town of Warrensburg, a small house with 
two occupants recently received a water bill amounting to $4,704.88.

 The water meter had been replaced with a new one, and being new, it read 
"000000".  The previous reading from the last month, was "017060".  The 
computer assumes that numbers on a water meter only go up, of course.  So 
it was perfectly logical for the computer to assume that "000000" was 
caused by the meter rolling-over after reaching "999999".
 Subtracting 017060 from 1000000 yields 982940 - and I was in fact billed 
for using 982940 cubic feet of water.  (That's a column of water with a 
base the size of my house and 495 feet tall.) 

 The water company was quick to correct this problem upon hearing about 
it - but imagine if I had enrolled in the automatic payment program which 
subtracts bills directly from my bank account...

Just in time for the holiday season comes a new feature for the
PC - self-executing and playing Christmas Cards you can send to people 
with only E-Mail reception.

Did you know that it is possible to write a complex program on the PC
using only ASCII printing characters ? XOR, AND, branching JMPs, PUSH,
POP, SUB, INC, and DEC all exist within the range of 40h-7Eh. True,
not all register and memory combinations can be used but enough.

After seeing an example done, I set out to make a few tests of my own
and have determined that is possible to write a program using only
ASCII characters that can decode and transfer execution to a "normal"
.COM file that has been ASCII-encoded something like UUENCODE.

Of course with UUENCODE the problem is that first you needed to have the
UUDECODE program. With an ASCII-executable program, the medium is the message.

This is just what the world needs: self-extracting and executing E-Mail.

CNN Reported that more than a dozen calls went into the Philadelphia 911 
center to report a riot and fighting.  Reports from callers ranged from 
civil to frantic as they called to report a serious incident occurring, 
while the 911 dispatch operators ranged from uninterested to downright rude.

A sample of one of the calls reported was something like this:

   Caller:   We need the police at 7100 Ridgeway, there's a group of 
             people in a fight...
   Dispatch: (Bored) Is that all?
   Caller:   (Incredulous) IS THAT ALL?   There's a caravan of cars 
             coming down here to participate in a damn riot, that's all!

Another caller returned a call reporting a fight verging on a riot in their
area.  The 911 Dispatcher replied that she didn't know where they were.

It's that response that I wonder about; aren't most large city 911 
systems equipped with name and ID for calls that come in?  Smaller 
Cities, I can understand may simply use 911 as a substitute for dialing 
their emergency number and may not have name/phone lookup capability.

What got people upset was that, despite over a dozen 911 calls, police 
still took 40 minutes to show up, at which point they called the coroner 
to handle one dead 14-year-old, killed by some other teenagers armed with 
nothing stronger than baseball bats.  (So much for the claims that gun 
control would make the streets safer.)

You can have all the high technology in the world and all the latest 
equipment, but if you either don't have the people on hand, or the people 
you have don't care, the technology can make things worse.

Electronic Snap (UK "PC Week" magazine, 22 November 1994)

Not-so saintly shoppers in Marks and Spencer's will soon find themselves
matched up in an electronic version of Snap! if they dare try beating the
latest security move. The company will use ceiling mounted video cameras
fitted to computers to compare pictures of known shoplifters in a trial in
one of its stores. Watch out, Beadle's about, and the police aren't far
away.

  [Obvious risk of false positives ( which shoplifter do I look like? ),
  false data being in the computer in the first place etc.]

  Jeremy Beadle is a much hated/loved TV presenter in the UK who presents a
  show a little like Candid Camera. Snap! is a card game played
  (predominantly) by children. The objective is to match two identical

It would be nice to know just how bad the bug is.  Intel certainly isn't
being very helpful.  I ran a set of experiments this last weekend and found
819 divide cases with less than single-precision accuracy on the pentium.  I
found 66 cases with just 14 bits accuracy (as in the first 4195835/3145727
example).  BTW, that example was originally posted to comp.sys.intel by Tim
Coe of Vitesse Semiconductor.

More info on my experiments is at: <A HREF="ftp://www.isi.edu/pub/carlton/pentium">ftp://www.isi.edu/pub/carlton/pentium</A> 

For another simple example (the smallest my searching found), try the 
following in a spreadsheet or calculator program running on a pentium:
        5505001/294911 = 18.66600093 on a buggy pentium
                       = 18.66665197 the correct answer

The original reports of the bug mentioned double precision cases which
returned 29 or so bits of accuracy, instead of the expected 52.  At
that point I wasn't very concerned by the bug (we had just taken
delivery of a pentium workstation and I convinced the machine's user
that it wasn't necessary to ask for a replacement processor).  I've
since changed my mind.

People have correctly pointed out that there are bugs in the OS, the
compiler, your application program, etc.  How many programs really need
need more than 29 bits accuracy? 

But Tim Coe's post showed that the error could get much worse than
that.  Tim also pointed out that the bug can occur in both single and
double precision divides.  Drawing upon his information, I was able to
come up with a small set of divisors likely to cause the bug and write
a search program that takes just 30 minutes to find the 800 cases.

The risk?  How about the way Intel marketing has handled this
situation?  They have not (yet) publicly described the extent of the
bug.  I've heard numbers like a 1 in 10^10 chance of hitting it and my
back-of-the-envelope calculations tend to agree with this.  It could
be higher though, we have no way of knowing yet.

However, Intel hasn't described the magnitude of the errors.  Could it
be less than 14-bit accuracy?  My experiments lead me to believe that
it won't get any worse, but until Intel comes forward with a description
of the cause of the bug we won't know.  Until then, can people really
rely on pentium calculations for critical work?  If you can't trust
any result there is no point in using the pentium. 

What I really don't understand is why Intel didn't set up a PC doing
random testing with one of the first pentiums off the fab line.  Doing
so would have exposed this bug in short order.  It looks like that
failure may turn out to be quite expensive.

Robert Stanley (<A HREF="mailto:rstanley@sybase.com">rstanley@sybase.com</A>) wrote in <A HREF="/Risks/16.57.html">RISKS-16.57</A> about a mishap
with a Nokia pocket sized cellular telephone.  In this instance the one
touch re-dial feature of the phone was inadvertently activated while in the
owner's pocket, resulting in a supposedly private meeting being recorded on
an answering machine.

As a (very satisfied) owner of a Nokia cell phone I would add a couple more
RISKS.  Namely, failure to become acquainted with the features of one's
high tech widgets, and/or the failure to use same.

On my model 2120 Nokia there are two features either one of which would
have prevented this mishap.  As Mr. Stanley notes, the Nokia does not have
a flip cover to protect the buttons from inadvertent presses.  I personally
think this lack is a Good Idea.  The fewer moving breakable parts the
better.  However there is definitely a need to protect the keyboard.  Nokia
handles this electronically rather than mechanically.  On my phone the
"Keyguard" function is activated by the key sequence &lt;Menu&gt;-*.  This this
puts a notice on the screen that the keyboard is protected until the same
key sequence is entered again.  One can still answer the phone with the
Keyguard active, however.  I habitually keep the Keyguard active since I
also carry my phone in my pocket.  (Pants pocket in my case -- my shirt
pocket is occupied by my "nerd protector" full of pens and pencils.)

The other Nokia feature that could have averted this problem is that the
"one touch re-dial" can be turned off via the configuration menu.
Personally I find it convenient and use it, relying on the Keyguard to
protect me from unwanted redials.

&gt; ... it is an extraordinarily sobering experience to hear 
&gt; a sensitive work discussion issuing hours later from the 
&gt; speaker of your home voice messaging system.

Question: is this real or are you just repeating the plot of Michael
Crichton's {Disclosure}?  :)

In {Disclosure}, the main character claims his boss - who is female -
sexually harassed him by placing him in a compromising situation and trying
to force him to have sex with her (he is married).  He is able to show that
she forced herself on him because he was testing a shirt-pocket sized
cellular phone, had called a friend on it, and had not hit the "END" key,
and his friend ended up with a recording of this "sensitive work discussion"
on HIS answering machine...

Life imitates fiction.

I agree with anonymized but urge: when giving "polite false" telephone
numbers to salespeople, give NULL numbers, dammit, not random ones.  I don't
want calls from your sales contacts.  (I find the TOD number (locally
853-1212) works well.)

I read this paragraph from Wired in EDUPAGE (<A HREF="mailto:listproc@educom.edu">listproc@educom.edu</A>)
and found the implications disturbing:

IRS PLANS GOLDEN EAGLE TAX RETURN
The project manager for the Internal Revenue Service's Document Processing
System described the "Golden Eagle" return, in which the government would
automatically gather all a person's tax info and then compute the tax. "If
I knew what you've made during the year, if I know what your withholding
is, if I know what your spending pattern is, I should be able to generate
for you a tax return. I am an excellent advocate of return-free filing. We
know everything about you that we need to know. Your employer tells us
everything about you that we need to know. Your activity records on your
credit cards tell us everything about you that we need to know. Through
interface with Social Security, with the DMV, with your banking
institutions, we really have a lot of information ... We could literally
file a return for you. This is the future we'd like to go to." (Wired,
Dec.'94, p.174)

The Brisbane City Council's bus service here in Australia is in the process
of introducing an electronic ticketing system on all buses.

The old system used a bunch of "ticket pads" of different denominations: 
the driver would rip off a ticket from the right pad (you'd hope! :-) ), 
punch a hole in it, collect your money, and then give you the ticket.  

The new system replaces the pads with a console which has a number of
buttons for the denominations together with a printer to print the
tickets.  There are also two green boxes just inside the door in which
commuters can insert the new magnetically encoded weekly and monthly bus
tickets to have them checked. 

I have yet to get my first magnetic monthly bus ticket so I can see how easy
it would be to reprogram it, but I'm fairly confident that with the right
equipment it is doable.  For purely educational purposes of course.  :-)
RISK #1.  I'm also interested in seeing if there is any identifying
information on the cards permitting tracking of a person's movements.  RISK #2.

The other day a schoolkid was waiting at my bus stop, and due to various
stuff-ups in the scheduling, he was forced to catch my bus rather than the
normal school bus.  During peak hour my bus is a full fare bus, but of
course the kid only had money for a half fare on him.  In such cases, some
drivers are complete mongrels and won't allow the kid on, but most will
grumble a bit and then let the kid on for a half fare. 

The driver stared at his console for a few seconds and then said
(paraphrased) "There is no way to override this thing.  Looks like you get a
free ride today" and let the kid on for nothing.  The console had
automatically detected peak hour and disabled the half fare ticket buttons.

RISK #3 is fairly familiar: while enforcing "the rules" can be a good idea,
sometimes it is necessary to override them for reasons of human kindness.

RISK #4 is that if an override button was provided, the console might log
the fact and the driver might get in trouble (and then again, it might not:
I don't know anything about the internals of the consoles yet).  At least
with the free ticket, no trace is left for the bus inspectors to whinge
about. :-)

More information on the magnetic tickets as it comes to light ...

In order to more closely stick to a self-imposed lowfat diet, I finally
broke down and bought a bread machine -- easy quick bread with no added fat.
I was so pleased with the machine that I bought my breadophilic mother one
and lugged it across the country to her house last week.

They were short on counter space in the kitchen, so they put the machine on
a side-table and plugged it into an outlet that was activated by a wall
switch that also controlled a light in the room. (I think you can guess what
is coming next, and, yes, I did warn them. They said it was only a temporary
placement and they'd remember.)

Sure enough, in the middle of the bread machine's 4-hour cycle, my
stepfather turned off the light in the room (and thus removed power from the
bread machine). I noticed this some indeterminate time later.

Problem #1: The bread machine has no NVRAM. So I had no idea whether it had
been through only its first rise, or through a first rise, punchdown ("gas
squeeze out"; this was a Japanese machine), and second rise.

Problem #2: The machine has a dough setting that will allow you to make
dough, but not bake the dough. But there is no setting that says, "I already
have dough, I just want you to bake it."

Problem #3: Neither my stepfather nor I had ever baked a loaf of bread by
hand. Not once in our lives. And bread is quite a bit more sensitive to time
and temperature than most other simple food items.

Luckily, I had also purchased a bread machine cookbook for my mother that
suggested that one make a loaf of bread by hand first to get a feel for the
process, then proceed to using the machine. I used the book's baking
time/temperature settings and ended up with an edible loaf of finished
product. But, had we not had that book....

Along with Erik Heels (The Legal List), I own a list for law students 
discussion law &amp; technology (StudentLawTech).  We have just weathered a 
particularly disturbing incident, and would like some feedback on what has 
been done in the past with issues like these.

The facts, as near as we can tell, are these: a user set his e-mail system
to refuse mail from the list.  The system generated a refuse message for the
sender to notify the sender that the message had not been read.

Since the list was the sender, this refusal notification was sent to the
list.  Because the e-mail system did not stamp the message with a
"mailer-daemon" or some other appropriate flag, the list did not filter it
out.  The refusal notification was sent to the list.

Because the original user was not set to nomail (opting, instead, to do this
at his level, rather than at the list level), he received the refusal
notification.  This notification in turn produced a notification of its own.
The loop was started, and multiplied exponentially.

The system was not fully corrected until Saturday night, a full three days
after the loops had begun.  While we can't be sure, we think the total
number of these looped messages prior to the fix on Saturday was near 1000
messages to each subscriber.

Needless to say, many have unsubscribed from the list.  In addition,
countless law students are now faced with the annoyance of having to delete
mass quantities of mail.  Most worrisome, of course, are those that pay for
incoming e-mail.

So -- has this happened before?  If so, what systems were involved?  How was
the situation remedied?  What were the consequences?

Any advice is very welcomed.  Replies by e-mail are preferred, but I will 
monitor this list.

Thanks for your help!

&gt;From the September/October 1994 (Vol 9, #5) issue of "Accessability", a
newsletter that came with my most recent statement for my cell phones.
Reproduced without permission.  The flyer generally contains the typical
marketing hype about ways to use your cell phone "more productively" (i.e.,
run up a bigger bill).  The following anecdote is quoted in its entirety.

AIRTIME - Your Cellular Success Stories

Greg Maida
Herkimer, NY
     "We are in the craft business, and we use our NYNEX Mobile cellular
phone to transmit credit card charges.  This has saved us a lot of brief,
because we are able to get credit card approvals within about 30 seconds.
The cellular phone gives us the convenience of a phone at any locations and
enables us to offer more purchasing options to customers."

***

What can I say?  Why worry about sending your credit card over the
Internet, when this vendor will send it out over radio waves for you!

Just to add a little irony to this whole discussion, in the very same
newsletter, on the facing page, appears the following "tip":

     "Remember to lock your cellular phone!  You will reduce the risk of
incurring fraudulent calls if you phone is stolen.  Don't consider this
precaution an inconvenience.  Lock your phone whenever you park your car
with a parking attendant.  If your phone can be removed, we recommend
carrying it with you when you leave the car unattended."

The only word that springs to mind here is chutzpah!

  Phone systems do not exist in a vacuum, nor is restarting them as simple
as flipping a switch.  
  In this case, there'd be diagnostics to make sure that nothing actually
*was* burned out.  Then reloading the phone database and configuration 
information.  The information might include special features with each phone
for caller ID, forwarding numbers, voicemail options, et cetra.  Next comes 
routing information from the various neighborhood multiplexors to the central
office.  Last, but not least, you have to convince any other computer system 
you are connected with (long distance carriers, billing computers, ...) that
your system is alive and well again.

&gt;Lessons: First, this failure seems to be a perfect example of the fact that 
&gt;grounding problems are notoriously difficult to diagnose.  Second, I suspect 
&gt;that nobody involved in the design of modern ESS systems would have guessed 
&gt;that it would take 2 hours to restore service after the fault was repaired.  

  "You get what you pay for," may be the case here.  A "small" town with one
system has all or nothing failures.  New York, on the other hand, can shunt
calls over to other offices while one is restoring.
  Multiple redundancy is the most common "solution" to make a system fault
tolerant.

  These are only the technological factors...  A human factors:
  A new system having been recently installed: how many trained technicians 
did they have on hand, well versed in the new system lore?  There's a fair 
chance a technician from the system manufacturer had to race out, and this 
accounted for a bulk of that time.

Some years ago I received a water bill from the Village of Shorewood in
Wisconsin that was about 30 times too large.  In my case also the
problem was due to a failed repeater that mounted on the outside of my
house and was delivered an electrical pulse each time 100 cubic feet
of water was registered by the actual meter in the basement.

The system had been installed over ten years ago and had (apparently)
been missing pulses from the very first.  No one had noted the slight
decrease in billing until the system finally had a hard failure and
reported no water use during a quarter-year.  When the new repeater
was installed it was manually set to agree with the water meter in the
basement (Wisconsin folks are smarter than they are in Missouri) and
therefore included all of the "ticks" missed over a ten year period.
They all appeared on the next bill.

Since we had, in fact, used the water that was billed there was no
question we should pay. What was in doubt was just how much.   Water
rates had increased substantially during the period because of the
inclusion of sewer costs within the water bill during recent years.
Negotiation with the village over the question "how much water was used
when" settled the issue.

What's the risk?  New machinery will soon enable more and more utility
billing to be done automatically.  Many of these systems will depend on

in re: Mathew Lodge's posting in 16.58:

I was wondering if this was going to make it into RISKS.  I saw a TV report
on the story (a re-use of an NBC story of the BBC story, apparently).  There
was the mention of the Internet, there was the use of the word "hacker", but
there was, technically, no security system "breaking".  Social engineering,
definitely.  Stupidity, beyond question.  Loss of confidentiality, loss of
privacy, yes, and again, yes.  But no hacking, cracking or phreaking.  Indeed,
since the original informant is still unidentified, the word "hacker", even
in its most debased usage, is extremely suspect.

The risks as I see it, is that once again the public is being led to believe
that evil and powerful "hackers" can invade even the most highly protected
inner sanctum of one of the worlds best secured telecom systems.  In reality
the "keepers of the keys" have simply left the doors wide open.

Can't speak for Intel, but at Digital, our Alpha AXP processors are tested
using psudo-random techniques which do exactly that.  Random testing often
finds interesting problems that would never be found by just writing
specific tests.  (The genetic algorithm folks can give lots of data on why
this is so.)  To implement the random method though, you have to code a
entire simulation of the results that the CPU will produce.

Unfortunately, as readers of this group will appreciate, occasionally the
template that describes the correct response, or limiting the range to test
will be itself in error.  (Comparing a transistor model to a bad software
model is a good example of the first kind of error.)  Even if all is set up
perfectly, I've seen cases where it took several weeks to expose a bug.

The problem I have with Intel's handling of this is the use of the word
"chance", as if there was a random factor involved, that a calculation
will work right one time and fail the next so you can just run it again and
get the right result. Of course no such thing is true, but that's the
impression Intel's (deliberately?) spreading.

Also, people hear about a "1 in 10^10" chance and think it refers to some
statistical probability that their system will have a problem, rather than
a measure of the proportion of inputs that will (consistently) produce an
invalid response. For programs that require double precision calculations
and involve arbitrary input the "chance" of that program hitting the bug
approaches unity.

Nope... Pentium Bingo isn't a game of chance at all.

The chairman of the Computer Science Department at Hope College (when I was

classes that, "any idiot can write a very fast sort routine, if it doesn't
have to put the elements into the correct order." (That may not be an exact

It looks like intel has figured out that they can write a very fast
floating point unit, if it doesn't have to produce the correct results!

Andy Grove has asked me to post the following for him. Since it is the
weekend and we are out of the office, I am posting from my home system.

Richard Wirt
Director SW Technology
Intel Corp


This is Andy Grove, president of Intel.  I'd like to comment a bit on the
conversations that have been taking place here.

First of all, I am truly sorry for the anxiety created among you by our
floating point issue.  I read thru some of the postings and it's clear that
many of you have done a lot of work around it and that some of you are very
angry at us.

Let me give you my perspective on what has happened here.

The Pentium processor was introduced into the market in May of '93 after the
most extensive testing program we at Intel have ever embarked on.  Because
this chip is three times as complex as the 486, and because it includes a
number of improved floating point algorithms, we geared up to do an array of
tests, validation, and verification that far exceeded anything we had ever
done. So did many of our OEM customers.  We held the introduction of the
chip several months in order to give them more time to check out the chip
and their systems.  We worked extensively with many software companies to
this end as well.

We were very pleased with the result.  We ramped the processor faster than
any other in our history and encountered no significant problems in the user
community.  Not that the chip was perfect; no chip ever is.  From time to
time, we gathered up what problems we found and put into production a new
"stepping" -- a new set of masks that incorporated whatever we corrected.
Stepping N was better than stepping N minus 1, which was better than
stepping N minus 2.  After almost 25 years in the microprocessor business, I
have come to the the conclusion that no microprocessor is ever perfect; they
just come closer to perfection with each stepping.  In the life of a typical
microprocessor, we go thru half a dozen or more such steppings.

Then, in the summer of '94, in the process of further testing (which
continued thru all this time and continues today), we came upon the floating
point error.  We were puzzled as to why neither we nor anyone else had
encountered this earlier.  We started a separate project, including
mathematicians and scientists who work for us in areas other than the
Pentium processor group to examine the nature of the problem and its impact.

This group concluded after months of work that (1) an error is only likely
to occur at a frequency of the order of once in nine billion random floating
point divides, and that (2) this many divides in all the programs they
evaluated (which included many scientific programs) would require elapsed
times of use that would be longer than the mean time to failure of the
physical computer subsystems.  In other words, the error rate a user might
see due to the floating point problem would be swamped by other known
computer failure mechanisms.  This explained why nobody -- not us, not our
OEM customers, not the software vendors we worked with and not the many
individual users -- had run into it.

As some of you may recall, we had encountered thornier problems with early
versions of the 386 and 486, so we breathed a sigh of relief that with the
Pentium processor we had found what turned out to be a problem of far lesser
magnitude.  We then incorporated the fix into the next stepping of both the
60 and 66 and the 75/90/100 MHz Pentium processor along with whatever else
we were correcting in that next stepping.

Then, last month Professor Nicely posted his observations about this problem
and the hubbub started.  Interestingly, I understand from press reports that
Prof. Nicely was attempting to show that Pentium-based computers can do the
jobs of big time supercomputers in numbers analyses.  Many of you who posted
comments are evidently also involved in pretty heavy duty mathematical work.

That gets us to the present time and what we do about all this.

We would like to find all users of the Pentium processor who are engaged in
work involving heavy duty scientific/floating point calculations and resolve
their problem in the most appropriate fashion including, if necessary, by
replacing their chips with new ones.  We don't know how to set precise rules
on this so we decided to do it thru individual discussions between each of
you and a technically trained Intel person.  We set up 800# lines for that
purpose. It is going to take us time to work thru the calls we are getting,
but we will work thru them.  I would like to ask for your patience here.

Meanwhile, please don't be concerned that the passing of time will deprive
you of the opportunity to get your problem resolved -- we will stand behind
these chips for the life of your computer.

Sorry to be so long-winded -- and again please accept my apologies for the
situation.  We appreciate your interest in the Pentium processor, and we
remain dedicated to bringing it as close to perfection as possible.

I will monitor your communications in the future -- forgive me if I can't
answer each of you individually.

Andy Grove

There is a bug in Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh in which results from
linked spreadsheets are incorrectly recalculated.

A friend of mine who owns a business overdrew his company checking account
by $4,000 as a result.  

Interestingly, he had a "fail-safe" system, in which his accountant
recommended which bills to pay based on the total account balances.  The
accountant recommend he pay a bill for about $2,000, then inadvertently
credited this to the balance sheet rather than debiting it.  My friend
checked the accountants work using a linked spreadsheet.  The calculation
showed that he had $4,000 more then was really available.  The unlikely
coincidence of making a manual mistake that matched a software error
convinced my friend that it was safe to write the check.

My friend can easily duplicate the bug.  Apparently the bug is being
discussed on Compuserve these days, with the word being that it only happens
on really complicated spreadsheets.  My friends spreadsheets, though, are
quite simple - one spreadsheet to tally the checking balance, one to tally
the credit card account balance, and a third to total the two accounts.

Hasn't everybody done this forever?

Back in the '60s (yes that's "sixties") I watched IBM upgrade a 7090 to a
7094.  The third *day* of the post-upgrade verification was a test of the
new floating point arithmetic (a 7094 upgrade added double precision) using
randomly generated data and a fixed-point simulation of the FP for
comparison.

I asked the IBM CE whether that twenty-four hours of floating-point testing
was really necessary.  He replied "Yup. I've seen the test run OK for
sixteen hours and then find a failure."

Last week, a friend was writing software to make credit checks as part
of a large project involving government loans to individuals.  He
returned home and told his wife we'd been using my social security
number to test the interface, with my permission.  His wife works at a
bank, and she told him he'd better not do three checks on me, or I
wouldn't get any more credit.  I was surprised to hear that a credit
check carries with it this sort of penalty.  Can anyone from the
credit industry confirm this?

  My friend was recently given a "test" SSN to use, so I shouldn't
have to worry more.

The 26 Nov 1994 issue of The Economist has a story on electronic money
(p.21--23). It covers some of the current attempts to create "virtual banks"
on the internet so that consumers can buy from electronic stores without
sending credit card numbers in the clear.  This is fairly mundane stuff to
risks readers, but the story moves on to the evolution of digital cash. Some
of the possibilities are interesting, such as private issuers of E-cash
(that will probably be more stable than most governments!) to a world-wide
currency (no exchanges rates and middle-people). Recommended reading if
you're curious about some of the broader issues of electronic money.

Recently, my wife and I decided to go to see a movie at one of the cinemas
in downtown Toronto.  It was a rainy day, and there was a long line-up to
see the film.  I noticed that just inside the foyer of the theatre were a
couple of automatic ticket dispensing machines.  Nobody was at the machines,
save for a couple of kids who were playing with them.

I had used the automatic ticket vending machines before, and they operate 
in a similar fashion to automatic teller machines.  Instead of cash, you 
get film tickets. You can also buy things like popcorn and cola in the form 
of tickets that you take to the concession stand.  It was my wife's treat, 
so she shooed away one of the boys who was playing with one of the 
machines, and proceeded to swipe her credit card in the card-reader.

Tickets began to pour from the machine.  General Admission, Senior's and 
Children's tickets along with coupons for purchasing a small mountain of 
popcorn and a river of cola issued from the machine, like a one-armed 
ticket-dispensing bandit gone mad.  In the end my wife was charged for 
approximately $375.00 of goods.  The kids who had been playing with the 
machine before were nowhere to be seen, and the movie was about to begin.

What had happened was this: the kids who had been playing with this machine 
had made just about every conceivable selection on its touch-screen before 
my wife got to it.  Part of the reason why it must have been fun for them 
to play with is because you do not have to prove your purchasing power with 
a credit/bank card beforehand.  You can make as many on-screen selections 
as you like, and it will merrily rack up the total charges.  

While there is a screen that asks if you want to purchase all of the items 
you have selected, to someone inexperienced with these types of machines, 
it appeared to be a "start" screen.  A further risk was revealed when my 
wife used her Credit Card with the machine.  It has it's PIN number 
built-in, (convenient by highly RISK-y) so the moment she swiped the card 
past the reader, it confirmed the order immediately.

In the end the staff at the theatre were very helpful, and at the end of 
the movie my wife handed over her receipt from the machine, and expected to 
have the charges on her credit card reversed.  Instead she was paid back in 
cash directly from the box- office takings by the theatre manager.  When I 
asked why, it turned out that there was no procedure between the bank that 
installed the automatic ticket dispensing machines and the theatre-chain to 
deal with this type of situation.  The manager said that they'd definitely 
"have to look into it".  Luckily a bank was nearby and payment to my wife's 
account was made before any interest charges could accumulate.

When we went back to the same theatre again recently for another movie, I 
noticed a couple of changes.  A ticket-agent stood guard to make sure that 
nobody played around with the machines who didn't intend to purchase 
anything, and there was a large sheet of instructions placed beside each 
machine.  I paid for the tickets this time, and used a bank card that does 
not have a built-in PIN number.  Everything went smoothly this time: we got 
the tickets we requested, and managed to zip past the rest of line and got 
good seats in the theatre.

The movie was good too!

One of the frequently referenced style guides for programming (the Indian
Hill guide, I think) talks about the value of good defaults. The current
Slackware Linux distribution does not do so in one important area, and
I was able to 'explore' a system due to this flaw in the installation:

Slackware does not force a root password on install. 

The system in question was hooked up to the internet for casual use by
someone I have known for a long time. Apparently, the two way nature
of a PPP link didn't cross the minds of the three people involved in
getting the system on the net, and they never set any passwords.

I was able to get in as root and make clear to the machine's owner
that he had no security.

I called him afterwords and we set things up much tighter, but it's
disturbing to me that neither the OS install nor the network software
install forces you to set any password.

To be sure, this is freeware, and is to be used by an experienced user
community, but it was all to easy for them to escape onto the net
without any warnings. I have noticed many linux systems on the net
that still have the default users (gonzo et al) still installed.

Good defaults, I think, would solve this.

 &gt; This is just what the world needs: self-extracting and executing E-Mail.

This was the case with several commercial (non-smtp) mail packages such as
Novell's MHS. Several years ago I was developing software for the Novell
platform (I still do when people throw money at me to do it :). I was having
problems with one of my programs.  I uuencoded the file and sent it to a
<A HREF="mailto:buddy@novell.com">buddy@novell.com</A>, along with source, and for some reason :) the
early-version MHS mail system immediately began to self extract the file.

Unfortunately, I had given the UUENCODED .NLM (Netware Server Executable)
file a hard path (thinking that the smart engineer would see it and know
where I had installed it, and yet being smart enough not to put it in a
critical system).

Unfortunately, it had been expanded on a system by a dumb computer :) where
the NW developer also had *root* like privs, so the file would expand and be
placed anywhere in the netware file server system. Luckily the program never
loaded (although if it had been given a name of a program that was loaded
periodically life as we had known it would have ceased to exist) and I found
out about it through a *confirmation message* sent to me by the mailer.

Now think about this and remember the internet worm (this was *years*
later). I told my buddy about this by email and within a couple of weeks
there was a patch update to MHS.  I got a lot of phone calls from Novell
developers trying to figure out what I had done.

Basically, I could send a new password files to *supervisor* (NW's *root*)
and then after that set file privilages by email to my hearts content.
Scary.

Let me just say that MHS doesn't do that anymore. And yes, I've tried to
break it (with permission) without success since.  But I'm a medium-smart
hacker. Some real devils out there could probably figure out a way to mess
greatly with such systems, especially now that MIME and WWW are becoming
more commonplace (what about Web-bombs using creaky web forms? It has been
done by a relatively good hacker buddy of mine in a couple of minutes).

I am distrustful of the security of any system that allows a person to place
a file without explicit authorization, as well as authentication (web forms,
FTP, and self-extracting mail). Digital sigs will keep unauthorized people
from doing dangerous things, but it won't keep authorized people from doing
things that cause stupid computers to do stupid things.

Connie Chung's "Eye to Eye" (ABC, 12/1/94) provided an excellent primer on
accidental electronic interference.  (My book is a pretty good source, too.
Can't resist the 'plug.') They brought into living room TV color clarity
more hard examples of EMI:

     * Children's life support systems failing by cell-phone induced EMI.
     * Defibrillators malfunctioning.
     * Wheelchairs spinning in circles from portable radio interference.
     * Airplane (727) avionics and guidance systems (both primary 
       and secondary) going haywire from passenger radio.

The focus was on _accidental_ EMI events, which were low power events at
that.  Radio emissions and cell phones and such are not power intensive
devices (a few hundred milliwatts) but still can cause dramatic systemic
failures.

Obviously (for those who know my work) when intentional EMI is "turned up"
to higher power levels, the interference is increased as well.  Thus, as I
discussed in "Information Warfare," when a bad guy has the capability to
generate electromagnetic fields of a greater strength, control the frequency
and focus or aim them upon targets, we can similarly expect to see man-made
EMI events of greater intensity in greater numbers.

Bringing down financial econo-technical infrastructures (among other
targets) through electromagnetic denial of service attacks is on its way, if
it's not here already.  I am currently investigating a number of fascinating
`incidents.'  (Please let me know if you think you might have been `hit' by
either HERF Gun or EMP/T Bomb assaults.)

A while back [<A HREF="/Risks/16.26.html">RISKS-16.26</A>] I also posted in RISKS how airplane avionics
interference is caused by on board digital devices and how such
vulnerabilities could be exploited by suicidal maniacs or those of the
terrorist flavor.  I also recall a number of readers "doubting nay-sayers"
pooh-poohing such hogwash.

Take a watch of Connie. HERF is again being vindicated.

I ran across the following product description in the Shareware Express

  ``COMPUTERIZE YOUR EMPLOYEE TIMECLOCK.  Save time and money.  Convert
    your PC into an employee timeclock and bring timekeeping and payroll
    tasks into the 20th century!  TIMECLOCK logs your employees "in" and

                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Talk about your bold statements.

But what if you run it on a Pentium? :-)

While I'm on the subject of the Pentium I would just like to toss in my
$0.02.  I don't have a problem with the fact that the chip had a bug ...
it's certainly not the first and it sure won't be the last.  I *do* have a
problem with the way Intel has handled the situation and I'm speaking as
someone who manages 3 Pentium systems.  Since I'm at a university research
lab, I had no problem getting replacements but others are not so lucky.

As CPUs get more and more complex, the chance of bugs slipping through will
probably go up.  I just hope whichever company it happens to next handles
the problem better than Intel.

Cellular One of the Baltimore-Washington area just distributed a notice to
all customers that they have cut off roaming in the New York City area.
They say that fraud has become too serious a problem.  It is now not
possible to have your calls forwarded to you in NYC.  If you wish to make an
outcoming call in NYC, an operator will take a credit card number and
immediately bill that at rates considerably higher than the normal roaming
rates (which are in turn considerably higher than the regular cellular
rates).

The fraud is that thieves have been stealing electronic id numbers by
scanning the cellular frequencies and picking them out; they then program
those numbers in new (cheap) phones and sell them on the streets.  By the
time one finds out that someone else has cloned one's phone, hundreds or
thousands of dollars of calls will have been logged.

   [This problem is of course very widespread.  It's more like
   CRIMINALS $1B, CELLULAR ZERO.  Some countermeasures are of course
   possible, but are impeded by lack of standards, lack of exportability,
   lack of incentives by vendors, lack of customer interest in paying more,
   etc.  PGN]

That is not what happened at all.  The bridge hands are dealt out by this
machine, and it is set to deal out the same sets of hands until someone
resets it, or puts in a new set of hands.

The machine wasn't used between the two tournaments, so it dealt out the
last set of hands that was fed into it.

Usually when hands are duplicated like this, it's the same set of hands
being used by humans, not the same set being generated by a machine.

As usual -- pilot error.

Mailer loops have probably been around since the dawn of e-mail.  They're
often astonishing, but they shouldn't be: any time mail can be generated by
an automaton (e.g. error messages, "vacation" programs), or a single message
can spawn multiple messages (e.g.  "mail exploders" such as listserv), you
have a system with gain.  Undamped positive feedback can yield spectacular
results, but again, this shouldn't be too surprising.

Anyone writing mail software, even of a rudimentary nature, which has even a
hint of a possibility of inducing any gain, needs to be acutely aware of
these problems, and to take every step possible to reduce the opportunities
for positive feedback and to detect and damp it when (not if) it occurs.
Without taking such precautions, disastrous mail loops are a certainty; with
them, they are merely likely.  (In other words, even mail systems which were
supposedly designed to prevent loops are fairly regularly surprised when
real-world installations discover new ways to connect some pieces together
into feedback loops which manage to bypass any safeguards.)

I believe there was an article discussing this sort of thing in CACM in 1989
or 1990; unfortunately, I no longer have the reference.

OK. There's a number of things a list can do to prevent this sort of
problem. You are probably doing at least some of these:

	1. Stamp outgoing list mail as being "junk". I believe that
	   this is in the "precedence" header. Many systems toss "junk"
	   mail when it's refused.

	2. Set outgoing mail to have an "Errors-To:" address.

	3. Drop incoming mail that is marked as being "junk".

If you were doing all of these things, then the fault is due to the bouncing
software. It should really support all three (mark its mail as junk, drop
junk mail instead of bouncing it, and respond to an errors-to address), but
for it to support NONE of the three is serious brokenness.

&gt; So -- has this happened before?

Lots of times. A lot of people keep a human in the loop to prevent this
sort of error cascade. The only other thing you can do is to be totally anal
retentive about how you treat headers. The three items I listed above are
just a start.

	The "vacation" command will cause the same problem, albeit it only
sends one "I'm not here" notice to the entire list before ceasing
auto-responding. As far as I know, there is no automatic way for the list
processor to detect such auto-replies, and they will occur whenever anyone
remains subscribed to a list while on "vacation".

	In 1989, in the Geophysics department at Stanford, a similar
incident involving the Bay Area Chinese Student's mailing list caused
all our departmental computers to crash. In that case someone had
simply forwarded _all_ their mail to the list processor shortly before
going on vacation. The reply addresses kept getting longer with each
round-trip iteration, until they overflowed the fixed-length field in
the Berkeley mail programs allocated for that string, causing the
mail daemon to keep running doing nothing forever. After an hour or
so there would be dozens of superuser-priority mail daemons all attempting
to run simultaneously and the machine would crash. (Our machines crashed
first because in our department we had the highest density of subscribers
to that list.)

	The moral of the story: anything which replicates itself has
the built-in potential of becoming a cancer / virus.

	Note the designers of "mail" recognized the problem and designed
in prevention against infinite mail loops, by the brute force expedient
of killing messages more than a certain number of hops old.

TVTEKWAR.RVW  941201
 
Bill Shatner has been reading "Snow Crash" (cf BKSNCRSH.RVW)!
 
In tonight's episode of Tekwar, we find that police detectives, and the
hero's ex-wife, have been felled by a nasty virus.  A *computer* virus.
Call the Weekly World News.
 
Shatner is *much* more ambitious than Stephenson.  The "Snow Crash" virus,
in graphical representation, looked pretty much as you'd expect--snow!  The
Tekwar virus looks like a young lady.  (When she starts to open her blouse,
you get just a hint of circuitry and bright light.  Hubba, hubba!)
 
Oh, come now, Rob.  Don't be a spoil sport.  They can make programs that
look like text, can't they?  So why can't they make programs that look like
pictures?  Well, it is true that I have copies of the BOO programs, which
are utilities for converting binary files into a format that was only
printable characters.  I understand that there is an MS-DOS program, called
COMt, which turns COM files into *executable* forms, using only printable
characters.  (Padgett Peterson was so taken with the idea that he wrote his
Christmas card program using only printable characters.)  The "text"
programs, however, don't exactly look like a letter from Mom--they look like
strings of garbage.  Paradoxically, graphics images (realistic graphics,
that is) give you even *less* leeway, since the human eye is *very* good at
picking up anomalies.
 
The Tekwar virus is recovered from an imperfectly erased copy of the
graphic.  Under extrapolative recreation, the virus is virulent enough that
just looking at it will fry your computer.  (Try *that* with your average
copy of Stoned.  "Lossy" compression wins again!)  (By the way, in *that*
picture, the young lady has her shirt *on*.)
 
If you look at the virus, it renders you unconscious.  Fair enough: flashing
lights can stimulate epileptic seizures.  However, thereafter the virus
slowly causes *physical* degradation of your nervous system.  Oh, please.
What's the nerve equivalent of JMP?
 
Stay tuned *next* week, when Bill Shatner uses the I-word.  (Pay close
attention when he announces the virus is loose.)

The "Stars and Stripes" (a "small-town" newspaper in English for the
military communities in Europe, to which I am also allowed to subscribe in
order to read the comics every day...) reports that the payments for the
civilian employees in Germany this month were credited to the accounts of
the employees twice. Seems that the payroll tape is usually run on the 24th
of a month. Someone bright noticed that the 24th is turkey day, and ran the
tape on the 23rd. Some other bright person also ran the tape on the 25th
since the 24th was a holiday.... Suddenly they noticed that there were about
3.5 million dollars missing (good thing they have a bookkeeping system!).
The "turkeys" spent most of Saturday fussing with the system and rolling
back the second set of transactions.  It is reported that the civilians are
hoping for another such windfall at Christmas...

  [Russell submitted a longish item on how his phone company cleared a
  check of his for $150, but did not credit his account.  To make a 
  long story short, he had changed his address and phone number from his
  parents' home, and the $150 was credited to his OLD phone number, which 
  was the number that appeared on his check.  His father did not notice 
  the credit on the home account.  Apparently his phone company ignores the
  number on the bill!  GROAN.  PGN]

In other words, that little portion of the bill that you tear off and put in
the envelope with your payment is completely useless, because they only
check the phone number ON THE CHECK ITSELF. I don't know how many phone
companies use this type of a system, but let this serve as a warning to
anyone who has recently changed address...

     On December 5, the {Dallas Morning News}, not the most
technically-aware newspaper in the world, ran an article from the {San Jose
Mercury News} about the recent Pentium FDIV situation.
     Unfortunately, they ran it through a spell-checker first.  The company
names "Intel" and "Megatest" became "Until" and "Megadeath," which actually
puts an interesting slant on the story.
     I've only ever seen one writer's byline on computer-related articles in
the DMN, so the root problem may be that no one else at the paper knows
enough to catch this obvious (to us) error.

&gt; As CPUs get more and more complex, the chance of bugs slipping through will
&gt; probably go up.  I just hope whichever company it happens to next handles
&gt; the problem better than Intel.

When Inmos designed the T8 series of Transputers, they used formal methods
to prove that the algorithms used in the on-chip FPU were correct. I am
frankly amazed that a huge company like Intel relies solely on testing the
hell out of a new chip -- which, of course, *proves* nothing. If a small
British company like Inmos can prove an IEEE math FPU correct, why can't
Intel?

Perhaps this recent debacle will convince at least some people that formal
methods can be cheaper than mistakes.

Except that "Errors-To" was introduced by sendmail, and is not in any RFC,
822 or otherwise.  The 822 Police will arrest YOU for false arrest.  :-)
(The Risk in assuming the most popular implementation of a protocol is The
Way Things Are.  See also Return-Receipt-To:)

The correct way is to set the envelope FROM to the bounce address.
On those systems which don't have envelope addresses, it's up
to them on how to preserve the bounce address in-band -- which is where
much of the problems with mailing loops get started.

It's surprising the number of people (and therefore the number of
misconfigured mailers and gateways) which don't understand the mail
specs.  However, it's understandable given that 822 and 821 are 12
years old and are probably one of the most cryptic and vague out there,
especially considering how critical they are to the Net.  They really
need to be updated and clarified.

Something like "Precedence: junk" is bad, because there's never any
feedback to the system.  Addresses which fail simply get tossed, and
they never get removed from the list.  The list grows linearly, and you
waste more and more resources trying to deliver mail to addresses that
go nowhere anyway.

I am a unix system administrator at the University of Virginia and we
regularly run across "abandoned" mailboxes that are growing rapidly with
messages from busy mailing lists.  This is particularly troublesome over the
summer break and winter holidays.  I have noticed that some mailing lists
have what I call a "deadman switch" feature, whereby the listserver
periodically sends all subscribers a message requesting that they confirm
their subscription by replying.  Anyone who fails to reply gets
unsubscribed.  When a user is unsubscribed in this fashion, the listserver
sends a final message with instructions for getting back on the list.  I
think that some of these lists are smart enough to not send requests for
confirmation to members who have posted to the list recently.  I think that
this is an excellent feature because many folks who subscribe to lists never
figure out how to get off them or never bother. Some folks get a new account
and never bother to deal with mail still coming to the old one.

I encourage anyone who runs a high volume mailing list to consider using a
deadman switch to ensure that mail is going to mailboxes that are actually
being read.

It would also help if mailing list administrators would regularly
send out a brief message with information on how to unsubscribe.

%T   "Applied Cryptography"
 
For anyone who wants to study cryptography, you can save yourself a lot of time
and effort by getting Schneier's book.  From the simple Caesar cipher to RSA
and beyond, there is nothing the book doesn't at least touch on.  Protocols,
techniques, algorithms, and even source code are included.  A "Real World"
section looks both at specific implementations and at the politics of
encryption.
 
Schneier notes that his work is *not* a mathematical text.  It is difficult to
say how much of a shortcoming this is for any given reader, but a safe bet is
"not much".  For those who do need more rigorous treatments of specific topics,
the bibliography lists almost a thousand references, all of which are
described and cited within the book text at some point.
 
He also states that the encyclopedic nature of the book detracts from its
readability.  Not so.  The work is both encyclopedic *and* readable.  Schneier
has done marvelously well with what is normally a dead and dry topic.  His
examples are ludicrously absurd--and therefore lucid and memorable.  (He even
uses Monty Python's immortal phrase, "My hovercraft is full of eels" in one
illustration.)
 
As course text, research basis or just a (serious) hobbyist's reference, this
work is highly recommended.

We were having the whole family for a Hannukah party last week.
Grandpa sat at a chair next to the PC (which was up and running
Windows), holding six-month-old May in his arms.  Being a digital kid,
she quickly reached for the keyboard.  By the time we noticed and
managed to turn off the computer, half the system files were gone
(which is what we discovered the next day, when the system started to
behave strangely).

Trying to figure out what had happened, it seems little May could only reach
the bottom line of the keyboard -- but that's where the ALT, ENTER, DELETE
and the arrow keys are!  In Windows 3.1, ALT puts the cursor into the
command menu, ENTER activates the menu item it's on; in some menu, DEL
deletes the marked files...

A story with entertainment value, albeit no clear moral:

A couple of nights ago I was working away at my workstation when the world
(figuratively) collapsed: suddenly all my network connections had gone
haywire.  A little investigation revealed that /etc/hosts, the file that
lists names and IP addresses for the rest of the universe, had become
corrupted: it had huge quantities of null characters in it and very little
useful data.  How had that happened?

After some poking around and much thought, I came to the following
conclusion.  I've recently been setting up some machines for a few of my
colleagues.  The most straightforward way of getting those machines into a
sensible initial state, I thought, would be to restore the dump tapes from
my own machine onto theirs.  After all, I keep my machine in pretty decent
shape.

Of course there was no need to restore my home directory on each machine.
Instead, I told each of the other machines that my home directory was really
a link to the mounted file system that contained my home directory on my
`home' machine.  All pretty routine so far, but that turned out to be cause
number 1.

Cause number 2 was that when I cloned my machine, what I cloned included
/usr/spool, the directory with all the spool files.  That directory includes
files that tell cron, a program that starts background jobs at particular
times, what jobs to start.  That meant that the `midnight' job that normally
ran on my home machine now ran automatically on each of several machines.
Because my home directory was mounted on each of these machines, that job
did its thing simultaneously several times in the same directory.

Cause number 3 was that my midnight job, among other things, extracts a
complete new /etc/hosts file from one of our other servers and installs it.
It checks that what it got is sane, to defend against /etc/hosts becoming
empty when the server is down, but of course it doesn't defend against
having several instances running at the same time.  So what must have
happened is that two of those instances finally hit the same file at the
same time, causing parts of it to overlay other parts and general chaos to
ensue.

This Monday, 5 December 1994, I was traveling with a colleague from Denver
Stapleton to Newark on United flight 302, supposed to leave at 6:06 PM. When
we got to the airport at 3:30 (in plenty of time to beat threatened snow),
the baggage check-in agents were not actually checking-in passengers but
simply tagging bags by hand, because a power failure had brought down the
check-in database servers. After the bags where checked in, we were directed
to another agent that looked up the gate for flight 302 on a printout.
Actual passenger seat assignment and check-in was to be done manually at the
gate. Since we were early, we waited at the gate until 5 PM, not wanting to
bug the overworked gate agents until near our scheduled departure. But when
we talked to the gate agent soon after 5 PM, she told us that she had no
information about flight 302; some other flight was due to leave that gate
too close to 6:06 PM to allow time for flight 302, and she had no way of
finding out where 302 was supposed to be. She finally told us to call the
central 800 number for United reservations to check the gate info! My
colleague is a United Premier member. He called the Premier help desk, who
gave him another gate number for a supposedly on-time departure. He
communicated that information to the original gate agent, who proceeded to
announce it over the PA for other 302 passengers without further
confirmation from any other authority.

We went to the new gate, where we found neither plane nor gate agents.
We asked the agent at the next gate for help. He knew nothing about
302, and expected some other flight to use the empty gate. His paper
notes indicated the original gate for 302. But he eventually called
around, and found out yet another supposed gate for the flight.

Third time lucky. That turned out to be the correct gate, although its
electronic flight info display was showing a different flight.  All the
departures monitors in the terminal were also showing outdated and scrambled
information without any indication of its incorrectness. Enterprising gate
agents were taping paper signs with correct flight numbers over the bogus
electronic signs.

But the problems were not over. The plane for flight 302 arrived, we
boarded, and were supposed to leave just 20 or so minutes late. Except that
the flight crew was delayed in an incoming flight, and that information,
normally handled by the downed computer system, was not made available to
the ground staff for assignment of an alternate crew. We ended leaving
around 1 1/2 hour late.

This all happened in a relatively light traffic non-holiday Monday, in
pretty good weather (the snow didn't materialize). I can't imagine
what the chaos would have been like around a major holiday. It was
clear from all our interactions with all the gate agents that they
were not operating according to a well-designed, well-drilled manual
backup procedure. They behaved professionally for the most part in a
difficult situation, but much of what they were doing seemed decided
on the spot, from personal initiative, and without good phone access
to an authoritative manual database of flights and gates, even though
that information was obviously still available to the air-traffic and
airport systems, given that flights were still landing and taking off.

Time magazine (Aug 9) reports a computer error in a Pepsi promotional
lottery in the Philippines.  The computer generated 800,000 winning numbers
instead of 18.  Obviously, Pepsi didn't pay the $32 billion in prize money
their mistake would have cost them.

Pepsi has paid nearly $10 million in "appeasement" efforts ($20 "goodwill"
prize), but this apparently didn't satisfy disgruntled "winners." Over
22,000 people, each of whom believed they had won the $40,000 prize, have
filed about 5,000 criminal and 700 civil suits.  The Philippine Senate Trade
Committee faults the company for "gross negligence" and "misleading or
deceptive advertising."

If anyone knows any technical details about the nature of this
"computer error," I would like to hear about them.

The AAMP5 doesn't have floating point, but it is a real processor with

the AAMP2, of which there are 30 on board each 747-400).

The NY Times (or was it LA?) a few days ago reported that the double
precision fdiv problem in the Pentium is due to a table that was incorrectly
copied from the 486 -- not an algorithmic bug.  Many formal approaches would
not have caught this kind of error since it would have been natural to
assume that the table was correct (I mean, after all, it was generated by
computer!) Also, one of the floating point bugs in a previous x86 processor
(I think it was the atan bug in the 486) was due to electrical difficulties
-- the algorithm was correct, but the electrons had different ideas in a
certain case. This is a class of errors that only testing or circuit
simulation with accurate device models can catch.

When the T800 came out, my then employers (FEGS Ltd) were working on a
research project in collaboration with INMOS and several other partners.

At one point INMOS told us they had had to halt production of T8's after
a bug had been found in the floating-point microcode, resulting in the
wrong result being given for some IEEE-defined special case (I think
it was zero divided by zero giving the wrong flavour of NaN). I think 
the bug was found by the formal verification process, of which they were
certainly very proud.

One more point is worth mentioning: the T800 is a very simple chip 
architecture compared to something like the Pentium, and I would guess 
formal verification of the latter would be a much larger task.

Perhaps this is a case of less RISK for RISCs! (sorry, couldn't resist)

Inmos formally proved only the FPU: they didn't do it for the whole
processor.  Does the Pentium implement so many more floating point
operations that proof is intractable?

Proving that the algorithms used are correct is one thing, but getting a

where the testing comes in.

Some staff from Inmos gave a talk here some time ago on their procedure for
verifying a floating-point implementation.  Their experience was slightly
more interesting than Mathew suggested.

Apparently, in addition to their formal model they had a "known correct"
implementation built by a competitor.  All tests were verified against
this reference implementation.

At one point during testing they found that their implementation disagreed
with the reference implementation and spent quite some time trying to diagnose
the fault.  It turned out that their implementation had been correct first
time, but that they had discovered a bug in a competitor's product.

No prizes for guessing who built the reference implementation

Rob Slade's review of Schneier's book "Applied Cryptography" should have
mentioned that the book contains a substantial number of typos, and that
Schneier offers an errata sheet (<A HREF="mailto:schneier@chinet.com">schneier@chinet.com</A>).  This will be

With all this talk about self extracting mail "viruses", a friend showed me
that in emacs (which I use to read mail, along with vm) has the ability to
self-extract elisp code.  This feature seems to be turned on by default, and
it not only applies to mail read with emacs, but rather every file visited
(when the feature is on, of course).

The way it works is by having a line which reads "Local Variables:" followed
by the lisp variables you would like to set...well, it may seem petty, but
you can execute programs, make connections and much more through cleverly
written elisp code contained within.

It's simple to turn off, at any rate...

(setq enable-local-variables  f) ;; turns off feature  (in emacs 19)
(setq enable-local-variables  1) ;; makes it ask first (in emacs 19)
(setq inhibit-local-variables t) ;; turns off feature  (in emacs 18)

Anyhow, I think the risks here speak for themselves...

Shareware has a bad rap as a carrier of computer viruses. But one of the 
commercial software industry's dirtier little secrets is that viruses 
often get transmitted via shrink-wrapped boxes in stores. 

Or, sometimes, viruses just get sent to computer writers.

A California company called Bit Jugglers called me today to say a title 
they'd sent me, Kids World, was infected with a virus. This only happened 
to the copies sent to the press -- those folks who write about computer 
software in magazines or newspapers. The virus did not make it into 
copies shipped to stores.

Bit Jugglers urged me to destroy my copy of Kids World. And if I'd 
installed the software (I have not), they would have sent me the latest 
version of McAfee's Scan, a virus detection program. A new, clean copy is 
on its way to my desk.

The moral of the story is obvious. Trust NO floppy -- you don't know where
it's been. Scan everything.

I'm sure that I am not the only RISKS reader who has been bombarded by
warnings regarding the supposed "Good Times" virus.  Just about all of
the warnings I received were forwarded from two or three previous
people, said that the virus was distributed from America On-Line, and
claimed that if you were to download or read the message (which had a
subject of "Good Times"), your hard disk could be reformatted.

Each copy of the warning then suggested that people forward the
warning to as many other users and mailing lists as possible, because
of the severity of the problem.

I've seen at least one announcement from CIAC (at least, I *think* it
was from CIAC) telling people that there is indeed no virus, that most
mail readers won't automatically execute programs sent via e-mail, and
that people generally shouldn't worry.

There seem to be several risks associated with this incident:

(1) People don't understand what e-mail can and cannot do.  Most of
    the people forwarding the warnings didn't understand the
    difference between viewing a mail message and turning the contents
    of that message into an executable program, let alone the fact
    that different platforms work differently and thus would require
    separate viruses.

(2) Rumors spread quickly.  I was amazed to see just how fast this
    rumor spread; within a 24-hour period, I saw a dozen or so copies
    of the warning on five or six different mailing lists.  People
    wanted to help their fellow users (a good thing), but passed the
    warning on without verifying the rumor's validity (a bad thing).
    You could probably make a good argument that the warning itself
    was a virus!

(3) Explanations spread slowly.  More than two days after I first saw
    the virus warning, people continued to forward copies of it to
    various mailing lists -- even after I and others told list members
    that the virus announcement was probably a hoax.  It will probably
    be another few days before the CIAC warning (along with assurances
    from computer experts) reaches all of the people who are no longer
    sure whether it is safe to read their e-mail.

(4) Bugs do exist.  The fact is that there probably are holes in mail
    readers that will do nasty things to people's files and accounts.
    But now that people have been told not to worry, they'll take
    future warnings less seriously.  Without a universally known and
    trusted authority on these issues -- and let's face it, most users
    would probably trust their friends more than CIAC or CERT -- this
    may turn into the computer equivalent of the children's story,
    "The Boy Who Cried Wolf."

symposium is intended for those interested in the more practical aspects of
network and distributed system security, focusing on actual system design
and implementation, rather than in theory.  We hope to foster the exchange

The Supreme Court is divided over a case involving false arrest due to
erroneous computer data, attributed to human error.  Ruth Bader Ginsburg
was quoted thusly: ``As automation increasingly invades modern life,
the potential for Orwellian mischief grows.''  Antonin Scalia countered
that nothing is gained by excluding evidence of true wrongdoing because
some subordinate did not purge outdated information from a computer system.

The case arose after Isaac Evans was stopped in 1991 in Phoenix for a minor
traffic violation; he was arrested because of a hit identifying an
outstanding warrant --- although though that warrant had been previously
``quashed'' and should have been removed from the database.  Furthermore,
the arresting officer then detected the presence of marijuana.  The Court is
reviewing whether, under the circumstances, that evidence can be used in a
trial for drug possession in light of the false arrest.

Act 4 of Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar' opens with Mark Antony, Octavius,
and Lepidus meeting to work out the proscription that is to follow
Caesar's murder.  To be proscribed means that you are rubbed out and
your property confiscated by the people doing the proscribing.  Clearly,
proscription is a significant data processing problem since both the
rubbing out and the division of spoils have to be worked out to the
satisfaction of the proscribers.

In a recent production of Julius Caesar by the Folger Shakespeare Theater in
Washington, D.C., there was only a modest amount of tittering when one of
the proscribers arrived on stage to do the necessary work with a laptop.

    Was Folger in his Cups? or Caps?

       [Marc Rotenberg added, out of band, i.e., not in <A HREF="/Risks/16.63.html">RISKS-16.63</A> as mailed:
          If Caesar lived until proscribed at the Folger,
          he was obviously good to the last drop.]

I got the following from ba.broadcast today and felt it was worth sharing
here....

The following is an INEXACT quote from KCBS, one of our all-news radio
stations:

  ...the police have called the bomb squad to defuse the hand grenades. Until 
  the grenades are defused, the police have prohibited the use of 2-way radios 
  in the vicinity of the scene here, so we are reporting by cellular phone 
  instead of radio.

Somebody needs to tell the folks at KCBS the meaning of "radio."

Somebody also needs to give the police a clue.

There are a lot of people over in the comp.infosystems.www.* newsgroups
who are seriously talking about using the World Wide Web (WWW) as a 
digital cash system.  I get the impression they want to do this in some
number of months or a year.

Apparently they want to use the FORMS feature supported by most web browsers
in conjunction with some sort of encryption algorithm.  The idea is you
connect to a commercial site, see see something you want to pay for, fill
your credit card number in on the form, and transmit it back to the http
server with some kind of encryption.  They're talking about using some
encryption technique present or expected in the Netscape browser.

As far as I can tell this method will not involve any sort of
authentication, and it will only secure data after it has left your browser
and before it gets decrypted.

Are these people for real?  This has to be one of the most foolish things
I've heard in a long time, but I'd like to hear some comments from RISKS
readers -- I'm no expert in these matters.  It might also be an idea to
crosspost a bit of the discussion back to *.www.* to wake these folks up.

I received an envelope in the mail yesterday that was immediately
identifiable as junk mail by the word "URGENT" printed in large red
letters imitative of a rubber stamp.  Thus I was taken aback that the
envelope appeared to be hand-addressed with a felt-tip pen.

Closer examination revealed that the apparently sloppily scrawled capital
N in my first name was identical to that in "NY", the even sloppier
lower-case A in my first name was identical to those in my street name
and city name, and so forth.  Nonetheless, to the casual observer, the
effect was quite convincing.

The risk is an old one--the use of computers to perpetrate a deception.

While watching the multicast of the current IETF session [Automatic 
Address Configuration], I was presented with a message imposed by the 
broadcasting group of "<A HREF="mailto:susanp@spinnaker">susanp@spinnaker</A> please stop broadcasting".

I looked at the monitor, and sure enough, there was *another* video session
being broadcast.  For the next ~5 minutes, everyone on the multicast
backbone was allowed to watch as susanp worked on some html markup [using
hotmetal], then responded to a bit of e-mail. 

The risk turns out to be that the newest version of the NV video 
transmission software allows you to transmit video across the mbone 
without a camera... any window or cursor-followed region will be happily 
transmitted to the world... It is not obvious in ANY way that you are 
actually transmitting any information...

I called the person listed in the WHOIS database for the address range 
that Susanp was in and the session went away, BUT... what would have 
happened if susanp had started doing something that was more company 
confidential?  Since folks are recording the multicast digitally, all it 
would take is one screen shot with private information..

As many of you know, the National Research Council is undertaking a study of
national cryptography policy (description available on request to
<A HREF="mailto:CRYPTO@NAS.EDU">CRYPTO@NAS.EDU</A>).  This note is the first of a number of questions that will
be posted to the Internet community in our attempt to solicit input on a
broad scale.  Please circulate this request to anyone that you think might
be able to contribute.

The question of this posting is the following:

How, if at all, do capabilities enabled by new and emerging technology in
telecommunications (e.g., key-escrow encryption technologies, digital
telephony) and electronic networking make it _easier_ for those who control
that technology to compromise and/or protect the interests of individual end
users?  Please use as the standard of comparison the ease _today_ of
compromising or protecting these interests.  We are interested in scenarios
in which these interests might be compromised or protected both individually
and on a large scale.  Please be sure to tell us the interests you believe
are at stake.

Please send your comments on this question to <A HREF="mailto:CRYPTO@NAS.EDU">CRYPTO@NAS.EDU</A>.

You may amused/horrified to hear of an incident that occurred at a
major city bank last week here in the UK.

On hearing of the Pentium bug, they decided to test all of their machines to
see which had the problem. They compiled up a test program and checked all
of their Pentium based machines and discovered that all of them had the fdiv
bug. They decided to be extra cautious and run the same program on all the
other machines. To their horror all of the 486 machines exhibited the same
problem.

After several days of headless chicken impersonations, a more-level head
decided that something must be awry and called in a good friend of mine who
in short order discovered their mistake.

The test program was compiled on a Pentium box and had the sum performed
with constants. The compiler had noticed the use of constants and had
performed the sum there and then, putting the result in the executable
to be printed on demand on whichever box it was run on.

The risks involved are obvious but the solution is less so. Even if
the sum is done using variables, what is to stop the compiler from
noticing that the values do not change between initialisation and
the time of performing the calculation, and cause the same problem ?
(Yes, I know. Use functions, pass parameters. But what if it gets
in-lined, and then optimised ?)

Admittedly this only normally occurs on binaries that are shipped for
alternative platforms, but how many software houses use the smaller chips
(386/486) as the main compile engine before shipping ?  And of course, users
who have Pentiums without the bug, but use software compiled by a chip with
it are also susceptible.

The effects and problems of this are going to be with us for a long time.

&gt; Many formal approaches would not have caught this kind of error  ...

I haven't followed all the arguments about random testing, but it's also the
case that random testing is not appropriate for this sort of problem. If you
have something like a lookup table in there, it really does make sense to
make sure that you test *all* the entries in that table: trying to do this
with random numbers is crazy.  As to trusting it because it was generated by
computer: well, I wouldn't trust *anything* that was easy to check if I was
about to make millions of dollars worth of it.

You may have received a few messages recently regarding a supposed computer
virus spread through the mail. Unfortunately, it's nothing new -- in fact,
it was announced in a RISKS submission not too long ago. With the kind help
of the RISKS moderator (no doubt, digging out from under his own avalanche
of reports), I am enclosing it for your consideration.

Subject: Virus attacks RISKS

Today, I'm afraid I must confess that one of my recent postings to RISKS
contained a Virus that Peter (no doubt inadvertently) distributed to the
RISKS audience.  The virus doesn't infect your programs or data files
directly, but in a manner analogous to the "Christmas card" virus discussed
here a few months ago, it causes increased network traffic.

As the virus establishes itself, you will note its affect by the increased
amount of electronic mail you receive every day.  For some of you, the
increase is linear; but for others, I'm afraid you're on the early part of a
exponential curve.

Although the virus was easy to create, I'm afraid that I don't know how to cure
it.  In fact, I believe I'm beginning to note its effects on my own system.

Humbly, Martin Minow

Lerner &lt;<A HREF="mailto:reuven@hpwadck.wal.hp.com">reuven@hpwadck.wal.hp.com</A>&gt; both make good points re the "Good Times"
'virus' where the message about a virus it *itself* a virus!  (With possibly
bad long term effects.)  Computer viruses &amp; human fads (like passing on the
Good Times warning) both fit the model of a meme.  (See _Selfish Gene_ by
Richard Dawkins.)  A meme is one type of *replicating information pattern*,
genes are the other main class.  Putting a class name such as "meme" on Good
Times helps us group things/events into classes where we can expect
analogous effects.

What computers and fast communications have done is to radically change the
replication constants for memes, and to make unworkable the controls society
has tried to put on such things.

&gt; ... the book contains a substantial number of typos ...

This is all too correct.  I should like, however, to add three points:
  (1) The book contains not only many typos, but also a number of serious
errors in its descriptions of some of the algorithms.  (I pointed out
several of these last June; copies of my posting are available from me by
e-mail.)
  (2) While Schneier himself maintains a cumulative errata sheet, the
publisher (Wiley) apparently refuses to include it with copies of the
book which have been distributed since the appearance of the errata sheet.
  (3) The good news is that Schneier is preparing a second edition, which

As one who worked on bill-payment ("remittance processing") systems many
years ago, I find this conclusion [take the phone number off the check, not
the stub] highly implausible, to put it mildly.  A phone, utility, or
credit-card company in a moderately large city must process literally
hundreds of thousands of payments every day (divide the phone population by
30).  The return portion of the bill is carefully encoded with many things,
including both the account number and the amount due.  That way, when the
human operator types in the amount of the check, it is assumed correct if it
matches the amount due, saving a costly verification step.  Since the bill
stub *has* to be OCR'ed, why would anyone build a complex and expensive
system to scan the check for a phone number, printed in an unknown location
in an arbitrary typeface (if it's present at all) instead?

It is far more likely that Russell accidentally sent in the wrong half of
the stub, or no stub at all, and a human somewhere was faced with trying to
credit the proper account with his payment.  Since the phone number was on
the check, the human assumed it represented the proper account -- an
unjustifiable assumption, but an understandable one when you consider that
there are thousands of these errors to deal with every day, so that it's not
practical to make a phone call to verify the assumption, and the customer
would probably get very upset if you mailed the check back without cashing
it.

The RISK here is not a computer risk, but simply that it is always
unfortunate to fall through the cracks of a system that is too big to
give individualized service.

&gt;As one who worked on bill-payment ("remittance processing" systems many
&gt;years ago, I find this conclusion highly implausible, to put it mildly.

So would I! But I am only repeating to you what the woman at the phone
company told me; and my $150 *was* credited to my dad.

Actually, on further reflection, I've come to the conclusion that it
probably *wasn't* an automatic scanner, but a human being. I suppose
that sort of invalidates this as a Technological RISK.

&gt;It is far more likely that Russell accidentally sent in the wrong half
&gt;of the stub, or no stub at all, and a human somewhere was faced with

No, I sent in the correct portion of the bill, as I always do. Believe
me, if you'd had the experiences I've had with the local US West office,
you wouldn't be so skeptical.

Several people have suggested to me, some rather haughtily, that my
corrupted /etc/hosts file would not have come about had I been using an
operating system that supported file locking by default--that is, if only
one process could have a file open for writing at a time.

Looking over the code to see if this was true revealed Cause 4.  It turns
out that the file is built up in several phases:

	1. Generate the entries for `localhost' and `loghost'
	   in a temporary file.

	2. Append the entries for machines I am likely to use often
	   to the temporary file.

	3. Append all the other entries to the temporary file.

Because this is done as a shell script, each phase opens the file,
appends to it, and then closes it.  That means that file locking
would not have avoided the race condition.

One person suggested to me that I should have built /etc/hosts in
a temporary file rather than immediately overwriting the good copy.
In fact, I did just that.  However, since I `knew' that the program
would never run more than once at a time, I used a fixed name for the
temporary file.  Since that name was in my home directory, each process
on each machine used the same file.

Finally, I will note that I know how to make the program safe against
multiple accesses, even without file locking: use a separate temporary file
for each invocation and then, instead of copying the file to its final
place, move it there atomically.  I don't know how to make such things
automatic, though, and it's far from clear that one should always take such
precautions, even for programs one believes will be run only on one's own
behalf.

The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) is pleased to
announce the availability of a new report entitled _Rights and
Responsibilities of Participants in Networked Communities_.  Given
increasing public interest and concern over the behavior of people on
electronic networks, the report seeks to illuminate, to question, and to
articulate difficult issues that arise in this context, and thus to help to
lay a foundation for a more informed public debate and discussion of the
rights and responsibilities of those who operate in this domain.

The report is based on a workshop and a public forum involving
technologists, lawyers, policy analysts, network service providers, and
network operators in the exploration of several hypothetical but plausible
scenarios in four areas (free speech, electronic vandalism, intellectual
property interests, and privacy).  The report illustrates how disagreements
in these areas are rooted in value judgments; for example, the extent to
which continuity with past precedents is desirable.  Lawyers and
policy-makers often argue that rights and responsibilities in a new domain
inherently derive from existing rules, the report says.  By contrast,
technologists with extensive network experience often assert that with a new
medium and a new form of human expression should also come new rules of
social intercourse.  The report notes that these four areas have always been
inherently contentious, but over time certain compromises and understandings
have evolved that guide what people do when communicating via traditional
media such as print, telephone, radio, and television.  Today the
proliferation of networking technology threatens this state of understanding
because it changes the environment in which previous compromises were
achieved, leading to a re-examination of the same fundamental issues.

The report is available from the National Academy Press for $25.00 (prepaid)
plus $4.00 shipping for the first copy and $.50 shipping for each additional
copy; tel. (202) 334-3313 or 1-800-624-6242.  It will also be available soon
on the WorldWide Web at <A HREF="http://www.nas.edu;">http://www.nas.edu;</A> via Gopher at gopher.nas.edu;
and via FTP at ftp.nas.edu.

Well, William Kahan informs me that

(1) Inmos used formal methods for the FP on the T800, but that they
got the specification wrong.

(2) Intel actually had in its possession a test that Kahan had
designed that uncovers the flaw after about 2 minutes of testing.
The test (as I understand it) is sort of "gray box" in that it
makes certain assumptions about the class of algorithm used.

These points notwithstanding, however, Kahan still agrees that there
is no substitute for formal proof in these cases.

The Intel FDIV bug occurs both in single and in double precision
divide.  It is NOT a double precision error.  The best source of
information on this is the web site:
<A HREF="http://www.mathworks.com/Pentium/README.html">http://www.mathworks.com/Pentium/README.html</A>

The Pentium uses a subtractive division algorithm based on a radix-4
Booth SRT algorithm.  Similar algorithms are used for square root and
division in this and several other processors.  (We are in the process
of working on a survey article of division and square root
implementations in recent microprocessors.)

The closest verification work I know of is a proof of
a radix 2 subtractive square root chip I did with some students here
at Cornell.  The paper describing this proof
appeared in the Conference on Theorem Provers in Circuit Design in
September 1994.  We are working on a proof of a radix 2 subtractive
division implementation.  The two proofs are very similar.

The square root paper is available by anonymous ftp from
tesla.ee.cornell.edu:~pub/hw-verify/sqrt-tpcd94.ps.Z

Verification of radix 4 is somewhat more difficult, largely because
the implementation depends on a lookup table to guess the next digit.
I have heard rumors that the error is in the translation of a table
used for digit selection, but no substantiation that this is the case.
It is highly likely that the error is related to using the output of
the carry-save adder. Since we have not done a proof of a radix 4
algorithm, we do not consider the lookup table in our proof.

Our proof shows that the basic algorithm does in fact perform a square
root, and then relates this to the register-transfer level
implementation of the hardware. We do not prove the correctness of the
implementation of each of the blocks of hardware (adders, shifters, etc.)
As several people have pointed out, errors occur at several different
levels.  Formal verification is very useful at high levels, but will
not preclude the need for lower level testing or simulation.

[John Rushby was incorrect when he said that the AAMP5 did not have

microprocessor.  I am giving below a summary of the work reported in the
paper.  For those interested in finding out more details about the project,

*************************************************
Formal Verification of AAMP5 Microprocessor:
A Case Study in the Industrial Use of Formal Methods

Steve Miller 				Manadayam Srivas
Collins Commercial Avionics		Computer Science Laboratory
Rockwell International			SRI International
Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52498		Menlo Park, CA 94025

The AAMP5 verification was a project conducted to explore how formal
techniques for specification and verification could be introduced into an
industrial process. Sponsored by the Systems Validation Branch of NASA
Langley and Collins Commercial Avionics, a division of Rockwell
International, it was conducted by Collins and the Computer Science Research
Lab at SRI International. The project consisted of specifying in the PVS
language developed by SRI a portion of a Rockwell proprietary
microprocessor, the AAMP5, at both the instruction set and register-transfer
levels and using the PVS theorem prover to show the microcode correctly
implemented the specified behavior for a representative subset of
instructions. The formal verification was performed in parallel with the
development of the AAMP5 and did not replace any production verification
activities.

The central result of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of
formally specifying a commercial microprocessor and the use of mechanical
proofs of correctness to verify microcode. This is particularly significant
since the AAMP5 was not designed for formal verification, but to provide a
more than three-fold performance improvement while remaining object code
compatible with the earlier AAMP2. As a consequence, the AAMP5 is one of the
most complex microprocessors to which formal methods have been applied.  The
AAMP architecture is specifically designed for use with block-structured,
high level languages like Ada in real-time embedded applications.  It is
based on a stack architecture and provides hardware support for many
features normally provided by the compiler run-time environment, such as
procedure state saving, parameter passage, return linkage, and reentrancy.
AAMP5 supports floating point calculations implemented via microcode.

Besides demonstrating the verification of a subset of AAMP5 microcode, an
equally important accomplishment of the project was the development of an
effective methodology that can be used by practicing engineers to apply
formal verification technology to a complex microprocessor design.  This
includes techniques for decomposing the complex microprocessor verification
problem into a set of verification conditions that the engineers can
formulate, and proof strategies to automate the proof of the verification
conditions.

This methodology was used to formally verify a core set of eleven AAMP5
instructions representative of several instruction classes.  The core set
did not include floating point instructions.  Although the number of
instructions verified is small, the methodology and the formal machinery
developed are adequate to cover most of the remaining AAMP5 microcode.  The
success of this project has lead to a sequel in which the same methodology
is being reused to verify another member of the AAMP family of processors.

Another key result was the discovery of both actual and seeded errors. Two
actual microcode errors were discovered during development of the formal
specification, illustrating the value of simply creating a precise
specification. Both errors were specific to the AAMP5 and corrected prior to
first fabrication. Two additional errors seeded by Collins in the microcode
were systematically uncovered by SRI while doing correctness proofs. One of
these was an actual error that had been discovered by Collins during testing
of an early prototype but left in the microcode provided to SRI. The other
error was designed to be unlikely to be detected by walkthroughs, testing,
or simulation.

&gt; The risk turns out to be that the newest version of the NV video
&gt; transmission software allows you to transmit video across the mbone
&gt; without a camera... any window or cursor-followed region will be happily
&gt; transmitted to the world... It is not obvious in ANY way that you are
&gt; actually transmitting any information...

This is not true.  Having played with the latest version of nv last night,
trying to get Multicast to work with Linux 1.1.72, I can attest to the fact
that nv does provide you with a clue that it is transmitting.

First, the button on the bottom of the nv window will change between "click
to start sending" and "click to stop sending", depending on the current
state.  Second, when you are transmitting, you should see your transmission
in the nv session window, which displays all the video feeds currently in
progress.

Also, it is possible to configure everything such that nv will be started
with the -recvOnly flag, in which case it wont even let you send video (our
version of sd does this automatically).

I don't think this is necessarily a program error or a program bug, although
it is clearly an interface issue and possibly a clueless user not knowing
what all these neat buttons do!

Sounds a lot like some things I was discussing with some friends. Consider
the following (going to use PGP for an example). A store sends out a
catalogue via E-Mail at the start of the catalogue is the store's PGP public
key (package obtained from ViaCrypt (plug) so legal for commercial use).

The subscriber has a program that on choosing a selection from a menu is
able to use the header to encrypt the selections, credit card number, and
shipping instructions with the store's public key and sign it with the
shopper's private key (Addison Fisher was discussing this sort of thing
quite a few years ago, just now technology has (almost) caught up).

The completed order is then sent to the store. Note that since the shopper
just signed the message, it does not need the shopper's public key to
extract the order, just to authenticate it if repudiated later, but the
store's private key is needed to read it.

Concerned that the header key is someone else's and the whole thing is a
scam ? Call this 800 number and press 9 to get a voice mail certificate
number (eight hex digits and built into PGP now). And the "Home Shopping
MIME" will flash it every thirty seconds on the bottom of the screen. Spice
will know the most popular by heart anyway.

Of course this leads to the question of revoking a key that is compromised -
obviously with the age-old tradition of a classified ad: "I will no longer
be responsible for any debts incurred by..." - not so much a revocation as a
divorce.

Recently, <A HREF="mailto:pjd@cne.gmu.edu">pjd@cne.gmu.edu</A> wrote about Cellular One turning off roaming in
NYC.

A friend of mine, after reading the article had this response:

Funny thing is the fact that the same people that are scanning the ESN
are also getting that Credit Card number when you make the call.  :)

Hummm... guess that does not burn the cellular company...  Caller Beware.

I'm also not sure where the real virus is.  I have now received more copies
of the "it's a hoax" message from well-meaning friends (and my own spouse)
than the original "warning."

We should also be careful about shouting too loudly that "There's no such
thing as an e-mail virus!"  As RISKS readers know, there are several
perfectly workable ways of wreaking mayhem via e-mail, and "active" e-mail
is such a seductively attractive concept that sooner or later some
misguideded person will actually implement it (with inadequate safeguards),
and then the fun will really begin.  (Nat Borenstein has written a few
papers about the idea of active e-mail, although his papers of course DO
mention the glaring risks, and propose methods of implementing active e-mail
reasonably safely, if anyone dared to.)

After reading in RISKS about the supposed AOL virus, I logged on to my
account to see if I had any mail.  I didn't and I was pleased to find a
button on my opening screen for e-mail information.  I pushed it and found a
very coherent explanation from the management of what can and cannot be done
with e-mail and what to do if someone sends you a questionable file
attachment.  Now I just hope people bother to push the button and read the
message.  With luck, the AOL "Inoculation" has worked.

A RISK uncovered here is the weakness of the underlying Data Model utilized
by the phone company in question.  Phone companies, in general, seem to have
insisted on a business rule that requires that the telephone number itself
also be the customers account number.

If one were to make an entity-relationship model of this enterprise there
would be several entity-types that utilize the same identifier.
CUSTOMER-ACCOUNT, CUSTOMER, SERVICE-ACCESS, FRAME-ASSIGNMENT, are each
expected to be uniquely identifiable by the telephone number.
Overwhelmingly this is the case, but there are enough exceptions - multiple
lines for one customer, people moving, etc. that it weakens the data model
(or increases its complexity unnecessarily) that the business processes
begin to suffer.  What ought to be merely a change to a relationship between
two entities, or perhaps a value change to an attribute, results in a change
to the existence of the entity itself.

I imagine, in the eyes of the Data Model, that when Russell Stewart moved -
one CUSTOMER entity was deleted (or marked inactive) and another instance
was created.  No wonder they couldn't allocate the money properly!  Each
customer service rep probably has developed their own individual set of
business rules to apply in the case of finding an appropriate instance of a
CUSTOMER entity when the original one no longer exists.

In <A HREF="/Risks/16.63.html">RISKS-16.63</A>, Justin Wells confuses two different methods of paying
for goods and services over the Internet.

First, he talks about submitting credit card information via the FORMS
interface supported by most recent Web browsers.  Assuming both the
client and server support some secure encryption mechanism, it is safe
to transmit your credit card information over the Internet.  The
NetMarket Company, for which I work, is the first company to do secure
encrypted commercial transactions via the Web, though several other
companies are also providing this functionality now.

Note that this is distinct from "digital cash".  The scheme described
above is simply a mechanism for transmitting your credit card
information and is in fact not very different from simply calling a
mail-order house on the phone and using your credit card.

Okamoto and Ohta ["Universal Electronic Cash", Crypto '91] propose six
properties for an "ideal" digital cash system.  Of these properties,
credit card transactions are neither private (anonymous or
untraceable), transferrable (a merchant can't pay somebody else with
your "credit" without a bank doing arbitrage), nor divisible (you
can't "make change" with credit).

Note that there are several competing digital cash standards under
development at this very moment.  Not all of these standards implement
all of the features that Okamoto and Ohta outline in their paper.  I
fervently hope that we will end up with an "ideal" digital cash
standard, but I am not hopeful.

German media's awareness about Telecom related crimes was raised
significantly when International Herald Tribune reported on its front page
earlier this week that "several thousands of German Telecom employees" are
suspected to have participated in criminal activities which damaged German
Telecom in the order of 500 million DM. According to this report, telephone
lines were switched to service providers in areas such as Netherlands
Antillas where services such as astrologic reports (horoscopes) and taped
sex conversations are regularly offered at high prices (up to 12 DM/minute);
such services are usually announced in German boulevard newspapers on
specific pages.

Income from such telephone calls is usually divided between German Telecom
which bills it's resp. international tariff, and the related PTT (e.g.
NL-Antillas PTT) which subtracts its tariff from the amount sent and
distributes the rest to the service provider. This trade between the PTTs is
calculated by counting the *total volume of connect time* between related
Telecoms. This implies that Telecom pays more to another PTT than it can
charge to individual customers if some pirates succeed to generate
communication between PTTs even when a real connection was NOT established,
or with other criminal tricks. In cases reported by Herald Tribune, Telecom
employees and service providers worked together to generate a significant
volume of communication. Such procedures are a modern version of earning
real money with "virtual communication" :-)

As German media (with few exemptions) are not well informed about details of
Telecom procedures and systems, much noise was generated, where some
"experts" (e.g. a misinformed member of the Chaos Computer Club :-) said
that hackers may have hacked Telecom computers (which is nonsense, both in
the sense of telephone hacking=phreaking and computer hacking). While
Telecom admitted that investigations were underway (one day later, 2 Telecom
employees and 1 service provider were jailed, being accused with having
damaged German Telecom in the order of 2 million DM), spokesmen immediately
rejected that damage be in the order of 500 million DM. More cases are
evidently underway (both in jailing and reporting :-).

Since some time, public is growingly concerned about Telecom bills as
steadily growing numbers of Telecom customers complain about unexpectedly
high telephone bills. With estimated 600,000 customers (of 35 mio private
customers) complaining this year, and a roughly estimated mean damage of
1,000 DM (as many customers report too high figures over months, with single
bills adding to over 200,000 DM!), the *overall damage for private
customers* may sum up to about 600 million DM! Despite of some recent
damages to enterprise switching systems, discussion concerning potential
economic damage has not reached the media so far.

Unfortunately, German telecom customers so far cannot control their bills
amount and so argue whether they really connected to such service providers.
Different from other technically advanced countries, German customers
receive monthly bills with *sums of telephone units and the total price
which they have to pay*. This is a relic from ancient technologies when
units were counted in electromechanical counters whose actual figures were
photographed for documentation purposes; the photos of a new and the last
month were compared to calculate the difference as the basis of the new
bill. Since some time, digital switching systems (esp. Siemens' EWSD and
Alcatel' S12) are installed in most regional switching offices
(Vermittlungsstellen), where a log-record is stored for each call containing
all essential billing data. While German Telecom only recently offered to
list details of each telephone call if customers apply for this service and
pay a monthly price in the order of 10 DM), a federal parliament's
commission (Petitionsausschuss) recently suggested to the ministry of
Telecommunications that detailed bills should be given and that such service
should be free of a fee (as e.g. in US and Canada).

Presently, a growing number of customers are seeking legal help against such
Telecom bills. In few cases, courts (assisted by technical expertises about
potential faults and points-of-attacks) have sentenced the bills as
irregular.  As in many cases of digital technologies, complexity of Telecom
networks has grown so rapidly that new risks have appeared, e.g. in software
and management of complex switching systems. In several cases, software bugs
were not detected in Telecom's very detailed test process; in one case,
billing records were store doubly, which was only detected "in the field".
Management of such systems has never been analysed for any reasonable
"quality" (even an ISO 9000-based analysis which is not very adequate would
lead to improvements).

In cases of growingly complex systems with growing bugs and management
faults, more customer protection is needed. As customers are rarely able to
relate overly high bills to technical problems of any kind, it should belong
to the professional duties of related experts and their organisations
(international as IFIP; national as ACM, BCS, GI/Germany, IEEE) to provide
expertise for the public in cases such as Telecom criminality (from which
side whatsoever). This may also help to produce better insight of public
media about technologies.

&gt;From the Dec 11 edition of the Ottawa Citizen:

MONTREAL - Myopic weather observation machines installed at Edmonton and
Dorval airports to replace human observers as a cost-cutting measure can't
tell rain from snow and are being withdrawn from service.  Marc Gelinas, a
weather specialist at Environment Canada's St. Laurent office, said the
machines also cannot tell when there are clouds above 10,000 feet.  "At 6:15
PM Friday, it was completely overcast and snowing at Dorval but the
automatic weather system issued a report saying there were only scattered
clouds at 4,000 feet," Gelinas said.  The system at Dorval airport has been
providing pilots with inaccurate weather reports since it was installed Nov.
15.  Humans will remain on the job at the two airports until the machine can
produce accurate weather reports.  But the equipment will remain in place at
another 48 smaller airports across the country.

Those who build computational hardware or software have a responsibility to
ensure that their artifacts produce correct results, because these artifacts
are used in many applications, some of which are extremely critical to life
or property.  I can't imagine any valid excuse for shipping a CPU which
deterministically gives incorrect results due to a bad algorithm or logical
fault in its implementation.  Computer arithmetic algorithms and math
libraries are simple enough to permit complete verification by a combination
of formal methods and exhaustive testing.

Here's a story that illustrates the lengths to which it is possible to go.
In the late 60's I worked in the PDP-10 group at DEC.  Digital had lost a
benchmark to its then arch-rival, Scientific Data Systems.  It seemed that
the PDP-10 square root routine was too slow.  I rewrote the routine and
speeded it up by 25%, putting the new result on the master disk for
subsequent distribution.  Part of my speed up included removing unnecessary
rounding in the early steps of Newton's method.  Being concerned that the
resulting code might produce different results from its predecessor, I
tested the mantissa processing code exhaustively, verifying in each case
that the resulting value was less than one LSB off of the exact answer.  I
also tested all possible values of the exponent and sign fields.  A very
little formal work showed that the combined routine was correct.  (I would
have felt even better if I had had the several months of computer time to
test all 2^36 cases directly.)

I was prepared to swear that my new routine always gave the same answer as
the old.  As it turned out, this was NOT true.  In exactly one case my new
routine did a better job of rounding the square root to single precision.  I
found this out several years later when Mary Payne called my square root
routine "brilliant".  My rejoinder was that it was merely "lucky".  It seems
that Mary had been working to a stricter criteria than mine and wanted the
rounding to always give the closest possible value.

For a long time, Mary Payne was responsible for Computational Quality at
Digital.  She consulted in the design of processors or math libraries, or
anything else which was likely to result in bad numbers coming out of
Digital's computers.  It seems most unlikely that the Pentium bug would have
gotten past her.

As a postmaster at a large site, I have to say I have a real problem with
mailing lists which have this "must actively resubscribe" feature.

The feature assumes that all recipients of the list are live humans, who can
interpret the resubscribe message and reply.  That assumption is not always
true.  At our site, we encourage users to *not* subscribe to lists directly,
instead we prefer to gateway mailing lists into our bulletin board system.
This approach saves disk space, mail delivery time, and most importantly
administrator time dealing with expired or abandoned accounts.

When some list sends out a resubscription request, at least one reader of
the associated bboard has to forward it to an administrator, who has to
manually respond.  This is a waste of expensive staff time.  Many times, the
subscription just expires and any user who later becomes interested in the
list sees what incorrectly appears to be an inactive list.

On a different topic: after spending some time composing a reply to the
list-looping query in <A HREF="/Risks/16.59.html">RISKS-16.59</A>, including technical information as to
what the standards state various mail agents should do in various
situations.  In 16.60, I read a reply by Peter da Silva which gave
information on the topic that was in fact *completely incorrect*.  Later I
was horrified to find my name included in an editorial comment as having
given a "similar response" on the topic.

I suppose this is a RISK of RISKS; by contributing to an edited forum I
ended up having my name attached to a position I completely disagree with.
I hope the editor will post this retraction: it is my professional position
that error (and other) notifications be sent to the envelope return path as
the standards specify, that sending them to Errors-to: violates the
standards and should not be done.

   [Yes, indeed.  Sorry for the guilt by association.  I try wherever
   possible to prune items with similar messages.  Here I elided a
   little too smoothly.  Thanks.  PGN]

And here is a good example of not RTFM'ing before sending an alarm:

&gt;With all this talk about self extracting mail "viruses", a friend showed me
&gt;that in emacs (which I use to read mail, along with vm) has the ability to
&gt;self-extract elisp code.  This feature seems to be turned on by default, and
&gt;it not only applies to mail read with emacs, but rather every file visited
&gt;(when the feature is on, of course).

There are actually two mechanisms at work here.  First, emacs supports a
per-file variable initialization mechanism.  Whenever a file is loaded,
emacs scans the end of the file for a special section of "comments" which
provide emacs with values to set in certain buffer variables.  Enabled by
default, this mechanism only allows literal values and so does not
constitute any significant risk.

In Emacs 19, lisp forms may be included as the value for certain variables,
and a special 'eval' construct is allowed which simply evaluates its form.
By default, emacs shows you the code and asks if it should be evaluated.

The risk is that emacs is a very complicated product and generally requires
a fair amount of configuration and customization to be usable by a power
user.  When a less experienced user sees the "cool stuff" that the power
user does, he simple copies the power user's emacs configuration file.
Unfortunately, the inexperienced user cannot read the file and so picks up
many unwanted changes.  If the power user made use of the 'eval' feature, he
would probably disable the execution query; the inexperienced user would
then be unwittingly susceptible to trojan attacks.

Being the primary emacs disciple at my site, I am usually the one
responsible for propagating annoying functionality to coworkers.  To
avoid this problem, I have separated the benign functionality of my
configuration to a centrally available file for other users to
execute.  Dangerous or annoying customizations are stored in my local
configuration file which other users no longer need to copy.

I just received something that I guess was sent directly to the RISKS
digest LISTSERV remailing address, thus bypassing the normal moderation
process of mail sent to <A HREF="mailto:risks@csl.sri.com">risks@csl.sri.com</A>. If I'm correct, those of you not
receiving RISKS via the LISTSERV distribution did not see it.

It was an ad for some computer hardware. Some people have been sending
commercial e-mail messages to lists of mailing list addresses, ignoring the
lack of relevance of their ad to the lists' topics. That is called
"spamming" and is considered by many on the Internet to be antisocial
behavior.

This particular message apparently was sent from e-mail address LIONEL
GOLDBERG &lt;<A HREF="mailto:actuary@ix.netcom.com">actuary@ix.netcom.com</A>&gt; (But read RISK #3 below!). I contacted
netcom and was told that they have an explicit policy against spamming from
their customers' accounts.

RISK #1: The LISTSERV system used by RISKS for automating list distribution
on BITNET allows this kind of bypassing of the moderator.

RISK #2: If <A HREF="mailto:actuary@ix.netcom.com">actuary@ix.netcom.com</A> really sent this message to RISKS and a
bunch of other mailing lists indiscriminately, complaints to
<A HREF="mailto:sysadmin@netcom.com">sysadmin@netcom.com</A> can lose him his account.

RISK #3: E-mail can easily be forged. The LISTSERV software conveniently
removed all traces of the actual path that the message took before it
arrived at the list server and was redistributed, so I could not tell if
the message was even a crude forgery sent from someone other than the
account in the "From" header. So please don't jump the gun in accusing
<A HREF="mailto:actuary@ix.netcom.com">actuary@ix.netcom.com</A>.

RISK #4: The ad asks for people to send checks or money orders, no COD or
credit cards, to some unknown company for unseen equipment. Anyone want to
buy a bridge?

RISK #4.9999721: Some of the items listed are Pentiums :-)

   [Comments from too many of you to name on this, including
      some who got multiple copies, and some of whom got copies
      from lists to which they are not even subscribed.
      netcom has disabled the account.  RISKS was not the only
      list hit.

   As you all know, the BITNET LISTSERV is wide open to the world.
   I have no control over what goes gets redistributed, although
   perhaps one of its wizards will change that soon?  Perhaps
   it should have been set up that ONLY RISKS can cause E-mail to
   be distributed to the list, but that is not the way it works.
   Occasionally some overly moronic individual spams our BITNET
   readers.  Perhaps the automated server that we are trying to set
   up might induce some of you to switch over, although my system
   does not really need the added burden...  Stay tuned.  PGN]

The latest Internet hoax has Microsoft acquiring the Roman Catholic Church,
including exclusive electronic rights to the Bible. The story, written
under an Associated Press byline, says the agreement provides for Pope John
Paul II becoming the senior vice president of the company's new Religious
Software Division, and two Microsoft senior vice presidents being invested
in the College of Cardinals. The fake story included a promise from Bill
Gates to "make the sacraments available online for the first time."
Officials at Microsoft and AP said they didn't know where the story
originated. (Tampa Tribune 12/17/94 B&amp;F10)

In the 19 December 1994 edition of *Newsweek*, read the `My Turn' column
entitled ``A Case of Mistaken Identity: On the Information Highway, you are
guilty until proven innocent'' by Michael W. Klein.  Mr Klein, an attorney
in New Jersey, was was falsely identified as a reckless driver because a
police clerk made a mistake on an address search.  Law enforcement personnel
were prepared to lock him up even though the physical descriptions did not
match, even though the demographics did not match, just because the warrant
had come out of the computer.

I heard a short note on the local all news radio station recently about a
planned upgrade to the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS). This upgraded
service would allow the EBS to reach radio and TVs that were not actually
turned on when the broadcast was sent. The intent is to inform even those
misfortunates who were not actively listending or watching at the time of an
emergency. I assume such an upgrade would require changes to radios and TVs
to allow them to be turned out remotely via some sequence of commands
carried over the airwaves?  One potential risk of this configuration is that
one could remotely activate speakers or video devices that may be part of
the television or radio, and use this mechanism to listen in without anyone
knowing.

The Sports Monday of the NYT (12/19/94) ran a headline calling one
basketball team the "Pentium" of basketball teams. It wasn't because
they were playing 2-3 times  faster than last year's team. 

This illustrates the RISKS of imprecise technical language. There was no
real meaning to the word "Pentium" before. The Intel, AMD and other clones
were all supposed to be interchangeable. The brand name was just a marketing
ploy that was even more hollow than the work of the folks at P&amp;G, Coke or
Pepsi. After all, there _is_ a difference between colas. So, if there is no
meaning to the word, it shouldn't be surprising that the first hint of a
meaning, no matter how irrational, rushes in to fill the vacuum.

To add to Steve Barr's comments about AOL and how anyone can have any name
on that system:

My real name is Ted Koppel.  There happens to be another fellow, a
broadcaster, who has the same name as I do.  I took my "ten free hours" on
AOL, and explored the system.  Not surprisingly, I used my name (actually
Tkoppel, which is a reasonable login variation).

One of the places to visit on AOL is an area 'owned' by ABC News.  I was in
there, reading some of their stuff, and talking in one of the forums there,
when I was told, in no unambiguous terms, to either get off the forum or
change my name.  Since my name is, after all, on my driver's license, I
figured that I had a pretty good right to use it :-) So I told the fellow
that.

It turns out that he is/was some sort of a staff person working for the ABC
Ted Koppel, and he was concerned that people would mistake ME for his Ted
Koppel (a legitimate risk, I suppose).  On the other hand, I'm not convinced
that threatening me rudely was the appropriate way to go about it.

By the way, I subsequently dropped AOL, partially for this reason, but
primarily because there was no 'killer app' that made me want to stay.

Mac 840AV machines (and presumably other AV machines) have a voice
recognition feature.  When we got ours, shortly after they had been
released, and before anyone started doing useful work, we used to have great
fun popping into someone's office and stating:

  "Computer, Restart, Yes."

whereupon the Mac would dutifully reboot. ("Shutdown" was another option...).

This article is biased and oversimplified view of a complex set of
requirements.  I wonder whether the weather specialist quoted in the article
has an axe to grind against automated weather reporting systems.

The fact that the weather station report did not match current conditions is
not unusual, regardless of who or what is making the report.  Most airport
weather reports are made once per hour, so if the weather is changing
rapidly (for example, a storm front is moving in), actual conditions may be
quite different from what is reported in the last hourly observation.  This
is not the fault of the automated observation system.  Pilots must take into
account when the observation was made, and how likely it is that conditions
may have changed.

The article also stated, "the machines also cannot tell when there are
clouds above 10,000 feet," implying a crippling limitation.  In reality,
clouds more than 5,000 or 6,000 feet above the ground are not particularly
relevant to airport operations (i.e. takeoffs and landings), so less effort
is expended to gather data on high clouds.

Public radio's "Marketplace" show is carrying a story this morning
announcing that Intel will now replace, on request, any and all Pentium
processors.  This is a revision of their earlier policy, which required that
Pentium owners justify the replacement to Intel staffers.  I suspect that
they could no longer afford the bad publicity or the manpower cost
associated with the phone banks used to screen replacement requests.

With all the discussion of verification, formal or otherwise, it seems to
me that another explanation is being overlooked. Given the immense amount
of data associated with a given chip design, it could be that the hardware
implementation of the Pentium divide unit and the software representation
which was verified (by whatever techniques Intel uses) were not the same.

Before a chip is fabricated, it exists as a huge software database, often
including several mutually incompatible representations, with a large number
of people using and changing it. Version control is a serious problem. If
a design change was made after verification, or if verification was
inadvertently performed on an earlier design, it is easy to see how a
bug could slip in, even with formal verification.

If something like this did in fact happen, then the Pentium bug is an
example of a much more mundane data management RISK than it has been made
out to be, both in this forum and elsewhere.

I need a new, faster computer so I went to some computer stores to look at
the Pentium 90's. Knowing of the fpu bug, I took my trusty formula snared off
the net to test them. 

&gt;put in 5505001/294911. The correct answer is 18.66665197297. The Pentium
&gt;produced 18.666092939000.

I carried out this test on two Pentium machines in the store using windows
calculator. they both produced the wrong answer. A 486/66 of the same brand
produced the correct answer.

 When I asked the sales people about the bug,
they said that the also had a test routine so we tried it. The instructions
were to perform the use qbasic and run the following program:
PRINT (4195835 * 256)/(3145727 / 256)

Their instructions say that the correct answer is  87413.2569545927.

Both Pentiums produced the correct answer - however - they also produced the
correct answer to 5505001/294911. I suspect that since qbasic has to run on
oldx86 machines that lack fpu's, all floating point is probably done with a
software emulator. Using this test, the store will never identify a single
chip as defective creating a false sense of security with the customers and
avoiding the difficulty of getting chips that are actually defective
replaced.

Tony Lauck commented on Mary Payne's work on assuring that DEC's computational
routines always gave good results.  I also worked with Mary at DEC, and was
VERY impressed with her commitments to mathematical accuracy.  Her motto at
the time was that the computations should be "Good to the last bit!"

I have to agree that between Mary's work on algorithmic analysis and DEC's
VERY extensive testing of instruction sets on each new processor model, it
would have been very unlikely for a bug of the severity of the Pentium FDIV
problem to have gotten out on a VAX or an Alpha processor.

Might point out that there is nothing new in the FDIV problem, 80x86
chips are notorious for "different" microcode - for a semi-complete
list see the "86BUGS.LST" file in Ralf Brown's interrupt list.

For just one example, the operation of the instruction AAA ("ASCII Adjust
for Addition" hex code 37) is noticeably different when executed on an
8088 as opposed to an 80386 - with initial value of AX=FFFF on an 8088
the result will be 0005h while on a 386, 0105h will result.

As a consequence any financial programs using BCD addition and requiring 
the AAA instruction may have different values on different systems.

Padgett

PS.  Of course, I do not know of any program using either BCD or AAA and
   AX=FFFFh should never result from BCD addition, but what does that 
   matter (AAM 37 now... 8*) ?

I have recently completed a study on the types of errors that people make
when they uses spreadsheet programs.  I am currently writing up the results.
If you know of previous research that looked at spreadsheet errors other
than the Michigan work of Olson and others or the Brown and Gould study at
IBM, I would be grateful for citations or other information.

Basically, we found that student spreadsheeters have about the same 
error rates as professional programmers.  About five and a half percent 
of their cells have errors before debugging.  The problem is that they 
did not spontaneously debug, a lack seen in the Brown and Gould lab 
study and also in two ethnographic studies of real world 
spreadsheeters.

Given these error rates and apparent lack of deep debugging, the question is
not what fraction of spreadsheets have errors but rather how many errors the
typical large spreadsheet has.

This is a HELP message.  Can anyone out there direct me to any info/archive
which will tell me the current state of disclaimers.  I am writing some
programs for medical use, and have come across the problem of how to phrase
the disclaimer so that it stands up in court. The problem seems to be, at
least in the UK, that one cannot say "..we disclaim all liability.."  since
apparently one has to put a sensible and realistic liability limit in the
disclaimer.  Perhaps some folk can help me here.

			     CALL FOR PAPERS
			NEW SECURITY PARADIGMS '95

        A Workshop Sponsored by ACM SIGSAC, DoD, and the Aerospace Institute

				Residence Inn
		    University of California at San Diego
				La Jolla, CA
			     August 22-25, 1995

Paradigm shifts disrupt the status quo, destroy outdated ideas, and open the
way to new possibilities.  This workshop explores radical new models for
computer security, trusted system integration, and intercomputer networking
security.  The goal is to develop transcendent solutions that provide the
flexibility and interoperability users require in trusted systems.

We offer a creative and constructive workshop environment for about 25
participants at a small campus inn in scenic La Jolla adjacent to San Diego.
Dress is casual. The tone is exploratory rather than critical.  The refereed
papers will be printed in a workshop proceedings.

To participate, submit preferably via email a research paper or a 5-10 page
position paper to Program Chairs John Dobson and Catherine Meadows at the
email addresses listed below by April 1, 1995.  Alternatively, submit five
copies of a hard-copy paper to either program chair by March 24, 1995.  The
Program Committee will referee the papers and notify authors of acceptance
status by June 9, 1995.

Cost of the workshop, lodging, and meals will be about $550.  Scholarships
are available.

European Network of Clubs for Reliability and Safety of Software 
Centre for Software Reliability

        SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF SOFTWARE BASED SYSTEMS
              Reims, France, 12-15 September 1995

                 ANNOUNCEMENT &amp; CALL FOR PAPERS
                    12th Annual CSR Workshop
                 1st Annual ENCRESS Conference
      Supported by the EC ESSI Programme and Lloyd's Register

In the past decade, there have been enormous advances in the use of
computers - and hence software - in areas where safety and reliability are
of significance both to individual users and to society at large. Examples
can be found in all sectors of industry: railway signalling is increasingly
computerised; fly- by-wire aircraft are the current technological trend in
civil aviation; motor car engines and braking systems are computer-
controlled; programmable logic controllers (PLCs) used in the process
industries have increasingly complex software embedded within them; and
commercial companies of all sizes become ever more dependent on the reliable
operation of their computer systems.

These systems do not always deliver the levels of safety and reliability
which users and society are entitled to expect.  There are many reported
examples of software-related failures which have caused, or had the
potential to cause, death, injury, environmental damage, or significant
economic loss. These include deaths in hospitals of patients undergoing
radiotherapy treatment, software-defect induced release of sufficient water
from a reservoir to flood a valley, lost space-craft, and company failures.

Very often, these incidents could have been prevented, or their consequences
reduced, by better awareness of safety and reliability issues as they apply
to computer-based systems.  Ideally, developers of systems should have
evidence that their approach to system development is likely to lead to the
required levels of safety and reliability. Often, evidence of this sort will
form part of a safety case, or other justification for system reliability
and/or safety, that has to be presented for approval or acceptance by an
appropriate authority.

Many projects in the ESSI programme aim to produce evidence to support the
use of particular technologies, in the development of safe and reliable
systems. These projects are particularly encouraged to submit papers to this
conference, which has been selected as one of the events at which ESSI
Application Experiments can present their results for peer review and
evaluation.

This is an open call for papers: we also seek other papers which argue for
the suitability of particular technologies, methods or management approaches
for use in developing reliable and safe systems, especially those which
present the results of industrial experience.

Topics that could be addressed include:

   A historical perspective on safety cases, and on how the current
   regulations requiring the production of safety cases have arisen.

   How do software engineering methods and tools contribute to
   product safety, reliability, etc.?

   What evidence is there to support the use of particular
   technologies to achieve reliable systems?

   How do organisations deal with the safety and reliability of
   PES? Do different industrial sectors deal with PES safety and
   reliability in a similar manner?

   Should we focus on management procedures more and technology
   issues less? (Some accident reports suggest this is so.)

   Are tightly coupled time critical systems inherently less
   safe or reliable than other systems?

   How do software metrics, software reliability models, etc.,
   relate to dependability attributes?

   How do we deal with the integrity of evidence used in safety arguments?

   What is the impact of organisational rules and work practices
   on safety and reliability?

[from Federal Computer Week, 21 Nov 1994]

The Social Security Administration has uncovered a software coding error
that over the years nickeled and dimed Social Security recipients out of
$478.5 million.  The problem occurred in 1978, when SSA wrote new code
because employers began reporting earnings annually rather than quarterly.
The software program, with its 76 sets of variables, had a few holes in it.
Over 16 years, about 426,000 people did not receive appropriate payment
increases.

CANCELBOT DERAILS ONLINE PROMO
Messages promoting "Netchat," a new book by Michael Wolff, have been
unceremoniously wiped out by someone calling him/herself "Cancelmoose." The
vigilante, who used a program called a cancelbot, worked through a computer
in Finland that enables a mail sender to remain anonymous, and claims to
have performed similar services more than a dozen times in the past.

According to an article (page F2) in the Tuesday December 20, 1994 issue of
the Austin American Statesman (from the Associated Press) Ben &amp; Jerry's
Homemade Inc. is going to report its first quarterly loss since it went
public.  Quoting some of the relevant to risks part of the article:

        Adding to the bad news, the company said Monday that recurring
        problems in a comuterized handling system will force it to
        delay opening a new, more efficient manufacturing plant in
        St. Albans, Vt. until the middle of next year.  [...]

        "While out earnings have been negatively impacted in 1994 by
        the inefficiencies in the company's production planning,
        purchasing and inventory management systems ... the
        anticipated loss in the current quarter is due primarily to
        lower than expected sales lever," [Ben &amp; Jerry's President
        Chuck] Lacy said in a written statement.  [...]

        At the new St. Alban's plant, a computerized system that was
        supposed to automate handling of ice cream after it has been
        packed into pints has software problems, forcing the company
        to substitute a more conventional system.
	That likely will require installation of different equipment
        and more employees for handling, although the company said it
        will still be more efficient than current manufacturing.

	The St. Albans plant is designed to consolidate all of Ben &amp;
        Jerry's manufacturing in Vermont again.  The company hires
        Edy's [a major competitor] of Fort Wayne, Ind. to make about
        37 percent of its ice cream, [Ben &amp; Jerry's spokesman Rob]
        Michalak said.

The avionics thread seems to have gone quiet, perhaps because none of the 
several recent airliner crashes has involved an A320 aircraft. Here is an 
account of an incident I came across recently which highlights the problem 
of proliferation of warning signals in complex human-machine interfaces.

The incident involved a Continental Airlines 727 which came perilously 
close to landing gear-up at Chicago O'Hare about a year ago.

Initial investigation indicated that the crew had become distracted 
from their landing check-list by TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance 
System) warnings which sounded repeatedly as they flew through the busy 
airspace around O'Hare. The 727's gear warning did not trigger because 
the flap setting was 25 degrees instead of the usual 27.5 (in order to 
maintain speed on approach as requested by air traffic control). A ground 
proximity warning did sound at 500 ft, but lack of gear is only one of 
a number of possible causes for this warning.

A taxiing American Airlines pilot saw the 727 on short final with no gear. 
The tower radio transcript makes hair-raising reading:

The 727 succeeded in executing a go-around, but not before scraping the rear

A few months ago, there was an excellent article in RISKS about the problems
of the year date rolling from xx/xx/99 to xx/xx/00 and how it could affect
computer systems. Today I mentioned the article in passing to a rep at
my local bank as I was making a routine deposit.  She said:  "It's happening
already."  Apparently there is a problem with some of the credit cards
they have been issuing to their customers.  The expiration date on them
is the year 2000, and for some tech reason she could not explain, two
major stores here in town refuse to take them "because that weird date
messes up their computers."  

I regret that I cannot offer more info than this, but it is serious food 
for thought...

   I am a big fan of Voice Recognition Technology, however trite
and useless people may say it is.  And one thing that people have
failed to mention so far that there are ways to prevent/discourage
oral hacking (at least with Macintosh's general program).
   With the Mac program there is an option that allows the user to 
name the computer something other than "Computer."  There is another
option for setting an "Attention Key" to basically give the program
earplugs until that key is pressed again.  There is also a voice
recognizing option that sets how precise your language must be.  
   It is doubtful, at least to me, that somebody running around the 
office yelling "Computer, Restart, Yes" would restart my Mac, whose 
name is Alfred, has the precision level set rather high, and also
has the voice recognition asleep until i press Keypad-0.

It occurs to me that the English vocabulary might be related to why
people have reacted so strongly to the existence of this bug -- which,
let's face it, is not all that devastating *relative to other bugs*.
The term "computer" suggests that computation is the most important
and fundamental thing that the machine does, and because of this, any
bug directly related to computation is seen as more serious than others.

In French the machine is called an "ordinateur", which is related to our
word "ordinal" and conveys connotations of *organizing* data.  What we
mostly call computer science, they call "informatique" -- the study of
information.  And if you think about what computers are used for today,
you will see that these terms are at least as fitting as the English ones.
In English when we really mean that computation is the important part of
the work, we use terms like "numerical" in addition to "computing".

Would English speakers have reacted equally strongly to a -- no pun intended
-- comparable bug in the instructions for comparing and branching?  I think
they would not.

(No, you don't need to tell me that a large part of the reaction in this
case was to Intel's reaction, not to the original problem.)

A recent McNeil-Lehrer report (I'm pretty sure it was Tuesday night's  -- 
12/20/1994) had an intelligent commentator as an interviewee on the Pentium 
situation.

I agree with his comments about the Pentium (that the problem was probably
more severe than Intel admitted and less severe than IBM trumpetted), but
the reason I'm pointing this interview out is because Robin McNeil asked
something to the effect, "So the issue is also that we shouldn't trust an
answer just because the computer gave it to us?"  The interviewee answered
that this was just so, and that we should keep asking for and demanding
proof that the computer is giving good answers.

There were also what I thought were intelligent comments on the difficulty 
of thoroughly testing such complex parts, and that testing had to involve 
strategies to maximize the confidence obtained.

I hope that one of your other submitters has given (or will give) the 
identity of the interviewee, and some exact quotes.  I was impressed by his 
grasp of the big picture, and that he managed to convey it to the 
interviewer, too.  (I think the choice of interviewer helped, but even 
intelligent interviewers can't be prepared to understand all issues, and 
McN-L tend to have more news on political and economic issues than on 
technical issues).

Hope you caught the interview, too!

In regards to <A HREF="/Risks/16.64.html">RISKS-16.64</A> here are some thoughts and concerns about
financial payments on the World Wide Web, CommerceNet, the Internet, and
electronic media in general:
 
Debit card payments today require an additional piece of authenticating data
- the Personnel Identification Number or PIN. There are ISO (9564) and ANSI
(X9.8) standards which tell us how to securely formulate a PIN block and
encrypt it using the Data Encryption Algorithm or DEA (X3.92).  Credit card
payments may soon also require the PIN.  However, we have no standards today
telling us how to encrypt PINs using public key algorithms.  True, the
advent of the smartcard may eliminate the transmission of PINs, but not for
a while yet (years?).
 
Speaking of public key cryptosystems, there ARE existing ISO and ANSI
standards available today:
     ISO-CD 11568 parts 4 and 5 just completed the public ballot process.
     ANSI X9.30 part 1 - The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
     ANSI X9.30 part 2 - The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)
     ANSI X9.30 part 3 - Certificate Management for the DSA is completing its
                         public ballot process.
 
However, due to the legal problems between Cylink Corporation and RSA Data
Security on fair licensing agreements for the RSA patents, the matching set
of ANSI standards (X9.31 parts 1, 2, and 3) for RSA may be put on hold by
the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X9 - for further details, call:
     X9 secretariat, American Bankers Association (ABA), 202-663-5284
     X9F chairman, Marty Ferris, 202-622-1110
     X9F1 chairman, Blake Greenlee, 203-762-8580
 
Although the standard addresses the DSA, X9.30-3 Certificate Management is
rather generic and deals with the roles and responsibilities of the
asymmetric key pair owners, the certificate authority(s), and the public key
users.  Interesting stuff and can (and should be) used for implementing any
public key cryptosystem.  Copies can be purchased from the ABA (plug).

Keith Henson (RISKS 14.63) points out that computer viruses and human fads
fit Richard Dawkins' concept of a meme, adding

  What computers and fast communications have done is to radically change the
  replication constants for memes, and to make unworkable the controls society
  has tried to put on such things.

In "Mind Viruses" (American Scientist, Jan-Feb 1995, p.26), Michael Szpir
discusses 'human information parasites', such as the St. Jude 1 chain letter,
likened to memes by Dawkins and Oliver Goodenough (Nature, Sept 1, 1994). 

Some years ago, I received an electronic chain letter, complete with lengthy
sequential history of previous senders.  These letters differ from the old-
fashioned kind -- they always have return addresses.  It occurred to me that
the appropriate response was to SEND IT BACK, and encourage the sender and all
others to do likewise, hoping an avalanche of returned mail would eventually
swamp the original sender, if it didn't bring the network to its knees. 

No such luck.  I actually tried it, forwarding the letter back to the
sender with subject LET'S SEND IT BACK.  Unfortunately, he returned it
immediately, longer by two headers, with subject THAT'S NOT FAIR...IT'S
GOT TO BE 5 OTHER PEOPLE.  I did not repeat the experiment, though I tried
unsuccessfully to get others to do so. 

Still, I wonder, next time a chain letter or other intentional meme spreads
through the Internet, if everyone returned their copies to the sender ...

In the 05 Dec 1994 issue of _Network World_ on p. 41, "John Doe" recounts
his tale of woe after advertising on the Internet ("Ad leads to a nightmare
on Cyber-Street).  In brief, his main points are

* Placed ads in several USENET groups.
* Swamped with email abuse and flames in the groups as a result.
* Someone posted his 800- number in alt.sex groups as a phone-sex #.
* Switchboard swamped with requests for phone sex; operators horrified.
* One switchboard op quit because of what callers were saying.
* All 800- calls switched to the originator of the advertising as punishment.
* Impractical to cancel 800- service because of special letter combinations.

Moral:  don't advertise on the Net.

&lt;&lt;Comments by MK:

One issue is whether it's good or bad to advertise on the Net.

Another is whether it's good or bad to respond to advertising on the Net in the
ways demonstrated in this case.

Yet another is that exactly the same techniques could be used against any
organization even if it _doesn't_ advertise on the Net.&gt;&gt;

Subject: Upper Managements View of Information Security(Infoworld 12/19/94)

The following extract from _INFOWORLD_ 12/19/94 demonstrates some of the
risks inherent in human management. (I read this shortly before reading
RISKS 16.66 and the posts calling for papers and serious work in all areas
of network and computer security).

42% of senior management at U.S. companies consider information security to
be only "somewhat important" or "not important," according to a survey by
Ernst and Young LLP, with 15% of companies devoting no full time resources
to security. This though even more than half the respondents reported
information-related losses.  Also , among respondents who said they were
running "mission-critical applications" on their LAN's, half reported that
security was unsatisfactory. What will it take to make security a priority
in industry? The Stealth bomber blueprint on place mats in Pizza Hut?  (end
copy)

We can only hope that some of the recent antics and activities on the
network cause these top managers to focus some their energies, and resources
on the protection of their (our?) data.  Analysis of all probable problems
and or threats should precede implementation of any changes to or
introduction any systems.  I think most readers of RISKS would enjoy reading
the entire poll and possibly having helped in phrasing some of those obscure
questions, and "open to interpretation answers."

The Washington Post printed a full page of old stock prices one day last
week in their business section.  According to their explanation, the data is
normally stored in a file named "ap stox 2".  In preparing the erroneous
page, a user saw "ap stox2" (i.e. no space) "elsewhere in the machine" and
used it instead.

The article also says that "Steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence".
I wonder what kind of steps?  Educating users?  Probably the most useful
thing to do would be to have the date in the filename, so an old file could
not be mistaken for current data.

The Associated Press newswire for 94.12.26 @ 02:43 EST (via CompuServe's
Executive News Service) reports a case of failed identification and
authentication:

	Sting Backfires.

	MIAMI (AP) -- FBI agents thought they were setting a trap 
	by buying copies of 35 Medicare cards and selling them to 
	a suspected fraud operation.

	But now the cards are being used to buy expensive leg braces 
	and other medical equipment -- and the FBI can't track them.
 
	"The FBI lost control of the cards. Now they have a monster 
	on their hands," a government investigator familiar with the 
	case told The Miami Herald for a story in Sunday's issues.

According to the story, Medicare spokesperson "Faye Baggiano, associate
administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration in
Washington," admits that they have used the social insurance number as the
Medicare identifier; therefore "Medicare says it can't cancel the copied cards,
which have been circulating for 16 months, because that would wipe out
legitimate federal benefits to the people whose names are on those cards."

Normally, Medicare "provides phony numbers that can be canceled; it is unclear
why the FBI used real numbers.

An analysis of just 10 of the 35 stolen cards shows "a total of $163,745 for
services that the real card holders say they never got or tried to get."

&lt;&lt;Comments by MK:  yet another case where inadequate identification and
authentication leads to problems--not to speak of the design error of using
production data for test purposes!&gt;&gt;

The attached is from the headline story Tuesday 27 December of the
Courier-Mail newspaper (ph: +61 7 2526011, fax: +61 7 2526696) in the state
of Queensland, Australia. I thought it may be of interest to readers of
"Risks" as it covers a number of themes discussed before:

              $25m power bungle - Report slams hi-tech move
                          Exclusive by Ed Southorn

A $25 million project to turn one of the state's power stations into an
automated plant created an unsafe workplace requiring twice the number of
engineers to run, a confidential report reveals.  The new automatic control
systems also caused more than $1.5 million damage to machinery at the
Swanbank station near Ipswich.

...The audit found the Swanbank automatic control system had failed to
protect the plant from damage.  The system had been unable to prevent a
"trip" (temporary shutdown) cutting oil flow to a turbine. This had resulted
in a bent shaft leaving the turbine with reduced generating capacity.
...The automatic alarm system which tells operators how the plant is
functioning was not properly operating almost two years after it was
installed.  ...The report found lack of adequate testing before
commissioning and "waving of proper commissioning and acceptance testing
procedures" and "a single-minded drive to meet target dates."

Police in Israel have started an investigation last week to determine how
the entire population registry of the country has ended up being offered for
sale by a private company, on a CD ROM disk for $1200.

Political parties are entitled to get the voters registry (which includes
people's names, addresses, birth dates and ID number) from the Ministry of
the Interior.  The latest elections in 1992 were the first time this
information was disseminated on a CD ROM and not just printouts; these disks
should have been returned to the Ministry after the elections, and were
coded and numbered, but it's not clear from newspaper reports here how this
coding was done, and how this was supposed to prevent the parties or their
employees from keeping their own copies.

In addition to the registry (which is actually public information, though
not freely available) the government-owned phone company sells a disk
containing all phone books, and the government's companies registry is also
available (I'm not sure if it is sold legally).

All this information enabled a TV reporter to demonstrate getting the list
of all companies privately directed by the minister of Finance (including
the names of all other directors), or the private address and phone number
of the chief of the Mossad and all of his neighbors (which were shown on
screen, though with illegible resolution).

Israel is a small country, but it's only a matter of time and computing
power before this kind of personal information processing is available
everywhere.

Perhaps it didn't happen on Mary Payne's watch; but I do recall there was a
problem with floating point in early VAX-11/780 machines.  Believe it
required a microcode change, and a board swap for machines equipped with a
floating point accelerator.  Then there was the early production G.E. 635
floating point problem which resulted from truncating, rather than rounding,
a 2's complement number, giving a negative bias to the results.  Supposedly
(urban legend alert!) this was recognized as important when a tape calculated
on one of the machines was used to operate a numerically-controlled cutting
torch.  The torch was supposed to cut a circular plate out of a thick piece
of steel.  The actual cut had a jog in it, resembling (coincidentally, I'm
sure) the "Intel Inside" logo.  Then there was the floating point problem
early in the life of the IBM 360 series.  As I recall this was not so much
an error as a surprisingly sudden loss of significance resulting from the
base-16 fractions, such that a shift for exponent alignment shifted four
bits at a time.  And I recall some allegation about an early CDC machine
(1604? 3600?) in which fixed point -1 x -1 = -1.

 &gt; Is this just a ploy to line their pockets from their captive market?

No. Take another look at the figures you quoted. It costs *more* to support
pulse dialing. They can't go 100% touchtone until all their subscribers quit
using old gear. So they have to keep the "pulse counters" around (and
maintained) until then. Therefore, if you want pulse dialing, they are going
to charge you $2 extra each month.

This is the most *sensible* thing I've seen a phone co. do in a long time.
It encourages folks to quit using pulse/rotary phones. And it gives them
hard figures on how many folks still can't use touchtone.

In an article by Andrew Lawler in _Science_ magazine (94.11.25; 266:1315)
entitled "Court says no to copying articles," we read of a recent case which
may affect anyone who collects news, newspaper, magazine and journal
articles:

	Thinking of photocopying an article from your favorite journal?
	Think again.  Last month [in October 94] a three-member federal
	appeals court in New York ruled that a Texaco Corp. scientist
	violated copyright laws by making one copy each of eight articles
	in a scientific journal and placing them in his files.  The
	2-1 ruling dramatizes the uncertainty over what constitutes fair
	use of copyrighted material, say lawyers familiar with the case,
	adding that the ruling should prompt companies and universities
	to review their policies toward copying.

According to the author, the suit was launched by the American Geophysical
Union (AGU) and more than 80 other plaintiffs.  They accused Texaco of
"copying and distributing hundreds of scientific articles to hundreds of
researchers" and picked a sample case for the civil suit.

The court ruled that because the scientist in the sample case (David
Chickering, who copied the eight articles from the journal _Catalysis_)
filed the papers away in his library rather than use them immediately, he
was in violation of the fair use laws governing copyrighted materials.

The dissenting judge wrote that because the defendant used the copied
materials for research only, that use fell under existing fair use doctrine.

"Jon Baumgarten of Proskauer. Rpse. Gpetz &amp; Mendelsohn in Washington," one
of the lawyers for the plaintiffs, said that it's not true that "all
educational use is fair use."  He advised academic researchers to "Consult
with your university counsel before making copies."

&lt;&lt;Comments by M.K.: This ruling has serious implications for anyone who uses
online databases of bibliographic material; e.g., the Computer Database Plus
owned by Information Access Company (IAC) and available on CD-ROM and online
via CompuServe. The terms of use for the online service include the
following text:

	TERMS AND CONDITIONS
	
	Computer Database Plus and its contents are
	copyright (c) 1988-1994 by Information Access
	Company (IAC) and/or its data suppliers. Copying,
	retransmitting, redistributing or publishing any
	part of this database, either in hardcopy or
	electronically, is prohibited.
	
	The material contained in this database is
	provided only to individual users.  Users may
	electronically store downloaded material only to
	facilitate changing the format or presentation of
	the material. If the user is retrieving
	information on behalf of another, the user may
	supply only one (1) printed copy.  Copyright
	notices must not be removed from any material
	retrieved from this database.

Judging from the ruling described above, the IAC may very well be able to
argue that its rules are _not_ superseded by fair use doctrine.  Thus
storing specific articles in files on one's own hard disk for later search
and use may be prohibited regardless of intention or actual use.

Similarly, the Executive News (ENS) Service on CompuServe, which provides
news wire feeds in real time, allows users to store captured stories
("clippings") for a maximum of 14 days, after which they are discarded
automatically.  The introductory text for this service makes no specific
restrictions on storage.

In ENS, individual newswires have different copyright wording:

* AP includes, "All rights reserved.  The information 
  contained in this news report may not be republished 
  or redistributed without the prior written authority 
  of The Associated Press."

* Reuter's entries state, "Copyright Reuters America Inc. 
  1994.  All rights reserved."

* UPI articles include only, "Copyright 1994 United Press International"

* Washington Post has, "Copyright 1994 The Washington Post."

It may be that storing copies of these articles in one's own online archives
is actionable.

For those unfamiliar with fair use doctrine, I include the following
commentary to stimulate further thought and discussion:

 -------------------- %&lt;&gt;== --------------------------

        US COPYRIGHT OFFICE CIRCULAR ON FAIR USE (1993)

One of the rights accorded to the owner of copyright is the right to
reproduce or to authorize others to reproduce the work in copies or
phonorecords. This right is subject to certain limitations found in sections
107 through 120 of the copyright act (title 17, U.S. Code). One of the more
important limitations is the doctrine of "fair use." Although fair use was
not mentioned in the previous copyright law, the doctrine has developed
through a substantial number of court decisions over the years. This
doctrine has been codified in section 107 of the copyright law.

Section 107 contains a list of the various purposes for which the
reproduction of a particular work may be considered "fair," such as
criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
Section 107 also sets out four factors to be considered in determining
whether or not a particular use is fair:
	(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether
	
	    such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit 	
	    educational purposes;
	(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
	(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in 	
	    relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and 
	(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or 	
	    value of the copyrighted work.

The distinction between "fair use" and infringement may be unclear and not
easily defined. There is no specific number of words, lines, or notes that
may safely be taken without permission.  Acknowledging the source of the
copyrighted material does not substitute for obtaining permission.

The 1961 _Report of the Register of Copyrights on the General Revision of
the U.S. Copyright Law_ cites examples of activities that courts have
regarded as fair use: "quotation of excerpts in a review or criticism for
purposes of illustration or comment; quotation of short passages in a
scholarly or technical work, for illustration or clarification of the
author's observations; use in a parody of some of the content of the work
parodied; summary of an address or article, with brief quotations, in a news
report; reproduction by a library of a portion of a work to replace part of
a damaged copy; reproduction by a teacher or student of a small part of a
work to illustrate a lesson; reproduction of a work in legislative or
judicial proceedings or reports; incidental and fortuitous reproduction, in
a newsreel or broadcast, of a work located in the scene of an event being
reported."

Copyright protects the particular way an author has expressed himself; it
does not extend to any ideas, systems, or factual information conveyed in
the work.

The safest course is always to get permission from the copyright owner
before using copyrighted material. The Copyright Office cannot give this
permission.

When it is impracticable to obtain permission, use of copyrighted material
should be avoided unless the doctrine of "fair use" would clearly apply to
the situation. The Copyright Office can neither determine if a certain use
may be considered "fair" nor advise on possible copyright violations. If
there is any doubt, it is advisable to consult an attorney.

***Last update 6/10/93 (raa)***

       -------------------- %&lt;&gt;== --------------------------

Another useful document is the following:

(DRAFT VERSION) COPYRIGHT LAW AND MULTIMEDIA DEVELOPMENT IN EDUCATION

Section 106 of the Copyrights Act (P.L. 94-553) describes the exclusive
rights of copyright owners.

"[T]he owner of copyright...has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize
any of the following:

1.   To reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;

2.   To prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;

3.  To distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the
public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or
lending;

4.   In the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the
copyrighted work publicly; and

5.  In the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the
individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display
the copyrighted work publicly."

The fair use provision of the Copyrights Act is found in Section 107 which is
reproduced below.

"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, the fair use of a
copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or
phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes
such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple
copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement
of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any
particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include--

1.   the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a
commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;

2.   the nature of the copyrighted work;

3.   the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole; and

4.   the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
copyrighted work."

The legislative history which speaks to the fair use provision acknowledges:

"The judicial doctrine of fair use, one of the most important and well
established limitations on the exclusive right of copyright owners, would be
given express statutory recognition for the first time in section 107. The
claim that a defendant's acts constituted a fair use rather than an
infringement has been raised as a defense in innumerable copyright actions
over the years, and there is ample case law recognizing the existence of the
doctrine and applying it."

It should be noted that at this point, the legislative history reiterates the
four points listed above from section 107. Fair use must meet all four criteria
to be a protected activity.

"Although the courts have considered and ruled upon the fair use doctrine over
and over again, no real definition of the concept has ever emerged. Indeed,
since the doctrine is an equitable rule of reason, no generally applicable
definition is possible, and each case raising the question must be decided on
its own facts. On the other hand, the courts have evolved a set of criteria
which, though in no case definitive or determinative, provide some gauge for
balancing the equities.  These criteria have been stated in various ways, but
essentially they can all be reduced to the four standards which have been
adopted in section 107...."

There are no definitive standards or guidelines governing the use of
copyrighted materials in the preparation of multimedia courseware for
instruction, or classroom presentations utilizing multimedia. However, while
developing these products, faculty should be governed by the same criteria
which are prescribed for the use of copyrighted print materials. In essence,
the use of copyrighted print materials is governed by three criteria:

Spontaneity: The "fair use" of copyrighted materials in an educational
setting should be at the "instance and inspiration of the individual
teacher...."  Further, the "inspiration and decision to use the work and the
moment of its use for maximum teaching effectiveness" must be so close
together in time "that it would be unreasonable to expect a timely reply to
a request for permission." In other words, the decision to use the material
must be the instructor's and not dictated by management or administration
and it must be a spontaneous decision.

Brevity: With regard to print media, the guidelines are specific even to the
point of specifying the maximum length of an excerpt from poetry or prose.
Though these limits do not apply to non-print media, they clearly indicate
that the intent is for a small portion of the original to be copied under
fair use, and not a substantial portion of the work.

Cumulative Effect: "...copying of...material is for only one course in the
school in which the copies are made." The guidelines for copying of print
media, states "[n]ot more than one short poem, article, story, essay or two
excepts from the same author, nor more than three from the same collective
work or periodical volume during one class term" is permitted.  Even though
the media may be different, faculty can best avoid copyright infringement by
following the spirit of these guidelines when dealing with other forms of
media in a multimedia presentation. For instance, using 8 minutes from a 10
minute video tape (in a multimedia presentation) would appear to violate the
fair use guidelines by diminishing the "potential market" and value of the
copyrighted work.

Instructors should be aware that when relying on the fair use provision, the
use of copyrighted materials must meet all three tests (spontaneity,
brevity, and cumulative effect). Instructors are encouraged to procure
copyright releases for materials which they anticipate using for longer than
one term.

Finally, the guidelines (developed by the Ad Hoc Committee on Copyright
Revision, the Author-Publisher Group, and the Association of American
Publishers) also indicate that

1.   "Copying shall not be used to create or to replace or substitute for
anthologies, compilations, or collective works..."

2.   Copying is not allowed from consumable works  such as "workbooks,
exercises, standardized tests and test booklets and answer sheets...."

3.  "Copying shall not substitute for the purchase of books, publisher's
reprints or periodicals...(and shall not) be repeated with respect to the
same item by the same teacher from term to term."

It should be noted that clip art, clip video, and clip audio are marketed
and available for use in developing multimedia materials. These forms of
"clip media" are licensed to the purchaser (individual, school, or faculty
member) for use in multimedia presentations. In many cases, clip media can
