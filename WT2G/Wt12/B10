<H3><FONT SIZE=5> Recommendation to Cosponsor a Study to Investigate
Potential Health Effects of PM10 in the Coachella Valley</H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and
fine particulate matter smaller than 10 microns (PM10) continue
to be exceeded in several areas in the South Coast Air Basin,
although a decrease in peak levels of these pollutants has been
observed in recent years. The Basin is required to meet the federal
health standard for PM10 by the year 2006.
<P>
PM10 is a complex mixture of pollutants derived from both natural
and combustion sources that have significantly different size
fractions. This pollutant mixture is associated with increased
human morbidity and mortality, and is also responsible for significant
visibility degradation in the Basin.
<P>
Fugitive dust from natural sources in desert environments, and
road dust in urban areas, accounts for 40-50 percent of ambient
PM10 and constitute a major fraction of coarse mode particles.
These two components of PM10 are targeted for future control measures.
Although there is a growing body of scientific evidence to support
the theory that fine particles are probably more toxic than the
coarse particles, no evidence exists to support the corollary
that coarse particles are relatively safe.
<P>
Often control regulations targeting various fractions of PM10
(size and/or chemical species) are developed to meet NAAQS achievement
deadlines. Since these regulations are not necessarily based on
the toxicity profile of those specific fractions of PM10, the
regulated community questions the efficacy of these regulations
to provide true health benefits. Hence, to prioritize the components
of PM10 targeted for controls, and to ensure that maximum health
benefits are derived from each pollutant fraction targeted for
control, it is necessary to determine the relative roles of coarse
(natural sources) and fine (combustion sources) particles in causing
adverse health effects.
<P>
The District has been awarded $375,000 from the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's (EPA) 105 Grant program to conduct the following
activities:
<P>
$350,000 for health effects studies to determine the impact of
air pollution on public health and to estimate benefits derived
from reducing ambient levels of PM10 and ozone in the South Coast
Basin;
<P>
$25,000 for public information projects, related to these health
effects studies, to be coordinated by the Coalition for Clean
Air.
<P>
From the health effects studies portion of this 105 Grant, staff
recommends funding the research project described below in the
amount of $204,186. The purpose of this study shall be to determine
whether the coarse particles derived from desert dust storms are
as toxic as fine particles originated mostly from combustion sources.
AQMD and EPA staff are presently working together to identify
and select an additional health study to be funded by the remaining
$145,964 available in this category. In addition, AQMD, EPA and
the Coalition for Clean Air staff are working together to finalize
the work plan for public information and out-reach projects to
be funded by the grant support of $25,000 received under the latter
category.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
Staff has reviewed a proposal from the California Public Health
Foundation (CPHF) and the Office of Environmental Health and Hazard
Assessments (OEHHA) investigators to conduct a two phase health
study in the Coachella Valley region. This region has been designated
as a serious non-attainment area for PM10. Desert dust dominates
the coarse fraction of PM10, while secondary and combustion-source
particles transported from the Los Angeles Basin contribute to
the fine fraction of PM10 in this region. The main objective of
the study is to determine whether the coarse particles (natural
desert dust) are as toxic as fine particles generated from combustion
sources.
<P>
In Phase I, which is retrospective in nature, investigators will
analyze data collected from August 1989 through December 1994.
In this analysis, the relationship between measured levels of
PM10 and calculated levels of particulate matter smaller than
2.5 microns (PM2.5) (from airport visibility data) with health
indices of the local population (based on emergency department
visits and hospital admissions from the three hospitals in the
region) will be determined. Daily monitoring in phase II will
assist with validating the PM2.5 levels calculated in phase I
of the study. The results will be useful in identifying those
fraction(s) of PM10 that must either be targeted for control or
be avoided, depending on its toxic profile as observed in this
phase of the study.
<P>
In phase II, investigators will conduct data analyses similar
to those conducted in Phase I, with data collected from 1995 through
1998. However, in Phase II the ambient data will be based on daily
monitoring of PM10, PM2.5, and ozone levels for a period of three
years beginning in the summer or fall of 1995. This duration of
three years may be reduced if the results of Phase I indicate
that adequate statistical significance is achievable with a shorter
follow-up period. The results of Phase II will be used to develop
District's future control and regulatory policies.
<P>
Data analyses conducted during both phases would involve controlling
for weather and time-series regression techniques which have proven
to be appropriate statistical methodologies for such studies.
The analyses will also determine the role of co-pollutants, such
as ozone, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, that are routinely
monitored in the study area.
<P>
The proposal has been peer reviewed by two experts in the field
of air pollution epidemiology and statistical methods (Drs. Arden
Pope from Brigham Young University in Utah and Suresh Moolgavkar
from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Washington) and
EPA Region IX staff. All evaluators have recommended approval
of this proposal.
<P>
Staff proposes to set up an advisory panel comprised of these
reviewers to oversee the progress of the study, assist in successful
completion of this study, and review and comment on the reports
(progress and final) submitted by the investigators.
<P>
<B>Sole-Source Justification</B> 
<P>
Section II, Step C(3) of the Consultant Selection Policy identifies
four provisions under which a sole-source award may be justified:
(1) cost to prepare documents exceeds the cost for consultants,
(2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health, (3)
services are only available from sole-source, (4) other circumstances
exist identifying sole-source as in the best interests of the
AQMD.
<P>
This request for a sole-source award is being made under provision
#4. The information obtained from this study will be crucial for
the AQMD to target control measures against those PM10 fractions
that pose maximum health threat to the public health. In other
words, better public health protection will be achieved at a lower
cost by prioritizing the PM10 fraction(s) for control based on
their relative toxic roles than on their contributory role to
violate the Federal and/or State Standards. The information will
also help in developing future AQMPs, SIPs and FIPs for the Coachella
Valley, which is designated as a serious non-attainment area for
PM10.
<P>
The ambient profile of PM10 in the Coachella Valley differs significantly
from the rest of the AQMD and eastern United States, both in terms
of size fractions and chemical species. Thus, the use of results
from health effects studies conducted in the eastern United States
to develop control strategies for Coachella Valley becomes questionable.
Hence, this site-specific study design was developed by the investigators
to account for these differences.
<P>
The EPA staff are of the opinion that, &quot;this study will fill
an important knowledge gap and address nagging questions about
the importance of certain PM source categories&quot;. Also, U.S.
EPA, Region IX, is providing the fiscal support needed to fund
this and other health effects studies to address the PM10 related
issues which are specific to the District.
<P>
Thus, it is in the AQMD best interests to join the California
Public Health Foundation and the Office of Environmental Health
and Hazard Assessments (OEHHA) in this effort. This will also
ensure a cost savings of 31 percent in labor costs (in-kind support
of investigators time) and the proposed 19.5 percent of indirect
costs is far lower than the typically observed 30-60 percent (New
York University, California Institute of Technology).
<P>
<B>Financial Terms</B> 
<P>
The total cost of the proposed project is $297,726. Cofunders
include OEHHA $93,540 (in-kind) and the EPA, through the AQMD,
in the amount of $204,186 (direct). With recognition and appropriation
of the EPA 105 grant, sufficient funds are available in the Fiscal
Year 1995-96 Technology Advancement budget to fund this project.
<P>
This recommendation was approved by the Technology Committee on
September 13, 1995 and was approved for full Board authorization.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Recognize $375,000 in revenue based on the award of a cooperative
agreement with EPA.
<P>
--Appropriate $375,000 from the undesignated fund balance to the
Technology Advancement, Services and Supplies Major Object, Professional
and Special Services Account.
<P>
--Authorize the Chairman to execute an agreement with California
Public Health Foundation, in an amount not to exceed $205,000
to conduct an epidemiological study to determine the relative
toxic roles of coarse and fine particles on the local population
health indices.
<P>
--Authorize the Chairman to execute an agreement with the Coalition
for Clean Air, in an amount not to exceed $25,000 for public information
projects subject to submittal of a work-plan satisfactory to the
AQMD and the EPA staff.

<H3><CENTER><B> <FONT SIZE=5> Recommendation to Execute an Agreement
with the University of California, Riverside to Conduct PM10 Emissions
Testing from Smoking Vehicles </B></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Mobile sources are responsible for a large portion of the region's
air quality problem. It has become apparent that in crafting cost-effective
control strategies the linkage between ozone and fine particulate
matter (PM10) has an increasing and critical importance. Recent
studies indicate that health effects of PM10 are far more adverse
than earlier thought. However, PM10 has been designated a criteria
pollutant only since 1987. Therefore, the research in developing
the emissions inventory of PM10 has been very limited.
<P>
The next attainment plan for PM10 is due to EPA by February 1997.
To establish the foundation for the attainment plan, the Governing
Board, at its December 9, 1994 meeting recognized the need for
an improved emissions inventory by approving financial support
for a PM10 Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP) presented by Planning
staff.
<P>
It is believed that a significant portion of PM10 emissions from
mobile sources are contributed from gross smoking vehicles. During
the past few years, District has developed a vast database of
smoking vehicles in the South Coast Air Basin through implementation
of the CUT-SMOG program. Staff recommends that a PM10 emissions
study of twenty representative light duty vehicles be conducted
by using the CUT-SMOG program database. In addition, staff recommends
that a limited population density analysis be conducted for heavy
duty smoking vehicles. The study will satisfy the objectives of
PTEP, and the outcome will be used for the development of EPA's
attainment plan. The database obtained from this study can also
be used as a baseline for assessment of emissions benefits by
the rapid introduction of clean fuels, and improvement of the
existing mobile source emission models.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
The College of Engineering Center for Environmental Research and
Technology (CE-CERT) at the University of California, Riverside
(UCR), has established a state-of-the-art research facility that
includes a vehicle emissions research laboratory and an atmospheric
chamber laboratory, specifically for application to this type
of research. CE-CERT proposes to conduct the study to provide
a full technical assessment of PM10 and PM2.5 total emissions
and their respective emission factors from light duty smoking
vehicles.
<P>
The proposed program will involve the following aspects: identification
of one year of data collected from smoking vehicles during the
AQMD's CUT-SMOG program; determination of the fleet's age distribution
and fuel type; development of a detailed test plan describing
the methodology and procedures for vehicle selection, emissions
measurements, data analysis and evaluation; inspection of several
vehicles and selection of twenty light-duty smoking vehicles for
engine wear and suitable for dynamometer test; sample collection
and measurement of total PM10 and PM2.5 in grams per mile and
the respective emission factors from each of the twenty vehicles;
population density assessment of light-duty and heavy-duty smoking
vehicles; evaluation of emissions contribution of light-duty smoking
vehicles; creation and validation of a database of emissions results
and vehicles characteristics, including but not limited to, license
plate, year, make, model, and mileage.
<P>
The study may be expanded in the near future with funding from
the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) and
other governmental and industrial sources. The expanded study
may include measurements of gaseous and particulate emissions
from approximately 400 vehicles, which could serve as the basis
for future EMFAC and MOBILE models.
<P>
<B>Sole-Source Justification</B> 
<P>
Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant Selection Policy identifies
four provisions under which the Governing Board may award a sole-source
contract: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds the cost for consultants,
(2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health, (3)
services are only available from sole-source, (4) other circumstances
exist identifying sole-source as in the best interest of the District.
This request for sole-source award is being made under provision
(3).
<P>
CE-CERT was established to facilitate more rapid transfer of air
pollution control technology and to provide independent testing
for new scientific technology under consideration by industry
or regulatory agencies. To accomplish this, CE-CERT is bringing
together a critical mass of experience from academia, industry,
and government agencies to work on collaborative research projects.
<P>
CE-CERT has developed an advanced vehicle emissions research laboratory.
The facility contains state-of-the-art testing equipment, including
a 48&quot; electric dynamometer, a dilution tunnel, a size fractionated
sampling system, and the capability for full chemical speciation
of exhaust emissions and particulate size distribution from vehicles.
This makes CE-CERT the only laboratory in the region able to conduct
the entire exhaust sampling, particulate matter measurements,
and on-road smoking vehicles density assessment and data analysis
in house.
<P>
CE-CERT's expertise in emissions evaluations of conventional and
alternative fuel vehicles, environmental impact studies of emissions
from mobile sources utilizing smog chambers, and development and
application of enhanced transportation models will be critical
to the success of this project.
<P>
<B>Financial Terms</B> 
<P>
The total cost of the proposed scope of work is estimated to be
$150,000. Staff recommends that up to $150,000 in AQMD funding
be authorized to support UCR for this project.
<P>
Sufficient funds were transferred from Planning, Transportation
and Information Management to Technology Advancement to fund this
project. This recommendation was approved by the Technology Committee
on September 13, 1995.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Authorize the Chairman to execute an agreement with the University
of California, Riverside in an amount not to exceed $150,000 to
conduct a study of particulate matter emissions from light-duty
smoking vehicles.

<B>Background</B> 
<P>
On April 14, 1995, the AQMD Governing Board approved Request for
Proposals (RFP) #9495-29, entitled &quot;Demonstration of Airport
Ground Service Equipment (GSE) Electrification.&quot; This RFP
solicited a wide range of proposals for demonstration of electrified
GSE, such as aircraft tow tractors, cargo loaders and carts used
on the airport tarmac, including both new GSE concepts and existing
commercial GSE.
<P>
Staff received four proposals in response to this RFP. Of the
four proposals received, two involved research and development
(R&amp;D) of new electric GSE technology. The other two were commercialization
in nature, whereby the bidders sought reimbursement for the differential
purchase cost of new, commercially available electric GSE, above
the cost of standard diesel units. All proposals received met
the broad requirements set forth in the RFP. The RFP evaluation
criteria, however, were not sufficient to enable staff to evaluate
the two diverse types of proposals, R&amp;D and commercialization,
on an equivalent basis. Staff, therefore, proposes to reissue
the RFP with a narrower scope focusing on R&amp;D rather than
commercialization.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
The revised RFP solicits demonstrations in support of 1994 AQMP
Control Measure #94MOF-06, &quot;Control of Emissions From Aircraft
and Ground Support Equipment.&quot; Airports are considered among
the largest single source emitters because they attract millions
of air passengers every year. Airports also attract other related
business and accommodations, which in turn generate more vehicle
traffic and emissions, including freight companies, rental car
companies and restaurants.
<P>
Two recent studies conducted by the Electric Power Research Institute
(EPRI) at Boston's Logan and San Diego International Airports
showed that use of electro-technologies would result in reductions
of more than 70 percent in vehicle-related particulate, hydrocarbon,
and carbon monoxide emissions. The reduction of nitrogen oxide
emissions could be as great as 70 percent, depending on the type
and number of vehicles converted. Carbon dioxide emissions could
fall by approximately 30 percent. The population of GSE is estimated
to be about 5,000 at Basin airports. Currently, GSE are not required
to meet any emission standards..
<P>
The revised RFP #9596-10 focuses on the R&amp;D of new types of
electric GSE rather than equipment which has already been commercialized.
Such a focus serves to expand the availability of low-emission
GSE and increases the options airlines and airports have to improve
their operations and reduce emissions. It should also be noted
that staff is interested in evaluating proposals to demonstrate
fuel cell technology as a means to electrify GSE, either as a
direct source of propulsion or as a near-zero-emissions source
for recharging battery-powered GSE.
<P>
Proposals received will be evaluated by a committee consisting
of members of the Technology Advancement office, and representatives
from the Air Resources Board and the California Energy Commission
according to the criteria spelled out in he attached RFP.
<P>
<B>Financial Terms</B> 
<P>
Staff recommends that up to $500,000 in District funds be allocated
for this project. Sufficient funds are available in the Fiscal
Year 1995-96 Budget of the Technology Advancement Office for this
purpose.
<P>
The proposed RFP has been approved by the Technical Review Committee
established to review the allocation of California Health &amp;
Safety Code 40448.5 and DMV Vehicle Code 9250.11 clean-burning
fuels program funds. Further, the RFP was reviewed by the Technology
Committee on September 13, 1995 and was approved.
<P>
Staff recommends approval of the attached RFP which solicits proposals
to demonstrate the use of zero-emission technologies in airport.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Approve the attached Request for Proposals for the Demonstration
of Airport Ground Support Equipment Electrification, in an amount
not to exceed $500,000.

<H3><CENTER><B> <FONT SIZE=5> Recommendation to Cosponsor the
Demonstration of a Propane-Fueled Hybrid-Electric Refuse Truck
</B></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The 1994 Air Quality Management Plan emphasizes the use of alternative
fuels throughout the transportation sector as an air quality attainment
strategy. Heavy-duty trucks represent four percent of the vehicle
population in California, but contribute nearly 50 percent of
the NOx and over 80 percent of the on-road particulate matter
(as estimated by the Air Resources Board for the year 2000). Each
heavy-duty truck emits about 34 times more NOx than a passenger
car on a per-mile basis.
<P>
The high-NOx emissions from conventional heavy-duty diesel trucks
result from the heavy loads these trucks transport. Nearly full
engine power is needed to accelerate from a stop up to road speed
as well as to travel up grades. NOx emissions are extremely high
during these modes. Through the use of alternative fuels such
as methanol, natural gas and propane, NOx emissions can be reduced
by at least one half because the combustion characteristics are
altered. For this reason, the AQMP cites the use of alternative-fuel
trucks as a control measure.
<P>
Another potential control technology for heavy-duty trucks is
the use of hybrid-electric drives. Such systems consist of an
electric propulsion system, a battery pack, and an on-board engine-alternator
called an auxiliary power unit (APU). The electric propulsion
motor can provide good acceleration and high efficiency. In addition,
electric propulsion systems can be designed to recover the energy
normally lost during vehicle braking and return that energy to
the battery pack (regenerative braking). The battery pack would
provide all needed propulsion power and is generally fully recharged
through standard electrical outlets when the truck is out of operation.
The APU provides limited electrical power to extend the overall
range of the hybrid-electric truck, which would otherwise be limited
by the battery pack's electrical storage capacity.
<P>
The emissions from a heavy-duty hybrid-electric system should
be much lower than a conventional diesel engine. The battery pack
provides the high power needed for acceleration and hill climbing,
while the APU supplements the power requirement. The APU engine
is smaller, operates at a constant speed and load to recharge
the battery pack, and can be switched off for quiet truck operation
when desired. Through the use of an alternative fuel, APU emissions
can be reduced even further. Overall, hybrid-electric systems
have the potential to substantially reduce emissions, energy costs,
maintenance costs, operational noise, and visible smoke.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
Staff has received a proposal from the Santa Barbara County Air
Pollution Control District (SBCAPCD) to develop and demonstrate
a propane-fueled hybrid-electric refuse truck. This project is
supported by the Advanced Research Projects Administration (ARPA),
the California Trade and Commerce Agency, Caltrans, the Air Resource
Board, and Pacific Gas and Electric.
<P>
This project involves design, fabrication, testing and demonstration
of a hybrid-electric drivetrain and refuse truck system. American
Motion Systems of Ventura, California, Health Sanitation Systems
of Santa Maria, California, and Bus Manufacturing, Incorporated,
of Goleta, California, will take the lead in these activities.
After achieving satisfactory emissions and operational performance,
the truck will be demonstrated in normal refuse collection by
Health Sanitation Services in Santa Barbara County and the Los
Angeles County.
<P>
The proposed refuse truck will have a 300-horsepower alternating
current (AC) motor, energy management system, regenerative braking,
lead acid battery pack (350 volts), smart charging system, and
propane-fueled APU (Cummins 6B engine). The truck will be designed
to provide 150 miles range on a combination of power from the
batteries and APU.
<P>
Propane was selected as the fuel for the APU because of the low
emissions demonstrated by Orange County Transportation Agency
(OCTA) on propane-fueled transit buses. As a result of the low
APU emissions and intermittent battery-only operations, the hybrid-electric
refuse truck is expected to produce 80-90 percent lower emissions
than the current Cummins L-10 diesel engine it replaces.
<P>
With the proposed hybrid-electric system, the refuse truck will
begin its daily operation with the battery pack fully charged
from the electrical grid. The propane-fueled APU will be used
during transit to maximize the battery charge level. During residential
collection, the APU will be turned off to the greatest extent
possible to reduce emissions, noise, smoke, and smell. After refuse
collection, the truck's APU will be turned on again for transit
to the landfill. The same cycle will be repeated throughout the
truck's service day until the battery pack is depleted and ready
for recharging overnight.
<P>
This project should help expedite the commercial development of
such low-emission systems and their introduction into the Basin.
In addition to reducing emissions, these vehicles have the potential
for reducing fuel consumption, reducing maintenance costs, and
improving the aesthetics of neighborhood refuse collection. The
developed technology could also have application to certain types
of buses and other trucks used in the Basin.
<P>
<B>Sole-Source Justification</B> 
<P>
Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant Selection Policy identifies
four provisions under which the Governing Board may award a sole-source
contract: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds the cost for consultants,
(2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health, (3)
services are only available from sole-source, (4) other circumstances
exist identifying sole-source as in the best interest of the AQMD.
This request for sole-source award is being made under provision
(4).
<P>
SBCAPCD will be the contractor and manager for this project. As
an agency, it has had extensive experience in successfully managing
the development of battery-powered buses, natural gas buses, natural
gas trucks, electric recharging infrastructure, and natural gas
refueling infrastructure. This experience makes SBCAPCD exceptionally
suited for this project.
<P>
SBCAPCD has developed an innovative, and unique clean-fuels project.
This involves the design, fabrication, testing and inaugural demonstration
of a propane-fueled hybrid-electric drivetrain and refuse truck
system. Besides reducing controlled emissions, this technology
will reduce visible smoke and operational noise during trash collection.
<P>
SBCAPCD has assembled an exceptionally qualified team capable
of developing and demonstrating a propane-fueled hybrid-electric
refuse truck for near-term implementation and air-quality benefits.
The team includes: 1) American Motion Systems - A developer of
induction motors and electronics for controllers, inverters and
battery chargers; 2) Health Sanitation Services - A refuse collection
firm that also custom-builds its refuse hauling trucks; 3) Pacific
Gas and Electric - An electric utility that will provide data
collection and recharging equipment for the project; and 4) Bus
Manufacturing Incorporated - A bus manufacturing firm that has
experience building and testing heavy-duty electric vehicles.
<P>
SBCAPCD has obtained 32 percent costsharing for this project from
the team members. It has also obtained 40 percent costsharing
from federal and state government entities, or a total 72 percent
costsharing for this project.
<P>
For these reasons, it is in the best interest of the AQMD to award
a sole-source contract to Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control
District.
<P>
<B>Financial Terms</B> 
<P>
The total cost of the project is $880,000. Staff recommends that
the AQMD enter into a sole-source contract with SBCAPCD in an
amount not to exceed $250,000 to develop and demonstrate a propane-fueled
hybrid-electric refuse truck. This represents a leveraging of
$3.52 for every $1 of AQMD funds. The funding breakdown is as
follows:

<P>
Totals $802,000 $78,000 $880,000
<P>
Sufficient funds are available in the Fiscal Year 1995-96 Budget
of Technology Advancement to fund this project. This project was
reviewed and approved by the Technology Committee on September
13, 1995. In addition, this project has been approved by the Technical
Review committee established to review the allocation of SB 2297
funds.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Authorize the Chairman to execute an agreement with the Santa
Barbara County Air Pollution Control District in an amount not
to exceed $250,000 to develop and demonstrate a propane-fueled
hybrid-electric refuse truck.

<H3><CENTER><B> </B>Recommendation to Cosponsor the Third Year
of Development and Demonstration of a <U>Hybrid Rich-Burn/Lean-Burn
Low-NOx Engine</U> <FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
At its February 10, 1994 meeting, the Governing Board approved
cosponsoring the second phase of a multi-year project to demonstrate
a novel, low-NOx internal combustion engine. Southwest Research
Institute (SwRI), the developer of this hybrid rich-burn/lean-burn
concept, was then awarded a contract amendment to continue the
development of this stationary engine.
<P>
In SwRI's concept, one or more cylinders in a multi-cylinder engine
are operated extremely fuel rich. Under these fuel-rich conditions,
the natural gas is converted into combustion products that have
high levels of hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO). The resulting
hydrogen-rich exhaust is then injected into the engine's remaining
lean-burn cylinders to extend the lean-burn limits of natural
gas fuel and reduce NOx emissions.
<P>
This three-phase, multi-year project has been organized into five
tasks. In the first phase, Tasks 1 and 2 were completed. These
tasks involved modeling low-NOx natural-gas combustion and demonstrating
it in laboratory experiments. Under phase two, Task 3, the rich-burn
combustion process and the resulting combustion products were
studied and matched with the lean-burn combustion on a single-cylinder
test engine. Parametric studies were performed using various mixtures
of air, hydrogen and natural gas and yielded very low NOx emissions
without sacrificing engine performance. Based on these results,
under Task 4A, a full-size Waukesha natural-gas compressor engine
was acquired and converted to the rich-burn/lean-burn technology.
New hardware and electronics were developed to control air flow,
fuel flow, turbocharger boost pressure and ignition timing. The
engine was operated with an increase in horsepower and is currently
located at SwRI in San Antonio, Texas.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
SwRI has presented a proposal to complete the third and final
phase of this project. This consists of Tasks 4B and 5, the final
emissions optimization and the demonstration of the hybrid engine
in an actual field application.
<P>
The final emissions optimization, under Task 4B, is a series of
tests to determine the optimum operating parameters including
ignition timing, rich equivalence ratio, lean equivalence ratio,
relative throttle positions, and supercharger and turbocharger
control. These parameters will then be incorporated in the electronic
control system and hardware, as appropriate.
<P>
Under Task 5, a field demonstration is planned for the South Coast
Air Basin. The demonstration site will be the natural gas compressor
station for fueling natural gas buses at SunLine Transit located
in Thousand Palms, California. Following the final emissions optimization,
the hybrid engine will be transported, installed and operated
for one year. Natural gas consumption and NOx emissions will be
monitored regularly. This system is expected to provide a substantial
operating cost savings. Following this one-year demonstration,
another demonstration site will be sought in Los Angeles County.
<P>
<B>Sole-Source Justification</B> 
<P>
Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant selection policy identifies
four provisions under which the Governing Board may award a sole-source
bid: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds cost for consultant,
(2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health, (3)
services are only available from sole-source, and (4) other circumstances
exist identifying sole-source as in the best interest of the District.
<P>
This request for a sole-source bid is made under provision #3.
SwRI is uniquely qualified to complete this project. SwRI has
developed the concept for the hybrid rich-burn/lean-burn engine
through internal research and development efforts and is pursuing
patent protection. SwRI has successfully completed the first two
phases of this project, with results that are sufficiently promising
to justify continuation. SwRI has identified the South Coast Air
Basin as the initial market for this low-emission engine technology
based on its assessment of current District rules and regulations.
<P>
SwRI is a nonprofit corporation that conducts applied research
and development, with an emphasis in engine, fuel, and vehicle
research. SwRI's experience and capabilities include numerical
modeling of combustion processes and internal combustion engine
performance; complete engine and vehicle test facilities; pollutant
emissions and engine performance measurement instrumentation;
fuels analysis; engine tribology; engine design; data acquisition
instrumentation; and statistical design and analysis of modeling
and experimental results.
<P>
In addition to its unique technology and capabilities, SwRI has
been able to secure co-funding from the Southern California Gas
Company for 50 percent of the total project cost.
<P>
<B>Financial</B> 
<P>
The total cost of the three-phase, multi-year project is $1,088,372.
The third phase is estimated to cost $363,254. Southern California
Gas Company and SCAQMD intend to share this cost equally. Staff
recommends that up to $181,627 be authorized to support SwRI for
the final year of this project.
<P>
Sufficient funds are available in the Fiscal Year 1995-96 Technology
Advancement Budget to fund this project. This recommendation was
reviewed and approved by the Technology Committee on September
13, 1995. Additionally, the project has been approved by the Technical
Review Committee established to review the allocation of SB 2297
funds received from Los Angeles County vehicle registration fees.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD:
<P>
--Authorize the Chairman of the Board to execute a contract Amendment
with Southwest Research Institute for the development and demonstration
of a hybrid rich-burn/lean-burn low-NOx engine in an amount not
to exceed $181,627.

<H3><CENTER> Recommendation for Preliminary Approval of the Transportation
Conformity Memorandum of Understanding <FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
The Board adopted Rule 1902 - Transportation Conformity in September
1994. Rule 1902 codifies the federal transportation conformity
requirements in the South Coast Air Quality Management District.
At the time of adoption, AQMD staff was participating in a regionwide
effort to develop a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which would
set forth the requirements for interagency consultation as specified
in the federal transportation conformity rule. The adopting resolution
for Rule 1902 specified that Subdivision (f) of the rule would
be replaced with the MOU once all parties had signed it. The MOU
is now ready for signature by the AQMD as the representing local
air district The MOU will then be forwarded to the Air Resources
Board (ARB) to obtain the remaining signatures from the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Highway Administration, and Federal
Transit Administration. As soon as all signatures have been obtained,
the AQMD will promptly begin the amendment process for Rule 1902
and subsequently for the State Implementation Plan.
<P>
The Transportation Conformity MOU addresses policies and procedures
on interagency consultation, public involvement, and conflict
resolution. In addition, the MOU outlines the roles and responsibilities
of the various public agencies in the development process of the
regional transportation plan, transportation improvement program,
transportation projects, and conformity analyses.
<P>
Staff of the below listed public agencies worked together to complete
the MOU: AQMD, SCAG, ARB, EPA, Caltrans (Headquarters and Districts
7, 8, 11, and 12), and the county transportation commissions--Los
Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Orange County
Transportation Authority, San Bernardino Associated Governments,
and Riverside County Transportation Commission.
<P>
The Transportation Conformity MOU was reviewed and approved by
the Mobile Source Committee on September 15, 1995.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Approve the attached Transportation Conformity MOU.
<P>
--Direct the Executive Officer to schedule a public hearing to
revise Rule 1902 when all necessary parties have signed the MOU.

<HR>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
In response to a request from the Governing Board, the AQMD staff
has prepared the attached Concept Paper for Increased Compliance
Flexibility which assesses the feasibility of intercredit trading
while achieving air quality goals. Intercredit trading is based
on the concept of allowing mobile and stationary sources to trade
emission credits. This paper also includes preliminary responses
to public requests in recent months for changes to the existing
trading programs. It is important to emphasize that the policy
decisions emanating from this effort could significantly affect
the District's existing and future pollution control efforts.
<P>
Subsequent to the October Board meeting, staff plans to seek public
input on the attached report through a series of workshops to
be held in early November and will return to the Board with formal
recommendations and an action plan for final approval in early
1996. The action plan is expected to identify future rule amendments,
enforcement protocols, and auditing requirements.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Receive and file the attached report.
<P>
--Direct staff to initiate a series of workshops on intercredit
trading.
<P>
--Direct staff to report back to the Board in early 1996 with
an action plan.

listing of California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) documents
received by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD)
between August 9, 1995 and September 5, 1995 and those projects
for which the AQMD is acting as lead agency pursuant to CEQA.
<P>
<U>EIR and Document Log (Attachments A and B)</U> 
<P>
Each month, the AQMD receives numerous CEQA documents from other
public agencies on projects which could adversely affect air quality.
In the past, AQMD staff reviewed many of these documents and commented
upon the air quality analyses and possible impacts on the air
quality of the district.
<P>
Due to staffing constraints, the AQMD is no longer able to routinely
comment on the CEQA documents received. The publication of the
Board-approved <I>CEQA Air</I><U> </U><I>Quality Handbook</I>,
however, has provided local governments and other public agencies
with the necessary information to prepare appropriate air quality
analyses on projects for which they act as lead agency. As resources
permit, staff prepares comments for those projects which may have
significant regional air quality impacts (e.g., special event
centers, landfills) and those projects for which a lead or responsible
agency has specifically requested AQMD review. Monthly listings
which are shaded note those CEQA documents for which the AQMD
staff has or will prepare and submit comments to the lead agency.
A list of active projects from previous months upon which AQMD
staff are continuing to comment is included as Attachment B.
<P>
<U>AQMD Lead Agency Projects (Attachment C)</U> 
<P>
Pursuant to CEQA, the AQMD periodically acts as lead agency on
stationary source permit projects. Attachment C to this report
summarizes the active projects for which the AQMD is lead agency
and is currently preparing or has prepared environmental documentation.
<P>
Under CEQA the lead agency is responsible for determining whether
an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) or a Negative Declaration
is necessary for any proposal considered to be a &quot;project&quot;
as defined by CEQA. An EIR is prepared when the AQMD as lead agency
finds substantial evidence that the proposed project may have
a significant adverse effect on the environment. A Negative Declaration
may be prepared if the AQMD determines that the proposed project
will not generate significant adverse environmental impacts. The
Negative Declaration is a written statement describing the reasons
a proposed project will not have a significant adverse effect
on the environment and, therefore, does not require the preparation
of an EIR.
<P>
As noted in Attachment C, during August 1995, the AQMD continued
working on CEQA documents for two (2) active projects. During
that same period no new requests were received by the AQMD to
become lead agency for any stationary source permit projects.
<P>
To date in 1995, the AQMD, as lead agency, has prepared or contracted
for the preparation of and certified four (4) CEQA documents.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Receive and file the attached Report.

<H3><CENTER> Recommendation to Release a Request for Proposals
to Acquire a Source Apportionment Dispersion Model for the South

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
The South Coast Air Basin (Basin) and the Coachella Valley are
categorized as serious nonattainment areas for PM10. Under the
federal Clean Air Act, a PM10 State Implementation Plan (SIP)
must be developed and submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) by February 8, 1997. As such, the Governing Board
approved the PM10 Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP) to provide
updated technical information needed to prepare the 1997 PM10
Plan.
<P>
The PTEP identified the need to acquire a source apportionment
dispersion model capable of calculating secondary formation of
PM10 sulfate, nitrate, and organic carbon. The source apportionment
dispersion model will complement the primary PM10 modeling approach
and provides additional information regarding source contribution
at a given location.
<P>
The RFP was distributed to the PM10 Task Force members for their
review and was discussed at the Special PM10 Task Force Technical
Meeting on September 13, 1995. Staff recommends that a request
for proposals (RFP) be released to seek qualified contractors
to acquire a source apportionment dispersion model for addressing
the direct emissions of PM10 and the secondary formation of aerosol,
in an amount not to exceed $75,000. Sufficient funding is available
in Planning and Policy's current Fiscal Year (FY) 1995-96 Budget
under the Professional and Special Services Account.
<P>
This recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Mobile Source
Committee on September 15, 1995.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Approve the attached Request for Proposals to acquire a source
apportionment dispersion model for the South Coast Air Basin,
in an amount not to exceed $75,000.

Management District Board
<H3><CENTER> Recommendation to Release a Request for Proposals
to <BR>
Privatize Portions of the Annual Emissions Report Program <FONT SIZE=5>
</H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
District Rule 301 requires a facility with permitted equipment
that exceeds four tons of criteria emissions to pay annual emission
fees for various air contaminants. Each year by July 1, approximately
6,000 facilities receive emission reporting packages. Within 60
days, these facilities are required to report their emissions
and pay associated fees for the preceding fiscal year. The emissions
data received is the foundation of the AQMD's emissions inventory,
which is in turn relied upon to support various planning and rulemaking
activities. The annual emission fees received, approximately $25
million a year, account for approximately 25 percent of AQMD revenues.
Therefore, it is important that the annual emissions report program
continues to be implemented in a timely, efficient, and accurate
manner and that adequate data integrity is maintained.
<P>
Over the past three years, significant improvements have been
implemented to automate the annual emissions report program. However,
the program still requires a variety of resources to prepare and
distribute emission report packages to facilities; to collect,
compile, and review emissions and fee data; and to perform engineering
evaluation of emissions data. AQMD staff believes that some of
these steps may be performable by a private contractor at greater
efficiency and lower cost. Staff has developed the privatization
work statement of the attached RFP with the input of several industry
representatives that must file annual emission forms. The objective
of this project is to identify contractor(s) that can compile
and review annual emission data, with greater cost effectiveness
than the AQMD's existing program. Actual collection of fees and
billing adjustments will still be handled by staff.
<P>
Staff recommends that a request for proposals (RFP) be released
to seek qualified contractor(s) at a cost not to exceed $250,000.
Sufficient funding is available in Planning and Policy's Fiscal
Year 1995-96 Budget under the Professional and Special Services
Account. This recommendation was reviewed and approved by the
Administrative Committee on September 22, 1995.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Approve the attached Request for Proposals to privatize portions
of the Annual Emissions Report Program, in an amount not to exceed
$250,000.

Management District Board
<H3><CENTER> Recommendation to Award Bid for Development of a
Methodology to Assess Geographic and Temporal Ozone Control Strategies
for the South Coast Air Basin <FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
At its August 11, 1995 meeting, the Board approved the release
of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the development of a methodology
to assess geographic and temporal ozone control strategies for
the South Coast Air Basin. The objective of the proposed study
is to develop the methodology and the necessary computer tools
to assess the impacts of controlling pollutant emissions from
specific geographic areas during specific time periods at areas
of high ozone concentration in the Basin. The results of the proposed
study will aid in the development of the 1997 AQMP revision. Specifically,
the methodology could be used to identify the minimum area and
fewest source categories that could be considered in requiring
further advanced controls.
<P>
The RFP was publicly noticed and subsequently circulated to 83
firms in accordance with the AQMD's Consultant Selection Policy
and Procedures. The RFP was circulated for 30 days. By close of
bidding on September 15, 1995, three proposals were received.
The proposals were reviewed by a three-member evaluation panel
consisting of representatives from the AQMD, California Air Resources
Board, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. A summary
of the evaluation is attached. The Evaluation Panel recommended
that ENVIRON International Corporation be awarded a contract,
based on its successful point score.
<P>
Staff recommends that a bid be awarded to ENVIRON International
Corporation for an amount not to exceed $80,097. Sufficient funding
is available in Planning and Policy's Fiscal Year (FY) 1995-96
Budget under the Professional and Special Services Account.
<P>
This recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Stationary
Source Committee on September 22, 1995.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Award a contract to ENVIRON International Corporation for development
of a methodology to assess geographic and temporal ozone control
strategies for the South Coast Air Basin.
<P>
--Authorize the Chairman to execute an agreement with ENVIRON
International Corporation in an amount not to exceed $80,097.

<H3><CENTER> Recommendation to Release a Request for Proposals
for California Environmental Quality Act Analysis Assistance <FONT SIZE=5>
</H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
The 1994 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) calls for the adoption
and implementation of several rules in 1995, 1996 and beyond.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) analyses and documents
are required for most SCAQMD rules or Plans prior to their adoption.
The SCAQMD also occasionally assumes CEQA Lead Agency status for
non-SCAQMD projects located within the jurisdiction of the SCAQMD,
where the SCAQMD has discretionary permit authority. As a responsible
or commenting agency under CEQA, the SCAQMD also has the responsibility
of commenting upon the adequacy of the air quality analysis and
mitigation measures presented in the CEQA documents prepared by
other agencies.
<P>
Public Resources Code Section 21082.1 allows for the preparation
of CEQA documents by the agency itself or by a consultant under
contract to the public agency. The public agency must retain independent
review of all documents prepared by such consultant. To augment
current staff resources, staff recommends securing the services
of one or more qualified consultants under contract to the SCAQMD,
in contractual arrangements referred to here as time and materials
task order type contracts (T&amp;M). Consultant services are necessary
to assist or augment CEQA staff in preparing portions of, or entire,
CEQA documents for SCAQMD projects and non-SCAQMD projects where
the SCAQMD is Lead Agency as well as to assist from time to time
in the reviewing of CEQA documents prepared by other lead agencies.
T&amp;M contracts consist of Consultant contracts that are allocated
a specific dollar amount, but are not assigned a specific task
as part of this RFP. Subsequent to contract approval, consultants
may be assigned specific tasks for a dollar amount not to be exceeded.
The dollar amount of the task will be based on time and materials
necessary to complete that task. The SCAQMD will retain independant
review over all work performed by any consultant selected pursuant
to this RFP.
<P>
Consultants must have substantial knowledge of CEQA and CEQA case
law, substantial expertise in analyzing environmental impacts
resulting from a variety of different types of projects as well
as an understanding of the SCAQMD's rule and plan development
and adoption process. Projects will be assigned to consultants
based upon the consultant's particular area(s) of expertise and
the needs of the SCAQMD.
<P>
Staff recommends that consultants be selected through an open
bidding process according to the SCAQMD's Consultant Selection
Policy and Procedure. The consultants selected shall be retained
by T&amp;M contracts; therefore, project assignments can be issued
for specific needs and projects without resulting in lengthy consultant
selection processes for each individual project. The estimated
cost for total consultant services is $175,000, which is available
in Planning, Transportation and Information Management's/Planning
Fiscal Year 1995-96 Budget under the Professional and Special
Services account. The amount of funding allocated for consultant
contracts will depend upon each consultant's qualifications and
SCAQMD needs. Proposed funding levels for each consultant selected
will be submitted to the Board for approval. To initiate the consultant
selection process, Board approval of the attached Request for
Proposals (RFP) is necessary before it can be circulated to consultants.
<P>
This project was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee
on September 22, 1995. <I>[To be added after Committee action.]</I>

<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>

<P>
This report highlights South Coast Air Quality Management District
(AQMD) rulemaking activity for 1995 and beyond. An update of VOC
RECLAIM and other major rulemaking activities is provided below.
<P>
The VOC RECLAIM Steering Committee meeting was held on October
12, 1995. A special Governing Board study session scheduled for
September 7, 1995 was deferred to a later date.
<P>
Five public workshops on draft VOC RECLAIM were conducted in June.
A second set of public workshops is scheduled for mid-December,
1995. It is anticipated that the Public Hearing for the VOC RECLAIM
program will be held in March 1996.
<P>
The AQMD has been working with EPA and industry to develop Proposed
Rule 518.2 - Alternative Operating Conditions. This rule would
establish procedures by which a Title V facility that needs a
variance may obtain an Alternative Operating Condition that would
be recognized by EPA. This insulates facilities against federal
and citizen enforcement action when a local variance is granted.
A Public Workshop will be held in mid-October to receive input
on the proposal. The Public Hearing is scheduled for December.
<P>
Amendments to Regulation XIII are scheduled for a Public Hearing
in November. The amendments implement one of the Business Clean
Air Partnership items by forgiving past emission debts. This,
and other rule changes, will make it easier for businesses to
expand and expedite permitting. Other amendments address offset
exemptions for small emitters and replacement of ozone depleting
compounds.
<P>
Persons with any questions regarding the hearing dates listed
herein should call <BR>
(909) 396-2040.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD

</CENTER>
<P>
On July 14, 1995 the Board approved release of Request for Proposals
9596-01 to develop a program to implement Item II of the Business
Clean Air Partnership by enhancing and expanding the South Coast
Air Quality Management District's (AQMD's) current certification/registration
program. The contractor will be required to 1) compile technical
information needed to evaluate equipment for certification, 2)
prepare engineering evaluations for the equipment, and 3) design
a system and provide hardware necessary to receive and process
this information consistent with AQMD's central database requirements.
The goal is to simplify and streamline permitting requirements
for equipment common to small businesses.
<P>
A Bidders' Conference was held and four contractors submitted
proposals. Consistent with AQMD policy on consultant selection,
an evaluation panel has reviewed all proposals for ability to
perform the scope of work and cost effectiveness (see Attachment
1 for tabulation of scores). Sierra Cybernetics, Inc. of Yorba
Linda, a Minority/Women's Business Enterprise, received the most
points in the evaluation process. Staff recommends that Sierra
Cybernetics, Inc. be granted the award of the contract for an
amount not to exceed $75,000. Funding for this work has been allocated

<H3><CENTER> Recommendation to Pre-Qualify Vendors to Provide
Various Non-Consultant Services and Supplies <FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
On July 14, 1995, the Board approved the release of several Request
for Quotations (RFQs) which would be used to establish a list
of prequalified vendors from whom competitive bids may be solicited
for the purchase of various non-consultant services and supplies.
<P>
In accordance with District's Contracting and Purchasing Policy,
a public notice inviting bids was published in the Los Angeles
Times, La Opinion, Orange County Register, Riverside Press Enterprise,
San Bernardino Sun on June 15 and 22, 1995, The M/W/DVBE Source
on June 14, 1995; the Los Angeles Sentinel on June 15, 1995. In
addition it was also placed on the AQMD's Bulletin Board Services
(BBS) and RFP/Bid Information Line, and bids were mailed to various
vendors.
<P>
Fifty-five bids were mailed to suppliers of outside printing services,
in which bids were requested for photocopying services (Category
1), two- and three-color printing (Category 2), and four-color
printing (Category 3). Twenty-nine vendors responded with bids
by the closing date of July 11, 1995, two of which were disqualified
because they did not attend the mandatory bidders conferences
held on June 27 and July 6, 1995. Bids were evaluated based upon
each vendor's equipment capability (pre-press, printing, bindery)
and references. Based upon that evaluation, staff is recommending
that the vendors listed on Attachment A be certified as pre-qualified
for printing services.
<P>
Sixty-four bids were mailed to vehicle repair/maintenance vendors
and six responded with bids by the closing date of July 11, 1995.
Vendors not responding were contacted and twenty-two indicated
that they did not receive a copy of the bid and would be interested
in bidding. The bid period was extended to August 9, 1995, and
the interested vendors were mailed copies of the bid. Only one
company responded when the extended bidding closed. Bids were
evaluated based upon each vendor's type of repair/maintenance
equipment, number of certified mechanics, smog certification capability,
secured parking, pickup/delivery, and references. Based upon that
evaluation, staff is recommending that the vendors listed on Attachment
B be certified as pre-qualified for vehicle repair/maintenance
services.
<P>
The recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Administrative
Committee on September 22, 1995.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Approve the list of pre-qualified vendors on Attachments A and
B.
<P>
--Authorize the Executive Officer to establish blanket purchase
order agreements through June 30, 1996.

<P>
The Administrative Committee met on September 22, 1995, for its
monthly review
<P>
of the upcoming Board agenda. In addition to a review of the agenda,
the Committee specifically approved staff recommendations for
the agenda items specified in Attach-ment &quot;A.&quot; The Committee
discussed the status of formation of the District's Home Rule
Working Group. Board Member Hewitt suggested that the Board form
an ad hoc committee to consider senior management position vacancies.
The Administrative Committee reported that it had discussed that
issue at the August Administrative Committee meeting but, since
Mr. Hewitt was not at the August meeting, the Committee agreed
to again place a discussion item on the October Administrative
Committee agenda. The Committee also received an investments report
from a representative of the Los Angeles County Treasurer, a report
on a plan to improve the District's telephone communication with
the public, and a report on agenda format changes.
<P>
Attachment &quot;B&quot; is the Chairman's report on Board Member
travel authorized during the period August 18 to September 22,
1995.
<P>
The next Administrative Committee meeting is Friday, October 27,
1995, at 9:30 a.m.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE BOARD

</CENTER>
<P>
The Legislative Committee held its regular meeting on Friday,
September 22, 1995. An attendance record is included for your
information (<I>Attachment 1</I>).
<P>
<U>Legislative Status Report</U> 
<P>
Staff provided a comprehensive status report on pending legislation
<I>(Attachment 2). </I>To provide clarity for the Board, the legislative
status report has been divided into three sections: chaptered
bills (signed into law); enrolled bills (on Governor's desk);
and two-year bills. The Governor has until October 15 to sign
or veto enrolled bills. The Committee specifically discussed the
following bills:
<UL>
<LI>AB 259 (Escutia) would require the District to assist cities
in spending their AB 2766 vehicle registration funds. Board Member
Hewitt asked how this will be done. Staff replied that the Public
Advisor's office is handling these responsibilities already, with
support from the District's transportation and advanced technology
groups.<BR>

<LI>AB 531 (Morrissey) would establish a voluntary, statewide
registration program for portable engines alongside the District's
own permitting system. It is anticipated that several engines
will be transferred to statewide control, dropping the number
of District permits and incoming fees. However, the District will
retain enforcement authority and will be reimbursed by the state
for that work. Staff informed the Committee that Rule 2100--Registration
of Portable Equipment would be postponed so that staff could assist
the Air Resources Board in implementing AB 531.<BR>

<LI>SB 199 (Kelley) would require the District to make additional
efforts to ensure it is not duplicating other agencies' expenditures
on alternative-fuel technology, specifically the California Energy
Commission and the Air Resources Board. If this bill is signed,
the District will have to implement more formal accounting and
reporting methods. <BR>
SB 437 (Lewis) and SB 772 (Hurtt) are both regarding employer-based
trip reduction. SB 437 would prohibit public agencies from requiring
employers to implement trip reduction programs unless federal
law expressly requires them and noncompliance will provoke sanctions.
SB 772 prohibits the AQMD, only, from requiring employers to prepare
trip reduction plans, but says the District may require employers
to provide rideshare matching and transit information to their
employees. <BR>
<BR>
Chairman Jon Mikels and Board Member Hugh Hewitt asked about the
legal implications of both bills. Peter Greenwald, the District's
General Counsel, replied that federal law expressly requires employer-based
trip reduction programs in extreme nonattainment areas and sanctions
are nondiscretionary. Therefore, the AQMD must continue to comply
with federal law or face sanctions. Dr. Wallerstein added that
Congress is considering changes to the federal mandate and the
U.S. EPA is moving towards an &quot;emissions equivalence&quot;
policy. These changes could affect the legal situation significantly
but the final language and timing is unknown. Although the House
and Senate have approved a rider to U.S. EPA's budget removing
funding for ridesharing enforcement in FY 1996, President Clinton
has threatened to veto the entire VA-HUD package (of which EPA's
budget is a small part). Likewise, although the House has scheduled
a &quot;Corrections Day&quot; on ridesharing mandates in early
October--where H.R. 325 by Congressman Manzullo (R-Illinois) will
be considered--there is no parallel process in the Senate. Therefore,
the final outcome is unpredictable.<BR>
<BR>
Staff noted that District rules may already satisfy state law
since employers are no longer absolutely required to implement
trip reduction plans or programs but may elect alternative compliance
pathways (due to the Governing Board's actions in April 1995).
Mr. Hewitt proposed a legal theory that Rule 1501<I> (Work Trip
Reduction Plans)</I> does not meet state legislation, but that
a new regulation along the lines of Rule 1501.1 <I>(Alternatives
to Work Trip Reduction Plans)</I> might--if it is fashioned as
a stand-alone rule and makes ridesharing purely voluntary. Mr.
Hewitt then made four recommendations which were concurred with
by the other Board Members present:
</UL>

<P>
1) that staff seek assistance from the Air Resources Board in
<P>
obtaining a legal opinion from the state Attorney General on the
<P>
impact of SB 437 and SB 772;
<P>
2) that staff make every effort to comply with both bills by
<P>
January 1, 1996;
<P>
3) that staff begin work on a new, stand-alone rule encompassing
<P>
the alternatives contained in Rule 1501.1 and making trip
<P>
reduction purely voluntary; and
<P>
4) that staff contact Senators Hurtt and Lewis to discuss this
<P>
approach and report back to the Governing Board on their views.
<P>
In response to follow-up questions from Chairman Mikels and Board
Member Roy Wilson, staff indicated that new rule language could
be completed by the December 1995 Board meeting, that 30-day notice
would be required, and that prior CEQA documents on trip reduction
alternatives are still valid. Federal approval must also be obtained
if the Board acts to change Rule 1501 or 1501.1. Chairman Mikels
inquired whether the October public meeting on ridesharing implementation
was still needed. Staff replied that it could be postponed, but
that many parties are anxious to hear what the Board intends to
do and would benefit from an open discussion.
<UL>
<LI>SB 456 (Kelley) would set criteria for BACT determinations
and for retrofit control technology. This bill is virtually identical
to the BACT Methodology Guidelines adopted by the District in
September 1995, so little additional work is required. However,
an issue arose at the end of session that needs attention. Industry
wanted to know exactly how the &quot;off-ramp&quot; policy (setting
BACT aside for any single source) would work, prepared a draft
letter to the Senate Journal stating their interpretation, then
asked staff for a reaction. Staff suggested that the District's
BACT Task Force address the issue instead, which was agreeable
to industry and will occur in the near future.<BR>

<LI>SB 501 (Calderon) would initiate vehicle scrappage program
intended to scrap 75,000 vehicles annually in the South Coast
AQMD. However, there is not enough funding for the program. The
Air Resources Board and Bureau of Automotive Repair share responsibility
for implementation and have to determine the programs viability
by 1998. Although SB 501 does not directly require the AQMD to
do anything, the District generally assists in implementing the
State Implementation Plan. SB 501 will compete with the District's
credit rules for local businesses. To date, 5,000-6,000 vehicles
have been scrapped under Rule 1501.1, and there is a waiting list
for others to participate. <BR>

<LI>SB 962 (Russell) would modify the District's fee setting authority
to prohibit fees based on RECLAIM trading credits. At the same
time, <BR>
SB 962 would authorize necessary fee adjustments provided overall
revenues do not increase. Staff expressed its appreciation for
the efforts of Senator Russell and Curt Coleman, Southern California
Air Quality Alliance, in reaching this reasonable compromise,
which is a significant improvement over existing law.<BR>

<LI>SB 1098 (Dills) would allow marketable trading credits for
emissions reductions generated from non-permitted and/or unregulated
sources. This bill was sponsored by Southern California Edison
and the Gas Company, primarily, and is intended to facilitate
a &quot;green gold&quot; program whereby small, old high-emitting
engines can be retired for full credit. All customary safeguards
would still apply to ensure the emission reductions are permanent,
surplus, quantifiable and enforceable.<BR>

</UL>

<P>
Copies of the final bill language on all enrolled bills were also
provided to the Legislative Committee, but have not been included
with this report due to their bulk.
<P>
<U>Special Report on Assembly Bill 59 (Sher)</U> 
<P>
Staff provided a special report on AB 59<I>,</I> a solid waste
bill that was amended at the end of session to restrict air districts'
nuisance authority. Specifically, AB 59 prohibits districts from
regulating odor problems at composting facilities for two years,
using 41700 of the Health &amp; Safety Code <I>(see</I> <I>Attachment
3 for more detail). </I>Although the Bay Area AQMD and the California
Air Pollution Control Officers Association have requested a veto,
staff recommended that this District accept AB 59 and make the
best of it for three reasons. First, a veto request is futile
and would only offend Assemblyman Sher. Second, there are other
legislative solutions including interim review and bills to exempt
South Coast AQMD and/or shorten the preemption period. Finally,
AB 59 may be a blessing in disguise since odor complaints often
stem from poor land-use decisions and are not easily resolved.
Staff noted that AB 59 may not apply to the South Coast AQMD since
the District has a separate nuisance regulation (Rule 402) that
was not expressly preempted. The Committee agreed that a veto
request was inappropriate and directed staff, instead, to complete
its legal analysis of AB 59 and to discuss possible future adjustments
with Assemblyman Sher.
<P>
<U>Discussion on Action Subcommittee</U> 
<P>
At the request of Board Member William Burke (Legislative Committee
chairman), further discussion on this Action Subcommittee was
postponed until he could be present.

<P>
<B>TOPICS</B> 
<P>
<B>1. <U>Status Report on Rules 1501 and 1501.1</U></B> 
<P>
Staff gave a briefing <B>(Attachment III)</B> on the quarterly
progress report which will be presented to the Governing Board
in October. This first quarterly report includes data gathered
in July and August, but does not include September. Staff reported
on the streamlining efforts in plan preparation achieved so far
through new and simplified plan forms and the Plan-On-A-Disk.
Staff received a letter from the California Institute of Technology
(<B>Attachment IV</B>) indicating that Plan-On-A-Disk was simple
to install and easy to use. Staff indicated that the number of
worksites regulated by Rule 1501 has decreased from 5,167 to 5,043.
This decrease is due to recent rule amendments (33 employees must
report in the window before an employer is required to comply
with provisions of the rule).
<P>
Staff also reported that Update Training for Employee Transportation
Coordinators (ETCs) has been modified significantly. A self-study
guide has been developed which ETCs can study on their own in
lieu of attending Update Training Sessions. The AQMD is now conducting
Update Training Sessions free of charge.
<P>
A pilot project on VMT reduction credits by United Airlines is
in place. There are 30 employees from El Segundo and 100 Moreno
Valley residents reporting to recently opened neighborhood work
centers. The reported annual VMT savings for this project are
1.2 million miles.
<P>
Staff reported that fifteen worksites have opted to scrap old
vehicles under the Alternative I - Emission Equivalency option
of Rule 1501.1, in lieu of filing a trip reduction plan. In addition,
GM Hughes has hired consultants to study the cost effectiveness
and the feasibility of remote sensing technology for high-emitting
vehicles. A public briefing and technologies demonstration on
the various strategies available under Rule 1501.1 was held at
the AQMD on September 15, 1995. Technology vendors gave a brief
overview of their products and services, such as remote sensing
and old vehicle scrapping.
<P>
Thirty-three worksites are participating in the Alternative II
- Air Quality Investment Program option. This program is limited
to employers with 100 to 200 employees. An RFP for the Rule 1501.1
investment funds was approved in September and a Bidders Conference
is scheduled for September 15, 1995. One worksite has registered
for Alternative III - Emissions Equivalent AVR option.
<P>
Rule 1501.1 was approved by EPA under Project XL guidelines. Project
XL supplements Rule 1501 and the Federal Clean Air Act ECO requirements.
Staff then presented a more current implementation status of Rule
1501.1 (<B>Attachment V</B>).
<P>
<B>2. <U>Rule 1501/1501.1 ISR Activity Report</U></B> 
<P>
No staff presentation was made, no comments were made.
<P>
<B>3.</B> <U><B>Transportation Conformity MOU</B></U> 
<P>
Staff reported that the Transportation MOU is now ready for signature
by the AQMD as the representing local air district, and will be
forwarded to the ARB to obtain all remaining signatures. After
the signatures have been obtained, the AQMD will begin the amendment
process for Rule 1902 and subsequently for the SIP.
<P>
<B>4. <U>Legislative Update</U></B> 
<P>
Staff distributed a comprehensive status report on trip reduction
legislation and enrolled bills as of September 14, 1995 (<B>Attachment
VI</B>).
<P>
<B>5.</B> <U><B>Proposed Amended Rule 1610</B></U> 
<P>
Staff presented a status report on Proposed Amendments to Rule
1610, Old-Vehicle Scrapping. Items discussed included justification
for the proposed amendments, a summary of the proposed amendments,
as well as comments submitted to AQMD staff in response to these
amendments. Finally, a list of potential issues that may surface
at the Board Hearing scheduled for October 13th was presented
(<B>Attachment VII</B>).
<P>
<B>6.</B> <U><B>Status Report on PM10 Task Force</B></U> 
<P>
Staff presented a summary of the optional Technical Meeting of
the PM10 Task Force held on September 13, 1995. A total of 19
members or alternates were in attendance, as well as 23 visitors.
Highlights included a review of the 1994 AQMP emissions inventories;
a presentation of the AQMD's 1993 study on the air quality effects
of removing dairy industry emissions from the agricultural preserve;
a presentation by Dr. C. E. Schmidt on the current dairy emissions
study now in progress; and review of the individual projects under
the PM10 Technical Enhancement Program. Staff also presented results
from the first six months of the intensive PM10 field monitoring,
showing that the highest average PM10 levels occur in the inland
areas of the Basin; and showing that there are distinct chemical
differences between a windblown event and a stagnant event at
Rubidoux (<B>Attachment VIII</B>).
<P>
<B>7.</B> <U><B>Recommendation to Release an RFP to Acquire a
Source Apportionment Dispersion Model for the South Coast Air
Basin</B></U> 
<P>
Staff gave a presentation on the proposed release of an RFP to
acquire a source apportionment dispersion model for addressing
the direct emissions of PM10 and the secondary formation of PM10
aerosol particles. The budget for this study is not to exceed
$75,000. The PM10 Technical Enhancement Program identified the
need for this study and the PM10 Task Force has been supportive
of the study. In addition to acquiring the model, the RFP's scope
also includes: evaluating the model using three recent PM10 episodes,
training AQMD modeling staff on the use of the model, and assisting
the staff during the development of the 1997 PM10 Plan. The staff
is asking the Board to approve the release of the RFP at the October
meeting of the Governing Board. A change was made to the RFP included
in the Mobile Source Committee Package previously submitted to
members of the committee. Therefore, the revised RFP was distributed
at the meeting (<B>Attachment IX</B>).

<B>Minutes</B> 
<P>
The minutes of the July 27 and August 24, 1995, monthly meetings
were approved, as submitted, and are provided as Attachments 1
and 2, respectively.
<P>
<B>Summary of Key Agenda Items</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Fiscal Year 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program</B>

<P>
As you will recall, we approved the release of seven RFPs to solicit
bids for projects which would achieve emissions reduction benefits
for the MSRC's FY 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program.
The submittal deadline for these RFPs was Tuesday, September 19,
1995, by 5 p.m. Of the 104 proposals received by the 5 p.m deadline,
7 have been rejected for failing to meet minimum requirements.
Of the remaining 97 proposals, 5 were received for alternative
fuels/public transit projects, 3 for alternative fuels/school
bus projects, 11 for alternative fuels/heavy-duty vehicle projects,
5 for rail feeder/rail station distribution service projects,
35 for transportation control measure projects; 31 for research
and development projects; and 7 for an outreach coordinator for
the Electric Vehicle &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Program. In addition,
nine proposals were received after the 5 p.m. deadline and were
rejected. For your information I have included the spreadsheets<I>
(see Attachment 3)</I> listing the proposals received, including
the name of the submitting entity, project title, and funding
requested.
<P>
The MSRC also formed five evaluation subcommittees, each consisting
of three or more Technical Advisory Committee members. During
the month of October, these evaluation subcommittees will be reviewing,
scoring and ranking each of the proposals and preparing a preliminary
work program recommendation which the full TAC will consider at
a special meeting on October 26, 1995, at 8:30 a.m. Following
that, the full TAC will be submitting its draft work program to
the MSRC at its November 9 meeting. The MSRC is scheduled to adopt
a final work program at a special meeting on November 16 at 1:30
p.m., and we will be considering the final work program at our
December 8 Governing Board meeting.
<P>
<B>II. Contract Modification Requests</B> 
<P>
The MSRC considered only one contract modification request. The
County of San Bernardino/Sheriff Department was requesting a 90-day
contractual term extension on Contract #C94040 to convert 100
sheriff vehicles to bi-fuel. To date the San Bernardino Sheriff
Department has converted 62 vehicles. However, due to the lack
of alternative-fuel infrastructure, and other difficulties experienced
by the contractor, the CNG fuel usage of these bi-fuel vehicles
has been minimal. After receiving input from a representative
of the Sheriff Department, the MSRC issued a stop work order on
initiating any new conversions and approved a contractual term
extension until its November 9 meeting. The MSRC and the contractor
both want to ensure that the already expended funds are used optimally
to achieve the best emissions reductions feasible without wasting
additional funds on a potentially unsuccessful effort. In the
interim, an MSRC-TAC Subcommittee will meet with the contractor
to discuss how best to proceed with this project. The MSRC will
re-consider the Sheriff Department's request at its November 9
meeting after the Subcommittee has been able to develop a recommendation.
<P>
The MSRC also received and filed a report on &quot;Scope Changes
Handled Administratively by the AQMD Contract Administrator&quot;
which included two short-term, no-cost contractual term extensions
on Riverside County Contract #C93052 (Inland Empire Workstation
Exchange Project) and AeroVironment Contract #C94038 (Advanced
Electric Motorcyle Technology and Evaluation Project) and a reallocation
of co-funding costs for Cummins Power Generation, Inc., Contract
#C95008 (Plasma Particulate NOx Reduction Device).
<P>
The MSRC also recognized $260,350 in funds returned by two contractors
who requested termination of their projects due to their own internal
problems.
<P>
<B>III. Receipt and Approval of Final Reports</B> 
<P>
The MSRC received and approved five final reports, as follows:
<P>
1) City of Corona Contract #C93042, for the establishment of a
CNG fuel station and CNG conversions, with $258,936 in AB 2766
funding;
<P>
2) City of Los Angeles/Department of Airports Contract #C94017,
for the purchase of LNG buses at LAX, with $480,000 in AB 2766
funding;
<P>
3) Acurex Environmental Corporation Contract #C94043, for the
demonstration of a 7.3 litre natural gas engine for heavy-duty
vehicles, with $141,997 in AB 2766 funding;
<P>
4) Sunline Services Group Contract #C94034, the CNG Challenge
Project: A Model for Non-Urban Communities, with $80,835 in AB
2766 funding; and
<P>
5) Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County Contract #C94013,
for a demonstration project using compressed landfill gas in heavy-duty
natural gas-powered vehicles, with $227,068 in AB 2766 funding.
<P>
All final reports for the AB 2766 Discretionary Program can be
viewed in the District's Library.
<P>
<B>IV. AQMD Contract Administrator Report</B> 
<P>
The District's AB 2766 Contract Administrator provided a written
contract status report on all past fiscal year programs and a
FY 1995-97 Work Program update. This Contract Administrator report
is provided for your information as <I>Attachment 4</I>.

Dr. Sahl began his presentation by advising that he intended to
provide both a perspective and some background information regarding
the status of the EMF issue relative to the health question, electric
utility facilities, and electric vehicle technology. Dr. Sahl
reviewed the EMF spectrum demonstrating the frequency of the fields
which revolve around how much energy is present in fields that
is transferable to the human body. Dr. Sahl noted that the framing
of the issue is important to the consideration of the specific
frequency referenced.
<P>
Dr. Sahl continued that the Advisory Council would likely be concerned
with two questions, i.e., is the issue of EMF being adequately
addressed with the existing programs that are in place? and, are
there things that can be done now to avoid the negative consequences
of this issue, given the uncertainty involved? In examining electric
vehicles as they relate to EMF, Dr. Sahl recommends dividing the
issue into three parts as follows: (1) Exposure associated with
the vehicle itself; (2) EMF exposure due to the charging of the
vehicle; and, (3) as electric vehicles are charged, there is an
increase in the overall consumption of electricity throughout
the community and a correspond-ing increase in EMF exposure.
<P>
Dr. Sahl then commented that a good definition does not exist
relative to what characteristics of exposure should be considered
in defining exposure to EMF in terms of the ultimate health hazards.
This lack of a definition of exposure makes it difficult to do
a definitive epidemiologic study and raises questions about some
of the other work in terms of the laboratory, according to Dr.
Sahl. Dr. Sahl reported that his data collection on electric vehicles
and EMF exposure focuses on a 60 hertz field.
<P>
Dr. Sahl went on to advise that the projected overall increase
in electricity use attributed to electric vehicle usage is approximately
4% by 2011, with a corresponding increase in EMF of 4%; and, that
the EMF exposure to the interior of car has a position-specific
field, but is low on the front passenger seat. Upon a final review
and discussion of the various research programs existing and the
publications available on these issues, Dr. Sahl closed by commenting
that, although there is a lot of research being conducted on EMF
issues, SCE is uncertain as to whether or not there is a health
hazard associated with fields; and, if there is a health hazard
associated with fields, it hasn't been identified which characteristics
of exposure should be of concern. Dr. Sahl then asked if the Council
had any questions or areas requiring further discussion?
<P>
A brief discussion followed relative to a comparison of magnetic
fields in conventional vehicles, and where greatest concern should
be focused, e.g., in-vehicle exposure, charging, or transmission?
Dr. Sahl indicated that a traditional exposure assessment is difficult
because the definition of exposure is problematic. The Council
agreed with Chairman Hazelwood's comment that, given the fact
that reaching air quality attainment standards requires significant
use of electric vehicles, it would be wise to closely monitor
the health impact developments so that the Governing Board is
not faced with a future health epidemic attributable to this issue.
Further discussion followed relative to the viability of shielding
with respect to EMF and electric vehicles; shielding research
is currently in its preliminary stages, according to Dr. Sahl.
<P>
Dr. Sahl closed by stating that the importance of the electric
vehicle as it relates to air pollution should be the primary focus,
and that he would discourage the Council from focusing solely
on a public health perspective or diverting into related issues
that haven't reached similar levels of importance. Chairman Hazelwood
noted the Council's appreciation to Dr. Sahl for his interesting
presentation
<P>
5. The agenda item on Regulation VII -- Air Pollution Emergencies
-- followed, with a presentation by Joe Cassmassi. Mr. Cassmassi
began by acknowledging Dr. Russ Sherwin for his efforts towards
modifying Regulation VII, which will be heard by the Governing
Board on September 8. This Regulation will define the air pollution
episode criteria, as well as the actions to be taken when different
types of episodes have been reached. These actions consist of
contingency measures to curtail emissions and reduce vehicle miles
driven, with the goal of preventing or reducing the severity of
air pollution episodes.
<P>
Mr. Cassmassi advised that Regulation VII is being amended now
because air quality has steadily improved. This Regulation will
serve to streamline rule language, update the episode criteria,
eliminate outdated and redundant rule applications, and improve
outreach to schools. Mr. Cassmassi thereafter reviewed data with
respect to annual Basin maximum ozone measurements, and reviewed
the proposed amendments relating to administrative changes, predicted
Stage 2 or Stage 3 requirements, reporting requirements, and impacts
on schools.
<P>
Mr. Cassmassi emphasized that, as a result of the efforts of the
American Lung Association, amended Regulation VII will attempt
to improve the school portion of the plan by including public
and private schools, setting forth recommended outdoor activity
curtailment guidance, encouraging uniform episode response, and
predicting episode attainment. Accordingly, Mr. Cassmassi advised
that the District will be trying to get a stronger message out
to the schools.
<P>
Mr. Cassmassi went on to review key dates regarding the rule amendment
calendar and discussed various school-issues comments and general
comments received during the public-information meeting and workshop
process. General comments were received relative to the inclusion
of pre-school and daycare facilities, clarification of natural
gas curtailment issues, emergency suspension of rules, Rule 1501
comparisons, communication issues, and clarification of exemptions.
Relative to comments received on school issues, Mr. Cassmassi
reported they dealt with the original detail of the curtailment
actions proposed, specifically that they weren't stringent enough.
In addition, workshop comments on school issues included inquiries
with respect to the definition of schools, the need for an enhanced
outreach program to increase the responsiveness of the schools,
the burden of communications, the need for notification at the
federal standard, the possible establishment of a PM10 health
advisory episode, and the modified focus of PSI to focus action
towards the lower end of the scale.
<P>
According to Mr. Cassmassi, proposed rule language as a result
of these workshops includes the following: Including child daycare
facilities under the Regulation VII curtailment actions; expanding
exemptions to only electric-power generating systems to the force
majeure natural gas curtailment; including utility vehicles of
essential public services; clarification that primary means of
notification will be the news media; and, enhancement and addition
of phone lines to the interactive voice recording system for notification.
Mr. Cassmassi also reviewed rule language affecting facility requirements
with respect to Regulation VII. The effective date of this proposed
rule is
<P>
January 1, 1996.
<P>
The primary focus of the health issue with respect amended Regulation
VII, according to Mr. Cassmassi, was to strengthen the outdoor
activity curtailment actions, e.g., including child daycare facilities
and making health advisory language more direct relative to outdoor
activities/exercise, as well as adding cautionary health statements
for healthy individuals. Moreover, during periods of unhealthful
air quality, District staff will be notifying schools that susceptible
individuals should minimize their outdoor activity, and healthy
individuals who feel negative effects of air pollution should
minimize outdoor activity. Mr. Cassmassi then referenced the District's
limited authority relative to recommending outdoor activity curtailment
actions.
<P>
Regarding ozone health advisory episodes, Mr. Cassmassi reported
that the District now advises that students be directed to <U>discontinue</U>
prolonged, vigorous outdoor exercise lasting longer than one hour,
whereas in the past the recommendation was only to avoid same;
the same holds true for susceptible individuals, as well. These
statements become more stringent as Stage 1 and Stage 2 levels
are approached, stating an advisement to avoid all outdoor activities
for even healthy individuals.
<P>
In further refining proposed Regulation VII amendments, Mr. Cassmassi
briefly discussed possible Executive Officer exemption submittals;
possible revision to the PM10 health advisory issue and planned
discussions with CARB relative to EPA's revisitation of PM standards;
the use of the District's model in Coachella Valley for health
advisories; and, an investigation into alternative communications
systems to enhance outreach to schools and child daycare facilities,
providing them with prototype outdoor activity curtailment plans.
Mr. Cassmassi closed his presentation by asking for questions
from the Council.
<P>
Discussion followed with regard to the issue of voluntary compliance
and mechanisms for enforcement. Mr. Cassmassi reported that the
District does not have a mandate to enforce curtailment actions
among individual schools; however, the local PTAs may have greater
enforcement capabilities than the District. Therefore, the District
is trying to enlist their support, as well as that of the school
nurses' organizations.
<P>
Mr. Cassmassi agreed with Dr. Winer's statements that anecdotal
evidence indicates non-compliance at certain school districts,
and that there is no way to monitor or improve the situation,
apart from voluntary activities. Mel Zeldin then commented that
the District has gone as far as it can with the rule language,
within its statutory limits. Mr. Zeldin added that the success
of the program will be in the outreach program and in the involvement
of PTAs which will push the schools to adhere to the District's
recommendations.
<P>
<B>ACTION:</B> The Advisory Council directed District staff to
determine the proper (mandated) enforcement agency for enforcing
district advisories of outdoor activity curtailment action episodes
and for violation of school plans specifying curtailment actions.
<P>
Mr. Cassmassi closed by commenting that the success of this program
will be in its outreach efforts -- to schools, child daycare facilities,
and after-school sports programs -- through the mass media by
having newspapers and radio stations commit to alerting people
to call in to the District for episode notification.
<P>
6. The next agenda item, Subcommittee Report on &quot;The AQMD
Beyond 2000&quot; White Paper, was discussed in the absence of
Subcommittee Chair, Dr. Amy Walton. The Council considered whether
an August 24 meeting should be convened or whether it would be
more appropriate to have the White Paper Subcommittee meet independently
of the Council for further work.
<P>
<B>ACTION: </B>District staff to contact Dr. Walton and the Subcommittee
members to determine their preference and schedule the meeting(s)
accordingly. [Pursuant to the wishes of Dr. Walton and the Subcommittee
members, a special meeting of the Subcommittee will be held on
Thursday, September 14, at 2:00 p.m.; the next regularly scheduled
meeting of the Advisory Council will be held on Thursday, September
28, at 3:30 p.m.]
<P>
7. Committee Reports:
<P>
For the Atmospheric Sciences Committee, Dr. Carter advised that
he missed the recent VOC RECLAIM Advisory Committee meetings;
however, he provided the Council with a brief report on the estimation
of allocations in comparison with emissions, resulting in a possible
42% increase and a ten-year period wherein no emissions reductions
would be made. Refinements and adjustments will be made in the
program as a result. Dr. Carter further reported on the VOC RECLAIM
Advisory Committee's work on toxics and seasonal approaches to
emissions control.
<P>
Finally, Dr. Carter advised that, with respect to past opposition
to consideration of reactivity factors in consumer sources/stationary
sources, CARB has made an about-face on this issue and will hold
a series of workshops on reactivity-based regulation of VOC consumer
products.
<P>
No report was given by the Health/Risk Assessment Committee.
<P>
For the Regional Planning and Economics Committee, Carla Walecka
briefly reported on the work of the Market Incentives Task Force
which has been meeting to discuss the structure of the project,
the selection of consultants, and what the participants hope to
get out of the process. Ms. Walecka then commented on the disappointing
amount of discussion on the mechanisms, tools, or strategies that
will be used determine a pricing mechanism or market-incentive
based measure that could take the place of indirect source rules
for the region.
<P>
Ms. Walecka further reported that three consultants have been
engaged for three separate, but inter-related projects to: (1)
perform technical background work and analysis, (2) test how the
broader public responds to the various proposals after they've
been developed, and (3) convene focus groups to determine how
pricing measures could be made more acceptable. Scope of work
and budget schedules are currently under negotiation with SCAG,
according to Ms. Walecka.
<P>
In closing, Ms. Walecka advised that congestion pricing is one
alternative that definitely will be considered, inasmuch as grant
money was received for this purpose. In addition, it is likely
that VMT fees, particularly an emissions-based VMT fee, will be
investigated. Ms. Walecka closed by noting the cumbersome nature
of the process.
<P>
8. Other Business:
<P>
Chairman Hazelwood noted the re-appointment of the entire Advisory
Council membership for additional two-year terms.
<P>
Chairman Hazelwood further commented that the MSRC-TAC would like
to have an Advisory Council representative serve on the TAC to
assist in the AB2766 RFP funding evaluation process. Dr. Winer
commented that the Advisory Council could assist the TAC in peer
review and merit ranking of the proposals, as well as in determining
whether they effectively translate into reduced emissions. Upon
discussion of this matter among the Advisory Council members,
it was noted the MSRC-TAC membership consisted principally of
transportation control-measure experts and/or planners. There-fore,
the Advisory Council determined that, should the staff liaison
to the MSRC-TAC and/or its Chair and Vice-Chair require additional
technical peer review, the Advisory Council would certainly be
willing to provide assistance. Chairman Hazelwood commented that
the Council simply needs to be advised of what sort of technical
skills are required in the evaluation of the various proposals
received, e.g., whether they require assistance with atmospheric
sciences, health/risk assessment, or economic and social issues.
<P>
<B>ACTION:</B> District staff will inquire the same of Larry Rhinehart,
the MSRC-TAC staff liaison, and request that he discuss this matter
with the MSRC-TAC Chair and Vice-Chair, whereupon Mr. Rhinehart
will contact Chairman Hazelwood for further possible action on
the part of the Advisory Council.
<P>
Dr. Carter noted that, with respect to CARB's referenced series
of workshops on reactivity-based regulation of VOC consumer products,
he was surprised to see a lack of District representation and/or
attendance at the same. Along with staff of CARB and EPA, the
attendees consisted primarily of industry representatives.
<P>
<B>ACTION:</B> District staff to advise Dr. Carter of the District's
involvement relative to CARB's workshops on reactivity-based regulation
of VOC consumer products.
<P>
9. There were no public comments.
<P>
10. <I>There being no further business, the Advisory Council meeting
adjourned at 5:50 p.m.</I>

<P>
Quarterly Status Report On
<H3><CENTER> Rule 1501 - Work Trip Reduction Plans and Rule 1501.1
- Alternatives to Work Trip Reduction Plans and Public Testimony
on Program Effectiveness <FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
In April 1995, the South Coast Air Quality Management District
(AQMD) Governing Board amended Rule 1501 - Work Trip Reduction
Plans and adopted Rule 1501.1 - Alternatives to Work Trip Reduction
Plans.
<P>
The intent of the Rule 1501 amendments was to further streamline
the rule, reduce program implementation costs, improve rule effectiveness,
and offer additional flexibility in meeting trip reduction goals.
Rule 1501.1 provides alternatives to compliance with Rule 1501
and represents a significant departure from the trip reduction
strategies previously available to affected employers. The combined
strategies of Rule 1501 and Rule 1501.1 established the framework
for a more viable and comprehensive approach towards achieving
healthful air quality, and for attaining the indirect source and
employer trip reduction goals of the state and federal Clean Air
Acts.
<P>
Staff has prepared the attached first quarterly status report
on Rule 1501 and Rule 1501.1 pursuant to the Board Resolution
adopted on April 14, 1995. The report summarizes efforts and progress
made during the first quarter of rule implementation. The response
of employers to the streamlining efforts and the new alternatives
has been overwhelmingly positive. Since July 1, 1995 was the implementation
date for the amendments to Rule 1501 and the newly adopted Rule
1501.1, this report focuses on the first two months of the first
quarter.
<P>
In the intervening time from when the Board requested staff to
prepare the quarterly status report on Rules 1501 and 1501.1 and
hold a public hearing, several related legislative actions have
taken place or are pending at the state and federal levels. This
legislation would significantly affect future rideshare program
efforts.
<P>
In California, SB437 (Lewis) and SB772 (Hurtt) directly impact
employer trip reduction requirements. These two bills have been
approved by the Assembly and Senate and are awaiting the Governor's
signature. If chaptered, these proposed laws would become effective
on January 1, 1996.
<P>
On the federal level, the House of Representatives has the Employee
Commute Options (ECO) on its agenda for Correction Days with a
proposed amendment to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) that would
allow for alternative emissions reductions to substitute for employer
trip reductions.
<P>
In compliance with pending state law, staff has determined that
existing Rules 1501 and 1501.1 must be restructured or replaced
with a new rule. This new rule could give employers a menu of
alternatives to choose from, including emissions reductions strategies.
Trip reduction efforts might be included as a strictly voluntary
option to be selected at the sole discretion of the employer.
Such a regulation would also be in line with the proposed federal
action to allow equivalent emission reductions for CAA purposes.
Staff is checking with Senator Lewis' and Senator Hurtt's offices
regarding this approach.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD:
<P>
--Receive and file this Report.
<P>
--Receive Public Comment on Rules 1501 and 1501.1.
<P>
--Direct staff to prepare a new regulation to replace existing
Rules 1501 and 1501.1 and schedule an adoption hearing for December
8, 1995.

Respectfully,

Management District Board
<H3><CENTER> Public Hearing to Amend Rule 431.1 -Sulfur Content
of Gaseous Fuels <FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
<U>Introduction</U> 
<P>
The purpose of Rule 431.1 - Sulfur Content of Gaseous Fuels, is
to reduce sulfur oxides (SOx) emissions from combustion of gaseous
fuels. SOx emissions result in, or contribute to, the formation
of air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), sulfates (SO4)
and particulate matters (PM10), for which ambient air quality
standards have been adopted. SOx emission reductions from this
rule support the South Coast Air Quality Management District's
(AQMD's) efforts in demonstrating progress towards attainment
or maintenance of ambient air quality standards for these pollutants.
<P>
Facilities subject to Rule 431.1 generally include refineries,
utilities, oil and gas production facilities, sewage treatment
plants and landfills. Rule 431.1, sets limits for sulfur in gaseous
fuels burned in stationary combustion equipment operated at these
facilities. Rule 431.1 was originally adopted in November 1977
and has subsequently been amended a number of times to implement
additional Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) control measures
reflecting advances in control technology and to extend compliance
deadlines, when necessary.
<P>
<U>Regulatory History</U> 
<P>
Prior to a January 1982 amendment, the rule had limits for total
sulfur of 80 parts per million (ppm) for some gaseous fuels sold
and 800 ppm for gaseous fuels burned on-site. In January 1982,
Rule 431.1 was amended to expand the coverage of the rule to limit
total sulfur for biogases (sewage digester and landfill gases)
sold or burned on-site to 250 ppm and 800 ppm, respectively.
<P>
In May 1990, Rule 431.1 was amended to implement an additional
AQMP control measure by providing a single total sulfur limit
of 40 ppm for all gaseous fuels sold or burned with a final compliance
date of May 4, 1992. The amendment also included a requirement
to install and properly operate a continuous monitor to measure
total sulfur in the fuel or total SOx emissions at the stack.
Because of the unavailability of the continuous total sulfur monitors,
the rule was once more amended in October 1992, to extend the
compliance date for all gaseous fuels to May 4, 1994. Also, because
of the economic impact that the 40 ppm limit would impose on small
refiners, the amendment included an extension of the final compliance
date for small refiners to May 4, 1996.
<P>
Not all of the facilities subject to Rule 431.1 complied with
the sulfur limit requirements in effect prior to the final compliance
date of May 1994. With the adoption of the Regional Clean Air
Incentives Market (RECLAIM) program in October of 1993, facilities
which were included in RECLAIM SOx universe did not have to comply
with certain command-and-control regulations, such as Rule 431.1.
The RECLAIM SOx facilities that were no longer subject to Rule
341.1 mainly included refineries. However, with the exception
of certain landfills, all other non-RECLAIM SOx facilities are
presently in compliance with the existing requirements of Rule
431.1.
<P>
<U>Proposed Amendments</U> 
<P>
A number of concerns have arisen in the course of implementing
the most recent amendments to Rule 431.1. First, as the May 1994
final compliance date approached, cost-effective control technologies
to remove sulfur compounds from landfill gas were not available.
Thus, not all of the landfills could comply with the 40 ppm total
sulfur limit. Landfill facilities requested additional time to
investigate the feasibility and cost effectiveness of various
control technologies to remove or control sulfur compounds present
in landfill gas. This resulted in variance proceedings for several
of the landfill facilities. These variances were granted and are
in most part due to expire at the end of this year. Staff recommends
that Rule 431.1 be amended to provide additional time for affected
facilities to meet the 40 ppm total sulfur limit.
<P>
Second, with refineries now under RECLAIM, they are no longer
subject to certain command-and-control rules, such as Rule 431.1.
However, some refineries sell gaseous fuels to non-RECLAIM SOx
facilities. The seller is not prohibited from selling its fuel
gas, but Rule 431.1 does not allow the non-RECLAIM SOx facility
to buy and/or burn this non-compliant gas in its equipment. Therefore,
both RECLAIM and non-RECLAIM sources have requested an exemption
to allow the non-RECLAIM sources to continue to purchase and burn
such non-compliant gas. Staff agrees and recommends that Rule
431.1 be amended to allow for this sale, purchase and use of non-compliant
gas.
<P>
Third, the sewage treatment and landfill facilities requested
additional flexibility to comply with the rule by increasing the
averaging period for total sulfur limit. Since the existing rule
has a four-hour average sulfur limit, short term variations in
biogas production could result in non-compliance periods. The
increased averaging period will allow the facilities to better
handle variations in the sulfur levels in biogases produced during
process upsets and could result in potential cost savings. Staff
agrees and recommends that Rule 431.1 be amended to increase the
sulfur limit averaging period.
<P>
Finally, the October 1992 amendment included an extension of the
compliance date for small refiners from May 1994 to May 1996.
During rule development for that amendment an interim sulfur limit
was inadvertently omitted. This current amendment cures that omission
by now incorporating it into this proposal.
<P>
The main changes to Rule 431.1 are summarized as follows:
<UL>
<LI>a three-year extension of the final compliance date for landfill
facilities to July 1997, and incorporation of an interim daily
limit of 150 ppm sulfur for landfill gas;
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>increased averaging period for biogases from four hours to
daily;
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>option to comply with a monthly averaging period for biogases
with a total sulfur cap of 200 ppm for landfill gas and 500 ppm
for sewage digester gas along with continuous monitoring to determine
the total sulfur in the fuel gas, or total SOx from the stack;
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>option to allow facilities which burn gaseous fuels in two
or more different pieces of equipment to comply with the sulfur
limit on the aggregate within the facility, rather than for individual
pieces of equipment in which the fuel is burned;
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>an 18-month extension in the compliance schedule for facilities
that were previously exempt or were previously in compliance,
but because of changes in gas production rate or gas quality,
would now have to control sulfur compounds in the gaseous fuel
in order to comply with the rule requirements;
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>quality assurance/quality control requirements for continuous
monitors used to demonstrate compliance with the rule;
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>an exemption for facilities subject to the requirements of
this rule to allow them to buy and burn non-compliant fuel gas
from a RECLAIM SOx facility, provided that all of the SOx emissions
generated from the burning of the subject fuel are reported as
SOx emissions from the RECLAIM SOx facility; and
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>a guideline for approval of alternative monitoring plans.
</UL>

<P>
Other proposed changes are minor and are added to clarify and
improve the enforceability of the rule.
<P>
<U>CEQA and Socioeconomic Analyses</U> 
<P>
Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the
AQMD prepared a Draft Supplemental Environmental Assessment (EA)
to the March 1990 EA for Rule 431.1 - Sulfur Content of Gaseous
Fuels, and Rule 431.2 - Sulfur Content of Liquid Fuels, for the
proposed amendments to Rule 431.1. The Draft Supplemental EA was
circulated for a 45-day public review and comment period, which
ended September 1, 1995. There were no comments received on the
Draft Supplemental EA. The Final Supplemental EA is included in
this Final Rule Package.
<P>
Due to the bulk of the previously prepared CEQA documents for
Rule 431.1, the previous CEQA documents have been distributed
to Board members only. Those wishing to view the referenced previous
CEQA documents may do so by contacting the AQMD's Public Information
Center at (909) 396-3600.
<P>
In addition, the AQMD prepared a Draft Socioeconomic Assessment
as part of the draft staff report, which addresses the socioeconomic
impacts of the proposed amendments to Rule 431.1. The Final Socioeconomic
Assessment is included as part of the final staff report.
<P>
Two public workshops were held for the proposed amendments to
Rule 431.1 on April 28, 1995 and July 5, 1995. The Public Hearing
to amend Rule 431.1 on October 13, 1995, was set on August 11,
1995. As per the Notice of Public Hearing, written comments were
accepted through August 29, 1995. All written comments received
by that date were reviewed and responded to by staff in the final
staff report which is part of this Public Hearing package for
the rule amendment. As a result of the comments received on the
proposed rule, staff now proposes additional changes to Proposed
Amended Rule 431.1. These changes, however, are administrative
in nature and do not affect either the CEQA or Socioeconomic Assessment
which were done without an assessment of these minor changes.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Certify the Final Supplemental Environmental Assessment for
the proposed amendments to Rule 431.1 - Sulfur Content of Gaseous
Fuels, in accordance with the attached Resolution.
<P>

<H3><CENTER> Public Hearing to Adopt Proposed Amendments to Rule
1610 - Old Vehicle <FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
Proposed Amended Rule 1610 would provide additional flexibility
in the generation of mobile source emission reduction credits
(MSERCs) and would also increase the credit life of MSERCs generated
under this rule. The proposed amendments will make Rule 1610 consistent
with Rule 1501.1. Specifically, the proposed amendments would
extend the life of Rule 1610 MSERCs from three to five years and
allow for the generation of MSERCs for carbon monoxide and particulate
matter. In addition, amendments are proposed regarding definitions
and regarding increased flexibility in the use of Rule 1610 MSERCs
for Regulation XI rules with future compliance dates and Regulation
XIII.
<P>
Staff held a public workshop on August 3, 1995 and a public consultation
meeting on September 21, 1995 to solicit input on the proposed
amendments. Many of the issues raised at the public workshop and
consultation meeting are administrative in nature and have been
addressed to a large extent in the revised rule provisions. However,
three issues; credit banking, unrestricted trading of credits,
and application of discount factors; are under further evaluation
as part of the Inter-Credit Trading Study. Pending the findings
of that study, further amendments to Rule 1610 may be proposed,
if necessary. These issues are discussed in greater detail in
the Staff Report. It should be noted that subsequent to the Set
Hearing Package, particulate matter emission rates were received
from the Air Resources Board and incorporated into the rule language.
In the proposed amended rule, revisions since the Set Hearing
Package are shown in double underline for additions and in strikeout
for deletions.
<P>
Pursuant to the AQMD's Certified Regulatory Program and the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the AQMD has prepared an Addendum
to the previously certified Final Environmental Assessment (EA)
for Rule 1610. Since the proposed amendments do not require major
revisions to the previous EA and do not result in new significant
environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity
of previously identified significant effects, an Addendum is the
appropriate document. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15164,
an addendum need not be circulated for public review, but shall
be considered with the Final EA by the decision-making body.
<P>
The attachments to this package contain Governing Board Resolution
(Attachment A), an outline of the rule development process (Attachment
B), Proposed Rule 1610 along with a draft staff report and the
socioeconomic assessment (Attachments C), and the previously certified
Final EA and the Addendum (Attachment D). Attachment D is provided
to the Board and requesters only at this time due to the bulk
of material. The previously certified Final EA and the Addendum
are available to other members of the public at the AQMD Public
Information Center.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Certify the Addendum to the Final Environmental Assessment for
Proposed Amended Rule 1610 - Old Vehicle Scrapping, as proposed,
in accordance with the attached Resolution.
<P>

<P>
RESOLUTION NO. 95-
<P>
<B>A Resolution of the Governing Board of the South Coast Air
Quality Management District Certifying the Addendum to the Final
Environmental Assessment for Rule 1610 - Old Vehicle Scrapping
and Amending Rule 1610 - Old Vehicle Scrapping. </B>
<P>
WHEREAS, the Governing Board of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District finds and determines that Proposed Amended Rule 1610
- Old Vehicle Scrapping, is considered a &quot;project&quot; pursuant
to the terms of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA);
and
<P>
WHEREAS, the South Coast Air Quality Management District has had
its regulatory program certified pursuant to Public Resources
Code Section 21080.5 and is conducting CEQA review pursuant to
such program; and
<P>
WHEREAS, the District has previously prepared a Final Environmental
Assessment (EA) (SCAQMD No. 921113KN), pursuant to the District's
Certified Regulatory Program, setting forth the potential environmental
consequences of Rule 1610 - Old Vehicle Scrapping, and that the
Final EA, including responses to comments on the Draft EA, and
the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan were certified by
the Governing Board of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District on January 8, 1993, and recertified by the Governing
Board of the South Coast Air Quality Management District on February
11, 1994; and
<P>
WHEREAS, the staff has evaluated Proposed Amended Rule 1610 and
determined that only minor technical changes or additions are
necessary to make the previously certified Final EA for Rule 1610
adequate under CEQA, therefore an Addendum to the Final EA, which
is not required to be circulated for public review, has been prepared
in accordance with the requirements of CEQA Guidelines Section
15164; and,
<P>
WHEREAS, it is necessary that the adequacy of the Addendum to
the Final EA environmental document be determined by the Governing
Board of the South Coast Air Quality Management District prior
to its adoption; and
<P>
WHEREAS, the Governing Board of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District voting on this resolution has reviewed and considered
the Addendum to the Final EA for the Rule 1610 amendments; and,
<P>
WHEREAS, the South Coast Air Quality Management District has determined
that no significant project specific or cumulative adverse environmental
impacts will result from the project, that no mitigation measures
are required, and, therefore, no changes to the original Mitigation
Monitoring and Reporting Plan previously adopted for Rule 1610
are required and have not been prepared; and
<P>
WHEREAS the Governing Board of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District has determined that no additional socioeconomic analyses
are warranted since the emission control costs and cost-effectiveness
values will not change from the analyses performed as part of
the consideration of Rule 1610 as adopted by the Governing Board
on January 8, 1993; and
<P>
WHEREAS the Governing Board of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District voting on this Resolution has reviewed and considered
the staff's findings related to cost-effectiveness of Proposed
Amended Rule 1610 - Old Vehicle Scrapping, as set forth in the
staff report made public with the agenda package for this meeting;
and
<P>
WHEREAS Proposed Amended Rule 1610 - Old Vehicle Scrapping is
not a control measure in the 1994 Air Quality Management Plan
and thus, was not ranked by cost-effectiveness relative to other
AQMP control measures in the 1994 Air Quality Management Plan;
and
<P>
WHEREAS, the Governing Board of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District determines that there is a problem that Proposed Amended
Rule 1610 - Old Vehicle Scrapping, as proposed to be amended,
will alleviate, i.e., exceedences of state and federal ozone ambient
air quality standards in the South Coast Air Basin, and that proposed
amendments to Rule 1610 will promote the attainment and maintenance
of state and federal ambient air quality standards for ozone,
since this rule generally provides a more cost effective approach
for compliance with a broad range of rules contained in Regulation
XI, Regulation XIII, Regulation XV, and Regulation XX; and
<P>
WHEREAS, a public hearing has been properly noticed in accordance
with the provisions of Health and Safety Code Section 40725; and
<P>
WHEREAS, the Governing Board of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District has determined that a need exists to adopt Proposed Amended
Rule 1610 - Old Vehicle Scrapping, to achieve consistency between
Rule 1610 and recently adopted Rules 1501.1, 1612, and 1620 in
terms of use and applicability of mobile source emission reduction
credits; and
<P>
WHEREAS, it is recognized that older on-road motor vehicles which
have poor fuel efficiency emit higher amounts of greenhouse gases
into the atmosphere; and
<P>
WHEREAS, the Governing Board of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District obtains its authority to adopt, amend, or repeal rules
and regulations from Sections 40000, 40001, 40440, 40441, 40463,
40702, and 40725 through 40728 of the California Health and Safety
Code; and
<P>
WHEREAS, the Governing Board of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District has determined that Proposed Amended Rule 1610 - Old
Vehicle Scrapping, as proposed to be amended, is written or displayed
so that its meaning can be easily understood by the persons directly
affected by it; and
<P>
WHEREAS, the Governing Board of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District has determined that Proposed Amended Rule 1610 - Old
Vehicle Scrapping, as proposed to be amended, is in harmony with,
and not in conflict with or contradictory to, existing statutes,
court decisions, or state or federal regulations; and
<P>
WHEREAS, the Governing Board of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District has determined that Proposed Amended Rule 1610 - Old
Vehicle Scrapping does not impose the same requirements as any
existing state or federal regulation and is necessary and proper
to execute the power and duties granted to, and imposed upon the
District; and
<P>
WHEREAS, the Governing Board of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District by adopting this regulation is implementing, interpreting,
or making specific the provisions of Health and Safety Code Section
40001 (rules to achieve ambient air quality standards) and 40440
(a) and (c) (rules to carry out the Air Quality Management Plan
and rules which are also efficient and cost-effective); and
<P>

reduction credits generated would be applied towards compliance
with designated rules <U>with future compliance dates</U> within
District Regulation XI, Source Specific Standards<U>; Regulation
XV, Trip Reduction/Indirect Source; Regulation XIII, New Source
Review; Regulation XX, Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM);
or any other District regulations that allow the use of credits.</U>
<STRIKE>The value of these credits would be based on old vehicles
having at least three years useful remaining life prior to scrapping</STRIKE>.

SUMMARY AND DRAFT FINDINGS 33
<P>
<B>I. INTRODUCTION</B> 
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District (District) is
proposing amendments to Rule 1610, Old Vehicle Scrapping, which
will provide additional flexibility to meet air quality standards
in the South Coast Air Basin. Rule 1610 permits the issuance of
mobile source emission reduction credits (MSERC) for the scrapping
of older, higher emitting vehicles. The proposed modifications
to Rule 1610 primarily consist of expanding its applicability
as an alternative method of compliance with Regulation XIII and
Regulation XV, as well as redefining the applicability of Rule
1610 MSERCs for Regulation XI rules with future compliance dates.
In addition, Proposed Amended Rule 1610 extends the life of MSERCs
to five years (with certain restrictions), and allows the issuance
of carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) MSERCs.
<P>
<B>II. BACKGROUND</B> 
<P>
On January 8, 1993, the District adopted Rule 1610 to provide
an alternative method of compliance with selected Regulation XI
rule requirements. Specifically, the rule provides a mechanism
which allows stationary sources to generate ROC and NOx MSERCs
when pre-1982 model-year passenger cars and light-duty trucks
are scrapped. The original MSERCs were used to offset emission
impacts resulting from a delay in compliance with selected Regulation
XI rules.
<P>
At its public meeting on February 11, 1994, the District Governing
Board adopted amendments to Rule 1610. Modifications were made
to safeguard against the issuance of MSERCs for vehicles that
have little or no useful remaining life. Other amendments modified
vehicle eligibility requirements in order to streamline efforts
by SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers to identify and procure old vehicles.
Finally, the Governing Board issued a &quot;Code of Conduct&quot;
for SCAQMD licensed scrappers, to be a voluntary part of the scrapping
plan. The purpose of the Code of Conduct is to ensure that vehicles
of potentially historic value, as determined by car collector
club representatives, are set aside for potential resale.
<P>
<B>III. SUMMARY OF VEHICLE SCRAPPING ACTIVITY</B> 
<P>
A total of 5,999 vehicles have been scrapped under Rule 1610,
from January 1993 through July 1995, by a total of nine SCAQMD
licensed scrappers. Over 97 percent of the vehicles were scrapped
as an alternative compliance with Rule 1142, Marine Tank Vessel
Operations. The scrapping of these vehicles resulted in mobile
source emission reductions of 941 tons of VOC, 270 tons of NOx
and 4,728 tons of CO. These emission reductions are based on the
total emissions reduced over the assumed three-years remaining
useful life of each vehicle scrapped. Since Rule 1610 requires
that 1.2 pounds of VOC or NOx be reduced for each pound of credit,
the resultant MSERCs generated for Regulation XI compliance were
784 tons of VOC and 225 tons of NOx, yielding a net air quality
benefit of 157 tons of VOC and 45 tons of NOx.
<P>
Procurement of old vehicles was accomplished by persons voluntarily
providing their vehicles for scrapping upon receiving an incentive
payment. For nearly all of the pre-1972 vehicles scrapped, the
incentive payment was $700 per vehicle. For 1972 to 1974 model-year
vehicles, 94 percent were purchased for $600 each. The cost-effectiveness
of Rule 1610 is calculated by the total cost of the program (primarily
incentive payments) divided by the total emission reduction benefit.
This resulted in a combined cost-effectiveness value of $4,800
per ton of VOC+NOx reduced.
<P>
<B>IV. PROPOSED RULE AMENDMENTS</B> 
<P>
The proposed rule amendments reflect modifications to the existing
Rule 1610 that will provide consistency in the generation, use
and the life of MSERCs with similar rule provisions in Rule 1501.1,
which was adopted in April 1995. Rule 1501.1 provides companies
with alternative means of compliance with Rule 1501 (the &quot;rideshare
rule&quot;) provided that these alternatives produce equivalent
emission reductions of VOC, NOx and CO. One of the alternative
emissions reduction strategies is old vehicle scrapping, which
the District already implements through Rule 1610.
<P>
The implementation of a scrapping program for Rule 1501.1 compliance
purposes must follow the requirements of Rule 1610, with the following
exceptions. First, Rule 1501.1 allows any person to implement
an old vehicle scrapping program. Second, Rule 1501.1 allows facilities
choosing the old vehicle scrapping alternative to obtain CO MSERCs
(Currently, Rule 1610 only has provisions for the issuance of
VOC and NOx MSERCs). Third, MSERCs generated for Rule 1501 compliance
purposes are not discounted. Finally, Rule 1501.1 allows the MSERCs
generated by Rule 1610 to be valid for five years from the date
of compliance plan approval, with the limitation that no more
than one-third of the MSERCs may be consumed within one year from
the date of approval, and not more than two-thirds of the MSERCs
may be consumed within two years from the date of approval (Rule
1610 currently requires the issuance of MSERCs to be spread out
over a three year period, with a credit life of one year). The
proposed revisions to Rule 1610 will make it consistent with Rule
1501.1 with regard to the above Rule 1501.1 requirements.
<P>
Additionally, amendments are proposed to Rule 1610 in terms of
MSERC usage and Regulation XI applicability in order to make it
consistent with other credit rules <STRIKE>currently being developed
</STRIKE><I>recently adopted</I>. These include <STRIKE>Proposed
</STRIKE>Rule 1612 <STRIKE>(PR 1612)</STRIKE> -- Credits for Clean
On-Road Vehicles, and <STRIKE>Proposed </STRIKE>Rule 1620 <STRIKE>(PR
1612)</STRIKE> -- Credits for Clean Off-Road Mobile Equipment.
MSERCs generated from Rule 1610 implementation will be permitted
as an alternative method of compliance with Regulation XIII --
New Source Review, and with any Regulation XI rule with future
compliance dates, except that MSERCs cannot be used to offset
emission increases caused by the removal of control equipment
or the use of noncompliant coatings. Also, for consistency with
<STRIKE>PR </STRIKE><I>Rule </I>1612, <STRIKE>PR </STRIKE><I>Rule
</I>1620, and Rule 1501.1, proposed modifications to Rule 1610
allow the issuance of particulate matter (PM) and CO MSERCs. Finally,
various technical clarifications are being proposed to streamline
Rule 1610 implementation.
<P>
A brief summary of principal rule changes and rationale is provided
below.
<P>
1. <U>Proposed Rule Amendment</U>: Paragraph (b)(5), the definition
of Reactive Organic Compound (ROC) has been deleted and replaced
by paragraph (b)(7), Volatile Organic Compound (VOC).
<P>
<U>Rationale</U>: This modification provides clarification to
the applicability of MSERCs to make Rule 1610 consistent with
Rule<U>s</U> 1501.1<U>,</U> <STRIKE>and Proposed Rules </STRIKE>1612<U>,</U>
and 1620.
<P>
2. <U>Proposed Rule Amendment</U>: Paragraph (c)(1) has been modified
to allow <STRIKE>facilities </STRIKE><I>entities </I>subject to
Regulation XIII,<I> Regulation XX, and Rule 1501.1</I> to be certified
as SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers (in addition to Regulation XI facilities).
<P>
<U>Rationale</U>: This modification is being proposed for consistency
with Rule<U>s</U> 1501.1<STRIKE>, and proposed Rules</STRIKE>
1612 and 1620. <I> It should be noted that for the purposes of
Rule 1610 implementation, any person allowed to scrap vehicles
to generate credits pursuant to Rule 1501.1 may become an SCAQMD
Licensed Scrapper.</I> 
<P>
3. <U>Proposed Rule Amendment</U>: Subparagraph (c)(4)(C) was
modified to delete various scrapping plan information requirements.
<P>
<U>Rationale</U>: The deletion was made to eliminate requests
for information that are not necessary for scrapping programs
implemented for compliance with Rule 1501.1.
<P>
4. <U>Proposed Rule Amendment</U>: Subparagraph (f)(2)(C) has
been modified to require that persons submitting second or successive
vehicles to any one Licensed Scrapper shall provide proof of continuous
registration as an operable vehicle in the District <STRIKE>for
the two most recent years of operation </STRIKE>since January
1, 1992, in addition to providing proof of continuous vehicle
ownership for that time period.
<P>
<U>Rationale</U>: The intent of this modification will provide
additional deterrence targeted at persons attempting to resurrect
non-operational vehicles for submission into Rule 1610 scrapping
programs. The owner(s) of these vehicles would have to satisfy
stringent vehicle eligibility criteria in terms of continuous
ownership and registration as an operable vehicle <I>since January
1, 1992</I>.<STRIKE>for more than three and one-half years prior
to scrapping. In addition, providing proof for the two most recent
years of operation is proposed in replacement of the specific
date in the current rule language.</STRIKE> 
<P>
5. <U>Proposed Rule Amendment</U>: Subparagraph (f)(4)(B) has
been modified to allow the Executive Officer or designee to accept
documentation that is equivalent to the certificate of title,
in order to verify registration address history for vehicles with
two or more owners within the last two years prior to scrapping.
<P>
<U>Rationale</U>: Rule 1610 currently requires certificates of
title from all previous owners of old vehicle, for the two year
period prior to scrapping to verify address history for vehicles
with two or more owners. This modification is being proposed because
the DMV can provide acceptable <STRIKE>equivalent </STRIKE>verification
of address history <I>for this situation.</I> 
<P>
6. <U>Proposed Rule Amendment</U>: <STRIKE>The formulas in paragraph
(h)(1) have been modified to quantify total MSERCs rather than
yearly MSERCs, and to indicate that a 1.0 discount factor shall
be used for compliance with Rule 1501.1 and Regulation XIII. In
addition,</STRIKE> <STRIKE>p</STRIKE><I>P</I>aragraph (h)(7) has
been added to specify that MSERCs are valid for five years from
the date of application approval rather than three years, with
the limitation that not more than one-third of the MSERCs can
be consumed within the first year after issuance and not more
than two-thirds of MSERCs can be consumed within the first two
years after issuance.
<P>
<U>Rationale</U>: The total number of MSERCs issued has not changed
and is based on three years useful remaining life of vehicles
prior to scrapping; however, the life of these MSERCs has been
extended to 5 years with restrictions pertaining to the number
of MSERCs that can be consumed within the first two years of credit
life. The same approach has already been adopted by <I>another
</I><STRIKE>other</STRIKE> air district<STRIKE>s</STRIKE> in California.
<STRIKE>The change in discount factor to 1.0 was made for consistency
with Rule 1501.1 and Proposed Rules 1612 and 1620.</STRIKE> 
<P>
7. <U>Proposed Rule Amendment</U>: Paragraphs (h)(2), (h)(4) and
(h)(6) have been modified to include: CO and PM emission rates
of scrapped vehicles for each of three model-year groups, an average
in-use motor vehicle CO and PM emission rate for 1993 calendar
year, and CO and PM MSERCs per scrapped vehicle for each vehicle
model-year group. In addition, MSERCs are calculated to reflect
the total pounds rather than pounds per year. Finally, MSERCs
per scrapped vehicle are shown for discount factors equal to 1.2
and 1.0.
<P>
<U>Rationale</U>: Paragraphs (h)(2), (h)(4) and (h)(6) have been
modified to include the CO and PM pollutant emission rates used
to derive the CO and PM MSERCs issued per vehicle scrapped. The
total VOC, NOx, CO and PM MSERCs per scrapped vehicle are calculated
so that the company may use them as needed in the five year credit
life span, with the limitation that no more than one-third of
the MSERCs may be consumed within one year from the date of approval
and not more than two-thirds of the MSERCs may be consumed within
two years from the date of approval. MSERCs based on discount
factors of 1.2 and 1.0 are shown for consistency with paragraph
(h)(1).
<P>
<STRIKE>8.</STRIKE> <STRIKE><U>Proposed Rule Amendment</U>: Paragraph
(h)(8) has been added to allow trading of MSERCs as permitted
by Rule 1501.1 and Regulation XX. </STRIKE>
<P>
<STRIKE><U>Rationale</U>: The intent of this modification is to
only allow trading of MSERCs that will ultimately be used for
compliance with Rule 1501.1 or Regulation XX. MSERCs generated
prior to April 14, 1995 for compliance with Regulation XI can
be used for Rule 1501.1 purposes by any entity.</STRIKE> 
<P>
<STRIKE>Any new or current MSERCs to be used for Regulation XI
or Regulation XIII may only be generated or consumed by the same
entity. This issue will be further studied as part of the inter-credit
trading study. This provision of Rule 1610 will be reassessed
at the conclusion of this study.</STRIKE> 
<P>
<I>8 </I><STRIKE>9</STRIKE>. <U>Proposed Rule Amendment</U>: Paragraph
(i) has been modified to allow Rule 1610 MSERCs to be used an
alternative method of compliance with Regulation XI rules that
have future compliance dates, Rule 1501.1, Regulation XIII rules,
Regulation XX rules, any other District regulation which allows
the use of credits, or for voluntary retirement.
<P>
<U>Rationale</U>: This rule amendment makes Rule 1610 consistent
with Rule 1501.1, <STRIKE>PR</STRIKE><I>Rule </I>1612, and <STRIKE>PR</STRIKE><I>Rule
</I>1620 in terms of its applicability.
<P>
<I>9. <U>Proposed Rule Amendment</U>: The definition of discount
factor in subdivision (h) was modified to specify a 1.0 discount
factor upon generation of the MSERC(s). In addition, paragraph
(i)(2) has been added to allow for the application of a discount
factor other than 1.0 depending on the use of the MSERC(s). Specifically,
a 1.2 discount factor would be applied for credits used for compliance
with Regulation XI and Regulation XX rules and a 1.0 discount
factor would be applied for credits used for compliance with Rule
1501.1 or Regulation XIII.</I> 
<P>
<U><I>Rationale:</I></U><I> This modification provides for the
generation of undiscounted MSERCs upon generation, and the application
of a discount factor other than 1.0 when the use is specified.
Note that the use of the MSERCs may not be specified at the time
of its generation. The application of a 1.0 discount factor for
credits designated for Rule 1501.1 compliance was made for consistency
with Rule 1501.1.</I> 
<P>
<I>10. <U>Proposed Rule Amendment</U>: Paragraph (i)(4) has been
added which allows for the transfer of MSERCs as permitted by
Rule 1501.1 or Regulation XX, except that SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers
that are not subject to either District Regulation XI or Rule
1301(b)(2) may also transfer MSERCs to other entities that were
SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers as of the date the MSERCs were generated.</I>

<P>
<U><I>Rationale:</I></U><I> This modification was made to make
Rule 1610 consistent with credit trading provisions in Rule 1501.1
and Regulation XX. In addition, this language allows MSERCs to
be traded among SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers provided that the recipient
of the credits was an SCAQMD Licensed Scrapper as of the date
the MSERCs were generated. This allows entities that could otherwise
generate credits under their own SCAQMD Scrapper License to instead
purchase MSERCs from a contractor or other entity that is not
subject to Regulation XI or Rule 1303 (b)(2).</I> 
<P>
<STRIKE>10</STRIKE><I> 11</I>. <U>Proposed Rule Amendment</U>:
Subdivision (k) has been modified to separate the issuance and
designated use of MSERCs. In addition, the application is considered
a plan and a processing fee is assessed according to the provisions
of Rule 306.
<P>
<U>Rationale</U>: This modification is being proposed so that
Licensed Scrappers will have the flexibility to generate MSERCs
for multiple uses and decide later how best to allocate the consumption
of MSERCs among these uses. In addition, a potential user of MSERCs
may contact an SCAQMD Licensed Scrapper to obtain MSERCs rather
than separately implementing a vehicle scrapping program (Rule
1501.1 compliance only). This will result in lower overall program
costs, since the allocation of MSERCs for a particular rule often
depends on economic conditions associated with the affected operating
facility.
<P>
<STRIKE>11</STRIKE><I> 12</I>. <U>Proposed Rule Amendment</U>:
Subdivision (l) has been added to require the submission of compliance
plans only if the MSERCs are used as an alternative method of
compliance with Regulation XI rules or Regulations XIII rules.
Compliance plans will not be required if the MSERCs will be used
for compliance with Regulation XV rules or Regulation XX rules.
<P>
<U>Rationale:</U> The compliance plan and the associated fee is
not justified when the MSERCs are being used for Regulation XV
compliance since Regulation XV facilities are already assessed
a filing fee for using vehicle scrapping as an alternative method
of compliance. A compliance plan is not required for Regulation
XX rules since this usage simply entails the conversion of an
MSERC into an RTC.
<P>
<STRIKE>12</STRIKE><I> 13</I>. <U>Proposed Rule Amendment:</U>
Subdivision (n) has been added regarding the publishing of a public
notice with respect to a preliminary written decision to issue
MSERCs to be used as NSR offsets.
<P>
<U>Rationale:</U> This subdivision was added for compliance with
the Health and Safety Code, with regard to the issuance of NSR
offsets.
<P>
<STRIKE>13</STRIKE><I> 14</I>. <U>Proposed Rule Amendment:</U>
Subdivision (o) has been added regarding the request to hold a
hearing on whether a scrapping application was properly refused.
<P>
<U>Rationale:</U> This subdivision was added for compliance with
the Health and Safety Code Section 40713.
<P>
<I>15. <U>Proposed Rule Amendment:</U> The number of VOC MSERCs
issued for the scrapping of pre-1972 model-year passenger cars
and light-duty trucks has been increased from 330 pounds to 342
pounds, utilizing a discount factor equal to 1.0. Corresponding
changes were made utilizing a discount factor equal to 1.2.</I>

<P>
<U><I>Rationale:</I></U><I> This is a technical correction, based
on input from ARB. The increased amount of VOC MSERCs will be
available for vehicles scrapped subsequent to the adoption of
this rule amendment.</I> 
<P>
<I>In addition to the proposed rule language amendments, the &quot;Code
of Conduct&quot; for licensed scrappers will be revised to include
voluntary actions to promote the accelerated removal of older,
poorer fuel efficient vehicles in order to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</I> 
<P>
<B>V. SOCIOECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF PROPOSED AMENDED RULE 1610</B>

<P>
Rule 1610 (Old Vehicle Scrapping) provides facilities subject
to various SCAQMD Regulation XI rules, the option of using mobile
source emissions reduction credits (MSERCs) to offset emissions
reductions required by those rules. Under Rule 1610, stationary
sources can generate VOC and NOx MSERCs when pre-1982 model year
passenger cars and light duty trucks are scrapped in accordance
with the rule. Proposed Amendments to Rule 1610 will provide additional
flexibility to meet air quality standards by extending the life
of MSERCs from 3 to 5 years, allowing for the generation of carbon
monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) MSERCs, and allowing
Rule 1610 MSERCs to also be used by Regulation XIII--New Source
Review or any other SCAQMD regulation which allows the use of
credits (including Regulation XV--Trip Reduction/Indirect Source
and Regulation XX--RECLAIM).
<P>
Because the rule provides a voluntary alternative to complying
with existing rules, it would not have an effect on air quality
or emissions limitations. However, as an alternative compliance
to Rule 1501, the scrappage of old vehicles will provide equivalent
emission reductions. The state law requirements for preparing
a socioeconomic impact assessment are not applicable (H&amp;S
Sections 40728.5, 40440.8). The SCAQMD has, nevertheless, prepared
a qualitative assessment of likely socioeconomic impacts of the
proposed rules.
<P>
<B>Affected Facilities</B> 
<P>
Facilities subject to various provisions of SCAQMD Regulations
XIII, XV and XX are eligible to use the MSERCs generated under
Proposed Amended Rule 1610. The affected facilities belong to
nearly every sector of the economy.
<P>
Between January 1993 and February 1995, over 97 percent of MSERCs
from the vehicles scrapped were used to offset the required emission
reductions under Rule 1142--Marine Tank Vessel Operations. Industries
directly affected by Rule 1142 include Petroleum Products (SIC
29) and Transportation Services (SIC 44). The future use of MSERCs
is expected to increase since the proposed amendments will broaden
the use of MSERCs to any SCAQMD regulation which allows the use
of those credits.
<P>
<B>Impact on Employment and the Economy</B> 
<P>
Since Proposed Amended Rule 1610 is an optional program, affected
facilities are likely to make use of them only if the costs of
generating MSERCs is lower than that of other available controls
needed to comply with applicable source specific SCAQMD regulations.
The proposed amendments are, therefore, likely to reduce the economic
impacts of the applicable rules if the cost-effectiveness of any
applicable provision in these rules is lower than that of generating
MSERCs. Facilities which have problems meeting the requirements
of Regulation XV, or finding acceptable compliant products or
control equipment to meet future compliance dates may choose to
buy credits to obtain additional time to comply. These facilities
can receive maximum benefit from the use of MSERCs because the
proposed amended rule allows the generation of credits for CO
and PM pollutants, as opposed to the current rule which only allows
VOC and NOx MSERCs.
<P>
Proposed Amended Rule 1610 is likely to have several secondary
impacts. There will be increased demand for the services of auto
dismantlers and related services (SIC 5093). There will also likely
be an increase in the prices of used cars as more and more of
those cars are removed from service.
<P>
The proposed rules may also result in a delay in demand for other
control equipment and/or reformulated products which a source
may use for compliance with source specific regulations. The decrease
in demand for control equipment may postpone the use of new emissions
control techniques for the affected sources. As a result, industries
which supply those products (mostly the manufacturing sector)
may also be affected.
<P>
<B>Range of Costs</B> 
<P>
The cost of MSERCs will depend on the demand for pre-1982 cars
and the market prices for those cars. Between January 1993 and
February 1995, MSERCs were generated at costs that ranged from
$500 to $1,500 per vehicle. Table 1 compares the average cost-effectiveness
of Proposed Amended Rule 1610 with other SCAQMD regulations. The
cost-effectiveness of existing Rule 1610 is based on the sum of
VOC and NOx emission reductions and the costs (primarily incentive
payments) of vehicles scrapped. Under the proposed amendments,
the combined cost-effectiveness is projected to be better since
CO emission reductions will also be accounted for. The combined
cost-effectiveness is estimated at $2,280 per ton of VOC+NOx+1/7CO
reduced (1990 dollars). Negligible PM emission reductions are
anticipated.
<P>
<B>Alternatives, Emission Reduction Potential, and Necessity of
Rule Amendment</B> 
<P>
The 1994 AQMP ranks all proposed control measures by cost-effectiveness.
It is generally recommended that the most cost-effective action
be taken first. The 1994 AQMP which analyzes and ranks all control
measures and their cost-effectiveness is incorporated herein by
reference as though set forth in full. The proposed amendments
to Rule 1610 are not part of any control measure identified in
the 1994 AQMP and are, therefore, not within the identified ranking.
The proposed amendments to Rule 1610 will not reduce potential
emissions beyond those set forth in the rules for which MSERCs
are allowed to be applied. The emission reduction potential and
necessity of these amendments are discussed in Sections III and
IV of the staff report.
<P>
<B>Rule Adoption Relative to the Cost-Effectiveness Schedule</B>

<P>
On October 14, 1994, the Governing Board adopted a resolution
that requires staff to address whether proposed rules being considered
for adoption are being presented in rank order by cost-effectiveness
as defined in the 1994 AQMP. The proposed amendments are not covered
by the 1994 AQMP. Instead, these amendments are based on requests
from several public and private organizations to provide additional
flexibility and reduce compliance costs of SCAQMD regulations.
Since Rule 1610 is a voluntary program allowing alternative compliance
to a range of rules the ranking of its cost-effectiveness may
vary depending upon the rule for which it is being substituted.
As a voluntary rule it will only be used when it is more cost-effective
than the specific prohibitory or regulatory rule for which it
is being substituted.
<P>

<P>
+ The lower the cost per ton is the higher the cost-effectiveness
of the control is.
<P>
* The cost-effectiveness values do not include the 1.2 discount
factor or PM credits.
<P>
In summary, Proposed Amended Rule 1610 is likely to lower the
compliance cost for firms facing source specific or other regulations
with a lower cost-effectiveness. The proposed rule may also have
secondary, but as yet unknown, effects on the price of used cars
in the Basin.
<P>
<B>VI. PUBLIC COMMENTS</B> 
<P>
The District Staff held a public workshop on August 3, 1995 to
solicit public input and comments on Proposed Amended Rule 1610,
Old Vehicle Scrapping. A total of 20 persons attended the workshop.
Both oral and written comments were presented at the workshop
or submitted prior to the close of the comment period (August
10, 1995). <I>Because of the issues raised at the workshop, a
public consultation meeting was held on September 21 to solicit
further written comments</I>. The following is section provides
staff's responses to all comments received on Proposed Amended
Rule 1610. A list of all commentators is shown below.

<P>
Comment #1-1 Rule 1610 provides for the use of MSERCs as an alternative
method of compliance with Regulation XI rules that have future
compliance dates. However, in order for the MSERCs to be issued,
their use ( i.e., the specific rule for which the MSERCs will
be used as an alternative method of compliance) must be specified.
It would be more cost-effective for SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers
to bank MSERCs for future use, so that the precise amount of MSERCs
may be consumed in each instance where the credits are needed
for compliance with a Regulation XI rule with a future compliance
date.
<P>
Response #1-1 The proposed amendments to Rule 1610 would extend
the credit life of new MSERCs to five years. Limited banking is
allowed with the condition that no more than one-third of MSERCs
be consumed in the first year and no more than two-thirds of MSERCs
be consumed in the second year. The issue of MSERC banking is
being evaluated by staff as part of the inter-credit trading study
to be completed this fall. Upon completion of this study, Rule
1610 will be revised if necessary.
<P>
Comment #1-2 The proposed amendments to Rule 1610 expand the number
of rules where MSERCs can be used as an alternative means of compliance
and increases the life of the credits, based on future vehicle
scrapping activities. However, these proposed amendments make
no provisions for the use of &quot;existing&quot; MSERCs. Therefore,
it is requested that the District consider expanding Rule 1610's
flexibility by including provisions which would make the proposed
changes in the use and life of credits retroactively apply to
existing MSERCs.
<P>
Response #1-2 At the present time, staff is recommending to maintain
the restrictions on credit life of &quot;existing&quot; MSERCs
that were in effect at the time the vehicles were originally scrapped.
(&quot;Existing&quot; means those MSERCs that have been issued
as well as MSERCs that are scheduled to be issued as a result
of previous vehicle scrapping activities.) The assumption is that
vehicles scrapped to date were needed to comply with Regulation
XI rules. However, existing Rule 1610 MSERCs may be consumed by
any entity as an alternative compliance pursuant to Rule 1501.1.
It should be noted that staff is studying the issue of allowing
MSERCs as an alternative method of compliance with existing emission
limits as part of the inter-credit trading study.
<P>
Comment #1-3 As currently proposed, amendments to Rule 1610 disallow
trading of MSERCs between SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers except as
allowed under Rule 1501.1. It is unclear why trading would be
restricted to only one applicable rule. It is recommended that
this provision be modified to allow MSERCs trading to non-Scrapper
businesses.
<P>
Response #1-3 The issue of unrestricted MSERC trading between
any entity for compliance of rules other than Regulation XV is
being evaluated by staff as part of the inter-credit trading study
to be completed this fall. Upon completion of this study, Rule
1610 will be revised if necessary. <I>Nevertheless, in an effort
to provide additional flexibility with regard to MSERC trading,
a modification was made to the rule language. This modification
allows for the trading of MSERCs from SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers
that are not subject to either District Regulation XI or Rule
1301(b)(2) to other entities that were SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers
as of the date the MSERCs were generated.</I> See also response
to comment #1-2.
<P>
<I>Comment #1-4 The discount factor should not be applied in Rule
1610. Rather, it should be applied when the MSERC is used.</I>

<P>
<I>Response #1-4 Rule 1610 has been modified to allow the application
of a 1.0 discount factor at the time of MSERC generation, and
the application of a 1.0 or 1.2 discount factor, depending on
the use, at the time of consumption. Staff believes that this
modification satisfactorily addresses this comment.</I> 
<P>
<I>Comment #1-5 Chevron is concerned that existing MSERCs are
not going to have their life extended for up to 5 years. We have
many MSERCs that will not be used, making it ever harder for taking
pro-active companies to take risks in market-based regulations.</I>

<P>
<I>Response #1-5 Chevron obtained the full amount of MSERCs and
associated benefits (i.e., the ability to use these MSERCs as
an alternative method of compliance with Rule 1142) that they
were entitled to as a result of their vehicle scrapping activities.
Staff recognizes Chevron's proactive undertakings in vehicle scrapping
programs, and Rule 1610 recognizes these critical efforts by providing
the mechanisms to generate MSERCs. However, to continue these
proactive efforts, the proposed amendments would stimulate further
vehicle scrapping activities which will generate MSERCs with longer
life. It should be noted that the amendments to Rule 1610 will
not affect Chevron's use these existing MSERCs for 1142 compliance
purposes. The commentator is referred to response to comment #1-2.</I>

<P>
<I>Comment #1a-1 In its present form, Rule 1610 does not contain
a mechanism for banking the MSERCs generated through old vehicle
scrapping (when MSERCs are converted to Regulation XIII ERCs).
We recommend that the District reference its banking provisions
in Regulation XIII as a method to bank MSERCs. We also recommend
that the District ensure that its banking system meets State banking
requirements established pursuant to Health and Safety Code sections
40709 through 40713.</I> 
<P>
<I>Response #1a-1 District staff does not believe that it is necessary
for Rule 1610 to reference banking provisions in Regulation XIII,
since the banking provisions of Regulation XIII would be implemented
when the MSERCs are converted to ERCs.</I> 
<P>
<I>Comment #1a-2 Section (h)(1) of Proposed Amended Rule 1610
provides a formula to calculate the MSERC value per scrapped vehicle.
The District staff proposes to eliminate the &quot;unit of time&quot;
dimension of the MSERC. This formula does not agree with the formula
in the Air Resources Board's Mobile Source Emission Reduction
Credits Guidelines for the Generation and use of Mobile Source
Emission Reduction Credits.</I> 
<P>
<I>Response #1a-2 The &quot;unit of time&quot; dimension is retained,
since paragraph (h)(7) of the proposed amendments to Rule 1610
provides that MSERCs generated will be valid for up to five years,
except that no more than one-third of the MSERCs may be consumed
within one year from the date of (MSERC) approval and not more
than two-thirds of the MSERCs may be consumed within two years
from the date of approval.</I> 
<P>
<I>Comment #1a-3 Subparagraphs (h)(2)(B) and (h)(4)(B) refer to
the particulate matter (PM) emission rates for scrapped vehicles
and replacement vehicles by stating the &quot;emission rates for
PM should be obtained from the Executive Officer or designee.&quot;
The PM emission rates should be obtained from the ARB. We therefore
recommend changing the language to reflect this requirement.</I>

<P>
<I>Response #1a-3 PM emission rates, recently obtained from the
Air Resources Board Mobile Source Division, have been incorporated
into the rule language.</I> 
<P>
<I>Comment #1a-4 Paragraph (h)(7) specifies that MSERCs are valid
for five years from the date of compliance plan approval. The
only limitation is that one-third may be used in the first year
from the date of approval, and no more than two-thirds may be
used in the second year from the date of approval. This provision
of the rule should be changed to state that no more than one-third
of the total MSERCs should be used in any one year.</I> 
<P>
<I>Response #1a-5 The provision that no-more than one-third or
the MSERCs may be used in the first year from the date of approval,
and no more than two-thirds may be used during the first two years
from the date of approval is included in the amendments to Rule
1610 for consistency with Rule 1501.1 and to provide more flexibility.
The District did not receive any comments or other input from
ARB relative to this limitation on the use of MSERCs during the
development and adoption of Rule 1501.1. However, the District
intends to reexamine this issue in a broad sense in the on-going
inter-credit trading study.</I> 
<P>
<I>Comment #1a-5 It is recommended that the time period for maintaining
vehicle scrapping records for an SCAQMD Licensed Scrapper be increased
from one year to five years following the termination of vehicle
scrapping activities.</I> 
<P>
<I>Response #1a-5 District staff believes that it is sufficient
to require a one year period rather five years, for maintaining
scrapping records by the SCAQMD Scrapper after vehicle scrapping
activities have terminated. This is because the vehicle data records,
as well as related documentation submitted by the SCAQMD Licensed
Scrapper at the request of the District, are planned to be maintained
indefinitely at the District.</I> 
<P>
Comment #2-1 The proposed amendments to Rule 1610 allow auto dismantlers
and SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers to be the same entity. This poses
two problems. First, it will create economic incentives for dismantlers
to use some cars they receive in their normal course of operations,
perform minimum work to rejuvenate them, and then qualify them
as eligible for Rule 1501.1. This would undermine the air improvement
program. Second, if a dismantler chooses to become an SCAQMD Licensed
Scrapper, the dismantlers may view a firm such as ours (another
Scrapper) as potential competition, and may decline to process
vehicles for us. Such an actual experience gives rise to our concern
that dismantlers may use their market position to exclude what
they perceive as potential competition. To minimize the possibility
for abuse, our recommendation is that dismantlers be precluded
from also becoming SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers.
<P>
Response #2-1 Rule 1501.1 (adopted April 1995) allows any person
to become an SCAQMD Licensed Scrapper, including DMV licensed
auto dismantlers. Rule 1610 is being amended to be consistent
with Rule 1501.1 in this area with regard to MSERCs generated
for compliance with Rule 1501.1. Staff notes your concern regarding
auto dismantlers becoming SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers; however,
the District does not want to preclude anyone from becoming a
licensed scrapper to ensure that an adequate vehicle scrapping
market develops. It should be noted that the District will take
efforts to monitor Rule 1610 vehicle scrapping activities, whether
it is being performed by auto dismantlers or other entities, to
ensure proper enforcement of applicable Rule 1610 provisions,
in order to prevent the issuance of MSERCs for ineligible vehicles.
<P>
Comment #2-2 Because of the requirement that second or subsequent
vehicles submitted by the same owner must be owned by that owner,
it is highly improbable that a single owner will sell more than
one vehicle into Rule 1610 vehicle scrapping programs. This restriction
should be relaxed. Rule 1610 should allow the purchase of legitimate
vehicles from an auto dealer to be eligible for vehicle scrapping.
If the vehicle is legitimate, i.e., complies with other vehicle
eligibility criteria for registration, usability, etc., then why
preclude these vehicle from Rule 1610 scrapping programs?
<P>
Response #2-2 The purpose of the Rule 1610 provision regarding
second and subsequent vehicles submitted by the same owner is
to prevent the resurrection of vehicles that are already non-operational,
for the purpose of obtaining MSERCs. This is a real concern since
District staff has received input in the past from the public
indicating that this practice may occur.
<P>
<I>Comment #2-3 The Regulation XV Task Force designed the 1501.1
alternatives to the rideshare rule. Old-Vehicle Scrapping was
one of the alternatives. The rationale was that old-vehicle scrapping
would provide for net improvements in air quality. Proposed Amended
Rule 1610 affords a huge loophole for some companies to market
their surplus NOx credits to Rule 1501.1 companies, resulting
in windfall gains from excess credits having huge market value.
The result is no net gain in air quality in the transition.</I>

<P>
<I>Response #2-3 Air quality will not be negatively affected because
the NOx MSERCs represent surplus emission reductions (i.e., emission
reductions that were not otherwise required by local, state, of
federal regulations).</I> 
<P>
Comment #3-1 Rule 1610 should allow total fungibility of MSERCs
for all its intended uses. It should allow MSERCs to be banked,
debited, or otherwise held undesignated to allow for unhindered
trading.
<P>
Response #3-1 Amendments to Rule 1610 will effectively allow for
the issuance of undesignated MSERCs, so that potential MSERC consumers
will have additional flexibility for their use. MSERC banking
will be evaluated as part of the inter-credit trading study, to
be completed this fall.
<P>
Comment #3-2 Rule 1610 should generate all MSERCs as stand-alone
credits, with no discount factor (DF). The discount factor could
be applied only when the MSERC is applied to a specific rule.
A single-denomination MSERC would then be easier to track electronically.
<P>
Response #3-2 <STRIKE>At this time it is more practical to apply
the DF within Rule 1610, depending on its ultimate use. Depending
on the results from the inter-credit trading study as well as
future experience with credit trading rules, District staff may
recommend DF application in the rule where MSERCs are consumed.</STRIKE>
<I>Proposed Amended Rule 1610 has been modified to allow for all
MSERCs to be generated with a Discount Factor equal to 1.0. At
the time of usage, a Discount Factor equal to 1.2 may be applied
depending on the specific use.</I> 
<P>
Comment #3-3 The amendments to Rule 1610 should allow any entity
to generate MSERCs and allow the credits to be traded or used
by any party for compliance with any rule which allows the use
of credits as an alternative method of compliance.
<P>
Response #3-3 The amendments to Rule 1610 allow any person to
generate MSERCs and be consumed by any entity as an alternative
method of compliance for Rule 1501.1 only. <I>In addition, SCAQMD
Licensed Scrappers that are not subject to either District Regulation
XI or Rule 1303(b)(2) may also transfer MSERCs to other entities
that were SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers as of the date the MSERCs
were generated</I>. Complete flexibility on the use of MSERCs
will be studied as part of the inter-credit trading study.
<P>
Comment #3-4 The provision restricting scrapping programs to 100
or more vehicles, unless a hardship is demonstrated (i.e., if
the amount of credits needed corresponds to fewer than 100 vehicles
scrapped) should be deleted. Many facilities could demonstrate
a need to scrap less than 100 vehicles. Approval on a hardship
situation on a case by case basis would place an unnecessary burden
on District staff.
<P>
Response #3-4 Staff is proposing to modify this provision of Rule
1610 to lower the minimum number of vehicles to 50. In addition,
an entity has the ability to obtain MSERCs from a licensed-scrapper
without having to perform the actual scrapping. Thus if an entity
needs less than 50 vehicles worth of MSERCs, that entity may be
able to obtain the needed credits. If a case by case determination
of hardship proves to be a burden on District staff resources,
then additional amendments to Rule 1610 may be proposed in the
future.
<P>
Comment #3-5 Language should be inserted in Rule 1610 that would
allow the Executive Officer or designee to grant approval to accept
a notice of less than two weeks. Additionally, a scrapper can
only provide notice on the estimated number of vehicle to be scrapped
since appointments are frequently canceled or missed.
<P>
Response #3-5 With regard to previous scrapping programs, the
two week notice has generally worked well based on input from
SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers and District enforcement personnel.
Therefore, no change in the two week notice language is proposed
with regard to exception to the two week time period. However,
a modification is being proposed to allow SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers
to provide an estimated number of vehicles to be scrapped.
<P>
Comment #3-6 The time period for destroying vehicle components
as required in Rule 1610 should be increased from 45 days to 90
days. The ARB guidelines allow 90 days.
<P>
Response #3-6 District staff is proposing to change the time period
allowed for destroying specified vehicle components (e.g., license
plate, vehicle identification number, cylinder block, and body/frame)
to 90 days.
<P>
Comment #3-7 The amendments to Rule 1610 should remove the requirement
for a current vehicle registration card as one required document
to prove District residence for the last two years. Current registration
is already confirmed via DMV record review. The owner should be
able to supply any one of the listed acceptable documents dated
within twelve months of vehicle delivery and another dated at
least two year prior to delivery.
<P>
Response #3-7 The vehicle registration card provides written proof
to the SCAQMD Licensed Scrapper that the vehicle is currently
registered to an address in the District. It should be noted that
not all SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers have direct access to vehicle
registration address information. Also, according to the Department
of Motor Vehicles (DMV), vehicle owners must carry the vehicle
registration card inside the vehicle.
<P>
Comment #3-8 &quot;Windows&quot; should be removed from the list
of vehicle components that must be present when the vehicle is
submitted for scrapping.
<P>
Response #3-8 District staff believes that &quot;windows&quot;
should remain on the list of components that must be present on
the vehicle when it is presented for scrapping. This requirement,
in combination with other Rule 1610 provisions, will help deter
the resurrection of non-operational vehicles for submission into
vehicle scrapping programs.
<P>
Comment #3-9 Rule 1610 needs to clearly state that MSERCs generated
under scrapping plans approved prior to October 13, 1995, can
be used to allow companies to continue delaying compliance with
any Regulation XI rules that had a compliance date subsequent
to the date of scrapping plan approval.
<P>
Response #3-9 This comment has been addressed in the proposed
amendments to Rule 1610 in paragraph (i)(3).
<P>
Comment #3-10 The reference in paragraph (j)(7), regarding data
records for each scrapped vehicle, should be (j)(5) rather than
(j)(4).
<P>
Response #3-10 District staff has modified the proposed amendments
to Rule 1610 to incorporate this comment.
<P>
Comment #3-11 <STRIKE>When presenting the vehicle for scrapping,
the owner should be allowed to provide</STRIKE> <I>The SCAQMD
Licensed Scrapper should be allowed to retain, for recordkeeping
purposes,</I> the DMV title or DMV application for duplicate title
<I>for each scrapped vehicle</I>.
<P>
Response #3-11 District staff has modified the proposed amendments
to Rule 1610 to incorporate this comment.
<P>
<I>Comment #3-12 Information requirements in the scrapping plan
should specify the &quot;&quot;anticipated initiation date&quot;
for the scrapping program, rather than the &quot;initiation date.&quot;</I>

<P>
<I>Response #3-12 Proposed Amended Rule 1612 has been modified
to address this comment.</I> 
<P>
<I>Comment #3-13 The District should allow MSERCs, where a use
has not been specifically designated in Proposed Amended Rule
1610, to be used as an alternative method of compliance with any
other District regulation that permits the use of MSERCs, with
the application of a discount factor of 1.2.</I> 
<P>
<I>Response #3-13 Proposed Amended Rule 1610 has been modified
to address this comment.</I> 
<P>
Comment #4-1 A scrapper and a dismantler can be one and the same
entity. This creates a problem with quantifying emission reductions,
because the dismantler can set aside a portion of the normal (baseline)
flow of old vehicles for the generation of MSERCs, thereby generating
credits for vehicles that would be scrapped regardless of Rule
1610. Therefore, the proposed amendments to Rule 1610 should include
a mechanism (i.e., a discount factor) that accounts for the difference
between the natural retirement old vehicles through attrition,
and the accelerated retirement of vehicle for the generation of
credits.
<P>
Response #4-1 The commentator is referred to the response to comment
#2-1. Also, it should be noted that Rule 1610 does contain a discount
factor, as well as vehicle eligibility requirements which only
allow the generation of MSERCs for vehicles that are operable
and intact.
<P>
Comment #4-2 The number of SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers is limited
under the current Rule 1610 to those stationary sources subject
to Regulation XI, Source Specific Standards. Allowing MSERCs generated
from old-vehicle scrappage programs to be used for compliance
with Regulation XV would increase the number of potential scrappers
from nine to several thousand if every Regulation XV facility
were licensed to conduct scrappage programs. The District should
ensure that adequate monitoring exists to guarantee that the anticipated
emission reductions from this program are actually achieved.
<P>
Response #4-2 The District has already taken the necessary measures
to ensure proper enforcement of Rule 1610. In past vehicle scrapping
programs, District personnel have inspected a significant number
of vehicles that have been submitted for scrapping, and have audited
hundreds of data records that have been submitted to the District
by licensed scrappers. The District will continue these enforcement
procedures subsequent to the adoption of Rule 1610 amendments.
With regard to the potential increase in the number of licensed
scrappers, initial input from the interested parties appears to
indicate that the number of licensed scrappers may increase to
about 30 from the nine currently licensed scrappers. For the most
part, these &quot;new&quot; licensed scrappers would be conducting
scrapping programs on behalf of companies interested in scrapping
vehicles for compliance with Regulation XV.
<P>
Comment #4-3 The Preliminary Draft Staff Report does not provide
estimates for the number of additional facilities or the projected
increase in the number of vehicles to be scrapped for MSERCs that
will participate in vehicle scrapping programs as a result of
the proposed amendments to Rule 1610. Because this information
is absent, it is difficult to determine the potential impact of
in-migration of vehicles into the District for scrappage. Although
the program would require vehicles to be registered within the
District for two years prior to scrapping them for credits, the
incentive to import and stockpile them for two years would still
exist. The District could eliminate this incentive by requiring
proof of insurance for the two years prior to scrapping. This
requirement would also provide additional assurance that the vehicle
was operational for the previous two years, since there is minimal
incentive to insure a vehicle that is not driven.
<P>
Response #4-3 Since Rule 1610 is a market-based rule, projections
of the number of additional facilities or vehicles that will participate
in old vehicle scrapping programs are speculative. Input from
Regulation XV companies indicates that some companies will participate
in vehicle scrapping programs due to lower costs of compliance,
while other companies may not participate because their rideshare
programs are construed (by their employees) to be a permanent
employee benefit. When Rule 1610 was originally adopted, a requirement
to provide proof of insurance was included. The provision was
subsequently removed because it was an unnecessary hindrance to
the scrappage program. With regard to the potential stockpiling
of out-of-state vehicles for scrapping, the District believes
that the rule adequately deters this activity because of the two
year continuous registration requirement. The District will continue
to monitor the types of vehicles being submitted in the scrappage
programs, and determine if such activities are actually occurring.
<P>
Comment #4-4 The District should address the potential for in-migration
of old vehicles to supply affordable transportation within the
District, in addition to vehicle in-migration to supply old-vehicle
scrappage for MSERCs. As increasing numbers of vehicles are retired
through the scrappage program, the demand for older vehicles will
increase to meet the local need for affordable transportation.
<P>
Response #4-4 The District believes that this issue is more relevant
with regard to the implementation of State Implementation Plan
(SIP) measure M-1, which calls for a program to retire 75,000
vehicles per year in the South Coast Air Basin from 1999 through
2010, with a smaller number of vehicles to be retired annually
between 1996 and 1998. The estimated number of 75,000 vehicles
per year is significantly larger than the 5,999 vehicles scrapped
over the last two and a half years under Rule 1610. ARB plans
to study this issue as part of its implementation of SIP Measure
M-1. Staff will forward the comment to ARB for their consideration
in developing SIP Measure M-1.
<P>
Comment #4-5 The District should revisit the assumption that a
vehicle scrapped under Rule 1610 has a remaining useful life of
three years, given the minimal functional requirements that an
old vehicle must demonstrate to qualify for scrappage.
<P>
Response #4-5 The useful life assumption is derived from the ARB
Mobile Source Emission Reduction Credit Guidelines, which provide
guidance to air quality districts regarding the design of emission
reduction credit rules. We will recommend that ARB reevaluate
the useful remaining life assumption as part of their implementation
of SIP measure M-1. Any changes that ARB recommends in the useful
remaining life assumptions will be evaluated for incorporation
in Rule 1610.
<P>
Comment #4-6 Retroactive credit for CO and PM for previously generated
MSERCs would compromise the emission benefits of the scrappage
program, particularly if a 1.0 discount factor is used (i.e.,
for Regulation XV compliance) and would be inconsistent with the
policies of Rules 1612 and 1620.
<P>
Response #4-6 Staff believes that allowing retroactive credits
for CO and PM for previously generated MSERCs will not compromise
emission benefits of the scrappage program. Existing CO MSERCs
generated under Rule 1610 are surplus credits which the facility
does not need to comply with Regulation XI rules. Allowing companies
to use existing credits for Regulation XV purposes would provide
a greater source of credits and provide greater flexibility for
Regulation XV companies to meet their emission reduction targets.
<P>
Comment #5-1 In the interest of possibly scrapping vehicles for
Rule 1501.1 compliance, what is the cost of implementing an old
vehicle scrapping program?
<P>
Response #5-1 Rule 1610 is a market-driven rule, where the incentive
provided to the vehicle owner to obtain the old vehicle for scrapping
is determined by the SCAQMD Licensed Scrapper. Past market incentives
have been mostly in the range of $600 to $700 per vehicle. Administrative
costs are estimated to be $100 per vehicle. Scrapping Plan fees
are $1,000 and semiannual Compliance Plan fees typically range
from $800 to $1,200 depending on the number of vehicles scrapped.
<P>
Comment #5-2 Will the potential cost of vehicle scrapping be put
together in future workshops?
<P>
Response #5-2 A Rule 1610 status report, detailing vehicle scrapping
implementation costs, is available. It was presented to the Governing
Board in May 1995.
<P>
Comment #5-3 What is the mechanism by which the public is notified
about vehicle scrapping programs?
<P>
Response #5-3 Public notification of vehicle scrapping programs
is left to the SCAQMD Licensed Scrapper. In the past, print media
and radio advertising have been utilized.
<P>
Comment #5-4 Will there be an increase in credits issued for efforts
to pre-screen vehicles to identify the grossest polluting vehicles
for scrapping?
<P>
Response #5-4 Rule 1610 is based on average emissions from pre-1982
vehicles and the &quot;emissions from an average vehicle&quot;
as being a replacement vehicle. The reason for this approach is
that, in pre-screening vehicles, there is an incentive to tamper
with vehicle to obtain greater credit. The calculation methodology
employed in the rule is based on emission factors from ARB's emission
inventory model. Nearly all of the vehicles scrapped are among
the grossest emitters in the in-use vehicle fleet, because they
are non-catalyst vehicles or, if they have an emission control
system, it is usually in a very deteriorated state.
<P>
<I>Comment #5a-1 The proposed amendments to Rule 1610 creates
a loophole with regard to the banking of MSERCs, since an entity
scrapping vehicles may not wish to report this activity until
they decide that the credits are needed.</I> 
<P>
<I>Response #5a-1 Proposed Amended Rule 1610 requires that all
vehicle scrapping activity be reported every six months. If any
vehicle scrapping activity goes unreported, then MSERCs will not
be generated for those vehicles.</I> 
<P>
<I>Comment #5b-1 Why have the scrapping plan requirements changed
in terms of specifying the use of the credits and the ending date?</I>

<P>
<I>Response #5b-1 The changes in the scrapping plan requirements
were made for consistency with recently adopted Rule 1612 and
1620. These rules have procedures to generate credits without
having to specify their use for a specific rule. When the person
who needs the MSERCs submits a compliance plan, the Regulation
XI, XIII, or XV rule for which those credits will be used, are
specified at that time. This allows entities to generate MSERCs
without having to specify a specific rule for which those credits
will be used. The ending date is proposed to be deleted from the
scrapping plan because future scrapping programs will most likely
be on-going programs for the purpose of generating MSERCs for
Rule 1501.1 compliance.</I> 
<P>
<I>Comment #5b-2 The program should be amended to use measured
emissions in calculating credits. Regarding paragraph (f)(1),
the rule should be amended to scrap gross emitters regardless
of model year. BAR, as part of the new I/M program, will be identifying
gross emitters through various means including remote sensing
devices, loaded mode dynamometer testing, and high emitter profiles.</I>

<P>
<I>Response #5b-2 Allowing additional MSERCs for higher polluting
vehicles provides an incentive for vehicle owners to slightly
(and very easily) modify their vehicle for higher emissions. This
is one of the reasons why model year groupings are used as part
of the vehicle eligibility criteria, in order to determine when
a vehicle qualifies for MSERCs. The District will be following
this issue as the ARB conducts its evaluation of Measure M-1 in
the State Implementation Plan.</I> 
<P>
<I>Comment #5b-3 Regarding subparagraph (e)(1)(C), the rule should
allow the recycling of the engine block and frame, as established
in vehicle codes 5050 and 5051, California Air Resources Board
Resolution 93-9, and Senate Bill 501 recently passed by both the
California Assembly and Senate in Sacramento. Accommodating the
legitimate interests of vehicle collectors and SEMA members will
not have any measurable impact on air quality since such vehicles
are better maintained and driven much fewer miles.</I> 
<P>
<I>Response #5b-3 The requirement that the body/frame and the
engine block be destroyed is to provide additional assurance that
the scrapped vehicle will not be resurrected. Every other part
on the scrapped vehicle may be reused. It should be noted that
the District has not received any data from the public indicating
that the price and/or availability of parts for collector cars
is being impacted by Rule 1610 vehicle scrapping programs. This
is most likely due to the small number of old vehicles scrapped
as a result of Rule 1610. Also, the District believes that the
interests of vehicle collectors, in terms of parts availability,
are being served through the implementation of the Code of Conduct
for SCAQMD Licensed Scrappers, which was adopted as a voluntary
part of the Scrapping Plan, during the February 1994 amendments
to Rule 1610. As a result of this Code of Conduct, 109 <U>complete</U>
vehicles, identified by automobile hobbyists, were saved from
scrapping, The District has received positive public input in
response to the Code of Conduct. </I>
<P>
<I>Comment #5b-4 The three year credit life should be maintained.
It corresponds to the length of time that the vehicle would have
been operating in the absence of scrapping.</I> 
<P>
<I>Response #5b-4 The five year credit life is part of the proposed
amendments to Rule 1610, for consistency with recently adopted
Rule 1501.1. It should be noted that the amount of MSERCs issued
will still be based on the assumed three years remaining life
of the scrapped vehicle.</I> 
<P>
Comment #6-1 Credit fungibility should be increased, especially
when a single company generates credits for more than one use,
such as Rules 1142 and 1501.1. In situations where projected MSERC
needs are highly uncertain, the credits should be allowed to be
kept &quot;undesignated&quot; until such time when they could
be designated with a little more certainty.
<P>
Response #6-1 The commentator is referred to the response to comment
#3-1.
<P>
Comment #6-2 Existing MSERCs are issued annually for three years
and must be used in the year issued. Under the proposed amendments
to Rule 1610, new MSERCs are issued immediately and can be used
over a five year period. Old credits should be directly convertible
to new credits, except that credits which have expired should
not be resurrected.
<P>
Response #6-2 The commentator is referred to the response to comment
#1-2.
<P>
<I>Comment #6-3 Regarding nonrevivable junk slips, last year a
bill passed that instituted a &quot;nonrepairable vehicle&quot;
designation. It's virtually the same as a nonrevivable junk slip
that is normally used by law enforcement. This would allow a little
more flexibility as to how to dispose of a vehicle once they are
to be retired.</I> 
<P>
<I>Response #6-3 Since DMV has not implemented the nonrepairable
vehicle designation, it is not completely clear whether this designation
will be equivalent to the nonrevivable junk slip designation.
District staff will be following this issue to determine what
effect it may have on future rule amendments.</I> 
<P>
<I>Comment #7-1 EPA recommends adding two definitions to subdivision
(b)(: (1) auto dismantlers, and (2) functional inspections. In
subdivision (b), the proposal states that SCAQMD licensed scrappers
shall have vehicles scrapped only by auto dismantlers licensed
by the California DMV. Because there are several hundred auto
dismantlers licensed in the State, licensed not with the concept
to scrap old vehicles permanently, but rather to recycle as many
parts as possible, clear definition is recommended to guarantee
proper vehicle disposal. Functional inspection definition is also
recommended to add to subdivision (b) definitions because there
is no distinct clarification of what that implies.</I> 
<P>
<I>Response #7-1 District staff does not believe it is necessary
to define DMV licensed auto dismantler. The identification of
an auto dismantler as DMV licensed has not been a problem in the
course of implementing Rule 1610. District staff does not believe
that &quot;functional inspection&quot; needs to be defined since
paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) detail functional inspection requirements.</I>

<P>
<I>Comment #7-2 Subdivision (g) Vehicle Visual and Functional
Inspection lays out criteria scrapped vehicles need to meet to
pass the visual and functional inspection. It is not clear what
the functional tests are. Whether it is when the vehicle owner
is starting, restarting the engine, or a District authorized person
performing other tests to establish operability.</I> 
<P>
<I>Response #7-2 The District is not concerned about who actually
starts or restarts the engine, provided that the SCAQMD Licensed
Scrapper observes these functional tests, and then disqualifies
those vehicles that fail them.</I> 
<P>
<I>Comment #7-3 Paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(3), Vehicle Disposal
Requirements, is not clear when referring to activities associated
with scrapping vehicles, particularly vehicle components. Does
this include vehicle exhaust emission components? If so, what
pre-1981 exhaust emission components are subject to the rule:</I>

<P>
<I>Response #7-3 Paragraph (e)(1) and (e)(2) clearly states that
the vehicle identification number, license plates, cylinder block,
and body/frame be destroyed with 90 days subsequent to scrapping.
Exhaust emission components are not mentioned.</I> 
<P>
<I>Comment #7-4 Paragraph (h)(1) references a discount factor
which is used in the calculation of mobile source emission reduction
credits (MSERCs) and includes the statement &quot;...except that
the Discount factor shall be 1.0 for compliance with Rule 1501.1
or Rule 1303.&quot; This language is inconsistent with District
staff's statement in the staff report for proposed Rule 1612 that
&quot;Application of the discount factor helps account for the
uncertainties associated with trading emission reduction credits
from mobile to stationary sources.&quot; Given that the use of
MSERCs for new source review (NSR) offsets is mobile to stationary
source trading, the 1.2 discount factor as well as the applicable
offset ratios (considering NSR offset aggregate demonstrations)
should be applied in the instance where any 1600 series rule-generated
MSERC is used to meet NSR offset requirements.</I> 
<P>
<I>Response #7-4 Regulation XIII, which contains the NSR requirements,
already requires a 1.2 offset ratio upon the use of the credit.
Therefore, applying an additional 1.2 offset ratio (or discount
factor) in Rule 1610 is unnecessary and would result in double
discounting of the emission reductions generated from vehicle
scrapping, when the credit is used for NSR offsets. In addition,
this issue will be revisited during the inter-credit trading study.</I>

<P>
<I>Comment #7-5 Subparagraph (f)(4)(B) includes a statement about
&quot;equivalent documentation as determined by the Executive
Officer or designee&quot; to demonstrate two years of vehicle
ownership. EPA recommends rewording this provision so that the
equivalent documentation is specified. </I>
<P>
<I>Response #7-5 The District included the &quot;equivalent documentation&quot;
provision to provide flexibility with regard to how address history
could be verified, for vehicles with more than one owner during
the two year period prior to scrapping. More than likely, this
equivalent document will have to originate from DMV; however,
the District would like to remain flexible with regard to what
qualifies as &quot;equivalent documentation.&quot;</I> 
<P>
<I>Comment #7-6 Paragraph (j)(6) specifies that records are to
be kept for at least one year. EPA suggests that this provision
be changed to require records be kept for the term of the credits.</I>

<P>
<I>Response #7-6 The commentator is referred to the response to
comment 1a-5.</I> 
<P>
<I>Comment #7-7 The District has essentially provided no technical
justification for the extension of the credit term beyond three
years. The rationale provided in the staff report is inadequate.</I>

<P>
<I>Response #7-7 The District is proposing a five year credit
life to be as flexible as reasonably possible regarding the use
of the credits, and provide consistency with recently adopted
Rule 1501.1. Both Proposed Amended Rule 1610 and Rule 1501.1 are
based on the precedent set at the Bay Area Air Quality Management
District, which also provided a five year life for vehicle scrapping
credits. With regard to technical justification, an analysis performed
by ARB focusing on California Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV)
data led to the conclusion that the average remaining life of
vehicles 15 years or older is 5 to 6 years. This is stated in
ARB's Proposed Principles for Old Vehicle Buy-Back Programs, dated
March 1991, and repeated in their February 1994 guidance document
entitled &quot;Guidelines for the Generation and Use of Mobile
Source Emission Credit.&quot; To put this in the proper context,
the ARB recommends, and the District concurs, that the valuation
of credits should be based on an assumed three years useful remaining
life of the vehicle, since more than likely old vehicle buy-back
programs will not attract the &quot;average&quot; old vehicle.
Nevertheless, in the interest of providing maximum flexibility
regarding the use of the credits, and the previous analyses of
DMV data performed by ARB regarding the useful remaining life
of older vehicles, the District believes it is reasonable to provide
for a five year credit life.</I> 
<P>
<B>VII.</B> <B>SUMMARY AND DRAFT FINDINGS</B> 
<P>
<B>Summary</B> 
<P>
Proposed Amended Rule 1610 is part of the District's strategy
to attain federal and state ambient air quality standards. Long-term
air quality benefits are expected by attaining and maintaining
the ambient air quality standards for ozone. Improved air quality
will ultimately reduce negative public health impacts from this
criteria pollutant.
<P>
Proposed Amended Rule 1610 is technologically feasible and cost-effective,
while reducing VOC, NOx, CO and PM, and the rule addresses concerns
raised by the public, wherever possible. Therefore, staff recommends
the adoption of Proposed Amended Rule 1610.
<P>
These findings are being made in compliance with state law requirements.
<P>
<B>DRAFT FINDINGS REQUIRED BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY
CODE</B> 
<P>
Health and Safety Code Section 40727 requires the District to
adopt written findings of necessity, authority, clarity, consistency,
non-duplication and reference.
<P>
<B>Necessity</B> - As set forth in the adopted Air Quality Management
Plan (AQMP), the emission reductions associated with Proposed
Amended Rule 1610 are needed for the following reasons:
<P>
a) State and federal health-based ambient air quality standards
for ozone are regularly and significantly violated in the South
Coast Air Basin. The extensive reduction of VOC and NOx emissions
(precursors to ozone formation) and CO, including the reductions
from Proposed Amended Rule 1610, is needed to meet federal and
state air quality standards.
<P>
b) By exceeding state and federal air quality standards, the health
of people within the South Coast Air Basin is impaired.
<P>
c) By exceeding state and federal air quality standards, the quality
of life is reduced in the South Coast Air Basin in numerous respects.
<P>
d) The &quot;California Clean Air Act&quot; (CH&amp;SC Section
40910 et seq.) requires that the District make every effort to
attain federal and state ambient air quality standards as soon
as practicable. Proposed Amended Rule 1610 makes progress toward
that goal.
<P>
e) Proposed Amended Rule 1610 is intended to provide an alternative
means of compliance with District regulations.
<P>
<B>Authority</B> - The District Board obtains its authority to
adopt, amend, or repeal rules and regulation from Health &amp;
Safety Code Sections 40000, 40001, 40440, 40441, 40463, 40702,
40725 through 40728, and 40910 through 40920.
<P>
<B>Clarity</B> - The District Board determines that Proposed Amended
Rule 1610 is written or displayed so that its meaning can be easily
understood by persons directly affected by it.
<P>
<B>Consistency</B> - The District Board determines that Proposed
Amended Rule 1610 is in harmony with, and not in conflict with
or contradictory to, existing federal or state statutes, court
decisions, or regulations.
<P>
<B>Non-Duplication</B> - Proposed Amended Rule 1610 does not impose
the same requirements as any existing state of federal regulation
and are necessary and proper to execute the powers and duties
granted to, and imposed upon, the District.
<P>
<B>Reference</B> - In adopting this Proposed Amended Rule, the
Board references the following statutes which the District hereby
implements, interprets or makes specific: H&amp;S Code Sections
40001 (rules to achieve ambient air quality standards), and 40440(a)
(rules to carry out AQMP).
<P>
<B>ATTACHMENT D</B> 
<P>
<B>FINAL ADDENDUM TO THE<BR>
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS FOR RULE 1610</B> 
<P>
Attachment D is provided to the Board and requesters only at this
time due to the bulk of material. The previously certified Final
EA and the Addendum are available to other members of the public
at the AQMD Public Information Center.

<FONT SIZE=5></H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
District Rule 301 - Permit Fees establishes all fees associated
with permits included in permit processing fees, annual permit
renewal fees, and emission fees. All permit holders are required
to pay permit processing fees for new permits, and annual renewal
fees; while facilities whose actual emissions exceed four tons
per year pay emission fees.
<P>
<U>HELP Program</U> 
<P>
Item IV of the Business Clean Air Partnership Plan (BCAP) establishes
a &quot;High Employment, Low Pollution&quot; (HELP) program with
incentives to attract new high employment, low pollution manufacturers
to the South Coast Air Basin (Basin). As part of the implementation
of Item IV, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD)
has committed to waive annual operating permit renewal fees for
two years for new manufacturing facilities which create 500 or
more jobs and produce half the emissions per employee for that
industry projected for the year 2010 by the Air Quality Management
Plan.
<P>
Accordingly, staff proposes an amendment to Rule 301 to initiate
BCAP, Item IV, implementation. Subdivision (m), Fee Waiver, is
being proposed for addition to Rule 301 to waive annual operating
permit renewal fees for qualified high employment, low pollution
manufacturers for two years.
<P>
California Health and Safety Code Section 40500 <I>et seq</I>.
establishes AQMD's authority to adopt rules and regulations, including
fee schedules to cover the actual cost of air quality programs
designed to attain and maintain clean air. This amendment provides
incentives to attract new &quot;super clean&quot; manufacturers
to the Basin and lowers the annual fees for new facilities generating
low levels of air pollution. As the actual cost of regulating
these &quot;super-clean&quot; facilities will generally be less
due to their lower levels of emissions, AQMD will be able to direct
its resources towards reducing emissions at facilities with higher
levels of emissions. As the region progresses towards clean air,
it is appropriate to adjust fees to reflect significant advances
in reducing emissions.
<P>
<U>Rule 1136 Compliance Incentive</U> 
<P>
At the August 11, 1995 Board meeting, your Board directed staff
to return with proposals to provide incentives for facilities
to use waterborne coatings in compliance with Rule 1136 - Wood
Products Coatings. Accordingly, staff proposes an additional amendment
to Rule 301 that will reduce the annual operating fees by 25 percent
for one year for equipment that achieves early compliance with
the final Volatile Organic Compound coating limits of Rule 1136.
These limits become effective July 1, 1996. The amendment recognizes
that the cost of enforcing Rule 1136 is less for facilities that
certify that they are in compliance, and that AQMD may appropriately
devote fewer resources to such facilities. The amendment will
still provide adequate revenues to support the AQMD.
<P>
<U>California Environmental Quality Act</U> 
<P>
As part of its preliminary review, AQMD, as lead agency in accordance
with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), has reviewed
proposed amended Rule 301 pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section
15061 - Review for Exemption. AQMD staff has concluded from the
review for exemption process that proposed amended Rule 301 is
statutorily exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section
15273 - Rates, Tolls, Fares and Charges. The Notice of Exemption
for the proposed project has been prepared in accordance with
CEQA Guidelines Section 15062 - Notice of Exemption. The Notice
of Exemption will be filed with the county clerks of Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties immediately following
approval of the project.
<P>
<U>Conclusions</U> 
<P>
Due to the administrative nature of these amendments and the certainty
that these changes will not significantly affect air quality or
emission limitations, no public workshops have been conducted.
In addition, no socioeconomic assessment is required pursuant
to Health &amp; Safety Code Section 40440.8 because the proposed
amendment will not significantly affect air quality or emissions
limitations. Further this board letter will serve as the staff
report.
<P>
After adoption of these amendments, staff will conduct an outreach
program to inform potentially eligible facilities about the fee
waiver. General circulation publications and targeted mailings
will be used to advertise these waivers.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
-- Certify the Notice of Exemption for Proposed Amended Rule 301
- Permit Fees, in accordance with the attached Resolution; and
<P>
-- Amend Rule 301 - Permit Fees, as set forth in the attached
documents.

<H3><CENTER> Amend Rule 310 -- Amnesty for Unpermitted Equipment
<BR>
<I>(Continued from the September 8, 1995 Board Meeting)</I> <FONT SIZE=5>
</H3>

<H3></FONT></H3>
<HR>

<P>
</CENTER><U> INTRODUCTION</U>
<P>
At the September 8, 1995, Board Meeting, the Board adopted Rule
310 -- Amnesty for Unpermitted Equipment. Rule 310 established
a 6-month amnesty period during which facilities that voluntarily
apply for permits for existing equipment will not be subject to
late fees, civil or criminal penalties for not having the required
permit. Facilities with reported emissions of 10 tons/yr. or more
are not eligible for the amnesty under the current rule language.
These facilities account for less than 1,000 of the total of 35,000
facilities in the AQMD permit system.
<P>
At the time the rule was adopted, the Board directed staff to
develop additional language that could be used to allow 10-ton
facilities to be eligible for the amnesty for relatively small
pieces of equipment.
<P>
<U>BACKGROUND</U> 
<P>
Staff investigated several options, and found that the most practical
method would be to use the fee schedules in the Permit Fee Rule
(Rule 301) to define the types of equipment that would be eligible
for amnesty at the facilities with reported emissions of 10 tons/yr.
or more. Those fee schedules are based on the emissions potential
of the equipment and the complexity of engineering review needed
to issue the permit.
<P>
The lowest three categories (Schedules A, A1, and B) of the total
of 11 categories provide a wide range of relatively low-emitting
equipment. Those three categories list 181 types of equipment
including portable generators, portable compressors, cogeneration
engines, small boilers, degreasers, abrasive blasting cabinets,
spray equipment, spray booths, and small printing presses. These
are the kinds of equipment that earlier commentors had indicated
might be unpermitted at their facilities.
<P>
<U>PROPOSED AMENDMENT</U> 
<P>
The proposed amendment to Rule 310 would extend amnesty to facilities
that reported 10 tons or more of emissions in 1993 for any equipment
identified on Schedules A, A1, and B, in Table I of the Permit
Fee Rule (Rule 301).
<P>
SCAQMD Board -2- October 13, 1995
<P>
<U>CEQA &amp; SOCIOECONOMIC ANALYSIS</U> 
<P>
AQMD staff has reviewed the proposed amendment to Rule 310 and
has determined that it is exempt from the requirements of the
California Environmental Quality Act pursuant to the State CEQA
Guidelines Section 15061 (b)(3), in that staff has determined
with certainty that there is no possibility that proposed Rule
310 may have a significant effect on the environment. In addition,
CEQA Guidelines Section 15321 is applicable in that the purpose
of proposed Rule 310 is to assist the District in enforcing its
requirements that sources be permitted by the District.
<P>
The proposed amendment to Rule 310 may result in savings to affected
facilities from not having to pay penalties or late permit processing
fees. The proposed rule is not expected to result in any additional
costs to facilities participating in the amnesty program and is
not expected to have any adverse socioeconomic impacts.
<P>
<U>AQMP &amp; LEGAL MANDATES</U> 
<P>
On October 14, 1994, the Governing Board adopted a resolution
that requires staff to address whether proposed rules being considered
for adoption are being presented in rank order by cost-effectiveness
as defined in the 1994 AQMP. The proposed amendment to Rule 310
is not a control measure in the 1994 AQMP. However, the rule is
cost effective because it lowers the costs to industry to permit
their equipment.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
-- Amend Rule 310 -- Amnesty for Unpermitted Equipment.

Respectfully,

<P>
<B>October 4, 1995</B> 
<P>
The following organizations have indicated that the equipment
in Schedules A and B of the fee rule address most of the relatively
small equipment that might be unpermitted at the facilities they
represent. They have indicated general support for the proposal,
though they may have provided additional comments or concerns
which are addressed later in this document.

The following additional comments were submitted:
<OL>
<LI>Comment: All facilities, including those with 10 tons per
year or more of emissions, should be allowed to participate fully
in the amnesty without restriction on the size of the equipment.
<I>Submitted by Detrich Allen, City of Los Angeles</I> 
</OL>

<P>
Response: The Board considered this comment when voting on the
original rule and the proposal did not pass. As a result, staff
were asked to provide alternative language that would allow 10
ton facilities to participate in the amnesty at least for their
low-emitting equipment.
<OL>
<LI>Comment: AQMD must address how equipment under the amnesty
program will deal with New Source Review. Many older units cannot
comply with current BACT requirements. <I>Submitted by Greg Adams,
Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County.</I> 
</OL>

<P>
Response: State, federal, and AQMD rules require meeting all New
Source Review requirements for equipment that was installed without
the required permit to construct. The amnesty rule cannot relax
these requirements.
<OL>
<LI>Comment: AQMD should use the maximum emission levels specified
for the Community Bank in Rule 1309.1 as the cutoff point for
amnesty for major facilities. These are 30 lb/day for ROG and
PM10, 40lb/day for NOx, 60 lb/day for SOx, and 400 lb/day of CO.
<I>Submitted by Millie Yamada, California Aerospace Environmental
Association.</I> 
</OL>

<P>
Response: Two organizations suggested using the maximum emission
levels, specified for the Community Bank (Rule 1309.1) as the
thresholds for amnesty. However, one of those organizations changed
its mind when it learned those levels would be considerably more
restrictive than the AQMD's proposal of using Schedules A, A1,
and B.
<P>
The Community Bank levels are more restrictive because they are
based on the &quot;potential to emit&quot; rather than actual
operation. For example, a small portable generator would have
to be evaluated as if it were operating 24 hours per day, whether
or not it actually does. Because of this, even a relatively small
generator would exceed the emission levels listed for the Community
Bank and would, therefore, not be eligible for amnesty.
<P>
Another problem with setting a specific emissions threshold is
that the amount of emissions is not typically provided on the
application form. The applicant usually provides basic information
about the equipment (horsepower, fuel type, VOC content of coatings,
amount of coatings used, etc.) that the review engineer later
uses to calculate emissions. In other words, the AQMD would have
to conduct a detailed engineering review just to determine if
an application is eligible for amnesty. Using Schedules A, A1,
and B, staff and the customer can easily determine if the equipment
is eligible for amnesty.
<OL>
<LI>Comment: Schedules A and B do not seem to address the small
pieces of equipment at a refinery that might have been missed
on existing permits. Small pieces of equipment in a refinery are
not permitted separately, but are aggregated into permits for
larger process units. Example: If one pump was missed on a permit
for a refinery's &quot;crude oil distillation unit&quot;, adding
that pump to the permit would come under Schedule E of the permit
fee rule because that is where the distillation unit and its related
equipment (including pumps) is described. Even though that one
pump may be a very small source of VOC emissions, it would not
be listed separately in Schedules A or B. It is merged into the
equipment included in the much larger distillation unit. The amnesty
provisions need to be related to the amount of mass emissions
from the equipment. Schedules A and B are related primarily to
the estimated level of staff effort required to prepare a permit.

<P>
Response: Taking the last statement first, the schedules used
in the AQMD's Permit Fee Rule (Rule 301) are not just based on
complexity of review. The schedules are based both on &quot;the
emissions potential of the equipment&quot; <U>and</U> the complexity
of review. So, schedules A, A1, and B actually do reflect the
relatively low-emitting equipment even if there are no specific
emission thresholds listed. Specific emission thresholds, as discussed
in the previous comment, do not lend themselves to the kind of
quick screening process needed to determine if equipment is eligible
for amnesty.
<P>
In addition, for most of the large facility permits issued since
RECLAIM was adopted, the equipment descriptions no longer include
a detailed listing of every pump and valve that is part of a larger
unit. The AQMD has been moving toward eliminating this level of
detail from all large facility permits so that permit revisions
would not be needed every time a pump or valve is changed on equipment
such as the crude oil distillation unit in the example. To that
end, there would be no need to include this scenario in the amnesty
program.
<P>
We do, however, recognize that some refineries still have the
more detailed permits, and that some have requested that we return
to putting detailed equipment descriptions in their permits. That
issue is presently under consideration and the AQMD is evaluating
alternatives to determine whether or not, and to what extent,
to list such equipment in the facility permits for refineries.
<P>
If the AQMD decides to totally eliminate the detailed listings
of things like pumps, amnesty will not be required for the situation
described in the comment. However, if the AQMD does decide to
include detailed listings of such equipment, all the companies
will be invited to provide us with updated inventories of all
those small components which we will incorporate into the permits
at no expense to the companies. In the interim, no notices of
violation are being issued for discrepancies in equipment descriptions
involving small component parts like pumps and valves which do
not cause an increase in direct emissions from the major equipment
of which they are a part.
<P>
In summary, refineries would not need amnesty for the situation
described in the commentor's example, and they would be eligible
for amnesty for any of the 181 types of relatively low-emitting
equipment listed in schedules A, A1, and B.

(Liu) (909) 396-2105
<P>
<I>The trends of ozone air quality in the SCAB have demonstrated
a pattern of steady, continuous improvement since the 1980s. Gains
in reducing exposure to unhealthful levels of ozone have been
realized in both the duration of exposure and the numbers and
size of the areas impacted by higher concentrations. A short presentation
will be made to highlight the ongoing trends of basin ozone air
quality, including a preliminary analysis of 1995 data. The presentation
will provide an analysis of the impacts of seasonal weather on
air quality and also include a brief discussion of the ambient
trends of ozone precursors in relation to estimated emissions.
In addition, an assessment of the impact of changing the federal
1-hour averaged ozone standard to an 8-hour averaged standard
will be presented.</I>

<I>The Coachella Valley region of the District has been designated
as a serious non-attainment area for PM</I>10 <I>. The ambient
profile of PM</I>10 <I> in this area is dominated by desert dust
in the coarse fraction and by secondary and combustion-source
particles transported from the Los Angeles basin in the fine fraction.
Thus, it becomes questionable to use results from other parts
of the United States that have a significantly different PM</I>10
<I> profile to develop control strategies. The proposed population-based
health study will determine whether the coarse particles from
natural desert dust are as toxic as fine particles. Staff recommends
funding this study in an amount not to exceed $204,136. This item

<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:alloyd@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
(alloyd@aqmd.gov )<BR>
<I>At its April 1995 meeting, the Board approved the release of
an RFP regarding Airport Ground Service Equipment (GSE) Electrification.
Four proposals were submitted ranging from the proposed purchase
of commercially available equipment to the development of advanced
fuel cell technologies. However, due to the broad nature of this
RFP, staff was unable to evaluate the proposals received on an
equivalent basis. For this reason, staff recommends that no award
be made under the previous RFP and instead, a new RFP for Airport
GSE Electrification be released, with a narrowed scope focused
on the development and demonstration of advanced technologies.
The total amount allocated for this RFP is $500,000. This item
was reviewed and approved by the Technology Committee on September
13, 1995.</I>

(alloyd@aqmd.gov )<BR>
<I>The 1994 AQMP calls for the use of alternative fuels and advanced
technology to help achieve air quality standards. The AQMD has
received a proposal from the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution
Control District to develop and demonstrate a propane-fueled hybrid-electric
refuse truck. The proposed system will use an electric drive and
battery pack with a low-emission propane engine and alternator
to extend truck range. Its advantages are reduced emissions, energy
costs, maintenance, truck noise and visible smoke. Staff recommends
that the AQMD fund this $880,000 project in an amount not to exceed
$250,000. Cost sharing of $630,000 has been committed by eight
parties, including the ARB. This item was reviewed and approved
by the Technology Committee on September 13, 1995.</I>

<P>
<I>At its February 1994 meeting, the Board approved cosponsorship
of the second year of a multi-year project to demonstrate a novel
low-NOx internal combustion engine. To date, Southwest Research
Institute (SwRI) has made good progress and developed a low-NOx
hybrid rich-burn/ lean-burn engine. Staff recommends cosponsorship
of the final phase of this project, the field demonstration of
the developed engine in the SCAB. It is recommended that the contract
with SwRI be amended for an amount not to exceed $181,627. Southern
California Gas is cosponsoring this project for an equal amount.

<P>
<I>Proposed amendments for Rule 431.1 include an extension of
the compliance date for the <BR>
40 ppm sulfur compound limit for landfill gas and a daily average
interim sulfur compound limit of 150 ppm for landfill gas; clarification
of sulfur compound limits for small refineries; and exemption
to allow non-RECLAIM SOx facilities to burn, purchase from, or
sell to RECLAIM SOx facilities gaseous fuels with sulfur compounds
in excess of applicable limits; increased flexibility to use monthly
averaging or compliance for a facility or the aggregate and rule
language cleanup.&quot;</I>

(909) 396-2105</B> 
<P>
<I>Proposed amendments have been developed to improve consistency
between Rule 1610 and other recently-adopted AQMD regulations.
Specifically, the proposed amendments will extend the life of
Rule 1610 MSERCs from 3 to 5 years and allow for the generation
of CO MSERCs to be consistent with Rule 1501.1. In addition, amendments
to definitions and increased flexibility in the use of Rule 1610
MSERCs are proposed.</I>

<I>The proposed amendments launch two programs to provide incentives
to low-emission facilities in the form of reduced annual operating
permit renewal fees: (1) new high employment, low pollution (HELP)
manufacturers that create more than 500 jobs, while producing
half the emissions per employee identified in the AQMP for the
Year 2010 goal for that industry, will be eligible for an annual
operating permit renewal fee waiver for two years; (2) wood product
coaters that achieve early compliance with Rule 1136 will get
a 25 percent reduction in annual operating permit renewal fees

60A Amend Regulation XIII - New Source Review and Rule 212 - Standards
for Approving Permits (Leyden) (909) 396-3120
<P>
<I>The proposed amendments to Regulation XIII will address state
and federal NSR regulatory requirements. This proposal will replace
the Community Bank with a four tons per year exemption level;
adjust the Priority Reserve; define the equivalency demonstration
process; narrow exemptions; streamline trading zones; forgive
positive NSR balances for offset purposes; and exempt emission
increases resulting from the transition out of ozone-depleting
compounds. The proposed amendments will also address internal
combustion engines to be consistent with EPA's national requirements.</I>

<P>
60D Amend Rule 102 - Definition of Terms (Leyden)
<P>
<I>The proposed amendment will add four new materials to the Exempt
Compound definition: acetone, ethane, volatile methylated siloxanes,
and parachlorobenzotrifluoride. Definitions for Executive Officer
and PM10 will also be added, and the chemical names of materials
listed under Exempt Compounds will be standardized.</I> 
<P>
<U>December 8, 1995:</U> 
<P>
-- Amend Rule 430 - Breakdown Provisions (Lockie)
<P>
<I>The proposed amendment will change the existing rule by introducing
language eliminating permit condition violations that occur as
a direct result of a valid breakdown. Additionally, administrative
language changes will make the rule consistent with current AQMD
policies, and eliminate vague and ambiguous wording.</I> 
<P>
-- Amend Rule 1134 - Emission of Oxides of Nitrogen from Stationary
Gas Turbines (Coy) (909) 396-2434
<P>
<I>Proposed amendments will address SIP recommendations identified
by the U.S. EPA and exempt existing gas turbines operated in the
SEDAB, and in San Clemente Island.</I> 
<P>
-- Amend Regulation XX - Regional Clean Air Incentive Market (RECLAIM)
(Leyden)
<P>
<I>The proposed amendments will make changes suggested by EPA
to receive SIP approval. Issues include: definitions, variances,
NSR, Executive Officer discretion, test methods, and Economic
Incentive Program showings. The proposal also reviews technologies
for glass melting furnaces, gray portland cement kilns, steel
slab reheating, metal melting furnaces, and hot mix asphalt. Revisions
will be proposed for year 2000 emission factors for some of these
industries. Additionally, staff has made rule clarifications and

<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. SILVA, SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ, A UNANIMOUS VOTE
WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Antonovich, Burke
and Lee) APPROVING AGENDA ITEMS 4, 6, 7 , 9, 11, 14, 17, 18, 20,
21 AND 23 THROUGH 27 AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.
<P>
5. Report of the Public Advisor, Small Business Assistance, Economic
Development and Local Government Offices
<P>
Ms. Soto reported on the success of the proactive outreach program
initiated several months ago by her and Mr. Paulitz at the request
of the Board to acquaint state legislators and locally-elected
officials with the AQMD. She commended staff for their extensive
efforts in this program and added that she has received many positive
comments and kudos from city officials, who are more impressed
now with AQMD's outreach program. Mr. Paulitz indicated his concurrence
with Ms. Soto's remarks.
<P>
(Mr. Antonovich arrived at 10:00 a.m.)
<P>
8. Set a Public Hearing on November 17, 1995 to Amend Rule 102
- Definition of Terms
<P>
Noting that the proposed amended rule did not include a change
to the small business definition contained in the rule, Ms. Haggard
asked whether or not the existing definition in <BR>
Rule 102 was consistent with the change to the small business
definition in the BACT Guideline.
<P>
Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, responded that
the definitions were not consistent and agreed to bring a proposal
back to the Board as soon as possible, taking into account the
environmental assessment which would be necessary, to amend the
small business definition in Rule 102 to be consistent with the
definition in the BACT Guideline.
<P>
Chairman Mikels indicated that a member of the audience had submitted
a request to speak on Agenda Item No. 6, which he had failed to
recognize until after the Board's vote approving the item.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MS. SOTO, SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD, A UNANIMOUS VOTE
WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Burke and Lee)
TO RECONSIDER AGENDA ITEM NO. 6.
<P>
6. <I>AQMD Advisor</I>, Special Edition, October 1995
<P>
John Billheimer, Small Business Coalition, addressed the Board
and expressed his concern that the announcement in the Special
Edition of <I>AQMD Advisor</I> regarding the amnesty program approved
by the Board on September 8, 1995 (Rule 310 - Amnesty for Unpermitted
Equipment) in effect invited anyone to apply for permits under
amnesty with no restrictions whatsoever, other than that it be
determined that a permit is needed and that the permit be applied
for during the amnesty time period. However, if the Board approves
Agenda Item No. 41 as recommended by staff, there will be restrictions
placed on what equipment would be extended amnesty under <BR>
Rule 310. This could result in businesses submitting applications
for equipment permits after reading the announcement in the AQMD
Advisor, and then being informed that they are not eligible for
amnesty, thereby leaving them fully exposed to all penalties and
sanctions.
<P>
In response, Chairman Mikels pointed out that if there was any
misdirection provided in the announcement in the <I>Advisor</I>,
staff could clarify it in the next issue of the <I>Advisor</I>,
depending upon the action taken by the Board on Agenda Item No.
41.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MS. SOTO, SECONDED BY DR. WILSON, A UNANIMOUS VOTE
WAS CAST OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Burke and Lee)
APPROVING AGENDA ITEM NO. 6 AND DIRECTING STAFF TO CLARIFY THE
AMENDMENTS TO RULE 310, IF APPROVED BY THE BOARD DURING CONSIDERATION
OF AGENDA ITEM NO. 41, IN THE NEXT ISSUE OF <I>AQMD ADVISOR</I>.
<P>
10. Recommendation Regarding Appointee to Designated Deputy Position
<P>
In support of the staff recommendation regarding the compensation
for La Ronda Bowen as Public Advisor, Ms. Soto commented that
it was in keeping with concerns she has expressed in the past
with respect to promoting from within and the hiring/promotion
of minorities and women. Had AQMD not had the good fortune of
having someone like Ms. Bowen who could take on the duties of
Public Advisor and has performed those duties well, she believed
it would have merited open recruitment of candidates.
<P>
12. Recommendation to Cosponsor a Study to Investigate Potential
Health Effects of PM10 in the Coachella Valley
<P>
Ms. Soto asked staff if part of the $350,000 identified in this
item for health effect studies could be added to the $25,000 for
public information projects related to the studies, since staff's
recommendation was to provide $205,000 for a health effects study
at this time.
<P>
Mr. Paulitz, Chair of the Technology Committee which reviewed
and approved this item, pointed out that the main purpose was
to conduct the health effects studies; and the $25,000 is only
for the dissemination of that information. Mr. Braude agreed,
and stressed the importance of studying the health effects of
PM10 for the Coachella Valley region.
<P>
Dr. Alan Lloyd, Chief Scientist, responded that the $375,000 are
pass-through funds awarded by the U.S. EPA and a detailed plan
has been put together by AQMD and EPA staff as to how the funds
are to be used. There are other health-related studies being considered
for the remaining funds ($145,000), which staff will report back
to the Board on at a later date.
<P>
13. Recommendation to Execute an Agreement with the University
of California, Riverside to Conduct PM10 Emissions Testing from
Smoking Vehicles
<P>
15. Recommendation to Cosponsor the Demonstration of a Propane-Fueled
Hybrid-Electric Refuse Truck
<P>
16. Recommendation to Cosponsor the Third Year of Development
and Demonstration of Hybrid Rich-Burn/Lean-Burn Low-NOx Engine
<P>
Ms. Soto asked for more information on sole-source contracts;
and suggested that individual names--rather than company names--be
used in listing the contractors and perhaps a coding system could
be used to determine whether or not women and minorities are included.
<P>
Mr. Paulitz commented that when items such as these are reviewed
by the Technology Committee, committee members ask the type of
questions asked by Ms. Soto and there is extensive discussion.
He emphasized that: (i) many of these items are sole-source because
there is only one source capable of performing the work; (ii)
the AQMD shares the cost for many contracts with others, such
as EPA, CEC, and other air districts, and there has to be agreement
on what contractor will perform the work; and (iii) many times
pass-through funds are involved, and AQMD has to agree with the
sponsoring agency as to how those funds are used.
<P>
19. Status Report on Lead Agency Projects and Environmental Documents
Received by the AQMD
<P>
At Ms. Soto's request, staff agreed to include in this monthly
report any concerns expressed by the lead agency cities and how
AQMD is addressing those concerns.
<P>
22. Recommendation to Award Bid for Development of a Methodology
to Assess Geographic and Temporal Ozone Control Strategies for
the South Coast Air Basin
<P>
Ms. Soto commended staff for their follow up on this item, which
was discussed at the March 24, 1995 Summit meeting.
<P>
28. Recommendation to Pre-Qualify Vendors to Provide Various Non-Consultant
Services and Supplies
<P>
In response to comments by Ms. Soto, Chairman Mikels directed
staff to indicate on all vendor/contractor lists which businesses
were minority, woman, or disabled veteran-owned, using the traditional
MBE/WBE/DVBE designations.
<P>
ON MOTION OF MR. BRAUDE, SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD, A UNANIMOUS
VOTE WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Burke and
Lee) APPROVING AGENDA ITEMS 5, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 22 AND
28 AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.
<P>
<U><B>BOARD CALENDAR</B></U> 
<P>
Note: (a) The Interagency AQMP Implementation Committee did not
meet in September. The next meeting of the IAIC will be on October
26, 1995.
<P>
(b) The Air Resources Board did not meet in August, therefore
there was no report.
<P>
29. Administrative Committee Report
<P>
Ms. Soto expressed her support for Mr. Hewitt's suggestion at
the Administrative Committee meeting regarding formation of ad
hoc committees to consider senior management position vacancies.
Mr. Hewitt added that he expects that item to be scheduled by
the Administrative Committee for Board discussion and consideration
in the near future.
<P>
30. Legislative Committee Report and Recommendations
<P>
With respect to AB 259 (Escutia), a bill that would require AQMD
to assist cities in spending their AB 2766 vehicle registration
funds, Ms. Soto asked if staff could prepare a detailed written
report highlighting all of the instances where AQMD is providing
such assistance, and provide a copy of the report to Assemblywoman
Escutia.
<P>
Mr. Mikels noted that staff is preparing a report on how the AQMD
interacts, through the MSRC, with the cities that are recipients
of AB 2766 funds. He suggested that report be brought to the Board
through the Legislative Committee at the November 17, 1995 Board
meeting for approval and release to the public.
<P>
31. Mobile Source Committee Report
<P>
32. Stationary Source Committee Report
<P>
33. Technology Committee Report
<P>
34. Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee Report
<P>
In response to Ms. Soto's question on the status of the review
of MSRC's proposal selection process, Mr. Paulitz clarified that
the consultant was retained to evaluate the effectiveness of those
proposals already completed in achieving the emission reductions
projected. Larry Rhinehart, Intergovernmental Affairs Director,
added that the evaluation is still ongoing. Once the evaluation
is completed, a report will be reviewed by the MSRC and then provided
to the Board.

*Submitted Written Comments
<P>
There was no opposition expressed to staff's recommendation to
replace existing Rules 1501 and 1501.1 with a new rule. There
were, however, comments and suggestions made regarding the new
rule being developed, which are summarized below.
<UL>
<LI>The replacement rule should be an emissions, rather than trip
reduction rule, and should allow major employers either to submit
a trip reduction plan or to select one or more emissions reduction
or fee strategies, including but not limited to those currently
contained n Rule 1501.1.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The emissions reduction burden associated with Rules 1501
and 1501.1 should not be shifted to other businesses (e.g., manufacturers).
Those emission reductions should come from mobile sources--where
the majority of emissions originate.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The replacement rule should streamline TRPs for employers
who opt to continue to implement such plans.

<LI>There needs to be assurance from the Board that companies
that move soon to opt for Rule 1501.1 compliance will not somehow
be penalized for doing so.

<LI>Between now and December 1995, employers need to know what
the replacement rule will require, in order to plan for compliance.

<UL>
<LI>The replacement rule should be brought before the Board for
adoption only after public workshops have been held to obtain
input from industry, the environmental community, government and
other interested parties, in determining how the emission reductions
are to be assessed to various indirect sources.

<P>
Speaking in support of the staff recommendation, Mr. Braude emphasized
that there are costs associated with cleaning up the air; and
the rationale behind Regulation XV was to broaden the base for
the cost of achieving cleaner air beyond stationary sources, and
to place part of the burden on those who drive automobiles to
work.
<P>
MR. HEWITT MOVED THAT THE BOARD IMMEDIATELY REPEAL RULES 1501
AND 1501.1. THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY <BR>
MR. SILVA.
<P>
In support of that motion, Mr. Hewitt expressed his belief that
the Board should honor the California Legislature's approval of
SB 437 (Lewis) and SB 772 (Hurtt) by removing employer trip reduction
requirements. He intended to make a second motion directing staff
to develop a new regulation, that would be a composite of the
recommendations made by Mr. Wyman (COALESCE), SCAG and others,
to replace Rules 1501 and 1501.1; but he believed that the Board
should first repeal the two existing rules. At Mr. Mikels' suggestion,
<P>
MR. HEWITT AMENDED HIS MOTION TO INCLUDE THAT A PUBLIC HEARING
BE SCHEDULED FOR THE DECEMBER 8, 1995 BOARD MEETING ON A NEW REGULATION
TO REPLACE RULES 1501 AND 1501.1, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT
THE BOARD WOULD NOT NECESSARILY ADOPT A NEW REGULATION AT THE
DECEMBER MEETING AND THAT SUBSEQUENT PUBLIC HEARINGS MAY BE HELD
ON THE NEW REGULATION PROPOSED.
<P>
Indicating his concurrence with Mr. Braude's comments, Mr. Paulitz
added that everyone wants clean air, but wants someone else to
pay for it. His problem with Regulation XV has been that it was
linked to trip reductions instead of emission reductions. He supported
the staff recommendation and opposed the motion by Mr. Hewitt
because the federal Clean Air Act still requires employer trip
reductions; and therefore, he could not support repealing Rules
1501 and 1501.1 without replacing those rules with another regulation.
With respect to the two bills, he stated that he had not supported
either bill.
<P>
Dr. Wilson and Ms. Soto expressed their support for the staff
recommendation as well, and Dr. Wilson pointed out that the State
Legislature could have made SB 437 and SB 772 emergency bills,
which would have made the bills effective immediately. Apparently,
the Legislature felt that January 1, 1996 was a reasonable time.
Ms. Soto believed that repealing Rules 1501 and 1501.1 would be
a drastic step after all of the effort that has gone into <BR>
Regulation XV.
<P>
Speaking in support of the motion, Mr. Silva commented that the
money spent by businesses to comply with trip reduction requirements
could probably have been better spent on business expansion to
create more jobs for California.
<P>
Ms. Haggard expressed her support for the motion, as amended,
and questioned the Board's intent in supporting SB 437 and SB
772 if it was not to take this type of action. <BR>
Mr. Hewitt added that it seems counterintuitive that the Legislature
acts and, after endorsing these bills, the AQMD does not respond.
<P>
Chairman Mikels commented that one of the issues that has been
at the heart of the problem with Regulation XV has been the uncertainties
that have been created for employers. He believed that an outright
repeal of Rules 1501 and 1501.1 at this point, when the Board
has heard testimony on numerous occasions that Rule 1501.1 is
working and is cost-effective, does a disservice to employers
by giving the implication that Rule 1501.1 will not be coming
back; when the fact is that federal law requires it and it is
likely that elements contained in Rule 1501.1 will be a central
feature of the revised Regulation XV rule.
<P>
MR. HEWITT MADE A SUBSTITUTE MOTION: 1) TO RECEIVE AND FILE THE
STAFF REPORT AND DIRECT STAFF TO PREPARE A NEW REGULATION TO REPLACE
EXISTING RULES 1501 AND 1501.1 AND SCHEDULE AN ADOPTION HEARING
FOR DECEMBER 8, 1995, AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF; AND 2) THAT RULES
1501 AND 1501.1 WILL BE REPEALED EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 1995.
<P>
Chairman Mikels indicated that he would support the motion if
he was certain that a replacement rule would be adopted by the
December 8, 1995 Board meeting. However, he believed the motion
should state clearly that any emission reduction deficit created
must come from mobile sources within the purview of this Board,
and not from stationary sources. To the extent that those emission
reductions are going to come from mobile sources, he was not sure
the rule development process could be completed before December
8.
<P>
Peter Greenwald, General Counsel, pointed out that state law requires
the Board to hold a hearing on 30 days notice prior to repealing
a rule or regulation. Since no notice has been given--nor a hearing
held--on the issue of repealing Rules 1501 and 1501.1, he suggested
that the motion be to direct staff to bring a proposal back to
the Board to repeal Rules 1501 and 1501.1 prior to January 1,
1996; rather than to make a decision at this time that those rules
will be repealed.
<P>
Mr. Hewitt responded that since there was direction to staff to
prepare a new regulation to replace Rules 1501 and 1501.1 included
in the staff recommendation, he believed that to be sufficient
notice that Rules 1501 and 1501.1 could be replaced at this hearing.
<P>
THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION BY MR. HEWITT: 1) TO RECEIVE AND FILE THE
STAFF REPORT AND DIRECT STAFF TO PREPARE A NEW REGULATION TO REPLACE
EXISTING RULES 1501 AND 1501.1 AND SCHEDULE AN ADOPTION HEARING

1501 AND 1501.1 SHALL WILL BE REPEALED EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31,

Indicating his belief that as the Board considers alternatives
to Regulation XV and <BR>
Rule 1501.1, it should stay in step with the intent of Senate
Bills 437 and 772 to alleviate employers required to submit TRPs
of unnecessary financial burdens,
<P>
MR. ANTONOVICH MOVED THAT THE BOARD SUSPEND THE FEES FOR FILING
RIDESHARING PLANS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE BOARD DETERMINES THE
FUTURE OF REGULATION XV AND RULE 1501.1. THE MOTION WAS SECONDED
BY MS. SOTO.
<P>
In response to Mr. Braude, Dr. Lents stated that suspending the
filing fee for TRPs as proposed by Mr. Antonovich would delay
approximately $300,000 in revenue over a two-month period. However,
if the Board ultimately waived the fees completely, it would result
in a loss of over $1 million in annual revenue for the AQMD.

39. Amend Rule 1610 - Old Vehicle Scrapping
<P>
Henry Hogo, Planning Manager, presented the staff report. The
public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from
the following individuals:
<P>
<U>JON OWYANG, Old Vehicle Clearinghouse</U> 
<P>
Emphasized that the Board needs to establish as a policy that
irrespective of what happens in the future, credits that are generated
should be usable for all future regulations.

GREG SMITH, Motorsport Industries
<P>
RAY BEGGS, Association of California Car Clubs
<P>
PAUL MADDAMS, Southern California Galaxies Club
<P>
<U>*FRANK BOHANAN, Specialty Equipment Market Association</U>

<P>
*Submitted Written Comments
<P>
1) Expressed belief that the goals of Rule 1610 to remove gross
polluters from service and ensure that those vehicles are never
returned to service as gross-polluting daily transportation can
be accomplished without the destruction of parts mandated in (e)(1),
particularly the cylinder block, unitized body and frame.
<P>
2) Requested that the Board consider making available to hobbyists
and restorers the cylinder blocks, unitized bodies and frames
because replacement parts to repair classic cars are becoming
more and more scarce.
<P>
3) Suggested that the requirement that parts be destroyed within
90 days be either eliminated or changed to <I>after</I> 90 days.
<P>
CHARLES AARNI, Chevron USA Products Company
<P>
<U>MIKE RIEHLE, Unocal </U>
<P>
Opposed language in Subparagraph (h)(7) which extends the lifetime
of MSERCs generated from scrap programs performed after April
14, 1995 to five years; thereby implying that the lifetime of
MSERCs from programs performed prior to that date will stay at
three years. Suggested, in order to be fair to everyone, that
the lifetime of those credits should also be extended five years,
recognizing that there would be no increase in the total number
of MSERCs and no increase in the total emissions, yet they would
be able to use the remaining MSERCs over a longer period of time.
<P>
There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.
<P>
MR. HEWITT MOVED THAT THE BOARD ADOPT RESOLUTION NO. 95-29, AMENDING

<P>
THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. HAGGARD.
<P>
In response to a question by Ms. Soto, Mr. Hewitt indicated that
he believed his motion would address the concerns expressed by
Dr. Burke in the past with respect to how scrapping of old vehicle
parts affects car collectors.
<P>
With respect to his proposed modification to Subparagraph (h)(7),
Mr. Hewitt commented that he believed it would be inequitable
to those who took the risks to launch the program to not extend
the life of their existing MSERCs for five years.
<P>
Mr. Braude expressed concern with giving credits to businesses
for purchasing older vehicles from people at a cost of approximately
$600, when it has not been determined for sure what those credits
are actually going to be worth. He believed that the people that
are really going to pay for these credits will be the public.
<P>
Staff suggested the following modifications to Subparagraph (h)(7)
in order to address the concerns raised, but also clarify that
the five-year lifetime of MSERCs would not apply to those credits
which have already expired:
<UL>
<LI>Eliminate the words &quot;<I>on or after April 14, 1995</I>&quot;
from the first sentence; and
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Revise the second sentence to read <I>&quot;This paragraph
shall also apply to credits that have been issued to vehicle scrapping
activities prior to October 13, 1995 provided that these credits
have not expired or have not been consumed.&quot;</I> 
</UL>

<P>
Mr. Hewitt and Ms. Haggard indicated their agreement with the
modifications suggested by staff, and amending the motion to reflect
those modifications.
<P>
Ms. Soto indicated that she intended to vote &quot;no&quot; on
this item because she was unsure and felt that the wrong people
would probably be affected by the rule.
<P>

the article in a special edition of the <I>AQMD Advisor</I> inviting
companies to apply for permits under the Rule 310 amnesty program.
<P>
2) Questioned the proportion of permits subject to Schedule C,
and suggested that AQMD prepare a list of Schedule C facilities
indicating the number of employees and number of permits for each
facility. (Submitted Written Comments.)
<P>
With respect to the article published in <I>AQMD Advisor</I>,
Dr. Lents responded that he re-read the article after hearing
Mr. Billheimer's comments on Agenda Item No. 6 and did not find
the article to be misleading because it refers to &quot;many people&quot;

<H3>Set a Public Hearing to Amend Rule 1134 -<BR>
Emissions of Oxides of Nitrogen from Stationary Gas Turbines </CENTER>
</H3>

<P>
<U><B>Introduction</B></U> 
<P>
The purpose of Rule 1134 - Emissions of Oxides of Nitrogen from
Stationary Gas Turbines, is to provide emission reductions of
nitrogen oxides (NOX), which are necessary to attain and/or maintain
state and federal ambient air quality standards for nitrogen dioxide
(NO2), particulate matter (PM10) and visibility. In order to achieve
this, Rule 1134 requires various categories of stationary gas
turbines operating in the South Coast Air Quality Management District
(AQMD) to meet specific NOX concentration limits. The rule has
a final compliance date of December 31, 1995, and applies to all
existing stationary gas turbines rated at 0.3 megawatts (MW) or
greater which are located within the AQMD jurisdiction.
<P>
The origin of the rule can be traced to a 1979 United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) New Source Performance Standard for Stationary
Gas Turbines. In 1981, the California Air Resources Board (CARB)
adopted a Suggested Control Measure for this same equipment. Following
this, the AQMD incorporated into the 1982 revision of the Air
Quality Management Plan (AQMP), Measure E-1, titled Electric Utility
Gas Turbines NOX Control. This led to the adoption of Rule 1134
in 1989 which encompasses various NOX emission limits for a wide
range of gas turbine applications.
<P>
Facilities subject to Rule 1134 generally include those which
utilize gas turbine units to generate electricity. These units
add power to the regional electrical power grid directly or displace
utility-supplied power by on-site power generation with the surplus
power, if any, going to the grid. The electrical energy supply
market can be categorized into three segments: utilities, on-site
generators and third-party-owned cogenerators. Exclusive on-site
power units are typically less than 10 MW in size. The third-party-owned
cogenerator units generally range in size from 20 to 40 MW, though
some are less than 10 MW or greater than 40 MW. Utility units,
both simple and combined cycle, range in size from about 20 to
greater than 130 MW. At the time of the rule's adoption in 1989,
it was estimated that the gas turbine capacity in the AQMD was
2,473 MW, with 1,985 MW in operation and 488 MW of new units to
be completed. The AQMD-wide NOX emissions as a result of the rule
were expected to be reduced from 18.9 tons per day to 8.9 tons
per day for a net reduction of 10 tons per day.
<P>
<U><B>Proposed Amendments</B></U> 
<P>
Rule 1134 presently requires all stationary gas turbines in the
AQMD to meet specified NOX concentration limits by December 31,
1995. The limits are dependent upon the size (MW rating) of the
unit and type of control technology utilized. Exemptions apply
to certain types of turbines such as emergency standby and peaking
units which operate less than 200 hours per year; laboratory units
used in research and testing; units used exclusively for firefighting
and/or flood control; or existing chemical processing units.
<P>
Beginning in 1994, a large number of utilities and third-party-owned
cogenerators were included in the Regional Clean Air Incentives
Market (RECLAIM) program and as such are not required to meet
the NOX concentration limits imposed by Rule 1134. However, gas
turbines used at publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs), landfills,
hospitals and other public facilities, and smaller sources which
were not covered under RECLAIM, are still required to meet the
concentration limits in Rule 1134 through application of various
control technologies.
<P>
Of those non-RECLAIM sources required to meet the NOX concentration
limits, some have raised concerns indicating that the application
of available technology is not suitable for a number of reasons.
Some of these units are operated so infrequently and in such remote
areas of the AQMD that add-on controls, or combustion modifications,
if available, are not cost-effective. The gas turbines located
in the Southeast Desert Air Basin (SEDAB) are in a geographical
area where NOX, ozone and some of the PM10 concerns are transient
and as a direct result of emissions generated within the South
Coast Air Basin (SCAB). The SEDAB includes specific desert portions
of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties within the
jurisdiction of the AQMD. Also, the gas turbines located on San
Clemente Island (SCI) are in such location that any NOX emissions
generated from the island do not impact the air quality in SCAB.
The only facility on SCI was recently removed from the RECLAIM
program for the same reason.
<P>
This proposed rule amendment will provide an exemption to specified
existing gas turbines located in SEDAB, and all existing gas turbines
on SCI. The main factors which provided the basis for this proposed
amendment are listed below:
<UL>
<LI>The number of gas turbine sources located in SEDAB are few;
a total of 23 units have been identified in SEDAB, 17 of which
have an equivalent rating below 2.0 MW.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The number of gas turbine sources located on SCI are few;
a total of 4 units have been identified, all of which have an
equivalent rating below 1.0 MW.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The contribution to AQMD-wide emissions from all SEDAB and
SCI gas turbines combined is minimal in comparison to other SCAB
sources.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>NOX Control Measures for both the Antelope Valley and Riverside
County SEDAB are not compromised by exempting all sources from
the rule requirements. The 1994 AQMP does not emphasize any further
NOX control measures to be implemented in SEDAB.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The total amount of reductions possible as a result of successfully
applying controls to both SEDAB and SCI sources is not expected
to create a significant cumulative impact to the overall air quality
in the AQMD. Control of these sources combined would yield only
one percent of the total NOX emission reductions which were expected
when the rule was adopted in August, 1989.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The sources identified in SEDAB and SCI either cannot physically
retrofit or apply add-on controls, or cannot implement cost effective
controls to meet rule requirements.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The sources in SEDAB and SCI which are proposed to be exempted
historically have low annual usage rates in comparison to their
maximum possible operations. Specifically, Gas Company units (SEDAB)
have operated an average of less than 20 percent of the time over
the last four years. The Rockwell (SEDAB) and SCI units have operated
less than one percent of the year on average for the last three
years.
</UL>

<P>
A Public Workshop was held for this rule on August 18, 1995. The
Public Hearing is scheduled for December 8, 1995. As per the Notice
of Public Hearing, written comments will be accepted through November
28, 1995.
<P>
Pursuant to the AQMD's Certified Regulatory Program (Rule 110)
the AQMD has prepared appropriate California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA) documentation consisting of a Draft Supplemental Envirommental
Assessment (SEA). The Draft SEA has been circulated for a 45-day
public review and comment period and is included as part of this
package. A Final SEA will be prepared which will include response
to comments received on the Draft SEA.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Set a public hearing for the December 8, 1995 Board meeting
to amend Rule 1134 - Emissions of Oxides of Nitrogen from Stationary
Gas Turbines

BOARD MEETING 
<P>
DATE: November 17, 1995  
<P>
AGENDA NO. <U>7</U>
<P>
<B>PROPOSAL:</B>
<P>
 <B>Set a Public Hearing to Rescind Rule 1129 - Aerosol Coatings,
and Amend Rule 1106.1 - Pleasure Craft Coating Operations, Rule
1107 - Coating of Metal Parts and Products, Rule 1128 - Paper,
Fabric, and Film Coating Operations, Rule 1130 - Graphic Arts,
Rule 1145 - Plastic, Rubber, and Glass Coatings, and Rule 1151
- Motor Vehicle and Mobile Equipment Non-Assembly Line Coating
Operations</B>
<P>
<B>SYNOPSIS:</B>
<P>
 The rescinding of Rule 1129 and proposed amendment of the other
coating rules are necessary to make AQMD rules consistent with
Section 41712 of the state Health and Safety Code which prohibits
local districts from enforcing or regulating VOC limits on aerosol
coatings.  In addition, the proposed amendment of the definition
of &quot;exempt compounds&quot; in each rule will reference Rule
102 - Definition of Terms, to provide a consistent definition
between rules.
<P>
<B>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</B>
<P>
 Set a public hearing December 7, 1995, to Rescind Rule 1129 -
Aerosol Coatings, and Amend Rule 1106.1 - Pleasure Craft Coating
Operations, Rule 1107 - Coating of Metal Parts and Products, Rule
1128 - Paper, Fabric, and Film Coating Operations, Rule 1130 -
Graphic Arts, Rule 1145 - Plastic, Rubber, and Glass Coatings,
and Rule 1151 - Motor Vehicle and Mobile Equipment Non-Assembly
Line Coating Operations.

<U>            </U>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
Rule 1129 - Aerosol Coatings, and associated coating rule amendments
were adopted November 2, 1990, to reduce volatile organic compound
emissions from aerosol coatings.  Subsequently, Dunn Edwards Corporation
and two groups of aerosol paint manufacturers each filed a lawsuit
challenging the Rule 1129 adoption and other amendments on numerous
grounds.  While the Los Angeles County Superior Court ruled in
favor of the plaintiffs in July of 1991, suspending Rule 1129
and the associated amendments, the AQMD prevailed in its appeal
in May of 1993, allowing the reinstatement.
<P>
In October of 1993, the state legislature adopted amendments to
the State Health and Safety Code Section 41712, requiring the
California Air Resources Board (CARB) to adopt an aerosol paint
regulation and prohibiting local districts from adopting and enforcing
local aerosol paint regulations.  Subsequently, CARB adopted a
statewide Aerosol Coatings Products Rule on March 23, 1995.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B>
<P>
To be consistent with state law, staff proposes to rescind Rule
1129 and to amend Rules 1106.1, 1107, 1128, 1130, 1145 and 1151
to exempt aerosol coatings products (aerosol coating products
do not include aerosol adhesives.)  Additionally, staff is proposing
language to adopt the CARB definition of &quot;aerosol coating
products&quot; in order to provide rule consistency with the recently-adopted
CARB Aerosol Coatings Products Rule.  Finally, staff proposes
to amend the definition of &quot;exempt compounds&quot; in each
rule to reference its definition in Rule 102 - Definition of Terms,
which already controls in the event of a conflict in the rules.
<P>
<B>AQMP</B>
<P>
The proposed amendments have no impact on emissions, and are consistent
with the AQMP.
<P>
<B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B>
<P>
Staff has analyzed the proposed rule amendments and has found
there will be no impact on emission limits or air quality due
to these proposed changes.  The proposed rule changes regarding
aerosol coatings are mandated by state law.  The proposed amendments
regarding the definition of exempt compounds simply clarify the
existing rule requirements.  Due to the limited nature of the
amendments, no socioeconomic assessment is required.  The amendments
will not have any effect on the cost of compliance with the amended
rules.
<P>
Staff has reviewed the proposed rescinding of Rule 1129 and the
proposed amendments to Rules 1106.1, 1107, 1128, 1130, 1145, and
1151, and has determined that they are exempt from the requirements
of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), pursuant to
State CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(1) and (b)(3).  Therefore,
a Notice of Exemption will be prepared for the proposed amendments
and will be filed with the county clerks immediately following
the adoption of the proposed amendments.

 AGENDA NO.<U> 8</U>
<P>
PROPOSAL:
<P>
<B> Set Hearing to Adopt Proposed Rule 118 - Emergencies</B>
<P>
SYNOPSIS:
<P>
 The proposed rule is in response to public concern regarding
the potential need for emergency support, extended hours of operation,
or the use of additional equipment not permitted by the AQMD in
the event of an official State of Emergency.  The proposed rule
would allow the Executive Officer the discretion to suspend AQMD
rules, regulations or orders in the event of a state or federally
declared State of Emergency.  The suspension would be specific
to the needs and circumstances of the emergency and may apply
only to specific jurisdictions within the South Coast Air Quality
Management District.
<P>
 
<P>
 This Board letter will serve as the Staff Report for this proposed
rule.
<P>
COMMITTEE:
<P>
 Stationary Source, October 27, 1995, Approved
<P>
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
<P>
1.     Set a Public Hearing for December 8, 1995, to Adopt Rule
118 - Emergencies.

<P>
<U><B>BACKGROUND</B></U>
<P>
During the past several years, Southern California has experienced
several disaster-related emergencies.  These emergencies have
included fires, earthquakes, civil unrest and flooding.  The latest
state and federally declared State of Emergency occurred in February
1995 when weeks of excessive rain resulted in devastating flooding
effects throughout the area.  Emergency situations have required
the extensive use of potentially polluting non-permitted equipment
in the District in order to remedy the emergency, secure the safety
of the public or otherwise provide emergency support.  In other
instances, there has been a need for the expedited replacement
of damaged or destroyed equipment, or an extension of normal operating
hours for permitted equipment to address emergency needs.  
<P>
<U><B>PROPOSAL</B></U>
<P>
In an effort to assist the community in disaster-related crises,
the AQMD has drafted Proposed Rule 118 - Emergencies.  This proposed
rule will give the Executive Officer the authority to temporarily
suspend any AQMD rules, regulations or orders in the event of
a state or federally-declared State of Emergency.  The suspension
will be rule specific and may be region specific within the AQMD's
areas of jurisdiction depending on the emergency and its magnitude.
<P>
This suspension will be beneficial in an emergency situation as
it will enable the Executive Officer to allow additional equipment
to be used in the four-county area even though it does not have
AQMD permits to operate.  In addition, the suspension may allow
for extended hours of operation beyond specified permit conditions.
 The rule suspension will be 10 calendar days but may be extended
by the Executive Officer if deemed necessary.  The suspension
will not last any longer than the official State of Emergency
but will give facilities the time they need to complete emergency
and rescue work before the extensive clean-up process begins.
 Any replacement permits or permits needed for construction or
demolition equipment after the State of Emergency has ended will
be processed by the AQMD in an expedited manner.  
<P>
<U><B>CEQA AND SOCIOECONOMIC ANALYSIS</B></U>
<P>
AQMD staff has reviewed the proposed rule and determined it is
exempt from the requirements of the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA).  The rule does not establish any new emission limits,
but rather, allows for exemptions during a declared State of Emergency.
 Due to the administrative nature of the rule and the fact that
the rule applies to projects considered exempt under state CEQA
Guidelines Section 21172, a Notice of Exemption will be prepared
and filed with the county clerks immediately following the Governing
Board's approval of this rule.
<P>
Proposed Rule 118 is not expected to cause any adverse socioeconomic
impacts.  It may provide potential cost reductions to facilities
affected by the emergency by suspending specified AQMD orders,
rules or regulations that would have otherwise been applicable.
<P>
<U><B>IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</B></U>
<P>
The AQMD held a public consultation meeting on October 24, 1995,
to solicit input regarding the proposed rule and how AQMD rules
could be suspended with both the least inconvenience to the regulated
public and the fewest adverse environmental impacts.  Staff is
considering comments received at the public consultation meeting
for inclusion in the final rule.
<P>
<U><B>RESOURCE IMPACTS</B></U>
<P>
AQMD resources may be temporarily impacted as a result of the
proposed rule.  Staff will be required to assist with expedited
permit processing for the replacement of destroyed equipment or
for the use of emergency equipment needed on a temporary basis.
 In addition, the Public Advisor's Office may participated in
conveying the message to the regulated public regarding the temporary
suspension of specific AQMD rules, regulations or orders.  Any
resource impacts as a result of the rule, however, will be temporary
and would likely have occurred as a result of the emergency irrespective
of the proposed rule.

<P>
PROPOSAL:
<P>
<B>Set Hearing to Adopt Proposed Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle
Mitigation Options and Rescind Rules 1501 and 1501.1.</B> 
<P>
SYNOPSIS:
<P>
At its October 13, 1995 meeting, the Board directed staff to return
in December with a new rule designed to replace Rule 1501 - Work
Trip Reduction Plans, and Rule 1501.1 - Alternatives to Work Trip
Reduction Plans. Proposed Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation
Options has been designed for that purpose and would provide employers
with a menu of performance based compliance options. The voluntary
submittal of trip reduction plans is also allowed at the sole
discretion of employers. Proposed Rule 2202 is designed to result
in equivalent emission reductions anticipated through the implementation
of Rule 1501 and 1501.1.
<P>
COMMITTEE:
<P>
Mobile Source, October 20, 1995, No Action
<P>
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
<P>
Set a Public Hearing December 8, 1995, to Adopt Proposed Rule
2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options, and to Rescind
Rules 1501 - Work Trip Reduction Plans and 1501.1 - Alternatives
to Work Trip Reduction Plans upon adoption of Rule 2202.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The AQMD adopted Rules 1501 - Work Trip Reduction Plans and 1501.1
- Alternatives to Work Trip Reduction Plans to comply with federal
and state requirements. The use of mandatory rideshare plans as
a clean air strategy has been criticized by many employers subject
to Rule 1501.
<P>
In October 1995, the AQMD Governing Board held a public hearing
to receive comments on existing Rules 1501 and 1501.1, and to
review a program status report. At that time, in response to employer
comments and to recently enacted state legislation prohibiting
the mandatory submittal of trip reduction plans, the Board directed
staff to return in December with a new rule to replace Rules 1501
and 1501.1. A replacement rule is required to maintain compliance
with federal Clean Air Act requirements and to ensure expeditious
progress toward clean air standards.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
Proposed Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options
is being designed to reduce or mitigate mobile source emissions
from employee commutes and is proposed to replace Rules 1501 and
1501.1. It provides members of the regulated community with a
menu of flexible and cost effective emission reduction strategies
from which they can choose to implement and meet the emission
reduction target for their site. The intent of the rule is to
make compliance less costly, more flexible, and easier to implement.
Strategies that are available to employers include old-vehicle
scrapping, credits from clean on-road vehicles and off-road equipment,
the use of remote sensing to identify and subsequently repair
gross polluting vehicles, and emission reduction credits from
stationary sources generated after January 1, 1996. In addition,
employers may earn credits for the use of alternative fuel vehicles,
the reduction of vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and other trip
reduction activities that they implement at their sole discretion.
An air quality investment program is also provided to employers
with 100 to 500 employee with options for a one year or three
year payment. Furthermore, Proposed Rule 2202 allows companies
the option of continuing to implement traditional rideshare plans
and be deemed in compliance with the rule. Finally, Proposed Rule
2202 is designed as an interim measure to be replaced with market
incentive strategies when they are implemented.
<P>
The new rule will apply to worksites with 100 or more employees
and would result in equivalent emission reductions with Rule 1501
and 1501.1. The rule contains a sunset provision effective three
years after adoption, provided replacement measures are implemented.
<P>
The Board's Mobile Source Committee has scheduled a special meeting
for November 27, 1995, to review any remaining issues related
to proposed Rule 2202. At that meeting staff will present an overview
of comments received at the public workshops and consultation
meetings.

<H3>Recommendation to Adopt a Resolution Amending Resolution No.
94-5 as Reaffirmed by Resolution No. 95-17 Regarding the Issuance
of Bonds to Retire the Unfunded Accrued Liability for Employees
Participating in the San Bernardino County Employees' Retirement
Association and Authorizing Additional Related Actions </H3>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
In August 1995 the Board reaffirmed its February 1994 authorization
to reduce the AQMD's retirement contributions to the San Bernardino
County Employees Retirement Association (SBCERA) by approving
Resolution 95-17 (attached) authorizing the issuing of bonds to
retire the Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability (UAAL) due to
SBCERA.
<P>
The original resolution, as reaffirmed by Resolution 95-17, contemplated
that both the AQMD and the County of San Bernardino (County) would
issue bonds jointly. The AQMD has learned that the County may
not be willing, at this time, to issue the County's portion of
the bonds due to financial reasons unrelated to the AQMD. Staff
is therefore proposing an amendment to the authorizing resolutions
to allow the AQMD to retire its UAAL with SBCERA independent of
the County, if long-term interest rates in the bond market again
reach levels which offer savings to the AQMD.
<P>
This recommendation was reviewed and approved by the Administrative
Committee on October 27, 1995.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Adopt the attached resolution amending Resolution No. 94-5 as
Reaffirmed by Resolution 95-17 authorizing the execution of a
debenture evidencing a portion of the AQMD's obligations to the
San Bernardino County Employees' Retirement Association, authorizing
the issuance and sale to the San Bernardino County Financing Authority
of bonds of the AQMD to refund the debenture, authorizing and
directing execution of a related indenture and bond purchase contract,
approving the form and authorizing distribution of a preliminary
official statement in connection with the offering and sale by
the authority of its revenue bonds to purchase the AQMD's bonds
and authorizing official actions related thereto.

<H3>Recommendation to Cosponsor Demonstrations<BR>
<U>of Natural Gas Engines in Heavy-Duty Trucks</U> </H3>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Heavy-duty trucks (HDT) account for 4% of the vehicle population
in California, but contribute nearly 50% of the oxides of nitrogen
(NOx) and over 80% of the on-road particulate matter (PM) as estimated
by the California Air Resources Board (ARB) for the year 2000.
The majority of these trucks are powered by diesel fuel. The ARB
has estimated that about 20% of the heavy-duty truck vehicle miles
traveled (VMT) is produced from vehicles registered outside California,
further exacerbating the problem.
<P>
At its May 1995 meeting, the AQMD Governing Board approved release
of Request for Proposals (RFP) 9495-31 entitled, &quot;Alternative
Fuels-Heavy-Duty Truck Demonstration, to solicit demonstration
projects for alternative fuel use in heavy-duty trucks. The objective
of the RFP was to solicit proposals to develop and demonstrate
the use of alternative fuel engines with NOx emissions of 2.5
g/bhp-hr, one-half the current NOx standard, or lower. The RFP
further expressed a goal of ten or more trucks at each host site.
The purpose of this goal was to expand current alternative fuel
truck experience beyond the one and two prototype vehicle stage.
<P>
Three proposals were received in response to this RFP: 1) County
Sanitation Districts of Orange County (CSDOC) who proposed to
demonstrate a dual-fuel (diesel pilot ignition/compressed natural
gas) Caterpillar 3176B engine in trucks transporting biosolid
materials from Fountain Valley to Kern County; 2) Acurex Environmental
Corporation (Acurex) who proposed to demonstrate liquified natural
gas (LNG) Cummins L-10 and M-11 engines in trucks operated by
J. B. Kelley and Apex Bulk Commodities and traveling interstate
routes; and 3) The Tred Foundation who proposed to demonstrate
ten LNG Cummins L-10 engines in trucks operated by Ryder Commercial
Leasing and Services and their customers in the Basin.
<P>
The proposals were reviewed and scored by a committee composed
of representatives of the AQMD and the California Energy Commission,
and an independent consultant. The selection committee recommended
that the CSDOC and Acurex receive full and partial awards respectively.
The committee's recommendation that both Acurex and CSDOC be funded
was arrived as a result of the unique aspects of each project.
The CSDOC project will demonstrate the viability of a dual-fuel
re-engine strategy, while the Acurex proposal will demonstrate
the viability of alternative fuel use in interstate trucking applications.
The CSDOC proposal received the highest score, and was recommended
for full funding of $447,000. The Acurex proposal requested $1,000,000
for two interstate truck demonstrations - one travelling LA Basin-Salt
Lake City-Sacramento, the other LA-Arizona. The $1,000,000 funding
constraint of the RFP precluded full funding of the Acurex proposal.
However, the committee recommended funding part of the proposal,
the LA-Salt Lake City-Sacramento demonstration of five LNG trucks,
in the amount of $553,000. Attachment 1 describes the selection
process in greater detail.
<P>
<B>Proposals</B> 
<P>
CSDOC will install a CNG fueling facility at its Fountain Valley
site and demonstrate the Caterpillar 3176B dual-fuel engine in
ten heavy-duty trucks that transport municipal biosolids from
Fountain Valley to Kern County. The 3176B dual-fuel engine burns
natural gas with a small quantity of diesel as a pilot to achieve
significant emission reductions compared to dedicated heavy-duty
diesel engines. Ten trucks will be repowered with the 3176B dual-fuel
engine and three control trucks will continue to operate on standard
3176 diesel engines. Each truck will make the approximately 300-mile
round trip twice a day. Battelle Memorial Institute will provide
technical support to the demonstration.
<P>
Acurex will demonstrate five Cummins L-10 engines, operating on
LNG, in vehicles operated by J. B. Kelley. J. B. Kelley is a high-mileage
operation that conducts interstate business. Acurex shall also
establish a fueling facility at or near the host site in the Inland
Empire. A major objective of this demonstration is to create a
Clean Corridor Program, with the trucks operating on a Basin-Salt
Lake City-Sacramento-Basin route. This is the first step in addressing
the issue of out-of-state trucks entering California, and creating
a fueling infrastructure to serve those trucks.
<P>
<B>Financial Terms</B> 
<P>
Staff recommends that the AQMD cosponsor two demonstrations of
LNG in heavy-duty trucks, one with CSDOC and the other one with
Acurex.
<P>
<B>County Sanitation Districts of Orange County</B> 
<P>
CSDOC requested $447,000 cosponsorship funding from the AQMD,

<H3>Recommendation to Cosponsor a<BR>
Navigation System and Traffic Data Field Test </H3>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are a group of advanced
or emerging technologies that can make the existing transportation
system more efficient by relieving traffic congestion, reducing
travel time, and/or minimizing vehicle miles traveled thereby
reducing emissions. ITS technologies can include information processing,
integrated vehicle/traffic control, and ground-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-vehicle
communications.
<P>
On-road mobile sources are responsible for a large portion of
Southern California's persistent air quality problem. In fact,
the 1994 Air Quality Management Plan estimates that in 1990, this
category was responsible for more than 50 percent of emissions
of volatile organic compounds, 60 percent of oxides of nitrogen,
and almost 80 percent of the carbon monoxide emissions in the
South Coast Air Basin. ITS technologies can potentially reduce
emissions from automobiles, trucks, and buses by providing drivers
with up-to-the-minute information on traffic conditions and directing
them to less congested alternate routes, thereby keeping them
on the road for shorter periods of time.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
Amerigon Incorporated (Amerigon) has developed AudioNav, a proprietary
in-vehicle driver navigation system capable of providing audible
origin-to-destination instructions. Amerigon has proposed a multi-year,
two-phase project to modify AudioNav to utilize traffic data,
as well as navigational information, to generate audible trip
instructions which take into account road conditions (e.g., congestion,
accidents, road work). Amerigon has also proposed to modify AudioNav's
navigational software to include the locations of alternative
fuel refueling facilities and electric vehicle recharging stations
in the Basin.
<P>
This effort shall focus largely on developing the hardware and
software interfaces needed to allow AudioNav to access and utilize
existing and potential traffic data sources (e.g., traffic database(s)
stored on CD-ROM, real-time traffic data transmitted over cellular
communication networks). In addition, Amerigon shall field test
AudioNav and evaluate whether dynamic rerouting capabilities improve
AudioNav's performance.
<P>
<B>Sole-Source Justification</B> 
<P>
Section II, Step 3 (C) of the Consultant Selection Policy identifies
four provisions under which a sole-source bid may be awarded:
(1) cost to prepare documents exceeds the cost for consultant,
(2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health, (3)
services are only available from sole-source, (4) other circumstances
exist identifying sole-source as in the best interest of the District.
This request for sole-source award is being made under provisions
(3) and (4).
<P>
Support of the proposed work by Amerigon is in the best interest
of the AQMD for several reasons. First, AudioNav modified to incorporate
real-time traffic data could reduce vehicle miles traveled, provide
air quality benefits, and reduce roadway congestion in the Basin.
These benefits could eventually extend to vehicles which, although
operated in the Basin, are not registered locally and, as a result,
are not subject to AQMD or state regulations (e.g., out-of-state
tourist-owned vehicles and commercial heavy-duty trucks). The
proposed project could also serve as the basis for an AQMD mobile
source control strategy.
<P>
Second, Amerigon is currently the only producer of audio-interface
navigational technology in the world. AudioNav is arguably the
safest vehicle navigational technology available because it does
not require drivers to move their eyes or attention away from
the road when activating or interfacing with the system. All commands
are verbal, as are all responses. Other available navigational
systems require the manipulation of a keyboard or for the driver
to obtain requested information from a monitor, increasing the
potential for distraction and accidents. The use of AudioNav for
this project, rather than a navigational system utilizing a visual
interface, more adequately balances enhanced air quality and congestion
management with vehicle operational safety.
<P>
Third, because its hardware is based largely on commercially available
CD-ROM and speech recognition technology, AudioNav is far less
expensive than other vehicle navigational systems developed to
date which require global positioning system receivers, keyboards,
and displays. In fact, the current version of AudioNav, which
does not incorporate dynamic rerouting, is priced below $1,000.
If developed under the proposed project, AudioNav with dynamic
rerouting could become widely available, both in the Basin and
nationally, at an affordable price within a relatively short time.
<P>
Fourth, modifications to AudioNav software to include Basin alternative
fuel refueling and electric vehicle recharging facilities, proposed
for this project, could provide a valuable source of information
to drivers of these vehicles. In addition, this information could
generate additional interest in alternative fuel and electric
vehicles among users of AudioNav.
<P>

<H3>Recommendation to Recognize Revenue From the<BR>
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Appropriate Funds to
Cosponsor<BR>
 <U>CALSTART's Electric Station Car/Corridor Shuttle Project</U>
</H3>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The mobile source element of the Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP)
is largely based on the Air Resources Board's (ARB) Low Emission
Vehicle and Clean Fuels program. The AQMP calls for progressively
greater Basin penetrations of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), which
are the cleanest vehicles embodied in ARB's regulations. Automobile
manufacturers are likely to meet ZEV requirements by producing
battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs), at least until fuel cell
vehicles become commercially viable.
<P>
The Environmental Technology Initiative (ETI) program, administered
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region IX, is a program
to accelerate environmental protection, strengthen America's industrial
base, and increase exports of U.S. technologies and expertise.
The AQMD, in conjunction with CALSTART, submitted a proposal for
funding under the ETI program to demonstrate electric station
car technology within the South Coast Air District. As a result,
the EPA awarded and reserved $250,000 in Fiscal Year 1995 ETI
grant funds for the AQMD to develop and deploy electric station
cars in the Lancaster and San Bernardino areas.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
CALSTART's electric station car and corridor shuttle project introduces
ZEV technology to promote ridership on the regional rail systems
and modal shifts for commuters and midday travelers. One of the
project's goals is to demonstrate an application of ZEV technology
that is integral to multi-modal transportation needs of Southern
Californians.
<P>
CALSTART's project is a cooperative effort among four private
and public entities: CALSTART, a non-profit consortium of advanced
transportation organizations; Omnitrans, the public transit joint
powers authority serving the San Bernardino Valley; the City of
Lancaster, located in northern Los Angeles County; and Southern
California Edison (SCE), the nation's second largest private electric
utility.
<P>
A total of fifteen light-duty electric vehicles will be purchased
and deployed in Lancaster and in the Montclair/San Bernardino
areas. These vehicles will be full service &quot;station cars&quot;
(2- and 4-passenger vehicles) for use by morning and evening rail
commuters and City of Lancaster and Omnitrans staff during the
day. Two 22-foot electric shuttle buses will be purchased and
placed into service on a rail feeder and commercial district corridor
route in San Bernardino.
<P>
The City of Lancaster plans to use the station cars during the
mid-day hours for regular local travel, such as meter reading,
service calls, and other trips required by City employees. Omnitrans
will use the station cars for driver-relief and shift change trips,
between their service yard and the transit stations. The electric
shuttles will operate in a highly-traveled corridor in the commercial
districts in San Bernardino, linking downtown San Bernardino with
the Tri-City Corporate Center and the Inland Center Mall. The
electric shuttles will accommodate daytime shopping trips, lunch
excursions and transportation for other needs in the San Bernardino
corridor.
<P>
CALSTART, Omnitrans, the City of Lancaster, and SCE will work
with Metrolink to target and attract likely station car users
and corridor shuttle riders, through research, outreach, and public
awareness campaigns. SCE will assist with these campaigns by publicizing
the program among its large workforce, which is distributed throughout
the Southern California region. SCE will incorporate the station
car program publicity effort into its existing rideshare/transit
TCM program, providing additional incentives for its employees
to avoid single-occupancy trips in internal combustion engine-powered
vehicles.
<P>
<B>Sole-Source Justification</B> 
<P>
Section II, Step C(3) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure
identifies four provisions under which a sole-source bid may be
justified: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds cost for consultant,
(2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health, (3)
services are only available from sole-source, (4) other circumstances
exist identifying sole-source as in the best interests of the
AQMD.
<P>
This request for sole-source award is made under provision #4.
It is in the AQMD's best interests to accept the EPA funds and
complete the electric station car and corridor shuttle project.
By accepting the funds to complete this comprehensive, multi-agency
project, the AQMD will take full advantage of the unique combination
of experience, facilities, and participants gained during the
project and will be able to provide fleets in the Basin with the
most comprehensive information on the operation of electric station
cars.
<P>
CALSTART is a unique consortium of private companies and government
agencies united to develop advanced transportation technologies
for manufacture within California. Omnitrans operates a fleet
of 130 buses and 88 vans, serving almost 7.5 million passengers
annually. The City of Lancaster was recently designated by the
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) as a &quot;Clean City&quot; and
has developed a comprehensive plan to convert its vehicle fleet
to clean fuels by 2010. SCE is the nation's second largest electric
utility, has one of the nation's best established electric transportation
programs, and is a leader in innovative EV technology testing
and deployment.
<P>
<B>Financial Terms</B> 
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region IX, through its
FY-1995 Environmental Technology Initiative (ETI) grant funds,
awarded $250,000 to the AQMD to co-fund this project. The funding
breakdown for this $1,446,000 project is as follows: <HR>

<CENTER>
<H3>Status Report on Lead Agency Projects and<BR>
Environmental Documents Received by the AQMD </H3>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
This report provides for the Governing Board's consideration a
listing of California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) documents
received by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD)
between September 6, 1995 and October 3, 1995 and those projects
for which the AQMD is acting as lead agency pursuant to CEQA.
<P>
<U>EIR and Document Log (Attachments A and B)</U> 
<P>
Each month, the AQMD receives numerous CEQA documents from other
public agencies on projects which could adversely affect air quality.
In the past, AQMD staff reviewed many of these documents and commented
upon the air quality analyses and possible impacts on the air
quality of the district.
<P>
Due to staffing constraints, the AQMD is no longer able to routinely
comment on the CEQA documents received. The publication of the
Board-approved <I>CEQA Air</I><U> </U><I>Quality Handbook</I>,
however, has provided local governments and other public agencies
with the necessary information to prepare appropriate air quality
analyses on projects for which they act as lead agency. As resources
permit, staff prepares comments for those projects which may have
significant regional air quality impacts (e.g., special event
centers, landfills) and those projects for which a lead or responsible
agency has specifically requested AQMD review. Monthly listings
which are shaded note those CEQA documents for which the AQMD
staff has or will prepare and submit comments to the lead agency.
A list of active projects from previous months upon which AQMD
staff are continuing to comment is included as Attachment B. A
new column has been added to this report in response to Board
member request. The column captioned &quot;contacts&quot; identifies
entities that have contacted the AQMD with comments about the
proposed project. A notation of 1 following the contact indicates
the contact was supportive of the proposed project. A notation
of 2 indicates the party was opposed or expressed concerns about
the project.
<P>
<U>AQMD Lead Agency Projects (Attachment C)</U> 
<P>
Pursuant to CEQA, the AQMD periodically acts as lead agency on
stationary source permit projects. Attachment C to this report
summarizes the active projects for which the AQMD is lead agency
and is currently preparing or has prepared environmental documentation.
<P>
Under CEQA the lead agency is responsible for determining whether
an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) or a Negative Declaration
is necessary for any proposal considered to be a &quot;project&quot;
as defined by CEQA. An EIR is prepared when the AQMD as lead agency
finds substantial evidence that the proposed project may have
a significant adverse effect on the environment. A Negative Declaration
may be prepared if the AQMD determines that the proposed project
will not generate significant adverse environmental impacts. The
Negative Declaration is a written statement describing the reasons
a proposed project will not have a significant adverse effect
on the environment and, therefore, does not require the preparation
of an EIR.
<P>
As noted in Attachment C, during September 1995, the AQMD continued
working on CEQA documents for two (2) active projects. A request
has been received by the AQMD to become lead agency for a proposed
project at the Mobil Oil Refinery in Torrance. A determination
of whether the AQMD will act as lead agency has not yet been made.
<P>
To date in 1995, the AQMD, as lead agency, has prepared or contracted
for the preparation of and certified four (4) CEQA documents.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Receive and file the attached Report.

Program (PTEP), and Recognize Other Co-Sponsors'<BR>
<U>Contributions to PTEP as a Supplement to the FY 1995-96 Budget</U>
 </CENTER></H3>

<P>
The PM10 Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP) is a series of projects
designed to improve ambient databases, emission inventories, and
air quality modeling for the PM10 State Implementation Plan (SIP),
due to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in February 1997.
When the AQMD Governing Board approved the PTEP in December 1994,
co-sponsorships were anticipated from many of the key participants
in the AQMP process. At its July 1995 meeting, the Governing Board
recognized $745,000 in co-sponsorship funds, including $200,000
from the City of Los Angeles (City). At the City's request, a
Memorandum of Understanding has been prepared for execution by
the Governing Board in order for the City to disburse these funds.
In addition, staff recommends that new co-sponsorship funds from
the Western States Petroleum Association ($60,000), CalMat ($250),
and Southern California Rock Products Association ($250) be recognized
as a supplement to the FY 1995-96 Budget.
<P>
Pursuant to the terms of SB1928, the public has been provided
with a 30-day advance notice of the AQMD's intention to supplement
its budget with funds received for the PTEP projects.
<P>
This item was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee
on <BR>
October 27, 1995.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
-- Authorize the Chairman to execute the attached Memorandum of
Understanding with the City of Los Angeles concerning its PTEP
contribution.

At the September 9, 1994 Board meeting, the Board approved awarding
contracts to three companies to assist staff in the review and
data entry of 3300 ATIPs and ATIRs.  The total amount approved
by the Board for this effort was $750,000 which was appropriated
from the Air Toxics Special Revenue Fund.  Subsequent to the Board
approval, the contract work was conducted in two phases on a fixed
price basis.  Phase I was completed on February 28, 1995, and
Phase II commenced on March 1, 1995.  Out of the amount approved,
only $624,352 was encumbered against the three contracts in FY
1994-95.  The remainder of $125,648 was reserved for the review
of additional ATIPs and ATIRs as required.  Since the reserve
was not expended in FY 1994-95, these funds reverted to the Air
Toxics Special Revenue Fund.
<P>
<B>Key Issues</B>
<P>
In addition, staff recently terminated one of the contractors
for poor performance. Therefore, the unspent balance on the contract
of $78,913 has also reverted to the General Fund.
<P>
Since the FY 1994-95 budget is closed, this recommendation is
to authorize re-appropriation of the previously approved funds
($125,648 and $78,913) for completion of the remaining ATIPs and
ATIRs.  Staff will reallocate the work to the remaining two contractors
(AeroVironment, Inc. and Energy and Environmental Research Corporation).
 
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>
This recommendation will not result in a net cost increase, and
the total expenditure will be equal or less than the originally
approved amount of $ 750,000.

<CENTER>
<H3>Recommendation to Release Request for <BR>
<U>Proposals for Telecommunications Services</U> </H3>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
In February 1996, the District's contract with MCI Telecommunications
Corporation for long-distance telephone service will expire. Staff
has prepared a Request for Proposals for Telecommunications Services
to ensure that the District receives the most cost-effective long-distance
service available and to consolidate telephone-related services
to one telecommunications provider. The goal is to reduce current
expenses for voice communication services and optimize the use
of the installed voice communications network. Telecommunication
services solicited under this RFP include local- and long-distance
voice service; 800-line services; and leased lines with several
additional services such as enhanced billing, voice traffic analysis,
voice network optimization, automatic attendants, voice response
systems, call detail reporting, microwave radio traffic optimization,
directory publication and access, video teleconferencing, and
telecommuting support systems.
<P>
Staff is recommending approval for release of the attached RFP
so that a competitive long-distance telephone provider can be
identified before the current service contract ends. Funds have
been allocated in the FY1995-96 Budget to purchase these long-distance
services. This item was reviewed and approved by the Administrative
Committee on October 27, 1995.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Approve the release of RFP #9596-26 entitled &quot;Request for
Proposals for Telecommunication Services.&quot;

<CENTER>
<H3>Recommendation to Lease<BR>
Business Computer Hardware and Software </H3>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
On June 9, 1995, the Board approved the release of Request for
Proposal (RFP) #9495-39 for new business computer hardware and
software to replace the District's Data General Aviion Computers
and to evaluate the feasibility of replacing the Ingres database
software, as recommended by KPMG-Peat Marwick in their most recent
triennial performance audit. A public notice inviting bids was
published in accordance with the District's Consultant Selection
Policy and Procedure. The RFP was mailed to 66 vendors.
<P>
Five responses to the hardware portion of the RFP were received
(Attachment A). These were evaluated and rated by a selection
committee in accordance with the evaluation criteria specified
in the RFP. The computer hardware was evaluated on configuration,
future expandability, company stability, annual maintenance cost,
and overall system performance. Overall system performance was
the most critical selection criteria and was determined by benchmarking
District-supplied programs. The Digital computer solution proposed
by Mikon Computer Systems had the best overall performance of
all systems proposed, with the lowest commensurate cost-per-unit
performance increase. Based on the results of the evaluation (Attachment
B), staff recommends executing a four-year lease with Mikon Computer
Systems through American Technology Credit for Digital computer
hardware at a monthly lease cost of $16,632.91, with a total cost
of $798,379.80 over the four-year period. The recommended business
computer system will allow effective deployment of systems to
support currently defined programs such as Title V, RECLAIM, etc.
<P>
Two vendors submitted proposals for relational database software
(Attachment A). A comparison of features, functionality, third-party
product support, data integrity and data security, ease of application
development, and cost showed that Oracle currently has an edge
over Ingres. However, the costs associated with converting existing
District software applications from Ingres to Oracle is estimated
at $1,600,000. Ingres' newly released product, &quot;Open Ingres&quot;,
incorporates many functional and performance enhancements contained
in Oracle and closes the gap on some of the differences identified
between the two products. Therefore, based on cost considerations,
staff recommends executing a four-year lease with Computer Associates
for Ingres relational database software with an upgrade to &quot;Open
Ingres&quot; at an annual cost of $108,759.
<P>
To initiate these leases, $200,000 is included in the Information
Management FY 1995-96 approved budget. Approximately $300,000
will be budgeted annually through FY 1999-2000 to cover the remainder
of the leases.
<P>
This project was presented to the Administrative Committee and
was approved at its meeting on October 27, 1995.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Approve a four-year lease for Digital Computer Hardware through
American Technology Credit for an amount not to exceed $798,379.80.
<P>
--Approve a four-year lease for Ingres relational database software
with an upgrade to &quot;Open Ingres&quot; with Computer Associates
for an amount not to exceed $435,036.

<P>
AGENDA NO. 27
<P>
PROPOSAL:
<P>
<B>Recommendation to Prequalify Providers of Temporary Employment
Services</B> 
<P>
SYNOPSIS:
<P>
On June 8, 1995, the Board approved the release of a Request for
Proposals (RFP) to solicit interest from temporary employment
services providers in being prequalified to provide AQMD temporary
employment services through the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 1996-97.
This recommendation is to obtain Board approval for this prequalification.
<P>
COMMITTEE:
<P>
Administrative, October 27, 1995, Approved
<P>
RECOMMENDED ACTION
<P>
1. Approve the list of temporary employment services providers,
included as Attachment B, as prequalified to provide temporary
employment services through the end of FY 1996-97.
<P>
James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<P>
Executive Officer
<P>
_____________________________________________________________________
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
On March 10, 1995, the Board received and filed a report outlining
administrative policy and procedure changes made by the Executive
Officer relating to the purchase of nonconsultant services and
supplies. One of these changes was a requirement for establishing,
through Board approval, a list of prequalified vendors of such
services and supplies. Under the new policy, temporary employment
services vendors are to be prequalifed for a period of two fiscal
years.
<P>
On June 8, 1995, the Board authorized release of an RFP soliciting
interest from temporary employment services providers in being
prequalified to provide temporary employment services beginning
the date of Board approval through the end of FY 1996-97. Notice
of the release was placed in the following publications: <I>Los
Angeles Times, Orange County Register, San Bernardino Sun, Riverside
Press Enterprise, La Opinion., Los Angeles Sentinel, M/W/DVBE
Source, El Chicano, Inland Empire Hispanic News, Precinct Reporter,
and Black Voice</I>. Thirty six proposals were received expressing
vendor interest in providing temporary employment services in
at least one of the five job categories specified in the RFP.
<P>
<B>Proposal Evaluation</B> 
<P>
A panel of five raters, including two from outside SCAQMD, evaluated
the proposals using criteria specified in the RFP. Proposals that
failed to receive the required minimum of 70 points in the technical
qualifications portion of the evaluation were not allowed to proceed
to further steps of the evaluation process, as required by rating
criteria stated in the RFP. Rating scores by job category for
each agency determined to be technically qualified are provided
in Attachment A. Staff is recommending temporary agencies rated
as meeting the technical qualifications criteria of the RFP be
prequalified by the Board. The benefits of such prequalification
are twofold. AQMD would have as a much-needed resource a pool
of qualified agencies from whom cost-competitive bids could be
solicited when temporary employees are needed. Further, it would
benefit the business community by maximizing opportunities for
temporary agencies--many of whom are minority- or woman-owned
businesses and all of whom meet AQMD's criterion for being classified
as a local business enterprise. Attachment B contains the list,
for each job category, of agencies recommended for prequalification
by the Board.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
There are no direct resource impacts relating to the prequalification
of temporary employment services providers since the amount allocated
for temporary employment services is approved by the Board as
part of the AQMD budget process.
<P>
When temporary staffing is needed during the two-year life of
the prequalified vendor list, the AQMD will request competitive
bids from all prequalified agencies listed in the respective job
category. Final selection will be made based on the cost to the
AQMD, the fit between job skills of temporary personnel provided
by the agency and AQMD staffing needs, the level of pay provided
the temporary employee, and the ability of the agency to provide
any related services that might be needed.

<P>
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
<P>
1. Approve the attached report.
<P>
Candace Haggard, Chairperson
<P>
Mobile Source Committee
<P>
(BRW:CLW::WL:AS)
<P>
<B>TOPICS</B> 
<P>
<B>1. Legislative Update</B> 
<P>
Staff highlighted the status of the legislation pertaining to
trip reduction and distributed an updated legislative report <B>(Attachments
II and III)</B>.
<P>
<B>2. Outcome of Outreach Efforts</B>:
<P>
<B>Rule 1501.1 Public Briefing and Technologies Demonstration</B>

<P>
Over 200 persons attended the public briefing held on September
15, 1995 that provided information on the implementation procedures
developed for Rule 1501.1, Alternatives to Work Trip Reduction
Plans. At the briefing, staff presented the new registration forms
and worksheets, and discussed the procedural requirements to participate
in Rule 1501.1. In addition, vendors of technologies that can
be used as compliance alternatives to Rule 1501 gave a brief overview
of their products and services and were available for individual
discussions. Two remote sensing units were operating on site,
four old-vehicle scrapping firms were represented and alternative
fuel vehicles were displayed.
<P>
<B>Parking Management Symposium</B> 
<P>
The AQMD sponsored an all-day Parking Management Symposium on
<BR>
September 29, 1995. Staff is preparing a Parking Management Guide
to be used by special event centers, regional shopping centers,
and airports on a voluntary basis. The Guide will summarize parking
management and other strategies that reduce congestion, vehicle
trips and emissions. Suggestions from speakers and attendees will
be incorporated into the Guide.
<P>
<B>Rule 1501.1 Local Government Briefing</B> 
<P>
The purpose of the October 6 briefing was to provide specific
information to local governments on the implementation procedures
developed for Rule 1501.1, to highlight the Air Quality Investment
Program, and to illustrate the benefits resulting from the alternatives.
Boardmember Nell Soto introduced the various elected officials
present. Two panelists representing the cities of Alhambra and
Redondo Beach shared their experiences regarding alternative emission
reduction strategies.
<P>
<B>3. Rule 1501/1501.1/ISRs Activity Report</B> 
<P>
Staff distributed an updated activity report <B>(Attachment IV)</B>.
<P>
<B>4. Rule 1501.1 Air Quality Investment Fund</B> 
<P>
<B>Proposal Recommendations</B> 
<P>
Staff distributed copies and gave an overview of Air Quality Investment
<BR>
Program (AQIP) proposals<B> (Attachment V).</B> There is currently
$489,000 in the investment fund. Staff stated that 45 worksites
having an aggregate number of 4,448 employees contributed to this
fund. Eight proposals were received in response to the AQIP Request
for Proposals (RFP) released on September 29, 1995. These proposals
include: car scrapping, alternative fuel vehicle deploy-ment,
transit improvement, and an infrastructure project. These proposals
should demonstrate that emissions reductions/air quality improvements
are real, surplus, quantifiable, and contain appropriate methodologies.
<P>
Staff stated that the funding recommendations are just in the
preliminary stages and three options were proposed for consideration
and comment. At the<BR>
November 17, 1995 Governing Board meeting, staff will seek approval
for funding those proposals that are cost-effective and achieve
equivalent emission reductions to Rule 1501 implementation.
<P>
<B>5. Status Report on Rule 2202 Emission Reduction Options</B>

<P>
<B>for Employee Commuting (New Rule)</B> 
<P>
Staff has prepared a draft letter for committee review, containing
a policy up-date on rideshare plans. The letter describes the
outcome of the October 13, 1995 Board meeting regarding Rules
1501 and 1501.1, and the development of a new replacement rule
(Attachment VI). The letter will be mailed to Chief Executive
Officers, Employee Transportation Coordinators, transportation
management associations, local jurisdictions, training providers
and consultants. The committee asked for several clarifications
to be made to the letter before mailing.
<P>
A presentation was made by staff on Rule 2202 that is under development.
Copies of the overheads for this presentation were distributed.
Staff indicated that this presentation was preliminary and the
draft rule is subject to the review of the District's legal staff.
The intent of the proposed Rule 2202 (On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation
Options) is to develop a new emission reductions regulation to
replace Rules 1501 and 1501.1 with a menu of options for employers
that include old vehicle scrapping, remote sensing, an air quality
investment fund and optional traditional ridesharing actions.
This new rule will continue to apply to worksites with 100 or
more employees and will be rescinded upon adoption of a market
pricing strategy or other emission equivalent measure. The key
proposed changes are: Reg. XIII emission reduction credits generated
after January 1, 1996; credit for reduction of vehicle miles traveled
(VMT); air quality investment fund expanded to employers with
100 - 500 employees with options for a 1-year or 3-year payment;
voluntary update training; 3-year plan review cycle; and abbreviated
annual analysis. Public consultation meetings will be held in
the four counties and will be scheduled for November, 1995. Public
hearing and Board adoption is scheduled for December 8, 1995.
The scheduled date of implementation is January 1, 1996.
<P>
<B>6. Update on Intercredit Trading Study</B> 
<P>
Intercredit trading is based on the concept of allowing mobile
and stationary sources to trade emission credits. Copies of the
overheads for this presentation were distributed <B>(Attachment
VII)</B>. The program goals include: equivalent emission reductions;
lower overall costs; more open trading; minimal trading restrictions;
credits that are real, quantifiable, verifiable, and surplus;
minimal government involvement during transactions; enforceable
credits use; and<BR>
incentives for advanced clean technologies. Phase I of this study
includes distribution of an Issues White Paper <B>(Attachment
XIII)</B>. This paper assesses intercredit trading within the
District's existing regulatory program with an emphasis on providing
additional compliance flexibility and cost savings as well as
added incentives for technological advancement.
<P>
<B>7. Status Report on REACH Task Force</B> 
<P>
The purpose of the Reduce Emissions and Congestion on Highway
(REACH) Task Force is to determine market-based approaches to
reduce traffic congestion and mobile source emissions instead
of relying on more traditional methods. The Advisory Committee
discussed the identified transportation pricing options: fuel
tax increase, congestion pricing, flat VMT fee, and Emissions/VMT
fee. The immediate task is to select a &quot;short list&quot;
of pricing strategies on which the consultants can perform detailed
analyses. To help the committee in making an informed decision,
staff asked the consultants to provide information on elasticity
curves, pricing changes and emission reduction potential of the
various pricing strategies. These preliminary estimates are based
wholly on the pricing elasticities contained in the Deakin/Harvey/Skardonis
report prepared for ARB.
<P>
Board Member Haggard inquired if the committee has discussed revenue
neutrality or revenue generation and, congestion management versus
air quality improvement. Staff responded that since many of these
options have equity implications, another REACH meeting will be
dedicated to discussing the equity effects.
<P>
It was also noted that the Steering Committee discussed technologies
involved in vehicle-to-roadside communications (VRC). Current
VRC technology has the capability to provide two-way communication
which can not only assist in congestion management projects, but
can also add value to the vehicle user in the form of timely travel
and other related information.
<P>
<B>8. Status Report on PM10 Task Force</B> 
<P>
Staff gave an overview on the topics discussed on the PM10 Task
Force meeting, including: health issues, PTEP funding status,
PTEP project status, Cut-Smog Program, and PM10 Plan Timelines
<B>(Attachment IX)</B>.
<P>
<B>9. EIR Review and Preparation</B> 
<P>
Staff distributed an updated EIR report<B> (Attachment X)</B>.
<P>
<B>10. Public Comment</B> 
<P>
There were no public comments.
<P>
<B>11. Other Business</B> 
<P>
Boardmember Ron Loveridge suggested that the committee should
meet and discuss further the mechanics of proposed Rule 2202 before
bringing it to the Governing Board for public hearing and adoption
on December 8, 1995. Therefore, the next meeting is dedicated
to Rule 2202 and is scheduled for Monday, November 27, 1995 at
10:00 a.m. in Room CC8.

South Coast Air Quality

Management District Board
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Public Hearing to<BR>
Amend Rule 102 - Definition of Terms </H3>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
<U>INTRODUCTION</U> 
<P>
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California
Air Resources Board (ARB) have determined that acetone, ethane,
parachloro-benzotrifluoride (PCBTF), and volatile methylated siloxanes
(VMS) have negligible photochemical reactivity and should be considered
exempt compounds. The South Coast Air Quality Management District
(AQMD) is therefore proposing to include these materials in the
definition of Exempt Compounds in Rule 102 - Definition of Terms.
The AQMD also proposes to add minor clarifying language, including
definitions of Executive Officer and particulate matter of 10
microns or less (PM10).
<P>
The proposed amendment of the exempt compound definition in Rule
102 will supersede all exempt volatile organic compound (VOC)
definitions in all other AQMD regulations including, but not limited
to, Regulations III, IV, XI, and XIII; however, the proposed changes
will have no impact on existing emission limits.
<P>
The AQMD received tremendous interest regarding the addition of
these materials to the exempt compound list, mostly from companies
manufacturing paints, coatings, and solvents as well as the aerospace,
wood furniture, paper coating, and foam blowing industries. Although
a public workshop was not required, AQMD staff did contact interested
parties to request comments and answer questions.
<P>
EPA requested public input regarding their proposed exemption
of these materials on several occasions during the last two years.
The supporting EPA documents for VMS and PCBTF contained no public
opposition (40 CFR Part 51 Vol. 59, No. 192, effective December
5, 1994). Fifty-two public comments were received for acetone
(40 CFR Part 51 Vol. 60, No. 116, effective June 16, 1995), and
80 percent of them were in favor of the exemption proposal. The
negative comments came from industries that developed low solvent
technologies and from individuals who felt acetone was too reactive
to be considered exempt. EPA responded that acetone has negligible
reactivity and this proposal does not restrict the use of other
low-solvent technologies. In addition, EPA documents report that
all four materials have virtually zero stratospheric ozone depletion
potential and insignificant global warming potential.
<P>
<U>DISCUSSION</U> 
<P>
Acetone, PCBTF, and VMS are estimated to replace up to four tons
per day of compounds that are photochemically reactive, nine tons
per day of ozone depleting compounds (ODC), and one ton per day
of toxics. These replaced compounds include ketones, toluene,
xylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, perchloroethylene, and methylene
chloride. Ethane will not serve as a replacement material for
other compounds and its current use should not be impacted. The
primary sources of ethane emissions are refineries and natural-gas-handling
facilities. Ethane is not commercially available in the United
States.
<P>
Acetone is expected to be used as a replacement for solvents used
in coating, hand wiping, stripping, and surface cleaning operations,
and as a blowing agent in foam manufacturing. Acetone is volatile,
odorous, and flammable, but is relatively inexpensive at $2.10
a gallon. A potential concern with acetone is its ability in high
concentrations to be a precursor to the formation of formaldehyde.
Both EPA and ARB staff anticipate, however, that the substitution
of acetone may reduce formaldehyde concentrations because acetone
is less reactive than the materials it will replace, such as toluene
and xylene. ARB plans to sample acetone concentrations at their
six monitoring stations located in the AQMD to determine if any
emission increase occurs.
<P>
VMS is a class of compounds currently consisting of 14 materials
of which six are commercially available. VMS is flammable and
costly, at a current price of $65 a gallon. It is a potential
replacement for ODC and VOC materials in paints, consumer products,
and cold solvent cleaning.
<P>
PCBTF is also costly at $21 a gallon. It is flammable, odorous,
and moderately toxic. Cal/EPA's Office of Environmental Health
Hazard Assessment has determined, however, that its toxic impacts
are not expected to result in specific health effects. Current
PCBTF toxicity data on humans is subject to further study. PCBTF
is a potential replacement for ODC and VOC materials in paints,
consumer products, and cold solvent cleaning.
<P>
The Exempt Compounds definition divides materials into Groups
I and II. Both Groups I and II include exempt compounds of VOC,
but Group II compounds are either toxic, potentially toxic, upper-atmosphere
ozone depleters, or cause other environmental impacts. Acetone
and ethane, are proposed to be placed in Group I. Information
received by the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment
after the proposed amended rule was set for hearing indicates
that additional toxicity testing of VMS and PCBTF is preferred.
Based on this data, staff believes that these compounds are better
placed in Group II of the Exempt Compounds definition.
<P>
The proposed amendments will encourage current users of known
toxic and reactive VOC to switch to the four compounds. The majority
of the switches will be to acetone because of its lower price.
Thus, there will be savings to the affected facilities. On the
other hand, the switches will lower the AQMD's revenue from emission
fees assuming Rule 301 is amended to comport with this change.
Therefore, the amendments to this rule are a cost-effective alternative
since the proposed changes are not mandatory.<!--place this paragraph near the end of the Board letter-->

<P>
<U>CONCLUSION</U> 
<P>
Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and
the AQMD's Certified Regulatory Program (Rule 110), the AQMD has
prepared appropriate CEQA documentation for the proposed amendments
consisting of a Draft Environmental Assessment (EA). The Draft
EA was released for public review and comment from September 20,
1995 through October 20, 1995. The Final EA includes responses
to all comments received on the Draft EA. The Final Staff Report,
Final Socioeconomic Assessment, and Final EA are attached.
<P>
THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Amend Rule 102 - Definition of Terms, as proposed, in accordance
with the attached Resolution; and
<P>
--Certify the Environmental Assessment for Proposed Amended Rule
102 - Definition of Terms.

BOARD MEETING
<P>
DATE: November 17, 1995
<P>
AGENDA NO. ____41___
<P>
PROPOSAL:
<P>
<B>Adopt Rule 2100 - Registration of Portable Equipment</B> 
<P>
SYNOPSIS:
<P>
The proposed rule would establish an inter-district registration
program for certain portable equipment. The public hearing in
July was continued after public testimony identified a number
of issues, including Assembly Bill 531, that would directly affect
the program. Staff has clarified language in the rule on filing
for registration and in the staff report on the definition of
a project. Internal combustion engines used on marine dredges
have been added as an eligible source. In addition, staff proposes
the rule to be an interim measure for internal combustion engines
until state regulations for these sources go into effect.
<P>
RECOMMENDED ACTION:
<P>
1. Certify the Final Environmental Assessment for Proposed Rule
2100 - Registration of Portable Equipment, as proposed, in accordance
with the attached Resolution.
<P>
2. Adopt Rule 2100 - Registration of Portable Equipment.
<P>
James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<P>
Executive Officer<HR>

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
At your July Board meeting, Proposed Rule 2100 - Registration
of Portable Equipment was considered for adoption. Based on the
testimony received, the hearing was continued pending the fate
of State Assembly Bill 531 (Morrissey, AB 531). The bill establishes
a statewide registration program for portable internal combustion
engines (ICE) to be administered by the state board. It has been
enacted and the state board will have until January 1, 1997 to
adopt regulations to implement the legislation.
<P>
At your October Board meeting, the Board approved staff's request
for a continuance to November 17 to work with industry and other
districts to resolve the issues on AB 531.
<P>
Accordingly, staff has sent a survey form to 12 districts that
have either adopted or have been considering adoption of an equivalent
portable equipment registration rule regarding their intended
participation in the program in light of the enactment of AB 531.
The results of the survey show that, out of 12 districts, five
are planning to participate in a statewide portable equipment
registration, at least until state regulation becomes effective,
three are not planning to participate, and four are undecided.
Also, staff held a meeting with a small group of industry representatives
on October 5, 1995, and a public consultation meeting on October
10, 1995 to brief them and receive any additional comments on
Proposed Rule 2100.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
As a result of discussions with industry representatives and the
enactment of AB 531, s
<P>
taff recommends the following revisions to Proposed Rules 2100:
<UL>
<LI>Remove the exclusion of marine dredges in subdivision (b)
- Applicability;
<LI>Delete the definitions of &quot;Existing Emissions Unit&quot;
and &quot;New Emissions Unit&quot;;
<LI>Register engines permitted in the AQMD that were in operation
prior to June 3, 1988, if 500 BHP or less, and October 8, 1976,
if greater than 500 BHP, without addition of new daily emission
limits;
<LI>End the registration program for ICE on August 1, 1997, or
30 calendar days after the date the state registration program
pursuant to AB 531 takes effect, whichever comes sooner; and
<LI>Revise the definition of &quot;Location&quot; to clearly define
the location for emissions units used in maintenance activities.
</UL>

<P>
The revisions will not cause any substantial impact.
<P>
<B>Policy Issues</B> 
<P>
Staff has addressed the concerns raised by industry representatives
and the public in Appendix A of the Addendum to the Staff Report
for Proposed Rule 2100. Major issues are included in Attachment
A - Summary of Additional Public Comments and AQMD Responses.
<P>
<B>AQMP &amp; Legal Mandates</B> 
<P>
The proposed rule incorporates AQMD rules applicable to the proposed
source categories. The registered equipment must meet the requirements
of current Best Availble Control Technology (BACT) and source-specific
rules, which are specified in this rule. The emission reductions
from regulating these sources under the proposed rule will be
the same as those under the current AQMD permit system. The economic
growth projected in the Air Quality Management Plan for the affected
source categories is sufficient to cover the emission increases
from the registered equipment. Additionally, registered equipment
is exempt from the equivalency demonstration for state purposes
and is below the offset thresholds of federal regulations.
<P>
<B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B> 
<P>
Pursuant to the AQMD's Certified Regulatory Program (Rule 110),
AQMD has prepared the appropriate California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA) document, consisting of a Draft Environmental Assessment
(EA). The Draft EA identified potential adverse environmental
impacts that may result from adopting the proposed project and
identified measures to mitigate impacts to the maximum extent
feasible. The Draft EA was circulated for a 45-day public review
from May 10, 1995 through June 29, 1995. The Final EA includes
responses to all comments received on the Draft EA. A socioeconomic
analysis is included in the Staff Report.
<P>
A Statement of Findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations
regarding potential significant adverse air quality impacts that
may result from adopting Rule 2100 have been prepared pursuant
to state CEQA Guidelines and AQMD CEQA Guidelines. These Statements
are included as an attachment to the Board Resolution. A mitigation
monitoring and reporting plan was also prepared pursuant to Public
Resources Code 21081.6. Staff has determined that the modifications
to the proposed rule are within the scope of the Draft EA and
will not result in any significant adverse environmental impacts.
<P>
<B>Implementation Plan</B> 
<P>
Staff will continue working with CAPCOA to streamline registration
processing, notify those sources affected by Proposed Rule 2100,
and, if necessary, provide assistance to those sources.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
Two Full Time Employees (FTE) are needed for startup and permitting.
One FTE is needed for the first two years, and one-fourth of an
FTE is needed for the following years, for ongoing monitoring,
reporting, and processing the additional applications. Resources
will be reallocated internally to meet FTE needs.

<H3>Public Hearing to Amend Rule 431.1 -<BR>
<U>Sulfur Content of Gaseous Fuels</U> </H3>

<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
<U>Introduction</U> 
<P>
The purpose of Rule 431.1 - Sulfur Content of Gaseous Fuels, is
to reduce sulfur oxides (SOx) emissions from combustion of gaseous
fuels. SOx emissions result in, or contribute to, the formation
of air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), sulfates (SO4)
and particulate matters (PM10), for which ambient air quality
standards have been adopted. SOx emission reductions from this
rule support the South Coast Air Quality Management District's
(AQMD's) efforts in demonstrating progress towards attainment
or maintenance of ambient air quality standards for these pollutants.
<P>
Facilities subject to Rule 431.1 generally include refineries,
utilities, oil and gas production facilities, sewage treatment
plants and landfills. Rule 431.1 sets limits for sulfur in gaseous
fuels burned in stationary combustion equipment operated at these
facilities. Rule 431.1 was originally adopted in November 1977
and has subsequently been amended a number of times to implement
additional Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) control measures
reflecting advances in control technology and to extend compliance
deadlines, when necessary.
<P>
<U>Regulatory History</U> 
<P>
Prior to a January 1982 amendment, the rule had limits for total
sulfur of 80 parts per million (ppm) for some gaseous fuels sold
and 800 ppm for gaseous fuels burned on-site. In January 1982,
Rule 431.1 was amended to expand the coverage of the rule to limit
total sulfur for biogases (sewage digester and landfill gases)
sold or burned on-site to 250 ppm and 800 ppm, respectively.
<P>
In May 1990, Rule 431.1 was amended to implement an additional
AQMP control measure by providing a single total sulfur limit
of 40 ppm for all gaseous fuels sold or burned with a final compliance
date of May 4, 1992. The amendment also included a requirement
to install and properly operate a continuous monitor to measure
total sulfur in the fuel or total SOx emissions at the stack.
Because of the unavailability of the continuous total sulfur monitors,
the rule was once more amended in October 1992, to extend the
compliance date for all gaseous fuels to May 4, 1994. Also, because
of the economic impact that the 40 ppm limit would impose on small
refiners, the amendment included an extension of the final compliance
date for small refiners to May 4, 1996.
<P>
Not all of the facilities subject to Rule 431.1 complied with
the sulfur limit requirements in effect prior to the final compliance
date of May 1994. With the adoption of the Regional Clean Air
Incentives Market (RECLAIM) program in October of 1993, facilities
which were included in the RECLAIM SOx universe did not have to
comply with certain command-and-control regulations, such as Rule
431.1. The RECLAIM SOx facilities that were no longer subject
to Rule 431.1 mainly included refineries. However, with the exception
of certain landfills, all other non-RECLAIM SOx facilities are
presently in compliance with the existing requirements of Rule
431.1.
<P>
<U>Proposed Amendments</U> 
<P>
A number of concerns have arisen in the course of implementing
the most recent amendments to Rule 431.1. First, as the May 1994
final compliance date approached, cost-effective control technologies
to remove sulfur compounds from landfill gas were not available.
Thus, not all of the landfills could comply with the 40 ppm total
sulfur limit. Landfill facilities requested additional time to
investigate the feasibility and cost effectiveness of various
control technologies to remove or control sulfur compounds present
in landfill gas. This resulted in variance proceedings for several
of the landfill facilities. These variances were granted and are
in most part due to expire at the end of this year. Staff recommends
that Rule 431.1 be amended to provide additional time for affected
facilities to meet the 40 ppm total sulfur limit.
<P>
Second, with refineries now under RECLAIM, they are no longer
subject to certain command-and-control rules, such as Rule 431.1.
However, some refineries sell gaseous fuels to non-RECLAIM SOx
facilities. The seller is not prohibited from selling its fuel
gas, but Rule 431.1 does not allow the non-RECLAIM SOx facility
to buy and/or burn this non-compliant gas in its equipment. Therefore,
both RECLAIM and non-RECLAIM sources have requested an exemption
to allow the non-RECLAIM sources to continue to purchase and burn
such non-compliant gas. Staff agrees and recommends that Rule
431.1 be amended to allow for this sale, purchase and use of non-compliant
gas.
<P>
Third, the sewage treatment and landfill facilities requested
additional flexibility to comply with the rule by increasing the
averaging period for total sulfur limit. Since the existing rule
has a four-hour average sulfur limit, short term variations in
biogas production could result in non-compliance periods. The
increased averaging period will allow the facilities to better
handle variations in the sulfur levels in biogases produced during
process upsets and could result in potential cost savings. Staff
agrees and recommends that Rule 431.1 be amended to increase the
sulfur limit averaging period.
<P>
Finally, the October 1992 amendment included an extension of the
compliance date for small refiners from May 1994 to May 1996.
During rule development for that amendment an interim sulfur limit
was inadvertently omitted. This current amendment rectifies that
omission by incorporating it into this proposal.
<P>
The main changes to Rule 431.1 are summarized as follows:
<UL>
<LI>a three-year extension of the final compliance date for landfill
facilities to July 1997, and incorporation of an interim daily
limit of 150 ppm sulfur for landfill gas;
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>increased averaging period for biogases from four hours to
daily;
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>option to comply with a monthly averaging period for biogases
with a total sulfur cap of 200 ppm for landfill gas and 500 ppm
for sewage digester gas along with continuous monitoring to determine
the total sulfur in the fuel gas, or total SOx from the stack;
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>option to allow facilities which burn gaseous fuels in two
or more different pieces of equipment to comply with the sulfur
limit on the aggregate within the facility, rather than for individual
pieces of equipment in which the fuel is burned;
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>an 18-month extension in the compliance schedule for facilities
that were previously exempt or were previously in compliance,
but because of changes in gas production rate or gas quality,
would now have to control sulfur compounds in the gaseous fuel
in order to comply with the rule requirements;
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>quality assurance/quality control requirements for continuous
monitors used to demonstrate compliance with the rule;
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>an exemption for facilities subject to the requirements of
this rule to allow them to buy and burn non-compliant fuel gas
from a RECLAIM SOx facility, provided that all of the SOx emissions
generated from the burning of the subject fuel are reported as
SOx emissions from the RECLAIM SOx facility; and
</UL>

<LI>a guideline for approval of alternative monitoring plans.
</UL>

<P>
Other proposed changes are minor and are added to clarify and
improve the enforceability of the rule.
<P>
<U>CEQA and Socioeconomic Analyses</U> 
<P>
Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the
AQMD prepared a Draft Supplemental Environmental Assessment (EA)
to the March 1990 EA for Rule 431.1 - Sulfur Content of Gaseous
Fuels, and Rule 431.2 - Sulfur Content of Liquid Fuels, for the
proposed amendments to Rule 431.1. The Draft Supplemental EA was
circulated for a 45-day public review and comment period, which
ended September 1, 1995. There were no comments received on the
Draft Supplemental EA. The Final Supplemental EA is included in
this Final Rule Package.
<P>
Due to the bulk of the previously prepared CEQA documents for
Rule 431.1, the previous CEQA documents have been distributed
to Board members only. Those wishing to view the referenced previous
CEQA documents may do so by contacting the AQMD's Public Information
Center at (909) 396-3600.
<P>
In addition, the AQMD prepared a Draft Socioeconomic Assessment
as part of the draft staff report, which addresses the socioeconomic
impacts of the proposed amendments to Rule 431.1. The Final Socioeconomic
Assessment is included as part of the final staff report.
<P>
Two public workshops were held for the proposed amendments to
Rule 431.1 on April 28, 1995 and July 5, 1995. The Public Hearing
to amend Rule 431.1 was originally set on August 11, 1995 for
adoption on October 13, 1995. As per the Governing Board's request
at the October 13, 1995 meeting, the Public Hearing was extended
to November 17, 1995.
<P>
As per the Notice of Public Hearing, written comments were accepted
through August 29, 1995. All written comments received by that
date were reviewed and responded to by staff in the final staff
report which is part of this Public Hearing package for the rule
amendment. As a result of the comments received on the proposed
rule, staff now proposes additional changes to Proposed Amended
Rule 431.1. In addition, since the October 13, 1995 Governing
Board meeting, in response to further comments and for the purposes
of clarification, a number of non-substantive changes have been
made to the rule language. The latest changes since the October
13, 1995 final Board package are shown with double underlines
and italic strikethroughs in the proposed rule language. All of
the changes, however, are administrative in nature and do not
affect either the CEQA or Socioeconomic Assessment which were
done without an assessment of these minor changes.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Certify the Final Supplemental Environmental Assessment for
the proposed amendments to Rule 431.1 - Sulfur Content of Gaseous
Fuels, in accordance with the attached Resolution.
<P>
--Amend Rule 431.1 - Sulfur Content of Gaseous Fuels as proposed
in accordance with the attached Resolution.

<P>
<U>For December 7, 1995:</U> 
<P>
<B>5. Adopt Proposed Rule 518.2 - Federal Alternative Operating
Conditions </B>(Leyden)(909) 396-3120<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:pleyden@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
( pleyden@aqmd.gov )
<P>
<I>Proposed Rule 518.2 - Federal Alternative Operating Conditions
(AOC), establishes procedures by which owners/operators of Title
V facilities seeking a variance from AQMD or state rules may obtain
an AOC from the Hearing Board that would be recognized by the
EPA. Five major issues are addressed in the proposed rule: 1)
federal recognition of variances through the approval of this
rule; 2) creation of a SIP Allowance Bank for variances; 3) content
of AOC; 4) public participation; and 5) mitigation of excess emissions.</I>

<P>
<B>6. <A HREF="951106.html">Amend Rule 1134 - Emission of Oxides of Nitrogen from Stationary Gas Turbines </A>(Coy)
(909) 396-2434<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:ccoy@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
(ccoy@aqmd.gov )</B> 
<P>
<I>The proposed amended Rule 1134 will address SIP recommendations
identified by U.S. EPA and will give two gas-fired turbines owned
and operated by The Gas Company in the SEDAB an extension of time
to allow developing dry-low NOx turbine technology to become field
ready to meet the rule's requirements. This amendment would delay
NOx emission reductions in the SEDAB. In addition, the amendment
includes minor modifications for administrative purposes.</I>

<P>
<B>7. <A HREF="951107.html">Rescind Rule 1129 - Aerosol Coatings and Amend Rules 1106.1 - Pleasure Craft Coating Operations; 1107 </A>-
Coating of Metal Parts and Products; 1128 - Paper, Fabric, and
Film Coating Operations; 1130 - Graphic Arts; 1145 - Plastic,
Rubber, and Glass Coatings; and 1151 - Motor Vehicle and Mobile
Equipment Non-Assembly Line Coating Operations</B> (Broadbent)

<A HREF="mailto: jbroadbent@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
(jbroadbent@aqmd.gov)
<P>
<I>The rescinding of Rule 1129 and proposed amendment of the other
coating rules are necessary to make AQMD rules consistent with
Section 41712 of the state Health and Safety Code which prohibits
local districts from enforcing or regulating VOC limits on aerosol
coatings. In addition, the proposed amendment of the definition
of &quot;exempt compounds&quot; in each rule will reference Rule
102 - Definition of Terms, to provide a consistent definition
between rules.</I> 
<P>
<B>8. <A HREF="951108.html">Adopt Proposed Rule 118 - Emergencies </A>(Liu)
(909) 396-2105</B> 
<P>
<I>The proposed rule is in response to public concern regarding
the potential need for emergency support, extended hours of operation,
or additional equipment not permitted by the AQMD in the event
of a State of Emergency. The proposed rule will allow the Executive
Officer the discretion to suspend AQMD rules and regulations in
the event of a Governor-declared State of Emergency. The suspension
would be specific to the needs and circumstances of the emergency
and may apply only to specific areas of the SCAB. This item was
reviewed and approved by the Stationary Source Committee on <BR>
October 27, 1995.</I> 
<P>
<B>9. Amend Regulation XX - Regional Clean Air Incentive Market
(RECLAIM)</B> (Leyden)(909) 396-3120<BR>
<A NAME="DDE_LINK1"></A><A HREF="mailto:pleyden@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
( pleyden@aqmd.gov )
<P>
<I>The proposed amendments will make changes suggested by EPA
to receive SIP approval. Issues include: definitions, variances,
NSR, Executive Officer discretion, test methods, and Economic
Incentive Program showings. The proposal also reviews technologies
for glass melting furnaces, gray portland cement kilns, steel
slab reheating, metal melting furnaces, and hot mix asphalt. Revisions
will be proposed for year 2000 emission factors for some of these
industries. Additionally, staff has made rule clarifications and
</I>
<P>
<I>proposed two exemptions from RECLAIM for ski resorts and San
Clemente Island.</I>

<P>
<I>At its October 13, 1995 meeting, the Board directed staff to
return in December with a new rule designed to replace Rules 1501
- Work Trip Reduction Plans and Rule 1501.1 - Alternatives to
Work Trip Reduction Plans. Proposed Rule 2202 would provide employers
with a menu of emission reduction options, which employers can
choose to reduce mobile source emissions in order to meet their
site-specific emission reduction target. The proposed rule would
also include optional participation in an Air Quality Investment
program and the voluntary use of employee commute reduction activities
as alternative compliance options. Proposed Rule 2202 is designed
to result in equivalent emission reductions to implementation
of Rules 1501 and 1501.1.</I>

approved resolutions authorizing the AQMD to issue bonds jointly
with the County of San Bernardino be amended to allow the AQMD
to issue bonds independent of the county of San Bernardino if
market conditions indicate a refunding is economically prudent
for the AQMD. This item was reviewed and approved by the Administrative

<B>15. Approve Selection of Consultant as Zero-Emission Vehicle
&quot;Quick Charge&quot; Outreach Coordinator for Fiscal Year
1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program</B> (Longville)(909)
396-2898
<P>
<I>As part of the FY 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program,
the MSRC proposed a three-part Zero-Emission Vehicle &quot;Quick
Charge&quot; Program, including an RFQ for buydown incentives,
an EV Corridor Communities Program, and an RFP to obtain a consultant
to act as outreach coordinator to facilitate these program requirements.
The Outreach Coordinator RFP closed on September 19, 1995, following
which a subcommittee, consisting of MSRC Technical Advisory Committee
members, evaluated the eight proposals received and interviewed
three finalists. On November 9, 1995, the MSRC considered the
TAC's recommendation and approved the 18-month appointment of
a consultant as the ZEV &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Outreach Coordinator.
To meet the timelines in the ZEV &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Program,
this consultant needs to be under contract by mid-December 1995.
Consequently, the MSRC is currently requesting the Board's approval
to contract with this consultant as part of the FY 1995-97 AB
2766 Discretionary Work Program.</I>

<I>Amerigon Incorporated has proposed a two-phase program to evaluate
the effectiveness of combining AudioNav, its voice-activated,
automated, in-vehicle navigation system, with traffic data to
relieve congestion and reduce air pollution. Amerigon is only
seeking funding for Phase I at this time. In Phase I, Amerigon
intends to modify AudioNav to utilize traffic data and would conduct
field testing using simulated real-time traffic data. The total
Phase I cost is $924,790. Cofunders would include the AQMD ($100,000),
the California Energy Commission ($325,000), and Amerigon ($499,790).

<I>The AQMD, in conjunction with CALSTART, submitted a proposal
for funding under the Environmental Technology Initiative (ETI)
program to demonstrate electric station car technology within
the SCAB. As a result, the EPA awarded and reserved $250,000 in
FY 1995 ETI grant funds for the AQMD to develop and deploy electric
station cars in the Lancaster and San Bernardino areas. Staff
recommends that upon receipt of these funds, the Board recognize
and appropriate the $250,000 in EPA funding to the FY 1995-96
Technology Advancement budget and approve the contract with CALSTART.

<P>
<I>As part of Resolution No. 90-49 adopting the 1990 SIP for PM10
in the Coachella Valley, the Board established a TWG to evaluate
technical information and to resolve technical issues encountered
during SIP implementation and its subsequent 1994 revision. One
of the requirements of the TWG is to prepare semi-annual progress
reports to the Governing Board and the Coachella Valley Association
of Governments' Executive Committee. This is the ninth semi-annual

<I>Previously, the Board approved contracts for a total of $750,000
to three contractors to review and correct plans and reports under
the AB2588 Air Toxics Hot Spots Program. A portion of the contract
money, reserved for additional reports, was not encumbered by
June 30, 1995. Also, one contractor was terminated for poor performance
and the residual contract money reverted to the Air Toxics Special
Revenue Fund. This recommendation is to re-authorize up to $204,561

<P>
<I>The proposed amendments to Regulation XIII will address state
and federal NSR regulatory requirements. This proposal will replace
the Community Bank with a four tons per year exemption level;
define the equivalency demonstration process; narrow exemptions;
streamline trading zones; forgive exempt emission increases resulting
from the transition out of ozone-depleting compounds. The proposed
amendments will also address internal combustion engines to be
consistent with EPA's national requirements.</I>

<I>The proposed rule would establish an inter-district registration

July was continued after public testimony identified a number
of issues, including Assembly Bill 531, that would directly affect
the program. Staff has clarified language in the rule on filing
for registration and in the staff report on the definition of
a project. Internal combustion engines used on marine dredges
have been added as an eligible source. In addition, staff proposes
the rule to be an interim measure for internal combustion engines
until state regulations for these sources go into effect.</I>

<H3>Authorization of Removal of Various Fixed Assets from Inventory
</CENTER></H3>

<P>
AQMD Administrative Policy and Procedure No. 20 establishes procedures
for the approval, purchase, tagging, physical inventory, and disposal
of fixed asset equipment. In accordance with this policy, staff
has previously requested the Governing Board's approval to remove
equipment which had been retired, damaged, or reported missing
from the inventory of assets.
<P>
During July through October 1993, each organizational unit at
the AQMD conducted a biennial physical inventory of its equipment.
These inventories were observed by Finance staff. A bar code label
was affixed to each located fixed asset to improve the speed and
accuracy of future inventories. Following the conclusion of this
inventory, an additional effort was made to locate assets which
were missing and where appropriate, controls were reviewed in
an effort to provide better safeguards for assets.
<P>
Attachment A is a list of unlocated fixed assets, comprised of
both missing and stolen items as determined from the 1994 August
and September annual inventory by Applied Science and Technology
(AST), as well as assets unlocated from the 1991 Districtwide
fixed asset inventory and the 1992 AST inventory. All assets listed
as stolen were reported to the police.
<P>
Attachment A has been sorted to reflect which items were determined
to be missing or stolen before and after the October 1991 Headquarters
move from El Monte to Diamond Bar. The attachment also reflects
the results of an independent appraiser's valuation of all unlocated
items. The current market value is stated next to the recorded
value (cost) of the item. A summary of the information in Attachment
A appears below:
<P>
<U><B>Original Cost</B></U><B> <U>Current Value</U></B> 
<P>
Items Missing before the Move $ 25,966.08 $ 730.00
<P>
Items Stolen before the Move 59,597.08 4,405.00
<P>
Items Missing after the Move 133,935.53 10,125.00
<P>
Items Stolen after the Move 22,616.97 4,340.00
<P>
Because of the age of the assets, the current value of these missing
assets is materially less than the recorded value. Staff recommends
that the unlocated items on Attachment A be removed from the AQMD's
total equipment inventory of $22,084,839.
<P>
The equipment appearing on Attachments B and D represents surplus
equipment which has been replaced as part of the AQMD's replenishment
program and is no longer of use to the AQMD. Staff is recommending
that the equipment on Attachment B, as in the past, be offered
to nonprofit and charitable organizations on a first-come, first-served
basis and that the equipment on Attachment D be surplused through
the salvage process.
<P>
Attachment C represents vehicles where the cost to repair and/or
maintain due to mechanical breakdown or damage suffered in traffic
accidents has become prohibitive. Staff recommends that these
vehicles be disposed of through the auction process.
<P>
These recommendations were reviewed and approved by the Administrative
Committee at its meeting on November 16, 1995.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Authorize the removal of the equipment identified on Attachments
A, B, C, and D from the AQMD's Equipment Inventory.
<P>
--Authorize the transfer of equipment on Attachment B to nonprofit
or charitable organizations on first-come, first-served basis.
<P>
--Authorize the Purchasing Manager to dispose of the equipment
on Attachment C through the auction process.
<P>
--Authorize the Purchasing Manager to dispose of the equipment
on Attachment D through the salvage process.

AGENDA NO. 9
<P>
BOARD MEETING DATE: December 7, 1995 
<H3>PROPOSAL: Award Technical Support Contracts</H3>

<P>
<B>SYNOPSIS:</B> Technology Advancement administers and manages
the State-mandated Clean Fuels Program to support and promote
the development, demonstration, and ultimate commercialization
of advanced clean fuels and low-emission technologies. To cover
the broad range of technologies being developed with sufficient
technical understanding and project oversight, staff relies on
the technical assistance and support of a number of uniquely qualified
contractor. Staff recommends award of level-of-effort contracts
with three consultants. The total proposed amount of funding for
these three contracts is $130,000.
<P>
<B>COMMITTEE</B>: Technology Committee, November 9, 1995, Approved
<P>
<B>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</B>
<OL>
<LI>Authorize the Executive Officer to enter into an agreement
with Davis &amp; Associates in an amount not to exceed $35,000.
<LI>Authorize the Executive Officer to enter into an agreement
with Curtis A. Moore in an amount not to exceed $50,000.
<LI>Authorize the Executive Officer to enter into an agreement
with Hoagland and Associates in an amount not to exceed $45,000.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) emphasizes the need for
rapid development and commercialization of progressively lower-emitting
technologies and clean fuels. The Air Quality Management District's
(AQMD) Governing Board established the Technology Advancement
program to support industry in meeting this challenge through
a public-private partnership to develop and demonstrate these
technologies. The primary function of Technology Advancement is
to administer and manage the State-mandated Clean Fuels Program,
adopted by the Governing Board on January 8, 1988. The objective
of the Clean Fuels Program is to support and promote the development
and demonstration of clean fuels and new pollution control technologies
to expedite their utilization in the South Coast Air Basin (Basin).
<P>
Since its inception, Technology Advancement staff resources have
been limited, a criticism noted in the recent California Air Resources
Board (ARB) audit of the AQMD. As a result, staff relies on the
technical assistance, support, and outreach efforts of a number
of uniquely qualified contractors to cover the broad range of
emerging technologies, to ensure that the AQMD acquires the most
up-to-date information on these technologies. These contractors
provide support in a variety of areas including, but not limited
to, fuel cells, electric vehicles, alternative fuels and infrastructure
development, commercialization, outreach, alternative fuel vehicle
applications, renewable energy resources, and locomotives.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
Staff recommends award of level-of-effort contracts with the three
consultants described below. Each of the contracts will be awarded
on a sole-source basis. Section II, Step C(3) of the Consultant
Selection Policy identifies four provisions under which an award
of a sole-source contract may be justified: (1) the cost to prepare
competitive procurement documents exceeds the possible savings
that could be derived from such detailed documents; (2) public
health or property may be endangered by any delay of contract
award; (3) prior experience has shown that the desired services
are available only from the sole source; or (4) other circumstances
exist identifying the sole-source as in the best interests of
the AQMD. The desired services have been identified as being only
available from the respective sole sources. Each contractor offers
extensive, comprehensive, and unique qualifications in their respective
fields.
<P>
Specifically, for Contract #1, staff desires the following services
that are available only from the sole source: a highly knowledgeable
consultant in the areas of advanced technologies and alternative
fuels for the transit industry, familiar with the AQMD, and who
can quickly provide technical assistance related to evaluate the

technical assistance on projects and regulatory issues related
to hydrogen.
<P>
The total proposed funding for these three contracts is $130,000.
The scopes of work to be completed by each consultant are described
below. Also described below are each consultant's unique experience
and capabilities to perform the desired services that justify
the recommendations for sole source awards. In addition, the consultants
identified to perform Contracts #1 and 2 were previously selected
and awarded AQMD contracts on the basis of the AQMD's competitive
solicitation Request for Proposals 9495-15.
<P>
<U>Level-of-Effort #1 - Davis &amp; Associates</U> 
<P>
A major source of air pollution in the Basin results from the
operation of heavy-duty vehicles (HDV). Most new heavy-duty diesel
engines used for transit buses can meet applicable 1994 emission
standards for hydrocarbons, CO, and NOx , but not for PM10. Further,
heavy-duty diesel engines will likely have difficulty meeting
more strict NOx standards. In an effort to develop engines which
will meet stricter emission standards, bus and engine manufacturers
have begun to develop buses utilizing various alternative fuels
such as methanol, compressed and liquefied natural gas, liquefied
petroleum gas, fuel cells, and battery packs.
<P>
Staff recommends awarding a level-of-effort contract to Davis
&amp; Associates to provide technical assistance related to reducing
emissions from heavy-duty vehicles and the transit industry, including:
(1) providing a status update of alternative fuel applications,
including infrastructure, in the transit industry; (2) assessment
of and recommendations regarding environmental policies related
to the transit industry; (3) assessment of and recommendations
regarding the development of advanced technologies for the transit
industry; and (4) other related tasks, including suggestions on
how to expedite expanding the application of alternative fuels
and advanced technologies to heavy-duty vehicles in general and,
specifically, to the transit industry.
<P>
Davis &amp; Associates principle, Laurence R. (Rich) Davis, is
a recognized expert in public transportation application and issues.
His expertise in heavy-duty alternative fuels applications with
transit buses is noteworthy. He successfully introduced methanol
and compressed natural gas (CNG) powered buses into the Los Angeles
public transportation sector. As Director of Equipment Maintenance
for Southern California Rapid Transit District, now Los Angeles
County Metropolitan Transit Authority (LACMTA), he managed the
largest alternative fuel and low emission test programs in the
world. Reports from his engineers were used by the California
Air Resources Board (CARB), the California Energy Commission (CEC),
and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA)
for regulatory purposes. Mr. Davis helped write portions of the
Federal Clean Air Act related to transit bus emission standards.
He was instrumental in obtaining funding, designing, and constructing
Southern California's first, and the nation's fourth commercial,
heavy-duty test facility at LACMTA. This facility enables CARB,
CEC, the AQMD, the US EPA and the State of California to measure
heavy-duty regulated emissions and perform comparison testing
on equivalent alternative fuel heavy-duty equipment.
<P>
He initiated the concept of a new bus which ultimately led to
the development of the Advanced Technology Transit Bus which is
designed to be the international bus of the future, particularly
as it is designed for fuel cell power. As a result of these contributions,
Mr. Davis has been recognized as the leader in new technology
within the transit industry. He has received awards from the United
States Department of Transportation (US DOT), American Public
Transit Association, the California Transit Association, the AQMD
and the American Methanol Institute.
<P>
Davis &amp; Associates also offers the expertise of Mr. Stephen
Barsony. Mr. Barsony is an internationally recognized authority
on U.S. transportation issues. Recently retired, he was previously
the Director of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) an has
held numerous positions in the U.S. Department of Transportation,
Office of the Secretary, and in the FTA. Mr. Barsony also offers
insight on the federal funding process as well as extensive national
network of contracts cognizant of transportation issues. Mr. Barsony
shall primarily assist AQMD's staff with the coordination of activities
involving federal agencies.
<P>
Mr. Davis was previously selected and awarded an AQMD contract
on the basis of the AQMD's competitive solicitation Request for
Proposal (RFP) 9495-15. The cumulative total of prior contracts
with Davis &amp; Associates, initiated in November 1994, is $50,000.
<P>
Staff recommends awarding a $35,000 contract with Davis &amp;
Associates to expand the scope of work from the previous competitively
bid award to perform the above described effort.
<P>
<U>Level-of-Effort #2 - Curtis A. Moore</U> 
<P>
The scope of the Technology Advancement program considers all
potential sources of air pollutant emissions, including both stationary
and mobile. The small staff of Technology Advancement has limited
expertise in all the potential sources of emissions or the advanced
technologies to control them. In addition, the State-mandated
Clean Fuels Program has recently been amended by legislative action,
first in 1993 by SB 316 and in 1995 by SB 199 (Kelley). These
recent amendments impose additional constraints to and increased
scrutiny of Clean Fuels Program expenditures. The additional constraints
require that the Clean Fuels Program expenditures by Technology
Advancement not be duplicative of related activities by other
public agencies. For these reasons, staff is seeking assistance
in identifying related state, federal, and international programs
that develop and demonstrate advanced low emission and clean fuel
technologies.
<P>
Curtis A. Moore has provided consulting services supporting the
Technology Advancement program since January 1989. The cumulative
total of prior contracts with Mr. Moore since 1989 is $301,265.65.
<P>
This recommendation expands the scope of Mr. Moore's efforts under
a contract awarded previously as a result of the competitive solicitation
RFP 9495-15. Staff recommends awarding a $50,000 level-of-effort
contract to Curtis A. Moore to provide technical assistance to
Technology Advancement staff, helping to coordinate Technology
Advancement's projects with related domestic and global efforts.
This assistance will include: (1) providing periodic updates of
international activities to develop and demonstrate advanced low
emission and clean fuels technologies; (2) assessing international
environmental technology markets and market drivers; (3) interfacing
with Washington, DC-based and other federal agencies to identify
advanced technologies having the potential to reduce air pollutant
emissions in the Basin; (4) assessing and providing recommendations
regarding economic, regulatory, and other barriers for advanced
technologies, including comparing domestic issues with international
issues; (5) assist in collecting information on federal, non-federal
and other activities, in the implementation of the mandates contained
in SB199; and (6) other related tasks to assist in the coordination
of AQMD Clean Fuels Program activities with other agencies.
<P>
Mr. Moore now an international consultant, was Republican counsel
to the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works form
1978 to 1989. An expert on advanced environmental technologies,
as well as the policies of other nations, his clients include
wide range of businesses, governments and non-profit organizations.
Mr. Moore is the author of Green Gold: Japan, Germany, the United
States, and the Race for Environmental Technology (Beacon Press,
1994), and a frequent writer and lecturer on the relationship
between environmental protection and economic competitiveness.
He regularly undertakes projects examining the policies and technologies
in other developing nations, ranging from Sweden and Germany to
Japan and Korea, as well as developing nations like Brazil and
Ecuador, because of his wide range of both government and private
research development, demonstration and commercialization efforts
for environmental technologies, as well as existing and emerging
markets. He provided valuable information to the AQMD during the
work on revising the BACT guidelines.
<P>
<U>Level-of-Effort #3 - W. Hoagland and Associates</U> 
<P>
Battery and fuel cell vehicles are among the few vehicle technologies
expected to be able to meet the ARB's zero-emission vehicles mandate.
Fuel cells potentially have several advantages over batteries,
including longer life prior to replacement and being refuelable
rather than requiring recharging. Hydrogen is regarded as one
of the leading fuels for a fuel cell vehicle. Since it can be
readily separated from water using renewable energy resources
the supply of hydrogen is potentially unlimited. Hydrogen-powered
fuel cells are potentially true zero-emission vehicles since these
vehicles do not emit any criteria pollutants, toxic pollutants
or global green house gases. In addition, several major manufacturers
are developing technologies to utilize hydrogen as a possible
transportation fuel, including Daimler Benz, BMW, Mazda and Ballard.
<P>
Staff recommends awarding a level-of-effort contract to W. Hoagland
and Associates to provide technical assistance, assessment and
policy recommendations related to hydrogen and hydrogen fuel technologies,
including but not limited to: (a) the use of the hydrogen in fuel
cells, (b) on-board hydrogen storage, conversion efficiency, power
output, durability, and maintenance, (c) the production, transport,
distribution and storage requirements of hydrogen fuel, (d) the
potential retail dispensing requirements of the hydrogen, (e)
permitting, safety, codes and standards, and technology-transfer
efforts, and (f) legislation at the state and federal levels with
respect to hydrogen and its related technologies.
<P>
The principal of W. Hoagland and Associates, William Hoagland,
is domestically and internationally recognized as an expert in
hydrogen and hydrogen fuel technologies. He has over fifteen years
of experience in hydrogen technologies, and until recently, was
the field manager for the Department of Energy (DOE)'s hydrogen
program at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. He was the
founding chairman of the hydrogen technical committee in the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers and was a Board director of the
National Hydrogen Association. He has presented papers on hydrogen
fuel in a number of scientific conferences, often as an invited
speaker at key conferences. He is one of only two Americans invited
to be on the Scientific program committee for the international
hydrogen conference to be held in Stuttgart, Germany in June 1996.
He was also selected as the Operating Agent for the International
Energy Agency Implementing Agreement on Hydrogen. In February
1994, he was invited by the government of Japan to visit and lecture
on hydrogen technologies at several research facilities in Japan.
<P>
Staff recommends awarding a $45,000 contract to W. Hoagland and
Associates to perform the tasks described above.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
Sufficient funds are available in the Fiscal Year 1995-96 Technology
Advancement budget to fund this work.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Pursuant to the California air Toxic &quot;Hot Spots&quot; Information
and Assessment Act of 1987 (AB2588), the AQMD is responsible for
prioritizing facilities for the purpose of performing health risk
assessments and ensuring that adequate health risk assessments
are prepared. The second and third phases of facilities required
to submit air toxic inventory plans and reports will be prioritized
by the end of this year.
<P>
In order to provide these facilities with a lower cost option
and to streamline the review process, the AQMD Governing Board
approved a voluntary pilot program at the August 11, 1995 meeting.
At the September 8, 1995 meeting the Governing Board approved
the release of an RFP to solicit bids for preparing AB2588 health
risk assessments and select up to two contractors.
<P>
<B>Bid Evaluation</B> 
<P>
The AQMD received seven bids in response the RFP released on September
8, 1995. The bids were evaluated by a panel according to Board-approved

BOARD MEETING DATE: December 7, 1995
<P>
 AGENDA NO.
<H3>PROPOSAL: Amend the Agreement for Employee Relations Litigation
and Negotiation Services</H3>

<P>
<B>SYNOPSIS</B>: This recommendation is to amend the amount of
the Goldstein, Kennedy &amp; Petito contract by an additional
$64,667 for extraordinary litigation expenses involving lawsuits
arising from cases alleging discrimination.
<P>
<B>COMMITTEE</B>: Administrative, November 16, 1995
<P>
<B>RECOMMENDED ACTION</B>
<P>
1. Authorize the Chairman to execute an amendment to the contract
with the law firm of Goldstein, Kennedy &amp; Petito in the amount
of $64,667 for FY 1995-96.
<P>
James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<P>
Executive Officer
<P>
NN:LJ:JVC:ET
<P>
_____________________________________________________________________
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The Goldstein, Kennedy &amp; Petito law firm's current fiscal
year contract amount of $185,333 is expected to be expended by
approximately the end of November. This is largely the result
of extraordinary litigation activity relating primarily to three
ongoing lawsuits which, for the first quarter of the fiscal year
have resulted in legal costs of $111,918.30.
<P>
In addition, significant costs have been incurred as a result
of legal challenges to the AQMD relating to the June 30, 1994,
layoffs and reductions in classification. Since the beginning
of the fiscal year the AQMD has been served two lawsuits, one
filed by sixteen plaintiffs affected by layoffs and reductions
and the other filed by the San Bernardino Public Employees Association,
the union representing the AQMD's professional bargaining unit.
Both suits are attempts to reverse the layoffs and reductions
and both have required and will continue to require considerable
time and effort on the part of legal counsel. The costs of these
actions have been high in part because of the short time frames
for the AQMD's legal counsel to file responses and the need for
aggressively litigating these matters to defend the AQMD against
very costly consequences. Although the AQMD's three-year employee
relations legal services contract recognized costs likely would
be highest during the contract's first year, much of the costly
counsel-intensive activity that has occurred since the beginning
of the fiscal year was unanticipated.
<P>
From the beginning of the fiscal year through the end of October,
the following amounts have been expended:
<PRE WIDTH=132>
Ongoing lawsuits                    $111,918.30                      

EEOC investigations                    1,700.00                   

Grievances and other activity     <U>    26,102.07</U>                    

Total                               $139,720.37                      


</PRE>

<P>
In addition to costs which have already been incurred, the AQMD
anticipates an unusually high level of legal activity resulting
in a significant increase in legal costs during the remainder
of the fiscal year, largely as a consequence of the layoff grievances
and ongoing labor negotiations, which currently are at impasse.
In particular, we anticipate actions of the San Bernardino Public
Employees Association will call for continued intensive legal
defense of AQMD actions. In addition, we anticipate an increase
in legal costs due to pending arbitration hearings involving the
Federation of Public Sector Workers, the union representing the
Office Clerical and Maintenance and Technical and Enforcement
bargaining units. Again, these high costs, especially those relating
to recent lawsuits filed on behalf of employees who were laid
off or reduced in classification, were unforeseen, and, consequently,
were not included in the current budget.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
There are no direct resource impacts relating to the current recommendation
since the contract increase amount of $64,667 currently is available
in the District General Account for legal services. However, other
extraordinary legal expenses described above are expected to cost
up to an additional $300,000 for the remainder of the fiscal year,
based on current expenditures of approximately $50,000 per month.
Therefore, following the required 30-day public notification period
of a proposed supplement to the FY 1995-96 budget, staff intends
to recommend at the January 1996 Board meeting an additional increase
of $300,000 in the Goldstein, Kennedy &amp; Petito contract.

December 7, 1996
<P>
South Coast Air Quality<BR>
Management District Board
<H3><CENTER>Recommendation to Lease Business Computer Hardware
and Software  </CENTER></H3>

<P>
On June 9, 1995, the Board approved the release of Request for
Proposal (RFP) #9495-39 for new business computer hardware and
software to replace the District's Data General Aviion Computers
and to evaluate the feasibility of replacing the Ingres database
software, as recommended by KPMG-Peat Marwick in their most recent
triennial performance audit. A public notice inviting bids was
published in accordance with the District's Consultant Selection
Policy and Procedure. The RFP was mailed to 66 vendors.
<P>
Five responses to the hardware portion of the RFP were received
(Attachment A). These were evaluated and rated by a selection
committee in accordance with the evaluation criteria specified
in the RFP. The computer hardware was evaluated on configuration,
future expandability, company stability, annual maintenance cost,
and overall system performance. Overall system performance was
the most critical selection criteria and was determined by benchmarking
District-supplied programs. The Digital computer solution proposed
by Mikon Computer Systems had the best overall performance of
all systems proposed, with the lowest commensurate cost-per-unit
performance increase.
<P>
Based on the results of the evaluation (Attachment B), staff recommends
executing a five-year Technology Management Maintenance Service
(TMMS) lease with Mikon Computer Systems through AVNET for Digital
computer hardware at an annual lease cost of $258,215.20. The
AVNET Computer TMMS lease provides the District an upgrade credit
of $354,312 at Month 37 of the lease term. The recommended business
computer system will allow effective deployment of systems to
support currently defined programs such as Title V and RECLAIM.
<P>
Two vendors submitted proposals for relational database software
(Attachment A). A comparison of features, functionality, third-party
product support, data integrity and data security, ease of application
development, and cost showed that Oracle currently has an edge
over Ingres. However, the costs associated with converting existing
District software applications from Ingres to Oracle is estimated
at $1,600,000. Ingres' newly released product, &quot;Open Ingres&quot;,
incorporates many functional and performance enhancements contained
in Oracle and closes the gap on some of the differences identified
between the two products. Therefore, based on cost considerations,
staff recommends executing a five-year lease with Computer Associates
for Ingres relational database software with an upgrade to &quot;Open
Ingres&quot; at an annual cost of $99,080.14.
<P>
For the remainder of this year, to initiate these leases, $200,000
is included in the Information Management FY 1995-96 approved
budget. Approximately $360,000 will be budgeted annually through
FY 1999-2000 to cover the remainder of the leases. This $360,000
will cover the annual lease costs from AVNET and Computer Associates.
<P>
This project was presented to the Administrative Committee and
was approved at its meeting on October 27, 1995.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Approve a five-year Technology Management Maintenance Service
(TMMS) lease with Mikon Computer Systems through AVNET Computers
for an annual lease cost not to exceed $258,215.20 with a technology
upgrade credit.
<P>
--Approve a five-year lease for Ingres relational database software
with an upgrade to &quot;Open Ingres&quot; with Computer Associates
for an annual lease cost not to exceed $99,080.14.

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>: On September 8, 1995, the Board approved the
release of a Request for Quotations to solicit bids in order to
develop a list of pre-qualified vendors from whom the AQMD may
obtain needed compressed gases and cryogenics. In response to
the RFQ, eight bids were received and subsequently reviewed. Staff
is recommending all eight vendors be placed on a pre-qualified
vendor list for the purchase of compressed gases and four vendors
be placed on a pre-qualified vendor list for cryogenics for AQMD
use for the remainder of FY 1995-96 and for the entire FY 1996-97.
This item was reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee
on November 16, 1995.
<P>
<B>COMMITTEE</B>: Administrative, November 16, 1995, Approved
<P>
<B>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</B>
<P>
1 Approve the list of pre-qualified vendors for compressed gases
and cryogenics on Attachment A.

<B>Background</B> 
<P>
On September 8, 1995, the Board approved the release of a Request
for Quotations (RFQ # 1803) which would be used to establish a
list of pre-qualified vendors from whom competitive bids may be
solicited for the purchase of compressed gases (pure gases and
standard mixtures) and cryogenics (liquid nitrogen and liquid
argon).
<P>
In accordance with AQMD's Contracting and Purchasing Policy, a
public notice inviting bids was published in the Los Angeles Times,
Orange County Register, Riverside Press-Enterprise, San Bernardino
Sun, and La Opinion on September 13 &amp; 20, 1995, in the Los
Angeles Sentinel on September 14, 1995, in the California Contracts
Register on September 28, 1995, and in the M/W/DVBE Source on
September 13, 1995. In addition, bids were mailed to various known
vendors.
<P>
The Applied Science and Technology Division requires compressed
gases and cryogenics to operate and calibrate, monitoring and
analytical instruments. The compressed gases are used for the
air monitoring stations, program evaluations, source test field
work and chemistry laboratory sample analysis. The cryogenics
are needed to achieve ultra-low temperatures for laboratory sample
analyses by gas chromatography.
<P>
The need for these items is ongoing, but storage space is limited
so gases and cryogenics have to be ordered periodically. Staff
has determined that there is a cost and time efficiency savings
by establishing open purchase orders with vendors of these materials.
The bidding period for compressed gases and cryogenics was open
from September 8, 1995 and closed on October 13, 1995. The term
of the open purchase orders is for the remainder of FY 1995-96
and the entire FY 1996-97. The price quotations are valid until
June 30, 1997.
<P>
<B>Bid Evaluation</B> 
<P>
Eleven RFQ's were mailed to suppliers of compressed gases and
cryogenics and eight companies responded to the RFQ. Companies
were free to bid on one, several or all of the types of compressed
gases and cryogenics needed by the AQMD. The bids were evaluated
according to the process established in the RFQ. All eight companies
were determined to be qualified as compressed gases vendors and
four companies qualified as cryogenics vendors. Staff recommends
that an open purchase order be established for each company. Orders
will be placed so as to minimize the cost, taking into account
the specified delivery schedule and product availability.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
Staff estimates that $60,000.00 will be spent for the purchase
of compressed gases and cryogenics for the remainder of FY 1995-96,
which is included in ASTD's FY 1995-96 Budget. Staff also estimates
that $130,000.00 will be required for compressed gases and cryogenics
in FY 1996-97 and the funding for this will be subject to approval
of ASTD's FY 1996-97 budget.

utilities, was formed to conduct the Phase II field demonstration
of these residential fuel cells in conjunction with Polydyne.
Staff recommends funding up to $140,000, out of a total program
cost of approximately $1,680,000 for this demonstration.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) relies on the continuous
advancement of low-emission and zero-emission technologies to
meet its air quality objectives by the year 2010. Given its near
zero-emissions and high fuel efficiency characteristics, fuel
cell technology has the potential for numerous stationary and
mobile applications. It is projected that the world-wide market
for small fuel cells in residential applications could match that
of the anticipated market in automotive applications.
<P>
Moreover, residential fuel cells could also provide an infrastructure
for home electric vehicle (EV) recharging. Under the current infrastructure,
grid-based recharging of battery-powered electric vehicles generates
low but measurable air pollution emissions from central power
plants. Although these power plant emissions are very much lower
than conventional gasoline vehicle tailpipe emissions, recharging
EVs using residential fuel cells could greatly reduce, if not,
eliminate associated power-plant emissions. This could make battery-powered
EVs true zero emission vehicles (ZEVs).
<P>
As an emerging technology, fuel cells are currently a high capital
cost technology. The high capital costs can be attributed, primarily,
to the low production volumes. These high costs, in turn, inhibit
the demand for fuel cells in the competitive electricity generation
marketplace. Increasing the production volume of fuel cells is
expected to greatly reduce the cost of fuel cells.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
In 1993, Polydyne Inc. (Polydyne) proposed a three-phase, five-year
project to the AQMD. The objective of this proposal was to develop
a program to facilitate the wide-scale introduction of fuel cells
for residential small-scale and commercial applications. These
applications represent a potential volume sufficient to drive
down fuel cell prices. The total cost of this three-phase program
is estimated at $18 million.
<P>
In Phase I, under AQMD Contract R-C94071, Polydyne conducted a
feasibility study to develop market and technical specifications
for residential fuel cells. The total cost of Phase I, $410,000,
was cost-shared by AQMD ($50,000) and a consortium of utilities
in the amount of $360,000.
<P>
This specifications developed under this phase, were used as the
basis for a Market Opportunity Notice issued to solicit fuel cell
manufacturers, developers, and system integrators to provide prototype
fuel cells for a pilot field demonstration. This demonstration
is proposed in Phase II.
<P>
Polydyne in conjunction with the Small-Scale Fuel Cell Commercialization
Group, Inc. (SFCCG), a non-profit consortium of U.S. utilities,
have presented a proposal to the AQMD for Phase II. The objective
of Phase II is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of small
fuel cells to meet the heating and electricity needs of individual
residences. Qualified respondents to the MON released in Phase
I will be invited to supply four to six residential fuel cells
designed to operate on natural gas. One of these units will be
sited in Southern California in cooperation with Southern California
Edison, one of the cosponsors and participating utilities in the
SFCCG. During the demonstration period of about twenty-four months,
the performance of the prototype residential fuel cells will be
monitored and evaluated.
<P>
Performance evaluation will include measurement of any emissions
from the fuel cell and fuel reformer system; determination of
fuel efficiency; documentation of load demand and load following
performance; quality of the electric current provided; documentation
of unit availability and reliability; determination of operation
and maintenance requirements; and assessment of any degradation
of system performance. Assessments will also be conducted to determine
user acceptance of residential fuel cells, in terms of procurement,
installation, and operation and maintenance requirements, and
utility acceptance of residential fuel cells as a distributed
energy resource.
<P>
If the Phase II demonstration of residential applications is successful,
SFCCG shall pursue the demonstration of several hundred fuel cells
in Phase III.
<P>
<B>Sole Source Justification</B> 
<P>
Section II, Step C(3) of the Consultant Selection Policy identifies
four provisions under which the Governing Board may award a sole-source
bid: (a) cost to prepare bid documents exceeds the cost for consultant,
(b) delay would result in the endangerment of public health or
property, (c) services are only available from the sole-source,
or (d) other circumstances exist identifying sole-source as in
the best interest of the AQMD. This request for sole-source award
is being made under provision (d).
<P>
It is in the best interests of the AQMD to cosponsor Phase II
of this residential fuel cell demonstration project. This project
is unique both in its approach and in the team of participants.
The project team includes Polydyne, Inc. and the SFCCG consortium
members identified in Attachment A.
<P>
Polydyne has proven itself as a major driving force behind the
development of fuel cells for residential and small-scale commercial
applications. Polydyne conceived and conducted Phase I of its
three-phase proposal. Further, Polydyne developed the market and
technical specifications used in the Phase I MON and orchestrated
the collaboration of the utilities (See Attachment A) that evolved
into the SFCCG.
<P>
The SFCCG brings extensive utility industry participation to this
project that will directly contribute to the successful completion
of the proposed effort. First, and as detailed below, the member
utilities are contributing substantial cost-sharing. Additionally,
since fuel cells will ultimately have to be procured, installed,
operated and serviced by utilities, utility participation brings
a collective level of expertise not available elsewhere. Finally
the utilities possess key capabilities for the successful completion
of the project: specialized knowledge of customer electric loads,
methods to satisfy these loads, customer service, customer billing,
and access to instrumentation for monitoring, testing and telemetering
data on a real-time basis.
<P>
Moreover, the member utilities of the SFCCG could facilitate the
commercialization of products developed from this demonstration.
Given that participating utilities are geographically diverse,
a successful demonstration of residential fuel cells could eventually
lead to commercial orders from throughout the country rather than
from a single region.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
Staff recommends that the AQMD cosponsor Phase II of this project
in an amount not to exceed $140,000. The total cost of Phase II
is estimated to be $1,680,000. Co-sponsors shall include the SFCCG
members (Attachment A) in the amount of $1,540,000 and District
($140,000). Sufficient funds are available in the Fiscal Year
1995-1996 Budget of Technology Advancement to fund this project.

AGENDA NO.18
<P>
BOARD MEETING DATE: December 7, 1995 
<H3>PROPOSAL: Sponsor a Study to Evaluate Particulate Pollution
Impact on Morbidity Among California Kaiser Permanente Members
Who Reside in the South Coast Air Basin.</H3>

<P>
<B>SYNOPSIS:</B> The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
awarded the District $145,000 to fund a study proposed by the
Kaiser Foundation Research Institute. The objective of this study
is to evaluate the health impact on the Basin's population from
ambient particulate pollution (PM10 and 2.5), and to determine
the extent to which co-pollutants such as ozone modify the effects.
The study population shall consist of Kaiser Permanente members.
The incidence of acute respiratory and cardiac illness shall be
evaluated. Staff has publicly noticed receipt of these EPA funds
and recommends award of a contract to the Kaiser Foundation Research
Institute in an amount not to exceed $145,000.
<P>
<B>COMMITTEE</B>: Technology Committee, November 9, 1995, Approved
<P>
<B>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</B>
<OL>
<LI>Authorize the Chairman to execute an agreement with the Kaiser
Foundation Research Institute, in an amount not to exceed $145,000
to conduct an epidemiological study to evaluate the impact of
air pollution on the Basin's population.

<HR>

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for both ozone
and fine particulate matter (PM10) continue to be violated in
several areas in the South Coast Air Basin (Basin) although it
is required to achieve NAAQS levels by the years 2006 and 2010,
respectively. In an effort to characterize the PM10 problem in
the Basin, identify the relative contributory sources, and develop
effective control strategies, the AQMD has begun a comprehensive
ambient monitoring program at six sites.
<P>
PM10 is a complex mixture of pollutants, derived from both natural
and combustion sources, which vary significantly in their size
fractions and chemical composition. The adverse effects of PM10
include both increased morbidity and mortality. These adverse
effects have been reported consistently from different parts of
the world, including Southern California. However, a difference
in the magnitude of mortality effects is observed when studies
from Southern California are compared with other published studies.
It is not known whether morbidity effects also exhibit similar
disparity. Thus, firm conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the
magnitude of effects; the size fraction of PM that is responsible
for most of the effects observed; the influence of co-pollutants,
such as ozone, on the magnitude of effects; and the ambient level(s)
at which the effect(s) begin to occur, either in a general population
or in a susceptible subgroup.
<P>
These uncertainties exist because of lack of adequate ambient
monitoring data to characterize population exposures, variation
in demographics at different locations, and adequate control for
variables. The wide variation in the Basin's pollutant profile
also may be a contributing factor. The AQMD's ongoing (July 95
thru February 96) enhanced monitoring program for PM10 and the
availability of a good and stable health effects data base (from
Kaiser hospitals in the Basin) corresponding to the same period
provides a unique opportunity to address some of the uncertainties
listed.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
The AQMD has been awarded $350,000 from the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's (EPA) 105 Grant Program to conduct health
effects studies to determine the impact of air pollution on public
health and to estimate benefits derived from reducing ambient
levels of PM10 and ozone in the South Coast Basin. From this 105
Grant, a research project ($205,000) was approved by the District's
Governing Board at its October 1995 meeting, to determine whether
coarse particles derived from desert dust storms are as toxic
as fine particles originated mostly from combustion sources. Kaiser
Foundation Research Institute (Kaiser) has proposed a second study
for $145,000 that will determine how daily changes in air pollution
levels affects the health status of the local population and assess
the relative roles ozone, PM10 and PM2.5 play in causing these
effects. This study has been designed in consultation with EPA
staff who are providing the fiscal resources to conduct the study.
The results of these two studies together will assist in estimating
the impact of air pollution on human health in the Basin and also
in determining whether the magnitude of impact is different for
the Basin compared to rest of the country.
<P>
Kaiser has proposed a one year study to assess the relationship
between ambient air pollutant levels measured during the PM10
enhanced monitoring program and the occurrence of acute respiratory
and chronic cardiovascular morbidity in the Basin. The main objective
of the study is to characterize the relationship between daily
measurements of ambient PM (PM10, PM2.5 and its component species)
and the health indices of the Basin's population. The health indices
include rate of emergency room visits and hospitalizations for
acute respiratory illness and exacerbations of chronic cardio-pulmonary
disease among the membership of Kaiser Permanente group of hospitals
in the Basin. In addition to the influence of co-pollutants (ozone
and nitrogen dioxide), modifying and/or compounding effects of
age, gender, temperature, humidity, and season will also be determined.
<P>
The EPA is currently funding a study to analyze data from various
Kaiser hospitals (1990-1995) in the State and correlate it with
available historical ambient air pollution data. This analysis
will provide clues about the overall health impact of ozone, and
to a minor extent PM10. Lack of ambient air pollution data on
a daily basis precludes generating information required to evaluate
the magnitude of impact in the Basin as well as prioritizing the
target pollutant(s) or pollutant fraction for obtaining maximum
health benefits.
<P>
The analyses proposed do not have similar limitations because
the ambient air pollution data is being collected on a daily basis
(under the enhanced PM10 monitoring program) and the hospitals
selected are in close proximity to monitoring sites. It is estimated
that 83% of the study population live within a 12.5 mile radius
from a monitoring site.
<P>
The proposal received by the AQMD has been peer reviewed and approved
by three experts (Drs. Aaron Cohen from Health Effects Institute,
Suresh Moolgavkar from Fred Hutchins Cancer Research Center, and
Arden Pope from Brigham Young University), in this type of research
efforts. In addition, EPA Region IX, and California Air Resources
Board (CARB) staff have also reviewed and recommended approval
of this proposal.
<P>
Staff proposes to set up an advisory panel comprised of these
peer reviewers and representatives from the AQMD, EPA, ARB and
other interested groups to oversee the progress and successful
completion of this study. The panel will also review and comment
on the reports submitted by the investigators.
<P>
<B>Sole-Source Justification</B> 
<P>
Section II, Step C(3) of the Consultant Selection Policy identifies
four provisions under which a sole-source award may be justified:
(1) cost to prepare documents exceeds the cost for consultants.
(2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health or
property, (3) services are only available from the sole-source,
(4) other circumstances exist identifying the sole-source as in
the best interests of the AQMD.
<P>
This request for a sole-source award is being made under provision
#4. Kaiser hospital data is not accessible to other investigators
for performing similar analyses because of the confidential nature
of hospital records. The costs associated with daily monitoring
are prohibitive to consider a similar study either at a later
time or even with a limited number of hospitals. In addition,
adding this segment of detailed analyses applicable to the Basin
at such a low cost ($145,00) is feasible because the major share
of data collection ($116,000) is being borne by the EPA indirectly
through their ongoing statewide study.
<P>
Thus, it is in the AQMD's best interest to fund this study to
better evaluate the magnitude of air pollution impact on the Basin's
inhabitants and to develop control strategies that will provide
maximum health benefits by prioritizing the PM10 components for
control efforts.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
The cost of the proposed project is $144,561. With the recognition
and appropriation of the EPA 105 grant, sufficient funds are available
in the Fiscal Year 1995-96 Technology Advancement budget to fund
this project.

<P>
BOARD MEETING DATE: December 7, 1995
<H3>PROPOSAL: Adopt Rule 2100 - Registration of Portable Equipment
</H3>

<P>
<B>SYNOPSIS:</B> The proposed rule would establish an inter-district
registration program for certain portable equipment. The public
hearing in July was continued after public testimony identified
a number of issues, including Assembly Bill 531, that would directly
affect the program. Staff has clarified language in the rule on
filing for registration and in the staff report on the definition
of a project. Internal combustion engines used on marine dredges
have been added as an eligible source. In addition, staff proposes
the rule to be an interim measure for internal combustion engines
until state regulations for these sources go into effect.
<P>
<B>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</B>
<P>
1. Certify the Final Environmental Assessment for Proposed Rule
2100 - Registration of Portable Equipment, as proposed, in accordance
with the attached Resolution.
<P>
2. Adopt Rule 2100 - Registration of Portable Equipment.
<P>
James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<P>
Executive Officer<HR>

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
At your July Board meeting, Proposed Rule 2100 - Registration
of Portable Equipment was considered for adoption. Based on the
testimony received, the hearing was continued pending the fate
of State Assembly Bill 531 (Morrissey, AB 531). The bill establishes
a statewide registration program for portable internal combustion
engines (ICE) to be administered by the state board. It has been
enacted and the state board will have until January 1, 1997 to
adopt regulations to implement the legislation.
<P>
Staff has sent a survey form to 12 districts that have either
adopted or have been considering adoption of an equivalent portable
equipment registration rule regarding their intended participation
in the program in light of the enactment of AB 531. The results
of the survey show that, out of 12 districts, five are planning
to participate in a statewide portable equipment registration,
at least until state regulation becomes effective, three are not
planning to participate, and four are undecided. Also, staff held
a meeting with a small group of industry representatives on October
5, 1995, and a public consultation meeting on October 10, 1995
to brief them and receive any additional comments on Proposed
Rule 2100.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
As a result of discussions with industry representatives and the
enactment of AB 531, s
<P>
taff recommends the following revisions to Proposed Rules 2100:
<UL>
<LI>Remove the exclusion of marine dredges in subdivision (b)
- Applicability;
<LI>Delete the definitions of &quot;Existing Emissions Unit&quot;
and &quot;New Emissions Unit&quot;;
<LI>Register engines permitted in the AQMD that were in operation
prior to June 3, 1988, if 500 BHP or less, and October 8, 1976,
if greater than 500 BHP, without addition of new daily emission
limits;
<LI>End the registration program for ICE's on August 1, 1997,
or 30 calendar days after the date the state registration program
pursuant to AB 531 takes effect, whichever comes sooner; and
<LI>Revise the definition of &quot;Location&quot; to clearly define
the location for emissions units used in maintenance activities.
</UL>

<P>
The revisions will not cause any substantial impact.
<P>
<B>Policy Issues</B> 
<P>
Staff has addressed the concerns raised by industry representatives
and the public in Appendix A of the Addendum to the Staff Report
for Proposed Rule 2100. Major issues are included in Attachment
A - Summary of Additional Public Comments and AQMD Responses.
<P>
<B>AQMP &amp; Legal Mandates</B> 
<P>
The proposed rule incorporates AQMD rules applicable to the proposed
source categories. The registered equipment must meet the requirements
of current Best Availble Control Technology (BACT) and source-specific
rules, which are specified in this rule. The emission reductions
from regulating these sources under the proposed rule will be
the same as those under the current AQMD permit system. The economic
growth projected in the Air Quality Management Plan for the affected
source categories is sufficient to cover the emission increases
from the registered equipment. Additionally, registered equipment
is exempt from the equivalency demonstration for state purposes
and is below the offset thresholds of federal regulations.
<P>
<B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B> 
<P>
Pursuant to the AQMD's Certified Regulatory Program (Rule 110),
AQMD has prepared the appropriate California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA) document, consisting of a Draft Environmental Assessment
(EA). The Draft EA identified potential adverse environmental
impacts that may result from adopting the proposed project and
identified measures to mitigate impacts to the maximum extent
feasible. The Draft EA was circulated for a 45-day public review
from May 10, 1995 through June 29, 1995. The Final EA includes
responses to all comments received on the Draft EA. A socioeconomic
analysis is included in the Staff Report.
<P>
A Statement of Findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations
regarding potential significant adverse air quality impacts that
may result from adopting Rule 2100 have been prepared pursuant
to state CEQA Guidelines and AQMD CEQA Guidelines. These Statements
are included as an attachment to the Board Resolution. A mitigation
monitoring and reporting plan was also prepared pursuant to Public
Resources Code 21081.6. Staff has determined that the modifications
to the proposed rule are within the scope of the Draft EA and
will not result in any significant adverse environmental impacts.
<P>
<B>Implementation Plan</B> 
<P>
Staff will continue working with CAPCOA to streamline registration
processing, notify those sources affected by Proposed Rule 2100,
and, if necessary, provide assistance to those sources.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B> 
<P>
Two Full Time Employees (FTE) are needed for startup and permitting.
One FTE is needed for the first two years, and one-fourth of an
FTE is needed for the following years, for ongoing monitoring,
reporting, and processing the additional applications. Resources
will be reallocated internally to meet FTE needs.

<H3>Public Hearing to Amend Rule 1134 -Emissions of Oxides of
Nitrogen from Stationary Gas Turbines </CENTER></H3>

<P>
<U><B>Introduction</B></U> 
<P>
The purpose of Rule 1134 - Emissions of Oxides of Nitrogen from
Stationary Gas Turbines, is to provide emission reductions of
nitrogen oxides (NOX), which are necessary to attain and/or maintain
state and federal ambient air quality standards for nitrogen dioxide
(NO2), particulate matter (PM10) and visibility. In order to achieve
this, Rule 1134 requires various categories of stationary gas
turbines operating in the South Coast Air Quality Management District
(AQMD) to meet specific NOX concentration limits. The rule has
a final compliance date of December 31, 1995, and applies to all
existing stationary gas turbines rated at 0.3 megawatts (MW) or
greater which are located within the AQMD jurisdiction.
<P>
The origin of the rule can be traced to a 1979 United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) New Source Performance Standard for Stationary
Gas Turbines. In 1981, the California Air Resources Board (CARB)
adopted a Suggested Control Measure for this same equipment. Following
this, the AQMD incorporated into the 1982 revision of the Air
Quality Management Plan (AQMP), Measure E-1, titled Electric Utility
Gas Turbines NOX Control. This led to the adoption of Rule 1134
in 1989 which encompasses various NOX emission limits for a wide
range of gas turbine applications.
<P>
Facilities subject to Rule 1134 generally include those which
utilize gas turbine units to generate electricity. These units
add power to the regional electrical power grid directly or displace
utility-supplied power by on-site power generation with the surplus
power, if any, going to the grid. The electrical energy supply
market can be categorized into three segments: utilities, on-site
generators and third-party-owned cogenerators. Exclusive on-site
power units are typically less than 10 MW in size. The third-party-owned
cogenerator units generally range in size from 20 to 40 MW, though
some are less than 10 MW or greater than 40 MW. Utility units,
both simple and combined cycle, range in size from about 20 to
greater than 130 MW. At the time of the rule's adoption in 1989,
it was estimated that the gas turbine capacity in the AQMD was
2,473 MW, with 1,985 MW in operation and 488 MW of new units to
be completed. The AQMD-wide NOX emissions as a result of the rule
were expected to be reduced from 18.9 tons per day to 8.9 tons
per day for a net reduction of 10 tons per day.
<P>
<U><B>Proposed Amendments</B></U> 
<P>
Rule 1134 presently requires all stationary gas turbines in the
AQMD to meet specified NOX concentration limits by December 31,
1995. The limits are dependent upon the size (MW rating) of the
unit and type of control technology utilized. Exemptions apply
to certain types of turbines such as emergency standby and peaking
units which operate less than 200 hours per year; laboratory units
used in research and testing; units used exclusively for firefighting
and/or flood control; or existing chemical processing units.
<P>
Beginning in 1994, a large number of utilities and third-party-owned
cogenerators were included in the Regional Clean Air Incentives
Market (RECLAIM) program and as such are not required to meet
the NOX concentration limits imposed by Rule 1134. However, gas
turbines used at publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs), landfills,
hospitals and other public facilities, and sources which were
not covered under RECLAIM, are still required to meet the concentration
limits in Rule 1134 through application of various control technologies.
<P>
Of those non-RECLAIM sources required to meet the NOX concentration
limits, some have raised concerns indicating that the application
of available technology is not suitable for a number of reasons.
Some of these units are operated so infrequently and in such remote
areas of the AQMD that add-on controls, or combustion modifications,
if available, are not cost-effective. The gas turbines located
in the Southeast Desert Air Basin (SEDAB) are in a geographical
area where NOX, ozone and some of the PM10 concerns are transient
and as a direct result of emissions generated within the South
Coast Air Basin (SCAB). The SEDAB includes specific desert portions
of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties within the
jurisdiction of the AQMD. Also, the gas turbines located on San
Clemente Island (SCI) are in such location that any NOX emissions
generated from the island do not impact the air quality in SCAB.
The only facility on SCI was recently proposed to be removed from
the RECLAIM program for the same reason.
<P>
This proposed rule amendment will provide an exemption to specified
existing gas turbines located in SEDAB, and all existing gas turbines
on SCI. In addition the proposed rule amendment will eliminate
the requirement to account for variations in ambient temperature,
pressure and humidity by continuously correcting the reference
NOX emission limits to the International Standards Organization
(ISO) standard. The main factors which provided the basis for
this proposed amendment are listed below:
<UL>
<LI>The number of gas turbine sources located in SEDAB are few;
a total of 23 units have been identified in SEDAB, 17 of which
have an equivalent rating below 2.0 MW.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The number of gas turbine sources located on SCI are few;
a total of 4 units have been identified, all of which have an
equivalent rating below 3.0 MW.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The contribution to AQMD-wide emissions from all SEDAB and
SCI gas turbines combined is minimal in comparison to other SCAB
sources.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>NOX Control Measures for both the Antelope Valley and Riverside
County SEDAB are not compromised by exempting the proposed gas
turbine units from the rule requirements. The 1994 AQMP does not
emphasize any further NOX control measures to be implemented in
SEDAB.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The total amount of reductions possible as a result of successfully
applying controls to both SEDAB and SCI sources is not expected
to create a significant cumulative benefit to the overall air
quality in the AQMD. Control of these sources combined would yield
only one percent of the total NOX emission reductions which were
expected when the rule was adopted in August, 1989.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The sources identified in SEDAB and SCI either cannot physically
retrofit or apply add-on controls, or cannot implement cost effective
controls to meet rule requirements.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The sources in SEDAB and SCI which are proposed to be exempted
historically have low annual usage rates in comparison to their
maximum possible operations. Specifically, Gas Company units (SEDAB)
have operated an average of less than 20 percent of the time over
the last four years. The Rockwell (SEDAB) and SCI units have operated
less than one percent of the year on average for the last three
years.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The continuous corrections of reference NOX emission limits
to ISO standards result in added cost and complexity to the operation
and maintenance of continuous emission monitoring systems without
any significant corresponding NOX emission reduction benefits.
</UL>

<P>
Other proposed changes are minor and are added to clarify and
improve the enforceability of the rule.
<P>
<U>CEQA and Socioeconomic Analyses</U> 
<P>
Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the
AQMD prepared a Draft Supplemental Environmental Assessment (SEA)
to the 1989 Environmental Assessment for Rule 1134 - Emissions
of Oxides of Nitrogen from Stationary Gas Turbines, for the proposed
amendments to Rule 1134. The Draft SEA was circulated for a 45-day
public review and comment period, which ended November 6, 1995.
One comment was received on the Draft SEA. A response to that
comment is included in the Final SEA. A Statement of Findings
and a Statement of Overriding Considerations pursuant to Public
Resources Code Section 21002 and a state CEQA Guidelines Sections
15091 and 15093, regarding adverse environmental impacts that
cannot be mitigated to insignificance as required by the CEQA,
are included as an Attachment and incorporated by reference. The
Final SEA is included in this Final Rule Package.
<P>
Due to the bulk of the previously prepared CEQA document for Rule
1134, the previous CEQA document has been distributed to Board
members only. Those wishing to view the referenced previous CEQA
documents may do so by contacting the AQMD's Public Information
Center at (909) 396-3600.
<P>
In addition, the AQMD prepared a Draft Socioeconomic Assessment
as part of the draft staff report, which addresses the socioeconomic
impacts of the proposed amendments to rule 1134. The Final Socioeconomic
Assessment is included as part of the final staff report.
<P>
A Public Workshop was held for the proposed amendments to Rule
1134 on August 18, 1995. As per the Notice of Public Hearing,
written comments were accepted through November 28, 1995. All
written comments received by that date were reviewed and responded
to by staff in the final staff report which is part of the Hearing
package for the rule amendment. As a result of the comments received
staff has incorporated minor changes to the rule. None of these
changes affect the conclusions of the CEQA or Socioeconomic analyses.
<P>
THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR BOARD
<P>
--Certify the Final Supplemental Environmental Assessment for
the proposed amendments to Rule 1134 - Emissions of Oxides of
Nitrogen from Stationary Gas Turbines, in accordance with the
attached Resolution.
<P>
--Amend Rule 1134 - Emissions of Oxides of Nitrogen from Stationary
Gas Turbines as proposed in accordance with the attached Resolution.

<P>
<B>SYNOPSIS:</B> The rescinding of Rule 1129 and proposed amendment
of the other coating rules are necessary to make AQMD rules consistent
with Section 41712 of the state Health and Safety Code which prohibits
local districts from enforcing or regulating volatile organic
compound (VOC) limits on aerosol coatings. In addition, the proposed
amendment of the definition of &quot;exempt compounds&quot; in
each rule will reference Rule 102 - Definition of Terms, to provide
a consistent definition between rules.
<P>
<B>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</B> 
<P>
<B>1.</B> Approve the Notice of Exemption for Rules 1106.1, 1107,
1128, 1129, 1130, 1145, and 1151.
<P>
<B>2.</B> Rescind Rule 1129 - Aerosol Coatings.
<P>
<B>3.</B> Amend Rules 1106.1, 1107, 1128, 1130, 1145, and 1151.

<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
Rule 1129 - Aerosol Coatings, and associated coating rule amendments
were adopted November 2, 1990, to reduce VOC emissions from aerosol
coatings. Subsequently, Dunn Edwards Corporation and two groups
of aerosol paint manufacturers each filed a lawsuit challenging
the Rule 1129 adoption and other amendments on numerous grounds.
While the Los Angeles County Superior Court ruled in favor of
the plaintiffs in July of 1991, suspending Rule 1129 and the associated
amendments, the AQMD prevailed in its appeal in May of 1993, allowing
the reinstatement.
<P>
In October of 1993, the state legislature adopted amendments to
the State Health and Safety Code Section 41712, requiring the
California Air Resources Board (CARB) to adopt an aerosol paint
regulation and prohibiting local districts from adopting and enforcing
local aerosol paint regulations. Subsequently, CARB adopted a
statewide Aerosol Coating Products Rule on March 23, 1995.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B> 
<P>
To be consistent with state law, staff proposes to rescind Rule
1129 and to amend Rules 1106.1, 1107, 1128, 1130, 1145 and 1151
to exempt aerosol coating products (aerosol coating products do
not include aerosol adhesives.) Additionally, staff is proposing
language to adopt the CARB definition of &quot;aerosol coating
products&quot; in order to provide rule consistency with the recently-adopted
CARB Aerosol Coating Products Rule. Finally, staff proposes to
amend the definition of &quot;exempt compounds&quot; in each rule
to reference its definition in Rule 102 - Definition of Terms,
which already controls in the event of a conflict in the rules.
<P>
<B>AQMP</B> 
<P>
The proposed amendments have no impact on emissions, and are consistent
with the AQMP.
<P>
<B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B> 
<P>
AQMD Staff has reviewed the proposed project pursuant to state
CEQA Guidelines Section 15002(k)(1). The proposed recission implements
currently existing state law over which the AQMD has no discretionary
authority. Therefore, the project is exempt from the requirements
of CEQA pursuant to state CEQA Guidelines Section 15268. In addition,
the project does not have the potential to adversely impact the
environment and is exempt pursuant to state CEQA Guidelines section
15061(b)(3).
<P>
Due to the limited nature of the amendments, no socioeconomic
assessment is required. The amendments will not have any effect
on the cost of compliance with the amended rules.
<P>
Staff has reviewed the proposed rescinding of Rule 1129 and the
proposed amendments to Rules 1106.1, 1107, 1128, 1130, 1145, and
1151, and has determined that they are exempt from the requirements
of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), pursuant to
State CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(1) and (b)(3). Therefore,
a Notice of Exemption will be prepared for the proposed amendments
and will be filed with the county clerks immediately following
the adoption of the proposed amendments.

AGENDA NO. 34
<P>
BOARD MEETING DATE: December 7, 1995 
<H3>PROPOSAL: Public Hearing to Adopt Proposed Rule 118 - Emergencies
</H3>

<P>
<B>SYNOPSIS</B>: The proposed rule is in response to public concern
regarding the potential need during disaster-related conditions
for emergency support, extended hours of operation, operation
in excess of permit conditions or the use of additional equipment
not permitted by the AQMD or noncompliance with noticing provisions.
The proposed rule would allow the Executive Officer the discretion
to suspend AQMD rules, regulations or orders in the event of a
state or federally declared State of Emergency. The suspension
would be specific to the needs and circumstances of the emergency
and could apply only to specific jurisdictions within the South
Coast Air Quality Management District.
<P>
<B>COMMITTEE</B>: Stationary Source, October 27, 1995, Approved
<P>
<B>RECOMMENDED ACTION</B>:
<P>
<B>1.</B> Adopt Proposed Rule 118 - Emergencies.
<P>
James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<P>
Executive Officer
<P>
BRW:CSL:CSG:TAS<HR>

<P>
<U><B>BACKGROUND</B></U> 
<P>
During the past several years, Southern California has experienced
several disaster-related emergencies. These emergencies have included
fires, floods, earthquakes, and civil unrest. The last state and
federally declared State of Emergency occurred in February 1995
when weeks of excessive rain resulted in devastating flooding
effects throughout the area. Emergency situations have required
the extensive use of potentially polluting non-permitted equipment
brought into the District in order to remedy the emergency, secure
the safety of the public or otherwise provide emergency support.
In other instances, there has been a need for the expedited replacement
of damaged or destroyed equipment, an extension of normal operating
hours, temporary operation outside other permit conditions in
order to address emergency needs, or inability to meet a noticing
requirement.
<P>
<U><B>PROPOSAL</B></U> 
<P>
In an effort to assist the community during disaster-related crises,
the AQMD has prepared Proposed Rule 118 - Emergencies. This proposed
rule would give the Executive Officer the authority to temporarily
suspend any AQMD rules, regulations or orders in the event of
a state or federally declared State of Emergency. The suspension
would be temporary and could be limited to specific regions within
the AQMD's areas of jurisdiction depending on the emergency and
its magnitude.
<P>
The suspension would be beneficial to business owners in an emergency
situation as it would enable the Executive Officer to allow additional
equipment to be brought in and to be used in the four-county area
of the district even if such equipment lacks AQMD permits to operate.
In addition, the suspension could allow for extended hours or
other operation beyond specified permit conditions as well as
a waiver of noticing requirements. The rule suspension would last
for 10 calendar days but could be extended by the Executive Officer
if deemed necessary. The suspension would not last any longer
than the official State of Emergency but would give facilities
the time they need to complete emergency and rescue work before
beginning an extensive clean-up process. Any replacement permits
or permits needed for construction or demolition equipment after
the cessation of the officially declared State of Emergency would
be processed by the AQMD in an expedited manner.
<P>
<U><B>POLICY ISSUES</B></U> 
<P>
Not applicable.
<P>
<U><B>AQMP AND LEGAL MANDATES</B></U> 
<P>
Not applicable.
<P>
<U><B>CEQA AND SOCIOECONOMIC ANALYSES</B></U> 
<P>
AQMD staff has reviewed the proposed rule and determined it is
exempt from the requirements of the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA). As already noted, the proposed rule establishes guidelines
for suspending or modifying compliance with existing rules, regulations,
or permit conditions in areas designated as being under a State
of Emergency by the state or federal government. CEQA recognizes
the need to exempt projects during emergencies in order to protect
public safety or maintain, repair, restore, or replace property
or facilities damaged or destroyed as a result of an area-wide
disaster. Therefore, consistent with CEQA's recognition that projects
operating in emergency areas should be exempt from the requirements
of CEQA, the AQMD has concluded that proposed Rule 118 is exempt
pursuant to the following provisions: CEQA Guidelines Section
15269, statutory exemption for emergency projects; Public Resources
Code (PRC) Section 21172, exemption for projects within state
of emergency areas; PRC Section 21080(b)(2), emergency repairs
to public service facilities necessary to maintain service; and
PRC Section 21080(b)(3), projects to maintain, repair, restore,
etc., property or facilities destroyed as a result of a disaster
in a disaster-stricken area in which a State of Emergency has
been proclaimed. A Notice of Exemption prepared pursuant to CEQA
Guidelines 15062 - Notice of Exemption will be filed with the
county clerks immediately following the Governing Board's approval
of this rule.
<P>
Proposed Rule 118 is not expected to cause any adverse socioeconomic
impacts. It may provide potential cost reductions to facilities
affected by the emergency by suspending specified AQMD orders,
rules or regulations that would have otherwise been applicable.
<P>
<U><B>IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</B></U> 
<P>
The AQMD held a public consultation meeting on October 24, 1995,
to solicit input regarding the proposed rule and how AQMD rules
could be suspended efficiently with the least inconvenience to
the regulated public. Staff has incorporated several changes to
the proposed rule as a result of comments received. A recommendation
was made at the consultation meeting that the AQMD prepare implementation
guidelines. That proposal is considered to be unnecessary at this
time as the guidelines were seen as likely to hinder the rule's
desired flexibility. Responses to comments received can be found
in the Staff Report for this rule proposal.
<P>
<U><B>RESOURCE IMPACTS</B></U> 
<P>
AQMD resources may be temporarily impacted as a result of the
proposed rule. Staff may be required to assist with expedited
permit processing for the replacement of destroyed equipment or
for the use of emergency equipment needed on a temporary basis.
In addition, the Public Advisor's Office would participate in
conveying the message to the regulated public regarding the temporary
suspension of specific AQMD rules, regulations or orders. Any
resource impacts as a result of the rule, however, would be temporary
and would likely have occurred as a result of the emergency irrespective
of the proposed rule.

<P>
<I>It is estimated that approximately $25 million in vehicle registration
fee revenues will be available in the AB 2766 Discretionary Fund
in FYs 1995-96 and 1996-97. On November 9, 1995, the MSRC adopted
a two-year AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program. This Work Program
allocates funds to projects in three categories: 1) Alternate
Fuels Projects: Public Transit Fleets, School Bus Fleets, and
Heavy-Duty Vehicles; 2) Special Projects: Rail Feeder/Rail Station
Distribution, Transportation Control Measures, and Research and
Development; and 3) Zero-Emission Vehicle &quot;Quick Charge&quot;
Outreach Coordinator. Target funding for these categories are
as follows: 1) Alternate Fuels Projects--$9.5 million; 2) Special
Projects--$5.5 million; and 3) ZEV &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Program--$7
million. The remaining $3 million has been set aside to fund other
focused areas which the MSRC is currently exploring in addition
to administrative and statutorily required costs. The MSRC requests
that the Board approve the MSRC's FY 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary
Work Program and authorize the Chairman of the Board to execute
agreements for FY 1995-96 AB 2766 Discretionary Fund.</I>

with a menu of emission reduction options, which employers can
choose to reduce mobile source emissions in order to meet their
site-specific emission reduction target. The proposed rule would
also include optional participation in an Air Quality Investment
program and the voluntary use of employee commute reduction activities
as alternative compliance options. Proposed Rule 2202 is designed

</B>(Lloyd)<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:alloyd@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
(alloyd@aqmd.gov )
<P>
<I>During the last year several Advisory Council members have

<U><B>PUBLIC HEARINGS</B></U> 
<P>
<B>29. Amend Regulation XIII - New Source Review and Rule 212
- Standards for Approving Permits<BR>
</B>(Leyden)(909) 396-3120<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:pleyden@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
(pleyden@aqmd.gov )<BR>
<I>(Continued from the November 17, 1995 Board Meeting)</I> 
<P>
<I>The proposed amendments to Regulation XIII will address state
and federal NSR regulatory requirements. This proposal will replace
the Community Bank with a four tons per year exemption level;
define the equivalency demonstration process; narrow exemptions;
streamline trading zones; forgive exempt emission increases resulting
from the transition out of ozone-depleting compounds. The proposed
amendments will also address internal combustion engines to be
consistent with EPA's national requirements.</I> 
<P>
<B>30. Adopt Proposed Rule 2100 - Registration of Portable Equipment
<BR>
</B>(Broadbent)(909) 396-3789<BR>
<A HREF="mailto: jbroadbent@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
(jbroadbent@aqmd.gov)<BR>
<I>(Continued from the November 17, 1995 Board Meeting)</I> 
<P>
<I>The proposed rule would establish an inter-district registration
program for certain portable equipment. The public hearing in
July was continued after public testimony identified a number
of issues, including Assembly Bill 531, that would directly affect
the program. Staff has clarified language in the rule on filing
for registration and in the staff report on the definition of
a project. Internal combustion engines used on marine dredges
have been added as an eligible source. In addition, staff proposes
the rule to be an interim measure for internal combustion engines
until state regulations for these sources go into effect.</I>

<P>
<B>31. Adopt Proposed Rule 518.2 - Federal Alternative Operating
Conditions <BR>

<P>
<I><B>The public hearing on this item will be continued to the
January 12, 1996 Board meeting.</B></I> 
<P>
<B>32. Amend Rule 1134 - Emission of Oxides of Nitrogen from Stationary
Gas Turbines<BR>
</B>(Coy)(909) 396-2434<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:ccoy@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
(ccoy@aqmd.gov )
<P>
<I>The proposed amendments will address SIP recommendations identified
by the U.S. EPA and exempt existing gas turbine units in SEDAB
which are used for pipeline gas transfer and units in SEDAB and
on San Clemente Island which are rated below 4 MW and which operate
less than 877 hours per year. In addition, the amendments include
minor clarifying modifications to the rule.</I> 
<P>
<B>33. Rescind Rule 1129 - Aerosol Coatings and Amend Rules 1106.1
- Pleasure Craft Coating Operations; 1107 - Coating of Metal Parts
and Products; 1128 - Paper, Fabric, and Film Coating Operations;
1130 - Graphic Arts; 1145 - Plastic, Rubber, and Glass Coatings;
and 1151 - Motor Vehicle and Mobile Equipment Non-Assembly Line
Coating Operations<BR>
</B>(Broadbent)(909) 396-3789<BR>
<A HREF="mailto: jbroadbent@aqmd.gov"><IMG Align=Top SRC="/icon/mails.gif" ALT="Mail"></A>
(jbroadbent@aqmd.gov)
<P>
<I>The rescinding of Rule 1129 and proposed amendment of the other
coating rules are necessary to make AQMD rules consistent with
Section 41712 of the state Health and Safety Code which prohibits
local districts from enforcing or regulating VOC limits on aerosol
coatings. In addition, the proposed amendment of the definition
of &quot;exempt compounds&quot; in each rule will reference Rule
102 - Definition of Terms, to provide a consistent definition
between rules.</I> 
<P>
<B>34. Adopt Proposed Rule 118 - Emergencies <BR>
</B>(Liu)(909) 396-2105
<P>
<I>The proposed rule is in response to public concern regarding
the potential need for emergency support, extended hours of operation,
or additional equipment not permitted by the AQMD in the event
of a State of Emergency. The proposed rule will allow the Executive
Officer the discretion to suspend AQMD rules and regulations in
the event of a Governor-declared State of Emergency. The suspension
would be specific to the needs and circumstances of the emergency
and may apply only to specific areas of the South Coast Air Basin.
This item was reviewed and approved by the Stationary Source Committee
on October 27, 1995.</I> 
<P>
<B>35. Amend Regulation XX - Regional Clean Air Incentive Market
(RECLAIM) <BR>

<I>The proposed amendments will make changes suggested by EPA
to receive SIP approval. Issues include: definitions, variances,
NSR, Executive Officer discretion, test methods, and Economic
Incentive Program showings. The proposal also reviews technologies
for glass melting furnaces, gray portland cement kilns, steel
slab reheating, metal melting furnaces, and hot mix asphalt. Revisions
will be proposed for year 2000 emission factors for some of these
industries. Additionally, staff has made rule clarifications and
proposed two exemptions from RECLAIM for ski resorts and San Clemente
Island.</I>

<P>
<I>At its October 13, 1995 meeting, the Board directed staff to
return in December with a new rule designed to replace Rules 1501
- Work Trip Reduction Plans and Rule 1501.1 - Alternatives to
Work Trip Reduction Plans. Proposed Rule 2202 would provide employers
with a menu of emission reduction options, which employers can
choose to reduce mobile source emissions in order to meet their
site-specific emission reduction target. The proposed rule would
also include optional participation in an Air Quality Investment
program and the voluntary use of employee commute reduction activities
as alternative compliance options. Proposed Rule 2202 is designed
to result in equivalent emission reductions to implementation
of Rules 1501 and 1501.1.</I>

<P>
<B>December 12, 1995</B>
<P>
<B>(par5182d)</B>
<P>
<B>PROPOSED RULE 518.2   FEDERAL ALTERNATIVE OPERATING CONDITIONS</B>
<P>
(a) Purpose
<P>
This rule establishes procedures by which a Title V facility,
as defined in subdivision (b) of Rule 3000 - General, obtaining
a variance from the District Hearing Board may obtain approval
of an Alternative Operating Condition that would be recognized
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  Hearing
Board approval of an Alternative Operating Condition pursuant
to the requirements of this rule would shield the petitioner from
enforcement pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act of otherwise-applicable
requirements specifically addressed by the Alternative Operating
Condition.
<P>
(b) Definitions
<P>
(1) ALTERNATIVE OPERATING CONDITION means an order established
by the Hearing Board pursuant to subdivision (e) of this rule
which authorizes a source to be operated in a specified manner
which would otherwise not comply with an applicable requirement
of the State Implementation Plan or a permit term or condition
based on any such applicable requirement.
<P>
(2) APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS means all requirements listed in paragraph
(c)(1).
<P>
(3) EXCESS EMISSIONS  means the amount of emissions from a source,
stated in pounds per month, which exceeds the amount of emissions
that would be allowed if the source were operated in compliance
with an applicable requirement, calculated pursuant to paragraph
(h)(1) of this rule.
<P>
(4) FACILITY means any permit unit or source, or grouping of permit
units or sources, or other air contaminant-emitting activities
which are located on one or more contiguous properties within
the District, in actual physical contact or separated solely by
a public roadway or other public right-of-way, and are owned or
operated by the same person (or by persons under common control),
or an outer continental shelf (OCS) source as defined in 40 CFR
Section 55.2.  Such above-described groupings, if on noncontiguous
properties, but connected only by land carrying a pipeline, shall
not be considered one facility.  Equipment or installations involved
in crude oil and gas production in Southern California coastal
or OCS waters, and transport of such crude oil and gas in Southern
California coastal or OCS waters, shall be included in the same
facility which is under the same ownership or use entitlement
as the crude oil and gas facility on shore.
<P>
(5) SOURCE  means any discrete operation, unit or pollutant-emitting
activity at a facility.
<P>
(6) TITLE V FACILITY means any facility that meets the criteria
set forth in subdivision (a), (b) or (c) of Rule 3001 - Applicability.
<P>
(c) Applicability
<P>
(1) This rule authorizes the District Hearing Board to establish
Alternative Operating Conditions for Title V facilities.  Alternative
Operating Conditions may be established for the following statute
and District rules and regulations, and for federally-enforceable
permit terms and conditions that are based on such statute, rules
and regulations:
<P>
(A) Health and Safety Code Section 41701;
<P>
(B) Rules 202, 203, 217, 218 and 221;
<P>
(C) Regulation IV, except Rules 402 and 430;
<P>
(D) Regulation VII;
<P>
(E) Regulation XI;
<P>
(F) Regulation XV; and
<P>
(G) Regulation XX, except-
<P>
(i) any provisions which require Permits to Construct or which
set forth requirements for Permits to Construct,
<P>
(ii) missing data provisions of Appendix A, Chapter 2 of Rule
2011 - Requirements for Monitoring, Reporting, and Recordkeeping
for Oxides of Sulfur (SOx) Emissions, and Appendix A, Chapter
2 of Rule 2012 - Requirements for Monitoring, Reporting, and Recordkeeping
for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) Emissions, and
<P>
(iii) subdivisions (b) and (d) of Rule 2004 - Requirements, and
any permit conditions which state annual Allocations.
<P>
(2) No Alternative Operating Condition shall be granted from any
federally<U> </U>promulgated rule, regulation or permit condition,
including but not limited to the following:
<P>
(A)  the requirement to apply for and obtain an operating permit
under Rule 3002 - Requirements, or an authority to construct;
<P>
(B)  any requirement of NSPS, NESHAP or other standard promulgated
by the U.S. EPA under Sections 111 or 112 of the Clean Air Act;
<P>
(C)  any standard promulgated by the U.S. EPA under Title IV or
Title VI of the Clean Air Act; or
<P>
(D) any requirement contained in a permit issued by the U.S. EPA.
<P>
(3) No Alternative Operating Condition shall be granted from any
rule or provision for which a variance is not allowed under Rule
504 - Rules for Which Variances Are Not Allowed.
<P>
(d) Modification of Applicable Requirements
<P>
A source shall not be subject to a provision of an applicable
requirement specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this rule if the
source is subject to an Alternative Operating Condition established
for such provision.  <U>During its term, an Alternative Operating
Condition shall constitute a revision to the facility's Title
V permit for the source.</U>
<P>
(e) Establishment of Alternative Operating Conditions
<P>
(1) Alternative Operating Conditions may be established only by
the District Hearing Board upon petition relating to a specified
source.
<P>
(2) A petitioner shall not receive an Alternative Operating Condition
unless all of the following circumstances exist:
<P>
(A) the petitioner is or will be in violation of any applicable
requirement(s) listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this rule;
<P>
(B) due to conditions beyond the reasonable control of the petitioner,
requiring compliance would result in either (1) an arbitrary or
unreasonable taking of property or (2) the practical closing and
elimination of a lawful business. In making those findings pursuant
to paragraph (4) where the petitioner is a public agency, the
Hearing Board shall consider whether or not requiring immediate
compliance would impose an unreasonable burden upon an essential
public service.  For purposes of this subparagraph, &quot;essential
public service&quot; means a prison, detention facility, police
or fire-fighting facility, school, health care facility, landfill
gas control or processing facility, sewage treatment works, or
water delivery operation, if owned and operated by a public agency;
<P>
(C) the closing or taking would be without a corresponding benefit
in reducing air contaminants;
<P>
(D) the petitioner for the Alternative Operating Condition has
given consideration to curtailing operations of the source in
lieu of obtaining an Alternative Operating Condition;
<P>
(E) during the period the Alternative Operating Condition is in
effect, the petitioner will reduce excess emissions to the maximum
extent feasible;
<P>
(F) during the period the Alternative Operating Condition is in
effect, the petitioner will monitor or otherwise quantify emission
levels from the source, and report these emission levels to the
District pursuant to a schedule established by the District;
<P>
(G) the Alternative Operating Condition will not result in noncompliance
with the requirements of any NSPS, NESHAP or other standard promulgated
by the U.S. EPA under Sections 111 or 112 of the Clean Air Act,
or any standard or requirement promulgated by the U.S. EPA under
Titles IV or VI of the Clean Air Act, or any requirement contained
in a permit issued by the U.S. EPA, or other requirement contained
in paragraph (c)(2); and
<P>
(H) any emissions (calculated pursuant to subparagraph (h)(3)(B)
of this rule) resulting from the Alternative Operating Condition
will not, in conjunction with emissions (calculated pursuant to
subparagraph (h)(3)(B)) resulting from all other Alternative Operating
Conditions established by the Hearing Board and in effect at the
time, cause an exceedance of the monthly or annual SIP Allowance
established pursuant to subdivision (i) of this rule.
<P>
(3) The Hearing Board shall not establish an Alternative Operating
Condition unless the Board establishes, as part of the Alternative
Operating Condition, enforceable alternative emission limits,
operational requirements, and/or monitoring and record keeping
provisions, as set forth in subdivision (g).
<P>
(4) The Hearing Board shall not establish an Alternative Operating
Condition unless it makes findings that the circumstances described
in paragraph (e)(2) exist.  The findings shall be based on evidence
in the record of a public hearing which is noticed and conducted
in compliance with Health and Safety Code Sections 40820-40865,
<U>except in the case of an Alternative Operating Condition established
by the Board or a single member thereof under circumstances specified
in Health &amp; Safety Code Section 42359 or 42359.5.  An Alternative
Operating Condition established by the Board under circumstances
specified in Health &amp; Safety Code Section 42359 shall be based
on evidence in the record of a public hearing which is conducted
pursuant to Health &amp; Safety Code Sections 40820, 40822, and
40828-40865.  An Alternative Operating Condition established by
a single Board member under circumstances specified in Health
&amp; Safety Code Section 42359.5 shall be based on evidence presented
in the form of a petition and declaration signed under penalty
of perjury, and may be supplemented by sworn oral testimony.</U>
<P>
(f) EPA Objection; Effective Date of Alternative Operating Condition
<P>
(1) Each Alternative Operating Condition shall be subject to review
for 45 days by the public, any affected state, and the U.S. EPA.
 The review period may commence prior to approval of the Alternative
Operating Condition by the Hearing Board and, in such event, will
satisfy this subdivision if the terms of the Alternative Operating
Condition approved by the Hearing Board do not significantly deviate
from the proposed terms which were made available to the public,
affected states, and the U.S. EPA.
<P>
(2) If the terms of the Alternative Operating Condition approved
by the Hearing Board significantly deviate from proposed terms
released for review, the approved terms must be subjected to the
notice requirements of paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(4) and the process
requirements of paragraph (f)(5).
<P>
(3) The 45-day review period shall commence upon the U.S. EPA's
receipt of the following information:
<P>
(A) a copy of the proposed or issued Alternative Operating Condition;
<P>
(B) information sufficient to support the findings set forth in
subdivision (e); and
<P>
(C) the name of any affected state as defined in subdivision (b)
of Rule 3000 - General.
<P>
(4) Notification to the public and affected states shall commence
upon the date of notice as specified in Rule 3006 - Public Participation,
including publication in a daily newspaper of general circulation.
<P>
(5) If EPA objects to the Alternative Operating Condition in writing
within the 45 day review period, in the manner set forth in paragraph
(k)(1) of Rule 3003 - Applications--
<P>
(A) the District shall notify the petitioner of U.S. EPA's objection;
and
<P>
(B) the Alternative Operating Condition shall be ineffective unless
the Hearing Board adopts  and submits to U.S. EPA a revised Alternative
Operating Condition which conforms to such objection <U>or EPA
issues a written rescission to its objection.</U>
<P>
(6) If the U.S. EPA does not object to the Alternative Operating
Condition, it shall become operative, effective as of the date
of issuance by the Hearing Board, subject to the provisions of
subdivision (l) of  Rule 3003 - Applications.  The effective date
<U>shall</U> be the date of filing the petition with the Hearing
Board if the Board determines that excess emissions during the
period between the filing of the petition and the issuance of
the Alternative Operating Condition by the Hearing Board are quantifiable<U>
and that all circumstances specified in paragraph (e)(2) existed
during this period</U>.  <STRIKE>In such event, the Hearing Board
shall quantify such excess emissions and may make the Alternative
Operating Condition effective from the date of filing of the petition
if sufficient emissions were present in the SIP allowance for
that period.</STRIKE>
<P>
(g) Content of Alternative Operating Conditions
<P>
 Each Alternative Operating Condition shall contain the following
provisions, as applicable:
<P>
(1) Emission Limits
<P>
 If an Alternative Operating Condition allows emissions that are
greater than an emission limit in an applicable requirement, the
Hearing Board shall establish an enforceable alternative emission
limit which requires the source to reduce excess emissions to
the maximum extent feasible. The Hearing Board may establish an
alternative emission limit for any source located at the facility
which creates emissions of the subject pollutant that may feasibly
be reduced.
<P>
(2) Operational Requirements
<P>
 If an Alternative Operating Condition allows deviation from an
applicable operational requirement which is designed to limit
or minimize emissions, the Hearing Board shall establish an enforceable
alternative operational requirement or emission limit which requires
the source to operate in a manner that reduces excess emissions
to the maximum extent feasible.  The Hearing Board may establish
an alternative operational requirement or emission limit for any
source located at the facility which creates emissions of the
subject pollutant that may feasibly be reduced.
<P>
(3) Monitoring, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Requirements
<P>
If the Alternative Operating Condition allows deviation from an
applicable emissions monitoring, recordkeeping or reporting requirement,
the Hearing Board shall establish an enforceable alternative requirement
which, to the extent feasible:
<P>
(A) mandates quantification, recordkeeping, and reporting of emissions
as accurately, expeditiously, and verifiably as the applicable
requirement,
<P>
(B) complies with the requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of Rule
3004 - Permit Type and Content, and
<P>
(C) for RECLAIM sources, complies with the RECLAIM protocols for
monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.
<P>
(4) Conditions
<P>
 The Hearing Board shall impose conditions, other than those imposed
by applicable requirements, which are necessary to ensure quantifiability
of emissions increases, and any decreases, resulting from the
Alternative Operating Condition.
<P>
(5) Stringency
<P>
 Any alternative requirement or other condition imposed pursuant
to this subdivision shall not be more stringent than an applicable
requirement, except when consented to by the petitioner for purposes
of <U>excess</U> emissions mitigation.
<P>
(6) Term
<P>
 Each Alternative Operating Condition established by the Hearing
Board shall include a term during which the Alternative Operating
Condition shall be in effect.  The term shall be determined in
accordance with Health and Safety Code Sections 42352 and 42358.
 Upon termination of the Alternative Operating Condition, the
source shall comply with all applicable requirements and the preexisting
permit term(s) shall have full force and effect.
<P>
(7) EPA Objection
<P>
 Each Alternative Operating Condition shall contain a provision
stating that if the U.S. EPA objects to the Alternative Operating
Condition within 45 days, the Alternative Operating Condition
is ineffective to protect the petitioner from U.S. EPA or citizen
enforcement under the federal Clean Air Act for any federally
enforceable requirement.
<P>
(h) Emissions Calculations
<P>
For purposes of determining whether or not the SIP allowance is
exceeded, as set forth in subparagraph (e)(2)(H) of this rule,
the amount of excess emissions resulting from establishment of
an Alternative Operating Condition, and the amount of any emission
reductions resulting from conditions included in the Alternative
Operating Condition, shall be determined in the following manner:
<P>
(1) Excess Emissions
<P>
Excess emissions from the source which is or will be in violation
of an applicable<U> </U>requirement shall be calculated as follows:
<P>
(A) calculate calendar monthly mass emissions allowed by the applicable
requirement based on the terms of the applicable requirement and
projected activity during the term of the Alternative Operating
Condition;
<P>
(B) calculate calendar monthly mass emissions allowed by the Alternative
Operating Condition based on any alternative emission limits,
operational requirements and other conditions established pursuant
to subdivision (g), and projected activity during the term of
the Alternative Operating Condition; and
<P>
(C) subtract the calendar monthly mass emissions calculated pursuant
to subparagraph (A) from the calendar monthly <U>mass</U> emissions
calculated pursuant to subparagraph (B).
<P>
(2) Emission Reduction<U> </U>
<P>
The amount of emission reduction from a source other than the
source which is or will be in violation of an applicable requirement,
shall be calculated as follows:
<P>
(A) (i) calculate the sum of actual emissions from the source,
as determined from emission fee reports filed pursuant to Rule
301 -<U> </U>Permit Fees, or other credible evidence provided
by the petitioner and approved by the Hearing Board, whichever
is less, which have occurred during the highest three of the last
five years immediately preceding the date of petition, or other
appropriate period approved by the Hearing Board if the source
had not operated consistently during the preceding five years;
and
<P>
 (ii) calculate the monthly mass emissions for the three years
or other appropriate period by dividing the sum of actual emissions
calculated pursuant to clause (i) by thirty-six or by the number
of months in the other appropriate period approved pursuant to
clause (i);
<P>
(B) calculate the calendar monthly mass emissions allowed by the
Alternative Operating Condition based on any alternative emissions
limits, operational requirements and other conditions established
pursuant to subdivision (g) and projected activity during the
term of the Alternative Operating Condition; and
<P>
(C) subtract the calendar monthly mass emissions determined pursuant
to subparagraph (B) from the monthly mass emissions calculated
pursuant to subparagraph (A).
<P>
(3) SIP Allowance Balance Determination
<P>
(A) The Hearing Board will maintain a record of the balance of
emissions in the SIP Allowance for each calendar month.
<P>
(B) The amount of emissions that will be debited as a result of
an Alternative Operating Condition will be determined by subtracting
the emission reduction calculated pursuant to paragraph (2), and
the amount of any emission reduction credits temporarily surrendered
by the petitioner pursuant to paragraph (5), from excess emissions
calculated pursuant to paragraph (1).  Emissions calculated pursuant
to this subparagraph shall be subtracted from the monthly and
annual SIP Allowance balance for the applicable period.
<P>
(4) The petitioner shall notify the Hearing Board within five
days after achieving continuous compliance with an applicable
requirement for which an Alternative Operating Condition has been
issued.  Upon notification, the Alternative Operating Condition
for that applicable requirement shall expire.  Any unused emissions
previously allocated to a petitioner will be restored by the Hearing
Board to the SIP Allowance balance for the same period from which
they were originally debited.
<P>
(5) For non-RECLAIM sources, and non-RECLAIM pollutants at RECLAIM
sources, the amount of excess emissions calculated pursuant to
paragraph (h)(1) may be reduced by the amount of emission reduction
credits or offsets approved pursuant to Regulation XIII - New
Source Review, which the facility voluntarily relinquishes for
the term of the Alternative Operating Condition. Relinquishment
of ERCs shall not be deemed to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph
(e)(2)(E).  Executive Officer will not issue a Permit to Construct
which relies upon ERCs relinquished pursuant to this paragraph
during the period for which such ERCs have been relinquished.
 The Executive Officer shall not discount the value of ERCs due
to relinquishment pursuant to this paragraph.
<P>
(6) An Alternative Operating Condition applicable to RECLAIM pollutants
emitted by a RECLAIM source shall be deemed to not result in any
excess emissions for purposes of this subdivision.  This paragraph
does not relieve a RECLAIM facility of any obligation pursuant
to Regulation XX - RECLAIM.
<P>
(i) SIP Allowance
<P>
The monthly and annual SIP Allowance for each air contaminant

       made on the implementation of the California Reformulated                        
       Gasoline (CaRFG) program. CaRFG is a state-mandated program                      
       that requires production and use of a cleaner-burning                            
       gasoline. The use of CaRFG will significantly reduce                             
       emissions of unhealthful pollutants and help the AQMD meet                       
       its air quality objectives.

       At the January 12, 1996 meeting, the Board directed staff,                       
       at the suggestion of Chairman Mikels, to evaluate several                        
       options for providing regulatory relief for primary and                          
       secondary schools subject to Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor                           
       Vehicle Mitigation Options. A staff report has been                              
       prepared in response to this request and is presented for                        
       Board consideration.                                                             


 3.    Set Public Hearing March 8, 1996 to Amend Subdivision (l)    <B>Wallerstein/3131</B>    
       of Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options,     
       Pertaining to Possible Establishment of an Exemption for                         
       Primary and Secondary School Districts                                           

       At the December 8, 1995 Board Hearing, the Board adopted                         
       Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options, and                        
       directed staff to bring back information and necessary                           
       documents to allow consideration of a possible exemption of                      
       primary and secondary school districts.  This report                             
       discusses background information on the school exemption                         
       issues, including potential pollutant emissions impacts.                         
       Rule language that would exempt primary and secondary                            
       schools as well as other school district facilities is                           
       provided in the event the Board elects to adopt such an                          
       exemption.

        the Funding for Systems Development Work                                        

       At its June 10, 1994, meeting, the Board approved a                              
       contract with Telos Consulting Services (Telos) to provide                       
       system development services on a task-by-task basis. This                        
       is a basic ordering agreement, where specific work is                            
       defined, and individual task orders issued. During the                           
       contract period, additional funding is needed as system                          
       development requirements are identified. Staff recommends                        
       that the contract be modified to add additional funding in                       
       the amount of $100,000 to accommodate identified projects                        
       through June 1996. Funding is included in the Fiscal Year                        
       1995-96 budget for Information Management to cover these                         
       expenses.  This item was reviewed and approved by the                            
       Administrative Committee on January 19, 1996.

       Rule 701, as amended on September 8, 1995, removed the                           
       requirements for schools and industry to maintain an                             
       antiquated radio system to receive daily air quality                             
       forecast and episode declaration. In its place, the AQMD                         
       committed to explore new-technology methods to provide                           
       episode notification to school districts. Staff recommends                       
       that the Board authorize the reallocation of $40,000 of                          
       budgeted funds into the Professional and Special Services                        
       Account to fund contractual services for providing a                             
       communications link to the school districts.  This item was                      
       reviewed and approved by the Administrative Committee on                         
       January 19, 1996.

       At its October 1995 meeting, the Board approved the release                      
       of a Request for Proposals to privatize portions of the                          
       annual emissions report program. All proposals submitted                         
       were evaluated and ranked by a panel comprised of AQMD                           
       staff and representatives from The Gas Company and the                           
       California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance.                       
       Staff recommends that the Board award the contract to the                        
       successful bidder. Funding is included in Planning and                           
       Policy's FY 1995-96 budget.  This item was reviewed and                          
       approved by the Administrative Committee on January 19,                          
       1996.

       Source Emissions Testing by Outside Contractors                                  

       AQMD has used private sector source emission testing                             
       services since 1987 to augment and enhance its source                            
       testing capabilities.  Applied Science and Technology                            
       proposes to continue this contracting effort at a level                          
       between 125-150 source compliance tests annually, beginning                      
       August 1, 1996.  Such compliance testing will be conducted                       
       using AQMD test methods in accordance with AQMD quality                          
       assurance practices and subject to AQMD review.  The                             
       maximum total dollar amount to be contracted out is

       Collective bargaining mediation discussions between AQMD                         
       management and representatives of the San Bernardino Public

       Mobile and Stationary Source Emissions Credit Programs                           

       In April 1995, the Board initiated the Intercredit Trading                       
       Study. The objective of this study is to assess the                              
       feasibility of linking the AQMD's mobile and stationary                          
       emissions credit trading programs to increase compliance                         
       flexibility while achieving air quality goals. In October                        
       1995, AQMD staff released for public review a draft paper                        
       on issues surrounding intercredit trading. Four workshops                        
       were held in November. Based on public comments received,                        
       staff is finalizing policy recommendations and an action

       Pertaining to Fees for the Air Quality Investment Program                        

       At the December 1995 Board Hearing, the Board adopted Rule                       
       2202 - On-Road Vehicle Mitigation Options, and directed

<P><B>1.</B><B> </B><B>Execute a Contract to Cost-Share a Follow-Up Tunnel
Study to Evaluate the Impact </B><B>of Reformulated Phase 2 Gasoline on Emissions
from Vehicles</B>
<P> The Coordinating Research Council (CRC), with AQMD's cofunding, conducted
a nationwide tunnel study in 1995 that included the Sepulveda and Van Nuys
tunnels.  The proposed contract with CRC will be a follow-up study at either
or both of the Sepulveda and Van Nuys tunnels after the introduction of Phase
2 reformulated gasoline.  The results will be compared to the 1995 study
to evaluate the actual on-road impact of Phase 2 gasoline on vehicle emissions.

Demonstration of Phase-2 </B><B>Electric US Postal Service Long-Life Vehicles
(LLVs)</B>
<P> The US Postal Service (USPS) is developing electric conversions for its
fleet of gasoline-powered Long-Life Vehicles (LLVs).  A Phase-1 demonstration
of two electric LLVs was successfully completed.  TransMotive Technologies,
in partnership with the USPS, now has proposed the development and demonstration
of a Phase-2 electric LLV conversion.  Following development, ten LLVs will
be converted with five to be demonstrated in mail delivery service in Huntington
Beach.  <I>The Committee reviewed the information presented and recommended
approval of </I><I>staff's recommendation.</I>
<P><B>4.</B><B> </B><B>Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Development and
Demonstration of an Electric </B><B>Vehicle Range Extender</B>
<P> The first electric vehicles to be offered for sale will have
lower-than-desired travel range due to battery limitations.  AC Propulsion
of San Dimas has proposed to develop and demonstrate an EV range extender
that will enable EVs to be used for long trips.  The availability of such
units should enhance the marketability of EVs and increase their number in
the vehicle fleet.  <I>The Committee reviewed the information
</I><I>presented and recommended approval of staff's recommendation.</I>
<P><B>5.</B><B> </B><B>Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Development and
Demonstration of Electric </B><B>Airport Ground Support Equipment (GSE)</B>
<P> The AQMP, as part of an emission control strategy for airlines and airports,
calls for airport ground support equipment (GSE) to operate on alternative
fuels, including electricity.  In response to the RFP, AQMD received only
one bid, from United Airlines (UAL), to develop an electric push-out tractor
for wide-body aircraft and an inductive charging system for electric baggage
tractors.  <I>Committee members </I><I>indicated the need to address the
issue of electromagnetic force (EMF) associated </I><I>with EVs.  TA staff
indicated they plan to bring to the Committee a Board Letter on </I><I>EMF
and health-related issues pertaining to EVs and EV charging infrastructure.
 The </I><I>Committee reviewed the information presented and recommended
approval of staff's </I><I>recommendation.</I>
<P><B>6.</B><B> </B><B>Execute a Cost-Shared Contract to Provide Technical
Information Relating to EV </B><B>Infrastructure</B>
<P> The California Electric Transportation Coalition (Cal ETC) has proposed
to supply the AQMD with technical information regarding the development and
implementation of EV infrastructure standards.  These include state building
codes, emergency-response standards, and charging hardware standards.  These
all relate to the upcoming introduction of EVs in the Basin by the major
automotive manufacturers.  <I>The Committee reviewed the information presented
and </I><I>recommended approval of staff's recommendation.</I>
<P><B>7.</B><B> </B><B>Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Development of
a Prototype Economical </B><B>Advanced Electric Vehicle and a Plan for California
Production</B>
<P> The ARB has identified several impediments to development and production
of EVs by the major vehicle manufacturers, including low-volume production,
uncertain market and undeveloped electric drivetrain and battery technologies.
 The proposed contract with ARB will result in a viable EV design and an
analysis of the processes and costs of developing and manufacturing low
production volumes of advanced EVs in California.  <I>The Committee reviewed
the information presented and noted their </I><I>tentative approval pending
further discussions with the ARB on the details of the </I><I>proposed program,
and contingent upon review by Administrative Committee.  </I><I>Moved by
Jon Mikels, seconded by Leonard Paulitz, to refer this item to
</I><I>Administrative Committee.</I>

<b>BOARD MEETING DATE:  June 14, 1996
<p>	
AGENDA NO. 10</b>
<p>
<b>Proposal</b>:	
<blockquote>Issue a Request for Proposals to Audit AB 2766 Fee Revenue Recipients for Fiscal Years 1993-94 and 1994-95.
</blockquote><p>
<b>Synopsis</b>:	
<blockquote>AB 2766 requires any agency that receives fee revenues subvened to the AQMD from the Department of Motor Vehicles to be audited once every two years.  The audit is to be performed by an independent Certified Public Accountant selected by the AQMD.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Committee</b>:	
<blockquote>Administrative, May 24, 1996, Recommended for Approval
</blockquote>
<b>Recommended Action</b>:
<blockquote>
Approve issuance of the RFP to audit AB 2766 Fee Revenue Recipients for FYs 1993-94 and 1994-95.
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>
James M. Lents, Ph.D.<br>
Executive Officer
<hr>
<p>
<b>Background</b><br>
AB 2766 was chaptered into law as Health and Safety Code Sections 44220-44247 
which were enacted to authorize air pollution control districts to impose fees 
on motor vehicles.  These fees are to be expended specifically for the purpose 
of mobile source air pollution reduction measures pursuant to the California 
Clean Air Act of 1988 or the AQMD's AQMP pursuant to Article 5 of Chapter 5.5 
of Part 3 of the Health and Safety Code.
<p>
The fee revenue is collected by the Department of Motor Vehicles and subvened 
to the AQMD.  It is distributed as follows:<br>
<ol><p>
<li>Forty cents of every dollar (40%) is placed in the Air Quality Improvement Trust Fund for quarterly disbursement to local governments;
<p>
<li>Thirty cents of every dollar (30%) is placed in the Mobile Source Air Pollution Re-duction Trust Fund for projects awarded by the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduc-tion Review Committee (MSRC) and approved by the AQMD's Board; and 
<p>
<li>Thirty cents of every dollar (30%) goes to support AQMD-approved programs for the reduction of emissions from mobile sources.
<p>
</ol>
AB 2766 audit requirements  state that any agency receiving fee revenues shall, at least once every two years, be subject to an audit of each program or project funded.  The audit is to be conducted by an independent auditor selected by the AQMD in accordance with Division 2 (commencing with Section 1100) of the Public Contract Code.
<p>
The first biennial audit for FYs 1991-92 and 1992-93 was conducted in FY 1994 and the findings reported to the Board in January 1995.
<p>
<b>Proposal</b><br>
The AQMD now is requesting proposals from qualified public accounting firms to per-form the audit of fee revenues received in FYs 1993-94 and 1994-95.  Staff proposes to present the report on the audit to the Board at the March, 1997 meeting.  Based on an opinion issued by the Deputy Attorney General of the State of California the audit will focus on the propriety of the expenditures, not their degree of efficacy in reducing air pollution.
<p>
The audit will cover the AQMD's use of the money, projects funded by the MSRC, and the use of fee revenues by selected local governments based on the audit guidelines.  Staff has worked extensively with local government representatives to assist local governments in compliance.
<p>
<b>Resources</b><br>
The cost of the audit will be borne by the entities being audited in the manner set forth in the audit guidelines included as Attachment 2 of the RFP and will be deducted from fee revenues prior to distribution.  Sufficient funding to cover AQMDs portion of the audit costs is included in the FY 1996-97 Budget.

<b><u>SECTION I - PUBLIC ADVISOR ACTIVITIES</b></u><br>
Staff participated in the activities, programs and events listed below.  A statistical report of these activities also is included.<br>
Contact:	La Ronda Bowen, Public Advisor, 909.396.3235.
<p>
<b>PUBLIC EDUCATION</b><br>
<b>EARTH DAY 96 -</b><br> The Public Advisors Office facilitated AQMDs participation in 33 Earth Day-related events throughout the basin in April. Fifteen events were staffed by Public Advisor, AQMD employees, and volunteers.  Another 18 events were supplied with information to distribute to the public about the impact of air quality on health and the environment.  The sites staffed for Earth Day included:  Cal State Northridge; Cal State San Bernardino, Cal Poly Pomona; Fullerton College; Chino Basin Water Conservation District in Montclair; Claremont McKenna College; and First Interstate World Center in Los Angeles.  Among the sites provided material were: City of Lynwood; City of Anaheim; City of Placentia; City of Orange; Loyola Law School; Rockwell International; Aerojet; Xerox; Oak Park Elementary School; University of La Verne; Allied Signal and Los Angeles Air Force Base.  Resources were deployed based on the size of the event and availability of volunteers or staff.<br>
<p>
<b>SMOGBUSTERS CLUB EVENT -</b><br> AQMD hosted its first annual Smogbusters Club meeting on April 13, 1996 at AQMD headquarters in Diamond Bar.  Members of the AQMDs Smogbuster Club for children, and others from throughout the basin, were in attendance.  Smogbusters is a free club for children sponsored by AQMD that promotes the voluntary reduction of air pollution through education and information.  Displays and exhibits at the event included natural gas buses, solar powered vehicles, electric cars and information booths.  Radio AHHS (AM830), the local childrens station, sponsored the event and provided entertainment and activities.  A dozen organizations participated, including Foothill Transit; Los Altos Solar Vehicle Club; John S. Malcom Elementary School (Laguna Niguel); Sunline Transit; Peace Pack; Cal Poly Pomona Center for Regenerative Studies; Metrolink Marketing; Los Angeles County Fire and Sheriffs departments; Southern California Edison; Radio AHHS and the Miracle Club from Laguna Niguel.  Public Advisor staff facilitated the event.
<p>
<b>VISITING DIGNITARIES -</b><br> Three delegations representing four countries visited AQMDs headquarters during the month of May:  A five-member delegation of Rotary Club members from Mexico City met with Public Advisor and Stationary Source Compliance staffs on Tuesday, April 16; a water quality official from Buenos Aires, and an official of Karachis EPA SINDH met with Public Advisor staff on Friday, April 19; and on Wednesday, April 24, Mr. Thomas Waring, Manager of the Minerals and Energy Group of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Research Economics, met with Stationary Source Compliance staff.
<p>
<p>
<b>BUSINESS OUTREACH</b><p>
<b>AMNESTY PROGRAM A SUCCESS</b><br>
On April 2, 1996, AQMDs 6-month Amnesty Program ended and was declared a success.  As a result of the program, an estimated 1,700 permit applications were submitted by businesses who were operating equipment for which they had never ob-tained the necessary permits.  An unprecedented outreach program was responsible for bringing in ten times more applications for existing equipment than had been received during the same period of the previous year.  Because of the Amnesty program, which was established as part of the Business Clean Air Partnership, these businesses saved more than $100,000 in late fees, and they were exempted from all other fines, penalties and back fees.  The program received a Gold Medal as the best amnesty program of the year from the Los Angeles Daily Journal.  The success of the program was attributed to the simplicity of the rule, an unprecedented outreach program, and the fact that AQMD provided free, on-site consultations to help businesses determine if permits were needed.  A similar amnesty program is now being offered at several other air districts, including the Bay Area AQMD.<p>

<b>BUDGET WORKSHOPS</b><br>
AQMD conducted a round of several workshops for the budget advisory committee which includes representatives from business and the environmental community.  The comments received during this process were taken into account in development of the three-year budget forecast as well as the FY 96-97 budget.
<p>
<b>PERMIT ASSISTANCE CENTER BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING</b><br>
On April 26, 1996, AQMD met with State and local officials who also serve on the Board of Directors for the State Permit Assistance Center located in Orange County.  The Governors Office representative discussed the possible expansion of the program to include another permit assistance center.  AQMD presented the results of its amnesty program, which received praise from several of the other board members representing businesses.

<b><u>SECTION III - SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES</b></u>
<p>
Highlights of a recent cooperative effort with the Gas Company Energy Resource Center in Downey are listed below.  A statistical report of general activities of the Small Business Assistance Office is also included.<br>
Contact: Lee Lockie, Director, 909.396.2390. 
<p>
<b>ENERGY RESOURCE CENTER</b><br>
The Gas Companys Energy Resource Center (ERC), located in Downey, is a one-stop center dedicated to providing the public with information on the latest energy-efficient, cost-effective and environmentally sensitive technologies.  Other resources include general technical assistance, computerized energy analysis, a materials and equipment exhibit and a state-of-the-art computer training facility.  The ERC is also home to a satellite office of the Air Quality Management District (AQMD).  Every Thursday, one AQMD staff member is present on-site to help businesses understand our environmental regulations, initiate and review air quality permit applications and expedite the permitting process.  When AQMD staff is not available on-site, a blue telephone, located at the center, can automatically direct dial the Small Business Assistance Office (SBAO) in Diamond Bar.  Assistance with any air quality related questions is available through this "Hot Line".  The AQMD is working with the ERC to expand awareness of the Air Quality Assistance Fund to customers of the Gas Company.
<p>
<u><b>Marketing</u></b>  - The AQMD is working to increase permitting activities at this field location, with a more focused outreach program to local businesses that may find this center a convenient place to do business.  The Gas Company is being very helpful in this effort by providing brochures and surveys to their customers.  AQMD Head-quarters engineers are also letting applicants know about the center.  Permit inquiries currently being received at the ERC are primarily from businesses with boilers, emergency engines, baghouses and charbroilers.
<p>
AQMD is contacting the following departments regularly to assure interagency coordination:<p><ol>

<li> <b>City and County Planning and Community Development Departments</b><br>
When new companies start up or move into a city or county, planning departments can have them fill out an AQMD permit checklist to determine if air quality permits or clearances are required.  Staff is increasing coordination with these departments in areas where permit activity is typically high. 
<p>
<li><b>City and County Building and Safety Departments</b><br>
When businesses come in for building, mechanical and electrical permits, these departments can provide an AQMD permit checklist to determine if air quality permits are required.   Staff plans to research the Districts faxback capabilities to improve communication with these departments.
<p>
<li><b>International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) Headquarters in Whittier </b><br>
Communication with ICBO is an effective vehicle for communicating with building officials.  State law prohibits city and county building departments from issuing certificates of occupancy to building permit applicants without obtaining a clearance letter from the AQMD.   Staff members have given presentations at ICBO conferences which have been helpful in increasing their awareness of the law and of efficient ways to implement the requirements.
<p>
<li><b>City, County, State and U.S. Elected Representatives Offices</b><br>
SBAO staff and Intergovernmental Affairs Officers are working together to alert these representatives of the need for air quality permits for their constituent businesses.  Staff is keeping them informed of our permit and compliance assistance efforts and "successes" in the areas they represent through workshops, meetings, and publications.
<p>
<li><b>Equipment Manufacturers and Distributors </b><br>
Certain manufacturers and distributors of equipment subject to AQMD permits have shown considerable interest in assisting their customers in applying for required air quality permits.  Most of the inquiries presently center on spray booths and scrubbers.  Staff members are currently working with manufacturers who need information on permits.  During the amnesty program, there were many instances where manufacturers made inquiries and submitted applications on behalf of their clients.

<b>FASHION EYEWEAR </b><br>
In 1994, a Governors Red Team was convened to discuss and resolve issues affecting
 an Orange County high end, fashion eyewear manufacturer.  The company had almost 
re-solved to move out of Orange County to San Diego, Nevada or Arizona where they 
could produce their product in a more cost-effective manner.  The various members 
of the Red Team worked through the issues and were able to successfully resolve 
most of the prob-lems encountered by this manufacturer.  After resolution of the 
issues, the company de-cided to remain within the basin and possibly expand at a 
later date.  The air quality is-sues included incorporating modern production 
techniques for their expansion, possible control technologies and/or low-VOC 
coating and guidance on permitting.  At a 1995 Red Team meeting, it was reported
 that the owners decided to remain in California but that they were going to do 
their expansion elsewhere.  After further interaction, the company has now decided 
 it will be expand its Southern California operations to include doubling its
 workforce in the very near future.  This will mean creation of approximately 
300 more jobs for the southern California area.  The company has already resolved
 and put into action, all of its air quality plans including purchase of emission 
reduction ce-tificates and installation of Best Available Control Technology (BACT).

<p>
<b>PROGRAM NOMINATION</b><br>
AQMDs office of Economic Development/Business Retention (EDBR) has been recognized
 as an organization that made a significant contribution to the advancement of the
 field of economic development.  In April 1996, staff attended the California 
Association for Local Economic Development (CALED) conference held in San Diego.
  Many of the 600 participants in the conference recognized the program for its 
innovative leadership to implement economic development policy in progressive, 
timely and cost effective manner.  Tangible evidence of this success includes over
  25,000 jobs having been created or retained in the South Coast Basin within
 companies of all sizes and types.
<p>
<b>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH REPORT</b><br>
On file in the office of  EDBR, is a study prepared  by Allan Gordon for
 the California Senate Office of Research.  The report is entitled "Myths of
 Jobs vs. Resources: Environmental Protections and Economic Growth." 
 It summarizes the issues and answers around the question of, "does the pursuit
 of environmental quality hinder opportunities for economic growth and development?"
  It concludes, that government regulations to protect natural resources extract a
 toll in lost jobs is largely mythical.  It further states that numerous 
studies have failed to find correlation between regional, state and federal 
environmental protection regulation and overall losses in productivity,
 in construction jobs; declining gross state products;
 weak economic performance; US capital investments abroad Californias
 prolonged recession or the US economys shift from manufacturing jobs to 
jobs in the service sector.   Other studies with similar conclusions have been
 conducted by the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, the Southern California
 Association of Governments, Stanford, UCLA and Cal State University at Fullerton.

Lead Agency Projects and Environmental Documents Received by the AQMD</blockquote>

<P><B>Synopsis</B>: <blockquote>
This report provides for the Board&#146;s 
consideration a listing of CEQA documents received by the 
AQMD between April 2, 1996 and May 1, 1996, and those 
projects for which the AQMD is acting as lead agency pursuant to CEQA.</blockquote>

<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.</P>
<br> Executive Officer
<hr>
<B>Background</B>
<br><U>EIR and Document Log (Attachments A and B)</U> - Each month, the AQMD receives numerous CEQA documents from other public agencies on projects which could adversely affect air quality.  A listing of all documents received for review during the past month are contained in Attachment A.  Monthly listings which are shaded note those CEQA documents for which the AQMD staff has or will prepare and submit comments to the lead agency.  A list of active projects from previous months for which AQMD staff is continuing to evaluate or prepare comments is included as Attachment B.  The column captioned &#147;Public Concerns&#148; identifies parties who have contacted the AQMD with concerns or issues about the proposed project.  A notation of 1 in this column indicates the contact was supportive of the project noted.  A notation of 2 indicates the party was opposed or expressed concerns about the project.  A notation of 3 indicates that no one contacted the AQMD about that project.</P>
<P>In the past, AQMD staff routinely reviewed many of these documents and commented upon the air quality analyses and possible impacts on the air quality of the district.  Due to staffing constraints, the AQMD is no longer able to routinely comment on all CEQA documents received.  Publication of the Board-approved <I>CEQA Air</I> <I>Quality Handbook</I>, however, has provided local governments and other public agencies with the necessary information to prepare appropriate air quality analyses on projects for which they act as lead agency.  As resources permit, staff evaluates and may prepare comments for projects that may have significant adverse regional air quality impacts (e.g., special event centers, landfills, etc.) and those projects for which a lead or responsible agency has specifically requested AQMD review.</P>
<P><U>AQMD Lead Agency Projects (Attachment C)</U> - Pursuant to CEQA, the AQMD periodically acts as lead agency on stationary source permit projects.  Under CEQA the lead agency is responsible for determining whether an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) or a Negative Declaration is necessary for any proposal considered to be a &quot;project&quot; as defined by CEQA.  An EIR is prepared when the AQMD as lead agency finds substantial evidence that the proposed project may have a significant adverse effect on the environment.  A Negative Declaration may be prepared if the AQMD determines that the proposed project will not generate significant adverse environmental impacts.  The Negative Declaration is a written statement describing the reasons a proposed project will not have a significant adverse effect on the environment and, therefore, does not require the preparation of an EIR.</P>
<P>Attachment C to this report summarizes the active projects for which the AQMD is lead agency and is currently preparing or has prepared environmental documentation.  As noted in Attachment C, during May 1996, the AQMD continued working on CEQA documents for three (3) active projects.</P>
<P>To date in 1996, the AQMD, as lead agency, prepared or contracted for the preparation of and certified one (1) CEQA document.</P>

<B>Background</B>
<P>As part of Resolution 90-49 adopting the 90-CVSIP, the Governing 
Board established a TWG comprised of District staff members and designated 
representatives from the Coachella Valley Association of Governments (CVAG). 
 The TWG's objectives are to evaluate technical information, pursue funding
 sources for local governments, and resolve technical issues encountered during 
the implementation of the Plan, which now includes the 1994 PM10 CVSIP revision.
  One of the requirements of the TWG is to prepare semi-annual reports for AQMD's
 Governing Board and CVAG's Executive Committee.</P>

<P>The attached report represents the TWG's tenth semi-annual report, 
covering the period July 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995.  
Key accomplishments during this six-month period include the following: </P>
<ol>
<p><li>CVAG acceptance of a technical report prepared by UC Riverside College of Engineering-Center for Environmental Research and Technology documenting that PM10-efficient street sweeping equipment is presently available;  </P>
<p><li>completion of all field reviews for PM10-reduction projects funded through the federal Congestion Management and Air Quality Improvement portion of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act;  </P>
<P><li>initiation of an <I>ad hoc</I> committee to evaluate long-term funding options for the clean streets management program; and </P>

<P>AB 2282 (Knox) and AB 2623 (Kuehl) --  Support

<BR>AB 2369 (Takasugi) --Title V Permits Support if Amended

<BR>SB 1868 (Hayden) -- Congestion Pricing:  L.A. MTA None (information only)
<BR>*Board Member Silva voted against an<I> Oppose</I> position
<BR>Staff provided a brief description of each bill and recommended position.  
<BR><UL><LI> <B>AB 2282</B> (Knox) and <B>AB 2623</B> (Kuehl) would allow solo drivers of low-emitting and electric vehicles to use carpool lanes.  This could help bolster sales and provide needed incentives for potential purchasers.   
<LI> <B>AB</B><B> </B><B>2369</B> (Takasugi) facilitates Title V operating permits, but needs modest changes to ensure consistency with federal guidelines.  
<LI> <B>AB 2635</B> (Morrissey) and <B>SB 1880</B> (Lewis) are two bills dealing with portable engines:</P>
</UL><P>SB 1880 provides a clearer definition of portable engines than in current law and only a minor amendment is needed to fully conform with the federal definition regarding seasonal use.  Staff expressed concern that AB 2635 (Morrissey) weakens AQMD&#146;s attainment plan by adding &#147;economically feasible&#148; to the criteria for portable engines.  Jeb Stuart, representing the construction industry which is sponsoring the bill, told the Committee they were proposing a series of amendments to address AQMD&#146;s concerns.  On a unanimous vote, the Committee decided to continue this item until the June 14 Governing Board Meeting and directed staff to continue discussions with the sponsor.  
<UL><LI> <B>AB 2937</B> (Olberg) is a regulatory reform initiative by the Assembly Republican Caucus.  The bill shifts how environmental regulations are enforced and redefines &#147;minor&#148; violations.  Staff indicated this would not allow us to prosecute most violations and recommended an <I>Oppose </I>position. 
<LI> <B>AB 3159</B> (Olberg) is a companion bill to AB 2937 (Brulte).  It could result in every violation having to go to court inside of being settled.  This would add a heavy administrative burden on District staff and require additional inspection resources.
<LI> <B>SB 1868</B> (Hayden) requires MTA to receive statutory authorization before imposing any congestion pricing mechanism.  Staff brought this bill to the Committee for information only and made no recommendation.
</UL><P>Staff reported that the Assembly Natural Resources Committee planned to hold a hearing on the AQMD&#146;s budget on June 3 (the hearing date has since been tentatively moved to June 10).  Chairman Mikels is scheduled to represent the District. </P>
<P><B>Other Business/Public Comment:  </B><BR>Public Member John Billheimer provided the Committee with information pertaining to Big Bear seceding from the SCAQMD.  In response, Executive Officer Jim Lents indicated that staff is considering area-specific regulations as part of updating the AQMD&#146;s Air Quality Management Plan.</P>

<P>Ronald O. Loveridge<br>
Vice Chair, Stationary Source Committee</P>
<hr>
<P><B>Attendance</B><br>
Present were Committee Vice Chair Ron Loveridge and Committee Members Candace Haggard and Nell Soto.  In the absence of Committee Chair Mee Hae Lee and Committee Member Marvin Braude, and pursuant to the Procedures for Standing Committees of the Governing Board adopted March 8, 1996, Chairman Mikels appointed himself and Board Member Leonard Paulitz ad hoc members of the Stationary Source Committee for the meeting May 24, 1996 only.  </P>

<P><B>Summary</B><br>
The Committee reviewed the items on their agenda (attached).  
Comments were noted on the following items:</P>
<ol>
<P><li><B>Regulation XIII - New Source Review</B></P>
<P><B> </B>Pom Pom Ganguli reported on some remaining clean-up issues -- technical clarifications, positive NSR balances, and methyl bromide fumigation offset exemption.  The Committee asked staff to work with construction industry representatives to address issues relative to the portable equipment under Rule 1304.</P>
<P><li><B>Facility Registration Program:  Initial Scoping Discussion</B></P>
<P> The issues of a Facility Registration Program were presented by Jill Whynot.  This is the first in a series of discussions to be brought before the Committee on this subject.  Her discussion included the investigation of a 3-tiered approach.  Tier 1 requires no permit, Tier 2 is simple registration, and Tier 3 is small business facility registration.  One suggestion for outreach is for Board Members to &#147;mentor&#148; industries.  The suggestion was well received by the Committee.</P>
<P> </P>
<P><li><B>Award Bid for Enhancement of Facility Permit Processing System</B></P>
<P> Vinita Mathur advised the Committee that the recommendation to execute a contract to enhance RECLAIM facility permit processing software would be before the Board at the June meeting.  The contract is with Sierra Cybernetics, Inc. in an amount not to exceed $400,000.</P>
<P><li><B>Discussion on Petroleum Coke Issue</B></P>
<P> Carol Coy discussed recent developments on the petroleum coke issue in the Los Angeles Harbor area.  There have been ongoing particulate problems in the area, and monitoring has shown violations in the open storage of the coke product.  Neighborhood associations are asking for help on this problem.  A public hearing will be held in July.  The Committee asked to be kept up to date on this issue.</P>

<P> Leonard Paulitz
<br> AQMD Board Representative on MSRC
<hr>
<P><B>Proposals Received by Deadline for </B>
<BR><B>Supplemental FY 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Work Program</B></P>
<P>The MSRC released five Requests for Proposals on April 12, 1996, in the following areas:  1) $725,000 for three innovative TCM RFPs in the areas of bicycle transportation, market incentives, and broad-based, land-use training for elected officials; 2) $900,000 for research and development projects; and 3) $1,800,000 for alternative-fueled, heavy-duty vehicles, targeting refuse and interstate trucks.  The deadline for these RFPs was Tuesday, May 21, 1996, by 5:00 p.m. A total of 54 proposals were received by the 5:00 p.m. deadline.  One late proposal was received, and will not be evaluated.  For your information a listing of the proposals received, including brief project descriptions and requested dollars, is provided as <I>Attachment 1</I>.</P>
<P><B>Election of MSRC Chair</B></P>
<P>The MSRC&#146;s policies and procedures stipulates that each May the Committee shall hold elections of its chair and vice-chair positions.  The incumbent chair, Rialto Mayor John Longville, who represents the Southern California Association of 
<BR>Governments, was re-elected for the third consecutive year.  Elections for the vice-chair position were postponed until the incumbent vice-chair could be present.</P>
<P><B>Update on Proposed CARB Amendments to Senate Bill 836 </B></P>
<P>Staff advised the MSRC of the proposed CARB amendments to Senate Bill 836 which would rescind Rule 2202 and authorize the CARB to take away $52 million in local funds, including the AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Program monies.  Board Member Leonard Paulitz, who represents the AQMD on the MSRC, reported that he sent out a legislative alert to all cities in San Bernardino County and plans to contact members of the Legislature relative to his opposition to the proposed amendments.  </P>
<P><B>Actual Staff and Miscellaneous Costs for FY 1995-96 Second &amp; Third Quarters</B></P>
<P>The total amount currently approved by the MSRC for FY 1995-96 staff and contract administration support and miscellaneous costs is $364,525 and technical support is $164,258.  Actual staff and contract administration support costs for FY 1995-96 second quarter were $92,065; and $32,982 for technical support.  Actual staff and contract administration support costs for FY 1995-96 third quarter were $82,638; and $26,401 for technical support.  To date, $350,229 has been incurred in staff and technical support costs.  Actual miscellaneous costs (i.e., mailing, office supplies) for FY 1995-96 second quarter were $7,290.14; and for FY 1995-96 third quarter, $6,676.13.  It is anticipated that all staff support and miscellaneous costs for FY 1995-96 will be <U>under</U> budget by approximately $22,000.  </P>
<P><B>Reimbursement of Staff Support and Other Costs for Fiscal Year 1996-97</B></P>
<P>At this meeting the MSRC also approved staff&#146;s proposal for staff support and other costs for FY 1996-97.  Staff proposed that combined staff administrative support, contract administration and program support, technical support, and miscellaneous services and mailing costs could be provided for a total amount not to exceed $575,000 for FY 1996-97.  Specifically, the MSRC approved reimbursement for FY 1995-96 as follows:</P>
<table><tr><td>Staff Administrative Support:</td><td>$160,000</td></tr>
<tr><td> Contract Administration &amp; Program Support:</td><td>230,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>Technical &amp; Program Support:</td><td>155,000</td></tr>
<tr><td> Miscellaneous Service &amp; Mailing Costs:</td><td><U>    30,000</U></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><U>$575,000</U></td></tr></table>
<P>Within the $155,000 for &#147;technical and program support,&#148; is the contract for Raymond Gorski.  It was previously suggested by the Air Resources Board that the contract technical support provided by Mr. Gorski does not qualify as an administrative cost since it relates to program delivery as opposed to program implementation.  Using this scenario, $65,000 of Mr. Gorski&#146;s contract would be included with administrative costs and subject to the 5% administrative cap, and $43,000 as program services.  However, to remain fiscally responsible, the MSRC has included all of Mr. Gorski&#146;s costs relative to calculating administrative costs.  Based on estimated revenue for FY 1996-97, administrative costs should not exceed $591,000, and staff&#146;s proposal for FY 1996-97 remains within the 5% statutory limit for administrative costs.  </P>
<P><B>Consideration of Accumulated Interest on AB 2766 Monies</B>
<BR><B>in Relation to 5% Cap on Administrative Costs of Program</B></P>
<P>At the meeting of the MSRC&#146;s Technical Advisory Committee there was a request for clarification of the mechanism used to calculate the 5% cap for administrative costs.  Specifically, the Committee wondered if interest was included with revenues to determine available dollars for calculating the 5% cap.  If it was not the case, would such an inclusion be in violation of the statute.  Legal Counsel prepared an opinion on the issue which indicated that past practice did not include interest in the calculation.  While there is no language in the statute that specifically excludes interest from the calculation base, a decision to do so would be a deviation from past practice and would require a strong justification.  The opinion generally indicated that a decision by the MSRC could be made either way.  However, the advice of Finance staff was that the annual <U>budget</U> for administrative costs should not exceed 5% of <U>estimated</U> revenues for the year.  In the event expenditures on administrative costs exceed 5% of <U>actual</U> revenues received, the annual interest earned can be added to the annual revenues to determine the base for calculating the 5% cap for administrative costs.</P>
<P><B>Zero-Emission Vehicle &#147;Quick Charge&#148; Program:  </B></P>
<P><B>Amendments to Corridor Community Program Request for Proposals</B></P>
<P>The MSRC approved various amendments to the Corridor Community Program RFP, which was released mid-March and will close July 10, 1996.  An RFP amendment will be sent to all applicable parties, including clarifications and the following amendments:</P>
<P> 1) An additional evaluation criteria worth 10 points:  &#147;Bonus Points for Use of Emission-Free Renewable Energy Source for Recharging.&#148;</P>
<P>2) With regard to when funds expended may be counted as part of a bidder&#146;s co-funding, all proposed co-funding must be directly related to the specific project proposed and must be expended no earlier than June 1, 1996.  This is the first time the MSRC has allowed monies expended prior to contract execution to count as co-funding.  However, this will allow local governments to have infrastructure in place for the EVs to be purchased as part of this program.</P>
<P>3) AB 2766 funds may be used for administrative costs related to the implementation of the EV Corridor Communities Program provided that:  a) the proposal involves multiple (more than three government/ private entities in a teaming arrangement; and b) the administrative costs do not exceed 5% of the total project costs.  This is the first time the MSRC has allowed AB 2766 funds to be used for administrative costs, but the Committee believes that a higher level of administrative costs may be incurred in this program.</P>
<P><B>Receipt and Approval of One Final Report</B></P>
<P>The MSRC received and approved one final report for AeroVironment Contract #C94038, which provided $123,113 for an electric motorcycle technology development and evaluation project.  All final reports for the AB 2766 Discretionary Program can be viewed in the AQMD&#146;s Library. </P>
<P><B>Contract Modification Requests</B></P>
<P>As recommended by its Technical Advisory Committee, the MSRC made the following decisions relative to contract modifications:</P>
<P>1) Approval of a six-month contractual term extension for City of Glendale Contract #C94051, which provides $273,500 for the establishment of a Park-N-Ride facility, and</P>
<P>2) Denial of a scope change for San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments FY 1995-97 TCM Proposal, which was awarded $50,000 for tasks within its CAMP Program.  The requested change would have allocated the funds to a task not within the scope of the original project.</P>
<P>The MSRC also received and filed a report on &quot;Scope Changes Handled Administratively by the AQMD Contract Administrator&quot; for May which included one short-term, no-cost contractual term extension for Mike Kodama Planning Consultant Contract #C95010, which provides $140,330 for a parking cash-out project.</P>
<P><B>Contract Administrator Report</B></P>
<P>The MSRC's AB 2766 Contract Administrator provided a written status report on all fiscal year contracts.  This Contract Administrator Report is provided for your information as <I>Attachment 2</I>.</P>
<P><B>MSRC&#146;s Meeting Schedule</B></P>
<P>The MSRC adopted a revised 1996 meeting schedule, adjusting its meeting and meeting dates during the holidays.  The revised 1996 meeting schedule is provided as <I>Attachment </I><I>3</I>.  </P>

<hr>
<b>Background</b><br>Over the last few years the District has established a 
collaborative public process for the development of new regulations, the AQMP 
and the Budget.  Over a thousand organizations, local governments, businesses 
and individu-als participate on a regular basis in numerous committees, task 
forces and working groups.  However, the District needs to do a better job of 
involving small businesses in the process and ensuring that their specific 
needs and concerns are addressed.  It is vitally important that the District 
be an integral part of all of the communities it serves, including minority 
communities.  The goal is to understand the needs of citizens and 
local business owners who are affected by District regulations while 
meeting state and federal mandates to protect public health.  For 
these reasons, public outreach is an increasingly important responsibility 
and needs to be given greater recognition within the agencys organizational
 structure.
<p>
<b>Proposal</b><br>
As more specifically set forth in Attachment A, this proposal is to:
<p><ul>
A.	Establish the Office of Public Affairs & Local Government 
Assistance (PA&LGA) and the position of Deputy Executive Officer (DEO/PA&LGA) 
to administer its responsibilities;<p>
B.	Create the Local Government and Small Business Assistance 
Committee; and <p>
C.	Institute an Annual General Assembly to review progress
 in reducing emissions and assessing the impacts on local communities 
and the economy.
</ul><p>
The purpose of these actions is also set forth in Attachment A as are the 
responsibili-ties of the DEO/PA&LGA, details regarding the Local Government 
and Small Business Assistance Committee, and the SCAQMD General Assembly.
<p>
<b>Resource Impacts</b><br>
The DEO/PA&LGA position will be advertised with the salary
 range applicable to all Designated Deputy positions ($63,778 up to $119,200) 
and will be a contract man-agement position.  Normal attrition should allow 
this new position to be created and still meet the Boards commitment to 
downsize the agency.  Thus, no additional FTE is requested.

<p>
James M. Lents, Ph.D.<br>
Executive Officer
<p>
<hr>

<b>Background</b><br>
AQMD Rule 430 was originally adopted by the Governing Board on May 7, 1976 to provide relief from violations of Regulation IV - Prohibitions, (except Rule 402 - Nuisance, or Rule 430), and Regulation XI - Source Specific Standards, for a breakdown that meets AQMD criteria.  The period covered under this relief is lim-ited to a maximum of twenty-four hours from the time the owner or operator knew or reasonably should have known of the breakdown, or to the end of the operating cycle, whichever is sooner.  This rule was subsequently amended on October 8, 1976, December 2, 1977 and May 5, 1978 to improve its enforceability.  The sub-sequent amendments require that the owner or operator submit a written follow-up report, and that AQMD staff promptly investigate the site to determine whether an occurrence meets all AQMD criteria to qualify as a breakdown.  The vast ma-jority of breakdowns occur at refineries.
<p>
 However, Rule 430 does not address violations of permit conditions as a result of a breakdown that meets AQMD criteria.  In addition, the current rule language does not identify a method for the owner or operator to report a breakdown in a timely manner.  These concerns need to be corrected prior to the issuance of Ti-tle V permits.
<p>
<b>Proposal</b><br>
Staff  proposes to add rule language to provide relief for violations of certain rules or permit conditions that meets AQMD criteria.  In addition, staff proposes to clar-ify the definition of operating cycle, to add additional flexibility as to the methods that can be used to notify the AQMD of a breakdown in a timely manner, and to clarify that petitions for emergency variances filed during weekends or holidays must be filed according to the directions of the Hearing Board.  Finally, these amendments will make the reporting requirements of Rule 430 consistent with the reporting requirements for RECLAIM facilities specified under Rule 2004 - Re-quirements.  Most of the proposed amendments reflect the current operating pro-cedures at the AQMD.
<p>
<b>AQMP & Legal Mandates</b><br>
The proposed amended rule is administrative in nature and will not impact any AQMP control strategies.  In addition, the proposed amended rule is in accor-dance with existing state and federal regulations.
<p>
<b>CEQA & Socioeconomic Analysis</b><br>
Pursuant to CEQA, staff has prepared a draft Supplemental Environmental As-sessment (SEA) for the proposed amendments to Regulation XX - RECLAIM and Rule 430.  The draft SEA was circulated for a 45-day public review and comment period ending May 10, 1996.  Comments received on the draft SEA will be incor-porated into the final SEA for Regulation XX and Rule 430.  The draft SEA has been incorporated into this rule package.  In addition, a Socioeconomic Impact Assessment has been prepared and is part of the rule development package.
<p>
<b>Implementation Plan</B><br>
Currently, inspectors are promptly assigned to investigate a reported breakdown.  In order to investigate the reported breakdown in a timely manner, certain inspec-tors are assigned on-call duty during the periods outside of the normal AQMD working hours, including but not limited to weekends.  In the event that the owner or operator files for a variance, engineers are assigned to determine the excess emissions resulting from the breakdown.  The above implementation will not be changed by the proposed amendments.  The Hearing Board shall establish pro-cedures to assist those facilities that need to file petitions for emergency vari-ances during weekends or holidays.  As always, staff will be available to assist those facilities affected by the proposed amendments.
<p>
 <b>Resource Impacts</B><br>
The proposed amendments to Rule 430 will provide breakdown relief from permit conditions and eliminate conflicting reporting requirements between Rule 430 and Rule 2004.  No additional AQMD resources are required to implement the pro-posed amendments.  The variance proceedings under the proposed amended rule and the current rule are similar; therefore, it is expected that the public will continue to obtain assistance through AQMDs Clerk of the Board, Hearing Board Liaison, and General Counsels Office.

James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br>Executive Officer<br>
<hr>

<P><B>Background:</B>
<P>On October 15, 1993, the AQMD Governing Board adopted the RECLAIM program.  RECLAIM, crafted as part of the strategy to bring the South Coast Air Basin (SCAB) into compliance with federal and state ambient air quality standards, requires participating facilities to reduce emissions of NOx and SOx by levels equivalent to those required by the command and control rules RECLAIM replaced.</P>
<P>At the time of adoption, some industries had concerns about the amount of reductions proposed in the AQMP.  Thus, Rule 2015 - Backstop Provisions required an evaluation of the ending emission factors for six source categories including gray cement kilns.  The technical evaluation of gray cement kilns has been completed.  Other amendments have been identified which will increase flexibility in monitoring, provide more accurate emission factors, allow greater efficiency in providing reports to the Governing Board, clarify super compliance requirements, better define peaking units, provide relief from violations of certain rules and permit conditions for a breakdown that meets AQMD criteria, and make the reporting information consistent between Rule 430 and Rule 2004.</P>
<P><B>Proposal:</B>
<P>AQMD proposes to update emission factors for facilities subject to RECLAIM.  Based on the technology review presented in the Staff Report and on source testing performed on specific processes, it is proposed that the ending emission factor for gray cement kilns be amended; new categories with associated emission factors be added for delacquering furnaces and pot furnaces; and a new category with associated emission factors be added for new or modified boilers subject to BACT requirements.  AQMD proposes to add rule language to clarify the status of RTC allocations after the year 2010.  Other clean up amendments are proposed for clarification and more accurate reporting of emissions.</P>
<P>In addition, amendments are proposed to increase flexibility in monitoring by the addition of a limited time for CEMS repair due to shutdown and the addition of missing data procedures for process units.  Amendments are also proposed to clarify requirements for super compliance, allow all reports to the Governing Board to be provided at the same time, and make breakdown provisions consistent between Rule 430 and Rule 2004.  An amendment is also proposed to limit the use of peaking units by modifying the definition.</P>
<P><B>AQMP &amp; Legal Mandates</B>
<P>The cumulative emission impacts of the proposed Rule 2002 amendments are significant for NOx emissions because they exceed the CEQA significance threshold of 55 pounds per day.  The proposed amendments will result in an increase of 1.8 tons per day of  NOx emissions for the year 2000.  RECLAIM complies with Health and Safety Code Section 39616, equivalency, because these proposed amendments reflect the most stringent feasible air pollution control technology.  These amendments will therefore result in </P>
<P>equivalent or greater emission reductions when compared to current command and control regulations and future air quality measures that would have been adopted as part of the AQMD&#146;s plan for attainment.</P>
<P><B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis:</B>
<P>Pursuant to CEQA, staff has prepared a draft Supplemental Environmental Assessment (SEA) for the proposed amendments to Regulation XX - RECLAIM.  The draft SEA was circulated for a 45-day public review and comment period which ends May 10, 1996.  Comments received on the draft SEA will be incorporated into the final SEA for Regulation XX.  The draft SEA has been incorporated into this rule package.  In addition, a Socioeconomic Impact Assessment has been prepared and is part of the rule development package.</P>
<P><B>Implementation Plan:</B>
<P>The proposed amendments do not appreciably change the RECLAIM program and are not expected to change the implementation of RECLAIM rules.  Only minor adjustments to the implementation procedures are needed for CEMS for large sources and breakdown emissions.  As always, staff will be available to assist those facilities affected by the proposed amendments.</P>
<P><B>Resource Impacts:</B>
<P>Implementation of these proposals will result in more efficient use of AQMD staff time due to the consolidation of the current three separate status reports on aspects of the RECLAIM program into on combined annual report to the Governing Board.</P>

<P><B>Background</B><br>
On March 8, 1996, the Board approved in concept staff&#146;s 
AQIP funding recommendations for the final quarter of 1995 which 
were to fund the Lapis Energy (Chino and Desert Sand Unified School 
Districts) proposal to convert diesel-powered school buses to CNG-powered
 buses and to exercise the 120-day option with Eco-Scrap to purchase the 
remaining second and third year emission reduction credits.  The Board 
did not authorize executing these two recommendations due to pending 
legislation that would prohibit AQMD from continuing with the AQIP and 
require AQMD to return a portion of the funds collected under the AQIP.  
Staff was directed to return to the Board, prior to the expiration of the 
120-day option, no later than May 18, 1996, for final approval.  
However, because there was no resolution to the pending legislation prior 
to the May Board meeting, Eco-Scrap agreed to extend the 120-day option.</P>

<P><B>Proposal Evaluation</B><br>
Staff recommends that the Board approve the release of funding for the 
Lapis Energy (Chino and Desert Sand Unified School Districts) proposal 
for $49,308 and exercise the 120-day option with Eco-Scrap for $352,495.  
For the final quarter of 1995, the total funding amount that staff recommends 
the Board approve is $401,803.  Any remaining AQIP funds would be held for 
future proposal funding in subsequent quarters.  All employers participating 
in the AQIP between July 1, 1995 and December 7, 1995 would be deemed in 
compliance for an additional two years.</P>

<P>The resulting emission reductions will meet the total required 
equivalent emission reductions for all Rule 1501.1 - Alternatives to 
Work Trip Reduction Plans affected worksites participating in the third and fourth quarters of 1995 for a full three-year period at a similar cost to Rule 2202.  In other words, employers who have paid $110 per employee from July 1, 1995 through December 7, 1995 under Rule 1501.1 would receive credit for three years of compliance instead of one.  This action would help level the playing field because once Rule 2202 was adopted on December 8, 1995 employers paid $125 for each peak window employee for a triennial compliance option.  Any carryover monies from the previous quarters will be combined with the next quarter&#146;s funding for the next round of proposals to be considered.</P>
<P>Execution of these funding recommendations will complete the AQIP funding pursuant to rescinded Rule 1501.1 and will allow the Board to proceed with AQIP funding under Rule 2202.</P>

</blockquote>

<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR> Executive Officer

<hr>
<B>Background</B>
<br>In 1990, the ARB adopted its Low-Emission Vehicle/Clean Fuel (LEV/CF) regulation, which includes a requirement for production of ZEVs for sale in California beginning in 1998.  Although some changes have been made to the original regulation, ARB continues to support the commercialization of ZEVs and maintains the requirement for 10% ZEV production and sale in California for 2003.  The ZEV mandate, adopted specifically to achieve the emissions reduction goals of the South Coast Air Basin, is a crucial element of the AQMD&#146;s AQMP.</P>

<P>Since the adoption of the LEV/CF program, the ARB has identified several barriers to development and production of ZEVs by the major vehicle manufacturers.  First, these manufacturers are accustomed to high-volume production of internal combustion engine vehicles (100,000+ per model vehicle, per year) which would not initially be met by ZEV demand.  Production of ZEVs would require tremendous engineering and tooling investments for a low-volume vehicle.  Another concern is the development of new vehicle designs incorporating electric drivelines utilizing batteries that are currently either inadequate in performance or excessive in cost.  Finally, there is a perceived lack of charging infrastructure and service support for ZEVs, necessary to ensure customer satisfaction and demand.</P>

<B>Proposal</B>
<br>The ARB proposes to partner with Troy Design and Manufacturing (TDM) to design a purpose-built (chassis and components developed particularly for this vehicle) four-passenger electric vehicle (EV) with a range of at least 100 miles.  In addition, ARB will provide a written report which analyzes the production and tooling requirements, and resources available, to produce such a vehicle in California in annual volumes of 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 vehicles.  ARB also will provide information regarding the requirements for supporting these EVs in terms of infrastructure, service, and warranty support from the manufacturer.</P>

<P>Identified as the World Electric Vehicle (WEV), ARB believes that this advanced EV has the potential to capture a sizable market and lead the way for the commercialization and market penetration of EVs.  As a purpose-built EV, the WEV will optimize performance with light-weight materials and advanced aerodynamic styling.  TDM&#146;s expertise in low-cost manufacturing is expected to result in an electric vehicle with the capability of being priced competitively with conventional sports sedans at low-production levels (20,000 or less per year).  The prototype vehicle produced through the proposed project will be available to the AQMD for demonstration purposes.</P>

<P>This project is identified in the Technology Advancement Plan for the Clean Fuels Program as Project MS-03, &#147;Development and Demonstration of an Advanced Purpose-Built EV for Mass Production.&#148;  This project targets the design and production of a prototype electric passenger vehicle, and production analysis of the resources, facilities and costs of producing a purpose-built, four-passenger electric vehicle, intended to help meet the requirements for zero-emission vehicle introduction in 2003.  The AQMP relies on substantial penetration of zero-emission vehicles in the Basin to attain federal clean air standards by 2010.  Although the emission benefits from a single EV would be small, if the project is successful, the reduced costs of these EVs could increase their penetration into the Basin.  Competitively priced EVs with advanced performance characteristics would be more readily accepted by consumers and, therefore, result in increased EV sales.</P>

<P>The potential market for EVs that will contribute to reducing emissions in the Basin and achieving clean air standards is substantial.  The development of the technology and subsequent manufacture of the vehicles represents an economic development and job creation potential for California and the Basin.</P>

<B>Sole Source Justification</B>
<br>Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure identifies four provisions under which the Executive Officer may award a sole-source bid:  (1)cost to prepare documents exceeds cost for consultant, (2)delay would result in the endangerment of public health, (3)services are only available from sole-source, (4)other circumstances exist identifying sole-source as in the best interests of the AQMD.  This request for sole-source award is made under provision (4).</P>

<P>It is in the AQMD&#146;s best interests to enter into a cost-share agreement with ARB for design and production analysis of an electric vehicle.  AQMD funding of $500,000 will be leveraged with the ARB&#146;s $500,000, $600,000 from TDM, and $800,000 provided by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).</P>

<P>As the state agency assigned responsibility for setting vehicle emission standards, the ARB is well acquainted with domestic and foreign automobile manufacturers and designers.  ARB considers the design of a viable passenger electric vehicle as essential to meeting California&#146;s ZEV sales requirements for 2003.</P>

<P>TDM is the only qualified vehicle manufacturer that has demonstrated a positive desire to design and produce advanced electric vehicles that can offer Californians a vehicle with styling, four-passenger comfort, high performance, acceptable driving range, and an acceptable purchase price.  TDM has developed a reputation for producing high quality limited-production volume vehicles.  In fact, TDM has supported most major US automotive manufacturers over the past 15 years by providing low-volume production models.  TDM has the expertise and capabilities of a major manufacturer but, unlike the major manufacturers, TDM specializes in small volume, low-cost design and production.  Currently, TDM is the only Qualified Vehicle Modifier (QVM) for Ford&#146;s entry electric vehicle, the Ford Ranger pickup truck.</P>

<P>As a state agency, the ARB is required to seek out women and minority-owned business for participation in contract activity.  Although TDM is not a woman or minority-owned business, the company has made a commitment to seek qualified businesses in the Basin for participation in this project.  Specifically, TDM will seek to utilize qualified Southern California electric vehicle component manufacturers and materials fabricators for the WEV.</P>

<B>Resource Impacts</B>
<br>Total cost of design of the World Electric Vehicle and analysis of production possibilities in California is $2.4 million, with AQMD funding not to exceed $500,000.  The funding breakdown is as follows:</P>

<hr>
<B>Background</B>
<br>California Health and Safety Code Section 40448(a) establishes the South Coast Air Quality Management District&#146;s Office of Public Advisor authority to provide technical services and information to the general public.  The California Museum of Science and Industry, which annually serves more than 200,000 school children and two million visitors, is implementing a new Master Plan for the Museum and Exposition Park which will result in the establishment of the California Science Center.  Constructed on the site of the present Museum, the California Science Center will be three separate, but wholly integrated facilities dedicated to science education, including:</P>
<ul>
<P><li>a new 600,000 square foot science center, which will include a healthy planet segment called Earth Alert;</P>

<P><li>a science education resource center, to improve the skills of experienced educators as well as college students in training to be math and science teachers; and</P>

<P><li>a pre-kindergarten through 5th grade elementary school, drawing enrollment from the neighborhoods surrounding Exposition Park, with a curriculum emphasis on math and science.</P>
</ul>
<P>The California Science Center, with its combination of formal learning facilities and programs in one location, will be one of the few facilities of its kind in the country.  The Museum is developing the project in partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District, the University of Southern California, and NASA&#146;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology.</P>

<B>Proposal</B>
<br>The California Science Center will feature two exhibition themed areas.  The 20,000 square foot Creative World exhibit will include 75 hands-on exhibits, including major sections on transportation, air quality and environmental issues.  Creative World will deliver its scientific content and health and safety messages through-hands-on experiences and visual images.  The Earth Alert exhibits will provide visitors with hands-on displays and air quality video images such as a smoggy day in Los Angeles in relation to a beautiful clear day, and a haze-filled traffic jam compared to an uncongested freeway alongside public transportation options.  The One Smoggy Day exhibit located in the Air Alert area will inform visitors about the daily air quality conditions and the health impact of smog in the Los Angeles Basin.  After watching a live video feed, noting the current air conditions, visitors will view a 3-D bar graph representing the primary sources of air pollution, including everything from auto traffic and fueling stations to commercial dry cleaning and home barbecues.</P>

<P>The exhibit also will include an element that looks at the environment and the economic issues associated with the consequences of air pollution.  All the exhibits will be designed to convey a message of personal responsibility for the earth on which we live.</P>

<P>The District&#146;s sponsorship will help the California Science Center secure the needed funds to support the project&#146;s educational programming.</P>

<B>Sole Source Justification</B>
<br>Section II, Step 3(C) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure identified four provisions under which the Executive Officer may award a sole-source bid:  (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds cost for consultant; (2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health; (3) services are only available from sole source; and (4) other circumstances exist identifying sole-source as in the best interest of the AQMD.  This request is made under provision (3).  The new California Science Center is scheduled for completeion in the summer of 1997; it is estimated that more than three million people will visit the new facility annually.  Included in this figure will be 200,000 school children who each year will participate in the Center&#146;s science activities and tours. </P>

<B>Resource Impacts</B>
<br>The total cost of  this project is $130 million, with $101 million already committed from public sources.  A separate $29 million fund-raising campaign has been launched to secure funds exclusively for the education programs.  AQMD&#146;s $100,000 sponsorship would support the educational programs component of the Creative World exhibit.</P>

<P>Sufficient funds are available in the FY 1995-96 budget to fund this project.</P>

<P><b>Synopsis</b>:<blockquote> 
The Board authorized the issuance of an RFP to seek a 
contractor for Enhancement of  Facility Permit Processing System.  
The objective of this contract is to enhance and streamline the 
Facility Permit System thereby reducing the amount of time and effort 
required to generate a facility permit.</blockquote>

<P><b>Committee</b>: 
<blockquote>Administrative, May 24, 1996, Recommended for Approval</blockquote>

<P><b>Recommended Action</b>:<blockquote>
Authorize the Chairman of the Board to execute a contract
with Sierra Cybernetics, Inc., in an amount not to exceed $400,000 
to enhance RECLAIM facility permit processing software.</blockquote>
<p>
<P>James M. Lents, Ph. D.
<BR>Executive Officer</P>
<hr>
<B>Background</B><br>The provisions of RECLAIM specify that, for each facility subject to the program, the individual Permits to Operate and Permits to Construct be consolidated into a single facility-based permit.  A facility permit database and user interface were developed to support this effort. This system allows data entry of detailed equipment information, which historically exists in hard copy, into the facility permit database.  Approximately 400 facility permits were generated using this system in the first year of RECLAIM.  This system was not designed to process or update device information for new applications.</P>

<P>To accommodate the expected increase in facility permit workload associated with Title V and other programs, AQMD requires expansion and modification of the existing facility permit system -- including the ability to encompass all permit processing steps.  The Facility Permit Processing System (FPPS) is intended to streamline and improve facility permit data entry and add necessary permit processing functionality.</P>

<P>At its August 11, 1995 meeting, the Board authorized the issuance of RFP 9596-15 for Enhancement of  Facility Permit Processing System in two phases:  design and construction.</P>

<P>In accordance with the District's Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure, a public notice inviting bids was published in the Los Angeles Times, Orange County Register, Riverside Press Enterprise, L.A. Sentinel, Eastern Group Publ., San Bernardino Sun, La Opinion, Rafu Shimpo, Precinct Reporter, The Black Voice News, Chinese Daily News, Korea Central Daily, El Chicano, The Excelsior, Philippine News, The M/W/DVBE Source, Contracts Register, AQMD BBS, and RFP/Bid Information Line.  RFPs were distributed to 174 prospective bidders.</P>

<P>When the bidding closed on February 15, 1996 fourteen firms had responded to the RFP, three of which submitted a &#147;No Bid&#148; letter.  The evaluation results for these vendors are shown in Attachment A.  Only four firms were considered to be technically responsive to the RFP based on their responses.  The final evaluation results for these four are summarized as follows:</P>

<P>The evaluation panel reviewed the proposals and determined that the firm submitting the proposal most responsive to the requirements of the RFP was Sierra Cybernetics, Inc.  This firm received the highest overall score by demonstrating:  a clearer understanding of the problem, a superior solution to the District&#146;s objectives, a sound technical approach, and a competitive price of $236,281 for Phase I design work.  The remaining $163,719 will be used to authorize Sierra Cybernetics, Inc. to proceed with Phase II programming on prioritized tasks under this contract.</P>

<P>The selection criteria used to determine vendor ratings included:  technical responsiveness, technical expertise, project management staffing, previous experience, cost considerations, and MBE/WBE/DVBE - local business designation.  For evaluating this proposal, the cost evaluation as specified in the RFP was based on a firm fixed price bid for Phase I (60%) and weighted-averaged Phase II labor rates (40%), calculated by objectively averaging specified labor categories.  The six-person evaluation panel consisted of five AQMD staff members and one person from Ryan Tyler Group; one female; and two Hispanics, two Asians, and two Caucasians.</P>

<P>In addition, technically capable bidders with certified minority, women-owned, or disabled veteran business status were accorded an additional 10 points; bidders who propose to subcontract no less than 20% of the work to certified minority, women-owned, or disabled veteran businesses were accorded an additional 7 points and bidders with locally-owned businesses were accorded an additional 5 points.  The cumulative total of these additional credits could not exceed 10 points.</P>

<b>BOARD MEETING DATE: June 14, 1996
<p>AGENDA NO.  9</b>
<p>
<b>Proposal</b>:	
<blockquote>Establish List of Pre-Qualified Vendors for Providing Mailing 
Services</blockquote>

<b>Synopsis</b>:	
<blockquote>On  February 9, 1996, the Board approved the release of RFQs to 
solicit bids from various vendors in order to establish a list of 
pre-qualified vendors from whom the AQMD may purchase various nonconsultant 
services and supplies.  Staff is recommending three vendors to be placed on a 
pre-qualified vendor list for providing mailing services.</blockquote>

<b>Committee</b>:	
<blockquote>Administrative, May 24, 1996, Recommended for Approval</blockquote>

<b>Recommended Action</b>:
<blockquote>Approve the following as pre-qualified mailing services vendors 
through June 30, 1998.<br>
<ol>
<li>Direct Connection Mailing
<li>A & M Services
<li>Mini Mailers
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>James M. Lents, Ph.D.<br>
Executive Officer
<hr>		
<p>
<b>Background</b><br>
In accordance with the Districts Contracting and Purchasing policy, a 
Public Notice Inviting Bids was published in the Los Angeles Times, 
La Opinion, Orange County Register, Riverside Press Enterprise, San Bernardino 
Sun, Korea Central Daily, Rafu Shimpo, and Philippine News on February 14 and 
21, 1996; Los Angeles Sentinel, Eastern Group Publication, Precinct Reporter, 
El Chicano, The Black Voice News, and La Voz on February 15 and 22, 1996; 
The Excelsior on February 16 and 23, 1996; Chinese News on February 14, 15, 
and 16, 1996 and the M/W/DVBE Source on February 15, 1996.  In addition, a PSA 
(Public Service Announcement) was sent to 77 various radio, TV and cable 
stations as well as being placed on the AQMDs Bulletin Services (BBS) and 
RFP/Bid Information Line.  A total of 267 RFQs were distributed to independent 
mail service vendors, identified by the AQMD as potential bidders 
(including 17 minority or women-owned firms and 39 to various minority 
caucuses) and other vendors responding to the advertisements.<br>
<p>
<b>Proposal</b><br>
Bid responses were received from 6 vendors that attended the mandatory bidders conference and were evaluated by a five member panel.  Out of the six vendors, one is a certified MBE (Hispanic) and another provided a list of MBE/WBE vendors that are used as subcontractors.  The panel consisted of four District employees and a representative from the U. S. Post Office.  Three panel members are female and two are male.  Of the five members, three are Hispanic.  The results of that evaluation are listed on the Attachment.  Staff is recommending that the following vendors be approved as pre-certified mailing service vendors through June 30, 1998.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Direct Connections Mailing	Uses MBE/WBE Subcontractors
<li>A & M Services
<li>Mini Mailers	Certified MBE
</ol>
<p>
<b>Resource Impacts</b><br>
The anticipated costs associated with mailing services are budgeted by the various organizational units that use the service.

	<UL>This report provides for the Board&#146;s consideration a listing of CEQA documents received by the 	AQMD between May 2, 1996 and June 3, 1996, and those projects for which the AQMD is acting as lead 	agency pursuant to CEQA</UL>.

<hr></p>

<P><B> Background</B></P>
<P><U>EIR and Document Log (Attachments A and B)</U> - Each month, the AQMD receives numerous CEQA documents from other public agencies on projects which could adversely affect air quality.  A listing of all documents received for review during the past month are contained in Attachment A.  Monthly listings which are shaded note those CEQA documents for which the AQMD staff has or will prepare and submit comments to the lead agency.  A list of active projects from previous months for which AQMD staff is continuing to evaluate or prepare comments is included as Attachment B.  The column captioned &#147;Public Concerns&#148; identifies parties who have contacted the AQMD with concerns or issues about the proposed project.  A notation of 1 in this column indicates the contact was supportive of the project noted.  A notation of 2 indicates the party was opposed or expressed concerns about the project.  A notation of 3 indicates that no one contacted the AQMD about that project.</P>
<P>In the past, AQMD staff routinely reviewed many of these documents and commented upon the air quality analyses and possible impacts on the air quality of the district.  Due to staffing constraints, the AQMD is no longer able to routinely comment on all CEQA documents received.  Publication of the Board-approved <I>CEQA Air</I> <I>Quality Handbook</I>, however, has provided local governments and other public agencies with the necessary information to prepare appropriate air quality analyses on projects for which they act as lead agency.  As resources permit, staff evaluates and may prepare comments for projects that may have significant adverse regional air quality impacts (e.g., special event centers, landfills, etc.) and those projects for which a lead or responsible agency has specifically requested AQMD review.</P>
<P><U>AQMD Lead Agency Projects (Attachment C)</U> - Pursuant to CEQA, the AQMD periodically acts as lead agency on stationary source permit projects.  Under CEQA the lead agency is responsible for determining whether an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) or a Negative Declaration is necessary for any proposal considered to be a &quot;project&quot; as defined by CEQA.  An EIR is prepared when the AQMD as lead agency finds substantial evidence that the proposed project may have a significant adverse effect on the environment.  A Negative Declaration may be prepared if the AQMD determines that the proposed project will not generate significant adverse environmental impacts.  The Negative Declaration is a written statement describing the reasons a proposed project will not have a significant adverse effect on the environment and, therefore, does not require the preparation of an EIR.</P>
<P>Attachment C to this report summarizes the active projects for which the AQMD is lead agency and is currently preparing or has prepared environmental documentation.  As noted in Attachment C, during June 1996, the AQMD continued working on CEQA documents for three (3) active projects.</P>
<P>To date in 1996, the AQMD, as lead agency, prepared or contracted for the preparation of and certified one (1) CEQA documents.</P>

<P><B> </B><B>1118 *</B><B> </B><B>Emission Reductions from Refinery Flares</B></P>
<P>  Proposed rule will take a two-step approach to gather data on flaring operations at petroleum refineries to assess the need for, or the level of, any future controls required in order to reduce flare emissions.  The first step will require refineries to monitor flaring activities for the amount and composition of gases being flared.  If the data demonstrates a need to control flaring operations, step two of the rule will be to develop specific control requirements to reduce flare emissions.</P>

<P><B> </B><B>1125</B><B> </B><B>Can, Drum, &amp; Coil Coating</B></P>
<P><B> </B><B> </B>Proposed amendments will be based on a recent review of available technology.  Coil coating facilities would be able to reduce emissions through reformulation and enclosure of roller coater units to capture fugitive emissions.  Reductions may also be realized from drum manufacturers through coating reformulations, increased transfer efficiency of spray guns, and installation of control equipment.</P>

These facilities can achieve additional reductions through the use of reformulated materials, increased effectiveness of add-on control equipment, UV-curable coatings and adhesives with negligible VOC emissions.  Additional reductions will come from the use of hotmelt adhesives and resin impregnating applications.</P>

Emissions associated with inks and fountain solutions can be reduced with current available technology.  The advent of ultraviolet and electron beam technology will allow a switch from conventional inks to inks with little or no VOC emissions.  Solvent cleanup emissions will also be reduced through the use of automatic blanket washers and vegetable-based solvents.</P>

<P><B>Public Comment:</B> 
 	<ul>In regard to the possible further continuance on the July Board item to set a Public Hearing on August 9, 1996 to Amend Rule 201-Permit to Construct, Jeb Stuart stated if companies are prohibited from making any preparation before obtaining a Permit to Construct they will move out of the Basin.  Companies most affected are the ones that are thinking about moving here.  If they have to wait six months for their permit, they will go somewhere else.  If the District shows opposition, the EPA will back off.  Gene Beck advised the Committee that it&#146;s not just large businesses that are affected; if, for example, EPA will not allow a strip mall to break ground until the tenants (i.e., a dry cleaner) have appropriate permits, then small businesses are affected as well.</P></ul>

<P><B>MOBILE SOURCE COMMITTEE DISCUSSION ITEMS</B></P>
	<UL><P><B>1.Legislative Update</B></P>
		<ul><P><B> </B>Staff discussed that AB 3248 (Napolitano) will be given an interim hearing to further discuss the issues.  This bill would create a new office of public affairs and local government assistance and would require AQMD's share of the AB 2766 motor vehicle registration fee revenues be redirected.  Staff indicated that Board Chairman Jon Mikels testified during the hearing.</P>
<P> Staff advised that the Assembly took up the April 22 version of SB 836 (Lewis) on the Floor, approved it, and sent it to the Senate on a 41 - 25 vote.  This bill will then likely be referred to a Conference Committee.</P>
<P> A meeting was held between members of Senator Lewis' staff, Jim Lantry (consultant), and AQMD staff to determine what substitute measures could be implemented for future ISRs and Rule 2202.  During the meeting, staff reported that Jim Lantry's group supports two ideas in particular:  more extensive use of remote sensing and a voluntary rideshare program with some type of ongoing monitoring mechanism.</P></ul>
	<P><B>2.Program Comparison:  AQIP and AB 2766</B></P>
		<ul><P> Staff discussed the similarities and differences in both the AQIP and AB 2766 programs (Attachment 		II).  The idea for both is to reduce mobile source emissions.  Bidders conferences are held before the 				proposals are received.  Cost effectiveness is a consideration and the Board approves the list of projects in 		both of these programs.  Those entities that are awarded the contracts submit quarterly status reports to the 		AQMD.</P>
		<P> With AB 2766, the RFPs are divided into project categories.  The proposals are submitted every two 			years.  Targeted funding amounts for the categories are included.  With AQIP under Rule 2202, the projects 		are assigned categories after the proposals are received.  The proposals are submitted on an ongoing basis.  		There is no target funding amount for the categories and the contracts are awarded quarterly.</P>
		<P> The sources of funding are also different.  With AB 2766, the dollars come from the motor vehicle 				registration fees.  With the AQIP, the source of funding is the employers that chose to participate in the AQIP 		compliance option.</P>
		<P> The way the proposals are reviewed is also different.  With AB 2766, the review is conducted by the 			MSRC with a variety of individuals from across the region.  When the proposals come in, the MSRC Technical 		Advisory Committee reviews the proposals and makes recommendations to the MSRC and finally the Board 		will either approve or disapprove the entire work program.  With the AQIP, the proposals are reviewed by 			AQMD staff with Transportation Programs staff taking the lead with input from the Technology Advancement 		Office, Planning, and Public Advisor as requested from time to time depending on the type of proposals 				received, as well as the expertise needed to complete the process.  On a quarterly basis, AQMD staff takes 		the recommendations to the Mobile Source Committee and finally to the Board for approval.</P>
		<P> There are differences in the evaluation criteria between the two programs, as well.  With AB 2766, the 		evaluation criteria specifically require multi-agency or multi-jurisdictional types of submittals.  Verified co-				funding is key in the evaluation of a proposal.  For either one of these programs, anybody can submit 				proposals.  But with the AQIP, specific emission reduction targets are required rather than the general mobile 		source reduction required by AB 2766.  The AQIP requires these specific targets because these subsume the 		targets the employers would have reached had they chosen another pollution reduction program.  As 				feasible, the projects are awarded in the same counties from which the funds are submitted.</P>
		<P> As far as the contract administration and time frame are concerned, with AB 2766, an outside consulting 		firm is hired to administer the process for the proposal submittals, evaluation, and contract administration.  		The proposals are submitted every two years with the work being completed in a 12 - 18 month timeframe.  		With the AQIP, AQMD staff administers the contracting procedures.  AQIP contracts are for one year, a 				shorter timeframe consistent with Rule 2202.  </P></ul>
	<P><B>3.AQIP Proposal Ranking Methodology</B></P>
		<ul><P> Staff gave a brief report on the AQIP ranking methodology.  As included in the Rule 2202 language, 		there are four key requirements:  Equivalent Emission Reductions or Air Quality; Cost-Effectiveness, Long-			Term Advancement Mobile Source Technology; Proportional County Allocations to Degree Feasible.  				Emission reductions must be real, quantifiable, enforceable and surplus.</P>
		<P> In reviewing the RFPs, there are three criteria being considered:  technical, cost-effectiveness, and other 		factors.  Under the technical criteria, a proposal must demonstrate that it contains a mobile source emission 		reduction strategy:  a technology-based strategy, a fuel-based strategy, or a trip reduction strategy.  Staff 			looks at each proposal compared to the AQMP objectives, goals, and schedule for implementation of control 		measures.  Staff looks at the potential emissions equivalency of the proposal and also the technical expertise 		of the firm that will carry out the proposal.</P>
		<P> Under the cost effectiveness criteria of the proposal evaluation, staff looks at dollars per pound and 			whether there are multiple pollutant benefits, which are incorporated into the overall cost effectiveness 				evaluation.  Staff also takes into consideration projects that yield a number of years worth of credits to the 			investment.  A good example of this is the conversion of a diesel school bus to clean fuel, which yields multi-		year benefits.  </P>
		<P> Committee Chairperson Candace Haggard recognized a member of the public.  Larry Mahar of Ecotek 		expressed his opinion on staff's AQIP recommendations for the first quarter of 1996 (Attachment III).  He 			argued that the scrapping of a vehicle does not necessarily equate to the reduction of any emissions.  The 			scrapped vehicle may not have been routinely in use prior to being scrapped.  Even if it had, there is no 				assurance that the replacement vehicle was any better or more well tuned than the scrapped vehicle.  At 			best, the emission reduction would be the difference between the emissions of the old vehicle and the 				replacement which is unknown.  Staff indicated that it would meet with anyone with inquiries regarding the 			proposal ranking methodology or the evaluation of a specific project.</P></ul>
	<P><B>4.Update on Intercredit Trading</B></P>
		<UL><P> Staff explained that the presentation would focus on a summary of initial discussions for an 				expanded AQIP (Attachment IV).  Sources subject to regulation may choose to become an AQIP clean air 			investor  by paying fees to the Fund.  In turn, the Fund invests the money in various emission reduction 				strategies.  Staff emphasized that this program is designed to achieve emissions reduction equivalency.</P>
		<P> Staff stated the different objectives of the expanded AQIP:  to provide the regulated community with an 		additional compliance option; to promote private market strategies; to achieve equivalent emission reductions; 		and to promote clean technologies.</P>
		<P> Under the expanded AQIP, in addition to Rule 2202, investors from selected Regulation IV and XI 				sources will be considered.  Also a proposal to allow private parties or citizens to donate to this Fund for 				purposes of improving air quality is being evaluated.  Staff indicated that there is a desire that donations be tax 		deductible.  Legal staff is evaluating the proposal.</P>
		<P> The AQIP emission reductions would be used for future compliance requirements.  In terms of the 				existing compliance requirements, environmental groups have a desire to restrict the use of these emission 		reductions on existing compliance requirements to outliers only.</P>
		<P> The possible AQIP approach under the extended program is to receive and pre-qualify the proposals by 		estimating the cost and emission reductions, and then establish the set price to charge the participants and 		ultimately fund the project.  Such an approach would help ensure the right price is established as well as 			assure necessary emission reductions.  The concept basically is to link the proposals and the fees.</P>
		<P> In pre-qualifying the projects, two categories could be established.  The first category would be projects 		with established emissions protocols.  The emissions could be quantified in a relatively nearterm.  The 				second category proposals are projects with emission reductions or air quality benefits but no standard 				quantification method.  The second group of proposals would be in addition to the equivalent emission 				reductions proposals, once the emission targets are met.</P>
		<P> Once the proposals are qualified, the actual fee for selected Regulation IV and XI sources is based on 		Category I Proposals<B>.</B>  These are the near-term projects with protocols.  An average cost is 					calculated by pollutant based on the cost-effectiveness in terms of dollar per ton.  This becomes the basic 			fee.  In addition, there could be a premium for administrative cost and to encourage use of the market place.  		Such a price structure would be higher than the private market.  Staff believes that the business and the 				environmental groups generally agree with this concept as well.  Staff indicated that the investment fee for 			Rule 2202 sources remains the same.</P>
		<P> The other elements of this program could include:  Consultation Committee, Status Reports and 				Program Audits, and Corrective Measures.</P>
		<P> In answer to the question raised by Chairperson Haggard, this presentation is for information and a 				recommendation from the Committee is not requested at this time.</P></UL>
	<P><B>5.REACH Task Force</B></P>
		<UL><P> Staff stated that copies of April and May REACH Task Force minutes are attached in today's 				agenda (Attachment V).  A written summary of the June 26, 1996 REACH meeting will be attached to next 		month's Mobile Source Committee agenda.  SCAG is responsible for providing to the AQMD the 						transportation control strategy to be included in the draft 1997 AQMP.  SCAG's Regional Council requested 		its staff to include the REACH Task Force's recommendations on a pricing/market incentive measure.  				Consistent with the schedule contained in the memorandum of understanding with the AQMD, SCAG must 		provide the AQMD with a draft transportation control strategy by the end of June.  Thereafter, SCAG, AQMD, 		and other REACH Task Force members will work together to refine the strategy and incorporate appropriate 		results as the modeling effort reaches its conclusion.  A concern was raised by the REACH members 				regarding release of a draft write-up before the final draft was completed.<B>  </B>The Mobile Source 				Committee is not being asked to take a position at this time.</P></UL>
	<P><B>6.Progress Report on 1997 AQMP/PM10 Task Force</b></p>
		<UL><P> Staff began the report by outlining the new elements included in the 1997 AQMP Revision. 				(Attachment VI).  The new base year for this plan is 1993.  From a number of data sources, updated emission 		factors were established.  Notably, staff has currently used EMFAC7G for the mobile sources and has 				updated emission factors for some of the fugitive dust categories including construction and entrained road 		dust.  Staff has updated growth projections and new information on ammonia which plays an important role 		regarding the formation of particulates.  Also, new PM10 design values and updated models are included as 		new elements and are considered appropriate in the preparation of the plan.</P>
		<P> Comparing the figures presented in a pie chart between the 1994 AQMP (1990 base year) and the 1997 		AQMP (1993 base year), on-road mobile sources for NOx continue to dominate.  Similarly, on the VOC side, 		on-road mobile sources dominated in 1990 and to a slightly greater extent in the 1993 baseline.  On the 				fugitive dust side, the biggest chunk of the pie is the entrained road dust on paved and unpaved roads.  				Entrained road dust is the dust from the ground carried by mobile vehicles to the air and suspended in the 			atmosphere.  Compared to the 1990 baseline, the entrained road dust in the 1993 baseline has dropped 			considerably, mainly because of the adoption of Rule 403 in 1992.  On the ammonia inventory, the basis for 		the previous AQMP was the study provided by Radian (1986), but subsequently with the series of studies on 		dairy farms, staff has acquired new information on ammonia and has designed new values.</P>
		<P> Staff stated that new PM10 models are being tested.  The UAM-AERO is used for episodic 24 hour 				standard.  The UAM-Linear Chemistry models every single day per year in order to determine an annual 			average.  The models are currently undergoing performance evaluation.</P>
		<P> Some of the potential changes that staff is looking at include the elimination of future ISRs, the reduction 		of the &quot;black box&quot; control measures, and an improved representation of emissions from military air 		bases.</P>
		<P> The other relevant evaluation to be conducted for the 1997 AQMP is to examine within the constraints of 		the current AQMP the possible implications of a new federal 8-hr ozone standard, and new federal PM2.5 			standards for both the annual and 24-hour.  Also, for purposes of conformity, an evaluation to be conducted 		for the 1997 AQMP is to examine the Ozone Maintenance Plan to 2020 in order to establish the necessary 		emissions budget.</P>
		<P> Previously, the reviews of ozone and particulate matter standards were on separate time tracks.  				Presently, EPA has put them on the same timeframe.  Proposals are due in November, 1996 and the final 		decision must be promulgated by the EPA in June, 1997.</P>
		<P> The current ozone standard is based on a 1-hour average.  EPA is preliminarily recommending to 				change to an 8-hour standard based on the medical and health effects.  The other recommendation is to 			replace expected-exceedance form with concentration-based form.  Currently, on a per site basis, one 				exceedance is allowed per year averaged over 3 years.  The fourth exceedance is considered a violation.</P>
		<P> Staff indicated that EPA is also recommending to consider the fine and coarse fractions of particulate 			matter as separate pollutants.  PM10 will be the indicator for coarse pollutants and PM2.5 will be the indicator 		for fine pollutants.  On the annual average, the recommendation at this point is to keep the PM10 to 40-50 			ug/m3.  The recommended range for PM2.5 is 12.5-20 ug/m3.  On the 24-hour average, EPA is 						recommending to either retain or delete 150 ug/m3 on PM10 and on the PM2.5, the range that is being 				recommended is 18-65 ug/m3.  As far as the determination of expected-exceedance form of standard, EPA is 		not recommending a change.</P>
		<P> In looking at a potential annual average PM2.5, in 1995, every area in the basin would have been non-		attainment.  The ammonia nitrate portion of the graph occupies the largest portion of the PM2.5 graph.  The 		control of NOx, VOC, and ammonia primarily will be the most important aspect in the strategies for controlling 		PM2.5.  Ammonia is a key player even on the PM10 side.  The majority of the dairy industry and the Milk 			Producing Council are willing to relocate out of the basin.  An obstacle facing them in their desire to relocate 		is the 12 1/2% penalty placed upon dairy farmers for selling their property under current state law.  The 				farmers would like to see the 12 1/2% penalty reinvested in local infrastructure.</P>
		<P> Staff concluded the presentation by mentioning the upcoming task force meeting and the 1997 AQMP 		Development Schedule as indicated in the handouts.</P></UL>

<STRONG><P>   Mee Hae Lee</P>
<P>   Chair, Stationary Source Committee</P></STRONG>
<P>PL:CC:sh</P>
<P><B>Attendance</B></P>
	<UL><P>Present were Committee Chair Mee Hae Lee and Committee Members Candace Haggard, James Silva, Nell Soto, and 	Ron Loveridge (who arrived at 10:40 a.m.).</P></UL>

<P><B>Summary</B></P>
	<UL><P>The Committee discussed their role in reviewing items already set for public hearing on the Governing Board agenda.  It 	was suggested that items on their agenda be reviewed prior to going to the Administrative Committee.  This would promote timely 	communication of their recommendations to the full Governing Board.  The Committee decided to discuss this recommendation 	with Chairman Mikels.</P></UL>

<STRONG><P>The Committee reviewed the items on their agenda (attached).  Comments were noted on the following items:</P>
	<UL><P>1. <B>Rule 430 - Breakdown Provisions</B></P></STRONG>
		<UL><P> Pang Mueller discussed the proposed amendments to the rule.  She summarized the proposal to expand relief to 			violations of certain rules and permit conditions in the event of a breakdown that meets AQMD criteria, and clarified that the rule 		is not applicable to RECLAIM pollutants at RECLAIM facilities.  The basis for requiring prompt reporting of breakdowns was also 		highlighted.  <I>(This item is scheduled for </I><I>Board hearing on July 12, 1996.)</I></P></UL>

	<P>2. <B>Rules 2002, 2004, 2005, 2011, 2012 and 2015</B></P>
<UL><P> These Regulation XX items were presented by Pang Mueller.  Pang explained that this group of rules will increase implementation flexibility and cost effectiveness for RECLAIM facilities.  <I>(This item is scheduled for Board hearing on July 12, 1996.)</I></P></UL>
<P>3. <B>Recission of Rule 1421 - Control of Perchloroethylene Emissions from Dry Cleaning </B><B>Operations</B></P>
	<UL><P> Ben Shaw explained the options to (1) repeal Rule 1421 and instead enforce the state Air Toxics Control Measure 	(ATCM), which has been determined to be equivalent to the federal NESHAP, versus (2) retaining Rule 1421 and seeking a state 	and federal equivalency determination.  The former proposal, recommended by staff, streamlines compliance requirements.  Ben 	reported that five dry cleaning associations were polled.  Three responded and are in favor of this approach which should result in a 	decreased burden on business.  The Committee asked staff to check again with the two dry cleaning associations who did not 	respond to the poll.  This item will be discussed at the next Home Rule Working Group meeting on June 27.</P></UL>

<P>4. <B>Rule 1171 - Solvent Cleanup</B></P>
	<UL><P> Pom Pom Ganguli presented this item.  He said that this rule was being proposed as part of the alternative VOC control rules to replace VOC RECLAIM.  It will reduce VOC emissions by 15.9 tons/day--the largest reduction of any recent VOC rule.  The Committee recommended that staff try to simplify the Clean Air Solvent Exemption Criteria and make it easier to comply with.  In response to a question from the public, Pom Pom explained that Rule 1171 applies to both permitted and unpermitted facilities, and outreach efforts have been undertaken to inform users who do not have AQMD permits.  The Committee recommended a full Board discussion on the issue of rule applicability to unpermitted sources and recommended staff bring forward examples of specific outreach efforts from the Public Advisor&#146;s office.</P></UL>

<P>5. <B>Proposal to Streamline Permit Application Processing</B></P>
	<UL><P> Ed Pupka explained recent enhancements to the 7/30/180-day permit application processing program.  The new procedures will further streamline the internal permit application process.  The Committee expressed appreciation for the continuing effort to improve service and discussed the need to ensure these messages reach the public through our outreach efforts.  The Committee also urged staff to encourage persons with positive stories to attend the Board meetings.</P></UL></UL>

<P><B>1.Cost-Share the Retrofit of a Metropolitan Transportation Authority Methanol Bus to Operate on Compressed Natural Gas</B></P>
<UL>
<P> Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) staff is considering converting its methanol bus fleet to operate on diesel fuel.  To evaluate all options for the methanol buses, MTA plans to evaluate the possibility of retrofitting the buses to operate on compressed natural gas (CNG).  MTA has requested financial assistance to support the conversion of one methanol bus to CNG to determine the feasibility of this approach.  AQMD&#146;s cost-share will not exceed $75,000.  Total project cost is approximately $192,800.  <I>The Committee reviewed the information presented and noted their </I><I>approval of staff&#146;s recommendation.</I></P>

<STRONG><P>REPORT: </STRONG>
<UL>
 Interagency AQMP Implementation Committee
</UL>

<STRONG><P>SYNOPSIS:</STRONG> 
 <UL>
The IAIC met May 23, 1996, to discuss:  the activities of its Technical Advisory Committee; the activities of the REACH Task Force; transportation conformity issues; proposed amendments to Rule 2015 (Backstop Provisions); Proposed Rule 2009 (Area Source Credits); local government outreach activities, including a legislative alert on SB 836; alternative fuels/Zero-Emission Vehicle Mandate; the RFP for Audit of AB 2766 Fee Revenue Recipients for FYs 1993-94 &amp; 1994-95, an update on the AB 2766 Discretionary Fund process; and Public Advisor Office activities.  An attendance record of the May 1996 meeting is attached, and a summary of that meeting, including suggestions and comments for your consideration, is below.  The next IAIC meeting is August 22, 1996, at 1 p.m. in Conference Room CC8.</P>

<BR>
<P>JDM:LRB:DAR</P>
<P><B>Approval of March 28, 1996, Minutes</B></P>
<UL>
<P>Chairman Jon Mikels called for a motion on the March 28, 1996, IAIC meeting 
<BR>minutes.</P>
<P><I>On motion by Council Member Thomas Wilson, and seconded by Al Lopez, the March </I><I>28, 1996, meeting minutes were approved, as submitted.</I></P>
</UL>

<P><B>Report by TAC Chairman on Technical Advisory Committee Meeting</B></P>
<UL>
<P>In the absence of TAC Chair Jim Stahl, Greg Adams of the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, reported that the TAC discussed two items which were not included on the IAIC agenda--Rule 430 (Breakdown Provisions) and an NSR update relative to proposed amendments to Rules 1304 (Exemptions) and 1306 (Emission Calculations).</P>
</UL>

<P><B>Proposed Amendments to Rule 430 (Breakdown Provisions)</B></P>

<P><B>ACTION:</B>  
<UL>
The IAIC asked that on its next agenda staff include a discussion of proposed Rule 430 amendments, which is scheduled for public hearing July 12.</P>
</UL>

<P><B>Proposed Amendments to </B>
<BR>
<B>Rules 1304 (Exemptions) and 1306 (Emission Calculations) Relative to NSR</B></P>
<UL>
<P>Next, Mr. Adams explained that the Governing Board on June 14 will be considering NSR revisions relative to proposed amendments to Rules 1304 and 1306.  The TAC raised several issues regarding 1304 amendments, relating to portable equipment.  Although the changes to the rule language satisfy the majority of industry concerns, there remains a concern relative to internal combustion engines and portable equipment.  Where an internal combustion engine drives the portable equipment, the ICE and the driven equipment will be handled differently in the permitting process.  The TAC discussed proposals with staff to prevent this, such that Rules 1304(a)(7) and (a)(8) should be consolidated and that storage requirements be made compatible.  In addition, relative to potential-to-emit calculations, the TAC believes that fugitive emissions should only be included in potential-to-emit calculations if the facility is one of the 26 major sources designated in the Federal Clean Air Act, Title 1.</P>
</UL>

<P><B>Update on REACH Task Force </B></P>
<UL>
<P>As co-chair of the REACH Task Force, along with Council Member Judy Wright of SCAG, Chairman Mikels stated that he was unable to attend the bulk of the last meeting, but a copy of the April 23 meeting minutes was included within the agenda package.</P>
</UL>

<P><B>Discuss Transportation Conformity Issues</B></P>
<UL>
<P>Connie Day, AQMD Transportation Program Supervisor, reminded the Committee that she was asked to return to discuss transportation conformity relative to pending legislation (e.g., SB 836 and SB 1603).  Since nothing further has occurred relative to the legislation since the last IAIC meeting, Ms. Day merely emphasized that all emissions reductions must be made up if legislation eliminates any AQMD rule or program.  Without such, transportation conformity cannot be achieved.</P>
</UL>

<P><B>Review of Proposed Amendments to Rule 2015 (Backstop Provisions)</B></P>
<UL>
<P>Hamed Mandilawi, AQMD Sr. Air Quality Engineer, reported that during the RECLAIM program development process, a few industries voiced concern to their year 2000 emission reduction requirements.  To address their concerns, the AQMD added language to Rule 2015 which required a technology review of NO<SUB>x</SUB> reduction methods used to determine the year 2000 emission factors for several industries.  The technology review has been completed and recommendations have been approved by the Board for all the source categories except for gray cement kilns.  Staff found that the conversion of the kiln to an indirect firing system coupled with low-NO<SUB>x</SUB> burner and secondary combustion of fuel, such as tires, could reduce NO<SUB>x</SUB> emissions to 2.73 lb./ton of clinker.  The AQMD and industry agree to the recommended methods but disagree on the rate of reduction from each method.  Therefore, staff is recommending to change the year 2000 NO<SUB>x</SUB> emission factor from 0.98 to 2.73 lb/ton of clinker.  In addition, staff is recommending to add new language to Rule 2015 which will allow the cement industry in the Basin to demonstrate the control technologies.  If the demonstration shows a higher emission factor than the staff recommended emission factor, the AQMD will change the year 2000 emission factor listed in Table 1 of Rule 2002.  The proposed amendments to Rule 2015 are scheduled for public hearing July 12, 1996.</P></UL>
<P><B>Discuss Proposed Rule 2009 (Area Source Credits)</B></P>
		<UL><P>Pang Mueller, AQMD Sr. Manager/RECLAIM &amp; Title V Administration, explained that when the RECLAIM Program was being developed, it was decided that other sources of credits should be established for use by RECLAIM facilities.  Consequently, the Board has begun adopting credit rules for mobile sources (e.g. lawnmower rule) and vehicle scrapping.  Proposed Rule 2009, currently scheduled for public hearing in November 1995, would allow for area source credits from stationary, nonpermitted sources.  It is designed as a voluntary program developed with input from the Area Source Credit Steering Committee, and Rule 2009 is itself the credit generation rule.  The area source universe includes consumer products, nonpermitted equipment, and energy conservation.  The goal is to encourage innovative programs.  </P></UL>
<P><B>Report on Local Government Outreach Activities and Legislative Alert</B></P>
<UL>
<P>Relative to the legislative alert on SB 836, TAC representative Greg Adams emphasized that not only would the MSRC&#146;s program be eliminated, which generates jobs and improves the region&#146;s economy, but the fees are also critical for funding essential AQMD programs, such as monitoring, based on the prorated contribution from mobile sources.  This could either result in an additional burden to stationary sources or a reduction in such services.  Wes McDaniel, Executive Director of SANBAG, stated that since this $4 vehicle registration fee was enacted county by county, the question of whether the Legislature can usurp a locally approved revenue source should be addressed.
</UL>
  <B>ACTION:</B>  
<UL>
AQMD legal counsel agreed to check into this argument.</P>
<P>After the IAIC&#146;s TAC discussed the potential impacts of the bill at its meeting, it prepared a draft letter to be sent to Senator Lewis from the IAIC.  Greg Adams presented that letter to the IAIC for consideration.  After requesting several revisions, those IAIC members present signed the letter.  Lillian Kawasaki from the City of Los Angeles recommended that the letter be held until the appropriate time when it would not jeopardize negotiations with the bill&#146;s author.  The IAIC authorized Chairman Mikels to release the letter when he believed it was appropriate.  An undated copy of this letter is included as part of these minutes.</P></UL>
</UL>
<P><B>Update on Alternative Fuels/ZEV Mandate</B></P>
<UL>
<P>In the absence of Council Member John Cox, his associate, Jennifer Kemp, gave an overview of what SCEP (The Partnership) has been working on the last few months relative to the advancement of alternative fuels and the ZEV mandate.</P>
</UL>

<P><B>Request for Proposals for Audit of AB 2766 Fee Revenue Recipients for Fiscal Years 1993-94 &amp; 1994-95</B></P>
<UL>
<P>Lily Kapur, AQMD Financial Analyst, reported that AB 2766 requires that an audit be performed every two years on a random sample of fee recipients.  The draft Request for Proposals included in the agenda solicits bids to perform the audit of AB 2766 Fee Revenue Recipients for Fiscal Years 1993-94 and 1994-95.  The IAIC members had no comment.</P>
</UL>

<P><B>Update on AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Process</B></P>
<UL>
<P>Chairman Mikels noted that proposed amendments to Senate Bill 836 (Lewis), which would eliminate Rule 2202, includes language to divert AB 2766 discretionary funds in entirety to a state scrapping program, in part to make up for the deficit in emissions reductions which would be lost from the elimination of Rule 2202.  Details were discussed within the Local Government Outreach agenda item.</P>
</UL>

<P><B>Monthly Progress Report on Public Advisor Office Activities</B></P>
<UL>
<P>The agenda package included the Public Advisor's Monthly Activity Report for February 1995 as well as the reports on visiting dignitaries for January and February.  La Ronda Bowen, Public Advisor, reported that there is a sentiment in the small business community that information is not reaching them, and that the AQMD is not as visible in that community as it should be.  Proposals to enhance the AQMD&#146;s presence within the small business community will be presented to the IAIC for feedback at a future meeting.</P>
</UL>

<P><I>There being no public comment or further business, the IAIC meeting adjourned at 2:00 </I><I>p.m.</I></P>

<STRONG><P>Dear Senator Lewis:</P></STRONG>
<P><B><U>Proposed CARB Amendments to Senate Bill 836</U></B></P>
<UL><P>The membership of the Interagency AQMP Implementation Committee (IAIC) is opposed to diverting vehicle registration fees (AB 2766) away from existing programs to fund &#147;new&#148; programs.  The IAIC was established in November 1989 by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) for the purpose of discussing and developing mechanisms to implement the Air Quality Management Plan.  In addition to its initial directive, the IAIC has also become a valuable forum for exchange on all ideas concerning air quality between SCAQMD and local governments.  The IAIC consists of locally elected city and county government officials from Southern California, representatives of transportation commissions, county administrative offices, county councils of governments, leagues of cities, sanitation districts and water districts.</P>
<P>The IAIC understands that SB 836 may be amended to divert vehicle registration fees (AB 2766) away from existing programs in order to fund state efforts, if necessary, to develop an alternative mobile source control measure to replace Rule 2202.  AB 2766 currently authorizes local air districts in non-attainment areas throughout the state to impose a surcharge on vehicle registration.  Monies generated from this fee must be used by the air districts and local governments within those districts for programs to reduce mobile source air pollution.  Local governments throughout the state have used vehicle registration fees to help meet their regulatory obligations under the federal and state clean air acts and make progress toward cleaner air.  Further, county and city governments in the South Coast District who have chosen to receive the available funds have adopted ordinances as required by the statute.  Diversion of vehicle registration monies to fund other mobile source emission reduction programs would impose additional burdens and liabilities on already overburdened local governments and would jeopardize attainment of air quality standards throughout California.</P>
<P>The implementation of the AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Program through the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee has also had the added benefit of stimulating small business enterprises and jump-starting clean air partnerships, resulting in more jobs and a stronger economy for our South Coast cities.  In addition, vehicle registration fees utilized by the SCAQMD to fund various activities and programs which are necessary, such as air quality monitoring, help to minimize costs to the regulated industry, which would otherwise have to subsidize these efforts.</P>
<P>It is inappropriate and counterproductive to take funds away from one program to pay for another when all of our efforts are collectively needed to achieve clean air standards.  We hope that you will seriously consider the negative impacts of diverting vehicle registration fees by the proposed amendments.</P></ul>
<ul><ul><P>      Very truly yours,</P></ul></ul>

<STRONG><P>PROPOSAL: </STRONG>
<UL>
Amend Rule 430 - Breakdown Provisions</P>
</UL>

<STRONG><P>SYNOPSIS:</STRONG>
 <UL>
The proposed amendments to Rule 430 will clarify rule requirements for equipment breakdowns affecting non-RECLAIM pollutants, add permit condition relief, and provide reporting procedures consistent with Rule 2004 - Requirements.</P>
</UL>

<STRONG><P>COMMITTEE:</STRONG>
<UL>
 Not applicable.</P>
</UL>

<STRONG><P>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</P></STRONG>
<UL>
<P>1. Certify the Final Supplemental Environmental Assessment (SEA) for Proposed Amended Regulation XX - Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) and Proposed Amended Rule 430 completed in compliance with CEQA (California Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.); and</P>
<P>2. Amend Rule 430 - Breakdown Provisions.</P>
</UL>

<STRONG><P>  James M. Lents, Ph.D.</P>
<P>  Executive Officer</P></STRONG>
<BR><P>PL:CC:CM:BLY:MHP:scs</P>
<P><B>Background</B></P>
<UL><P>AQMD Rule 430 was originally adopted by the Governing Board on May 7, 1976 to provide relief from violations of Regulation IV - Prohibitions, (except Rule 402 - Nuisance, or Rule 430), and Regulation XI - Source Specific Standards, for a breakdown that meets AQMD criteria.  The period covered under this relief is limited to a maximum of 24 hours from the time the owner or operator knew or reasonably should have known of the breakdown, or to the end of the operating cycle, whichever is sooner.  This rule was subsequently amended on October 8, 1976, December 2, 1977 and May 5, 1978 to improve its enforceability.  The subsequent amendments require that the owner or operator submit a written follow-up report, and that AQMD staff promptly investigate the site to determine whether an occurrence meets all AQMD criteria to qualify as a breakdown.  The vast majority of breakdowns occur at refineries.</P>
<P>However, Rule 430 does not address violations of permit conditions for equipment breakdowns which otherwise meet AQMD criteria.  In addition, the current rule language does not identify a method for the owner or operator to report a breakdown in a timely manner.  These concerns need to be corrected prior to the issuance of Title V permits.</P></UL>
<P><B>Proposal</B></P>
<UL>
<P>Staff  proposes to add rule language to provide relief for violations of certain rules or permit conditions that meets AQMD criteria.  In addition, staff proposes to clarify the definition of operating cycle and to add additional flexibility as to the methods that can be used to notify the AQMD of a breakdown in a timely manner.  Finally, these amendments will make the reporting requirements of Rule 430 consistent with the reporting requirements for RECLAIM facilities specified under Rule 2004 - Requirements.  Most of the proposed amendments reflect the current operating procedures at the AQMD.</P>
</UL>

<P><B>AQMP &amp; Legal Mandates</B></P>
<UL>
<P>The proposed amended rule is administrative in nature and will not impact any AQMP control strategies.  In addition, the proposed amended rule is in accordance with existing state and federal regulations.</P>
</UL>

<P><B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B></P>
<UL>
<P>Pursuant to CEQA, staff prepared a draft Supplemental Environmental Assessment (SEA) for the proposed amendments to Regulation XX and Rule 430.  The draft SEA was circulated for a 45-day public review and comment period ended May 10, 1996.  No comments were received on the draft SEA for Regulation XX and Rule 430.  The Final SEA has been incorporated into this rule package.  In addition, a Socioeconomic Impact Assessment has been prepared and is part of the rule development package.</P>
</UL>

<P><B>Implementation Plan</B></P>
<UL>
<P>Currently, inspectors are promptly assigned to investigate a reported breakdown.  In order to investigate the reported breakdown in a timely manner, certain inspectors are assigned on-call duty during the periods outside of the normal AQMD working hours, including but not limited to weekends.  In the event that the owner or operator files for a variance, engineers are assigned to determine the excess emissions resulting from the breakdown.  The above implementation will not be changed by the proposed amendments.  As always, staff will be available to assist those facilities affected by the proposed amendments.</P>
</UL>

<P><B>Resource Impacts</B></P>
<UL>
<P>The proposed amendments to Rule 430 will provide breakdown relief from permit conditions and eliminate conflicting reporting requirements between Rule 430 and Rule 2004.  No additional AQMD resources are required to implement the proposed amendments.  The variance proceedings under the proposed amended rule and the current rule are similar; therefore, it is expected that the public will continue to obtain assistance through AQMD&#146;s Clerk of the Board, Hearing Board Liaison, and General Counsel&#146;s Office.</P>

<b>Background</b><p>
On October 15, 1993, the AQMD Governing Board adopted the RECLAIM program.  RECLAIM, crafted as part of the strategy to bring the South Coast Air Basin (SCAB) into compliance with federal and state ambient air quality standards, requires participating facilities to reduce emissions of NOx and SOx by levels equivalent to those required by the command and control rules RECLAIM replaced.

<p>At the time of adoption, some industries had concerns about the amount of reductions proposed in the AQMP.  Thus, Rule 2015 - Backstop Provisions required an evaluation of the ending emission factors for six source categories including gray cement kilns.  The technical evaluation of gray cement kilns has been completed.  Other amendments have been identified which will increase flexibility in monitoring, provide more accurate emission factors, allow greater efficiency in providing reports to the Governing Board, clarify super compliance requirements, better define peaking units, provide relief from violations of certain rules and permit conditions for a breakdown that meets AQMD criteria, and make the reporting information consistent between Rule 430 and Rule 2004.

<p><b>Proposal</b><p>
AQMD proposes to update emission factors for facilities subject to RECLAIM.  Based on the technology review presented in the Staff Report and on source testing performed on specific processes, it is proposed that the ending emission factor for gray cement kilns be amended; new categories with associated emission factors be added for delacquering furnaces and pot furnaces; and a new category with associated emission factors be added for new or modified boilers subject to BACT requirements.  AQMD proposes to add rule language to clarify the status of RTC allocations after the year 2010.  Other clean up amendments are proposed for clarification and more accurate reporting of emissions.

<p>In addition, amendments are proposed to increase flexibility in monitoring by the addition of a limited time for CEMS repair due to shutdown and the addition of missing data procedures for process units.  Amendments are also proposed to clarify require-ments for super compliance, allow all reports to the Governing Board to be provided at the same time, and make breakdown provisions consistent between Rule 430 and Rule 2004.  An amendment is also proposed to limit the use of peaking units by modifying the definition.

<p><b>AQMP & Legal Mandates</b><p>
The cumulative emission impacts of the proposed Rule 2002 amendments are significant for NOx emissions because they exceed the CEQA significance threshold of 55 pounds per day.  The proposed amendments will result in an increase of 1.8 tons per day of  NOx emissions for the year 2000.  RECLAIM complies with Health and Safety Code Section 39616, equivalency, because these proposed amendments reflect the most stringent feasible air pollution control technology.  These amendments will therefore result in equivalent or greater emission reductions when compared to current command and control regulations and future air quality measures that would have been adopted as part of the AQMD's plan for attainment.

<p><b>CEQA & Socioeconomic Analysis</b>
<p>Pursuant to CEQA, staff prepared a draft Supplemental Environmental Assessment (SEA) for the proposed amendments to Regulation XX - RECLAIM.  The draft SEA was circulated for a 45-day public review and comment period that ended May 10, 1996.  No comments were received on the draft SEA for Regulation XX.  The Final SEA has been incorporated into this rule package.  In addition, a Socioeconomic Impact Assessment has been prepared and is part of the rule development package.

<p><b>Implementation Plan
</b><p>The proposed amendments do not appreciably change the RECLAIM program and are not expected to change the implementation of RECLAIM rules.  Only minor adjust-ments to the implementation procedures are needed for CEMS for large sources and breakdown emissions.  As always, staff will be available to assist those facilities affected by the proposed amendments.

<p><b>Resource Impacts</b>
<p>Implementation of these proposals will result in more efficient use of AQMD staff time due to the consolidation of the current three separate status reports on aspects of the RECLAIM program into on combined annual report to the Governing Board.

<p>Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options was adopted on
December 8, 1995. As one compliance strategy, Rule 2202 allows employers
to invest in the AQIP. Monies received are placed in a restricted account
to fund programs that result in equivalent emission reductions than would
otherwise have been achieved by the participating employers. Staff evaluated
the proposals received during the first quarter of 1996 and recommends
several for funding. The amount available for this quarter is $2,987,004.
This was presented to the Mobile Source Committee on May 17, 1996. </p>

<P><B>ATTENDANCE:  </B>
<p>In the absence of Committee Chairperson Candace Haggard, Committee Vice Chairperson Nell Soto, and Committee Members Ron Loveridge, Mee Hae Lee, and Marvin Braude, Governing Board Chairman Jon Mikels appointed himself ad hoc Committee Chairperson for the July 26, 1996 meeting only.  An attendance roster is attached (Attachment I).
<P><B>MOBILE SOURCE COMMITTEE DISCUSSION ITEMS</B>
<P><B>1. Legislative Update</B>
<P> Staff stated that the legislature is currently in recess, and there has been no change in the status of pending legislation since the previous report to the Committee.
<P><B>2. Progress Report on 1997 AQMP/PM <SUB>10</SUB>  Task Force</B>
<P> Staff reported that the main focus of the PM<SUB>10</SUB> Task Force meeting was the overview of the 1997 AQMP.  However, since most of the Mobile Source Committee meeting participants had already heard the AQMP presentation previously, in the interest of time, staff proposed to skip the formal AQMP presentation and volunteered to sit down with any interested member of the audience after the meeting for a detailed presentation.  Chairman Mikels agreed.
<P><B>3. REACH Task Force</B>
<P> Staff gave a brief overview of the Task Force activities.  Staff reported that during the last meeting, the consultants presented the results of their modeling analysis on the effectiveness of the various pricing strategies considered in terms of reducing congestion and emissions, and cost-effectiveness.  AQMD staff expressed their reservations about the cost-effectiveness of the pricing strategies considered.  Staff also reported that there was considerable confusion among the task force participants regarding the contents and assumptions included in the enhanced transit scenario considered.  SCAG agreed to give a detailed account of the assumptions included in the scenario at the next meeting.  A summary of the last two Task Force meetings are attached (Attachment 3).

<P>  James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br>  Executive Officer
<P><font size=-2>PL:AG:LY:XV: TL</font>
 
<P><HR ALIGN=CENTER><P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>Rule 1171 - Solvent Cleaning Operations, represents the single largest emission reduction rule which would have been subsumed by VOC RECLAIM, an emissions trading program.  The VOC RECLAIM program, which had been under development since 1991, included about 1,200 companies that used paints, coatings, solvents, and adhesives.  As proposed, this emissions trading program would have reduced VOC emissions by 20.8 tons per day by 2005.  In January 1996, the AQMD Governing Board decided to stop work on VOC RECLAIM and directed staff to expeditiously proceed with the development of other VOC emission reduction rules to meet our AQMP commitments.  Rule 1171 is the first and the largest emission reduction rule proposal in this category.  
<P>Both VOC RECLAIM and Proposed Amended Rule 1171 would have produced comparable VOC emission reductions by 2010.  However, they differ in applicability and focus of control strategy.  While VOC RECLAIM was designed for about 1,200 larger companies that used a variety of VOC products, this rule proposal is focused on solvent cleaning operations at any facility, irrespective of its size or permitting status.  Therefore, Rule 1171, as proposed, will reduce VOC emissions from over 30,000 companies within the jurisdiction of the AQMD.
<P>Rule 1171 - Solvent Cleaning Operations was originally was adopted on August 2, 1991, and further amended on May 8, 1995.  The primary purpose of the rule is to reduce the emissions of  Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from solvent cleaning activities during the production, repair, maintenance, or servicing of  products, tools, machinery, and general work areas.  Such cleaning may be performed at auto repair facilities, garages and service stations, printing shops, metal fabrication facilities, electronics manufacturing facilities and other businesses.  The rule does not apply to certain solvent cleaning operations that are governed by other AQMD rules including solvent degreasers (Rule 1122) and the cleaning of aircraft components (Rule 1124), nor does it apply to residential, institutional, or janitorial cleaning.
<P>Prior to the adoption of Rule 1171 in 1991, each Regulation XI - Source Specific Standards rule contained provisions for solvent cleaning.  The development of Rule 1171 unified such requirements, but introduced different solvent cleaning categories including general cleaning, repair and maintenance cleaning, cleaning of coating and adhesive application equipment, and cleaning of ink application equipment.  Each solvent cleaning category was subject to prescribed VOC and/or vapor pressure limits.  In addition, the devices and methods used for solvent cleaning operations were required to meet specific requirements.  
<P>Rule 1171 was amended in May 1995 to alleviate SIP deficiencies cited by the federal EPA and to addressrectify industry concerns. The amendments did not achieve additional VOC emission reductions.  This action was largely administrative in nature and included addresseding specialty cleaning operations (e.g., medical device manufacturing) and  the refinedment and clarifiedcation of rule language (e.g., test methods and definitions).  
 
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Based on extensive AQMD study and supporting ARB data, the emission inventory for cleaning operations subject to Rule 1171 is projected at 35.9 tons per day of VOCs from permitted and unpermitted sources in both the industrial and commercial sectors.  The proposed amendments to Rule 1171 will achieve VOC emissions reduction of 20.5 tons per day by 2010 or a 46% reduction in the future Rule 1171 VOC emission inventory.

<P>The proposed emission abatements reflect staffs technical assessment regarding low-VOC solvent cleaning materials available today.  Aqueous cleaners containing no VOCs or minimal VOCs (< 50 grams per liter) are used successfully in repair and maintenance cleaning in various equipment including parts washers and remote reservoir cleaners.  Aqueous cleaning materials cost less than their high-VOC organic solvent counterparts currently in use, although some aqueous cleaners may require heating, resulting in higher energy costs.  The extended bath life of such cleaners also minimizes hazardous waste and its associated costs.  Overall, the conversion from petroleum-based solvent cleaners to aqueous cleaners is driven by the resulting cost savings.  Some key issues in the wide-scale employment of water-based cleaning systems include water resources, hazardous waste, and water quality. 

<P>Acetone, which has been delisted as a VOC, is used successfully in certain handwipe cleaning operations.  Conversion to acetone costs no more than petroleum solvents cur-rently in use.  Health and safety considerations are the key issues in employing acetone as a cleaning solvent, which is more acceptable in blends and diluted solutions than in its pure form.

<P>In January, 1996, at the outset of this rulemaking effort, a Rule 1171 Advisory Panel was formed with experts from the solvent cleaning industry including manufacturers, vendors and consultants.  AQMD staff met with the panel on several occasions to gather and discuss relevant information and technologies involving solvent cleaning operations prior to drafting a rule proposal.  Three public meetings, noticed in newspapers pursuant to applicable law, were held to solicit public input relative to the staff rule proposal.  Staff has met several times with individual companies and persons who requested pri-vate meetings to discuss Proposed Amended Rule 1171.  Staff also visited various fa-cilities to observe first-hand a variety of cleaning processes including operations at fa-cilities that have successfully converted to low- and zero-VOC cleaning materials.


 
 
<P><B>Summary of  The  Proposed Amendments </B>
<P>The staff proposal will:
<UL>
<LI><P> lower the VOC limit for repair and maintenance cleaning from 900 to 50 grams per liter, effective January 1, 1999;
<LI><P> include special subcategories under repair and maintenance cleaning for medical devices and electrical apparatus components;
<LI><P> lower the vapor pressure limit for the cleaning of lithographic and letterpress ink application equipment from 25 mm Hg @ 68xF to 10 mm Hg @ 68xF, effective January 1, 1999;
<LI><P> lower the VOC limit for the cleaning of polyester resin application equipment from 200 to 50 grams per liter, effective January 1, 1997;
<LI><P> provide incentives (e.g. emission fee reduction and recordkeeping exemption) for the use of non-polluting cleaning materials as defined as in &quot; Clean Air Solvents;&quot;;; and,
<LI><P> include an aerosol exemption which was inadvertently deleted from the May 1995 amendments.
</UL>

<P><B>Reactivity</B>
<P>Some providers of petroleum-based cleaning solvents and cleaning systems have opposed the staff-recommended lower VOC grams/liter limit based on the feasibility of aqueous or low VOC (&lt;50 grams/liter) cleaning solvents and systems.  The AQMD has been asked to consider the reactivity of a hydrocarbon-based or petroleum-based solvent in lieu of a total volume reduction of VOCs as currently proposed.  The use of reactivity as a regulatory tool has been debated at the local, state, and national level for over twenty years.  Reactivity of a solvent refers to its ozone forming potential.  Reactivity issues were thoroughly assessed during the VOC RECLAIM rule development process over a period of several years.  The results were inconclusive.  Although it is inappropriate to delay VOC emission reductions based on this concern, it may be appropriate to study the issue further if new information not analyzed in previous AQMD study efforts is brought forward.
<P><B>AQMP  and  Legal Mandates</B>
<P>The California Health and Safety Code requires the AQMD to adopt an AQMP to meet state and federal ambient air quality standards in the Basin.  In addition, the California Health and Safety Code requires that the AQMD adopt rules and regulations that carry out the objectives of the AQMP.

 
<P>The Rule 1171 emissions inventory is estimated at 35.9 tons per day of VOCs, based on 1993 emissions data reported by the affected industry and subsequently corroborated by the ARB data.  Based on current activity levels, no increase in the Rule 1171 inventory is assumed until 1999.  With an AQMP growth rate of 2% per year from 1999 to 2010, the unregulated emissions inventory would grow to 44.6 tons per day in 2010.  The rules impact on the current emission inventory and this growth will produce an esti-mated emission reduction of 20.5 tons per day.  The picture is depicted graphically be-low.

<P>Pursuant to CEQA and the AQMDs Certified Regulatory Program (Rule 110), staff has prepared a Draft Subsequent Environmental Assessment (EA) for Proposed Amended Rule 1171.  The Draft Subsequent EA has been released for a 45-day public review pe-riod.  All comments received on the Draft Subsequent EA will be responded to in the final EA document.
<P>The environmental topics analyzed in this Draft Subsequent EA are air quality, water resources, hazards, public services (fire departments), and energy resources.  The analysis concludes that the proposed amendments may result in significant adverse air quality and water resource impacts.  
<P>The potential air quality impacts would be due to increased NOx emissions associated with the electrical requirements to heat water-based cleaning systems.  While it is un-likely that electric generating facilities would need to generate additional electricity to account for the potential incremental increased demand, the significant determination is based on a worst-case scenario.
<P>As is currently the case with organic solvent-based cleaning operations, water-based cleaning activities may lead to adverse impacts on water resources if not handled prop-erly.  This potential impact may be exacerbated by some vendors of water-based clean-ing solvents advertising that their products are sewer safe.  Accordingly, the proposed amendments may result in significant adverse water quality impacts even though:  1) proper disposal would preclude this effect, and  2) some organic solvent-based cleaning operators may currently be illegally disposing of spent cleaning materials.
<P>As a result of the determination of significance, a Statement of Findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations will be prepared for the Governing Boards review prior to the public hearing for the proposed amendments.


<P><B>Socioeconomic Assessment</B>
<P>The socioeconomic assessment found that adoption of the proposed amendments to Rule 1171 would provide a cost savings to the affected industry of approximately $4.5 mil-lion annually.  While compliance with the 50-gram-per-liter VOC content limit would increase equipment and operation costs, the savings in materials and disposal costs would more than offset these.  The $4.5 million annual savings would be achieved in the categories of Surface Preparation and General Cleaning, and Remote Reservoir Clean-ing.  Other cleaning categories are expected to comply with the amendments by switch-ing to acetone, aqueous cleaners, or lower vapor pressure solvents, with no increase in costs.
<P><B>Implementation Plan</B>
<P>Source training classes will be scheduled to assist facilities in implementing the pro-posed revisions to Rule 1171.  Notices will be sent to the sources affected by these amendments.  Staff will conduct special outreach efforts to inform the general public about this solvent cleaning regulation.


<P><B>Resource Impact</B>
<P>Current AQMD resources are sufficient to implement the proposed Rule 1171 amendmentsrule amendmentswith noegative the budget impact.

<p><br><p><br><center><b>BOARD MEETING DATE:  August 9, 1996  AGENDA NO. 4</b></center>
<br><P><br><b>Proposal:</b><blockquote> Award Bid for a Cafeteria Management Firm</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> ARAMARK operates the AQMD cafeteria under a contract expiring September 30, 1996.  On March 8, 1996, the Board authorized the release of an RFP for a food services management company.  Extensive outreach resulted in ten bid submittals.  This action is to engage the services of the most qualified bidder.</blockquote>
<P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote> The Administrative Committee did not meet in July.</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>Award the bid for cafeteria management services to Food Systems, Inc. for the period of October 1, 1996 through September 30, 1999 and authorize the Chairman to execute a contract with Food Systems, Inc. for the management and operation of the AQMD&#146;s Diamond Bar Headquarters cafeteria.</blockquote> 
<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br> Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The RFP for a cafeteria management firm to operate the Diamond Bar Headquarters Cafeteria facility was approved by the Board on March 8, 1996 and released on that date.
<P><B>Bid Evaluation</B>
<P>In accordance with the District&#146;s Consulting and Contracting Policy, a public notice inviting bids was published in the following publications:
<P> <I>California State Contracts Register, Chinese Daily News, Eastern Group Publications, El Chicano, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, Korea Central Daily, La Opinion, La Voz, Los </I><I>Angeles Sentinel, Los Angeles Times, M/W/DVBE Source, Orange County Register, Philippine News, Precinct Reporter, Rafu Shimpo, Riverside Press Enterprise, San Bernardino Sun, The Black Voice News, and The Excelsior</I>. 
<P>Additionally, potential bidders were identified through Los Angeles County&#146;s Directory of Certified Minority, Women, Disadvantaged and Disabled Veterans Business Enterprises; the Directory of Certified Firms published by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority; The Inland Area Opportunity Pages Ethnic/Women Business &amp; Professional Directory; the Caltrans electronic bulletin board listing of Disadvantaged and Women Business Enterprises; the AQMD's own electronic listing of certified minority vendors; and the Purchasing mailing list.  
<P>Copies of the RFP also were mailed to the California Restaurant Association, the Black Caucus, Latino Caucus, and various minority chamber of commerce and business associations, and public service announcements were sent out to 77 local radio, TV and cable stations.  The RFP also was posted on the Internet.  Further personal outreach efforts by staff were made to various minority businesses and chambers of commerce to inform and invite prospective bidders to visit the Diamond Bar facility and to submit proposals.
<P>Two hundred thirty five copies of the RFP were mailed out and twenty-five companies attended the mandatory bidders conferences held on March 22 and June 4, 1996.  Of the twenty-five organizations attending the bidders conferences, three were Hispanic-owned enterprises, two were woman-owned firms, one company was Asian-owned, and one was African-American-owned.  
<P>Ten bids were received in response to the RFP when final bidding closed at 1:00 p.m. on June 14, 1996.  Of the ten<B> </B>bids, two were from woman-owned business enterprises (one of which has applied for, but has not yet received, WBE certification), and one was from a non-certified minority-owned (Hispanic) business enterprise.  Staff contacted the companies that did not submit bids to determine the reasons for not submitting a proposal.  Some companies indicated that they were unfamiliar with the RFP process, while other companies felt that the cafeteria&#146;s profitability was limited due to the four-day workweek, hours of operation, and number of meals served.
<P>An evaluation panel was established to review the bids received.  This panel consisted of five District staff members, three females and two males.  Of the five panel members, one member is Asian, one is African-American, one is Hispanic, and two are Caucasian.
<P>After reviewing the written proposals received and conducting site visits for those non-franchise operators who have currently operating facilities, panel members evaluated bidders on the following criteria:  quality of food service, management and food service experience, financial capacity and fiscal management, budget and menu prices, and MBE/WBE/DVBE status.  Total point scores were then tabulated.
<P>As a result of the above evaluation process, Food Systems, Inc. received a total point score of 81.6 -- the highest score attained (see Attachment).  On this basis, the evaluation panel has recommended the cafeteria management contract be awarded to Food Systems, Inc.  
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>This is a no-fee contract; the costs of the cafeteria are supported by the revenue generated from the provision of food services.

CLEAN AIR NIGHT - AQMD's Public Advisor and Media staff facilitated Clean
Air Night at the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes game on June 26, 1996. As part of
the promotional night, Board Chairman Jon Mikels and Board Members Nell Soto
and Leonard Paulitz participated in a first ball ceremony. The first 3,000
fans in attendance were given sports bottles, purchased by the Quakes from
the AQMD's Clean Air Store, with an air quality message on the bottles, and
air quality informational materials inserted inside. Public service announcements
on the AQMD and its public programs were made between innings. Also,
informational brochures and materials were distributed to the 5,000-plus
fans in attendance before and during the game from an AQMD information booth
staffed by AQMD staff.
<P>
AQMD participated as a co-sponsor of the Coalition for Clean Air's (CCA)
General Membership Meeting, which was held on Saturday, June 15, 1996, at
Cal Poly Pomona. The program included a discussion on Smog and Health, with
panelists Drs. Craig Jones and Jean Hanley, respiratory specialists with
the Mobile Asthma Treatment Clinic and Lourdes Martinez of the AQMD. Governing
Board Member Nell Soto introduced the keynote speaker, actor Edward James
Olmos, who thanked the attendees for their work and commitment towards achieving
clean air in our basin. Event organizers provided attendees with a variety
of environmental displays, including the AQMD's Mobile Air Quality Monitoring
Lab and clean fuel cars, trucks and buses.

<B>SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE ON THE INTERNET</B>
<P>
Since the AQMD initiated a home page on the World Wide Web,
<A href = "/business/basb.html"> Small Business Assistance Office (SBAO)</A>
has been exploring the benefits of providing information on the Internet
to the small business community. Although many small businesses do not have
access to the Internet, with each passing year businesses are connecting
at an exponential rate. Businesses also obtain information from the Internet
through indirect means such as consultants, city planners, associations,
and peer groups who are on the Web.
<P>
Small Business Assistance Office recently updated the AQMD Home Page with
information on services we provide. Viewers will learn about our technical
consultations, the Air Quality Assistance Fund, and how to obtain variances
if needed. They may also submit comments and suggestions via the E-mail feature
provided. Our latest revisions to the Home Page will include a hyperlink
to an air quality checklist to help businesses determine if they need an
air quality permit.
<P>
<B>PERMIT ASSISTANCE CENTERS RECEIVE NEW COMPUTERS/UPGRADES</B>
<P>
The permit assistance centers at Van Nuys, Los Angeles City Hall and the
Business Revitalization Center in Baldwin Hills have recently been equipped
with "386" personal computers. Previously, computers were provided at Santa
Ana, Ontario, and Downey to allow air quality engineers to process permit
applications when they were not assisting business customers. Staff will
use the new computers to access the AQMD's mainframe computer to obtain
information on permit applications, rules, and billing issues. The computers
will also provide access to E-mail and Microsoft Word so that staff can complete
work assignments at the centers. All of the computers have been upgraded
with a faster modem to reduce phone charges and minimize delays.

<B>ACTIVITIES</B>
<P>
Activities during this reporting period included participation in 2 Red Team
meetings with Enprotec and Heritage Bag, and 6 community outreach projects.
Assistance was provided to various facilities wanting to expand or consolidate
their operations. Companies were informed of emerging new pollution reduction
technologies as well as technology transfer opportunities. EDBR staff also
participated in 4 different public outreach meetings by making presentations
and providing information to interested parties. The total number of participants
reached through these 3 meetings exceeds 300 people.

<B>EDBR SPONSORS POLLUTION PREVENTION CENTER</B>
<P>
The Pollution Prevention Center is sponsored under the Technology Reinvestment
Project, a program for defense conversion which is administered by the National
Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST). The Center is a long term,
multi-media research and assistance center. It is cosponsored by California
EPA's Department of Toxic Substance Control, Los Angeles City and County
Sanitation Districts, the Orange County Sanitation District, Southern California
Edison and the AQMD. The Center performs research and technical assistance
activities to identify, test and implement low- or non- solvent technologies
in a wide range of applications. The applications include: 1) the elimination
of use of CFC 1-1-3 and 1-1-1 trichloroethane (TCA), 2) elimination of VOC
solvents or chlorinated solvents, 3) replacement of solvents in wipe cleaning,
repair maintenance cleaning, printed circuit boards rework, and cleaning
of equipment, 4) adhesive applications, 5) technical assistance to small
and medium sized aerospace subcontractors in the areas of cleaning, electronics,
coatings, adhesives and paint stripping. The District is cost sharing $20,000
of this $366,000 one year effort.
<P>
<B>TA MANUFACTURING</B>
<P>
TA Manufacturing is located in Glendale and make line blocks and clamps for
the aircraft industry. They are in an expansion mode and, through a Red Team,
contacted EDBR staff to investigate what problems, if any, would be encountered
by relocating within the Basin and expanding. They have approximately 160
employees and are a 50 year old company with its parent located in Belview,
Washington. While there were no significant AQMD issues that would impact
such a move within the Basin it turns out that there is significant motivation
for this company to move from Glendale to Sylmar in that entitlement fees
in Sylmar are zero and in Glendale they are $214,000/year. EDBR staff will
assist in this relocation/expansion effort.
<P>
<B>INTERNATIONAL TRADE EXHIBITION</B>
<P>
On August 2, 1996, an international trade show and exhibition will be held
at the Industry Hills Sheraton Resort Hotel. It is anticipated that upwards
of 1,500 participants will view the exhibits and take place in discussions
over a three day period. Spearheading the formation of this trade show is
Assemblywoman Grace Napolitano and members of the different cities within
her District. EDBR staff is involved in a significant outreach for this trade
show, mailing up to 2,000 invitations to customers/businesses that we have
worked with within the assemblywoman's district.

<P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
The Rule Forecast Report presented to your Board each month outlines for
the up-coming 18 months the anticipated meeting dates that staff will bring
these control measures and additional rules forward for Board adoption. The
Rule Forecast Report is amended as necessary to reflect Board decisions regarding
the rule adoptions or when additional staff research or public consultations
postpone proposed adoption hearing dates.
<P>
<B>Proposal</B>
<P>
The draft 1997 AQMP proposes seven control measures to reduce VOC emissions,
one for NOx, and seven for PM10, including ten major control measures proposed
to be adopted during the end of 1996 and through 1997. The most significant
of the control measures to be brought before the Board in 1996 and early
1997 are seven measures that are also contained in the 1994 AQMP. Six of
these measures are designed to reduce VOC emissions, while another measure
will reduce PM10 emissions. The proposed control measures for VOC include:
<P>
&#183; Rule 1171 - Solvent Cleaning Operations
<P>
Proposed amendments will provide more than half of the VOC emission reductions
from stationary sources required by 2005. Emissions will be further reduced
by the use of cleanup solvents containing less VOC.
<P>
&#183; Rule 1107 - Coating of Metal Parts and Products
<P>
Proposed amendments include requirements for using reformulated low-VOC content
coatings and application methods with high transfer efficiency. Alternately,
control equipment with high collection and destruction efficiencies may be
required.
<P>
&#183; Rule 1113 - Architectural Coatings
<P>
Proposed amendments include requirements for using reformulated low-VOC content
coatings.
<P>
&#183; Proposed Rule 1138 - Restaurant Operations
<P>
Proposed language includes requirements for establishing a limit on the total
amount of emissions (PM10 as well as VOC) from a restaurant, rather than
limits on individual pieces of cooking equipment. However, as there are many
different methods of controlling emissions, the selection of the method would
be made by the establishment.
<P>
&#183; Rule 1145 - Plastic, Rubber, and Glass Coatings
<P>
Proposed amendments will include requirements for using reformulated low-VOC
content coatings and application methods with high transfer efficiency.
Alternately, control equipment with high collection and destruction efficiencies
may be required.
<P>
&#183; 1176 - Sumps and Wastewater Separators
<P>
Proposed amendments will ensure further emission reductions from process
drains and wastewater separators at refineries and chemical plants.
<P>
The stationary source PM10 control is Proposed Rule 1105.1, which will require
controls on petroleum refinery fluid catalytic cracking units. Adoption of
the six VOC control measures will more than compensate for the emission
reductions previously anticipated in the 1994 AQMP to be accomplished by
VOC RECLAIM.
<P>
Pending the Board's action on the draft 1997 AQMP, the Rule Forecast Report
will be amended to accurately reflect the proposed additions and deletions
of control measures scheduled for adoption.

BOARD MEETING DATE: August 9, 1996 AGENDA NO. 8</B></center><br><br>
<P><b>Report:</b><blockquote> Lead Agency Projects and Environmental Documents Received by the AQMD</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> This report provides for the Board&#146;s consideration a listing of CEQA documents received by the AQMD between June 4, 1996 and July 1, 1996, and those projects for which the AQMD is acting as lead agency pursuant to CEQA.</blockquote>
<P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote> Mobile Source, July 26, 1996, received and filed.</blockquote>

<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br> Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P><B>EIR and Document Log (Attachments A and B)</B> - Each month, the AQMD receives numerous CEQA documents from other public agencies on projects which could adversely affect air quality.  A listing of all documents received for review during the past month are contained in Attachment A.  Monthly listings which are shaded note those CEQA documents for which the AQMD staff has or will prepare and submit comments to the lead agency.  A list of active projects from previous months for which AQMD staff is continuing to evaluate or prepare comments is included as Attachment B.  The column captioned &quot;Public Concerns&quot; identifies parties who have contacted the AQMD with concerns or issues about the proposed project.  A notation of 1 in this column indicates the contact was supportive of the project noted.  A notation of 2 indicates the party was opposed or expressed concerns about the project.  A notation of 3 indicates that no one contacted the AQMD about that project.
<P>In the past, AQMD staff routinely reviewed many of these documents and commented upon the air quality analyses and possible impacts on the air quality of the district.  Due to staffing constraints, the AQMD is no longer able to routinely comment on all CEQA documents received.  Publication of the Board-approved <I>CEQA Air</I> <I>Quality Handbook</I>, however, has provided local governments and other public agencies with the necessary information to prepare appropriate air quality analyses on projects for which they act as lead agency.  As resources permit, staff evaluates and may prepare comments for projects that may have significant adverse regional air quality impacts (e.g., special event centers, landfills, etc.) and those projects for which a lead or responsible agency has specifically requested AQMD review.
<P><B>AQMD Lead Agency Projects (Attachment C)</B> - Pursuant to CEQA, the AQMD periodically acts as lead agency on stationary source permit projects.  Under CEQA the lead agency is responsible for determining whether an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) or a Negative Declaration is necessary for any proposal considered to be a &quot;project&quot; as defined by CEQA.  An EIR is prepared when the AQMD as lead agency finds substantial evidence that the proposed project may have a significant adverse effect on the environment.  A Negative Declaration may be prepared if the AQMD determines that the proposed project will not generate significant adverse environmental impacts.  The Negative Declaration is a written statement describing the reasons a proposed project will not have a significant adverse effect on the environment and, therefore, does not require the preparation of an EIR.
<P>Attachment C to this report summarizes the active projects for which the AQMD is lead agency and is currently preparing or has prepared environmental documentation.  As noted in Attachment C, during June 1996, the AQMD certified the CEQA documents for two (2) projects, continued working on CEQA documents for three (3) active projects, and received a request to be lead agency on the CEQA document for one (1) project.
<P>To date in 1996, the AQMD, as lead agency, prepared or contracted for the preparation of and certified three (3) CEQA documents.

<P><B>Summary</B>
<P>The Advisory Council discussed the AQMD&#146;s plan to streamline its monitoring program and reduce the number of air monitoring stations throughout the Basin as well as the recently released Oxygenated Fuels Study by NAS/NRC, which concluded that the fuel additive methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) is unlikely to pose a substantial risk to humans.  The Council also focused on the 1997 AQMP, especially the modeling assumptions forming the basis for control strategies.  The Council&#146;s Atmospheric Sciences Committee will be meeting further with staff on this issue to provide input into the 1997 AQMP prior to its presentation to the Governing Board in the fall.  The Advisory Council approved its April 25, 1996, meeting minutes.

</ul><P> Mr. Braude:  Referring to August 9 newspaper articles regarding the resignation of nine Advisory Council members, expressed his concern and called for Board discussion on the matter.  Chairman Mikels indicated his intent to make a motion later in the meeting to add an item to the agenda concerning a presentation by staff on the 1997 AQMP, and he believed it would be appropriate at that time to also add discussion of the Advisory Council resignations.

<P><B>OTHER BUSINESS</B>
<P> Chairman Mikels commented that because of the controversy in the press in regard to the 1997 AQMP, he thought it would be appropriate for the Executive Officer to give a brief presentation on the AQMP.
<P><blockquote>CHAIRMAN MIKELS MOVED THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR THE BOARD TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO RECEIVE A PUBLIC SUMMARY OF THE 1997 REVISION TO THE AQMP, AND THAT THE NEED FOR ACTION CAME TO THE ATTENTION OF THE BOARD SUBSEQUENT TO THE POSTING OF THE AGENDA.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. BRAUDE AND PASSED BY A UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent:  Antonovich and Braude).</blockquote>
<P><ol start = 19><li> Summary of the 1997 Revision to the AQMP
<P> Barry Wallerstein, DEO of Planning, Transportation &amp; Information Management and 
<BR>Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, acknowledged staff members who worked on developing the 1997 AQMP.  James M. Lents, Ph.D., Executive Officer, summarized the process for developing the Plan and highlighted the key components of the Plan, including additions to the Plan, measures removed from the Plan, and further evaluation measures.
<P> Part of the controversy expressed following public release of the 1997 Draft AQMP on August 2, 1996 involves staff's finding that the Basin can carry more emissions than what was believed in 1994, and still meet present ozone and PM10 standards.  Two valid questions have been raised by the public<I>:  (i) Should more measures be removed from the 182(e)(5) section of the Plan and be </I><I>specifically committed to in the AQMP?;  and (ii) Should AQMD consider potential new federal </I><I>standards for ozone and fine particulates?</I>  State law does not allow submittal of a Plan which includes measures to meet standards which have not yet been adopted.  However, staff has included a chapter in the Plan referring to the potential new standards and indicating that when the new standards are adopted, it will force a tightening of the Plan.
<P> Public workshops and hearings on the 1997 AQMP will be held throughout the South Coast region from September 4 through October 3, 1996, with the formal adoption hearing by the Board tentatively scheduled for October 25, 1996.
<P>(Mr. Antonovich arrived at 10:05 a.m.)
<P> Mr. Loveridge and Mr. Braude questioned staff about the differences in the emissions estimates made in 1994 and those for the 1997 AQMP.  Dr. Wallerstein and Program Supervisor Mel Zeldin responded that staff has gathered new data, primarily on fugitive dust and ammonia emissions.  Staff has also used newer, more technologically advanced models and has much greater confidence in the results yielded by the new modeling.
<P> In response to a question by Mr. Paulitz concerning the federal sources, Dr. Wallerstein indicated that the draft 1997 Plan contains the same set of measures submitted by the State Air Resources Board as part of the 1994 Ozone SIP.  The EPA has released for public comment draft standards relative to on-road and heavy-duty diesel engines.  In addition, it is working on a statement of policy and principles on off-road engines which staff believes will yield another set of standards called for under the SIP.  In addition to that, the USEPA recently embarked upon a public consultation process to receive broad input on its portion of the Plan, and staff expects there to be refinements required to the Plan once EPA has completed that process some time in 1997.
<P> Bill Quinn, California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance (CCEEB), addressed the Board to express support for staff's efforts in developing the 1997 AQMP.  CCEEB believes that AQMD is among the top--if not the top--air district in the state, as far as staff&#146;s technical ability to look at these issues.  The process for developing the AQMP and AQMD rules has been very public, and staff tends to be very conservative in their recommendations to the Board.
<P><blockquote>CHAIRMAN MIKELS MOVED THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR THE BOARD TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO CONSIDER THE MATTER OF THE ADVISORY COUNCIL RESIGNATIONS, AND THAT THE NEED FOR ACTION CAME TO THE ATTENTION OF THE BOARD SUBSEQUENT TO THE POSTING OF THE AGENDA.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ AND PASSED BY A UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent:  Burke).</blockquote>
<P><li> Advisory Council
<P> The Board discussed the resignation letter dated August 8, 1996 to Chairman Mikels signed by eight Advisory Council members; and the letter dated August 8, 1996 from 
<BR>Dr. R. Nichols Hazelwood, Advisory Council Chairman.  Although Dr. Hazelwood had planned to resign from the Advisory Council this summer, he stated he would be willing, in light of the resignations of eight of the Council members, to delay his resignation for a few months to provide for an orderly transition.
<P> In response to a question by Mr. Braude, Dr. Lents stated that while there has been long standing concerns by the Advisory Council members as to whether or not they are being used adequately, he had no indications of their concerns relative to the 1997 AQMP.
<P> Mr. Antonovich expressed his belief that the Council members&#146; resignations bring a reality check upon the policies that the Board has recently developed which have worked to move the economy forward, and he welcomed the change as an opportunity to have an advisory council which understands that clean air is only achievable through an expanding economy.
<P> Emphasizing the need for members of the Advisory Council to understand that it is an advisory board, and does not make policy decisions, Mr. Silva expressed his belief that there are many people in the Basin who would like to serve in that capacity and would have a fair and balanced approach to clean air and the economy.  Further, he believed the Board is obligated to respect the decision of the Advisory Council members to resign; and the Board should now move forward with replacing those members who resigned.
<P> Mr. Paulitz, Ms. Soto and Mr. Loveridge commented in support of inviting the Advisory Council members to meet with the Board and give their rationale for resigning.  Because of the presumption that their resignations were relative to concerns about the 1997 AQMP, they felt it was necessary for the Board to understand their rationale before adopting the 1997 AQMP.
<P> Dr. Wilson questioned whether anything was done differently in the process of developing the 1997 AQMP than in development of previous Plans with respect to involvement of the Advisory Council.  Dr. Wallerstein responded that the Advisory Council has had as much involvement this time as it has had in the past; and in fact, it has had an opportunity to get better information as staff developed the 1997 Plan, particularly through the PM10 Task Force.  
<BR>Dr. Russ Sherwin was the official Advisory Council delegate to the PM10 Task Force, which has been meeting once to twice a month for nearly the last year and a half.  In addition to that, Advisory Council members Dr. Arthur Winer and Dr. Jane Hall have served on the Modeling Working Group for the AQMP and the Socio-Economic Task Force, respectively.  There were also a number of Advisory Council members that, while not formally appointed to the PM10 Task Force, were present at many of the task force meetings in the audience and had an opportunity to participate in that manner.
<P> Commenting that this matter should be formally placed on next month&#146;s Board meeting agenda so that any Advisory Council member, or any member of the public, can address the Board on this matter,
<P><blockquote>MR. BRAUDE MOVED TO PLACE ON THE SEPTEMBER 13, 1996 BOARD MEETING AGENDA AN ITEM REGARDING THE ADVISORY COUNCIL.  THE MOTION WAS DULY SECONDED, AND PASSED BY THE FOLLOWING VOTE:</blockquote>
<P>AYES: Antonovich, Braude, Haggard, Lee, Loveridge, Mikels, Paulitz, Soto and Wilson.
<P>NOES: Silva.
<P>ABSENT: Burke.
<P> Tim Carmichael, Coalition for Clean Air, addressed the Board and commented that the Coalition shares the Advisory Council&#146;s skepticism, frustration and concerns regarding the direction it believes AQMD has been heading in over the past two years to &quot;ease the burden on polluters&quot;, rather than acting in the interest of the AQMD&#146;s primary mission--protecting public health.
</ol><P></B>PUBLIC HEARINGS</B>

In addition, by tying the exemption to the reporting, if a manufacturer failed to provide the report within three months of the end of a year, then everyone with a container of that material would be held liable.  2) Recommended that the reporting requirement either be deleted from the exemption or simplified.
<P> Staff distributed to Board members an Addendum containing the following recommended modification to Subparagraph (f)(1) of PAR 1113:
<P><blockquote><I>&quot;(f)  Exemptions</I>
<p><blockquote><I>The provisions of this rule shall not apply to:</I>
<P><I>(1) architectural coatings in containers having capacities of one quart or less, </I><I>provided that the manufacturer </I><I><U>shall</U></I><I> submit</I><I><S>s</S></I><I> an annual report to the Executive </I><I>Officer within three months of the end of each calendar year.  The report shall </I><I><U>contain information as required by the Executive Officer to monitor the use of </U></I><I><U>the small container exemption</U></I><I>.</I><I><S> include for each exempt coating, the coating </S></I><I><S>name, coating category, the actual VOC content (grams per liter of coating </S></I><I><S>less water and exempt compounds and grams per liter of material), the </S></I><I><S>applicable VOC limit without the exemption, gallons sold in the District, and </S></I><I><S>excess emissions without the exemption for each category</S></I><I>.&quot;</I>
</blockquote></blockquote><P> With respect to the liability issue raised, General Counsel Peter Greenwald responded that it is not the intent of the AQMD to prosecute actions where there is no fault on the part of an individual.  He suggested adding the following sentence at the end of Subparagraph (f)(1) of 
<BR>PAR 1113:
<P><blockquote><I><U>&quot;The loss of exemption due to failure of the manufacturer to submit an annual report shall </U></I><I><U>only apply to the manufacturer.&quot;</U></I></blockquote>
<P> There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.

<P>BOARD MEETING DATE:  September 13, 1996  AGENDA NO. 10 </b></center>
<br><br><P><b>Proposal:</b><blockquote> Modify Employee Relations Agreements Pertaining to Management and Confidential Employees</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> Benefits for management employees have not been reviewed for the past three and one-half years, and confidential employees have had no review for two years.  A recent study indicates that benefits should be modified.</blockquote>
<P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote> Administrative, August 23, 1996, Recommended for Approval
</blockquote><P><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>Approve changes relating to benefits of management and confidential employees, included as Attachments A&amp;B.
</blockquote><P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br> Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Management and confidential employees are not represented by a union.  It has been the practice of the Board to annually review salaries and benefits for these employees near the beginning of the fiscal year.  Such review for management employees has not occurred since January 1993.  For confidential employees, the last review was in January of 1995 at which time the Board approved a four percent salary increase.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Revise benefits for management and confidential employees to provide a greater range of options.  These revisions would reaffirm the Board&#146;s recognition of staff accomplishments in a significant but cost-conscious manner.  The revisions, described in Attachments A and B, include the following:
<P><ul><li> Replace the existing mental health insurance program with a long-term disability insurance plan.  
<li> Revise the amount of accrued vacation leave that may be sold back annually to an additional twenty hours for management employees and four hours for confidential employees, to a total of sixty hours per year for each class of employees.
<li> Revise the annual reimbursement for required bar affiliation for attorneys from $300 to $478.  
<li> Allow management employees to carry over their $300-per-year allowance toward a physical examination for up to three years, to allow a maximum of $600 for biennial examinations or $900 for triennial examinations.
</ul><P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>If approved, these changes would be effective October 1, 1996.  The estimated annual cost of the recommended changes in management and confidential employee benefits is approximately $4,201.  The cost includes $1,531 per year to substitute long-term disability insurance for the existing mental health coverage for all management and confidential employees and $2,670 per year to increase annual reimbursement to attorneys for required bar affiliation.  No additional appropriation is requested as part of this recommendation, as there are sufficient funds allocated in the approved FY 1996-97 budget.

<P>BOARD MEETING DATE:   September 13, 1996 AGENDA NO. 11</b></center>
<br><br><P><b>Proposal:</b><blockquote> Issue RFP to Provide Temporary Engineering Services</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> Programs such as amnesty and Title V increase the number of applications to be processed beyond the normal workload.  To respond to these temporary workload &quot;spikes&quot; it is necessary to hire outside engineering services.  One or more contractors will be selected to assist in processing permits and provide services as needed.

<P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote>Administrative, August 23, 1996, Recommended for Approval</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>1. Reallocate $200,000 in the FY 1996-97 budget for SSC&#146;s Professional and Special Services from its Trading and Compliance Administration account to its Permit Processing Assistance account.
<P>2. Approve the release of RFP #9697-09 entitled &quot;Request for Proposals for Engineering Services.&quot;
</blockquote><P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br>Executive Officer
<P><hr><p>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Programs like amnesty and Title V federal operating permits increase the number of permit applications that need to be processed beyond the normal workload.  In order to effectively respond to these temporary workload &quot;spikes&quot; and still maintain the permit processing time frames of 7, 30, and 180 days, it is necessary to augment existing staff resources with outside engineering services.  Given that these outside engineering services will be used for <U>temporary</U> increases in work, it makes sense to contract additional resources rather than hire new staff.
<P><U>Scope and Purpose of Contract</U> -Through the attached RFP, the AQMD seeks to competitively select one or more companies to provide engineering services on an as-needed basis.  Under the direction of the AQMD, the contractor(s) will process permits according to AQMD rules and administrative processes and perform other related engineering tasks necessary to support permit processing activities.  
<P>Companies selected as a result of this RFP process will remain pre-qualified for a period of two years.  As the need arises, AQMD staff will issue a firm fixed-price task order or time-and-materials task order to the company(ies) to perform permitting-related work.  This bidding and pre-qualification process will ensure that the AQMD can quickly obtain engineering services to adequately respond to a workload &quot;spike&quot; in the most cost-effective manner.
<P><U>Selection Process</U> - Upon the Board&#146;s approval, AQMD staff will distribute the attached RFP and evaluate the proposals received.  The evaluation will be based on Board-approved guidelines and include technical merit and previous experience; minority- or female-owned business standing; and, cost- and time-effectiveness.
<P>AQMD staff will advertise this RFP in the following publications:
<P><I>California State Contracts Register, Eastern Group Publications, El Chicano, Hispanic </I><I>News, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, La Opinion, La Voz, Los Angeles Sentinel, Los </I><I>Angeles Times, M/W/DVBE Source, Orange County Register, Precinct Reporter, Rafu </I><I>Shimpo, Riverside Press-Enterprise, San Bernardino Sun, The Black Voice News, Korea </I><I>Central Daily, Philippine News, Inland Empire Hispanic News, Chinese News and The </I><I>Excelsior.</I>
<P>Copies of the RFPs will be sent to the Black and Latino Legislative Caucuses and interested minority contractors/professional associations and vendors listed in the Los Angeles County, MTA, Cal Trans, and Inland Area MBE/WBE directories.  Further, the RFPs will be placed on the AQMD&#146;s Internet home page and bidders&#146; 24-hour telephone message line.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>The Board action includes reallocating $200,000 from the Stationary Source Compliance Trading and Compliance Administration account to its Permit Processing Assistance account.  This will not increase the AQMD&#146;s overall 1996-97 budget or SSC&#146;s contract budget.

<P><br><br><b>Proposal:</b><blockquote> Issue an RFP for Investment Consultant Services</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> Board action on April 12, 1996 approved a recommendation to minimize AQMD investments in the Los Angeles County Pooled Surplus Investment Portfolio (PSIP) by directing staff to work with the Los Angeles County Treasurer (AQMD&#146;s Treasurer) to make specific investments on behalf of the AQMD.  This recommended action included the use of  outside investment consultant services to assist in the development of an AQMD Investment Policy and Guidelines and to provide investment monitoring and compliance reporting services. </blockquote>
<P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote> Investment Oversight, August 2, 1996, Administrative, August 23, 1996 </blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>Approve the issuance of RFP #9697-07 entitled &quot;Request for Proposals for Investment Consultant Services.&quot;</blockquote>
<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br> Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<B>Background</B><p>The Governing Board, based on an extensive review of the AQMD treasury management operations and the risk and benefits associated with investing in a commingled county investment pool, has directed staff to work with the County to reallocate a significant portion of its short-term investments from the County&#146;s commingled Pooled Surplus Investment Portfolio (PSIP) into its non-commingled Special Purpose Investment Portfolio (SPIP) and into the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) managed by the State Treasurer.  To implement and monitor this change in investment policy, the Board approved the recommendation to utilize outside investment consultant services.

<p><B>Proposal</B><p>
Through the attached RFP, the AQMD is seeking to competitively bid for investment consultant services.  The result will be a staff recommendation to select a firm to assist in the development and annual update of the AQMD Investment Policy and Guidelines; advise staff on short-term investment strategies available to the AQMD through its Treasurer, the County of Los Angeles; and provide investment monitoring and reporting services to the AQMD to ensure compliance with its investment policies.  These services are for a period of three years.
<p>Staff will develop a public service announcement advertising the RFP on local radio stations and will advertise this RFP in the following publications:<p>
<I>California State Contracts Register, Eastern Group Publications, El Chicano, </I><I>Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, La Opinion, La Voz, Los Angeles Sentinel, Los </I><I>Angeles Times, M/W/DVBE Source, Orange County Register, Precinct Reporter, </I><I>Rafu Shimpo, Riverside Press-Enterprise, San Bernardino Sun, The Black Voice </I><I>News, The Excelsior, Inland Empire Hispanic News, Chinese Daily News, Korean </I><I>Central Daily, and Philippine News.</I>

<p>Copies of the RFP will be sent to the Black and Latino Legislative Caucuses and interested minority contractors/professional associations and vendors listed in the Los Angeles County, MTA, Cal Trans, and Inland Area MBE/WBE directories.  Further, the RFP will be placed on the AQMD&#146;s Internet and bidders&#146; 24-hour telephone message line.

<br>   Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Pursuant to Section 44247 of the Health and Safety Code, which was enacted by AB 2766 and AB 434, and Section 42311.1 of the Health and Safety Code, which require CARB to provide data and analyses for inclusion in a report to be submitted to the governor and the legislature, staff prepared a report in April 1996 to CARB on the AB 2766 Program for Fiscal Year 1994-95.  The report contained information requested by CARB regarding two of the three segments of the AB 2766 Program.  Sections A, B and C reported on the District&#146;s use of AB 2766 funds for its own air pollution reduction programs (30% of the funds).  Section D, part 1 and Section E, part 1 reported on the Discretionary Fund Program (30% of the funds) and the cost-effectiveness of Discretionary Fund projects.  These were approved at the May 12, 1996 AQMD Governing Board meeting.
<P>The report on part three of the AB 2766 funds -- the funds disbursed to cities and counties -- was delayed due to changes in reporting timelines and procedures mutually agreed upon by CARB, the AQMD and the affected cities and counties.
<P><B>Summary of Report</B>
<P>The third and final section of the report (Section D, part 2 and Section E, part 2 - Subvention to Cities and Counties), is submitted as an Addendum to the original report.  The established AB 2766 Audit and Reporting Guidelines, require subvention fund recipients (local governments) to submit a report, each year regarding their use of these funds for the prior fiscal year.  While the guidelines require local governments to submit their report by March 1, changes in reporting procedures for FY 94-95 have delayed this year&#146;s report.
<P>During Fiscal Year 1994-95, slightly more than $15 million in vehicle registration fees were received for use by local governments participating in the subvention fund program (40% of the total AB 2766 funds collected).  The attached Addendum contains information on the amount of funds expended by Local Government subvention fund participants by program categories as established by CARB.
<P><B>Attachments</B>
<br>Section D - Part 2
<br>Report on the Local Government Subvention Program (40% of the funds).
<br>Section E - Part 2
<br>Report on the Cost-effectiveness of Local Government Subvention Projects.
<p><B>Due to the bulk of the attachments, they will be provided to  Governing Board members only.  Copies will be available for review in the District&#146;s Library and the Public Information Center and are not included with this letter or on the Internet.</B>

<br><br><P><b>Report:</b><blockquote> Summary of Board-approved and Executive Officer-Approved Changes to the FY 1995-96 Approved Budget</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote>  State law enacted in 1994, Health and Safety Code Section 40721, provides that the CARB, in consultation with Cal-EPA, review and comment on the AQMD&#146;s three-year budget forecast.  The Three-Year Budget Forecast for FYs 1995-96, 1996-97, and 1997-98 was the first such three-year forcast submitted for review.  One recommendation resulting from that review was to report periodically on changes to the approved budget.  This report covers the period July 1, 1995 through June 30, 1996.</blockquote>
<P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote> Not applicable.</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>Receive and file the attached Summary of Board-approved and Executive Officer-approved changes to the FY 1995-96 Approved Budget.</blockquote>

<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Health and Safety Code Section 40271 (enacted in 1994) provides that CARB, in consultation with Cal-EPA, review and comment on the South Coast AQMD&#146;s Three-Year Budget Forecast.  As part of that review, CARB recommended that contract activity be reported periodically to the Board.  The attached report is divided into four categories:  New Awards, Other, Sponsorships, and Amendments.  Within each category, contract type is specified and within each type, level of approval is indicated.  The greatest number of FY 1995-96 contract actions were Amendments (40%), followed by New Awards (38%), Other (13%) and Sponsorships (9%).  The Governing Board approved 75 contracts and amendments totaling $10,743,354; the Executive Officer approved 202 contracts and amendments totaling $2,259,659.  A total of 277 contracts and amendments were awarded totaling $13,002,998.

<P>      Mayor John Longville
<br>      Chair, Mobile Source Air     Pollution Reduction Review Committee
<P><hr>

<P><B>Background</B></P>
<P>As part of the FY 1995-97 AB 2766 Fund Work Program, the MSRC developed a $7 million Zero-Emission Vehicle &#147;Quick Charge&#148; Program, which included three components, as indicated below:</P>
<P><table><tr> <td>--RFP for Outreach Coordinator<td>     $175,000
<tr><td> --RFP for Electric Vehicle Corridor<td>    $825,000
<tr><td> Communities Program Workplan --Request for Qualifications for    $5,000 Manufacturers Buydown Incentive  <td><U>$6,000,000</U>

<tr><td> Total<td>       <U>$7,000,000</U></table>
<P>On November 9, 1995, the Governing Board approved the appointment of the Planning Center as the Outreach Coordinator for an 18-month appointment.  On March 8, 1996, the Governing Board approved the RFP for the EV Corridor Communities Program, and the seven proposals received in response to this RFP are currently being evaluated.  In December 1995 the final component, the draft RFQ for the buydown incentive, was provided to the Board as part of the FY 1995-97 Work Program.  This manufacturers&#146; incentive is intended to assist consumers in purchasing or leasing EVs by offering a $5,000 buydown off the price of the vehicle when sold or leased within the South Coast District by a qualified manufacturer.</P>
<P><B>Bid Evaluation</B></P>
<P>The MSRC formed an EV Subcommittee to develop and define the ZEV &#147;Quick Charge&#148; Program.  As part of its role, the EV Subcommittee, assisted by TAO staff and the MSRC&#146;s Technical Consultant and Outreach Coordinator, held a series of workshops for manufacturers, utilities and local governments desirious of participating in the ZEV &#147;Quick Charge&#148; Program.  These workshops were designed to solicit comments on the Community Corridor and Manufacturer Incentive Programs before issuance of the final RFP and RFQ.  </P>
<P>In December 1996, following these workshops, the final RFQ for the $5,000 manufacturers buydown incentive was provided to the Board and released to interested parties.  The intent of the RFP is to identify manufacturers with the parts, knowledge, training, technical ability and service capability to participate in a pilot-demonstration of 1998-style EVs in the South Coast District.  Manufacturers may submit their qualifications packages through July 1, 1997.  The earliest release of incentive funding will be October 1, 1996, for EVs delivered to the consumer after July 1, 1996.   A manufacturer would receive funding for the consumer incentive directly, which would be used to buydown the manufacturer suggested retail price of a qualified EV.  This buydown will be reimbursed on a quarterly basis to each qualified manufacturer and based solely upon the number of vehicles sold or leased during the previous quarter.  </P>
<P>GM Corporation was the first manufacturer to submit a qualifications package that meets the RFQ requirements.  On August 22, 1996, the MSRC considered GM&#146;s participation in the program and unanimously approved GM as a qualified manufacturer for participation.  The MSRC requests that the AQMD Governing Board approve GM as a qualified manufacturer in the program and authorize the Chairman of the Board to enter into a letter agreement with GM Corporation as a qualified manufacturer in this program.  It is anticipated that GM will place its EV-1 at its Saturn dealers sometime in the Fall.  Vehicle specifications for GM&#146;s EV-1 are attached for your information.  </P>
<P>In addition, it is anticipated that other manufacturers will submit qualifications packages for consideration.  To avoid any delays in the program, the MSRC requests that the AQMD Governing Board authorize the Committee to approve future qualified manufacturers for participation in this program and authorize the Chairman of the Board to enter into letters of agreement with future qualified manufacturers as determined by the MSRC as part of the FY 1995-97 AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Work Program.</P>
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B></P>
<P>The AQMD acts as administrator to the AB 2766 Program, and money received for the AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Program is recorded in a special revenue fund.  Since the contracts will be drawn from this special fund, there would be no fiscal impact on the AQMD&#146;s operational budget.</P>

<li> Add a Designated Deputy position to serve as Deputy Executive Officer for the Office;
<li> Create the Local Government &amp; Small Business Assistance Committee;

</blockquote>
<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br> Executive Officer
<p><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The AQMD&#146;s public outreach efforts were the subject of two bills introduced in the recently-concluded Legislative session.  During negotiations to offer administrative alternatives in lieu of the legislation, the AQMD made a number of suggestions to address Legislators&#146; concerns.  
<P>At its June meeting, the Governing Board conditionally approved a proposal to take several actions administratively in response to and in lieu of AB 3248 (Napolitano).  These actions included:  (1) the establishment of an Office of Public Affairs &amp; Local Government Assistance and a Designated Deputy position to serve as Deputy Executive Officer for that Office for the purpose of enhancing the AQMD&#146;s outreach and small business and local government assistance; (2) the establishment of a Local Government and Small Business Assistance Committee; and (3) the conducting of a Legislative Summit.  Concurrently, the AQMD proposed to Assemblywoman Martha Escutia to take several actions administratively in lieu of proposed legislation outlined in her AB 3206, which the Assemblywoman accepted.  These actions complement those envisioned by AB 3248 and include:  (1) enter into a Small Business Outreach Pilot Program (three components were suggested and have since been expanded upon: a Clean Air Ambassador Program; Focus Groups, a Community Fair; or some combination of these; and (2) establish a policy regarding performance objectives.
<P>This Board letter addresses AQMD&#146;s commitments regarding these issues.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P><ol><li> Establish an Office of Public Affairs &amp; Local Government Assistance (PA &amp; LGA) and a Designated Deputy position to serve as a Deputy Executive Officer to administer the responsibilities of said Office.  
<BR>
<BR>The responsibilities of the Office are to:
<P>a) Directly apprise the Governing Board of business, environmental, and community concerns;
<br>b) Provide local government assistance and public outreach;
<br>c) Manage the AQMD&#146;s business retention efforts;
<br>d) Provide input during rule development regarding public affairs and small business assistance;
<br>e) Review AQMD&#146;s procedures and programs for impacts on small business and local government;
<br>f) Provide notice to the public of all proceedings of the Governing Board and the Hearing Board;
<br>g) Provide advice on and facilitate public participation;
<br>h) Facilitate requests for public records;
<br>i) Recommend measures to enhance public participation;
<br>j) Report on significant issues regarding fee impacts on small business and local government;
<br>k) Provide assistance in obtaining financing for air pollution reduction and pollution control equipment;
<br>l) Provide staffing to the Local Government and Small Business Assistance Committee.
<P>The responsibilities of the Designated Deputy are to:
<P>a) Administer the Office of Public Affairs &amp; Local Government Assistance;
<br>b) Serve as liaison and ombudsman for small business and local government assistance;
<br>c) Serve on the Executive Council of top management staff;
<br>d) Chair the Fee Review Committee; and
<br>e) Provide information concerning business, environmental, and community concerns directly to the Governing Board. 
<p><li> Create a Local Government and Small Business Assistance Committee whose members shall be appointed by the Chairman of the AQMD Board as follows:  fifteen individuals consisting of four local government elected officials, three AQMD Board Members, four small business representatives, and four members of the general public.  This Committee would have the responsibility to review and make recommendations regarding:
<br>a) public outreach activities related to the impacts of existing and proposed regulations on small business and local government;
<br>b) source education;
<br>c) small business loan and assistance programs;
<br>d) draft rules; and 
<br>e) a policy for first-time offenders -- a no penalty &#147;fix-it&#148; notice (Notice to Comply) unless violations are flagrant or intentional 
<p><li>Enhance the AQMD&#146;s Outreach Program
<p> a. <B>Convene an annual Legislative Summit</B> to review progress in reducing emissions and assessing the impacts on local communities and the economy; and to develop policy recommendations on the allocation of AB2766 funds and their use by cities in mobile source reduction programs.  Invitees would include all local elected officials, state legislators, and Members of Congress within the AQMD jurisdiction, the Southern California business community, and the public.  <I>Staff has already begun work on this event which is tentatively </I><I>scheduled for January 31, 1997.</I> 
<p> b. <B>Establish a Small Business Outreach Pilot Program</B>.  Both Southern California&#146;s economic future and the health of generations to come depend on a  working partnership between the thousands of small business owners and the air quality agency.  These businesses are trying to serve their local community while making a decent living. At the same time, state and federal law  require that the air quality agency aggressively manage the clean-up of the air.  Control strategies are most effective in reducing pollution when they are understandable and inherently practical for businesses to implement.  Our rules must recognize the often precarious nature of small business survival.   This innovative pilot program will meaningfully enhance the extent and effectiveness of the AQMD&#146;s Small Business outreach and education.
<P> The following three options for the enhanced small business outreach pilot program will be reviewed by the Local Government and Small Business Assistance Committee and one or more will be selected:
<P><B> </B><B>Option A - Clean Air Ambassadors:</B>  This pilot program would be built around a direct communication approach with AQMD &#147;Clean Air Ambassadors&#148; meeting individually with small business owners at their convenience and in their community to talk about air quality regulatory issues.  An area of the Basin would be selected and a ten-member team of AQMD Clean Air Ambassadors would contact one hundred regulated businesses in the designated area.  These meetings would be completely non-enforcement-related and would NOT involve any type of inspection or issuance of a Notice of Violation or even a Notice to Comply (essentially a &#147;fix-it&#148; notice).  The Clean Air Ambassador would look at equipment if the owner requests, but the only purpose of the meeting would be to discuss how AQMD can help the small business owner ensure that the business has no compliance problems and what actions the business owner could take to help improve air quality.  The meetings would serve as a forum for AQMD to explain how these businesses can best influence the development of control measures that will affect them in the future.   The Clean Air Ambassadors would be chosen for their understanding of small business operating principles and practices as well as their technical knowledge of pollution prevention techniques.  A majority of the ambassadors would have bilingual skills and an awareness of local community concerns. 
<P><B> </B><B>Option B - Focus Groups:  </B>This pilot program would use small discussion groups to help small business owners focus their concerns and develop recommendations.  This approach is commonly used by large corporations to test customer reactions to new products, services or marketing strategies.  A bilingual contractor with expertise in focus groups would be hired to train ten AQMD service representatives in operating focus groups.  At least ten focus group meetings would be held.  a community or group of communities in which a large number of small regulated businesses re located would be selected.  At each of the ten focus group meetings, ten local business owners would be invited to sit down and talk with the AQMD Service Representative.  The purpose would be to let AQMD know how best it can reach out to assist and educate small business owners how and why his or her business operation can impact air quality.  AQMD would include into its permanent outreach program the local business owners&#146; ideas that could help other local business owners.
<P><B> </B><B>Option C - Community Fair:  </B>This pilot program would be designed to bring small business assistance and regulatory relief to a targeted community area.  AQMD would hold a series of public workshops to seek input from small businesses of the advantages of instituting internal environmental audits to detect and correct violations.  Workshops would extend into the evening hours to enable business owners to attend without taking time away from their businesses.  The workshops also would seek opinions from small business owners/operators regarding their needs for technical information on pollution prevention techniques.  The workshops would further explain that qualifying for an exemption from permits and rules through institution of pollution prevention practices is often the easiest way to comply.  (The Sonoma Green program would be featured as an example of successful outreach efforts resulting in emission reductions and cooperative compliance.)  At the workshops, a team of from ten to twenty AQMD Service Representatives would be set up at individual tables to meet with small business owners to respond to their concerns, inform them of financial assistance available to help with the purpose of pollution control equipment, and provide any assistance they might need in working with the AQMD.  Each of the AQMD&#146;s Small Business Assistance programs would be graphically displayed.  Business owners could obtain, on the spot, the new streamlined facility registration to replace prior equipment permits.  For a company with more than one piece of equipment, this would eliminate permit fees on individual pieces of equipment and substitute one low fee for the facility.  The result is reduced costs for the small business owner.
<P> The Local Government and Small Business Assistance Committee will review the  proposed activities.  The Committee would help design the details of the selected pilot program, participate in its implementation, and evaluate the results.  A complete report would be presented to the Governing Board and included in the AQMD&#146;s Annual Report to the Legislature.
<BR>
<P><li> Establish a policy regarding performance objectives.  
<P>a) Near the beginning of each year the AQMD Governing Board will adopt performance objectives for the agency.  These objectives would be quantifiable and include programs that reach out, educate and successfully involve small business owners, legislators, ethnic communities, local governments and the public, in the development and implementation of AQMD policies, rules and regulations, and programs that result in the implementation of emission reduction strategies to comply with State and Federal legislative mandates for the coming year and fulfill clean air commitments outlined in the AQMP.  The objectives also would identify programs that achieve other management purposes such as meeting Affirmative Action goals, enhancing community outreach, developing new, consumer-friendly ways to clean up the air as required by law and seeking cost reductions for small business owners by a variety of means, including improving efficiency.
<p>
b) Near the beginning of each year, the Executive Officer will report to the Governing Board on the progress in meeting the Board&#146;s performance objectives and the Board will take public comment.
<p>
c) The Governing Board will hold an executive, closed session with the Executive Officer to review progress in meeting the agency&#146;s objectives and any public comments and to evaluate the Executive Officer&#146;s performance in meeting the agency&#146;s objectives.
<p>
d) The Governing Board retains the right to remove the Executive Officer without cause from his/her position.
</ol><P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>The salary and benefit cost associated with adding a designated deputy/deputy executive officer is approximately $125,000, depending on salary.  By previous Board action, the salary band for such positions is $63,778 to $119,200.  The Local Government &amp; Small Business Assistance Committee will require staff support estimated to be approximately $40,000 annually - comparable to that of other advisory committees. It is estimated that $20,000 in addition to that currently budgeted for outreach efforts  will be required to cover the additional costs associated with the Legislative Summit and the Small Business Outreach Pilot Program.  The total  cost for this proposal are estimated at $185,000.  Funds will be sought within the AQMD&#146;s present budget.  Staff assignments both within the Public Affairs office and outside of it will have to be modified to accomplish the enhanced outreach programs while operating within the AQMD&#146;s present budget constraints.

<P>The Rule Forecast Report presented to your Board each month outlines for the upcoming 18 months the anticipated meeting dates that staff will bring these control measures and additional rules forward for Board adoption.  The Rule Forecast Report is amended as necessary to reflect Board decisions regarding rule adoptions or when additional staff research or public consultations postpone proposed adoption hearing dates.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Two of the key items of interest in the report are:
<P><ul><li> Rule 219 - Equipment Not Requiring a Written Permit Pursuant to Regulation II
<P> Proposed amendments delete written permit requirements for equipment emitting negligible amounts of air contaminants.  The proposed amendments affect over 10,000 sources, and are scheduled for a Board hearing in December 1996.
<P><li> Regulation XXX - Title V Operating Permits and Rule 212 - Standards for Approving Permits
<P> Proposed amendments to Regulation XXX will incorporate changes made by EPA to better define the minimum elements of an approvable operating permit program.  Proposed amendments to Rule 212 will clarify public noticing requirements prior to permit issuance.  The Board hearing date is scheduled for January 1997.</ul>
<P>The AQMP hearing is scheduled for November, necessitating the movement of three rules which were scheduled to be heard in November:
<P><ul><li> Rule  1105.1 - Fluid Catalytic Cracking Units to March 1997.
<li> Rule 1145 - Plastic, Rubber &amp; Glass Coatings to January 1997.
<li> Rule 2506 - (formerly 2009) Area Source Credits to December 1996.</ul>
<P>The Air Quality Investment Program (AQIP) has been added in December.  To avoid overloading December, the following rules are being moved:
<P><ul><li>Rule 403 - Fugitive Dust to January 1997.
<li> Rule 1107 - Metal Products Coating to February 1997.
<li> Rule 1173 - Fugitive Emissions of VOC to February 1997.
<li>Rule 1186 - PM10 Emissions from Paved and Unpaved Roads and Livestock Operations to January 1997.</ul>

<P>Staff participated in the activities, programs and events listed below.  A statistical report of these activities also is included.
<P>Contact: La Ronda V. Bowen, Public Advisor, 909.396.3235
<P><B>BUSINESS OUTREACH</B>
<P><U>Permitting</U> - AQMD staff have been working closely with Stationary Source Compliance to determine possible types of equipment that could be excluded from the permitting requirements or converted to simplified registrations.
<P><U>General Assistance</U>
<P>During July, a higher than usual number of companies contacted Public Advisor for specific regulatory assistance.  No identifiable trends emerged in terms of issues.  Increased use of this office may have been due to media or legislative activity.
<P><B>COMMUNITY OUTREACH</B>
<P><U>Open Airways Project</U> - AQMD staff made the first of what are to be a series of presentations on air pollution and health to community health-based organizations through the American Lung Association of Los Angeles County&#146;s Open Airways Project. Staff addressed a group of nurses at Glendale Adventist Hospital on Wednesday, July 31 and provided information kits to the approximately 30 staff members in attendance. Open Airways is designed to increase the level of public awareness about the factors contributing to asthma, allergies and other respiratory diseases, such as particle pollution, second-hand smoke, mold and dust mites. Included in the air quality information kit were brochures on smog and health, maps, PSI charts, publications on dust advisories and the changes to Regulation VII involving notification of schools and recreational facilities when episodes and health advisories are forecast. Glendale Adventist nurses are working with administrators of the Glendale Unified School District as part of the Open Airways program.
<P><U>CARB Mobile Source Testing Program</U> - The California Air Resources Board&#146;s Mobile Source Division has launched a year-long program targeting 4,000 vehicles whose drivers are willing to voluntarily have them tested for emissions at sites throughout the state.  AQMD staff has assisted with this outreach effort by providing educational literature at the testing points within our district. These include 25 Ways You Can Clean The Air, Driver&#146;s Guide to Clean Air and Smogbusters coloring books and activity books.
<P><U>Visiting Dignitaries</U> - A four-member delegation from the Korean Land Corporation met on July 3, 1996 with Planning and Stationary Source compliance staffs on environmental impact assessment.  An eight-member delegation from Korea&#146;s Ministry of Environment met on July 3, 1996 with Stationary Source Compliance staff on market-based and command-and-control applications to air pollution control.  Zaman Zulkifli of Malaysia&#146;s Engineering Division, Ministry of Health, met with Public Advisor staff for a general overview of AQMD&#146;s programs, then with Technology Advancement staff on health-related issues; and Stationary Source Compliance staff on urban sanitation issues.  Juan Martinez Sanchez of Spain&#146;s Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Environment, met with Public Advisor staff for a general overview and with Stationary Source Compliance staff on RECLAIM and the bubble concept of permitting.  A 12-member group from the Thailand Bureau of Environmental Protection met with Stationary Source Compliance and Applied Science and Technology on inspections, source testing and laboratory analysis.  Aik Beng Lee of Singapore&#146;s Ministry of Environment met with Planning and Stationary Source Compliance staffs on regional modeling and environmental impact assessment.
<P>Two foreign delegations have made plans to visit the District during the month of August: A delegation from the government of Thailand will visit on Tuesday, August 13, to meet with Stationary Source Compliance and Applied Science and Technology staffs on ambient air monitoring, field inspections, source testing and laboratory analysis; and a Korean delegation hosted by Cal Poly Pomona will meet with Public Advisor staff the afternoon of Friday, August 16, for a general overview of our programs and a tour of our headquarters.
<P><U>Intergovernmental/Agency</U> 
<P>Public Advisor met with US Congressman &#147;Buck&#148; McKeon and a delegation from Germany to discuss how environmental regulations, business growth and legislation work together to benefit citizens.
<P>Under Public Advisor interoffice cross-training initiative, Economic Development Business Retention staff was assigned to coordinate AQMD participation in air quality information display at Assemblywoman Napolitano&#146;s Trade Conference.

<P><B><U>Ontario Permit Assistance Center</U></B>
<P>The Ontario Permit Assistance Center moved to 2151 East &#147;D&#148; Street, Suite 203A together with the Ontario Chamber of Commerce.  The new center is unique in that it includes staff from the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, the Small Business Development Center (SBDC), the Senior Core of Retired Executives (SCORE), and the California Manufacturers Technology Center (CMTC).  SCORE and SBDC offer both start-up and existing businesses assistance at many levels.  CMTC&#146;s mission is to help businesses improve productivity and assist them with their ISO 9000 certification.  Overall this alliance will enable small, medium and large-sized businesses to seek and obtain a variety of general, technical and financial business assistance programs at one location.  
<P>The center provides a comprehensive permit referral service, provides inter-agency permit consultation, and documents problem areas that businesses have with various agencies.  The San Bernardino County Hazardous Materials Division, EPA Region IX Department of Toxic Substance Control, and SCAQMD staff the office on a part-time basis.  They also have one full-time staff person from the Department of Forestry and two administrative staff.  Outreach for the center is expected to commence in September.  We are hopeful that many of our clients will make good use of this center. 
<P><B><U>Autobody Shops</U></B>
<P>An intensive effort is on-going to team with interested automotive paint distributors to educate their business clients on cost-effective means of compliance.  
<P>This month, we met with two automotive paint distributors in Orange County and discussed Rules 1151, 1171, and 1107.   We will be going with them to visit some of their customers&#146; shops to discuss pending compliance issues.
<P>SBAO staff met with  Annex Automotive Paints (auto body paint distributor) sales staff at their weekly sales meeting in Montebello.  We discussed current problems they and their customers are having in complying with Rule 1151.  We also discussed the applicability of Rules 1107 &amp; 1171 to the autobody industry.   We advised them that SBAO is available to help their clients with permits and rules.  They have about 1,000 customers in the areas covered by their three stores in San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles, and Walnut.
<P>SBAO staff recently completed a one-page &#147;pilot&#148; PLAIN ENGLISH compliance checklist for autobody shops.  We have tried  it out on some shops for their reactions on readability, usefulness, and simplicity.   Soon we will have a final draft which can be translated into Spanish, Korean, etc.
<P>A number of special projects are underway to improve our communications with many small businesses:
<P><ul><li> Bi-lingual brochure on the loan guaranty program;
<li> Special Spanish language &#147;hotline&#148; sticker to attach to mailed documents;
<li> Special communication courtesy card to send to our clients;
<li> A re-designed and reformatted 400A permit application guidelines into plain English;
<li> Proposal for internal technical communication network;
<li> Prototype interactive Special Interest Group area for small businesses on the WEB site;
<li> Small Business Web page;
<li> Training of  entire SBAO staff in AQAF policies and operating procedures;
<li> Implementation of 800 line rotating call recovery.</ul>

<P><B><U>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT &amp; BUSINESS RETENTION (EDBR) ACTIVITIES</U></B>
<P>Highlights of the activities conducted during this reporting period are described below.
<P>Contact:<blockquote> La Ronda Bowen, Public Advisor, (909) 396 -3235
<br> Larry Watkins, EDBR, (909) 396 - 3246
<br> Roberta Rigg, EDBR, (909) 396 - 2659.</blockquote>
<P><B>ACTIVITIES</B>
<P>Activities during this reporting period included participation in 4 Red Team meetings with Rockwell Space Systems, M&amp;M Tooling, an aircraft manufacturer (confidential) and a follow-up meeting with CPC International and 12 community outreach projects.  Assistance was provided to various facilities wanting to expand or consolidate their operations.  Companies were informed of emerging new pollution reduction technologies as well as technology transfer opportunities.  EDBR staff also participated in 3 different public outreach meetings by making presentations and providing information to interested parties.  The total number of participants reached through these 3 meetings exceeds 200 people.
<P> Open Items (business development and retention efforts in process)  36
<br> Completed Items (decision to stay, expand, etc.)       6
<br>  (This represents 400 jobs/jobs retained in California)
<br> Outreach and meetings with companies      16
<P><B>ASSEMBLYMEMBER NAPOLITANO&#146;S INTERNATIONAL TRADE CONFERENCE</B>
<P>Staff provided input to the planning of Assemblymember Napolitano&#146;s International Trade Conference on the Pacific Rim and the Americas.  Outreach effort involved a number of southland businesses and foreign trade organizations.  This is the second year of the conference and it is estimated that approximately 1200 people will attend.  Staff will maintain a table top display for the dissemination of AQMD Economic Development/Business Retention and Small Business program information.
<P><B>AIRPLANE MANUFACTURER (CONFIDENTIAL)</B>
<P>A Red Team meeting was held to discuss a proposal advanced by a major airplane manufacturer for the installation of a paint booth.  A paint booth in this case is actually an airplane hanger that acts like a paint booth.  Based on information gathered, this could create an additional 300 jobs and approximately $20 million of investment capital.  
<P><B>BOEING SEA LAUNCH</B>
<P>Staff met with the Boeing Company some months ago to review their plans for siting a new space vehicle launch preparation facility.  At the time it could not be reported to the Board since it was highly confidential and discussion might have ruined the negotiation leverage for a lease.  Subsequently, a sixteen acre parcel,  located in Long Beach, has been acquired by the Boeing Company and companies from Norway, Ukraine and  Russia.  The five company consortium&#146;s concept is quite exciting in that Boeing will use Zenit missiles to launch communication satellites into earth orbits from a platform 1,000 miles south of the Hawaiian Islands.  These Russian made missiles are touted as the most reliable made.  They have been decommissioned and converted for peace time use by the consortium.  They expect between 11-13 launches per year with 228 jobs being created.  AQMD will assist in permitting storage tanks and control equipment and will be available for any future expansions.
<P><B>ROCKWELL SPACE SYSTEMS</B>
<P>A Red Team met to discuss with Rockwell a proposal to NASA for the landing, outfitting and modification of all space shuttle launches at the Rockwell, Palmdale facility.  As a side note, this facility and several other facilities was just purchased by Boeing.  The concept is to create 1,000 jobs in the Palmdale area as well as use the  900-1,100 employees in the Downey area for modification and retrofitting of all space shuttle flights.  This would probably save NASA between $5-7 million hard dollars per year.  Staff was involved in devising cost cutting measures and  technology transfer with respect to compliant coatings and paints that will meet the stringent performance requirements of NASA and the space shuttle missions.

<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> This report provides for the Board&#146;s consideration a listing of CEQA documents received by the AQMD between July 2, 1996 and August 1, 1996, and those projects for which the AQMD is acting as lead agency pursuant to CEQA.</blockquote>

<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br> Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P><B>EIR and Document Log (Attachments A and B)</B> - Each month, the AQMD receives numerous CEQA documents from other public agencies on projects which could adversely affect air quality.  A listing of all documents received for review during the past month is contained in Attachment A.  Monthly listings which are shaded note those CEQA documents for which the AQMD staff has or will prepare and submit comments to the lead agency.  A list of active projects from previous months for which AQMD staff is continuing to evaluate or prepare comments is included as Attachment B.  The column captioned &quot;Public Concerns&quot; identifies parties who have contacted the AQMD with concerns or issues about the proposed project.  A notation of 1 in this column indicates the contact was supportive of the project noted.  A notation of 2 indicates the party was opposed or expressed concerns about the project.  A notation of 3 indicates that no one contacted the AQMD about that project.
<P>In the past, AQMD staff routinely reviewed many of these documents and commented upon the air quality analyses and possible impacts on the air quality of the district.  Due to staffing constraints, the AQMD is no longer able to routinely comment on all CEQA documents received.  Publication of the Board-approved <I>CEQA Air</I> <I>Quality Handbook</I>, however, has provided local governments and other public agencies with the necessary information to prepare appropriate air quality analyses on projects for which they act as lead agency.  As resources permit, staff evaluates and may prepare comments for projects that may have significant adverse regional air quality impacts (e.g., special event centers, landfills, etc.) and those projects for which a lead or responsible agency has specifically requested AQMD review.
<P><B>AQMD Lead Agency Projects (Attachment C)</B> - Pursuant to CEQA, the AQMD periodically acts as lead agency on stationary source permit projects.  Under CEQA the lead agency is responsible for determining whether an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) or a Negative Declaration is necessary for any proposal considered to be a &quot;project&quot; as defined by CEQA.  An EIR is prepared when the AQMD as lead agency finds substantial evidence that the proposed project may have a significant adverse effect on the environment.  A Negative Declaration may be prepared if the AQMD determines that the proposed project will not generate significant adverse environmental impacts.  The Negative Declaration is a written statement describing the reasons a proposed project will not have a significant adverse effect on the environment and, therefore, does not require the preparation of an EIR.
<P>Attachment C to this report summarizes the active projects for which the AQMD is lead agency and is currently preparing or has prepared environmental documentation.  As noted in Attachment C, during July 1996, the AQMD certified the CEQA documents for two (2) projects, continued working on CEQA documents for four (4) active projects.
<P>To date in 1996, the AQMD, as lead agency, prepared or contracted for the preparation of and certified three (3) CEQA documents.

<P> *Joint Demonstration
<P> In addition to the demonstrations, Stuart Jenkins of EEMCO and Gerry Smith of Charles Cain Co., suppliers of aqueous cleaning materials, commented relative to their products.  Comments on proposed amendments to Rule 1171 also were received from Mike Carroll of Latham &amp; Watkins (representing Safety-Kleen).  Mr. Carroll raised several items of concern in the AQMD staff report, including the emissions inventory for solvent cleaning processes, the cost figures and the assumed size of the current aqueous market, the assumption that equipment can be retrofitted to accommodate aqueous cleaners, and the potential for adverse water quality impacts.  He also pointed out that Safety-Kleen is not opposed to the use of aqueous cleaners.  A meeting summary of the demonstrations and comments on Proposed Amended Rule 1171 will be made a part of the administrative record and will be available on request.  Demonstrations will be repeated in the lobby of the AQMD on September 13, 1996, for viewing by the entire Governing Board and the public.</P>
<P>3. <B>Rule 1176 - Sumps and Wastewater Separators</B></P>
<P><B> </B>Mohsen Nazemi gave a brief presentation on Rule 1176 amendments.  He explained that the proposed amendments will extend the VOC emission standards to all emission sources within a facility&#146;s wastewater system, which includes junction boxes and manhole covers.  He further explained that the monitoring and inspection frequency is also being reduced for sources with low emission potentials, to allow focusing of industry resources on sources with high emission potentials.  Mr. Ron Wilkniss of Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA) provided public comments, which the AQMD may have already resolved since the set hearing package was released.  However, WSPA feels that additional testing is required from junction boxes.  Mohsen indicated that the rule does not require control of all junction boxes, but only those, if any, which repeatedly exceed the emission standards.  Ron indicated that WSPA will reserve their final comments on the rule until they review the latest rule language changes.</P>

<P>      Leonard Paulitz, Chairman
<br>      Technology Committee
<P><hr>
<P><B>Committee Topics</B>
<P><B>1. Execute Contracts and Amend Contracts with CE-CERT</B>
<P> In the FY 1996-97 Budget, $700,000 is identified for CE-CERT to conduct several technology advancement projects:  (1) Measurement of Primary Particulate Matter Emissions from Light-Duty Motor Vehicles; (2) Smoking Vehicle Project, Medium-Duty Diesel Trucks; (3) Inventory of AFVs &amp; AFV Comparison, OEM vs. Retrofits; (4) Development of Advanced Low-Emitting Propane Fueled Vehicle; (5) Operation &amp; Improvement of the Solar Hydrogen Facility; (6) Phase III of the Gasoline Composition Study; and (7) Smog Chamber Evaluation of AFV Emissions.  <I>The Committee reviewed </I><I>the information presented and noted their approval of staff&#146;s recommendation.</I>
<P><B>2.  Purchase and/or Lease of Zero-Emission Vehicles</B>
<P> As part of the Memorandum of Agreement with ARB, major automotive manufacturers will commercially offer electric vehicles in limited numbers in fall 1996.  Upon approval, two original equipment manufacturer (OEM) electric vehicles will be procured for the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Lease Program.  Total cost to the AQMD will not exceed $89,000.  The proposed vehicles will be the first OEM electric vehicles in the Lease Program.  Purchases of methanol and CNG vehicles and electric bikes were last approved by the Board in April 1996.  <I>The Committee asked that this item be held for </I><I>further review pending negotiations for a more favorable monetary arrangement with the </I><I>automobile companies.</I>
<P><B>3.  Amend Contract with Thermo Power Corporation for the Development and </B><B>Demonstration of a Natural Gas Retrofit Kit for Heavy-Duty Engines</B>
<P> At its May 12, 1995 meeting, the Board authorized the Chairman to execute an agreement for $156,755 with Thermo Power Corporation for development and demonstration of a natural gas retrofit kit for heavy-duty engines.  The proposed amendment will provide for software and hardware upgrades to the retrofit kit to further improve vehicle performance and optimize emissions.  These upgrades will be applied to the demonstration vehicles.  Total amount of the amendment is $45,279, making the total contract amount $202,034.  <I>The Committee reviewed the information presented and noted </I><I>their approval of staff&#146;s recommendation.</I>
<P> <B>4. Execute a Contract to Cost-Share the Development and Demonstration of an Electric Water Delivery Truck</B>
<P> On April 12, 1996, the Board approved executing a contract with McKesson Water Products (Sparkletts) for the development and demonstration of an electric water delivery truck.  Due to delays by McKesson concerning contractual issues, this contract could not be executed in FY 1995-96.  These issues are under discussion and are expected to be resolved shortly.  This action is to secure Board re-authorization to execute this contract.  The proposed project cost is $377,000, of which AQMD would cost-share in an amount not to exceed $175,000.  <I>The Committee reviewed the </I><I>information presented and noted their approval of staff&#146;s recommendation.</I>
<P><B>5. Update on Fuel Cell Implementation Task Force</B>
<P> Jon Leonard of Technology Advancement presented announced that the next meeting of the Renewable Energy/Fuel Cell Implementation Task Force will be September 10, 1996 from 9:00 to 4:30 p.m. at the AQMD.  He also reported that the Ballard Fuel Cell Bus will be available for viewing at the next Technology Committee meeting, September 27, 1996.  Ballard will give a technical presentation at this time.  Paul Wuebben brought to the Committee&#146;s attention that a Fuel Cell Commercialization Workshop will be held October 4, 1996 in the AQMD&#146;s Auditorium. 
<P><B>6. Review of Advanced Battery Program</B>
<P> Mike Bogdanoff gave a status report on the demonstration of advanced batteries in EVs, noting that in response to a SCE-GM proposal, a working group of the AQMD and other agencies is developing an EV-advanced battery project.  This project involves incentives for people to buy EVs with advanced batteries, as well as to study the impact of these long-range EVs on consumers and utilities.  This working group is expecting to have the project plan completed by the end of October, and a proposal to the Technology Committee within the following few months.  In principal, the group recommends providing incentives for advanced batteries beyond the ARB Memorandum of Agreement, and for household charging systems only.
<P><B>7.  Change of Date and Time for Technology Committee</B>
<P> Committee members agreed to keep the meeting schedule for Technology Committee as the fourth Friday of the month (unless there are five Fridays and then it will meet on the third Friday) from 11:30 to 1:00 in CC-8.
<P> The October 1996 Technology Committee meeting will be held at CE-CERT to acquaint new Committee members with this facility.  Also, there will be no meeting in December unless a pressing need develops.
<P><B>Other Business</B>
<P> Chairman Paulitz introduced Ron Loveridge as a new member of the Technology Committee, filling the vacancy created by William Burke&#146;s resignation from the Committee.
<P><B>Public Comment Period</B>

<P><b>Proposal:</b> <blockquote> Set Public Hearing October 11, 1996, to
 Adopt Proposed Rule 1605 - Credits for the Voluntary Repair of On-Road Motor Vehicles Identified Through Remote Sensing Devices</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> Proposed Rule 1605 will provide greater opportunities to generate Mobile Source Emission Reduction Credits (MSERCs) that can be used as an alternative means of compliance with AQMD regulations. The rule will also provide incentive for the early repair of high-emitting on-road motor vehicles.  To qualify for MSERCs, emission reductions generated from the implementation of this rule would have to be surplus to the statewide inspection and maintenance program.</blockquote>
<P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote> Mobile Source, August 16, 1996, Recommended for Consideration</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action:</b><blockquote>
Set a Public Hearing October 11, 1996 to adopt Proposed Rule 1605 - Credits for the Voluntary Repair of On-Road Motor Vehicles Identified Through Remote Sensing Devices.
</blockquote><P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<p>
<B>Background</B>
<P>Proposed Rule 1605 is the fifth MSERC program to be considered for adoption in a continuing effort to provide stationary source operators additional flexibility to meet AQMD regulations.  It is preceded by:  Rule 1610 - Old-Vehicle Scrapping; Rule 1612 - Credits for Clean On-Road Vehicles; Rule 1620 - Credits for Off-Road Mobile Equipment; and Rule 1623 - Credits for Clean Lawn and Garden Equipment.
<p>
<B>Proposal</B>
<P>The proposed rule provides a mechanism for issuing VOC, CO, and NOx MSERCs to anyone who voluntarily reduces emissions from in-use on-road vehicles by repairing those vehicles that are identified and verified to be high-emitting vehicles through the combined use of remote sensing devices (RSDs) and California Smog Check testing.  To qualify for MSERCs, emission reductions generated from the implementation of this rule would have to be surplus to the statewide inspection and maintenance program or any other programs which use RSDs for the purpose of identifying high-emitting vehicles.
<P>Proposed Rule 1605 establishes requirements for submission of applications, issuance of credits, MSERC calculation, use of credits, recordkeeping and enforcement.  MSERCs issued under Proposed Rule 1605 may be used as RECLAIM Trading Credits, New Source Review (NSR) offsets, and as an alternative method of compliance with AQMD Regulation XI rules with future compliance dates.

<p><B>AQMP &amp; Legal Mandates</B>
<P>The proposed rule meets the 1994 AQMP commitment to develop market-based incentive strategies.  In addition, the proposed rule is intended to provide an alternative means of compliance with AQMD regulations, as well as provide incentives to repair high-emitting on-road motor vehicles.  Finally, the proposed rule is another mechanism to generate MSERCs which may be converted to UTCs as part of the proposed Intercredit Trading Program.

<p><B>Public Comments</B>

<p>A public workshop was held on August 14, 1996.  Staff has prepared responses to comments that are contained in the staff report.  Staff is still in on-going discussions with the Air Resources Board regarding potential issues associated with emission reduction overlap with the State&#146;s enhanced inspection and maintenance program.  If any additional changes are needed to the proposed rule, they will be made in the final hearing package.  It is important to note that the enhanced inspection and maintenance program will not be fully implemented for approximately two years.  Staff will work diligently over the next 30 days with the Air Resources Board and Bureau of Automotive Repair to resolve any of their concerns.<p>
<B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B>
<P>AQMD staff has reviewed the proposed project pursuant to state CEQA Guidelines Section  15002(k)(1).  The project involves emission reduction credit generation and does not have the potential to have a significant adverse impact on the environment.  Therefore, the project is exempt from the requirements of CEQA.  A Notice of Exemption will be prepared, pursuant to state CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3), for the proposed rule and will be filed with the county clerks immediately following the adoption of the proposed rule.

<p><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>Sufficient resources have been budgeted in the AQMD Three-Year Budget Forecast.

<P>BOARD MEETING DATE:  September 13, 1996 AGENDA NO.    32</b></center>
<br><br><P><b>Proposal:</b><blockquote> Amend Rule 1176 - VOC Emissions from Wastewater Systems</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> Proposed amendments will establish revised monitoring and controls that will reduce VOC emissions by 3.0 tons per day through year 2010 from process drains and other components of wastewater systems located at refineries, oil and gas production facilities, and chemical and industrial plants.</blockquote>
<P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote> Not applicable.</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>1. Certify the Final Supplemental Environmental Assessment for Proposed Amended Rule 1176 - VOC Emissions from Wastewater Systems.
<P>2. Amend Rule 1176 - VOC Emissions from Wastewater Systems.</blockquote>
<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br>Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The purpose of Rule 1176 - Sumps and Wastewater Separators, is to reduce VOC emissions from wastewater systems located at refineries, oil production fields, chemical plants, and other industrial facilities engaged in the production and distribution of natural gas and petroleum products.  The rule originally was adopted on November 3, 1989 and subsequently amended twice, on January 5, 1990 and May 13, 1994, to address SIP changes.
<P>VOC emissions are generated from wastewater systems whenever the surface of a liquid containing VOCs is exposed to the atmosphere.  Such emissions are generally a function of the VOC content in the liquid, flow rate of the liquid, drop height of the liquid, material temperature and vapor pressure, exposed area for evaporation, ambient temperature and wind conditions.  The proposed rule targets VOC emission sources in a wastewater system from process drains, and components associated with the sewer lines including junction box vents and openings in manhole covers.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Based on staff&#146;s analysis of the proposed amendments, more than three tons per day of VOC emission reductions can be achieved at an overall estimated cost of less than $600 per ton of reduction using a combination of controls.  The cost estimates, depending on the selection of air pollution control equipment under worst case, could be as high as about $4,400 per ton of reduction.  However, staff believes that facilities will utilize the least costly control options, which achieve VOC emission reductions at an overall estimated cost of less than $600 per ton.  The emission reductions will result from control of drains and other wastewater system components.  
<P>Based on recent additional comments provided by industry, the proposed amendments have been revised from those in the Set Hearing package to provide increased flexibility and cost savings to the affected sources.  The major changes include a reduced monitoring frequency and, in some cases, a complete exemption from monitoring requirements for specific drain system components and a three-month extension in the effective date of the rule to allow for characterization, selection and implementation of a control strategy for drain system components, and in particular junction boxes, at refineries.
<P>In the latest proposed amendments, refineries will be provided the option to either control repeat emitting drain system components with a combination of monitoring and controls, or to install controls on all drain system components.  Refineries are provided nine months to develop their control strategy and begin implementation of either option.  They have until the end of year 2000 to incrementally control all uncontrolled drain system components at a rate of 25% each year, if they choose the latter option.
<P>VOC emissions from the intermediate components of sewer lines connecting drains to wastewater separators, such as the junction boxes and manhole covers, will be required to be monitored and controlled, if necessary, for all facilities.  Facilities are provided nine months to assess emission levels from junction box vents and manhole cover openings and to develop a control strategy.  At that time, facilities begin implementation of their selected control strategy and are provided with up to six months after obtaining Permits to Construct if air pollution control equipment which requires a Permit to Construct and Operate is necessary to control emissions from any wastewater system components.
<P>The proposed amendments will also provide increased operational flexibility to facilities by reducing the monitoring and source test frequencies and by exempting specific, insignificant emission sources.  In the latest proposed amendments, the monitoring frequency for refineries is reduced from monthly to quarterly for low-emitting drain component systems, and from monthly to semi-annually and annually for drain system components equipped with controls and for inaccessible components, respectively.  The monitoring frequency is also reduced from monthly to quarterly for all drain system components and to semi-annually and annually for specific drain system components for facilities which can demonstrate that a significant percent of the drain system components at their facilities are non-emitters.  The source test frequency for air pollution control equipment is also reduced from semi-annually to once a year and other less expensive compliance demonstration alternatives are provided in lieu of source testing.
<P>In addition, the monitoring frequency is reduced from monthly to quarterly for all drain system components and to semi-annually and annually for specific drain system components for all other non-refinery facilities subject to this rule.
<P>This approach allows focusing resources on drain system components with higher potential to emit VOCs. The reduced monitoring and source testing frequencies, for example, could result in cost savings close to $148,000 per year just for one of the large refineries alone.  The reduced monitoring frequency will also result in cost savings in excess of $73,000 per year as a whole, for other non-refinery facilities such as oil and gas production, chemical and other industrial facilities.
<P>Also, the exclusion of bulk loading terminals from the applicability of the rule is extended from those handling gasoline only to all others.  This exclusion is not expected to result in any significant emission increases, and will result in altogether additional monitoring cost savings in excess of $57,000 per year for the affected facilities.
<P>Review of the proposed amendments pursuant to CEQA have identified no significant adverse impacts.  Therefore, staff recommends adoption of the proposed amendments to Rule 1176.
<P><B>Policy Issues</B>
<P>One of the major policy issues raised as a result of the proposed amendments relates to whether or not the existing uncontrolled drain system components, such as junction box vents and manhole cover openings, should be monitored and controlled.  Overall, the proposed amendments require monitoring and control, if necessary, of VOCs from all potential sources of emissions in wastewater systems.  Staff believes that since the wastewater system components are all interconnected, partial control of only certain drain system components would not only leave potentially significant VOC emission sources uncontrolled, but may indeed increase emissions from such uncontrolled sources.
<P>Since very little data was available on emissions from junction box vents and manhole cover openings, staff conducted a series of surveys, monitoring and source tests on such sources at all major refineries in 1996.  Based on the results of the surveys, staff has concluded that emissions from these sources are significant and emissions can be reduced cost effectively.  In addition, the original intent of the rule was to reduce VOC emissions from the entire wastewater system.  Therefore, staff has proposed to require monitoring and control, if necessary, of these sources.  However, in order to address industry&#146;s concerns, staff has proposed a period of nine months to allow refineries to better characterize their emission sources and to select and implement the appropriate control strategy.
<P>The other major policy issue relates to the level of monitoring and control required for sources with various emission potentials.  Staff has considered this issue and has recommended to shift industry resources for monitoring and control to wastewater system components with higher potential to emit VOCs.  Therefore, staff has proposed to reduce the monitoring frequency for sources with lower potential to emit, while focusing resources more to monitor and control, if necessary, the high and repeat emitting sources.  In addition, staff has proposed to reduce source test frequencies for air pollution control equipment and to exempt altogether certain other sources with insignificant emissions.
<P><B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B>
<P>Pursuant to CEQA, staff prepared a Draft Supplemental Environmental Assessment (SEA) for the proposed amendments to Rule 1176.  The Draft SEA did not identify any significant adverse environmental impacts from the proposed project and was circulated for a 30-day public review and comment period ending July 29, 1996.  One comment letter was received and it has been incorporated into the Final SEA which is included in this final board package.  No significant changes were made to the SEA between the Draft and the Final version.
<P>Potential impacts of the proposed amendments were analyzed using the AQMD&#146;s Socioeconomic REMI model (1993).  The analysis estimates that the employment impact resulting from the proposed amendments on average is about seven jobs forgone per year between 1997 and 2010.  This number could range to about 50 jobs forgone per year between 1997 and 2010 if the facilities choose the more expensive control option.
<P><B>Implementation Plan</B>
<P>The proposed amendments will require a certified inspector program to be implemented on or after July 1, 1997 or at a later date approved by the AQMD.  This inspectors&#146; certification program will be jointly implemented with the representatives of the affected industries once the proposed amendments are adopted.  A notice will be sent to all affected sources informing them of the start of implementation of the certification program.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>The proposed amendments will require development of a certified inspector program, additional monitoring of junction box vents and manhole covers and additional review of the wastewater system compliance plans and control strategies by AQMD staff.  In the mean time, reduced workloads are expected by the proposed exclusion of bulk terminals and other sources from this rule.  Overall, existing AQMD resources will be sufficient to implement the proposed changes to this rule with minimal impact on the budget.

<br>  Executive Officer
<P><hr>

<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Rule 1171 - Solvent Cleaning Operations, represents the single largest emission reduction rule which would have been subsumed by VOC RECLAIM, an emissions trading program.  The VOC RECLAIM program, which had been under development since 1991, included about 1,200 companies that used paints, coatings, solvents, and adhesives.  As proposed, this emissions trading program would have reduced VOC emissions by 20.8 tons per day by 2005.  In January 1996, the AQMD Governing Board decided to stop work on VOC RECLAIM and directed staff to expeditiously proceed with the development of other VOC emission reduction rules to meet our AQMP commitments.  Rule 1171 is the first and the largest emission reduction rule proposal in this category.  Both VOC RECLAIM and Proposed Amended Rule 1171 would have produced comparable VOC emission reductions by 2010.  However, they differ in applicability and focus of control strategy.  While VOC RECLAIM was designed for about 1,200 larger companies that used a variety of VOC products, this rule proposal is focused on solvent cleaning operations at any facility, irrespective of its size or permitting status.  Therefore, Rule 1171, as proposed, will reduce VOC emissions from over 30,000 companies within the jurisdiction of the AQMD.
<P>Rule 1171 - Solvent Cleaning Operations was originally adopted on August 2, 1991, and further amended on May 8, 1995.  The primary purpose of the rule is to reduce the emissions of  Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from solvent cleaning activities during the production, repair, maintenance, or servicing of  products, tools, machinery, and general work areas.  Such cleaning may be performed at auto repair facilities, garages and service stations, printing shops, metal fabrication facilities, electronics manufacturing facilities and other businesses.  The rule does not apply to certain solvent cleaning operations that are governed by other AQMD rules including solvent degreasers (Rule 1122) and the cleaning of aircraft components (Rule 1124), nor does it apply to residential, institutional, or janitorial cleaning.
<P>Prior to the adoption of Rule 1171 in 1991, each Regulation XI - Source Specific Standards rule contained provisions for solvent cleaning.  The development of Rule 1171 unified such requirements, but introduced different solvent cleaning categories including general cleaning, repair and maintenance cleaning, cleaning of coating and adhesive application equipment, and cleaning of ink application equipment.  Each solvent cleaning category was subject to prescribed VOC and/or vapor pressure limits.  In addition, the devices and methods used for solvent cleaning operations were required to meet specific requirements.  
<P>Rule 1171 was amended in May 1995 to alleviate SIP deficiencies cited by the federal EPA and to addressrectify industry concerns. The amendments did not achieve additional VOC emission reductions.  This action was largely administrative in nature and included addresseding specialty cleaning operations (e.g., medical device manufacturing) and  the refinedment and clarifiedcation of rule language (e.g., test methods and definitions).  

<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>
Based on extensive AQMD study and supporting CARB data, the emission inventory for cleaning operations subject to Rule 1171 is projected at 35.9 tons per day of VOCs from permitted and unpermitted sources in both the industrial and commercial sectors.  The proposed amendments to Rule 1171 will achieve VOC emissions reduction of 20.5 tons per day by 2010 or a 46% reduction in the future Rule 1171 VOC emission inven-tory.
<p>
The proposed emission abatements reflect staffs technical assessment regarding low-VOC solvent cleaning materials available today.  Aqueous cleaners containing no VOCs or minimal VOCs (< 50 grams per liter) are used successfully in repair and maintenance cleaning in various equipment including parts washers and remote reservoir cleaners.  Aqueous cleaning materials cost less than their high-VOC organic solvent counterparts currently in use, although some aqueous cleaners may require heating, resulting in higher energy costs.  The extended bath life of such cleaners also minimizes hazardous waste and its associated costs.  Overall, the conversion from petroleum-based solvent cleaners to aqueous cleaners is driven by the resulting cost savings.  Some key issues in the wide-scale employment of water-based cleaning systems include water resources, hazardous waste, and water quality. 
<p>
Acetone, which has been delisted as a VOC, is used successfully in certain handwipe cleaning operations.  Conversion to acetone costs no more than petroleum solvents cur-rently in use.  Health and safety considerations are the key issues in employing acetone as a cleaning solvent, which is more acceptable in blends and diluted solutions than in its pure form.
<p>
A Rule 1171 Advisory Panel was formed at the outset of this rulemaking effort back in January 1996 with experts from the solvent cleaning industry including manufacturers, vendors and consultants.  AQMD staff met with the panel on several occasions to gather and discuss relevant information and technologies involving solvent cleaning operations prior to drafting a rule proposal.  Three public meetings, noticed in newspapers pursuant to applicable law, were held to solicit public input relative to the staff rule proposal.  Staff has met several times with individual companies and persons who requested pri-vate meetings with the AQMD to discuss Proposed Amended Rule 1171.  Staff also vis-ited various facilities to observe first-hand a variety of cleaning processes including op-erations at facilities that have successfully converted to low- and zero-VOC cleaning materials.


<P><B>Summary of Proposed Amendments:</B>
<P>The staff proposal will:
<P><ul><li> lower the VOC limit for repair and maintenance cleaning from 900 to 50 grams per liter, effective January 1, 1999;
<P><li> iinclude special subcategories under repair and maintenance cleaning for medical devices and electrical apparatus components;
<P><li> lower the vapor pressure limit for the cleaning of lithographic and letterpress ink application equipment from 25 mm Hg @ 68<sup>o</sup>F to 10 mm Hg @ 68<sup>o</sup>F, effective January 1, 1999;
<P><li> lower the VOC limit for the cleaning of polyester resin application equipment from 200 to 50 grams per liter, effective January 1, 1997;
<P><li> provide incentives (e.g. emission fee reduction and recordkeeping exemption) for the use of non-polluting cleaning materials as defined asin &quot;CClean Air Solvents;&quot;;; and,
<P><li> include an aerosol exemption which was inadvertently deleted from the May 1995 amendments.
</ul><P><B>Reactivity</B>
<P>Some providers of petroleum-based cleaning solvents and cleaning systems have opposed the staff-recommended lower VOC grams/liter limit based on the feasibility of aqueous or low VOC (&lt;50 grams/liter) cleaning solvents and systems.  The AQMD has been asked to consider the reactivity of a hydrocarbon-based or petroleum-based solvent in lieu of a total volume reduction of VOCs as currently proposed.  The use of reactivity as a regulatory tool has been debated at the local, state, and national level for over twenty years.  Reactivity of a solvent refers to its ozone forming potential.  Reactivity issues were thoroughly assessed during the VOC RECLAIM rule development process over a period of several years.  The results were inconclusive.  Although it is inappropriate to delay VOC emission reductions based on this concern, it may be appropriate to study the issue further if new information not analyzed in previous AQMD study efforts is brought forward.
<P><B>Market Forces</B>
<P>The transition from petroleum-based cleaning solvents to aqueous or low-VOC (&lt;50 grams/liter) cleaning solvents and systemsers may impact the competitiveness among vendors and suppliers of cleaning materials.  SuppliersVendors of aqueous cleaning materials are already penetrating the repair and maintenance cleaning marketplace.  , albeit slowly, andT this proposal, ifafter adoptedion, is expected to accelerate the transition from higher VOC emitting petroleum-based cleaning solvents to low-VOC or aqueous cleaning materials.  National suppliersVendors of petroleum-based solvents may, therefore, lose some of their market share to smaller, local suppliers of aqueous cleaning systems.  On the other hand, existing suppliers of petroleum-based cleaning systems may retain their market share by continuing to provide full service to their clients that includinges, supply of equipment and compliant cleaning materials, and pickup and disposal of the resulting waste.  The final outcome, in this respect, is dependent on market forces in the future.
<P><B>AQMP and  Legal Mandates</B>
<p>The California Health and Safety Code requires the AQMD to adopt an AQMP to meet state and federal ambient air quality standards in the Basin.  In addition, the California Health and Safety Code requires that the AQMD adopt rules and regulations that carry out the objectives of the AQMP
<P>The Rule 1171 emissions inventory is estimated at 35.9 tons per day of VOCs.  This figure is based on: (1) 1993 emissions data reported by the affected permitted industry; (2) CARB emission inventory data for permitted and unpermitted sources in this emission category; (3) VOC RECLAIM emission inventory work; (4) DistrictAQMD AEIS data; and (5) a soon- to -be -released independent emission inventory study of solvent cleaning operations in California by an ARB contractor (PECHAN).  Based on current activity levels, no increase in the Rule 1171 inventory is assumed until 1999.  With an AQMP growth rate of 2% per year from 1999 to 2010, the unregulated emissions inventory would grow to 44.6 tons per day in 2010.  The rule&#146;s impact on the current emission inventory and this growth will produce an estimated emission reduction of 20.5 tons per day.  The estimated change in emissionspicture is depicted graphically below.

<P><B>CEQA</B>
<P>Pursuant to California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the AQMD&#146;s Certified Regulatory Program (Rule 110), staff has prepared a FinalDraft Subsequent Draft Subsequent Environmental Assessment (EA) for Proposed Amended Rule 1171.  The Final Subsequent EA has been released for a 45-day public review period.  All comments received on the Draft Subsequent EA have been responded to in the Final Subsequent EA.
<P>The environmental topics analyzed in the Draft Subsequent EA were air quality, water resources, hazards, public services (fire departments), and energy resources.  The analysis concluded that the proposed amendments may result in significant adverse air quality and water resource impacts.  
<P>The potential air quality impacts would be due to increased NOx emissions associated with the electrical requirements to heat water-based cleaning systems.  While it is unlikely that electric generating facilities would need to generate additional electricity to account for the potential incremental increased demand, the significant determination is based on a worst-case scenario.
<P>As is currently the case with organic solvent-based cleaning operations, water-based cleaning activities may lead to adverse impacts on water resources if not handled properly.  This potential impact may be exacerbated by the proposed rule amendments, since some vendors of water-based cleaning solvents advertiseing that  their products areas being sewer safe.  Accordingly, the proposed amendments may result in significant adverse water quality impacts even though:  1) proper disposal would preclude this effect, and  2) some organic solvent-based cleaning operators may currently be illegally disposing of spent cleaning materials.  These potential water impacts are governed by state and federal laws that are implemented by local sanitation districts.  They are required to periodically monitor the water quality to iensure that the water is within discharge limits.
<P>As a result of the determination of significance and a finding that sanitation districts may be able to mitigate some potential impacts, a Statement of Findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations and a Mitigation Monitoring Plan has been will be prepared for the Governing Board&#146;s review prior to the public hearing for the proposed amendments.
<P><B>Socioeconomic Assessment</B>
<P>The socioeconomic assessment found that adoption of the proposed amendments to Rule 1171 would provide a cost savings to the affected industry of approximately estimated at $4.5 million annually.  While compliance with the 50-gram-per-liter VOC content limit would increase equipment and operation costs, the savings in materials and disposal costs would more than offset these.  The $4.5 million annual savings would be achieved in the categories of Surface Preparation and General Cleaning, and Remote Reservoir Cleaning.  Other cleaning categories are expected to comply with the amendments by switching to acetone, aqueous cleaners, or lower vapor pressure solvents, with no increase in costs.

<P><B>Implementation Plan</B>
<P>Source training classes will be scheduled to assist facilities in will be trained to implementing the proposed revisions to Rule 1171.  Notices will be sent to thevarious  sources affected by these amendments.  Staff will conduct special outreach efforts to inform the general public about this solvent cleaning regulation.

<P><B>Resource Impact</B>

<P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
The Board established the AQMD's Technology Advancement (TA) program in 1988
to help meet the goals of the AQMP for implementation of progressively lower
emitting technologies and fuels. A significant ingredient in the success
of this program has been the contributions made by various academic institutions
within the South Coast Air Basin. For example, local universities offer the
TA program access to a wealth of technical expertise and resources regarding
low-emission technologies. At the same time, AQMD support for universities
allows them to better provide hands-on training and experience for tomorrow's
professionals in such essential fields as emissions control, environmental
engineering, automotive mechanics, and electrochemistry.
<P>
In 1991 the University of California, Riverside (UCR) established CE-CERT
(the College of Engineering - Center for Environmental Research and Technology)
to facilitate more rapid transfer of air pollution control technology, from
research and development to commercial implementation. CE-CERT also was
established to provide independent testing for emerging low- and zero-emission
technologies. A Board of Advisors made up of corporate, university, and
regulatory agency representatives was established to oversee CE-CERT's technical
agenda, which is focused primarily on technologies identified in the AQMP
as essential to attainment of ambient air quality standards. During the last
five years, the AQMD has worked closely with CE-CERT in the research,
development, demonstration, and testing of advanced air pollution control
technologies and cleaner burning fuels. In the FY 1996-97 Budget, $700,000
has been identified as a contract sub-category for CE-CERT to conduct such
projects. This action is to apply this FY 1996-97 funding to conduct new
projects and expand the scope of several existing CE-CERT projects.
<P>
<B>Proposals</B>
<P>
1. Measurement of Primary Particulate Matter Emissions from Light-Duty Motor
Vehicles
<P>
Recent studies of primary particulate matter (PM) emissions from light-duty
motor vehicles indicate that some vehicles, notably those emitting visible
smoke, may produce PM at rates substantially higher than assumed currently.
No recent studies provide adequate data to accurately assess the contribution
of in-use light-duty vehicles to the PM inventory. The results of this study
will create a baseline PM emissions inventory for vehicles operating on
conventional fuel, which can be used to determine potential emissions benefits
from vehicles operating on alternative fuels.
<P>
CE-CERT will test and provide data on emission rates and size distributions
of primary particulate matter from a large and representative number of in-use
light-duty vehicles. The emphasis of the measurements will be on emissions
of PM10 and PM2.5, and characterization of the chemical composition of the
measured particulate. Total cost for this project is $200,000. AQMD's co-funding
shall not exceed $100,000, with the remaining $100,000 being co-funded by
the Coordinating Research Council.
<P>
2. Smoking Vehicle Project, Medium-Duty Diesel Trucks
<P>
In this project, CE-CERT will conduct an assessment of the contribution of
medium- and light heavy-duty vehicles to the particulate emissions inventory.
The results of this study will create a baseline PM emission inventory for
medium- and light heavy-duty trucks operating on diesel fuel and will be
used to determine the emissions benefits from the same category of trucks
operating on alternative fuels. Data will be collected from the Department
of Motor Vehicles and other sources to estimate the population of these vehicles
in the Basin. Furthermore, a representative sample of these vehicles will
then be recruited for dynamometer testing to develop emission factors for
PM10 and PM2.5. Chemical analysis will be performed on particulate samples
collected during dynamometer testing to determine the elemental and organic
carbon distributions. AQMD's funding for this project shall not exceed $100,000.
<P>
3. Inventory of AFVs &amp; AFV Comparison; OEM vs Retrofits
<P>
CE-CERT will perform a survey of public and private fleets in the Basin to
determine the population of alternative fuel vehicles. Information to be
gathered shall include fuel type (methanol, ethanol, natural gas, propane,
electric, etc.), retrofit or original equipment manufacturer, class of vehicle
(light-, medium- or heavy-duty), and number of AFV's in the fleet.
<P>
In addition, kits to retrofit light-duty vehicles to operate on natural gas
or propane have improved greatly in the last three years. No comprehensive
comparison has been made between the emissions of 1990 or later model vehicles
that have been retrofitted to operate on propane or natural gas and their
gasoline counterparts. This project will select a representative number of
vehicles and perform emissions testing on the AFVs and their gasoline
counterparts. AQMD's funding for this project shall not exceed $250,000.
<P>
4. Development of Advanced Low-Emitting Propane Fueled Vehicle
<P>
In this project, CE-CERT will work on developing an advanced technology vehicle
fueled with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). This project will be part of TA's
overall program of providing funding opportunities for colleges and universities
for developing clean alternative fuel propulsion systems. In addition, this
project supports the ARB's low emission vehicle regulations. District's funding
for this project shall not exceed $50,000.
<P>
5. Operation &amp; Improvement of the Solar Hydrogen Facility, Phase III
(Contract 95073, Project 6)
<P>
CE-CERT provides ongoing maintenance and operation of UCR's Solar Hydrogen
Research Facility, which was established through an AQMD-cosponsored program
in 1991. The proposed FY 1996-97 funding will allow CE-CERT to continue
maintaining and operating this unique research facility for approximately
18 more months. Needed upgrades include installing a system to remove moisture
from the compressed hydrogen, and the procurement of a hardened steel cylinder
to address compressor wear problems. Maintenance includes cleaning the grounds
and equipment, verification of equipment performance, making necessary repairs,
and routine servicing of the electrolysis skid, gas bell, and hydrogen
compressor. Operation of the facility includes data acquisition, analysis,
and reporting; as well as daily supervision of the hydrogen-refueling station.
CE-CERT staff and students provide tours of the facility in response to requests
from all over the world. AQMD's funding for this project shall not exceed
$50,000.
<P>
6. Phase III of the Gasoline Composition Study (Contract 94166)
<P>
CE-CERT has been conducting Phase I and Phase II of an air quality benefit
assessment for 1996 reformulated gasoline (RFG) versus baseline gasoline.
Currently the RFG which was introduced in the Basin in March 1996 is considered
as the new baseline gasoline. The results of this study will be used to compare
the composition of RFG with the old baseline and transitional gasoline, and
it will serve as the basis for comparison of future improvements in gasoline
formulations and current alternative fuels. The multi-phased program in its
entirety involves the following aspects: establishment of a protocol for
surveying baseline and future gasoline and the conduct of fuel analysis to
determine physical and chemical composition, as well as fuel variability;
calculation and comparison of reactivity.
<P>
In Phase I, CE-CERT formed and convened an advisory panel that included
representation from the automotive and oil industries. Using protocols
recommended by the advisory panel, CE-CERT has analyzed 60 winter and 60
summer fuel samples of transitional gasoline. The results of Phase I have
quantified the transition period of baseline gasoline to RFG. For example,
these tests have documented decreases in both benzene content and Reid Vapor
Pressure. In Phase II which is currently underway, CE-CERT is in the process
of procuring and analyzing 60 samples of 1996 RFG under summer formulations.
<P>
In the proposed Phase III, which will complete this multiphase project, CE-CERT
will procure and analyze 60 samples of 1996 RFG under winter formulations
that have higher volatility. As in Phases I &amp; II, each gasoline sample
will be analyzed to identify specific compounds and reactivity. AQMD's funding
for Phase III of this project shall not exceed $100,000.
<P>
7. Smog Chamber Evaluation of AFV Emissions (Contract 95073, Project 4)
<P>
Since December 1994, the AQMD has been sponsoring CE-CERT to conduct a study
to evaluate the atmospheric reactivity of emissions from light- and medium-duty
vehicles operating on reformulated gasoline and alternative fuels. The results
of this study will show the potential of ozone formation from light- and
medium-duty vehicles operating on alternative fuels. In March 1996, the ARB
committed $253,327 in cost-sharing to support the smog chamber operations
of the project through November 1997. CE-CERT now requests additional AQMD
funding to expand the scope of this project by increasing the testing matrix
to include more vehicle and fuel types. CE-CERT shall perform an additional
18 exhaust emissions tests. The tests will be conducted on the vehicle/fuel
combinations to investigate vehicle-to-vehicle and test-to-test variability.
AQMD's funding for this project shall not exceed $50,000.
<P>
These proposed projects are included in the Technology Advancement Plan,
approved on March 8, 1996, as part of Project MS-11, "Development and
Demonstration of Low Emission, Alternative Fuel Technologies for On-Road
Applications" and Project TR-01, "Advanced Transportation Systems Research,
Development, and Demonstration." The expected benefits of these projects
include the evaluation of on-road emission changes due to reformulated gasoline,
alternative fuels, and advanced control technologies.
<P>
<B>Sole Source Justification</B>
<P>
Section II, Step C(3) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure identifies
four provisions under which a sole-source bid may be justified: (1) cost
to prepare documents exceeds cost for consultation, (2) delay would result
in the endangerment of public health, (3) services are only available from
sole source, and (4) other circumstances exist identifying sole source as
in the best interests of the District.
<P>
This request for a sole-source bid is made under provision (4). The University
of California, Riverside's CE-CERT brings together a critical mass of experience
from academia, industry, and government agencies to accomplish the stated
objectives of the proposed projects. CE-CERT serves a unique role in the
Basin as an independent and objective scientific body capable of providing
in-depth and valid evaluations of new environmental regulations and technologies.
It has established a broad-based research agenda with unique facilities,
capabilities, and resources that are requisite and directly applicable for
completion of the proposed scopes of work. CE-CERT's established areas of
expertise and available resources that directly relate to the proposed work
include: vehicle emissions research and testing, advanced vehicle engineering,
renewable fuels and energy engineering, chemical analysis of fuels, design
and fabrication of hydrogen engines, integration of fuel cells into test
vehicles, transportation systems research, environmental modeling, and
atmospheric processes. Staff believes that these broad-based capabilities
and resources, uniquely offered by an in-Basin university having a long history
of academic excellence in the field of air pollution control, justify additional
AQMD funding for the specified contracts with CE-CERT. Furthermore, staff
believes that it is in the best interest of the District to rely on
CE-CERT's known expertise and mobile-source knowledge to continue the proposed
research programs.
<P>
CE-CERT encourages the participation of, and uses as subcontractors, small
businesses, and minority-, disabled veteran-, and women-owned business
enterprises in its programs to the maximum extent possible to ensure efficient
performance and compliance with contract requirements and applicable laws.
<P>
<B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>
Total cost to the AQMD for the proposed amendments and new contracts is $700,000.

</blockquote><P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote> Technology, August 16, 1996, Recommended for Approval</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>Authorize the Chairman to execute a contract amendment with Thermo Power Corporation in an amount not to exceed $45,279 to provide for software and hardware upgrades to demonstration vehicles in a project to develop and demonstrate a natural gas retrofit kit for heavy-duty diesel engines.  Total AQMD funding for the project, as amended, shall not exceed $202,034.</blockquote>
<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR> Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The AQMP emphasizes the use of alternative fuels throughout the transportation sector as an air quality attainment strategy.  Heavy-duty trucks are significant contributors to the Basin&#146;s inventory of NOx and PM.  Although alternative fuels such as natural gas can provide significant emissions benefits when used in heavy-duty engines, availability of new natural gas engines is limited and they carry a heavy price premium.  A cost-effective alternative to new engines, particularly for older vehicles, may be natural gas retrofit technologies for existing diesel engines.
<P>In May 1995, the AQMD contracted with Thermo Power Corporation, Tecogen Division, to develop and demonstrate a natural gas retrofit kit for existing diesel engines, in particular, the Navistar DT466.  The DT466 is very popular in delivery vehicles, school buses, and trucking applications.  There are an estimated 70,000 of these engines in operation in California.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Two engines, in trucks operated by San Bernardino County, were retrofitted.  These vehicles are operating satisfactorily with the retrofit engines, except for reduced power.  The Contractor has identified the need for further system enhancements to improve performance and emissions.  These enhancements include software modifications and improvements to installation hardware.  Thermo Power has entered into an agreement with the CEC for emissions control system development, which will be a part of the overall system enhancement.  Although the current retrofit kits provide reduced emissions, further development is needed for the Contractor to meet its goal of an ARB low-emission certification for the retrofit kit.  
<P>The San Bernardino County trucks will receive all applicable system upgrades produced as a result of the AQMD and CEC agreements.  The CEC agreement includes a field demonstration of three refuse packers, operated in daily residential pickup service in Santa Monica.  These vehicles operate in a much different duty cycle from the AQMD cost-shared San Bernardino trucks.  The San Bernardino trucks operate mostly in over-the-road service around San Bernardino County.  The Santa Monica trucks will operate in residential refuse pickup, a severe stop-and-go duty cycle.  It is important to the future success of the conversion kit that the Contractor gain experience with as many applications and duty cycles as possible.  As part of the proposed amendment, Contractor has agreed to provide data on the Santa Monica trucks as part of its reporting requirements to the AQMD.
<P><B>Sole Source Justification</B>
<P>Section II, Step 3 (C) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure identifies four provisions under which a sole-source award may be justified: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds cost for consultant, (2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health, (3) services are only available from sole source, and (4) other circumstances exist identifying sole source as in the best interests of the AQMD.  This request for sole-source award is made under provision (3).
<P>The proposed amendment funds enhancements to technology specifically under development by Thermo Power Corporation.  Thermo Power owns this technology and would not allow another entity to perform this work.  In addition, the major portion of the upgrade work is funded through an agreement between Thermo Power and the CEC.  CEC funding of $94,234 will directly support the laboratory effort toward the upgrades.
<P>The goal of this demonstration program is to provide the necessary field application of a natural gas retrofit technology to enable the manufacturer to proceed to commercialization.  Thermo Power has expressed its intention to pursue ARB LEV certification of the retrofit kit, specifically for 1988-93 Navistar DT466 engines.  According to Thermo Power, there are an estimated 70,000 DT466 engines in operation in California.  Currently there are no LEV-certified heavy-duty retrofit kits on the market in California.
<P>This project is included in the Technology Advancement Plan within Project MS-11, Development and Demonstration of Low Emission, Alternative Fuel Technologies for On-Road Applications.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>Total cost to the AQMD for the proposed amendment is $45,279.  The entire project cost to the AQMD is $202,034, 13% of the total project funding.  Cost-share has increased by $94,234, the portion of a CEC contract with Thermo Power directly attributable to the development of system upgrades.

<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<B>Background</B>
<P>AB 2766 was chaptered into law as Health and Safety Code Sections 44220-44247 which were enacted to authorize air pollution control districts to impose fees on motor vehicles.  These fees are to be expended specifically for the purpose of mobile source air pollution reductions measures pursuant to the California Clean Air Act of 1988 or the AQMD&#146;s AQMP pursuant to Article 5 of Chapter 5.5 of Part 3 of the Health and Safety Code.  Health and Safety Code, Section 44244.1(a) requirements state that any agency receiving fee revenues shall at least once every two years be subject to an audit of each program or project funded.  The audit is to be conducted by an independent auditor selected by the AQMD in accordance with Division 2 (commencing with Section 1100) of the Public Contract Code.  The first biennial audit for FYs 1991-92 and 1992-93 was conducted in FY 1994 and the findings reported to the Board in January 1995.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>In accordance with the AQMD&#146;s Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure, a public notice inviting proposals was published in the California State Contracts Register, Los Angeles Times, Orange County Register, San Bernardino Sun, Riverside Press Enterprise, La Opinion, Korea Central Daily, Rafu Shimpo, Philippine News, Los Angeles Sentinel, Eastern Group Publication, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, Precinct Reporter, El Chicano, The Black Voice News, La Voz, Inland Empire Hispanic News, Chinese News, M/W/DVBE Source, the Purchasing RFP/RFQ 24-hour Phone Line, and the World Wide Web.  A mandatory Bidders Conference to discuss and clarify the requirements of the RFP was scheduled for June 27, 1996.  One hundred forty-one notices were mailed notifying firms of the proposed Request For Proposals and Mandatory Bidders Conference.  Of these, 15 firms responded by attending the conference and seven proposals were submitted.
<P>The proposals were reviewed by a five-person (1 male, 4 female) panel composed of one Senior Financial Analyst from the Orange County Transportation Authority, the Air Resources Board representative on the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee (MSRC), the Air Quality Programs project manager at the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Acting Controller and one financial analyst from the AQMD.  One panel member was Hispanic, one Caucasian, two Asian Pacific American and one Asian Indian.

<P>On April 12, 1996, the Board approved executing a contract with McKesson Water Products (Sparkletts) for the development and demonstration of an electric water delivery truck. Due to delays by McKesson concerning contractual issues, this contract could not be executed in FY 1995-96. These issues are under discussion and are expected to be resolved shortly. This action is to secure Board re-authorization to execute this contract. The proposed project cost is $377,000, of which AQMD would cost-share in an amount not to exceed $175,000. This was reviewed by the Technology Committee on August 16, 1996 and recommended for approval.

<P>On February 10, 1995, the Board approved three vendors for the purchase of personal computer hardware for a two-year period. This is part of a multi-year strategy to bring all desktop hardware up to a baseline configuration. The FY 1996-97 Budget contains an allocation of $340,000 for this purpose. This action also is to transfer $15,000 within the budget to purchase CD-ROM drives and related hardware to support the AQMD&#146;s law library.

<P>State law enacted in 1994, Health and Safety Code Section 40721, provides that CARB, in consultation with Cal-EPA, review and comment on the AQMD&#146;s three-year budget forecast. The Three-Year Budget Forecast for FYs 1995-96, 1996-97, and 1997-98 was the first such three-year forecast submitted for review. One recommendation resulting from that review was to report periodically on changes to the approved budget. This report covers the period July 1, 1995 through June 30, 1996.

</UL><P> The meeting was called to order at 9:50 a.m. by Chairman Mikels.
<UL><LI> Opening Comments</UL>
<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D., Executive Officer.  Noted that subsequent to distribution of Agenda Item No. 14, staff discovered several errors in the tables contained in the report.  Copies of the corrected pages were distributed to Board members.
<UL><LI>Focus on the Future:  The Road Ahead For Clean Air&quot;, A General Assembly</UL>
<P> Chairman Mikels announced that a districtwide legislative summit will be held at AQMD Headquarters on Friday, January 31, 1997.  The theme of the summit is &quot;Focus on the Future:  The Road Ahead For Clean Air&quot;, and its purpose is to bring legislators from across the District together with community, business and environmental representatives and discuss openly with the Board a collaborative approach in forging clean air policies.  An ad hoc committee comprised of Chairman Mikels, Dr. Burke, Ms. Haggard, Ms. Lee and Ms. Soto has been working on implementation of administrative alternatives to legislation that was forthcoming (AB 3248 - Napolitano), and those issues will be included in the discussion at the legislative summit.
<UL><LI> Advisory Council</UL>
<P> Chairman Mikels commented that he sent a letter to the Advisory Council members inviting them to attend the Board meeting and provide more detail with regard to the issues that lead to the resignations of 9 of the 11 members of the Advisory Council.  Dr. Nick Hazelwood, the Chairman of the Advisory Council, and Ms. Carla Walecka were in attendance and prepared to address the Board on this item.  Unfortunately, the 8 members who jointly tendered their resignations in a letter to Chairman Mikels would not be attending the meeting.
<P> Dr. Hazelwood commented that he is reasonably comfortable with the predictions contained in the Draft 1997 AQMP, with respect to ozone attainment.  Because there is less independent and published information about the PM10 modeling process, he is less confident about those predictions.  His recommendation, and that of Bill Carter, the other remaining member of the Advisory Council, is that there be an independent peer review of the modeling process; and that the peer review be conducted by people who are not current contractors or consultants to the AQMD, nor in some regulatory oversight role for approval of AQMD plans.  The benefit of the peer review is that it would respond to the criticisms that have been raised about the modeling process.  It will also give AQMD staff useful input to help them do a better job and to help the Board validate its actions regarding the AQMP.
<P> With respect to the resignations, Dr. Hazelwood expressed his belief that the Council members resigned out of frustration because they were sometimes asked for advice, and the advice ignored--often not even acknowledged--and advice was sometimes not sought when the Advisory Council was available.  He has indicated to Chairman Mikels his willingness to postpone his planned retirement from the Advisory Council to help in organizing a new council, and believes this can be done by the beginning of 1997.  However, the Board needs to define what kind of council it wants and needs--its composition, how members are nominated and selected, and the ethical requirements for membership.  He suggested the Board decide to make frequent and productive use of whatever type of advisory council it creates.  (Submitted Written Comments)
<P> At Mr. Loveridge&#146;s suggestion, Chairman Mikels directed that the recommendation for a peer review of the AQMP modeling process be placed on the agenda for consideration by the Administrative Committee at its next meeting, and brought back to the Board at its October 11, 1996 meeting.
<P> Ms. Walecka highlighted the three main points in her written statement to the Board, dated August 27, 1996, clarifying her reasons for resigning from the Advisory Council.  1)  She did not resign from the Council in protest of the 1997 AQMP.  She believes the Plan is heading in the right direction.  2)  She resigned from the Council because she felt it was underused, and that it was not as effective as it should be; and that included a lack of coherent input on the AQMP.
<BR>3)  She had wanted to resign from the Council for some time because she shared the frustration that Dr. Hazelwood pointed out.  She acted on her intention when she did because she wanted to make clear that she was not part of any faction within or without the Advisory Council.  (Submitted Written Comments)
<P> In response to Mr. Braude, Ms. Walecka strongly recommended that there be a constant infusion of new people into any new advisory council the Board might form. She suggested the Board consider staggering terms for the members to insure that there is both continuity and new voices on the Council, and perhaps limiting terms and/or number of reappointments.  She also suggested that the Board examine how the Council relates to all of the special purpose or single issue advisory groups that the AQMD has started up over the last several years, because she felt there was dilution of the Council&#146;s input on the AQMP and other issues, when given to other advisory groups.  Lastly, she did not believe that semi-annual breakfasts were the best means of accomplishing communication between the Board and the Advisory Council.  She suggested the Advisory Council periodically provide written products to the Board on topics of interest to the Board.
<P> Chairman Mikels indicated that discussion regarding the composition and role of the Advisory Council will be initiated at the next Administrative Committee meeting, and he welcomed comments from Dr. Hazelwood and Ms. Walecka with regard to their ideas on how changes could be implemented.  Mr. Loveridge suggested that the Administrative Committee include in their discussion the idea of quarterly presentations--not just written reports--from the Advisory Council to the Board.
<P> The following individuals addressed the Board to comment on the Advisory Council:
<P>HUGO MORRIS, Joint Council of Teamsters No. 42
<P><U>RAY WHITMER, Teamsters Local No. 911</U><U> </U><U> </U><U> </U>
<P> Commented that a copy of the resignation letter of the 8 Advisory Council members and ballots were circulated to the approximately 400 AQMD employees represented by Teamsters.  Ninety-six percent of the members who responded to the ballot generally agreed with the concerns expressed in the resignation letter.  In support of this position, Mr. Whitmer urged the Board to consider establishing a dialogue with the enforcement employees of AQMD represented by Teamsters; and requested that a committee of designated Board members and AQMD management meet with them to discuss and resolve the employee concerns about the ongoing clean air effort at the AQMD.
<P><U>MARIA SCHWIETERMAN, AQMD Employee</U>
<P> Read a letter which was submitted to the managing editor of the <I>Riverside Press Enterprise</I> in rebuttal to a recent article authored by Gary Polakovic.  The article alluded to high numbers of AQMD employees having low morale and disbelieving in staff&#146;s technical expertise or executive management&#146;s leadership and ability to construct an AQMP for 1997 that meets the intended goals.

<UL>2. Set Public Hearing October 11, 1996 to Adopt Proposed Rule 1605 - Credits for the Voluntary Repair of On-Road Motor Vehicles Identified Through Remote Sensing Devices
<P> At Mr. Silva&#146;s request, staff agreed to inform him prior to the public hearing on Proposed Rule 1605 how staff will solve any overlapping or duplication the proposed rule has with remote sensing under the Bureau of Automotive Repair&#146;s Smog Check Program.
<P>3. Set Public Hearing October 11, 1996 to Amend Rule 1113 - Architectural Coatings
<P> Curtis Coleman, Attorney, addressed the Board on behalf of Sherwin-Williams Company to express concern that Rule 1113 provisions related to flats, lacquers and emissions averaging are not ready for public hearing because of significant issues which need to be discussed further and resolved.  He referred to the letter submitted to the Board from Robert Wendoll of EL RAP (Environmental Legislative &amp; Regulatory Advocacy Program of the Southern California Paint &amp; Coatings Association), raising the same concerns and requesting that no action be taken on those items at the October 11 public hearing.
<P><U>Written Comments Submitted by:</U>
<BR>Robert Wendoll, EL RAP
<P>10. Modify Employee Relations Agreements Pertaining to Management and Confidential Employees
<P> Mr. A.F. &quot;Ric&quot; Riccardi, San Bernardino Public Employees Association, addressed the Board on behalf of the AQMD employees in the Professional Bargaining Unit (PBU) to express support for staff&#146;s recommendation on this item, and to express their confidence that the management negotiating team will in the near future bring a recommendation to the Board for approval of a reasonable increase in benefits for PBU employees, as recommended for management and confidential employees.
<BR>(Mr. Antonovich arrived at 10:33 a.m.)
<P>11. Issue RFP to Provide Temporary Engineering Services
<P> Don Hopps, AQMD Air Quality Engineer, addressed the Board to speak in opposition to staff&#146;s recommendation to create a list of pre-qualified environmental firms that could process AQMD permit applications, when necessary due to schedule spikes.  He questioned whether the intent is to look at dispensing with full time engineers altogether; and urged the Board to direct management to honor the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and discuss alternatives with employee representatives.
<P> Carol Coy, Assistant DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, responded that because of the 1,700 permit applications brought in by the recent Amnesty Program and permitting of the first 500 companies under the Title V Program, the proposed augmentation of staff may be necessary in the next year to meet EPA deadlines on permit issuance. With respect to the MOU issue, Technical Support Services DEO Nick Nikkila responded that management has met its obligation to advise, inform and discuss this item with the union.
<P>17(A) Establish the Office of Public Affairs &amp; Local Government Assistance; Add a Designated Deputy Position to Serve as Deputy Executive Officer for the Office; Create a Local Government &amp; Small Business Assistance Committee; Enhance the AQMD's Outreach Program; and Establish a Policy Regarding Performance Objectives
<P> Chairman Mikels commented that this item is an outline proposal for the creation of a new committee and a new office and DEO position for that office.  There are still many details that need to be worked out, which will be discussed by the Administrative Committee and brought back to the Board prior to implementation.
<P> Indicating his reluctance to approve this item without seeing the details referred to by Chairman Mikels, Dr. Wilson expressed his concern that AQMD may have to cut back its clean air efforts if funds are going to continually be taken out of AQMD&#146;s budget--$185,000, in this instance--in responding to legislative wishes.
<P> Chairman Mikels responded that this item is a reiteration of a proposal that the Board approved, in concept, at its June 14, 1996 meeting.  With interim legislative hearings scheduled to be held later in September, he thought it was important for the Board to reiterate its approval of the proposal, at least in concept, to give an indication that the Board would like to work with the legislature and, to the extent possible, integrate their concerns in areas where there is agreement, and not diminish or create inconsistencies with the Board&#146;s pursuit of AQMD&#146;s mission.  He assured Dr. Wilson that the Board will not be fully committed to this proposal until the details are brought back to the Board for approval.
<P> Mr. Paulitz pointed out that the Board&#146;s June 14 approval of this proposal in concept was conditioned upon the withdrawal of AB 3248 by Assemblywoman Napolitano; and the bill has as yet not been withdrawn.

<UL><P>32. Amend Rule 1176 - VOC Emissions from Wastewater Systems
<P> Mohsen Nazemi, Senior Air Quality Engineering Manager, presented the staff report.  Staff distributed to Board members two revisions to PAR 1176, which staff recommended be incorporated into the proposed amended rule:
<P><UL><I>(1) revisions to Subparagraphs (c)(16) and (i)(5)(F) proposed by staff to clarify the </I><I>meaning of non-contact water and the exempted equipment subject to Rule 1173 </I><I>(Fugitive Emissions of VOCs), respectively; and</I>
<P><I>(2) revisions to Subparagraphs (c)(8)(A), (d)(2)(C) and (f)(1)(A)(ii) proposed by </I><I>WSPA to reduce the monitoring frequency of  (i) drain system components that have </I><I>been demonstrated for 24 months to be non-emitting  and (ii) low-emitting drain </I><I>system components from facilities that have demonstrated 99.5 percent or more of all </I><I>their drain system components to have not emitted excess emissions for the most recent 12 months.</I></UL>
<P> Copies of the proposed revisions were also made available to the public.  The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from the following individuals in support of PAR 1176 as recommended by staff:
<P>RON WILKNISS, Western States Petroleum Association
<BR>LEE WALLACE, Southern California Gas Company
<BR>GAIL RUDERMAN FEUER, Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)
<BR>TIM CARMICHAEL, Coalition for Clean Air
<P> There being no further public testimony, the hearing was closed.  Staff distributed to Board members copies of a Revised Resolution for PAR 1176 which incorporated the two revisions recommended.
<UL><P>ON MOTION OF MR. LOVERIDGE, SECONDED BY MR. BRAUDE, A UNANIMOUS VOTE WAS CAST BY THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent: Soto), ADOPTING RESOLUTION NO. 96-17, CERTIFYING THE FINAL SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND AMENDING RULE 1176, AS RECOMMENDED AND REVISED BY STAFF TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:<UL>
<P><I>(1)  revisions to Subparagraphs (c)(16) and (i)(5)(F) proposed by staff to clarify the meaning of non-contact water and the exempted equipment subject to Rule 1173 (Fugitive Emissions of VOCs), respectively; and</I>
<P><I>(2)  revisions to Subparagraphs (c)(8)(A), (d)(2)(C) and (f)(1)(A)(ii) proposed by WSPA to reduce the monitoring frequency of  (I) drain </I><I>system components that have been demonstrated for 24 months to be non-emitting  and (ii) low-emitting drain system components from facilities that have demonstrated 99.5 percent or more of all their drain system components to have not emitted excess emissions for </I><I>the most recent 12 months.</I></UL></UL>
<P>33. Amend Rule 1171 - Solvent Cleaning Operations
<P> Anupom Ganguli, Planning and Rules Manager, presented the staff report.  Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance read into the record excerpts from the following correspondence received by staff:
<P><UL><LI> a letter dated September 12, 1996 to the Board from Cal-EPA by CARB Executive Officer Michael P. Kenny, supporting PAR 1171 and expressing their belief that the VOC emission reductions from the proposed amended rule are a critical step in maintaining progress in meeting AQMD&#146;s SIP commitments;

<P><LI> a letter dated September 12, 1996 from David P. Howekamp, Director of USEPA&#146;s Region IX Air and Toxics Division, commending AQMD for its recognition of the current technology in low-VOC aqueous solvents and the availability and effectiveness of such cleaning materials for repair and maintenance cleaning; and

<P><LI> a letter from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles Region, offering its cooperation on the proposed amendments, with the understanding that AQMD will work with publicly-owned treatment work facilities to eliminate any potential water quality impacts, involve the regional board, the L.A. County Department of Public Works, and other interested municipalities in an outreach and public education program, work to facilitate the development of recycling industries for aqueous cleaning systems, and offer the services of AQMD inspectors to distribute water quality, pretreatment, and other educational material during inspections of facilities.
</UL><P> Ms. Leyden brought attention to additional information on the socioeconomic assessment, which was distributed to Board members and made available to the public, and pointed out minor corrections to the cover page for that addition.  Board members were also provided copies of:  (i) an Addendum to the Resolution for PAR 1171, which contained a commitment by staff to work with the California Trucking Association on a study of the implementation of the Rule; and (ii) an expanded set of minutes from the August 23, 1996 Stationary Source Committee meeting, at which time demonstrations of a number of aqueous cleaning technologies were presented.
<P> The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from the following individuals:
<P>STEPHANIE WILLIAMS, California Trucking Association (CTA)
<P> Commented that because CTA learned about PAR 1171 late in the process, it has not yet been reviewed by their environmental policy committee.  Therefore, CTA will remain neutral on the proposed amended rule until after the study is completed.

<P>*Submitted Written Comments
<P> In summary, testimony was presented that safe, non-toxic aqueous industrial cleaners for parts and equipment have been available for many years.  These cleaners generate significantly less bulk waste than solvent-based cleaners, and are more cost effective.  Also automatic cleaners are less labor intensive than cleaning by hand, and can therefore reduce costs. Aqueous cleaning is a viable alternative to solvent cleaning, however it requires a more complex process, which includes education of the enduser on how to use these products to avoid such things as corrosion and to deal with appropriate wastewater treatment.  There are a variety of different filtration systems available, including high quality cleaners equipped with rust inhibitors.  These systems can reduce non-hazardous waste generated by up to 99 percent.  Printing Industries of California indicated their agreement to fund a study, to be performed by the Graphic Arts Technical Foundation, regarding the viability of using acetone in blending with cleanup solvents.
<P> Representatives for the water and sanitation districts expressed concern that there could be a negative impact on water quality and the local cities&#146; ability to meet discharge limits caused by the discharging of aqueous cleaners into the sewer, the quantity and quality of which has not yet been defined.  They expressed support for the proposed amendments, with a commitment from AQMD and the Regional Water Quality Board to help mitigate any problems of wastewater impacts due to Rule 1171.
<P> The following exemption was proposed by Shepherd Machinery, and agreed to by staff, for the cleaning of engines and associated equipment which is repaired in the field at customer sites:
<P><UL><I>&quot;(h)</I><I> </I><I>Exemptions</I>
<P><UL><I>(9) <U> The requirements of clause (c)(1)(B)(i) shall not apply until January 1, 2001, for field handwipe cleaning operations, provided solvent cleaning products containing no more than 900 grams of VOCs per liter with a VOC composite partial pressure of 20 mm Hg @ 68 F are used for field handwipe cleaning operations until such time.  Field handwipe cleaning operations means cleaning  operations conducted in areas located at least 1,000 feet outside the operator&#146;s facility boundary, for the repair of mobile equipment, non-road equipment, and </U></I><I><U>other internal combustion engine driven equipment including, but not limited to </U></I><I><U>buses, trucks, tractors, forklifts, pumps, and heavy duty construction equipment.&quot;</U></I></UL>

<P>*Submitted Written Comments
<P> In summary, the following concerns were expressed:
<P><UL><LI> With the adoption of PAR 1171, uninformed people will dump potentially hazardous waste into the public sewage system; and the contaminated sewage could possibly end up in the ocean without being properly processed.
<P><LI> Expressing concern that  (i) many small users of remote cold cleaning equipment may abandon the recycling of cleaners which  has been done for the past several years and return to dumping dirty solvents into the sewer or onto the ground,  and (ii) the exempt use of aerosol spray cleaners will emit greater VOCs than the remote cold cleaners, the Small Business Coalition requested<B> </B>an exemption from PAR 1171 for remote cold reservoirs using VOC cleaners; or a delay in adoption of the relevant portion of PAR 1171 to allow the Coalition the opportunity to work with AQMD staff on an equitable solution.
<P><LI> Expressing concern that  (i) 75 percent of its customers were not aware of the proposed amendments to Rule 1171 until Safety-Kleen informed them within the past two weeks;  (ii) there is significant evidence that aqueous cleaning would not work, or would not work without enhancements such as aerosols;  and (iii) there would be a significant cost to immediately impose such a dramatic change on small businesses, Safety-Kleen Corporation urged the Board to adopt a resolution providing for a &quot;manufacturer&#146;s bubble&quot;, whereby Safety-Kleen would remove the burden of compliance from the enduser and assume the responsibility for assuring that emissions from its 27,000 remote reservoir cold cleaners were equal to or  less than a 2 tons-per-day VOC emissions cap, with a commitment on the part of Safety-Kleen to undertake a study over the next year, funded by Safety-Kleen and entered into jointly with AQMD and an independent party to verify whether or not 2 tons per day is the appropriate level.  Barring adoption of such a resolution, Safety-Kleen urged the Board to postpone consideration of the portion of PAR 1171 that imposes a 50-grams-per-liter VOC limit on remote reservoir cold cleaners until such time as Safety-Kleen and AQMD staff have had additional time to determine whether or not an alternative proposal can be developed.
<P><LI> Automotive industry representatives expressed concerns regarding  (i) acetone not being an adequate replacement for solvents used for automotive parts and equipment because of its flammability characteristics;  (ii) aqueous washers being too cumbersome and requiring significantly more cleaning time than conventional solvents;  and (iii) parts discoloration that may be linked to corrosion, thereby causing concerns with consumer safety impacts from possible parts breakage due to corrosion.  Industry representatives urged the Board to defer the proposed amendments to Rule 1171 for at least six months, to allow California Motorcar Dealers Association and Orange County Motorcar Dealers Association to complete a pilot program testing the performance of aqueous systems in dealership service departments.</UL>
<P> The Board recessed for lunch at 12:05 p.m, during which time the following closed session item was considered:</UL>
<P><B>CLOSED SESSION</B>
<P><UL>34. Closed Session to Consider Pending or Potential Litigation and Personnel Matters
<P> The Board recessed to closed session, pursuant to Government Code Section 54957.6, to confer with its Labor Negotiators, Nick Nikkila and Charles Goldstein, regarding salaries and benefits of represented and unrepresented employees.  Employee Organizations are San Bernardino Public Employees Association and Teamsters Local 911.
<BR>(Mr. Antonovich left at 12:42 a.m.)
<P> The Board reconvened at 12:42, and resumed the public hearing on Agenda Item No. 33.</UL>
<P><B>PUBLIC HEARINGS (Continued)</B>
<P><UL>33. Amend Rule 1171 - Solvent Cleaning Operations
<P> Public testimony continued, and there was strong opposition expressed by NRDC and industry representatives to the manufacturer&#146;s bubble alternative proposed by Safety-Kleen Corporation, primarily because of the availability and proven effectiveness of aqueous cleaners for all types of applications and the successful use of these aqueous cleaners and alternatives by many companies.
<BR>(Mr. Silva left at 1:10 p.m.)
<P> Mr. Carroll readdressed the Board to clarify Safety-Kleen&#146;s position, and to bring attention to resolution language developed jointly by AQMD staff and Safety-Kleen that was provided to Board members.  The proposed language provides for a manufacturer&#146;s bubble that could be used by Safety-Kleen, or any other company, that would give them an allocation equivalent to the emission reductions sought in the staff report-- 2.8 tons per day, and would allow the companies to operate under that emissions cap, using aqueous solutions or solvent based solutions.
<P> There being no further testimony, the public hearing was closed.

<P>THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MR. PAULITZ.</UL>
<P> Ms. Haggard questioned the reason for Board members not supporting inclusion of the amendments to Rule 1171 proposed by Safety-Kleen, given the fact that staff was amenable to including those amendments.
<P> Chairman Mikels responded that among those who supported the proposed amended rule there was significant opposition expressed to any bubbling within the rule, in terms of its impact on energizing the aqueous or water-based cleaner industry.
<P><UL>THE MOTION BY MS. LEE PASSED BY THE FOLLOWING VOTE:

<P><b>Proposal:</b><blockquote> Approve Compensation Package for 
  Appointee to Designated Deputy Position</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> The recruitment for Director of Planning &amp; Policy has been completed and Melvin D. Zeldin has been selected.  This action is to approve the compensation package for this Designated Deputy position.</blockquote>
<P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote> Administrative, September 20, 1996, Recommended for Approval</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action:</b><blockquote>
Approve the compensation package for Designated Deputy Melvin D. Zeldin, effective October 11, 1996, and authorize the Executive Officer to execute an Executive Management Agreement with Melvin D. Zeldin, for a term from October 11, 1996, through January 31, 2000.</blockquote>
<P>      James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br>      Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background:</B>
<P>Senior management appointees within the classification of Designated Deputy serve at the pleasure of the Executive Officer under an Executive Management contract.  The designated deputy position of Director of Planning &amp; Policy became vacant in May 1996 when Dr. Chung Liu was appointed as Assistant Deputy Executive Officer for Technology Advancement.  In keeping with our general hiring freeze, I authorized 
<BR>recruitment to fill the Director of Planning &amp; Policy position only on an internal, promotional basis.  I have approved Barry Wallerstein&#146;s appointment of our PM<SUB>10</SUB> Manager, Melvin D. Zeldin to this position, effective October 11, 1996, at an annual salary of $91,000.  
<P>Melvin Zeldin has over 25 years of experience in air quality analysis and management, beginning in 1971 with the San Bernardino County APCD, and is a leading national expert on PM<SUB>10</SUB> issues.  He has broad scientific and technical experience in both the public and private sectors, and is the author of over 35 published articles and technical reports.  Since 1988 he has been an appointed member to CARB&#146;s Research Screening Committee.  He also is:  a selected member of the US EPA&#146;s ongoing FACA [ Federal Advisory Committee Act]  Subcommittee Working Group for ozone, particulates, and regional haze; the chair of the BACM [ Best Available Control Measures]  Working Group since its inception in 1993; a member of the WESTAR [ Western States Air Resources Council]  PM<SUB>10</SUB> Committee; and a participant in the STAPPA/-ALAPCO [ State & Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators/Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officers]  PM<SUB>10</SUB> Committee.  Mr. Zeldin has also had the overall project management responsibility for the development and implementation of the AQMD&#146;s Rule 403 and the Coachella Valley PM<SUB>10</SUB> Plans for 1991, 1994 and 1997, and the 1997 AQMP.  
<P>In his capacity as Director of Planning &amp; Policy, Melvin Zeldin will supervise 57 staff members with the responsibility of managing four key program functions:  Air Quality Modeling and Mobile Source Strategies; Emissions Inventory Analysis; PM<SUB>10</SUB> Strategies and Air Quality Analysis; and Socioeconomic Environmental Analysis.  A major responsibility of Planning and Policy is to develop and analyze the impacts of proposed strategies for attaining state and federal air quality standards, which are included in the periodic revisions of the AQMP.  Other significant responsibilities of this division are the assessment of potential socioeconomic impacts of rules, programs and air quality plans and the implementation of CEQA.
<P><B>Proposal:</B>
<P>Approve the compensation package for Melvin Zeldin as Director of Planning &amp; 
<BR>Policy, effective October 11, 1996.
<P><B>Resource Impacts:</B>
<P>There are sufficient funds in the FY 1996-97 Budget.

</TD><TD>The proposed rule will take the first step of a two-step approach
to
potential flare emissions reduction by gathering data on flaring operations
at petroleum refineries to assess the need for, or the level of, any future
controls to reduce flare emissions.  This first step will require refineries
to monitor flaring activities for the amount and composition of gases being
flared.  If the data demonstrates a need to control flaring operations, step
two of the rule will be to develop specific control requirements to reduce
flare emissions.

<P>Staff participated in the activities, programs and events listed below.  A statistical report of these activities also is included.
<P>Contact: La Ronda V. Bowen, Public Advisor, 909.396.3235
<P><B>BUSINESS OUTREACH</B>
<P>ORANGE COUNTY HEALTH CARE AGENCY&#146;S ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY UPDATE - AQMD staff spoke to more than 100 business owners describing the new AQMP and several new rules that would affect small businesses.
<P>RULE 1171 TASK FORCE - AQMD staff participated in the discussion and development of outreach plans that would be necessary to publicize the need for switching from petroleum-based solvents to water-based systems for parts cleaning. 
<P><B>COMMUNITY OUTREACH</B>
<P>PUBLIC MEETING - AQMD staff provided support staff to SSC for the coordination of a public meeting at which more than 350 people commented on an AQMD permit issued to the LAXT coal and coke terminal in San Pedro.
<P>KIDS CARE FAIRS - This year the AQMD co-sponsored the fairs held at 35 sites between Augugust 17 and 24.  The 1996 Kids Care Fairs offered vision and dental screenings, immunizations and information about public health services for communities. The District provided air quality information and materials for each site and staffing at 10 sites.
<P>SMOGBUSTERS CLUB UPDATE - Nearly 2,500 students have now joined the AQMD&#146;s Smogbusters Club and received the latest Smogbusters Activity Sheet in August.  The goal of the Club is to promote the voluntary reduction of air pollution through education and providing information.  The Smogbusters Club was initiated for 9-12-year-olds during the summer of 1994 by the creation and distribution of the Smogbuster Activity Book.  Since then, four quarterly activity sheets have been mailed to members, featuring experiments, class projects and updates.  Public Advisor staff facilitated the mailings and coordinates the membership activities.

<P><B><U>SECTION III - SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES</U></B>
<P>This month, the program is highlighting AQMD efforts to increase permitting and compliance assistance at field locations throughout the air basin.  A statistical report of business assistance activities is also included.
<P>Contact        Lee Lockie, Director, (909)396 - 2390
<P><B><U>PERMIT ASSISTANCE CENTER MARKETING PLANS</U></B>
<P>In January, the Office of the Public Advisor assumed responsibility for providing staff support to the seven Permit Assistance Centers.  Technical staff support is provided from the Small Business Assistance Office.
<P>To assure that businesses make the best use of these field locations, individual resource and marketing plans have been developed for each center.  Prior to completion of these plans, each center recently received communications support in the form of computers, modems, and upgraded software to allow access to headquarters&#146; databases and e-mail.  In these plans, staff members have identified area-specific strategies for improving technical assistance and business awareness of the nearest field permit assistance center.
<P>Attachment 1 shows the signs that are displayed at most of the centers which direct the public to the AQMD hotline on days when staff members are not present at the centers.   Attachment 2 shows the volume of permit activity at each of the permit assistance centers.  Attachment 3 is a compilation of marketing plans from each permit assistance center.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This report provides for the Board's consideration a
listing of CEQA documents received by the AQMD between August
2, 1996 and September 3, 1996, and those projects for which the
AQMD is acting as lead agency pursuant to CEQA.

 James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>
 Executive Officer
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
<B>EIR and Document Log (Attachments A and B)</B> - Each month,
the AQMD receives numerous CEQA documents from other public agencies
on projects which could adversely affect air quality.  A listing
of all documents received for review during the past month is
contained in Attachment A.  Monthly listings which are shaded
note those CEQA documents for which the AQMD staff has or will
prepare and submit comments to the lead agency.  A list of active
projects from previous months for which AQMD staff is continuing
to evaluate or prepare comments is included as Attachment B. 
The column captioned &quot;Public Concerns&quot; identifies parties
who have contacted the AQMD with concerns or issues about the
proposed project.  A notation of 1 in this column indicates the
contact was supportive of the project noted.  A notation of 2
indicates the party was opposed or expressed concerns about the
project.  A notation of 3 indicates that no one contacted the
AQMD about that project.
<P>
In the past, AQMD staff routinely reviewed many of these documents
and commented upon the air quality analyses and possible impacts
on the air quality of the district.  Due to staffing constraints,
the AQMD is no longer able to routinely comment on all CEQA documents
received.  Publication of the Board-approved <I>CEQA Air</I> <I>Quality
Handbook</I>, however, has provided local governments and other
public agencies with the necessary information to prepare appropriate
air quality analyses on projects for which they act as lead agency.
 As resources permit, staff evaluates and may prepare comments
for projects that may have significant adverse regional air quality
impacts (e.g., special event centers, landfills, etc.) and those
projects for which a lead or responsible agency has specifically
requested AQMD review.
<P>
<B>AQMD Lead Agency Projects (Attachment C)</B> - Pursuant to
CEQA, the AQMD periodically acts as lead agency on stationary
source permit projects.  Under CEQA the lead agency is responsible
for determining whether an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) or
a Negative Declaration is necessary for any proposal considered
to be a &quot;project&quot; as defined by CEQA.  An EIR is prepared
when the AQMD as lead agency finds substantial evidence that the
proposed project may have a significant adverse effect on the
environment.  A Negative Declaration may be prepared if the AQMD
determines that the proposed project will not generate significant
adverse environmental impacts.  The Negative Declaration is a
written statement describing the reasons a proposed project will
not have a significant adverse effect on the environment and,
therefore, does not require the preparation of an EIR.
<P>
Attachment C to this report summarizes the active projects for
which the AQMD is lead agency and is currently preparing or has
prepared environmental documentation.  As noted in Attachment
C, through August 1996, the AQMD certified the CEQA documents
for one (1) project and continued working on CEQA documents for
three (3) active projects.
<P>
To date in 1996, the AQMD, as lead agency, prepared or contracted
for the preparation of and certified four (4) CEQA documents.

<P>The proposed update to the Technology Advancement Plan for the AQMD&#146;s Clean Fuels Program outlines planned project expenditures for FY 1996-97 in accordance with Health and Safety Code 40448.5.1.  This legislation requires that research, development, and demonstration projects for vehicle applications within the AQMD&#146;s Clean Fuels Program do not duplicate the efforts of specified organizations.  Based on communications with these organizations, staff has determined that the proposed projects are not duplicative.  The Plan will be updated periodically to reflect new developments..

<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer



<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Achieving federal and state clean air standards in Southern California will require emission reductions from both mobile and stationary sources beyond those available from current technologies.  The AQMP relies on the expedited, future implementation of cleaner-burning fuels and advanced technologies in Southern California to achieve these standards.  To meet the needs of the AQMP for progressively lower-emitting fuels and technologies, the AQMD adopted a Clean Fuels Program in 1988 and established the Technology Advancement office to administer the program.  Concurrently, the State Legislature authorized funds for the AQMD&#146;s Clean Fuels Program via SB 2297 and subsequently renewed this funding authorization via SB 316 in 1993.
<P>The primary goal of the Clean Fuels Program is to assist private industry in the rapid development and deployment of progressively lower-emitting technologies and clean fuels.  Since the program&#146;s inception in 1988, the AQMD has cosponsored more than 250 projects involving low and zero emission technologies.  Funding partners in the program have included private industry, technology developers, academic institutions, research institutions, and government agencies.  This public-private partnership has enabled the AQMD to leverage its public funds with outside investment in a ratio of more than $4 of outside funding to every $1 of AQMD funding.
<P>Health and Safety Code (H&amp;SC) Section 40448.5.1 requires that the AQMD adopt a plan that describes the expected cost and benefits of proposed projects prior to any Clean 
<BR>Fuels Program expenditure after January 1, 1996 and find that the proposed projects do not duplicate programs of specified organizations.  The initial submittal of the required plan was adopted by the Board at its March 8, 1996 meeting.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>The attached Update to the Technology Advancement Plan for the Clean Fuels Program is the second submittal of the required plan.  This update identifies potential projects to be funded during FY 1996-97.  The proposed projects reflect new promising low- and zero-emission technologies and applications that have emerged since the initial submittal.  This update includes a number of proposed projects, not all of which are expected to be funded in the current fiscal year given the available budget.  Projects not funded in FY 1996-97 may be considered for funding in subsequent fiscal years.
<P>The AQMD&#146;s Technology Advancement program is supported by revenues from several sources.  The principal revenue source is the Clean Fuels Program, which, under H&amp;SC Section 40448.5 and Vehicle Code Section 9250.11, establishes mechanisms to collect revenues from mobile and stationary sources to support the program&#146;s objectives, albeit with constraints on the use of the funds.  Technology advancement efforts are also supported by grants and cost-sharing revenue contracts from various government agencies, such as the EPA and DOE, on a project specific basis.  Another potential source to fund the development and demonstration of advanced clean air technologies is the Advanced Technology Fund.  This fund was established primarily as a trust fund for revenues received as a result of fines, penalties, and settlements from air pollution violations.  Although not required by legislation, but in an attempt for completeness, the proposed Update to the Technology Advancement Plan includes some projects that may be funded by revenue sources other than the Clean Fuels Program.  For example, there are several proposed projects that address the development of technologies that would reduce VOC and PM emissions from various stationary source applications, including restaurants.  These projects are essentially efforts designed to specifically address the technology advancement needs related to Federal Clean Air Act Section 182(e)(5), as delineated in the 1997 AQMP Revision.
<P>Not all projects identified in this plan are expected to be recommended for funding.  Projects in the plan that are deemed ready will be presented individually to the Board for review and approval.  At that time, additional details will be provided about the technology to be demonstrated, the intended application, the proposed scope of work, the capabilities of the selected contractor and project team, and how the project will be cost-shared by various parties.
<P>The proposed update is the result of a comprehensive planning and review process.  This process has included consideration of AQMP control measures and coordination activities involving outside organizations.  This update has also been reviewed by an external panel of experts, listed in Table 1.  Based on communications with the organizations specified in H&amp;SC Section 40448.5.1 and review of their programs, the projects proposed in this update do not appear to duplicate any past or present projects.  As each individual project is recommended to the Board for funding, staff will continue to coordinate with these organizations to ensure that duplication is avoided.

<P> <B>WHEREAS</B>, recent amendments to the Clean Fuels Program by the addition of Health and Safety Code Section 40448.5.1 now require the AQMD to do both of the following prior to expending funds for research, development, and demonstration projects after January 1, 1996:
<P>1. Adopt and include in the Clean Fuels Program a plan describing proposed project expenditures, including expected costs and benefits.
<P>2. Find that the proposed program and projects will not duplicate any other past or present program or project funded by organizations specified in H&amp;SC Section 40448.5.1; and
<P> <B>WHEREAS</B>, a Technology Advancement Plan for the Clean Fuels Program that contained the required descriptions of proposed project expenditures, expected costs, and expected benefits was adopted by the Governing Board on March 8, 1996; and,
<P><B> </B><B>WHEREAS</B>, the AQMD has updated the Technology Advancement Plan for the Clean Fuels Program to reflect technological progress and a new fiscal year budget; and,
<P> <B>WHEREAS</B>, the AQMD has contacted the organizations specified in H&amp;SC Section 40448.5.1 and reviewed their programs and projects and has determined that the proposed projects in the update to the Technology Advancement Plan for the Clean Fuels Program do not duplicate any past or present projects; and,
<P> <B>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED</B>, that the Board adopts an update to the Technology Advancement Plan and includes it in the Clean Fuels Program; and,
<P> <B>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED</B>, that the Board finds that the proposed projects and programs in the update of the Technology Advancement Plan for the Clean Fuels Program do not duplicate any past or present projects or programs funded by specified organizations; and,
<P> <B>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED</B>, that staff is directed to periodically update the Technology Advancement Plan for the Clean Fuels Program to be as responsive as possible to technological advances and breakthroughs.

<P> Candace Haggard, Chairperson
<BR>Mobile Source Committee

<P><HR>
<P><B>ATTENDANCE:
<p>  </B>Present were Committee Chairperson Candace Haggard, Committee Vice Chair Nell Soto (left 11:28 a.m.), and Committee Member Ronald Loveridge (arrived 9:53 a.m.).  In the absence of Committee Members Mee Hae Lee and Marvin Braude, and pursuant to the Procedures for Standing Committees of the Governing Board, adopted March 8, 1996, Board Chairman Jon Mikels appointed himself and Councilman Leonard Paulitz (arrived 11:00 a.m.) ad hoc Members of the Mobile Source Committee for the meeting September 27, 1996 only.  Attachment 1 is an attendance roster.
<P><B>MOBILE SOURCE COMMITTEE DISCUSSION ITEMS</B>
<P><B>1.</B><B> </B><B><U>Legislative Update</U></B>
<P> Staff gave a legislative update (Attachment 2) and a status report on interim legislative hearings (Attachment 3) which are scheduled during the months of September through January 1997.  The legislative session ended August 31, 1996.  Senate Bill 836 (Lewis) is expected to be signed by the Governor, but there has been no action as of yet.  If the Governor does not sign the bill by September 30, 1996, it becomes law.  Staff stated that Governor Wilson vetoed Assembly Bill 2282 (Knox), indicating the Governor&#146;s intent to retain Higher Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes for multi-passenger vehicles and continue to utilize the HOV lanes as a congestion management tool.  The bill would have allowed solo drivers with certified Lower Emissions Vehicles (LEVs) or electric vehicles to use the HOV lanes.
<P> Board Chairman Mikels briefed committee members on the recently held Senate Local Government Committee interim hearing on AB 3248 (Napolitano).  Mr. Mikels stated that the hearing focused on the independent ombudsman position and the fiscal impact of both the Assemblywoman&#146;s proposal and the AQMD&#146;s recommended administrative alternatives in lieu of legislation.
<P> Staff advised that Senate Natural Resources Committee Chairman Tom Hayden intends to hold a hearing in the near future* to discuss PM<SUB>10</SUB> issues.  (*tentatively scheduled for October 28 in Los Angeles, exact location to be determined)
<P><B>2.</B> <B><U>Attorney General Opinion Re:  Rule 2202</U></B>
<P> Staff gave a presentation on the Office of the Attorney General&#146;s conclusions regarding Rule 2202.  (This opinion is provided as an attachment to the Legislative Committee report.)  Through the Air Resources Board, the AQMD asked the Attorney General two questions:  1) can an Air Pollution Control District (APCD) adopt a regulation to require emissions reductions where one of the options is to implement an employee trip reduction plan?; and 2) can an APCD adopt a regulation requiring parking subsidy equivalency program, mandated by state law, as part of an employee trip reduction plan?
<P> On September 16, 1996, the Attorney General concluded that an APCD does have the authority to require an emissions reduction regulation for employers which includes a trip reduction option.  The Attorney General concluded that a parking subsidy equivalency program could not be required by an APCD.  Under the Health &amp; Safety Code, the Air Resources Board is the only governmental agency that has the authority to mandate such a program.  Staff stated that they will ask the ARB to adopt language so that credit can be given in the SIP for parking subsidy programs as a backstop rule.  It will ultimately be EPA&#146;s decision if California can obtain such credit.
<P> Carla Walecka of Carla Walecka Planning asked staff who was responsible for implementation of the 1997 AQMP control measures and contingency measures related to Parking Cashout.  Staff stated that the implementation component of the draft 1997 AQMP will have to be refined to reflect the Attorney General&#146;s opinion.  
<P><B>3.</B><B> </B><B>SB 836 (Lewis) Effects on Rule 2202</B>
<P> Staff gave an overview on the impacts of recently passed SB 836 (Lewis) and reported that Rule 2202 will be amended in accordance with the new law and will incorporate language specified in the law.  A public workshop is scheduled October 9, 1996 with the final draft rule going to the Governing Board on November 8, 1996.  Staff stated that approximately 63% of Rule 2202 work sites will fall out of the rule on January 1, 1997.  Staff indicated that on an annual basis, AQMD will appropriate $1.5 million to the Regional Transportation Agencies Coalition (RTAC).  For the first two years the money will be taken from AQMD&#146;s small business assistance fund.  Ms. Soto asked staff if the $1.5 million rideshare project was duplicative of Southern California Rideshare&#146;s current program.  Staff responded by stating that the monies must be used as an enhancement to existing activities occurring in the Basin and it will be RTAC&#146;s responsibility to determine how the monies will be dispersed.
<P> In response to Board Chairman Mikels&#146; inquiry regarding the composition of RTAC, staff stated that RTAC (Attachment 4) consists of executive directors and members of the Boards from transportation commissions, associations of governments and Caltrans.  Staff further stated that RTAC meets on a monthly basis to provide transportation commissions with the opportunity to address inter-county issues; that AQMD is an ex-officio non-voting member of RTAC; that the RTAC makes intermittent reports to SCAG&#146;s Regional Advisory Council&#146; and that the RTAC Rideshare Subcommittee will recommend how the monitoring and tracking methodology for voluntary ridesharing will be developed, based upon the results of a contracted study by experts in that area.  
<P> Ms. Soto asked how funds are allocated for ridesharing services.  Staff responded that ridesharing services are provided by SCAG which secures funding from Caltrans.  Ms. Soto stated that it appears that there are several agencies who are providing the same type of services.  Mr. Mikels stated that RTAC has the monies and SCAG is part of RTAC.  Ms. Soto asked why the AQMD doesn&#146;t have any input.  Mr. Mikels asked how RTAC originated, how RTAC&#146;s authority is established, and if RTAC has the ability to legally execute contracts.  Mr. Mikels stated that he believes that RTAC has no legal authority to execute contracts and that the committee would have to designate an agency to oversee the contract process.  Mr. Mikels also asked if RTAC had any bylaws.  Jim Ortner of the Orange County Transportation Authority stated that the committee meets under an agreement among the participating agencies and that there is no formal written bylaws.  Mr. Mikels asked if the Imperial Valley Association of Governments (IVAG) votes on AQMD issues.  Jim Ortner stated that this is a policy issue and it is currently being evaluated.  Mr. Mikels stated that if the revenue is being generated within the Basin, there may be a statutory issue regarding IVAG and Ventura County Transportation Commission participation regarding how monies are possibly spent outside of the area.
<P> Staff distributed a draft letter that is scheduled to be sent out to Rule 2202 employers.  The letter outlines the provisions of the new law and an information sheet that will address various implementation aspects of the rule.  The AQMD is proposing to refund prorated portions of Air Quality Investment Programs funds.  In response to a request by Ms. Soto, staff stated that the letter and the information sheet will be sent to all employers currently subject to Rule 2202 as well as local governments, leagues of cities, and special local government organizations.  Staff indicated that employers will have the option of purchasing MSERCs if they do not wish to survey their employees as part of their plan submittal to the AQMD.  Jim Lantry (sponsor of SB 836 - Lewis), representing the California Retail Air Quality Coalition, wrote a letter to the RTAC Technical Advisory Committee proposing that perhaps the AQIP funds not be refunded so that voluntary ridesharing could count those emissions credits towards emissions equivalencies.
<P> Carol Gomez of Hughes Electronics asked about the $1.5 million which will be given to the RTAC and where this money was coming from within the AQMD budget.  Staff stated that during the next two years, the money will come from the AQMD&#146;s small business assistance fund.  After 1999, the money will have to be taken from other programs within the AQMD.
<P><B> </B>John Owyang of Market-Based Solutions requested that staff prorate the evaluation fees for those smaller employers who elect to offer MSERCs for the remaining months of 1996.  Staff indicated that they will evaluate the scenario to determine what can be done to streamline and reduce employer costs, but that the registration fee covers the time of evaluating the registration.  Committee Member Loveridge moved (seconded by Ms. Soto and approved) to approve the draft letter and policies and direct staff to send it out to employers.  The fee question that Mr. Owyang asked will be dealt with on a separate occasion.  Ms. Haggard requested that staff include language to notify employers that they will be kept informed of other policy changes as they occur.  Staff advised the Committee that these policies would be placed in a rule amendment for Board approval.
<P><B>4.</B><B> </B><B>AQIP Status Report</B>
<P><B> </B>Staff gave an update on Second Quarter 1996 proposals and staff recommendations.  Staff has received RFP proposals from the following companies:  Santa Barbara Research for $849,701; Ecotek (SkoolPool) for $240,075 - $630,025; Traffic Assist for $372,280 - $628,703; Santa Monica TMA for $600,000; City of Santa Monica for $450,000; Ecology Auto Wrecking for $1,168,100; Market Based Solutions for $268,750 - $1,379,000; and Eco-Scrap for $919,590 - $1,379,902.  Based upon cost-effectiveness, staff is recommending funding to Ecology Auto Wrecking for $989,000 to obtain triennial MSERCs.  Staff also is recommending amending Ecology Auto Wrecking contract awarded for the First Quarter of 1996 for an additional $200,000.  Staff will be refunding approximately $1.4 million dollars to those employers that will be exempt effective January 1, 1997, pursuant to SB 836, leaving an ending balance of $189,000 that will be carried over to the Third Quarter of 1996.
<P><B>5.</B><B> </B><B>Progress Report on 1997 AQMP/PM</B><B><SUB>10</SUB></B><B> Task Force</B>
<P><B> </B>Staff gave a status report on the 1997 AQMP/PM<SUB>10</SUB> Task Force (Attachment 5).  Staff reported that since June 1995, there have been 20 meetings and over 150 participants involved in the PM<SUB>10</SUB> Task Force. The public comment period for the draft AQMP closed on September 24, 1996.  AQMP public hearings have been scheduled for October 21 through 24, 1996.  SCAG will be taking the AQMP to their Regional Council on November 7, 1996.  The AQMD Governing Board will hold a public hearing on November 8, 1996 to consider adoption of the AQMP.  Staff advised that approximately 30 letters regarding the AQMP have been received with most of them specifically commenting on a control measure and not the technical elements of the document.  Committee Member Loveridge asked if any comments were received from current or former members of the Advisory Council.  Staff indicated that they had not received any letters from the Advisory Council members but that Dr. Jane Hall, former Advisory Council member, was expected to attend the upcoming Socioeconomic meeting.  Staff stated that a key topic of discussion is the emissions budget for the year 2020.  SCAG has indicated that a 2020 emissions budget is not needed at this time.  Staff intends to retain the 2020 budget for reference purposes and will request that ARB not forward it to EPA.  
<P><B>6.</B><B> </B><B>Status Report on REACH Task Force</B>
<P><B> </B>Staff reported that the task force, which has two remaining meetings, has distributed a draft executive summary of REACH&#146;s Strategy Subcommittee, and an outline of pricing strategies and recommendations.  Staff stated that the latest survey highlighted congestion fees and pollution fees.  The preliminary results indicated that participants were slightly more favorable towards an emissions based approach rather than congestion fees.  The results also indicated that there was softer resistance towards the emission fee approach from the polled participants opposing these strategies, compared to the harder resistance towards the congestion fee approach.  Staff stated that future efforts will focus on HOT lanes and evaluating their effectiveness as well as pursuing the possibility of developing policy and pricing strategies.

<P>   Mee Hae Lee
<BR>   Chair, Stationary Source Committee
<P><HR>
<P><B>Attendance</B>
<P>The meeting was called to order at 10:50 a.m. by Committee Member Candace Haggard.  Also present was Committee Member Ron Loveridge.  Committee Chair Mee Hae Lee arrived at 11:00 a.m. and chaired the remainder of the meeting.  Board Chairman Jon Mikels was in attendance.
<P><B>Summary</B>
<P>The Committee reviewed the items on its agenda (attached, without its attachments).  Comments were noted on the following items:
<P><B>1. Streamlining Small Business Permits:</B>
<P> Jill Whynot gave a status report on Facility Registrations.  She explained that under the Board&#146;s Regulatory Reform Initiatives, the goal was to streamline 20,000 permits for small businesses; reduce permitting and increase registration; consolidate and simplify; and accelerate pre-approval of equipment.  Jill further explained the Three Tiers:  Tier 1 - No Permit Required; Tier 2 - Simple Registration; and Tier 3 - Small Business Facility Registration.
<P> Larry Bowen discussed Exemptions (Proposed Rule 219) with the Committee.  The rule intent is to exempt certain equipment categories from written permit.  He also told the Committee of Proposed Amended Rule 219 objectives and the nine equipment categories which would be removed from the permit system.  Two key changes include:  portable engines (subject to state registration) and CFC recycling equipment (subject to federal regulation).  Approximately 10,000 pieces of equipment will no longer need permits from the District, with a savings to industry of approximately $1.5 million.  The proposed rule is scheduled for Public Hearing at the December Board meeting.
<P><B>2. Rule 1113 - Architectural Coatings</B>
<P><B> </B>Jack Broadbent briefed the Committee on the long history of the rule, including why the rule was overturned in the Court the last time it went before the Board.  Jack reported that there has been significant technological improvement in architectural coatings, and lower VOC advances in wood lacquers and acetone-formulated traffic paints.  He also said the 1997 AQMP requires 75 percent reduction in VOC of all architectural coatings by 2010.  Current efforts being employed are:  an ad hoc working group of coating manufacturers and contractors; a study by Eastern Michigan University that addresses thinning and performance issues with specialty coatings; numerous site visits of zero-, low-, and high-VOC coating applications; and field inspections.  The Committee asked staff to continue to work with coating manufacturers on their concerns.  The rule will go before the Board in October.  The dates for implementation for proposed VOC limits are:  flats (interior and exterior), 100 g/l, July 1, 2001 and 50 g/l, July 1, 2008; traffic, 150 g/l, January 1, 1998; lacquers, 550 g/l, January 1, 1998 and 275 g/l, January 1, 2005; and multi-color, 250 g/l, January 1, 1998.
<P><B>3. Enhancements to Permit Processing System</B>
<P> A briefing was given by Alene Taber.  Starting October 1, staff will issue some permits over the counter.  Information for assisting applicants to obtain permits will be available at one location.  Checklists have been improved to increase the efficiency of application prescreening.  A table has been developed to easily link forms, rules, fees, and BCAT/CCAT information.  Additional assistance includes:  a new fee calculation worksheet; published application criteria; and amended criteria to distinguish and track 7/30/180-day permit applications.  She reported that Internet is being used now and will be used more in the future.  The program enhancements will begin October 1.  Committee Chair Mee Lee commented that she would like the full Board briefed on this program at the October meeting.
<P><B>4. Status Report on Compliance</B>
<P><B> </B>Carol Coy reported on trends in Stationary Source Compliance activities which included inspection stops, Notices of Violations (NOVs), and Notices to Comply (NCs) for both Major Sources and Small Sources.  The report was prepared to respond to an Advisory Council comment erroneously citing an absence of enforcement over the past 18 months.  Her statistics compared the years 1991-1995.  She pointed out the strengthened compliance program for Major Sources.  Inspections have decreased for small sources, largely because the AQMD has focused its compliance efforts for small business on education to minimize violations - and thus emissions - rather than issuing an NOV after the emission has occurred.  .  The Committee asked for this item to also be reported to the Board at the October meeting.
<P><B>5. Status Report on Petroleum Coke Storage</B>
<P> Bill Thompson reported on the petroleum coke storage meeting held August 17 in San Pedro.  Approximately 375 people attended the meeting to discuss uncovered coke piles at Los Angeles Export Terminal.  The permitting process and how the facility was permitted was discussed.  Compliance activities were discussed, and the group was advised that an inspector was in the area almost every day and that air quality in the area was not as disastrous as their perceptions indicated.  At this meeting, Pat Leyden suggested the formation of an advisory committee made up of the citizens in attendance that day.  This group first met on September 19.  Mr. Thompson reported that it was a very good meeting and that the committee members are gaining knowledge and, in particular, are learning that the particulates are not solely from the coke piles.  Two items from this meeting were (1) a decision to delay testing until May and (2) a recommendation to provide outreach information to the community.

<P>      Leonard Paulitz, Chairman
<BR>      Technology Committee
<P><HR>
<P><B>Attendance</B>
<P>Present were Committee Chairman Leonard Paulitz, Committee Vice Chair Jon Mikels,  and Committee Members Roy Wilson and Ron Loveridge.  Other attendees were as follows:
<P>Chung S. Liu, ADEO, Andy Abele, Mike Nazemi, Paul Wuebben, Jon Leonard, Maria Belknap, and Dory Kilgour - AQMD Technology Advancement; Bill Wong, AQMD District Counsel&#146;s Office; Sam Atwood, AQMD Press Office; Edric Guise, AQMD Board Member Assistant; Joe Borek, Ballard Power Systems; John Billheimer, Small Business Coalition.
<P><B>Ballard Zero-Emission Fuel Cell Bus Technical Briefing, Bus Demonstration, and Ride</B>
<P>Jon Leonard introduced a representative of Ballard Power Systems who gave a brief technical overview of the Phase 2 Ballard Fuel Cell bus.  AQMD co-sponsored the development and demonstration of this 40 foot zero-emission fuel cell bus.  The technical briefing was followed by an opportunity for all members to ride on the bus.
<P><B>Committee Topics</B>
<P><B>1.</B><B> </B><B>Adopt an Update of the Technology Advancement Plan for the Clean Fuels Program</B>
<P>The proposed update to the Technology Advancement Plan for the AQMD&#146;s Clean Fuels Program outlines planned project expenditures for FY 1996-97 in accordance with Health and Safety Code 40448.5.1.  This legislation requires that research, development, and demonstration projects for vehicle applications within the AQMD&#146;s Clean Fuels Program do not duplicate the efforts of specified organizations.  Based on communications with these organizations, staff has determined that the proposed projects are not duplicative.  The Plan will be updated periodically to reflect new developments. <I>The Committee reviewed the </I><I>information presented and noted their approval of staff&#146;s recommendation.</I>
<P><B>2.</B><B> </B><B>Provide Additional Funding for Technical Support of AQMD&#146;s Technology </B><B>Advancement Program</B>
<P>Since 1988, AQMD&#146;s Technology Advancement (TA) program has co-sponsored hundreds of development, demonstration, and research projects designed to expedite wide-scale use of progressively cleaner technologies and fuels.  To optimize the effectiveness of this program, it has been advantageous to supplement in-house technical resources and expertise with outside assistance.  A total of $151,500 in FY 1996-97 funding is proposed for four level-of-effort contracts to provide ongoing technical support for the TA program.  Two existing contracts will be amended and two new contracts will be executed.  <I>The </I><I>Committee reviewed the information presented and noted their approval of staff&#146;s </I><I>recommendation.</I>
<P><B>3.</B><B> </B><B>Receive Funds for the Return of a Kewet El-Jet Electric Vehicle</B>
<P>In June 1995, the Board approved the purchase of a Kewet El-Jet EV from Green Motorworks of North Hollywood.  This EV was purchased to be tested as a &quot;station car.&quot;  The staff has completed the tests and Green Motorworks offered to buy back the EV for 75% of the base purchase price, with the balance accounting for depreciation.  <I>The </I><I>Committee reviewed the information presented and noted their approval of staff&#146;s </I><I>recommendation.</I>
<P><B>4.</B><B> </B><B>Release Program Opportunity Notice (PON) for FY 1996-1997</B>
<P>Jon Leonard gave a brief overview of the draft PON, which is proposed for release in October.  The PON is a mechanism by which AQMD&#146;s Technology Advancement program generically announces that opportunities exist for funding of innovative, low- and zero-emission technologies.  Contractors are asked to submit brief pre-proposals about prospective technologies.
<P><B>5.</B><B> </B><B>Update on Fuel Cell Implementation Task Force</B>
<P>Jon Leonard reported on the meeting that took place on September 10, 1996.  This was the third meeting of the Task Force, and was attended by approximately 60 people.  The Task Force developed preliminary ideas on funding priorities for fuel cells and renewable energy technologies.
<P><B>Other Business</B>
<P>Paul Wuebben handed out brochures announcing the October 4, 1996 Workshop on Fuel Cells for Stationary Emergency Backup Power Applications.  This event will be held in the AQMD&#146;s auditorium from 8:30 a.m. to 12:15 p.m.
<P><B>Public Comment Period</B>
<P>John Billheimer, of the Small Business Coalition, suggested that in the Technology Advancement Plan clarification be made that Clean Fuels Program funds can only be used for mobile-source clean fuels R&amp;D.  Very limited funds are available for technology advancement work based on fees collected from stationary sources.

<P> Jon D. Mikels, Chair
<BR> Interagency AQMP Implementation Committee
<P><HR>
<P>The meeting was called to order at 1:10 p.m. by Chairman Jon Mikels.
<P><B>Approval of June 27, 1996, Minutes</B>
<P>Chairman Jon Mikels called for a motion to approve the June 27, 1996, IAIC meeting minutes.  <I>On motion by Council Member Pat McGuigan, and seconded by Council </I><I>Member Thomas Wilson, the June 27, 1996, meeting minutes were approved, as submitted.</I>
<P><B>Report by TAC Chairman on Technical Advisory Committee Meeting</B>
<P>TAC Chair Greg Adams, representing the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, reported that the TAC discussed the status of three items--proposed amendments to Rule 201 (Permit to Construct); proposed amendments to Rule 1171 (Solvent Cleaning Operations); and Title V (Federal Operating Permit Program).
<P><B>Proposed Amendments to Rule 201 (Permit to Construct)</B>
<P>Although Rule 201 will not delay interim approval, it remains a concern of the TAC.  However, the TAC will continue to work with staff and the Home Rule Working Group on these rule amendments, and is hopeful that its concerns will be resolved by early 1997.
<P><B>Title V (Federal Operating Permit Program)</B>
<P>The AQMD is awaiting interim approval from EPA of its Program.  However, because this approval process has taken longer than anticipated, the mailing of Title V permit applications has been delayed a few months until November 1997.  In addition, subject to approval of Regulation XXX revisions scheduled for January 1997 public hearing, the AQMD&#146;s Title V Program should include an initial universe of 1,000 facilities.  The TAC also discussed ramifications resulting from the lack of an approved Rule 430 in the Title V Program, but AQMD staff is confident that it will prevail in its discussions with EPA on the amendments for this rule.  Finally, in reply to the letter sent from the IAIC to 
<BR>Felicia Marcus and Mary Nichols regarding emergency provisions, and the re-promul-gation of Part 70 in early 1997, EPA&#146;s response merely reassured the Committee that it would work cooperatively to resolve any issues.
<P><B>Update on REACH Task Force </B>
<P>Mayor Robert Bartlett, representing SCAG, merely reported that the REACH Task Force continues to move forward in its efforts.
<P><B>Update on 1997 AQMP</B>
<P>Elaine Chang, AQMD Manager/Emissions Inventory &amp; Energy Analysis, provided a slide presentation on the Draft 1997 AQMP, including: 1996 ozone data; existing emission levels of key pollutants; emissions based on existing rules only at carrying capacity; what&#146;s new from the 1994 Ozone-only SIP, which forms the basis of the Draft 1997 AQMP; and which measures are contained in the plan and which were removed since the 1994 AQMP and why.  She also discussed further evaluation measures included in the blackbox and the potential new federal standards for ozone and particulate matter.
<P>Greg Adams wondered at what point can the region take credit for the ARB consumer product regulation.  Ms. Chang replied that ARB&#146;s measures have been adopted and the AQMD assumes that they will be implemented.  Consequently, those measures are included in the baseline.  For those ARB measures not yet adopted, the AQMD takes credit for them as control measures for demonstration purposes.
<P>Chairman Mikels asked if the state utilizes the 182(e)(5) measures, and to what extent in terms of comparing overall emissions are attributed to those in the blackbox.  Ms. Chang 
<P>replied yes; there are 182(e)(5) state measures.  All NO<SUB>x</SUB> 182(e)(5) emission reductions belong to the state measures; and for VOC about half of the 182(e)(5) emission reductions are attributed to the state measures.
<P>In light of the controversy surrounding the removal of control measures, Greg Adams wondered why some ISRs were not left in the plan rather than relying on 182(e)(5) further evaluation measures.  Ms. Chang replied that including a measure, which will likely never be adopted because of its high administrative costs and low emission reduction benefits, is not reasonable.  Thus, ISRs were removed.
<P><B>Discuss Proposed Amendments to Rule 1171 (Solvent Cleaning Operations)</B>
<P>Pat Leyden, AQMD DEO/Stationary Source Compliance, summarized the proposed amendments to Rule 1171, which is intended to reduce 20.5 tons per day of VOC emissions by 2010 by switching from VOC cleaners to primarily aqueous cleaners and is expected to result in a cost savings to businesses.  Ms. Leyden also responded to several issues of concern raised by the regulated community, including reactivity, water quality and hazardous waste impacts, the emission inventory debate with Safety-Kleen, and rule implementation for unpermitted area sources, which are included in the proposed amendments.  In conclusion, Ms. Leyden reviewed the public outreach program which will be launched after adoption of the amendments to specifically target the unpermitted sources.
<P><U>RECOMMENDATION:</U> Lillian Kawasaki (City of Los Angeles) suggested, and the IAIC members present concurred, that the Governing Board should include language that if water quality problems result from the rule amendments, the AQMD will revisit the rule and work with POTWs to resolve the problems.  
<P><B>Discuss Proposed Amendments to Rule 1176 (VOC Emissions from Wastewater </B>
<BR><B>Systems)</B>
<P>Mohsen Nazemi, AQMD Sr. Manager/Refineries, Energy &amp; OCS, explained the proposed amendments to Rule 1176, which is intended to reduce 3 tons per day of VOC emissions from further controls of drains and other components in the wastewater system at a cost-effectiveness of $600 per ton.  The concept is that emissions should be controlled from the point of entry until discharge into the municipal sewer lines, such that the rule should apply to every point where emissions could be released to the atmosphere.  The amendments also focus on facilities with a higher potential to emit, although bulk loading terminals have been exempted from the rule.  The two basic issues under debate have been:  1) how often to monitor; and 2) which sources should be controlled.  Regulated sources maintain that they should not have to control junction boxes.  Staff is proposing that all intermediate points of entry and endpoints should be controlled, and language is currently being worked out with the sanitation districts and water quality boards.  
<P><B>Discuss Proposed Amendments to Rule 219 (Equipment Not Requiring a Written Permit </B><B>Pursuant to Regulation II)</B>
<P>Jack Broadbent, AQMD Assistant DEO/Stationary Source Compliance, discussed proposed amendments to Rule 219, scheduled for public hearing December 1996. Under Chairman Mikels&#146; Business Clean Air Partnership initiative, these proposed amendments would include additional equipment under this rule which have been determined to emit negligible emissions or are regulated by another governmental agency.  The proposed amendments will result in removing 10,000 facilities from (or 12% of) the AQMD&#146;s permitting system.  This equipment includes portable ICEs and wastewater treatment operations to name a few.  Mr. Broadbent also provided a list of the equipment proposed for inclusion in Rule 219 along with the fees which small businesses will then be exempt from paying.  He concluded by noting that the first workshop on the proposed amendments is scheduled September 5, and active participation with small businesses is anticipated.
<P><U>RECOMMENDATION:</U>  In preparing its amendments, the TAC suggested that AQMD staff consider EPA&#146;s comment that it will evaluate line-by-line whether, in fact, the Rule 219 equipment has insignificant emission units associated with them.
<P><B>Report on Local Government Outreach Activities and Legislative Alert</B>
<P>Oscar Abarca, AQMD Intergovernmental Affairs Director, reported that an AQMP briefing to local elected officials would be held on Saturday, September 14, 8 am at AQMD Headquarters.  He also reported that the AB 2766 report on City Subvention Funds has been completed and will be considered by the AQMD Governing Board September 13.  <U>ACTION:</U>  The IAIC asked that it be provided a copy of the report and that its September 26 agenda include a discussion on strategies to protect the AB 2766 funds, especially the city and county portion in light of the continual balance of unspent funds.
<P><B>Update on Alternative Fuels/ZEV Mandate</B>
<P>In the absence of Council Member John Cox, Jennifer Kemp provided promotional materials for the Committee&#146;s information.
<P><B>Update on AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Process</B>
<P>The Committee was provided the latest written report prepared for the Governing Board on the AB 2766 Discretionary Fund Process.
<P><B>Monthly Progress Report on Public Advisor Office Activities</B>
<P>The agenda package included the Public Advisor's Monthly Activity Report ending July 1996 as well as the latest report on visiting dignitaries.  
<P><I>There being no public comment or further business, the IAIC meeting adjourned at </I><I>2:08 p.m.</I>

<P><HR>
<P><B>Minutes</B>
<P>The minutes of the August 22, 1996, monthly meeting were approved, as submitted.  These minutes are provided for your information as <I>Attachment 1</I>.  In addition, the <I>draft/unapproved</I> July 25, 1996, monthly meeting minutes are provided for your information as <I>Attachment 2</I>.  These minutes are in arrears and will be provided to the MSRC at its next meeting for approval.
<P><B>Zero-Emission Vehicle &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Program</B>
<P>As part of its $7 million Zero-Emission Vehicle &quot;Quick Charge&quot; Program, the MSRC released an RFP for its $1.675 million Corridor Community Program in mid-March.  The Corridor Community Program is intended to solicit the participation of general purpose local governments in a demonstration of electric vehicles and infrastructure within the South Coast Air District.  The demonstration will incorporate infrastructure, the permitting process, and coordination within and between communities, utilities and manufacturers necessary to facilitate the introduction of larger quantities of EVs.  Seven excellent proposals, soliciting $1.74 million, were received by the July 10 deadline.  The MSRC&#146;s EV Subcommittee is currently evaluating these proposals, and it is anticipated that we will be considering approval of participants in the Community Corridor Program at our December 13 Board meeting.  
<P><B>Receive and Approve Final Reports</B>
<P>The MSRC received and approved three final reports, as follows: 
<P> 
<P>1) Coachella Valley Association of Governments Contract #C94031, which provided $200,000 for implementing procedures for PM<SUB>10</SUB> control);
<P>2) Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority Contract #C94008, which provided $237,448 for a heavy-duty vehicle and engine correlation study; and
<P>3) Mike Kodama Contract #C95010, which provided $135,965 for parking management/local government research.
<P>All final reports for the AB 2766 Discretionary Program are filed in the AQMD's
<BR>Library.
<P><B>Contract Modification Requests</B>
<P>The MSRC took the following actions on requested contract modifications:
<P>1) Approval of a three-month contractual term extension, but <U>denial</U> of any cost increase for City of Compton Contract #C94044, which provides $396,750 for the conversion of heavy-duty vehicles to CNG;
<P>2) Approval of a 17-month contractual term extension, novation of contract to Waste Management of the Desert, and a scope change allowing the incremental cost of five new waste trucks and the repowering of nine heavy-duty trucks rather than repowering 14 heavy-duty waste trucks, for Waste Management of Orange County Contract #C95012, which provides $852,200 for the conversion of heavy-duty diesel powered trucks to natural gas and CNG fueling systems;
<P>3) Approval of a 15-month contractual term extension for City of Santa Clarita Contract #C95020, which provides $30,000 for the installation of bus stop information displays;
<P>4) Approval of a scope change to allow a combination smart-shuttle program providing a taxi link from both home to station and station to work while emphasizing the home to station link to increase ridership, for Diversified Paratransit Contract #C95023, which provides $25,000 for a taxi-link to Covina and Pomona Metrolink Stations;
<P>5) Approval of a scope change to allow electronic library and other services rather than the electronic banking project which has not proven viable for City of Glendale Contract #C94006, which originally provided $208,000 for an LNX systems electronic banking project; and 
<P>6) Approval of a scope change to restore the types of engines to be used for the street sweepers and waste haulers as originally proposed for the City of Newport Beach unexecuted FY 1995-97 Contract #C6036, which provides $500,000 for the purchase of five street sweepers and ten waste haulers.
<P>The MSRC also received and filed a report on &quot;Scope Changes Handled Administratively by the AQMD Contract Administrator.&quot;  This report included minor contract modifications for Los Angeles County MTA Contract #C94008, which provides $237,448 for a heavy-duty vehicle correlation study; and Echelon Industries Inc. Contract #C96016, which provides $321,200 to develop a fare transaction and vehicle management system.
<P><B>Contract Administrator Report</B>

<P>2. The minutes of the April 25, 1996, Advisory Council meeting were approved, as submitted.  
</blockquote>
<B>ACTION:</B>
<blockquote>
  The Committee ask that the secretary begin preparing a follow-up memo for staff&#146;s 
reference within two days following future Advisory Council meetings to ensure that action items are handled timely.
<P>3. Dr. Hazelwood explained that Arthur Winer and others had expressed concern about the location site changes/reductions of AQMD monitoring stations which they had briefly read about in the Governing Board&#146;s minutes.  Consequently, at the last meeting they had asked staff to discuss the issues surrounding the changes at the next meeting.  One concern was that the stations selected for shutdown would result in the loss of valuable information regarding compliance or lack of same.  
<P>Bill Fray, AQMD Director of Applied Science &amp; Technology, reported that the reasons for the streamlined air monitoring network plan are threefold:  1) economic in terms of resources; 2) the premise that the AQMD will be in attainment with all pollutants except Ozone by 2008; and 3) modernization of equipment using $1.3 million budgeted for this purpose.  If these assumptions are proven inaccurate, however, the network plan is sufficiently flexible to allow adjustments.  For instance, chart recorders will be replaced and networks installed at the monitoring stations for both voice and data communications, in part to allow for remote accessibility of information.  In addition, there will be one central maintenance area for repairs and calibration that cannot be performed onsite.  In addition, before the sites are closed, the AQMD will have purchased portable air monitoring stations which can be set up within 24 hours to perform special monitoring.  This builds in flexibility so monitoring can be performed at any location at any time.  Analysis will also be available on a second-by-second basis.  These changes will be accompanied by improved operating procedures and additional training, among other things.  However, some minimal manual sampling will still be needed.  To address this need, staff is being retrained to become multi-task specialists.  Mr. Fray reviewed the projected closure schedule through 2008, and concluded by adding that both EPA and ARB staff have reviewed and support the streamlined network plan.
<P>[A copy of Mr. Fray's slides and the press release on the streamlining plan are provided as &quot;Exhibits A and B,&quot; respectively, as part of these minutes.]
<P>Chairman Jon Mikels inquired why the program includes several Riverside County stations for closure whereas in San Bernardino County only the Ontario station is projected for closure in 2008.  Bill Fray replied that the intent is to place stations in representative areas with similar conditions.  For instance, the sites in San Bernardino must remain for either topographical, geographical or climatological reasons.  In addition, because of the air flows which converge in this area, the air quality in Temecula, and to some extent in Elsinore, Hemet and Perris, is approaching attainment of state standards.  However, the Perris station will remain to monitor the surrounding areas to ensure that air quality does not worsen.
<P>Dr. Bill Carter inquired whether there will be sufficient information for modeling purposes once the stations are closed.  Dr. Chung Liu replied that since more intensive data is required for modeling, the AQMD will continue to perform special monitoring.  Mr. Fray added that the San Diego APCD plans to open a new monitoring station in Escondido since the Temecula station is scheduled for closure in 1996.  He also pointed out that an important part of the streamlined network is the three portable monitoring stations which can be set up within 24 hours.  Dr. Carter inquired if in addition to ARB and EPA, the AQMD sought feedback from any independent experts on the projected network plan.  Mr. Fray replied no.  Dr. Liu commented that there is a tradeoff incorporated into the plan.  In the past there has been considerable monitoring of ozone, but from air quality research and planning, AQMD staff realizes that a different set of data is needed at this time.  Consequently, there will be more in-depth, specialized monitoring, such as hydrocarbon speciation and PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>, for instance.
<P>Chairman Hazelwood thanked staff for their time and indicated that there appears to be a better comfort level with the projected network plan.  The Council&#146;s initial concerns had evolved around modeling needs and whether there would be sufficient monitoring coverage around the Basin.  
<P>In reply to comments by Dr. Russ Sherwin, Chairman Hazelwood clarified that monitoring is carried out to meet EPA requirements and is designed as a compliance tool rather than as a day-to-day health tool.  Such health data is compiled from special studies, such as the study on indoor vs. outdoor air pollution, and these studies provide another piece of the puzzle about the relationships between health and levels of pollutants. 
<P>4. For the status report on the Draft 1997 AQMP, Henry Hogo, AQMD Manager/Air Quality Evaluation &amp; Modeling, reported that the 1994 Ozone only SIP is the basis for the 1997 AQMP, which demonstrates attainment of both the federal PM<SUB>10</SUB> and Ozone standards by 2006 and 2010, respectively.  He also reviewed the objectives of the PM<SUB>10</SUB> Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP) which focused on three areas, including emissions inventory, monitoring and enhanced PM<SUB>10</SUB> air quality modeling.  The PTEP provided the design value of 69 ug/m<SUP>3</SUP> for annual PM<SUB>10</SUB> as well as resulted in considerable PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> data which EPA asked for to evaluate its PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> standard.  In fact, for the 24-hour value PM<SUB>10</SUB> is about 180 or 38% above the standard and PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> is about 98. 
<P>Mr. Hogo also reviewed the emission inventory studies, the primary focus of which concentrated on the diary industry and ammonia emissions in the Chino area.  This data greatly assisted staff in projecting nitrite and sulfate concentrations.  
<P>For modeling enhancement, the PTEP studied five areas of modeling development and/or application, including a three-dimensional episodic model which will be used again in the future for PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>.  Dr. Carter asked if modeling performance has improved.  Mr. Hogo replied yes because data collection has improved considerably as a result of the enhanced monitoring, including daily speciation data in the last half of 1995 for sulfate, nitrite, organics, chloride ammonias, and elemental carbons, among other pollutants.  However, the model still tends to underpredict for organics and overpredict for elemental carbons.  Chairman Hazelwood inquired whether the model has a chemistry mechanism to take into account the formation of both organics and inorganics.  Mr. Hogo replied yes; the model also includes a photochemical mechanism to predict Ozone and aerosols at the same time.  
<P>The two-dimensional source apportionment model is the model Glen Cass has been working on over several years to track different sources by size distribution.  For instance, it can predict aerosol growth from the source to the receptor.  This model will assist in evaluating different types of control strategies and the impacts of different sources.  However, this model has been delayed for use in evaluating alternative control strategies.  The particle and cell (PIC) model from CalTech has been used to predict PM dispersion, mostly nitrites and sulfates.  However, since Glen Cass suggested that it needed improvement, the PTEP included enhancements for that model as well.  The findings were that the Urban Airshed Model rather than the PIC model should be used while replacing the UAM&#146;s chemistry with the empirical chemistry in the PIC model.  This modified model provides up-to-date simplified or linear chemistry for nitrites and sulfates. 
<P>Next, Henry Hogo reviewed the 1993 baseline and 2010 without additional control strategies for VOC, CO, PM<SUB>10</SUB>, SO<SUB>x</SUB> and NO<SUB>x</SUB>.  It is predicted that from 1993 to 2010 primary emissions will increase from area sources and entrained road dust if additional controls are not applied.  Chairman Hazelwood asked if the emissions inventory is based on EMFAC7G.  Mr. Hogo replied yes.  Mr. Hogo also reviewed what control strategies will be included in the 1997 AQMP, what will be new in the plan, and which strategies were removed and why since the 1994 AQMP.
<P>Mr. Hogo described the approach taken to demonstrate attainment for PM<SUB>10</SUB>, using the modified UAM and speciated rollback, and the results of both modeling methods for PM<SUB>10</SUB> as well as ozone using only the UAM.  Chairman Hazelwood inquired if the annual average for PM<SUB>10</SUB> is based on a geometric or arithmetic mean.  Mr. Hogo stated that the federal mean is arithmetic while the state uses the geometric mean, and the 24-hour average is the peak.  
<P>In addition, Mr. Hogo reviewed the carrying capacities in tons per day for the primary pollutants and why those carrying capacities were increased.  As a result of the PTEP, carrying capacities for PM<SUB>10</SUB> were increased based on new design value, lower primary emissions, lower ammonia emissions, new speciated data, and the new federal &quot;natural events&quot; policy.  For ozone, there was more accurate data for modeling input and the 1985 modeling day was eliminated since it is a rare meteorological event.  Chairman Hazelwood asked what is meant by direct emissions of PM<SUB>10</SUB>.  Mr. Hogo replied that direct emissions of PM<SUB>10</SUB> primarily refer to fugitive dust and elemental carbons.  Russ Sherwin asked what is meant by entrained road dust rather than fugitive dust.  Mr. Hogo stated that entrained road dust is dust kicked up when a vehicle travels over a surface street, whereas dust coming from construction activities is considered different.  However, it&#146;s all fugitive dust.  
<P>Relative to the increases in carrying capacity, Mr. Hogo explained that once the 1997 Southern California Ozone Study (SCOS) is completed, there will be intensive field data available to set up new episodes which the AQMD believes will form the basis in developing future AQMPs. 
<P>In conclusion, Mr. Hogo reviewed the primary emissions projected through 2010 based on existing rules only and under the 1997 AQMP and provided insight into what the future would be like if new PM and ozone standards are promulgated by EPA. 
<P>[A copy of Mr. Hogo's slide presentation is provided as &quot;Exhibit C&quot; as part of these minutes.]
<P>The Council briefly discussed <I>The Los Angeles Times</I> article dated July 25 regarding Mary Nichols' comments relative to the 1997 AQMP and the new Ozone and PM standards being proposed by EPA.  The Council further discussed monitoring relative to 1-hour, 8-hour, 24-hour, and annual standards, emphasizing that 8-hour monitoring is more reflective of true measurements.
<P><B>ACTION:</B>  Chairman Hazelwood asked that staff work with the Atmospheric Sciences Committee for a review of modeling assumptions so that the Committee can provide its comments before the AQMP is submitted to the Governing Board for approval.  He would especially appreciate feedback from Drs. Venkatram and Winer on the modeling assumptions.  He asked that Dr. Carter arrange a meeting between staff and the AS Committee once the Council has received the Draft 1997 AQMP scheduled for release August 2. 
<P><B>ACTION:</B>  Chairman Hazelwood also asked the Council secretary to fax a note to the full Council advising them of the pending release of the AQMP, whether they wish a copy, and if so, in what version (e.g., printed copy, CD-ROM, or floppy.)  The note should also mention that the AQMP can be downloaded from the Internet.
<P>5. The Report on the Oxygenated Fuels Study by NAS/NRC was taken out of order before Items #2-4 at staff&#146;s request.  Chairman Hazelwood reported that the National Research Council disagrees with the White House&#146;s findings.  In fact, it concludes that the fuel additive methyl tertiary-butyl either (MTBE) is unlikely to pose a substantial risk to humans.  As for the recent articles relative to finding MTBE traces in ground water, the NRC comments that this should be no surprise since it is a water soluble oxygenated organic compound, but the traces found should present no significant negative health effects.  He reminded the Council that California removed MTBE from its list of carcinogens ten years ago, and negative physiological effects of MTBE only show up in colder climates.  [A copy of the &quot;In the News&quot;report on NRC's findings is provided as &quot;Exhibit D&quot; as part of these minutes.]
<P>The Council also discussed whether the properties of MTBE and dimethyl either were similar since dimethyl either has been proposed as a replacement to diesel without the emissions while retaining the fuel, engine and power efficiency of diesel.
<P>6. Committee Reports:  Due to the late hour, coupled with the absence of Dr. Colome and Ms. Walecka, the Council postponed committee reports.
<P>7. Under &quot;Other Business,&quot; Board Chairman Jon Mikels announced that ARB Chairman John Dunlap recently announced his appointment of the new ARB Executive Officer, Michael Kenny, who was formerly ARB&#146;s general counsel.  
<P><B>ACTION:</B>  Chairman Hazelwood indicated that he, Jon Mikels and Chung Liu should schedule a one-hour meeting to further discuss Board assignments to the Council.  Chairman Hazelwood indicated that he would contact Dr. Liu to make such arrangements.
<P>8. Under the public comment period, John Billheimer, representing self, asked that the Council explore photochemical reactivity since he believes that no other Board advisory committee has such issues within its charter.  He provided Chairman Hazelwood his written comments on this issue relative to the upcoming adoption of proposed amendments to Rule 1171.  He also advised that at the Governing Board&#146;s September meeting, he plans to request that the Board postpone adoption of Rule 1171 amendments for one year to allow for further study of photochemical reactivity.  Dr. Hazelwood recommended that Mr. Billheimer present his recommendations to staff, with the suggestion that the issue could be referred to the Advisory Council for further consideration since some members have already been researching the issue of reactivity.

<p> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br> Executive Officer
<hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Rule 1113 is applicable to manufacturers, distributors, and end-users of architectural and industrial maintenance (AIM) coatings.  It was first adopted in 1977, and has un-dergone numerous amendments.  The purpose of the rule is to reduce VOC emissions from the use of AIM coatings, primarily by placing VOC limits on various coating categories.

<P>On August 21, 1990, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County entered a judgment against AQMD in the case <U>Dunn-Edwards Corporation, et al. vs. SCAQMD, et al.</U>  The judgment denied in part, and granted in part, the petition for writ of mandate seeking to overturn certain amendments made in February, 1990.  As a result, the AQMD was prevented from enforcing the lower VOC limits for aerosol coatings, industrial maintenance coatings, lacquers, quick-dry enamels, and quick-dry primers, sealers and undercoaters.  This judgment impacted approximately 4.5 tons per day (tpd) of VOC emissions.  The AQMD has contracted Eastern Michigan University to further study the impacted coating categories, with the exception of lacquers.  Other amendments adopted in February 1990 and prior rule provisions remained in effect.  The proposed amendments will formally reinstate the limits as existing prior to February 1990, except for lacquers, which is again proposed to be lowered.
<P>The proposed amendments will lower the VOC limits for some coating categories not impacted by the court judgment, with the exception of lacquers.  The proposed lower VOC limits are all based on the concept of reformulation of existing coatings, either with water, acetone, or resin technology.  The proposed amendments will increase the VOC limit for coating categories that have been under variance for the past three years, and address issues raised since the September 6, 1991 amendments.  These include addition of and modification to some definitions, synchronizing final compliance dates for coating categories, and updating the analytical test methods.
<P>As a part of this rulemaking effort, a complete technology and environmental assessment was conducted for all coatings, including lacquers, to comply with the court judgment.  In addition, as part of the rulemaking activities for Rule 1136 - Wood Products Coatings, this coating category was extensively studied and received support from industry for the proposed VOC limits in a manufacturing setting.  Staff conducted a survey which showed that industry uses the same types of lacquers in the field as in a manufacturing setting.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>The following VOC limits are proposed to be lowered:
<P><I>Flat Coatings</I>
<P>Lower the VOC limit for flats from 250 g/l to 100 g/l, effective July  1, 2001 and further reduce from 100 g/l to 50 g/l, effective July 1, 2008.  Conduct a technology assessment for feasibility by July 1, 2000 for the 100 g/l limit and by July 1, 2007 for the 50 g/l limit.  Include an averaging provision to allow manufacturers to average the VOC content of their flat coatings, on a sales weighted basis upon plan submittal and approval.  Appendix A of Proposed Amended Rule (PAR) 1113 contains sections on the averaging, operational plan and reconciliation plan content requirements, modification or cancellation of the plan, and plan approval timeframes.
<P><I>Lacquers</I>
<P>Establish the VOC limit for lacquer at 680 g/l, then lower it to 550 g/l, effective January 1, 1998, and to 275 g/l, effective January 1, 2005.  Conduct a technology assessment for feasibility of the 275 g/l limit by January 1, 2004.  Include an exemption for lacquers to add up to 10% retarder during cool, humid days.
<P><I>Multi-Color Coatings</I>
<P>Lower the VOC limit for multi-color coatings from 420 g/l to 250 g/l, effective January 1, 1998.
<P><I>Traffic Coatings</I>
<P>Lower the VOC limit for traffic coatings from 250 g/l to 150 g/l, effective January 1, 1998.
<P>Staff recommends deletion, consolidation, and addition of definitions, as well as reinstatement of VOC limits and definitions pursuant to the Superior Court judgment.  These include industrial maintenance primers and topcoats at 420 g/l, quick-dry enamels at 400 g/l, and a definition and exemption for quick-dry primers, sealers, and undercoaters.  The exemption for quick-dry primers, sealers and undercoaters will continue as a result of the Superior Court judgment, provided the manufacturer continues to submit to the Executive Officer annual reports of those coatings sold in the AQMD.
<P>Staff recommends to increase the VOC limits for certain specialty coating categories that are currently under variance because they cannot comply with the current VOC limits.  These include exterior fire-proofing coatings, magnesite cement coatings, and japans/faux finishing coatings.
<P>In addition, staff has reorganized the Table of Standards coating categories into alphabetical order, eliminated coating categories that have been at the default 250 g/l limit of paragraph (c)(1) for at least three years, and consolidated similar categories with the same VOC limit.
<P>Lowering the VOC limits for flats, traffic, multi-color, and lacquers will achieve an emission reduction of 10.5 tpd.  Partially offsetting these reductions will be an increase of 0.14 tpd for japans, magnesite, and fire-proofing coatings;  however, these coatings have been under variances for the past several years, therefore actual emissions will not increase.

<P><B>Policy Issues</B><P>
Industry members, mainly manufacturers and contractors, provided several suggestions and introduced issues that they claimed need additional research.  The Environmental Legislative & Regulatory Advocacy Program (EL RAP) has seven main issues, which include: more thickness, more thinning, more priming, more topcoats, more touch-ups and repair work, more frequent recoating, and more reactivity.  Due to these seven issues, some manufacturers claim that coatings with higher VOC content will be substituted for the proposed lower VOC content coatings resulting in an increase in VOC emissions.  They also claim a larger amount of low-VOC coatings will be used, resulting in an actual increase in VOC emissions.  Additionally, a few manufacturers expressed concern regard-ing the fire hazards associated with acetone-based nitrocellulose lacquers.  Lastly, manu-facturers expressed concern regarding the lack of sufficient time necessary for research and development of the reformulated coatings.

<P>The seven issues focus on two main points.  The first six issues all state that the new formulations, either solvent-based or waterborne, result in more coating use and an overall increase in VOC emissions over a period of time.  The seventh issue involves the reactivity of solvents used in waterborne coatings.  EL RAP contends that these result in more ozone formation as compared to solvents in solvent-based formulations.
<P>In response to these concerns, the staff analyzed each of the specific issues raised by EL RAP and either addressed them through analysis in the attached Final Subsequent Environmental Assessment (SEA) or through proposed rule amendments.
<P>With regards to additional thinning, the focus of the proposed amendments is limited to coatings that are strictly waterborne formulations or based on acetone as a substitute solvent, thereby eliminating any concerns of thinning the coating, as supplied, with VOC.
<P>To examine the issues of thickness, priming, topcoats, touch-up and repair, and frequent recoating, staff used coating coverage estimates, typical dry mil thickness, recommended priming, and estimated life of coating, listed on container labels and technical data sheets or provided by manufacturers during personal interviews and phone surveys.  A thorough analysis comparing emissions from the proposed lower-VOC content coatings with emissions from potential substitute coatings clearly shows an overall VOC emission reduction as a result of the proposed amendments.  An extensive discussion regarding the feasibility of reactivity-based ozone control policy development is included in the attached staff report to address the seventh issue.
<P>To date, manufacturers have not provided data to support the claim that the lower VOC coatings could cause an increase in emissions.  As a part of the current rulemaking efforts, staff has requested life-cycle studies that may have been conducted over the past seven years, but none were provided.
<P>The Final SEA also analyzes any additional hazards associated with acetone usage.  Staff interviewed fire chiefs from various fire departments, and received follow-up letters, which all indicate that explosion or fire hazards associated with acetone use are no greater than hazards associated with solvents currently used in coating formulations, especially nitrocellulose lacquers.  In contrast, acetone is significantly less toxic than the solvents found in conventional nitrocellulose lacquers.
<P>Staff has proposed several amendments to Rule 1113 to address concerns raised relative to sufficient time to research, develop, and market compliant coatings.  The proposed amendments provide a five-year and a twelve-year time period for future compliance limits for flats and up to an eight-year time period for lacquers, as well as an averaging provision for the flat coatings that would allow manufacturers to offset non-compliant flat coatings with super-compliant flat coatings.  The AQMD has also committed to a technology assessment one year prior to the future rule limits for both flats and lacquers.

<P><B>AQMP and Legal Mandates</B>
<P>The 1994 AQMP estimates increased AIM emissions (due to population growth) at 67.1 tpd in 1994, growing to 72.1 tpd by the year 2000 and 83.0 tpd by the year 2010, without additional AIM regulations.  If left unchecked, AIM coating emissions alone would account for 26 % of the allowed VOC emissions in 2010, up from 6% of total VOC emissions in 1994.  Therefore, the 1994 AQMP has a specific control measure (CTS-07) to reduce AIM VOC emissions by 75 % by the year 2010.  This 62 tpd emission reduction is the largest of all short and intermediate term control measures, larger even than the earlier proposed VOC RECLAIM program.
<P>Installation of air pollution control equipment is not feasible for reducing AIM emissions, thereby leaving coating reformulation as the only possible means to achieve the required reductions.  The current proposal emphasizes reformulation of existing coatings, primarily by substituting acetone for other, more toxic and reactive solvents, or by using technologically-innovative resins that require a small amount of solvent for coalescence.
<P>These proposed Rule 1113 amendments are a small portion of the 1994 AQMP because they include lowering the VOC limits for only a few of the coating categories discussed in the control measure.  The proposed amendments will only reduce AIM emissions by 17.5%, which is only a small part of the 75% emission reduction that will eventually be required from AIM coatings.
<P>An extensive study is currently being conducted to assess the possibility of further emission reductions.  This study may lead to a future rule amendment in 1997.
<P><B>CEQA</B>
<P>Pursuant to the CEQA and AQMD Rule 110 - Rule Adoption Procedures to Assure Protection and Enhancement of the Environment, AQMD prepared a Draft SEA for the proposed amendments to Rule 1113.  The Draft SEA was circulated for a 45-day public review and comment period which ended on August 16, 1996.  All comments received on the Draft SEA and responses to comments are incorporated into the Final SEA for the proposed project.  No comments required substantive changes to the document.
<P><B>Socioeconomic Analysis</B>
<P>Staff has thoroughly evaluated the cost of compliance with the proposed amendments, which is included as Appendix H of the final staff report.
<P><B>Implementation Plan</B>
<P>A notice will be sent to all AIM coating manufacturers.

<P><B>Resource Impact</B>
<P>Existing AQMD resources will be sufficient to implement the proposed changes to this rule with minimal impact on the budget.<p>

<P><B>PROPOSAL:</B>
<blockquote>
 Adopt Proposed Rule 1605 - Credits for the Voluntary Repair of On-Road Motor Vehicles Identified Through Remote Sensing Devices
<P>SYNOPSIS: Proposed Rule 1605 will provide greater opportunities to generate Mobile Source Emission Reduction Credits (MSERCs) that can be used as an alternative means of compliance with AQMD regulations. The rule also will provide incentive for the early repair of high-emitting on-road motor vehicles.  To qualify for MSERCs, emission reductions generated from the implementation of this rule would have to be surplus to the statewide inspection and maintenance program.
</blockquote>
<P><B>COMMITTEE:</B>
<blockquote>
 Mobile Source, August 16, 1996
</blockquote>
<P><B>RECOMMENDED ACTION:</B>
<blockquote>
<P>1. Certify the Notice of Exemption for Proposed Rule 1605 - Credits for the Voluntary Repair of On-Road Motor Vehicles Identified Through Remote Sensing Devices, as proposed, in accordance with the attached Resolution.
<P>2. Adopt Proposed Rule 1605 - Credits for the Voluntary Repair of On-Road Motor Vehicles Identified Through Remote Sensing Devices.
</blockquote>

<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer

<HR ALIGN=CENTER><B>Background</B>
<P>Proposed Rule 1605 is the fifth MSERC program to be considered for adoption in a continuing effort to provide stationary source operators additional flexibility to meet AQMD regulations.  It is preceded by: 
<P><A HREF="/rules/html/r1610.html">Rule 1610</a> - Old-Vehicle Scrapping; 
<BR><A HREF="/rules/html/r1610.html">Rule 1612</a> - Credits for Clean On-Road Vehicles; 
<BR><A HREF="/rules/html/r1610.html">Rule 1620</a> - Credits for Off-Road Mobile Equipment; and 
<BR><A HREF="/rules/html/r1610.html">Rule 1623</a> - Credits for Clean Lawn and Garden Equipment.

<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=CENTER>
<B>Proposal</B>
<P>The proposed rule provides a mechanism for issuing VOC, CO, and NOx MSERCs to anyone who voluntarily reduces emissions from in-use on-road vehicles by repairing those vehicles that are identified and verified to be high-emitting vehicles through the combined use of remote sensing devices (RSDs) and California Smog Check testing.  To qualify for MSERCs, emission reductions generated from the implementation of this rule would have to be surplus to the statewide inspection and maintenance program or any other programs which use RSDs for the purpose of identifying high-emitting vehicles.
<P>Proposed Rule 1605 establishes requirements for submission of applications, issuance of credits, MSERC calculation, use of credits, recordkeeping and enforcement.  MSERCs issued under Proposed Rule 1605 may be used as RECLAIM Trading Credits, New Source Review (NSR) offsets, and as an alternative method of compliance with AQMD Regulation XI rules with future compliance dates.

<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=CENTER>
<B>AQMP &amp; Legal Mandates</B>
<P>The proposed rule meets the 1994 AQMP commitment to develop market-based incentive strategies.  In addition, the proposed rule is intended to provide an alternative means of compliance with AQMD regulations, as well as provide incentives to repair high-emitting on-road motor vehicles.  Finally, the proposed rule is another mechanism to generate MSERCs which may be converted to Universal Trading Credits (UTCs) as part of the proposed Intercredit Trading Program.

<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=CENTER>
<B>Public Comments</B>
A public workshop was held on August 14, 1996.  Staff has prepared responses to comments that are contained in the staff report.  Staff has discussed with the Air Resources Board potential issues associated with emission reduction overlap with the State&#146;s enhanced inspection and maintenance program.  Staff has included additional rule language to address the Air Resources Board (ARB) staff&#146;s initial concerns and will be working with ARB and Bureau of Automotive Repair during the implementation of Rule 1605.
<hr>
<B>CEQA</B>
<P>AQMD staff has reviewed the proposed project pursuant to state CEQA Guidelines Section  15002(k)(1).  The project involves emission reduction credit generation and does not have the potential to generate significant adverse impacts on the environment.  Therefore, the project is exempt from the requirements of CEQA.  A Notice of Exemption was prepared, pursuant to state CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3), for the proposed rule and will be filed with the county clerks immediately following the adoption of the proposed rule.
<br>
<B>Resource Impacts</B>

<P>Sufficient resources have been budgeted in the AQMD Three-Year Budget Forecast.

<BR>Ecology Auto Wrecking contract to include an additional $199,357 to meet the adjusted emission reduction target for the first quarter of 1996.</blockquote>
<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br>Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The Rule 2202 Air Quality Investment Program (AQIP) allows all employers to participate by electing to invest in an AQMD-administered restricted fund.  Investment can be either $60 annually per employee reporting to the worksite during the 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. peak window, or $125 per employee triennially.  The restricted monies are to be used by the AQMD to fund proposals that achieve mobile source emission reductions that would otherwise have been achieved by implementing a rideshare program.  This Board letter contains a discussion regarding the dispersal of funds from the AQIP compliance option for the second quarter of 1996.
<P>Upon registering under this option and submitting the designated investment amount, an employer is considered to be in compliance with the rule and there is no need for the employer to take further action to reduce mobile source emissions.  The collected monies are used to fund alternative mobile source emission reduction strategies that reduce mobile source emissions at a more cost-effective rate and could potentially result in greater overall emission reductions.
<P>The 1996 second quarter submittal period ended on June 28, 1996.  The total AQIP funds received during this period was $2,270,763 (see Attachment 1, Table 1).  This amount includes both annual and triennial participants.  The annual program contributions of $620,590 from 61 worksites will be used to purchase a single year of emission reductions; participation, by county, is noted in Attachment 1, Table 2.  The triennial program contributions of $1,650,173 from 102 worksites will be used to purchase three years of emission reductions; participation, by county, is noted in Attachment 1, Table 3.
<P><B>Policy Issues</B>
<P>State law which becomes effective January 1, 1997 [ Health & Safety Code Sections 40458 and 44243.5 added pursuant to SB 836 which was approved by the State Legislature August 31, 1996 and signed by the Governor on September 27, 1996]  raises the worksite threshold of Rule 2202 from 100 to 250 employees per worksite.  In fairness to those employers with less than 250 employees that have participated in the annual or triennial AQIP compliance options, staff is recommending that a prorated share of the AQIP contributions be refunded back to those employers.  The refund would be calculated from the beginning of 1997 and would be prorated to correspond to the remaining funds that extend beyond January 1, 1997 for compliance.  Staff will prepare an amendment to Rule 2202 to execute the AQIP fee refund recommendation.  
<P>The exemptions of those employers and the prorated refunding of their AQIP contribution, will significantly affect the level of AQIP funding available for the remainder of 1996.  Specifically, the total amount of the refund, calculated as of the end of the second quarter is estimated at $1,419,806.  This refund will reduce the AQIP funding available for the second quarter to $1,388,735.  The AQIP funding balance from the inception of the program until the end of the second quarter of 1996 is provided in Table 1 of Attachment 2.  Table 2 of Attachment 2 shows the adjusted emission reduction targets for the second quarter as a result of the exemptions pursuant to SB 836.  The net emission reduction commitments as of the end of the second quarter of 1996 are shown in Table 3 of Attachment 2.  As a result of emission reduction target adjustment for the current and past quarters, a deficit is shown for the 1996 balance of emission credits in the AQIP.  To meet the emission reduction target of the first quarter 1996 and refund the prorated dollars to the first quarter participants, staff recommends that the first quarter Ecology Auto Wrecking contract be amended to include an additional $199,357.
<P><B>Proposal Evaluation</B>
<P>During the second quarter of 1996, eight proposals were received requesting funds ranging from $240,075 to $1,388,465.  The project proposals received were grouped into four categories:  old-vehicle scrapping; alternative vehicle deployment; ridematching software/hardware; and remote sensing.  Attachment 3 gives a summary of each proposal received, and funds requested.  Attachment 4 lists the proposals received, funds requested, total proposal costs, and emission reductions expected for each proposal.
<P>All proposals submitted are reviewed and scored based on the information in the proposal as submitted to the AQMD, and according to the selection criteria described in the RFP.  The RFP scoring process consists of two steps.  The first step is the technical evaluation, in which each proposal is assigned points based on:  the potential of a proposed project to result in transportation technology and infrastructure improvements; the potential to achieve emissions reductions relative to the quarterly targets; and the overall expertise of the firm.  In the second step the proposals are scored according to cost effectiveness, if the firm is a local business enterprise, and if it is a certified MBE/WBE/DVBE company or joint venture.  Attachment 5 discusses the selection criteria and summarizes the overall ratings of each proposal.
<P>The following proposal is recommended for approval:
<P> <B>Ecology Auto Wrecking</B>   -  $989,950
<P>This project will generate MSERCs through an old-vehicle scrapping program through the purchase of triennial credits.  The MSERCs generated will meet the adjusted emission reduction targets established by the level of employer participation in the AQIP.
<P>For the second quarter of 1996, the total recommended funding amount is $989,950 (see Attachment 6).  Any remaining AQIP funds would be held for future proposal funding in subsequent quarters.  Both annual and triennial AQIP emission reduction targets for each performance target zone and for all participants during the second quarter 1996 will be met by the recommended proposals and the excess emission credits from previous quarters&#146; projects made available due to SB 836.
<P><B>Outreach</B>
<P>The AQIP announcement was mailed to all Rule 2202 employers (approximately 4,500 worksites).  Furthermore, the availability of AQIP funds and the RFP was advertised in the Los Angeles Times, Orange County Register, Riverside Press Enterprise, Los Angeles Sentinel, Eastern Group Publications, San Bernardino Sun, La Voz, La Opinion, Rafu Shimpo, Precinct Reporter, The Black Voice News, Chinese Daily News, Korea Central Daily, El Chicano, The Excelsior, Philippine News, &quot;h/mt Project Information Services,&quot; The M/W/DVBE Source, and the California State Contracts Register.  Copies of the AQIP announcement and the RFP were sent to the Black and Latino Legislative Caucuses and interested minority contractors/professional associations, transportation management associations and organizations, members of the Consultants Roundtable, attendees at AQIP bidders conferences, and any interested party.  In addition, a Bidders Conference was held at AQMD headquarters on June 11, 1996.
<P><B>Resource Impact</B>
<P>The prorated refund of AQIP monies to participating employers at worksites with 100 to 250 employees amounts to $1,419,806, which leaves $1,388,735 for second quarter funding (see Table 1 of Attachment 2).

<b>Proposal:</b>
<blockquote>Provide Additional Funding for Technical Support of AQMD&#146;s Technology Advancement Program
</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b>
<blockquote>Since 1988, AQMD&#146;s Technology Advancement (TA) program has co-sponsored hundreds of development, demonstration, and research projects designed to expedite wide-scale use of progressively cleaner technologies and fuels.  To optimize the effectiveness of this program, it has been advantageous to supplement in-house technical resources and expertise with outside assistance.  A total of $151,500 in FY 1996-97 funding is proposed for four level-of-effort contracts to provide ongoing technical support for the TA program.  Two existing contracts would be amended and two new contracts would be executed.
</blockquote>

<P><b>Committee:</b>
<blockquote>
Technology, September 27, 1996, Recommended for Approval</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>Authorize the Executive Officer to execute amendments to contract #95105 with S.E. Hamilton &amp; Co. for an additional $16,500 and to contract #96051 with Davis &amp; Associates for an additional $35,000.  Authorize the Executive Officer to execute new contracts for technical support with Rose Communications, Inc. for $50,000 and AC Propulsion, Inc. for $50,000.
</blockquote>
<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Achieving clean-air standards in Southern California will require emission reductions from both mobile and stationary sources beyond those expected using current technologies.  The AQMP therefore includes provisions for the expedited, future implementation of advanced emissions-reduction technologies and clean-burning fuels.  To help meet the technological needs of the AQMP, the Board adopted a Clean Fuels Program in 1988 and established AQMD&#146;s Technology Advancement (TA) office to administer the program.  Since its inception, AQMD&#146;s TA program has co-sponsored hundreds of development, demonstration, and research projects.
<P>To optimize the effectiveness of AQMD&#146;s TA program, it has been advantageous to supplement in-house technical resources and expertise with outside assistance.  Through the use of selected consultants, AQMD staff are best able to monitor the broad range of emerging technologies and clean-burning fuels and help facilitate their deployment in the Basin.  This also ensures that the most up-to-date information can be assimilated for use in the AQMP.  For example, technical support consultants provide assistance and outreach efforts involving low-NOx boilers and generators; alternative fuel vehicles; ZEV technologies including fuel cells and batteries; alternative fuel infrastructure development; and the production of clean, renewable energy.  A very useful type of contract for getting technical assistance on an &quot;as-needed&quot; basis is the level-of-effort (LOE) contract, which, once executed, allows staff to issue task orders to a consultant for ongoing work as well as to provide specific assistance when needs and issues arise.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Staff proposes awarding FY 1996-97 funding for LOE contracts with four consultants.  Each of the four contracts will be awarded on a sole-source basis.  Each proposed contractor offers extensive and comprehensive qualifications in their respective fields, as further detailed below. 
<P><U>Proposal #1: Amend S.E. Hamilton &amp; Co. Contract</U>
<P>Since March 1995, S.E. Hamilton &amp; Co. has provided technical support for AQMD&#146;s TA program.  The total amount of funding that has been authorized to date is $33,000.  Staff proposes to amend LOE contract #95105 with S.E. Hamilton &amp; Co. for an additional $16,500 to continue providing technical monitoring and public-relations assistance involving the clean-fuel policies of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority (LACMTA) and other transit districts.  Steve Hamilton has been providing the AQMD with a valuable service monitoring the activities of LACMTA regarding its adopted policy to phase-out diesel buses.  Under the proposed amendment to his contract, Mr. Hamilton will continue to help AQMD identify the benefits of this policy and relate them to local policymakers who are involved in this important issue.  He will assist AQMD in providing information on the availability and cost of alternative-fuel buses and help get the word out to local transit districts.  Mr. Hamilton will continue to attend and report on all relevant LACMTA committee meetings, including the Operations Committee, regarding the implementation of clean-fuel buses.  Relevant issues that he will track include the changing relative cost of methanol, CNG, and other fuels; the use of emission reduction credits for clean-fuel bus off-setting; and the procurement of additional revenues to supplement the local or federal share currently allocated for bus capital and /or operating expenditures.  Mr. Hamilton will also assist in the crafting of appropriate strategies to expedite the phase out of diesel buses in other transit districts within the Basin.  He will coordinate discussions on related issues among AQMD staff and key transit district staff, and identify major problems and barriers that may occur related to the phase-out of diesel buses in the Basin. 
<P><U>Proposal #2: Amend Davis &amp; Associates Contract</U>
<P>Since late 1994, Davis &amp; Associates has provided technical support for AQMD&#146;s TA program.  The total amount of funding that has been authorized to date is $85,000.  Staff proposes to amend LOE contract #96051 with Davis &amp; Associates for an additional $35,000 to continue providing technical assistance involving transit buses and other heavy-duty vehicles.  Specifically, the proposed amendment will allow D&amp;A to 1) assist staff in evaluating the emission benefits, availability, cost, and obstacles to the commercialization of heavy-duty, mobile emission control technologies; 2) assess technical progress and economic aspects of current transit industry programs involving new technological applications for low- and zero-emission transportation, including the Advanced Technology Transit Bus (ATTB) program, the Fuel Cell Buyers Consortium, and activities of the Federal Transit Administration; and 3) participate in AQMD&#146;s Fuel Cell Implementation Task Force and other selected technical forums involving low- or zero-emission transportation applications. 
<P><U>Proposal #3: Execute New LOE Contract with Rose Communications, Inc.</U>
<P>Since 1990, Bob Rose of Rose Communications, Inc., has provided focused support for AQMD&#146;s TA program to help commercialize fuel cells and other low-/zero-emission technologies.  AQMD has also contracted with the Breakthrough Technologies Institute, of which Mr. Rose is the executive director, to conduct public-education and outreach efforts involving fuel cells.  In addition, AQMD has co-funded the formation and activities of Fuel Cells for Transportation, an advocacy group for fuel cells that is coordinated by Mr. Rose and cost shared by many public- and private-sector organizations.  Since 1990, the total amount of funding that AQMD has provided for Mr. Rose&#146;s work with these three entities (Rose Communications, Breakthrough Technologies Institute, and Fuel Cells for Transportation) is $454,900.  All these contracts are now expired.
<P>Staff proposes a new LOE contract with Rose Communications, Inc. for an amount not to exceed $50,000.  The primary objective of this contract will be for Mr. Rose to support staff in the planning, implementation, and documentation of AQMD&#146;s Fuel Cell Implementation Task Force.  Currently, this task force of more than 60 people is planned, organized, and implemented by a single staff member.  The ultimate goal of the task force is to help meet the technology-development needs of the AQMP as defined under Section 182(e)(5) of the federal Clean Air Act.  Towards this end and using his extensive knowledge of the fuel cell industry, Mr. Rose will help set strategic goals for each task force meeting, weighing complex technical and market issues as well as task force resources.  He will help determine priorities in tackling fuel cell commercialization barriers such as higher costs, lack of safety codes, poorly developed fuel infrastructures, insufficient market incentives, and the need to expand use of emission reduction credits.  He will help devise and deploy mechanisms to maximize accomplishments of each meeting, such as the use of subcommittees, breakout sessions, etc.  Mr. Rose will help identify the most appropriate technical and policy speakers for task force meetings, and on occasion function as a discussion facilitator himself.  Mr. Rose will assist in preparing and disseminating highlight reports about the task force for its members, the technical community at large, and interested policy makers and citizens.
<P>A second objective of this LOE contract will be for Mr. Rose to assist staff with the flow of fuel-cell-related information into and out of AQMD&#146;s technology advancement program.  He will use his extensive contacts and information resources in Washington DC to provide regular updates about federal funding of fuel cell programs, including budget decisions and program activities at the Departments of Energy, Treasury, Defense and Commerce.  He will monitor and disperse technical results from various fuel cell programs and activities worldwide (e.g., work in Germany by Mercedes Benz).  Conversely, he may be asked to disseminate information about AQMD&#146;s technology advancement program at relevant seminars, workshops, meetings, etc.
<P><U>Proposal #4: Execute New LOE Contract with AC Propulsion, Inc.</U>
<P>AC Propulsion, Inc. (ACP), founded by EV expert and company president Alan Cocconi, is a small San Dimas company that builds advanced, alternating-current-drive EVs. At a total cost of $236,602, AQMD has purchased three of these high-power, hand-built EVs for use in its ZEV demonstration and testing program.  Test data and driving impressions obtained through these EVs have been instrumental in maintaining the viability of ARB&#146;s ZEV program.  ACP has provided AQMD with technical support, maintenance, etc. for these EVs under a $50,000 LOE contract, which recently expired.  Under a separate contract with AQMD funding not to exceed $296,000, ACP is currently building EV-range-extender technology.  In sum, to date AQMD has allocated a total of $582,602 to ACP for EV technical support, development of range-extender technology, and the purchase of three advanced EVs.
<P>Staff proposes to execute a new technical-support contract with ACP for an amount not to exceed $50,000. The proposed new LOE contract will allow Alan Cocconi and his engineers to continue providing field support and maintenance for AQMD&#146;s three EVs built by ACP.  In addition, ACP will develop, install, and/or test technological upgrades for these vehicles.  Specific areas that will be addressed include traction-control systems, drive systems, advanced battery packs, advanced charging systems, and advanced air conditioning systems.
<P><B>Sole Source Justification</B>
<P>Section II, Step 3 (C) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure identifies four provisions under which a sole-source award may be justified: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds cost for consultant, (2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health, (3) services are only available from sole source, and (4) other circumstances exist identifying sole source as in the best interests of the AQMD.  Sole source justifications for each of these proposals are made under the following provisions:
<P><U>S.E. Hamilton &amp; Co.</U>
<P>This request for a sole-source award is made under provision (4).  Staff believes that it is in the best interests of the AQMD to amend the existing contract with S. E. Hamilton &amp; Co.  Mr. Steve Hamilton is the principal of this minority-owned governmental and public affairs consulting firm.  Mr. Hamilton is an experienced government-relations specialist and an established public transportation agency expert.  He has established close relationships with many people at a high level who are involved in the critical issues of clean-fuels and low-emission technologies for transit buses.  Many of these relationships were formed when he served as special consultant to former Senator Pete Wilson, and as an appointee in Governor George Duekmejian's administration.
<P>Mr. Hamilton has extensive experience and expertise in coordinating clean-fuel-related technology transfer activities among local governments, industry, and transit districts.  He has established extensive contacts within many municipal and regional transit properties, as well as throughout local governments.  He has worked successfully with city council members and LACMTA board members to explain the environmental and public-health benefits of clean, alternative-fuel buses, as well as their commercial viability.  Mr. Hamilton&#146;s past work for the AQMD in this area was instrumental in the LACMTA&#145;s October 1993 adoption of a pledge to phase out the purchase of diesel-powered buses.  In sum, staff believes that Mr. Hamilton is uniquely qualified to act as a liaison among AQMD staff, LACMTA, minority communities, and local officials regarding LACMTA policy towards clean-fuel buses and low-emission transit technologies.
<P><U>Davis &amp; Associates</U> 
<P>This request for a sole-source award is made under provision (4).  Staff believes that amending the existing contract with Davis &amp; Associates is in the best interest of the AQMD.  Davis &amp; Associates consists of a two-man team with extensive transit industry expertise, and, equally important, the ability to provide objective and independent technical assessments regarding the many types of emerging low- and zero-emission transit bus technologies.  Rich Davis, principal of Davis &amp; Associates, is a recognized expert in public transportation applications and issues.  His detailed technical expertise in alternative-fuel applications for transit buses is acknowledged worldwide.  He successfully introduced methanol and compressed natural gas (CNG) powered buses into the Los Angeles public transportation sector.  As Director of Equipment Maintenance for one of the nation&#146;s largest transit properties (now LACMTA), he managed the largest alternative-fuel and low-emission bus program in the world.  Reports from his engineers were used by state, local, and federal regulators as the basis for new efforts to clean up the heavy-duty vehicle sector.  Mr. Davis has helped write portions of the Federal Clean Air Act, and has also testified in both Sacramento and Washington DC on legislation pertaining to the Clean Air Act.  He was instrumental in obtaining funding, designing, and constructing Southern California&#146;s first commercial, heavy-duty test facility at LACMTA.  This facility enables the State of California to perform comparison emissions testing on heavy-duty alternative-fuel engines and vehicles.
<P>Mr. Davis&#146;s original concept of a purpose-built, environmentally friendly transit bus for the 21st century led to initiation of the internationally recognized ATTB program.  He has received extensive recognition for his work within the transit industry, particularly as it pertains to alternative fuels. Projects under his control were studied as models for the future by international study groups under recommendation by the US Government.  He has received awards from the Department of Transportation, the American Public Transit Association, the California Transit Association, AQMD, and the American Methanol Institute.  He is a fellow in the Institute for Advancement of Engineering.  Assisting Mr. Davis in Washington DC is Mr. Steve Barsony, a former official of the Department of Transportation and a recognized expert in a wide variety of transit-related technical issues.  Mr. Barsony&#146;s presence in Washington as a direct monitor of federal transit activities and clean-fuel programs has been an important tool for staff to keep abreast of environmentally benign transit technologies.
<P><U>Rose Communications, Inc.</U>
<P>This request for a sole-source award is made under provision (4).  Staff believes that it is in the best interest of AQMD to execute the proposed new contract with Rose Communications, Inc.  The primary role that Mr. Rose will fulfill -- that of technical consultant and strategic thinker for AQMD&#146;s Fuel Cell Implementation Task Force -- requires extensive first-hand experience and knowledge about fuel cell issues.  Achievement of task force goals will depend in part on the ability to arrive at a consensus among the various public- and private-sector &quot;players&quot; involved in fuel cell commercialization.
<P>Mr. Rose has proven abilities in this regard.  He is a policy analyst and government-relations consultant specializing in fuel cells and alternative-fuel technologies.  He has been involved in federal programs to reduce environmental pollution since the early 1970s.  In 1980 he served as senior special assistant to the Secretary of State.  Prior to 1980, he held various positions in the U.S. Senate and was extensively involved in media relations for senate subcommittees on environmental pollution.  Since about 1990, he has done extensive work to assist the AQMD in supporting and commercializing fuel cell technologies.  Mr. Rose serves as executive director for both the non-profit group Fuel Cells 2000 and the Breakthrough Technologies Institute.  He is also coordinator of Fuel Cells for Transportation.  He is extremely knowledgeable about federal policy and funding priorities for fuel cell technologies and renewable energy, and is highly qualified and capable to assist staff  with strategic thinking and implementation of AQMD&#146;s fuel cell task force.  In sum, Mr. Rose&#146;s expertise and extensive knowledge about fuel cells, and his close association with the dynamic Washington environment regarding funding appropriations for fuel cell technologies, makes him uniquely qualified to assist staff in implementing the fuel cell task force.
<P><U>AC Propulsion Inc.</U>
<P>This request for a sole-source award is made under provision (3).  ACP designed and hand built the AQMD&#146;s three advanced EVs and is the only practicable choice to offer maintenance services and technical upgrades as proposed in this new contract.  ACP has extensive experience in developing high-power, high-efficiency EVs, EV drivetrains, and EV battery recharging and monitoring systems.  Founder Alan Cocconi, a recognized expert in EV technology, is world-renown for his pioneering work building the GM Impact EV controller.  ACP&#146;s service center for EVs is conveniently located within ten miles of the AQMD headquarters.  In the past, ACP engineers have provided on-call service for AQMD&#146;s EVs that could not have been obtained from any other source known to staff.

<P><B>Background</B>
<P>On June 9, 1995, the Board approved the purchase of a Kewet El-Jet 3 electric vehicle from Green Motorworks of North Hollywood.  This EV was to be tested for use as a &quot;station car&quot; between the AQMD office and the Walnut Metro-Link station.  In that capacity, this EV was found to be adequate.  However, for other trips in the Diamond Bar area the speed and range were limited, largely due to the local hills.  After four months of service, Green Motorworks exchanged the El-Jet 3 for a higher-power El-Jet 4 model.  This EV performed better than the El-Jet 3, but the speed and range were still limited.  After five months, Green Motorworks proposed to buy the El-Jet 4 EV back for 75% of the original EV purchase price, which accounts for the depreciation of the two EVs used.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Delete Vehicle No. 38574 from AQMD&#146;s equipment inventory as it is not required for public use.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>Total cost of Vehicle No. 38574 was $22,097.09 which included the vehicle base cost of $18,995.00 plus state sales tax, shipping and duty, and document preparation fees.  Green Motorworks would buy back Vehicle No. 38754 for 75% of the base cost, or $14,246.25.  These funds would be returned to the AQMD General Fund, Clean Fuels account for expenditure in the future.

</blockquote>
<P>James M. Lents, Ph. D.
<BR>Executive Officer
<p><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>On April 12, 1996, the Board approved issuance of an RFP for an amount up to $120,000to solicit proposals from outside litigation counsel having particular expertise and experience in CEQA and air quality litigation.  On July 26, 1996, a second RFP for an amount up to $50,000 was issued to solicit proposals for outside litigation counsel having particular expertise in general public law.  The purpose of these RFPs was to establish lists of pre-qualified outside counsel for assistance in these highly specialized areas of law.  In the past the AQMD has faced, and likely will face in the future, litigation requiring such specialized expertise.  A rapid response is needed when a lawsuit is served and it is not possible to go through the RFP process as new cases arise.  Establishing a pre-qualified list ensures that AQMD can quickly select counsel to represent it as needed.  It is not presently known how much work, if any, will be awarded pursuant to these RFPs.
<P>In accordance with the AQMD&#146;s Contracting and Purchasing Policy, a separate Public Notice inviting bids for both RFPs was published in the Los Angeles Times, Orange County Register, San Bernardino Sun, Riverside Press Enterprise, La Opinion, Los Angeles Sentinel, Eastern Group Publications, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (San Bernardino area), La Voz, Rafu Shimpo, Precinct Reporter, the Black Voice News, Chinese Daily News, Korea Central Daily, El Chicano, The Excelsior, Philippine News, M/W/DVBE Source, AQMD Hotline and the Contracts Register.  Copies of the RFP were mailed to the Latino and Black Legislative Caucuses, and various minority chambers of commerce and business associations.  In addition, public service announcements were sent to local media.  
<P>The RFPs were mailed to all firms and sole practitioners to whom we mailed the AQMD&#146;s RFP for outside counsel three years ago, to firms that have expressed interest in working for the AQMD, all women and minority Bar Associations located in the District and to all certified women and minority law firms on a list established by the Metropolitan Transit Authority and a list established by the County of Los Angeles.
<P>A number of highly qualified firms responded to the April 12, 1996 RFP, however, many did not have the required expertise in the specialized areas of air quality and CEQA litigation.  Bid responses for the April 12, 1996, RFP were received from 12 law firms or sole practitioners.  Of the 12 firms or practitioners responding to the RFP, four were certified MBEs, three were certified WBEs, and one had a subcontractor with a certified MBE.  Three firms met the specific technical evaluation criteria, nine did not.  A summary of the responses is provided in Attachment A.  The evaluation panel consisted of three AQMD employees (two attorneys and one investigator), two women and one man; one African American, one Hispanic and one Caucasian.
<P>Bid responses for the July 26, 1996, RFP were received from 15 law firms or sole practitioners.  Of these, eight were certified MBEs, and two were certified WBEs.  Seven firms met the technical criteria, eight firms did not.  Of the eight firms that did not meet the technical criteria, six firms failed to comply with either the Contracting and Purchasing MBE/WBE/DVBE policy or other required qualifications and two did not receive sufficient points.  A summary of the responses is provided in Attachment B.  The evaluation panel consisted of three AQMD employees (two attorneys and one investigator), two women and one man; one African American, one Hispanic and one Caucasian.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Establish a list valid through June 30, 1999 of pre-qualified litigation counsel having expertise in CEQA and air quality litigation consisting of the three top scoring firms:
<P>          <B><U>Score</U></B>
<P>1. Shute, Mihaly &amp; Weinberger, has a certified MBE subcontractor    86.8
<P>2. Ochoa &amp; Sillas and Aguirre &amp; Associates, a Joint Venture, certified MBE  86.3
<P>3. Katherine Stone, certified WBE        82.7
<P>Establish a list valid through September 10, 1999 of pre-qualified counsel having expertise in general public law consisting of the two top scoring firms:
<P>          <B><U>Score</U></B>
<P>1. Barbosa, Garcia &amp; Barnes, certified MBE       95
<P>2. Beltr&aacute;n, Leal &amp; Medina, certified MBE       92.83
<P>3. Ivie, McNeill &amp; Wyatt, certified MBE       97.33
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>The total budget for outside litigation counsel is $120,000, all of which may be allocated to one or more selected contractors as the need arises based on future litigation, the availability of counsel, and the needs of the AQMD as determined by General Counsel.  Selection for each case will be based on the particular expertise of each firm, the type of litigation, prior experience of the firm, and resource demands of the litigation.  Selection may also be made for occasional assignments in subject matters of the firm&#146;s expertise that does not involve litigation.  Sufficient funds are available in the FY 1996-97  budget.

<P><b>Proposal:</b><blockquote> Establish List of Pre-Qualified Vendors to

<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> On July 12, 1996 the Board approved the release of an RFP to pre-qualify vendors for library services and supplies.  As a result of successful responses to this RFP, six vendors were identified as capable of providing library services and supplies.  This action is to approve six vendors to provide their services to the AQMD for a period of two years.  Funds totaling $134,000 have been allocated in the FY 1996-97 Budget for this purpose.</blockquote>
<P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote> Administrative, September 20, 1996, Recommended for Approval</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action:</b><blockquote>
  Approve the vendors listed in Attachment A to provide the AQMD Library&#146;s services and supplies.
</blockquote>
<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>On July 16, 1996 the AQMD released RFP #9697-1 for Library Services and Supplies.  The purpose of this RFP was to pre-qualify vendors to provide various services and supplies in support of the AQMD&#146;s Library function.  Vendors selected will be issued purchase orders for the acquisition and shelf-preparation of books, periodicals, and other printed and multi-media materials.  Cataloging services will not be purchased this year.  Vendors selected remain pre-qualified for a period of two years.
<P>In accordance with the AQMD&#146;s Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure (prior to August 23, 1996), a public notice inviting bids was published in the Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Sentinel, Eastern Group Publications, La Voz, Orange County Register, The Excelsior, San Bernardino Sun, Precinct Reporter, El Chicano, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, Riverside Press-Enterprise, The Black Voice News, La Opinion, Rafu Shimpo, Chinese Daily News, Korea Central Daily, Philippine News, and The M/W/DVBE Source.  The RFP was not published in the Inland Empire Hispanic News because this newspaper was  added to our official list of publications after the RFP had been published.   In addition, the RFP was placed on the AQMD&#146;s Internet homepage and the bidders&#146; 24-hour telephone message line.
<P><B>Bid Evaluation</B>
<P>Copies of the RFP were mailed to forty vendors (Attachment B) and six bids were received.  The review panel was composed of three AQMD staff members familiar with library operations:  two females and one male; one each Asian, Black, and Caucasian.  Staff has completed the evaluation and selection process and has qualified all six vendors as meeting the minimum requirements identified in the RFP; two vendors are WBE-certified.  Staff believes that these vendors will be able to provide about 70% of the required Library services and supplies.  Items not available from these six vendors will be acquired in accordance with the AQMD&#146;s Administrative Policies and Procedures.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>Sufficient funds are allocated in the FY 1996-97 Budget.

<P>BOARD MEETING DATE:  October 11, 1996 AGENDA NO. 8</b></center><br><br>
<P><b>Proposal:</b><blockquote> Approve Contingency Purchase/Sales Agreement for Real Property Located at 9150 Flair Drive, El Monte, CA</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> AQMD has been seeking proposals to sell the real property located at 9150 Flair Drive, El Monte, CA.  Three proposals were received and, in closed session at the January 12, 1996 Governing Board meeting, the Board authorized staff to complete negotiations with one of the proposed purchasers.  Staff concluded negotiations and now is prepared to enter into a contingency  purchase/ sales agreement for the real property.  This will initiate the escrow process and allow the buyer to negotiate an agreement with Los Angeles County.
</blockquote>
<P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote> Administrative, September 20, 1996, Recommended for Approval
</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>1. Authorize the Chairman to sign the contingency purchase/sales agreement for the real property located at 9150 Flair Drive, El Monte, CA  91731, and authorize the Executive Officer or designee to execute any documents necessary to complete the sale.
<P>2. Approve the attached resolution (a) authorizing sale of the real property and, (b) as previously approved by the Governing Board, directing the disposition of proceeds from the sale of the El Monte Building.
</blockquote>
<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br> Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Since the AQMD Headquarters operation moved from the El Monte facility in October, 1991, staff has been involved in efforts to secure a buyer for that property.  In closed session at the January 12, 1996 Governing Board meeting, staff presented three proposed purchase offers to the Board for consideration.   The Board directed the Executive Officer to complete negotiations with Commercial Developments International/West, Incorporated (CDI/West).  Negotiations are complete and this action seeks Board approval of the contingency purchase/sales agreement with CDI/West.  The agreement will initiate the escrow process and allow the buyer to enter into an agreement with Los Angeles County for a build- or renovate-to-suit lease.
<P>Proceeds from the sale of the El Monte property will be placed in a Debt Service Fund to be used to pay down the debt of the Diamond Bar property.  In 1992, the Governing Board approved refinancing of the Diamond Bar property to take advantage of lower interest rates.  At that same time, the Governing Board also approved the use of proceeds from the eventual sale of the El Monte property to reduce the installment debt by buying down the bond obligations.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>The reduction in bond obligations will provide budget savings beginning in FY 1999-00 of approximately $365,000 annually through the year 2009, saving approximately $4 million in total interest expense.

<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The South Coast Air Quality Management District Building Corporation is a non-profit corporation created pursuant to Internal Revenue Service Code Section 501d and provides a means for the AQMD to finance the acquisition and improvement of property to accommodate AQMD&#146;s space needs.  Its bylaws provide that appointments to its Board of Directors be approved by the AQMD Governing Board.  The Building Corporation has appointed Mr. John Donaldson to its Board of Directors, subject to the approval of the AQMD Governing Board.  Mr. Donaldson recently retired after 35 years with Hughes Aerospace where he provided expertise in facility management, strategic planning, new construction, maintenance, support services, asset management, leases, acquisitions and divestitures.  He also has experience in corporate real estate work.  Mr. Donaldson would be an asset to the Building Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors and the AQMD  is extremely fortunate that someone of Mr. Donaldson&#146;s qualifications is willing to serve in this pro bono capacity.

<P>Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options was adopted on December 8, 1995. As one compliance strategy, Rule 2202 allows employers to invest in the AQIP. Monies received are placed in a restricted account to fund programs that result in emission reductions equivalent to that which would otherwise have been achieved by the participating employers. Staff evaluated the proposals received. This action is to recommend one proposal for funding and to amend one contract from the first quarter of 1996. This was reviewed by the Mobile Source Committee on September 27, 1996, and recommended for approval.

<P>Since 1988, AQMD&#146;s Technology Advancement (TA) program has co-sponsored hundreds of development, demonstration, and research projects designed to expedite wide-scale use of progressively cleaner technologies and fuels. To optimize the effectiveness of this program, it has been advantageous to supplement in-house technical resources and expertise with outside assistance. A total of $151,500 in FY 1996-97 funding is proposed for four level-of-effort contracts to provide ongoing technical support for the TA program. Two existing contracts will be amended and two new contracts will be executed. This was reviewed by the Technology Committee on  September 27, 1996 and recommended for approval.

<br>Governor's Appointee</UL>
<P> The meeting was called to order at 9:40 a.m. by Chairman Mikels.
<p>
<LI> Opening Comments
<P> <U>James M. Lents, Ph.D., Executive Officer</U>.  Commented that, as discussed by the Board at its September 13, 1996 meeting, arrangements have been made for five environmental experts to conduct a peer review of the modeling efforts for the 1997 AQMP and to present the results of the review to the Board within a month.
<P> <U>Chairman Mikels</U>.  Suggested a Board retreat, so that the Board could, in an informal setting, discuss long range issues associated with the 1997 AQMP and attainment, such as AQMD participation in mobile source strategies.  He will begin discussing details of the retreat with Dr. Lents and will keep Board members apprised as plans for the retreat develop.
<P><LI>  Enhancements to Permit Processing System
<LI>  Status Report on Compliance
<P> Indicating that she thought the presentation given by staff to the Stationary Source Committee at its September 20, 1996 meeting would be interesting and helpful for all Board members, as well as the public, to hear, Ms. Lee introduced Pat Leyden, DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, to provide updates on Permit Processing and Compliance.
<P> Ms. Leyden highlighted the new over-the-counter permit processing service launched by AQMD on October 1, 1996, whereby approximately four of AQMD&#146;s simplest types of applications are accepted at the counter, verified for completeness, and processed.
<P> With respect to compliance, as AQMD&#146;s resources have decreased, the number of inspections has decreased for small sources and increased for major sources.  The major sources produce approximately 92 percent of total reported NOx emissions and 80 percent of total reported ROG emissions.  Compliance trends for 1991 through 1995 were as follows:
<P><LI><B>Major Source</B>
<P>* Notice to Comply (NC) and Notice of Violation (NOV) statistics relatively constant for the last six years
<br>* 1995 - Best year on record for all Major Sources inspected
<br>* Very high compliance rate (86%) for RECLAIM Sources
<P><LI><B>Small Source</B>

<p>* NCs and NOVs have decreased
<br>* The priority is Small Business Assistance, Outreach, and Source Education
<P><LI><B>Citizen Complaints</B>
<P>* Relatively constant over the last six years at approximately 10,000 per year
<P> In response to comments by Ms. Soto, LaRonda Bowen, Public Advisor, indicated that staff does provide assistance to small businesses in completing the loan guaranty applications, and is presently working on an enhanced outreach plan for the Air Quality Assistance Fund (AQAF).  The enhanced outreach plan will be included as part of the Public Advisor report for the November 8, 1996 Board meeting.  She assured Ms. Soto that outreach staff who visit the offices of local legislators will bring along with them the brochures and information regarding the AQAF.
</UL><P>(Mr. Antonovich arrived at 9:45 a.m.)
<UL><LI>Creation of Antelope Valley Air Quality Management District
<P> Mr. Antonovich expressed his appreciation to the staffs of the AQMD, ARB, and the Cities of Palmdale and Lancaster for their involvement with AB 2666 (Knight) which was recently signed into law by the Governor, moving the Antelope Valley out of SCAQMD and into a separate air district of its own.
<P><LI>Presentation of Plaque to Marilyn Morton, Ethnic Community Advisory Council Co-Chair
<P> Chairman Mikels presented a plaque to Marilyn Morton, Co-Chair of the Ethnic Community Advisory Council from January 1992 through April 1996, in recognition of her leadership and dedication in increasing outreach to ethnic communities within the South Coast region and facilitating their participation in the quest for clean air.

<P>AYES: Antonovich (except Item #6), Braude, Burke, Haggard, Lee, Loveridge, Mikels, Paulitz, Silva, Soto and Wilson.
<P>NOES:  None.
<P>ABSTAIN: Antonovich (on Item #6 only).
<P>ABSENT: None.
</UL></OL><P><OL START=4><LI>Provide Additional Funding for Technical Support of AQMD&#146;s Technology Advancement Program
<P> Ms. Soto expressed concerns regarding two of the four proposals recommended under this item:  <U>Proposal #1: Amend S.E. Hamilton &amp; Co. Contract</U>, and <U>Proposal #2: Amend Davis &amp; Associates </U><U>Contract</U>.  It is her belief that AQMD staff is capable, or should be capable, of providing the technical support included in both of these proposals, rather than sole-source contracting the work out.  Also, in contacting the MTA, she was told that the studies to be performed under the two proposals have already been done, and the information is available at AQMD&#146;s request.  Because there is a possibility of duplication of efforts under these proposals, she asked that these two items be deferred for further discussion.  Ms. Soto also requested that in the future staff notify her, preferably by telephone, of any AQMD matters involving the MTA.
<P> Dr. Burke questioned the necessity of the two proposals if the information is already available, and whether or not the proposals meet the legal criteria for sole-source contracting.  He agreed with Ms. Soto that the proposals should be deferred for further discussion.
<P> Peter Greenwald, General Counsel, responded that there are no statutory requirements for contracting of this type by the AQMD.  The Board has adopted a policy, however, which specifies four provisions under which a sole-source contract may be justified.  The provision used for these particular contracts is &quot;other circumstances exist identifying sole source as being in the best interest of the AQMD&quot;.  The Board must decide whether or not that is in fact the case for these proposals.
<P> Mr. Paulitz commented that most of the concerns and questions regarding sole-source contracts that Board members have raised at Board meetings are raised, and satisfactorily addressed, at the Technology Committee meetings.  He suggested that if staff, in the future, extend to Ms. Soto a courtesy call regarding any items related to the MTA, and that, if not already being done, all Board members are provided copies of the Technology Committee&#146;s meeting agendas, some of the concerns will likely be mitigated.
<P> Dr. Lents requested that the Board approve Proposals #3 and #4, and defer Proposals #1 and #2 only for further discussion.
<UL><UL><P>MS. SOTO MOVED TO CONTINUE THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS OF AGENDA ITEM NO. 4 TO THE NOVEMBER 8, 1996 BOARD MEETING:
<P><I>&quot;Authorize the Executive Officer to execute amendments to contract #95105 </I><I>with S.E. Hamilton &amp; Co. for an additional $16,500 and to contract #96051 </I><I>with Davis &amp; Associates for an additional $35,000.&quot;</I>

<P> Catherine Witherspoon, Legislative Director, gave a brief update on the interim hearings that occurred subsequent to the September 20, 1996 Legislative Committee meeting.  On September 25, 1996 the Senate Local Government Committee convened an interim hearing on Assemblywoman Napolitano&#146;s bill, AB 3248, which addresses the AQMD&#146;s public advisor/business outreach functions.  At that hearing, they debated for two hours on the extent to which AQMD had already fulfilled the assemblywoman&#146;s objectives.  The Committee heard testimony from both sides of the issue, and was not convinced that any problem existed that the bill specifically addressed.  Assemblywoman Napolitano is determined to carry forward her bill, and will be introducing new legislation in January 1997.  In the meantime, she intends to convene two local hearings under her own auspices before the Legislature comes back into session.

<P><OL START=25><LI>Amend Rule 1113 - Architectural Coatings
<P> Chairman Mikels indicated that several requests for a continuance of this item were submitted to the Board.  The proposed amended rule has generated a great amount of interest, and in order to provide an opportunity for everyone concerned to comment on the rule and to also avail themselves of all information available with regard to the rule, he planned to recommend, following public testimony, that the Board continue the public hearing to the November 8, 1996 Board meeting to receive further public testimony.
<P> Jack Broadbent, Assistant DEO of Stationary Source Compliance, presented the staff report.
<P> Mr. Silva questioned whether it was appropriate for the Board to consider at this time adopting amendments to the rule which would have effective dates five or more years in the future.  Mr. Antonovich questioned why, if the technology has already been developed, the lower VOC limits are set for such advanced dates, and not sooner.
<P> Mr. Broadbent responded that a number of manufacturers are already manufacturing low-VOC products, but not all manufacturers make those products.  Staff therefore believed it appropriate to establish future effective dates which provide a reasonable time frame for those manufacturers to be able to invest in the research and development necessary to make and market the low-VOC products.  Amending the rule so far in advance of the effective dates will also provide sufficient time for painting contractors to adjust to using the low-VOC paints.  The rule includes a commitment by staff to conduct technology assessments one year prior to each of the future compliance dates for flats and lacquers so that staff can re-evaluate the availability of complying coatings and, if necessary, bring proposed rule amendments back to the Board.
<P> In response to a question by Ms. Soto regarding involvement of small manufacturers in discussions on PAR 1113, Mr. Broadbent responded that small, medium and large companies have been involved.  Should the Board adopt the proposed amendments, staff will provide training for painting contractors in the field, and also provide training classes for manufacturers and others.
<P> Mr. Braude expressed his belief that AQMD&#146;s experience and success in pushing technology is perhaps its most distinguished accomplishment.  At his request, Ms. Leyden highlighted a few of the instances in which the AQMD was successful in contributing to the advancement of technology through technology-forcing regulations.
<P> In response to a suggestion by Ms. Soto, Mr. Broadbent indicated that staff will include California Polytechnic University, Pomona among those to be considered for contracting further coating studies associated with Rule 1113.
<P> The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from the following individuals:
<P><B><I> </I></B><B><I>Speaking in support of PAR 1113:</I></B>
<P>LINDA WAADE, Coalition for Clean Air
<BR><U>GAIL RUDERMAN FEUER, Natural Resources Defense Council</U>
<BR> Support the concept of the rule; however does not support the amendments proposed.  As currently written, believes the rule is inadequate, specifically as it relates to the time lines.  Zero-VOC flats are currently being manufactured by three or four different paint manufacturers, and the Coalition believes it is not practical or fair to give an additional 12 years for the rest of the industry to &quot;catch up&quot;.  The proposed amendment would move 25 percent of the emissions reductions that were included in the 1994 AQMP coatings measure into the infamous &quot;black box&quot; (emission reductions which rely on future technology advancement), and that is inappropriate since the technology exists today.  Urged the Board to revise the rule to shorten the time lines for implementation of the lower VOC limits.
<P><U>DAVID HERTZ, Architect and Educator at UCLA</U>
<BR> Commented on the adverse health effects of VOC from inhaling paint fumes--to those applying the paints and for those in the buildings where the paints are applied.
<P>BILL QUINN, California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance
<BR><U>LEE WALLACE, Pacific Enterprises/Southern California Gas Company</U><U> </U><U> </U>
<BR> Encouraged staff and industry to work together, particularly during the next month, to try to find technically-achievable limits for the paints.
<P><U>MARY ELLEN VOJTEK, Compliance Strategies</U>
<BR> Related her recent experience with the use of low-VOC Glidden flat paint, and commented that she was pleased with the color and appearance; and within half-an-hour of painting, there were no paint fumes detectable.
<P><U>JENNIFER BOWER, Orange County Fire Authority</U>
<BR> Commented regarding the flammability of acetone.  In comparing acetone to toluene, methyl ethyl ketone, butyl acetate and xylene; all of the substances were found to have identical physical and health classifications.  Based on the hazard classifications, acetone does not pose any greater hazard in comparison.

<BR><U>*JOHN BILLHEIMER, Consultant</U><U> </U><U> </U><U> </U><U> </U><U> </U>
<BR> Commented in support of the proposed exemption for areas located above 4,000 feet in elevation.  (*Submitted Written Comments)
<P><B><I> </I></B><B><I>Speaking in opposition to PAR 1113:</I></B>
<P><U>BARRY JENKIN, Benjamin Moore &amp; Company</U>
<BR> 1) Opposed the VOC limits proposed for 2001 and beyond--specifically for flats at 100 grams per liter (gpl) and 50 gpl because:  (i) lower VOC favors low-quality paint;  (ii)  Method 24 is not accurate at low VOC levels on water-based products, so there is no reliable confirmation mechanism or enforcement mechanism at 100 gpl or 50 gpl; and (iii) as a national company, need formulating flexibility and uniformity to supply quality products for all their customers, this can&#146;t be done at 100 or 50 gpl for flats.  2) Recommended:  (i) a VOC limit of 200 gpl for exterior flats and 100 gpl for interior flats effective in 2001;  (ii) that the rule require record retention by the manufacturer to be supplied on request rather than automatic data submission; and (iii) ongoing discussions to find ways of incorporating lower VOC paints into the rule and measuring compliance, including &quot;zero VOC&quot; products.  (Submitted Written Comments)
<P>BERT OSEN, Advance Finishes
<BR>FRED LEEGER, Fine Line Paint
<BR><U>CLIFFORD BURG, Painting &amp; Decorating Contractors Association</U>
<BR> Commented that low-VOC paints result in poor quality and increased prices.  Suggested that the VOC limits be the same as the national standards.
<P><U>ROBERT VANDERHOEK, Lilly Industries</U>
<BR> Commenting that the proposed 550 gpl VOC limit for lacquers is based on Rule 1136, the rule that controls the use of lacquers for wood products in an industrial setting, pointed out that industrial customers under Rule 1136 use a lacquer coating specifically designed for their spray equipment in an environment which can be controlled to a certain degree.  The painters are trained in the use of the product and the coating manufacturer works with the enduser to fine tune the product. Coating manufacturers are now, under PAR 1113, being asked to develop an off-the-shelf 550 gpl VOC lacquer that can be used by all contractors under a varied array of spraying equipment, which is a much more difficult task.
<P><U>DAVID LLOYD, National Paint &amp; Coatings Association</U>
<BR> Commented that the proposed limit of 100 gpl VOC for flat coatings, to be effective July 1, 2001, as judged by today&#146;s coating technology and reasonable expectations for the future, is too low to accommodate all of the current applications of flat coatings.  (Submitted Written Comments)
<P><U>CLAYTON MILLER, Construction Industry Air Quality Coalition</U>
<BR> Since the reformulation of architectural coatings is not to become effective for several years, urged the Board to defer action on PAR 1113 until the completion of several new surveys and research studies relevant to architectural coatings in progress or soon to begin.

<BR>*Submitted Written Comments
<P> In summary, the group recommended that the Board adopt those portions of the proposed amendments on which staff and the industry have agreed, and that the issues of contention--lower VOC limits for lacquers and flats--be not just delayed, but be completely removed from consideration until such time as there is up-to-date information and more sound science on which to base a recommendation for VOC content for those products.  The following points were made with respect to the technological and socioeconomic assessments performed by AQMD staff:  
<P>The surveys of painting contractors done by AQMD to determine thinning practices in the field for architectural coatings were not extensive enough and did not reflect a true assessment because when AQMD personnel are present, contractors often stop conducting activities that they would normally do.
<P>The socioeconomic impact assessment: (i) improperly assumes that the low-VOC limits will be met solely through reformulation;  (ii) does not address the impacts on independent retail dealers;  (iii) does not analyze the impacts to small businesses, nor competitiveness;  (iv) does not rank the cost effectiveness of the AQMP measures;  (v) does not address several alternatives to the proposed amendments that were discussed; and (vi) does not consider the adverse impacts that the rules may have on the working men and women and their families of the communities AQMD is trying to protect.
<P> With respect to averaging, the concept should be pursued further, but the provision proposed by staff relies on manufacturer certifications that are essentially unverifiable, which makes averaging unenforceable, with the exception of paperwork violations.
<P> There being no further testimony <I>at this time</I>,
<UL><P>MS. SOTO MOVED TO CONTINUE THE PUBLIC HEARING ON RULE 1113 TO THE NOVEMBER 8, 1996 BOARD MEETING, AT WHICH TIME ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY WILL BE TAKEN AND THE PUBLIC HEARING WILL BE CONCLUDED.  THE MOTION WAS SECONDED BY MS. LEE, AND PASSED BY A UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS PRESENT (Absent:  Antonovich, Braude and Burke).

<P> The staff report was given by Henry Hogo, Planning and Rules Manager.  The public hearing was opened, and the Board heard testimony from the following individuals:
<P>ROBERT WYMAN, Attorney, on behalf of COALESCE

<P> Expressed support of PR 1605 for the following reasons:  (i) Repair of gross polluting vehicles is among the most cost effective measures that exist to clean up the air, and is another important move towards market-based programs which provide both economic and air quality benefits;  (ii) PR 1605 will allow for the utilization of remote sensing in locations where it can be of its most optimum usage, for example, at high schools or colleges;  (iii) it will not only provide employers with an additional option in meeting their emission reduction requirement, but could also provide a much needed public service by providing vehicle repairs to those who would not otherwise be able to afford them;  (iv) it creates another mechanism to generate additional emission reduction credits;  and (iv) combined with AQMD&#146;s intercredit trading program, PR 1605 will provide more opportunities to achieve needed emission reductions for all the regulated community at a lower cost.
<P> With regard to the technical adjustment factor, Mr. Quinn emphasized the need to adjust the factor on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis, and to do so regularly, as additional data becomes available.

<br>BOARD MEETING DATE:  November 8, 1996 AGENDA NO. 10</b></center><br><br>

<p><b>Proposal:</b>

<blockquote>Approve Disposal of Obsolete or Non-Repairable Office Equipment and Furnishings
</blockquote>

<p><b>Synopsis:</b>
<blockquote>Certain office equipment and furnishings are obsolete, or are damaged and cannot be economically repaired.  AQMD&#146;s Contracting and Purchasing Policy provides that the Purchasing Manager may, by direct sales or otherwise, sell or dispose of any personal property belonging to the AQMD.  This action is to authorize:  (a) the deletion of the fixed assets from AQMD&#146;s inventory, and (b) the disposal, by direct sales, public auction, or donation, of the deleted fixed assets and other obsolete or non repairable equipment and furnishings.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Committee:</b>
<blockquote>Administrative, October 18, 1996, Recommended for Approval</blockquote>
<p><b>Recommended Action:</b><blockquote>Declare the items on the attached list to be surplus and authorize their deletion from the AQMD fixed asset inventory; and authorize the Purchasing Manager to dispose these fixed assets, and obsolete or damaged non-fixed assets, including office equipment and furnishing, by direct sales, public auction, or donation.</blockquote>
<br>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer
<br><hr>
<br><B>Background</B>

 Investments made through the AQIP would be used to fund stationary and mobile
source control strategies that could demonstrate real, quantifiable, surplus,
and enforceable emission reductions.  In addition, the proposed AQIP would
fund and implement air quality projects consistent with the overall control
strategy of the AQMD's Air Quality Management Plan to promote the advancement
of clean technologies.

<P>  Proposed rule is designed to provide a compliance option to those sources subject to AQMD rules and regulations, by allowing these sources to demonstrate compliance through investments in air quality projects that can produce equivalent or greater emission reductions or air quality benefit.  Investments made through the AQIP would be used to fund stationary and mobile source control strategies that could demonstrate real, quantifiable, surplus, and enforceable emission reductions.  In addition, the proposed AQIP would fund and implement air quality projects consistent with the overall control strategy of the AQMD&#146;s Air Quality Management Plan to promote the advancement of clean technologies.

<P><B><U>SECTION I - PUBLIC ADVISOR ACTIVITIES</U></B>
<P>Staff participated in the activities, programs and events listed below.  A statistical report of these activities also is included.
<P>Contact: La Ronda V. Bowen, Public Advisor, (909) 396-3235
<P><B>BUSINESS OUTREACH</B>
<P>INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENTAL COALITION OF ORANGE COUNTY - Staff provided a briefing to this organization of environmental professionals, letting them know about recent rule changes and upcoming hearings about the AQMP.
<P>RULE 1171 WORKING GROUP - Staff participated in the working group that developed the recently adopted Rule 1171, which requires conversion of metal-parts cleaning equipment from petroleum-based solvent to water-based solvent. This group included representatives from local sanitation districts, the Water Resources Board and the Institute for Research and Technology Advancement. The group recognized that for this rule to be successful and to avoid creating environmental problems at wastewater treatment facilities, the AQMD will have to spearhead an extensive outreach campaign to the estimated 40,000 businesses that use this equipment. The Public Advisor will join with representatives from local sanitation districts to develop and implement this outreach strategy.
<P>CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURVEYS - Staff completed the development of Survey Feedback Forms for engineers, small business assistance and compliance staff (Sample attached with Small Business Report).
<P><B><U>AQMP OUTREACH</U></B>
<P><li> AIR AND WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION, ORANGE COUNTY CHAPTER - Staff arranged for an AQMP presentation by the DEO of Planning, Transportation and Information Management to this professional organization (AWMA). The presentation was followed by comments from representatives of the environmental and business communities.  Approximately 30 people attended.
<P><li> AQMP WORKSHOPS - PADV facilitated seven AQMP Public Workshops;  3 in Los Angeles County, 1 in Orange County; 2 in Riverside County and 1 in San Bernardino County.
<P><B>COMMUNITY OUTREACH</B>
<P>COMMUTER FAIRS - Staff participated in several transportation and commuter fairs throughout the South Coast district, including in the cities of Anaheim and Fountain Valley, and at the Walt Distey Studios in Burbank, each of which attracted thousands of people.  September and October are the busiest months of the year for requests for the District to participate in such events.
<P>COMMUNICATING AIR QUALITY CONFERENCE -  Staff participated in the &quot;Communicating Air Quality Conference&quot; of the national association of state, territorial and local air pollution control officials (STAPPA/ALAPCO). At this conference, public information officers from all over the country share information on successful outreach programs for improving air quality awareness.  AQMD shared information on amnesty, Public Information Center automation and the Smogbusters program.
<P>CAPCOA PUBLIC OUTREACH COMMITTEE - Staff attended the quarterly meeting of public outreach officials from air districts throughout the state.  Air districts use these meetings as a way of sharing successful outreach programs and strategies and Staff will investigate a &quot;spare the air&quot; type of outreach for the south coast area.  The meeting included a presentation by the Bureau of Automotive Repair of the California Department of Consumer Affairs explaining the controversy surrounding the Smog Check II program.

<P><B><U>SECTION III - SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES</U></B>
<P>Highlights of the activities for September, specifically related to the Permit Assistance Centers and the loan guaranty program, are described below.  Attachment 1 is a statistical report of all staff activities.  Attachment 2 describes the current marketing plan for the Air Quality Assistance Fund.
<P>Contact Lee Lockie, Director, (909)396 -2390
<P><B>PERMIT ASSISTANCE CENTER HIGHLIGHTS FOR SEPTEMBER</B>
<P>Staff is scheduling an orientation for the Directors or key contacts at all seven Permit Assistance Centers to brief them on the AQMD permitting process and to give them a tour of the AQMD&#146;s headquarters building.   The marketing plans for all the centers, which were presented at the last Governing Board meeting, will now be implemented.  Business Assistance Surveys (Attachment 1, page 2-3) will be displayed in the Small Business Assistance Office lobby area and will be given to customers after they have been helped by Small business staff.
<P><B>Gas Company-Energy Resource Center - Downey</B>
<P>The joint efforts by staff of the AQMD and the Gas Company seem to be increasing the number of walk-in clients and allowing better use of this field assistance center in Downey.  During September, five complete applications for AQMD permits were filed at the ERC in Downey.  Two of the applications were for spray booths, two for metal melting furnaces, and one for a boiler.   Staff believes permit activity increased at the ERC this month because of the Gas Company&#146;s very focused outreach efforts.   Gas Company account executives have been marketing our permit services and the Air Quality Assistance Fund (AQAF) Program to a select group of customers who may need to apply for District permits and may need loan guarantees.  
<P>The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Gas Company and the AQMD has expired, and the Gas Company will be proposing an updated MOU that will reflect the present status of the District&#146;s commitment of staffing resources to the ERC.
<P><B>Orange County Permit Assistance Centers - Santa Ana and Lake Forest</B>
<P>The South Orange County Permit Assistance Center in Lake Forest is now open and is being staffed part-time by Orange County Health Department employees.  AQMD will service the businesses wishing to use this office by assigning its Orange County business representative to respond when paged.
<P>Last month, AQMD staff servicing this center conducted an active outreach program aimed at better informing businesses of AQMD requirements.  Staff met with the City of Anaheim Community Development Department to improve coordination of business permitting between the city and the AQMD.  In addition, staff met with several industrial products distributors including one manufacturer of equipment made of fiberglass and plastics (storage tanks, process tanks, and scrubbers).  This manufacturer has agreed to assist their customers in submitting complete permit applications for purchased equipment.  It is hoped that their assistance will help speed AQMD processing of each application.
<P><B>San Fernando Valley Permit Assistance Center - Van Nuys  </B>
<P>This center has historically been very active.  Permit assistance activity at this center has remained stable. Approximately three to six customers per week request help with AQMD permits at this center or at their worksite.
<P><B>Business Revitalization Center (BRC) - Baldwin Hills</B>
<P>AQMD staffs the BRC for  one-half day, every Thursday.  However, the BRC&#146;s Director is requesting that AQMD staff be present for an entire day to meet the increased demand for air quality information.  Staff has agreed to be at the office from approximately 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. one day per week, which is an increase of two hours per week.   More assistance will be provided as demand for our services increases.
<P>SBAO is utilizing the BRC as its base for actively outreaching to the African-American business community.  By working closely this year with the local business community, SBAO is gaining recognition in the Los Angeles area.  For example, at the BRC, a day has been set aside in October to honor and promote African-American businesses.  As part of the event, SBAO staff is scheduled to participate in a bus tour of revitalized areas followed by the Black Business Association Awards Luncheon, and later a gathering of minority businesses.  For the long term, staff has been invited to work with various minority businesses by way of hands-on participation and activities coordinated through the permit assistance center.
<P>Last month, through participation at the Governor&#146;s Business Revitalization Center at the Crenshaw Plaza, SBAO and the Regional Water Quality Board formed a partnership to conduct joint audits of 41 industrial sites throughout the Air Basin.  SBAO has been asked to assist Regional Water Quality Board and Metropolitan Transportation Authority with the redevelopment of an El Segundo industrial site.  These inter-agency projects highlight the cooperation that can exist in the redevelopment of the Los Angeles area and underline the importance of a firm AQMD commitment to assist.
<P><B>Los Angeles City Hall</B>
<P>Permit assistance staff members have increased their presence at the City Hall location to one-half day per week.  Customer questions are usually related to the restaurant and construction industries, and permits are requested primarily for spray booths.
<P>A hot-line phone, provides immediate toll-free access to the Small Business Assistance Office in Diamond Bar and is used by businesses to receive assistance when staff is not present.  Clearance letters can be turned around in less than 10 minutes by use of the nearby fax machine.
<P><B>Inland Empire Permit Assistance Center - Ontario</B>
<P>Permit assistance activity at this center has increased significantly in the past few months. During the month of September, most requests were for clearance letters.  In addition, several coordination meetings were held with potential new employers and new businesses during September.  The center also held an open house attended by many local elected officials and regulatory agency staff, including the AQMD.
<P>Cal/EPA has opened another permit assistance center in Riverside.  Staff has been asked to provide AQMD services at this location.
<P><B>Coachella Valley Permit Assistance Center - Palm Desert</B>
<P>The inquiries average approximately one to two per day at this center. New small business activities are relatively low.  Only one clearance letter was authorized at this center during this reporting period.  A Stationary Source Compliance staff person is currently assisting SBAO staff in servicing area businesses. In September, AQMD staff gave a presentation on the AQMP to the Palm Desert Chamber.  Brief focus was given to the center and its availability for public use.  Since then, the center has received calls from the local fire department requesting burn-day information.
<P><B>Other Issues</B>
<P>The Mayor of Torrance has requested that an AQMD staff member be available two days per month at the City Hall to assist customers in the Torrance area with air quality permits.  They now have office space available.  The City of Compton has also requested help.  In accordance with the individual needs of these cities, staff will be supporting both cities with their &quot;one-stop&quot; efforts to assist local businesses in their jurisdictions.

<br><br><P><b>Report:</b><blockquote> Lead Agency Projects and Environmental Documents 
<BR>Received by the AQMD</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> This report provides for the Board&#146;s consideration a listing of CEQA documents received by the AQMD between September 4, 1996 and October 5, 1996, and those projects for which the AQMD is acting as lead agency pursuant to CEQA.</blockquote>

<br> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br> Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P><B>EIR and Document Log (Attachments A and B)</B> - Each month, the AQMD receives numerous CEQA documents from other public agencies on projects which could adversely affect air quality.  A listing of all documents received for review during the past month is contained in Attachment A.  Monthly listings which are shaded note those CEQA documents for which the AQMD staff has or will prepare and submit comments to the lead agency.  A list of active projects from previous months for which AQMD staff is continuing to evaluate or prepare comments is included as Attachment B.  The column captioned &quot;Public Concerns&quot; identifies parties who have contacted the AQMD with concerns or issues about the proposed project.  A notation of 1 in this column indicates the contact was supportive of the project noted.  A notation of 2 indicates the party was opposed or expressed concerns about the project.  A notation of 3 indicates that no one contacted the AQMD about that project.
<P>In the past, AQMD staff routinely reviewed many of these documents and commented upon the air quality analyses and possible impacts on the air quality of the district.  Due to staffing constraints, the AQMD is no longer able to routinely comment on all CEQA documents received.  Publication of the Board-approved <I>CEQA Air</I> <I>Quality Handbook</I>, however, has provided local governments and other public agencies with the necessary information to prepare appropriate air quality analyses on projects for which they act as lead agency.  As resources permit, staff evaluates and may prepare comments for projects that may have significant adverse regional air quality impacts (e.g., special event centers, landfills, etc.) and those projects for which a lead or responsible agency has specifically requested AQMD review.
<P><B>AQMD Lead Agency Projects (Attachment C)</B> - Pursuant to CEQA, the AQMD periodically acts as lead agency on stationary source permit projects.  Under CEQA the lead agency is responsible for determining whether an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) or a Negative Declaration is necessary for any proposal considered to be a &quot;project&quot; as defined by CEQA.  An EIR is prepared when the AQMD as lead agency finds substantial evidence that the proposed project may have a significant adverse effect on the environment.  A Negative Declaration may be prepared if the AQMD determines that the proposed project will not generate significant adverse environmental impacts.  The Negative Declaration is a written statement describing the reasons a proposed project will not have a significant adverse effect on the environment and, therefore, does not require the preparation of an EIR.
<P>Attachment C to this report summarizes the active projects for which the AQMD is lead agency and is currently preparing or has prepared environmental documentation.  As noted in Attachment C, through September 1996, the AQMD continued working on CEQA documents for four (4) active projects.
<P>To date in 1996, the AQMD, as lead agency, prepared or contracted for the preparation of and certified four (4) CEQA documents for stationary source permit projects.

<hr><p>
<b>
Attendance:</b><p>
Present were Committee Chair Jon Mikels and Committee Members Candace 
Haggard, Mee Lee and Leonard Paulitz.  Supervisor James Silva was also present, not voting.
<p>
<b>Administrative Committee Discussion Items:</b><p>
Composition, Duties and Activities of the Advisory Council:  After review and discussion of the draft Board letter and resolution on this item, it was determined that the revised draft material should be circulated to the Districts various Advisory Groups for their consideration and input.  The revised draft Board letter and resolution, as well as suggestions from said Advisory Groups, will be reviewed by the Committee at its November 22, 1996 meeting for recommendation in anticipation of the December 13, 1996 Governing Board meeting.
<p>
Fiscal Impact of Proposed Amendments to Rule 219:  Staff briefed the Committee on the fiscal impact of removing permitted equipment from the system, pursuant to proposed amendments to Rule 219 to be brought to the December Board meeting.  Chair-man Mikels requested staff to include a determination of the Districts savings in staff time and other resources resulting from the removal of corresponding permit processing tasks.
Update on January 31, 1997 Legislative Summit:  Staff briefed the Committee on the format and focus of this event, and noted the need for Board Member involvement in the promotion of the same.
<p>
Provide Additional Funding for Technical Support of AQMDs Technology Advancement Program:  Upon Ms. Lees motion that this item be added to the Administrative Committee Agenda for discussion, and unanimous approval thereof, the Committee recommended approval of this item with the direction that the Board letter be amended to note the efficiency and feasibility of granting these nominal sole-source contracts as opposed to the more involved and expensive RFP process, as well as noting the Committees review and recommendation for approval of this item.  Dr. Lents advised that he has instructed staff to take the necessary steps to pre-qualify contractors for instances such as this.
<p>
<b>Approval of Compensation for Board Member Assistants:</b><p>  No recommendations.

<P><b>Report:</b><blockquote>Legislative Committee</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> The Legislative Committee held its regular meeting on Friday, 
  October 18, 1996.  The next Legislative Committee meeting is Friday, November 22, 1996 at 8:30 a.m. in Conference Room CC8.</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action</b>
<blockquote>Receive and file. </blockquote>
<P> Dr. William Burke, Chairman
<br> Legislative Committee
<P><hr>
<P><B>Attendance</B>
<P>Present were Legislative Committee Vice-Chair Roy Wilson, Governing Board Chairman Jon Mikels and Board Member Jim Silva.  In the absence of Committee Chair Dr. William Burke and Committee members Michael Antonovich and Nell Soto, and pursuant to the Procedures for Standing Committees of the Governing Board, adopted March 8, 1996, Chairman Mikels appointed himself to the Committee for the October 18, 1996, meeting only.  <I>Attachment 1</I> is an attendance record.
<P><B>Summary of AQMD Impacts from New Laws  </B>
<P>Staff provided a summary of the impact of 1996 legislation on AQMD programs (<I>Attachment </I><I>2</I>).  In the area of enforcement, staff reported that AB 2937 (Brulte) will require rulemaking to formally define &quot;minor&quot; vs. &quot;major&quot; violations.  There is no timeline specified in the law, but work to comply is already underway.  Some modifications will also be needed in the areas of Title V permits and planning cycles.  AB 1849 (Sher) puts new restrictions on the state board&#146;s consumer product authority.  Staff indicated there was the potential of a shortfall in the state implementation plan if emission reductions from these products can not be made up elsewhere.  Chairman Mikels asked what authority AQMD has over consumer products.  Executive Officer Jim Lents responded that AQMD has concurrent authority over all consumer products, except for aerosol paints and adhesives.  To date, however, AQMD has relied on CARB to adopt state standards for most consumer products.  This approach may need to be revisited.
<P><B>Update on Interim Hearings  </B>
<P>Staff updated the Committee on the interim hearings scheduled in the next few months (<I>Attachment 3</I>)  The Assembly Transportation and Natural Resources Committees held two hearings in Sacramento and Arcadia on Smog Check II.  There is much bipartisan concern over the program and its ability to identify gross polluters.  Senator Mountjoy has called for a special session of the Legislature prior to November 5 to deal with the issue.  The Senate Transportation Committee will have a separate hearing on November 12.  The AQMD was asked to testify at the Arcadia hearing on the importance of Smog Check II to this region.    
<P>The hearing on AQMD&#146;s PM10 attainment plan is scheduled for October 28 and will be conducted by the Senate Natural Resources Committee chaired by Senator Hayden.  It is expected to run from 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.  There will be three individual panels consisting of scientists, former AQMD Advisory Council Members and AQMD staff.  
<P>Reformulated gas will be the subject of a December 4 hearing by the Assembly Transportation Committee following complaints regarding tractors and utility equipment problems.  A hearing on the ban on freon will be held by the Assembly Environmental Safety and Toxics Committee on December 10.  It is expected that the Assembly Transportation Committee will hold a hearing sometime in January in San Diego on the mobile elements of the state implementation plan.  
<P><B>1997 Proposed Legislation for Continued PM10 Mitigation  </B>
<P>AB 2358 (Sher, 1994) gave cities the authority to lower speed limits on unpaved roads as a method of reducing PM10 emissions.  That authority sunsets on January 1, 1997.  The Legislative Committee concurred with staff&#146;s proposal to sponsor an urgency bill to extend this authority (<I>Attachment 4</I>).  Staff will seek co-sponsors and an author to carry this bill before the session begins.  Staff is evaluating the need for Legislation in other areas and will report back to the Committee should that need arise.  
<P><B>Other Business/Public Comment</B>
<P>Public member John Billheimer asked that mountain communities over 4,000 feet be exempted from AQMD&#146;s proposed Rule 1113 for architectural coatings.  Staff replied that due to problems with the waterborne coatings, these areas will not be subject to the rule.  Curt Coleman, representing the California Manufacturers Association&#146;s Southern California Alliance, said they had concerns about SB 836 (Lewis) and the membership of the Regional Transportation Agencies Coalition.  He told the Legislative Committee that the sponsor of SB 836 will submit clean-up language to the bill if needed in the next session.

<P><B>Minutes</B>
<P>The minutes of the September 26, 1996, monthly meeting were approved, as submitted.  These minutes are provided for your information as <I>Attachment 1</I>.
<P><B>Development of the Fiscal Year 1997-99 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program</B>
<P>The Lessons Learned Subcommittee, on which I participate, began its annual process toward developing the next work program.  Its first meeting was devoted to critiquing the strengths and weaknesses of past work programs and advocating changes for the next work program.  At the second meeting the Subcommittee debated several programs proposed by the committee and members of the public.  The Subcommittee also established groups to develop the five individual work program components being proposed for the FY 1997-99 AB 2766 Discretionary Work Program.  They are in the following areas:  1) Quick Charge 2, with additional focus on ultra-low OEM vehicles; 2) heavy-duty vehicles; 3) research; 4) TDM/Ridesharing/Rail Feeder; and 5) a $6 million AB 2766 20/80 (20% MSRC/80% cities) matching program aimed at encouraging and leveraging local entities&#146; use of their portion of AB 2766 City 
<BR>Subvention Funds for local government programs consistent with the AQMP.  The Lessons Learned Subcommittee has scheduled four additional meetings from 1-4 p.m. as follows: Thursday, November 7 in Orange County; Monday, November 25 in Redondo Beach; Friday, December 13 in San Fernando Valley; and Friday, December 20 at the AQMD.  It is anticipated that Requests for Proposals will be submitted to the Governing Board for consideration in either February or March 1997.  I will keep you posted as developments move forward.
<P><B>Reimbursement Report on Actual AB 2766 Discretionary Program Expenditures for FY </B><B>1995-96 Fourth Quarter</B>
<P>In June 1995 the MSRC approved the reimbursement of miscellaneous administrative and mailing costs for FY 1995-96 for an amount not to exceed $30,000.  Every quarter staff prepares a report on actual costs for the MSRC&#146;s approval.  For the final quarter of FY 1995-96 miscellaneous costs in the amount of $8,385.84 were reimbursed to the AQMD, for an annual total of $30,225.03.
<P><B>Receive and Approve Final Reports</B>
<P>The MSRC received and approved four final reports, as follows: 
<P> 
<P>1) El Segundo Employers Association Contract #C0033, which provided $100,000 for an El Segundo del Norte Metro Greenline Station;
<P>2) City of Los Angeles/Department of Transportation Contract #C94011, which provided $300,000 to developing the programs linking land-use with transportation;
<P>3) Bicycle Commuter Coalition of the Inland Empire Contract #C95005, which provided $43,452 for an Inland Empire Bicycle Commuter 
<BR>Project; and
<P>4) City of Lancaster Contract #C95009, which provided $140,330 for an EV Model Community Project.  
<P>All final reports for the AB 2766 Discretionary Program are filed in the AQMD's

<B>Background</B>
<p>
On April 14, 1995, the Board adopted Rules 1501 - Work Trip Reduction Plans and 1501.1 - Alternatives to Work Trip Reduction Plans to comply with federal and state requirements for extreme nonattainment areas.  Subsequently, on December 8, 1995, in response to state legislation prohibiting the mandatory submittal of trip reduction plans, the Board adopted Rule 2202 as a replacement rule that did not mandate trip reduction plan submittals, yet allowed the AQMD to remain in compliance with Federal and State Clean Air Act requirements.
<P>Rule 2202 provides members of the regulated community with a menu of flexible and cost-effective emission reduction strategies from which they can choose to implement and meet the emission reduction target for their site.  Compliance strategies made available to employers include old-vehicle scrapping, credits from clean on-road vehicles and off-road  equipment, the use of remote sensing to identify and subsequently repair gross polluting vehicles, and emission reduction credits from stationary sources.  In addition, employers earn credits for the use of alternative fuel vehicles, the reduction of vehicle miles traveled, and other trip reduction activities.  An Air Quality Investment Program (AQIP) is also provided to employers, as a compliance alternative, with options for a one year or three year compliance.  Furthermore, as an  alternative to meeting an emission reduction target, Rule 2202 allows companies that elect to continue implementing traditional rideshare plans to be deemed in compliance with the Rule.  Rule 2202, in its current form, applies to all employers with 100 or more employees per worksite.
<P>Since the implementation of Rule 2202, the AQMD has received positive feedback and employer  support for the options and the flexibility that the rule allows.  In fact, Rule 2202 has been  successfully implemented with more than 1,000 employer sites switching to the emission reduction based strategies and the AQIP options within the first nine months of the program.
<P>Nonetheless, Health &amp; Safety Code Sections 40458 and 44243.5 [ SB 836 (Lewis) passed by the State Legislature on August 28, 1996 and signed by the Governor on September 27, 1996 (Chapter #96-993)]  which will become effective on January 1, 1997 could lead to a phase-out of Rule 2202 pending its comparable emission reduction effectiveness with voluntary ridesharing or other replacement measures.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Amend Rule 2202 to be consistent with the new law which calls for the phase-out of Rule 2202 in three steps, provided that voluntary ridesharing and/or other replacement measures can achieve equivalent emission reductions to those achievable under Rule 2202.  The new law is summarized as follows:
<P><U>Phase I:  January 1, 1997 - June 1, 1998</U>
<P>Effective January 1, 1997, Rule 2202 compliance threshold shall increase to 250.  Thus employer worksites with 100-249 employees would fall out of the Rule.  From January 1, 1997 through January 1, 1998, the success or failure of voluntary ridesharing efforts in reducing emissions equivalent to what those employers would have achieved under Rule 2202 would be monitored.  On January 1, 1998, the emissions reductions of the voluntary effort would be reported to the ARB by the AQMD and SCAG.  If the emission reductions were not attained, the threshold would return to 100 and those employer worksites would again be subject to Rule 2202 by June 1, 1998.  If the emission reductions were attained, the compliance threshold of Rule 2202 would increase to 500 by June 1, 1998, and the rule implementation would proceed to Phase II.
<P><U>Phase II:  June 1, 1998 - January 1, 2000</U>
<P>Effective June 1, 1998, Rule 2202 compliance threshold would increase to 500.  Emission reductions from the voluntary rideshare efforts during Phase II would be monitored through June 1, 1999 and the findings reported to the ARB by the AQMD and SCAG.  If emission reductions equivalent to Rule 2202 were not attained, the threshold would return to 250 or to 100 by January 1, 2000.  If the emission reductions were attained, Rule 2202 would be suspended, the remaining employer worksites (with more than 500 employees) would be phased out by January 1, 2000, and rule implementation would proceed to Phase III.
<P><U>Phase III:  January 1, 2000 - January 1, 2001</U>
<P>If voluntary rideshare efforts are successful during Phase III in producing equivalent emission reductions to those that would have been achieved by the exempted worksites, Rule 2202 would be repealed and adopted as a backstop rule by June 1, 2001.  Beginning January 1, 2002, and each year thereafter, SCAG must report to the AQMD on the effectiveness of the voluntary rideshare efforts.  If the monitoring results show that voluntary rideshare efforts are not successful, and insufficient emission reductions have occurred, the appropriate employee threshold would be restored to replace emission reductions lost.
<P><B>Policy Issues</B>
<P>In order to facilitate a smooth transition from the current applicability threshold (employer sites with 100 or more employees) to the new one (employer sites with 250 or more employees) that will be effective January 1, 1997, staff is proposing several policy recommendations included in Attachment A.
<P><B>AQMP and Legal Mandates</B>
<P>The State and Federal Clean Air Acts require the AQMD to develop and implement employer-based emission reduction programs.  The proposed amendment will allow the AQMD to obtain equivalent emission reductions as those currently achieved through Rule 2202.
<P>The baseline for the 1994 AQMP and the SIP includes emission reductions from Rule 2202 and its predecessors, Rules 1501 and 1501.1.  The proposed amendments will fulfill the AQMP and SIP emission reduction commitments, since the amendments are designed to achieve equivalent emission reductions.  In addition, the proposed amendments were developed to implement the requirements of the new law and meet the requirements of Section 182(d)(1)(B) of the Federal Clean Air Act.
<P><B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B>
<P>AQMD staff reviewed the proposed amendments to Rule 2202, and determined with certainty that the proposed project is exempt from the requirements of CEQA.  The proposed project is exempt pursuant to state CEQA Guidelines Section 15268 - Ministerial Projects.  The Notice of Exemption will be filed with the county clerks immediately following the adoption of the proposed amendments (see Attachment G).
<P>This rule amendment is required by state law (SB 836, Lewis).  The Board has determined that Rule 2202 does not significantly affect air quality or emissions limitations and therefore no socioeconomic report is required.
<P><B>Implementation Plan</B>
<P>In order to inform the public about the new law and the proposed amendments to Rule 2202, approximately 9,500 letters were sent out to employers in the Basin along with an information sheet entitled &quot;Rule 2202 Policy Issues Related to SB 836.&quot;  A public workshop and an informational workshop on the proposed rule changes were held in the morning and afternoon of October 9, 1996, respectively.  A list of organizations that attended the public workshop can be found in Attachment E, and a summary of comments received during the public comment period and AQMD responses to those comments are included in Attachment C.
<P>The new law requires the AQMD and SCAG to report to the ARB on the effectiveness of voluntary rideshare and/or other replacement measures on January 1, 1998, June 1, 1999 and January 1, 2001.  Prior to moving to the next phase of applicability adjustment, the ARB must determine that during the previous phase, voluntary rideshare and/or other replacement measures have resulted in emission reductions equivalent to those that would have been achieved by exempted employer worksites.  Therefore, monitoring and tracking the effectiveness of voluntary rideshare and other replacement measures relative to Rule 2202 is of paramount importance for the successful implementation of the new law.  The importance of demonstrating that emission reductions obtained from voluntary rideshare programs are real, quantifiable, and surplus also has been reiterated by the United States EPA in their letter to Board Chairman Mikels dated June 14, 1996.
<P>The AQMD is currently working with SCAG, ARB, EPA and the Regional Transportation Agencies Coalition (RTAC) to expeditiously develop a methodology that will be used to track and quantify the emissions reduced by voluntary rideshare efforts.
<P><B>Emission Impacts</B>
<P>The number of worksites currently subject to Rule 2202 is estimated at 4,300 sites.  There are approximately 1,060,000 employees that report to these sites during the a.m. peak window.  Rule 2202 currently eliminates 93.8 tons of pollutants per day.  This consists of 6.7 tons per day of VOCs, 7.5 tons per day of NO<SUB>x</SUB>, and 79.6 tons per day of CO.  Table 1 and Chart 1 of Attachment B summarize the employer categories that will be affected by the three phases, as well as other relevant statistics, such as the number of worksites, the number of employees, and the corresponding emission reduction contributions in each category.
<P><B>Resource and Fiscal Impacts</B>
<P>The new law requires the AQMD to annually appropriate $1.5 million to the Regional Transportation Agencies Coalition for marketing and client services related to voluntary rideshare.  This will mean an annual loss of $1.5 million from the AQMD&#146;s small business loan guarantee program between January 1, 1997 and January 1, 1999.  The existing fund has a balance of $4.6 million, of which $1.1 million is encumbered with actual loan guarantees.  The AQMD can spend $3.0 million from this account without jeopardizing existing loans.  However, the AQMD&#146;s ability to guarantee future loans might be constrained.  After January 1, 1999, the AQMD must determine how continuing appropriation will be funded.  Penalty revenues ($1.0 million per year) are now spent on small business assistance and outreach programs.  The AQMD&#146;s share of funds received under the AB 2766 (Sher) Motor Vehicle Registration Fee program ($12 million per year), covers the vehicle-weighted costs of basic air quality programs, including, but not limited to, emissions inventory, modeling, ambient monitoring, and planning.
<P>The exemption of employer worksites with less than 250 employees will result in an annual loss of approximately $1.0 million in reduced employer fees starting January 1, 1997.  Rule 2202 currently generates $2.3 million per year by way of employer fee revenue.  This amount is augmented by the AQMD with $300,000 for a total program expenditure of $2.6 million.
<P>In order to smooth the transition to the 250 employee threshold, staff is proposing to allow employers with less than 250 employees to submit AVR survey results in lieu of their Employer Commute Reduction Programs (ECRP) due through December 31, 1996.  Waiving the ECRP and Annual Analysis filing fees for those employers during the same period is also part of staff&#146;s recommendations.  The revenue loss due to the waiving of the filing fees during the transition period is estimated at $400,000.
<P>In lieu of submitting AVR survey results, staff is also proposing to allow employers with fewer than 250 employees and with due dates through December 31, 1996, to participate in the AQIP or other emission reduction options of Rule 2202.  Employers would pay the applicable evaluation/registration fee in full and a prorated fraction of the $60 per employee annual AQIP fee to meet their emission reduction target that corresponds to the time period between their due date and December 31, 1996.  Since AQMD staff time will be required to monitor and track the AQIP fees as well as the purchase and surrender of emission reduction credits, staff is not proposing to waive the fees related to these submittals.

<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br> Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<p>Rule 1113 is applicable to manufacturers, distributors, and end-users of architectural and industrial maintenance (AIM) coatings.  It was first adopted in 1977, and has un-dergone numerous amendments.  The purpose of the rule is to reduce VOC emissions from the use of AIM coatings, primarily by placing VOC limits on various coating categories.
<P>On August 21, 1990, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County entered a judgment against AQMD in the case <U>Dunn-Edwards Corporation, et al. vs. SCAQMD, et al.</U>  The judgment denied in part, and granted in part, the petition for writ of mandate seeking to overturn certain amendments made in February, 1990.  As a result, the AQMD was prevented from enforcing the lower VOC limits for aerosol coatings, industrial maintenance coatings, lacquers, quick-dry enamels, and quick-dry primers, sealers and undercoaters.  This judgment impacted approximately 4.5 tons per day (tpd) of VOC emissions.  The AQMD has contracted Eastern Michigan University to further study the impacted coating categories, with the exception of lacquers.  Other amendments adopted in February 1990 and prior rule provisions remained in effect.  The proposed amendments will formally reinstate the limits as existing prior to February 1990, except for lacquers, which is again proposed to be lowered.
<P>The proposed amendments will lower the VOC limits for some coating categories not impacted by the court judgment, with the exception of lacquers.  The proposed lower VOC limits are all based on the concept of reformulation of existing coatings, either with water, acetone, or resin technology.  The proposed amendments will increase the VOC limit for coating categories that have been under variance for the past three years, and address issues raised since the September 6, 1991 amendments.  These include addition of and modification to some definitions, synchronizing final compliance dates for coating categories, and updating the analytical test methods.
<P>As a part of this rulemaking effort, a complete technology and environmental assessment was conducted for all coatings, including lacquers, to comply with the court judgment.  In addition, as part of the rulemaking activities for Rule 1136 - Wood Products Coatings, this coating category was extensively studied and received support from industry for the proposed VOC limits in a manufacturing setting.  Staff conducted a survey which showed that industry uses the same types of lacquers in the field as in a manufacturing setting.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>The following VOC limits are proposed to be lowered:
<P><I>Flat Coatings</I>
<P>Lower the VOC limit for flats from 250 g/l to 100 g/l, effective July  1, 2001 and further reduce from 100 g/l to 50 g/l, effective July 1, 2008.  Conduct a technology assessment for feasibility by July 1, 2000 for the 100 g/l limit and by July 1, 2007 for the 50 g/l limit.  Include an averaging provision to allow manufacturers to average the VOC content of their flat coatings, on a sales weighted basis upon plan submittal and approval.  Appendix A of Proposed Amended Rule (PAR) 1113 contains sections on the averaging, operational plan and reconciliation plan content requirements, modification or cancellation of the plan, and plan approval timeframes.
<P><I>Lacquers</I>
<P>Establish the VOC limit for lacquer at 680 g/l, then lower it to 550 g/l, effective January 1, 1998, and to 275 g/l, effective January 1, 2005.  Conduct a technology assessment for feasibility of the 275 g/l limit by January 1, 2004.  Include an exemption for lacquers to add up to 10% retarder during cool, humid days.
<P><I>Multi-Color Coatings</I>
<P>Lower the VOC limit for multi-color coatings from 420 g/l to 250 g/l, effective January 1, 1998.
<P><I>Traffic Coatings</I>
<P>Lower the VOC limit for traffic coatings from 250 g/l to 150 g/l, effective January 1, 1998.
<P>Staff recommends deletion, consolidation, and addition of definitions, as well as reinstatement of VOC limits and definitions pursuant to the Superior Court judgment.  These include industrial maintenance primers and topcoats at 420 g/l, quick-dry enamels at 400 g/l, and a definition and exemption for quick-dry primers, sealers, and undercoaters.  The exemption for quick-dry primers, sealers and undercoaters will continue as a result of the Superior Court judgment, provided the manufacturer continues to submit to the Executive Officer annual reports of those coatings sold in the AQMD.
<P>Staff recommends to increase the VOC limits for certain specialty coating categories that are currently under variance because they cannot comply with the current VOC limits.  These include exterior fire-proofing coatings, magnesite cement coatings, and japans/faux finishing coatings.
<P>In addition, staff has reorganized the Table of Standards coating categories into alphabetical order, eliminated coating categories that have been at the default 250 g/l limit of paragraph (c)(1) for at least three years, and consolidated similar categories with the same VOC limit.
<P>Lowering the VOC limits for flats, traffic, multi-color, and lacquers will achieve an emission reduction of 10.5 tpd.  Partially offsetting these reductions will be an increase of 0.14 tpd for japans, magnesite, and fire-proofing coatings;  however, these coatings have been under variances for the past several years, therefore actual emissions will not increase.

<P><B>Policy Issues</B>
<p>Industry members, mainly manufacturers and contractors, provided several suggestions and introduced issues that they claimed need additional research.  The Environmental Legislative & Regulatory Advocacy Program (EL RAP) has seven main issues, which include: more thickness, more thinning, more priming, more topcoats, more touch-ups and repair work, more frequent recoating, and more reactivity.  Due to these seven issues, some manufacturers claim that coatings with higher VOC content will be substituted for the proposed lower VOC content coatings resulting in an increase in VOC emissions.  They also claim a larger amount of low-VOC coatings will be used, resulting in an actual increase in VOC emissions.  Additionally, a few manufacturers expressed concern regard-ing the fire hazards associated with acetone-based nitrocellulose lacquers.  Lastly, manu-facturers expressed concern regarding the lack of sufficient time necessary for research and development of the reformulated coatings.
<P>The seven issues focus on two main points.  The first six issues all state that the new formulations, either solvent-based or waterborne, result in more coating use and an overall increase in VOC emissions over a period of time.  The seventh issue involves the reactivity of solvents used in waterborne coatings.  EL RAP contends that these result in more ozone formation as compared to solvents in solvent-based formulations.
<P>In response to these concerns, the staff analyzed each of the specific issues raised by EL RAP and either addressed them through analysis in the attached Final Subsequent Environmental Assessment (SEA) or through proposed rule amendments.
<P>With regards to additional thinning, the focus of the proposed amendments is limited to coatings that are strictly waterborne formulations or based on acetone as a substitute solvent, thereby eliminating any concerns of thinning the coating, as supplied, with VOC.
<P>To examine the issues of thickness, priming, topcoats, touch-up and repair, and frequent recoating, staff used coating coverage estimates, typical dry mil thickness, recommended priming, and estimated life of coating, listed on container labels and technical data sheets or provided by manufacturers during personal interviews and phone surveys.  A thorough analysis comparing emissions from the proposed lower-VOC content coatings with emissions from potential substitute coatings clearly shows an overall VOC emission reduction as a result of the proposed amendments.  An extensive discussion regarding the feasibility of reactivity-based ozone control policy development is included in the attached staff report to address the seventh issue.
<P>To date, manufacturers have not provided data to support the claim that the lower VOC coatings could cause an increase in emissions.  As a part of the current rulemaking efforts, staff has requested life-cycle studies that may have been conducted over the past seven years, but none were provided.
<P>The Final SEA also analyzes any additional hazards associated with acetone usage.  Staff interviewed fire chiefs from various fire departments, and received follow-up letters, which all indicate that explosion or fire hazards associated with acetone use are no greater than hazards associated with solvents currently used in coating formulations, especially nitrocellulose lacquers.  In contrast, acetone is significantly less toxic than the solvents found in conventional nitrocellulose lacquers.
<P>Staff has proposed several amendments to Rule 1113 to address concerns raised relative to sufficient time to research, develop, and market compliant coatings.  The proposed amendments provide a five-year and a twelve-year time period for future compliance limits for flats and up to an eight-year time period for lacquers, as well as an averaging provision for the flat coatings that would allow manufacturers to offset non-compliant flat coatings with super-compliant flat coatings.  The AQMD has also committed to a technology assessment one year prior to the future rule limits for both flats and lacquers.

<P><B>AQMP and Legal Mandates</B>
<P>The 1994 AQMP estimates increased AIM emissions (due to population growth) at 67.1 tpd in 1994, growing to 72.1 tpd by the year 2000 and 83.0 tpd by the year 2010, without additional AIM regulations.  If left unchecked, AIM coating emissions alone would account for 26 % of the allowed VOC emissions in 2010, up from 6% of total VOC emissions in 1994.  Therefore, the 1994 AQMP has a specific control measure (CTS-07) to reduce AIM VOC emissions by 75 % by the year 2010.  This 62 tpd emission reduction is the largest of all short and intermediate term control measures, larger even than the earlier proposed VOC RECLAIM program.
<P>Installation of air pollution control equipment is not feasible for reducing AIM emissions, thereby leaving coating reformulation as the only possible means to achieve the required reductions.  The current proposal emphasizes reformulation of existing coatings, primarily by substituting acetone for other, more toxic and reactive solvents, or by using technologically-innovative resins that require a small amount of solvent for coalescence.
<P>These proposed Rule 1113 amendments are a small portion of the 1994 AQMP because they include lowering the VOC limits for only a few of the coating categories discussed in the control measure.  The proposed amendments will only reduce AIM emissions by 17.5%, which is only a small part of the 75% emission reduction that will eventually be required from AIM coatings.
<P>An extensive study is currently being conducted to assess the possibility of further emission reductions.  This study may lead to a future rule amendment in 1997.
<P><B>CEQA</B>
<P>Pursuant to the CEQA and AQMD Rule 110 - Rule Adoption Procedures to Assure Protection and Enhancement of the Environment, AQMD prepared a Draft SEA for the proposed amendments to Rule 1113.  The Draft SEA was circulated for a 45-day public review and comment period which ended on August 16, 1996.  All comments received on the Draft SEA and responses to comments are incorporated into the Final SEA for the proposed project.  No comments required substantive changes to the document.
<P><B>Socioeconomic Analysis</B>
<P>Staff has thoroughly evaluated the cost of compliance with the proposed amendments, which is included as Appendix H of the final staff report.
<P><B>Implementation Plan</B>
<P>A notice will be sent to all AIM coating manufacturers.

<P><B>Resource Impact</B>
<P>Existing AQMD resources will be sufficient to implement the proposed changes to this rule with minimal impact on the budget.

BOARD MEETING DATE:  November 8, 1996 AGENDA NO. 2</b></center>
<P><b>Proposal:</b><blockquote> Set Public Hearing to Amend Rule 1124 - 
  Aerospace Assembly and Component Manufacturing Operations</blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> Proposed amendments will extend the compliance dates for several types of adhesive bonding primers, fuel-tank coatings, solid-film lubricants and primer coatings from 1997 to either 1998, 2000 or 2002 because compliant coatings have not been qualified by all major aerospace companies.  In addition, the VOC limits are proposed to be decreased for dry lubricative coatings.</blockquote>
<P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote> Stationary Source, November 22, 1996, Scheduled for Review 
</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action:</b> 
<blockquote>Set Public Hearing December 13, 1996, to amend Rule 1124 - Aerospace Assembly and Component Manufacturing Operations.</blockquote>
<P>  James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br>  Executive Officer
<hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The purpose of Rule 1124 - Aerospace Assembly and Component Manufacturing Operations, is to reduce VOC emissions from aircraft and space craft coating, assembly and cleaning operations.  Rule 1124 applies to any operation associated with manufacturing aircraft and space vehicles including spare parts, rework, and related maintenance of these vehicles.  Rule 1124 was first adopted in 1979, and has undergone numerous amendments.  In 1987, Rule 1124 was amended to require reductions of the VOC content in a number of coating categories including:  adhesives, fuel-tank coating, and primers.  In 1990, solid-film lubricant was added as a coating category. 
<P>In 1992, the Board extended the deadline to achieve the lower VOC grams per liter (g/l) standards to January 1, 1994.  In December of 1993, the Board again extended the deadline for achieving the lower VOC content standards for three coatings (fuel-tank coatings, barrier coatings and wire coatings) to January 1, 1996 and for two additional coatings (adhesive bonding primers and solid-film lubricant) to January 1, 1997.  
<P>Several aerospace facilities have approached the AQMD requesting an extension of time to comply with the lower VOC content requirements that become effective January 1, 1997.  The request is based on the fact that not all aerospace companies have qualified coatings that meet the lower VOC g/l requirements.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>The proposed amendments will expand the primer coating category into two sub-categories and postpone the VOC compliance date for the commercial exterior aerodynamic structure sub-category from January 1997 to January 2000.  This rule amendment will divide the adhesive bonding categories into seven sub-categories and postpone the existing VOC compliance dates for five sub-categories from January 1997 to January 2000 and January 2002.  The proposed amendments will divide the fuel-tank coating category into two sub-categories and postpone the VOC compliance date for the epoxy fuel-tank coating sub-category from January 1997 to January 1998.
<P>An exemption from the current fuel-tank coating VOC content limit is proposed until January 2002 for non-spray applications of rubber solution fuel-tank coatings at facilities which use less than 150 gallons per year on fuel-tanks having a maximum capacity of 35 gallons.  In addition, a minor reduction in the existing VOC limitation for dry lubricative material in the fastener coatings category is proposed and the compliance date for solid-film lubricant is proposed to be deferred from January 1997 to January 1998.
<P>Acetone is now considered an exempt material pursuant to EPA&#146;s requirements.  This rule amendment now references Rule 102 - Definition of Terms for acetone and all other compounds considered exempt instead of maintaining a separate list in Rule 1124.  This will prevent further modification to Rule 1124 in the event new future compounds are added to the VOC exempt list.
<P><B>AQMP and Legal Mandates</B>
<P>The proposed amendments are estimated to result in excess emissions of 49 tons/year to 231 tons/year, or 0.13 tons/day to 0.63 tons/day.  However, this delay in the final emission reductions anticipated to occur from Rule 1124 is not projected to negatively affect attainment of the ozone standard by 2010.
<P><B>CEQA Findings/Socioeconomic Analysis</B>
<P>The proposed amendments are considered significant pursuant to CEQA.  As such, staff prepared a Draft Supplemental Environmental Assessment (SEA) for the proposed amendments to Rule 1124.  The Draft SEA was circulated for a 45-day public review and comment period.  The proposed amendments to Rule 1124 are in response to issues raised by the aerospace industry and aerospace coating manufacturers and will delay emission reductions with no changes in the final VOC limits.  Therefore, there is no additional cost impact resulting from this amendment.
<P><B>Key Issues</B>
<P>There are several key issues involved in these proposed rule amendments. Following are the key issues:
<P><li> High Temperature/Military Adhesive Bonding Primers
<P>The aerospace industry requested permanent higher VOC content limits to address a limited use specialized coating.  This coating falls under the existing exemption for limited uses and, therefore, staff is not recommending changes to the rule since industry&#146;s concern is addressed by the existing exemption provision.
<P><li> Definitions
<P>Industry is recommending definitions that are non-specific and open-ended (i.e., &quot;substrate neutral&quot; and &quot;wide curing temperature band&quot;).  Staff believes that for consistent field interpretation and enforcement  the definitions need to be specific in order to prevent coatings from being classified in a number of sub-categories.
<P><li> CTG comparisons
<P>The aerospace industry is concerned about discrepancies between Rule 1124 and the CTG currently being drafted by the EPA.  The revised CTG is not available at this time.  Staff will consider changes at a later date after the revised CTG is issued.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>Existing AQMD resources will be sufficient to implement all of the proposed changes to the rule with no impact on the budget.

BOARD MEETING DATE: November 8  1996 AGENDA NO. 3</b></center>
<br><br><P><b>Proposal:</b><blockquote> Amend Rule 1130.1 - Screen Printing Operations </blockquote>
<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> Proposed amendments will address concerns raised by the industry, ink manufacturers, and staff by creating higher VOC limits for various screen printing operations and postponing the implementation of the lower VOC limit for extreme performance applications.  The amendments will result in a permanent emission reduction loss of 0.1 ton per day and delay the 0.28 ton per day emission reduction associated with extreme performance applications from 1998 to 2003.</blockquote>
<P><b>Committee:</b><blockquote> Stationary Source, November 22, 1996, Scheduled for Review</blockquote>
<P><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>Set Public Hearing December 13, 1996 to amend Rule 1130.1 - Screen Printing Operations
</blockquote>
<P> James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br> Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Rule 1130.1 - Screen Printing Operations regulates emissions of VOCs from screen printing operations.  Screen prints are created by passing printing materials (inks, coatings, or adhesives) through stenciled screens.  Products produced include T-shirts, indoor and outdoor signs, posters, decals, printed circuit boards, banners, and skateboards.  There are approximately 3,000 to 4,000 screen printers in the AQMD.
<P>Prior to the adoption of Rule 1130.1 on August 2, 1991, screen printers were subject to the requirements of Rule 1130 - Graphic Arts.  At the request of the screen printing industry, Rule 1130.1 was developed to reflect the vast array of inks and substrates used by the industry.  The  original rule required the use of low-VOC screen printing materials to minimize VOC emissions from screen printing operations.  The VOC limits for screen printing materials were established for specific products, substrates, and general categories and took effect on  July 1, 1992.  The rule also contained many technology-forcing VOC limits with a future implementation date of January 1, 1995.  These effective dates were developed through the combined efforts of ink manufacturers, screen printers, the Screenprinting &amp; Graphic Imaging Association International and AQMD staff.  At the time Rule 1130.1 was adopted, it was estimated that implementation of the July 1, 1992 and January 1, 1995 VOC limits would result in an emission reduction of 3.07 tons per day.
<P>While the vast majority of screen printers complied with the July 1, 1992 VOC limits, approximately 200 screen printers requested and received variances from the AQMD Hearing Board during the second half of 1992.  Based on the testimony provided at the hearings and independent investigations, AQMD staff determined that, for certain applications, compliant inks with acceptable performance characteristics were either not available or the available compliant technology was not cost-effective.  The rule was amended on July 9, 1993 to reflect the available feasible technology.  In this amendment, the VOC limits were increased for those products and substrates for which compliant inks were either unavailable or cost prohibitive.  However, most of the final technology-forcing limits, which were to become effective on January 1, 1995,  were not changed.  This approach was taken to encourage ink manufacturers to aggressively pursue the development of low-VOC inks and, in the interim, allow screen printers and ink manufacturers to comply with the rule.  Based on changes included in the amendment, the emission reductions associated with the rule were revised from 3.07 to 2.76 tons per day.
<P>Due to the development of new screen printing materials, compliance with the January 1, 1995 rule limits was possible for many applications.  However, there were certain products, substrates, and screen printing materials for which compliance was not achievable because either compliant screen printing materials with the required performance characteristics had not been developed or the compliant technology was cost prohibitive.  As a result, six major ink manufacturers were granted product variances for specific screen printing materials and applications in late 1994 and early 1995.  These product variances are scheduled to expire in December 1996.  Most of the screen printed products covered under these variances are made of plastics.  However, products made of other substrates such as metal and man-made textiles are also included in these variances.
<P>The quantity of inks used on the products covered by the variances in the AQMD is relatively low.  As a result, there is very little incentive for resin manufacturers and ink formulators to develop compliant inks.  Moreover, VOC emissions associated with these products are low.  Thus, AQMD staff is proposing to increase the limits for these products without any future technology-forcing limits.  AQMD staff is also proposing to delay the January 1, 1998 limit of 3.3 lbs/gal for the extreme performance category until January 1, 2003.  As a result of these proposed amendments, the emission reductions due to the implementation of this rule are being revised to 2.67 tons per day.  To date, the rule has resulted in an emission reduction of 2.39 tons per day which is 78% of the emission reduction originally proposed in 1991.
<P><B>Proposal</B>

<P>1. Increase the current limit of 400 gms/liter to 800 gms/liter effective December 13, 1996 for the following screen printed products, substrates, and screen printing materials.
<ul><li>Plastic containers such as bottles, pails, jars, and tubes.
<P><li> Plastic mechanically-formed products such as bike helmets, restaurant table signs, and embossed control panels.
<P><li> Opaque inks used for making water slide decals.
<P><li>Plastic overlays used in products such as computer keyboards, control panels, and microwave ovens.
<P><li> Flags, banners, signs, or displays made of polyethylene plastic.
<P><li> Sub-printed products.  These are plastic products where the ink is printed on the unexposed side and then covered with an adhesive to allow the product to be attached to another substrate.
<P><li> High-VOC serigraph inks used  for making color paintings.
<P><li>Scratch-off inks used to make products such as lottery tickets and contest games.
<P><li> Man-made textile products such as banners, flags, tote bags, and jackets.
</ul>
<P>2. Increase the existing VOC limit of 400 gms/liter to 600 gms/liter for printing on glass and metal for decorative purposes.  This limit will be consistent with the existing limit for printing on glass and metal for specification purposes.
<P>3. Increase the existing VOC limit of 600 gms/liter to 800 gms/liter for dyes used on unsealed aluminum substrates. 
<P>4. Increase the existing VOC limit of 400 gms/liter to 540 gms/liter for fluorescent inks.  Fluorescent inks glow brighter than conventional inks when exposed to the same light and are used on posters and banners.
<P>5. Increase the existing 400 gms/liter VOC limit to 745 gms/liter for fine detail looseleaf binder ink.  These inks are used on looseleaf binders to print very small graphics on darker backgrounds.
<P>6. Delay the future 400 gms/liter limit for extreme performance inks from January 1, 1998 to January 1, 2003.
<P>7.  Restrict the high-VOC serigraph ink usage to 10% (by volume) of the total serigraph inks used at a facility, on a monthly basis.
<P>8. Establish a minimum control device efficiency at 95% by weight.
<P>9. Include the capture efficiency test methods revised by the USEPA.
<P>10. Establish that all test methods referenced in the rule shall be the most recent versions approved by the AQMD, ARB, and USEPA.
<P>11. Delete the reference to variances granted by the AQMD Hearing Board from the rule because USEPA does not recognize these variances. 
<P>In addition, staff has added a rule &quot;Purpose&quot; section, modified the &quot;Applicability&quot; section, added a reference to the exempt compound list in Rule 102, and improved the rule language by adding, deleting, and refining definitions.
<P>Increasing the VOC limits will result in a permanent emission reduction loss of  approximately 0.1 ton per day.  Additionally, delaying the extreme performance future limit to the year 2003 will result in a delay of 0.28 ton per day emission reduction.

<P><B>AQMP</B>
<P>The 1994 AQMP contained control measure CM #94CTS-I for further emission reductions from the screen printing industry.  During the development of the 1997 AQMP, it was determined that further emission reductions from this industry may not be cost-effective.  For this reason, the control measure for this industry is proposed to be included in the &quot;Further Evaluation Measures&quot; category.
<P><B>CEQA</B>
<P>The AQMD has reviewed the proposed amendments to Rule 1130.1 pursuant to CEQA and has prepared a Draft Subsequent Environmental Assessment (SEA).  The Draft SEA analyzes the potential adverse environmental impacts associated with the proposed project and has been released for a 45-day public review and comment period, ending November 8, 1996.  All comments received on the Draft SEA will be responded to and incorporated into the Final SEA.
<P><B>Socioeconomic Analysis</B>
<P>Preliminary socioeconomic analysis indicates that no adverse socioeconomic impacts are expected from the proposed amendments to Rule 1130.1.
<P><B>Implementation Plan</B>
<P>Staff is working with industry to help screen printers understand the rule more clearly and comply with its requirements.  At the request of industry, staff has already developed and submitted a guideline on obtaining an extreme performance classification approval for industry&#146;s comments.  A final version of this document should be available to screen printers by early December, 1996.

<P><B>Resource Impact</B>
<P>Existing AQMD resources will be sufficient to implement the proposed changes to this rule with no impact on the budget.

<P><b>Synopsis:</b><blockquote> Rule 219 identifies equipment and processes which are exempt from AQMD written permits.

<P><b>Recommended Action:</b>
<blockquote>Set Public Hearing December 13, 1996 to Amend 
 Rule 219 - Equipment Not Requiring a Written Permit Pursuant to Regulation II</blockquote>
<P>  James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<br>  Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>Rule 219 is an administrative rule which identifies certain equipment categories for exemption from AQMD written permit.  This rule has been amended several times, the last on August 12, 1994.  This rule amendment was prompted by the adoption of the 1996 AQMD Regulatory Reform Initiative, as well as various changes to state law.  For this rule amendment, emphasis was based on achieving the following objectives:

<P><ul><li> Implement the first tier of the 1996 AQMD Regulatory Reform Initiative by exempting certain equipment categories with negligible emission potential and those chlorinated fluorinated carbon (CFC) recovery or recycling systems currently subject to EPA&#146;s Refrigerant Certification Program requirements.
<p>
<li> Provide consistency with California Health and Safety Code Section (H&amp;SC) 41753, which preempts local air districts from imposing permitting requirements on portable internal combustion engines participating in the Statewide Registration Program (H&amp;SC 41750~41755).
<p>
<li> Address implementation of state ATCM and federal NESHAP requirements.
</ul>
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Revise Rule 219 to:
<P><ul><li> Eliminate written permits for approximately 4,400 CFC recovery and recycling systems and approximately 4,400 portable internal combustion engines (ICEs).  Through re-evaluation of other equipment categories, staff has identified an additional 2000 permit units that represent a negligible emission potential and propose that these units also be eliminated from the AQMD&#146;s permit system.
<P><li> Exclude from exemption any equipment subject to ATCMs or NESHAPs, resulting in the addition of approximately 500 new permits to the system.  Due to the nature of the equipment subject to these requirements, and the mandates to ensure compliance with applicable state and federal requirements, a written permit requirement is deemed appropriate for this equipment.
</ul>
<P><B>Policy Issues</B>
<P>Staff received various requests from industry to add specific equipment exemptions to the proposed rule, and has worked with various industry representatives to determine the viability of exempting these equipment categories.  A public workshop was held on September 5, 1996, where staff received additional comments on the proposed amendments to Rule 219.
<P>Staff has addressed the concerns raised by industry and the public in Appendix A - Response to Comments of the Draft Staff Report for Proposed Amended Rule 219.  Remaining unresolved comments dealt with the exemption of additional equipment categories.  Staff will continue to work on these requests for possible consideration in a subsequent amendment of this rule.  These comments and the responses made by staff are also included in Appendix A of the Draft Staff Report.
<P><B>AQMP &amp; Legal Mandates</B>
<P>Equipment categories which would be exempt from written permit as a result of this proposed amended rule are either not subject to BACT, or will participate in the Statewide Registration Program.  In either instance, no emission impacts are anticipated as a result of this proposed rule.  Proposed Rule 219 is not an AQMP measure, and is not amended in response to, or as a result of, any legal mandate.
<P><B>CEQA &amp; Socioeconomic Analysis</B>
<P>Staff has reviewed the proposed amendments to Rule 219 and has determined that they are exempt from the requirements of CEQA.  The amendments are administrative in nature and will not significantly impact the emission levels currently associated with the existing rule.  Therefore, a Notice of Exemption will be prepared pursuant to state CEQA Guidelines Section 15002  (k)(1).  The Notice of Exemption will be filed with the county clerks immediately following the adoption of the proposed amendments.
<P>The proposed amendments to Rule 219 are not expected to result in cost impacts, overall.  The detailed assessment is attached.
<P><B>Implementation Plan</B>
<P>Due to the substantial number of permits to be eliminated as a result of this rule amendment, affected sources will be contacted by mail and directed to appropriate AQMD personnel for assistance in making the necessary permit changes. 
<P><B>Resource Impact</B>
<P>Implementation of the proposed rule will result in an estimated net reduction in fee revenues of approximately $1.47 million per year comprised of the following: 
<p>
<table><tr><td>Equipment with negligible emissions<td>$465,000 reduction
<tr><td>Equipment regulated by other governmental entities<td>$409,000 reduction
<tr><td> Equipment exempt pursuant to state law<td>$754,000 reduction
<tr><td>Equipment subject to NESHAP/ATCM requirements<U>(   $157,000)</U> increase
<td> $1,471,000
</table>
<P>This information is summarized in the table below.  A more detailed breakdown is provided in Appendix B - Emission Inventory and Fee Revenue Data of the Draft Staff Report.  The removal of approximately 10,000 permits from the permit system will involve additional work on behalf of AQMD staff in the first year.  During this time, existing resources will be utilized to conduct outreach and appropriate permit and billing revisions for those sources affected by the proposed amendments.  Since the proposed amendments will realize a net decrease in the number of applications received annually, no additional permitting resources will be necessary.

<P><B>SUMMARY OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO RULE 219</B>
<P># =  Industry Concerns
<P><I>Italics</I> =  AQMD Staff Response
<P># Small anodizing operations using sulfuric acid emit minimal emissions and should be exempt.
<P><I>Staff agreed and has incorporated it in paragraph (l)(4).</I>
<P># There is no equity between solvent processes and radiation curing processes.  Six gallons of UV coatings emit much less VOC than one gallon of solvent-based coating or two gallons of graphic art materials.
<P><I>Staff is examining the issue of equity in terms of exemption levels, not just for the coating </I><I>operations but also for many other types of operations, such as the combustion equipment.  </I><I>Staff will explore this issue and plans to have recommendations in the next amendment of Rule </I><I>219, scheduled to be in mid-1997.  Specifically, staff agrees that six gallons of UV coatings contain </I><I>less VOC than one gallon of solvent-based coating; however, there may be clean-up solvent used in </I><I>an actual coating operation, and therefore, the total VOC emitted from the two types of coating </I><I>operations may be comparable.  In addition, in a spray coating operation, six gallons of UV </I><I>coatings would produce more particulate matter emission than one gallon of solvent based </I><I>coating.</I>
<P><I># </I>Request to exempt wastewater evaporators used for dewatering aqueous part washer solutions containing no VOC, air compressor condensate, or machining fluids containing 50 gm/liter VOC or less.
<P><I>Staff has conditionally agreed with the request and has incorporated it in paragraph (l)(34).  As the </I><I>result of some research and sample analyses, staff proposes to exempt evaporation of wastewater </I><I>from certain aqueous part washer solutions, air compressor condensate, and a limited amount of </I><I>machining fluids.  Please see the Proposed Amendments, section (II)(11) for more details.  Staff </I><I>will further investigate the machining fluid evaporation and other processes where evaporation of </I><I>wastewater results is used and will recommend exemptions as appropriate in future amendments to </I><I>Rule 219.</I>

<P><B>Committee:</B><blockquote>Administrative, October 18, 1996, Recommended for Approval</blockquote>
<P><B>Recommended Action:</B>
<blockquote>1.   Approve the release of RFP #9697-14 for System Development and Maintenance Services;
<P>2.   Authorize the Chairman to execute an amendment to the District&#146;s contract with Telos  Consulting Services in an amount of $100,000 for critical post-migratory system  enhancements and extend the contract term to February 28, 1997.</blockquote>
<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer
<hr>
<B>Background</B>
<P>In 1993 and 1994, the Board approved two RFPs to contract with up to three vendors to obtain cost-effective systems development services on a task order basis.  Several contracts subsequently were awarded and the selected contractors bid on specific work plan requests for software and systems development during the last three years as specific needs and projects arose.  The products of these initial basic ordering agreements have allowed the AQMD to migrate mission-critical software systems from an HP3000 database to a relational database on a DEC8400 computer using client-server technology.  These new systems are now in production District-wide, and used by all AQMD staff for viewing and processing application/permit data, compliance data, and finance data.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Post-migration efforts will include both routine system maintenance for newly migrated systems and additional system development.  Additional development efforts are needed to enhance system functionality and to provide AQMD staff with additional automation for improving productivity.  At the same time, IM is developing and/or acquiring systems capable of efficiently implementing new and evolving rules such as RECLAIM and NSR rules.
<P>IM has a staff of computer specialists, systems analysts, and programmers to provide computer support services to the AQMD as a whole.  However, IM does not maintain sufficient staff to meet the current and anticipated demand for enhancing current systems, developing new systems, and other necessary support services.  To provide necessary post-migration system development and maintenance, an RFP should be issued to solicit bids for these services over the long-term on a Task Order basis, and the existing contract with one of the current contractors that participated in the system migration effort should be amended to provide immediate system enhancements.  
<P>Some of the enhancements needed immediately are to provide staff with additional functionality and to improve productivity through additional automation.  AQMD currently has a task order-type contract for Systems Development with Telos Consulting Services (Telos), a WMBE-certified vendor.  (Approved by the Board at its June 10, 1994, meeting.)  The contract currently is funded from the FY 1995-96 Budget.  The Telos team has the necessary understanding of the newly-migrated systems that is essential for developing and implementing system enhancements quickly and correctly.  The estimated cost to complete the most critical post-migration effort exceeds the amount of funding in the Telos contract.  To expedite delivery of these enhancements, the Telos contract should be modified to add additional funding in the amount of $100,000 and to extend the contract term by two months to February 28, 1997 to cover the interim period until a new systems contract is in place.
<P>It is also necessary to provide for system development and maintenance over the long-term.  In addition to the recently migrated mission-critical systems, programs in support of RECLAIM have been or are being developed.  These systems will be enhanced to handle the developing requirements of facility permits to satisfy Title V.  To manage both RECLAIM and non-RECLAIM activities, systems are envisioned which will utilize new methods of processing permits and tracking compliance issues.
<P>To accomplish this, an RFP should be issued to solicit bids for these services on a Task Order basis.  The use of pre-approved consultants enables IM to continue to provide highly responsive and cost-effective information services.  It also allows IM to obtain specialized expertise to augment staff expertise.
<P>In accordance with the District&#146;s Consulting and Contracting Policy, a public notice inviting bids will be published in the following publications:
<P> California State Contracts Register, Chinese Daily News, Eastern Group Publications, El Chicano, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, Inland Empire Hispanic News, Korean Central  Daily, La Opinion, La Voz, Los Angeles Sentinel, Los Angeles Times, M/W/DVBE  Source, Orange County Register, Philippine News, Precinct Reporter, Rafu Shimpo,   Riverside Press Enterprise, San Bernardino Sun, The Black Voice News, and The Excelsior. 
<P>Additionally, potential bidders will be identified through Los Angeles County&#146;s Directory of Certified Minority, Women, Disadvantaged and Disabled Veterans Business Enterprises; the Directory of Certified Firms published by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority; The Inland Area Opportunity Pages Ethnic/Women Business &amp; Professional Directory; the Caltrans electronic bulletin board listing of Disadvantaged and Women Business Enterprises; the AQMD&#146;s own electronic listing of certified minority vendors; and the Purchasing mailing list.  
<P>Copies of the RFP also will be mailed to the Black Legislative Caucus, Latino Legislative Caucus, and various minority chambers of commerce and business associations, and public service announcements will be sent out to local radio, TV and cable stations.  The RFP also will be posted on the Internet.  <I>Further personal outreach efforts by staff will be made to various </I><I>minority businesses and chambers of commerce to inform and invite prospective bidders to </I><I>visit the Diamond Bar facility and to submit proposals.</I>
<P>Pre-approving contractors to provide systems development services through a task order contract has proved to be cost-effective and more technically responsive than allocating the funds to temporary services or hiring full-time staff.  It enables the AQMD to have a pool of well-qualified professionals who have demonstrated their understanding of and expertise in meeting agency needs.  Also, turnaround time is reduced considerably because staff does not have to go through a lengthy individual selection process for each project.
<P>IM anticipates retaining a single consultant for one year, with the option to renew for two one-year periods, but would award more than one contract if necessary to better meet AQMD needs and requirements.  As specific AQMD needs or projects arise, a Work Plan Request will be released to the retained consultant.  For each Work Plan Request, the consultants must submit a Work Plan that includes both a technical and cost proposal which is approved by IM prior to initiation of task work.  Thus, the pre-approved contractor must demonstrate both technical capabilities and reasonable cost for each Task Order. 
<P>Funds for these additional services in the amount of $300,000 are included in the approved FY 1996-97 Budget.

</blockquote>
<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer
<P><hr>
<P><B>Background</B>
<P>The AQMP includes provisions for the expedited, future implementation of advanced emissions-reduction technologies and clean-burning fuels.  To help meet the technological needs of the AQMP, the Board adopted a Clean Fuels Program in 1988 and established AQMD&#146;s Technology Advancement (TA) office to administer the program.  Since its inception, AQMD&#146;s TA program has co-sponsored hundreds of development, demonstration, and research projects.
<P>To optimize the effectiveness of AQMD&#146;s TA program, it has been advantageous to supplement in-house technical resources and expertise with outside assistance.  Through the use of selected consultants, AQMD staff are best able to keep informed about the broad range of emerging technologies and clean-burning fuels and help facilitate their deployment in the Basin.  This also ensures that the most up-to-date information can be assimilated for use in the AQMP.  A very useful type of contract for getting technical assistance on an &quot;as-needed&quot; basis is the level-of-effort (LOE) contract, which, once executed, allows staff to issue task orders to a consultant for ongoing work as well as to provide specific assistance when needs and issues arise.
<P><B>Proposals</B>
<P>Staff proposes awarding FY 1996-97 funding to amend LOE contracts with two consultants.  These two proposals were considered at the October 11 Board meeting after being approved by the Technology Committee, and the full Board carried them over to the November meeting.  At its October 18 meeting, the Administrative Committee approved the two carried-over proposals on a sole-source basis for consideration at the November 8 Board meeting.  As recommended by the Administrative Committee, future staff proposals for sole source awards in which costs to prepare documents exceed cost for consultant will include cost comparisons.  Staff also is moving ahead to establish a list of pre-qualified experts through an open-bid process for Technology Advancement-related consulting contracts.
<P><U>Proposal #1: Amend S.E. Hamilton &amp; Co. Contract</U>
<P>Since March 1995, S.E. Hamilton &amp; Co. has provided technical support for AQMD&#146;s TA program.  The total amount of funding that has been authorized to date is $33,000.  Staff proposes to amend LOE contract #95105 with S.E. Hamilton &amp; Co. for an additional $16,500.  Steve Hamilton has been providing the AQMD with a valuable service gathering information about the activities of the transit industry to deploy low-emission, alternative-fuel buses.  Under the proposed amendment to his contract, Mr. Hamilton will continue to provide information on the availability, air-quality benefits, and cost of alternative-fuel buses and help get the word out to local transit districts.  Mr. Hamilton will continue to attend and report on relevant local transit committee meetings regarding the implementation of alternative-fuel buses.  He will coordinate discussions on related issues among AQMD staff and key transit district staff, and identify major problems and barriers related to the phase-out of diesel buses in the Basin. 
<P><U>Proposal #2: Amend Davis &amp; Associates Contract</U>
<P>Since late 1994, Davis &amp; Associates has provided technical support for AQMD&#146;s TA program.  The total amount of funding that has been authorized to date is $85,000.  Staff proposes to amend LOE contract #96051 with Davis &amp; Associates for an additional $35,000 to continue providing technical assistance involving transit buses and other heavy-duty vehicles.  Specifically, the proposed amendment will allow Davis &amp; Associates to 1) assist staff in evaluating the emission benefits, availability, cost, and obstacles to the commercialization of heavy-duty, mobile emission control technologies; 2) assess technical progress and economic aspects of current transit industry programs involving new technological applications for low- and zero-emission transportation, including the Advanced Technology Transit Bus (ATTB) program, the Fuel Cell Buyers Consortium, and activities of the Federal Transit Administration; and 3) participate in AQMD&#146;s Fuel Cell Implementation Task Force and other selected technical forums involving low- or zero-emission transportation applications. 
<P><B>Sole Source Justification</B>
<P>Section II, Step 3 (C) of the Consultant Selection Policy and Procedure identifies four provisions under which a sole-source award may be justified: (1) cost to prepare documents exceeds cost for consultant, (2) delay would result in the endangerment of public health, (3) services are only available from sole source, and (4) other circumstances exist identifying sole source as in the best interests of the AQMD.  Sole source justifications for these proposals are made under the following provisions:
<P><U>S.E. Hamilton &amp; Co.</U>
<P>This request for a sole-source award is made under provision (4).  Staff believes that it is in the best interests of the AQMD to amend the existing contract with S. E. Hamilton &amp; Co.  Steve Hamilton is the principal of this minority-owned governmental and public affairs consulting firm.  Mr. Hamilton is an experienced government-relations specialist and an established public transportation agency expert.  Mr. Hamilton has extensive experience and expertise in coordinating clean-fuel-related technology transfer activities among local governments, industry, and transit districts.  He has established extensive contacts within many municipal and regional transit properties, as well as throughout local governments.  He has worked successfully with city council members and transit board members to explain the environmental and public-health benefits of clean, alternative-fuel buses, as well as their commercial viability.  Mr. Hamilton&#146;s past work for the AQMD in this area was instrumental in the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority&#146;s (LACMTA&#146;s) October 1993 adoption of a pledge to phase out the purchase of diesel-powered buses.  In sum, staff believes that Mr. Hamilton is uniquely qualified to act as a liaison among AQMD staff, transit staff, minority communities, and local officials regarding policy towards clean-fuel buses and low-emission transportation technologies.  Amending the existing contract with S.E. Hamilton appears to be the most cost-effective means for staff to continue obtaining the needed services.
<P><U>Davis &amp; Associates</U>
<P>This request for a sole-source award is made under provision (4).  Staff believes that amending the existing contract with Davis &amp; Associates is in the best interest of the AQMD, based on several factors.  Davis &amp; Associates has extensive transit industry expertise, and, equally important, the ability to provide objective and independent technical assessments regarding the many types of emerging low- and zero-emission transit bus technologies.  Rich Davis, principal of Davis &amp; Associates, is a recognized expert in public transportation applications and issues.  His detailed technical expertise in alternative-fuel applications for transit buses is acknowledged worldwide.  As Director of Equipment Maintenance for one of the nation&#146;s largest transit properties (now LACMTA), he managed the largest alternative-fuel and low-emission bus program in the world.  Reports from his engineers were used by state, local, and federal regulators as the basis for new efforts to clean up the heavy-duty vehicle sector.  He was instrumental in obtaining funding, designing, and constructing Southern California&#146;s first commercial, heavy-duty test facility at LACMTA.  This facility enables the State of California to perform comparison emissions testing on heavy-duty alternative-fuel engines and vehicles.  Mr. Davis&#146;s original concept of a purpose-built, environmentally friendly transit bus for the 21st century led to initiation of the internationally recognized ATTB program.
<P>In sum, Davis and Associates is highly qualified to conduct the proposed work and has a proven ability to provide objective and independent technical assessments.  Amending the existing contract with Davis and Associates appears to be the most cost-effective means for staff to continue obtaining the needed technical services.
<P><B>Resource Impacts</B>
<P>The total cost of executing these contractual arrangements, as summarized in the table below, is $51,500.  Sufficient funds are available in the FY 1996-97 Budget.

<P>James M. Lents, Ph.D.
<BR>Executive Officer
<hr><p>
<B>Background</B>
<P>In April 1995, the Board adopted a 12-point Business Clean Air Partnership, one component of which is to streamline and simplify permitting requirements for most small businesses.  The Regulatory Reform Initiatives adopted by the Board this include a strong focus on both streamlined permitting and electronic submittal of necessary forms.  A program was initiated to progress toward these goals by (1) compiling the technical information required to evaluate equipment types (including emissions data); 2) performing engineering evaluations to verify compliance with all applicable rules and regulations; and 3) designing a system to receive and process this information consistent with AQMD central database requirements.  The requirements necessary to build an equipment registration, tracking, and approval system for the designated equipment categories have been compiled into a Detailed Design and Software Requirement Specifications Document.  This new computer system, RACER (Remote Application of Certification and Equipment Registration) will allow manufacturers and dealers of various equipment to remotely register new equipment models and file applications for certified equipment permits on behalf of their customers.
<P><B>Proposal</B>
<P>Staff proposes to develop the RACER system from the design described in the attached RFP.  The initial design will be modified as the first step in the contract to make the system Internet-accessible rather than stand-alone, thus providing greater flexibility.  Upon approval of the modified design, the contractor will construct the system for implementation on the AQMD&#146;s Internet Homepage.  This project will enhance and expand the AQMD&#146;s current design for a certification/registration program to allow implementation of electronic permit application filing on the Internet.
